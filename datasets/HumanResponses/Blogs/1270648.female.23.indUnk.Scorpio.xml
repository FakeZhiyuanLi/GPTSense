       It's now 8:40 pm, and I am sort of still recovering from last night. I went to a fundraising party at a dance school. We stayed there until the metro opened. We were: Eugene "The Dance God", Audrey "The Straight Hair", Sarah "The "That Face Again"", Andrei "The Ultimate Chessmaster" and me. It was pretty cool: the obscure stuff that we drunk made us sing and dance all night.  We went home at 7 am. I called Andrei two times already, but he is still asleep (it's been 12 hours, hello?!! :)  Oh, yeah, Sarah. Poor her. She is new to our crazy bunch. Sarah, you rock! I am glad that I have such a wonderful new friend. (this last word will clear out the misconception that might have taken place lately :)   Anyway, yesterday's party coincided with nice news for me. I got the admission offer from McGill and am going to start pursuing a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering next fall. I think I am going to take a minor in software engineering.   I am also planning on taking part in the Provincial Physics Contest in April. Wish me luck!

       Ok, so I am getting there (in terms of redoing this whole thing). The nav menu is almost ready. None of the buttons works so far. Drop by tomorrow.

       Hi vladster.net is currently in the process of a complete redesign. There will be some flash and other fancy stuff. There will also be a new page dedicated to nonsense we hear every day (no offence to sensitive readers:). So far I will only put my own impressions. I'm also giving the blogger a second chance.   urlLink Daily Log Archive

       I was listening to an old song yesterday, which made me remember my grandparents' huge old house where all the relatives used to get together for holydays and weekends. I was just a little kid then, and I am now starting to realize how much it all meant to me. There was this song. Somehow, it was always in the background, even when it was quiet. I remember my mother playing piano in that house and myself desperately trying to catch up on the accordion, thus ruining the whole thing. I remember jumping into the snow hills in the back yard from the balcony with my cousin. It was such a pure airborne sense of happiness... the ultimate bliss. We would then run to the kitchen and eat pancakes with honey and hot tea. I can clearly see my uncle's room with the Aeroflot posters all over the place. He was just a rookie co-pilot then.  Many of the people I remember from that time have now spread all over the world; some died. The house has been sold along with the piano and all the happiness once reigning inside. Yeah, I know, life goes on. Damn, I would give everything I have now to bring that time back for just a minute! Nothing is so close and yet so unreachable to us than our past.

       Hi ! I geeked out for 4 hours doing weird math and physics and now I'm here to tell you that  I'm  sorta bored and tired. Also, what are these juicy details anyway ?  And, yeah, I've heard that on some date we follow a different schedule, like a Friday is going to be Monday, or something like that ? When is it ppl, cuz I don't have an agenda this semester.

       Exams? What exams? What is "study" anyway?! Ok, seriously, I need to get those ass'ts done as soon as possible, otherwise I'm f&#ked, big time. There is so much stuff to be written that I am seriously considering starting studying after two years of slacking-off.  Man, she wants juicy stuff. How about going first you little pervert? ;) We'll catch up. We could start a whole thread, put a password on it and grant access to whoever we think appropriate. Just joking of course :).   P.S. Mr. The Chessmaster is getting the award for an outstanding contribution to student life! He is too ... hmm... SHY to brag about it, but that's what i'm here for. Yo the MAN, Andrei! Keep it up.  Nu, teper' vsya utka nasha!!!

       Yo, what's going on everyone! nobody posts anything on the site anymore. Do you guys have news or something to say? Anyways, I`m just wandering how you guys are doing; I have a little bit of free time today. Now, I'm going back to "study" physics, becuase there is a pretty girl sitting there (perhaps I should study chemistry instead). Good luck on your exams, people!

       What a boring day it was!  I can't wait for the weekend. It's going to be a change finally. On the other hand, it might suck just as badly.  We'll see. I have an unbeatable desire to say something profound and/or philosophical, but I just won't bother. Gotta go home.

       I got some good news (actually, it depends). There is a new layout coming soon. It will be even more simle and clear. Perhaps, it will look a bit similar to that at the  urlLink blogvoices .com. I am really obsessed with clarity, simplicity and alike lately.  There is also going to be a new section. In there I will post the ever-expanding list of this blog's members (of course with their permission). Below each member's nick there will be a collective description of that person consisting of others' opinions about him/her.  It is all expected to go online around May 15 - the last day of classes at Vanier. Oh, man, I just can't wait! Let me know what you think.

Sorry, I just have to brag about it :). It's called "The Alan Liddlard Memorial Award for Oustanding Academic Achievements and a Significant Contribution to Student Life". Oh, yeah baby!!!!

       I got it, but who needs total control? What I'm persuaded in is that we all do equally stupid things sometimes. It's a quite dull subject to argue about anyway. The thing I can't figure out is why is it more fashionable to keep all your stuff inside, not to let anybody know what's on your mind? Why is it cool to be cold and insensitive? I have been like this for the most of my sensible lifetime, and it proved to be a successful way to get people's attention, respect, love, whatever. I have changed a lot during the last two years and I am finding myself loosing it, loosing control, loosing discipline, loosing friends. I feel I am becoming weaker every minute.  Anyways, no sarcastic remarks on this one please. I don't need you to feel compassionate either. I'm just thinking aloud here... And the last narcissistic note for a long time to come: I am comming back, back to being the person I used to be. Andrei, what do you think? Scary eh?  Later,

Audrey...you know men know they can't live without us. So if you look at this logically, pilots, engineers...whatever wouldn't exist without us. We have the upper hand, total control. And between you and me...girls just don't sweat. Guyz on the other hand bring disgrace to socks and stink up the clubs when they dance. Did you realize that for the last 3 days the posts have been nothing but about gurlz?

       It's almost one...and I feel inspired by Vlad's angry picture! ...I like to run as I please, to jump as I please, to have fun, yell and sweat as I please...which is of course a free and legal way of expressing ourselves.  What is the problem with women playing soccer???? Is it a plasure only reserved to men? I think not! You agree, disagree or have valueable arguments or facts that considers women playing soccer impropre, please post it...  My inspiration has left me...I shall go to sleep now!  :)

       O.k. people, like Mr. Cheeseburger said it's my turn to come into the game. You guys seem pathetic arguing about such an issue over the internet. I mean we all know what you are both talking about. Stop all your deep thinking about choices Vlad and pick the one that comes to you first, naturally. Andrei has a different poimt of view on things and you guys shouldn'd even be discussing such an issue together. Besides the fries and the cheeseburger are to different maels that could be mixed together only if you have some Coke with it. What I mean is that I could solve the problem if you guys need me to (just ask). What I really wanted to say is that I'm back to Montreal from Toronto. Even though Idon't have the best news I'm full of inspiration and especially, like Andrei said once again, it's my turn to sing "lubov zachem ti mouchaesh menia". And by the way Andrei, I am able to save the trio from being completely eaten, because the coke always had the skill called "refill". As to you Sarah, you don't have to mind those two guys. It is ust some kind of late "crise d'adolescence" that their experiencing. You can be sure that Vlad is going to pick the right choice for him and Andrei's opinion will not be the obstacle in his case. Let me just tell you that everyone will end up happy within a short period of time from now. Don't worry and have fun everyone. See ya.

       What the... Andrei, you didn't get the point again. There is no fire. There is no "change of mood". Nothing got me so far. Don't be happy for me. You better take that post seriously for that was what I was thinking. Am I being too imperative? OK, let's quit there.  Sarah, if you're confused, that's OK - so is Andrei. :)

       Oops, I guess I took my time eating dinner and some new info appeared before I posted my previous note. Vlad, your mad note made me laugh a lot, because I imagined how ... well let's not get into funny details. :) But anyway, what upseting is that you didn't realize that your answer to my post was more comic then anything else, hehe. Nevertheless, I assume, that from now on, its PARTY TIME on this site, so I'm leaving the birds to show off their feathers:)).

       Wow dudes, it all sounds pretty interesting :)) , but "did I miss something?" . Hehe, I guess I did. :)) Annieway, I think there is a misunderstanding problem here, probably due to the middle of Spring :) You don't have to be sorry, Vlad; I'm not taking seriously what you posted, you were not thinking, rather feeling :). Just don't get emotional over this post too...  For everybody else who didn't get my previous post...oh well :)  ...do you remember: "Isn't it great to feel alive!!!!" ? :)) hehe.  Ahh...Vesna, vesna. Koroche, Vova, kak viju ti menia sovsiem ne ponail. Damn! Wow! Haha, something really got you! Pretty funny, and I'm happy for you :)). (Although, I was pretty astonished by your vivid reaction).  Sarah, you rock, eventhough you don't know what you are talking about. It's ok.  Vlad, sorry that I wasn't aware of your change of mood lately :), I didn't imagine that it's going to follow the behavour of an exponential function. I'm going to stop here, in order not to spill anymore oil on fire. :) (before it use to be a calm lake...oh dear...!)  Once again, WOW, I'm very, very, very impressed! Just hope you made the right choice dude!! Good luck! hehe. :) Sincerely yours, Andrei.   P.S. as for battleship statistics: there is only one man left in the sea (I hope) ... the rest of the trio is almost eaten. Mr Coke your turn to sing : ..."luibov', zachem ti muchaesh menia".... :)) (Shuchui, esli ne ponitno). Have fun guys!  :))

"...I might get you guyz upset but you can't understand everything..." Sarah, I know exactly what you're saying, but do you think YOU understand everything when it comes to shopping in THE mall? :))  By the way, our Dance God is back from Toronto! Hurrray!

       Ok...you guyz are freeking me out! Did I miss something here? I read the shopping problem , riddle, joke, test whatever it is...ummm is it some kind of practical joke or do you really have to make a chioce Vlad? N-e-wayz if you really want my opinion on this, I'm on the wild side, the 3rd choice is my pick. Live a little, relax. Sorry to let you know this and I might get you guyz upset but you can't understand everything. And the part about the remote control, who needs it! It will keep you on your feet if you have no control at all. Your whole relationship or time spent with this object will be a surprise, something ur looking forward to, or trying to figure out still! It is what stands out! It's what you like, go for it! The two other choices are B-O-R-I-N-G! Luv ya Vlad! Calichickxox

       Well said...  Andrei, you know, I will thank God for the rest of my life for not ever having to look at things "through your eyes". You think I'm joking, right? No man, I'm darn serious here. Who the #@&% are you to talk about being "aware of respect"? C'mon, look at you!   My goal in representing the situation as the choice between three 'items' was merely to make things simple. It was a free-body diagram, if you will. It did not in any way imply disrespect. Your 'pet' thing, on the other hand, was a great demonstration of YOUR way of thinking. You could at least try to make it look like a joke. Do you at all realize how sick it is? (By the way, dare not edit your post - it's a matter of respect!).   Now, on top of it all, you didn't get the main point. What I meant there is not what you call a PROBLEM. There is no problem. I might not buy any of the things right? There is the fourth possibility.  Andrei, in any case, thank you very much for your post. You made me make a decision. Sorry for putting you down like that. I just thought I could say what I think.  That's what I call friendship anyway. :)

       Well...hmmmm... :) Usually girls have that kind of problems when they go shopping :)). However, if you look at the problem through my eyes, I'm sure you'd find AN answer... Just keep in mind that you're in a "pet" store, not somewhere else :)) [no offence to the pets]. And...hmmm... Try not to think (if you can), simply be aware of  respect , and ... don't overflatter yourself :)).    Besides, if you're in a shopping mall, than who cares! It's not going to make you compose poems! :)).

       I think I want to write something, but I'm not sure how to put it...OK, listen carefully.  Say, you're in a mall and are looking at three different 'items', one of which you can buy. Technically, you could afford all three, but it isn't your style - you never buy more than one when you go to this particular mall.  The first thing is cool. It looks extremely nice and is just asking to be bought by you. You know for sure that anyone would buy it if they were you. It sort of suits you and everything, but it is somewhat boring. You can't really think of an occasion where you would REALLY enjoy it.  Moreover, you have a funny feeling that you will regret buying it... a really funny feeling.   The second item totally corresponds to your style. You can sense your own persona in it. You feel secure with it and, besides, it's doesn't require a frequent maintenance. It seems very reliable, but there is a circumstance that is stopping you from buying. Everybody has a similar kind of thing, and you HATE the crowd.  The third one BLOWS YOUR MIND. It is way beyond your comprehension. You don't know if it is what you want/need. You can't even decide whether it is what you like or hate. Yet, you are very attracted to it. You don't get why, but deep inside you have to admit it is true. The more you look at it, the more you want it. It occupies twice as much space in your mind as the other two altogether. However, it is completely out-of-phase with you stylewise. More still, it doesn't come with a warranty of any kind and lacks a remote control.   I was just wondering, what would you choose? If you didn't get AT ALL what I'm talking about here, then GO AWAY AND NEVER COME BACK. I don't care who you are. Peace :)

Anyways, I hope that something happens to Andrei today too, I'd like to laugh just as much as Vlad did. I think it's time to go now, because there is lots of girls on the bus at this time, or else Andrei will get them all. (just kidding; never) The news session is posponed till to tomorrow.

Did you take a picture of me singing at the dance school by any chance?? I would love to post it! By the way, Sarah, you're going to a party with me on Apr. 28. No, you don't have a choice. Seriously, don't get too excited though :), it's not going to be a date. I just need somebody I know well to go with.   Coming back to Andrei. Well... that was quite spectacular!

        Observations from Earth revealed the presence of carbon dioxide in Venus's atmosphere but were inconclusive about other possible constituents. We now know that carbon dioxide is in fact the dominant component of the atmosphere, accounting for 96.5 percent of it by volume. Almost all of the remaining 3.5 percent is nitrogen. Trace amounts of other gases, such as water vapor, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and argon, are also present.    Oh my God. I AM TIRED!!! Someone help me. Please. I am dying studying astrophysics here in the IT-Centre all by myself. Oh, no, there's one more near-dead body here...  Andrei, are you OK? What? What solar wind?! No, that's the runaway greenhouse effect. Could anybody imagine a runaway greenhouse on Venus?

       Today was a crazy night studying Astrophysics (hope Don Hetherington will be proud of Andrei and Vlad). But the brightest star on my mind was not one of those in the sky, but the one from the town past Laval. P.S. I almost finished units 4 and 6, Vlad however was stuck on Venus (unit 4).... /Andrei/

       Wow, Tygon. You got me worried here. Forgiveness... I dont' know man - you failed cal3. That's  pretty serious stuff. It's intrinsically wrong. We are gonna have to discuss that on June 14's reunion. Until then, I don't know what to do with you... but, rest assured, you won't die; we need you alive... so far that is. I'll let you go for now. Represent!

       Well, well, well........Fate it seems has a twisted sense of irony.  It reserves me good tidings and graceful news. I have met Advising and have been said that as I have been taking Organic Chemistry, it shall remplace my Cal3 failure. How refreshing is it to know that my future is still in hand. And to top it off, I shall get a full refund for the Organic Course because it will be considered as a normal semester course. Somewhat of an invinsible weight has been lifted off my shoulders and I am somewhat relieved. But the memory of a failing course is one that still lingers in my mind. True, I do not need that course since i will be attending Cell and Molecular Biology. Therefore an advanced course of Calculus is unnecessary. Though I can guarantee this much, in the near future I shall register for this course and redo Calculus 3 in University. Until then I will be nagged by that unshakable feeling of an unfinished business. So for now, the weather seems right and the mood is good, time to go learn about the hybrids. This is Tygon and I'm out. Peace

       So this is the grand announcement that I have to make. Pacholke has screwed me. And I have failed Cal3, on my graduating semester. It seems that everything that I had hoped for has come crashing down. I hoped to graduate this semester. The hope of graduating now seems dimmer knowing that the registration date for the summer course is over. I can't even get the Dean to grant me late access, because I am already taking Organic Chemistry as a specialization course just for exemption. Mind you I have never failed Organic. But what am i going to do about Cal? It wont suffice my DEC. And that probably means that I will probably have to stay another semester or do something else just for one course. I feel very depressed and suicidal. Never in my life have I failed a course not to mention Math. I have always been on top in Math and I have a natural ability or so I thought. My futur is in stake here and I dont know what path to take now. What I am going to do now? I leave you with sighs of desperation.

       What is this? Summer? I don't think so. I know it's stupid to complain about whatever we can't change, but, damn, I hate this weather!   Other than that, everything is moving along pretty smoothly. Don't kill me people, but.... hm...  I miss college.  Yeah, I really don't know why.

       Hellooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo everyone. First, welcome to Faisal. Ok, summer school sucks, however it's not that bad. And guess what, I'm going to grad anyway poeple. So get ready to party hard and drink yourselves to death. Well not as much. Annnieweiss, Andrei, I'm no longer wishing "Mary" X-Mass to anyone but rather I'm ready for some new stuff (not very new but you know what I mean). I hope we'll see you sometime before Friday night. I think we should all get together sometime soon, and Roman what about basketball. So what's everyone doing this summer? You know, besides basketball, we could make a BBQ party sometime soon as well. I'll try to take care of it and I'll let you guys know. If anybody has other ideas, post it on the site. As the activity director in the Chess Club, I'll be glad to hear. Audrey, what about Spanish and Salsa and stuff.   See ya all later and have a nice summer  (P.S. Mo if you have a chance to look at the site, tell us how France is)

       Sup people, Waj, sorry i didn't call you, there was no party on monday for various reasons. I'll try to come up with something before this week-end, or after, since for the week-end I'm going to NY!! hehe.   By the way people, I'm working, well training, at a rafting place!! At the "rapides de LaChine" , it's soooooo cool and fun!!!  I think i got a cold though, since it was raining all the days I wend down the river. (And I had to jump and swim in the river every time my boss is there to show that I "love" COLD water and water sports. Nevertheless it is actually very fun!!   What else, well, Faisal... hmmm... interesting  stuff :).  BTW, Roman do you still want to play basketball anytime soon? If yes we can all get together at my house, there is a basketball court 2 min walk. So call me.   See you later.

       Hey Waj, I've looked at the remainders of my notes and found just one test. It's the very first one on tensile stress, bending, torsion etc. I'll be at college (learning centre) tomorrow at around 11-12 am. Come get it if you want. (I spilled some juice on it though :).

       As I enagage myself in an orgy with my keyboard and my video card(ge-force2 32mb GTS!!!!!) I realize that i am bored. I have been playing nothin but games on the internet. you name it, I've played it. I am sick bored of the summer already. work starts on friday. I'll work at Beaver Tails or some of u frenchies know it as Queues de Castor. You feel like u want something. Drop by, I still charge you full price. What u thought I would give u a discount, u sadistic money-sucking capitalists. Just kiddin. So whats up with u all? Vacations anyone?? Holy shit i just remembered!!! I got number 6 wrong on the cal3 test. Damnit!!!!!  Oh who cares ! Pacholke can go suck his integral. While he's at it, i hope his differential equations gets him bent, and his spherical coordinates gives him some BDSM. I swear to you this guy's fetish is Math!!! He's not a good engineer, only a good mathmatician, not wait, he's a slick mathmatician. I got the 20 i was hoping for my astro website, kickass. Anyone of you guys into computer multi-player games. If so, tell me. I have no life anyways. I'll be up all night playing. Oh jesus, i 've been playing so much and meeting so less girls that i think that the mouse is sexy. Look at that round waist and that sleek body. she wants me to push her buttons. I'll double-click her....  Hmm... I just realized that that last sentence was my cue to leave.  see y'all around. latez

I'm going to New York and Cali this summer I can't wait to beat this town. I'll probably bump into Andrei down there. Anywayz, as soon as my agonizing summer course is over, I'm gone baby! Maybe I'll finally get discovered by some famous agent. New York and Cali are the places for that. So if you don't here from me next by the end of the summer, look for me on TV, the radio, magazine covers, Oprah, MTV...who knows? Ok I'm going to shut up now.

       O.k. I have something to say to Wajdi and Roman. Some poeple seem to be very excited about getting their diplomas here, I mean I don't care, good for you. However, even if I still have another stage of college  to go through, I say woohoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo. Why? Well, as Vlad said the summer is gonna rock. So Wajdi, I think we should be happy and proud to stay at Vanier for a few more weeks. Doesn't it just tell you how important we are for Vanier? Anyway, don't worry people, I'm still going to grad and I'll make the big party happen. Have fun people, keep in touch  and let's do something on the week-end, possibly today. Audrey, call me please when you get a chance.

       Good evening everyone, Well im back from a noter linear algebra marathon...why am I trying so hard for this exam? Ah, whatever, its just this last exam, but I still have a summer course, I hope its not that hard, but its with Cowan, is it really easy? Vlad are the tests really from the problem sets? I really do not feel like working that much this summer. Its almost university time, almost.....I cant wait....well sort of. When the work starts, then I want out....The best thing is to take a year off to relieve all that cegep stress from bhola, chahal, dunsky.....That is what we all need. Let us all go to Cuba and sell Cigars for a year, then come back to the wonderful word math and physics. WOO HOO!!!!!!!!!!!! Sounds good? Vlad, you up for it? We leave tomorrow!!!!!!!!!! Im registering tomorrow for the statics course, it better be open, cause if im stuck taking bio2 or organic 1 im going to go NUTS!!!!!!!!! NUTS I TELL YOU!!!!!!!!! there is no way I want to touch anything that has to do with carboxyl's and animal anatomy and circulation. And there is no way I am taking prob and stats, that is just freaking BORING......Well I think I shared enough of my thoughtless thoughts of the evening, now its time for me to exit and enter the world of dreams. I wonder whats on the menu tonight? saving the world or running away from that guy with the cane.....Hmmm, I wonder......well its time to go find out, the suspense is killing me :) hehehe :) Goodnight dudes  P.S. If it smells like crap, it is crap  PEACE!!!!

       I am temporarily drained of my emotional and intellectual vitality by that tripple integration transformed into the spherical system of coordinates. Sometimes it seems equivalent to navigating the Ste. Croix - C�te Vertu intersection using the map of the southern hemisphere. But that's still GOOD STUFF!!!!!! OUH!   I just found out that all the graduating Science Plus people are going to have lunch in a nice resto at the college's expense. Ain't that nice of them, eh? Now I see why they were trying to fail so many of us - to spend less money on the lunch! :))  But we're tough stuff! We made it....well...we're almost there... many of us.  Am I flattering myself? Oh, yes indeed! May I? Thank you very much.

       Hi Wajdi, Cowan's the best physics teacher at Vanier. The class is real easy. You saw me "studying hard" all semester :). What do you think I got?  Exams are the same as the examples in class and in handouts. Just go to classes and study for a couple of hours before every test. That's guaranteed 90's. (well... don't show this to those who failed OK?)

HAPPY HAPPY.....Glashan called my house saturday morning to tell me my mark.....saweeeeeeeeeeeeeet Hey Vlad, how is Cowan and the statics class? is it easy enough to pull off an 80? and how are the tests structured? Well, its getting late and I really need sleep. I have been reading about vector spaces and subspaces for the whole day......WHAT AN INTERESTING COURSE THIS LINEAR ALGEBRA IS!!!!!!!!!!!! well goodnight folks. night

With biology, what you think you got you never get....Lets hope Glashan gets the nice disease and lets me go to university :) Well guys, its almost over, for some of us (Mo) its already over. Guys its been a long tedious semester, but we got through it. Most of it that is. I hope I get a passing grade in biology. Cause when it happens, its gonna be smooth sailing from then on... BOOM BANG!!!!!! So how is everyone doing? good? good.....Im nervous as hell. I have to find out what happened in biology. Have to.... Gotta make this one short, I have to go and do the groceries.....hehehe, little does my mother know, never send your boy to do the groceries, cause he is gonna come back with nothing you told him to bring......OH YEAH!!!! here come the chocolate bars and coke.....alright guys, its shopping time see you soon :) l8er doods P.S. stay out of the oven!!!!!

       I came to college to study for my astrophysics test. Despite the special kind of mood I was trying to set myself into in the morning, the right half of my brain was doing its best to make me slack off for a little while. It was a good sign, however, that there was nobody in the library who would draw my attention for more than 15 seconds. As a direct consequence of the latter circumstance, I came down to the cool comfort of the IT centre and started dilligently omiting boring selections from my astrophysics CDROM.  (10 mins later) Audrey is here too. She is writing some paper, and she asked me for a summary of what had happened to the Soviet Union in the late 1980's - early 1990's. Well, knowing that it would take me an hour just to lay some ground for further discussion, I had limited myself to a two-minute overview of my own simple-minded opinion on the subject. She seems satisfied.  (7 hours later) Oh god, it's never going to end. WAAAY too much stuff. Time to read summaries only.  (10 hours later) OK, I'm done now. 'night.

       It's about time for another  pathetic  interlude that nobody, not even you, will get the way I want it to be understood. Am I complaining about something? Not at all. I GIVE UP.  It's not what I do very often, but I just can't help it anymore. These a few months have definitely been  something  in my life. There was plenty of what I had done for the first time, failing a cal test being one and the least significant thing. I have failed to do and not to do so much that I am even getting used to this weird looserish failure state. Tonight I was talking to a friend in an old port caf�, and she totally unintentionally made me realize exactly that.  It seems that eveything I touch or even think about tends to go wrong. No, I didn't drink tonight, nor am I being paranoid. Gosh, I can clearly see the two faces here "knowing" where this all is coming from. They are wrong. Seriously.  All I wanted to say is that I am going to quit. I will quit worrying, quit trying to control stuff, quit trying to keep balance and play it safe. Maybe it's just a way to say I'm tired. I am very tired. I need some hard and dull physical work.    P.S.  unless...

       Hello people. Yes, this was the last day of classes. I had three exams today and I don't how they went. But as Wajdi would say THE HELL WITH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Wajdi, wasn't the physics exam fun today? By the way, I had exactly the same topic for the essay as you. Finaly, this day came and we are going to enjoy the summer guys. I'm already starting to prepare myself to go to Cuba in august (what dop you think Vlad). Mr. the Chessmaster, we ARE going to Cuba the second week of august. There are still finals, but it's alright we'll survive. Anyway, the day tired me up pretty much and I have nothing say or even no inspiration to wright. Just wanted to let everyone know, I'm still alive. see ya at the exit exam tomorrow

       Ok guys, for those of you who have been desperately trying to publish over the weekend. This blogger thing has got me so mad lately, I almost deleted it and set a normal bbs system.  They are saying that everything is back to normal now. It seems that it got a bit faster too. So, I say, let's give 'em one more chance. If this kinda thing happens again, I'll do something about it immediatelly. d'night.

I just finished writing a nice little essay on Dr. Kevorkian and how he self glorifies himself, sound familiar Mo? which one did you do? This whole weekend was devoted to biology, I was studying all the phylums, the evolution of plants and ecology....you gotta love all those cycles, and who can forget the GREAT chapter of vertabrates, 40 pages of FUN FUN FUN........so who so the baskteball game today? did Philadelphia win? I did not catch the end of it...>I was too busy studying BIOLOGY!!!!!!!! well im not going to be able to get to my thoughtless thoughts tonight, I am really tired and im just so happy that I finished this essay early :), yes thats right, finishing an essay at 2 am is early for me.....I did start it at 10:30 so that could be another reason :) well, its time to catch some ZZZZZZZ, I have a french exam at 8am, should be pretty fun NIGHT EVERYONE!!!!!!!!!

       Hey guys   well i have not written in quite some time because of all those last tests. I have two more tests, one in chemistry health and beauty, and one in prob.and statistics. Then i am done. Hahaha!! I am not even worrying because even if I fail both tests with a zero, i'm still passin the classes!!!  Anyways guys, hang in there, this is the last time you will have to study and then you have all summer. So just sit infront of your books and tell youself you want the best grade possible so that you can be soo happy and you will have the nicest summer.  Also, my new super computer will be in my house on thursday! Woooooohoooooooo. I have a feeling i will take over the world with that machine. By the way Vlad, i am really Jealous that you have a new screen and a CDRW. You are soooo lucky. I need a new screen really bad and i would do anything for that CDRW. So, anything you want..i'll do for you..!  Oh and i have good news. My best friend was going to France with his friend this month and now his friend cannot go so he sold me his ticket for 350$. Isnt that amazing??? I am so happy. I'll even be staying at his place and eat there and all so it'll end up being sooo cheap and fun and such a good relieve for me as i graduate. I'll be gone on the 28th.   Well people, i must leave.

I am staying in Montreal this time after two summers spent in the northern Quebec outbacks. So, guys, if you know somebody, who might know somebody... you know... I would really appreciate. You know how responsible and reliable I am... :)) (duh).

Besides, let's make a graduation party or something, basically, let's invite around 200 students from Vanier and not only (i'm exadurating, but sort of).  man, "Bois de Bulonge" rocks!! I'm transfering!! hehe, do you believe me?? and please no commnents on the web! :) . haha.   So, hmmm.... so far we're biking to ottawa, swimming to cuba, what's next? Walk to NY :)   Anyway, I have to go.............guess where? hmmmmm...... last friday of school> last tutoring in the science center!!   bye

       Guys, c'mon. We are really starting to look like nerds.  Look aroundja! Man, I don't know what happened. Somebody brought all those cute girls to the city. It's amazing, somebody does this every spring. If I knew who it was, I would definitelly ask where (s)he is from. The bad thing is that the same somebody takes all the hot girls away for the winter. You know, I think they all come from Cuba! And that means, if we go there in August (WHICH WE WILL!!!!!), the girls won't be there, because they are all in Montreal for the summer!  Anyways, guys, stop whining about your courses. Concentrate and study. We will all get there and drink our asses off on June 14.  P.S. As promissed, the new layout is coming pretty soon. This one's ugly, I know.

       Hey everyone,  It is 1 am and I am still awake, I tried going to sleep but it is just not working, too many things clogging my mind, too many things worrying me. I cant believe I blanked out like that in biology, I think I overstudied. Well, looks like I will have to work twice as hard for the final now. I need to do really well on this final to pass this course. Cant do it again, cause if I have to memorize another phylum or cut open another pig I will go nuts. And physics out of all the courses I am struggling with...HOW????? The one course that I was never worried about is my biggest worry now. This semester was such a slap in the face, I hope I can make it out alive. Alright im going to attempt another shot at sleeping, see if it will work this time, maybe looking at the computer monitor will tire my eyes out. Well, goodnight everyone  oh and btw, Andrei I found the papers, I will then to you 4 to 5 pm thursday... goodnight

       O.k. You now after finding outy yesterday that i could not produce "induced current" during the whole semester, I decided to consume som pure methanol. When this happened, I realized that the standard deviation of the expected value of school performance was way too high and did not follow the normal distribution. I therefore synthesised a new poison (chem of health and beaty) and decided to give it to Bill Webb. Finally, I opened my russian book and concluded that "s tochki zrenia banalnoi irudutsii, kagdii chastnii individuum podvergen deistviu totalnogo opophiosa" (to vulgar to be translated). Wuzz up, science fricks. The only thing that made my day different though is  giving a dance course to a bunch of Vanier people at U.B. Man, I had some teachers come and learn from me. And you know what, one of the was Lucienne Namer, hehe. It all ende with a nice party in the learning centre afterwards. Anyways, gotta go consume some mor methanol now. See ya, bodies

       Wassup people. Man, sometimes I hate school. Particullay when I have work to do.  Now, swallow this, all you physic and math maniacs: when a compound A with formula C6H10 is oxidized with hot basic potassium permanganate and the resulting solution acidified, the only organic product that we can be isolated is CH3(CH2)3CO2H. Compound A is also soluble in concentrated sulfuric acid and rapidly decolorizes bromine in CCl4. Write the structure of A.  Isn't it interesting?? Awwww, how devine! (not)  Today was my last official  Extreme Chess  in Vanier as a student! Ten games at the same time, and it was done for !fun! hehe, score hmmm...well, 7.5/10.  Evgueni also kicked ass: dance courses for like 15 ppl, but he'll give you all the details.  By the way,  Wajdi, do you still have the paper Ron gave you last semester for revision of Nature and Humanity? Chiao dudes.   P.S. we are all biking to Cuba in August... hmmmm....

       Good evening everyone,  I haver returned, as I promised. I just finished studying for the lab exam, first time I ever finished studying before 1 am for a test, something is odd.....Aw well.....we will just see how it goes tomorrow right? RIGHT!.....I cant wait until this semetser is over, it was such a slap in the face, Now I am struggling to pass, its really scary, well I should of seen it coming, I slacked off too much this semester....now im paying for it.....I think I got burned from the sun, I was on the balcony today reading my bio lab book and the sun was frying my ass.....Its gonna be one hot summer dudes..... Dont you find it funny how you always make a schedule for yourself and you end up not following it and screwing yourself over BIG TIME? yeah, its pretty funny isnt it? Well guys, im out of thoughtless thoughts for tonight, the only thing I can think about is that bread mold produces sexually, LOL, that is just too funny......aw well, its time to go to sleep and think about prtozoans taking over the world MOUAHAHAHAAHAAAAHAHAHHAAAAAAH!!!!!!!!! Well, goodnight people  P.S. Vlad how did the french exam go? make it on time?  night

       Talking about motivaion with this kind of weather! hehe, well let's not get into details. All of ya talking about physics and math, think of organic chemestry!!! I have an exam on thursday and I'm going to die!!!!!! It's not even funny. Actually all the sciences we're studing here are pseudosiences. Why? Because while walking from D building to N building and observing the views on the left and on the right, especially after spending two sleepless nights of creazy studing for some test that suppose to be crucial in your future career, you realize that what ever you do, you'll end up there... and you know where!   Nevertheless, the school is almost over and summer makes it all! Gosh I can't believe it's the almost the end of the adventures of the Russian Trio, the Arab gang, the chicks and other brave pupils who undertook the challenges of "the tripple B", of "Hindu-bio", of "Husband's and wifes Chemistry" and all the other famous dares; and yet, were able to accomplishing these feats!!!! However, It's not over yet! One two weeks to go, (for some people one; b-----ds!)   Damn I'm late for class! See you later!

       Hey fizyxx, Mahajan's good. I took E&M with him. As for the rest, I have managed to escape "the tripple B". Mike Cowan rocks, so does Don H.  Nice problem Mo! Here's one more for ya guys. It's called "the snow plow problem" It's winter, and it's snowing all day long at a constant rate (you can already smell differentiation eh?) The snow plow starts plowing at noon. It goes 2 km in the first hour and 1 km in the second hour.  Question: When did it start snowing? Huh! Do you want to know the answer? 11:23 AM !!! :))) It's CAL 3.  Here's some stuff I've read recently. I think it makes perfect sense. How can you become known as a person who consistently demonstrates excellence? [...] Motivation is required for excellence. [...]Motivation is what we like to do naturally. It's like being right or left-handed.  We don't even think about it.  We just write.  The same is true for people known for excellence.  They have a group of motivations that work in concert to help them perform at a higher level.  Like all motivations, these were inborn and are as much a part of them as their eye color or their height.   The best we can be with low motivation is adequate .  No matter how hard we work and desire it, in the long run we will never be excellent at something without high levels of motivation in that area.  In other words, if we toil in areas where we have low motivation, we resign ourselves to mediocrity. But who wants to be mediocre?  Who wants to be known as "adequate"?

       Good evening everyone,  How is everyone doing on this fine evening? good? well thats just swell!!!!! :) How is everyone handling the final week? Thank god its almost over, cause this weather really makes me wanna say the hell with classes.....How bout some FOOTBALL!!!!!!!!!! and I mean real football, not american. What do you say Mo? you wanna play? :) I just finished torturing myself with biology and reading about all the different phylums and subphylums in the plant and animal kingdom. Learning about all the different kinds of protists, bacteria, fungi, and plants....its so WONDERFUL!!!!!! and how can we forget our favourite one, genetics and evolution.....OH JOY!!!!!!! you gotta love bio!!!!!!! Thank god im going to engineering, cause I cant take another bio course, im too lazy to read 400 pages. I want my calculator and pencil, that is all I need, thats what makes it so much fun (to an extent). Oh btw, I got a letter from concordia about burseries, telling me that I have until May 18th to reply, hmmm....what to do? Did you get this Mo? maybe that is the letter that Chadi got also..... Alright, something came to my attention today in bio class that Karram pointed out to me....When a teacher is talking about something and he/she knows that the class does not understand, do you know how easy it is to play with students heads and fool us into believing things that are not even true? Its amazing how much power teachers have, its insane.....Just imagine when we go to university and we find out that alot of the things that were told to us in physics by good ol' Benson's book was all wrong.....WELL guys, looks like we learned PSEUDOPHYSICS!!!!!! Arent you glad we are at Vanier????? damn, when you really think about it, it would be really bad if that really happened!!!! But in all seriousness, the physics here was good, with the exception of the triple B Crew, BHOLA, BHATIA, BENSON....oh and who can forget the hidden character MAHAJAN.....oh those guys, never giving up on their endless effort to make us all feel like we have an IQ of -10...YOU GOTTA LOVE EM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Well, looks like Im done with my thoughtless thoughts of the night.....now I will go sleep it off and think of more gibberish to tell you guys tomorrow night, tune in same vlad place, same vlad time, same vlad channel..... Goodnight everyone, P.S. THATS MY STORY AND IM STICKIN' TO IT!!!!!!!!!!! goodnight everybody

       hey everyone..       well, i have around 8 days of school left. After that, i am finished!! I really cant wait to be done and for some odd reason, i cannot get myself motivated for any of my last term tests. I am the only one here guys?      Anyways, i've finally ordered my new computer and i cant wait till it arrives. It is going to be my super computer!! If anyone wants to race my computer, just let me know...      So anybody here into hockey or basketball. Well either, i think we should all support the remaining Canadian city in the playoffs, the toronto maple leafs in hockey, and the raptors in basketball. I really hope they kick some american ass!! And for all of you soccer fans, come watch me play in the playoffs on wednesday, Universal break, at the gym.       Well, i've got to get back to my probability and statistics, but i'll leave you with a fun problem to tackle.  It is night and dark with no moon,  The war is raging and 4 people come  to a rickety old bridge down in the valley.  The bridge is not very wide and  is strong enough for only 2 people to cross at a time.  The group has only  1 flashlight.  So someone will have to bring the flashlight back for the others.  The condition of the group is such that each person takes a different length of time to cross the bridge.  The following table  shows the times, the name have been changed to protect the innocent:  Mr. White - takes 1 min Mr. Red - takes 5 min Mr. Black - takes 15 min Mr. Pink - takes 20 min  As they get to the bridge they notice dynamite around the bridge and a  timer showing 36 minutes until the bridge is destroyed.  Your mission is to  get the group across.

       OK, here's a word of support for Mo: math is  the best subject, everything else is trash. (hehe)  (especially theoretical math is good, if you'd like to burn your brains for no reason.) math is cool, I do like it more than other subjects, although I'm not good at it.  Also, I really think that the name of a school matters only if you decide to go abroad. If you're staying in the same province, I guess it only matters while you're fresh out of uni. At least, that's what my friends, who graduated many years ago say. And, really, ask anyone in Quebec if they've heard of any good technical schools in Germany or Sweden, or any other European country. I don't think many ppl will come up with a decent answer, even ppl in industry, at least it seems to be so. For North America that might be different though. I believe what matters is positions you've held, projects you've done, and so on, but the path to these is not only through the name of your school, hehe May be I'm thinking about all that in this way just because I'll most likely go to Concordia, McGill is not taking me for sure, whatsoever, hehe, so I'm practically guaranteed not to have that "name" :)

       This one will be exclusively dedicated to Mo.  It's the worst possible time for me to comment on your post, Mo, but I feel I have to.  We all know why people apply to McGill. We all know why the applied/accepted ratio at McGill is among the highest in this country. We all know what it's all about (name, prestige, contacts, whatever comes to your mind). We all know it, but some people are having a hell of a hard time accepting it. Oh well, I really don't think it's reasonable, to say the least. And all that crap about atmosphere, teachers... C'mon, Mo, let's be adults here. Do you support that "Don't let friends go to McGill" stuff? If so, I am really sorry, and I don't have anything else to say to you my friend. I know you chose Concordia because McGill didn't offer the program you wanted, and I respect your choice. However, please stop this Concordia-oriented brainwashing here. You're not even their student yet. Wajdi, talk to students and teachers from both institutions and make an educated choice.   Secondly, Mo, I have noticed lately that you are really obsessed with "superiority". "... mathematicians are the most important because they could derive formulas from physics and chemistry". Now, what kind of nonesense is this? Scientists  invented  math as a tool to communicate and reason their discoveries. Don't get me wrong though: I am not saying math is not important. Nevertheless, your whole statement is just silly. I know ( read: I hope ) you didn't really mean it.   Anyways, Mo, don't get too pissed-off. I'm just this kind nasty person picking on people's words. I am a little upset myself, that's why it's not really a good time to write this :) Sorry about that.  See ya in school!  P.S. I don't want to trigger a major discussion on the above subjects, but I think it's inevitable. Oh, well... I'll just go have some normal sleep, which I haven't had for three days now. Bye.

       hey everybody       forst of Vlad, i never said that 0 was equal to 1, i said 0! was equal to 1. Now u try to figure that out mister physician. Hey guys, dont u feel the sort of quiet competition in school between math, physics and chemistry teachers. I think they all work in groups and believe that they are superior to others. I personally think that the mathematicians are the most important because they could derive formulas from physics and chemistry. Without mathematicians, this world would be corrupt i believe!       Anyways, congratulation Wajdi on ur McGill accecptane. I do not think u should consider going there because there are too many risks involved. It is true that you will get a better name at McGill, but after u get a first job, companies dont care where u came from. So just come to Concordia, there are better teachers, better amosphere....cool? ok! Well guys see ya soon!

       Hey people,  How are you doing today? I got called off of work. WOO HOO!!!>..gotta love the rain, it sometimes comes in at the right times LOL. Today I received acceptance into Mechanical Engineering at McGill, and this left me in a huge problem. I am stuck choosing between McGill or Concordia...Concordia I am guaranteed a spot in electircal, however in McGill I will have to take Mechanical get a 3.4 gpa and transfer to electrical, that requires a HELL of alot of work to do. And I am ready to make the sacrifices in order to get that GPA, however if I do not, I am going to dig a HUGE hole for myself, so I am right now stuck in a tough decision and I do not know what to do, cause McGill carries the name, which is incredible for international affairs. I would really appreciate your ideas and thoughts on what I should do...thanks :)  Well other than that I am trying to deal with the final week of classes and the "nice" work load the teachers left us to take care of due to their lack of organization. We all have a HELL of alot of work to do. Its going to be a fun week right???? :)  For most of us it is our final push before the big leagues. Guys, lets do it. Lets leave Vanier with a BANG. its time to pull off those first semester marks all over again :)....Remember first semester when we were all serious and hard working and stressed because we thought College was strict stuff?.....Well, we sure learned something there...So dudes, good luck to all of you, this is it, the final step. Alright, well its time to go and join my biology book in an evening of phylum memorization.....Here I come Arhtropods and Foriminefora...... :) you gotta love bio, OH YEAH!! OH I forgot, Mo, someone got a call for Electrical co-op this week, and some other people got calls, that is not a good sign for us habibi. I think we should call them on monday and give them a piece of arab mind. :)  Well im leaving  Good bye everyone, and remember, Bhatia is watching you, so be good :)

       Hi Mo,  I am definitely going to the grad. ceremony. You don't have to get awards to go! After all, we need somebody to clap too!! :)) I too have done some serious research in math when I was young. I came to the conclusion that 0 is never equal to 1, even for very big values of 0 and very small values of 1. I had sent my application for the Nobel prize, but they said, whatever you do, you won't be able to get the prize if you're mathematician. That's why I quit math and am doing physics now. And you will have to live with it I guess :).  I heard some people applying for Comp.Sc. have already been called for the interview. Good luck Mo!  And the last thing. Some people think we're pathetic. Well, life is pathetic my friends :). And yes, I happen to be "smart", as you said, to get your email and IP. :)

Too bad he never got the chance to be the Mulanda's...hehehehe!!       Oh yeah, Vlad is right guys, stop the crap about mafia and stuff coz i am very sensible about that and we might get in trouble and all. So who here is going to the graduation ceremony?? I dont think i am going because i did not play chess nor dance so that i can earn an award. However, i believe to be nominated for a nobel prize this summer, so i'm lookin forward for that. Yup! so u wonderin why?? well i prooved why 0! is equal to 1!!       Anyway, i got to go and continue reading this english story!!! Oh and i am still waiting for Concordia to call me for a co-op interview. Please guys and girls, give a prayer to your good friend mr.momo!!  see ya all.. the one and only, aka, momo

The term "vodka" was used herein to substitute the real constituent(s) due to the nature of the audience of this log.  Please note: adult discretion is highly advised. A very open mind is required to read and tolerate this. The administrator is not in any way responsible for your brain falling out due to the excessive openning of your mind. [!] END OF NOTE [!]  Alright People, Listen real carefully. Yes, it is true, Andrei Moskvitch does not exist, his (its) actual name is Podoprigora from former planet KGB (For simplicity, we will stick with the name Andrei). This species of blonde, russian accent beings come from the former planet KGB. The Andreis apparently landed on Earth during 1995-1996. Through extensive research, the only way we were able to come into contact with this unknown type of species, was by using "Vodka" to lure the Andrei's into laboratories for experimentation. While holding a few of the Andreis in the laboratory we conducted many experiments. Dr. Evgueni Chaoulski performed one experiment that astonished many scientists. He used "Vodka" to see the effects alcohol would have on the Andreis. The following results were taken out of Dr. Chaoulski's log: two isomers could be isolated from this particular compound named Andrei CycloMoskvich. Following the Markovnikov's rule, the isomer which demonstrated to be the major product of the reaction was the one bad for the human environment, which [he] called "Bad Andrei". Later on, Dr. Wajdi Al-Hawari conducted experiments in order to see the genetic code for the species of "Bad Andrei". Through many experiments, and using mendelian theories, we found that there was a dominant allele which  gave the species an instant need for "Vodka". However the genotype for the Andreis showed that there was a recessive allele that led to many physical and mental defects when "Vodka" was not present in the system. When given excess "vodka", Andrei became very fatigued and went into hours of sleep. However, he was still in need of "vodka". Dr. Al-Hawari decided to see what kind of physical and mental disabilities would occur after "Vodka" was not put into the system. Andrei became very violent and harmful to the environment. Therefore by using Dr. Evgueni Chaoulski's results, we decided to destroy the Andrei before more damage was done. Finally, we destroyed the major product of the reaction that was bad for the environment, that is why the Andrei CycloMoskvich virus no longer exists. However through the process of destruction a hybrid between the cyclomoskvich and the bacteria used, a new breed of Andrei's was produced. This new breed was called Andrei Moskvich.  Going back, if you recall, there was still a good isomer, that Dr. Chaoulski named "Good Andrei". Which had a dominant allele for "vodka" control. Therefore as you can see, there are now two Andrei's. One of which no longer exists. However, the good Andrei's name, is not Andrei, it is in fact Podoprigora.  Nevertheless, due to its amazing history we still call it Andrei Moskvich. This concludes the "Andrei Moskvich theory".

       Alright, it's about time I put in a comment. What the hell is going on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It seems like this dayly log thing became a subject of disscussing Mr. THE REAL ANDREI MOSKVITCH. I will tell you the truth people, me, the real Evgueni Chaoulski. Andrei Moskvitch does not even exist. At least, not on this planet. It is MOST LIKELY some *******d from another planet. Why you think you're supposed to believe me? Well, that's simple, the real Andrei Moskvitch, if he is really real, should know that KGB no longer exists (got it Andrei's, both of you).   So that's why I'm saying  to you, russian poeple, the following secret code: " lubov zachem ti mouchaesh menia ". And by the way Mr. Momo, you still don't know what the RUSSIAN MAFIA IS. Now that our Godfather is pulled back in, as he said it himself on the site, you people will regret it. Besides, everything else is fine. Have a very good end of the semester everyone

       OK people, listen carefully.  When you press the POST & PUBLISH button, WAIT. It takes about a minute to post. Even if you don't see any immediate response from the browser - wait!  Just in case, before you publish, COPY your useless scrumbles so you don't have to retype everything.   Hey, this guy is getting all angry. I like that!

       Hello everybody!!! NOW LOOK!! This is the REAL Andrei Moskvitch!! And anybody who is going to sabotage or reveal the identity of super-secret-undercover-retiered KGB agent shall get in trouble!!   Man, science freaks! It's been a while that I haven't posted anything! Can you believe it, I'm in McGill library and it's 8:30pm doing my stupid humanities project!! And I'm probably going to stay here till 10:00pm! It' not funny!   BWT, Wajdi, if you found your essay from last year, e-mail it to me, andreim@ureach.com. I'll really appreciate it.   If anyone is interested in becoming a member of rock climbing club, tell me, it's pretty cool, there are hjiking, rock climbig, kayaking, biking etc.   Roman, thanks for the CD and the serials.

       Yeah right Mr. Momo.  C'mon people. Those are all stereotypes.... don't you agree? I mean, what can a 19-year-old science nerd as I am possibly have to do with "mafia"?? Think about it. :) By the way, we have at least one international terrorist here. He has that really long name: "I AM THE REAL ANDREI MOSKVITCH". Wajdi, I might need your help someday. Keep in touch.

He is a master chess player and russian roulette player.  So where is Andrei? who knows...............

        to iLya N  Canada is quite a rich country but its crime rate is not as high as , let's say Jamaica. whatever you say crime doesnt occur in places where money grows but in places where reside a lot of uneducated and poor people. I mean Harvard and Yale, just to name some, are the wealthiest institutions. How come there names are not on that list ?Its because people there have moral values. I mean I am pretty darn sure that students that afford to go there have laptops galore! . Anyway I just wanted to demonstrate that big universties actually protect students from their own mediocrity. Phhbbt! We're all doomed anywayz.    2 russo russo  ya sure im up, tell date and time, ill try to make it, I hope more people join too.

       Hey guys, waza? crime?, I actually agree with Tygon, !!! it is not proportional more wealth != more stealling, it is human values no?  changing topic, a frien of mine is trying to organize a go out to a paint ball game, price? it is $20 for the equipment for as long as u stay and $0.07per bullet so if any of you is interested let me know, I really wanna go and kill some of you there hahaha! I have to mention that these prices are pretty cheap so think about it, ok!

       Vlad I think ur wrong, theft doesnt occur more in places with more money but often in places which are very poor. Correct me if i am wrong but there are much more thefts and burglaries in countries such as 3rd world countries than Canada or the US. I think the reason why there is theft is some places and not in others is because the people there do not carry the intrinsic values of personal goods. thats my two cents.

       I think the rate of laptop stealing is approx. the same everywhere, but much more students have laptops at such universities as MIT (the best engineering school in the world), than, say, at Concordia. Therefore, more of the laptops are being stolen. Correct me if I'm wrong.  Yeah, in case you want to see some  urlLink  grad pics  ... There are a few. The rest will be up as soon as I get them reprinted at some legitimate place.

I got a $0.5-per-hour raise my very first day. Besides, there are like four male persons out of about 20 people. I guess I'll spend the rest of the summer there... helping the ladies get their stuff organized... ;o)

       Hey TyGoN! What are you doing in Toronto? By the way, it's raining in Montreal. The heat is gone for good. No, that's not my car... not yet anyway :o).  Wajdi, I don't know why, but I find your posts very amusing. Keep them up! As for doing something, I'm all for it! How about tomorrow? We could go for a movie or just a beer somewhere... I'll try to get in touch with everybody. 'night  P.S. Here's what I ran into today (by accident, I swear!). It seems to be common sense, and I wonder how many years of research it took to just reinforce the common perception.   Physical attractiveness is a powerful personal reinforcement (by means of socialization in the relationship) and a powerful social reinforcement, due to the high importance socially attached to this characteristic, even though it is not often acknowledged. A partner much more attractive than oneself could involve a series of additional costs and additional effort in both starting and maintaining the relationship. Similarly, a much less attractive partner involves a high cost (or a deficit in rewards, at least in physical appearance), for which reason either the partner is not chosen, or else is chosen at the cost of an increase in the PPAO, as suggested by the cognitive dissonance perspective...

       What? Wajdi's back here? Oh my LORD. No, I'm gonna quit posting now. So Dr. Al-Hawari, how are you doing? So, you say the fireworks were fun, what do you think Vlad and Andrei? Did you guys enjoy them just as much as Wajdi did? So, as Vlad said, it's fun to see that many of you are back on the site, because my fingers were getting tired ( I meant tired from typing). So, Vlad you're going to summer school, well, jion the happy club of "summerschoolers". Anyway poeple, I don't have much to say besides the usual stuff like school, dancing, work, girls and party (man that's quite a lot actually). So, I hope you are all doing great and are ready for something big to happen some time in July when we all finish summer school (or more likely, some of us). I don't know what yet, but TRUST me. So, boys and girls, be good and listen to mom and dad. See yuo all later. (huggs and kisses)

       Hey guys. IM BACK the master of nonsense has returned to tell you about ALL THE NOTHING I have been doing. :) I saw some of you at the fireworks the other day. How did you guys find it? It was not that bad. But I have seen better. So how is everyone doing? How is the summer going with you people? Everything good? Did anyone register for classes at mcgill/concordia? Im sort of worried because I dont know the teachers names. So I have to register risking the chance of getting a bhatia :) ALRIGHT...BHATIA ALL THE WAY!!!!!!!!!!!!(note: before you decide to shoot me for that last comment, I was being sarcastic) Hey dudes, you wanna do something soon? Would be cool to do something. Im keeping myself busy studying for Cowan's next exam. ITs all good. THe class is pretty interesting, but what we are doing now is so boring. Waves is zzzzzzzzzzz........Especially wave optics...GOOD GOD........I quit Dairy Queen. So Vlad it looks like we both left the food industry and we both will not be getting free food anymore. Aw well, it was a good sacrifice. I just could not deal with those annoying customers who seemed like they were being stupid on purpose. THe worst thing is....the people who serve us at various places probably say the same thing about us. Its a strange twisted cycle. :) Well guys, I have to go, I have people, need to show my respect and get off the net. Just wanted to put a message up to say hello.  l8er people

Well, there lot's of new stuff going on, and I'm for the get together you guyes are planning but cann't set up. I'm for the pool. I'm also for the rock climbing. Audrey, can you please tell me when are you at home because I called you lots of times and so far it has been useless. :/. Jeka, I'm free on the 29th, but I think we'd have to call everybody sinse they don't come to this site anymore.   What else? Well, I'm working, having fun, having some creazy ideas about some creazy stuff...as usual; always smiling (hope you people are too), and I expecting to have almost $0.01 in my bank account for various reasons :)).   PS if you care, I'm going to have a cold (I think). So good bye, luv you all, and Audrey call me please, thanks.  yours

       Thank you Audrey and Vlad for your congradulations. Vlad, I would also like to congratulate you too for  your " Alan Liddiaard Memorial Scholarship". What a name for an award. Btw, Vlad I have an idea where to go for your birthday, it's a nice camping place. Audrey, I don't think that the big pool thing that we wanted to make is going to happen before the month of July, unless everyone is free on friday June 29th. I'll try to let you know more precisely. In the mean time, it would be fun to at least go for a swim.. So peace guys, and see you soon.

       Mais, merci beaucoup Audrey! I was cool, although quite bureaucratic, as all the official ceremonies. Congrads to Andrei and Evgueni with their student life awards!  After the ceremony, we went to the Old Port, then to the Peel Pub. There were many people from Vanier, grads and not only. So, we drank beer until 3 AM. Got home at around 4:30. I'll be posting a lot of grad pictures as soon as I get the film developped. By the way, I've started putting up my old high school pics  urlLink  here  , if you're interested.  Then, yesterday there was another party at "Cirque du Soleil". Free food (unlimited) and free drinks (3 items). It was quite an experience. Everybody was so... different. It's not my crowd, but I enjoyed being there very much.   Audrey, pool sounds great. I'm free after 4 PM any day, except tomorrow.

       So, how's everybody feeling about the whole thing?  Personally, I don't really care. These two years went by so fast and seem to be so meaningless that I can't even make up my mind about what I am supposed to feel right now.   Time to name "champions", I guess. I have reasons to assume that this blog is regularly read by a few Vanier teachers. That notwithstanding, I would like to express my personal opinion about the courses I took and instructors I had pleasure to be taught by during these blissful years of our collegial studies. Alright then. Courses. The...  ...  most boring : World Views - East and West (Daniel Tomas). ...  most useless  : General Biology (Ernst Bleichert). ...  easiest : Photography (Pat Masterson). ...  intrinsically good : Ethical Choices (Michael Dandy-Smith). ...  hardest  (aka "good stuff"): Calculus III (Gerry Pacholke). ...  smallest amount of studying : Calculus I (Steve Papadakis); Linear Algebra I (David Gates). ...  simply the best : Mechanics (Don Hetherington; Electricity & Magnetism (S. Mahajan); Statics & Engineering Physics (Mike Cowan); English (Pat Tedford); Ethical Choices (M. Danby-Smith)  See you at the grad.

       Alright guys. What do you think we should do on Thursday night? If you people have an idea for some kind of an after grad thing, don't hesitate to share with everybody. How about going to some quiet place and have a nice drink (someone's house perhaps)? Btw, Tygon and Vladster, what happenned to everyone else, where are they? Wajdi, Andrei, Sarah, Audrey, etc. What's up guys? I haven't seen you in  a while. I hope you're all doing great. For some of you see you on thursday, others, see you sometime soon.

       Hey TyGoN. We were in the old port on Thursday at about 10 pm. I was there on Saturday night as well. I bought a sugar and a chocolate beaver tails and LOTS of icecream, but I never saw you! Do you work there or are you just consumming the tails under the counter? I got a letter in the mail with the confirmation form that I will the attending the ceremony. I brought it back to them on about June 6. We have to come to college tomorrow to pick up our gowns and tickets. I hope it helps.  Evgueni, all that sounds great. You seem to be one of those actually having a time of their life :).   I have had three job interviews today and have been explicitly promissed two jobs. It's mostly boring clerical office stuff, but it's still much better than what I have now. I hope they'll call back.   I have an idea. Who wants to go Alberta to plant trees? They pay $200-300 per day. Yes, it's hard, but we're men aren't we? I'm sure it's a lot of fun, good workout and a nice tan.   Alright, I'll see you guys day after tomorrow.

       Prety cool Vlad. So how was your week-end, everyone? Mine was pretty cool. As some of you already know I spent Thursday night in the old port. Friday was pretty borring though. Can you believe it guys? I studied Physics all day (and I really mean it). Saturday was another marathon: I was  working 12 hours straight, from 10 to 10. Imagine, "welcome to the royal bank visa..." for twelve hours. Finally, Sunday was a big reward for all the hard work that I've done last week-end. It was my dance school's annual graduation ball. You know what i mean when I say that. My partner and I were the best perfomers of the evening ( sorry for my modesty), after the performance i was enjoying the female entourage (some of them are quite nice btw and they're not all that old) and i was also swiming in the fine waters of the open bar of the reception hall. Right on the day before my exam. Cool, don't you find? So that's about it for my nice little week-end.  I hope everyone is doing good. If you have a chance, share your news too. see you all.  P.S. Countdown: 3 and a half days before grad. Get ready to party.

       Updates anyone? Hello. It's me. First off,  urlLink  this site   definitely has something to it.  It's about time for another short-handed movie review. Yesterday I watched "Swordfish". I recomend you do so too. It's good stuff, although the plot is a bit confusing. The central idea, as I see it, is the utilitarian approach to international terrorism. The whole thing is centered on the cheesiest incarnation of the  idea of protecting the american way of life.   The movie is worth seeing at least because of the brilliant John Travolta's acting. I love this guy.

       Hey everyone. Well, what can I say? There are no updates so far. I am in some kind of a hovering state, half asleep lately. I like it pretty much though. It's like being stoned every day. Slowly getting used to not worrying about tests, labs and that sort of stuff (as if I ever did worry about that :).  In short: working, listening to DMX and Chilli Peppers, watching movies, eating a lot of junk, but, hey!, running every morning. OK, OK, starting tomorrow... :) And, yeah, did I mention becoming more and more arrogant every day?   OK, have to go now. See some of you tonight and the rest of you someday soon.  Have a nice one.

       Hey Vlad, Centre-ville where,in what? stripbars?....  Anyway where i work we offer pieces of death. I dunno why people have to suicide in Quebec. all they gotta go is to come eat out hypercholesterolated-heart-blocking-heavycalorified food. Im telling you, we bring it right out of the thick running oil which is still dripping mind you, and then apply the fattiest substances on this God given earth, and people wait almost 30 minutes in line and pay the price, 4 dollars for one beaver tail!! But I have to admit and so will others that it is so good!!!!!!!!  Hmmm....chocolat....husjghfkshg...(im drooling). Howz everybdy else doin? did u guys get the english exit result back?? i got nothing back. maybe i gotta call em or something.  anyway im out   peace

       You know Vlad, I'm very happy you're refiguring your whole life plan, but competition is a dirty business. I'm sure you know it just as well as I do. Even though I like competition, I wouldn't want to compete with you. Btw, speaking of Centre Ville, that's where I work as well. So tell me when you're working, I may pass by. I'm not going to say anything else for know, I have to go to bed.  So good night to everyone and have a nice day tomorrow.

       Oh, no. I'm not messing with you man. There is no point in doing so, is there? I don't feel bad and lonely either.   Speaking of inspiration, I am in the process of refiguring (!) my whole life plan. Indeed, working in Centre Ville (shuuut �p!!!) makes me think differently about my objectives. I haven't come to any clear conclusion yet, but I'm beginning to think we might compete for the same job one day, Mr. Viva Dedic (of course I don't mean dancing!). Whatever it makes you think about my dear friend, I am not messing with you... not yet anyway.   Yours truly,

You know it would be nice to hear from a friend sometime, especially when he is back from NYC. Anyways, this was another borring day of stupid summer school (don't you people laugh at me while reading this). So if anyone of you feels bad or lonely on one of those "nice", "sunny" and "hot" summer days, just give me a buzz and we'll complain together. How fun, don't you think? Sorry for complaining guys, but I just had a little bit of inspiration. Take care, poeple.

       Wuzzup yo. Yeah man, "we're gonna rock this town alive" on June 14th. Dear Tygon, it may be kind of late for me to tell you this, but it's okay to have failed a course. Don't let yourself feel depressed, just remember "life is a b..ch and then you die" (just kidding). Anyhow, whoever you are, vladster, tygon, chessmaster (NYC guy) or even Wajdi, just take out the old suit that you wore at high school graduation and start ironing it. Because, after June 14th, you won't see it for the next 3 or 4 years. So be positive people and let the "fun stuff" begin. See ya brothas

Not too much of a plot, but a lot of F1 fun. Pretty cool movie. And, oh yeah, I'm not the first one who happens to LOVE Guzzo's seats. You just dissolve yourself in there for good two hours. It's a very important constituent of enjoying the movie..

       Hey everyone,  Vlad sorry about the non-paragraphing message. I agree with what you said, I would of been pretty annoyed with it myself. its all good :)  Im going to be going to the radiohead concert this sunday, I am really excited about it. I cant wait to go. I hope they play some songs from their older albums.  Does anyone here listen to radiohead at all? Well nothing new here in the wonderful word of web making.   I just made some additions and editions to the site that the prof wanted me to make. Now I am sitting here listening to the voice of Thom Yorke typing on the keyboard, constantly checking my mail to see when the documents will come in from the prof. telling me what else I have to do on the site. For now the only thing I have to do is nothing.  Alright well it looks like I am going ot have to be going to run some experiments on the reactor downstairs. Finally something to do. Well guys Talk to you later. bye bye

       Comments........ Waj, I agree & disagree with the song, I mean we are being controlled by technology but we are not there yet, not totally till we heve to work to get the technology improved........ and about the centering your images try absolute positioning and giving it coordinate to where you whant the layer with the image, this might not work in netscape, but it is worth riying, you know te sintax for layers possitioning, don't you?  And the beloved Vlad, Tell me something who the hell writes words such as "mumu" or "bdsm" what does it mean any othe these? and also google generates automatic pages almost every time, so when I triedad the blog was not even close!!! and about the words such as "prety young" tell the truth you tiped that cuz u were looking for pretty and young girls right!!!  anywayz........... c ya soon

       Hey Waj, no, you don't irritate anybody! However, would you please divide your posts into paragraphs somehow? It is SO hard to read a cloud of text like that. I hate to be annoying, but... anyway.   I totally agree with you about the song though. I often think about things like that, but rarely say them aloud due to being afraid to look silly. You, know, most people are quite dull (yeah, whatever, call me arrogant, but you surely agree with me deep inside, I know), and the last thing you want is to look silly in dull people's eyes.

       Hello Boys and Girls.  WHAT IS UP!!!!???? Really? that is interesting. Im listening to this song from Radiohead called "My Iron Lung" and there is this one line that stands out that reminded me of something, "when the power goes out we'll just hum". I remember being in a radiohead chat a few months ago and people were talking about this song, "My Iron Lung" and we all figured out that it was a song about how technology controls us and how without it we are nothing, we just sit there "humming" waiting for something to happen, waiting for the "machine" to do something to save us. No one does anything on their own anymore. "when the power goes out we'll just hum"...it explains itself....alright ill stop now.....Sometimes I just get in the mood to analyze songs and bash society, I do it alot and dont share it alot, anyway back to normal Wajdi.....how is everyone doing? Someone fell for the virus here at McGill and since everyone here is connected through the server, ALOT of computers are getting it and guess who got it as well? yes yours truly.....WAJDI!!!! Thank you....thank you, no need for aplause, thank you very much.....Well I just needed to take a little break editing the site and thought I will see how the guys are doing, I see Igar is having some fun being confused heheheeh :) Umm I have another question (hope im not irritating anyone with these questions, sorry if I am)....I made an image that will not center properly. It is basically the title of the site but its a gif and the thing is I cannot center it properly even by using HTML or MS.....anyone know what is going on? Oh I should mention that on some computers the alignment is fine, but my computer and another one have weird alignment.....alright back to work. Bye guys :) have fun :)

I really appreciate it. I am guessing that is a java script because of the onclick command right? I will figure it out. Thanks alot :). So Igar what are you talking about this Jerry Springer thing?

       OK, Waj, here's the trick. Include  onclick="top.close();"  into the tag when targeting the link back to your initial window. The active window will try to close. However, some paranoid  browsers may ask if the the user wants to close the window. Secondly, I am completely unaware what will happen in Nescrape (but who cares anyway).  I hope that helps. And, no, you are not required to credit me in any way. Have fun.

       Hey Waj,  I didn't really understood ur question but from what I got I can ask u that how r u going back to the other page if it is by an url link then the solution to ur problem should be a simple javascript that plays with the history it is something like  onclick history(-1)  the exact spelling i do not have it on me right now but can be found if requested ;-), man I am gonna exige partial credits on ur site hehehe, a simple tag such as "powered by IPASystems" hehehe ok so if u think that the java script might help tell me I have it at home c ya, what was the url of the site u r working on again?

       Hey guys whats up. How are things. Good? Im having fun here using that HTML. Today I was made fun of because I do the coding all myself. I think the fun part about the website is programming and writing out the code. So I was convinced to use a web designer. However I did not want all the coding to go to waste. So what I did is that I wrote out a basic layout for the site and then used MS to just edit and make it look pretty. Nothing special. Ummm I had a question though. One of my links opens a new window. However there is a link in that new window to go back to a previous page how can I automatically close that window so the new one will appear right away instead of having to click on the new page. Thanks for the help :) Time to get back to the fun. bye bye

       Hey, yeah, sorry Igar, I can't go. You're totally right about frames. No one likes them anymore. No one ever liked them.   Frames is a nice idea technically, but they conflict with human intuition. That's where one looses in usability. We (humans) are still into papers, books etc. And when you read printed material, you don't expect the table of contents to stay in place when the page is flipped, even though it would seem more convenient. We've been flipping pages for centuries, and it will take awhile to get used to reading from radiating displays.  Kill the frames.

       Hey whats up guys.  Ok, Igar I forgot to answer your question. Here is the answer. The professor in the Wong building is a good friend of my dads, and he asked my dad if I would like to come in to help them out with stuff. So I said yes, and then he made me a research assistant. So now I am here being a research assistant, making websites, drawing reactors and conducting experiments. That is the low down on my job. good? good. I have a question to ask to people going to Concordia. After we register for our classes what is left to be done? or do we just wait for that orientation at the end of August? Btw, guys, I found 5 mullets when I was at La Ronde on saturday. If you guys do not know what a mullet is go to   urlLink Mullets Galore  Its really funny :) I think mullets are funny looking people. If they just did something about that hair, maybe they would actually be considered normal. Those mullets. Funny little people. Well guys, its time to get to work, have a nice day and watch out, there are going to be fireworks tonight :) hehehe :)

       Waza, Waj tired, hehehe, yep u got the answer right u just target the links from one frame to another or from one frame to itself nothing from the other world, if any other questions feel free to ask, but why r u using frames? frames suck and suck badly suck so much that no one likes them aymore!!! ok but if that is the only way well good lucck, and u still havent told me how did u find the job.  Now, Vlad, man thanx for not providing me with any answer about the canoe-camping thing, now is too late, but still don't I deserve just a "sorry man, can not go" man, that is kinda rude u know..............  Next, Andrei you pimp, now u r doing 11 years old boys, man, tah is pervertion at it's maximum!!!!!!!!!!!

       Andrei? What's wrong with the background?  We called the guy yesterday. He doesn't know yet. I'll call him next week again. It will most likely work out, but I can't commit to the contract until I'm sure. Hope you understand.

       Hey guys.  Sorry I have not posted anything in a while. Been pretty busy these past few days. Ummm I just had a sudden case of amnesia with HTML and I forgot how to use frame commands. Igar, is there anyway you can help me out. I got pretty frustarated when I forgot and now I am so frustrated I dont want to think. I am trying to get a link to open up the page on the frame opposing it instead of in the same frame. What I mean is that i want one frame to stay the same and the other one to change. Know what I mean? Sorry for the dumb question. I just completely forgot how to do it. Anyone here interested in fishing??? I went last year with a few of my friends, it was pretty fun. Well I should get back to work. I need to try to get this thing to work. Bye bye :)

       Hello Ladies and Gentlemen! Nice layout Vlad, the back ground is quite original.  By the way, for all who thought that I won't be able to stay single for more then two days, well, it's been a week...it's pretty sad. And I'm not really planning to get into any relationship within next one or two days either. Later everything is possible :)   Ah, yeah, feel like sharing, I'm deaf on my left ear. And it's not a joke. I hope it will be better by the end of this week; and I'm also covered in scratches and brouses. Don't ask why and how...I work in a Camp...   You guys want to do something Friday or Sunday night?  BTW, VLAD, the Cirque has a party this Friday, and the person responsible for the actors will be there, forgot his name. I might go there for like an hour or something; come also, you can talk him there.  All right, I'm out, have to get back to work ( a group of 28 eleven-year-old boys). hehe the funnest age ever!! (Gosh) Bye Bye.

Thank you for your kind attention.  Seriously, let's all honestly take the test and paste the results into the blog (they give you the code in the end). I found it very interesting.

       Ok guys. I know it's a little late to anounce this, but if you can makeit it would be fun. Today, we're having a little BBQ party at Audrey's house. Feel free to come. It's at 457 Springfield, corner of Maple, in Greenfield Park (south shore). You have to go to Longueuil metro and take bus #15. So come if you feel like it. It's around 5 or 6 pm today. Any questions, call me at (450)651-9390 or Audrey at (514)923-0055. Once again, sorry for the late notice, it was not for sure before.

       Hey whats up guys,  Andrei Congratulations on the tournament, way to go :) Ummm Igar no more stealing IP's hehe :). The adress for the site I am working on is ( I hope I can code in HTML on blogger, here we go:   urlLink  Minmet    I still did not touch the website, this is what is left from the last guy who played around with it. I am still waiting for the password so that I can start editing the site. I have alot of work to do. Igar thanks for the url to check out the 3d tour. I want to learn how to code that, it would be awesome :) Well guys its time to leave now I am getting pretty tired and I had a looooooong day sitting on the couch playing Gran Turismo 3 with my neighbour. Yes it was hard winning the clubman circuit, but guys we did it in the little Miata after we riced it up to 291 horse power grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.........oh btw Vlad, ummm Z3?????????????? you lucky bastard, how? must of been a realy nice ride :) Alright guys, goodnight

       Wassup everybody!? I got back from the tourney this tuesday. It was pretty fun, I tied for 57th place in the open section ( the highest) out of 228 people. I finished 5/9 (3 wins, 4 draws, and 2 loses). And now I'm damn tiered since I worked all week starting the day I came.   Congradulations on graduating guys!! I'd say we can pull off a party this week-end. :)  Vlad, depends for what and for whom you want the perfume.  What's the address of the site you're working on Waj?   Alright, bye, bye

       Thanks Waj. That's what I chose too. Coming back to your comment about 3D tour,  urlLink  Carleton   has one. Although the U itself isn't the best around, they got one of the most user-friendly websites I've seen.  To Igar: I would assume that the kind of jobs that Wajdi has is not found by faxing a CV :)). And stop looking up people's IP's through my stats! :)) Igar, don't take everything I say personally. I like you (not this way, f*ckin' pervert!) but it's just way too funny to tease you time after time!  OK guys, listen to this. It happened today at 8:30 AM. I am sitting in the office minding my own business (actually, playing minesweeper) looking blankly at the screen and trying hard to remain unnoticed by my omnipresent boss for a little longer. Suddenly, I notice a poetically fearful and divinely proportional, Nikita-like silhouette in the ugly white door frame. Into the room SHE comes. I can feel the smell of an expensive perfume rushing into my nose and my heart rate blasting off to the outer limits of the mesosphere...  I am trying to say "good morning", but all I can pronounce at the moment is a rather unintelligible sound resembling the belching of an awakening rhinoceros, which she, apparently, likes. SHE comes closer, (oh god!) TOUCHES THE BACK OF MY monitor and says: "Vlad, your monitor is HOT..." I feel my back sweating like hell, and my whole body is starting to shake. Soon, I realize that I'm shaking so hard that the chair that I sit on is beginning to creak. No, this can't be happening! I turn around and see my boss shaking the chair behind me and yelling "Wake up!". I look back, SHE is gone!!! Oh no, it was a dream.  Well... not really. I got a ride to the metro in a Z3 after work. But, f*ck!!! She is like... 27. Again! No, there won't be any of it this time. Promise. Besides, I'm still confused about my feelings for some other person. Pathetic as it is, I just felt like sharing.

       Party sounds good Just tell me a few days in advanced so I can get the night off guaranteed :) I am here at mcgill looking through the website to see what kind of changes have to be done. I have to redisgn the site completely and give it a new look. should be fun to get my hands back into html. Im thinking about adding some java to it. Or making a crazy aplet to allow people to take a 3d tour of the facility. That would be sooooo sweet. I think im getting a little out of my league here with that aplet idea :). Im really happy here. Its a nice job. I get a beautiful computer the room has ac the people are nice and the hours are very flexible. and its fun, cause its what I want to do. Not only that I get to listen to my MD at the same time so I dont get bored :) Listening to my Md right now, niiiice music :) Gotta love radiohead :). I am right now alternating between making the comments about the site and writing on the blog. I started writing this message like 10 minutes ago. I dont know how long I am going to make it. If I make it too long that would be pretty boring for people reading it. wouldnt it now? :) Well I am really hungry and it is lunch time and I did alot of work already :) So I think I am going to treat myself to a nice lunch bye guys. oh and please contact me if there is something going on. would love to see you guys soon :)  l8er

       Party sounds good......... let me know,  so, everyone is leaving me fucking alone in Vanier, f. u. guys, what am I gonna do there all by my self??? anywayz one more semester and I am out too.  Vlad, you, it seems to methat you do not know what of a website you really want, my advise is sit and start drawing sketches of what it should look like, of course the final version is nothing as those sketches but just to put an image of what you want in your brain, by the way I am starting to write tutorials on JavaScript on my site, www.ipasyst.com remember, it is kinda advanced programming level, so if you, as you said, know all the basics take a look at it. also theory color is not as important as originality and new ideas, ofcourse you won't put green with ogange, but do not spend as much time in that, it would be better to invest that time is browsing the web and looking what you like, and starto to do something that looks like something that you like, it is not copying it is molding views, as I like to call it, the best site I've ever seen u know it www.ozones.com he has many good ideas in his sits so look at all of them, also u might like goldeneyedesign don't know the url, so relax and if u aint an artist remember this cool phrase that some computer knowledgeable guys repeated from van ghog or picasso,: "Good artists copy, great artists steal"

       Man, so much stuff happened here over the week-end. It seems as if there was war or something. Wajdi, I feel so sorry that you got burned. It must hurt a lot, right. Well, look, if you never got cheated on, there is certainly someone to take care of you. Andrei, how are you doing? I saw your sister in the metro today. She told me that you're like in the first 80 or something. Alright man, I hope you won something. Btw, Wajdi, it's true that summer school is almost over. Don't you feel like partying (actually I do it every day anyway). Listen up everyone, soon we're gonna all do something. If Audrey has a chance to read this, please call me. How do guys like the weather lately? Nice, don't you think? Alright, my last exam is on Wednesday and I need about 33% to pass. I think it's gonna be "tough". Ok, I'll shut up, nothing else to say. See you all soon.

       Wassup guys? How is it going? I'm not really following the conversation here... Did Waj get cheated on?? or something? What the hell? I need some more explanation, or Waj if you need some help, well, you know, the "russian trio"... :)  By the way, the tourney sort of sucks so far, you can follow it on www.worldopen.com  I have 3/5 with 4 rounds to go, and I'm getting  sick (I think). What esle? Everything else is fine if you know what I mean. Today I've cut a watermelon with plastic knife :) And if anyone wants a pic of my g-f, well, I can show it to you Faisal if you really want.   Anyway, take care people and wish me luck.  Good bye.

       Russo: So far, I've been blessed. I've never cheated and have never been cheated on.I would like it to stay this way as long as possible. Thanks for the advice about spylog. I don't really need coordinates. I use Dreamweaver, forgot? :) Anyway, I like the new system better.   Rape Vlad  ??? C'mon baby, you don't have to be so rude... just ask... ;o)  You're not right about Wajdi though, It f*ckin' sucks to be him! Poor guy's having so much trouble with that rotten cheese and whole wheat bread...! Don't they pay him enough at McGill to buy some food? If so, man, call me, I'll get you a better place. :)

       Alright im mad, I just wrote a blog and then all of a sudden what happens? It all gets erased. and I had a whole paragraph about nothing too. Aw well. Im writing from mcgill right now. I am going to leave soon so I can catch the train to get to class. Only three more classes left and its all over :) soon my time at summer school will be replaced with time spent at mcgill. a fair trade :) You know what I feel like doing? Playing a trick on someone like they do on spy tv. Like this one episode where this guys friends played a trick on him by getting him arrested for shop lifting. It was hilarious :) we should try that one day. what do you think? I actually slept at 12 last night, for the first time in like 2 months. Pretty interesting eh? You know what really pisses me off though? rotten cheese in a fridge. When you are hungry and you feel like having a cheese sandwich and you go to make yourself this cheese sandwich, but there is this HUGE WHITE piece of mold, sometimes green that grows on that food you have been craving for the past 10 minutes...SO NOW WHAT???? only one solution left...put on my shoes and go to the supermarket to buy cheese, because when I want my cheese I get my cheese dammit. So when I get back, I find that there is only whole wheat bread.......WHOLE WHEAT!!!!!!!! whats up with that??? I dont want no healthy food...I want my bread without the healthy stuff, I want it white. Alright so that is enough complaining for me for one day. I have to get going now so I can go catch my train and get to class, maybe on my way I can stop by my house and make myself a sandwich :) Alright guys. its been fun talking about nothing for one day See you soon :)

       Yeah, I heard a dozen versions of this story over a couple of years, and what I want to say is that the guy must be pretty dumb. First of all, bride's parents have nothing to do with their daughter being unfaithful to her boyfriend... nor do all those people who came to the wedding. He humiliated himself in front of 300 friends and relatives and gained a reputation of a looser. He must've looked so pathetic I would laugh my ass off.   I'm sorry, it's bad, but I feel no compassion for these guys. I think it's your fault if your girlfriend cheats on you. It is your fault either because you aren't "good enough" (not necessarily sexually!) or because you let a b!tch be by your side.

          Read this: Below is a true story about a recent wedding that took place at  Clemson University:   This was a huge wedding with about 300 guests. After the wedding, at the reception, the groom got up on stage at the microphone to talk to the crowd. He said that he wanted to thank everyone for coming, many from long distances, to support them at their wedding. He especially wanted to thank the bride's and groom's families for coming and to thank his new father-in-law for providing such a fabulous reception.   To thank everyone for coming and bringing gifts and everything, he said he wanted to give everyone a special gift from just him. So taped to the bottom of everyone's chair was a manila envelope, including the wedding party. He said that this was his gift to everyone, and told everyone to open the envelopes.   Inside each manila envelope was an 8x10 picture of his best man having sex with the bride. He had gotten suspicious of the two of them and hired a private detective to trail them weeks prior to the wedding. After he stood there and watched the people's reactions for a couple of minutes, he turned to the best man and said "F--- you", he turned to the bride and said "F--- you", and then he turned to the dumbfounded crowd and said "I'm out of here."   He had the marriage annulled first thing that Monday morning. While most of us would have broken off the engagement immediately after finding out about the affair, this guy goes through with it anyway as if nothing was wrong.   His revenge: Making the bride's parents pay over $32,000 for 300 guest wedding and reception. Letting everyone know exactly what did happen. And best of all, trashing the bride's and best man's reputations in front of all of their friends, their entire families i.e. their parents, brothers, sisters, grandparents, nieces and nephews, etc.   This guy has balls the size of church bells.    ---------------------------------------------------   and evgeni ur the salsa dude

Just  urlLink  let me know  . We want some kinky stuff to rage about :)).  Russo, there was no birthday party so far. I was thinking about doing something in two weeks. I'll let you guys know.  Jeka, nice nick... hm! People, I've got an idea. Send to me a picture of something representing you in some way. It could be anything from a 3D tetracycline model (TyGoN) to shampoo (Russo). I'll put it onto this page. Send all you've got to vlad@vladster.net.  Blog stats for June: posts = 56; words = 4,979; characters = 27,748; point = none :)

       Well, well, well. Hello Annie. It's about time we communicate with you a little bit too. Andrei told us about you and we are very anxious to find out who you are. So tell me how's NYC? Is it like really cool? Because I'm planning on going this summer. Anyway, I won't keep too buzy reading it, go take care of Andrei. Can you please make sure he wins the championship, or else we won't take him back to Montreal. So HUGS and KISSES Annie, and hope to meet you one day (Andrei don't get mad). So how's everyone else doing? Now, Mr. Russo, what's with the Paint Ball all the time? Don't tell me it's that much fun. Guys, summer school is almost over and I'm feeling great about it. Wajdi, don't you think so. So take care everyone and I'll see you all soon.  P.S. I have a new nick name, try to guess who I am (I hope it's not to hard).

       Hey russo, Thanks for the advice and stuff. I appreciate it. I guess I would be very worried if you liked the layout :). I'm fine with this one for the time being. I like black'n'white.   There is Paintball next to the Guzzo movie theater across the street from the Place Vertu. Been there a couple of times. I'm not really fond of this stuff. I don't know about the rest of the crowd, but I'm not in, sorry.  'night.  P.S. Igar, next time you post, press TEAM -> EDIT MY PROFILE, and enter your nickname please.

       The thing you found, Faisal, is the Electrical Engineering program rankings only. The link on the bottom of the page will take you to the overall rankings.   Yes, I'm sure the guy just wanted us to feel proud of ourselves.   As for med schools, it's very simple. Med people usually apply to all the schools there exist. Thus, if the applicant is good, she gets 2 or even 3 admission offers from different institutions. Therefore, for a given number of universities, there are much more admission offers than actual freshmen. You can even calculate the number of offers per applicant from those tables.

         i found  urlLink  something   by the same ranking and Concordia's 23 instead of 25 and Mcgill is 2 instead of 1.  I wonder...    One more thing I find unbelievable.  Check  urlLink  this   out, go all the way down. Look at the table where it mentions   offers and places filled  . The number of applicants is about  10 times  the number of places offered but then why is the number of places filled smaller than the number offered !!!!   In some places only  half of the places  are filled!!!!  Someone explain to me please cuz i'm gonna crack!!!!   One more thing....   "first time ever in history this year  the grade requirements for admission into ECE at McGill were higher than those needed to get into Medicine "  T he Engineering may be the best in Canada, but it will never surpass the requirements for Medecine. Last I checked people with CRC of 34 and average of 90 have not been allowed in Medecine, but others with CRC 29 and marks 80-85 have been. I think the guy just wanted to incite you guys.  anywayz have fun. I'm sure I will.   peace im out

Let me try this one: I guess they couldn't handle the intellectual intensity of our elevated conversations. :)) I hope this will get the scarce female population of this blog furious.  To those of you who don't know what nurse Roman and I are talking about. The Nurse is a girl we worked with in a camp last summer. She was a very hot nurse assistant. I was hm... a little head-over-hills with her (as well as most of the male contingent of the camp). She wouldn't even look at me. Well... that was not entirely true. I just fucked up the whole thing though. As always. But it's funny stuff to remember.  Cheers,

       Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. The National Capital is online. Well. ..Well...well... Who is responsible for this blog? Does Vlad still run it, or is it someone else now? Whoever you are, post a UofO banner on the friends page, so to reflect the fact of my long awaited admission.   And..I always wanted to know who is Faisal. Evgeni, Andrei, and Vlad tried to explain me, but I still don't know who the hell is he. Faisal, do I know you ?  I really want to say this : It seems that we, or at least just I, are really obsessed with rankings and all that :) What I think, it's only you who makes it, of course name and reputation of the school helps, but still, it's pretty much yourself who has to work to succed.   I feel obliged to inform u guys, girls in Hull are really good looking, as for Ottawa chicks they are soooo ugly and fat. (well, most of them). I can't believe that THE NURSE was actually from Ottawa.

       Well, Faisal, I must admit I agree that such universities as Duquesnes build a strong character. The main reason of the institution being highly religious is to reinforce discipline, both mental and physical. And that's a very good thing. The disadvantage here is that it affixes a permanent seal onto the students' views.  Off subject, here's something quite scary I ran into recently.  urlLink Are you ready to start deteriorating?

       Yes, yes, yes. I'm back on the blog for today guys. Missed me? So why is Andrei crying alone? Why don't we all get together sometime to drink and cry before school starts? As Andrei said, there must be a lot of things said about the summer. I know Vlad was proposing something for tonight. So I hope to hear from you guys. Later people

       Well I am back in Canada. Actually I am in Toronto in another freind's house. And I have a lot to tell you about Pittsburgh, my freinds. I visited about every University in Pennsylvania. There are three of them. There is Duquesnes that I have told you about. And there is Pittsburgh University and Carnagie Mellon University. Carnagie Mellon very recently was ranked first in United States for Computer related sciences. That includes the engineering component as well.   Pittsburgh University is an overall good university. I looked at its structures and was amazed by its interior. It is very similar to a cathedral. I have taken numerous pictures of it and will post them up very soon.   Duquesnes on the other hand is very modern. Its infrastructure is late last century glass building design. I have already mentioned to you about the eductaion system and was quite amazed about their science program. They do not have a diverse science program such as Concordia or McGill. What struck me as funny is that they are proud that their University builds character !!!   On a brief note, I was very impressed by the history that resides in the Pittsburgh University buildings. Wait till you see them. They look more like cathedral towers and curches than schools.     Anywayz I will post up soon.  P.s: Why is Andrei crying. tell me all about it. Have I missed something?    Im out  peace

       Hello everybody, long time no writing. So much stuff to tell, so many stories had happened this summer. Well, it's not over yet. I'm at Vanier College right now. I can't belive it. It feels so weired, all these....kids.... :-0. hehe. Sorry, I'm just being mean. Anyway, school starts in a week guys, ahhhh, now it's time for drinking and crying :p .   Who is going to Evgueni's danse party  today at 9:00 on metro beaubien on St-Hubert street at his danse school? I am.   Have fun guys, I'm heading home.

       Hi again.  I'm totally bored. Evgueni just called. He and Andrei are drinking vodka there alone. Andrei is drinking and crying; Evgueni is keeping a company; I here blog and feel compassionate.  Been readin' thru  urlLink old stuff  lately (remember to read bottom-to-top). Youth, spring, love... I don't like the way it all came to an end (oh, did it ever begin). I think I've been misunderstood. I think I had misunderstood myself. Sorry?

       Yeah, I'm getting pretty interested in robotics, especially things like Canadarm on ISS. You're right, I should've got involved at Vanier, but I didn't quite appreciate some of the people there (none of you guys on this blog). What I saw from outside was a lot of pompous talks and very little real action. I might've been mistaken though; don't make a big deal of it.  As for the site, I think it will stay blogger-powered for the time being. So far there have been no forecasts of the blogger.com turning commercial, and even if it ever does, there are alternatives out there. Having used it for almost a year, I really like the concept.  The design is totally up to you guys.

       ok, thanks for the cheers ups (is that a word?) anywayz, I fell fine,,,,,  Faizzz, what does this mean exactly "Big Universities protect students from their own mediocrity. " I didn't really understood this phrase...... but is cool.......... Personally I think that humanity itself is not ready yet for this cloning thing.......... but go ahear Fais, impove the human race....!!!  Vlad, why would you give up to the idea of taking out the page.......??? it is pretty cool that you got all of us cennected, it is cool.........!!!  About the design of the site, I have many, but really many ideas about it, some of them you might like and some of them you might hate, but if you want to head them write me an e-mail, ideas such as stop using the blogger software cuz it might get to be paid sooner or later, I am almost done with a perl scrpt that will almost do the job, but it needs server right to do the right performance, also some lay out ideas, colors..... add ons............ etc...  Changing topic, Vlad, I c you ur apetit for robotics just woke up??? hehehe, you shuold have had tried at Vanier it was pretty cool, right Fais?  Wajdi, what happened to ur site, it is not there anymore??? come on do not hide your master piece.......  ok, bye for now........  Ah almost forgot, can anyone give me advise with Masao Chen, I have him for Prob & Stat we are only 13 in the class..... it is scary.

       Hello fellows.  It seems to me the blog is coming to life again. Very well, very well.   Faisal, I totally agree with you about big universities. Also, I am an ardent opponent of religion interfering with ethics and education. That is the main reason I fiercely dislike George W. B.  Don't get me wrong though - I am not a atheist. As a matter of fact, most of the commonly accepted ethics strikingly resembles the fundamentals of the prevailing world religions. That notwithstanding, in my opinion, one can still lead a perfectly "good" and sensible life not being religious at all. In any case, I better stop there or I will get carried away by my own words and will lose my point, which was nonexistent to begin with.  There is so much information about biology (genetics and cloning in particular) being poured onto people's heads these days that nobody seems to have a well-defined point of view (not to be confused with strong belief). Some folks especially like the word  engineering  after  genetical . Me too, I think it sounds pretty neat. For more such stuff check out a few last issues of the Canadian edition of the  Time Magazine . The  Mad Scientist  is back.  Keep us up to date Faisal. I like the atmosphere you bring into this discussion. To tell the truth, I was about to abandon the whole idea of keeping this site up, but you made me change my mind.  Congrats to Roman! You finally made it! We should definitely meet before you leave.  Cheer up Igar! I'm sure you'll join the rest of the crowd soon. Get your stuff together and finish with a blast!  Also, guys. I would like to make things more interesting here by adding a page containing info about the participants of the discussion. Please use the form on the   home page  to write a brief self-description (don't worry if you get an error - I will receive the message in any case). If you want a picture of you to be placed there as well, send it to vlad@vladster.net. Also, send me any suggestions you might have about a new design of this page. Let's make it a team effort!  Regards everyone,

       Good morning all, I trust everyone is fine. Can anyone guess where I am?? I am not in Canada. I am in the United States but not in New York or Washington. Any guesses?? I am in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in the library of Duquennes University. Yes that's right. I came here to visit a friend. I have visited the entire facility. It is a private catholic institution. I have to tell you, I am amazed by the hi-techness of this place.  As I expected, their views in science on ethical subjects are one-sided. What struck me as very funny was the ressemblance to the movie,"Dead poet's society". You can see everywhere proud parents accompanying their "children", walking with them up the hill, patting them on the back. Smiles run wild. Pride is stuck everywhere.  This entire institution is based on principles and rules of the catholic morals and ethics. What happens in the dorms are anything but that. It takes a student to know one. I talked to some fellow science student concerning the discipline and their science education they receive. I have to say the secret that I learned from a fellow friend at Cambridge is true.  Big Universities protect students from their own mediocrity.  Alas that is true. I thought that was only true in the UK. That same is the truth in the US. I asked couple of students, apprently holding GPA's higher than 3.5, about some notions in genetics. Their answers and opinion sickens me. I can feel the pain of the parents who send their students with their hard earned money.    Anyway that's my two cents on this university for now.    I'll be back soon to keep you up to date.   Im out  peace

       Hey Waj.  The best way to add moseover effect for text links is using style sheets. I will again refer you to the front page. It's very simple:  &lt;STYLE type="text/css""&gt; &lt;!-- a:link {  text-decoration: underline; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; color: #000000}  a:visited {  font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-decoration: underline; color: #000000}  a:hover {  font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px; text-decoration: underline; color: #000000} --&gt; &lt;/STYLE&gt;  Substitute your own colours and decorations (bold, itallic or underline). Remember to include all this stuff within HEAD tags.

       Hi everyone  It seems to me that everytime I ask a web related question Igar and Vlad just go at it. GRRRRRRRRRRRRRR...........peace, love, come on guys :) Alright ill stop now :)  So how is everyone doing? Things are good? ALRIGHT!!!!!!!. ummm I was trying to make the navigator on the site look nicer so I tried some Java scripting. It worked for the first image, and then it did not work for the rest. I want to make an onmouse over and offmouse over event. I have the images made and everything, I have to decrease the size but that is not important. I just wanted to know why my script was not working. isnt it just =              onMouseOut="document.pic1.src='NSERC.jpg'">          Why wont it work? btw, one more thing, What would be the code for on and off mouseover events for text, no images.  Man I am tired. I think I am going to go home now. I am pretty tired. I need my sleep Good bye everyone Thanks

Yes u r right that I have a big hunger for recognition, and I do not consider this a defect, it just makes me work better, I'd like to be on the cover of "Time magazine" one day, wouldn't you???  There is something I don't get, about Waj's problem with the lins inside the page, havent you noticed that I had already wirtten the right answer??? I mean there is nothing more to that subject, is there?  Funny note: Vlad your obsetion with those phalic symbols is getting pathetic Jak, Yak,....   Vlad u say u consider me a friend............ so treat me like one to keep up with your words, I feel that we are like Spok and the doctor from Star Treak, alwayz fighting.......

       Waj, I just took a glance at your work for the first time in a week or so. Gettin' much better! Congrats. But the pic on the front page is 233 kb for chrissake!!! That's way too much even for cable. Get your 'shop to work man!  I also like your filenames: researche.html, pub.html, jak15.jpg. Jak (aka Yak) is a russian military aircraft manufacturer. Just a coincidence, but a funny one. Keep it up!

Not funny Igar. Not funny at all. Yes, you're right, there's much more to web design. There should be something behind the code. I am  not  claiming anything on my part, but there should be some talent and a little decency. You behave like some misunderstood half-baked genius. Your thirst for recognition alone won't get you one. Relax.  I know you think that I'm treating you with a fair amount of prejudice. That's right, but you should at least give me a credit for saying what I think. I only allow myself to do it when I'm with  friends . I hope it will make you feel a little special.

       Hey Wajdi! I see you're still stuggling :o). You might have noticed the system you're trying to employ is hard at work on this site. It's most clearly seen on the  urlLink  front page  . The "link" after each post takes you to a specific location within a blog archive file. Feel free to copy the source. I am proud to announce that, unlike this page, that one is written almost exclusively in notepad. (!)

       hey guys. whats up? You know what? Some people can be really stupid sometimes. In a certain part of the page, in the publications section I decided to divide the publictions by year and each year would have its own link. The department said that they wanted to stay consistent and that the publications had to ALL stay on one page... YOU KNOW HOW BIG IT IS?????? if someone wanted to read it, they would not bother because of the length and they would have to scroll around looking for a specific publication. So now I have to remake that page and put the publications all on that one page. But now I want to put a page jump thingie. Like click on the link at the top and it will take you to that specific part of the page, but it will not work, dont I do it like this:  things ? Ugh, im hungry, bye guys. and thanx

       Man, one last thing, your main page looks too much to the left and you are not using all the spase provided by the screen, you don't have to but it looks akward........... Vlad, why do you always have to critisize my critic reviews? ...........Whatever, do what(@#%@)ever you want........... but that won't change the TRUTH!!! that truth that is that there is much more to web design than just theory of colors are some tutorials of coding wrongly interpreted using all those tools, the genius comes from simplysity, it is an art a way of expretion that actually has standards of good taste to be followed.

       Fair enough Igar. The reason the friends page is so different is that I try to separate it form the rest as much as possible. It should look like it's an individual site.   Let me kindly ignore the rest :o). Thanks!

       OK, V;ad I know almost exactly how u feel, every time I produse something I whant the whole world to c it.... but man, understand something, do not post up something that is or: not finished or not the final version or you aren't completely fallen in love with that particular design, othervise it gets anoying... and also the inconsistensy of colors from index to friends is quite anoying, guy, I am  not attacing u just advising you... you like the images that is fine, you have choosen a stile.... I am really into the borthers u r using for your tables, but I do not like the general structure itself, is not as user friendly as u want it to be....  if you want another advise: why dont u create the blogger page desing or template as they call it and you use a javascript to write it in it, it works pretty nice in my homepage, take a look:  urlLink www.ipasyst.com  take a look to the scrolling news it is updated trough the blog but is writen by JS with something like this:    &lt;document.write('&lt;Blogger&gt;&lt;BlogDateHeader&gt;'); document.write('&lt;em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;$BlogDateHeaderDate$&gt;&lt;/em&gt;'); document.write('&lt;br&gt;&lt;/BlogDateHeader&gt;'); document.write('&lt;em&gt;&lt;$BlogItemBody$&gt;&lt;br&gt;'); document.write('&lt;$BlogItemAuthor$&gt;'); document.write('&lt;br&gt;&lt;$BlogItemDateTime$&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;'); document.write('&lt;/Blogger&gt;');

       well I read an article in a french magazine which said that scientists have used carbon dating and found that it is not as old as Jesus's time.In fact, dating the shroud indicates that it  was  a burial blanket but for someone in the middle ages, therefore, it could not be of Jesus. Some other proofs are that on it was marked Iesus Christus. And that is impossible in Jesus's time, because during his era, he was never called Christus. So all of science's tests have shown that it could not have been that old. But hey u know deep religious people, they'll believe anything and refuse to believe otherwise. So if they were to clone anybody out of  if any  cells present in the shroud, they would probably get a cobbler from the middle ages.

       Hey Faisal! Yeah, that's really hilarious. But do you think they could still find a DNA sample in the shroud after like 2000 years in open air (provided it's really what they think it is)?  happy b-day Igar! so, do we call you "Sir" now? :o)

       u r wellcome...... I checkd the site it looks much better now, a bit too simple 4 my taste, but u know that I like fancy... but seriously it seems that it does the job, a sort of advise would be to change the table borthers but that is up to you stuff like this people like it a lot:           font-family:Arial; font-size:7pt; letter-spacing=1px"> also, if u want to include a search engine in the site I have a pretty good javascript that is extremely eazy to set up so if u want it just tell me.

       I see what you mean Wajdi. The site that looks as if it has frames is a non-frame site. It's background is a big gif with a sidebar. It makes it look like frames. As for the problem on your site, I think you just need to specify the background for the left frame's source file. Another thing is... try changing the font color on the Kozinski's page. The way it is now it's very hard to read. Try white or something...  Getting together is great. Friday night would be fine with me. Pool? Movies? Anything.

       hey guys,  Thank you very much Vlad and Igar, I really appreciate it. Ummm, there is one slight problem though.  urlLink The site  has a slight problem in it, I wanted to know if there was anyway in fixing it. Vlad if you go to  urlLink this site  you will see how the site is set up, it is one whole bakcground and when you are browsing the site it looks like there are frames. I dont know if you understand what im getting at. Anyway, how is everyone doing? Alright check this out, do you guys want to meet up sometime, go out do stuff? sound good? You want to fix a day so we can all make it? All the amazing summer movies I have seen and no other good ones are going to be coming out after American Pie. AW well. Summer is almost over. It went by pretty quickly. Well sort of. Well off I go to another day in the lab and more web designing (ick!). Well goodbye everyone :)

We are searching for the meaning of life and we continue on a path we think is right, I just hope im not around to find out the result.   You know what they say, "The light at the end of the tunnel is the headlight of an oncoming train."      P.s: hehe found something  urlLink  hilarious  ,   while we're on the subject

       personally i think it is not the border but this the solution, but whatever pleases you:                 just change the numbers, and if u can not c anything then open the goddamed source ;-)

       Hey Waj,  As I already told you, just specify "0" for the frame borders when defining the frameset. It will look like this:   [FRAMESET cols="blah,blah"  border="0" ]   Replace [ ] brackets with   when editing HTML. If you're doing it all in Dreamweaver, just set "0" for the frameborder in the properties inspector.  Pretty interesting article there Faisal. If you want my opinion, I don't think there is something profoundly wrong with human cloning from scientific pt. of view. However, problems will surely arise. First of all - ethics. Mr. Danby-Smith will have to think about this one for quite a long time to come to a conclusion. There may also appear a new kind of discrimination: clones vs. non-clones.   As well, the situation could become similar to that with abortions. Some fanatics might start shooting down doctors and scientists. That's just a short resume of a few potential negative aspects of human cloning that come to my mind. All that said, I can perfectly understand the scientist who doesn't give a fuck about right or wrong and just wants to do the darn thing, because it's just plain interesting.   The last thing for today. As any new scientific/technological idea/invention, this one will NOT bring new problems. It will merely highlight the old ones. It  was like this with nuclear energy; it is the same with cloning; it will always be the same with anything else to come. All the dark sides of our souls stay intact as we think we evolve to become a better society. Every new advancement acts as a catalyzer, brightening some bad stuff about us we try hard to eliminate.

       Hello hello,  I have to make this to the point because I do not have much time. I really need anyones help on this. I am not good with frames and my prof wants them. Now I want to make it so that the border between the frames is not there so that I can have once whole background to make it look like there are no frames and I have no idea, tutorials are not helping me much on this. I would really appreciate it, if you guys can help me out on this. Because I really do not know how to do this and I need all the help I can get. Thank you very much for this. back to work now....bye bye

       .... Vlad, man u have a problem, I said "a" no u have many of them, look! the guy asked sincere critic for his site I gave it, but havent u realized that I havent asked for any critic on my critic? man I do not give a shit about what u think about my comments what bothers me is that ur prepotense is too big, and I think one day it is gonna outgrow u, and when that day comes, man u will feel and fall missarable, and beleive me I won't be there nieghter to laugh nor to cry for your missery....  about the site, it is not fanciness, but if there are norms of stetic that a majority agreed cuz of presentation and functionality then I think y not , but at the ent it is up to the webdesigner....   Fais, about the cloning thing, man I don't think that we r ready yet, we will be one day but  not yet, we better still with sheeps and mice, man comes when perfection is acheived, and 227 tries to acheive a sheep it is quiet a rist to take with humans....

       ".- Kill the frames, or atleast make them fade into the backgdound using smaller text or images"  That just makes me laugh. Hard.  OK, Waj, the site is quite usable. I hope you understand you don't have to make it glitter in style sheets or stuff like that. It's a purely academic site for a very limited audience. One can pretty safely assume its potential visitors won't give a damn what it looks like, as long as they know where to click and the font is not too small. So far, so good.  The only thing  I would do  is set "0" for frame border size.  Cheers,

       Hi waj, yes I loved the movie, I also loved the yesterday's gay pride parade, it was awsome, sadly didn't get laid, heheheh u perverts!!!  Waj, ok don'T get mad but the critic it unevitable:  1.- Kill the frames, or atleast make them fade into the backgdound using smaller text or images and make the horisontal bar gone by making the mcgill logo smaller and the auto scroll to off, cuz the huge bar there in the middle just spoils it all, but that is only if u plan to keep the frames, my best advise would be to make individual pages for each with the menu on side on each page, it is not hard just copy and paste  and looks more proffesional.  2.-equipment & teaching give me 404 errors, maight be cuz the site is not done yet?  3.-profesor kazinski, what happened to the picture? it looks kinda weird... and the headings are too  BIG    4.-http://www.minmet.mcgill.ca/people/janusz/researchi2.htm the image doesn't fit in a normal 800x 600 window  5.-the other pages with no bkground?? it might be nice but be consistent, or is cuz u r not done so do not pay attention to this comment.  6.-do not use too fancy backgrounds, they make the text be difficultly readble.  7.-if you cuold include some cascading style sheet would be really nice, not trying to show off but can take something from   urlLink here   good look and againg do not get mad at me, just trying to help, and being sincere ;-)

       Hey guys,  Well I did not post up anything in a while. I went to the radiohead concert lastnight and all I could say is wow. The best show I have been to yet. Incredible. No one was jumping up and down going crazy and moshing or anything, we all just stood there dead in our tracks staring at Thome Yorke listening to his soothing voice while the synthesizers go on and the guitars played vintage radiohead melodies.   Best time I had in a while. It was awesome, Thom Yorke actually played a request from the audiance it was incredible. They came back for three encores because we could not get enough of their music. It was well worth the 9 hour wait in line, I was right in front of the stage, only 2 people in front of me from the front bar.   I see there is an ongoing conflict between Vlad and Russo, russo do you know who jerry springer is? well the way I know jerry springer, he is a cheesy talk show host who brings the biggest freaks in america like men who are women and vice versa and people who have affairs with people and kick the crap out of eachother on tv. and strippers and stuff. That is who Jerry Springer is. Now, Russo, do you FINALLY know who Jerry Spriner is?  you want the site? here it is, but it is not even half done and ignore the main page it is not done yet so please restrain from criticizing the main page. as for everything else please go ahead, oh and a reminder my knowledge in html does not even come close to anyone on the blog. so please keep that in mind    urlLink MinMet   bye everyone btw, Russo did you like rush hour 2?

       Yeah, indeed. Let's all get real! Let us get a life aswell. A good life... with a big pool in a huge back yard. We will drive our reliable Buicks to Reno Depot to buy a new hot thing, a special device designed to catapult the freesbee to a maximum of 500 meters.   Imagine, we will play with our hounds in our back yards, catapulting the freesbee to 500 meters... and it will still land in our backyards. Sweet... We will spend our mornings listening to the reliable news headlines graciously brought to us by  Dagwoods Sandviches  and optimistic weather forecasts brought to us by  Jean Coutu  (they've got it all, even a friend). We will spend our afternoons reading  Globe and Mail  while sipping Irish Cream at the  Paris Cafe . We will watch  CTV  news at night. Lloyd Robertson will fill us with reassuring comfort of being connected to the world, of being on top of it all, of having made it so well in life...

       Ursso,  you know, I think my sense of humor is OK. You may, or may not draw further conclusions from this. You've been telling me that I suck for the past year or so. I now think of it as a compliment. I mean, how weird would it be if you told me I'm a nice person? As long as you hate me, I'm fine :)).  Jerry Springer... I don't know why I wrote it there. It was the first name that poped in my head. Boring as that. :)) Cheers,

       Hi Faisal.  I was observing the issue with not much attention and from outside. Here's what Mcgill Tribune says about it.  urlLink This  is the response to  urlLink this  article. I have too little info to properly address the topic, but they say the reason for expulsion was not the rasist remarks, but simply a failure to register. Thus, they claim, the expelled individuals were not even considered Concordia students at the time of commiting the acts.  Similar stuff happens regularly at McGill as well. Take the Student Society "execs", as they like to be called. They are lobbying the gouvernment of Quebec against differential tuition fees. They say that a higher tuition for out-of-province students is discriminative. Yeah right: $3,000 at McGill as opposed to $5,500 at any Ontario U. They want the same fees for all Canadians, but, apparenlty, they are leaving it up to Francois Legault to decide whether to reduce the fee for "them" or to raise it for "us". Guess which one he'll choose.   What bothers me a lot is the Society President's comments on this. He says the Society's actions do not defend the common good of the majority of McGill students, BUT it is ethical to defend the rights of the minority of out-of-province students. Fuckin' nonsense. You were elected by the majority and are supposed to defend it's interests.

       I am starting to hate activitists. The couple hippie freaks that govern the CSU (Concordia Student union) are making it bad for the rest of the students. Especially the ambitious ones. Sometimes I think that student activitists do what they do, because they want justice for the rest of the people. The rest of the time, its because they're good at nothing else. Sometimes, they realize their mediocrity and want to piss off at others, or the '"establishment" as its called. This is what happened.   At the beginning of the year, two arab students were expelled for writing and displaying remarks such as Long Live Palestien or such. I thouht it was pretty rough that they were expelled without any notice whatsoever. they werent even allowed to a trial or anything. They were just expelled and I found that outrageous. So the CSU set up protests and demanded they have a trial re-instated. Concordia establishment denied it. So the CSU then did something that enraged me.   They sent letters to companies such as Bell and Nortel accusing them of associating with an anti-humanitarian establishment such as Concordia. Bell and Nortel backed up from the convention they were supposed to hold in Concordia to recruit graduating students. Not only that, they sent to 3 or 4 huge Accounting Firms that were very important for the commerce students. And the Accounting Firms backed off as well !!!   What really pissed me off the most, was that they sent same letters to Merck Frost. Merck Frost!!! Its is the future employment stand for all Biochemists and so on! And Merck Frost backed off as well. I swear I really hate a specific number of people of the CSU. What beats my intelligence is that if the Concordia Student Union does think about the students , how could they do this to them? Fighting for 2 students and injuring for the rest of them does not whatsoever justify their actions!  The only thing that changes the world is scientists, Activists and politicians are just phooey.   Just my ramblin  peace im out

       Well, I've never heard of the " unparalleled definition of reverse entropy " as such, and I can hardly conceive what our life would be like if the nature indeed followed it. Would that mean a reverse evolution (in the scope of our comprehedning of this abstract term)? Would that signify we're  en route  to the caves. Moreover, would that suggest we're on some " Hyperspatiale Express Route " with the definitive singularity as the ultimate destination?  OK, really, I ain't gotta clu watta fuck ur talkin' about, FAis. Explain.

       Yeah. I heard Bushe's speach too. It sounded very general I find. Well, I'm sure he didn't have a choice to say anything else. So, hopefully it will all happen the way it's supposed to happen. Like you said Vlad, a war against terrorism, not religion. Do you guys think Canada will be affected in any way from all this? I hopee everithing will stay safe. Besides, don't worry Vlad, you'll catch up with the "crazy fuckin shet". Just get ready to drink some more the up-coming week-end. I have a question. Is it only me or you guys don't like school either? I mean, university just started, but I can't wait to finish it. I'm already thinking of the end of the semester (like Christmass, you know).

       Hey everyone. So, did you get it? EVERY WEAPON OF WAR.  Other than that. I miss the science centre too.  It's amazing, guys! They STUDY in the libraries here. Now, did it ever cross your mind that you could actually STUDY in the science centre? To me it always meant the humiliation of the holy slacking-off place. It's very different here though :(. Having spent one weekend drinking cost me a week of catching up with the stuff.  I say, crazy fuckin shet. Yes, shet.

       About Nostradamus. I think what people say about him is quite true. I have red a book of what he wrote and he was very precisely describing what is happening now. Besides that, hi everyone. Man, has it been a long time I don't visit this site? How is  everyone? Right now I'm sitting at Concordia library, reading a 100-page assignment for tomorrow, I look around and say to myself: "This is not at all like the Science Center". I have to say I kind of miss Vanier a little (don't kill me please). However, Concordia seems very nice also. I especially feel surrounded by lots of attractive objects which keep on walking around me (well, I'm sure arround everyone). Btw, Vlad and Andrei, thanks very much for the CD player, it's a really cool gift. So, that's about it for the little piece of information about me for today. I'll try to keep up posting as much as possible. Bye.

       I'm not sure about Nostradamus either. You are more likely to be right Faisal.  Other than that, Autumn is about to encompass us with its yellowish charm of descending leaves in the foggy glittering of the setting sun.

       Fort vrai, that piece of by Chopin is trully remarkable, however i love more his Nocturne in B Flat minor.I am not sure, but wasn't Nostradamus writings in French originally? I think so. I may be wrong. I 'll check back and tell you.

       Have you heard his Waltz in C-sharp minor - a marvelous piece.  Yes, it's amazing what Nostradamus saw. The unfortunate thing is that we can't really use his writings to predict anything. We can only go back and compare what he wrote with what happened. And that gives rise to speculations. There could be numerous interpretations to what he originally wrote in Latin. This is not to say that I totally reject him.

           As I was mellowing down into Chopin, I came across the tomes of Nostradamus on the internet. In this time of world conflict, it is enlightening to see what an ancient skeptic prophet has said. And what I have discovered has shook my spine.   Century 1, Quatrain 87     Earth-shaking fire from the center of the Earth. Will cause the towers around the New City to shake: Two great rocks for a long time will make war, And then Arethusa will color a new river red.     Century 8, Quatrain 17    Those at ease will suddenly be cast down The world put into trouble by three brothers, The enemies will seize the marine city, Famine, fire, blood, plague, all evils doubled.     Century 10, Quatrain 97    Triremes full of captives of all ages, Times good to bad, the sweet for the bitter: Prey to the Barbarians hasty they will be too soon, Greedy to see the  feather of smoke wail in the wind   Oh this world seems too conflicted. May the result be in favour of the living and the consequences be subtle to an instant. Humans are affectionate to doom and are soon to have an appointent. Our crooked thirst for death, I hope, will be quenched once and for all.

       hehe Olympics it's something so distant...I wish I'd ever qualify to go there and get the last place. Canada is not a fencing country whatsoever, and Ottawa is not a fencing city, really (Sadly enough, Montreal is, it's said to have strong fencing school, due to many fencing masters from France). Actually, there is a tournament in Montreal this fal, with many strong fencers, which I'll try to visit, but only as a visitor, I won't fence this year, so if you want to come and see some real fencing action, let me know. I think there won't be any charges for visitors,  but I'm not too sure.   Cya

       Hello everybody. So what do you think about USA?   I don't want to be politically incorect to anybody, but if I had the power to hang the people, who highjacked the planes and flew them into the twin towers, I'd do it in a matter of minutes. Moreover, all the terrorist organizations need to have either SOME brains and attack ONLY military related objects, or simply they all need to be electicuted.  Anything else that I have to say, not really. I'm upset. One of the people I know was inside the one of the twin towers half an hour before the collaple making a report for the news. I hope he and his crew got out in time.   foolish terrorist bastards.

       What's up Vanier Lounge publishers. Jessus!! What happened to Vladster.net? It seems to have vanished somewhere... There are even no links available to go to our lounge... Man.   By the way, Igor. If you want to have good prizes for the tourney, you have to start a club. It seems like a lot of work, but it is not a big deal. You just have to type some stuff to start it and that's it. If you will have the club going, then you would be able to access the money from the VCSA and they are very supportive, I mean very supportive. Having a club will also allow you to ask for money from the student services. With the money you can organize some activities. And it is not hard to do that either.   To organize anything in Vanier, first you have to commence to do activites for FUN. It means that you have to tell everybody (in the TLC, VSCA, SC) how fun such an activity is. Then you have to say that you are organizing because you want to have fun and you want to attract more people to chess so you (they) could make new friends and enjoy Vanier. Then you say that you just need some help to organize this activity, i.e. posters, space, equipment, etc, but NOT MONEY. All this stuff is needed to show to the administration that you are involved in organizing this activity because you LOVE chess and you want other people like you to love it and play it TOGETHER. Besides, you would have to be nice to everybody while talking about this activity and smile. PLUS, very important to have someone presenteble beside you who aslo LOVES chess and want to help and is willing to volonteer day and night (like Audrey or someone who is loved by the administration).   Only after you do all these things you can actually start doing something to directly organize the activity: book a date, a place, have an approximate amount of people intending to participate. Only then you must talk about money for the prises. And NEVER  MENTION THAT YOU OR ANY OF THE ORGANIZERES WILL GET ANY MONEY OUT OF THE ACTIVITY!!  The money will come itself.   To ask for money you need to type a letter of demand to TLC, VCSA and SC. You must have a chess club going to ask for money from VCSA or SC and they are always the major sponsors.   So after you'll do all this stuff, you can ask me for the rest. PS Try to involve in organization Audrey, Olga the chess player, and somebody cute or charming who will do all the negotioations. Besides, Olga knows how all the tourneys work. Good luck.    For everybody  else, see you later!!

       Well, then just go to TLC and talk to Judy about the date of the championship and the prize scheme. Then print some advertisement, put it everywhere a week before the event and let people sign up at TLC. At the day of the event make pairings according to the strength of the palyers. Make a separate card for each player, where you will mark their points. I think you know how it works after that: 1 for won, 0.5 for the draw, 0 for lost.   Make sure there are people helping you. You won't make it yourself. Another thing, if you want to be in control of everything, you won't be able to participate. Find guys who are willing to help and not play.  I think that will be it.  Hope that helps.

       Hi Igar, first of all, to get money, the chess club must be officially registered at VCSA. To do that, you have to submit a paper with the list and signatures of all members, detailed list of the activities you're going to do (like field trip to NY :) and a budget proposal for each activity. This budget proposal needs to be approved by VCSA too. Then you go TLC and negociate about when and how it's going to happen. They are usually OK with that.  Good luck!!!

       Well... books are pretty expensive here too. I bought three books so far: Multivariable Calculus, Elementary Diff. Eqn's and Engineering Ethics. They all cost me a little less than $300. It's a good thing I am buying one book used and borrowing another one. Otherwise I would be facing something like $500. In any case, I'm not surprised; the prices are what I expected them to be.   Ok, tomorrow's the first day (!) (a meaningful pause) (!). I dont' even know where my classes are. This is gonna be so much fun! Wait and see.  Faisal, thnx for the feedback :).

       Hey guys. I had to change my plans because there were problems with my registration, and I had to register in person. Finally, I got my registration done, which wasn't a very pleasurable experience. I wasted like a day trying to get my courses and resolve time conflicts...then I had to waste three days...well, I played basketball with some guys, there is a playground not too far from my house, like right next to it.  The prices are incredibly high in Ottawa for some reason, but it's not that bad. My room was like the best deal around. Not very close to campus tho.   I'm just off my orientation day, and I'm so mixed up now. I was told many different things, I don't even know what to believe now. We had some alumni coming in and giving speeches, and they say that your GPA isn't that important, well, of course, it matters, but not that much.  And for rankings, what I wanna say, is that I don't think it matters that much. It's all about selling yourself, at least it seems to be so. All these Gourman and McLeans rankings I've seen before, I'm pretty sure they are subjective. There is no such thing as objectivity in this world anyway. Now, what ranking does employer believe in ? This is a pretty complicated game, there are too many factors too consider. Hehehe, and sometimes you choose schools not because of rankings, like I did, I applied to UofO just because they still were accepting applications, and I didn't want to wait anymore. I don't even know if I will regret it or not, but seems to be pretty boring here in Ottawa....prices for books are like incredible, i mean, REALLY-REALLY HIGH, I'll have to spend like 300-400 bucks for books, dammnit.  Anyway...cya Roman.

       Hi guys! Roman! I didn't even get a chance to say bye to you. I thought you said you would leave on Saturday. Anyway, best of luck to you man - you deserve it! Tell us some stuff about where you live, first impressions about the school etc...  BTW, we were about to board a bus to Ottawa last night out of boredom :).

       No, that's not what I'm saying. I'm sure universities know the approximate percentage of people accepting their admission offers and give more offers than they have space for.   As you see from the data, more than enough people apply, but fewer of them are qualified. As I have already said, a qualified applicant is likely to get more than 1 offer.

       And a short up date, yeaaaaah they made it, four gold medals, the best overall nation so far. (Well, Italy will get gold in team competitions in foil, most likely, that can change things)  I can't wait till I finally get my VHS with semi finals and finals.

       Cool. Russians got 3 golds and one bronze this year at World Championship. And hopefully they'l get one more before the championship ends. So, they must end up second or may be even first overall in the World!  Man, sometimes I'm proud I am Russian.

       You know what, I'm goina go home. Fuck that class. Fuck the quizz. I'm goina go home and pack my stuff... And I'm goina drive it to Verdun tonight.  Man, that blondie chick across the desk is driving me crazy... almost the same way the chick from our cal course is driving me insane. Andrei, you know that blonde hot girl we saw first in the computer lab. She has my favorite haircut and ever-smiling eyes. God she's gorgeous!   Come on guys! This place needs a shake-up. Let's talk about chicks!  Any suggestions, Mr. Lion Pimp?  Cheers.  Update: Oh my goodness, she gave me this longest look ever. She was walking all the way through the lab (about 30 meters) slowly turning her head and looking directly in my eyes! And I was looking directly in her eyes! Holly shitttt! Why am I writing this? Why am I not running to buy her flowers and ice-cream?!?

       Oh, don't worry about the economy. It will be up'n'running by the time we graduate (provided we don't die of Anthrax :).    Breaking news : I finally got around to get myself a cellphone. Yeah.  I also bought new genuine Italian shoes, sweater and a jacket. Pretty cool shit.  Government pays :).  Today's a party at Shatner Bldng.

       Damn, economy is goind down, markets aren't likely to rebound, etc-etc That just sucks. I broke two blades yesterday. That sucks too.   And yeah, about the unis, you know, after I moved, I don't think that names matter. in Montreal everyone is hyper about McGill, here everyone is talking about carleton, uofo, etc Sounds like it only counts for graduate degrees, and as for undergraduate doesn't matter much where you got this stupid bachelor, what do you think on that Vlad ? Comparing qualities of program is a pretty hard thing to do. Lot of ppl say that ottawa is respectable, I find the program sux. so far I have learned zero knowledge. Hope they will start actually teaching me something next year or smth.  What's that thing with TV ?  RP.

       Hi Roma! Hope to see you on Eurosport someday :)!  Waterloo's admisson standards are not entirely due to the quality of education. It's because of it's accessibility for the US companies to hire grads. Qualitywise, the best Comp/Elect Eng. program in Canada is at UofT; second is McGill. And those are the only two Canadian institutions  in this discipline  that are seriously taken into consideration in the US and in the world.  The situation might soon change, 'cause McGill's really getting ahead with new fascilities.   All that is to say that the university reputation is only significant provided all other things are equal. Of course, a 3.9 CGPA at UofO will get you a better job than 2.5 at UofT. It depends on the personality and connections as well. It's been said and discussed way too many times, but I just wanted to emphasize it once again.  Good luck everyone! Gotta go have some tea.... :))

       Ok, here is a short update.  I live a perfect live too, but for some reason, there isn't any reason.  There is no such thing as U of ontario. Ottawa is not very hard, but more expensive. it's not the best uni either. my reason for applying to ottawa were different from choosing the best school or the easiest school and the ones alike. I only applied to ottawa because it's not in Montreal, and I knew I'll get into what I wanted for sure. McGill is a better choice if you are willing to live in Montreal. Waterloo is the best, but I'm not sure it's recognized for bursaries from    AFE, and it's next to impossible to get into engineering at UW.   HAS ANYONE GOT EUROSPORT CHANNEL ??????? World championship in sabre and epee will be broadcasted live this saturday. www.eurosport.com, if you care. I got a friend of mine to record this event. There are must be some Russians in the finals too, at least in sabre Hopefully, Charikov will get gold.  Chan is hard, but he isn't that bad. I managed to get 70-75 in his Linear Algb class.I think it's good enough in his class.   Girls can blind you. Beware.  Later.

Oh "the road to humility", I have yet to experience what you have felt while we were at the Sci, poor kid :). The best tutor... hm... I've never had any illusions about Vanier standards, but that's a little over the edge I guess.  As for my life, it's quite good as well. Especially recently :)). I AM MOVING IN TWO WEEKS BABY.

It's all good. I'll have my revenge on Nov 3-4 when we're gonna fence teams :)  All my midterms are all in high 90-ies btw :P  Till later.

       Yeah, thanks, Mr. Charismatic. I have a question to you egg-head: what do you do when you desperately need friends all of the sudden?  The lattitude, eh? What's lattitude anyway? No, seriously, I can explain, but that would mean I would have to dig up my Astrophysics notes, and I'm not quite sure where they are :).  Secondly, it's not a CHART room, Mulanda. It's a very complicated and serious thing called "the blog".   Good luck there on Venus!   Breaking News:  I got 95% in my Dynamics test!!! Yeah baby! Class average = 60. There are a couple of people who got 100% though. Why didn't I? Apparently, I don't know how to add and subtract numbers over 10. But the teacher says it's OK for U1 Engineering :).

I started at 5:55pm and finished at 12:10pm, 'non-stop'. I was in McGill and almost missed the last metro home. Yet, I did it!!! I frik'n did it, and it's only 1.5 page long and it works!!

       Vlad, you're fucked up again? I'm not sure if understand you corectly, but is there something to be fucked up about? Andrei, juicy stories are not always desirable. For instance, I don't think you're gonna like this one. During the gay bar singing, Vlad and I sang the following words together: "Love me tender, love me true. All my dreams fulfill. `Cause my darling, I love you, And I always will." So do you like this one or not?  O.K. everyone it's a joke, I only sang WITH Vlad, not to Vlad.

The only thing that I know that at 9:30 in the morning in calculus class Vlad was intriguing me with some stories about a sleep-over at Audrey's house of an equal amount of fairly drunk boys and girls...  :)   I coundn't believe my ears... Gosh, I hope this will not become a blog discussion, but I want some jucy expressions, especially coming from Audrey and Evgueni... hehe :)        P.S. (oh my god) :)

Right now, I'm sitting at Concordia and writting these stupidities, also thinking should I study or go home and get some sleep for Christ's sake. Now, will you tell me I'm normal? Crazy shit, guys. later.  P.S. If anyone thinks he or she is crazy too, why don't you share your thoughts?

So, it's cool that you're getting back to chess. I just didn't know that you stopped. When did it happen? You know, it sucks that you''re joining the club. I mean, after being the president of one. And the worst part is that I won't be the activity director, someone so important in chess. o.k., I'll stop now. I am happy for you. Make sure you kick some ass at McGill. later.

I actually might get back to playing chess, and maybe join a chess club in McGill (they actually have one!!) I just got this idea two minutes ago, because today someone asked me to organize a chess tournament for my department.  Well, I just thought like sharing :).  Now, I'm going to get a nap on the grass some where on the campus.

Imagine no spaces between the lines. i think those fricking guitar players have nothing else to do in their lives, idiots. Pizdiets blia (for russian speakers only). Besides, what's up guys? I see you're complaining about mid-terms, well, luckily mine haven't started yet. In a week or two, I'll be crying n blogger.  Roma, I hope you win the 13th, in Kingston. You know what they say: break a leg (I ment good luck). Enough for today. later.

       I love genomics. We are talking in Genetics class now about mutations that cause albinism and polyploids. Very interesting. Next thing, our study will be derivation on diseases in alleles. So now that I am sitting in the Concordia Webster Library waiting to start my study on Plant biology and cell respiration I can't help but ask why people would even  want to take such a class. I have to take this class. It is pre-requisite for a next course. However, the latter half of the course will be on animals. Much better. Anyway better get back to oxidative phosphorylation. Piece of crap. Damnit, I hate plants!!!!  and I hate cell respiration. That said, I hate the important things that permit me to live. Super.  let me crawl back into the dark demented world of the plant.....   im out peace

       I wanna know why did Andrei ask me first about how are we doing, and then   "note: please, don't give compassionate comments. Just tell me about your sufferings, it will make me feel better."  Am I supposed to suffer a lot or something..? :)  Just to let you know, guys, I'm doing just fine, my midterms are not hard, and hopefully I did pretty well.  Also, my first tournament is coming up, i'm going to Kingston on Oct 13 to fence in the Queen's Invitational tournament.   Cya.

       Congrads Faisal! That's really nice that you got such a good grade.   By the way guys did you know (not if you care of course) that the first helicopter-like device was dicribed by the Chinese  in the fourth century A.D . in the book called "Pao Phu Tau" which means: "Tells of the Master" describing flying cars. Cool heh?!

       Well, it's still a plan, and it's pending for Audrey's final approval. You're right, I will probably barely survive, but I still want to try it. All I've got is my student loan, a possible bursary and some savings from the summer. My parents are willing to help too. The place is in Verdun, so, it's not that expensive. So, I guess I won't die. But, as I said, I'm not totally certain about the whole thing yet. I'll let you guys know :).

If u can say more about ur foolprove plan I'll be glad to hear it, to reconsider my situation........ and if it is none of my bussines just say so......... ok good luck again,   Igar

       Actually, I don't know about Vermont. In any case, it will be far more expensive than just to go to St. Sauveur or anywhere else up there in the north. And, since the cost is a primary consideration for me now, I'm out.

       1. For the past 300 years or so there was only one queen under whose "controll" Canada is. That is the queen of England. Since when does Canada has a queen? Or did the queen of England change tittles to Queen of Canada.  2. Vermont sounds very good. I wanna go, but everyone has to go, because we planned to spend the new years together. Oh, did I get it wrong? Are you going just in december or for the hollidays? 3. Doing something really cool is also a good idea. I mean after biking to Ottawa we will certainly handle skiing there. But more seriously, Roma if you're not coming to Montreal, we could come visityou in Ottawa, by bus you know or by car. Who's for it? Post your oinion. 4. For the chalet, I'm gonna call Dasha today. Promise.  That's about it for now

       Alright.   Today I became a Canadian Citizen... Hmmm.... Does it have to be have some special meaning for me or something?? Do I have to feel different now from what I felt before? Well, I did immigrate to Canada. I left my country to live here, and to be a part of the society. But am I really part of it or am  I just full of shit?? :)   There are the questions that I posed myself while coming from the exam and while sitting in my Intro to Mech class. I don't know if I'm a pure Russian anymore like I always wanted to be. (not because I got my Canadian passport, but because  ir's been a while that I haven't lived in Russia and the people there do not accept me as 'fully' Russian) Hmmm...   Well I guess I'm a Russian immigran to Canada, who sweared to the queen of Canada that he will be loyal to her majesty for all his life.   Yeah, whatever.

       Just as the final conclusion of the recent events that hapenned in this interesting location. Apperently ducks turned out to be dragons or God knows what happened. Moreover, sam pipal found out zey dont nou hau to rait inglish. Vell, its okey. Also, modern teachers try to impress their students with some unexisting words.  Guys, why dos it all happen when I have to leave this place for some time? Come on it's fun to see action like that on blogger. At least we get news about each other. As to myself, I think my teachers speak to each oter outside of class. Each one of them gave us work on the same week and retty much on the same day. Now I'm just enjoying my Saturday. Anyways, keep up those posts people.  Btw, how about a little get together afer the finals? later.

       I know exactly what you mean, Faisal. Some people just don't seem to get it. They think it's all about integrals and circuits. They think learning is about taking notes and drilling. They live their lives outside the classroom the same way, concentrating on getting the routine perfect and missing out on the stuff that matters.   Making that conection with the prof is important. It pisses the hell out of the rest of the crowd, but who cares? The most ridiculous thing to be desired is to be liked by everyone.  By the way, you did copy it down, didn't you? :)

       Have you ever been in a class, where the teacher is talking about something absolutely fascinating and you are actually smiling, but you then look around the class and you start frowning !!! Because the bunch of people around you are actually secretaries copying down what he's saying, instead of actually listening to what he's saying and giving into the amazement of the subject matter!!!!!!!  You feel like grabbing by the collar, and then screaming, hey Mrs. Nesbit ! copy it later!  Listen to what he's saying!!!!   Geez , he just mentioned the coolest thing, and people didnt even pay attention. Beause if they would , they would say "ah!!" and start asking questions. Instead most of them were so fucking occupied writing and maintaining their handwriting, that they lifted an eyebrow, when I asked a question about what the teacher was talking about. I was saying in my head" Bunch of fucking morons, you would know what I'm talking about, if you were listening to what he was saying!!!"  What really got me ticked off was as the teacher was taking the slide containing the very exciting subject away, a girl raising her hand, a flourescent pink pen in her fingers, and asked if the teacher could put back the slide!!!  At that time, I was testing my Physics. If I threw my book with enough velocity , would it reach her head?  However, this same teacher got his way today. Somehow he read my mind!  As soon as he entered  the class, he went upto the board, much to the expectation of the prepared secretaries, and jotted down " infundilibulirum " As the secretaries finished recoping it down, only couple of friends and I deciphered the hidden smile of the teacher, as he realized that a lot had fell for it. I wont call it sucking up, but there was a glance when he passed his eyes around the class and for a split second, paused at mine, fabricated somewhat of a restrained laughter, and continued to look around the class.That teacher kicks ass.He had his way of fun.  By the way, infundilibulirum means .... well...........it means whatever you want it to mean.............in other words...nothing.   My two cents 00  peace im out

       First of all, I never called myself a duck. :)) Check the text more carfully, "we" was never defined!! Moreover, nothing ever was taken personnaly, it was fun. If you find this "boring", then I don't know what kind of sense of humor baby-dragons have (well, maybe they are still developping a sense of humor, but that's another topic for a research :)).   Nonetheless, I never thought that someone can accuse me of plagerizing or copying someone's style! That's a first one. Yet, that's an easy way out that you chose. You are accusing me with no proof, basing your evidence on the fact that I discussed upon mostly dragons. Quite poor, not to say more. To add, the expression "lame duck" used was not reffering to ducks directly (even you said it). I made the lame ducks 'real' ducks!! And I brought the pets and other creatures to this blog.   So... sorry dude :) And smile :)  P.S. I'm not competeting with anyone's "wordy diarrhea".         I'm just having fun. :))   Mr.

       All I said was that ducks were smart. I didn't call *you* a duck. It's all your imagination. Ducks are ducks. Turkeys are turkeys. Lame ducks are a different concept. You got all personal. I'll take it as a compliment and end it there.   Secondly, don't fuckin' try to imitate me. Be original for once in your life. Domestic animals is my thing. Get yourself your own topic. Like... worms or something. Don't elaborate on my style. You sound disgusting.  In any case, this all is getting pretty boring. None of you will ever beat me in this wordy diarrhea race (I hope you've realized it by now). Get over it.  Gotta go do cal. See y'all.  P.S. I wonder if the spider reads this. Let's check it out... oh yes! Baby-dragon is live!

       Watch out of whom you are calling turkeys, fire-burper!!!!!  By the way, did you know that chickens grow to be cocks?! But that's not the point, since you've decided to be a baby-dragon.  So the new research in psicology in relation with bodily fonctions that we are involved in, implies, that since adult dragons burp fire, therefore, when they were still babies, they had to undergo a prosses of learning of doing that.  In the lab, we have performed various experiments on the topic of what would be the most efficient way of learning of flying and burping fire for a baby dragon. And sinse efficiency is the most important factor for the dragons, we have observed that first they learn how to fart fire. It gives them the ability to have fire powered flights, at the same time as experimenting with the internal combustion of hyena-based food products. After gaining a suffitient control of the so called "natural fire engine", they develop heat-resistant skin around their bodies which usually results in greenish color (yet sometimes it's pink, but then they don't fly and are relatively close to ducks behind the fence, yet on a lower evolutionary step :)).  Then, gaining experience, the baby-dragons learn to fly without their inretnal combustion engines (because it doesn't look respectable flying like that, and moreover it doesn't smell well at all!!), and they reverse their fire extracting prosses from fire-farting to fire-burping, which in THEIR opinion is  looks and smells much better (of course unless they are pink dragons).   Well, that's pretty much it for our research, because other amazing facts about  "psicology in relation with bodily fonctions of baby-dragons and other pets" still need testing.  But there will be other posting if the audience is interested. (If there is any audience at all)  Thank you for your time,  Sincerely yours,   Dr.

       I always said ducks were smart birds. It just so happens that their wings get cut short at puberty. They never get to fly over the fence and "get into the position" of freeing their mind that way.  So, our poor ducks go out and invent their own artificial freedom (they call it AF). At this stage, they are smart and persuasive enough to make some other domestic birds believe them. It's a great puzzle to us scientists as per why they mainly concentrate on young turkeys. The preliminary analysis of observational satellite data shows that the reason might lie in the ducks' eternal confusion about rabbits and pigs. They just don't seem to understand why the pigs' 8-minute orgasms have nothing to do with the rabbits' population growth.  Chicken? I'm a Dragon, baby! Well, a baby-dragon at least.

       Kicked my ass? You know, some people never learn. Grow up, kid. Just because I didn't go on rambling about something pointless doesn't mean I  lost  in the *discussion*. In case you didn't know, a purposeful  discussion  is the one with a subject and a potential useful outcome for debating parties. Both factors were missing in Andrei's arguments, which made him a lame duck from the beginning. Putting him down was like hitting a child, I'm sorry. Anyway, I don't think I need to defend myself here :) Next time you're desperate to argue, write something at least marginally exciting please.  To the spectators: the *discussion* starts at the bottom of November 21. Have fun.  I don't have neither desktop nor laptop right now. The desktop stayed at my parents' place. I am probably going to buy one for the next semester. I think (and that's my personal opinion) that to buy a laptop is not very reasonable. First of all, you pay much more for the same parameters. We have all the facilities at school, and, to tell the truth, I didn't even need a computer at home this semester. So, unless you just want to be super cool and do your stuff in the metro on the way home, go for a good desktop if you don't have one already.  By the way, does anybody want snowflakes on this page. Would it make you happier? You know, being happy is important ;)

       By the way, check out my computer's problem: ______________________________________________________ 1) The spring is not ideal and its force may be a non-linear function of position, here perhaps k*(Y+eta*Y^3). 2) The spring could be hung down from an above surface, adding gravity (Mg) 3) The fluid around the mass will also offer some resistance based on its viscosity and the velocity of the mass such as some coefficient "mu" times the velocity squared.  To keep sign information which is important for the direction of the viscosity force we take the absolute value of one of the velocities in the square.  Equating the sum of forces to the sum of the spring, viscous and gravitational forces we then obtain the following system.  F=m*a= -k*(Y+n*Y^3)-mu*V*|V|-m*g  So  a+[k*(Y+n*Y^3)]/m+[mu*V|V|]/m+g=0  With   a=second derivative of Y   V=derivative of Y  Plug it into the equation above and solve it for Y.  Note of the TA: "This is a very ugly differential equation indeed.  If you know the solution offhand please tell us how, you obviously deserve some sort of prize (go for Nobel).  It is sufficiently ugly that I'm not entirely sure Maple can even solve it."  (the needed constants are given) ____________________________________________________

        Diarrhea   di-ar-rhe-a   also   di-ar-rhoe-a   n. Excessive and frequent evacuation of watery feces, usually indicating gastrointestinal distress or disorder.   Keep in mind, son: when you want to prove something to the people, first prove it to yourself. Otherwise, you get sidetracked and sound incoherent at best.

       "fascist crap"? irrelevant.   "ironic play of words" and "fucked-up leader" is just an excuse for any 'normal person' to skip over the mental pathology that he/she has without having to face the challenge of accepting something 'amoral' which my distinguish him/her self from the pattern of 'normal, resonable, open-minded' human being.   It's a self defence reflex that anyone has. The reflex is to reject anything that might cause any substantial change in the stabilized mental consciousness of the person.

       Well, I wouldn't go so far as saying the phrase is **true**. It provides with some insight into the mental pathology of some fucked-up leader, but is absolutely sensless to a normal person. I certainly hope so at the very least.   I also disagree about this phrase being *universal*. Anybody in their right mind understands that it's nothing more than an ironic play of words that makes you wonder for a second or two.   In other words, cut the fascist crap.

       Hey guys! I am in LOVE with MAC OS. She is sooo sexy. I stood there in the computer store playing with her for like half an hour or so, non-stop, until the sales guys started to get sort of nervous.  Too bad I won't ever ask her out of the store simply because I will most likely be forced to buy her licensed software. That's why I'm staying with the sure thing: the un-sexy, but ever-low-maintenance daughter of Bill The Mighty Gates of Hell.   Seriously, I have NEVER bought any software in my life. Anyone know what it feels like?

       Yeah, yeah... I actually did appologize something like half an hour ago. Meaning that I said: "Sorry for what I said in class" She said that it's all good and she "doesn't think about that so I shouldn't either".  Fair well.  By the way, people, today is going to be my "first night out", sort of. Good night.

       What's up guys, I'm in a bad mood, and I'm intending to share it with you.  First of all, I was very tired this morning because I didn't have a lot of sleep, but who cares. Then I have some stuff to think about which doesn't make me happy (which is the cause of my being moody that I don't want to reveil here).   And at last, I was sitting and talking with a good friend of mine, Patricia, a blond basketball player with an exposive attitude. So she said something, I misheard it and called her  "A Fucking Whore" very loudly.  Everybody in the class turned and looked at her and me.... She got very red and said: "Fuck you!!! Don't ever call me that!" I said: "Oh, sorry", and continued on coping off the board. Five minutes later I realized that I insalted her. She wasn't saying athything, still looking like a tomato. So I said that I don't want to continue the conversation we had and changed the subject. We continued on talking in a normal manner. However, I still feet bad for imbarassing her in front of the entire class.   Dang! I think I'm going to have a bad day

Anyway, she is still waiting for her parents decition if she can use it or not, however, I think that we should already make up the lists, and also look for some place for rent.   By the way, anybody wants to go to Rhode Island on dec26 to dec29? I'm most likely going.  take care

       What's up everybody...  If any one of you came to McGill engineering buildings today,  and wondrered why are there so many people walking with faces as if someone died. Well, they are mech-eng students who have experienced what it means, to have an 84 average for the first mid-term, when the usual rate of failures for the course Mechanics-1  is 40%, which didsn't seem to be the case. Therefor, as the teacher said before the mid-term today: " The second mid-term will be somewhat harder, since we do need  to bring the average to the grade like we had years before".   Result: spitting the disgust of desperation of all the students, since the 84% average we had will inevitably drop to the "usual average" that this stupid faculty had for years before.  Oh well.

       Way to go  TyGoN ! Yeah, you probably read what I wrote about my dynamics teacher. She mostly teaches Civil Eng. and sucks ass big time. That being true, I can't complain about my other teachers. So far, they've been top-notch (compared to the tripple-B at least :).   Hey  Igar . Long time no see.  Answer #1: The "Unaited States" thing is a script that is supposed to determine the country according to your IP. As I now see, it mistakingly treats some Canadian IP's like they are American. Oh well, nothing's perfect.  Answer #2: You're probably missing my point in that post about BSB, NSYNC etc. I am not attacking them. I'm just making a short-handed comment about the society. I don't care what music one listens to, really. There are other, more reliable, ways to look at people.  Yes,  Roma . You suck. :) What's up with that? Eh? Let us know when your next tournament is.

Tutorials are for solving and asking questions!  My guess is the TA sucks and doesnt know the answers to the questions you're asking and is missing the nuts to tell you that he doesnt know.  You see, he's got fucking dignity to take care of. Somehow showing that he is flawed somewhere proves his imperfection and bleeds his dignity. What a moron.  Heard about the teachers too. Must be the same problem. Anyway I'm having a blast with my TA's. We went for beers last week.    Anywayz peace Im  out

Such an asshole. Moreover he complained to the dean last week that we are a bad class with no respect and that measures have to be taken, such that tutorials should be only problem soving sessions without any quetions asked!

The good thing is that it's only 25 mins from school by bus or 20 mins by metro. Could be even faster if I were in Concordia.

As for "Depeche Moderator", don't u ever call me "Lion Pimp" again, severe consequences might result..and Andrei, i hear there is something cracking!!! i  tried to reach u on your cell over the weekend, but instead i got this chick who told me i had a wrong number..don't do that to me again, itching consequences might result...

       First. About myself. A+ on a midterm, best in the cass. Second. Andrei you're pathetic. Trick or treating at your age. Come on man. Well, actually, it's kind of normal for you. It's too funny, I can just imagine you with a big smile: trick or treat. Third. Roma, what's up man? Nice "hearing" from you. I may be going to Ottawa in February for a competition. Fourth and the best. Chicks. Vlad, you know I don't get you. Seriously, why aren't you running after her? Btw, if you need a hook up, ask Andrei he'll do it for you. You know what I mean? If he's not available I can try. O.k. just kidding. I'm writing this, because, myself, I've been staring at all the posible chicks you can see around here, at Concordia. Even now when I'm writing my head keeps on rotating (360 degrees about its axis). O.k. gotta go study now later

       Cool stuff Roman!!  By the way, 2.5 hours of 'trick or treating' yesterday. Cool costumes from Cirque du Solei. Resulst: no candy. Reason: TOO BIG to be a kid!! Huh! (consequence: crying in the coner for 2.5 hours).  End of sad story.  Actually, I was looking after a group of kids who were 'trick or treating' yesterday night, but I still had a costume. Pretty fun, considering it was raining and it was cold. But who cares, the kids loved it!

       Last sun this year is leaving my sight. In a few minutes it will be gone. This year will be gone, so let it pass and let everything that happened this year pass. Pass for good. We can remember it if we want. We can remember from it what we want. Let's move on to new year, to new life, to new victories and new failures and their glory! Because every failure is a victory for someone else and vis-et-versa!   Vivre! Mes amis, vivre!  Cheers!

       Well, you might be very suprised by who may be possibly involved in a fight :)) Moreover, I'm anticipating a very curious life's situation arrising there, and the actors didn't get their roles yet... :)  However, I can't say more than what I said, but I know for sure that someone will be "walking on the eggs" tonight trying not to break them. And maybe that person will not be alone.   In any case!!!!! Everything will be fun after a couple of drinks. :))  Happy New Year everyone!!!!!   Happy Holidays!! Have fun!!! Enjoy yourselves alone or with anybody you want!!   And the only thing that I wish  to all of you is: "Have a good next year, and let it be that your next year will be as good as this one or better, and that all of you will live up to your expections, your highest expections! Good luck."

       Dear Friends! Happy New Year!  It's ironic how many "officially single" people will be attending the party. Looks like... ok, let's not go there. I want to finally see a fight or something. Getting into one would be the ultimate fulfilment. :)

       Good afternoon Madames&Monseiners. It's presently 11:51 at Providence, Rhode Island. I finished my game 7mins ago. It was a fast win for me against some guy from Univ. of Wiscomsin or of Univ of Wayoming. The rest of the team is still playing. The tournament so far is not going too well. I have 3 wins and one loss. The loss was against a poor player from Univ of Toronto, but I coundn't care less about chess that day. Now everything is back to normal.   There are 3 more rounds left. And I'm coming back on the 30th. I'm celebrating New Years in Montreal. I'm officially single now, so there is no particular reason for my going anywhere esle. Besides that, I'm going to work out and chill in the jacuzzy later on today.  By the way, I hope that there is a plan for the New Year's eve, and I hope that Roman is already in MTL :) . And also to whom am I giving a gift, if we will have a girf exchange?! I have some spare gifts laying around that I'd like to give out.  See you all soon.  take care,

       Good  morning  everyone.   Having been prematurely awaken[ed] in a dying glitter of the afternoon sunlight, I allow my disturbed mind to wander upon the illustrious ventures  we  had embarked upon herein last night. Few could grasp the utter meaning of our philosophically intense conversations filled with intricate details of the most marvelled at natural process. But those fortunate enough to withstand the temptation to quit reading this post three lines ago will shudder at the significance of the impact we created on the issue of women's rights to freedom of sexual preferences.

Roma, I'm gonna ask two of my other roommates, and, if that's ok with them, you can stay over at our place. Mind you, the sofa is horrible.  I want ALL of the people to respond with their plans for the new year's. Even if you're going to get drunk watching porn. If you're still undecided, join the party.

       Gift exchange. That's for sure guys. Anyone whose comming to the party is bringing a gift. Just a little something that doesn't have to be expensive. it's simply symbolic. As to the place we just need a confirmation from one of the members of the blog (Josee?). I'll try to call most of the poeple this week.  P.S. If you guys have no plans for Friday come to my dance school's x-mass party. It's free and I'm doing a show. later.

       Great. took my only 2 hours to guess my password. I've beaten all records.. That's what free alcohol does to you...I just found out that my fencing club is sposored by a local bar, and that every x-mas they give us two kegs of beer for free...man, that's something. I wouldn't wanna go into details what happened afterwards..  Ya, I think I'm coming over to Montreal for a couple of days to see ya, i'm planning to come somewhere around 26-28..and spending about three to four days ...and I'll probably need place to stay, too, any volounteers..?  I also propose a random gift exchange for the New Year, and let's make it nasty and stupid, so that someone can get stuck with my wacked gift I'm gonna get...I'll try to make it as nasty as possible..Also, are you gonna go to some club for the NY or smth ? And I tell you what, let's stay at someone's place rather than going to some club..nice savings on alcohol and u know. What r the plans anyway.lemme know asap so i'd be prepared...u know..

       Deeply in the state of a temporary thoughtless apathy I am. So sick of studying I am! Not only can I not see any ending to this torture, but also start I seeing things very few of you mortals can even dream of seeing. Sitting in my refuge cave, I have discovered something groundbreaking. One of the tomes of the  "Antarctic Record"  on the shelf that angrily faces my tired face has a spelling mistake in its very title!!! It says ANTARTIC RECORD. Oh, amazing powers of comparison! There are dozens of tomes , and only one with the mistake!   Gosh, so proud of myself I am.

A curious URL.  Other than that, ladies and gents, congrats on the snow! Viva winter! Josee, you promised to show me where to buy skis. I can't wait. Or, just tell me where it is.

Just my futile attempt to auto-destruct. Nothing too serious. i am ok. I really am. Dude! seriously! I am fine. I am calm as the desert breeze and light-headed as the african monsoon. I am one with the universe. I am the guru of calmness. I am in peace and serenity. No really! I am good. I am fine. Dont u worry about me, no sirree! I am as clear as a whitsle. I am as good as a new pair of boots. I am fine. I am doing very well, thank you for asking. She told me only now, that she happens to have a boyfriend. Oh well, thats nothing. That does not affect me one bit. No sirree! I am as strong as a bull. She wants to be just friends. Hey ! I'm up for that. That sounds good to me ! I am fine. I would be glad to be her  friend  while her  boyfriend  nibbles her ear. Hey , i'm a man. I can take anything. By the way, have I told you I am doing fine? No? Well dude! I am doing great!  I am A ok.   I have also developed an epileptic twitch in the left eye.   Cheerios!!

You know when.. :)  I'm tired. I'm going home. Fuck dynamics. (wow, that has a double meaning :). If anyone has any ideas for tonight, come on over.

       To start welcome to all the new members of this blog. You'd better write some good stuff here (just kidding). This information may be useful to Roman and all those who are intersted. We are not going to the states for the New Year (or at least most of us). We are partying in Montreal, and probably going skiing the week-end after the New Year's Eve to Laurentides. So Roma, it would be nice to see you there if you can make it. If anyone is interested, post your concern about it and we will evaluate your application. I'll post more precise information later, unless somebody does it before me. So I hope you guys are all finished soon with your exams.  P.S. I totally agree with the mathematical proof given below.

       You know, TyGoN, I think you're right. They're evil. They fuck with your head. Especially those self-sufficient and yet badly attention-dependent sluts with high ambitions and strong beliefs... They make me feel nauseous. Ah, whatever. Sorry, it was quite a morning today :).   My differential equations test is in an hour, and I'm out of my basement cage. Don't wish me anything. I'm ready. I slept well. I am prepared, relaxed and confident. Yeah, no shit I am.  On Wednesday night, four people from this blog went out to drink and dance to some place I have a great trouble remembering the name of. It was cool, but the timing was sort of bad. It's finals time, you know.   As you probably noticed, this post makes almost no sense. I'm just releasing the tension before the test. So, you may go about your own business right about... now. No, not yet.... now! Go! What the hell? Why are you still staring at me???   And yeah, I finally asked her phone no. But it got erased in my phonebook somehow. Oh well, I'll ask again.  P.S. Good job Roman! Way to go, man! Way to go.

       Congrats Russo! I've never had any doubts about you. Well.. maybe just a few :). You'll pass the interview if you finally get a haircut and try not to swear. Show them your pics too :)).   TyGoN: excellent proof! Which course is that for? Looks like the Fundamentals of Macroevil Microanalysis. And, most importantly, why are you so pissed off at women all of the sudden? Hey, I barely recognized you that day in the metro. Is Concordia treating you well? By the way, you people have the best pizza over there.  Jouejoue: As for female population, I can see four names on the list, but we haven't heard anything from those peolpe for months. Audrey's on the list two, but I guess she is either too lazy to bother or thinks we're too pathtic for her :) Cheers.

       I am sttrrrraiiigghht! No, I am NOT in the closet. I am openly straight. I realize it's not cool to be straight these days, but I am straight. Hm... straight, straight, straight. Man, that sounds so straight its' unbelievable. Sometimes I think I'm too straight. But, as straight as I can be, I am open to adventures. Straight adventures. I suppose it's straightened out now.  Phew!

       Let me start off by saying it's a great honour to become a part of Team Vlad. Be assured I will not let you all down when we make the secret sign and assemble into a gigantic robot that shoots lasers from its eyes to fight off radioactive dinosaurs. Man, those pesky radioactive dinosaurs. A word of introduction, I'm Ben, Vlad's second roommate, once a Vanier Computer Science student, until I walked out of class with my trusty vodka flask after the teacher started reciting binary values one by one ("so, as you see, this is 1-0-0-0-1-0-1-0...the next one is..."). I've jumped from one tech job to the next, passing through and leaving most of the top telecom companies, before spending a year as a tech director in a small web design firm and going freelance when it closed. I'm aiming to return to Vanier next september to wreak havoc upon the unsuspecting masses' sanity and corrupt the girls from the christian club. I have a thing for sarcasm and cynicism, and a theory that everyone is bisexual deep inside. Vlad only admitted me so I could point the fingers he couldn't...*evil grin*  Til next time, enough useless blabbing...

       Alright, ladies and gents. Please welcome the two new members of this fine blog: BEN and JOSEE. They are fully qualified to participate, since both of them studied at Vanier at some point of their lives.  BEN is one of the two people I live with. He is a web-designer and a very disciplinned person to whom it takes absolutelly no effort to get up before 2 pm. He's gonna tell you the rest.  JOSEE is a friend of ours. I've met her about three times. She dances, sings and does many other interesting things.  In case you're wondering... normally, I wouldn't ever think of bringing these people here due to their dangerous potential to suddenly make this place cool. But it's 3 AM, the plastic bottle of brandy is empty, and we have nothing to do but discuss kinky stuff listening to Depeche Mode.   So, Ben [aka Loki], you finally have an occasion to bring your wise word to the masses. Josee [aka joseita], welcome to the sissyfight paradize. Bring it on!  P.S. If you ever happen to read the archives, remeber to read bottom-to-top. Otherwise it doesn't make sense.

       Yeah, no shit Andrei. It's pitty that you don't get inspired DURING the test, as opposed to when it already passed [away]... along with your *boat*. Sucker. Don't worry though - you'll get another chance to test your *boat* again... in the spring waters... of the next semester.

       it's an interesting feeling after you have submitted your exam... It's like... as if you made a paper boat and let it flow down the stream caused by the spring rains on some street nearby. You made that little boat, and it's there, it's flowing, rasing dry last-year's leaves and parts of smoked cigarettes that melted out from the under the snow. You cann't help your boat, it's there, it's in the stream. You don't know when it will  sink and you hope that it would flow far; that it would flow forever... But it will sink and it's not up to you to deside if it went far enough. Yet, it's up to you to face the concequences. If it sank too early, then it was a bad boat. It's your falt. You made it. And imagine if there is a kid beside you who is watching your boat flow... If it will sink, then you suck in his eyes. And you better have another piece of paper to make a new better boat. But you don't have anymore paper. And you suck even more. He won't forget that... He barely knows you. And he knows that you suck...at making boats.   Imagine now that there are a group of people watching you. And those people love you respect you. And they also know that if your boat sinks then you suck. If it does, then they won't look at you the same way again untill they forget. You might be a good guy, but they love ones who make good boats. Too bad, they are not somebody off the street. They love you and respect you. Yet, you might suck. What can you do?  You can pray and drag your ass to the library and study. Because if you suck, there is no place for you in this world.

       alright,   Hmmm. I see Roma that you can't go to US. that kinda sucks. It also sucks that Vlad can't go.   Well, for those of you who are willing to go, well, we are making the reservations tonight or tomorrow. So I guess that it would be something like dec30 to jan1 up state NY, something like 1.5 hour drive from MTL.  It's going to be a chalet and skiing there. Maybe the chalet will have a pool and a jacuzzi, I'm not too sure.   people who are going so far: Annie and  me, that you know. People you don't know are from US Dima, Andrei, Ben; from Canada: Pascal, Annie-Marie. (all of the people that you don't know are chess players)  people who are interested in going, but I still need to have a confirmation are Evgueni and Audrey, Katy(my sis), Janna, Lili, and Donovan.   The total cost for the trip would be 150$US all included. i.e. chalet, ski, food. Transportaion from MTL will be provided by car either by Pascal or my sis or Donovan.  So if there are anybody else who want's to join in, you are welcome.   Take care, Andrei  P.S.  Roma, what is your status in Canada, maybe you'll be able to get a visa to the states?!

       OK guys. I think... count me out.  Even if the prices are the same, we still have to get there somehow, and we need food and drink and all that. Way too much to be taken care of. And it's much farther away than, say, St. Sauveur. I'm kinda not comfortable with waisting 150 bucks for spending a day in the car just to get drunk in the US. No offence. It's not just money. See y'all.  Later

       O.k. I checked out the prices posted by Andrei. It seems that all the prices are about the same as here in Quebec. So it really doesn't matter where we're going. Yesterday, Andrei and I talked about New Hampshire. Apperently, it costs 30$ U.S. per person per night. It sounds perfectly fine with me, because as I said the prices are the same as here. Someone needs to do the reservations, and for that we need a for sure confirmation from everyone whose interested. So please post your confirmation or let's call eachother. Our suggestion was to go from 30th of December to 1st of January. So please let me or Andrei know as soon as possible. Roma, I think you wanted to come. Am I right? Here are the links about places in Quebec.  http://www.bonjourquebec.com/francais/cms/hebergement/921053.html http://www.bonjourquebec.com/francais/cms/hebergement/905069.html http://www.bonjourquebec.com/francais/cms/hebergement/900018.html http://www.bonjourquebec.com/francais/cms/hebergement/914061.html http://www.bonjourquebec.com/francais/cms/hebergement/854810.html http://www.bonjourquebec.com/francais/cms/hebergement/6721438.html  later

       Late responce. Andrei, Germany doesn't have programs to study in English. Some of the Scandinavian universities do however. I was mistaking. Now I'm really considering to go to Europe next year too. I'm thinking either England or France. I have untill Feb 15th to apply. So I think I'll go for it and then who knows?. So which one of the two would you people suggest to me. And, Andrei, where do I find out about the Quebec government giving money?

       Heh, fun, fun, fun!!!  The process requiring the most precision in our lab is putting one's feet on the desk while avoiding flipping the oscilloscope over, because when the oscilloscope lies on the side [or on the floor], the x-axis becomes y-axis, which in turn introduces considerable [and very  mean ] deviations into one's measurements.   "And these drunken idiots will build bridges and design spacecraft."

       Welcome to Analytical Chemistry. In today's lab and the labs for the rest of the semester, you will come to understand that 0.01 percentage deviation from the expected result will be penalized for 1 mark of 6 for results. every increment of 0.01 away from the expected result will result in further penalization till the mark of 0 for your lab report. Therefore, remember that you are not allowed to have higher heartbeat or pulse. You are not allowed to micropipette and think about anything else at the same time. You do not try to relieve your itch or pain anywhere. You do not bother to look at anyone else and read your buret while taking its measurement. You clean your glasses to avoid distance from desired result on your graduated cylinder. You measure your substances to nearest thousandth of a decimal. Please refrain from all moisture around the lab to avoid product loss. Dry your palms and your skin. If you sweat naturally, please use tar on your skin to block your pores. These are simple instructions to avoid result deviation. remember that failure in lab result will mean a failure in the course. There are 5 labs. Have fun.   Breathing is optional. I hope you enjoy ur session.

       I wouldnt believe the no experience needed thing. Get some knowledge about PCR, and DNA isolation . not hard. They'll probably tell you to move bottle from one place to another, and switch bases and solutions.Thats what RNA isolation and PCR amplication is. Move, wait, change, out, move wait. Get some lessons with micropipettes. They might give you some tutorials. Have fun.

       I like the zero-constant thing. It's pretty deep.  As for the history, I don't think anyone should avoid commenting on that. History is not holy. You should not hold your breath when thinking about it. If it's wrong, it's wrong. True, we can't do anything about it, but we should not blindlessly agree with whatever happened. Humanity has an inherent condition of picking wrong geniuses that tends to fuck it up every now and then. 226 million of silent people = mass psychosis, a desperate dream that lasted for 74 years and is thankfully over. Think about the symbolism:  226 million of silent people . 226 tonnes of dynamite waiting for a spark.   Russia is a country with an unpredictable past.

       Laws on Life:  If anything can go wrong, it will.   If there is a possibility of several things going wrong, the one that will cause the most damage will be the one to go wrong. Corollary: If there is a worse time for something to go wrong, it will happen then.   If anything just cannot go wrong, it will anyway.   If you perceive that there are four possible ways in which something can go wrong, and circumvent these, then a fifth way, unprepared for, will promptly develop.   Left to themselves, things tend to go from bad to worse.   If everything seems to be going well, you have obviously overlooked something.   Nature always sides with the hidden flaw.   Mother nature is a bitch.

       I know that's a little late, but I want to post it anyway. So that at least it would be officially recorded somewhere. Last Saturday, I competed in Longueuil. Heidi and I took 3rd place in standard dances and made the finals in Latin. For the first time we kicked some serious ass. And we'll continue doing more of that in the times to come. Now, I'm just wandering: does it have anything to do with my partner's breaking up with her boyfriend?

Anyhow, there is nothing more to post. And I'm looking foward to the new design of this site. Hopefully, it will work with Netscape.

       I think the time spent studying is irrelevant in your case, Andrei. Your (academic) success is  largely  dependent on the percentage of female species in the library. Furthermore, your (overall) success  entirely  depends on... the inhabitance density of the aforementionned species at school in general. Think carefully before you take that as a compliment :).   Don't look for too much coherence in any case. I'm allowed to write  ingenious  nonsense, too, you know...  Yeah, by the way, where's  RUSSO ??? I need somebody to bark with [at] :). Come on, Igar, did you just give up on us altogether? How's life?   Another thing.  This place is going to turn 1 year old soon. Do you think we need to do something special? Like assembling all the (active) members together somewhere? Opinions?

Anyway, whatever. Dancing is cool and I like it.   As for ingenious thoughts... While going for a walk today, I figured out an important mathematical relationship between marks at school and everything else. It is:     GPA=T*(MA)    where GPA is the grade, T is time spent studing and MA is not 'mass and acceleration' as most of you might think, but MA is metnal ability, which can be any real value from 0 to 1. Farther, T&MA are both functions of two variables 'I' and 'N'  where 'I' is the interest in a particulat subject and 'N' is the need to study it.   To make this formula accurate and universally valid, one has to trust his/her/its conciousness and honesty and be aware of 'external factors' that constitue the uncertainty of such calculation.   for further information please refere to my research site: www.myass.qc.ca

       if you did refer to www.myass.qc.ca and you found that this site does not exist, try pressing the 'refresh' button and keep on doing so untill you reach the site in question (keeping track of how many times you have pressed 'refresh')  Now, when you finally realized that there is no such site, and you have pressed 'refresh' for more than 5 times, you can definitely put 0 for the value of MA in the formula mentioned above and calculate you GPA with a 200% accuracy :)

       Right! No shit, who do we got here! A fucking dancer, private Merengue. You can come over to my dance school and fuck "your" teacher. O.k. don't take it bad or anything, but in order to call yourself my "kollega" you need a few more years (say about 50). As to my popularity as a dancer, you will never succeed in taking it away, once again, because it will take you some time. Oh yeah, Andrei, I didn't know that Audrey is that good for you. I mean now she's gonna have to take a few steps down to "reach your level". And if you want to compete, gosh, I will laugh my ass of when I see you wearing make-up. Finally, don't you change your nick name. Or do you want us to be alike even here on vladster? But don't worry, I like you anyways, it's just funny what you wrote. So, what's with up dancing, everyone seems to be so into it now. Vlad, are you getting any better?  P.S. One last thing, Andrei. I've always believed that people do professional ass shaking in other circumstances (let's not get to dirty here). So if that's what you want to compete in, then... I'd rather keep those issues personal.

That was sooooooo freak'n damn sweet :))   We've learned *TANGO* and a Hispanic dance that I don't know how to spell. I mean Audrey is a good partner, hmmm... she is good, hmmmm, just a little more practice needed to get to my level, but she is fine :P.  And Jeka... I didn't really want to give you competition in your popularity as a dancer, as well I didn't really want to win any of your future trophies in dance turneys, but you see.... :)) Remo asked me if I want to compete and I said maybe, so soon *kollegga* :)) Audrey and I will see you and Hidy* on the dance floor!!  (if Audrey will be good enough) (huh!)   So take care!! And prepare to some professional ass shaking!  Jis! Should I change my nick name now or something?! hehe

       Check this out!!    AUTOnomy concept vehicle are sandwiched in the skateboard-like chassis, and the application of a new technology eliminates foot pedals, the instrument panel and the steering column.    http://www.gm.com/company/gmability/environment/products/ adv_tech/autonomy_design_010702.html   AUTOnomy is the first vehicle designed from the ground up around a fuel cell propulsion system and the first to combine fuel cells with x-by-wire technology, which allows steering, braking and other vehicle systems to be controlled electronically rather than mechanically.   http://www.gm.com/company/gmability/environment/ products/adv_tech/autonomy1_010702.html  Basically the car will turn or stear by speeding up or slowing down one of the four wheels. Cool huh?! GM presented this hybrid yesterday in at the North American International Auto Show. There is more stuff at the GM's site, I gave the address above.

       Andrei, first congrads on your 2nd place man. Of course, you are still not as good in chess as I am for example. So I don't think that it's a bad result for a beginner as you. Second, I'm all for Vancouver. It's been a long time I wanted to go. Let's plan it and make it, even if "are" going to Cuba in the summer. Skiing? Not a bad idea, but in two weeks I have a competition so I can't. Maybe this week. We'll see. And finally, are you seriously gonna take dance classes? 'Cause Audrey can't wait anymore.

       Ok, the new champion is not that of a dork. He is ok, I feel sorry for him at some aspects, but he is fine. I was just mad yesterday that I didn't win. Oh well, I didn't even expect to come second, or moreover to tie for the first. Anyway, now I came to realize that I'm just empty; I did what I wanted to do and now there are no more goals left that I can think about. I mean I know that you don't care, but I don't care that you don't care. Anyhow, what about going skiing some next week-end or something? By the way, anybody interested to go to Vancouver over the summer just for fun? No, no, not by bike or anything of that kind. I'm serious and Ev and Vlad and Audrey don't give me this funny look, it's not as mad as swimming to Cuba. I mean we'll visit Vancouver and then take a short trio to the montains. Huh?! :)

       Alright, well, hi everybody.  Basically, I tied for first with that dorky guy. Then I lost in the playoffs, so officially I'm second place in Canadian Junior Chess Championship.  Not bad, although there were no trophies just  money prices, so I guess I don't have a proof of my result. Yet you guys can check it on www.chess.ca or www.chessmanitoba.com if interested.   Besides that, I'm going to see the city tomorrow and I'm coming back on Tuesday night. So see you all soon! Take care.  P.S. I might go see some curling game tomorrow, how exciting!! :)) (it's the national sport in Manitoba) P.S.S. I can't belive that I did actually not bad in this tourney, considering my mood and state of mind when I came here. And now I'm just dead tired.

       A little recap on the most recent week-end at Dasha's chalet.   Upon arrival we truly enjoyed some Evgueni made sausage with rice (at list some of us). Of course the night unfolded into the usual drinking process followed by a snowfight between some members of our crew. At about 5am silence took over due to Vlad's falling asleep on the couch and not telling anyone that it actually unfolds. As a result two people were sleeping on the floor. The next major event was the skiing on Mont St-Sauveur. It was quite an experience because a few people fell on their asses quite often. Who were those people? Sorry, I can't tell you this. The hottest point was the after skiing getting high on BINACA, brought in by David. Man, these are some serious drugs. (for those who don't know, it's a breath refreshner). In the middle of the night, having had enough BINACA, some of us decided to make a dance competition. So who do you think was the best? We ended the trip with cleaning up the chalet at 9am on Sunday and meeting Dasha's parents. We then went home and are now all safe.  This is a general overview. There are some important conversations which we had to be posted, but I'll leave this to someone else. If missed out any important details please feel free to correct me.

       Andrei, see it this way. This is a little something I like to think of whenever someone beats me at anything. Sure, he may be an asshole, and a dorky asshole shouldn't be able to beat you, and sure, he may win the tournament, but there's one thing you have to take into consideration, very seriously: he is most assuredly a virgin, and will probably be for the next 10 years of his life, until he hangs himself in his mother's basement. Seen from this angle, things look a whole lot better...  BlackLeatherJacketPimp? BrownLeatherburgertrio?

       Hey Mulanda. Yeah, the biochem chicks are special alright. Not as special as the Special Olimpics, but they got their own thing :)  Anyway. I'm here, in University of Winnipeg in Winnipeg. It sucks. It's cold. The weather reminds me of my native city in Siberia. People are nice here. The university is full of all kinds of chicks, but I'm too busy with the tournament and I'm not in the mood for making friends. By the way, did I tell you: "I hate chess"? Well now I did. I just lost a game to some  tapete de merde de tabarnak   who is a small arrogant dork from Toronto with no friends and no social skills. He is an asshole, but that's enough. I may as well say that I'm an asshole, because I couldn't beat him. Now he is going to be the next champion. He is fuckn lucky!! He didn't beat anybody, people just lost to him. And now he played against all the top players and  they  lost to him, and he will most likely win the tourney now.   Anyhow, I'm pissed, and at the same time I don't care. I just want to go back to Mtl and not to have anything to do with chess again. So far it caused me only trouble. Man, I still have 3 more games to play.

Everybody got pissed drunk, including myself, which I regret to some extent. You know, the usual stuff. I don't know if I caused any dammage, but if I did, sorry Josee. Other than that, Happy New Year to everyone. I hope that the resolutions that you've made for yourselves will be realized. Andrei, I wish you to kick some ass in Winnipeg. So, may the new year start with a victory for you.  Once again, Happy New Year people and love you all.

Happy New Year, and have a great fuckin' time everyone.  As for Dec 31, it was curious, the most interesting thing being all the hugging and french-kissing with complete strangers on the street. People seemed to have been freed from some kind of cage or something... Happy fuckin' St.Valentine's. Provided that's what they really feel, why not express their feelings every night of the year (girls that is)?! Other than that, I am eagerly waiting for first-hand accounts of what happened at Josee's place during my being absent consumming another bottle with some other people :). I know pretty much everything (I also sort of prevented another small incident from happening), but I don't want to follow the Simpson's philosophy and make people feel bad about themselves...

Who wants a piece of me, next motherfucker in my way gets it, that's my new year's resolution...  But happy new year to all the non-motherfuckers!

       hey!! i don't know whether that was a joke or simply a reflection of your intellect but i need an explanation for that ridiculous  picture Vlad... As for the main topic at hand, here is my take: African elite athletes are rarely involved in doping and guess what: they are winners....To say that all countries do it but only a few are  targetted makes me sick...I have never been in Russia, but i don't believe that the government puts pressure on the athletes, and even if they do  is it not the athlete's responsibility to say no !!! The IOC has to do some restructuring i agree but i think it starts with the athletes first, most of them are just a bunch of losers in search of endorsement deals...

       See, Fais, I think you're missing the big picture. Athletes are slaves. It is the case with ANY country's team. In most sports there is no discussion whether to use or not to use doping. Everybody does it: US, Russia, Norway - every fucking athlete is on dope, largely because they have no choice. It's just a matter of how to do it and not get caught. I think it's not enough to just target athletes. You're going to ruin people's lives for nothing.  The whole system needs change. What IOC should do is to find a way to penalize the people responsible for pressuring athletes to use doping (although I can't immediatelly see a way to do that).

       Vlad is very much right. It is possible that the drug has worn out. Just a like a flintstone vitamins that people take. Its durability in body does not exist for a long time. If you test the athlete after the race, the "leftovers' will show up as normal body enzymes, and hence will escape the eyes of testers. testing should be done anytime whenever is wished. Screw their psychological pain, its their fault!! Its like catching a murderer shooting a kid, and not wanting to arrest him in his marriage. Damn it, its his fault.   Testing has to be done much more often, and the science of detection has to surpass the science of enhancement, though it is unlikely . I mean, we did invent the bulletproof jacket after the gun. and the armor after the sword. So yes, should we sympathize for the athlete if she or he is caught with drugs? Hell no! Make them pay, they knew the rules.   enhancement drugs are supported by people who are too lazy to practice and sweat hard, or by people who cant get results even if they try. Well, too bad, try thumb wrestling instead.  thats all i got to say now.

       I don't agree, i think the whole principle of "boosting drugs" and blood doping is based on increasing an individual's hematocrit which is the percentage of  red cells in the blood..Therefore the number of red blood cells will not dramatically decrease until a few days after the race, It therefore does  not really matter whether one takes the test before or after the race...the drug is no supernatural power that will simply evaporate at the end of the race.

       Disagreed. In such race as 50K, just to take samples after the finish is not enough. The effect of the drug wears out during the race. After a few hours of extreme physical strain the athlete's blood might not contain the substance which might have given him a considerable boost in the beginning. Correct me if I'm wrong, Faisal.

       As for when is the best time to take doping.  It should be taken in advance way before the competition and after, as soon as you're finished. That's how Sports Canada is going to test you if you are competing in national events. As soon as you're done they ask you to go with them, and then they watch you peeing to make sure the sample is yours :)  I think taking dope control after a race or a match is done is enough, really.  You are evil Vlad, psychological pain and stuff sound sick :)

       I'll only care about the olympics when they legalize performance drugs (as well as recreational), and why not, in the near future, grafted muscle and tissue or cyborg implants? Either way, my not caring much for the olympics saves me from a month or two of boring debate about "fairness" when all people are really doing is backing up their favorites (oh, my, he was the best, it must be foul play if someone else was better!)...Wake me up when the olympics are somewhat like Rollerball (the old movie from the 80's, the new one sucks...), or when they introduce "Chainsaw Death-Match" as an event...  Mmh, talk about olympics, cool quote from  urlLink Something Awful , about the future of the olympics: "2012 - Scandal rocks the Special Olympics when it is revealed there never ever was a Mount Special Olympus. The contestants are then rounded up like cattle and never seen or heard from again."  Let it be, people, let it be...

       It makes perfect sense to take samples  as late as possible , so the skiers don't have time to get onto something after the check-up. It would make even more sense to check the athletes 10 minutes before the start and then take them out  during  the race, thus inflicting as much psychological pain as possible.   Man! Don't you think doping defeats the whole fucking point of the competition? Obvious, eh?  In the case of Lazutina, she is not the one to blame. There was a tremendous pressure from the gouvernment and the president particularly to bring Russia to the first spot no matter what. The athletes had no choice whatsoever. They had to do whatever they were told to.  It's not about sport anymore. It has never been, in case you didn't know. Last time it was about sport and genuine fitness, was back a few thousand years ago in Greece. Today, if you want to see fair competition and pure excitement, go watch my younger brother play water-polo at Claude Robillard.

       Why cool me down?  What I didn't like is the fact that doping control must have been organized pretty sloppy. Getting results 15 minutes before the start ? This is wierd. Why did they need to wait so long. Poorly organized (which is strange, this is not some stupid regional contest) doping control just harmed teammates who were tested negative.  It has nothing to do with justice or anything like that. I'm pretty sure that just about everyone uses some kind of doping in competitions of such level. At least in sports requiring inhuman efforts, like 50k race or weightlifting. Just wait till genetic dopes will become available, and see how suddenly all world records will be improving.

To the absolute surprize and bitter disappointment of the few Americans in the room, everybody went "BOOOOO!!!!" when the American team rolled out to the ice and "GO MOTHER RUSSIA!!!" when the Russians did. :)  Goh, Canaduh!!!

       As the long tradition of the Olympics in the cold version was coming to Salt Lake City, everybody silently foresaw history in happening. There were a number of controversies that sparked word fights. one side blaming the other of setup. Let us then stop there and rewind our story.   The Winter Olympics is a fairly new tradition. Can anyone tell me why? Well, throughout the long history of summer Olympics, the most successful teams in the summer Olympics were hardly the Europeans, they were only North Americans, few Asians, Africans and some South Americans. The Winter Olympics itself was built to show a country's performance through the sports it exceled in all by winning and having the Olympics seal branded.Not to mention, that most of the industrialised countries are winter nations. It was much better than it being ridiculised infront of other countries at the traditional games. The Winter Olympics was a little arena for the countries who couldnt despite all, ever get medals in the regular Olympics because they were always tormented by blistering cold and not enough money for their athletes to train in the adequate environment. And let's face it, the summer Olympics are much more exciting than the though spectacular Winter cousin.  Then now back to the controversies at hand. First, my impartiality is justified,  for my country, bangladesh, participates in neither Olympics, because it costs the country's gross revenue to purchase a jersey. That said, then this is my hand , as sport lover and an Olympics admirer.   Hand 1: If it is new to anyone that this is the first judging controversy in skating, then may they keep silent and mumble to their own satisfaction. European judges have already been reprimanded in the past for siding with the skater's nationality. Let's face it, you dont want any country to win a sport that was made for you to win in. Then why was the false and blatently apparently misjusdging never taken to a higher level? The location is the answer. While most events occur in European cities because of sponsorship and ability, to accuse a country against itself is not highly recommended. Skaters have often complained about biased judging, but the ears were not interested. The Salt lake location was excellent. Excellent media coverage as well as the silent biased Amercians. Now there should be no controversy. Everyone should say, "finally!" It has finally happened. Justice has finally been rendered. The french judge admitted to partiality and spoke of other judges involved. Why is there than a controversy? To the eyes of all, the male Russian skater did go for a walk when he was supposed to jump! Irina slutlskaya did go weak in the knees and did look like she was pulling a Michael Jackson after her jump.   Hand 2: The Russian team complains about a bad referee and demands retribution. And they still continue to do so. However, are they blind?? Women's team Canada won their gold medal match where they were 11 powerplays against them all thanks to the American referee!!! Until the games they had 10 in total. 11 in one game!! But they won! Because they played superbly well. Maybe if they would have played as the female team they wouldnt complain. To say that the referee was the cause of their loss is wrong. The Canadian female hockey team is proof of so.  Hand 3: The final reason for Russia complaining is that it does not feel comfortable being ranked low in an event in which they have invested a lot of time and money. Russia is classed as either the first or second country in medal standings for the last Winter Olympics all the way from the beginning. Russia realizes that they might have not done well as they had expected and therefore, refuses to believe that their athletes might have underperformed. Therefore, they rely on the memories of the cold war days and bring them up saying to everybody that the whole world is against them.  God knows what would happen to a non-Russian winner chess player in Russia. Watch out Mulanda.   Last hand: The only controversy I am angry about is the following. The short track speed skating should not have gone to the American. Korea rightfully won it. There is investigation going on. I will be sincerely pissed if the Korean is not given is his gold.   So last points?  1) Americans side with Canadians as long as it is fight against Russians.  2) Finally judging partialities have been uncovered.  3) Russians always think that when nothing goes their way, it means that the West is against them. In cases, it occasionally is true. 4)Russians have hard time admitting failure. Blaming is easier. 5)Canadians are the little bastards, laughing behind Americans watching them duke out against Russians.  6)I am hungry  My two cents.  Tygon.

       Hey Mulanda! Yeah, the spring break is just around the corner. The midterms are over. For now. I got two more right after the break. Just had my circuits test - a royal screwup. I got negative capacitances, real-domain reactances and shit like that. So much for slacking off. It's disgusting. But I'm happy it's over. Anyone up for a drink or two tonight? Anyone up for a nine-day 9am-12am studying marathon with me?  How's everyone anyway. Concordia dudes, congrats on the end of the break! Hope you had fun; now it's our turn :)). One more thing. I went to the Concordia computer store a couple of days ago and found that it rocks. Imagine: they actually sell customized desktops, the ones for which you can order the components YOU want - a truly remarkable thing unseen at McGill.

       Here is an interesting story. Just before I want to warn you that the following piece of writting is based on a real life experience. So...  There was he as well as there was she. They knew each other for a long time and have been together in a variety of situations (hmm). After some serious obstacle came across between them, they found themselves separated physically and mentally as well. Time went on and communication between those individuals became easy again. So on one of these days he and she met together and finally did "it". What hapenned after, so far is undetremined and God knows when was the next time they came across each other again. The only thing is that he still can't believe what hapenned and is concerned with a couple of thoughts, yet he feels that it was one the best circumstances in which he's been with her. "WHAT THE HELL? "  P.S. Vlad, I'm not sure if this story qualifies for the contest.

       Offence taken, Andrei. I hope you know that coming down to physical remarks is the lowest form of an argument, the one that usually stays in pre-adolescence. Please, don't humilliate yourself like that anymore. At least not in my presence.  It's all cool though. I realize you had to somehow try to recover your stained ego. :) It's not the extravagance that I despise. Hell, I love extravagance. It's not a matter of what you mysteriously called " pompessness " either. The thing is that I am severely allergic to any trace of melodramatic pretentiousness [or, simply speaking, obnoxious corniness]. As you might have found out lately, women rarely like that too. Oh, can I please smile now? Thank you :)))))  Mind you, I can tolerate many things, but please, make it fucking funny at least! Learn to  make  a joke, pal. Otherwise, be damned and burn in the flames of my dictionary browsing skills!!! Amen.   P.S.

Anyway, I knew that you never had the guts to accept something extravagant relative to random people; yet I wasn't aware that you could have such low self esteem while making up a conversation with a girl. To make you feel better, I should modify the  that really tall friend though... very cute.   to "an overgrown guy with a constant malcontent look on his face". (No offence) Learn to take a joke, pal. :) I didn't really want to shame you this way.   As for Ben... Bouf! You're funny. P.S.

Super-Engineera-Tron-MegaBot, Phoenix Formation Science Ninja Happy Meal, go! ***they fight*** Second girl: *evil laugh* Hahahahahahaha! While you thought I was a mindless zombie, I trained to become a mindless zombie cyborg ninja whore! ***they fight*** Engineer: Fools! You cannot hope to defeat the supreme bridge-building righteousness contained in my super engineer crystal! Engineer-crystal, mega morph transform double shrink expand, super-ultra mode! ***everything gets bigger*** ***they fight***  Will engineer man-sama defeat the evil Psykology sisters? Or will he simply make up a story to pretend he did? Find out in the next episode of "Engineer Man: The series"...

       When you make up a story, check for logical errors, Andrei.   ... this is my friend, ... , she is in psychology as well.  Engineer (Looking indifferent but thinking: "nice ass"): Hey...  Second girl (Blinking): Hello, nice to meet you.   How could you see her ass while talking to her??? I guess she was really pleased to meet you while walking away and shakin' that aaass. Secondly, really, Andrei,  have you ever seen yourself being indifferent in the presence of a girl, let alone a girl with a "nice ass"... :) Good story line though.  - Hey! - Yeah, whatever, how are you. - Going to the engineering library to study again? - (non of your suckin business) Yeah, sort of, but we're leaving soon. - Is that your friend? - (good guess, duh) Aha. - Is she like... in psychology too? - Aha, but she has a boyfriend. -... -... -... - (walking away) who was that dork? ...looked at me as if he hasn't got any forever. Eewww. - ... I don't know... saw him a couple of times. He says he's in engineering, but I really don't know. I think he just comes to the engineering library to stalk on psychology girls. He has that really tall friend though... very cute. - Shit, why didn't you tell me?? I could have given him some kind of a piercing, full of sophistication and comprehension look or something...    Yeah, Andrei, I AM THOOO THKEAD, iths unbelievable..! NO MORE THALTHA for THITH CUTE BLONDIE OVERTHEAR!!!

       "You are just following the fashon of critisizing Microsoft products. Besides, the age of 13 year speaks for itself. :)"  I am not following any fashion...hell, I love Microsoft, and if you wanna know why I love them just go on their website and see the record number of security advisories released since XP came out...  It's not pointless bitching, Microsoft has a reputation for releasing unfinished products (it took over 2 years for win98 to finally become a stable and viable system, through patches and service packs...), so you wouldn't catch me dead installing one of their products only months after it came out, as anyone with a shred of computer-knowledge will tell you...  Still don't believe me? Why don't you just run a Yahoo search for "Windows XP hacking" and see what comes up...if you want your computer to have more holes than swiss cheese, go ahead and install it...I'll really like you for it... :)

       McGill. A hallway in an engineering building, around 6:00pm. Two joyful girls from psychology U2 accidentally bump into a dead-tired engineering student. He knows one of them and with the other he was exchanging meaningful glimpses for one semester in the library.  Engineer: What's up?! First girl: Nothing much and you? (Giving him a piercing full of sophistication and comprehension look.) By the way this is my friend, ... ,  she is in psychology as well.  Engineer (Looking indifferent but thinking: "nice ass"): Hey... Second girl (Blinking): Hello, nice to meet you.  Engineer: I think I saw you in the engineering library last semester, or something.  Second girl: Yes, we go there pretty often to study. It's quiet and comfortable there. Engineer (Thinking: "sure it is, just like at a market place") First girl (smiling with the same look as before): And we like to analyze the people there, it's so straightforward! Engineer: Thanks. (Turning to the second girl and blowing from nowhere) You know, I think you are a very sensitive person. You must be brilliant and you learn and understand everything very fast. Yet, you are very emotional and moody, that's why the guy you like is not sure about two of you, and mean while you flirt with cute men. But you have good taste.  Second girl (widening her eyes and smiling): how did you know that?!  Engineer (laughing): If I will tell you would kill me.  Second girl (thinking: "he must of spied on me, oh!! or somebody told him about me, ah!! Who?!! He may be a maniac, but he is cute, ehh!"): please tell me, tell me, I promise I won't do anything to you. Engineer: Alright. Well, you see, it doesn't take a psychologist to figure out a person, but it takes an engineer to build a rocket.  Second girl and first girl together (Angrily) How could you?! You are so old fashioned and full of prejudices! How dare you? (Thinking: "bastard! is he wearing Gap?) Engineer(laughing even more): Oh ladies, you are so cute when you are angry! But wrong answer! (Girls-staring at him) You should of said that it doesn't take a rocket to save someone's life or to make someone leave a  depression, but knowledge of psychology does. Take care!  Around 6:10pm, hallway McGill engineering building. Two psychology girls-blinking.

       "And running infinite loops just screws your computer if you don't have Windows XP..."  ...should have been...  And running  windows XP  just screws your computer if you don't have  any common sense and actually install it...   There, now that makes a lot more sense...and before anyone tries to defend Windows XP, why don't you try recovering from one of  many  major crashes it causes (or that will be caused by  any  13 year-old who can run a port-scan...) without DOS to help you out...CMD.EXE, don't make me laugh, what the fuck happened to COMMAND.COM?

Perhaps, but it's a special kind of mirror. What's so special about it? It keeps your reflection long after you're gone. An ordinary mirror shows you what you want to see. This one also shows what you are... to everyone else but you. Think about it tonight. Peace. Power to the people.

       Oh, come on there. Midterms aren't that scary. They are 10% at most. Besides, we have the option of having 100% finals. So, chill everybody. University is a life experience. Let us make it a little less stressful for everyone. Sound hypocritical enough? Oh well, that's me and my melancholic indulgences into the euphoric nature of our existence.

       Nice, my 1st midterm is february 13th. But I don't care(yeah right!). Anyways, I have a competition on Thursday and it's gonna last till Saturday night. All the European and North American hot-shot dancers are coming to Montreal and I'm planning to kick some serious ass there. But strangely enough, today while practicing I felt that there is lots of room for improvement in my dancing. Interesting, why is that? Oh well, whatever happens Thursday I'll try to stay satisfied with my result. Oops. Did I get carried away? (just trying to cheer myself up).

       it was a good week-end. Not productive at all,  fun though. Sartuday night 6/49 dancing and Sunday skiing for 8$ for the lift and 12$ for all ski equipment at a mountain hiegher than St-Saveur and others of that sort. Yee. Now, chilling dead tired in a computer lab (if it is possible to chill here) waiting for 30 mins to pass so I would go to my dance practice. What else? Well, I'm just making you all jalous of my slacking off. Yet, I'm feeling that sufferings are near, because Feb. 14 is my first midterm! Yeeee.

       Hey guys,  well its Sunday evening and  im at Heathers house studying C++  (hey everyone..this is Heather...what's up?? how is university for everyone?..okey..wajdi wants computer back now..so BYE!!) Alright, im back. As I was saying, im here studying C++ trying to get a few of my programs to compile but apparantly one of my programs really did something to Visual Studio and now I have to reinstall it. I think it is because I kept on overshooting my arrays (for anyone who understands the tedious C++ language).   Hey Vlad, not going with the girls was a stupid move, but an understandable one, and kudos on the Will Power to say no. If I were in your position I think I would of said no myself.  Well, its time to go and look over my assembly notes with the time I have left before my beauty sleep. Good bye everyone and have a wonderful day at school tomorrow ;)  l8er dudes

I have 5 courses, and I am enjoying most of them, especially Java. Life on my own is excellent. Jack Daniels is my best friend, well, actually it's his other incarnations, like Absinth and Moskovskaya.  Other news. I was invited by a  friend  of mine to the restaurant tonight. But then she called and offered to go to a chalet with jakuzi (sp?), sauna and swimming pool along with her friends and any three people I would invite with me. I cancelled. Why? Need to study man. Sorry guys, right now you could be slacking off in the sauna with at least five girls (hm... ladies actually), but I had to cancel. I don't think any one of you would go anyway... :)

       Hey guys,    Its been a long time, but im back!!!!!!! :)   How is everyone doing.....How's life at the Big Mac...Im having fun here in Concordia with the crazy C++ teachers and weird assignments we get. I just got a new lab top, its sweeeeeeeet. So Vlad, hows life living on your on? is it all good?    Well, my old computer crashed and I lost 3 years of work. Everything I have done in the past three years is lost because of a trojan that got into my computer. FUN FUN FUN!!!!!! The drive is fried and I am currently using a 540 meg drive on my P2 350....cant wait to get my new system, this half a gig of hardrive space is killing me, its no fun...I tried installing visual studio and the download stopped halfway....that is when I knew I was totally screwed.  How is everyone else doing, you guys having fun? Sure hope so.....Remember, if you ever come across a problem you dont understand, always remember Mr. Jack Daniels is always there to lend a hand. After a few minutes with him, everything makes sense :)  Alright guys, gotta fly, have labs to do, C++ assignments to destroy and tests to study for....l8er dudes :)   -The WAJDI

       Well, well, well. It is now officially 12:54; I've got myself a coffee jar and gracefully sat down in front of my beloved SyncMaster 755.  As much as I despise the word "official"... I am now an official... we are now... anyways, you get the point.  As for the brain cells, let us clearly define an official battlefield with officially proclaimed boundaries. Because our official finals session is just around the corner, and you will (well... I will) need every single one of those mathematically altered cells.  I don't know about that person being a liar or not, but when I say "I am a liar", I usually do it before I actually lie. People don't believe me and think I'm the honestest person alive, which prepares their innocent comprehension apparatus to embrace my next point. I usually top that off with some simple truth, like "the sky is blue", just in case.

       yes in ferro, brothers are genetically different but by a very small percentage less than 0.1 though. much less. In some cases, mutation of one gene is good enough to be a goner. the monkey and human are 97 % genetically identical. Says a lot, doesnt it.  Among humans the differences are very minute.   As i said, the differences are in the lower decimals. Things that seem so different to us such as colour or height and so forth are actually very little details. Very ..VERY.....little details.  You have to know that organisms that perform same bodily functions and operations are almost genetically identical. I say almost because the only genetically identical organism to a human is a clone of himself or his identical twin.

       a question to tygon and mulanda how big is the diffence in genome in brothers? I've read somewhere that mutation in more than 3 genes can be mortal for an embryo, or smth like that.  and that difference between monkey and human is such and such(I don't remember the number, but it's huge). I just wanna know how big difference is among humans themselves.   anyone has a clue? (and don't complain about my ignorance, and lack of proper terms, etc..)

       Hey Wajdi. The spark is pretty cool. I sent you my phone no by email.  Faisal, I read the article, but they moved it somewhere I don't know why. It's not there anymore. Anyway, I found the name of that mad russian scientist very funny. It's more like chinese or mongolian or something of that sort :)...

       Yeah, I'm not sure if Bhatia is still in a coma, but while I was at Vanier, I heard that he was, earlier this spring, due to a car accident.  As to Mr. Kayembe, man you should have taken an English elective :P. By the way, is it true that Kato is going skydiving soon?  off topic:   Life is like a glass of wine. The more you drink from it, the sweeter it gets. Yet, when you are just about to finish, you realize that there is no refil, and you are just not drunk enough...  :)

       I do not fuckin get it!! My last final that I studed my ass off for 5 days  was a the stupidest crap ever. Written by a fuckn French dunkey who can't teach for shit, it was freackin impossible to understand what the fuck was he asking for!!   All my exams are over and (along with my first university year), and I'm damn pissed because some ass-hole, i.e. piece-of-little horses kaka, couldn't pose the questions properly and because half of the material was not part of what was tought in class, and eventhough we all learned it anyways knowing the dumb-short-dicked-egghead the teacher is, the exam was  not even half consistent with the vocabulary used in the class slides and class notes.   "You could find this vocabulary in some reference books upon the subject" the teacher told me after class smiling. Greasy-pussy, do I need to read some more reference books along with my 4 course books already, for an "A Class" as it always used to be called??  Anyway, fuck the dork. If he gets hit by a car and falls into a coma I'll thank the driver who ran over him. And I mean it. (Just as much as I mean it for Bhatia who was hit by a car early this spring and is still in a coma).   Take care people, and have a good ending of the examination period and a great summer!  ~~Peace~~

       Hellow fellas. A few new impressions from VladsterMeister.   I was browsing through the stacks at Chapters on Ste.Catherine the other day and ran into  urlLink this book  called " Taxes for Canadians   for   Dummies. " Hmm... da. Cool.  Also, chapter 2 (p.24) of the pocket manual I am currently reading ("Coping with Excessive Free Time After Finals: form A to Z") says: "The three most important words in time-wasting business are: Movies, Movies, Movies." Well, Audrey and I watched "Changing Lanes" last night. Truly amazing. The best movie I've seen in a long time.  This morning, Audrey (directly), Billy Joe, Salsa-man and I (indirectly) encountered the health emergency system. It's not pretty. Everything is cool now, Audrey is sleeping home.  In other breaking news, yours truly is starting working on Monday. Ew. From now on, all the air disasters involving Boeing 737's air pressure gauges and altimeters can be legitimatelly blamed on VladsterMeister.   Latez doodes.

       Yeah, I clearly remeber blowing that guy into pieces in my journal entry (for which I, of course, got 10/10 and was called a "star pupil" by the teacher thatnkyouverymuch). In the story, it was just a stoopid american highschool kid who was unsatisfied with the way he was taught physics.  I think it's not true that it was Bohr.  Mulanda, dude, you're a fucking looser... just like the rest of us here at McGill being fucked up the ass...

       Hey Mu!!  Failing Anal Chem class....  That's sounds really bad! I mean failing, and not just failing, but a Chem class, and not just a Chem class, but an ANAL Chem class. Jis! And that  matata mingi sana ... Is that what lions roar out when they're out of lubricant? (Just kidding) :)  By the way, do you remember our last English course together? (Sure you do). So the story about a student who showed to his phisics teacher ten different ways of measuring building's hight with a barometer and none of the ways was the one the teacher wanted to hear. Guess what? Apparently, that student was NILS BOHR!!!!!!!! (I heard about this today and not sure for it's trustworthiness, but I'll check it later.)

       Johnny, the word you're talking about is  "buff" . Secondly, I never alter anybody's posts.  On a lighter note, I am done. The last test was actually not bad at all. I think I got at least a B+. It's a good thing I didn't defer it. To sum up, I am now looking at one or two A's, two C's and a B. Bad, but could be worse. I've had waay too much life this semester.   Good luck dudes. When you write those tests, just think of me relaxing somewhere in a park reading a second edition of  "Coping with Excessive Free Time After Finals: form A to Z".

I think AlgeBRA would be a cool BRAnd name for a bra company in Algeria. Don't you think. Do they wear bras in Algeria? Hm... chocolate AlgeBRAs.  Andrei, what's "bouf" anyway?

Just celebrated the end of first four finals with a bunch of French friends in an amazing atmosphere, that was getting into a 'weed' stage as I left, decling an offer to sleep over with a hot blondy in my bed...(I'm not gay. bouf , you won't get it anyway, we're just friends). :) So now it's quite late and feels sweet. I'm actually thinking of going to Genetics test today; sit there for an hour, fill in all the circles on the answer sheet and leave, just to piss all the science students off. :) Oh well. Good night everyone and have fun on your remaning exams. :)

       One exam down, three more to go. Why does Concordia schedule exams on Saturday and so fucking late? Life is not fair is it. I also noticed an increase in the female population of the blog lately and most importantly blogger's anyversary has never been celebrated. All this together with the upcoming ending finals needs a certain amount of alcohol intake (after the finals). Don't you think?

       it's ok. you must've been tired.  I am discovering so much interesting stuff about my courses! It's actually exciting... like this exponential matrix function... gives you all the explicit solutions to a system of differential equations simultaneously! Neat shit! Man, I have been missing so much while skipping those applied linear classes! I love math. Seriously. My Masters will either be in math or comp. sci.   I have decided not to defer the test and bravely confront it tomorrow.  The most important conclusion I can draw in the end of this largely unsuccessful for me academic year is that University is a full-time job. You need to stay here all day. Only then it will be both interesting and rewarding. Truism? Well, it wasn't so obvious to me :)  I think I will kick some ass next year. Yeah sounds painfully familiar, but I do mean it.

        Tygon approaches his lab bench. Someone has left their previous material on the desk. The objects includes a scalpel, a probe and what appears to be a frog.  Tygon rearranges his books and is prepared to set up his Southern Bloting experiment. Suddenly...     -Wrrrrreebit. -ITS ALIVE!!!!!! KILL IT ! KILL IT!  DIE YOU SLIMY FIEND !! REAP  THE BENEFITS OF HELL, FOR YOUR TIME HAS COME!!!!!     Tygon regains his composure, as he stares at his latest accomplishment. There seems to be a different arrangment of the internal organs of a frog. He questions himself on wether it is normal to find a frog's liver away from its body. There seems to be also an increased amount of blood. He concludes that as he calculates the amount which is scattered over his lab coat. He also tries to understand why the scalpel is in his hand, and its blade, half-broken, basks in the aqueous solution of the frog's intestine. Tygon finds himself in an awkward situation and investigates for answers. He inquires next door, and gets an ecology student, also known as a tree-hugger. He brings him to the scene and awaits answers.    - OH FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!!!! NO!!!!!!   SKIPPY!! WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU!!! WHERE'S YOUR.....OH MY ....*gurgles his vomit and spits it out*....your liver...     He then proceeds to vomit and sob. After he regains his senses, he roars out.    - WHO DID THIS??!!!  WHAT THE .....     The hippy realizes that he is talking to an emptiness, for Tygon is far....far....away. As Tygon has reached the basement in his secret hiding place, he realizes two things. One, the experiment can wait. Two, the exams are destroying him.

       Wow, Bill, is this what I think it is? In any case, I'll be there for you (and not only you) at 12:09 PM tomorrow. Put the vodka in the freezer.    NOTE: Bill, aka Josee, aka Joseita, owns a two-room hotel in the McGill ghetto, at which we incidentally (as opposed to accidentally) stay over now and then. The hotel offers free room and sometimes board, and sometimes even more than that.. Reservations are to be made by phone. According to the latest rumors, orgy requests are no longer considered.   Bill went to Vanier, too. Repeatedly. Apparently, quite a few times.   Yes, folks, it will be my last and hardest final tomorrow. I know you've all waited for it.   I will be playing with myself in the Eng. library till it closes or I die (whatever cums first) and in the FDA comp. lab. for the rest of the night.   Anyone wanna drop by and hang out? You're NOT very welcome... but bring loonies for coffee anyway.  Tygon. What's up down there in the frog morgue?

       A leftist (read: communist bullcrap) party of the Russian parlament submitted a new motion for discussion. The motion suggests 1-3 years of imprisonment for engaging in male homosexual activities. Yes, you heard it right. Of course, it won't be passed, but the mere statement makes me spit in disgust. This is one of those times when, even though I'm straight, I'm glad I'm out of there.   Mind you, a similar law had existed since 1930's and was abandoned in 1994. So, if you, by any chance, had male gay sex in Russia before 1994, you risked 3-5 years in prison. :)  http://www.utro.ru/index2.shtml?2002042217113674291

       Heyyo. Tygon is probably having a breakdown right now. Bhahahhhaaahah!  When I asked my math teacher if it were possible for me to cover most of the semester's material in 4 days, I saw a compassionate yet pessimistic spark light up his eyes: "Fucking freshmen; dummies they really do think they're geniuses to skip 90% of classes and still ace the final."   Anyway, he sorta  generally commented  to me on  approximately  what would be on the test. Heh :) life is unfair isntit.  LET THE MORTAL COMBAT BEGIN! IT HAS BEGUN!

       Hey TyGoN, thank you for that. It touched me on the raw (seriously). I think this is what our lives will be all about in a few years. It's hard to find balance between career/school and personal life. Lately, I have been leaning towards the opinion that it's an "either-or" situation. When I try to disprove it, I suck at both.  Make your choice, gentlemen. And for God's sake, somebody, please prove me wrong.

         Freind of mine at the Jewish General invited me to a Friday Bash at McGill Thomson house.  Had a good time.  Had a conservation with a brunette, with the cutest face. She was 15 metres away on a third round table away with the lurking smile and , did i mention the cutest face. She crossed my eyes, devoured me by her stare and I felt helplessly weakened by her. You know, the little type with  cute glasses, dark brown hair, and a nice white tone of skin. I watched her, and she tried to tell me something, was she signaling me to come over? or was she cracking her neck?  she then,  so I thought , cracked her neck again. But nobody cracks their neck again , not on the same side!!!! She then proceeded to excuse herself from her table, and come out of the room. That was my queue to go. However, my friend's friend jenny thought that it would be nice to talk to me about her research project, since she was sitting beside me. I itched almost to leave my chair, and meet the goddess of brunettes as ,I observed her waiting outside!!!!  Damn shut up , Jenny!!! For the love of God, Jenny, shut up, I was thinking.  i could not leave my chair, for she was with her research supervisor, the very reknowned Dr. Blaistak. My friendship was an insurance for my success. Leaving in front of him, as his student talked to me would be an insult. But the brunette was waiting.  Throughout jenny's babbling, I once noticed that the brunette disappeared. She went to the bathroom, I guessed. She then came out, stared at me, waved her arms, shrugged her arms and returned into the room, went to her table, took her jacket,  told everyone , she had to leave, left the room, and left Thomson house.  I remained in awe.   And Jenny ended saying, "..so that's why Beta mercaptoethanol is essential for blotting, especially after using SDS. " i answered, that's nice Jenny, thats nice.  Its weird, I had an enitre conversation with the brunette , but we never spoke a word. As I sipped my Guiness while walking down MetCalfe, I just hoped I was smarter.

       Oh my god, Bibi. Last night, I was rehearsing for a persuasive speech to decline your kind invitation. Listen, people; I am really dying. There is so much work, you won't buh-lieve. My finals add up for a total of 330%. I am hopelessly behind in Linear, JAVA and Measurements. Also, my account statement shows a  highly  negative balance. Besides, when did I manage to become so important? There are like... 956257 of you people. You won't even notice my not being there.  Who's the nice woman anyway?

       Some interesting news. Russian ministry of education deems there are too many people in Russia with a university degree. They are going to try to reduce the number of universities and university students in the future.  I guess that should also take care of the brain drain :).  http://www.5ballov.ru/news/edu_rus/index.shtml?2002/04/02/16423

       I always knew this place was insane.   Anyway, how are you people? Today is a very special day. I am at school before afternoon. School actually feels good in the morning - everyone should try and visit it one day. There's all those poli sci girls "dropping by" the engineering building to "grab" a "coffee" and stuff... Hm, yeah.  On the other hand, it's sort of nice not to be single again. Again, heh? It's been a while :).  Think about it, gentlemen: the summer begins in 3 weeks. 3 weeks of sleepless crazy geekyness, and we're free like birds. I foresee a magnificent summer. Lot's of camping and biking. Not that anyone of us will actually do that, but it would be nice to, wouldn't it?  I shall now leave you suffering in your pre-finals misery. Stoke's Theorem help us all..

        What about the same problem as  A student is provided with three 2-ohm resistors.  How many different total resistances can be produced if all three of the resistors are used in a circuit?   but with n resistors? (make them also 1-Ohm each for simplicity)  I spent 2 weeks working on it and couldn't get it ... any clues ?  I am reading a book on Quantum Mechanics now... Amazing... Linear Algebra all over again but really cool....

       Now, the second part of the story... I feel kinda tired and exauhasted so I'll get straight to the point. There was a MILF travelling with us with her husband and little Stiffler, yet to become Mister :). I'll drop the details of this encounter and just say that most of the time during the tournament on Sunday and Monday I spent with the sister of the one of the player's (the 24 yr. old) TALKING.   I also was training and yelling at my student when I didn't like his games, as well as training other kids. In the evenings I was riding around the city with the newly acquainted Noufy friends. And one of them was... hmmm... anyway... nice. We've excanged e-mails and phone numbers. Besides that we didn't do much. There was also the nationals for the Syncro sweeming for juniors, so that was quite cool too (to watch).   To conclude, my student finished 3rd, the team got 2nd (Ontario first) and the worst thing was that Ontario beat Quebec's record for team score of 96/108 by 97/108. That sucks. The record was standing since the 70's. :(  But in general, I'm pleased with my trip. Besides, the chick that I liked is coming to Montreal later on this summer and what's more, is that her dad has a very important position at a university there in the faculty of medicine.   That's it, I'm out, if you need any more details, well, too bad :). But as bad as it may sound, I'm back to being myself at the tournaments as I have been long time ago :)

       Mulanda: there are four possibile total resistances: 6, 3, 2/3 and 4/5 Ohms.  OK, Fais, I get your argument. To tell the truth, I didn't read Tolkien. I watched the movie, and it didn't have enough of an impact upon me to make me do so. I think it sucked, except for the animations and music. Now, someone who had read the book might have had an entirely different impression.  What I truly despise is people reading certain books as a trend. I guess you don't see it this way. And I can see how you may see it. In any case, I don't like fairy tales. :)

       @lrighty, I'm back. Yes! I was an interesting experience. Ok, (sorry I'm not entering the subjects of conversation right away, but I'll answer to Mulanda: "I have no clue").   So, we had to make a stop in Halifax on both, way back and to New Foundland. The Planes were pretty old and rusty (B-146, agrh, and some airbus which was ok). The weather was colder than in MTL, and we decided upon our arrival to go whale watching :). The taxi to some bay was 20$/each for 6 people and 20$/each for the boat; well, I had to pay for my student, from the money his dad gave me, but it was worth it. The entire boat just for 10 chess players with a beautiful deck and the Titanic song on repeat was marvelous. Our sight didn't  catch any whales, however, we spotted an iceberg of a size of a shopping mall (very impressive), saw the Bird Island and tonns of birds of various kinds, wow. Anyway, we sailed in the ocean for 2.5 hours and it was the experience of my trip. (Thank god the Titanic song was soon replaced by New Foundland music).   The next day my student and I slept in, so the noon city tour busses were right on time. The bus tour was also a lot of fun, especially because a seat for me was always reserved near a Ukranian-Georgian Hotty, who, as I found out later that evening, was 24 and two years into the marriage (damn). So during the bus tour we went to the most eastern point of Canada, to the first "debarcation" point of the French explorers, some other historic sites and a BBQ.   The BBQ was of a Nouffy style with a band of 8 chubby chicks playing Irish songs. A friend of mine and I spent most of the time eating and deciding which of the musicians was the least worst choice to pass an evening with. Finally, we both got invited to a party at one of their houses, and truly, they are very nice people with some VERY nice friends :P. Yet, I had to check on my student every hour or so, because I left him alone to sleep in our room in the Univetsity residence, where all the chess players were staying.   Now, I'm too tired to continue typing, so the rest of the story will be up tomorrow.

       Well Vlad, let's have a talk.  Tolkien wrote his books far before my parents were born. His books were considered as gems shortly after their publication. And on then very few people have read it. Recently the movie came out and there has been a sudden surge of popularity with his books. I read his books when I was 12. And I was flabbergasted by Tolkien's magnificent imagination. Imagine my sudden joy when i learned that a movie was coming out. Might I add as well that I felt the same joy when I learned that there was a movie for Macbeth as well. I enjoyed both books and movies with glee. However, a certain group of people have now dubbed Tolkien as 'farfelu" much like harry Potter. I have to mention the following;  With gaining popularity, a sudden masterpiece decreases in value towards people of "dispopular" taste.  .  Now that almost every living 2 eyed human has read Tolkien, do I like his books less than I did before? No. I just have an added subject to my social conversation.  Fermat's Enigma is another of my favourite books. I don't think I am allowed to let anyone say that the book will be "farfelu" as well just as soon as everyone has devoured it.

       Hey there yo. Ivan, tell us exactly what happened. Who is the chinese guy? Your boss?   Besides, that's pretty cool shit you've got there on your website... But why Igor? 'cause we have one Igor here on the team, and I'm not sure if you would want him to be your imaginary friend... :)  Also, those ads are pretty annoying. I know a very reliable, free, no-ads hosting. But it's in Russian. I can get you an FTP username and password if you want. (it's , user.by.ru ) Or, you might consider  vladster.net/anything .   As I have already told Josee, there is a surprize coming up in a few weeks (to a couple of months). More specific? No. It's going to be fun.  Other than that, I can't wait to go to Ukraine! Called my grandparents yesterday. They say everything is ready, the  urlLink Ural  is fixed...  Having loads of fun at work. For about a week now, I've been testing those fancy switch-boxes. They are all done (all 47 of them). I have isolated 6 faulty ones. Now is the time for self-education and slacking off. My boss told me to take a few boxes apart and see what I can do. Exciting! Now I've got a pile of books with schematics, an oscilloscope, one "good" device for reference, and six "bad" devices to be fixed.   A word about my boss. He is a huge fan of racing cars. He buys old sports cars, refurbishes them in his garage and participates in races. He has like... 10 cars in his hangar or something. The other day, he drove a three-door 1995 LADA SAMARA to work. Not exactly a legendary racing car. He bought it for $150 for parts for another SAMARA that he got for free. The latter one is a sports car that was built by Lada-Canada and won some national championship, beating Honda and Toyota. The owner of the car rolled it a few times, thus rendering it suitable for scrap collectors. My boss got it for free and is now re-building it. Pretty cool stuff. $150 for a 1995 car in running condition.

Yeah so, vacation summer and all kinds of fun... Did Andrei say it's his b-day soon? Oh God. How old are you turning (16 or 17)? Now guys we are gonna have to be careful when jocking about "Newfees", somebody may get offended. Oh and what is this contamination of blogger with non-Vanier members? I think we should make those people pass a test of Vanier assimilation or something (say how much alcohol can one intake in a certain period of time)- just kidding Ivan. And one last thing. I think we shold do something crazy this summer, like swimming to Cuba for example. Anyone up for it?  P.S. Andrei, you still have to tell us what you did the night before leaving to Newfoundland...

       Life has struck another fatal blow upon me... come to think of it Life always does.... so the moral of the story is that:  if you can hurt yourself more than life can hurt you  you have the winning hand.  Ain't that right?  This is what Martial training is all about. You train by continuously injuring yourself until you don't care anymore and then you can beat up anybody because they simply cannot hurt you any worse that you already have.... The question is how to apply this to life?  Vlad ... play the frikin lotto ! here are some numbers... 3, 8, 17, 23, 24, 30 you choose the seventh'  30M$  Hey the chinese guy has started speaking proper English now... we understand each other but I find myslef talking like him more and more. Damn chinese assimilation !!!  Peace all,    Ivan {  http://igor.bizhosting.com/   }  Oh yeah, Yesterday I was in the hospital and this guy is waiting in the emergency... he has a problem with his rectum (from the machines he works on). Imagine a really tough looking quebecer guy... you know the one that is probably called Guy works hard all day, watches hockey and swears at Chretien once in a while.  First thing the doctor asks him "Do you have any homosexual relations ?" He got soooo pissed !!! Anyways, it is not good to make fun of sick people....

Man, it's actually the first time that I don't miss school during the summer break (I usually do have a feeling of nostalgy right after the last exam is over, but not this time!). Does it mean that I don't like my program? Who gives a fuck!   Oh, yeah, tonight at a caraoke bar a guy with a name "Dildo" was singing. Pretty cool heh? Anyway, my birthday is coming up next week, however I don't know if I'll have time to make a party until June, but please, keep checking this site for further notice, if I won't be able to call all the people :)   HA! P.S. I'm going to NEW FOUNDLAND this friday for 4 days! :)

       Heyya! Guess what? I won a gift certificate for $100 from an italian restaurant!   We went to the Lava Lounge in Little Italy with Audrey and Jacques the other night. The night was full of weird coincidences, and in the end - the gift certificate. It was a lottery among about 200 people in the club. There were three prizes. Mine was the biggest. I swear, I should have bought a lottery ticket that night. I have never won anything (in a lottery) in my life!

       Well, TyGoN, your argument certainly posesses a seed of reason.   It is true that the presence of a competitor, an enemy, brings people together, thus making a society stronger and more patriotic (never mind less democratic for now). The effect is very apparent in the case of the United States and their war against the ghost of Communism. As long as the Soviet Union was in full health and great power, the American Homemaker had an objective put in his mind: resist and destroy anything with a smell remotely similar to the stinky proletariat propaganda. When the USSR plunged into the deep spin of economic and political self-destruction, the US lost its "rival sibling", and its ideology began to decompose.  This slow rotting led to questionning and reconsideration of many of the society's values. Of course, nobody actually sat down to "reconsider" anything, but the big picture was that the US was trapped in a nonexistant race and was desperatly trying to win it.  In this respect, I very much agree with ye. The mankind doesn't have a competitor (at least within the Solar system), and it's ultimate objective is merely the biological survival. Humanity lacks a strong war-time ideology. It has no reason to unite itself against an outside enemy. It is caught in a non-existant race which it tries hard to win.  This problem, however, is not to be refered to as the "only child syndrome". Humankind doesn't really have the parents who keep on spoling it. We are, simply put, the victims of our own competitiveness with no one to fight against.  That is only one way to look at it, of course. The other way is: "I've got beer in my fridge and five bucks in my pocket; I passed all my courses; Canadiens are winning; the thruth is out there, somewhere, for sure; Centucky Fried Chiken; Vive le Quebec libre; who cares; life is beautiful."  P.S. I envy your entourage, Fais, "hingy people smoking cigars and the nose so high up, they had to bend down in order to exit the room". Looks like you'll be one of them some day. Hopefully, we all will. Don't forget to post though, ever then.

       Another dinner i had tonight, where it involved the hingy people smoking cigars and the nose so high up, they had to bend down in order to exit the room.  However, I had company. Dear Mrs. Absolut. She taught me and told me a lot. While the evening was coming at its end, I gently took the remaining bottle out of the restaurant and walked down Notre Dame. And then it hit me. I just realized a portion of the truth about humanity. It is the following: Mankind is suffering from ,what psychologists refer to as, "only child syndrome". You see, the constant barriers that mankind breaks is because it is a "spoiled brat" using all the resources it has, because there is no other race to compete against. Or in other words, no sibling rivalry.   I will need more elaborate help from more sober people. In the mean time, I drink to evil.   Tygon jugs down what is left of his poison.

       Yo, Ivan!!! What a fuckin' surprise! You probably only know Andrei (Cash Johnny) and Eugene (Una Salsa Caliente).   Ivansky is the first non-Vanier-related member. Well, lounges are for everybody. He is in Electrical Engineering at McGill, just like yours truly.   By the way, I started work last monday baby. It's going pretty cool. I'm learning a whole lot about instruments. Today I was attempting to test a fancy electronic thingie that controls the individual reading lights in the passenger cabin. They use the same digital scopes as in our lab!!! Anyway, before I get carried away... yeah, cool.

       Hey Fais,  there is no trip tp Niagara. That's for sure. The situation is as follows:  If my car is a go by the next Fiday (5th), then we might join Ivansky and his friend David at their drunken karate thing outside Montreal. If my car's not ready, then I'll try to get my parents' van; and we could go OKA park to celebrate my birthday. Details later.

       Mathematicians apply the word "curved" to any space whose geometry is not Euclidian. It is an unfortunate custom because curvature, in the sense of bending, is a meaningless term except when the space is immersed in another space, whereas the property of being non-Euclidian is an intrinsic property which has nothing to do with immersion. However, nothing can be done but to utter a warning that what mathematicians understand by the term "curvature" is not what the word connotes in ordinary speech; what the mathematician means is simply that the relations between the mutual distances of the points are different from the relations which obtain in Euclidian geometry. Curvature (in the mathematical sense) has nothing to do with the shape of the space -- whether it is bent or not -- but is defined solely by the metric, that is to say, the way in which "distance" is defined.  It is not the space that is curved, but the geometry of the space.   Sir Edmund Whittaker.

         ACHTUNG    There have been rumours in the corridors of alien power. This week's agenda: the road trip to Niagara Falls. Here's some detail provided by a reliable source.  DATE: Friday night, July 5, 2002. Back on Sunday afternoon, July 7th.  OCCASION: Fun.  SECONDARY OCCASION: my b-day.  TRANSPORT: Audrey's reliable and super-safe 7-seat Caravan.  DRIVERS: So far, just me. Definitely need at least one more person to alternate at night.  SEATING: 4 seats taken (Audrey, Andrei, Evgueni and yours truly); 3 seats free (as in not occupied). More seats will be available if  Ivan, David or anyone else  decides to go  with their cars .  COST: "GAS SECURITY MUTUAL FUND" will be set up in the beginning of the trip ($50 cash each; $350 in total). Unspent money (around $150) will be evenly redistributed after the trip. Roughly estimated cost per person will be around 30 bucks.  PLACE TO SLEEP ON SATURDAY NIGHT: open for discussion. my idea is camping somewhere with our tents (I have one for 2 people - guess which two :).  FOOD: at a traveler's discretion. Preferably take-from-home  Interested parties please reply asap.

       The '81-'89 Buicks had the following engines: 2.8L, 3.0L, 3.3L and 3.8L, each having a turbocharger option. I have a 3.0 non-turbocharged. And, since the engine is basically redone anew, I will expect it to consume about 12-14 L per 100 km in the city, which, roughly, is what an old 2.0 eats.   Man, that engine bolt is serious shit. You can actually brake the other two bearings...   About the keyboard: NO, a will not be where a is. QWERTYUIOP[] = ������������

       Ivan, tell us about your car, 'cause I bought one too!!! Not as cheap as yours though. I paid $600. I mean, I didn't pay $600.  My  urlLink aforementionned  boss was rebuilding a 1981 Buick (150K km) for his wife. He had completely redone the engine (pistons, rings, shafts, valves, everything), changed transmission, suspension, brakes, inside carpets and what not. When he put the  engine back in, his wife changed her mind. The car has been standing under cover in his garage for two years... and now it's mine. I only have to reattach the auxillary belt, oil pump and all the electricity to the engine. Mind you, it's not that easy. He lets me play around with it, get it running, and then, if I like it, pay him his $600. Moreover, he will deliver the car to us in his trailer the first weekend of July.   So, I guess that's it. It's basically a new car, except for the body. It has an original paint and a little rust on the doors only. The rest is perfect. It's fully equipped: power windows, air conditionning, leather front seats and sunroof.   Sorry for bragging so much, I just love that car.   And that makes me think of something exciting. July 2 is my birthday. Now that we have cars (well, I will have it by then), we could go some place and have some fun, cause I don't want to have just a regular party inside. We could go to  urlLink the place some of us went last year . It's a chalet on a lake. Sveet. What do you say, people?

       To be able to type in Cyrillic, I went to control panel - keyboard - language and added a new layout to the keyboard. I then prepared 33 little stickers cut from a video cassette cover, wrote letters on them and glued them onto the lower side of the corresponding keys. Works perfect. Now, when I go to Ukraine this August, I will buy a Russian-English keyboard and will be happy for the rest of my life. I don't know if Bulgarian keyboard layout is identical to Russian (to tell the truth, I used to think you people used Latin alphabet, like Polish. Ew.). If it is identical, I can grab one for you, too.  There are also programs (I'll try to find) that convert "translit" to cyrillic text. "Translit" is what Russians call a text typed in Russian language using Latin characters. But those progs are usually unreliable if you care about the right spelling, because there are different ways to interpret such letters as  �, �, �,  etc..

So when are we opening a web page creation company and making some money you bum ?  In other news, I got a car for 500$. I shall prey to all divinities that it lasts through the summer and maybe into the winter.... Parking at Mcgill though is as hard/painful as divorcing a russian woman so I don't think I will be experimenting with that.  I have vowed to start eating well (as in alot) as of this week ... Does anybody want to cook for me ? I hear no takers... so why don't you suggest something good and easy to prepare.  Note: This statement is not adressed to the russian population becuase all you guys eat is Pilmeny and sometimes sussige....

Audrey: no coffee places are open, let's go to the piano bar Evgueni: yeah, we can have Amaretto Sour Audrey: nice, but you look too flashy, guys will be picking you up Evgueni: so you're gonna have to protect me, I'm gonna tell everyone you're my girlfriend Audrey: yeah right.   5 min later, fininishing the 1st glass of Amaretto Sour.  Audrey: I want another one Evgueni: hm, let's have one more and go home.  at 12:30 am.  Evgueni: these drinks got to me a little, it's time to go home Audrey: yeah me too, do you wanna take a taxi Evgueni: sounds good.  2:30 am, having hard time to speak.  Audrey: where did these shooters come from? Waiter: the guy sitting at the table on the left Evgueni: let's drink with him Audrey: o.k. and let's drink to Ukrainians. Evgueni: so you are drinking to me? Audrey: no, Ukrainians with dark hair Evgueni: well, that's a very good one, cheers.  3:30 am, in the taxi.

        Oups, you got me there Fais.    What I meant by "abstract" were the random drawings, pursuing no pattern whatsoever. How redneck of me. There are also those that do make a pattern, but that's all they do. Like that huge thing I saw at a museum in Ottawa: two vertical orange stripes on white background. The museum bought it for about $800K, if my memory serves me well. That's what I don't like. God bless Da Vinci and Monet, man.   Sorry about that.

       dude, you don't think, "outcries of an artist" can be expressed, or as the matter of fact "outcries" of anyone in any other form than speech or sign?  I think it is quite possible to express something or to tell something without using common forms of communication. If you truly believe that that is not so, than human civilization has never existed. Art form , in abstraction, has been quite rich for human culture. Example? Well mona Lisa is quite hideous but its meaning and the sheer genius of drawing  is , well.... powerful. And David, the statue, well dude, a naked male statue has never had so much importance and "inspiration" for so many. I think what you are troubled by is contemporary art. It is quite "eccentric" and probably very "disturbing" . But I am sure, their  truth or whatever it was the artist's intention will be revealed much to our awe, only quite later probably, much like the above mentioned masterpieces.  I dont think Leonardo Da Vinci and Michaelangelo are laughing their asses off. are they? what do you think ? and i just named two.

       I like abstract paintings, as long as they are what they are: random screenshots of someone's relatively sick mind not requiring much of skill or talent to produce. I don't like the fuss about them being super-duper full of "ideas", "images" etc. I bet those "artists" laugh their asses off when people "grasp" the "outcries of the artist's soul" in those, excuse me, masterpieces..

       From a McGill Publication called  Red Herring   Recently, there's been a big kerfuffle about George W. Bush's "Axis of Evil" speech. Because he American President is in fact functionally illiterate, and has trouble conceptualizing shapes with more than one dimension, his advisors neglected to tell him about the other geometric shapes of evil. And it's a good thing, too, because it took them two weeks to get him to stop saying "Asses of Evil."    HHHHA

       Faisal... What in the world is wrong with you?!   By the way, today I went Grand Prix Canada. Man, it rocks! It's just Ferrari vs. McLauren and everything else is a hustle (yet, some exceptions may occur).  First it was F1, then Pan-Am qualificaitions for those 60's and 70's racing cars, then F1600 (38 cars on the track!! They remind me of a swarm of bees), and finally it was a race among the owners of Ferraris in the world. Shit these cars look fine, as well as perform great!

       Do you get emails asking you to join any religion ? Somehow I recieve them _daily_ (The last one had some info on Russia I've never heard before hehe ;))) Here is some lines from the last one:  "...1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (APPROXIMATLY 10 TO THE 34th POWER)  JEWLS (POWER UNIT) NEEDS TO BE INPUTED INTO THE WHOLE UNVERSE EVERY  SECOND TO KEEP IT FROM FALLING COMPLETELY APART."  (Just wondering where the pieces are going to fall into..and what the hell is a JEWL..jewels ?...power jewels yeah right)  "..AND RECENTLY 65 NUCLEAR  SUITCASE BOMBS WERE STOLEN FROM A TEXAS MILITARY BASE. "  (Mushroom clouds over the nearest Burger King)  " ... THERE IS THREE ACTVE RUSSIAN MILITARY BASES IN CALIFORNIA  ALONE. "  (And I guess there are three more in Washington DC. oh those evil russians)  "... RUSSIA HAS JUST FINISHED BUILDING ITS LAST MAJOR UNDERGROUND  CITY, NEAR MOSCOW,  IN PREPARATION TO HIDE 2/3 OF ITS POPULATION IN   WHAT THEY EXPECT TO BE A VERY SOON BREAKOUT OF NUCLEAR WAR."  (Or may be they need to hide from alien invasion)  All I wanna know, what these guys have just smoked, I wanna get some too.

       Hey Vovchik! Glad to know you are doing fine. I really would like to know about all the uncensored stuff. As to what's going on here... well Audrey and I wasn't really serious, if you know what I mean. So don't worry too much and keep on partying. It would be really cool if could bring some of that cheep russian vodka to Canada. Now, Andrei, yes I'm still single, but very well provided with "job security". And I still can't believe that you won't be there on my B-day, bastardo.

I've sent you some e-mails, but they all seem coming back to me, so I guess you don't really know all the stuff that's going on here.   Well as for that 'stuff' we'll tell you on a more confidencial channel :).   Anyhow, I'm leaving for France the 12th of Sept. and probably coming back some time in summer 2003. Besides that, Audrey is going out with Evguni now, thought you ought to know :) Just kidding actually, he is still singe. :P     Now seriously, I want to invite everyone to a party on September the 7-th and the 8-th.  It will take place in  possibly  Verdun, Audrey's place, or in a country house.   Take care,

       Oh yes, for berry-pickig I am for!!!  Hello, my ladies, how you're all doing fine! I am in my city baby. Kostanai, Kazakstan; and hell, I am having a blast watching MIB 2 in Russian! :). I have so many impressions and things to say that I will probably mix everything up.  My class is doing extremely well in the city. Many moved to Russia and Germany, many have married and are having their boring family lives. Out of all my classmates, only 3 people stll don't have a higher education. I am one of them. I have classmates working in banks, police, night clubs security personel etc. I want to stay here. :(  A friend of mine works as a fashion designer at a model agency. She showed me around at her work... Holly fucking godmother of Jesus Christ! Viva Charles Darwin with his natural selecton!!! Ait! Those ladies fine. And she kno she fine! Still going strong, if you know what I mean.  Yesterday I got drunk with my fellas, spent a total of 8 dollars for 2 bottles of vodka and stuff to eat for three. Then we took a looong taxi drive around the city for another 2 bucks form my pocket. Today I bought genuine hand-made black leather shoes for 30 bucks. Gonna shop some more. I like it. I'm leaving back to Ukraine on monday, and to Canada on Sept 4th. See yall there dudes.  That's it. The uncensored stuff later in person.  So, Andrei, I guess no France for you???

       Hey, I'm the official landlord of the Verdun love-palace. And I say that I'm thinking of subletting or renting this place for a year starting Sept. 1st. However, the exact dates will be available within next one or two weeks. I will be looking for two/three people to live ther, and I already have some candidates. So if you are interested,  contact me.   It's 3-bedroom, 1-livingroom, kitchen, toilet/shower, lot's of closets and 15-20 min from downtown by merto or 7-10 min by car.  Price...hmm.... t.b.a. because I don't know how much do the gaz/water/electricity costs, but it should not be more than 450$/month (all included) per person.

       As I wander across the excentric depths of my inner self, I often question the voices I hear: "Why does green sea life seem so god damn blue at dawn?" Having gotten no answer, I turn and give a bow to the transparent spirit of wisdom in my glass.  Godspeed you black emperor. Shall your brain never cease its dirty liquid business.  People are strange. Mr. Pinstripe Suit is no more.  P.S. Installed Mandrake Linux on my brother's P2. Didn't have as much fun as I expected. Unless I use console (as opposed to GUI), it works much slower (as in SLOWER) than Windows 98 on 300 MHz, 64 MB RAM. I'll just use it as a server when I get my beloved broadband back.

This is just too good to skip. And it's from my favorite online magazine. In short, it says how bragging about a great number of one's sexual partners is equivalent to admitting one's incapability to think, feel and be a person in general. The article is very radical, but I think it makes sense in general.

       ok, ok, lets all have a group hug :)  So, whits going on people?   The new layout, hmmmmm..... I say bright yellow wood look at least original (hey, lets have some fun)  yet, the back ground could be out of our pictures, but the colors made up out of very small pictures. It's possible to do on Adobe.   Or maybe also a poto of a BigMAC trio made out of the trio's pics;  Fais's out of lab photos; Muland's out of chess pieces&squares; Audrey's out of, I don't know :) etc...  you get the point. however, if it takes too much space, or something like that, I say the background could be out of mouthes with stiking out tongues, or something like that.   Enjoy life people, peace to you all, and.... Let's hope there is still something too.   Good bye.   Oh, wait!!! Mulanda, are you going to turture me before murdering?

       Blogger is alive anew, thanks to Andrei. I'll call you Da Frenchman from now on if that's ok.  By the way, when you called, I raised my head too quickly and bumped into the power steering tube. Argh! Choose time next time :)  Ah, the car. What a wonderful automotive mechanics learning experience. Actually, the mechanical part of the work is done: exhaust is connected and tightened, power steering hose replaced, engine bolts tightened, oil pump bolts replaced. Now is the electricity turn. If everything goes well, we'll drive to Toronto in the beginning of October. Got one free seat left :).

       Oh, by the way. Vlad I couldn't open the picture you e-mailed me.   Eh, hehe. Athother thing. Here I have only two photos from Canada. They are both from Vlad's good-bye party. One is a group picture, and the other is of Audrey. (Audrey, I was suppose to give them back to you, but I forgot... sorry).   So! I put both pictures on the wall, and I wonder, when I'll be bringing chicks to my appartment, will be they asking me if the girl on the photo is the one on whom I'm cheating with them? :) hehe.  (actually, depending on the girl, I'll decide to keep the picture or to take it off) :p

       Hello my fellow Canadians!!! I'm writing to you from my exile in Paris, France :). Yes, yes, I have had some adventures falling on my head, yet, nothing too special, especially durong last two days that I spent sleeping in my appartment. By the way, my appartment... I can easily fit four people in here (maybe five if somebody sleeps in the same bed as me). So I'm expecting to see you here SOON! And the sity and the country is great!!! Jizzz! Here is a lot to see and a lot to do. And those a lot are on every freakn' coner!! ( I mean historical buildings, etc.)   Anyhow, I've been to the Effel tower at night... It's amazing. I also rode my sister's bike (now it's in my possetion) around Paris. At some point I suddenly breaked with front and rear breaks at the same time, so the back of my bike lifted and hit the car parked beside. Driver's window was cracked, the mirror fell out of the mirror pocket and the pocket itself was, hmmm, sort of in the wrong place. I really didn't have time to check out anything else, as I was quickly pedaling away. But the bike was fine.   Same day I biked to the "Arc de Triumph", and to get there one either needs to use the underground tunnel, or cross something like 7 or 8 lane circlar road, with no street signs what-so-ever. Guess which way I chose. :) But it was a pretty loud honking symphony. So as soon as I got to the Arch, I started to enjoy the historical heritage of France, as suddenly two cops came up to me and said that I can't be here with bike. I made the dummest face possible and said: "Huh?! English?" Luckely they didn't speak any understandable English, so I took the opportunity to make them look like serious idiots, while making a clown of myself using the funniest sign language I could think of. I worked, they left me alone for 5 mins or something like that until some fat security lady started yelling at me that I can't ride my bike on the grave of the unknown soldier (yet, I was holding the bike beside me with the holliest/touristic face, five meters away from that place). Anyhow, told her in English what I thought about her yelling at me, about tourists, and about this "public cemetery"  as she called the Arc of Triumph. The security bitch clearly understood what I said so it ended in the same police guards trying to resolve the situation, and me pedaling away as fast as possible through the same creazy circular street and those idiots yelling behind me. I don't know if they where following me or not, but soon I made it to Champs Elys�es heading to the Louvre, and then to Notre Dame and to the border of the Seine.   That was my fist Sunday in Paris.

I realized that it's a good thing to do sometimes, you could actually learn a lot from it. Other than that well, I wish every one a great academic year and hopefully lots of new experience, especially that some of us will be living on a diferent continent. And I'm really up for going to France on vacation sometime around x-mass time, just gotta check the finances.  Ok. Time to sleep now. Bye   P.S. The ex PM of Israel is coming to Concordia tomorrow, they say. Have been told not to come to school due to some protesting events being prepared. Well I'll just go check it out, see if it's realle dangerous.

       Altai. In a private little city (but that's just dreams).  I don't know, yet. But to spoil the wonder-like mood of last post, I just want to mention that toilets are shared in my University. Welcome to France, Andrei. And what's incredible is that all the comps here were updated from Netscape 4 to Mozilla-Netscape browzer. And today I aslo, it seems like have updated my feelings towards some people I've recently met... By the way, Vlad, who is YOUR bitch you refered to few post ago? (if it's not a secret).   And Jeka, I wouldn't be needing the WARRANTY untill I come back to Canada. Nonetheless, I'm really thinking that I don't know when I will come back*.   By the way ***!!!*** My parents are looking to sublet our appartment in Montreal-Nord very soon, for an undeclared period of time. ANYONE interested. It's pretty URGENT.   And preferably to be someone who is trustworthy, particularly one of you guys, or one of your friends.  What's funny, is that my parents might be leaving Canada next month or so, my sister with her b-f are going (or moving) to France in the summer, and I ... don't feel that there is something particularly important for ME left there except for those writing on this blogger and a small group of others. Anyway, you wanted to talk meaningfully? Screw all of ya! Guess you had a point, I'm bored.

       Andrei, I still didn't have time to look for the garanty, because as Vova said mid-terms are killing the normal people in my program too. However some of those normal people are at this moment sitting in front of a computer and reading the news about all you guys. Tomorrow I have an exam in a class that I've never opened the book for...dead I am tomorrow that is. Not that any of you care probably, though it still feels good to officially wright somewhere. According to a an obseration of statistically analytical nature, one might conclude that the mood of the blog master pieces has gone down to the depressive stage of their existance. So on that happily-depressively-positively negative note, I am ready to step into the new period of my text book filtering. Don't worry, be happy.  P.S. Vova, to answer one of your interestingly comprehensive posts...

       The lounge is Netscape 6-friendly. I didn't test it on anything earlier because I couldn't find a computer that has Netscape 4 on it. In any case, what's inside the blogger (when you log in) is for sure compatible with anything remotely resembling a web browser. Andrei, try Opera. It works pretty fast even on shit-slow computers (e.g. Ivan's). Ok, "shy guy with something on his mind". From your monologue, you seem to be pretty bored (or at least it seems like it, from how I know you). Secondly, I'm not sure if your petite amie reads this, unless she uses some kind of sophisticated stealth software to completely mask her existence on the web.   Montreal is alright. Last night was the first snow. Midterms are killing me and most of the normal people (about 3) in this fucked-up program. Seriously, man, it must be fun to be a teacher in ECE. Only sadists need apply. Just had my complex vars midterm. It was the first one that I actually finished. In the end I realized most of it was wrong, because I confused the cross-derivatives in Cauchy-Riemann equalities. Fun, fun, fun.  Now I have a fucking fifty-hour ass't due on wed. another one due tonight. I also have a midterm coming up for a class in which I haven't showed up for at least three weeks. So, if you ask me, life is a bitch. But (according to the latest email I wrote to a dedicated fan of mine), she is MY bitch. Latezz.

       So what are the news in Mtl? Here it's fine, but sucks at the same time. :/ It rains here 5 days out of a week and the length of French people's faces is directly proportional to the amount of mm of rain/day.   Tomorrow I'm going for a movie premiere, it will be my second night outing since I'm in France. My g-f got some promotion tickets. I'm also training every sunday from 11:00 to 17:00 o'clock or more, but I'm thinking to start training more. The faculty is o'k, I go there just for classes and then come home. I visited some cultural sites here, but most of the time I have spent either at some newly aquentented friends house, or walking around, or cooking, or doing something, which is really nothing, but still takes time. Everywhere, I look like a shy guy with something on his mind, who doesn't speak French (funny, heh?). I'm still looking for a job, it's not that I really did something to find one, but I think it's already too late anyway, I'm in a too deep shit hole, I have to swim to stay afloat. Yet, I'm writing some stuff. Not a lot, but some stuff. Maybe I will get a job here soon, or at least something like that. Now I have to go food shopping. Why am I telling you all this? Is this interesting to anyone? Well, if you've got till this point, I guess it is.   Faisal, are you still playing chess? If so what's your raiting now?  Jeka, it would be great if you've found the garanty, because l'affaire qui le tien � la main a p�tt�.  Vlad, what's new in life and at school? And how's the atmosphere in general?   Alright, got to go buy some food, prepare something to eat, visit two buddies, and sit in front of my slow computer and type bullshit, or read or actually do some shcool work.  See you later! Peace and Love to ya all!

(I have a feeling that some permanent reader will shake her head while reading this :-P )  Another thing, I have the greatest image of Vova in my mind :) At some point I'll produce it on computer screen and post it here :). It's just too cute :* .

       Bon alors, je vais garder la theme des dernieres postes et ecrire en francais. Il faut que je demande au moins une fois a Andrei comment sont les femmes franciases. puis?  En tout cas, moi, je traine une bequille pendant un bout de temps. J'ai pas eu la chance de faire la bete a deux dos depuis des...........(oui je sais, c'est pitoyable, alors arretez de rire, et foutez moi le camp.)  Les examens me hurlent en ce moment, et j'ai la tete qui flotte. J'ai pas eu de sommeil en trois jours, et je vois des seins partout. J'en ai compt� 15 hier.  Je vous le garantis, une tres haute dose de nicotine, et l'absence de sexe, somment une combinaision fatale.  Puis....et quoi encore? ...bof, j'ai plus rien a dire, donc pour finir, un mot d'avis.  Si vous cherchez un "pick-up line", n'essayez jamais cela , consciemment , bien sur : "Excuse me m'am , do you know the name of the seventh dwarf?" Ca n'a pas l'air de tres bien marcher.  Essayez plus tot quelquechose de plus seduisant, comme par exemple, "Excuse m'am , Which one of the dwarfs would you do?"  Pour finir, rappelez-vous mes enfants, dites non aux drogues.

       Ok. dude... It seems that you French people have nothing to do. What the f... you have conversations with girls about titties. Why don't you go continue "conversing" instead of bragging about it on the blogger(putain mec). And even though American food is modified, we have good sizes here too, ranging form XL to XXL. So Andrei how's your ex-neighbour doing?

       AAAAAAA... aaaaaaaaaa..... a-a-a-a-a...... And all together!!  :)  You bet I examined :) ! Was quite exciting!!  :-P. And, hey Vova, don't get jealous here, we all know about your fasting period :) . By the way, are you all fasting there? Well, at least you have the computer speed. The only comps avalable are at the faculty, and it takes appox. 1-2 mins to download the blogger page, 3-5 min to post&publish. Besides, the only system used here is Lenux, which crashes every second connection. So don't complain!!   To add, it's 7:00pm and the computer room is full of diff dudes, who are hucked on 'agances de rencontres' , and what's worse, that from time to time when I take a glince at their screen, they turn it away due do the adult content of the sites!!! Jis! So that's why French women are considered so horny by the rest of the world!   Anyway, I really see that Vlad is the only one from the blog population really dedicated to his computer and to talking to me sometimes, so Hello Vova!! By the way, is there anybody except you and me and some horny Frenchmen reading this web inspite of the vocabulary used? ARGH!

       Is it just me, or it really smells in here? Is Andrei having his PMS again? Don't laugh though, it's a  strictly proffetional  observation.   So, Andrei, did you get to professionally examine the effects of American food on French female population? Also, how's that summer camp business going? Any changes?

       Good news about genetically modified food.  Recently I had a conversation with a few girls about titties. Don't laugh, it was strictly proffetional.   Anyhow, they told be about an observation they made while visiting the U-states. ('U' doesN'T stant for urinated). So, the observation was that while living there their tits started to grow. Consequently, they started asking questions, and the answer was: the FOOD. Indeed, since in the U-states they were eating food that is genetically modified, i.e. containing hormones, 0-fats and overdosed vitamins and proteins, their tits grew. However, in my opinion, their size was fine with me!  There were, of course, some side effects; but who cares when an alternative for silicon pums is already in bussiness and is incorporated in women's everyday life activities!!   You GO GIRLS!  :)   *All rights reserved*

       Man, so did anyone finally decide to come visit me except Patricia?   Oh, hold on, are you all into the mid-term exam hibernation period? Guess so.   By the way, Doris, do you know a dude named Doris Day? On his behalf I got an offer for skiing at Mont-Tremblant which is 215dolls/season for full time students aged 17-25, canadian residents, if applied in groups of 4, before November 15.   It's for those wusses who'd rather ski than coming to France. :) By the way, did anyone  m e n t i o n  anything about sitting and not being able to study in Red Path due to the migration of various interesting species from left to right of the one's vision field? I'm laughing in your face!!   And Zagombies, stop fishing the little ones, it's time to move on to classic brands! And they are all here :).

       Well... the "Josee's hotel" is back in business.  What a night. We had a reunion of an almost forgotten company. Josee, Cleo, Eugene, Audrey and yours truly. All at Josee's place (formerly known as Josee's mum's place). Some card games. Then Peel Pub. Bad quality beer, good quality time. A 1p.m. eggs-and-bacon breakfast on Parc. Just the right time to start doing something useful. Studying awaits me. A loong weekend full of signals, systems and electronic circuits. Magnificent! Groovey. Outstanding.  Anyone who wants to share my fate for this weekend (in terms of studying) is welcome to give me a call any time of the day. I won't sleep.

       Heh, like you're exused! Mu, nice to hear from you. Everyone, I just had my first day of classes :)). Nothing too difficult, yet looks like I would need to work I my ass of here in order to get good grades. However, since I'm mostly interested in passing the courses, I hope the workload to greatly deminish.   Oh, yes, my french is getting better and better :)) I can actually read books now :)), yet I miss all the easy english bragging about nothing. Here I need to work my mouth muscules which is quite tiring :/.   To chess lovers, I'm back in the game, but blitz only (for now).   And very important, I really understand why Bunin is called a classic and why he got the Nobel price. Man, every two pages I just sit up and say: "ebat' moi hiu, hmmm, blia." Then I get ashamed and add "oh, tak eto pravda." Putain, le Mec est vraiment pas mal, pas mal du tout!

       Hell, I have just rediscovered my long-forgotten toy:  urlLink click.   It translates French-to-French too! Here's this blog's description:  if you feel the urge to get in touch and have mind-blowing sex with any of the contributors, give us a shout    Translated #1: ...si vous sentez le recommander... d'avoir le sexe hallucinant avec un quelconque de ces contribuants, donnez-nous un cri.  Translated #2: ...... contribuants hallucinog�nes vous d'un quelconque de ces d'avec de silicium sentez le recommander... d'avoir le sexe, C.p. donnez-nous d'un.  Translated #3: .......sentez vous le recommander... d'avoir le sexe, d'un donnez-nous de de silicium de d'avec de d'un quelconque de ces de hallucinog�nes de contribuants de C.p..  Oh yes. It is indeed Saturday night. And I'm home, amusing myself with google. I can't believe it! What the fuck is this? I guess it's one consequence of being single: no one wants to know me anymore. That is... if I don't count the bunch of porn-seeking loosers here on this website.  Funny, Ivan told me the same thing the other day :). Now I can feel it. It must be contageous or something. Well, at least he gets calls from chicks who need their math assignments done :). BBHahhhahahahahaaaaaaaaa :)).  No, actually I was invited to Audrey's place tonight. The salsa-man, David and Angelie are just goona drink the remaining fifteen barrels of vodka and go jump in the pool. Not my kind of fun... anymore... for now.  That was me and my geeky and pathetic boredom.  P.S. Roma, prover' mylo na morexyz. Srochno.

What about me, well, life sucks because I can't get a stupid cell phone here since I don't have a certain card from the gouv. that I will get only in 25 days! And it's VERY enoying cause this card is proof of one's existence in France, and those who do not have it, are not even cosidered like people here. (damn mentality). Oh, yes, no comments on the last sentense, please.   So I guess I will not be 'connected' as they call it here for the next 25 days or so, because I'm not getting a fixed phone.   Hi Viv.  Yeah, Pat e-mailed me recently, she is doing fine. Besides that, I still have a habbit of getting to the lounge through 'vladster.net' :)

My life right now is as calm as the Pacific ocean. There've been changes on all fronts and in all circles of the people I know.   Another day had just vanished into the deep blue sea of my unpredictable past. It will fade slowly away. I am now submerging into the soulless void of electronic circuits. I thought I'd never have to do it :). My ever-so-strong concentration is coming back to me as emotions evaporate. 'nough said.  Fais, your greeting on my birthday card had a wrong context.

", d, d) /* end arrogance */   In other news for Andrei, Mulanda and Kato still wander around both campuses seducing cute russian and indian girls and scaring people to death on parking lots. Sarah studies her ...hm... off. She is pretty happy about her physiology (I mean, the program she studies :); and she still has that happy and confused face. I promissed to drive her to the movies as soon as my car is done.   Vivianne despises me and says hi to Andrei. Danny is a nerd now. Seriously. He wears glasses and studies every day. The coffee place still exists. A certain influx of fresh blood has taken place. Patricia is gone to Mexico without even saying bye. Like nothing ever happened between us.   Ceasar  salad is just as popular in the Mech. Eng. cafeteria :)). They even served it in the blues pub once.   Ivan is cool and angry. He always finds a reason to be angry with me.

Are you shoviling the streets yet; or is it just lots of dirty dry leaves everywhere and pooring rain and wind and cold?

       Well, to my opinion, Salsaman is the closest to the ultimate truth about Love. As per sex, I don't think (or at least I hope it's not true) that sex is good only when we are young.  Come on guys we are but a tiny bit from figuring out what love is ultimately. I need more input.  Next problem to solve: how to reach world peace.

       Wow... I feel like istarted a hot subject here. Btw, Andrei my future is not uncertain. It is rather dificult for me to choose the path to arrive to the end result. To respond to the previous discussion, money cannot be a consequence but rather a tool to satisfy one's needs. It is earned thorugh hard and dedicated work, but Vlad if you remember Michael Danby-Smith used to say that money is not a end in itself, only a means to an end. I agree with that and money can't be " the only ultimate objective ". It has no intrinsic worth in itself and your ultimate objective is what you want to do with the money. Therefore, you're rich when you know how to use your cash. Now, Andrrei, i'm not quite sure how the sex experience relates to the geographical location, but don't tell me that you refused simply fucking when you didn't find any love from your partner. Sex is one of the phisiological, vital human needs w/o which we wouldn't be here discussing all this crap. Love, on the other hand, is a result of phisical attraction and constant interaction with your partner and sex is part of that interaction. So sex by itself is good when we are young. ciao  P.S. I didn't make it to the finals last night at the competition, tough luck, wil do better next time.

       What's wrong with that?  Once in high school, our teacher told us that some people stay virgins their entire lives. And not because they never made love, no. They're virigns, because every time for them is a like first time, so their souls and hearts always stay virgin. I never could get what he meat by that. I still don't quite get it now. Yet, I'm trying to change my way of seeing things. Yes, just trying, because the hard thing is to continually* stay in the right perspective, and to love in every instant of life.  ...  By the way, how did we get from Jeka's uncertain future to a convesation about meaning of sex and love? I don't know; nevertheless, I hope that our blabbing will help you make your* right choice, Jeka.

       Here goes Andrei with his pubescent wetness again. Well, I definitely lack the unique  European doggy-style perspective , ya know. Some serious shit there, you see. Moreover. Yet.   Sex without love  my ass. Somebody here will die a virgin.

       Nonesense. Sex is nothing special, nither is money. Maybe if you'll live in Europe for some time, you'll also understand. Life can be different and is different for everyone (duh...) , yet happy life always brings same feeling of happiness and joy to all the people in the same way. Money is not a feeling. Besides, it's impossible to buy fee good (in definition of good) feelings.   Love, for instance, is a feeling that makes one happy. Feeling of accomplishment, feeling of glory, feeling of respect, all of them make people happy. Can money evoke them? No, yet, money can evoke greed, jealousy, hatered...   Moreover, sex. Sex without love. I'm sure you know what I'm talking about. It's called fucking. Tell me, what do you feel when you just fuck? Do you feel happy? Do you feel love towards your partner? Or do you just feel  desire   (before fucking), and feeling of  domination  while fucking doggy style and when the girl is sucking you on her knees. Now, if you're a girl reading this, what do you feel when you to the latter? Do you feel nasty, or do you not feel at all, because your clit distracts your thoughts due to uncontrolled body reactions to nerve impulses? Did you ever wonder why we call desire for sex the  animal instinct ?  Anyway, happiness is a consequence of love, and hard dedicated work that one enjoys and loves. Money and sex can also be a consequence of hard dedicated work, yet, will money and sex be a consequence of one's happiness??

       Money (as in M-O-N-E-Y) will never be a consequence of anything but hard and dedicated work.  Exploring different opportunities  can and will distract you from the ultimate objective, which is MONEY.  Liking  what you do is pretty straight forward: less work and more money. And sex.  Everything in this life is sex. Money is good, protected sex. It's good for you. So, drop that pussy business of  exploring opportunities  and go do some math.

       Hey, dude!! I want to come watch!! :))   Fais, I don't really agree with simply starting working and due to the money flow, the happiness' flow as well. I think that people should always tend towards what they like, especially when they work, and explore different opportinities, of what they think they like, regadless of the outcome. Money will just be a consequence.

       Thanks for advice Fais. Latest updates: i am gonna perform at Club Med tomorrow (Cha Cha competition), so if anyone is interested in watching come for about 10:30pm. It had to be initially next week, but there has been last minute changes. Maybe next week, i'll be performing for the second time. So it's in front of simons on Ste-Catherine street, i think there is a $5 admission fee.

       Hello Andrei! Not that I can update you about anyone else but myself, due to the fact that since you left I talk to you more often than to the people living "few blocks away" as opposed to a few thosand miles, but if you're really anxious to know, I do use protection. I don't see why it would bother you that much, but thanks for your such caring attitude anyway. Thinking deeply, lately I have come to realize that I still don't have a clear picture of my so-called future, well...future. That's kind of scary, I found, since I am spending a lot of money on education, but really don't see myself working 9 to 5 in an office and get a 3-week paid vacation to go away just to come back to the same stupid office. On the other hand, alternatives to such life style don't appear quite clear to me, in terms of their profitability and satisfaction, even though I had people confirm to me the opposite. So does anyone else feel the same way? Any feedback at all? Anyone cares?

Well, since everybody has finished his/her midterms, more-or-less, and can express them selves freely; I'm curious, Waj, are you still with Heather? Fais, are do you have a "petite amie"? Jeka, do you use protection? Doris, any luck? Ivan, what about you? Josee, on the other hand, never mind. Audrey+Vlad, well nothing new.   Who else? Any other active members of the blog? Igar, are you still running after unexperienced young russian girls? Are you alive in the first place?   Cheers!

       Wrong... Since the beginning of my French period, I've dumped twice and been dumped once. So I'm in +1 so far.   It's like a game. The only rule is "you can't cheat your feelings".  However, Vivienne has suggested an additional rule, which is " you can't cheat the other's feelings"; yet, it is still under consideration.

       Hey-yo.  It's good to see that everybody is still in action!  About me, well I'm single again. And this time she dumped me. I feel that it's ironic, because I hoped that she didn't take us seriously, yet, as soon as I thought that she is also an interesting person she dumps me. Yeah; sure.   Yet, MY CAT IS BACK!!!!!!! My sister sent me an e-mail that our cat that was missing since the month of April 2002 is alive and doing fine!!!!! She was adopted by a family on our street all this time (kidnapped in a way). Anyhow, my parents desided to leave the cat with the other family, since they're leaving to Russia and my sister leaves in Verdun.   Besides that, hmmm.... Nothing new.... At least nothing that I could publicly announce.   Vlad's car blog is an interesting idea, I'm eager to see its development.   Also, Good luck to all those who're still in mid-term nirvana!

I say we connect a few exponential-varying current inputs into their arses, then "take enough time for the output to become stable" and then judge if the "output" is causal, memoryless or BIBO stable.  As for the holidays, I would like to drive to Miami, but I am still unsure about it because of my financial situation. I predict lots of skiing this winter though.  Also, ladies and gentlemen! A new era in automobile journalism is about to shed light upon our sorry existence!  urlLink CarBlog  has been uploaded!

It is right now my prize possession. On top of that, I remember that I have 30 dollars off at this movie store, so I am getting Star Wars for free!!!!!!....hmmm, I guess my story wasnt that exciting eh? Well im pretty happy...  Vlad, Im gonna help you take out those Signal bastards. We should go after the professors as well, make them feel the pain of bad signal teaching. Also, dont feel bad about EC 1. Just remember to always use a T network in small signal analysis, you can never go wrong with a T :) . So what is new with everyone? I can see Andrei is still keeping up his "ladies man" title. Way to go dude!!!!!!!!! Well, I gotta get back to work, I still have about an hour and a half before I can get out of here.. Until tomorrow, or later tonight, depending how late it is when I finish watching these 5 dvds :)

       Tough luck, Andrei. Heh, you really make me wanna come over to your place and  have fun  and shit.  As for the web site, I didn't expect you to understand. It was a response to Ivan's post, thus, an inside. And even if it were meant for the general public, I don't think you would get it :).   Also, a funny thing I had observed over a fairly long period of time. Almost everything that comes out of Andrei's mouth appears to be sensational. It relates to any subject, but especially to politics, and especially anything that concerns communism and former Soviet Union. Andrei always has a groundbreaking statement, like Gorbachev is actually Fidel Castro's secret lover, and (this one is my personal favorite) about Americans giving away cash at Moscow's airports to weaken the Geat Russian Economy.   Is it just me or... Andrei really does have a unique perspective thanks to his reliable sources in Kremlin and White House? I think it's just me. Because Andrei doesn't exist. His existence is the star dust; it's all an illusion created by the mad Eastern European scientists to full poor French women into donating ther ovaries to the Fund of International Genetical Improvement. Dear French women, please disregard Andrei and tell your friends to do so as well. Andrei is bad for you.  Okkk. The above is the consequence of sleepless procrastination before allegedly failed midterms and overly successful love life.  Circuits await me in desperate horniness of biased differential pairs and active-mode current mirrors.

       Everything sucks. I have 131euros left in my bank account , and the bursary will come (if ever it will) in the end of January/mid February.   Hmmm... Get the point? Moreover, I didn't have sex for two weeks or more now and one particular girl that I'm running after appears to be a real bitch. (tough luck, heh?) Then, I still didn't find a job that can reverse the slope of my bank account money function. To add, I seem to be willing to subscribe for an extra math course (+5 more hours/week to my schedule), because I find that the course I'm doing is too boring (see the logic?) And to conclude, I'm always hungry, because I'm saving up on food in order to pay my electricity/phone/rent bills. Besides, I don't have any intention of using heating this winter, because it's damn fuckin exencive!  Oh, yes, Sunday I'm going to Church. (That's the good news, I guess).   Anything else? Well, except for reading the sensless note on communism in Vlad's public diary (sorry, 'sensless' is not correct here. There are simply no links between various ideas, so it looks like a mess of diff. thoughts), including, not having access to response/opinion note link directly on the main page like on vladster.net, everything is fine.   Cheers!  By the way, did I tell you that now I can access internet only 3 times a week (lenux only, so all win. program files have to be registered on a disket and taken to another building to the use fo for eg. World)  Later.

       WOW. Waj is back!!!  Well, I'll be doing EC II next semester, too. Provided some weird accidental screwup with marks will let me pass EC I.  Signals are BIG. I think teaching Signals here should require a teacher's knowledge of a martial art. Because, frankly, I can't wait to bump into that Signals guy in a dark corridor holding that ten-inch pole Wajdi was talking about. I would talk to him about Parseval's relation and any other relations he might have questions about and dares not to ask them on a test.  Also, I'm getting sick of living in the same place (Montreal, that is). Wanna go somewhere for the summer (like... Toronto or something). Also, my grandfather came over from Ukraine for a month. So, I now volunteer as a supermarket tour guide.  Cant' wait to hear Waj's exciting story. Andrei, whatz happening in Paris bro? How's the "weather"?

       Hello fellow bloggers, Merry Christmas (dec.25 & jan.7), and Happy New Year.   Paris is doing fine. It's ten degrees rain and sometimes sunshine. Basically I miss winter. But it's ok. Today I accuired a new gf, then decided to be just friends with her, and later in the evening my old gf dumped me for the second time. So from being not single times 2, I'm half single, yet, I'm planning to simply single for new year.   Chistmas was good, ate like a very classy pig; almost bursted from oysters, castrated chickens, cakes, salads, cheeses etc. One of my gifts was a guitar. Planning to start playing. Maybe also take some singing lessons. Shut up. Don't laugh.   Anyhow, I declined a few invitations to New Year parties, and going to go to Champs Elysees. Meet the New Year in the crowd or wandering the streets. Maybe will get in a fight but hopefully just will just have fun and get some interesting thoughts passing through my head. What kind of thoughts? Don't know. Don't care. I just think that the way one meets a the new year, that same way he will live it. (not in the straight foward sense of course).   My final exams are from 22 to 25 of Jan. I have 5 of them. That sucks. Here I'm not allowed to loose any virginities. Besides that...Where is everyone celebrating the 31-1? Who's going to be at Josee's? Viv, will you stat in Toronto? Mu? Fais? Roma? Oh, welcome back Roma, it's been a while. What's new?? I'm sure you've got a pack of nice stories. Fencing, girls, grades, school, interests...  I'm not going to be on the net untill end of fist week of Jan, so see you all later! Have fun, and see you all next year!!!!  Cheers and best wishes to all of you!  Andrei

       hey bloggers, just wanted to wish you all a lovely new year even though we are not all bound to reaching it Vlad, I don't think you are the only one who lost his academic virginity in 2002..what can I say, we were all  very horny and could not wait to lose it...what's this thing about Viv joining the blog, I was not consulted, I guess what this means is not only will we have to write stuff, but we will now have to think, count the number  of words, check the spelling, consult the dictionary and in some instances change languages...hopefully my GPA can increase by 0.2 after this experience....Happy new Year Bloggers.

       Here I am, in the engineering library. Sitting around, surfing the net, checking the building for "unusual activities and extreme temperatures". Nothing to do, really. There is no one. I don't know why they pay me.   Way to go Viv. I've never been to Toronto, but heard a lot of negative stuff about it. Sounds like my kind of city. I met a couple of old  Torontonians  of Russian descent at the Canadian embassy in Ukraine. They were badmouthing Montreal for its dirty streets,  "excessively diverse cultural environment"  (ridiculous as that) and an ardent denial of gas station attendants to speak Russian. Go figure.  But when you really think of it, Montreal is very much European-wannabe. And it's much farther from being European than Toronto is from being American.

       And a stupid, snowy day it is in the American-wannabe city of Toronto...where the army is on stand-by should another 2 cm of snow fall...Just thought I'd let you all know that all is well, despite being in said pseudo-American city.  Had a lovely Christmas and I hope the rest of you did too.  Good to know that engineers have a such an active imagination...I'm sure it'll come in handy when you have to present budgets for your future projects (i.e. the money you want vs. the money you're never going to get... ^_-)...Have no fear, I'm quite resigned to the fact that I'm going to be a research scientist with no future...Anyway, on that happy note, take care all and I'll see you in Montreal!!!

       Yes hello my dear friends. I'm afraid I have some good news for you. Vlad is no longer Vlad. Yep.   Admitting failure is hard. Admitting a failure that could have been prevented is twice as hard. I feel like a retard. So much for being a not-giving-shit smart-ass. I have lost my academic virginity, emotional integrity and, most importantly, a definitive sense of direction that I thought I was born with. The latter could prove to be positive, because, as it turns out, that sense in my mind was based largely on hype, self-persuasion and arrogance. I am not an engineer. It is not because it's hard. It's not hard. Biochemistry is hard. Enginering (I can only speak for electrical) requires scrupulous and soulless screen-staring and crank-turning; and I can't afford to spend my life doing that.  I am not giving up on engineering -- don't get me wrong. I will get my degree and perhaps even do some grad school. Transferring anywhere else is not only unreasonable, but also impossible. The only place that would take me considering this semester's GPA is probably the Arts department. And, although I would immensely enjoy majoring in English, it's clearly not an option.  Twenty years from now, I will probably look back at this time and consider this disgrace as a blessing. It brought me down; it destoyed much of my arrogance and crippled the illusion of successful life at no intellectual expense. It also showed to me how fulfilling it is to have someone close, someone who would accept my bitter self-disappointment in a non-judging manner.

       Well, even though it's a little outdated, for I finished a week ago, here's my post exam outcry. Last Saturday, i.e. the last day of exams for me, the celebration has began, even though not much was to celebrate since the finals didn't go that well. We were with a friend from my program and a bunch of "Francais de France". Surprisingly, what were we doing do you think... drinking. However, the next morning I woke up in "someone's" bed wandering whatdahell I was doing there. Don't get me wrong, I remeber exactly what happened, but I had to suffer the consequences for the whole day after...  stories, anyone else

       Yo. I need more end-of-semester outcries. Don't keep your hatred inside, people. Share your emotions. I don't want to see anyone on J.Cartier.   Sure Viv, anytime. You know my number. Also, Josee, if you're reading this, sorry for not returning your call. I was in the midst of the Electromagnetic fields fury, a very fragile state of not sleeping for 56 hours, when anything could potentially knock me out of balance. I aced the test though.   I have now completely recovered from school. I spend my days sleeping, reading  Professional PHP Programming , and playing pool with my grandfather. I spend my nights sipping Grand Mariner and hm...  bob-marlying  in front of the fireplace with Audrey . Life is splendid, my friends. It's beautiful.  See y'all later,

Ahhhhh...the post-exam crash has finally arrived...And yet, although my last exam was yesterday morning, and I don't   technically   have to be here, I'M BACK AT THE LIBRARY AGAIN!!!!!!!!!  Why????? Why me????  Bloody lab reports - novels, more like...only three of the evil things left to write...but that's ok - no studying required, right? ^_^  Saw The Lord of the Rings last night.  Sooooooooo good.  As much as I loved Harry Potter, this was better.  I'm sure Wajdi will agree. ^_^  Anyway, I'm leaving for TO on the 23rd, so AUDREY (and Vlad and co.^_^) WE HAVE TO GET TOGETHER, it's been waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay toooo long.   Right, that's it for now - nice bird Vlad - gotta finish my Christmas shopping.

       This semester is quasi-over. I am about to pull a stunt of the century by passing EM Fields having attended exactly 4 lectures and peering over the course outline for two nights.   It was a dumb semester, if you ask me. I'm all good now, except to EC. The easiest freakin' course. I don't know how I could do bad. Let's hope I won't have to do it again.  The usual next-semester-will-be-different crap follows.  I can't wait to do nothing. This pace is debilitating. I want a good book. Something I like. Like PHP and MySQL stuff. I find reading software books intertaining. Plus, I might as well make some money with that over the next few months. Yey.

       [ There is smoke blurring the landscape on the far horizon. A stench of burnt metal and dessicated corpses fill up the fowl air. A war happened in this location in not a distant time. It is obvious by the absence of life and the silence of death that the outcome was anything but disastrous. Suddenly there is movement observed. Upon closer inspection, the movement is found to be only random agitations of dismembered limbs firing their last nerve signals. There are still lingering sounds of last human cries and haunting sounds of people gasping for air and choking from their own trickling blood from their perforated throats. But there is still a reigning deafening silence that governs the entire show. May these poor souls rest in peace ]  Needless to say that exam i talked about in my previous blog was not good  for anyone, study or not.  sigh.

       Alright my friends, I am to embark on an important mission which will test my guts and base of knowledge. Yes I will go through a test of courgage. In about 3 hours I will do the hardest exam of my biological career. It is the course of molecular biology. Mulanda you must know a little about this. The first midterm class average was 25, and the second was 50. Most likely , the average will be between the both, therefore, I will take a different course to ensure victory. I  have not studied and will not . I am waiting for the clock to tick away till showdown. I am trying reverse strategy with this one. Wish me luck my friends. If ever I do not make it back in one piece, I would like to tell all of you that I love you all very much, and tell my parents I love them too. Until the next time.  Most sincerely

So who ever wants to use my formula of ultimate saving, give me a HELL YEAH and we will get down and dirty with the ultimate search for the lowest price.   Well right now, I am bidding for a Cisco wireless card so I can hook up to Concordia's wonderful hubs and ummm use it for ummm "educational" purposes where I am not ALLOWED to use Kazaa, but at the same time...NOT restricted...so its all fun and games from there mah people...

       Ok,  :) Well, news...  -I'm working at a hotel 2min away from my house from 20:00 to 00:00 every night, preparing conference rooms. Not too difficult, good music (midnight bluze (spelling??)) , lots of various drinks, white shirt, tie... Style. :) Paid min=7euro/hour.  -School: failing everything.   -Girls: no threesums (yet), one g-f who somehow always ends up fucking me (I know, it's humiliating to say for a guy, but somehow I feel that that's the way it is. Probably I'll just break up to stop it.) Also, today made a fool out of myself while being with a girl I really like in school. (Maybe it's more precise to say "a complete idiot and a vulgar pig).  -Sports: nothing, but lots of will to do some.  -Attitude: sloppy (probably too much fun).  -Weight: lost approx. 5kg this week due to lack of food and sleep.   Conclusion: fuck the conclusion (oops, do I have be aware of my vocabulary since Viv has joined the blog?)  Jeka, I don't know what I have on my mind. (And why would Viv know?? Viv: shhhh!!!)   Good luck to all those doing thier tests soon. (I.e. to you all, I guess).  Waj, can you steal a laptop for me, plzz, from the future shop?  Later!

       I am THE here!!!!!!!!!!  Well, since I last wrote, my latest project was scamming Future Shop. How you ask? Easy my dear friends. All you need are two things. A Future Shop card and a good solid hour searching on the internet. ahem ahem...now I will use an example: Lets say you want to buy an ATI Radeon 9700 Pro (wooooo...woooow)...and we all now its like freakin 600 bucks at fshop right? Well my dear friends, just look on the internet for legit websites and you will eventually find it being sold for 550 dollars, maybe even 530. Now I proved my theory, so this works guaranteed. Go to Futureshop and tell them to give you the lowest price guarantee, and show them the website. They will lower the price to 530 and give you a 10% discount on top of the reduction!!!!!!!!!! then put it on your Future shop card and pay it over 3 months INTEREST FREE!!!!!!  Yes, this is what I have been doing with my free time other than learning Mandrake 9. Which is GREAT to start learning Unix :)  So aside from the ultimate geek project, I am counting down the days before my freedom ends and I go back to the ball and chain of electronics 2 and Fourier Transforms.......Fourier is lucky he is dead, because if he werent...OOOOOOOOOOH its not funny what I would of done to that #@$%&. Im pretty sure the other engineering folks in here will agree with me. Well, time to get back to work. Remember, there is no way like the cheap way...RAPE FUTURE SHOP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! for all its worth....  ciao chicos and chiquitas

       Hi Waj. Lon gtime no see. I say fuck school. It's not a worthy subject of conversation. I can't wait to get out. My school is where public rape is endorsed, if not enforced; where the notion of the real world is unknown, if not detested. My teachers can't hold up any non-technical conversation without comparing life to VLSI circuit design. McGill Engineering Department is a place for Princeton grads who haven't made it to Intel or IBM labs. It must be shitty to be  almost good enough . At least I know I suck.

       Hello all,  how is everyone doing? Everyone good?

Andrei, how you holding up in Europe? Everything good?  If anyone has a worse day than me let me know, cause I went staright from 8:45 am to 11 pm, and after each hour I wish I had atleast a basic computer class or even better some kind of DRINKING class, where you just drink everything away!!!!!!!! yeahl, that sounds good...  im gonna go to bed.....l8r peeps

       Whatever Vlad, I guess you just didn't have anything to say.   Anyhow, just finished my final exams. About an hour or so. As usual I feel emptyed and dissapointed. I've been studing since the 5th of January and probably managed to screw up. If I won't pass, then I must be a real jack-ass. And the worst is that I can aknowledge that all my tests were doable and not too long, but I feel that I will most likely fail two of them (out of five).  Ha! During my last test I left half an hour early just because I really wanted to piss. I don't care. You do. I don't. (If you don't then your not my friend.)   I'm sorry, I shouldn't be telling you things.   Oh, yes, I have friends visiting from Russia. Today I left for the exams when they still were sleeping. So I locked them inside my appartment, and they had to leave by the window.  Two weekends ago I went to London to see a circus show.   My second semester starts of monday. I might go to Bretagne or to Corse meanwhile. (If I'll get the money. So far I'm in -200 euros).  Anyway, are you being alive in Canada? Who is doing what? Stories, events, everyday routines?? I decided to say in Europe untill august, so see you not soon, but you can keep me updated.   Cheers.

       Yo dudes...Tomorrow there is a Talent Show at Concordia. I am gonna perform, as well as all kinds of other people, dancers singers, musical bands. It took a lot of time to organize but it's gonna be nice. An audience of about 250 people is expected. You all have to come and watch it's gonna be amazing. It costs only $10 if you buy a ticket before or $12 at the door. Call me tomorrow during the day if you want to come (514)815-1476. Or go there directly, Concordia Hall building, D.B. Clarke theatre, 1st floor. You have to be there it's gonna be awesome. Doors open at 7pm, beginning of show at 8pm.  Later dudes.

       Yes, it is 12:20 am and I am posting at this time. I don't know if that's the case for everyone, but Jeka is going through a kind of a stressfull time. Let's see...working full time 5 days a week (thank god the pay is good), going to school two nights a week, dancing 3 to 4 times a week, doing homework-should be happening every week-end, competing - as of February almost evry Saturday, got involved with a student committee at school - events are coming up in a week or so. Is there any possibility two extend the day by a few hours, say up to 27 or 28? Anyone knows?  P.S. We are holding a talent show at Concordia on the 22nd, i.e. next Wed. , I'm performing. If interested let me know, tickets are $10.

       Kinky questions, huh?  Well, you can ask all you like...I just may not answer anything...^_- By the way, the elderly man who had an accident at Ste.-Anne's died on an EXPERT hill, NOT la for�t enchant�e (which is rated as a beginners hill, by the way - whoever came up with that asenine rating was definitely drunk at the time...)

       Hey people, did you hear about a guy dying on Mt.St.Anne last weekend? They said he crashed in the  for�t enchant�e... , which  urlLink Vivienne had strongly recommended  to us. Well, thanks a lot, Viv. Too bad we didn't go there -- missed some hard-core action.  Also, Viv, I will be emailing you soon with some kinky questions. Be excited.

Pourqoi ne pas faire un mini party avec tout le monde, peux-etre ce week-end. On n'a pas pu se rencontrer tous ensemble durant les fetes et on n'aura pas le temps non plus durand la session... Alors, qui veux boire en fin de semaine?  Ciao

Does anyone know why those fuckign biochemists are so smart?". Hm...  One thing's for sure: if an engineer wears a bandana, he is not in biochem.   Ahem. Yes. There./  P.S. Find two mistakes: Vivianne is in biochem.

       My idealistic concept of being satisfied with life:  Manually flying in a space ship in a very tight corridor, walls made of of multi-million-degree plasma, where any minisclule deviation from the precisely assigned trajectory would mean  immediate and unconditional death.    Don't roll your eyes. Think about it.   You life depends solely on your ability to steer. Since you're still alive, you're damn good. And death is painless. So you're not scared. And yet you continue to steer...

       Hey everyone! I know I've been talking about a ski trip for months but here's the deal: If you're interested, I'm planning a weekend this upcoming week end... We would probably drive up friday night to mont saint anne in two cars and stay at a chalet which I have to make reservations for.... So if you're interested, the two days ski passes and chalet would add up to approx 146$ each if we're 8.  So if that seems like something some of you could afford, please make your reservations by calling the clijo motel tomorrow at 1 514 845 3305 or contact the head office at 1 514 668 1337.  Thank you and the entire staff at the clijo motel wishes you a safe trip!

       A belated thanks for the welcome on my part, I've been busy sleeping...And I'm afraid I'll have to refuse the more than generous (and tempting) offer of group sex, can't we just all be friends? :p Especially if some of us think snowblading to be more pleasurable than the act itself, are you sure you've been doin' it right cash??...

       Oh, I forgot; the ones going skiing try "snowblades". That thing rules!! Ultimate fat burner and pleasure generator. Better than skiing, better than sex (personnal opinion). Yet, I can't compare it to skydining, since I still don't realize that I did it.  If you'll try it, be sure to have lots of snow around, unless of course you're a pro. :))

       Yet another message from me�this time in a language all of you � I hope � understand�  Just got home from Toronto.  Quite proud of myself as I didn�t throttle my darling little brother � although the thought did cross my mind�^_- especially when he woke me up by spraying water in my face last night�although, in all fairness, I did the same to him the day before�  Well, Andrei, it appears you're having a smashing time in France - let's just hope that doesn't hold true for your skiing...^_- Oh, by the way, your new screen name suits you.  ^_-  As for the rest of you, (although this DEFINITELY applies to Andrei, as well) glad to hear you're all getting geared up for all the studying you're NOT going to do this semester...Right, it�s 10:30 and I�m about to keel over from exhaustion � never EVER travel with people whose concept of �travelling light� is three suitcases EACH!!!!!!!!!  See u all (most of you, at any rate) next week!

       Also, guys. Should any one of you have spare computer (PC) parts that would eventually end up in the dump, I will greatly appreciate your generosity. I am particularly interested in video cards, hard drives, network cards and RAM.   Just screwing around with my old workstation. Experimentation is fun. Linux rulez. I've been cheating on my super high-mantenance Windows XP lately. We might break up soon.

       Hello to you all!!!  Welcome to this new 2003 year. I hope it will treat you well.   My New Year's celebration was ok. I met new year on Champs Elysses. It was a huge crowd! People singing, shouting drinking, dancing, pushing, stepping on everyone's feet, etc. Basically some new interesting experience. At some point I thought that some people were stuffed in the crowd, but no, I didn't see any corpses. After that I went to a "bourgeoi" French party. On my way there I bought some boxes with cookies and put them near sleeping bums. Hope there were happy when they woke up.   Then the party was fine (as any party with drinking & dansing people, hot girls, flirting, making-out and other social non-sense.) Around 4am I went with my ex-gf to her house and for the rest of the night & day we got back together. On the 1st in the evening I had a dinner with a friend and then, throughout the night, I was watching TV and packing my bag to leave to Annecy. It's east of Lyon and south of Geneva. Near Alpes.  Now I'm here for 4 days and maybe I will go skiing if the temperature will drop to it's normal state of -10 degrees, from +15.   Best wishes to you all again, and see you this year!

       Hello my dear friends. Last year (2002) was the worst year in my so long-lived life. Therefore, I made myself a very significant resolution for 2003, like anyone cares anyway. So I just want to wish you all a Happy New Year and all that you want wish yourselves. I mean it would have been possible for me to wish those things to some of you in person if Josee were kind enough to let me back in her place last night, but I guess she was quite "tired and busy". So have a very successful year everyone and keep in touch...

       I also think that the myth of steady and prosperous future in the domain of study is the primary driving force for most "fresh" students. And for quite a few people, it always stays just a myth...  Like, for instance, my studing now of energy concepts in quantum theory (for fun) and my naive idea of descovering something new, like... something worth a nobel price... awwwww...

       German is nice to learn if you have people to practice with and a good teacher . Good as in "who speeks  german with no accent".When I took courses, the first few days were dedicated  to the familiarisation of the mechanism of the language. You look at the grammar and learn funny sentences by heart such as"  du bist dick und faul...eine cola bite!   "  Then, when you past this stage you need to hear a lot of conversation. A lot! The structure of sentences is specific, like french, but the order is diffrent. No, I don't find it's a hard language, but I find it useless if you don't have anyone to practice with. I had 2 years of German. I can read it, but its almost impossible for me to converse.   Anyways, it's a nice language.

       Vlad, what have you done...What is this russian language conspiracy...I can't even make secret posts anymore :( (I even suspect Vlad typing this up, to trick us)  The booklet you posted Vlad, isn't the Papal Bull prohibiting Catholics to join secret societies, such as freemasons, or smth ? For some reason the Church always had major beef with Masons, I guess there are some serious matters involved.  As for linux...err..royalty-free open source is good...some losers code for you, and then you take their work, customize to your needs and make money out of it.(For example Google uses linux on its backend servers). And those who actually coded it from ground up, get big round zero...nice. Open source and royalty free licneses is an amazing invention, I just love these enthusiastic people.Work, bitches, work!  BTW, BiBi, did you study German, is it difficult to learn ?

       The second story... Well, it didn't happen to me, I was just told by a few people (again from Africa) about some rumers that ran around the places where those free-ones practiced, and that everybody in their city and neigboring villages avoided their "churches" and houses where they gathered and all the surroundings of the latter.   They told me that horrible things happened there, but nobody knew what, and that nobody talked about it out loud. Well, that's all the second story, which does sound simply like superstisious rumers of the villagers. However, I can say that the person who is a free mason from Africa, whom I know, was very nice and even attractive, (eventhough didn't have big boobs). She didn't tell me anything about her practice, because she didn't practice anything along with her family. She was just a part of them and went to some parties of theirs, which were just as usual any anything. Yet, you can ask Alex the cool (if anyone still has his bussiness card) he knows her better.   Cheers!

       Hmmmm... free masons... I'll tell you two stories of mine... (don't say "oh, dear" it's nothing extra ordinary.   So, first one happened in Vanier. Once I asked one of my  teachers (before I dropped that course) if he knew anything about free masons. He strangy looked at me, let out a small laughter and told me to follow him to the office. Once there, he told me to sat down and asked me why am I'm interested in this question. I said that for no particular reason, so he smiled (or "usmehnulsia) and laughed again. He said that normally all the rumers about the sicret government of the world (which is composed of free masons) and are not proven and probably just rumers. I smiled, nodded an "ok" and looked at him waiting for continuation. He asked me again what did I wanted exactly to know. So I said that I have a friend from South Africa, who's dad owns an airlane company and whos entire family had to join free masonery "for further bussiness relations of her dad", and that it was cool, but she didn't know much about it. So since it was "cool", I want to know more about it. My teacher gave me deep rapid look, said "uuummm", then stared at me for a moment and replyed that it's a particular organisation but he doesn't know much about it. He aslo added that it is true that people with money and power usually get involved with masonery, such as for example his brother who after becoming a considerable financial in his country of origin also joined the masons.   That's pretty much all he said (or maybe more, but I don't remember, so may be something impertinent). All the conversation didn't last long at all because he didn't have much time, yet he suggested to me some books that may interest me upon the subject (that I don't remember the names). That was the only conversation we had about that. A few weeks later, when I dropped his course, he told me to never, ever even think of taking his classes, or going anywhere near them (that's because I didn't notify him about my dropping his course in advance and screw up a entire lecture, where I was suppose to give an oral for like an hour on some chapter of the text book).

       Holly cow. That stuff sounds very seductive.  From what I read on that site (history of freemasonry), these guys are public because they are "operational" or "accepted" masons. I guess the "real" masonry is pretty tough to get into.

        (continuation of previous post  on individualism)   So then i informed Carlos that it was equally very easy for me to get the same attire and look as you, and to develop the same pseudo-philosophical thinking and call myself an individual. But, would I be then an individual? Changing your look, as in dress code, or behaviour is not a sign of individualism or conformity, it is simply a passtime. What makes an individual then  , i asked to Carlos. By now, he was pretty stumped, for he did not expect to lash back at him with these arguments. He expected me to laugh and tell him his right, right before i worship him. So his answer was then, " dude, the answer to what is an individual , is an individual opinion". Finally, some wise words out of his mouth. "What other key aspect makes you an individual Carlos?" I asked. He remained silent. I said, "your idealogy, your ideas. Your ideas are based upon your knowledge and your beliefs. No one can change that with ease, and it is extremely rare to find someone with the exact idealogy on everything, as you. No one can dictate you what idealogy to maintain. Furthermore, it is extremely difficult to change your ideas as whimsically as your hair or your shoes."   "So, Carlos, QED?"  he then asked what it meant, and i said, "drink your beer"   poker was fun that night.

       Mr. Dostoevsky only complicates things a lot.He, just like any other romanist doesn't analyzes them, conclusions are to be made by readers, always. And a good writer is someone who makes you think, IMHO.  About wearing corporate clothes. If you get stripped of your clothes, you're all pretty much the same, despite slight variations in size. (I guess it's not the size of your pants that makes you all corporate or entirely hippie.). So, did G-D decide to give us corporate bodies?  Unless absolutely random events falls under category of "GOD" too, I do not believe.  People just like superstition, hopes for someone to come and save them, do everything for them, etc-etc. su-per-sti-tions.  P.S. Devils is indeed correct (or conventional) translation of one of his works.

       I'm with you on that one, Fais.  No one is more naive than a misinformed hippie with strong beliefs.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but our DNA is lees that 5% different from the rat's. So yes, I do believe DNA is more or less irrelevant when it comes to one's social persuasions.   Dostoevski didn't really solve anything. He was a master of  ethical conflict and suspense -- no doubt about that -- but I don't think he is a good reference in this discussion. Then again, it's my personal view.

       Individuals, individuals, individuals... We are all individuals because we are flattered to be. But remember that our DNA differs from one another less then by 1%. If one believes that DNA is irrelevant, then he/she should try believing in God, in souls, and in creation. But it's not the point. I just don't know.   Maybe reading Dostoevski's works could help. He relates to all such questions all the time and analyses them quite well. Yet, I'm not sure that there any good enough translations to reveal all the subtilities. You can always try. Something like "Devels" or even the old "Crime and Punishment" may do. (I'm not sure if "Devels" is a correct translation of "BESI")

       so this is my funny little tale.   I decided to regroup with some past high school friends. We were four of us around a table playing poker, and having heinekens. One of the people present was a brasilian friend of mine, Carlos. Let me give you a little physical description of him. He wears the corduroy pants with holes in the knee joints and the heel. He usually wears a shirt of Chavez or someone of the zapatistas. So he looked at me wearing dress pants and dress shoes as well as a dress shirt. And he said that I was a conformist and decadent. Now the point I raised then was how do you know I am not an individual ? He said well, you dress like corporate people and are not individul man! , so were his exact words. However, he thought he was an individual  because of clothes he wore that could raise some eyebrows. So I proceeded to tell him, Carlos I have seen 20 000 other motherfuckers like you, with the same attire and not to mention the same flow of voice and speaking. How does that make you an individual?  Im late for class, Ill continue later.

       Roman, clarify :). I'm not sure it's me.   Waj, the important part in my post is that you're actually recognized by the people who know you. That proves that the first imnpression that the person gets is objective. Anyway. Yeah.   Also, I don't remember who said it but here's a good point from my Einstein book: human genius is highly specialized. If someone is a great man of science, you don't necessarily have to accept his authority in international relations, religion etc...

       BOOM SHAKALAKA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  you want to see a noteworthy asshole? Spend 5 minutes, no make that 2 minutes with my lab instructor for my telecom class. That guy is THE noteworthy asshole, no questions asked. Vlad, I completely agree with you.  In a way, I find it a bit wrong that we hold to our first impressions about someone. For all we know, the person we think is an arrogant asshole, was probably having a bad day or was caught on a weird day, and they really are interesting people who are nothing like we think they are. It happened to me actually.  Last year, I guess I was having a bad day and I was talking to this girl, and a year later after we became better friends she told me I wasnt so nice last year and that she thought I was one of those A$$es...but she said that it was only that one time, and that I was a nice person blah blah blah. It is insane how important first impressions are.....so insane, that it is a bit wrong.  Reading this over, I just realized the contradiction I made about my lab instructor. But when I come to think of it, its not really. Beacuse I knew him for a good year and all he was, was an ass. So I stand by my case and say AHEM AHEM......"BAAAAAAAAAAAAM"  cheers

       Let's say you meet someone for the first time and talk to him for a few minutes. That person then expresses his opinion about you in one generic sentence -- without revealing your identity -- in the circle of people who know you. If you're instantly recognized, then, in my uderstanding, you're an individual.   Notice that the above says nothing about what makes you stand out. You could be an asshole, while still being a noteworthy individual. It takes talent to be a noteworthy asshole. It take talent to be a noteworthy anything.

       virtualave.com  They place a huge banner but I know a way to completely get around that. Send me your new email address, I'll send you the code. Also, do you have a picture online?  As for grad studies, here's what I think. At this point, you should break your head more about what exactly you'd like to do in terms of grad work, i.e. communications, guidance, robotics, software, hardware etc. And then ask around (including your profs) about what school does more of what.

       My average is still well above average for admission into graduate studies(or so I think, is upper B+'s good enuff?) , which is quite unfortunate, since now I have to break my head over all these choice, dammnit.

       Jerry! Jerry! Jerry! JERRY: Tonight on the Jerry Springer show we have a particularly interesting episode! vladster is here to finally confess something to a long-time friend of his Andrei. So everyone please put your hands together for vladster! Jerry: Okay, now vladster you're here to talk about someone aren't you? Vladster: Yes. Jerry: And what is this other persons name? Vladster: Audrey. The crowd SQUEALS with delight. Jerry: Okay, okay, well Audrey, is actually here tonight - The crowd SQUEALS. Jerry: But first we have a surprise for you vladster, because as it happens there is someone else here to see YOU! So let's bring out... Fais! Vladster: What the HELL!!! Out of nowhere Vladster pulls out a knife. Fais reaches for the chair. Out of the shadows Josee appears. Josee: Wait everybody wait! Jerry: Yes, everybody let's just calm down for a moment here. First tell us why you're here Fais. Fais: Because I saw vladster and Josee making out at Piano Bar! The crowd goes absolutely INSANE. Josee: That's a lie! I was home watching "Who wants to marry a millionaire"! Jerry: (raising his hands) Hold on, hold on, I'm missing the problem here...what exactly IS the problem Fais? Fais: Because I've recently been taking part in a sexual relationship with Andrei who has recently become engaged to Josee. The crowd hollers, screams and whoops in an orchestra of orgasmic excitement. Jerry: Okay, okay. Well why don't we bring Andrei out here because vladster had something that they needed to tell them anyway about... Audrey that's right! Andrei: (enters onto stage and saunters over towards you) What's the deal? I saw you outside getting it on with Audrey! You know I'm how I feel about Audrey!. Josee: (screams) What? Why the hell did you ask me to marry you if you're in love with Audrey! Andrei: Because I knew that I could never have Audrey. But vladster promised me that they'd never hook up out of respect for my feelings! Josee: What about respect for MY feelings! Fais walks suddenly across the stage, embracing Andrei. Fais: Don't worry baby, you don't need any of them now that you have me. Again the crowd SQUEALS. Josee: Oh my God! Are you SICK! Josee runs across the room and wraps their arms around Vladster tightly. Josee: vladster take me away from all of this! Vladster: You see? That's the thing...I'm...well, I'm married... The crowd does its bit. Josee: Married? Vladster nods. Josee: Who the hell are you married to? When...when did this happen? I don't understand! Vladster: The other day. In Vegas. I'm married to Audrey. Andrei: (screaming) WHAT!!! Jerry: (grinning widely, makes an enquiry) So...did you have a nice wedding night? Audrey: (stepping back out onto center stage) Well we had sex 13 times if that's what you mean. The crowd squeals. Jerry: Okay, okay. So let me get this all straight... vladster is married to Audrey who Andrei has secretly been in love with for years and years. Now Andrei has recently become engaged to Josee who was recently spotted kissing vladster in the Piano Bar. Now on top of this Fais has just admitted to being in a sexual relationship with Andrei. Audrey: That's right Jerry. Jerry: (looking sternly into the camera) It is times like these that one has to wonder, whether or not these people are aware that they are quite clinically insane. Perhaps we should be spending more on psychiatric health funds in this country, perhaps we should just ban Vegas to cut down on impulse marriages. Perhaps I should get a new job. Thanks for watching folks it's been great but for now...it's goodnight. Queue cheesy background music and fade to black.    Boys go here .  Gals go here.

       At the rate that I was going last semester, the only institution that will consider me will be the Department of Geography at the University of New-Brunswick (sp?). This semester looks OK. We'll see how it goes. How's stuff at U of O?  Fais, could you clarify the question? Do you mean the individuality in principle, i.e. on the social scale? Or is it more in the "what one's worth" domain?

       If I remember correctly some of the bloggers here once were very eager to continue their education up to masters and ph.d degrees...especially Vlad. Has anyone thought of possibilities to do masters in Europe ? Say in countries like Germany, or Sweden, where education quality is ok, but tutition is just 0$. even for foreigners. I'm still thinking about this one, and I wanna know what do you guys think. Will a degree from Europe be valuable as much as one from Canada or US ? etc-etc.

       The video is actually a short piece of the Vice-Speaker of the Parliament of the Russian Federation's addressing the Iraq problem to the President of the United States during the former's visit to Bagdad in September 2002. What he says here is the following ( literary  translation): "Fucking blow-job lovers! Masturbators, faggots!" [This is to George W. along with Clinton].   I'm serious. I can show you the whole thing.  My take on what makes an individual is to follow.

       Exactly my point Vlad! Just like I have described, without trying to listen to the actual topic you are posting your opinion which is an insight about the author, i.e. me. I guess I can extend the list now to some men as well. Nonetheless, I think that a more precise categorisation of people having this kind of reaction doesn't lie in their sexual belongings. It rather depends on the level of self-persuation they have upon their understanding and analysing to a superior level of people they communicate with, and life situations they encounter. Moreover, I stronly believe that it doesn't relate to the level of their arrogance envers others. It may be more of a self-stating reaction, sort of "I too can see people/things". (I'm not trying to offend anyone here, god forbid). Nither I'm in a position of being dumped or insatisfied with my life. I just enjoy sharing some of my thoughts, hoping that someone could share, i.e. appreciate or criticize, my thoughts and observations.   Oh, I do apologise if my comparison to "I too can see people/things" may sound shallow, I'm indeed a bit exagerating just to pass a point. Yet, again it doesn't mean that that point is right, so argue if you feel like anything on the latter.   God, do you see how many irrelevant, to the actual topic that I have posed a few post ago, sentences I needed to add, in order to clarify my intention not to offend anyone during my discussion, to proove that my subject is actually the one I want to discuss and that it is not hiding my libido experiences according to Freud, nor any other inner problems or something like that.   Now, did you already forget the real topic? I wouldn't be surprised if you did. That's how much of disturbing bla-bla I think I needed to add in order to convince, for instance, Vlad, that he doesn't need to do my psycoanalysis here; rather, he can say if he has noticed similar reactions in people or not, or, if he didn't pay any attention. Is that really that hard to believe that someone simply wants to discuss something without trying to proove a point to others?? Is that really that hard to accept that one may just want to hear your opinion on the subject posed, and not to hear you say that that subject is bullshit and that the author is having problems?? I know, that's the answer with no effort what-so-ever, and with lack of respect to the author as well.  Finally, having said all that, you may think that I'm mad or upset. Not at all. I was just diverged into thoughts upon some reactions of people in some circonstances. If someone feels that I'm trying to describe anyone in particular, YOU ARE WRONG. Of course, the traits mentioned abouve are found in most of people, including ME and YOU in different instants of life. Don't take it personal, and don't assume that I'm generalising or categorising. Life is more compex than the single instanteneous pulsations I'm bringing your attention to here (duhh).  Did I really have to say all that bla-bla?? I feel emptied and dissapointed since I have grearly diverged my self from the original interesting obserbation I have made, and since now it's impossible to continue the topic I wanted to discuss because you're probably eager to reply to what I have wrote here, which to me personnaly doesn't represent significant interest, because I feel I can anticipate the way it will uncover itself. (Or surprise me)

       Hey, pretending being a philo has nothing to do with it. And Vlad, you didn't get it right. I'm just trying to describe to you an observation I made while talking with 19 to 26 year old women in France one on one, and who all had similar symptoms of holding a conversation. Moreover, it conserned only a certain kind of topics, where I would have to, at some point, explain to them some things that are in relation to their lives, or to lives of people they can relate to. During other topics particularly where one doesn't see a direct application of the propelled ideas to their routine, which would consist in an effort, the evoqued mind processes didn't seem to be an interesting matter for noticing, since during those moments, I was deeply absorbed by the actual topic of the conversation.  Another thought: talking with men usually (or practically always) consists of being involved in the topic of conversation, which disregards the idea of thinking about something else meanwhile.   In conclusion, an easy excuse not to continue the discussion upon my observation would be simply to call the topics resulting in answers in question "sentimental bullshit", yet, I would disagree with this statment, because it is based on a momentary logically derived generalisation. I promise there is more to it than that. As a future perspective, I could suggest to try to observe similar reactions in canadian women (or men), it's not really hard. An example could be the british lady writing feminist comments regarding Vlad's posts in January on his site.

       Do you mean it's the idea that I'm willing to communicate to the public I'm referring to by approaching a point about morals in the audience? Or is it the audience that communicates an insight about the point I critisize that persuades the otherwise incompetent public?  If any of the above is true, then the only insight I'm getting from your oral and written communications is that you can't build a normal sentence. And when my convoluted mind elaborates on the said insight, I tend to conclude that you can't think clearly either.   People who can't think clearly should not be trusted.

       ...  Some people have persuaded me that any communication (verbal or written) gives the person you are communicating to, first of all, an insight into YOUR being (your problems, belifs, wishes, morals, etc), especially if you're trying to approach a point about your audience, rather than the idea that you are willing to communicate to them. It somehow seemed that through entire monologues (short or long) they were thinking how to answer or critisize seldom points chosen in your idea, while being or permanently convinced in their proper opinion, or setting aside their opinion on the topic in question (related to your lisnener or people he relates to), or, sometimes, even ignoring that the existence of latter. Finally, their answer was composed of either comments on the seldom parts randomly assembled, either on introducing a more global opinion upon my seeing of the topic, yet all the time it ended in imposing their opinon (idea, long comment, etc) on ME, and in the worst case in suggestions of what I need, should, could, and must.   I just find it an amusing and educating in some sort observation. Curiously, here I'm reffering to mostly women aged 19 to 26 of various backgrounds and nationalities, well brought up and educated, and with whom I had the chance to experince this observation more than once and on various levels. With men it may be a bit different but I can just make assumptions and pattern matching, since I haven't been in search of experimental data (except myself and rarely my friends). But I'm not denying anything. ...

       Cool; a part of it indeed touched some common references to myself and maybe to others while being an article for a large public. (Why do I feel that this sentence sounds pejorative). Anyhow, it's an interesting article.

       So what if people from your high school work at MacDonald's? Am I supposed to apologize or something? Are you some kind of a standard reference of "success" that we all ought to adhere to?

       By the way, did you know that John Kiriakis (the smart dude from Mech eng.) is a manager at McDonnald's? As well as some other people I know from my ex-high school who are working as manages at some of those 'Fast places' mentioned, and who are keeping those jobs as the clean part-time good fast student cash.  Anyhow, it's not a worthy topic of discussion (I find). Besides that, I passed all my exams and all my courses, exept one that I'm going to declare as "dropped" and to which I never went and doesn't count.   I'm also quite sick. My throat is desguasting and I'm going to probably take some antibiotics.   Later!

       Thanks Mulanda. I am pretty relaxed this semester. Timely studying is the best way to avoid stress altogether. I know it sounds hypocritical, but that's the way it is. It's all about will power.  Waj, I normally allow those people to use their opportunity to be stars for a minute or two. You know, poor guy is a manager at Tim Hortons. What is he going to see in his life? Let the kid be the boss. I believe in the random act of kindness. Which brings me to my next useless monologue..  Those uber eager Tim Hortons (McDonald's, Dunkin Donuts, Second Cup etc.) managers are also very interesting from a rookie observational philosopher's (i.e. mine) point of view. The funny thing about these people is that those who they boss around will on average be far better off in life than them. Many of us here had done some shitty filing/serving/dishwashing at some point; and it's OK for a fast-cash temp student job... But if you find yourself "promoted" to be a manager at McDonald's, I suggest you be very, very scared. Arrogant as it may sound, we all think that way deep inside. Of course, all people fulfill their own very important duties in the society, but... you know...   P.S. Wajdi, and Faisal, send me your pics please.

        Well Vlad, I completely agree with you. I am not going in to detail about my experiences. So we will leave that topic as is...  Well, lastnight me and a few friends went bowling and daaaaaaamn it went nuts. There was a Harvey's there and well some of my friends wanted to eat, so they ordered food, and the girl at the cash threw the money back at them and said, "this is fake, I am not going to take it" and she went NUTS!!!! she ran to the back and wanted to call the cops, but the bill was real, we got it checked at another counter.   The girl was MESSED!!!! and then some chump who decided to be the big boy in all of this, comes to "control" things, but ends up annoying everyone cause of his macho attitude. I took one look at him and just laughed, he was wearing a dress shirt, tucked in to his TRACK PANTS!!! (no offence to anyone who does that, but I just find it wrong). Yeah, so long story short, she refused to let anoyone of us order food and she would make a crying fit about it to not serve us. So yeah, that was GREAT!!!!!!!

Meeting at Caf� l'Etranger (St-Cathetine in front of Cenre Eaton) at either noon (or 13:00) or around 16:00 o'clock. Then we'll take a walk or a ride to Vanier, or simply hang around downtown like in the old days.   Cheers! See you on thursday!  Oh, yeah, somene needs to call lazy bloggers like Doris, Viv, Hos�e and others. Happy Birthday everybody!    For those who can't make it tomorrow or on thursday, then meeting this week-end (Friday, Sartuday or Sunday) again around noon, unticipating the heavy 20-&-something years weighting on our sholders and stopping us from partying at night, at something like Piano Bar!

In May, though, expect a complete upside-down. We will be converting to  urlLink Movable Type , baby, yeah. Posting here will become more convenient, robust and centralized. No more blogger-dependence. There will be a login page right here on vladster.com. I know you're excited.  By the way I've been to Vanier. It's still there, in case you're wondering.

       Wow, looks like my kind of fun. :)  Well, here when I go to class minding my own business, people who pass by... pass by minding their own business. Pretty funky, huh? Political, cultural and general apathy reigns here despite the small group of people trying to imitate the non-existent ghost community of fun-lovin' beer-drinkin' song-singin' engineers. Mind you, living in an apathetic community is not necessarily a bad thing. Everyone needs to be alone sometimes. I actually enjoy this side of McGill.   I have conducted a personal quest for public opinion during the past few weeks, and let me tell you, the results are somewhat surprizing. Many people here in the ECE are here for the glory. Most don't yearn to design circuits upon graduation. Some want to do MBA, others Law. The rest continues because it would be a shame to switch after 3 years.    Of course, there are a few bright sonovabitches who do well no matter what. I didn't get any intelligible feedback from them due to the language barrier. I have yet to discover a source of such a strong drive to study.  And then there is Ivan.

       Hey Vlad, just a little preview of what lies ahead for you in Concordia.  This morning, I was going up to my class minding my own business when I see this naked guy running down the hallway, with "Art Matters" written on his chest. (And people with cameras taking pictures of him and everybody screaming). These arty manifestations are much better than the political ones.

       It took two years of frustrating self-persuasion and slippery studying habits. Lack of interest lead to surface learning and introduced my once spoiled elitist mind to the dreadful world of mediocrity. A desperate urge for a strong decision was amplified by maturing process and discovery of genuine interests in life.  I hope that answers the question. :)

       Hey yo, welcome new bloggers, it's been a while. Well, practically nothing new here, my mid terms start tomorrow. Read some really cool books. And I'll look into your recommendation Fais. Vlad, I'll try to send you some pic of mine, the one posted has embarrased me for long enough.   Other news... I'm staying in France untill at least 1st of august. Last Sunday I visited the cemetory of St-Genevieve de Bois. Saw tumbes of Ivan Bunin, Rudolf Nureev, Tolstoys, Iusupovs, cadets of Tcar, Trotckih, etc. Makes me realize what we (Russians) have lost.   Also met some Russian people in Paris. Lyed that I'm Canadian-Russian and spoke French to them. Disgracefull.   Vlad, if you feel like switching out of Engineering, I say go for it.  Jeka, congrads, hope to see you do the same at Bercy.   Later.

       The lounge will stay as is for now. I will consider MT for my blog when I have some time to burn. Iframes is a good idea.

       Yeah... Decided to go with MT in the end. It's not that bad on server resources, probably because their code is pretty refined.  Anyways Vlad, if you want, I can setup your blog stuff over on my site. You can use iframes to display the blog on your domain. It has a very nice admin panel and all that. Let me know.

       Yes, I'm still a proud owner of Satriani's full anthology, including "Strange Beautiful Music", as well as a couple of other virtuoso guitarists. Check out Vinnie Moore, Eric Johnson, check out Steve Vai, you might like it, there is also  "Liquid tension experiment" if i'm not mistaken, it's an album written by some of the best guitarist from various bands, so it might be cool. Al Di Meola is nice too. there is a load of this kind of music anyhow.

       Hey, for all of you physics lovers: Isaac Newton, traditionaly viewed as the pillar of the age of Reason acually had profound metaphysical inclinations.  In fact, his discoveries were born not of simple scientific curiosity, but a desire to unravel the mysteries of God's creation and God's Will. He spent over 50 years trying to decode the bible using elaborate time charts and even predicted the end of the world for the year 2060. So we still have about 57 years left :) . . . . . I say, that apple hit him pretty hard.    for more details: www.newton-project.ic.ac.uk

       Well, my friends. Watch this.  I have thought A LOT about my miserable situation. I have spoken to people from different domains of study and of different opinions. For now, I have come to the conclusion that it can't go on like this anymore. I feel like sharing this with you. The only person who knows about it right now is Audrey...  Tomorrow I will fill out the online applicaion form to Management Information Systems Co-op at Concordia University. Yes. You heard it right.   I looked at their curriculum, and let me tell you, that's just what I want. Electrical Engineering here at McGill is an excellent program, but I'm clearly not made for it. I don't want to stare at BJT's and FET's and God knows what else for another semester, let alone the remainder of my lifetime. I need change. McGill has been very helpful in discovering what I really want in most popular mathematical method: proof by contradiction.  All of the above notwithstanding, it is not the time for the applause yet. Since I'm a little past the application deadline, I'm not sure if they'll consider me. It's a "competitive" program you know. What do I know about "competitiveness".. Damn, I feel old and weary. Thanks to all for support.

       Hristos voskres!  Or Happy Easter orthodox blog population.   It seems to be quite quiet here... One post per day... Anyway, I'll do as usual little news broad cast about my recent pass times.   Last week got back to school, (which is not the same as back to study, :( , I can't concentrate on exam preparation ) . Nothing special happened through the entire week; just having a smooth relationship with my girlfriend ( a flash back: we're together since november and had time to break up 6 times, :), amusing). This week end worked, bought colored eggs and an easter russian bread. Also went to church on Sartuday night for the entire night for the mess. Sunday spent my day fooling around in the streets of Paris with a friend of mine; in the afternoon went to an Easter celebration to an Estonian girl's appartment; met russian speaking people, including an African russian speaking girl working at the Military-police division of national security - run away... (just kidding). It was a sympathic afternoon with 'pirojki', wine, egg hittings, dansing laughing talking, flurting and listening to various music.   In the evening watched some TV, ate, experienced my girlfriend coming over, then after her leaving - slept, 7 hours. It's the maximun of time I have for sleeping since mid march. :((. Often it is more like 5-6 hours per night. I'm not complaning, just feel like sharing that I may be changing ... my habbits. Now, I'm supposedly working, but taking a break.   So my leds and gents, I also think that I'm loosing my english (now I need to do spell check for many words while typing something this long of blog. A pity). Yet, since I'm not sure how often people read this page, then I guess it's not a big of an embarassement.   Alrighty, take care you all, and  Bon Courage !   Yours,

Even though finals didn't go smoothly, i.e. I can already see my GPA dramatically decrease with an accelerating speed, I am saying this with all the pride: SCHOOL IS OVER!!!. Once everyone's finished, I am buying a nice and sexy looking bottle of Moskovskaia, so we can all enjoy the orgasm of having her (let's have a party that is...) So don't be jealous, study hard, and good luck my children. Amen!

I really like the way it's going. What pleases my intellectual aesthetism *  the most is the fact that we are now observing a drastic jump in semantic richesse of the posts.   Let's keep up the tradition. It won't be too long untill we will all disperse in different directions. With due persistence and participation, this blog has a chance to become something unique.    * this word is under copyright. vladster.com, 2003.

Anyway, let's talk about good things..:) Within last week I visited Verdun (by Bar le Duc and the battle fields of the 1st world war, impressive, sad and astonishing... wow). Then I went to Francfort for a two days. Looks like Montreal a lot. People are nice, speak German and English, and in other views very sympathic city. Then it was Geneva... and the Cirque du Soleil. I'll tell about it later cause I gotta run. Now I'm in Annecy and returning to Paris tomorrow afternoon.   Cheers!!!!!!!!!! everybody! :*

Oh, I just remembered something that can be very motivating for finals. Once upon a time, the most amazing teacher I ever had, aka Krishan Bhatia, said: "You can't pass my friens, you can only improve your failing grade..." So keep it in mind!

        I feel so much relieved now.   I feel like byuing a ninja sword and slaughtering you and anyone else who is also  done with their finals .  The thought is funny actually. If someone quickly and acurately chops youe head off, you will see your own body going down in convulsions on your head's way to the gound. I find that kind of fascinating and something one has to see before he is dead.   Well, now you know how good  I  feel.

       Well, I'm reading this book instead of properly wasting my time solving circuits. And, let me tell you, I'm learning a hell of a lot from the ideas of a Polish guy named Korzybski. Roma, you might have heard of this man when you read stuff on neurolinguistics.   The book is called "Language, Meaning and Maturity". Despite the obnoxious title, it offers a diversified compilation of works on General Semantics (not to be confused with Semantics). I found this book discarded outside the Dawson College library, and I suddenly see the problem with the society throwing away such books, if you forgive me my elitist whining. Here's a quotation. Ladies and gents, please be so kind as to let me know what you think about it. This blog craves for a worthwhile argument.  ... Our sanity is connected with correct symbolism. And naturally, with the increase of sanity, our "moral" and "ethical" standards would rise. It seems useless to preach metaphysical "ethics" and "morals" if we have no standards for sanity. A fundamentally  un sound person cannot, in spite of any amount of preaching, be either "moral" or "ethical." (...) The abuse of symbolism is like the abuse of food and drink; it makes peope ill, and so their reactions become deranged.  Alfred Korzybski.

I came back yesterday and will be here for a week.   Oh, yes, I'm meeting my sister today at 1:00 pm in the Second Cup, the one on McGill College street right near the McGill gate. So if you can make it there from 13:00 to 14:00 it would be very cool.   Or call me at home.  Cheers! See you soon!  By the way, open your eyes Vlad, who is the looser? I didn't come here to have a fight with you. And I'm serious about celebrating.

       Well, life has been pretty hectic here in the Greater Toronto Area. Job search, interviews, more job search, more interviews etc. So far I have found nothing that would take my fancy. Ahem. I guess that means nothing at all. But (for once in my life) I am not giving up! Audrey is fine, but she has her own account here, so she can write for herself.  I drove a Ford Explorer to the mall the other day, and let me tell ya: I understand the SUV owners now. The size does matter indeed.   Coming back to Montreal is in the planning. Maybe two weeks from now.   The car is doing good. I am almost in love with it. It seems that it works on air. I have only filled it once after arriving here, and the fuel indicator has hardly moved ever since.  That's all the news that anyone would care about... I'll write more as the desperation progresses.

       Hello all! Viv, how can salsa caliente not be alive. Yes I am alive and enlyoing it all the way. It is great to see that there is still some action here. Let's keep this blogger thing a place of constant communication, like a hot news line... For example, reporting from Toronto this afternoon, the weather conditions seem quite favourable, whereas in Paris rain is dominant...like whatever. Oh Viv, it's really cool that you went to see Dralion, I'm going too. I have made some impossible plans for this summer like going to California and to Paris with a two week interval between the two trips. Today I'll go find out for the tickets and stuff, but it's not like I have money to pay them yet...what's new? So how are you people doing? Let's give each other news.

Andrei, glad to hear you had a great b-day.  Are you sure it was only ONE bottle of champagne..^_-?  Vlad, Audrey, I had NO idea you were leaving for Toronto so soon!  I guess our karaoke night will have to wait - unless you plan on coming back for a weekend here and there.  Things are good at the lab so far - haven't blown anything up, caused any major hazourdous waste spills or environmental disasters - yet...They don't call me Pyro-Viv for nothing...^_-  Went to see Dralion (Cirque du Soleil) the other night.  Absolutely amazing!  If any of you can get tickets, it's a definite must see.  Right, so that's about it from my neck of the woods - my German class does not bear mentioning.  Audrey, you would be sooooo ashamed...Ich bin ein dummkopf... I'm sure Andrei would get great pleasure out of that statement if he had any idea what it meant.^_-  Take care all,

The only things that were missing are the actual Russian people (except for me and my sis), drunk people, songs, candles on my b-cake (how could I forget to buy some??)   So now I'm 21, and I think that it's the time to stop counting age (woooooooo-uuuuuuuu! some one could say) Well, that's how I feel. (it doesn't imply that I feel old). As gifts I got  cloth, a bottle of good champaign, money, a book, and wird rules of playing chess... Alright.   Later.

       Thanks Fais. What interests me more, however, is the first question. How does the body know where the outer contour should be? Let's say there is an big openning in the skin, it will be reconstructed and levelled off with the rest of the body. How does the body know where to stop regenerating the tissue so it doesn't bypass the surrounding area? Is there some kind of comparison going on? The reason I'm asking is that I don't think DNA would contain that information. When the person gets fat, the DNA doesn't change, but the reconstruction of the skin will still undergo up to the level of surrounding skin.. Anyway, that's my lay Sunday-afternoon thoughts. Does it show the school is over for me? :)  How about tuesday night?   It's eldorado[at]vladster.com. Roma, I'll put your pic up soon.

       hello all. All exams are over about half a week ago so yes!! life is good! so vlad , ur question, well this is how it works or to the best of my knowledge. When  u have damage on skin,such as big opening, it does amaze to see how come the body reconstructs that gap but can not reconstruct an amputed arm. It does seem logical that it should be able to do so, seeing that the only difference are the size of the wounds and the amount of reconstruction required. Well the thing is , the body works in different methods for different harms to the body. When there is cut on skin, a primal response is sent by body to send its defense around the wound to capture and destroy foreign elements. That is doable because the blood routes are still intact to the injury site, allowing also the proteins that reconstruct the epidermis (skin) to do their job right after coagulation has completed. Under that cut, other elements such as nerve cells, major blood routes and others(muscles fibers etc) are intact. Therefore, the body is able to asses the damage and heal the wound. When an arm is cut off, the nerve cells and blood vessels that were in arm are no longer connected to grand central (body and brain). Humans are unable to regenerate nerve cells, unlike the lizard and the goldfish for example. Why not? Our DNA aint programmed to do so! We lose nerve cells, ciao bye! cant get em back. That is why neurodegenerative diseases are permanent and are uncurable (parkison's, alzeihmers, etc..) The only hope lies in getting cells that by "training" can turn into new nerve cells which is stem cell research. Stem cells have to the ability to become any cell in the body.   ok so thats it, guys u think i left something out or said someting wong wong, weally wong, tell me plz.  vlad vat do you say we all had a get together and all somewhere.

       A have a question for the biologically-knowledgeable community here: Viv, Fais, Mulanda...   Suppose I have a not-so-severe external physical damage to my skin. The organism will (I'll speak in lay terms for the fear of being misunderstood) heal the wound. How does it know where to stop regenerating the tissue? Does DNA contain information about the allowable "external bounds" of my body? Why then does the body not regenerate extremities? I am sort of confused on the whole regeneration process. Is the mechanism known?

       Roma, I suggest you stay. If your desperation is based solely on the current state of the industry, and NOT on your likes and dislikes, I strongly suggest you stick with engineering. You know how it is... just when you think of resigning yourself to hopelessness, the light in the end of the tunnel appears. If you really don't see yourself in the field, get the fuck out of there before you go insane. Investment banking will always be a safe bet. It's like Dentistry, I guess.

       Engineering was a bad-bad choice. Only 3 persons (not percent) found co-op jobs out of 2nd year students. All of them have near perfect GPA.  This sounds like a signal to drop out and go do something more useful, fuck, should've gone into Finance.  I'm thinking of working full-time next year at some stupid job, getting CFA level 1, and fucking switching into Finance or Commerce. Fuck this bullshit, engineering is in a lot of trouble.

       Yes, I have read Genesis two or three times in different versions, but, of course, I skipped some paragraphs that seem boring, like most of us. Besides, most popular publishings of the Bible represent shorter translated versions of the original, and that's probably the cause of the misinterpretation by many people of what's written there. It says, it was "DARK". Doesn't dark mean just the absence of light? Many don't think so, and it's the first deviation of the original sense. Also it says, there was water with living there creatues; doesn't this imply that there was a planet Earth with life on it before the creation. Moreover, I believe, it says, that the time of creation of Adam and Eve was not the first time God created life.  Of course, I'm not saing that Mr. Asimov wrote the article on the spot. But as you mentioned before, he wrote it for dumb americans: he had to adopt.

       I'm not quite sure of what you're saying Andrei. Isaac Asimov does have a point. He tells creationists to go fuck themselves. That article is very nicely written.  And, mind you, I am all for critical thinking and all, but did you just say that  Isaac Asimov  "has some misunderstandings"? Are you saying  Isaac Asimov  just got up one morning and decided to publish an article about Creationism without first reading the Bible?   urlLink Genesis  (which you clearly haven't read) DOES contradict the thery of evolution. No debate necessary here. According to Genesis (in short), it was dark, then the Big Daddy came and said: "Computer: LIGHT!". Then he created the Man, Woman, wild and livestock (!) animals. All that happened within six days roughly 6000 years ago. Do you find that in perfect agreement with evolution?  Anyway, I hope I haven't hurt anyone's religious feelings. I have deep respect for any religion as a cultural component -- NOT as an actual theory of how things came into being.

       By the way Vlad, I've read the article on Scientific creationists and forgot what I wanted to say because the internet got disconnected for about 4 hours and I was busy doing other things. Anyhow, it was pretty boring to read with practicaly nothing new in it. I don't know what was the point of the author, it probably was meant for either scientists who permenantly regect any thought of creationnist in regards to their interests. Or maybe, the will to be extremely politically correct of the author made the article loose the opinion and idea behind it as well as all it's debatable value.  What do you think?   Also, it's quite clear that the author has some misunderstandings upon what's written in the Bible about the creation, because it does not contradict any theory of evolution and any age limit to the creation of Universe, the Earth and the animals. Moreover, it simply does not give any pertinent information about what was there/here before God created Adam and Eve. So I don't think that there should be any debate at all between the evolutionists and creationnists, since they are talking about intrinsicly (!) different time scales of things and things at all. :)

       O"K"-- it is actually the time for me to write something here, first of all because i don't write a lot , second of all school is over, third of all summer is coming. Well , starting slowly, school was really hard , or maybe i worked a bit more , lot's of surprises during this year and many other that only the enlightened people should know. Well , now that finally it's all gone there is a funny emptyness inside. I'm really  looking forward for this summer , and definetely if i gather enough money i;ll go somewhere at the end. Then, someone brought me a funny surprize  by the end of the semester not saying who.......,Bliad(Pardon mademoiselles), by switching to Concordia.But i guess this is life , and i wish him good luck. Then the very anticipating return of the mighty Dronovitch is awaited in Montreal area around august and i'm happy hes going to be there at least with me. Now only for Dron:) : Nu ti psdes liad pisatelem stal , ia ag ohuel, bliad tebia tam v parige kakimi batonami kormiat chto bi ti tak pisat stal, romantica tut bliad , smooth relationships pisdes, ia smotru ti pisdes stal ni kak ranche , na kampuse kagduiu vtoroiu hotel, i begal i krishal chto u tebia s nei uge est kontack.  Just for the Dron:FOOLing around in the streets of paris with a friend of mine , nu ti tut bliad voobche zagnul , vi tam cho bliad vdvoem za svoi batonneti degites v beretikah , vino buhaete  i blia pro romantism govorite , nu vi pisdes , v montreal tebia nado, in the hood sdat,:),. A potom u tebia eshe i SYMPATIC AFTERNOON s EGG HITTINGs, ti komu tam bliad iaca razbil, o mog u tebia uge potekli,nu vi LIAGUshki franzuzkie pisdes , iaiz russkih obagralis. Potom bliad pishet , nu pisatel, bliaad , ia pomiraiu so smehuAHHHHAAAAAAA, :In the evening watched some TV, ate, experienced my girlfriend coming over, then after her leaving"-ti bliad pisdes , ti cho zabil kak ti ranche govoril , bliaaaa ebatsia budu(pardon mademoiselles), tak tak bi i skazal nu protolknulis i  ia ee nahui poslal, a tut bliad Viktor Hugo stal, tebe cho blia vino v boshku vdarilo, buhat havtit. a potom , tut ia voobshe so stula upal, on eshe BON COURAGE, nu ti tut voobshe pereebral ladno franzuzik , priedesh mi tut tebe mozgi vpravlem  oii , ustal ia Ok, the happy that Andrey is coming back and we all going to have an absofuckinglutely a crazy summer.

       You guys are all lucky. I'm stuck doing summer courses... and I've planned to take 4 of them across 2 sessions... call me crazy.  So now for this month, I have to learn the wonders of Greek mythology and write a paper on how the taxi market in developing countries can survive without regulation.  Next month it's "Medicine in the modern society" and "World War I"  On top of which, I have to do work and move out on the 18th 0.o  The joy of life.

       but it sucks that I don't have the "settings" and "template" buttons like vlad does.. :( That's not fair, I can't even check who're the members of THE team.  I also don't like the 'preview post' thing. feels like I'm wasting my time, I'm still not going to change anything in my post, so why preview? It feels like they're thinking that I'm stupid or something and that I ablosutly need to see what I'm going to make public in a second and ensure that it is the POST I  REALLY  want people to see. Fewh! That's like important shit, man!  Cheers!

       Alright.   I'm free. Nothing else depends on me now, maybe just a possible arrangment (after a scandal and a long explanation) for one of my results but I hope it doesn't get to that point. We'll see in 2 days. So final standing can't be yet announced, but here's a provisionary one for this semester:  5 exams = 7 courses for McGill.  Passed 3.5 exams = 5 courses, one failed, and one will know this week. Total 3.5/4, or for McGill validated 5. (Plus 80% of my nervous system almost scraped and probably 5% of neuros will not recover. Shit! It's a lot for a life time!!)   Now I feel like getting out of an aquarium at last being able to breath. This school year was long and tiering. My exam period lasted for 24 days with 5 written tests and 3 orals. I'm still shaking. Oh well. Now it's time to work and have fun.   I've got 2 jobs now (the data entry thing and the hotel) and looking for ways of making my filming ideas earning money experience as well (hopefully full time). Girls were on the fifth place of priority for me during last month and a half, and now are getting to third position (after filming and getting back in moral and phisical shape). Maybe, however, I'll get involved in some threesomes to relax a bit, since I have got friends at the student lesbian association. No, there are no guys and it is not possible, so don't make any jokes upon the subject.   Oh, yes! I went to  salon de Bourget , I'll send you the link to photos. There are some pics Vlad would really enjoy.  Finally, I got to go. I don't know what exactly I want to do now, but probably will clean my room from the mess the exams left, then will say hi to a new cute female comer in our building, have dinner with a group of friends and sort of, and then working in the hotel's restaurent untill 2 at night (the latest I hope).  Take care and lets try to keep in touch.  Cheers!

       Interesting quotation. Here's a recursively wrong statement for you:   All generalizations are wrong.    I hope you see the irony. By the way, that Clarke dude would probably bar Sakharov, Bohr and most of the Nobel Prize winners from their labs.  Alright.  Andrei, have you ever thought about the source of one curious quality of your unique charachter, namely, the strong  urge for controversy ? I find it very interesting. Do you know where it comes from? If I were you (oh Christ), I would try to explore the origin of that feeling.   If you learn to control it (as opposed to being controlled by it), among other things, it could help you become a decent journalist...

          Arthur Clarke's First Law:  "When a distinguished but elderly scientist states that something is possible he is almost certainly right. When he states that something is impossible, he is very probably wrong."  Clarke defines the adjective 'elderly' as :"In physics, mathematics and astronautics it means over thirty; in other disciplines, senile decay is sometimes postponed to the forties. There are of course, glorious exceptions; but as every researcher just out of college knows, scientists of over fifty are good for nothing but board meetings, and should at all costs be kept out of the laboratory". (in Profiles of the Future.)

       Passed 1  4 to be anounced.   Man, you don't know how bad I want to express myself just because I feel like it and I can't just because. Besides, I probably don't know how to express my self really badly. Isn't it sad? So now FUCK OFF and don't answer that question! Well, now I feel lower in my self respect.   I find that swearing and insulting people makes brings the person doing that to a lower level of moral ranking then he was initially.  Stange, why don't all people think this way?...

       Why can't the guy making this offer take on the responsibility and do it him self? Of cource there are many logical answers, but I say: "he is just a lazy prick!!" Why do I think that it is 'He'? Because 'she' won't be able to do it anyway!   Sorry, maybe it's just because I failed my fist exam. Yet, it doesn't mean I failed the course. I need to get 18/20 for my math oral and I will pass on the dot. Damn. Wish me luck, and let God be with me. Amen.   P.S. 3 more exams to go.... + that one oral.

       Montreal people?! Who's that anyway?   And Viv,"Ich studieren deutsch mit Audrey, aber ich vergessen fast alles." Yet, I still remember what 'dummkopf' means :).   Besides that, did my first exam today; It's always hard to break the ice without breaking the neck. Well, I'll see how it comes out. Also planning my summer and my trip in Europe. Alsmost last call for those who do want to visit me, and moreover, travel the Europe with me.   For today my plan is: work June and July non stop, earn 1000euro extra to what I need. Meanwhile film short movies and funny subjects with a group of people (still to find). 1st of August leave Paris for Bruxelles- Amsterdam- Berlin- Prague- Vienne. (Or the other way around, + some other sity(s) may pop up. Originally Milan and Rome were included, but lack of fininces and time made me change my mind.) Then back to Paris (or Lyon), and Montreal on august the 12th (or 15th).  But before all that, I still have 4 more exams to go, and an extra job to find. (Maybe I'll end up working close to double full-time for a two weeks or so. :) ).

I think it's time you head back home before someone finds you beaten to a pulp in a seedy Parisian alley...Dammit!  You NEVER listen!  Faisal, glad to hear that all is well - remember that bottled water is your friend (as are malaria pills, bloody noxious things...).  Audrey, Vlad, the two of you just snuck in and snuck out of town...hmmmmm...makes a person wonder...Salsa, what are you up to?  Wajdi - did they finally straighten up all that chaos with co-op?  Anyway, must go back to the all-important job of lazing around my living room...^_- et on se parlera bientot, j'esp�re...(yes I know i'm missing an accent...stupid keyboard)

       Hello all from the Bangladesh, country situated right next to INdia, very tiny in size but dense in population. Got hold of an interent terminal and thawing the chunks of junks from the email. So so far, I have been to couple of hospitals and clinics and the things I can tell you and the experiences I have had are enormous , and its been only a week. I could do it right here, but I would be inflicting on people who are not interested, so I think a face to face convo would be better when I return to Mtl. And... I'm paying for the internet connection by the minute. So...bye for now.  Oh..and eat and chew your food with more delight than usual, I certainly have learned to do so.   longing to see you all in 4 and half weeks, specially ,viv :) (...sorry couldnt meet before me left..ill make it up )

       Yo! We did come to Mtl last weekend, but I have experienced some technical difficulties with my clutch. It turned out, the clutch cylinder liquid ran out, so I spent most of the weekend trying to get rid of the air in the system. Anyway, how are things? Andrei, I couldn't read your email. If you can send it in .doc format, that would be great. I can't wait. So why are you, being such a patriot, studying abroad? Are Russian Universities not good enough for you? Oh, I see, you don't want to go to the army. Whatever happened to a man's duty to defend his country... :)  Here's some stuff about honesty, commitment to selecting real talent etc. in Russia's elite med schools: http://fakel.org/art.php?id=31&art_id=535

       Finally some people are back on the web :).   Ok, a funny story. I'm registered at some russian dating websites as a hot rich russian guy living either in States, France or Canada (on the picture we see a muscular blond around 25-28 years of age surfing). Consequently, I get lots of emails of ladyes wanting to meet me. For example:   ������ �������, ��� � �� �� �������, � � ������, �� � ���������� � ����������� ���� ������� � ����������. ��� �� ����� ��������. ���� ����� ����������, ���� �� ��� ��������, � ����� � �� ������ � ����........   Basically she is asking for help learning french, and maybe  other help   as well... My answer was a patriotic style angry letter upon people in Russia. Well, she never wrote me back...  Next young lady from Ukrane send me was very polite with me and sent me a dozzen of her photos, with a description of how smart she is, how nice and educated she is and that she is also a good house keeper, a cook and probably a good mother in the future, and that she is coming soon to Paris, where  I could meet her.  Well, I proposed right away. She still didn't answer and probably won't :).   Other emails were not as interesting but I'm hoping for other funny onces. :)  Yours,

       Hey, guys! Andrei, what the hell is this?!!!!  I'm not even sure I want to know. I find that as time goes by, I'm getting more and more concerned about your sanity...Vlad, that was a lovely evening.  I'm sorry I was so late - I don't think I've ever been QUITE that late for anything before...shut up, Andrei. ^_-  Audrey, quand est-ce qu'on se revera?  When are you two coming back to Mtl?  Faisal, how go your plans for Bangladesh?  I went on a massive baking spree today.  Don't quite know what came over me.  Before I knew it, I had whipped up two batches of banana muffins, a loaf of raisin bread and a double batch of brownies...geez...I'm going to main-lining insulin at the rate I'm going...^_-  Anyway, must get back to my cookbook - no, I'm not baking anything else!  Have you taken leave of your senses?!  I'm compiling some recipes for a friend of mine for her birthday.  Right, that's about it for now.  Cu�dense, all of you!

       Evgueny, sorry I didn't get back to u about the movie/Piano Bar business...I was supposed to meet up with some friends of mine who are back from Oman, India, etc. but that didn't work out...ended up staying home camped out in flannel pjs agonizing about grad school...we're still on for tomorrow, right?

       The night we saw "Le Declin de l'Empire..." was truly memorable. Let us see each other more often before we are off to tend to our lawn. Alors c'est tout pour maintenant, a la prochaine !  (thick andreish wannabe french accent)

       alright. Fais what's your nember?  Vlad are you serious? If yes r u coming with Audrey?   There has been a proposition made: somewhere in the nature..? I'm absolutely up for it. Moreover, how about going fishing? Don't laugh, I mean it. I know some very nice places where we can fish and have a picknic. We would need cars. Fais, do you drive? I have a car but no liscence.  Anyhow, what do you say? I'll be calling all of the people tomorrow.   Take care,

</post>

<date>23,August,2003</date>
<post>

    
       the way to get there is to get to metro Verdun, then either call 763-2649, either walk down the Verdun street in the ouest direction for 10min and turn left at the street called woodland (right on the coner there is a gas station the one with a canadian maple leaf) and search for number 279 on that Woodland street.

       So will I - probably will be a few hours late ^_- (not because I forgot the time, but because I have family over and I don't know when I'll be able to get away...shut up, Vlad - I'd stick my tongue out at you, but the effort would be wasted, seeing as you're not here to witness it).  It would also help if I knew how the hell to get there - 'Verdun' is a bit too general for me - it's like telling someone you live in Toronto (granted, it's not as big, but the opportunities to get lost in the dark are just as many).

Hope I won't get arrested while transporting marijuana, and if not, ones of you who'll recognise me the fist day will get a real-life joint!! :))  Peace and luv!  Truly yours,

       yo! how ya all doin'...it's been a looooooooong time. well life is great though somewhat borring, regardless of few things that make the summer special. let's see, the  coolest one so far was dancing in a movie. there is a movie being shot in montreal with leonardo dicaprio...pays so well to do that. feel like a big movie star. andrei, we could probably figure out something fun when you're back, like going up north or to toronto (everyone is welcome to join). oh and guess who i ran into two times like almost in a row...californiachick. sarah if you still read this, what do you do at honore beaugrand so often? ok dudes let's keep in touch and stuff...catch ya later

       Man!!  I just erased all that I have wrote, by an accident!!!!!!!!! I'm such a sloppy ass!! Anyway.  VLAD, ARE YOU, LIKE,  SERIOUS  ?? Abouts the T.O. thing??? AUDREY!!! HELLO!! Can you give at least one comment on what's going on, PLZZZZ?   DUDES, are we all drifting away or something?? Or is the world simply becoming a smaller place??? HEY-O! Jek, Viv, Fais, Dor, Waj, Rom, Dan and others (if there are) on this blog, do you also have Napoleon's or Colombus plans for living your life?    Anyhow, I just hope to see you all soon and together as a bunch of having fun people.   About me, well, in Paris it's 40�C during the day and 39�C during the night. (thank god I'm not there). For my trip to Holland and belgum I've spen 300 euros or so. That really, really sucks because I planned my budget for the latter around 100/150 euros. Now I still owe 100euros to my sis, and since my big plan was to go to Corsica, there will fly away 100euros more. But I sound to hipocrit counting about the money!! I should count how much fun I had!! But, knowing that in Amsterdam I've had a huge fight with my g-f, (despite all my love and respect for her, I think her hobby is to be unnoying, which pisses me off a lot). Too bad she couldn't come to Corsica with us (my sis, her fianc�, and me), and I still hope to see her in Paris before I leave. Anyway, a sad story; now I'm suppose to be a good boy untill my second trip to Europe to see her in winter.   All right, see you all soon!! And PLZZ, be in MTL when I come back!!!    Cheers!!

       THE MIDTERMS ARE COMING, THE MIDTERMS ARE COMING!!!   Hate to say this, but I guess the studious hastle is on the horizon and is approaching with the speed of sound.  (i.e. we can see it, but we still can't hear it. And we'll hear it only when it gets here, or as a resonnance when it will already pass, but that's BAD!!!)  Shit! I aready had a one mid-term and many projects are due soon. I know that some people here are not is the same "stress boad" as most of us, but I'm sure that their time will come sooner or later :), and they'll feel again that dull inquetude before the test and the emplyness right after... So DON'T get too excited now! We're all still chained to one board, and the board is nailed to one wall, and the wall is a part of the same house, and the house is still being build!!   Truly yours,

       Casablanca was good :). But I'm not sure if I would have fallen asleep if I've watched it on a small screen all alone.  Besides that the evening was fun, too bad noone else could make it.  Evgueni, I'm sorry for calling you during your course, I somehow thought it was finished.

       Hehe, I found a Russian translation of Byron's poem. I find it not quite the same, and a bit poorer. But judge for your self :)    &#1054;&#1085;&#1072; &#1080;&#1076;&#1077;&#1090; &#1074;&#1086; &#1074;&#1089;&#1077;&#1081; &#1082;&#1088;&#1072;&#1089;&#1077; -                         &#1057;&#1074;&#1077;&#1090;&#1083;&#1072;, &#1082;&#1072;&#1082; &#1085;&#1086;&#1095;&#1100; &#1077;&#1077; &#1089;&#1090;&#1088;&#1072;&#1085;&#1099;.                         &#1042;&#1089;&#1103; &#1075;&#1083;&#1091;&#1073;&#1100; &#1085;&#1077;&#1073;&#1077;&#1089; &#1080; &#1079;&#1074;&#1077;&#1079;&#1076;&#1099; &#1074;&#1089;&#1077;                         &#1042; &#1077;&#1077; &#1086;&#1095;&#1072;&#1093; &#1079;&#1072;&#1082;&#1083;&#1102;&#1095;&#1077;&#1085;&#1099;,                          &#1050;&#1072;&#1082; &#1089;&#1086;&#1083;&#1085;&#1094;&#1077; &#1074; &#1091;&#1090;&#1088;&#1077;&#1085;&#1085;&#1077;&#1081; &#1088;&#1086;&#1089;&#1077;,                         &#1053;&#1086; &#1090;&#1086;&#1083;&#1100;&#1082;&#1086; &#1084;&#1088;&#1072;&#1082;&#1086;&#1084; &#1089;&#1084;&#1103;&#1075;&#1095;&#1077;&#1085;&#1099;.                         &#1055;&#1088;&#1080;&#1073;&#1072;&#1074;&#1080;&#1090;&#1100; &#1083;&#1091;&#1095; &#1080;&#1083;&#1100; &#1090;&#1077;&#1085;&#1100; &#1086;&#1090;&#1085;&#1103;&#1090;&#1100; -                         &#1048; &#1073;&#1091;&#1076;&#1077;&#1090; &#1091;&#1078; &#1089;&#1086;&#1074;&#1089;&#1077;&#1084; &#1085;&#1077; &#1090;&#1072;                          &#1042;&#1086;&#1083;&#1086;&#1089; &#1072;&#1075;&#1072;&#1090;&#1086;&#1074;&#1072;&#1103; &#1087;&#1088;&#1103;&#1076;&#1100;,                         &#1053;&#1077; &#1090;&#1077; &#1075;&#1083;&#1072;&#1079;&#1072;, &#1085;&#1077; &#1090;&#1077; &#1091;&#1089;&#1090;&#1072;                         &#1048; &#1083;&#1086;&#1073;, &#1075;&#1076;&#1077; &#1087;&#1086;&#1084;&#1099;&#1089;&#1083;&#1086;&#1074; &#1087;&#1077;&#1095;&#1072;&#1090;&#1100;                         &#1058;&#1072;&#1082; &#1073;&#1077;&#1079;&#1091;&#1087;&#1088;&#1077;&#1095;&#1085;&#1072;, &#1090;&#1072;&#1082; &#1095;&#1080;&#1089;&#1090;&#1072;.                          &#1040; &#1101;&#1090;&#1086;&#1090; &#1074;&#1079;&#1075;&#1083;&#1103;&#1076;, &#1080; &#1094;&#1074;&#1077;&#1090; &#1083;&#1072;&#1085;&#1080;&#1090;,                         &#1048; &#1083;&#1077;&#1075;&#1082;&#1080;&#1081; &#1089;&#1084;&#1077;&#1093;, &#1082;&#1072;&#1082; &#1074;&#1089;&#1087;&#1083;&#1077;&#1089;&#1082; &#1084;&#1086;&#1088;&#1089;&#1082;&#1086;&#1081;,                         &#1042;&#1089;&#1077; &#1074; &#1085;&#1077;&#1081; &#1086; &#1084;&#1080;&#1088;&#1077; &#1075;&#1086;&#1074;&#1086;&#1088;&#1080;&#1090;.                         &#1054;&#1085;&#1072; &#1074; &#1076;&#1091;&#1096;&#1077; &#1093;&#1088;&#1072;&#1085;&#1080;&#1090; &#1087;&#1086;&#1082;&#1086;&#1081;                          &#1048; &#1077;&#1089;&#1083;&#1080; &#1089;&#1095;&#1072;&#1089;&#1090;&#1100;&#1077; &#1087;&#1086;&#1076;&#1072;&#1088;&#1080;&#1090;,                         &#1058;&#1086; &#1089;&#1072;&#1084;&#1086;&#1081; &#1097;&#1077;&#1076;&#1088;&#1086;&#1102; &#1088;&#1091;&#1082;&#1086;&#1081;!                          12 &#1080;&#1102;&#1085;&#1103; 1814

       That's why poetry is about the content and sharp imaging, especially the English one.   Viv, I still don't get any information email upon events of the Club. But I'll try to make it. Are you going to be there?

       I cannot digest poetry in English.  Nothing underlines it's inherent crudeness and structural poverty better than rhyme.   Just my 2 ESL cents in. vt

        She walks in beauty, like the night   Of cloudless climes and starry skies,  And all that's best of dark and bright  Meets in her aspect and her eyes;  Thus mellow'd to that tender light Which Heaven to gaudy day denies.      One shade the more, one ray the less,  Had half impair'd the nameless grace   Which waves in every raven tress   Or softly lightens o'er her face,   Where thoughts serenely sweet express   How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.      And on that cheek and o'er that brow   So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,   The smiles that win, the tints that glow,   But tell of days in goodness spent ,� A mind at peace with all below,   A heart whose love is innocent.                                  Lord Byron   Man, I was high on this poem for last two weeks now!

        Tygon's yearly midterm description    It is still early in the day and the sun is still shy. A thick foul-smelling fog covers the dark and damp swamp. Not a creature moves and not a plant stirs for in this place, not even the wind dares to dance. The obvious presence of death himself swarms amongst the stream that flows silently throught the river bed. The sweet smell of the morning dew is now a smell of rotten corpses. Flames that have burnt the innocent bodies now sizzle amidst the remaing ashes. What remains of this river of youth is now a bog of bile. The very stench of the smoke brings tears to the eyes for not a single breath of life is whispered let alone present. As the mist slowly passes away, a very light shadow appears in the far distance.  The emerging sun helps clarify this distant object. As the light starts to rapidly illuminate the location, the silhouette of a man appears distinct. He leans against his staff barely able to stand and each time he struggles to keep himself upstraight. Blood is trickling from every one of his junctures as he still fights to remain standing. His arms shake episodically as if they were almost out of strength but this man musters all that is left to remain alive. The clouds soon reappear and slowly hide the sun in a part. Water of the stream slowly recommences its redundant pouring through the ravines and an insect or two is heard whimping around. As the day goes into night, the man's faint murmur resonates through the bushes. He whispers "..its over..." "...its over...". This cyclic tantra continues far into the dark cold night until silence retakes its throne.    ...midterms are done with...i have survived.

       I had this screwed up dream last night.   I am sitting at a desk in Chulich library (McGill) and seriously considering leaving engineering. And then EVGUENI comes up to me and suggests that he and I should write a paper on  ballistics  (?!?!????!) together. He says that he would then use it as a basis for his final-year thesis.  Now what could be more strange than that? Anyone else dreamt of Evgueni last night?

        The approaching battle    Light pierces the lengthy darkness that spoused the night all along. On the horizon, creatures that were dormant are still in slow mobility on their daily morning hunt. There is still a dew hanging from the leaves of trees, as a gentle wind slowly dances along, lifting up and down the fallen leaves of autumn. Very low crunches of footsteps are heard approaching. A man in his youth walks out to the open field. His cleanly waxed armour glitters in the morning sunshine and his freshly cleaved leather boots crunch at every step. He fixes for a moment his gauntlet that was passed on to him throughout his generation. After some quite reflexion he bows on one knee and prays. After he recites the last line, he stands up and and pauses a moment to stare at the stillness that surrounds him. He hears a rumble in the direction opposite to him approaching slowly but surely. He takes in a deep sigh, and remembers all those close to him that will miss him. Valinatly, a subtle smile comes on to his face and quickly disappears. He removes his sword from his shard and raises it high up in defiance as the rumble approaches with demonic speed. As the oncoming juggernaut drifts closer, our hero's fists clench tighter and his heart pounds faster...   Here come the finals, good luck everyone.

       Hello, again! All right, just wanted to let you all know that my dance group will be having a dress rehearsal Thursday night at 9 pm in the Ballroom (3rd floor) of the McGill Student Services Bldg. on McTavish.  They're charging a $2 entrance fee to defray the costs of the trip.  Yes, Evgueny, there will be some salsa. ^_-  No, Andrei, you CANNOT, I repeat, CANNOT traumatise any of my friends - (read: FEMALE friends).  There are a few first years, and I don't want you  scaring them off - particularly not with that routine you pulled at L'Etranger when you got back from France... Audrey, I wish you were here!  hopefully we'll see each other soon...

       it will sign you out automatically after a few minutes. btw, Andrei, would you like a blog? I could build you one for your poetry and stuff... Although I hope that won't prevent you from posting here as well.

       hehe, cool.   The only problem is that it doesn't sign you out when you close the window, so any person after who uses the computer after you will be automatically loged into your accout, once the goes to the blogger site.  Actually, somehow even when I try to sign out on netscape through normal procedure on blogger, it doesn't sign me out, yet, as I turn off the netscape window, it does.

       My last post was:   Blog This!!  All money accepted!! The more the better!!!   Just failed one test.  I copied and copied wrong!! How miserable. I guess I'd have to fuck the TA; she is not good person (about looks), it may give me some bonus marks.   Besides that, here is one of my poems:    Saving Love (Suicide�s Diary)  When certain substances properly mix, Wild explosions burst. When love and unfairness meet in a kiss, Tears see only world�s worst.  But once all dries out, feelings remain Of unconditional you; Yet, stomach butterflies turn into pain As memories sting my heart through  The world is a part, a part from our love Observed through the lens of our eyes; And quitting this show leaving costumes behind  Will make those butterflies fly.  So put some powder on your lips, I�ll light a fire on mine. Deadly explosion bursts as they mix When in a kiss we unite.  Andrei Moskvitch (Copyright: October 2003)

       B-ha-ha-ha!! I AM in the library now... studing... duhh!! No prose, nor poetry will be posted on my behalf regarding the suffering period of exam preparation.   And tomorrow it's time to for school at 8:00am!! Project shit to costruct, duhh!! I'm doing just fine, if you aks me. No stress, I'm just annoyed with the program: nothing breathtaking.   I sometimes think: if " one born to crawl, will never fly " does it imply that " one born to fly, can learn to crawl "??? And if so, what kind of idiot, who was meant to fly would spend his time learining to crawl? And if he crawls finally, does it mean that he'll never fly due to his mediocricy, or because he has wasted his time and wings atrophied?   Shit!!   :) (but should be actually sad)

       Hello, hello ladies and gents. I here am dropping by to reassure you all of my existence and well-being.    Viv, Andrei, Jeka: my brother and I sincerely enjoyed your company on Sunday. To everyone else, I eagerly await your pre-finals poetry and prose; end-of year school/love life and other masturbation achievements and ramblings. You may wish to send your masterpieces to me in private, and I will post them anonymously on this page. I am still  El Dorado at vladster dot com .  Yours very truly

       Alright, spanish pple. It's good to see everyone posting again. I guess I'll see some of you soon.   Vlad, Audrey, are you planning to come to Mtl. any time soon? Yes? Maybe? Come on! We need to get together before the final examination period.   Also, we've been talking about a new year's party, or a ski trip... Maybe it's time to start planning? I checked that most of the country houses are already booked the the time of the holidays, but there are still some left.    Later!

By the way, I thought that the check ups with cute genecologist(e)s are usually in private offices :P   Cheers dude!! And cheer up!!   P.S. Does anyone have any " juicy stories " to convey?

       Well, I survived my evil GRE...so glad that's over with.  Thought you'd like to know that I'm competing in an Indian dance competition at the Ottawa Civic Centre on the 29th of November.  Audrey knows what I'm talking about... ^_-  McGill has won this event two years in a row and we're hoping to make it a third.  So, if any of you are interested, the website of the show is www.savari.com.  There are video clips and photos of last year's acts.  Hope midterms haven't treated you too badly...

The topic for this assignement was to "write a significant personal essay on your views about technology, its relation to you, your career, your society. Speak in a personal voice about your own relationship to technology. Give examples and tell stories from your own life experience."   It is what I did in the essay entitled "I - Engineer".   ...  I thank you very much for understanding.   Sincerely,

        Later on, after this glorious victory (and maybe others similar to this one) our hero became the beast himself, and new men went out to challenge him.

        Endgame   ...so he may rest for a while.   [...a Week ago...]     The sun was merciless and the winds still, as the day continued on. Our hero had been tirelessly fighting with every breath that his lungs could draw in, however, the adversaries he faced were far smaller than he had expected. Nevertheless, he continued to shed blood, carefully noting that not one scar would appear by mistake. He would have to conserve his strength for an opponent of titanic state. Dusk soon turned to dawn, and our hero managed to catch but a few moments of shut-eye, when suddenly he was awaken by the clitters and ticks of little vermins. He knew that what he had expected and was waiting was now at his doorstep.   As he continued fighting the minions, the earth trembled at faster episodes as the monster approached closer. Our hero could smell the stench of vile acid as the ground got warmer...  And there it was, standing before our hero, high up in the sky, as it was using the sky as its ceiling. Our hero stared up, at the ghastly apparition of the devil.   "so this is the end, that everyone was warning me about", thought our hero. Suddenly in a flash of a moment, all the memories of home appeared. He saw himself as a young boy innocently playing around ignorant of the problems he was about to face. He remembered all the friends that he had been with. He asked himself whether he would ever see them ever again. As the roar of the devil grew louder and the impending doom even more imminent, our hero decided to challenge this beast. And so the fight began.  There was lighting and clashing of blades and flesh. The spectacle was blinding, for the location was filled with smoke and an outsider would not have deciphered the state of the fight. There were shouts and cries and roars and taunts, but the status of our hero or the beast were unknown. There was too much darkness and too much light. There was too much noise and too much silence. Chaos was everywhere, the creatures of the forest had gone into seclusion for a even a passerby risked his life. The sky went dark and lightning struck as fires erupted all over amidst the ongiong fight. All this time, smokes covered the location of the two fighters. Suddenly a giant roar gasped out of the monster's lungs as our hero bellowed a yawp of pain....   The smoke cleared slowly and our hero was found leaning on the monster's chest, his head slightly bent and his hand tightly gripped and still shaking around his sword as the blade was sunk deep into the chest of the beast. Our hero drew in more breath , lifted back up the sword and dropped it back into the body for the final kill.  Our hero made his way to the river and slumped down near the bank, as the water washed away the blood from his leather bootcuffs. His breathing turned to  smaller intervals, as he drew into a gentle sleep. At that moment, something happened. The forest grew silent. Birds stopped chirping and the little creatures stopped moving and the wind stopped blowing. The trees stopped moving and the leaves stopped falling. It was as if the entire forest had acknowledged the acheivement of our hero and had decided to become silent ...so he may rest for a while

       Yaayyyyy!!!!!!!!  No more exams!!!!!  Don't mind me - slightly ecstatic about this whole 'no studying' thing...  All right, slight change of plan, my family is NOT heading down to TO (at least, I don't think we are, unless my parents change their mind at the last possible second, which is rather unlikely).  As for New Year's, that's still up in the air, seeing as two of my closest friends are heading out to Las Vegas...  Anyway, hopefully we'll all manage to get together somehow this break.  Take care guys and DRIVE SAFELY.

       My exam period is over. Wow, it doesn't even sound as big anymore.   Just now I was sitting in a test; I finished everything except for one problem and one bonus question. I still had something like an hour to go. I got so lazy, it's not funny. To start of, I wasn't even stressed for the test; I studied for aprox. 10-12 hours for it two days before, making sure I got my beauty sleep (and considering that this was  suppose  to be my hardest class this semester).   I was way more stressed for the so-called 'easier' classes, I studied for them like creazy and felt exausted when those tests were over.   Nonetheless, never I felt that I have acomplished something after I wrote those exams. It sucks in a way.  Just for stats, the one problem I didn't do in the test that I have just finished was the one for which I felt lazy. It was worth 20% and I left 2 pages required for the solution more-or-less blank; I honestly didn't really know how to solve it. Niether, I solved right the bonus question - I wrote an answer that is obviously wrong, since it contains no relavent thoughts. I hope to still will get around 80%. But man!! Where is my 1st year's enthusiasm to get A's all the way?!   I'm putting it this way now: 2.5 years down, 1.5 years to go. (hopefully with no failures).  See you all soon!!

       With Andrei's car, it will cost you $30-35 one way. One thing I will ask you though: please switch drivers every now and then. Falling asleep is very real, especially when it's dark.   People, come on, who else is coming?

       ok, I'm up for 27th, if my parent's car will get fixed by that time. (I'm fairly sure it will).   About the new years celebration, I'd like to have a party at my place, or we can go out somewhere (not expensive) instead. Some people I know are throwing parties at some clubs as well as making private parties. (And I'm not thinking about Tif's one, sorry Jeka).   So what do you say? Viv, Fais, Mul, Waj, Vlad, Audrey, Jeka? I'll be also inviting some more people if an all-nighter will be held at my place, or even if we'll go somewhere else.

       Ok guys, the w-e of 27th sounds fine. Andrei, I say we go next week no matter what... I could probably even go work on puli-sacs with you for a couple of days to get some extra cash. Whoever wants to come to TO with us is welcome to join.

       We work on the 31st. The only two days that we're off are the 25th and 1st.   I am open to ideas for the weekend of the 27th. What I had in mind is you all come on Friday night, we have a little party at our place. On Saturday, we can all go to Niagara, take pictures and stuff, then we can go out on Sat night or just stay in and gamble (optional). On Sunday morning, there is a nice breakfast place nearby. And then you can go home... :)  So, what do y'all say? Viv, Fais, Waj? I don't know how many people are still reading this site... so whoever you are.

       I'm good for the 27th's week-end, but what about the 31st-1st celebration?? Is it included in the 27th starting week-end period?   Vlad, Audrey, do you have special plans for the 29th-30th-31st-1st :), or are you working during that time? (hopefully not).  Also, if we all come to TO, I guess we'll be following party ideas of Vlad and Audrey... If so, what are these thoughts (if it's not confidencial).   I also have some fun friends in TO region; I can call them up in case we'd like to see what's going on in downtown TO, student-party-wise... I don't really think that I need to, though.   Basically, I'd really like to get together during this new year's with all of you pple, especially those whom I haven't seen in a while, so post your plans here, so we can get organized. Thanks!

       OK folks, here's the thing. If anyone is coming, it should be on the weekend of the 27th. We will be in Mtl on the weekend of the 3rd of January. Next weekend (DEC 20th) is reserved for my family.   As far as quantity is concerned, we have matresses for 6 additional people. The place itself is pretty big, so if you bring your own sleeping bags, all of the members of this lounge will fit without a problem.  Everyone who plans on coming, please let me know for sure by the end of this week. Thanks!

       alright pple!!  how about we splan what we'll do for new year's and not orthodox christmas...  I have my appt free for any party if we agree; then it's possible to go to TO, I can drive, but i'd like 4 more pple in the car. What else? Vlad, Audrey are you staying in TO for new year's celebration? if so, going out or having an in house evening? How many people do you want to invinte at your place? And who else except Viv, Jeka, and me is considering going to TO?  Vlad, Audrey maybe you'd want to come here instead?  Also, I thought to go to Toronto and Niagara falls (or maaayybe Quebec city) before new year's with two french friends and maybe Valeisha. Dates were around 23rd-28th or 2nd-6th (for a day or two in either case). Jeka, want to join? Anybody else wants to join?  So, who thinks what? Plzz post some clear wishes, if possible, and santa will work on them!! :)  I haven't seriously thought about anything yet; but probably I'd prefer that we celebrate new year's at my place and go to TO for either chistmases.

       Ok!!! Here's my essay on technology for my "communicaiton & engineering" class!!!!!!!!! :)) (normally it was suppose to be 4 pages long, or 8 double spaced, on some dull sujbect I can't even remember, that has something to do with engineering). Well, I wrote this poem instead... The ending is, well, something I wrote just to finish the essay.   	I - Engineer  I drive, I ride, I fly and I stumble Over the head of this beautiful night. And here I am: a child of world's rumble Astonished by still air's delight.  Yes, I was born in the era of changes (That's what we always think) So progress and knowledge (like in all ages) Formed in my brain a link.  I studied, and ripened my flower of reason Eager someday to pop.  Yet, knowledge flourishing with no wisdom Gives birth to a dangerous crop.  That could have been me - an engineer: Ready to build and get paid.  Making for whom? I have no idea. My point is to create!  Starting with simple, like ovens and showers, I would want to explore. Searching for limits, abandoning shallows Spurred to craft more and more.  And justifications for my conscience, Upon ethics of things I build, Would deeply be crammed under life's daily problems And comfort would kill any guilt.  So I could be rich: a dad or a pervert.  As pervert, I'd die in mislead. As father, I�d want for my kids to be learned On aspects of wisdom instead.  So how did come about this matter Such young and arrogant I? Well, here are some points upon the latter Taken from my own life.   I praised technology as a child: My toys, my TV, my bike. And I disliked the rest at same while  As "hows" replaced my "why".  With "hows" as questions, life was enclosed In the dust of my thick school books.  Soon beauty notions were disposed of And boy�s pride caught me in loops.  Then I had a challenge: to each time be better In everything that applies, Like a hardworking robot, I made it happen, Encouraged by success� lies.  My mind was torn between winks of young ladies  And absence of real goals So I dug the knowledge to always be ready To ace, yet, another school terms.  I rushed through my years surpassing the progress Being trained to lead it one day; So most modern concepts of recent tech borders Were closely packed in my brain.  Laptops and cell phones, mp3 walkmans Protruded from my teenage dream, And world�s education was adopted To fit my flat TV screen.  So all this technology, did it help me To be a better man? Or did my ardor vanish as sanity Ticked by some weekly plan?  Answer these questions my dear reader. What good did technology teach? Typing and driving and some fixed idea Of a smaller world to reach?  Now, life seems so easy compared to times That plumes in old books describe. Nonsense; our present we�ll always exalt For our self esteem to rise.  History studying, reading and traveling Showed me other ways For happy living, calmer prosperity And prettier values to praise.  Yet, I won�t tell you of life beyond matter, Of morals, of soul�s cries. A wallet teaches you how to live better, And acumen is in your wives.  On dull silver streets made of asphalt and concrete You won�t notice me: Another reflection in still shopping windows, Plain furniture that you see.  I might be coworker, your neighbor � but stranger; A reflex of �hi� at the most. Yet, nice pretty car would extract a major  Expression of respect and boast.  So age my friend, and once you�ll compile The wisdom of lonesome grief; You�ll learn to be free like thoughts of a child, But it might be time to leave.   Andrei Moskvitch � December 2003

Oh I know, that's why I couldn't sleep, someone kept my attention away from sleeping. Vova we seem to have mind communication. So when I dream of you I'll let you know...hope it won't be dirty(kidding). Alright enough bullshit, let's get ready for those finals, 'sti.

       Stayed up till 6:30 am last night discussing with Ludovic news idea for solving quantum mechanic's present problems and trying to redifine aspect of four main fources in ANY other model than particle or waves one. Failed miserably. Yet, represented 6 dimentions in 2D which didn't lead to anything significant.   Finally, influenced by hunger, phisical exhastion, mental excitment, fumes of marihuana and constant intake of tea and sugar, we've came up with an interesting concept of modification of Borh's atom in oder to account for wave-like & particle like beheavors of energy and matter. Fell asleep, desperately thinking about reparking the car in a few hours. Got up to repark it, realised that it wasn't necessary; oh well, time to go to class.

       Yeah,  right, no more news! And how about those two competitions that you participated in during last two weeks?   I also believe that Viv has some portuguese blood, but Spanish might be easier to learn...  As for Mulanda, well, basically, the girl to whom he has sent a dozen of roses for Valentine's was too overwhelmed with emotions about the flowers that she forgot about Mulanda... :( . My role is all that was much of encouragement for Mulanda, as well as being the delivery boy, who never went to deliver, since it was done by the store. A small detail to this story is that the girl is in many of Mulanda's classes and that they have many common friends :P. I don't know anymore upon this subject that all you now, so maybe Doris can spice my text up by some unexpected moves he ought to take to get the girl.

       Hello to you all. Feels nice to be back here. Andrei, I'm surprized nobody still knows about Saturday night adventures...like getting drunk (me that is) and driving on the mountain (you that is). Mulanda, what's up with all that, you seriously got a g-f or b-f or what? Clarifications would be much appreciated. Bibi, since when do you participate in here? Don't get me wrong it's great to have you back. Viv, sometimes I think there is something hispanic about you - es muy bien perque tengo que practicar mi espanol. Well, myself I'm doing alright... that's it no more news about me.

       This morning I went cross country skiing on the river near to my app. Very beautifull sights. Everything is covered in snow, the entire plane of the fleuve is white and shining under the sun's rays. In one place we can see the water, but everywhere else it's ice and snow. There were many pple fishing on the ice, some go as far as the middle of the fleuve (approx 50m from shore). They say the the ice is atlease two feet thick, but at one place when I went too far from shore, I heard cracking under my skies. I freaked out and rushed back. Hopefully noone will follow my ski trace and drown.   Now it's time for Musee de Beaux Arts.   Also yesterday we went on Mont-Royal to sliding on sldeges (one of my own design and fabrication from old downhill skies). :)

       I got published!! :))   My translation of a poem got published in a magazine in France :).    Here's the poem:    Ballad About Nails   Calmly, he finished smoking his pipe. Calmly, his smile left in a swipe.   "Stand attention! Right turn!"  Captain's gait - dry and stern.  His words align with poise and force:  "Weigh the anchor. Set the course.  Those, who have a mother or a wife, Write to them - we won't come back alive.  Yet, it will be a noble battle."  And officers shouted:  "Yes, capt'n!"   As the most daring and youngest of all Thought, overlooking the horizon's wall:   "Does it, actually, matter where? Lying in water seems calm and fair."   In Admiral's quarters a report was done:  "Mission accomplished. Survivors - none."   Nails forged out of these men  Would be the hardest in the world's ken.   Original: N. Tihonov Translation: A. Moksvitch  (copyright, January 2004)

       There is one thing about Andrei that everyone ought to admire: he always sounds as if he has just reinvented the bicycle. If I understand you correctly, then, yes, I agree that words and expressions can have different meanings. And I do not believe that any given word or expression has an inherent (or "proper") meaning other than what we assign to it.  Socrates did 'start' as a sculptor, but so did a million other people...

       awwww.... Happy almost birthday... aw-m. :)  growing further and older... By the way, it's you who's living in a different city :P.   yet, you forgot to mention a neverending subject of you convesations. It usually starts like this: "Yaw! wow! Check that out!!" :)   On a serious topic, as of a snap shot of my life... Well, did you know that Socrat started as a sculpter?! (well, I bet you did, since we learned it in school). Yet, I was thinking recently. Doesn't life remind you of a 'salle d'attente' in the moments when you're  spending  time, say with your friends, watching TV, relaxing, etc, etc.?! Don't the expressions: spending time ..., veging with..., chilling ..., etc, actually have a proper meaning than the ones we usually use?!    Anyhow  , (why does using this word seems absolutely normal in this context? What's the  anyhow  about here?!) I'm going back to studing for my mid-terms. (now, is there a possibilty of judgemnet & explanation given upon my reflections above, by the last sentence I used, or can be it just common way out from getting into my thoughts, avoiding submitting in a sense?)

       Hello, hello my people! Just when everyone thought I was dead, I make a spectacular comeback and breathe the life back into this place. Well, well, believe it or not, but somehow this peculiar webpage is nearing its 3rd anniversary. Which in itself is quite remarkable, if you ask me.   Much has happened during these few years. We the inhabitants of this little weblog are growing further and further apart, living in different cities, acquiring new interests and loosing a lot of the things we used to have in common. I guess that's why anytime we get together for a drink at the piano bar, all we can talk about is Cegep, Bhatia, chessclub, hm... that's about it.   Which is why I will continue maintaining the Lounge. And I hope you won't forget about it either. Be sure to post a piece of your life, a snapshot of your existence at least every couple of weeks. It's amazing what this project can grow into. I think some people on this team will make it BIG in life.. Rember my words, dudes and dudettes :). And this weblog can become the record of their progress, a time bomb of sorts..  That being said, I probably need to redesign this place to reflect the changes that have occurred in the most recent past. Once again, any suggestions about what this page's new look should be are more than welcome.  Yours truly,

       Thanx guys!  Surprisingly enough, I managed to make it through the day without be dumped in a snow bank or a recycling bin - first time in almost a decade...that in itself is a cause for celebration!  Evgueny, I got your message on my phone, but, as you know, I was away this weekend and I didn't get the chance to get back to you.  I would love to come on Thursday.  It just depends how late my dinner runs (my friend, Andrea, is taking me out to Carlos & Pepe's).  If  I can't make it, 'merde' and break a leg.  Congrats on your new title Doris! Hope your hipanic civ class is going well.  Hasta luego chicos - y chica - Audrey, where the hell are you????????????????????????????????????????????????

       Drunkeness?  WHAT drunkeness????  I was tipsy once, ONCE in my life and none of you were there to witness it.  So there!  As for the conversation, it was about the existence of God, a topic I don't care to discuss on blogger.  Humph...Andrei, I resent the fact that you are attempting to defame my character.

       I have no clue what the conversation was about (I wasn't really there at the time) but concidering level of Viv's drunkeness combined with Fais' 'wasted' sarcasm, Audrey's moodyness, Jeka's soberness, Valeisha's tipsy wittiness, Cleo's wasteness, Josee's " chyopornost' " and the rest pple's lound and unclear participation, the convesation may have touched a number of fetish subjects.  The most likely outcome, however, I believe to be that niether Viv nor anyone else remembers what it was about.  :)   Yet, I recall very well that party finished (for me) at 7am with vodka and beer shooters with David's g-f (we had to finish the remaining alcoohol) and the kinky revealing (about David's g-f, and David himself) covesation that followed. Nothing bad was said, but it was quite stunning even to a wasted me. 'wink' 'wink'

       I try not to Viv ;).   Tonight is the first time this semester I stayed in the library untill (now) 2:10am. And it feels good. It feels just like the old times of freaking out every-minute-last-minute studing, except there is no more stress now. It's like early high school years: I know exactly for which grade I studied and what to expect.

       And news on my side.  I was in The Gazette's this Sunday's issue (photo and name), while practicing for a dance for a fashion show held yesterday in Metropolis. :)   The show was great! I and mean it. I danced Salsa and Swing in a group of 6 couples (there were: Jeka, David, Erika and other pple you don't know). It was the second dance show in my life (first one was with Audrey at a ball) and this time it was for a crowd of over 500pple! (thank god I had I couldn't see any of them because of the projector lights in my face and a good shooter of Vodka just before the dance, so I wasn't too stressed and simply prerformed the routine). The spectators were awesome too - it sounded like they loved us :). Yet, I know that I've screwed up a little at least in two parts of the dance.   Of course, Jeka did more than one dance including a marvelous stunning Tango - "Roxanne" after which many the girls came to tell him how well, i.e. hot,  he dances. Well, some chicks approached me too, but obviously, I didn't have time to flirt with any of them cause I'm a serious guy who doesn't have time for those silly amusements. (Nonetheless, those chicks were hot!! and I'm hoping to see one of them soon) .   Besides that, yesterday also it was the first time when I entered my class room and acnowleged that my fellow classmates were writing a mid-term.  Funny or ironic? I wasn't prepared at all since I thought that the exam was on thurday.  The good thing was that it was open book and open notes, the bad thing was that my notes were at home and the book was in the library where I had to run to get it. Finally, I wrote the test and now I'm hoping to get at least 20%.  Oh well.

       So, happy B-day to Audrey (once again) and to David who reads this blog once in a while.   As for news, I'll be taking part in a danse in a fashion show in Concordia next tuesday (with Jeka and David in it). Also I'm attending Kong Fu classes 3 times a week (cool heh?!).   I'll try to start filming a movie end of march. Anyone interested? I still need a light technician, a make up artist and actors (a variety of them, as extras and main actors).  Decorations will prop be taken care by Cindy if she has time.  Ray Phillips provides the equipment.  Any pros in the field?  Also my second mi-term period is coming up next week; final projects are due soon along with last minute assignements for the end of semester. Usual rush.  :)

       Just wanted to let you all know that McGill is having a talent show on Thursday night at 8:30 pm at the Student Services Bldg. on McTavish in conjunction with Concordia.  The money raised will be sent to underpriveldged and battered women in the Third World.  Hope is the name of the charity organising the event and it's founded and run by a very good friend of mine (Anika, for those of you who know her).  Tickets are $8 in advance, or $10 at the door.  If you need tickets let me know, and I'll get in touch with the organisers.  There will be several bands and dance groups performing and food will be served.  Please come out and support a good cause!

       Losers like me... ;)  I'd been out late the night before for Holi, the Hindu festival of colour.  In other words, it's an occasion that's an excuse to cover your friends in powdered paint and eat too many sweets.  It was the dancing after that did me in, hence the early night.  Andrei, you made a HOLE in a POT???????????????????????????  I'm surprised your house isn't a pile of ashes... Some people just shouldn't be allowed anywhere NEAR a stove...

       Just to copmlain: the cooking pot where I burned half a kilo of spaghetti for supper last week still has black pieces of the latter stuck to its bottom and I still can't scrub them off even with a fork after one week of dipping it in water mixed with many products including vinigar, alchool, etc. I'm afraid that I will have to thorw out this one of my mom's favorite cooking pots since today I have discovered that the its outer side of the bottom has something that rassembles a hole.

       Hang there Mulanda -  the new Canadian Citizen!! Congradulations!!   Don't warry, you'll be graduating this year (I hope, because I don't want to see you running after those undergrad chicks anymore, they'll all be left to me!! :P)  This week-end party times sound great! My suggestions are: lounge like night at my place anytime (I can invite some of the stiptease girls I've met recently, Vlad, you'd like em :P). Also, creazy club dansing sounds good to me, or we can check out budda bar (for some reason it became a popular place amongst students) or if a very nice place is Go Go lounge, espesially if we'll reserve a table there in advance and get a bottle (around 140$-160$, so 20$/person or so). Who's in?

       Cash beware! Roth also takes down names but it is not to give them good grades...  I have a shait Philosophy paper to write. I have forgotten what it is to have work to do. My exams are in a month -- all 10 of them. It is all idiot-level examination (the locals are not too smart) but when there are 10 of them at the same time it might get ugly.  The plan is to come back on the 17 th  of June I think I have a ticket booked but I am not entirely sure I ca trust their online system. Then it is either  urlLink Honk Kong  or Vancouver or just sitting around at home and smoking bagfulls of medical-quality weed.   Peace

       hey Andrei, I don't know, I have not had any problems accessing it using IE, Mozilla or Opera. Does anyone else have similar issues (assuming someone actually reads this)?  Or maybe McGill is blocking this website as detrimental to education :).

       Yeah and I have his "mommy" to myself for 2 weeks.  Andrei, library is good but you need to study in a group or else it will get to you. Find similarly paced individuals and work in a group. This is what studying is all about though. When you have to do it. Satisfy the real-time requirements of INPUT into brain STORAGE for a little while and OUTPUT on a sheet of paper.  Music is also good for your life. Here is a  urlLink little tune  that will give you a boost. For best results listen repeatedly.

       Jeka how was the competion? What's the schedule for next week one? Ticket price, 30 or 40 I don't remember?  Doris, how're studies? Vlad, what will you do once Audrey leaves for the trip?   I'm in the library for a second frull day straight. I have to get used to being here for next three weeks as much as possible. Plus, knowing that my mid-term failing rate was near 50% this semester and the non failed onces were around 60-70% tests, I should know what to do. So once again, I'm getting stressed for a number of things, soon fatigue from lack of sleep and good food will accumulate, yet, a failure is not yet on the horizon as the number of cycles hasn't even reached it's midway value. I can also add some equations here about safety factors, preload and load conditions, maximum thrust, temperature limits and oiling and repare procudures. Yeah, stress and stain relations are not even being mentioned here since types of elasticity moduli are variable.   Shit! I'm actually designing a some real shit for a V-22 US Airforce plane-helicopter hybrid!! Wow. Talking to myself outloud is the most important part of the project.

       Yeeeelow!  The glory days of the leather sofa are over. This is the preliminary  layout, which will probably stick around forever anyway. I know it looks generic (I didn't design it), but the temptation of having someone do the work for you for free is overwhelming. I really have no time to play around with templates anymore.   Please let me know what you think. Suggestions are welcome. Also, feel free to edit the profiles on the right and insert your pics!  Knock youselves out, ladies and gentlemen.

       first day in Paris: biked around Notre-Dame de Paris, looked at Seinne and the passing crowd realizing that I'm back here again, recalling many things. Then a dinner at my sister's: traditional Raclette, finally sleep.  Day: got together with some chicks I knew here from school, heard the gossipis, flirted a bit, ate lunch with them. Then got a paper from a secretary here, telling her that I came to Paris only to pick it up since she didn't send it to me through out the year (she was pretty shoked). Around 4pm met up with two good friends of mine and spend the rest of the day with them changing bars and restaurents till we couldn't take it anymore... fweeh! Finally sleep again.

       La Petite Catherine   Catherine vie dans une maison qui fut construite en 1901. C’est un bâtiment qui, grâce à une fondation solide construite uniquement de pierre et de marbre, aujourd’hui tient toujours. Catherine est fière de sa maison. Ses grands parents ainsi que ses arrières grands parents y ont vécus.   Un après midi, lors de sa sieste, Catherine fut réveillé par une odeur qui venait de la cuisine. Elle connaissait bien cette odeur. Une odeur qui la fit sauté de joie.  Catherine ne perdit pas une minute. Elle descendit les escaliers tranquillement en faisant, bien sur, attention pour que personne ne l’aperçoive. On  lui avait défendu d’être dans la cuisine après une certaine heure, mais son estomac affamé depuis déjà six heures, lui ordonna de suivre l’odeur jusqu’à la cuisine.  Elle due tout d’abord descendre le grand escalier de marbre qui menait  directement à la cuisine. La première chose qu’elle vit sur la table était un grand morceau de fromage orange déposé sur une belle assiette de verre.  Elle désirait tant y goûter. Elle se rappela soudain de ce que sa mère lui répétait sans cesse : « Ne soit pas si gourmande Catherine, ce n’est qu’un défaut qui n’attire que des ennuies. » Ça mère avait raison. La gourmandise n’est qu’un défaut. Mais elle ne pouvait se faire à l’idée qu’il était possible de s’attirer des ennuis par une si petite chose que celui de satisfaire son estomac de temps à autre. Ça ne pouvait quand même pas la tuer. Bien au contraire elle croyait que ce fromage lui ferait plutôt du bien.  Elle pouvait déjà goûter l’odeur alléchante du péché mignon.    La table était bien haute, et elle bien petite. Cela ne faisait qu’une semaine qu’elle puisse marcher par elle-même. Déterminée à obtenir ce qu’elle voulait malgré sa petite taille et ses courtes jambes presque instables, elle s’acharna à l’escalade. Après plusieurs échecs et de nombreux effort, elle fut finalement sur la chaise, et assez près du fromage pour y goûter. Les petites mains de Catherine brisèrent un minuscule morceau du beau morceau orange. Elle ne voulait pas qu’on s’aperçoive que le fromage fut goûté.  Mais il était tellement bon, que son estomac lui pliât d’en prendre plus. Cette fois ci, elle en prit un, un peu plus gros. Ah! Qu’il était bon. L’extase lui donna quelques frissons aux doits.   Soudain, un bruit la fit sursauter. Quelqu’un s’approchait de la cuisine. Elle devait partir. Elle ne voulait pas être grondé. Elle descendit rapidement sur le plancher de la cuisine avec un peu de difficulté. Les nombreux petits morceaux qu’elle avait pris lui avait remplit l’estomac et rendue un peu lourde. Au moment où Catherine, toute excitée de plaisir, avait atteint l’escalier de marbre, un choc la paralysa. Elle n’ut le temps de ne voir que son corps se détacher d’elle.  On lui avait coupé la tête. Catherine ne sentait plus rien, ne voyait plus rien, mais pouvait encore goûter les miettes du délicieux morceau de fromage orange qui lui restait sur la langue. Son ouï coupé de vie détecta un dernier son qu’il lui était inconnu, un grondement horrible s’évanouir en même temps que ses pensés. « Maudite souris! ».  Audrey Laurencelle

       Good news everyone!  I have just found out, that quantum teleportation was done with actual particles, atoms, for the first time in the history of mankind. Perhaps you've heard of this already, that it was done with photons, which hardly qualify as actual matter. However, it seems technological issues were resolved, and now actual heavy matter consisting of quarks can be teleported.  The New York Times June 17, 2004 p.A21, reports that two teams, one from NIST, Boulder, Colorado, another from University of Innsbruck, Austria, have teleported atoms of beryllium and calcium, respectively, as published in Nature, June 17, 2004. The setup involves triplets of charged atoms (A, B, C) which are trapped in magnetic fields.     1. B and C are entangled.    2. C is moved away.    3. B and A are entangled.    4. The state of A and B are read, which affected C at a distance.    5. When a pulse of laser light was aimed at C, then C was turned into an A (but which destroyed the A,B state, by the no-cloning theorem)  I got this off Wikipedia.   urlLink Wikipedia Article

       Well it suprises quite a bit. I'm not really rasist nor fashist, only against stupid, closed minded, and motivated crazy pple who exist in all religions, beliefs, and colors.   But media says that France should have expected such things a while ago. Plus, it's only the beginning for Western Europe, as analysts say. Also similar stuff is happening in the States regarding color.   And ANALYSTS and those who PREDICT things. Why don't they take a gun and go shoot down all the 'threats to society' instead of analysing actions of people and the consequences as well as response actions of government and consequences, at the end staying neutral and telling everyone: "we're just telling what is going on and will go on, we love you all, don't hurt us, hire us, we'll tell you what do to, and you'll take the responsability for your actions." Ugly donkeys they are!    I loved a statistical research earlier this spring made by the new European united government. It says that with all the immigration and birth of certain kinds of nations in some European contries, places like Spain (in 30 years) will have a majority of Albanian/Arabic population. Germany in 40 years - asian/african. France today - equally arabic/asian/french in 20 years majority arabic/asian. Belgim in 30 years - african/arabic/asian/slavic(!). England, obviously, Indian in close future as well. The rest I didn't read.  The only thing that dispises me here is that many immigrants (like most russsians in Mtl btw) do not find it necessary to be educated if a bussiness is going well. Or, even worse, become educated to do more bussiness and crush all the surrounds to make sure that you'll always stay. Some sort of this kind of mentality:  urlLink Poésie

       One imam in Roubaix met Lille mayor Martine Aubry on the edge of the Muslim-majority neighborhood where he preaches, declaring it Islamic territory into which Mme. Aubry--the most important minister of labor in modern French history, the early favorite to win France's presidential elections in 2007, and the daughter of former prime minister Jacques Delors--had no authority to venture.  Interesting. Is it really that bad in France, Andrey?

       I was trying to post a comment on the old layout page, but it directly switched me to the new one. Well, I'm in for Vlad's idea for Oka if that still holds. Thanks for your SuperGlue offer Vlad. I'll see if having a car that day is a possibility, although I strongly doubt it. I'll get back on that... Anything new with you people?

       Fais, random question - do you by any chance hang out at the Second Cup on Maisonneuve and McKay?  Thought I saw you the other day, but I wasn't sure (and I was kind of in a rush, so I didn't check...)

       Hello all, I got some some calls from Andrei about the old port, but I was at Winnie's at I had been there since 3 in the afternoon and after couple of multitudes of drinks, everything is hazy, including your decision making. I would have liked to see you guys, but there's always a next time, and I will make sure I get together with u (vlad and audrey mostly) . I long to see you guys, and in due time, I hope it will be so. Take care everyone.

       Satan was one of the angels of God. And he was the one who loved God the most, worshiped only God and lived only for God. So once God created men, he told to all the angels to love and worship men before him. But Satan refused to love and worship men as he loved only God. He told that to God and God became mad and told Satan to go to hell! That is how hell was created and Satan became the so called 'dark angel' of God. That was LOVE.

        The Power of Myth  by Joseph Cambell (or Campbell) is a very inlightning book to read or CD/DVD series to listen/see. Wow, I didn't know that such scientists/philosophers  existed in the states as recently as 30 years ago. If anyone of you will get your hands on his works, don't hesitate to spend some time thinking into them

       I've been meaning to write something for a few days now. Yesterday I wrote a large post, just to find out how irrepairably corny it was and delete it. So yeah, I have no drive to get personal on the net anymore. And this place will remain boring untill someone goes to some distant part of the world and posts from there.

       The world is full of maniacs. Just check out www.reactOS.com and ww.CoLinux.com  The first is a Windows 2k clone written by some kamikadze (at it's infancy, but actually runs...) and CoLinux lets you run Windoze & some linux distro _simultaneously_. No dual boot needed.  Makes me feel like the geekiest geek of them all, hehe

       The HUNT for&nbsp;the only American World Chess Champion - chess legend of one of the greatest chess players of all times ended this week as he got arrested in Japan and will probably will get deported to the US while&nbsp;being accused&nbsp;of playing chess.  &nbsp;  urlLink The warrant for Fischer was issued by a grand jury in 1992 when he violated US sanctions against Yugoslavia by playing a match there against Boris Spassky&nbsp;&nbsp; ...&nbsp;&nbsp; He acted illegally when he violated an  executive order  signed by President Bush. Not a law passed by Congress. &nbsp; The&nbsp;order told him not to play CHESS in Yugoslavia (!!!!!)&nbsp;

       Hm... I guess I will stick with my Pentium 4 for now. I was going to get a newer machine, but since the quantum computer is about to hit the shelves at Future Shop, I will wait.  Ir, who was that skinny guy who was giving the lecture about quantum computing at McGill the other day? Anyone of significance?

       The montrealer's name is Gilles Brassard from University of MTL. There is also quantum research in McGill with Crepeau (not sure about spelling), and Laflamme from the institute of quantum information in Waterloo.

       The article is geniune, don't be a fool. Photons were teleported in 1998. I was just waiting when something more tangible would be teleported. (What's a point of teleporting photons at speed of light, just beam the laser at something, done).   Yes, full scale teleportation is far too remote, I don't even know why would one speculate about it, but there is nothing that says it is not possible.  A quantum system can be teleported as long as no information is learned about that system, otherwise we are gonna have difficulties measuring it, due to the heisenberg principle. Who gives a damn about that.  If those experiments were possible to perform, that means, that technologically, quantum computers are not that far away.  Imagine chips operating at speed of light, and transmitting whole loads of information in one shot, that could mean rendering 3D images/video in realtime(or much faster), instead of weeks, as it is now. (This is how primitive my imagination is, yes-yes).  (I also heard that quantum computing will enable us breaking pretty much any type of encryption available today)  Who is that Montrealer...? I've only heard that Rutherford studied at McGill for some time, that's all.   "Everyone should know that most cancer research is largely a fraud and that the major cancer research organisations are derelict in their duties to the people who support them," Linus Pauling, Nobel Laureate for Peace and Chemistry.  (What's ironic about this, I've never met a single person who doesn't think Nobel Prize for Peace is a fraud, hehe)

       If you are doubting the accuracy of this article, you should check out the research team's web site.  I don't see why it is not possible, similar experiments have been conducted successfully for years now.

       is there any other sources that describe the same experiment? I've learned recently that New York Times likes to post 'shocking'  scientific stuff once in a while and then never come back to the topic again, so then everyone forgets about it since it wasn't 'really' true. I've seen Nature magazine before, but never read it so can't judge it's credibility. I also tried to find some info on the sites of the universities but couldn't.

       Yeah, this whole field is quite facinating.  But I think that the word "teleportation" should not be interpreted in the Star Trek sense... It is not as if an entire particle has been moved at a speed faster than light to a far away location.  In fact, it is two particles sharing a "special" relationship and one transmits its state to the other through a mysterious channel.  I think it will be useful to transfer secret information rather than a bank safe.  Did you know that one of the inventors of the theory of quantum teleportation is a Montrealer :) ?

       Actually, my comment it was genuine. I can't imagine how different the society will be. It's really beyond my imagination, and I don't know of any futurist who would attempt to describe a society structure that could result if ever teleportation is achieved for "large" objects. How about we make this thought experiment collectively and post our findings here? You may choose one economic institution (such as education or banking) and try to see how it could be affected once large-scale teleportation is possible.

       Vlad your contempt is out of place here. Just because you have severed off your ties with that part of science that has no immediate consequences to the real world does not mean it is not important. You are taking pot-shots at your old  girlfriend  just because you are not together anyore...  True that we will never have teleportation of massive objects (anything decoherent will be damn tough to teleport) and massive in the sense of more than one or two atoms.  In any case this field is sure to bring about some great new discovery that we will all benefit (or suffer) from. The fact that we can't see what that is now is no reson to stop searching.
