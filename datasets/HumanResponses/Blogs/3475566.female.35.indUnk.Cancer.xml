      Getting ready to have a blow out...well hopefully anyway...it seems like we've invited the whole town! Hubby and I still aren't getting along. Whatever either one of us says the other says the opposite. He thinks its because I'm off work. We mostly just cleaned all day and tried to avoid each other. What a way to live. Can't wait till everyone gets here to start some real conversation ( while everyone can still be sober enough to talk!! ) ciao

      Ok...let me begin by saying I am 34 years old. Attractive, fun, loving,compassionate, mother of 3 boys one is 11 the twins are 7 (ok..I should have said I was a referee instead of a mother!) I am divorced. I am remarried. I worked for the airlines for 13 years and got laid off in October. Took another job with a company that I worked my ASS off for and it got me nowhere. So I quit. May 5 to be exact. Here is the problem. ( well one of them anyway) My husband is legally blind so I'm the only one who works and now I'm not working. That issue really doesn't bother me though. We had a bit in savings. I am increasingly unhappy in my marriage. In my first marriage when I first realized I was getting unhappy I tried to work it out (counseling, books, etc ) needless to say it didn't work. Eventually we both just started living seperate lives ( with seperate people!) and we got divorced. I am starting to feel that way now again. The only difference in this one is that I still love my husband. I don't want to cheat and I don't want to get divorced. I would love it if we could work it out but it seems increasingly clear that its not going to happen. Last night I went out. ( We both go out one night a week with our friends ) There was a guy that I had met before and he had been inquiring about me. I wrote my number on a napkin and put it in my pocket. I didn't end up giving it to the girl to give to him but it scares me that I even wrote it down. Our life is different than most, with him being home all of the time. He is a very moody person doesn't have control of his temper at all. He talks down to me constantly. I guess you're wondering why I married him and why I love him. Good question. I guess he's really not like that all the time. We have good times. He makes me laugh. It just seems that those times are getting fewer and fewer. In all actuallity, I think he has a chemical imbalance, though I'm not sure there are tests for this condition, I notice that when he is constantly bitching at me and picking fights, his breath has a terrible odor to it. Coincidence? I think not!! Boys just got home from their Dad...crying over a power ranger. Lord give me strength!! I need to find a job. I want it to be something I enjoy doing. I could really care less about money ( well thats not exactly true ) but I feel that home life is stressful enough. This is a very depressing entry I suppose, I assure you I am an upbeat, usually humorous girl, guess I'm just at a cross roads here trying to sort my life out. Hope this helps me do that. Ciao!

      Well how should I put it? Today SUCKED!! Not only do I not have a job ( yesterday I think I applied at 60 places on line) Hubby and I had HUGE blow out today. I told him I wanted him to move out for a week ( I think thats the only way he'll change) Our dog was messed up too. We have a border collie she's 6 and she had a SHREDDED ACL in December 700.00 to fix well now its messed up again so I had to take her to the vet (like I have extra money to spend ) I guess it was good news- we dont have to amputate her leg  ( yet) she's on some kinda medicine 65.00 later and told to rest. If any of you have a Border Collie you know thats near impossible . Plus no more soccer ( her favorite sport ) EVER!! That sucks for her. Went to the pool today and caught some rays but that water was FREEZING cold. NO way I was getting past knee deep! Hubby is still here says he will try harder. Thats the 192nd time I've heard that...still counting
