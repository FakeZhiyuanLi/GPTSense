      I use FireFox for more then 1 reason and I just thought you might benefit from them if I posted it.  1.) Popup Blocker. Internet Explorer users often get bombarded by popups. I have a built in popup blocker and if I would want to see the pops on one page I just simply press the small icon that appears at the bottom left of the window.  2.) Tabbed Interface. My dad (an avid I.E. user) likes to show me stuff he finds on the internet. When I finally go over to the office to see what he wants to show me I see him going through about 20 different windows just to find it. With Firefox a simple press of ctrl+T opens  a new "tab" which shows up right under my Bookmarks toolbar and has a short description. Right now I see "Oompas Blog. :: Create New Post", "Oompas Blog.", and "Firefox - The Browser, Reloaded". This allows me to update my blog. Check it once I have updated it. And look through the Mozilla website for updates.  3.) Bookmark Toolbar. I see my mom constantly open up her bookmarks on IE to find a game to play. I am just 1 click away from any bookmark I have. Firefox comes with this handy dandy bookmarks toolbar. When you bookmark something it gives you the option to put it into the bookmarks toolbar. Once its their you just click the name you gave your bookmark and boom your at the website.  4.) Customizable Toolbars. Hate how IE is organized? Well I do. So once I got Firefox I just made a new navigation toolbar. It has all I need and not the extra crap I hate. I just right clicked on the main toolbar and clicked customize and just went from their clicked and dragged the options I wanted into the space I wanted and TADA all done and better then ever.  5.) Quick Downloads. In internet explorer you have to go through quite a bit to download something. In Firefox just pick if it should be opened by the default program or saved to the desktop. Then you will get a little download window and if you don't want to see it just exit out of it and the file will still keep downloading.  Well that's it. I hope I can convert some of you IE users. Heres the link to FireFox. http://mozilla.org/products/firefox/

      1.)The five children enter Willy Wonka's chocolate factory and are immediately asked to sign a contract and the first few lines read......." Hereas the management cannot be held responsible for any accidents, incidents, loss of property or life or limb.."( the words on the contract then become to small to read) now if that doesn't cause reason for alarm I don't know what does, Wonka and his group of blood thirsty midgets are setting these kids right up from the start.  2.) After the German kid falls in the chocolate river the boat comes around notice that there are no empty seats they had planned for the kid and his mother to be taken out by this time. Near the end the four remaining people and Willy Wonka climb into the Wonka Mobile, Count the number of seats.....That's right there are only five of them, So Wonka planned to have only five riding the Wonka Mobile at this point in the tour which prove that these "accident" that the children have been having are not accidents at all but were carefully planned by the demonic Willy Wonka and the man eating Oompa Loompas.......  3.)In the beginning Bill who owns the chocolate shop "The Candy Man" gives out FREE candy to the kids, How many candy stores do you know of that give out free candy? I believe that this man works for Willy Wonka getting kids hooked on Mr. Wonka's goodies then sending them into Wonka's FACTORY OF DEATH!!!  4.) You have to look close but if you catch it one of the women who were unwrapping candy bars for that second ticket winner was in the background when Mike TV is at his house she is also working for Wonka....  5.) Every time one of these terrible "accidents" happen the Oompa Loompas are ALWAYS around, and even more suspicious is that every time one of these "accidents" happen the Oompa Loompas just happen to have a song and dance number worked out about each child do they just make them up in the spur of the moment? If so, How do they all know the words and how do they know all the dance steps? but more importantly why would they dance and sing about almost killing a child? its as if they were mocking them or celebrating these childrens misfortunes.  6.) Children have "accidents" left and right in this movie some are shrunk to around 5 inches tall some are dropped into furnaces other come close to drowning , but the whole time Wonka and the Oompa Loompas act calm a little too calm for me as if they were expecting these kids to have these "accidents"  7.) Oompa Loompa's live in a HUGE factory filled with every kind of candy you can think of yet we never see the Oompa Loompa eat, wonder why? I'll tell you why!!! They eat children that's right those little freaks eat human flesh think about it the children that suffered these unfortunate "accidents" do you ever see them again??? No, Know why? Because its pretty hard for people to see you when your being digested in the stomach of a Oompa Loompa.  8.) Charley just happens to find that silver dollar in the storm drain right outside Bill's chocolate shop and Bill (who was hiding chocolate from children in the back of his store he says so himself) sold Charley a Candy bar but then Charley asked for one more, Bill picks up a normal bar and gives it to Charley Bill insist that Charley take this particular bar this bar contains the golden ticket, coincidence? I think not....  9.)There's Five golden tickets which are found by five children. First was the foreign boy, Second was the rich girl, Third was the gum chewing girl, Fourth was Mike the boy who did nothing but watch TV, And last was charley. The first to have an "accident" was the foreign boy and that was after Wonka screamed at him for drinking out of the chocolate river Wonka runs up behind him and the boy falls in although I believe that he was pushed I cannot tell for sure. Second to have an "accident" was the Gum chewing girl she was given gum that made he body swell at turn into a giant blue berry and that was after her father went snooping around Wonkas laboratory after being told specifically not to. The next one to suffer one of these accidents was the rich girl after she trashed the golden egg room she was dropped down a shoot that led straight to the Furnace and the last person was Mike, He was shrunk down by the Oompa Loompas after interrupting Willy Wonka, Now as for Charley, well Charley didn't have an accident...THAT WE KNOW OF but I have a theory at the end of the tour Charlies Grandfather gets mad at Wonka and says that he is going to sell Wonka's secrets so Wonka starts talking about a bunch of crap about how wonderful Charley is and how he is giving the factory to him well, My theory is that Wonka has no intention of giving him the factory he is just luring him into a false sense of security so that when they land back in the factory and the Oompa Loompas jump them tearing them to pieces they'll never see it coming it was also smart of Wonka because that senile old Fart never got out to tell Wonka's candy making secrets or about those blood thirsty Oompa Loompa....  10.) The rooms are designed to attract and kill the kids one by one first the Room made of candy to kill the German boy, Second the Room with The Gum in it to take out the second, Third The Golden Egg room to kill the greedy girl, and the TV room For Mike TV.  11.) Notice that out of all the grown ups that bought the candy bars none of them won I wonder what the chances of that happening are....  13.) Nobody Ever goes in, Nobody ever comes out....(Enough said)

      I am sorta running out of things to talk about so I guess I will review the speakers I got a couple days ago.  Logitech Z640 5.1 Speakers  Buying.  Well I had been looking at getting some new speakers. I wanted a good system like a 5.1 or 6.1 set (5.1 means 5 speakers and a subwoofer 6.1 means 6 speakers and a subwoofer.) So I started searching through my favorite computer site Newegg.com and in the speaker search options I put 5.1 black and what popped up? A $55 set of Logitech Z 640s. They looked nice especially with a nice blue led for power and not a yellow or green no I wouldn't need to change that. And for surround sound they were cheap. So I went to Sam's seeing if they had them cheaper because a while ago I saw them their on display but not for sale. I found them after awhile and they were $60 bucks. So I bought them.   First impression.  Its like chrismas in a box. EVERY speaker has a bag over it then a foam wrapper over the cable and then another bag over the rest of the cable. Took me about an hour just to get all the speakers out of the box and unwrapped. So then I arrange the wires to go be hind my desk and so forth then I hooked all the speakers into the subwoofer. And took the three plugs from the center speaker and put them into my computer and booted up. And what did I hear? NOTHING! I had to go buy a sound card. So the next day I went to Frys and picked up a SoundBlaster Live! 5.1 for 20 bucks. Put it in my computer installed drivers. and hooked up my speakers and I went to my first test. Battlefield 1942. I could hear the planes around me in the air and I could hear bombs being dropped around me. I could hear the tank shells hit me. I could hear the explosions of planes with amazing sound! Then I decided to test the sub woofer it took awhile before my parents left so I could crank up the volume but I just did and WOW. Superb sound in the highs the mid range and in the lows.   In the end.  These speakers were a great upgrade from the crappy $10 ones I had. and for $60 they were a great deal. It even helps me in game because I can hear people sneaking up behind me to try to get a knife kill.   They have Oompas Seal Of Approval.   I LOVE YOU MY LOGITECH Z640S!
