      Ok, so it isn't that last day of school yet, but it really seems like the days are getting much longer. With my hair shorned short and my face clipped half-way clean. I search for a job, hopefull getting my 1st application at SEARS excepted and starting there sometime soon. Fucking network.. It would be nice not to have to wake up at 7 or 8 in the fucking morning for an interview but oh well. I can live. The past few days have been hecktick yet fun. I don't know if I explained yesterday.. Like much happend anyways. When it rains it Hails. Literally. During soccer I got pelted with Hail and was soaking wet AH pissed me off. I like that damn shirt. Got to see Katherine today and yesterday. She is so beautiful, I am still somewhat amazed that she would even want to go out with me. On to more entertaining matters, two things I MUST do. I have to do my report over Dracula for Ms. Lunceford, and I must complete my Finals Test for Mrs. Hart, both will be the basis on wether or not I get a B in the class. I have Ms. Lunceford convinced I have a good one coming to her and that I am already done, but yea... we know how that is. As for the other shit tis all easy. Layman is going to be an easy B, all I have to do is make-up one assignment and it should be a B, then I am basically excempt (SP?) from the final. Other then that not much has happend. I am hoping to be able to go out tonight, then go to my interview tomorrow. I will drop by Churches and say hello to Caitlin.   Well, I am out. Boring things not to do out there. I will go not do them. BANG BANG BANG..

      YEA, aight, today was a slight bit boring. Not much went on, didn't do much of anything. Wow, that seems to encompass all of my days? How ironic.  Well, overall I will say today was a good day. As in good I mean nothing totally and uterly sucked balls. 1st hour was just normal besides the getting to mess with Chemicals. I managed to destroy 3 different pieces by overheating them or just droppping them. Yup, I am dam smooth. Other then that not much happend. Talked to Austin most of 1st hour, but that was about it. 2nd hour didn't even have anything going on. Kinda like Kaitlin I just fell asleep in my desk and slept for a hour.  Lunch was much more entertaining then I had expected. The car next to us at Sonic was Hydee something and Micheal something and Micheal was  getting head I believe. Which IMO is really dam funny considering they were sitting in the Sonic drive in. Yea, nasty... she is nasty and annoying. O well, I don't even care. 3rd hour I don't even know what happend. Sadly to say I fell asleep at the beggining of the class and woke up about when the bell rang. So not much happend there at all. Expect I had a really odd dream. I was walking down this really long aisle.  Well I will get back to all of that shiznit later. Right now I have to leave for Wal-Mart.   SO WORD...  CD of the day is NIN Halo 14 or The Fragile. Ownage CD.

      Ok then. Me first post in this blog like thing I now call my Blog. Easy enough attempting for me to maintain it. Don't know if I can manage 7 months but I sure in hell can try right?  Well today. Rather boring as usual. I woke up, actually on time, which somewhat amazes me considering when I decided I needed to go to sleep. 4:00 AM on a school night. Aren't I just a smart one, O YEA. Well, other then that nothing really happend. Went to 1st hour, took about half the notes then fell asleep on my arm with my pencil in my hand. That was fun considering when I woke up we were finishing watching Iron Will and I almost fell on it. I need to listen to music in there god dammit.O well, like it matter, not much time left in school.  2nd hour=Boredom. I fell asleep after finishing my work. So easy I must say. Writing definition I already have on the back of notecards. Easy A, but I am still lazy. Then I have to do that fucking book report over Dracula. I don't wanna do it, but at this point I don't have much of a choice. ROAR!. Yea, not a nice class. Lunch- Not much to say about it. I ate nachos. I stole a muffin like always. I talked to Matt, Jon, and Nathan as Matt and Jon played Magic. Then I went and sat in the hallway. Yea, boredom is my life. 3rd hour, yet again, boring. We had to choose number at which table we sat. I rigged it and I sat with all my friends. We finished the work and got the extra credit plus the easy A. I love easy A's. I got dismissed early to help my dad with the dogs.  We had to take all 4 of our dogs to the vet... O wow. Suddenly boredom swept over me and I decided not to describe that entire event. We sat in a lobby for 2 hours then got the dogs shots. Came home, and I sat there and was lazy.  Yea, not much of a day. Never is. Then I sat down and created this after my shower. WHAT A MOTHER FUCKING BORING LIFE!. O well, peace to everyone.

      Not the world, just my sophomore year in High School. Feels kinda good to have made myself survive another year in school. Some people really piss me off though... not going to name name's because I don't feel like talking about it.  Well, altogether I had a good day. Played cards in my classes, then went to lunch at CJHS (Choctaw Junior High School). Skipped 3rd to eat Second lunch with Katherine, that was fun(Damn Did Katherine look Good...). It was just hanging out, nothing more, but a nice change sometimes. Went to school with 10 mins in third, then left for 4th. Went over to Alex's house and watched a movie. It was pretty funny.  After that went and picked up Katherine, Grant, and Tracy from the junior high after school. Dropped them off and went home. Yes, enjoyable day. Went and saw Shrek 2. Good movie. Went and ate some food and Applebee's. Good food. Now I am home. thinking about trying to do something tomorrow, but don't care. Fuck it.. I will be on later.

      I like it when I have a journal I am sure nobody I know will read. It makes me kinda happy. Anyways, onto the news of yesteryear or just yesterday, whichever you prefer to call it. Friday- I don't remember school, only thing I remember was chilling out in Angels car during lunch then seeing Katherine right after school. She made Bass Drummer is marching band, so good for her.  I went to see Troy with Scott. We dropped by Wally World (Wal-Mart) and picked up some candy. Ok, so 10 Dollars worth of candy, but still just alittle. While there we ran into Amber and Lindsay. We invited them to go with us and they did. Still can't believe Lindsay drives a Mustang GT. Just doesn't seem right. But no matter.The movies was good. Just the way I like it, bloody and violent. I will most likely go and see it again sometime, just when is what matters. Other then that nothing occured. Saturday- Woke up early, lke 6:30 for a job interview at 9am. I don't even know why I was up that fucking early, kinda makes me sad. Well, I drove to the interview and had to wait for like 30 mins to talk to Merlin. Yes, that is his actual name. He is one of the managers, well the interview went really well for the 10 mins it lasted.  Then I went and chilled over at Tristens house for alittle while. Found out some VERY interesting information while over there. If you actually read this (Which who does? Really lol) just ask me and I will tell you if I feel the urge.  Got home about 12 O'clock. Did a little vacuuming then headed over to Grant's. We hung out for a little bit, then headed to Katherines house. The plan was to go there, meet with Tracy's mom and go to see Troy. Yes, see it again. They had not seen it yet so I was just going to pay to take a nap. Met her dad sorta, didn't talk much before we left. Fucking movie people wouldn't let me Buy multiple Tickets which fucking pissed me off. I piss on Regal Cinema. We ended up chilling at the Mall for awhile. I picked up Projekt: The New Face of Goth. A very good CD to my surprise. I will start to pick those up more often.  After the mall we headed over to hang out at Tracys. That was fun yet painful at the same time. Katherine ended up leaving multiple 'marks' on me. She left a giant one on my neck, then another couple of bruises of my stomach. Kinda odd actually. The one of my neck is HUGE, I am surprised my parents didn't notice it until today. Had much fun there, then headed home. Grant stayed the night and we ended up talking about Women, cards, and just about everything else. Quite interesting what you can find out just by listening with only an occasional amount of speech. Sunday- BORING AS HELL. Woke up. Got Dressed. Took Grant Home. Went home and did Yard work all day. Felt kinda good to do it actually. couldn't take my shirt off because of the bruises, but still felt pretty good. Parents noticed the Hicky on my neck, they didn't really say anything about it, I don't really care either. Not like it is anything they haven't seen before. Now I am home alone. Being bored like. Yup, that is me.  Song - Atreyu , Judgement Day.  CD- A Perfect Circle - Thirteenth Step Car- Monte Carlo SS, Green with Yellow Runners.

      I am up today because Katherine ACTUALLY called me. She called me at 7:00 in the GODDAMN MORNING. but hey, she actually called me. Well after waiting online till about 4is, I gave up on waiting for anyone else to get online and found refuge in my room where I watchd a few episodes of Berserk (Still haven't figured out WTF is going on at the end.) and then went to sleep somewhere on the five side. Then I just woke up not to long ago from Katherine calling me. *Shakes head*, makes me think of that one song.. can't remember the song... the artist... or fuck the line I was just thinking of.... I should go back to sleep. But I can't, I am awake... butt fucker. Well, that is all for now.  *YAWN*, I seek something to do today, and as it starts now, I will need something early on, so give me a call people.

      WAKKA! Ok, so I am in a decent to good mood. Today was an overall good day.  Besides the whole not talking to Katherine for 2 days. Yea, that kinda makes me sad, but my stupidity will not allow me to call her. Yes, it is an ego thing, so don't fuck with me about it. Well, I woke up around 6:30.. said fuck it and went back to sleep. Got up around 11 and got ready to take Kali (My sister) and her Friend Elizabeth home. She is hot.. dam. O well. I did that then came home. Jeremy came over and we went out to blockbuster. Traded in Ninja Gaiden for Gladius.  I got the month long gaming pass. So I can have one game out for a month if I want or trade it in. ANYWAYS. We played that for awhile, then he had to leave. I cleaned up the edge of the pool then came inside and plopped my ass infront of the computer. Dad came home+ Kitchen not being done=pissed off father figure. O well, he got over it.  Asked mom nicely if I could borrow car so I could go to the Mall with Pay and Elise. Good choice considering A. I got out of my damn house.. SO BORING. B. I got to hang with my friends. Haven't hung out with them for abit and it was rather fun. Although Pay drives slow so I got in some Soul Calibur II time. Got to kick 3 people COUNT IT 3 PEOPLES ASSES! YEA!. Ok. Well, we did that, then played some DDR after some walkage around in the mall.  I want the Trench Coat. I don't know about the hat. But I want that trenchcoat. Elise tried on a dress/skirt thing. She looked good in it IMO.  I would have tried something on besides the trenchcoat, but I don't like to and I don't look to good in many things. BLAH.  O well. Lets continue. Well, we left and headed for Denny's. Never though I could go 50 on the highway as I waited for Pay and Elise to catch up to me. I held their speed for abit then my music just forced me to go faster. I ended up hitting about 80 before I dropped back down. Then this damn Jette pulled up next to me... THE NERVE OF THAT FOOL. He sat there and glared at me then tried to race me.... something he won't be doing to me.. FUCK NO... I downshifted and pushed the pedal. Car got faster and faster. I hit about 100 when I went shooting past the poor bastard. after a minute of so I slowed down and realized he was way back. Car probably has a chip and shut down the engine. HA, I laugh at the fool. WEll we picked up Chris then chilled out Denny's for awhile. That was fun. Considering I was just munching down on Sugar the entire time. I was trying to get hyper, but I couldn't manage it as usual. For about 3 mins or so later on in the night I was kinda jitty but that faded. Well, I had to be home at 10:30 so I did. Gave Elise back he APC CD. Then left. Nothing happend unitl I left again with my dad and traceled to his work. BORING. O well, like I can do anything about it. He tried to convince me I needed to be responsible about my choirs, yea whatever. Like I don't get them done everyday anyways. He just bitches to bitch.  Then when I got home from that I got the most disturbing news from my friend Sarah. She, whom is really a sweet girl although sometimes annoying. This guy who told her he liked her, tried to take advantage of her.. made me want to kill that fucker. Any guy ever takes advantage of any of my friends.... jail does seem reasonable sometimes. that put me in a bad mood. Then I found some lovely quotes, while working on my own. I forgets my own, but I remember this one.   Religion has actually convinced people that there's an invisible man living in the sky who watches everything you do, every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a special list of ten things he does not want you to do. And if you do any of these ten things, he has a special place, full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish, where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry forever and ever 'til the end of time! But He loves you. He loves you, and He needs money! He always needs money! He's all-powerful, all-perfect, all-knowing, and all-wise, somehow just can't handle money! Religion takes in billions of dollars, they pay no taxes, and they always need a little more. Now, you talk about a good bullshit story. Holy Shit!   Yup, thought that was funny. O well. other then that nothing has happend to me remembering.

      Yea, I saw that while I was going on another insomniacal venge. Decided I had best post and update. Well, not much has happened over the past few days. Yesterday, all I did was sit at home during the rain. Not much else happend. Today I went and say the 'Day After Tomorrow' decent movie. Haven't been feeling very good.  Maybe it is just me, maybe it is my mind rotting. Don't know, don't really care. Just want it to pass by so I can get on with life. Pay said I needed to get layed. Maybe.  Or maybe I do need to accomplish something. Not much to do though. Haven't had much luck with anything, especially when it comes to being me. Feeling really outta it. It is late. Time to lay in my bed. well, calls me sometimes people, you know my cell number.

      Sadly to say, recently I have been wondering who I really am.  I mean, I know who I am. But news of people talking behind my back has brought to light the truth behind every smile and fake lie.  I realize some people don't like me, some people do.  I used to live a double life, I mean, I believe most people that ACTUALLY know me realize that. Since I don't let people know me, I guess that is kinda difficult. I just never have a reason to explain it. Ask the questions, I will answer them. I don't hide behind lies other people shrowd infront of me. That is why I got the two different signs below, each telling me who I am supposed to be, yet one is more accurate then the other, but which one really? People don't know. Nobody has yet to answer that question about me. I am confusing... even to my own self-concious thoughts. Well, it is time for sleep. Someone please explain something to me.

      Aquarians basically possess strong and attractive personalities. They fall into two principle types: one shy, sensitive, gentle and patient; the other exuberant, lively and exhibitionist, sometimes hiding the considerable depths of their character under a cloak of frivolity. Both types are strong willed and forceful in their different ways and have strong convictions, though as they seek truth above all things, they are usually honest enough to change their opinions, however firmly held, if evidence comes to light which persuades them that they have been mistaken. They have a breadth of vision that brings diverse factors into a whole, and can see both sides of an argument without shilly-shallying as to which side to take. Consequently they are unprejudiced and tolerant of other points of view. This is because they can see the validity of the argument, even if they do not accept it themselves. They obey the Quaker exhortation to "Be open to truth, from whatever source it comes," and are prepared to learn from everyone.  Both types are humane, frank, serious minded, genial, refined, sometimes ethereal, and idealistic, though this last quality is tempered with a sensible practicality. They are quick, active and persevering without being self-assertive, and express themselves with reason, moderation and sometimes, a dry humor.  They are nearly always intelligent, concise, clear and logical. Many are strongly imaginative and psychically intuitive, so that the Age of Aquarius, which is about to begin, is much anticipated by psychic circles as an age in which mankind will experience a great spiritual awakening. The Aquarian philosophical and spiritual bent may be dangerous in that it can drive the subjects into an ivory-tower existence where they meditate on abstractions that bear little relevance to life. On the other hand it can help the many who have scientific leanings to combine these with the Aquarian yearning for the universal recognition of the brotherhood of man, and to embark on scientific research to fulfill their philanthropic ideals of benefiting mankind. When some cause or work of this nature inspires them, they are capable of such devotion to it that they may drive themselves to the point of exhaustion and even risk injuring their health.  Both types need to retire from the world at times and to become temporary loners. They appreciate opportunities for meditation or, if they are religious, of retreats. Even in company they are fiercely independent, refusing to follow the crowd. They dislike interference by others, however helpfully intended, and will accept it only on their own terms. Normally they have good taste in drama, music and art, and are also gifted in the arts, especially drama.  In spite of the often intensely magnetic, forthcoming and open personality of the more extrovert kind of Aquarian, and of their desire to help humanity, neither type makes friends easily. They sometimes appear to condescend to others and take too little trouble to cultivate the acquaintance of people who do not particularly appeal to them. They do not give themselves easily - perhaps their judgment of human nature is too good for that - and are sometimes accounted cold. But once they decide that someone is worthy of their friendship or love, they can exert an almost hypnotic and irresistible mental attraction on them and will themselves become tenacious friends or lovers, ready to sacrifice everything for their partners and be faithful to them for life. However, they are sometimes disappointed emotionally because their own high personal ideals cause them to demand more of others than is reasonable. And if they are deceived their anger is terrible. If disillusioned, they do not forgive.  Aquarians work best in group projects, provided that they are recognized as having a leading part in them. They have a feeling of unity with nature and a desire for knowledge and truth that makes them admirable scientists, especially astronomers and natural historians. They may excel in photography, radiography, electronics - anything connected with the electrical and radio industries - aviation and everything technical. On the arts and humanities side their progressive tendencies can be expressed in writing, especially poetry, and broadcasting, or as welfare workers and teachers. Some have gifts as entertainers and make good character actors (having an ability to mimic) and musicians. The more psychic among them possess healing gifts, especially in curing the mentally sick.  Among the faults to which they are liable are fanatical eccentricity, wayward egotism, excessive detachment and an inclination to retreat from life and society, and a tendency to be extremely dogmatic in their opinions. Aquarians can be a threat to all they survey or a great boon for humanity in general. Circumstances - for example, continuous opposition to a cause they hold dear - may cause the atrophy of the openness of mind that is one of the Aquarian's most attractive traits. They may express a lack of integrity in broken promises, secretiveness or cunning. Simmering anger and resentment, rudeness or, worse, a tense, threatening silence which may suddenly burst out in eruptions of extreme temper, these are all part of the negative side of the Aquarian. This can also reveal itself in a sustained hatred for enemies that is capable of enlarging itself into a misanthropy toward the whole of mankind.  Traditional Aquarian Traits: Friendly and humanitarian Honest and loyal Original and inventive Independent and intellectual  On the dark side.... Intractable and contrary Perverse and unpredictable Unemotional and detached

      Pisces, Pisceans possess a gentle, patient, malleable nature. They have many generous qualities and are friendly, good natured, kind and compassionate, sensitive to the feelings of those around them, and respond with the utmost sympathy and tact to any suffering they encounter. They are deservedly popular with all kinds of people, partly because their easygoing, affectionate, submissive natures offer no threat or challenge to stronger and more exuberant characters. They accept the people around them and the circumstances in which they find themselves rather than trying to adapt them to suit themselves, and they patiently wait for problems to sort themselves out rather than take the initiative in solving them. They are more readily concerned with the problems of others than with their own.  Their natures tend to be too otherworldly for the practical purposes of living in this world as it is. They sometimes exist emotionally rather than rationally, instinctively more than intellectually (depending on how they are aspected). They long to be recognized as greatly creative. They also dislike disciple and confinement. The nine-to-five life is not for them. Any rebellion they make against convention is personal, however, as they often times do not have the energy or motivation to battle against the Establishment.  Pisceans tend to withdraw into a dream world where their qualities can bring mental satisfaction and sometimes, fame and financial reward for they are extremely gifted artistically. They are also versatile and intuitive, have quick understanding, observe and listen well, and are receptive to new ideas and atmospheres. All these factors can combine to produce remarkable creativity in literature, music and art. They may count among their gifts mediumistic qualities which can give them a feeling that their best work comes from outside themselves, "Whispered beyond the misted curtains, screening this world from that." Even when they cannot express themselves creatively they have a greater than average instinct for, and love of, beauty in art and nature, a catlike appreciation of luxury and pleasure, and a yearning for new sensations and travel to remote, exotic places.  They are never egotistical in their personal relationships and give more than they ask from their friends. They are sexually delicate, in the extreme almost asexual, and most Pisceans would want a relationship in which the partner's mind and spirit rather than the body resonated with their own. Unfortunately they can be easily misled by a lover who courts them delicately and in marriage makes them unhappy by a coarser sexuality than they expected. They are nevertheless intensely loyal and home-loving and will remain faithful.  In their employment they are better working either by themselves or in subordinate positions. Their talents are individual in a commercial business or similar undertaking. They would be afraid to manage more than a small department, worrying always that they would fail in a crisis. They can make fair secretaries and bookkeepers. Their sympathy equips them for work in charities catering for the needy, as nurses looking after the sick and as veterinary surgeons caring for animals. As librarians or astronomers they can satisfy their mental wanderlust, and their fondness for "faraway places with strange-sounding names" may turn them into sailors or travellers. Many architects and lawyers are Pisceans, and when the creative abilities are combined with gifts of imitation and the ability to enter into the feelings of others, Pisceans find their fulfillment on the stage. Their psychic and spiritual qualities can lead them into careers in the church or as mediums and mystics. They may find an outlet for their creativity as caterers, and are said to make good detectives because they can imagine themselves in the place of criminals and understand how their minds would work. In technical occupations they are well employed in dealing with anaesthetics, fluids, gases and plastics. Because of their lively versatility and inability to concentrate overmuch on any one project, Pisceans often simultaneously follow more than one occupation.   Traditional Pisces Traits: Imaginative and sensitive Compassionate and kind Selfless and unworldly Intuitive and sympathetic  On the dark side.... Escapist and idealistic Secretive and vague Weak-willed and easily led

      Finally decided to get off my lazy ass and write something in here.  Well, where to beging, I really do not know. Well, Thursday, I believe (Sorry but my memory is EXTREMELY lacking as of late.) Katherine, Tracy, Grant, and Jeremy came over and hung out.  Most of the time we just sat there and watched Jeremy play Gladius. That game is dam fun, that is all I know. Well, Katherine and I eventually made it into my room and began to entertain ourselves. No need for details, yiu'll know how it is. Well, skip ahead, after we were done with that. (Yes, my parents were gone this entire time KNOWING they were over at my house.) We had to take Katherine and Tracy home by 9:00 pm. So Jeremy had to drive them home. Well, we did that, then Jeremy went home. Me and Grant just hung out and my house and bullshitted about till around 10 or so. Then I drove him home on the slippery rodes. I drove safe considering I was having trouble getting any traction in certain portions of the rode. After that the night was over and I went home and got some shut-eye.(At about 4 or 5, but hey, I still got some shut eye.  Friday was a rather long day. Most of the day I was at home cleaning house like always. Then I recieve a call inviting me to go swimming over at Katherines house. That was much fun, although Kahterine did get in trouble for her grades. I feel so horrible.. wish there was something I can do, but I know I can't fix it. I had alot of fun hanging out with Katherine, Grant, Tracy, Josh (Katherines Brother), Micah (Josh's and my friend) and Jeremy. Josh seems much better then he used to, and Micah, wow has Micah changed since the last time I saw him. He lost alot of wait. Still really boastful and somewhat of a show off, but hey aren't we all every once in awhile. Well, that night ended with nothing but a sorrowful good-bye which I really didn't want to give. I didn't want to leave Katherine alone there, I don't know why but I just felt horrible. Well, dropped Grant off at home, dropped Jeremy off to go and get his truck. Then me and him went home to my house. Stayed up most of the night playing Gladius. Yes, still the Gladius. Went to sleep after having a talk for awhile. Found out some of the stuff I heard really is true. I change when I get a Girlfriend, I guess I become self-centered and a cocky little bastard. That is one of the supposed reasons Tristen broke up with me.   Onto Saturday. Woke up relatively early,(around 9ish) and began to play Gladius. I played this game until 2 when I went and picked up John and Perry, then Grant. We all hung out at my house until we left for the Halo party. After I picked Josh up I headed for the party and let the fun begin. Considering how annoying some of the people there were, I had a really good time for the 5 hours of Halo I played. I won most of the games, but I was met by some opposition from Jeremy. Not like you guys really want to hear about it. I still feel bad that I never called Katherine, but I don't want to be an asshole and stay on the phone while I have a friend over. Well, left about 10:45, droppped Josh off and Grant and Jeremy stayed the night at my house once more. We stayed up till about 5 playing Gladius. Fun fun fun.  Sunday(Basically Today.) Well, woke up. Played Gladius. Started to get a bad feeling about Katherine, this was met when I spoke to Tracy and discovered Katherine had been bawling her eyes out. I feel like so much shit now, I knew I should have called her. I called her and found out she couldn't do anything. Well, Grant went home, Jeremy went home. Then we went to White Water Bay. Not much I can say about that besides it was overall fun. Some moments I was abit pissed, but I had an overall good time. Since I got a Season Pass I plan on going alot. I am going to repeat a few summers ago and become a Frontier City Rat. Skipping ahead since I really don't want to describe it all unless it is over speech, kinda tired of typing. We went back to Grant's house and Watched 'Along Came a Spyder'. I will definitely have to finish it sometime. Then went home. Yea, that was the extent of my o so amazing life. Yea boring as fuck. I was able to talk to Katherine some, but yea, that was short lived because I had to go. Told her I would call her back, but I didn't get home in time.  Let's dip into the nice little Gossip Pool though. Since I know who reads this,(At least I think I know who reads this.) I am not worried about it.  I know dead subject, but News came that Tristen was going to go out with Jeremy after Breaking up with me. But that didn't happen so she ended up with her Cheap fuck Will. Then, it turns out that she went out with him the same day as her breaking up with me. Yea, I know, doesn't change anything, but it still lessens the respect I feel for some of these people.  Well that is it for now. Please post up if you read this so I know I exist.

      Well, I have basically given up on ACTUALLY putting what happend during the day in such in this, and it is more on how I feel at the moment on how much I put up.   Today was interesting, although I am still depressed over teh fact that Katherine can't basically do anything for along ass time. Well, she can do stuff, but she can only leave her house like once a week or some bullshit like that. Makes me really mad, because sometimes I am wondering if she chooses other stuff over seeing me, although understandable at times, kinda makes me sad. No matter, nothing I can do about it.   As for me, I had a good day, hung out, met up at mall with Pay und Elise. BTW, Patience you did look extremely good,(Not just talking about your eyes either so don't take that wrong). I need to stop being me as much though, it isn't good for me. Need to just go back to being the old, slow and stupid Eric, I liked him better. *shrugs*, Tis not the mattors.   Watched Donnie Darco YET again. Gah I am in love with that movie, especially that song. AHH, so much, that movie just like traps me in it, I don't know why. The song is Mad World though, haven't figured out the artist as of yet. The line I am talking about to all you who don't know "I think it's kinda funny, I think it's kinda sad, that the dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had...", yes somewhat.. ok REALLY depressing, yet at teh same time very liberating for me.  Well, I am off for now. Cya.

      Religion has actually convinced people that there's an invisible man living in the sky who watches everything you do, every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a special list of ten things he does not want you to do. And if you do any of these ten things, he has a special place, full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish, where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry forever and ever 'til the end of time! But He loves you. He loves you, and He needs money! He always needs money! He's all-powerful, all-perfect, all-knowing, and all-wise, somehow just can't handle money! Religion takes in billions of dollars, they pay no taxes, and they always need a little more. Now, you talk about a good bullshit story. Holy Shit!
