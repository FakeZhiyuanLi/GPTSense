        Vision of Glory!            Do you ever get a sense of excitement wash over you when you worship the Lord?     I do. Sometimes they are slow burning and I can feel it growing as I worship the Lord. Sometimes, like this morning, it just rushes on me - like    suddenly I am aware of the reality of what I am singing and praying  ,  suddenly I am aware that Jesus is with me and I am humbled by his presence.          Such an occurrence happened this morning. In my car, listening to  Michael W Smith's   Agnus Dei  and that repeated phrase...."     for the Lord God almighty Reigns!    "      What truth!  He is ruling and reigning right now . "But I don't see it, where?" I hear you say. To which I say - everywhere! It's not about what our physical eyes see because if we were to trust our own natural ability then we would should surely panic at the state of the world. But what do we see with our spiritual eyes? That's the key - in   the spiritual we can see God ruling and reigning in every situation  . If we see that first then when we open our natural eyes we see things differently.   We see things as they are with God's purpose in mind  .   We see the world as ours for the taking  .  We see that " in this world [we] will have trials and troubles, but fear not because [Jesus] has overcome the world !"   (Jn 16:33)        Thomas Gray  wrote in   'The Bard'   "    Visions of glory, spare my aching sight    ". How true! A vision of Glory will spare our eyes, will take us away from seeing things the way the world sees. Why? Because to have a vision of glory is to have a vision of the resurrected Christ,   a vision of Glory is to see Jesus in his ascendancy  , a vision of glory is to  " fix our eyes on Jesus, the author, perfector and finisher of our faith  "  (Hebrews   12:1-3)       Do you eyes sting when you see yourself and your situation? Does your sight ache when you watch the evening news? Then I would suggest that you are seeing things in your own strength and understanding.   See as Christ sees  .       Talk to Jesus about what is around you. Commit to him any sadness that you see and the questions that are raised in your mind. Do all these and you will surely come into the knowledge that  'the Lord God Almighty Reigns .' Will all questions be answered? No, and mine are not for there are things I just don't understand. But when I see as Christ sees and   I commit everything to him by faithful prayer and petition, then the peace that passes all understanding guards my heart    (Phil 4:4-8)  and I know without doubt that   my God reigns!

         What a great Name Jesus has!        It wasn't an uncommon name for the time and to distinguish Jesus the Son of God from other people called Jesus, the Bible refers to Jesus of Nazareth (John 18:7) or Jesus son of Joseph (Jn 6:42) along with others. It's also the Greek form of the Hebrew name Joshua (acknowledging I am no Hebrew to Greek scholar but I fairly certain that's right.) which was and still is a widely used name....so why give the Son of God the same name as other people of the day?      I was thinking about the Name of Jesus this morning (hence this musing) and I find that   when I stop and meditate on his name that my heart is stirred with me to worship  . I don't use it as a mantra or any kind of chant but I worship the Name of Jesus - I trust you know what I mean by that.       The name of Jesus was given to the Son of God because all names in scripture have a meaning that perhaps is lost to us in the 21st Century. Jesus means   god is/is my Salvation'   (all depends on the dictionary but most will agree that this definition is correct) and that was what Jesus came to do - he came as the Saviour of the world, for me and you. He was given the name Jesus because that was who he was, and what he was sent to do.   It was his identity (Saviour) and his mission statement (Saviour) all in one!         Isaiah 40:8  says that the "grass withers and the flowers fail but the Word of the Lord stands forever" Jesus is the Word, from the beginning - that's what John 1 tells us. His Name will never pass away, he was, is and always will be the Saviour of the world, and the Saviour for me and you. In the film Gladiator (top, top, top Movie!) there is a great line. It comes from Juba (the African gladiator) talking to Maximus (gladiator and hero) as they talk about how Caesar can't simply have Maximus executed as this would grant him martyrdom. He says:    "You have a great name. He must kill your name before he kills you."            The enemy couldn't and can't hold the testimony of Jesus down because his Name will endure forever.    From the hope that a Saviour was coming, to Herod failing in his murderous intent, to temptation in the wilderness, to crowds turning on Him, to the betrayal, to the cross and the depths of hell and torment of which we will never endure......the devil could not kill Jesus and take away his name!    The Name of Jesus is the Name above all Names!         That's why it is the ultimate confession we can make - that   if we confess with our mouths 'Jesus is Lord' and believe in our hearts that he is raised from the dead - we will be saved    (Rom 10:9-10).  Why? Because we identify that it is only the Name of Jesus, the  Name of salvation , that can save us. We are  baptised  in the Name of Jesus  (Acts 2:38),  we are healed by the Name of Jesus  (Acts 3:15-17),  we can  perform great miracles  for God in the Name of Jesus  (Acts 4:30),  we  preach the gospel message fearlessly  in the Name of Jesus  (Acts 9:27),   demons are cast out  in the Name of Jesus  (Acts 16:18),   we bow the knee  at the Name of Jesus  (Phili 2:10)   we do everything  in the Name of Jesus  (Col 3:17),   we are commanded to believe  in the Name of Jesus  (1 Jn 3:23)           As Christians we have the Name of Jesus like a hallmark running through us   - let us keep alive the testimony of Jesus in our own lives, we too have a great name!       Take some time to think upon the Name of Jesus . It can be the sweetest word and song, it can be the most desperate of cries when I have nothing else to cling to - it has and will be both to me for all my life. The Name of Jesus.   Meditate on the Name of Jesus....it points you to the man himself   and he is the focus of our hearts and all eternity. There are many songs we know about Jesus but the song going through my head is the one below. Let us not become desensitised to the Name of Jesus Christ but let us raise it high as a banner that all peoples will be drawn to it!       " Just the mention of your Name, causes me to bow before you. Tears flow as I adore you, at the mention of your Name - just the mention of your name ."        Dave

         Last Nights Gathering...        Can I just say first and foremost that I had a great time last night in the presence of God with Godly people. Psalm 22:22  says "   I will declare your name to my brothers, in the congregation I will praise you   ." Last night it was wonderful to once again praise God together and for us all to worship together.      Knowing I was going to share some thoughts on thinking big and looking ahead, I was very blessed with the word of God that came prophetically. I thought I would summarise what God said to us that we would remember and act on it.         When we gather it is not just about Pontypridd but that we are a part of    All Nations worshipping the Lord   . We must think bigger, outside of these 4 walls and know that as we pray and worship, we have global and universal effect      God told    us to    pray with greater expectation    than we have been. God will give us specific things to pray for and when we seek his face we must call on his name with an expectancy that God will act on our words.    We were encouraged that it was    a word for everybody   , not just for a few. That if we want Him to, God will arrest each of us with a desire and a compulsion to seek his face. We must re-order our days in light of God's plan, we must look again at what we give priority to.    It is the "   little foxes that spoil the vine   " (Song of Solomon 2:15). It was the little foxes that couldn't reach the fruit but would scurry away at the root with their claws. No one thought they could do much damage but little by little they killed the root of the vine. God will show us little things in our lives (not necessarily bad things) that he wants us to stop doing or stop being distracted by.    We must "   expect the expected   ". While we know we will do "even greater things" (John 14:12) we must also begin to expect to do what we have heard about, and what Christ did. Many times we believe we must expect the unexpected, [which is very true]- but first let us look to move in what Christ and the Apostles moved in because we know that the standard/ precedent is there that we can do these things by the anointing and power of the Holy Spirit.     So there we go. As well as that prophetic word that was an exhortation to begin to think about where we are at as a group and as individuals.        What are we ready for in Pontypridd?         Where do we see ourselves as individuals?        What will we give ourselves to?      That we would all be looking at ourselves and asking God   is this where you want me and if so what do you want me to do?       Important questions with exciting answers! let us all be    thinking bigger   ,    praying with greater expectancy    and    seeking God for wisdom and guidance    for the next phase!

         Morning Muse...        As I was musing over Pontypridd this morning, God brought me back to Haggai, where it say's give careful thought, 4 times, give careful thought to your ways and as they did it say's in      Haggai  1:14       So the Lord stirred up the spirit of   .....   ..          As we muse over Pontypridd as we give careful thought to our ways, the  Lord will stir our spirits a fresh  for The   House of the Lord in Pontypridd  . So let us give careful thought to our lives and as God said last night get rid of the small things that hinder us, from that which God has called us too.     Adrian

          Morning All!      Last night I was reading and praying and seeking God for Pontypridd when it struck me a fresh that what we are in Pontypridd is one vital aspect of all nations coming to worship the Lord. All Nations.  All Nations!  That's incredible and we're already seeing it among ourselves.      Even in a group of 30 (adults and children) we see All nations: England, Wales, Nigeria, Kenya....extend that open to our family in Cardiff and it moves further: Scotland, Northen Ireland, Iran, China, America, Kuwait, Malaysia, India, Uganda, Zambia....and I'm only stopping there because I can't remember them all!      Take a minute to think about it.   When we meet we aren't just expressing something in Pontypridd but we are announcing God's Kingdom come to all the world!   Men and women shall go out from us and go to lands and shores that some of us may never set foot on....but we are still a part of it because of the seed we can sow into lives! That opens up everything! Below are some verses that I pulled out last night - if you have a spare 15 minutes, look some of them up and thank God that All nations will hear of his fame!           Hab 2:14         Ps 22:25-f        Ps 67        Ps 72:17-f        Ps 86: 9-10        Ps 98        Rev 15:4        Ps 57:5        Ps 113:1-4        Isa 12:5        Isa 40:5        Mt 6:9-10        1 Tim 2:1-6       Be blessed, Dave

       urlLink     This is one view of   Pontypridd   from the 'Common'.  It is a valley full of life!    urlLink      As a church, we believe that God has spoken to us concerning Pontypridd, that it will be a gateway to the valleys. That means we believe  God will do a significant work in  Pontypridd   that will unlock towns and villages upwards through Wales.       God has spoken to us as a group concerning Pontypridd and the scripture is  Joel 3:12-19 . Verse 14 says: "   Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision! For the day of the LORD is near in the valley of decision  ."         Dave

         What do you see?         That's a question that God asks his prophet time and time again . It's never a trick question either, God really does ask us the obvious of what is in front of us.      With that in mind I begin to wonder why we sometimes miss what God is showing us.  God doesn't want to trick us , mock us, play games with us or mislead us - none of that is of Him, in fact that's not his nature at all. So how do we miss it, why do we miss it?      Looking at building God's church in Pontypridd causes me to answer God's question - what do I see? The  answer I give surely depends on the vantage point I look at things . For example, if I was to walk down to the town centre in Ponty, to the river by Sion street - I wouldn't actually see a lot. I'd see some life, I'd see poverty and people wandering about, youths with not much to do and a fairly run down area with not a lot going for it. But if I was to go and stand by the World War monument on The Common and look out over the valley, I know all of the other things are down there still but vantage point is such that I see further. I see the glorious hillsides, I see a bustling town, I see hundreds and thousands of cars going into and around Ponty as a hive of activity, I see, hundreds of streets, different communities...I could go on.       One of the limits we place on ourselves is the limit of vision . The vantage point I take allows me to see less or more, to see the immediate or the bigger picture - we need to see the bigger picture. The immediate can seem daunting.  T he bigger picture (which gives context to the sometimes daunting immediate) gives hope and focus to a goal.        For Pontypridd there is a big task ahead of us and it can seem daunting....but if we go up higher, if we  see as God sees  and look at Pontypridd as God sees it, with his eyes, his vision...then we cannot fail to see that His plan is bigger and better than we could ever hope for.       Challenge : wherever you are, Ponty or other....  what do you see?   Are you hindered by the immediate, daunted by the obstacles? Then go up higher, see the bigger picture, see what God sees and see that there is hope, a future and a plan.        Prov 29:18      Where there is no  revelation , the people cast off restraint ;  NIV        Where there is no  prophecy  the people cast off restraint ,  RSV         Where there is no  vision , the people perish:   KJV               "When I dare to be powerful, to use my strength in the service of my vision, then it becomes less and less important whether I am afraid." - Audre Lorde

       Hoorah!  It works....it actually works, technology aye!  Memo to me - check spelling before publishing....there is no 'undo' in cyberspace.     Musing From Pontypridd #1     So this is a bit about me. My name is Dave Shutt (David is my official name...or when in trouble) and I am 26 years old. Boran in the North of england I now reside in the south of wales having also spent nearly half of my life in the middle of the above said two places.  I became a Christian when I was 5 years old. I have to be honest and say that I don't remember the exact day or what I felt like in the days after the event....but I remember my salvation, I remember wanting Jesus in my life and I know that it happened there and then. Too young to understand? Nah, Jesus loved kids and always drew them unto himself. That evening 21 years ago, Jesus was passing by and drew me in...I couldn't and didn't want to resist. Have I been behaving perfectly since I was 5....c'mon, let's not kid ourselves, but something happened in that moment - my name was written in God's book of life and I became a new creation.  I remember when I was younger longing for a better testimony....I marvelled at the 'God  saved me from my criminal ways and now he uses me to preach the gospel'  testimonies that I heard about. I loved to hear people recount of how they had turned away from  a ,  b  and sometimes  c . I had nothing like that, no life of crime to be saved from and nothing much to turn away from...it bothered me if I'm honest.  But in time I have realised that  my salvation is 100%  and as rock soild and glorious as any I have ever heard.  Angels in heaven celebrated with me  and for me the day I knew the Lord just as much as when Paul the Apostle or Zachaeus the tax man met Jesus and chose to follow him! I had nothing to turn away from but I thank God that he saved me early and took me out of the path of things I may have got mixed up in.  I thank God that his grace to me was a confident and sure grace that bestowed to me that I didn't have to grow up on societies terms but by the word of God . Yes, I have made mistakes and decisions which have cost....but I never had to face it alone, I didn't have to be bound by guilt and beat myself up.....because I knew his saving grace, I had known his mercy first hand and  I knew that forgiveness was mine if I would confess my sin to my dad, God the Father .  And here I am, 21 years after my salavtion and my love and desire for King Jesus has never been stronger. In two weeks I am gettimg married ( more on that another time ), I am involved in seeing his church take root in  Pontypridd  and seeing lives transformed and nations changed through ordinary people...it's incredible that Jesus knew me for who I am, chose me, sought me out, died for me, rose again for me and now sits at the right hand of God and has a place prepared for me'.....  amazing grace  !  Let me leave you for now with Psalm 92:15 (NLT)  "They will declare, "The LORD is just! He is my rock!  There is nothing but goodness in him! "   Dave

          Dear World,         There is a bandwagon called  blogging , and my friends I have just jumped right on it! Landed with two feet, burned all my non-blog bridges behind me....let's see if I can keep this up.       Musings from Pontypridd?  Well, the church I am a part of it in Pontypridd and we believe without a shadow of a doubt that God's kingdom, his heaven on earth or his rule in action, is advancing and taking ground. Man these are exciting days.      Inspired by the living blogging legend that is and remains Nick Howes in Coventry, I have started a  blog  to record and note those things God is stirring in me regarding his church and what is happening in All Nations Church Pontypridd.      I say that these things will be regarding Pontypridd in specific but I want to acknowledge at the start that the gospel of Jesus Christ is to  the ends of the earth!  There is no door closed to his message, there are no hearts impervious to it, all shall hear of him, all will choose to follow or deny him. These are musings from Ponty...but they are glimpses of what God is doing emphatically all over the earth! That is the reality of where we live and of the times that we live in. Excited yet?      As this is the first entry and I don't yet exactly how this works...I shall stop here and click 'Publish Entry' and see what happens. All being well, I'll be back soon to offer offer more musings from Ponty...      Dave
