      maybe i have to run a regression to figure it out, but somehow I have  the feeling the less I work, the longer it takes to get to sleep...  not that work would be hard or exhausting (sitting in front of a  computer....), but still somehow ......

      "One who can recite the Kama Sutra forwards and backwards while sitting in the lotus position under a scared fig tree".....  The answer of a Chicago Economics Phd student to the question "What makes a successful economist ?".  Now the only comment I have (besides the realization i am citing too much out of Colander), doesn't the guy have his priorities wrong ? I mean, "RECITING" the Kama Sutra, come on, find a wife and then... you know what ;-)

      Not about the growth of Money supply, but about methodology  1) Adopt an "outside" view of behaviour 2) Start with observation 3) Test implications continually 4) Use the best knowledge available 5) Do not look for answers "in principle" but address concrete problems  not his own words, but derived from his work by Hirsch and De Marschi (1990), cited by Colander (2001)

      I have to admit the website of our department does not really look too   fancy.... first step to remedy this is to build websites for my whole class....  The project is almost finished, first results will be online pretty soon.

      "...one reason it didn't work is that Friedman always replied that he   didn't say what I said he had said. And I was simply saying what everybody   believed Friedman had been saying"  James Tobin (in "Conversation with Economists", Klamer 1983)

      Just had a visit of the Princetonreview message board.... Once upon a time this board was a source of information, frequented by aspiring applicants and seasoned students (or so....). A fast way to gain help with your application, get the word on departments, help with the admissions process. Now it's bleak place with a few tepid responses after waiting time.  Now the question is, is it just the summerhole (is that an english word, in any case it is the literal translation of a german word describing the absence of attention during the summer months) or did the change in the board structure really cause the demise of it ? I guess one of the big problems they are still facing is their firewall, which basically shuts down all tries to post there....  But then if this board is dead, where did all the applicants go ?  (I guess the lawyers had a different board up pretty fast, but they like to talk trash all the time anyway....but all these econ people, IR, polisci, history..?  maybe I have to google a little bit to find them....

      I am also reading another book, named "Mathematical Encounters of the second kind" by P.Davis  First i had to figure out, what an encounter of the second kind actually is...  "A close encounter of the second kind is an observation of physical evidence of extra-terrestrial visitation. Footprints, heat or radiation damage to terrain and Crop circles, though controversial, are all examples of close encounters of the second kind." (copied from some website)  the book itself is a kind of autobiography of a math professor, who also has a  preference for writing (fiction that is). Since he mixes the two, I am never sure, what is fact and what is fiction, especially when it turns out that the part I thought was fact is actually fiction but then again pretty much fact because he only changed some small details to make it fiction....  nevertheless what do i get out of it: Mathematicians can write nice, easily readable books, so why shouldn't economists be able to do so.... And second, never be an arrogant snob with regard to your academic position, it could prevent you from having sherry with Lord Rothschild (at least I hope that this part was fact not fiction..)

      started a new book today, "The making of an economist" von Klamer and Colander. They describe Econ Grad programms at then end of the eighties with students complaining that they getting overwhelmed by the math and meaningless theoretical research and nobody has enough energy, time etc left to actually get more active in societal meaningful contributions, as for example policy. From what I gathered I and my classmates have a somewhat similar perspective, but it doesn't seem as bad as it was (at least here at Yale now). Policy jobs seem to be higher reputated as earlier, especially at the IMF and the Worldbank. And Economists seem to get somewhat closer to reality, at least when I hear them complaining that then nobody used surveys and today i think they are a pretty common tool.

      short rant,  why can't the US use a nice day-month-year format... also celsius, meters and kilometers , grams and kilogramsm, liters , etc  all nice things  but then I don't want to hear about an american having to cope with european bizarness.

      now it's five minutes later, time for some content  actually I was playing the role of an Econ prof at a mock job talk, (or more precise of a marketing business school prof...) of a marketing business school phd candidate. interesting experience, but I guess I was too nice....  Now more interesting was her main thesis, namely people are overtly optimistic about their future choices (not her thesis, that's already been documented). So there exist choices where you have the choice between a vice item (imagine a brownie) and a virtue item (insert the apple here). Now if you have an isolated single choice you have some probability to pick the virtue item, however if you know that you have the same choice in the future again, you are more likely to pick the vice item (since you are believing that you will act virtuosly in the future and pick the apple then, but hey, we know that this belief is wrong....)  What does this tell us know, aehmmmmmm, maybe I will use this blog as a virtue item (doing something for the public good....;-) )everytime I get a too large Ice cream (major vice item for me)

      ok, after a first try in Februar, maybe i actually get around to do this.  Now the hardest decisions have been made:  It has a name, It has a byline, and a new template was chosen.  maybe the next time I get around to actually write content....
