       Today morning and afternoon was a pleasant day for me.. But it wasn't that goodin the late afternoon when i called my dar to tell him i'm going eat with charm,ade and mei wei.. He msg me after that.. He told me that he hope i wasn't lyingto him and i should know myself.. I thought that making an effort to ask the 3 ofthem to tok might gain his believe.. But nope, i was wrong.. He said that i mighthave called those guys to shut up b4 i called him.. At that point of time, i realidunno what else i can do.. It was my fault that i doesn't gain his trust since i usedto lie to him before.. I nv blame him or what.. All i want to see is to see him happy.. I dun wan him to anyhow think and feel unhappy.. I juz wan a happy relationship.. Seeing him happy is the biggest satisfaction i will have.. Juz seeing him happilywith me reali bring in alot of joy in my life.. We both have the same aim in thisrelationship.. i wan him to be happy and he wan me to be happy.. that's why hedecided to change himself and rather be unhappy and sacrifice for me.. For me,i wan to change and give up on things juz to see him happy.. i doesn't feel 'wei qu'or neither am i unhappy.. everything that i do for him is worth it.. i do it willingly and with no regret.. I want to be with him forever.. I know im not going to findanother person that will love me as much as he do.. I can sense his 100% heartis this relationship and i reali feel xin fu.. He fu chu yi che zhi yin wei ta ai wo..Wo xue zhe fang qi zhi yin wei wo ai ta.. I wan no one else except him.. No otherguys can replace him in my heart.. Sometimes when i can reali feel his unhappiness, i simply feel like dying.. My heart was so hurt and broken..Tears always seem to drop.. Even if he's someone with no potential or broke,i'll still want to be with him and standing by him.. I'll always give him the supportthat he needs.. Love is blind.. I accept and love him for who he is..    I just want you to know.. I found a reason for me.. to change what i used to be..A reason to start over new.. And the reason is you..

       Haiz.. todae was supposed to be another happy day.. everyday without anything going wrong or nv quarrel with my dar dar, is consider a happy day le.. But, haizzzzz.. We quarrel again le.. It's my fault for today incident.. I stay back to do my homework, but ended up playing gun bound when ade jio me play.. i didn't tell him.. I play halfway, den my com hang.. Haiz.. i did not dare to tell him i ended up not being able to do my work and was playing games first... Haiz.. how i wish i didn't play.. Den won't miss the chance of seeing him msging me in msn.. I reali didn't know that he msg me.. i didn't even be bother about msn.. He was disappointed with me for lying to him.. but my intention wasn't purpose to lie to him.. i didn't mean it de.. I have nv been lying to him except this incident.. I was 100% faithful and devoted to him.. but he have nv realise or sense it.. He say he doubt my words when i told him 'i love you' .. Even if this incident have nv happen, those that i say that i meant it also will be no point.. he didn't even believe me when i'm telling the truth.. Whatever i say is the truth.. i also did say is my fault.. he just wont want to believe me.. Haizzzzz...

       Haiz.. such a boring and tired day.. Today is the 5th of August and is the 5th month of me and my dar dar.. Wanted to tok to each other so much, knewing iwill be very late, my dear still persist to wait for me to talk on the phone. I wantedto hear his voice too.. I went off from work at 9.45 and reali rushing back home..In e end i reach home at 10.40.. I faster went to have my dinner, and finished mydinner in 10 mins times.. Den went bath and i called my dear at 11.05.. We weretalking so happily,onli until........ 11.51 that we quarrel once again... Couldn'tbelieve that at this so last min we can also quarrel. What i say was onli meant tobe a joke.. I reali didn't know he would mind it so much.. My tears went dropping last night.. haiz.. reali every night also cry.. I reali want to be happy together withhim.. Even when we quarrel, knowing he's still in my heart, i'm still happy.. Thosetimes that we have are very precious and times that we quarrel wouldn't affectmy love for him. I know he's still very unhappy now even though he say he wasn't angry anymore or what.. i know him well.. i knew exactly that he wasn't feelingokie at all.. haiz.. reali didn't know what to do.. I wan to spend a happy 5th monthanniversary with him so much.. and i know he wan it as much too.. But... haiz..dunno lahz.. sianz...

       Tired day.. Whole day in school till 5 plus and straight went to work till 10.30 den reach home.. The bus journey trip was damn slow. Stand almost the whole journey.Haiz.. Didnt msg much with colin today. Neither did i talk to him and hear his voice.. Miss his so much.. I reali find myself loving him alot.. Miss him even more deeplyas each days goes by.. But i think he doesn't feel it.. Nvm lahz.. such feeling onliownself will know and feel it.. Dunno why i got that feeling that Colin doesn't loveme as much as before.. When i told him how i feel, he always give me assurance that he loves me even more than last time.. I think i'm the one like that.. I'm realidoing what i can to be a good girl friend.. I'm ready to give up everything thathe dislike.. I learn to overcome temptation and be a faithful and true darling of his.. I reali hope he can feel it.. When msg, one moment he can be cold towards me..the other moment he can be very sweet.. I remembered he used to say no mattertired he is, he will always 'tong' and wait for me to tok on the phone.. eventually,todae he didn't.. i msg him i off work le.. i waited his reply for a while and he reply"sorrie, didnt hear my phone.. so late den msg me.. i going sleep le.. good nitez.. sleep early hor".. I replied, "haiz.. okie.. nitez.." He didn't reply me back le.. thinkhe's very tired and went to sleep le bahz.. i didn't blame him for wanting to sleepand not waiting for me.. im not so not understanding to that extent lohz.. but can'the sound sweeter when he tell me he want go sleep?? We dun sound like couplesat all.. I was very sad actually.. Nothing goes well this year..But im actually happy that i met colin.. reali feel so sick and tired of life.. family couldn't bring me anything to be happy about.. Onli always bringing nag and nag and nag.. If not a blacky face and raising of voice.. Reali so sick and sianz of it le.. Thinking about it..I reali can't recall any happiness that this family have brought for me.. What a failure.. Nowadays when i got problem,i tend to keep most to myself.. I used to share it with my third sis.. There's no one in the family who i reali can talk my problems out with.. Always bottom up my sorrow in my heart.. Why i learnt to be independent?? Cos i know there's no one i can depend on forever except myself.. By.+.<>.+.mYs3lf
