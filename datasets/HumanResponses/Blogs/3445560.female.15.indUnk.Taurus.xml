      What's the difference of never knowing at all? When every step I take is always too small. Maybe it's just something I can't admit but lately, I feel like I don't give a shit.   Motivation such an aggravation, Accusations don't know how to take them. Inspiration's getting hard to fake it. Concentration's never hard to brake it. Situation never what you want it to be.  What's the point of never making mistakes? Self-indulgence is such a hard habit to brake. It's all just a waste of time in the end. I don't care so why should I even pretend.  Motivation such an aggravation, Accusations don't know how to take them. Inspiration's getting hard to fake it. Concentration's never hard to brake it. Situation never what you want it.  Nothing's new, everything's the same. It keeps on dragging me down, it's getting kind of lame. I'm falling further behind, there's nothing to explain. No matter what you say nothing 's gonna change my mind.  Can't pretend on doubt until the end. It seems like leaving friends has become This years trend and though I can't pretend. It's not the same but who's to blame, For all those stupid things I never said.   Motivation such an aggravation, Accusations don't know how to take them. Inspiration's getting hard to fake it. Concentration's never hard to brake it. Situation never what you want it to be.  Motivation such an aggravation, Accusations don't know how to take them. Inspiration's getting hard to fake it.

        FROZEN QUEEN/ KING You dont want love to come through to you. You like it the way you are. To be unreachable, no need to show feelings. Hiding everything inside you. You are already used to it. You say yourself that you dont need anyone, that you stand on your own two feet or that you dont have time for these things. But in reality you are scared to get hurt. You feel save where you are: by yourself, nobody can hurt you there. You invent your own relationship in your dreams. You just need to know that you COULD get a partner. Thats it. PLEASE VOTE, I want to know what you think about my quiz, I worked hard on it.You can always message me or tell me how I can improve that quiz. Ill sure write back.    urlLink   	~THE big LOVE TEST!!
