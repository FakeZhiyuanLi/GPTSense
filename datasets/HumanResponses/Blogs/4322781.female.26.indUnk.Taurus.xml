         I have been trying so hard to create, to write, to express my feelings on paper once more, but the words are stuck in the back of my mind, yearning to be freed, this endless madess around me, I keep it all within.  there is so much termoil inside my brain. it is hard to concentrate on just one thing  no happiness, no possitive thoughts in my mind all I wish is to lay down and die, I asked the doctors to help me so, but they just signed some papers and sent me home I am worthless to all around me. all I wanted was to set my pain free. feel like I am normal and not just a fool wanting to take my life so cold and cruel. I see my pills apon a shelf, I see a blade to cut myself. not knowing which way to turn. I wait it out with sadness and hurt. every one saying that it's all ok. but what do they know. they don't know my pain. the torture, the sorrow. felt each passing day. I just want it all to go away. lay down and die is my one true wish, but I will fail no matter I am just a bitch. ruining everyones life around me I need to go away, just need to leave but there is no place that cares for me. I am just another file apon the shelf, will they finally get the clue if I kill myself I don't want to really take my life, just some one to listen and know this is no lie. maybe I should give it one more try fuck that shit, I will live, no matter how hard I try sometimes it's hard to resist, all this pain, sorrow, frustration. why bother with this world and wait for tomorrow. fuck this life and all involved. no one cares no one cares at all. they just want me to live to cook clean and care for the kids. I don't even like the kids anymore, they don't care, no one does. why the hell am I wasting my time. when I should consintrate on how to die.  I go on living everyday just sitting and waiting for this pain to go away, but it never does and never will. until my breathe become silent and still. I have begged for help and been turn away. no more reason to see another day. lost in the darkness of my mind I am begining to run out of time. they don't need me, they never will even after my breathe is silent and still they will continue to live life live life well without me around to make it hell.. they will be happy, like they should but will never see I did the best I could I tried to stay strong and fight my inner demons but I lost again now my mind is screaming, telling me to end it all and close the doors down this dark narrow hall.

         THE ABUSER                       I can still hear her cries within the wind       and feel her tears in the rain       a terrible memory still haunts me       a terrible memory of what he did              I could hear the beats of his strong hands       and I saw the blood that followed       all I could do was stand and stare       as I quietly hid in shadows              sometimes I would run and hide        to somewhere where I felt safe       to escape from my mother's frightful screams       and away from her beated face              I have seen the abuser       and the damage he had done       every misuser       is like the setting sun.
