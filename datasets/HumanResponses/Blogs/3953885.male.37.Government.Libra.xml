						   It's strange how one can wake up in a morning feeling that the day is going to be great, only to find that as each minute ticks, things slowly seem to get worse.&nbsp; Today is one of those days.&nbsp; Worse than just the average Monday feeling, I haven't felt any good until just now when I started to think about the days events.&nbsp; I guess when you reach a rock bottom, the only way is up, so I'm trying to think positive that come tomorrow things will all fit into perspective. &nbsp; Still not heard anything from Morrisons, although they should have received my letter last Friday.&nbsp; Not really sure what sort of response I'll get but it has to be better than the response I got from Customer Services last week.&nbsp; We'll see how it goes. &nbsp; Spoke to Rob, but felt too miserable to say much.&nbsp; Looks like an early night for me. &nbsp; &nbsp;

						   Awoke this morning to a text message from Rob, obviously sent before he went on his way to Alton Towers.&nbsp; Decided not to get up straightaway though, a mistake in itself as when I did get up I'd got a raging headache!&nbsp; Managed to get my car cleaned and dried just as it started to rain, ah well...at least it's looking better than it was.&nbsp; Btw, the text is a little bit too risque to publish on here, but it referred to the frolics of yesterday afternoon. *blushes*  &nbsp;  Got someone else coming to see the house later this afternoon...a first-time lady buyer apparently.&nbsp; Seems like the influx of Londoners coming into the sticks hasn't ceased as this is the fourth so far.&nbsp; I just find it weird really that there have been "so many" of them...mustn't complain though if they're interested in buying the place.  &nbsp;  Found out today that Helen is changing her car next week from the Corsa to a People Carrier type vehicle.&nbsp; Not sure what it is as yet, but I'll get to see it sooner or later!  &nbsp;  Dad is still in a mood over something or other.&nbsp; Does my head in.
