      Why should you worry about me and who I'm with? Why should it even matter if you don't like them? Do I tell you what to do? Who to date? Your biggest problem is that you're jealous. You hate it that I'm happy and I don't need you. I still love you, but now I have a different agenda. That really pisses you off, huh? Guess what? I don't care. You need to invest in a hobby. Read a book, write a poem, or draw a picture because my business is not your business. So get yourself some business and we'll be fine. And if any of this is misunderstood, then try reading a dictionary. HA!

      I remember waking up at 2 a.m. to a very uncomfortable pain. I wondered what was going on but didn't have to wonder for long. As I stumbled to get out of bed, I remember thinking about how young I was. I knew in my heart that I was not ready for you. Despite of all my negativity, I chose to keep you. I knew it was my responsibility to be there for you. Now at this time you needed me. At a time when you didn't ask to be conceived, you needed me. Without me, you wouldn't make it. And I soon came to see that, even with me, you wouldn't make it. When we arrived at the hospital, the nurses called our doctor and we were shipped to another hospital. Upon arrival there you made your first appearance, well your foot did anyway. I was so scared and all alone. The nurses did everything possible to make us comfortable. It worked, you got so comfortable it took you 36 hours and 16 minutes to appear completely. When you first arrived I didn't want to hold you because I knew you wouldn't be with me for long. You started to cry and I couldn't hold out any longer. So as I held you and looked into your tiny little face, I wondered why God would cheat me of your earthly existance? You struggled to breathe and I knew the time had come. There was nothing I could do to save your life. I was finally a mommy and now I was faced with losing my only child. As you took your last breath a piece of my soul died. How could God take you away from me is all I wondered. It wasn't until 6 years later that I finally got my answer. You were so perfect and so precious that he needed you to be with him. And now that you're 6 years old and up in heaven, I want you to take care of your little cousin. I guess God thought you needed a playmate, so now Dashawnia is up there with you. So you look out for her and make sure she waits for me and her mommy. For so long I endured the pain of losing my very first child, and now, I finally figured out how to talk to you and not be ashamed. Kisses!
