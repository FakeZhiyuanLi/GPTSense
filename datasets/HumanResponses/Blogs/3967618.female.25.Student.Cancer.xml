      A2 Art Fair has concluded and I am preparing to move about 8 blocks across Ypsi.  Goodbye to my overpriced yet beautiful Depot Town apartment, hello to EMU's student ghetto. What can I say? As an stifled artist, I am hoping that the noise, trash and abundance of fellow students will push me into a new creative space. HA!  Ignore the fact that my description makes it apparent that this 'awakening' will be much different than I expect--i.e. 2:30 a.m. travels across the street to tell neighbors to turn it down, and yet 2 hours later I'll be on my third beer.  O the romantic notions of the alienated writer!   Not to mention that I am a senior and this is my final hurrah until I become a 'real adult.'  It really bugs me when people say that, as if upon graduation I will simply begin my march toward death--listening to and lusting after Rod Stewart and wearing holiday themed sweatshirts year round.  I formally pledge that I will retain my wild eccentric side as I age-No better, I'll fall further into a wackyness that is oblivious to what others think (so that I have full licence to wear holiday themed sweatshirts year round).  No really, to hell with our youth-worshiping society, I can't wait to be a wise crone who doesn't give a shit.

      Is it not completely unnerving that JK won't let anyone really know what he is about?  Its all strategy, it seems, to use blanket statements like 'optimism' and 'respect abroad' to explain his views on the world.  The guy wants to keep us in Iraq and increase military funding, yet thinks he can foster respect for the U.S.?

      The Ypsi road work has been driving me crazy, but I found a pretty good shortcut today.  I got a scenic route through the neighborhood just past the high school.  Its really beautiful over there--lots of really old big trees and modest houses.  I think: wouldn't it be nice to teach at Ypsi High when I graduate next year and buy a funky house in that area.  But then it occurs to me that the kids I teach will find out where I live and egg my house.  Oh well, it adds excitement to life. I've also been enjoying riding my bike up Huron--man those houses are amazing.  The thing thats funny is in one block, it turns really scary.  The e-way does it, I think.

      Ok, I've wanted to do this for quite some time and now I'm there.  I'm not sure what my blog will look like, if there will be ads or if I will really like it, but here goes.

      "A Purpose Driven Life" by Rick Warren states: "You don't bring glory or pleasure to God by hiding your abilities or by trying to be someone else. You only bring him enjoyment by being you. Anytime you reject any part of yourself, you are rejecting God's wisdom...God says "You have no right to argue with your Creator.  You are merely a clay pot shaped by a potter. The clay doesn't ask, 'Why did you make me this way?' "

      More from "A Purpose Driven Life":  "Jesus said, "If people want to follow me, they must give up the things they want.  They must be willing to give up their lives daily to follow me."  Let me warn you: when you decide to live a totally surrendered life, that decision will be tested.  Sometimes it will mean doing inconvienient, unpopular, or seemingly impossible tasks. It will often mean doing the opposite of what you feel like doing."

      I need to formally apologize to my family for my political opinions, which have been so annoyingly vocalized over the last couple years.  Although no one has approached me personally, many of you have said that politics and pleasure don't mix.  In other words, I bring the stuff up when people are relaxing and want to forget the somber realities.  I can understand this, although I personally find such discussions enjoyable, and always try to make lots of room for diverse opinion.   Whatever the case may be, I am currently investigating the best means of channeling my idealism, which most likely will involve working with the Kerry campaign in this fall...

      i have been staying up much too late lately. Ha! The reason tonight: I left the new Portifino Cafe that has free Wi Fi and I got back to Raul's and I still had a connection, and had one since.  Exciting to me, it really is.  So I've been taking care of buisness cause the iBook has to go to the doctor tomorrow. Lets hope the logic board concerns are unfounded.  I bid on a cheap digicam tonight too. Its time I get one--I'll never make up my mind so I decided to go low scale and move up later.  Oh I'm hoping to make it to the Detroit Jazz Fest on Labor Day weekend, lets see if I can get it off work. A little more than 2 more weeks till school.  I'm excited and nervous about all that I am taking on.

      Check out the August version of Ann Arbor's "Current" for the full interview with Buddhist nun Robina Courtin, but I need to include my own favorite quotes:  Mark Ziemba: What was it about Buddhism that attracted you? VRC:  I had never looked at myself - I had never put myself together.  It's like having your hands tied behind your back and trying to do something useful ... At the most simple level, the more you're caught up with attachment and anger and fear ... the more limited you are in your capacity to even see others, much less help them...when you go beyond that ...then your capacity for compassion is limitless.  VRC: Buddha would say at the deepest level we are all - each of us individually and collectively - literally creators of our universe.  VRC:  We have this very extreme tendency to paint a person with one brush.  They do one bad action and we see the whole person as bad - we define them as bad.  We do that to each other all the time, and we do it to ourselves.  We do certain things that are wrong, so we walk around with self-hate and guilt...  ...The whole Buddhist approach is that we have to be more realistic in seeing ourselves, more humble in owning our negative qualities without feeling guilty, more brave to know we can change them and more optimistic about our good qualities, which will help us move toward them.

      This really good   urlLink article   details the pros and cons of Kerry's performance-based initiative that will reward good teachers, while disbanding current measures that protect bad teachers. While the plan is fraught with potential problems, I personally like the plan for many reasons, particularly because it offers monetary incentive for great teaching ($5,000 raise). This measure is breakthrough because according to Kerry, it begins 'paying teachers like the professionals they are." Unlike other professions, teachers are often not considered well-trained professionals that constantly learn and improve. Instead, tenure track teachers ease into comfort and lax methods. More on this later.

      Lately I keep getting that classic Freudian psychological model in my head: the iceberg of human consciousness, with what you are aware of above the water and what you are not aware of below the water. Of course, the real message for me is that the majority of the iceberg is below the water, meaning that much of your own personality is unconscious motives and issues. My own astrologically sign, Cancer, has much to do with this metaphor, in that a Cancer is strongly attuned to her emotional ups and downs, many of which she is not fully cognizant of. What bothers me about this model is that knowing myself seems so far out of my grasp, and even when I begin to touch on my character, it seems that this model has a way of disregarding my findings. As I do begin to realize my strengths and weaknesses, I laugh because a part of me willfully decides to deny these realizations. Why? I believe that a part of me has a (albeit false) vision for who I am, and anything that contradicts that is rejected. It makes one wonder how deeply one has been fooling oneself...OK, I'm starting to sound like Sybil, the multiple personality victim, but I really do think that this is fairly common. We aspire to certain ideals, visions of who we would like to be, and these visions are not always positive or feasible in relation to who we really are. That makes little sense, I guess.  I keep thinking of my Dad--one time he told me that when he finally accepted his strengths and weaknesses, he was much more on target with what he wanted to get done.  Yes it's intuitive, but hard to make happen!

       Last night I had a dream that a short-haired young woman took myself and a few others hostage!  She was violent and creepy, but I won't go into full detail of what she did.  I decided at one point to try to win her over by complementing her.  After that, she sent me this email that was multi-dimentional, it had flying objects and the strangest juxtopositioning of words.  Although I knew that this note meant that that she liked me, I had a chill as I realized that she was completely insane. I woke up after that.

       I wanted to give a shout out to my boyfriend Raul for helping me move this week, as well as for putting up with my bitching due to sleep deprivation. Man do I get crabby if I don't get at least 10 hours. Last night I think I got about 12 and I feel like a different person. I hope someday I will be more like other people who can sleep 8 and remain functional and happy. I would get so much more done. But I really would miss my many hours of dreams, which don't seem to happen when I cut the 12 hours short.   Raul also helped me through the stress of moving into an apartment that wasn't ready in a number of ways, most significant: the toilet won't flush and the carpet in the bedroom looks like 30 cats got trapped in there for 30 days without a litter box. I had talked to the landlord about ripping it out a long time ago and he agreed. So now all of my stuff is in the living room as I wait for this deal to happen. Raul reminded me that everything will be resolved and that some good will come out of it, as with any drama.

       I read a great article by Paul Krugman about the dangers of   urlLink touch screen voting,   and it is important to get the word out. Ironically it is the Republicans (Jeb Bush) who block an audit of the systems, yet are the same who benefit from their use. Krugman does a good job of stressing the integral importance that a paper trail has to the American people's faith in voting. It makes me so angry, reading a  urlLink  recent poll of African American voters   who admit a loss of faith in the system, which to a degree can be credited to the 2000 election. In that election, a group of African American voters were illegally disenfranchised, unable to vote because the system claimed they were felons. Turned out they weren't. It's just fucked up that the Republicans are now potentionally getting what they want--people are disgusted by the system, so they don't vote in 2004.   I haven't been blogging because I have been moving. I am finishing up my last load 2night. I am so happy to be online right now, typing on my pretty white iBook. I feel shallow. When did I become so addicted? Yeah, there were those 3 months when I was 19, when I chatted till 6 a.m. Hey, I was living with my parents. Then I reverted back to my classic self that tried to detest technology, buying tapes and resisting cell phones. My boyfriend had a computer that he brought with him when he moved in, and I jammed out on it to a minor extent.

       Since I am now in the process of establishing my own apartment after 2 years of living with my boyfriend, I have a new found interest in views on cohabitation, in particular how it affects women's mental health. I have always been pretty interested in this stuff, but was reminded when I was reading blurbs in   Cosmopolitan   while at my aunt's house. One blurb cited a study that 'proved' that women's mental suffered when cohabiting while men's thrived. The source was not cited. I've been browsing online and found a few weak sources including   urlLink this poll   which was conducted in the UK.      I am continuing research on this, but I realize there is a lot of ambiguity and confusion. When I cited the initial blurb to my boyfriend, he reacted defensively, which could be expected. I also told him about what I read in my women's lit class that dealt with women's mental health and marriage, and again he saw such literature as subtle man-hating. I can see his perspective. I also keep thinking about a study I read a few years ago about a rise in cohabitation in the U.S., which I recently looked up and found   urlLink interesting results  . While the reliability of this reading is up in the air, I like that it discusses the pros and cons, as well as the reasons people are choosing to live together more than ever. I have questioned my own motives a lot and have come down to financial reasons as one of the biggest motivating factors. More on this later.

       I forgot to thank my amazing mother Kay for her work in 'blitzing' my house--it is indeed her specialty. She provides moral support as well as hard labor in many moves throughout her family/friends. Not to mention her militant throw-away policy that helps pack rats in denial, like myself. Her common move-out quotes include: "Use it or Lose it," "This room is over-chotched" and "Burn 'em and buy more."    While on the topic of my mother, I just wanted to get this conversation in writing: We were discussing the now defunct Mudhouse building and I was explaining that the spot is a potential goldmine. My Mom got her creative juices running and started inventing names, her favorites being   Campy Campus Cafe   and   The Kat   (the later would include her huge collection of cat thchokeys). Also, she was brainstorming on a Broadway theme...I'll try to remember the menu names she came up with later.
