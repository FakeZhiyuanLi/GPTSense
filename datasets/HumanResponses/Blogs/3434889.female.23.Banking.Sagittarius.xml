       urlLink Im new to all of this  So today is another craploa day to the max times infinty. i am so mad at myself for not going back to work. its like some kind of paralysing fear comes over me and i cant face the idea of getting out of this house to go to work. its like i am afraid to leave the house - yet the money woes are creeping back again. damo is worrying about how we are going to pay our bills - i know i have some sick leave available - but not a lifetimes supply! how do other people get through this darkness ? i have done this before and always come out on top - but it just seems that each time i fall down that mountain again its a little bit harder to claw my way back up. its like i have this negative nagging going on in the back of my mind that wont let me do anything for myself. i walked out the house yesterday and started to cry - it got worse as i drove closer and closer to work. i hate knowing that something like this is happening to me and that i am not in control of anything. i need to get back to work though - its just the mornings are getting so hard. maybe i should do what nicole did last year and start working from 9-6 - i will ask rob today when he calls me - i will tell him the mornings are so hard and i need to  be able to come to work a bit later for a couple of weeks just while i get back in the swing of things. i dont think going part time is the answer. i think that will only create more problems and more time for me to sit around doing nothing wasting away. i need to get out of this house more! i need to join some kind of social club where i can meet people again - i have no-one except for my family, damo and louise and jai - and they are 4 hours away! i need some new people to have as friends - even if they are just people i see when im at this place. what should i do then ? well i was thinking netball would be a good idea - god i just got a bill for the shrink - $200 groan. it is so unreal the way that they charge for just sitting there - he didnt even help me! i got sent to him for no reason at all by my doctor and now he has the gall to ask me for $200. and i love the way that the date of the consult was over a month ago as in they have given you 'time' to pay - now they are demanding it. yet when you go to leave - they are like 'oh thats fine, its all taken care of' making you think you owe them nothing, like its all on medicaree. grrrr i hate this shit! why ME !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! raaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah

      Well its official - I suck. I suck big time, in fact if I was a vacuum cleaner I could very well be one of those crazy dyson models that has super suction and the ability to remove stains embedded deeply within the pile. Or perhaps one of those delicate little fish that clean the algae off the side of peoples fish tanks - you know the ones, they had one in Finding Nemo - and he was French.  Now that I have managed to get myself completely sidetracked lets examine today's mess that is my life. Maybe we should start off with the niceties like who I am, what I stand for and all that crap - maybe I should just lodge a disclaimer. My name is Erin and I am 22 years of age. I would tell you my last name but I don't trust you to keep it secret! I live in the audaciously auspicious town of Adelaide, in South Australia. Adelaide is known under many a moniker, affectionately entitled the city of churches by all the old geezers that live in Burnside and the like, or perhaps the festival state by those crazy cats down in the east end that sip on lattes and macchiattos all day long, discussing the innateness of the city within which we live. My favorite title of course is not so well know across the country - but is an affectionate indicator of the type of town we live in. And that name is the serial killer capital of Australia. That's right. South Australia has had more GRUESOME murders than anyone else! And god That's something to strive for isn't it! anyway. My favorite football team is Port Power - not that I really watch a lot of footy these days, and my favorite colour is purple. I am engaged to the love of my life, his name is Damien and he is my soulmate. We have a small modest 2 bedroom home in Largs Bay - which is about 30 minutes from City Centre and by the beach. We have a dog - a rhodesian ridgeback x and her name is Karma. She is nearly 2 and is a crazy crazy girl.  The other stuff I'm sure you will find out along the way - if you are so inclined. Anyway so today was supposed to be my first day back after two weeks leave from the hell hole that is my place of employment. I work in debt collection for one of the major banks. Now as you are already guessing I'm sure, its not exactly like working in happy happy land all the time - in fact if it were anything at all like happy happy land there would be serious cause for alarm. No it is more like working in hell than having a job in one of those boostin juicey bars - which I have amazingly also done! so I had two weeks off for reasons which shall remain undisclosed - okay okay, it was for stress. shock horror - no! Not stress in debt collection - however could that have happened I hear you all asking - I know I know - I'm weak! I'm also entitled. I'm entitled to speak up and say - you know what? Just because this is my job doesn't mean its who I am - and That's what was starting to happen to me. Yes I was turning into one really angry, stressed out - at times hyperventilating, default notice, and it all got a bit much. So I screamed the crazy scream and was promptly given two weeks off to 'get back on track'. So of course the two weeks was like a dream come true - absolutely the best time in the world. Who can complain about not having work for two whole weeks! Yeah I have this little side issue of stress and anxiety, but hey I got to stay home and watch jerry for two weeks! So what happens on the Friday before I go back - our fences fall down. Yes That's right - our fences fell down. you see we live on a lovely quiet little street. We all have older homes - with most being renovated or worked on. Most of the residents are homeowners who keep to themselves like us, or are elderly and kind like the lovely couple next door to us. Everyone knows each other and waves hello if they see them out and about and is at peace with everyone around them. then there are the lovely renters with the army of children, loud commodores and constant domestic arguments that decided to move in next door to us. oh gee lucky us. Not one family - but two! to make it even better - one of the daughters from one house has now shacked up with a bloke from the other house. So aside from the domestics disturbances at all hours of the day (imagine it: 'you f*ckin skank bitch you ruined my loife' 'yeah well you are nothin but an alco who is a wife basher' 'up yours' 'NO, UP YOURS' 'yeah well ill see you in court' and so on) we have the issue of sharing a fence which is - or should I say was - about 20 years old, about 4 foot too low and on a very scary angle.  Cut to 12 months ago when our lovely neighbour, Paul, decides to move onto a bigger house to support his growing army of children, dogs, bikes, trailers etc. sells the house next door. the place was quiet for a month - then it began. the renters came with their little dog that barks at all hours of the night that is not trained, registered - even wearing a collar. the dog decides he wants to make friends with our dog and starts running full pelt straight at our fence in the hope that through some strange turn of events the fence will cease to exist and he will reach the other side. well on Friday he did just that - the fence ceased to exist - well kind of anyway.  its all sorted now - at 1.46pm on monday arvo, but to cut a long story short a new fence was needed and now. So my darling Karma has been staying at my mother in laws house where she is no doubt being molested by their 10 year alsation regularaly and I now have a fencing contractor in the backyard putting up the new fence. wow, you must be thinking what a woman of substance and finesse to acheive so many results in so little time - I'm sorry to say I didnt. you see we ordered the fencing materials six months ago and have been trying to convince the neighbours that its kinda important to fix it sooner rather than later - only now with a massive hole in the fence did they realise that there might be a 'bit of a problem'. cut to Friday afternoon and me having an argument with the neighbours landlord who was choc-full of classic one-liners such as 'well its not my problem' and 'alrighty then' who finally agrees to send someone over from his building company (!) to put the fence up. We spent much of satday arvo pulling down the fence with no help from our gracious neighbours, and then spent the following day tearfully farewelling his sister (again-but ill get to that another day) who was leaving for london. so I cranked a sickie today - go on hurl your rotten fruit and stones at me - I deserve it. I was also out there this morning watching him do the string line that would determine where the fencing would be placed - just to make sure this didnt turn into some kind if land dispute! grrr paranoia! I promise, promise, promise to go back tomorrow - if I don't, then I think we'll have a serious problem!  so as you can see the moral of my first ever blog post is that I hate my neighbours, my job sux and that fences can be knocked down by small over-active staffordshire terriors.  I will leave you with a thought from the great Edgar Cayce - which has nothing to do with fencing and everything to do with what went wrong this morning - on my first day back when I cranked a sickie.  ' The mental is the builder. Hence the mental attitude has much to do with the physical conditions of the body, but it does not set broken bones, neither does it strengthen ligaments.... The attitude of the mind, if it is from spiritual forces and desires, will bring that which will build a life and an experience of peace, harmony and happiness.'                                                                                           - E. Cayce - 1934
