      Early in the morning (10 am) when I wake up and hardly have the capacitance to pour a bowl of cereal without getting any on the table, I have the wonderful chore of putting my contacts on. Now, imagine, something plastic and wet, that everything in the world will want to cling to it when you first open the contact case. I pick it up with one finger, get it to sit right, start to put it in. Low and behold, it hurts when I put it in, so I take it out, clean it again, try again. In the 20 seconds it takes to put in your eye, you spend about 1 minute recleaning the little bitch. Once you get them in, you can enjoy the rest of your day without a problem. Ha. NO. Remember how everything in the world wants to get stuck to your contact? Well, it can, and it will. Now when something gets in your eye it hurts twice as bad, which is very lovely when you don't have your cleaning solution or lens case anywhere near you. Thank goodness for these lovely little creations to help improve vision, what would we do without them.

       Well, there's one thing better about livejournal (emo-land) They have software to update. On this thing I actually have to go to blogger.com, log in, click the little new post thing, and THEN I get to write it. Could they have made it any harder? I don't think so.  Atleast they aren't password nazis like livejournal. That fucking place, FUCK.  I tried about 10 different passwords.  And a word that's a brand name it said is in the dictionary.  NO IT'S FUCKING NOT.  Livejournal...god I'm glad that's over.  Emo-land, I'm done with you.  Now that I have a blog, I can post more serious things, like this post.      While I'm on the topic of things that suck.  The game battlefield vietnam and thier latest "patch"  Oh god, it's so great.  It fixed all the things that weren't broken and added new.  Mobile spawns don't work, the wonderful sound of the nalpalm bomb repeating the entire time the first time one was dropped by you.  And the extra lag and worse performance, it's so fucking great, I love EA Games!      Hmm, that's about it.  Livejournal sucks, ea games sucks, I'm a cynical bastard.  Yep, bout covered my day so far.  Later      -Robert      01001111 01001101 01000110 01000111 00100000 01000010 01001001 01001110 01000001 01010010 01011001

      Yep yep, I'm posting on a blog.  I'm being forced against my will.  Well, first of all, my name is Robert, even though about 1-2 people are gonna be reading it.  urlLink http://www.bmxrenegades.com/images/random/meheadset.jpg  That's me, lighting was bad, my face isn't that grainy and colorful, really you have to believe me.  I'm so sexy in my headset. I ride small bicycles  urlLink http://www.bmxrenegades.com/images/riders/mexup.jpg  And snowmobile  urlLink http://www.bmxrenegades.com/images/random/1b.jpg   And uhh, yea. I'll post some more bullshit next time that you're not interested in next time I'm bored. Possibly in the next couple hours.  -Robert

      I just saw spiderman 2. Yes, just. It's only been out for a long time..bah. It was great, except the really cheesy part near the end..yaknow, she's like running through the park like, OMFG I'M SO HAPPY AND IT'S REALLY BRIGHT OUT. Other than that. I give it 4 and a half ZOMGZ out of 5.  I hope zomgz becomes the standard for movie ratings.

      Doom 3 is by far one of the most amazing games I have ever played in a lot of aspects.  The graphics are just stunning..gameplay is scary as hell.  (They even have a level called hell :), which I haven't gotten to yet)  Many a times I've yelled and jumped out of my seat because of this game.  And the atmosphere and noises alone will keep you on the edge.  This game stresses me out..seriously, I'm really tense while I play.  OMFG it is the best.  Anyway, here's some screenshots.   urlLink http://server6.uploadit.org/files/logen99999-wallwriting.JPG   urlLink http://homepage.ntlworld.com/matrix787/Doom3/Doom3%20(26).jpg   urlLink http://bmxrenegades.com/yabbse/attachments/8.jpg   urlLink http://bmxrenegades.com/yabbse/attachments/4.jpg   Best game ever.  Yes, this is all I have to talk about because this is all I've been doing lately.  Jeebus I need to go riding or something..or maybe I just need to play more doom and forget about all that..hmm...:)   I'm wierd.  (IE)

       Well, firstly, doom 3 is going to be the "besterest"(Â©2004 Shella) game ever. I'm about to get it, and when I do, I'm going to wait until one am, and turn off all the lights and close the shades and play. So I can freak out more than I should when a monster jumps out at me. yay! Another awesome game, Urban Terror, a mod for quake 3. It's like, quake 3, but counterstrikeorized. Awesome. I suck at it, I get about 1 kill for every 10 deaths. Wohoo.      Today my homie Chaos, in my Battlefield Vietnam clan, told me a story about pants on the roof. He said they were old and stinky, and had holes in them, so he threw them on the roof. And the neighbors were like, what is that guy doing. Yes, Chaos tells the best stories. He also sings a lot..which I can't say I always enjoy. He's ten years old. So pretty much, he's like a drunk ten year old.      Tommorow my friend Eric comes back from his mission. Ya know, church stuff. Two years without tv, radio, computers, or anything like that. Crazy. It'll be awesome to see him again, he's the guy who got me into computers in the first place. I was always at his house playin warcraft 2 and duke nukem 3d until I begged my parents enough to buy a computer. Now I'm bloggorcizing (writing in a blog, duh.)and making websites, and lots of other things that are mostly useless, but fun. :)      I should throw my pants on the roof when they get old.      ~Fin~
