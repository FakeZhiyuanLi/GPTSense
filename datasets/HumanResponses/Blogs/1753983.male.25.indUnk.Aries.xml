      hailed a cab ride in front of  urlLink ateneo  thursday night. turned out the driver was the chatty type.   driver: naga-aral ka ba dyan? borce: dehins no. dati,  di na ngayon, i thought.  driver: balita ko ambaba ng tuition dyan. borce: a oo. di hamak.  only about 36 thou per sem by the time i graduated. thank god for scholarships.   driver: bobo rin daw mga taga-dyan. borce: balita ko nga.  lalo na si ano, chaka si ano...  driver: pero mataas naman sweldo pagkapos. borce: di naman.  tingnan mo ko.   and on and on and on.   salamat sa kwento, brod, i said before getting off.   daldal talaga ng pinoy.

      i got complimented at  urlLink work  thursday.   a little backgrounder: my main duty here is to prepare the minutes of the weekly operations committee meeting. the opcom is made up of the president and ceo, four evp's, four svp's, and around ten vp's. at the start of each meeting, they review the minutes of the previous meeting for errors - in content, in grammar, etc. i've made five such minutes so far, and the third and fourth were approved without corrections.   after they finished reading my fifth, the president and ceo said: so far walang mali a. the corporate secretary - who was a lawyer and a senior vice-president - turned to me and said: your minutes are very good. i smiled a bit, and nodded thanks. it's really very good, she repeated.  now this was the same secretary who interviewed me twice for a separate position in her staff - the first was one-on-one, but for the second she was part of a panel of six - but chose someone else so i ended up in another department.  when i was transcribing the proceedings, i discovered that her second remark was caught on tape. so i kept playing that part over and over.   the bukol was suddenly forgotten.

      early thursday morning, i woke up and found myself on the floor. first time it has ever happened. and no, i wasn't drinking the night before.   i think i was so sleepy i didn't remember if i woke from a bad dream. and when i rose to climb back to bed the left calf cramped up. excruciating. shrugged it off and slept again.  the phone alarm woke me up at 5.30. big and painful bump on the back of the head. weirdly, i couldn't figure out what day or date it was. or if i had dinner the night before. even as late as that afternoon, i couldn't remember if i had taken a bath before going to work.  i was afraid i had a concussion, since my brain felt like it was buzzing. the temporary memory loss didn't help either. but since i didn't have any fainting spells or any other funny symptom the following days, i guess it was nothing.  it's been three days since. the bump's gone. but when i touch the spot it still hurts. i wonder if i need to see a doctor.

       urlLink ateneo lost yesterday.  buti naman. too much success could get in one's head. but losing to nu? cho-hoke, ubo, ubo.  don't get me wrong. i've always supported the team. i remember i was in grade school when the uaap still aired on rpn 9. i always cheered for ateneo, even during the winning drought (which included all of my stay in college). little did i know i'd go to two ateneos in the next eight years.  the point? nothing. just that blue and white have been my two favorite colors. ever since.

      about an hour after the bank rob at ground floor of my building yesterday, members of the makati s.w.a.t. went up to our office   (cue s.w.a.t theme. showing pa naman yun soon. funny.)   they said one of the robbers was able to escape the police cordon, and was hiding in the building somewhere.  since the main doors of the office were ordered closed minutes after the shoot-out, the s.w.a.t. team was sure the criminal wasn't inside the office. that led to a search of the comfort rooms. that made for a very funny incident as the ladies' room was occupied at the time.   when i went down to the lobby during quitting time, i saw some bullet holes on the marble walls. on the street, a barricade was set up. lima-singko yung yung pulis, yung mediamen, yung miron. sobrang karnabal. aliw.  highlight of the day, 25 august 2003: 5.20 pm, lana asanin exiting the hsbc building in her gym attire, 75%.

      at around 3.30 this afternoon my typing was interrupted by the sound of automatic gunfire.   being true-blue pinoys, all the employees left their cubicles and went to to see what the racket was about.   the view from the nearest window was not much. people scampering about on the street below us, other faces peering from the windows of the opposite chinabank building, a bank armored car, an armed rent-a-cop...  those who think they saw something were instant celebrities.   it seems the commotion came from our building, the citibank center. an attempted bank rob, they say. a maintenance crew said that the lady receptionists at the ground floor lobby are still crying, shaken by the experience of witnessing a shoot-out. some said the irritating security guard near the elevators got smacked.      i got tired of it after about fifteen minutes, but some officemates are still at the window. they say there are a lot of cops downstairs. and someone called that some windows at their office at the chinabank building now sport bullet holes.   sigh. isang na namang araw sa buhay ni tiborce.

      stepped out of the office thursday to buy some cigs, and got greeted by the sight of cut-up yellow pages littering paseo de roxas.   it looked liked i missed one hell of a confetti shower, since i was cooped up in the office the whole day. then i remembered.  'twas august 21, ninoy aquino’s death anniversary. the patriotic songs blaring from the corner of paseo and ayala should’ve been a clue.   wow, i thought. 20 years. i don’t think the country’s changed that much.    in the papers that day were stories about corruption, murder, violence and mayhem. same old, same old. it got me thinking, what does his life – or his death – mean?   couldn’t answer that myself. probably more dirt for the metro aides to sweep up?

      when i came back yesterday afternoon the lie backfired.   they didn't process the application, because i had no blue application form from the lto. was set to go to the lto, but a fellow applicant said i needed a birth certificate to get the lto form. ay pota. it was in the province.  so i had to come clean. i told the bir people i really needed the tin for work, that i needed it to sign the contract of service with my company. they had me fill up form 1902, but with it i have to submit a certificate of employment and my birth certificate. double pota.  problem is, the company can't give me the employment certificate because the contract (which i haven't seen, by the way) will say that there's no employer-employee relationship between us. triple pota.  rock and a hard place, sobra.  it made me realize i had no instinct for self-preservation. my parents work/ed for the government so i should've realized transacting business in a government office is a pain and a half. but i went and took this job in a gocc.  haaay. kebs.

      took tuesday afternoon off to process my tin application at the marikina bir. i needed one so bad, cause i haven't been paid a cent since i got this gig.   to hell with the rain, i said.  never mind that it was in marcos highway past sta. lucia, i thought.   i filled up a 1904 form and said i was applying for a student driver's permit. (truly dishonest, but a guy at the makati bir told me to say that.) was told to come back the next day. was done early, so i went to meet a coupla friends from up.   bwenas, di ba?

      many would be surprised to know that i’ve lived at the same boarding house since first year college.  it’s been seven years. and counting.   that makes me the most overstaying boarder here. it’s a wonder my landlady hasn’t given me a loyalty award.  strictly speaking, though, i haven’t stayed here that long. of course i went home to the province for vacations. and even during the times i'm in the metro, it has not been uncommon for me to disappear for days and not be seen at the boarding house. that’s because i have adoptive families (hi mark! hi jason! hi ate kay!) who let me crash their homes so often i should have part of my rent refunded and turned over to them instead.  (once my landlady said pina-blotter nila ako dahil antagal ko nang di umuuwi. up to now i'm not sure if she was kidding.)  i used to live here with toots, leo, mike, mao, pulpugs, alding, ronnie – classmates all since high school – who left after college to pursue careers, further education and shit.  ah, the hell we raised!  now i live with my brother and some undergrad kids. it’s fun (because i can get away with bossing them around) but I have to be sorta kinda responsible for them also. by default, i'm the surrogate older brother to perfect strangers.           admittedly, there are also a lot of other things to dislike about this place, foremost of which right now is that it’s too far from work. even if at the moment, i have no plans of moving out just yet. syempre eventually, i will have to.   (singhot, singhot.)

      last saturday was the ateneo-la salle game in araneta.   the boardmates went, because wonder of wonders, our landlady had a ticket source. i, meanwhile, had somewhere more important to go to. besides, the only available seats were in the nosebleed section. nah, i thought. am too old for that.   besides, tv had replays. and a new hot-babe-licking-her-fingers-clean commercial. yeba!  but for a self-proclaimed rabid atenista, i haven’t gone to many of those games. sure i follow the team on tv and in the papers, and i try to catch  the games when they’re at the nearby loyola gym, but ateneo-la salle live? mabibilang ko ata sa isang kamay.  must be because i'm such a pavlovian dog. ateneo teams during my four-year incarceration lost so much and so badly, that even now that they’re the defending champs i still half-expect them to choke in every game. and when it happens, sayang lang ang hapon mo. pawisan ka na, walang nang boses, nabiktima pa ng scalper. ansakit, p’re. insult to injury.   plus in every single one of those games i did attend, dick gordon relived his athletic past. ‘have a four-sizes-too-small babble jacket, will cheer at halftime,’ ganyan. not the prettiest of sights. another reason to stay home.  but don’t get me wrong. i was happy when they took the trophy last year. was ecstatic too when they won last saturday. and how did they do that? i offer a theory.  no dick.

      took a stupid test to know my past life. entertaining.  Your past life diagnosis:  I don't know how you feel about it, but you were male in your last earthly incarnation. You were born somewhere in the territory of modern Central Africa (aha!) around the year 1175. Your profession was that of a handicraftsman or mechanic.   Your brief psychological profile in your past life: Seeker of truth and wisdom. You could have seen your future lives. Others perceived you as an idealist - illuminating a path to future.   The lesson that your last past life brought to your present incarnation: Your lesson is the development and expansion of your mental consciousness. Find a good teacher and spend a good part of your time and energy on learning from his wisdom.

      it was during the first semester of my third year in up law that i went on a leave of absence. i wasn’t being kicked out mind you, but the desire wasn’t there anymore.   looking back though, i realized i entered not with the best of intentions. in fact, i had no intentions of going at all; i was set for a career in advertising.   but a couple of boardmates were taking the examination, so i went along. trip lang. and when i passed the written exam, i thought, why not go to the panel interview? trip lang. and when i passed that too, i thought, why not enroll? trip lang.   but the trip ended.   why did i leave?  it’s a combination of reasons, but para tipid sa laway i just say, ayoko lang. although puking my guts out before classes (look ma, there’s blood too!) was a vivid memory.   it got that bad. i wanted to quit. did. bummed around for a year. now i’m working.  now you ask, do i wish i didn’t leave?   nah, not really. but there’s someone i don’t get to see as much as i'd like.   the quitter tag, though? i’ll never live that down.   lalo na sa sarili ko.   postscript. my four boardmates are still at it: toots in unc law, pulpugs in arellano law, alder in san beda law, and ronnie in ateneo law. good luck, mga padimen.

      i work for a gocc whose offices are along paseo de roxas in makati.   i got this gig because of kat, a friend from up who knew an executive here who told her there was an opening in the office of the corporate secretary.   i got called for a panel(!) interview, so i went in my power get-up – blue long sleeves, budweiser-themed tie, black pants, black socks, black doc martens, lucky silver thumb ring.  long story short, i didn’t get that job. they wanted an enrolled law student, not a former one. the guy who got hired was a fifth-year evening student who was a formaer classmate in law for a couple of semesters.  fortunately, kat’s friend offered me a job in his department. it’s not permanent like the first, so half the salary. but since there was the chance of being regular after six months or so, and because i was bored from the one-year leave of absence from school, i said yes. with feeling.   since july 10, i’ve been part of the workaday world. and you know what i realized?  it’s not bad. not bad at all.

      thursday marked my fourth week at work. wow. how fast time flies.   this is my first job. interned for MTV Philippines before but that doesn't count; i didn't get paid. come to think of it, i haven't been paid at this job. yet. must be because i don't have a cedula and a tin.   eyng? first timer po, sorry.  always thought it was like this: go to work at 8, leave at 5, and fifteen days later they hand you an envelope with money in it. this is why you shouldn't get your education from movies. ideally.  it was only last week that the hr department told me i had to have those documents, and i'm assuming this is because i need to sign the contract of service with the company. my department head reviewed it last week.   so i pretended to go to the cr and went straight to the bir office a block away. got told by the guard i needed to submit a certificate of employment and a company id with the application form.  huh?   me to the b.i.r. guard: kaya nga kelangan ko ng tin e, para ma-finalize yung pag-hire sa 'kin. syempre ala pa kong certificate of employment. anlabo mo naman, tsip oo. kaya ala rin akong company id. building pass, meron. putik naman 'dong.        fortunately, i have a very supportive mother. hagalpak lang ng tawa inabot ko when i recounted everything.  sigh. with any luck i will be have the papers by next week. which means mai-ipon ang sweldo bago ko matanggap.  yeba.

      makati city has a smoking ban. so like my law-abiding officemates, i sneak off to the men's comfort room to light up. oh so 1995.  i am in cahoots with our office guard in this. before i go, i ask him if the building's roving guard has made his run already. if the answer is yes, it's a go.  the ban is not a joke. the makati mayor has deputized 25 or so senior citizens to help the police enforce it. they also have id's and stuff, and they are allowed to apprehend indiscreet smokers.   the penalty for the first offense is a thousand pesos. and if you cannot - or will not - pay, they can make you sweep a whole street instead. in your brand-new barong no less. they don't care how impeccably dressed you are.  so for someone like me who needs two-and-a-half days to earn that thousand, the comfort room cubicle is heaven. thank god ours are clean-looking and -smelling.  it's the end of the world as we know it.   on this page next week: a report on the viability of fire escape stairwells.

      we're right in the middle of the rainy season. and since i commute to and from work, it can be a real hassle at times.   like yesterday for example.  sumabit lang ako sa jeep kasi sobrang rush-hour punuan. then it rained. never thought that a 35 km/hour ride under the rain could be so much fun: the wind whistling in your ears, the water trickling from your hair to your neck to the inside of your clothes... pwe.   i must have looked stupid because i kept smiling.   i got seated eventually. fell asleep too, for about fifteen minutes. but when i went down the jeep, i realized my phone wasn't in my pocket. thank god for the red light i was able to get on the same jeep to search.  the other passengers looked curious as i looked under the seat, along the aisle, near their feet...  i gave up looking after a moment, resigned that while i was napping my phone fell from my pocket and someone who got off earlier that me was now the luck owner of a load-less, three-year old ren-ren ritualo phone (see 3210. see ren-ren. compare and contrast.)      twas then that i took a cigarette from a bag pocket to calm myself down. and there was my phone.

      i was told thursday that my transcripts of the opcom meetings were supposed to be typewritten. i'm still pissed off to no end.   i mean, it would not have been a problem had i been informed of this at the start of my engagement some two and a half months ago. the previous nine transcripts i've done have all been handwritten, and my super did not tell me at any time that they had to be typewritten.  it's not very easy to do these transcriptions.  on the average, the meetings are about two hours long, taking up three 45-minute sides of two 90-minute cassette tapes. and it takes me one day to finish one 45-minute side, so i do not go out saturday and sunday to finish the transcriptions before coming to work monday mornings. i leave you to imagine the amount of body ache that routine brings.  at the moment i worry less about the added work than the possibility that i won't be free to take a new job right after my three-month contract ends on october 10. i suppose it would be required that i submit the typewritten stuff before they release me.   a friend said i got set up, but i guess i'm also partly to blame because i didn't ask if i was doing things correctly. i simply assumed that i was, since my super did not tell me otherwise.   i see an out, however: my contract does not specifically require that i produce typewritten transcripts.  sigh. i think this is my welcome to the workaday world. or, more precisely, my rude awakening.

      got complimented by j on the title of this blog last saturday. he also commented that unlike  urlLink his , my blog was introspective.  i replied that my object in this blogging exercise is to get back to the level of writing i had when i was a college freshman. and honestly, introspective is a word i can comfortably describe myself with.  from high school till first year college, i'd like to think that i wrote passably well. but since then i've hardly written anything except school papers. i can't pinpoint why i stopped, only that i did. and it turned out to be one of my biggest mistakes.  now i'm trying to recover the old magic, as it were. because for me, writing is something i can't do well if i don't keep doing it. how far i've progressed so far, only my readers can tell.

        last saturday night i ended my two-month, one-week alcohol boycott.  previous to that, my last taste of alcohol was july 15, at mark's father's birthday party. that night i had a freak accident while opening a bottle of beer. the lip broke off, and i cut the first knuckle on my right middle finger.  oh, i cut myself, i declared. i ran off into the house, tracking blood all over, to wash my hand at the kitchen sink. it was a weird feeling. i felt the blood gushing out in spurts, spurts, spurts. then i suddenly felt dizzy. last thing i remembered was asking j to get me a chair.  when i woke up, i was being propped up by friends. i was all wet, too. i later learned that i fainted, and that camille, who was standing right behind me at the time, had to catch me. poor girl. friends brought me to the capitol medical center to have my wound stitched up. the doctor shot me full of anesthetics, but it wasn't nearly enough to numb the sting of being sewed up. and my friends were kind enough to pay the medical bill.  since i could not help bending the knuckle, it took a few weeks for the wound to fully heal. and since then, i haven't had a drop of alcohol.  that was why my first beer saturday night was gone in 60 seconds. after a long dry spell, nothing tasted better.

      i have body parts i can't even properly name which hurt. a lot.  i went with officemates this afternoon to the bsp cafetorium to participate in the mass calisthenics. we were a sight - all in company-issue superman-blue shirts, blue and white balloons, banner, the works. and we were late.  i quickly learned that 'calisthenics' was a misnomer; i had gotten myself into an aerobics class, complete with an instructor. hot damn!  pero napasubo na, so...   the first 15 minutes i wasn't really participating. i was having too much fun making fun of the other participants. but after a while i noticed that i was the only one who was doing it half-assed. i looked more foolish than those who were really into it. and the old ladies and the fat guys were doing it better! so i thought, might as well, right? i'll show them, i said.  an hour later i was barely staving off fainting. my last athletic activity was sometime last may, and i was paying for it. right then and there i decided to quit smoking.   there was a raffle after, but i did not win anything. in the end, the free cheeseburger mcdo meal, the free mineral water, the time off from work, they were not worth it.   but at least i got to keep the superman-blue shirt.

      friday was 'left field comments day.'  yesterday morning, i had to have something announced over the pa system. while i was writing the announcement down, the cute, late-twenties (unreliable estimate) switchboard operator said, 'si sir, laging naka-smile.' so i grinned at her. wide.    and then yesterday afternoon, i had to submit some stuff to this evp, the same one i wrote about in my 9 august post. the conversation went a little something like this:  evp: you didn't enroll, ano? me: no, sir. evp: how do you know alvin? (name has been changed to protect the innocent.) me: sir, he was a former classmate in law school. evp: why did you leave, burnout? me: something like that, sir. evp: anong year ka na ba dapat? me: 4th year, sir. i left when i was in third year. evp: so enroll in  urlLink ateneo law . time is of the essence. me: thank you for the advice, sir. evp: ituloy mo. time is of the essence. di ka tataas.  huh?

      one of the hazards of being the newbie at work is that you are sometimes volunteered to participate in tiresome activities.   the 103rd civil service anniversary will be celebrated next week, and like other government agencies, the  urlLink company  has to send participants to some of the activities lined up. a memo was issued asking each department to send at least three people to attend either the calisthenics activity or the mass.     i got volunteered, so on monday afternoon i would be part of the contingent that will go to the bsp in roxas boulevard to participate in the calisthenics. i need to be in calisthenics attire, whatever that means.   honestly, a fitness buff i am not. the last time i got involved in a similar activity was gymnastics class in high school. which was tolerable enough since we were taught assorted rolls, head stands and hand stands. in short, we got trained for future careers as stuntmen in the movies.   calisthenics, meanwhile, bring back memories of grade school - hands upward-forward-sideward-down in all-white outfits to the beat of a drum. it was my luck that i was always the tallest, so i had to lead the exercises. that meant being in front, for all the studentry to follow.  the activity was ridiculous then. it is even more ridiculous now. imagine a thousand old geezers clad in gym attire making like third-grade pupils. not a pretty sight.  this time i plan to stay at the back. waaay back. and when they ask us to do any taebo routine, i promise to surreptitiously slip out.

      the opcom meeting was scheduled at 8.30 am today. since i wanted to be at work much earlier than that, i set my alarm at 5 am and slept early. good.  yep, you guessed it. woke at 6. the alarm didn't wake me! muttering choice unprintables the whole time, i got out of the house at 6.15. bad.  but miracle of miracles, traffic was light for a friday. marikina to makati in 48 minutes, a new world record. i was in the office at 7.03. good.  after entering some last-minute corrections and printing the minutes on scratch paper, i gave it to the xerox guy at 8 am. 9 pages, 18 copies, i said. good.  i went up to the 4th floor to give paging instructions to the switchboard operator. but when i got back to the 3rd floor the xerox guy wasn't there. worse, he photocopied the wrong sides! more unprintables. bad.   i had to re-xerox. luckily he left it on 'collate/sort.' i can't imagine what i would've done had he not. good.  i then rushed to the company's new offices at the 17th floor of the next building. finished setting up the mikes, the casette recorders, what-have-you. exactly 8 am. good.  but some officers were nowhere to be found! up until 9.15 i was still running about, tracking them down. the meeting was almost cancelled due to lack of quorum. and i had to brave questions from some irate evps who were getting impatient. baaad.  in the end the meeting pushed through. and since there were few present, it was over in 45 minutes. which means i only have to transcribe one tape side. gooood.  for the first time in weeks, i own my weekend. wahooo!

      i found myself a high school english literature textbook in the room i was assigned to during the acet. and i read through it to amuse myself while administering the test.  the book was part of the GEMS series, which i remember using when i was a high school freshman at the  urlLink ateneo de naga . my classmates then would be familiar with the book, as our teacher for the subject where it was used as the main text was the then-ms. grace nobleza.   she's mrs. nobleza-rubio now, married and with kids. but those days most of our class had a crush on her, poor pre-teens-stuck-in-an-all-boys-school that we were. she was one of the teachers na napaiyak namin: naipit ang kamay sa pinto, after which she ran to the cr then came back teary-eyed, cutting the period short with a "let's pray the our father for our last meeting" spiel and a walk-out.           but i digress.   the book i rediscovered earlier today contained selected works from the greatest authors, both local and foreign. shakespeare was represented, as well as lord byron, manley-hopkins, nvm gonzales, nick joaquin... in short, the usual gang of un-idiots. my favorite 'standard' pieces were in there. my first favorite writers, too.   so i happily read the book from cover to cover. and i got transported to that happily innocent time when i first got hooked to literature. highlight of my day.

      because i was acet examiner, i wasn't able to go to dlsu today to cheer for some up law friends who were taking the bar exams.   but when i was there last sunday, suffice it to say that taft was a virtual karnabal. i won't paint the picture here, as a  urlLink bar examinee friend describes the organized chaos better  than i can.   to me, it all felt so... curious.   had my law school experiment continued, i would have been a senior now, about to take next year's bar. but i quit during my third year, so i saw last sunday from a different perspective. as i watched the contingents of law schools from all over the country cheer their hearts out for their barristers, as i watched the examinees put on their most hopeful faces as they marched off to their testing rooms, i felt... nothing.  as i said, curious.  i stood there amidst all the people, but i couldn't see myself being there for any other reason except to support my friends, couldn't picture myself making that walk to take the bar. i didn't feel envious of the examinees, i didn't feel regret for leaving law school.   wait. scratch that. i felt something pala.   that i made the right decision.

      for the first time in years,  urlLink ateneo swept both elimination round games versus dlsu.   missed yesterday's game because of the acet thing. fortunately my friend car was watching, and she was kind enough to give me score updates.  i was then lounging in the admissions headquarters after administering the test when some lady's friend called in the final score.   and the place erupted with joy. no kid.

      was in ateneo today and yesterday for the 4th annual tiburcio: master acet examiner weekend.  making the trip up the hill has become a sort of ritual for me come september. i'd like to think i'm giving back to the alma mater in my own small way. the free food has got nothing to do with it, i swear.   yeah, right.  i was signed for four sessions, and they were boring as hell. except for yesterday morning's session, when a kid in my room got nosebleeds. because of the heat, maybe. or the test's difficulty. kebs.  good thing i was assigned two talkative undergrad gurls as proctors. at least dehins napanis laway ko.  one annoying thing i observed, though, was that the kids had difficulty following even the simplest of instructions.   i ask them to pass the orange answer sheet. they pass the red one. i tell them that when passing forward, they had to put their paper on top. they don't. anlakas naman ng pagkasabi ko. grrr. patience, tiborce, patience. deep breathly. inhale... exhale...  also, unlike my boardmate, i didn't get to see maxene magalona. she took the test at the grade school, while unlucky me was assigned at the high school. drat.

      it's monday again. damn. where did my weekend go?   ah, i remember.   saturday morning and most of saturday afternoon was spent sleeping and playing diablo 2.   latter part of saturday afternoon i went to robinson's metro east to help buy items for friends who are taking the bar. spent the night in century park sheraton but didn't get to sleep because i had to transcribe stuff for work.   sunday was spent shuttling from the hotel to the bar site in dlsu to powerplant to up.   i got home at 11 pm. slept until 5 am. now am at work.   tired and sleepy do not even begin to describe me.

      as you can see, i like taking stupid tests. sometimes the results are hilarious. here's one:   your destiny is to be a Provider.   as a Provider, you have a genuine nurturing concern for the welfare of others and you're eager to serve them. You can recognize exactly what people need and your friendly, helpful, social nature makes them feel comforted. with your kind and generous heart, you are personable, talkative, and outward with your emotions, and your openness and sensitivity makes you concerned about the way others view you.   along these lines, be careful not to blame yourself when things go wrong. you cannot prevent bad things from happening, even though your tendency to be orderly with a strong sense of right and wrong may lead you to believe you can. accept that you do what you can to take care of things and that this will get you far in the world.

       urlLink ateneo won the battle of katipunan.    it was surprising that up kept it close, because they look like a team capable of losing all their games. especially if they keep giving the ball to their rookie marvin cruz. sorry kid. the junior's division this ain't.  as for ateneo, the next immediate goal is at least a top-two finish in the eliminations to get a twice-to-beat incentive in the next round.  sumaya na naman ang loyola.

      early yesterday morning i psyched myself up by listening to the album of ateneo cheers released earlier this year.   it's a nice album - the first few tracks were of the blue babble, but the next ones were reinterpretations of the cheers from atenista musicians like chito miranda of parokya ni edgar, ciudad, and the itchyworms.   da pulis' version of 'halikinu' and  urlLink marc abaya and kjwan's 'fabilioh'  are personal favorites. the former is all silly fun while the latter is simple pero rock.   and oh, remind me to kill rico blanco for murdering the song for mary in the last track.

      played ball at the makati ymca with some officemates. i haven't played since 2002 so the whole day i was very excited.  a little backgrounder: i've  never  played any form of organized ball at any level. in fact, only started playing when i was a college freshman. that's something. in basketball-crazy philippines, to be male and not know how to play is simply unacceptable.   in short, i've never developed the needed skills. i'm not adept at dribbling and shooting(except when i'm right underneath the basket). my vertical leap is an amazing twelve inches (when i'm not full).   but you can't teach - or learn - height. that's the only thing i have going for me. being 5'11 1/2'' (6' flat when shoe-clad), most of the time i will get the rebound or the block if i extend my arms and jump a bit. needless to say, i also rarely get blocked the few times i attempt to shoot.   now back to the main story. i acquitted myself well tonight, notwithstanding my long lay-off. my shots - all of them undergoal stabs - kept falling. i made about nine, missing only four (two from the three-point area, two from ten feet away). i had a lot of rebounds, a couple of steals and three blocks.  now the first of those three was a thing of beauty, if i may say so myself. an officemate drove for a lay-up, but the ball went whap! (a sound that can either be sweet or sickening - depending on whether you're the blocker or the blockee (?) - or both.) as the ball landed out of bounds, i yelled, ' saan ka pupunta! ' at the poor guy. cheering and jeering ensued.   i had embarrassing moments too. got hit twice in the face, because i couldn't handle my teammates' passes. each time everyone laughed at me. i just smiled back. after the game i jokingly asked if it was normal that my body didn't hurt but my face did. that cracked them up.        but i earned some props. come monday i have bragging rights. and i can't wait for next friday.

      right after the game, i was on my way to a cubao bus terminal. was planning on meeting up with j in baguio for the ad congress.   was on my way to the buendia mrt station when my ate texted. she is sick at the moment, so i bought her medicine and stuff. she lives alone at her apartment now, so i passed up on the trip just so she has someone with her in case she needed anything.  at the mrt station, i was counting my loose change as i approached the 'stored value tickets only' window. the teller saw me doing this, and i must have looked either poor or illiterate to him because he tapped the 'stored value tickets only' sign taped to the glass and then jerked his thumb to indicate the 'exact change only' window next to his.   nagpanting ang tenga ko. 'tang inang 'to, a. ano'ng 'kala mo sa 'kin?    being the educated and well-bred atenean that i am, i reached into my pocket and peeled off some  really large bills  in his face. i took one then slammed it down the counter before pushing it through the slot.   the guy wouldn't look me straight in the eye as he gave me my change and my ticket. i was wishing he would, because i wanted to mouth a crisp 'fuck you!' at him.  sure, i could've done with a little more class; i admit i was being a jerk. but these things really outrage me.    hindi porke barya lang ang pera ng tao  automatic second-class citizen  na s'ya. puta.

      the plan last night was simple enough: be in san agustin church in intramuros at 8, watch a friend sing.  it turned out to be anything but.   storm + payday friday + j.i.l. rally near luneta = hell. diliman to intramuros in close to three hours, aaargh!   did nothing except nap and listen to the radio. i haven't tuned in to a.m. for such a long stretch since i was a schoolboy in short blue shorts.  arrived an hour late for the concert, so we caught just the tail-end of my friend's performance. she was great, as usual. i've lost track of how may times i've seen her perform, but i still get goose bumps every time. felt so proud when she got such an ovation.  got lost going to malate so dinner came late. had to drop by the u.p. infirmary on the way home since my friend's mom wasn't feeling too well. watched bulletproof monk - a surprisingly enjoyable movie. no crouching tiger, but still...  all in all, a fun enough evening.

      1. the philippine philharmonic orchestra experience is a-m-a-zing. what they say about kids and candy stores apply.  2. it would be fun to conduct, even as an amateur ala-robert fulghum. however, one has to be physically fit.  3. the coolest dude in the orchestra was the bass drummer with the edgar mortiz-body type. (i can relate. i played a bass drum in a drum and bugle corps while in high school. nagiba balikat ko. up to now i have bad posture.) he's just sitting down most of the time, rising only for a few weak bom-bom-boms. but in the passages that quicken your heartbeat and raise your spirit, he's in the thick of things with his boom-boom-boom-BOOM-BOOM-booms.  4. next coolest dudes were the cello and double bass players. one can't help but respect people who play instruments taller - and fatter - than they are.  5. the san agustin church is lovely. aside from a museum, there's a courtyard inside, complete with palm trees, lights and a fountain. too bad we didn't stay long to explore.              6. the accordion is responsible for the weepy il postino-ish soundtrack of european films.  7. it’s disconcerting to share a pew with a foreigner who's so into the music he enters a trance and starts shaking.  8. it's sad when the standing ovation consists of two just guys.    9. the lady in the lime-green gown who gave sampaguita garlands to performers was cute.   10. an encore, one should not repeat a piece already performed.  11. a gorgeous woman loses her allure when she's caught adjusting a wedgie.    12. it's hard to stand on one leg, two backpacks strapped in front, an umbrella and a tripod wedged between thigh and chest, to tie one's shoelaces.   13. mingling with so many kastilaloys afterwards, i now know how rizal must have felt like while in europe. disgusted at the smell.

      it's not advisable to play jeopardy until three a.m. when you have to be up for work at five-thirty.  it's not advisable to rely on your body clock; waking up at five for ten straight days does not guarantee such on the eleventh day.     it is advisable to use your cellphone's alarm clock. just make sure the phone does not run out of battery while you're setting the alarm. and that there's a charger always in sight.  you have been warned.

      caused a mild commotion at work today.  i called an officemate to let them know i wasn't going to work, and to remind her that another officemate was supposed to give her something.  she asked why i was absent; i told her that in protest, i will not come to work unless i get my overdue salary.  after a few minutes, my cellphone rang: the boss, calling to ask if i was really going to boycott work. apparently, my officemate told him what i told her. i explained that i was just kidding.    the boss then informed me that he has spoken with the svp for admin/hr. he was told they would fasttrack the processing of my salary today. i would probably get it early next week. he also told me to call my officemate again to explain that i was just joking. this officemate was emotional, so i should not be making such cracks.   i called up my officemate again. i could hear the commotion in the background. apparently she had told everyone in the department.   sigh. me and my big mouth.

      there's a cute picture of the chief justice on the front page of the inquirer today. he has a santa smile going on. understandable, as the supreme court trashed the impeachment complaint against him.  were i to choose a new  lolo , i'd pick him.

      everyone at the office calls me by my given name, as i've told no one there my nickname. they pronounce it correctly, too: le-yo, not lee-yow.  i got that name because my parents watched one episode too many of flor de luna, an old tv drama airing on channel 9 the year i was born. in it the late great dindo fernando played a policeman (i'm not very sure, i wa very young) named, you guessed it, and since my male parental unit was a policeman too...  among my friends, camille is the only one i've allowed to call me that. even as early as college i've tried to convince her to use my nickname but she couldn't be persuaded.   i used to not prefer being called by my given name. but now i'm starting to re-like it. it's as good a name as any, better than most. and it's mine.

      you are challenging, and have the guts. but you don't like changes in your life. and once you make a decision, you keep it that way for a long time.  your love life is also challenging, and different.   tee-hee.

      until the all soul's break of two weeks past a guy i knew has never gone home to bicol since november 2002. that's an interval of more than 11 months, a mere 24 days short of a full year.   i see the question on your face.    basic cowardice, that's why.   he was the first offspring, first grandchild, first to go to and graduate from one of the best universities, first to go to law school... in short, it was understood - though it may have been unspoken - that the family was pinning its hopes on him.   but ever since he made the decision to leave law school, he's been reluctant - hell, ashamed - to face the family. he's sure they were (are?) hurt. he's sure they were (are?) disappointed. and he just didn't have the guts to show himself.    last july the guy got a job. the work's incommensurate with his education, and he has not been paid yet, but at least he's starting to do something worthwhile with his life. he regained some measure of self-respect.   the prodigal son returned. he was welcomed.

      i was watching  the scorpion king  the morning of november two when a man came carrying half a sack of rice. my father had earlier had some palay milled for me to bring back to manila that same night, and this guy was delivering it.  my mother told me to mind our two dogs so the guy won't get bit. so i did. the guy was able to put down the sack, then he walked away. i went back inside.  suddenly i heard a yelp of pain.  oh, shit!    i rushed over and had my initial fear confirmed: one of our dogs gave chase and bit the guy's in the right lower leg. there were two bite wounds, and some blood trickling down.  i led the guy to the nearest faucet so he can wash his wounds with soap and water. to his credit he was very relaxed, as if he only got bit by a mosquito, although he was in a hurry to get home.   the guy left after i put a leash on the guilty dog. so i went back to my movie.  strangely, i haven't thought of the incident since. but now i'm suddenly wondering if the guy's okay now, or if the dog gave him rabies.   i feel a pang of guilt.

      we got in at the ground floor, and somehow both of us forgot to push the button for our floors.  looking back, i must have been deep in thought at the time (people who know me have an idea how oblivious i can get when i'm in the zone). plus i was packing: laptop bag slung across one shoulder, projector bag across the other, five-pound expandable envelope and tapa king styro in both hands.   point being, i had an excuse for not remembering to push the button. the other guy didn't; he was just plain stupid.  was speeding through floors 6 and 7 before i realized -10 - that i have not indicated - 13, 14 - my floor. and so i smiled at - 16 - myself.   other guy:  'wag mong pagtatawanan ang hindi mo kilala.   me:  eyng?  elevator stops at the 18th floor. maintenance dude walks in, and promptly pushes 'g.' stupid guy follows the leader.   elevator opens at the 10th floor.    other guy (before making what he thought was a john wayne exit, or what passes for one in the case of short, fat, sakang people):  me napapatay dahil dyan.  elevator door closes.  me and the maintenace dude (to each other):  eyng?   i see you, father nick. and you're going, 'what is the leit motif?'

      friends pitied me when they learned that i will be travelling on christmas eve. but i turned down invites because unlike last year, i wanted to be home on christmas day.  the terminal was surprisingly deserted that night. there were only a few of us stubborn enough to welcome christmas in transit. my bus wasn't even full. at midnight, i said 'merry christmas!' fairly aloud. then promptly went back to sleep.   a younger brother didn't make it in time for christmas day, but with his arrival this morning, my family will be complete to start the new year.   thank god for small blessings.

        my friend car got married yesterday afternoon. i didn't make it to the church; getting a cab in the metro these days is a goddamn labor of hercules.   at the reception, i told her that since i didn't see nor hear any i do's, she wasn't married yet as far as i was concerned. she laughed. she looked very happy last night. and glowing. i guess i'll wait for the wedding video to see what i missed.  as usual, our table looked like we had the most fun there.  urlLink our pictures  would attest to that. and seeing everybody all dressed up was nice. we all looked so... grown.   just for car i wore a  barong . people saw what i would've looked like as a lawyer.  not too shabby. spiffy, even.

        last night was katski's well-attended birthday bash, which became another reunion for our old comm block.   i was able to touch base with friends i haven't seen in a while, like reggie who came as eminem, complete with the tattoos and the blond 'do. there was drinking, there was dancing, and there was card playing. just like college.  and since katski was a writer for the recently-concluded abs-cbn  telenovela   urlLink kay tagal kang hinintay , some  artistas  from the soap came. i recognized lorna tolentino, ricky davao, jean garcia, and john lloyd cruz. last year bea alonzo was present, as were rica peralejo and rafael rosell (who played a character katski named after me).   everyone pretended not to ogle.

      am back at the office. me and a couple of officemates are passing the night here. we came from a videoke joint somewhere in boni avenue.  i took the stage earlier tonight. i had no choice as everyone at our table sang. so i did 'is it okay if i call you mine?' and 'shape of my heart.'   a g.r.o. sat beside me midway through the first song, but she didn't distract me. i went down to a smattering of applause all around. not just from my table, mind you.   that made up for the debacle that was our christmas party number. somewhat.

      the entire department had lunch at gerry's grill today. boss' treat. copious amounts of fried crablets,  inihaw na pusit, sisig  and crispy  pata  were consumed. but we assuaged our consciences by ordering  pinakbet .  it turned out to be a three-hour lunch break. and when we got back to the office, festival hams were being given away. a regular circus.  it's that time of year again. there's a lot of partying, eating and drinking in store during the next few days.  i grow tired - and fat - just thinking of it.

      we just got back from a get-together for our friend car, who's getting married on the 23rd.  the party was supposed to be a bridal shower, but it turned coed somewhere along the way. ergo, there was no male stripper. i think some of the girls were a little disappointed, he he he.   now car will be the first in my immediate circle of friends to get married. this came as a surprise. no one had pegged her as the one who'll go first. but we're very happy for her, seeing that she's genuinely happy. too bad they will settle in san francisco. i'll miss that girl.  the party was well-attended. j, syd, domi, mark, mark, marc, rina, rheena, jamie, camille, mia and katski went. with all the Comm people present, the conversation was hilarious. there were lots to eat and drink, but i tee-totaled. and oh, someone brought an industrial-strength videoke machine. towards the end, there was a really nasty icing fight.   i still smell the mocha on me.

        seattle supersonic ray allen, on the the significance of his triple-double - 22 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists - in a 96-82 loss to the los angeles lakers earlier today:   'we didn't win. it would have been great to celebrate if we had won the game,' he said. 'it's like a ship passing in the night. you just see it and it goes.'  unexpected poetry. which is the best kind.

        last night was mark and syd's combined  urlLink birthday party  (i initially typed  joint party , but that would've been a misnomer).   actually neither guy was born january 17. mark (third from left) was born january 22. syd (third from right) was born january 12.  i think they compromised and picked a middle date.   the two booked a room at the linden suites in ortigas. food and drinks were smuggled in. about twenty people showed up.    getting them to the room was a production in itself. see, hotel parties are banned at the linden. when asked, the people had to say they were going to monsoon, a bar located in the same building.  wala namang nakatunog .   the party broke up at about 3 a.m. the birthday boys and i stayed in until mid-day.   we learned that the adjoining rooms were luckily unoccupied. we made a lot noise, and had someone reported the ruckus, who knows what would've happened. kicked out, probably. or made to pay a bigger amount.    such a fun party. but will they top it next year?

      for the first time since october, i came in late for work.   traffic  sa  mrt,  grabe . no kid.  something must have happened along the southbound line. normally the trains make 30-second stops at each station, but yesterday we made 3-minute stops. one could see the next train idling (?) behind on the tracks, waiting for its turn to load and unload. our driver kept on apologizing for the delays.   'pag minamalas ka nga naman, oo.   being late is usually not that big a deal for me. but to be late the day after your vp comes out with a memo extending your current contract...

      according to a news bulletin i heard last night, gayuma - a homey little eating place along abada near ateneo - burned down yesterday.    i haven't verified it yet, though. the inq7 website didn't carry that item today. and i'm too lazy to go there to see for myself.   it would be sad if it were true. i dined there a number of times the past year. affordable beer. good food, too. nice ambiance...   did i mention they had affordable beer?

      last night somebody threw a rock at our bus. it went straight through the window and hit a little girl. fortunately the curtain absorbed most of the impact. to her credit the girl, did not cry. maybe she was in shock.  it took a few seconds before the driver realized what had happened. by then we had traveled at least half a kilometer from where the perpetrator was. no chance of apprehension.  people stood to shake off glass shards in their hair, inside their clothes, on their baggages. everyone got wakened.   good thing there was a roll of packaging tape on board. a piece of cardboard made for a crude mcgyver-type bandage.  i was in college the last time something like that happened. they didn't cover the hole. so for the rest of the trip - every time we hit a bump or a pothole - the glass cracked and shattered.  why is it that something always seem to happen on buses i ride?

      when i don't feel like passing through cubao to get to marikina, i take a shuttle behind the dbp bulding along buendia. i end up paying 15 pesos more than my regular fare, but i cut 30 minutes off my travel time. aircon  pa .   i never realized some of these shuttles were colorum. they're all over makati, for one. and two, i never took note of their license plates. i go in, sleep, pay my fare, get off at marikina riverbanks and that's it.    but last wednesday  may nakatabi kaming de -motor  na  mmda enforcer at a stop light somewhere along kalayaan avenue. the officer probably got suspicious; the van was full, and its plates were green. it didn't look like were carpooling. so he pulled the vehicle over.  for a long while the officer conferred with the driver. then he announced that we passengers had to get off. he wanted to bring in the driver and the vehicle.   naturally we protested.  mahirap sumakay dito , we said.  sa marikina pa uwi namin, tsip .   the officer relented after a protracted argument. but first he gave the driver a citation and confiscated the front license plate. then he let us go.  the driver kept cursing his luck for the rest of the trip.  na-tsambahan ako , he lamented. apparently the mmda officer was already on his way home. and he didn't accept a 1,000-peso bribe.   the driver's luck turned, however. a few minutes before i got off his mobile phone rang. the person on other end was looking for a service vehicle. the driver eagerly accepted, perhaps forgetting - or not minding - that his vehicle was missing its front license plate.   pambayad multa , he said after the call. there was a hint of a smile in his voice.

      the pc at home ate up the document i had worked on from tuesday night until early wednesday morning. i hadn't written a draft on paper, so i had to start from scratch.   finally got to work at 4 p.m. pissed, tired, hungry, and sleepy. i had this "don't cross me, i'm having a bad day" look. but someone ignored the warning. too bad for her.   i was feeling homicidal so i decided to avoid the mrt crowd and just take a shuttle home. but we got delayed.  hinuli ng  mmda (more on this in another post).      by that time i was feeling so  malas . so i decided to catch  urlLink chasing liberty .  alas, even  she  failed to lift my spirits.  got home around 11. but despite receiving a happy thought i still couldn't sleep! tossed and turned in bed for a long while before i finally gave up.   i rose, cooked some rice and heated some master's fried sardines.   that cheered me up.

        this drunkard braved valentine's eve/payday friday traffic to catch robin padilla headline  astig , an experimental digital film from indie filmmaker jon red. j had seen the movie tuesday night at the ccp, and he texted that it would next be shown at the  pelikula at lipunan film fest  friday evening.       now, i would've liked to be able to write that i beat the traffic going to sm mega mall from marikina. but i didn't. add my dead phone to the mix, and the result was a frantic camille contemplating gruesome scenarios why i was very late for the movie.    but i digress.  i had read about the film a few days earlier. apparently padilla doubled as a cameraman while portraying his astigmatic assassin bien. that got me curious. who woulda thunk 'robin padilla' and 'indie filmmaking' would ever be used in the same sentence?  i was pleasantly surprised that he did not embarrass himself. but then again, since he was onscreen only about three times, he had little opportunity to do so. i'll concede that he was a passable narrator, though.  his supporting cast was a veritable who's who of the local entertainment industry: albert martinez, francis m, jeffrey quizon, alessandra de rossi (with the not-so-faint lip fuzz), the ever-superb ronnie lazaro, shiny-top jaime fabregas, nonie buencamino, the irrepressible duo maverick and ariel, regular banshee jackie castillejo, token  coño  china cojuangco, and the overexposed tado.  and given that i was at least thirty-five minutes late,  sulit na rin 'yung sitenta'y singko .

      the mrt driver liked operating the train's p.a. system this morning.  he announced arrival at each station. he requested passengers to make way for those going in and out of the train. he warned against pickpockets. all these in a perky, sing-songy voice no less.  and just as the doors were about to open at the buendia station he announced, "sa mga pasahero, mag-ingat lamang po sa paglabas at pagpasok sa tren. sa mga kababaihan, mag-ingat lamang po kahit saan, kahit kailan."  couldn't help but chuckle.

      today my faith in the government was restored somewhat.  that's because i received the excess withholding tax, that was uh, withheld from my salaries over the past few months.  this reminds me of the days in college when the school refunded the laboratory breakage fees from the previous semester.    you always  knew  it was lab breakage day. everyone was smiling. the lines in front of the treasurer's office never thinned. and more importantly, the drinking places got crowded.

      the department was assigned to lead the weekly flag ceremonies earlier today - something i haven't done in a while.   since high school i think the only times i've sung the national anthem were just before last full shows in movie theaters.   given that i'm the most junior here, i got tasked to lead the prayer. sure, i said, but my former law student self kept screaming, "establishment of religion! establishment of religion!" in my ears.   i recited st. ignatius' "prayer for generosity," which i think is the second-best prayer ever made, bar none.  " ganda 'nung  prayer  mo a. nagdadasal ka pala? wala sa mukha ," my officemates kept commenting afterwards.     pwiset .

      was standing during the mrt ride thursday night. suddenly a shadow fell over me. i yanked my head back and found this  tall  dude standing behind me.   affronted, i threw my shoulders back and put my chin up. but from our reflections in the glass window, i barely reached the dude's ear! and he was  slouching !  i felt  puny . so i slowly edged away from him.   he got off the train before me, bowing low just so he wouldn't bump his head going out.   i smiled at the sight, glad for  my  turn to make people feel puny.

      just to see if it turns out to be accurate, i look at my horoscope at the end of a day.  tsumamba kanina :  "aries (march 21 to april 19) --  you're tempted to spend money impulsively today. you just can't resist a good time  or possibly buying something for children."  the  barkada  is gimmicking somewhere in ortigas tonight. kampai!

          i don't think this was the super bowl XXXVIII halftime show they had in mind.  'the decision to have a costume reveal at the end of my halftime show performance was made after final rehearsals," jackson later said in a statement. '(the organizers were) completely unaware of it. it was not my intention that it go as far as it did.'  yeah, right.  at maputi din ako .  it was said in one daily that the red, lacey thingy was supposed to keep her covered. good thing she had the foresight to paste on that spiky little thingy.

      must have been so deep in thought about something on my way out of the building yesterday that i stepped out of the elevator a floor too early. nearly bumped into the girl who entered the lift.   wait a minute, this isn't my floor,  i realized with a jolt one moment later. so i took three steps backwards.  "ground?" the girl asked. i turned. there was a smile in her voice and on her lips.  i smiled back. "yes, please," i managed to mumble. i'm sure i blushed then.

      went to robinson's galleria last night to meet up with my favorite  kulot  and the two mark's.   i've been to galleria only twice before, so naturally i got lost and couldn't find them. it didn't help that mark sucks at giving directions. and that my phone died on me.  argh!   that was just the first of a series of small catastrophes.  was craving for  palabok , so we went to jollibee. turned out that they were fresh out of shrimps.  aargh!    later i bought a  pinipig  crunch to cheer myself up. but as soon as i removed the wrapper a big chunk broke off and fell to the floor. i was left holding only the stick.  aaargh!    but things got better after that.  first we met a very cute lady at the  urlLink ahead tutorial & review  branch when we inquired about openings for part-time tutors. her name was bunny, and she was a u.p. graduate.  napatid ako sa pilikmata n'ya, grabe .  then a couple of hours later we were sang along like drunken fools to a guns and roses compilation album while in search of tanduay and coke along west avenue.  saya!

      the driver of the jeepney i caught late friday night had his son with him. i don't see this often.   at first i silently castigated the father for having his son of about nine out on the road at such an ungodly hour. then i remembered that the following day was not a school day. and that spending time with your kid is never a bad idea.  the boy tried to made himself useful. he took fares and gave out change. he shortchanged me a peso, but i didn't mind. he also gave a lady the wrong change but she was honest enough to send back the excess. as the barker he wasn't of much help, either. his pre-pubescent voice didn't carry far. and the whole trip the boy kept turning to his father, as if seeking constant reassurance that he was doing right.  i have a theory that at some every boy is brought to his father's workplace. in this kid's case it was an ambulant four-wheeled platform. in mine it was the provincial headquarters of the integrated national police in camarines sur.  the ritual is time-honored, and it has its purposes. to introduce a son to his father's profession. to make him feel proud of it.  maybe even (subtly) influence him to follow in father's footsteps.  but in my case, the conditioning didn't work. time will tell if it will in this boy's.

      'today ateneo, tomorrow the world.' this was our block's graduation slogan in 2000.   it seems tomorrow has arrived.  to take one example, a blockmate was honored in the recent vice president's awards for service and excellence at the ateneo. mhir delos santos, now the director of the office of student activities at the loyola schools, was cited as 'most outstanding individual in a supporting role.'  the citation sounds famas-like, but an award is an award. and knowing mhir, it's well-deserved. congratulations!

      the citibank center conducted a fire drill at 4:30 today. good thing my office is only at the 3rd floor because we had to use the fire exits.  traffic along paseo was heavy when i got down. traffic enforcers and  security guards blocked off villar street. and some of them had 'fire drill ongoing' placards.  it was almost realistic. smoke came from a third floor ledge. a fire truck arrived, sirens ablaze, and sprayed water for a few seconds. an ambulance also came.  then there was a rappelling exhibition. last came some dude who slid down two ropes, all the while strapped to a stretcher. the crowd lapped it up.    what happened next all but dashed the organizers' hopes of reassuring building occupants of their readiness in case of a real fire. right in the middle of villar, they put gasoline in a metal container and lit it. then they asked a few people from the crowd to put out the fire using fire extinguishers.   to their embarrassment, about four of the fire extinguisher canisters they brought out leaked.   that was what i kept thinking of as i later jostled with the crowds before the elevators.

        heard a good deal of buzz about  urlLink  love actually   so i decided to catch it before it ended its theatrical run here.   i have a few observations.   bad teeth, wit, funny accents and dry humor - very enjoyable combination. i nearly popped a carotid from laughing.  secondly, it was cute how they recycled the trashy theme from  four weddings and a funeral  (come to think of it, recycling is exactly what they do to rubbish).   the nod to the earlier film doesn't end there. there are (three?) weddings and a funeral that take place in the course of the story. and if that was not an inside joke, i don't know what is.     thirdly, it's a little off that this gets shown not during christmas (not even during valentine's week, fer chrissakes!) but on the  second  week of march.  but it doesn't matter; it's still a fun flick, something people can put across 'favorite movie' in slumbooks.   and lastly, the poster said somewhere in this movie people would find the love of their lives.   i guess there's still truth in advertising.

      when the tried and tested little tricks - counting sheep, exercise, glass of milk, roundhouse kick to the chin - don't work and i can't sleep nights, i have a secret weapon:    dream awake of dreaming asleep get a 9 mm empty tha clip    it's a nonsense rhyme that i recite over and over in my mind. a prayer. or a mantra, if you will. it works like a charm; i'm usually asleep before the 15th repetition.  then  very  early today i received what could possibly be another one:    endless. the sight of the sea is endless blue to blue.    that was just the first stanza. the whole thing's a bit harder to memorize. a tad sad. very patriotic.  will see if it works.

      woke up around 2 today. tossed and turned a while before finally giving up trying to sleep. i looked around. nothing moved, except the electric fan.  went to the balcony and mummified myself with my blue flannel blanket. the cold was bone-deep.  wrote a bit; some stuff for work, some for the spirit. one may yet end up here.   read a book, too. a title even older than i am, schwarzenegger's 1977 autobiography  arnold: the education of a bodybuilder . but mostly i gawked at the pretty pictures. this dude was  built !    of course back then he had a more angular face. and his nose was a separate continent. oh well. what a few hundred thousand dollars worth of surgery can't do.  stirred reluctantly when it was time to go to work. wanted to stay in. the sun felt good. a good start.

      hung out with my favorite  kulot  the other day. she was in the ayala area for a job interview, walking around with a map of makati and an industrial-strength umbrella.  first we lunched with  urlLink yayie  at the enterprise. after that we dropped by 6750 to holler at  urlLink jason , who was in the midst of yet another meeting. then on a whim, we decided to catch a movie in megamall.  at the mrt station, a grandmother-daughter-granddaughter trio was also waiting for a ride. when the train arrived, the grandmother got in behind us. but the doors closed before daughter and granddaughter could follow, or she could go back off.  worse, the daughter had their tickets. " hihintayin ko kayo sa  cubao," the grandmother said as the train pulled away. her companions could only look on helplessly. since we got off at the ortigas station, we didn't know what happened to them. i hope it turned out okay.  we went in at powerbooks. and promptly ran into her dad. such a small place the metro is. he didn't go with us to the movie, though.  on the way to the cinema we noticed a crowd milling about someone playing a honky-tonk tune on a for-sale piano. we went in for a closer look.  an old man was at the piano, and he was putting on a delightful performance. his umbrella and shopping bag were under the piano. i spotted a boy clapping and bouncing merrily in his stroller.   the old man was smiling throughout, acknowledging the appreciative looks of the crowd. when he finished his piece there was applause all around. the old man responded with a wider smile and graceful bows.  after the movie, we joined another crowd, this one watching the philippine army band in concert. such a sight - men in uniform playing musical instruments! and they played rousing, if loud, marching marches and some popular oldies.  later we met up with her dad (who had gone shopping for discovery channel vcd's). we went to the japanese restaurant their family frequents (the waiters' "long time no see, ma'am. welcome back!" were a clue). before long her older sister joined us.  after our meal we went our separate ways. but i had managed to wrangle an invite to the next time they go shooting. which is in two weeks, i think.  yehey!   much later, the  kulot  texted that her dad said that i was  mabait .  {blush}, i texted back.

        we ended up watching  lost in translation , a film written and directed by sofia coppola.  the story is about two americans who become friends after meeting in a bar in their tokyo hotel. one is a movie star (bill murray) shooting a commercial for a local whiskey, the other a young married woman (scarlett johansson) always left behind by her husband. and as the two explore the foreign city they get to know each other more.  it's easy to like the movie. murray's performance was superb. he had the funniest scenes. but for me, johansson made the bigger splash. god, such a refreshing presence! of course, it didn't hurt that she looked oh-so pretty in pink.   also, the cinematography was good. the soundtrack was wonderful, if eclectic. the  urlLink official website  kicks ass, too.   however, what makes a movie good is more than just the summation of its good parts. the movie didn't translate well with me.  personally, i don't think it should've won an oscar award for best original screenplay. but i'm reserving final judgment until i've seen the other nominees.

      finally got around to disposing of the assorted papers i accumulated in my almost-five years in law school.  since i left, they've sat collecting dust in a corner of my room. i don't know why i've kept them. maybe unconsciously i've been expecting that i'd return. or maybe i'm just a pack rat.  it took me the whole of yesterday afternoon to finish. i couldn't help re-reading a few papers, especially the in-class conversations with seatmates dotting the margins like:   --  astig porma ni  sir  a  --  oo nga, terno hanggang medyas  --  go- golf  ata pagkatapos   --  pusta ako na susunod na tatawagin  --  labas ka, kunyari iihi    my trick sinus didn't help, either.  'di na nga pala 'ko singkit ; my eyeballs are all bugged out from sneezing.  in the end everything went: photocopies of cases, articles, reviewers, case digests, sample exams, notes, blue books, various forms... upon stacking, the boxes i filled reached up to my armpits. damn, i've killed a forest!  i thought of burning it all. but due to environment considerations, i've decided to sell the lot to the next  bote-dyaryo-garapa  dude who comes along. i'd be happy to recoup even just a fraction of the sum i spent.

      on our way to dinner last night, my friends and i chanced upon a  urlLink booksale  outlet in glorietta 2. of course we couldn't resist.   camille walked out with  anna karenina , syd a book on architecture, and mark  airframe . i bought john madden's  one size doesn't fit all (and other thoughts from the road)  for Php45 and a PhP5 book titled  bridge for bright beginners  (will see if  bridge  bridge is as fun as the bastardized version i cut class to play back in college).  jason didn't get anything, although he reserved a  huge  book of shakespeare's entire works (i wonder if he has already returned for it like he promised to).  incidentally, a couple of hours earlier i discovered - right after syd and i finished our photo shoot with a ferrari formula 1 car [drool] - that there was a  urlLink books for less  outlet along valero street. very near my building. wahooo!  now the writing's on the wall: the world is conspiring to empty my wallet.

        our holy week outing in mindoro was dubbed the  buhay-baboy bookworms adventure . we had such a blast! but for me, personally, we got off on the wrong foot.   see, in our desire to get on the first available trip from the batangas port to calapan, we booked ourselves on a boat named  our lady of fatima . when i saw it pull in i said a quick prayer. the boat was a tub with a roof! i've been on scary boats before (when i travelled from bicol to koronadal, south cotabato some years back) but this boat was something else. it was barely seaworthy! it should've been named  our lady of perpetual help  or something.  saint jude  would've fit, too.  only my seatmate syd had an idea how apprehensive i was. we were seated right in front of a huge airconditioning unit yet i was sweating cold bullets. i kept looking around, searching for the nearest life vests. though i was very tired, i did not dare sleep. for a whole hour my heart was stuck in my throat.   when the boat docked in calapan i stood up immediately, intending to be the first off that tub. syd asked why i was in such a hurry. 'this is where i get off,' i said. just being inside that enclosed space made me nauseous. when i got down i almost kissed the ground. i was that happy to be on land!   whew! never again will i take for granted how good it is to have solid earth beneath my feet.

        went over to the  kulot's  house after work yesterday. when she asked what movie i wanted to watch, i promptly picked out  the transformers: the movie . 'i knew it,' she said.  after a few minutes her sister arrived and joined us in front of the tv. during dinner, i shovelled food into my cheek because i couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. that's how much i was engrossed.  i've forgotten how many times i've watched the movie but i still got teary-eyed when optimus prime died.  tsk tsk . a twenty-five year old so affected by his favorite robot dying. imagine how that scene rocked my life when i was ten.  later we tuned in to  urlLink american idol . i don't get it, frankly. i've seen two episodes now but i don't see why everyone's raving about it. but at least the two fil-ams acquitted themselves well in last night's episode.  i left when the program ended, and apparently at the right time, too.   they were going to watch  urlLink for love or money 2 .

      saw iza calzado and jomari yllana at the shaw mrt station yesterday. the two were promoting their  urlLink  te amo maging sino ka man   soap on gma 7.    she was very pretty in person, and she looked like she was having fun signing autographs and posing for pictures with the fans. i instantly forgave her for that bleagh! shampoo tv commercial.  he, however, looked ill at ease. considering how the people openly gawked at them from below their dais, i guess he had every reason to feel uncomfortable.  a fish in a bowl, that's what they say.

      i'm ten days into this vacation, and the 'rents haven't kicked me out yet, wahoo!  a few updates: the vote-buying candidate has been elected mayor; i've rented 17 films; the los angeles lakers have advanced to the western conference finals; and  dindo  dropped by sunday night and stayed until monday.   this last one was a bitch, especially since the electricity was cut off for a few days. thank god the house survived and the family slept through the worst of it. can't say the same for our banana trees, though (i know, i know, they aren't really  trees ). my father planted new ones this morning.  i'm not afraid of typhoons anymore. in my experience, nothing can top  sisang  in 1989. that bugger blew off the roof above me and brought down my uncle's house next door, but my father and i stayed. the rest of the family had earlier evacuated to a stronger house.   so while  dindo  raged outside, i read  harry potter and the order of the phoenix  by candlelight.  saya!

      on the bus to bicol last night, i got this text message:   kaibigan, gma-fpj na lang ang laban. maaring magaling ang ibang kandidato subalit isa lamang ang makakatalo sa hunyango. huwag sayangin ang boto!   from the  hunyango  (chameleon) reference, am presuming this came from an fpj supporter. it's a pity i had no energy last night to argue the point. gma-fpj my foot.  i arrived around 5:30 this morning, and by 6:15 the house was buzzing. a mayoral candidate, the sister of the incumbent mayor, sent six envelopes, one for each registered voter in our house. each envelope had PhP200 in it.   i recommended taking the money but not voting for the candidate. there's no way they'll know. my mother, a local government employee, was of the same mind. she was sure it was taken from the city's coffers. it was the people's money, so the people should have it.  but in the end, it was my father who had the last say. a retired police officer, he was offended that an offer was even  made  to him and his family. he was worried what people would think since my mother is a government employee, so he had the money returned. just like what he did with the envelopes that came during the last elections.

      am currently at  urlLink coffeeheads , which a college blockmate co-owns. it's right across ateneo.   the place looks promising, even if i'm not a coffee person (i get a buzz from nescafe 3-in-1). there's cheap internet access, and they lend books for free. the music's  matino , too.  i see myself hanging out here a lot in the future. i may yet learn to drink coffee.

        the little boy is the nephew of friends. the not-so-little boy is me.   a couple of sundays ago the little boy was in town. his  tito  took him to see  urlLink planes . i tagged along.  the three of us drove to a hangar beside the domestic airport. we inspected planes and helicopters parked inside. we watched planes take off and land. simple stuff, really. but loads of fun for boys of all ages.  am thinking of being a pilot.

      a few minutes ago the detroit pistons routed the los angeles lakers 100-87 to win the nba finals 4-1. like every laker fan i'm disappointed. but clearly the better  team  won here. how did they do it? let me count the ways:  1.  teamwork.  starters rasheed wallace, ben wallace, rip hamilton, tayshaun prince and chauncey billups were equally awesome. relievers like lindsey hunter and elden campbell also put in some quality minutes.  2.  defense . in their four losses the lakers managed a measly 77.5 points per game. in their only win they scored 99 points. the pistons, meanwhile, averaged 90.8 points per game.   3.  hunger . the lakers had experience. they knew how to win championships. but being the kings of the hill, they were a bit complacent. the pistons wanted it more. that desire was evident on both ends of the court.   4.  inconsistency . shaquille o'neal and kobe bryant showed up to play. but the rest of the lakers didn't. gary payton, devean george, derek fisher and stanislav medvedenko simply sucked. the thinness of the laker bench was exposed. expect drastic roster revamps in the off-season.    5.  injury . karl malone was one of the few lakers who played defense. he guarded tim duncan, the 2003 mvp, in the western conference semifinals. he guarded kevin garnett, the 2004 mvp, in the conference finals. when he re-injured his knee early in the nba finals, he became a liability. he'll be retiring without a championship.  6.  coaching . larry brown out-coached phil jackson. he was able to rally his players in crucial stretches of the series, especially after that tragic game 2 overtime loss. he knew how to build up his troops' confidence. the pistons weren't intimidated at all by the big, bad lakers in this series. their coach had a lot to do with it.             long story short, lakers lose. sigh. better luck next year.

      two nights ago i told jason that i've stopped smoking because of the  urlLink linkin park  song "breaking the habit" (key lyrics:  i don't know how i got this way/ i know it's not alright/ so i'm breaking the habit/ i'm breaking the habit/ tonight ). pathetic, he said.     yesterday, however, he pulled off a summoning charm worthy of emma watson and scored a pair of front-row tickets to linkin park's concert at the cultural center of the philippines open grounds last night.   i'm not really a linkin fan;  tsibog sila sa   urlLink slipknot   o kaya sa   urlLink korn . but the tickets were free so...  there were  a lot  of people, most of them under twenty years old. they knew all the songs,  grabe !  kami  chorus  lang, minsan di pa tama yung   lyrics. but nobody minded. or heard. we left the slam-dancing to the kids, though. and the flashing to the brave lady out in front.   the band sure knows how to make a shout-along chorus. after ninety minutes and eighteen songs, our ears were ringing. a baptism of melodic noise it was.

      i've been in the metro since last thursday; i have to find work! this time around maybe the hunt's going to be easier since i've set my non-negotiables:  1. workplace near marikina, i.e.  not in makati  2. call time not earlier than 9 a.m. 3. no dress code  but first things first. last night bianca's  urlLink coffeeheads  had its formal opening. our musician friend toto played, so j, camille, syd and i went. there was no beer, so we migrated later in the evening. we ended up closing down katip's (sheepish smile).

      went with my boardmates to araneta coliseum yesterday for the ateneo-la salle game. we made do with nosebleed section tickets since everything else was sold out, but it was worth it:  urlLink ateneo won !    la salle led by 15 in the third quarter and 9 entering the fourth, but the hail mary squad eked out a three-point win. i cheered myself so hoarse that a few hours later i still had no voice. what a great game. history was made.    i gave sid two tickets, but he showed up wearing green (even though he went to ust for college). we couldn't sit in the same section without risking bodily harm to either of us, so we trash-texted. but i had the last laugh.

      was in araneta coliseum sunday for the much-awaited ateneo-feu match. i almost popped a vein!  the blue eagles led by 14 at halftime, but the tamaraws, led by reigning mvp arwind santos and denok miranda, dropped a big run in the third to tie the game. good thing la tenorio came through ( again ) with that dagger three that broke a 62-all deadlock. props goes to chris tiu (who got cheered  and  jeered every time his master facial cleanser commercial was shown on the coliseum monitor) who preserved the  urlLink win  with a couple of free throws.  i ran into an old friend at the game. the two of us were classmates in second year, then boardmates and co-cat officers during our third and fourth years at the ateneo de naga high school. haven't seen much of each other since. it was nice to have been able to catch up on things.

      this blog turned a year old today. a small achievement.  in the past twelve months i made a couple of changes, the most drastic of which was the name change from   counting down to five   to   take me drunk i'm home  . the color scheme and the site features also changed as i learned how to tweak lines of code. i'm pretty much content with how it looks now, even if it's just the original template.  in my  urlLink first post  i expected three things. the first two i've fulfilled. the verdict on the last one i leave to  you .

      ateneo  urlLink won  over nu earlier today to up its record to 6-0, something that hasn't happened since 1988.  so far the eagles have not missed the services of larry fonacier. that could change, though, when they face feu on sunday. i will try to get a closer seat, but i'll hold on to the general admission ticket i have now just in case. the admu-feu match-up is one of the most-awaited this season, being a rematch of last season's best-of-three championship series which the tamaraws won in two games. i expect that the araneta coliseum will be packed.

      i found an online copy of neil gaiman's  urlLink  snow, glass, apples     and e-mailed it to my new officemates. one who read it said she'll never look at snow white the same way again. mission accomplished!  way back in college, i learned that the fairy tales we are familiar with are actually sanitized versions. the originals were fairly gory. a version of cinderella that i read had the two stepsisters lopping off their toes just so their feet would fit in the glass slipper.  i've never been into fairy tales, but the bloody versions are much cooler.

      we had tickets for the much-awaited ateneo-adamson game yesterday. i passed, though. the game was at the philsports arena and i had yet to sleep.  i set my alarm for 4 p.m., but that didn't work. i woke up just in time to catch the final play of the game, an la tenorio step-back three with 4.3 seconds left that  urlLink won  the game for the eagles. ateneo is now 5-0!  i noticed there's a '14' patch on each ateneo jersey now, in memory of injured co-captain larry fonacier who's out for the season. his mother was at the game, and she cried because the crowd was chanting 'larry! larry!' while the school song was being sung. touching stuff, really.
