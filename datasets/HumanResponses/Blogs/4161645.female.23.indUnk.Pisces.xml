						       Tell me why...      ...in this day and era, we are at the same point we were standing at two thousand years ago?    Tell me why, when a courageous journalist/writer who is dying of breast cancer, dares to publish her thoughts on the Islamic world-conquest ideals, she immediately is subjected to death threats?    And please tell me why synagogues in France are being burned down, and Jewish graves desecrated all over Europe- what is the excuse?    Explain to me, why the PLO would not accept land that was handed to it on a golden platter more than once since 1948. Clarify, for I can not comprehend the reasoning of these terroristic minds.    Is it justifiable to train a ten year old child in the arts of blowing one self up in the name of allah (I deliberately skip capitalization), as an act of protest for Arafat not getting what he wanted, when it has been given to him more than once?    Billions of Muslims world wide, and all they can focus on is a stretch of land smaller than the state of New Jersey.    I read general forums based in New York City. In this melting pot of a city, erudite posters speak of Jews ruling the media, the movies, the government. Are we sure that Hitler is dead?    How big is Israel? How many Jews, in total, populate earth?    Yes. Exactly, professor.    So why all the hatred?    Jealousy.    Oh, yes, that must be it.    I now call this meeting to order.

						          1.    *Coffee vs. tea         How many times have you been told to abandon coffee in favor of a warm cup of tea? The apparent delicacy of tisanes frequently leads us to believe that the caffeine ingredient contained in a tea brew is barely noticeable, and that it is shrinkable under the beneficial effects of a cuppa.    Wrong! Coffee naturally contains more caffeine than tea; however, the compounds contained in tea may have a stronger effect. Surprising? Here's why.    Chemically speaking, caffeine is an alkaloid. While coffee is based on caffeine, tea also contains a slightly different compound that seems to have a stronger effect. The presence of another alkaloid in tea explains why this sometimes has a stronger kick than coffee, while coffee seems more lasting for mental alertness and offers fewer jitters than the others do.    Technically speaking, let's analyze the various alkaloids.    Caffeine sources: Coffee, tea, cola nuts, mate, guarana. Effects: stimulant of central nervous system, cardiac muscle, and respiratory system, diuretic delays fatigue. Theophylline source: Tea. Effects: cardiac stimulant, smooth muscle relaxant, diuretic, and vasodilator. Theobromine sources: Principle alkaloid of the cocoa bean, cola nuts and Tea.    Feel better? I honestly experienced a major mood boost after researching these facts. I was finally able to confront those who criticized my coffee addiction with a smug, know-it-all look. Try it at home!    2. * Pros and cons of coffee intake     Smile. It's not as bad as you were told. Health warnings have contributed to the decrease of caffeine intake in some countries. Nonetheless, research proves that while coffee and caffeine have been linked to many illnesses, it is difficult to find definitive correlation to these.    Caffeine dependence and addiction are common, but trials showing coffee's association with cardiac attacks and coronary disease have many confounding variables. And, contrary to popular belief, at present there is no convincing evidence that caffeine or coffee consumption increases the risk for any solid tumor.    What a relief, huh?

						          Misunderstandings Further spited by differences    Black and White fall apart Avoiding the consequences.    True colors show In harrowing sequence    No Attempts are made to sew the rends of a fellowship so meaningless.       ...Pride and Power self- centeredness and all it brings.    And like a wilted flower    we come to the end of things.

						          Ignorance of a modern age Three hundred megabytes storing memories Of Hi-Tech figures at their first stage Pressured into the vast sea.    Cold knowledge and feelings of power nothing else to gain.    A satellite culture That changes constantly, nothing remains.    And Mozart lays forgotten in an unreachable concert hall Without electric guitars he bears no attraction the young will not come to call.    They are deaf to Beethoven’s Fifth that thunders in stormy passion    They rave and wave at the futuristic music or at the most recent fashion    Love for historical sites is rare Internet surpasses all by light years    And Monet sits in a museum’s care Staring jealously at Van Gogh’s suicidal tears.

						       ( published on bootsnall.com. February 2003)             As an Italian working in an English-speaking school smack in the center of things (to be more precise - Starometska Namesti- Old-Town Square), I set out with typical Roman zeal, ready to observe, criticize, research and occasionally, forgive. The first thing I tore into was clothes! The shapeless garments displayed in Czech boutiques were enough to give me a vast idea of what was to come. A quick survey of different clothing stores left me with a smug, superior sense of satisfaction. I felt what most Italians must feel when visiting other countries - an acute lack of quality! When in Rome, I do not dare step into the Armani and Gucci stores by the Spanish Steps. My budget can't afford the tip of a Hermes scarf. But the regular stores give me what I want - quality! I wasn't lost to the dreamy fascination that envelopes all newcomers to the third eternal city - Prague (third to Jerusalem and Rome). I walked along bridges and cobblestones, climbed hills and explored alleys and fell in love with Prague. At Bohemia Bagel  , my emails seemed part of an advertising campaign. Prague is stunning! Come visit! You will not regret it! True Italians don't give in so easily. After butchering the Czech clothing fashion, I explored the culinary side of the city, and my response to this second survey was a big, "Aha, I knew it!" Greasy meat, fried cheese, cement-settling knaidlach  - definitely a far cry from my light, but fulfilling diet. I could literally live for a week on what the locals consume in a day. But I needed olive oil! Fresh basil! Pasta Barilla, Rio Mare tuna fish, romaine lettuce. A quick taste of Karlovy Vary sourced bottled water set me on a new assignment to get San Benedetto water, or, at least, San Pellegrino! After school, I wandered around the city, dodging packed Karlova Street and walked up Husva towards Tesco. There it was - La Vecchia Bottega Italiana! I walked in and stepped right out. This store held a vast range of Italian and west-European products, from sauces and canned goods to stainless steel frying pans and wooden cutting boards. It was a virtual paradise for tourists and Italian-style cooks and way out of my price range. Then, salvation! A good friend and fellow expatriate (alas, not Italian) mentioned an Italian store on Hastalska Street, right around the corner from my flat. I called my friend the next evening, to thank her for having scored. I now held her in high esteem. She had shown me the key to survival in this food-oblivious town! In that store, I found reasonably-priced Rio Mare tuna fish and immediately felt blessed. Yes, Italians eat tuna in olive oil, but they do not get fat on it, unlike the Americans who crave tuna in water, a tasteless and fat free (?) substitute for the "real" thing. I exited the little, friendly bottega with bags full of Santal orange and tomato juice, a bottle of Bertolli extra-virgin olive oil, a few packages of spaghetti (not Barilla, but it will do), olives in salamoia water, San Benedetto heavenly water and a bit of precious information - go to Fruit De France    for fresh basil and rucola salad! Fruits de France held a vast variety of exotic (for Prague) fruits, cheeses, wines and so on. Prices were sky high, but basil is a basic necessity which I badly needed for cooking pasta sauce and soups and dressing tomato salads. And rucola, a bitter tasting green, dressed only with freshly-squeezed lemon juice was a luxury I had to concede myself, a relief after the Italian product searching campaign. I was happy. I was eating quality, wearing quality, and I even managed to teach my students some Italian songs and phrases. Italy is in me. It will never leave me. Right now, I'm in New York, starting my search campaign from scratch.
