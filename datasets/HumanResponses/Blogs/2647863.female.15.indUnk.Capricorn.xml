      look, its different! =D i am so proud of myself cause i made the image there. all i did was resize it and put the words on, but i still feel proud =D this still needs some fixing colourwise, but that can wait. and the tagboard needs to be put in too.   and now! off to read!

      let this be the first of undoubtedly many times i say this on here. i hate my family. i live with quite possibly one of the most restrictive, un-understanding, purely idiotic families there is. nothing i ever do is quite enough. my parents have these incredibly busy demanding jobs, so i live with my grandparents. and my grandparents are convinced the only way to bring up a child is as though we were still living in the 1930's. and i will never ever live up to my mother in their eyes. every day, everything is another occasion for them to tell me that my mother is the idol we must all live up to. if the life you want is one where all your collegues despise you, your husband hates you and you have no time for your daughter, then sure why not.  ack, im in such a terrible bad mood. i got my monitor back and its not on quite straight and the angle is driving me insane. not even the little things are going right.

      ok, well the snow day was nice, but unfortunately its now back to reality. im starting to dislike reality. reality has a lot of work in it. like a rather large and complicated geo lab and a science test tomorrow.   the ontario liberals who seemed so holy have successfully broken almost every single one of their election promises. ha! its not wise to trust people who look perfect or holy. they rarely are. anyways, vote green! lol. or ndp. even the conservatives are better as a party than the liberals. i may not agree with all their policies, but i think they were more trustworthy.  this evil geo lab is calling. *cries* i really dont want to do this.   maybe i should use punctuation. actually, i think i have punctuation. i dont have capitalization or apostrophization, if thats even a word.   .:that said i have nothing more to say:.

      SNOW DAY!!! YAY!!! the weather gods are so kind =) of course, i havent actually done any work yet, likei promised myself i should do. i must write my english thing since it is due tomorrow. *sigh* and not going to do my math homework cause i never do and he never checks.   i was up at 6:30 today anyways so i didnt get to sleep in, but the main thing is i missed school! and its the day with all the hard subjects too =D  snow is beautiful.  i spent my time drawing last night. i drew a dried out dandelion that was on my desk and various egyptian stuff. much fun. all black and white of course, since i always avoid colour. mainly because i find colour hard to draw with.   my mom has been doing phone interviews all day. i wonder what they want to talk to her about. the only reason i know this is because she told me to hang up while i was talking to her because she was expecting a call. nice to know i matter, mom.  .:that said i have nothing more to say:.

      hmm, reading through the last entry i noticed so  many mistakes. =(  i want to change the way this looks, i want it to be more organized, but still be pretty and winter-y. but i think this will have to wait until i have a computer that is faster than a dead turtle.   one note to the weather gods. please do not play a cruel trick on us pitiful mortals and make the snow stop early enough to extinguish any hope of a snow day.thank you, your humble servant.  .:that said i have nothing more to say:.

      no, my computer is not alive again, and no i have not taken inititive (sp?) and updated from school. i have found my ten year old computer with the annoying broken spacebar, and hooked it up to the internet. gosh this thingis slow. its still typing at the top of the update box, and im done my first paragraph. aha. the x key is also broken. it takes forever to type when you have to press all the keys extra hard. but still the computer is so slow it cant catch up to me. ha!  anyway, so we presented our english tale of two cities scene today. i was very nervous for that, cause i hate talking in front of people. throw in a stage, audience and lights, and its even worse. nevertheless, i survived =D and i got a decnt mark, so thats good. what most people might not know is since mr. lorry was based after my great-great grandfather, i got to be someone in my family. i thought that was cool. i also think it is cool that he owned the jacket thing i wore. my grandpa insisted on me wearing that. he's obsessive over ever single detail. it can get quite scarily annoying sometimes.  in guidance we did this COPS survey thing to tell us what good jobs for us would be. i would like to know how they paired me up with such things as germ-seperator, soft drink mixer and awning and tent repairer. i have nothing against those jobs, but for me? i think id die of boredom. and what exactly IS a germ-seperator? anyway, i agree better with the professional science category, which is what i tied for. guidance is so boring. i would rather have a course that is interesting, than a course that is easy. lol, and that mightbe why i took geo, since its my worst course and its hard, but at least its interesting.  i think my spacebar might just be about to die. *holds a requiem mass* wait, thats  after  somethings died. um, special prayer service or something. a healing circle? hmm, there is a word for the service they hold to try to bring life back into the dying.   my spacebar seems to be frightened of whatever it is. its alive again!!! yay! *holds a celebration mass* lol, the happy joy thanksgiving ceremony! if im gettingthis all wrong, its because im not catholic and have never been to church more than maybe 5 times. ive never even been baptized. i guess im going straight to hell. ah well  *performs complicated surgery on her space bar* ok, its alive again. this just might drive me insane = aha, i have just realized i forgot my geo books. grr. ok, so i can do cience then. but it will be dinner soon, so no point in starting now.  i offically have no house spirit. since i only know one person in my house, house spirit week means a lot of loneliness. and loneliness is bad. i have enough of that as it is.   wow, someone just signed in with the name 'i was wise once, the moment i was born i cried' or words to that effect anyway. great saying! who was that? oh, it was amy. hi amy! great saying.  i want to read the douglas adams hitchhikers guide to the galaxy books. i also want to see the movie metropolis. i also want to go eat potato chips. one sec.   ok, back with potato chips. wow, that gave the computer time to catch up with my typing. wonderful. i wonder how long this is? probably long enough. if you have read this far you have considerable patience. *presents you with an award*  oh yes! there was this british person who won a golden globe and he said, 'im not from here, im from this place called england. we used to run the world before you.' and i thought that was funny  yes, well, goodbye

      who was at cds in grade 7 and remembers the outsiders, and this poem?--- Nature's first green is gold, Her hardest hue to hold. Her early leaf's a flower; But only so an hour. Then leaf subsides to leaf. So Eden sank to grief, So dawn goes down to day. Nothing gold can stay.  	-- Robert Frost  lol, i think i will never forget that poem, its been drilled into my head...  anyway, my computer at home died. so very sad =( it needs a new monitor, which it has gone away to get, i hope to have it back in a couple weeks. for now, i am using my moms computer, but since i only go home at weekends, i only have internet on weekends now, another thing which depresses me slightly.  the other thing which depresses me slightly at the moment is a rather large amount of homework, which i have been attempting to procrastinate my way away from. but now i feel guilty, so i have to go do it. *sigh*  now this computer froze, and turned into 'safe mode'. this hurts my eyes. ow. i think i might be computerly cursed or something...  .:that said i have nothing more to say:.

      i love this song. its '99 Red Balloons' by the German band Nena, from 1988-ish. you know that ad for telus with the pigs floating in red balloons? well this is the song. this is what happens when i get into my dads old record collection. i have both the english version and the german, hehe. i made up sorta a hybrid version here, of the english and the direct translation of the german. the music to this song is good, and the lyrics are slightly odd in places but ah well.   You and I in a little toy shop buy a bag of balloons with the money we've got Set them free at the break of dawn 'Til one by one, they were gone Back at base, bugs in the software Flash the message, "Something's out there" Floating in the summer sky 99 red balloons go by.  99 balloons On their way to the horizon Seemed like UFOs from space  So a general sent A flying squad out there To raise the alarm if it was true Yet there on the horizon were Only 99 balloons  99 red balloons floating in the summer sky Panic bells, it's red alert There's something here from somewhere else The war machine springs to life Opens up one eager eye Focusing it on the sky Where 99 red balloons go by.  Call the troops out in a hurry This is what we've waited for This is it boys, this is war The president is on the line As 99 red balloons go by.  99 war ministers Matches and petrol cans Thought that they were clever people  Already smelled greasy loot Shouted: War, and wanted power Man, who would have thought That one day it would come to this Because of 99 balloons  99 Knights of the air ride super-high-tech jet fighters Everyone's a Silverhero Everyone's a Captain Kirk With orders to identify To clarify and classify Scramble in the summer sky As 99 red balloons go by.  99 years of war Don't leave a place for victors There are no ministers any more No jet engines either Today I'm doing my rounds Seeing the world lying in ruins  99 dreams I have had In every one a red balloon It's all over and I'm standin' pretty In this dust that was a city If I could find a souvenier Just to prove the world was here... And here is a red balloon I think of you and let it go.

      aah! this morning i had the math test from hell. i didnt know how to do half the stuff, and we had a fire drill in the middle of it. normally, that would be a blessing, but considering its COLD out there, it was not quite so wonderful. thankfully cynthia gave me her blazer, so i didnt freeze completely =) i still cant completely feel my ears.  i think its funny how we can spend an entire guidance class learning what our 'true colour' is. apparently im gold, with a bit of green thrown in. green came a pretty close second.   our cars are being 'practice runned' tomorrow. wow, crazily bad grammar there. i tried my car out at my moms office which has the same carpet and it went 26 metres. it doesnt go quite straight though, so it took a lot of tries to get a run without it bashing into random sections of wall.   i am currently getting a crash course in the british education system. i am so glad i live in canada. i think our system's better.  .:that said i have nothing more to say:.

      i am making a hat in crochet class. its white and it looks like lace. so pretty. slightly screwed up, but darn good for a first attempt in my opinion =)  people can be such fickle, evil animals. they say one thing to your face and another behind your back. its really, really annoying. at least say something to my face, thanks. i also find it mildly amusing/depressing how people change over time. some of the people who used to be my best friends are people i barely speak to now. you cant degrudge people change, and change is normally good, but its still sad. *ahem* yes, i am in a depressively bad mood today.   anyway, off to go study for numerous tests. oh, and if ms collucci teaches french next year for any reason, im never taking french again. i have had enough of her. shes a nice person, but i hate her as a teacher. so boring.  i miss europe. i want to go back to stralsund =( it was so nice there. *sigh* i miss my cousin tina. and i miss waking up every morning and smelling a big breakfast wafting up the stairs. i miss getting up and tripping down those steep wooden stairs onto the floor and having a cat wind itself around my feet, while my aunt beams at me, and music from the radio is playing softly in the sun-filled kitchen. *cries* so very very nice.  .:that said i have nothing more to say:.

      my weekend was good. i totally procrastinated on all my homework and ill pay for that later, but i had fun, so there.  i love snow. theres so many interesting and poetically beautiful things about it. blizzards have to be my favourite weather event =)  the dandelions i pressed and framed on my desk are losing their vibrant yellow and green-ness. i might need to get some new ones in the summer. i think we're going to grow roses this year though, so maybe ill press thoses instead. roses have to be my favourite flower.  the new battlestar galactica is weird. for the first little bit i was completely lost and ready to just give up on it, but then i noticed that caprica was actually simon fraser university, where my moms friend is the president, so i kept watching. that added to the weirdness. it doesnt seem like an alien world when youve walked around on it, and fallen asleep there because you had jetlag. it got much better by the end, and now im mad because im back at my grandparents house where we only get ten channels, and not space, so i cant see the conclusion. *sigh*   on a random tangent brought up by a friends question, i learnt my meagre amount of german from my dad, who is full-blooded german and came here when he was 14-ish. i really wish i knew more, german is such a fascinating language. im contemplating asking my parents to just speak german at home, so ill pick it up, but i dont know how long we could stick with that.   ah well, off to read an ancient roman mystery novel and maybe do french homework and study for music.

      i cut myself by accident shaving. ow. i was walking round the house, and my grandma's like, 'your leg!' and i looked down and saw that my whole leg was covered in blood. i am unobservant. then she runs around fussing and telling me what to do and asking if i needed her to help. i took one look at her and hobbled off to take care of it myself. i (A) hate fussing, and (B) dont need anyones help to wash my leg and put a bandaid on. anyway, now it feels painful, so i will be slightly hobbling around  i thought mr. o'reilly didnt give perfects. i was wrong. therefore im happy because i got perfect on my car project. wheeee!  going to school may cause you to have an overload of homework and studying. this may cause large amounts of stress. large amounts of stress may result in medical problems or depression, either of these conditions could lead to death.   therefore, going to school may kill you . its only logical.   or at least be hazardous to your health, both mental and physical . and yet, i see no bright red warning signs ANYWHERE! this is an incredible oversight, and must be remedied immediately. *gets out her markers and bristol board*  what brought this on? a rather scary history test. drawing a comic strip? pfah! no. i think i might now be leaning further into the side of hating my history teacher.  and now, onwards and upwards to large amounts of english homework! *trumpets sound* *cavalry charges* *cowboys ride into the sunset*

      well careers today was interesting... i think ive decided to stay in canada for university. *nods* GO CANADA!!!! wheeeeee!!! much less expensive, and i think people talk nicer, anyway. after going all round the world, there is no feeling like stepping on to an air canada plane and hearing plain old canadian english again    I &hearts; CANADA!!! *waves flag* *sings national anthem* *builds an igloo*   ok, enough partiotism. i want to do archeology as of now, but doctor is up there. i just dont think i could stay in school for that long  O.o  its like.... ages upon ages upon ages! the thing about archeology is though, how many jobs? and do i need to take physics? and what university shall i go to? and what shall i specialize in? and will i be starving? and will i ever have a home that i spend time in, or just be living in tents? and how hot is it in deserts and jungles and stuff? and how cold out on tundra?   and does any of that matter if ill be doing something that i love?  it is imperitive that i now go study a lot. ack. stupid geo. and stupid history. i could deal with one of them, but with both of them together, im hopelessly outnumbered.   *crawls into a corner and drowns under textbooks and notebooks*  ooo! would it be possible to stop the world for a couple days? that would be greatly appreciated. so if anyone knows how to do that, go to it! just make sure i can still run around and study, ok?  yay!  lalalalalala.... *ker-sploosh*  ker-sploosh? oh dear...

      i shall now commence being a depressing bore, because that fits my mood. i hate sunday evenings. they are by their very nature depressing.  im sick and tired of always being the person who starts every msn convo, and hardly has people come up to her and talk to her in real life either. the only time people seem to do either of these things is if they want something. im glad to know that you think im a helpful, dependable person that you can turn to, but still it hurts. i think various people have deleted me too. i may just be living up to some paranoid inner nature, but blah. i miss even people who talk about nothing but their own problems and expect me to solve them. i miss people who dont talk, but play those games like mindsweeper with me. i have 70 contacts on my list, and the people i talk to almost daily are about three. and one of those is me. yes, i talk to myself, sad isnt it?  yes, i know im not the most interestingly fascinating person in the world, but chances are, you arent either.   on the other side of the scale, i know i dont talk much either. i dont answer questions in class, and i dont go up to random people and start conversations. i never feel like i have much to say, and it certainly isnt worth my while to pipe up and say something at home, cause if its contradictory to what they think, its much safer to stay quiet.   so yes, this is all very confusing now. i am being far too serious and i seem to be condradicting myself.  hey, i never said i wasnt a hypocrite.

      I’m as bored as anything, and the English homework looks depressingly large. So… I will follow good tradition and not do it, for now at least. It has come to my attention that A Grain of Sand could be a fascinating character, so I will now go get some potato chips and develop this idea.  ~*One in Infinity, A Grain of Sand’s Story*~  A much unrepresented fact in textbooks is that feelings are not limited to humans. As a race, humans seem to have a minority which realizes that animals have feelings and emotions. An even smaller minority has realized that plants have feelings. This is a decided step forward. What more than even 99.9% of this small majority fail to realize is that inanimate objects have feelings as well. When you pick up a rock and throw it at a tree, not only is the tree hurt, so is the rock. Apart from physical pain, it also goes though incredible mental and emotional stress while it tries in vain to think of any reason that you could possibly have to randomly pick it up and hurl it at an innocent tree. Please be considerate next time you feel like throwing yourself at a tree. Thank you.  Another interesting fact that textbooks tend to ignore is that superpowers really do exist. Fortunately the Council on the Allocation of Superpowers is wise enough not to give them away lightly. There has only been a very few being’s with feelings that have been honoured with this incredible burden. Needless to say now, A Grain of Sand was one of them.  The simple and rather unimaginative Ants of Ant House in Distant Anthill were never aware of this, however. If they had known, they would have no doubt considered it a grave insult to their normality, and contemplated throwing A Grain of Sand out of the house. Thankfully, they never found out, otherwise most of our story so far, and yet to come, would have been inalterably changed. The Management would like to thank whatever forces or gods who conspired not to let this happen.  And now, the story will be told. We rejoin our dead hero, Ant from Distant Anthill, who had a simple upbringing, but one day saw A Grain of Sand on a piece of white rubber and was conducted into legendary immortality. Due to a terrible lack of logic on the part of the math gods, Ant had been sent back to death, and A Grain of Sand had been removed from the eternal happiness cube. This was a terrible tragedy that neither of them was very happy about.   Ant then became very confused. He was feeling groggy and in pain again, when he was supposed to be dead. This didn’t end well last time, he thought, I don’t want to be alive in a swirling pool of fog when I’m supposed to be peacefully falling through a pit of blackness. I am quite bust being dead, there’s simply no room in my schedule to keep coming back from the dead. At this rate, I’ll never stop falling and get to see heaven.   When Ant’s equivalent of eyes reluctantly un-fogged themselves yet again, Ant could see familiar surroundings. Yes, this was definitely his home! He could see all the large blades of grass and interesting coloured pebbles that he was used to! The destruction of his life and being dead must have all been a bad dream! His mother had warned him not to eat that piece of cheese one of his friends had found.  Ant turned to look at the town of Distant Anthill. He stood very still with his antennae waving about aimlessly. Distant Anthill wasn’t there. It wasn’t a dream. He really was dead.   In all this, we must remember that Ant was still rather simple. This was simply too much of a shock for him to take. After all, it isn’t every day that you go find out that you’ve wound up dead. So he completed the normal course of action and fainted.  When he revived he saw A Grain of Sand looking very smug for an eroded piece of rock. It had a look on what passed for its face which clearly said, “I am SO much smarter than you. I just brought you back to life and now we will all fly away in this cherry that I am sitting on.”  And that is precisely what they did. Why, I do not know, but that is what happened.  I wish I could say that they lived happily ever after in a cherry orbiting the earth, but alas I cannot. Cherries do not very good aerodynamics, you see. They have a peculiar flying pattern. As a result of this, Ant and A Grain of Sand and their cherry and all, fell off the world.  At least they were laughing.  (fini)

      Today I wrote a math contest where one of the questions concerned a cube with an ant standing at one of the corners and how many times he could walk around the side lengths and such. Needless to say I thought of the heroic Ant of Distant Anthill, who had a simple upbringing, but saw A Grain of Sand on a piece of white rubber and was conducted into legendary immortality. I was so distracted I couldn’t concentrate and I think I might have failed the math contest. On the positive side of things, there is now a new chapter in Ant’s life, or rather his afterlife.  ~*A Rather Cubic Ant’s Heaven*~  Ant was groggy and in pain. This was perfectly understandable since he’d just been squashed to a pulp and died moments before, but that’s not what was bothering him. What was bothering him was that he could feel anything at all. After all, he was for all accounts and purposes dead. He should not be feeling anything. And if he was so lucky as to still go on feeling, he would have wished for a better feeling than ‘groggy and in pain’.  Slowly his simple but heroic Ant equivalent of eyes started to lose their fog and allow Ant to see around him. There was not much there. Just more fog really. He wasn’t even quite sure his eyes had un-fogged themselves properly, that was how much fog there was.  Then he saw a figure looming ever closer through this massive swirl of impenetrable fog. How he could have seen through this impenetrable fog is beyond understanding, but we must remember that Ant was now a hero, and heroes are known to have all sorts of impossible special abilities. Maybe the hormones and genes and such in Ant’s poor little body had been so thoroughly fed up and bored that they had decided to turn Ant into a superhero, just for the fun of it. I wouldn’t know.  To continue, a figure was looming closer and closer with each passing second to where Ant was. This was no ordinary ghost-like or god-like figure that you would expect a visit from when you were for all accounts and purposes dead. This was an actual mathematical figure. A cube to be exact. It had all sorts of complicated-looking numbers and letters that Ant assumed to be of great mathematical importance scrawled all over its transparent surface. More surprisingly, A Grain of Sand was bouncing along inside this cube looking for all intents and purposes excruciatingly happy. Ant felt rather betrayed by this. After all, he had just sacrificed his life to avenge the death and destruction of all A Grain of Sand had supposedly held dear. He would have expected at least a small show of grief.  Ant was rudely torn out of this train of thought by a voice that said, “Simple but heroic Ant of Distant Anthill, we are glad to have you with us this day.” Again, Ant felt slightly hurt. So many people seemed to be glad that he was dead. It was rather depressing. He felt he should reflect back on his life to see what exactly he had done to make everyone so glad he was dead, but was rudely interrupted by the voice again. “We have intercepted you in your journey to heaven, to ask you to take place in a vital experiment that will immortalize you even further. You are a hero in the ant world, but now you have the chance to be a hero in the human world as well! Reflect on that if you will!”  Ant obediently reflected. He was not impressed. What passed for humans had just destroyed his entire life in a shockingly off-hand stroke of brutality. He did not understand why he should be as impressed as the voice implied he should be, at becoming one of their heroes. He then wondered what he would have to do.  The voice appeared to be able to read his mind. “All you have to do,” it stated, “Is walk round that cube, starting at point A. Tell us how many edges you can walk on before you must retrace your steps.  Ant thought that was amazingly simple. He sidled up to point A, which was conveniently labelled with a large red flashing neon arrow that Ant was amazed he had not noticed before. He then proceeded to totter around the edges of the cube taking care not to either fall off or retrace his steps. It was rather difficult to concentrate, because beneath him, inside the cube, A Grain of Sand was still hopping about enthusiastically. It was rather distracting.  After a long and arduous journey, Ant arrived at point C. The voice then said, “You seem to have bypassed point B. We like your unorthodox approach! You have provided us with an answer to a very pressing question, and we are very grateful. Generations of human children will learn about your journey in their math classes. You will not be forgotten. As an extra token of our appreciation, we, the math gods, would like to give you A Grain of Sand. May you be happy forever.”  With these final words, a hole appeared in the cube, through which A Grain of Sand was forcibly thrust out. Notwithstanding the fact that it is difficult, if not impossible, to discern the more subtle emotions of sand grains, it would seem that A Grain of Sand was being dragged out of the cube kicking and screaming with a decided disinclination to leave.  Ant was still reeling over the fact that he had just been called unorthodox. He had still not decided whether this was praise or insult, when a rather sullen Grain of Sand sunk down in a depressed manner beside him. Ant beamed at A Grain of Sand in a vain attempt to cheer him up. Then the math gods plonked both of them back where they had picked them up. The desolate Distant Anthill.  The math gods were surprisingly lacking in logic when they made this move. For instance, they had not considered this fact: Ant was dead when he was at Distant Anthill. This lack of consideration was shocking, for only a second after he had decided he liked the math gods after all, Ant fell down dead.  (fini)  in other news... i just realized how much chocolate i eat. its shocking. one year i gave up chocolate for lent, and i went insane. seriously, i had withdrawal symptoms.  although i wrote the math contest, i came home right afterwards. it would appear the art in life is compromise.

      i just wrote on a piece of paper with my left hand : "Hello, I am writing with my left hand in a desperate bid to become ampidextrous"  i then looked at what i wrote, switched to my right hand and wrote: "I don't think there's any hope."  the things you do when you're bored.  alice showed up today =D SHE'S ALIVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *rejoices* *calls off massive search parties*  there is massive amounts of history to do for tomorrow, and i really really really don't feel like doing it. but i will. just not yet. i do not feel i have procrastinated enough just yet.  i want to get my ears pierced. i just love earrings. i love all jewelry in fact. any jewelry. and i might be one of those rare people who doesnt like expensive jewelry as much as non-expensive jewelry. most expensive stuff is too.... plain? lol. i like medieval-ish stuff and thats rather unplain. yes, give me the cheap, moderately garish stuff!!!! *takes* thank you!  im listening to australian radio. this makes me happy. i do not now have to use the very slow and possibly expensively illegal kazaa anymore =D which is good. im too young to go insane waiting, or to have a criminal record. i would rather be insane though. as long as i could hide it whenever psychiatric help came. hehe, that might drive them insane too, if you were always crazy, except when they were there.  today, i set up all the chairs in the band room, minus 5 or 6 that someone else did. this makes me oddly proud. three or four people poked their heads in the door, saw me setting up, and then left. im so proud of all our service-minded and extremely helpful school attendees. it wasnt even as though they could have said 'theres lots of people setting up, no need to help.' i mean, it was only me. *sigh* ah well. it was exercise.  as regarding my quiz results from yesterday, what do people think? does that 'fit' me?   p.s. the number of times i have typed 'me' instead of 'my' in this entry is mindboggling.

      Isn't that such a cool title? I mean, the negative of the positive!   I'm mad at kazaa. It's being slow. It's all kazaa's fault. the fact that I have a modem that would shock most web surfers with its slowness has nothing to do with it. Since Im a human teenager, it is my right to be selective in what I believe, and to ignore facts. I will now continue onwards forcibly being delusional.  Have you noticed that there's punctuation? *grins insanely* I hate punctuation, but I dared myself to do an entire entry with punctuation, just to see if i could do it without going mad. Since I just grinned insanely I don't think I'm going to succeed.  How do you spell succeed? Suceed? Succeed? The handy-dandy dictionary says two c's. I think it's right.  The internet is feeling HAPPY!!!!!!!!!!! We are so good!!!! Oh no!!! Tired is number three!!! It's creeping up there!!! This MUST be prevented!!! *gives the internet some nyquil* *realizes what she's done* *tries in vain to wake the internet up* *millions of dollars are lost on the stock market* *thousands of people lose their jobs* *everyone is poor* *people go back to living without technology* *the second dark ages descend on the world*  Who would have thought a little bit of nyquil would cause world-wide destruction? I think I might have a knack for seeing the worst case scenario...  Every time I don't eat something that's on my plate, my dad says, "What crime have they committed?". Except he says it in German, and with the funniest expression and tone that it makes me crack up every time. Then I shut up and eat whatever it is. He has a very good technique of guilt mixed with humour, works every time.  I will now carry out a random act of desperation.  ALICE!!!!! WHERE ARE YOU??? SHOE YOURSELF!!!!! (authour's correction: that should read SHOW not SHOE. please alter that phrase in your memory. thank you.) *sends massive search parties of turtles and sheep and footballs out to find her* See? I said footballs, not the hated other s word, so you can come back now. Did you go to pizza island? If you did, why didn't you take me? And please don't fall in a pepperoni and never show your face again on msn.   Paul? If you're reading this, do you know where Alice is? Can you tell me so that I can call off the massive search parties? Thank you =)  *suffers great emotional distress due to lack of people to talk to on msn*  Disclaimer: The Management apologizes to all readers who were confused by the last few paragraphs. If you have suffered temporary insanity or great mental stress while attempting to figure out where pizza island is, or what the dreaded s word is, we wish you a speedy recovery. We would like to apologize for any inconvience caused, and steadfastly refuse to pay your medical bills. Thank you.   P.S. The title appears to have no actual relevance to the content of this entry.

Very  stubborn  and money cautious.   get your month  urlLink here   *ahem* wow. i am ...evil... apparently. or at least cold, hard-hearted, jealous, and stubborn. i think this person had some serious issues with january babies. i shall now go back and strike out all the things i dont think apply to me.   not much left. maybe my view of myself is skewed though.   serious... it depends on whats going on. i am very not organized or neat.   the tv is blaring with some program starring people with british accents. no one is watching. i will go turn it to something else later. when i get over my laziness and actually get up.   mother will arrive home shortly. i must make sure i have combed my hair. she has this mania for perfect hair. this may be an impossible task, due to the fact that all my combs and brushes appear to have gotten into the valentines day spirit and eloped to some invisible version of las vegas. may the honeymoon be over soon. hopefully i will get many more little brush and comb children out of this, and will never have to pay for them again.

      for some reason i feel like saying 'lets all go fall through staircases!' this scares me.   tomorrow i shall spend valentines day alone doing massive amounts of homework. apparently, the teachers have no love for me. this is depressing, but if they all fell madly in love with me, that would be plain scary, so ill shall stick with being unloved.  i really really really dislike being dragged into other peoples problems. i hate taking sides. for some reason, i like being naive and thinking that everyone is good and no one can do anything wrong. so, if i take someone's side in something, its probably because they are more my friend than the people on the other side. i really love everybody and hate people being mad and fighting. everybody just get along! feel the love! its valentines day soon, for goodness's sake!  what brought this on? a internal family fight, where i took my dads side, because he is the family member i love most, and people got mad at me for not staying impartial. *cries*  alright, i will now go watch tv and attempt to rot my brain, which is very unwise since i will need it tomorrow for my work.

      this is a short story about an ant. i will type it in here directly, so it will not be edited (at least, not very), and might even be unfinished. why do i do this, you ask? because paul asked me to. his reason? he wants to read a short story about an ant, but doesnt have one to read at the moment. i thought this was a good reason, so here it is. in a departure from my normal style, i will use proper punctuation. *weeps for all the capital letters she must now bring back from their happy frolics in the letter-fields of happiness and enslave on this page*   ~*A Simple Ant's Seemingly Ordinary Day*~  One day, many many years past, an ant was born in the sandy depths of an anthill, which is quite a normal place for an ant to be born, really. This ant's parents called him Ant. They were very unimaginative people. They followed good tradition and named their house. It was called Ant House. They also had a pet grain of sand, who they called A Grain of Sand, but that is of no consequence (I think).   To continue, Ant had a very happy and insulated childhood. He played with simple and entertaining ant toys, ate simple and tasty ant food, and slept in a simple but comfortable ant bed. Yes, Ant was simple alright. Ant's parents were disproportionately proud of him, but no one really cared. After all, the only child of somewhat unimaginative parents was guaranteed to receive a disproportionate amount of praise, no matter what they actually acheived.  On one other normal day, the insulation around Ant's life fell off. What he should have done was sued the insulation company, the builders and anyone else he could think of, and become rich and famous beyond his wildest dreams. Far beyond his wildest dreams, in fact, for being a simple ant born of unimaginative parents, his wildest dreams were rather tame. They involved such exotic things as jumping off an ant sized chair and writing monthly articles for "Good Ant Housekeeping".   But I digress. Instead of taking the honourable and courageous course of legal action, Ant simply stood still in shock, with his antennae waving about in mid-air.   Right in front of Ant's waving antennae was his home (Ant House, if you remember correctly). Except it wasnt there. His entire home, along with his parents, his simple ant necessities, and A Grain of Sand, had disappeared. As had the whole town of Distant Anthill.   Ant was alone.  Around him stood nothing.   So, in other words, he was alone.  In the far off distance, he could see gigantic shapes looming into the vast expanse of the world. They had fabric draped over them and made twittering noises of glee. They also had white rubber soles on the pieces of their anatomy that they were using to flee into the horizon.   Ant assumed he had gone temporarily insane and was hallucinating. In fact, he was not. The elemental gods, more commonly known as little brat children, were running across a park, giggling.  In a sudden clarity of vision, Ant glimpsed A Grain of Sand on one of these gods white rubber soles. He then proverbially commenced to "see red".   As Ant was, by nature and birth, a red Ant, this was not so odd. But, by function of years of exile, his inner ferocity had calmed, and he became a respectable simple Ant. It is an interesting fact that a single act or shock to an ant can undo generations of respectable evolution. Ant promptly "forgot" that he was a simple Ant, not prone to brave deeds or unexpected bouts of violence, and plotted fiery revenge.  Ant also "forgot" that he was bound by the laws of physics, which was very useful, because it allowed him to run very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very fast, and catch up to the retreating gods, who had destroyed his home. He herocially climbed up the god's white rubber sole, and crawled onto this god's flesh.  He then proceeded to bite and tear the destructive god's flesh to pieces. This made the god cry, and conduct a ceremonial defeat to the arms of a mythical "Mother", who promptly found the blood soaked, revengeful Ant and squashed him with her thumb.  And thus expired Ant, the hero of Distant Anthill, who had a very ordinary and simple upbringing, but saw A Grain of Sand on a piece of white rubber and was conducted into legendary immortality.

      the internet is no longer tired and depressed!   it is now sick.   actually it is torn between feeling sick and feeling depressed. in other words a tie.  BUT! its third mood, is...... HAPPY!!!! we are making progress!!!  and sleepy and depressed have been moved to 4th and 8th place!!! =D =D and in love and loved are 5th and 6th, and confused is 7th. all of which are very understandable. if youre used to being taken for granted, then suddenly people come and start hugging you and saying they love you and asking you to be their valentine, its only natural to be confused and maybe fall in love with them. and the internet should definitely feel loved. thats the point.  *hugs the internet*   darn. the internet is tired. but! excited has knocked depressed further down the list. i have proof that this works!!!!!!!! muahahaha  this year, the internet will be my valentine. i love you internet.  i am officially an idiot.   i am also officially obsessed with this internet's mood thing.   tomorrow is friday the 13th. who believes in that? (i do, im scared) who carries lucky charms? (i dont, im more scared)   .....*doom* .....  p.s. i love that word. doom! *runs around saying doom*  p.p.s. please dont make me do my homework. *whimper*  p.p.p.s. i have decided that mice are awesome and that i want mice as pets. this will wear off in a couple days. if it doesnt, then i am actually serious.  goodnight.  i would like to sing a lullaby. this is what my uncle used to sing to me when i was young.  "sweetums lay your ugly head down upon your wretched bed. nighty night sweetums."  it ruined my self esteem for life. i am only now just recovering. oh, so, tortured.   *head falls off*  ...that was random...

Die.  *the end* (or is it? is there life after death? only the dead know, and they aren't very talkative.)  the courses i am taking next year are as follows:  -english -math (A course, functions and relations) -french -biology -chemistry -physics -world history to the 16th century -world religions  music and computer science are my two 'back ups'. and i am doing music outside of school (taking conservatory exam grade 4 for flute this year! ya!) and i will be in band.  this leaves many many many careers open, and are all subjects i like. so yes, there it is. this was decided in science today =) everyone has been marking up my course selection sheet. so many people have decided what theyre taking by using it. its a very important sheet. i will sell it for millions when they are all famous.   i had something else to say, but i forgot. this seems to be happening a lot lately.

      i just got back from the dentist. i hate going to the dentist. not because i hate the dentist himself, but because i hate having strange whirring instruments put in my mouth. i got x-rays gone, which was cool. i got some fillings done, which was not. he stabbed my gums with the drill! *cries* so much pain...  my favourite charcter from the helen of troy movie was cassandra. well i like menelaus too, but he wasnt quite as interesting. cassandra is this princess who can see the future and is always telling people want they must do to make things turn out for the best, but people tend not to listen. they think she's gone mad and is annoying, so they put her into prison. she generally runs around saying stuff to the tune of this..  " Can't you see what you're doing? Troy will burn and you'll all die! Do what's right! You're being blinded by the things which seem right now! It'll all go wrong in the end! Can't you see anything? Troy will be destroyed if you carry on like this! Troy will burn! Doom will come! Doom, I say! DOOM!!! ....are you even listening???"  aw, man, sometimes i feel like that. especially around my family. it feels to me sometimes i'm the only sensible one.  i will now do my homework like a good and dutiful student

      i was going to talk about my egyptian name! because it is cool. this is it spelled out all properly:    mi-w mkt nbt-ht nr-w-t   they didnt write in the vowels. for those of you who prefer their words with vowels, we have the following version:    miu meket nebt het nuru-et   now, to break it down.    miu ---gentleness, kindness. because i would like to be seen this way.  meket ---protected by  nebt het ---the name of the goddess of nature and death undying. also known as nephthys  nuru-et ---born during the day, because i was. the -et means girl.  ta da! mostly, people would / do call me miu, or meket nebt het. the ending part is just descriptive.  and... i also have another name, but thats my 'secret' name, and if you knew it, you would have the power to kill me. so you dont get to know. not that i dont trust you or anything... *suspicious glance*  i think ancient egypt is incredibly cool.

      one of the most annoying things to have happen to you is to know that you have forgotten something, but can't remember what. this has been bugging me all day. arg. this is incredibly frustrating  let me summarize my day:  french:  is there a more boring class than french? i think not.  science:  *ahem* also boring. i didnt want to switch teachers again  geo:  we learnt about volcanoes and did a geolab. i could hardly stay awake it was so exciting  history:  i gave up trying to stay awake.  to summarize the summary: the day was boring  i must now slave over an idiotic guidance assignment. how this will make me a better person, i do not know at the present time.

      i woke up this morning and burned my thumb on a pancake as i took it out of the toaster. i decided they were too hot to eat, so i went away and left them to cool down. then i forgot about them. when i went back to eat them, they were cold and i couldnt re-cook them, cause they were already overdone and as tough as leather. the pancakes are out to get me.  i feel less tired today. *cartwheels*   now i must go downtown to a flute lesson. i have lost my flute book again, and she's going to be mad. *sigh*

      well i predicted that i would feel like death, and guess what? i did. the only hateful thing about sleepovers is i never sleep. so i get tired. then i come home and drink a disgusting cup of coffee and i stay awake for hours and hours and hours.   my dad and i rented dvds yesterday on the way home, just because we CAN now! yay for the semi-new dvd player! *cheers* we rented pirates of the carribean and helen of troy. since i refuse to watch pirates of the carribean yet  again , we watched helen of troy yesterday. it was pretty good. i think it needs to be upgraded to a R rating though. no way that was 14+ :\ i mean, there was a  lot  of violence, people killing their daughters, then being stabbed to death in the bath by their furious wives, people being dragged around behind chariots and eaten by dogs... i guess it gets redeemed by the fact that its a 'classic'. one of the actors in it was a scientist in battlestar gallactica though, so that was a bit disconcerting. its like, youre in the  future  not the  past !  i must now go complete a personal profile for guidance. this i find pointless.

      the sarah brightman concert was AMAZING!!! beautiful, splendiforous, spellbinding, wonderful, musical, awesome, and many other adjectives along that same idea. we got home really late and even though i slept for ages, i'm still tired. and i have a sleepover tonight, so i'm going to be death tomorrow. blah. it was a great time and i really had fun.   stupid me, i always get depressed in february. no real reason. i just do. and it sucks, but it's alright, cause it always goes away.  so i'm off to go do stuff, i don't exactly know what, but thats ok too, cause i'll find something.  i just put apostrophes in this whole thing. i dont like apostrophes. or capital letters for that matter, so i don't know why i did it. *sigh*  it's a beautiful day!

      i looked out the window a couple minutes ago and there was freezing fog outside. it was such an awesome sight. like looking through a frosted glass. i could hardly see the neighbours house. i &hearts; freezing fog!  there is incredible irony in something that just happened. my grandmother was asking me about the details of a party that i am supposed to go to over the weekend, and i said that i didnt know, because i didnt. then i asked if they would listen to a bit of my homework to see if i could improve it. i read it out and when i was done, they said 'fine', then continued to ask me about the details of the party. i repeated that i didnt know anything and turned to leave. they shouted after me, 'dont you dare leave when youre being spoken to! we havent dismissed you yet! come back and answer us if you want to go.'. so i stood there and continued to deny that i knew anything, and suggested that if they really wanted to know, they should call. i got 'dismissed'.  my grandmother then started to complain about how my dad had been pestering her about 'arrangements' for the weekend, and how he didnt accept the fact that she didnt know anything about it. she said that she hates it when people get mad at her without listening what she has to say. i think we might have a hypocrite in the house.   its CISMF tomorrow. i am really not looking forward to this. it was boring as anything last year, and this year i have the added disadvantage of having LOST my music! arg!  my eyes hurt. *sigh* and so does my knee cause ive been sitting like this for awhile. i think ill go hobble off and fall apart in a corner...

      if the internet is feeling tired, why is its mood face smiling? does the internet revel in negative emotions? is it sadistic? would this explain why the internet doesn't like to always work? does the internet take pleasure in watching us bumbling humans fail?   ... i think it does.  anyways, i would like to announce a new national holiday. this friday is  'utilize an unusual verb day' . this basically means that using normal run-of-the-mill, overused verbs is unacceptable. these verbs are banned:   to get, to say, to have, and if you're feeling ambitious, to be (this includes 'is' and 'was' so beware). generally overused verbs are frowned upon.  you do not have to talk like this all day unless you really want to. just do something (like write an entry) with them.  and now my mom wants this back, so i must go.  grr.

      starting from the bottom...   March 9, 2004: caution: description of crypts and people getting run over by trucks ahead.    Paulio:  that music is annoying. and classical music would fit in better...  humdala:  um, lots of people today *do* listen to music, do you mean that they dont want to listen to it in church? that could be, i dont really know cause im not really in touch with people who go to church, so im not sure what they want to listen to... and true, most people dont go to church for the music. and if mass is the same each sunday, i could see how that could be repetitive   March 10, 2004: last random post about socks and calculators and farwells   Paulio:  wonderful song :P and i do think that you were indeed tipsy when you posted all these comments, but they were at least interesting reading :D  Anonymous:  i post my life stories for everyone to read them beacause 1) i like to write, so i find this fun 2) because ei and amy had blogs, so i felt like excersing my follwer nature and getting one too and 3) it helps me keep a record of things i have done or thought so when im old and feeble and my memory is gone i will still have this moments. i haven't really had any 'stalker-ish' people come here. not such a popular site as to all that ^_~ that's just Paulio. he's a friend of mine, and i think he is funny, so i like his comments :D  Anonymous 2:  i am responding :) sorry, i let this slide. ive never been too good on comments, but i will try to shape up in the future   March 13, 2004: and now it is time for me to go... so long... farewell...    Paulio:  yes, it is spanish!!! good job! the bermuda triangle is between bermuda and two other points that i forget, where boats and planes disappear with no warning. i dont think anyone knows why ^_~  i read your comment! i think you are very tipsy, but not posting to yourself. pigs should be given the ability to fly! its a matter of national security. *nods*  and nope, you didnt think of any more questions.  ei:  yay for the response to 'anne's religion post' and im glad someone agrees! now i dont feel like such a spiritually challenged loner ^_~ YAY! someone thought the Ant story was funny! *dances* the trip in sunny hell land was quite fine thank you. see two posts ago for details. and tangerines are infinitely better than peaches, but saying 'everything will be just tangerine-y' doesnt seem to have caught on yet.  chris:  *stands up to authority* *gets grounded and beaten* *glares at chris* lol :P no offense meant. and you're grounded? poor you :(  ok  i think im done

      and now for random insanity.  could someone tell the two voices who have been arguing in my head for the past two hours to shut up? thank you. its actually pretty funny, if you just listen. but theyre starting to get annoying now.  repeat after me, you will do work, anne, you will.   *cries* dont want to...  ................................................. ................................................. ................................................. ...........  epilogue: after much deliberation, anne decided not to work, at which point the arguing voices decided to pop out of her head and attack her for a lapsed work ethic. anne lost the bloody fight which insued.   epilogue of the epilogue: since anne had made mant of her charcters die many times over again and come back to life, the supreme centre for resurrection through re-incarnation decided to put her soul into an ant. she spent many months pushing around grains of sand to form a message that is being translated at the present moment.  epilogue of the epilogue of the epilogue: the message reads  "Get me out of here. p.s. Thank you for the photoshop, ArKane."  the true meaning of this statement is still being deciphered. it may be the code to being able to switch conciousnesses at any moment, but we'll have to get back to you on that. we apologize for any inconvience this may cause.  thank you,  The Management

      hey! im alive and all, without a tan, as far as i can see, due to overjealous use of sunblock *nods* 'cept i have sunburn on the backs of my hands, because after applying sunblock, i wash my hands, cause i hate how it feels all greasy. now i have sunburn. its not that bad though. i should live. i also have ant bites, which i am rather completely upset about. i was trying to bring recognition and little known attention to ants, by writing about one of them, but obviously they're not grateful *sniffles* and a mosquito bite too, which was rather scary, for reasons i will outline below in my feature length travel report-y entry-like thing. *deep breath* ok, lets go lets go lets go!   wherein i explain mosquitoes, walking on a beach, really really really large shells, really really really small and scary planes, and various other miscellaneous things and events relating to grenada. (in a new and exciting format!)   well, i was lying about the new and exciting format. its just a list really, with comentary and such things. but but but stay with me here, it should be outstandingly great reading, or at least an alright way to spend some of your day... whatever.    first thoughts  when i stepped off the plane in grenada the first thing resembling a thought that decided to make itself known to my conscience was, "Damn, it's hot!", which was shortly followed by, "Home! Now! Please! Take me!", which in turn was followed by, "....snow.... where are you...?". i warmed up (pun intended, laughter not manatory) to the idea of hot weather slightly after awhile. a long while.   hotel  the hotel was ok. i was on the fourth floor, which for some reason unknown to me at this time, had all its room numbers starting with 8. O.o... quite odd. they had a gigantic pool, with a waterfall, which was neat, and a nice enough beach. the food was slightly better than disgusting. it had air-conditioning, therefore i loved it there.   sandy, beach-like stuff  the hotel had a beach, or a strip of it at least, within walking distance, short walking distance. it was sandy and nice. there were tons of people selling stuff though. they would just walk up to you and randomly start pushing you to buy stuff, which was annoying. my parents are big people for walking along the beach. so we walked the entire beach both ways. which was something like 3 or 4 kilometres. its very hard to walk when your feet are alternately sinking into sand, or being buried under rather large waves. it was like trying to wade through quicksand, but with waves. not a romantic walk on the beach at all. for one thing, i was with my parents, for another, it was very tiring and slow going. like trekking through quicksand. je n'aime pas beaucoup.   mosquito bite  we were on union island for the day, and while waiting for my mom in a rather grungy bathroom (like most were, actually, but not as bad as russia) this mosquito starts to fly around in front of my face. the mosquitoes in this place were super-deadly, cause, not only can they carry the deadly dengue fever, they dont make a buzzing noise, so you can't tell where they are. they are viscious, deadly little killer beasties. so, i decided to protect myself and others by mindlessly slaughtering it. i tried this for awhile, but it didnt work, cause this was obviously a mosquito of higher intelligence. i gave up. then my leg got itchy, down near the ankle. it bit me! i swell up incredibly badly with insect bites. "Ok, now this is personal, little, infernal, blood-sucking insect!". so i limped around, swinging madly, trying to hit it with my purse, but i didnt get it. it's probably still there, terrorizing people. *glares evily* this was scary and not as hillarious as it might seem, because, i swell up incredibly badly with insect bites. within minutes, the bite was four inch radius-ed bump on my leg, that was making it really hard to walk. i once had two spider bites on my thigh and i couldnt walk for a week. i was also an idiot, cause i didnt think to bring my stuff to make the swelling go down with me. i survived though! im here and all that, even though i got this big ugly bruised bite on my leg *sniffles*   huge shells  still on union island. there was this dock where i was sitting (in the full sun, i am rather stupid) and putting my legs in the water, trying to get the itch away from my bite (little known fact: salt water takes away the itch from insect bites. it works best for bee stings, but i decided to try anyway) there was a gigantic shell just sitting there in front of me. so i went in and got it. it was a huge conch , or lambie, as they call it there, shell. see one  urlLink here . there was nothing in it though, no animal. and it was too big and too heavy to take home, so i threw it back in, but it was neat.   scary planes  imagine compouding three fears into one; heights, confined spaces, flying and falling. then you would have a small idea of what flying on an 8 seater briton norman-islander plane is like. to get in to this plane, the seats in front of you must be folded down, then you climb in awkwardly, and the seats are folded back into their normal places, with people sitting in them. there is no room to move. now imagine this plane is flown by two noisy, unstable propellers. the whole plane shakes with the noise. now imagine that there are no windows. you are shut into this box, with no real way of seeing what's going on outside. all you can gleam from looking out the pilot's window is that you are incredibly high up for such a little thing. now add turbulence like you've never felt it before. not only can you not move and not see, but you are very high up, in an unstable noisy plane, but you are pitching around and your stomach is dwelling in various places, none of which are where it's supposed to be. i am not often afraid of flying, but that scared the wits out of me. i couldn't breathe. i just sat there with my eyes closed, attempting to make myself breathe. when i got out of the airplane i could hardly walk i felt so weak and shaken. thankfully, the fact that i was having some sort of panic attack seemed to prevent me being miserably motion sick. union island was nice, but the plane ride to get there could only be described as absolute hell.   sightseeing  we went to a spice plantation, which was very interesting and smelled absolutely wonderful. we went to a chocolate factory which was much the same with being interesting and nice-smelling, except it was better because we got free samples! *grins* CHOCOLATE!!! *ahem* we also went to the mountains, which were nice and jungle-y with lakes and waterfalls and COOL weather!!! like, it wasn't in the 30's!!! it was in the 10's!!! it was awesome. and there was this person who's life job was to jump off cliffs into lakes so tourists could watch. i though this was funny. imagine that being your job. and what do you do for a living? i jump off cliffs. *dies laughing* um, what else did i do? i went to some old forts, but i do that a lot, nothing really to speak of. i flew over the little island where they were marooned in pirates of the carribbean. and thats about it   plane ride home  the ride home was interesting because we had a 'medical emergency'. someone in the back of the plane had some medical problem, not exactly sure what, but he was ok in the end. there were two doctors and six nurses on our plane, so it was a rather good plane to have a medical emergency on. so we were late coming in, because the pilot had to swerve over to nassau in case we had to land. but we didnt, so that was good. the paramedics all rushed on as soon as we landed. he was alright though. so its all good.  and! je suis fini! wait! no! wrong verb! that means 'i am finished' *dies of a mortal sword wound inflicted by an enraged arch enemy who is overcome with grief and commits suicide shortly after* ah, melodramticism. that should read j'ai fini, or for those of you who are not french literate, i have finished.  i finished reading the mists of avalon on the trip. in fact i started it as well. so i read the whole thing. i finished two minutes before we landed. i thought the movie 'love actually' was rather odd. good enough for an airplane movie i guess. i wanted to see 'lost in translation' but the audio decided to quit working at that exact moment. grrr.

      off i hop onto a plane to fly away  la la la  im actually going tomorrow, but its crazy early in the morning, so i wont have time to post. im off to the land of sun and beaches and .... and.... i dont want to...  *sigh*  but i will, cause i am a good obediant daughter who follows her parents when they want her, and stays obediantly behind with her eyes averted downward to the floor when they dont. so very dark ages. at least theyre taking me this time, not going away without me like last christmas. must... count... blessings...   please inform the pilot that if they fly us over the bermuda triangle, causing us to all spontaneously disappear from the face of the earth, that you will be very angry and sue his family for millions which they cant afford. thank you. intimidation is a powerful weapon.  right, now i will leave you, happy week!!!! be back next sunday or monday, im not exactly sure. but i will be back. and then i will have another week off and the world will all be just peachy. adios.

      i was going to write something of meaning, but i figured it was rather pointless. so i wont. the summary was something like how life is all very artifcial and such, but who wants to read depressing, meaningful stuff, when its march break, so i will bring you an ant story instead. i take no responsibility whatsoever for spelling or grammar mistakes. i couldnt care less, so if you do, then tough. i have finally done research on ants. i feel slightly proud.  ~*  After having fallen off the earth for several hours straight on a flying cherry, Ant was beginning to wish that he had died the several times that he had been given the opportunity, and in doing so, been spared from the terrible bout of motion sickness that he was suffering from. He staggered around feebly in circles. This was probably making him more dizzy and nauseated, but Ant was not one of the smarter ants that ever existed. In fact, he probably didn't even rank in the top half of intellectual ants. He had never really needed to learn such advanced mathematical equations as what 17 +11 was, although he was fairly sure it was 29.  While he was doing this elaborate 'I think I'm going to be sick any moment now' dance around the stem of the cherry, A Grain of Sand was attempting to be useful. It had climbed, or rather, awkwardly fell, into one of the holes in the cherry. It had then rolled around a bit and worked its age-old and eroded features into what passed for a frown. There seemed to be a problem with this cherry's flight control system. It was rather faulty, in fact. A Grain of Sand had never seen such a faulty system. And A Grain of Sand had seen many faulty systems, for a grain of sand.   It frantically butted itself onto various things it thought might be buttons. The cherry took some perilious dives and swirls. One particularly excellent manoeuvre would have made the finest aviators at the most prestigious air shows sick with jealousy. It was making Ant genuinely sick. Both of his stomachs seemed to be emptying themselves with a peculiar ferocity that Ant found it very hard to bear while also attempting to cling on to the stem of the cherry for dear life. Forunately, A Grain of Sand bounced against a buttn that stopped the fall of the cherry and brought it safely back to ground level.  Ant staggered off the cherry and lay down shakily on the ground. A Grain of Sand hopped along beside him and peered down at him with an inquistitve look, that was rather tempered with a smugness at his acheivement in landing the cherry. Ant glared back at him with a murderous intensity and got back up. A Grain of Sand started to roll away from Ant with a look of sheer terror. A red ant's rage was never a very welcome sight to see.  Suddenly, a small, dull grey spider came rushing towards Ant and tackled him to the ground. Ant was rather stupified at this. He was overpowered before he could react. He lay pinned down, blinking upwards at this strange little agressor.   The spider looked so completly proud of himself that he just might burst. It was unnatural to be that proud. A Grain of Sand looked askance at this little grey speck. Sniffing in disdain for all things spider, A Grain of Sand moved over to head-butt it off the astonished Ant. The little grey speck of a spider looked crestfallen. In the course of a few fractions of a second, he must have dropped several sizes. Ant had a brief thought that this seemed far more effective than most of the more progressive dieting techniques of the day. He had just gotten the first few sentences of his revolutionary new book, 'Lose weight AND self-confidence today!', when he felt incredibly sorry for this odd grey speck with too many legs and too much ego.  From what Ant understood of spider, he could make out that all this recently decreased spider had wanted to do was to save an innocent grain of sand from the marauding evil that was an angry red ant. Ant thought this was very noble. He wished he sommunicate this in spider, but he was sadly illerate in regards to speaking the rather complicated language known as spider. Apparently though, this emotion showed in his face, or ant equivalent thereof, because the grey speck swelled back to its proud self. It managed to sputter out that it's name was Harmon, which meant soldier in German, and that he had travelled a long way to fight in a glorious war that was being fought over behind the oak tree.  A Grain of Sand was regarding Harmon with a skeptical stare. It didn't particularly enjoy war, having been part of many buildings that had been knocked down by various flying things that were intent on destruction. Ant wasn't very keen either. But Harmon insisted that it was a glorious war and that they would be advancing a wonderous cause that would benefit the whole world.  With an arguement like that, who were they to resist?  Unfortunately, it took rather a long time to get over to this oak tree, and the war had finished before they arrived. The universal cleaning gods had even had time to come in and smooth over the mess. Harmon did his remarkable weight-loss program again, and everything was as before.   Except for the fact that war can not ever really disappear, and there was a land mine very close to them. A Grain of Sand decided to roll around, which was not a very good idea.   (fin)  i dont think that was up to standard. im not feeling funny today.

      that was an awesome post by the way, ei!!!  ok, lets start with the nature of all things divine, etc... wait, non, lets start with a disclaimer. hehe! that was french back there. alright...   DISCLAIMER: i dont claim to know eveything. this is just my opinion. in all likelihood im wrong. i accept that, but i believe what i believe anyway. dont kill me because of it and i wont kill you, ok? good. i am also feeling rather disorganized and happy right now, so this post may make no sense whatsover. so be it. here i go   i hate it when people fight over religion and who's right and who's wrong. believe what you want to and what makes sense or speaks to you, and be tolerant of others who believe differently. so many wars could have been prevented and so much suffering could have never happened if humans just accepted that its all right to disagree. no one is ever completly right. i dont believe theres such a thing as a universal truth. things are never as clear-cut as that, cause theres always two sides to the issue and different ways you could argue it. we should all just agree that we may be wrong and accept that others may be right. or we all may have been completely, totally wrong all along. we all really descended from little chunks of ice and dandelions rule everything.   i talk about the weather gods and minor theft gods and homework gods, cause i believe there is a god or saint or lesser divine bureocrat in charge of every single little thing that happens in your life. i dont buy the 'only one god for every single thing in the universe' idea. having said that, i am about to contradict myself. i think theres one big gigantic thingimabob that is present everywhere. call it God, call a supreme force, call it universal energy, whatever. then this person or non-entitial being delegates tasks and areas of overseeing to others. otherwise, with the sheer amount of stuff going on in the universe, no one, however powerful, could handle it all. that would be a bureocratic nightmare. i think its interesting how many religions have this sort of concept. christians with saints, and many indigineous or pagan religions with different gods and goddesses.  as to afterlife, theres an afterlife. i dont believe in hell. i think people who have done a large amount of bad things in their life may have to wander around as mournful ghosts for awhile to make up for it, but no one burns in hell forever. i dont believe anything that created us could be that cruel. all people get pardoned in the end. i believe that when we die, we become 'spirits' or ghosts or something like that, until we feel ready to 'move on'. moving on may be any number of things, from a literal view of heaven to just simply ceasing to exist. maybe, if we're particularly good and we learn what we need to know in life, we become part of the divine bureocracy.  i think whatever's out there is controlling science. they invented science and they are no doubt very amused that we dont understand anything about it. (please imagine a large man with a grey beard sitting on fire and brimstone and chuckling at us. thank you.)   i think its sad how so many people have nothing to believe in anymore. it doesnt really matter what religion. in fact, you dont have to have a religion, just some sort of value or belief system that guides you through life. drifters bother me. somehow, it seems unnatural to me. its in people's nature to doubt and question, but when someone doesnt do any of that, then that bugs me. go forth with wondering inquistion!!! (boy, now thats a bad example of how religion went wrong, if i ever saw one)  i have been to church three times in my life and i have not been baptized. according to some religions, this means im going straight to hell. i dont believe in this. we earn are way to what i think is hell, we dont automatically get there because we dont want water sprinkled on our forehead.   ooo! i forgot to do prayer! here i go... prayer is useful. it helps you to focus on whats going on in your head. if you just sit there and pour out everything thats in your mind to someone you think is listening, you most of the time feel better. i dont know how often it actually changes things though. sometimes ive had some freaky things happen like that. but that might just be the power of coincidence. you never know. this also goes under the whole confession thing. you go confess whatever you think is wrong directly to whatever you think is up there watching you. it could be a specific department, such as the gorging on junk food gods or the homical killing spree gods, or just to the supreme higher power. but it's rather busy. a lot to take care of, you know, the universe is.  are you all bored? i could go on forever on this. should i? probably not.   to summarize (for those of you who looked at all that text and fainted): i believe that there is a universal higher power behind everything in this universe. this power delegates other smaller higher powers to take care of everyday issues. when we die we turn into ghosts until we are ready to go to some other level of exsistance. there is no hell where you burn forever. prayer and confession are a good thing, if only to sort your own head out. nobody is ever completly right, and all religions are equally viable.   et voila, im done. i will be back later i think for a short post. i will try to make that one entertaining, no more of this seriousness, its bad for the head =P   on a completely random note, why are there 15 flies on my bedroom window? *opens the window and frees them*

      i am currently suffering from a lack of sleep, too much mind-numbingly borning geo homework, far too much chocolate coated sugar and an extraordinary amount of not so ordinary insanity. *mind explodes*  right, now ive got my mind out of the way, life should be slightly more easy. otherwise known as easier. my grammer seems to be suffering as well. not to mention my spelling.  i think i am sufferring from calculator separation disorder. *cries* i miss my calculator. give it back! i implore you, whichever evil-calculator stealing minor god you might be. you are undoubtedly a minor god, because the major gods steal things like gold necklaces and secret codes and occasionally countries. but you, my evil calculator stealing god, are minor because you stoop so low as to steal an innocent calculator from the clutches of an even more innocent calculator revering law abiding citizen! give it back! or make it turn up, if you are the other evil god in charge of making inanimate objects lose their way and wither in despair away from their owners. i would also like to raise the issue of several lost socks and my sanity with you, since i seem to be missing those as well.   and now i bid you good night and farwell world!!!   *ahem* farewell. farwell is just a place that you have to go a long way to get to in order to get water.

      i took this  urlLink belief-o-matic  quiz which says what it thinks the best religion for your value system would be and these are my results: (i had to take it again because i accidentally deleted the results first time) (my results changed) (i think i like these results better) 1.  Neo-Pagan (100%)   2.  Unitarian Universalism (94%)   3.  Reform Judaism (93%)   4.  Liberal Quakers (90%)   5.  Sikhism (89%)   6.  Mainline to Liberal Christian Protestants (85%)   7.  Mahayana Buddhism (83%)   8.  Jainism (82%)   9.  Hinduism (82%)   10.  Orthodox Judaism (82%)    i like churches. they have an oddly calming effect with all the stone, and the quietness and the peacefullness and the musty odour. whenever i go to europe i always insist we go in all the churches. my dad insists we go in all the crypts (where they bury the dead people). i have smelt some pretty foul crypts in my time. stinky stinky stinky dead rotting people. its particularily bad when the caskets split and also theres rotting flower scent. O.o not pleasant at all. i dont find them scary though. except the one where it was really dark, and it didnt smell at all. that made it just seem wrong somehow. and then all the people were in brushed steel tubes. it was very clinical and menacing. it was hazardous too. all sorts of stones carelessly breaking up and floor tiles thrusting up at odd angles.  know what else is scary? seeing someone get run over by a truck. first of all you hear a sickening thud, then you hear a high pitched shrieking that carries for blocks around. then you hear the whine of the truck brakes, and the acrid exhaust. when the screaming stops theres this complete silence, when even the birds stop singing and all you can think about is that pathetic little bloddy pile of clothes lying half underneath the truck's tire. soon theres a huge flurry of activity when everyone starts yelling at once into their cell phones. and finally the urgent whine of the ambulance.  i carry emotional baggage, what can i say? europe is traumatizing.

      i was going to write a really pissed-off, evil, going to go out and kill the world entry, then i decided against it. thats not because i stopped feeling like that, its because im too lazy to put that much effort into something.   the internet seems to be dying rather a lot lately. or at least my connection to it. what did i do to you, internet? love me, dont hate me! hmm, the internet is feeling happy right now, which is rare. *suspicious glare* i think it is happy that it is annoying me. evil sadistic internet *fumes*  my grandpa's coming over tonight. i thought id got rid of him for the weekend. no such luck. this means early bedtimes of 9 and no tv that isnt the weather channel. some people are just mind-bogglingly boring. i think i see where i get the boring dull streak from...  i like rain. we need more rain. more swamps. more thunderstorms. more rivers. more hurricanes. more massive catastrophic floods that cause widespread destruction.  maybe not.  *goes out and campaigns for a snow day* *weather gods look at her in disdain* *campaigns for a rain day* *weather gods grow annoyed* *campaigns for a massive electrical power outage day* *weather gods chuck her off their sacred cloud*   *sigh*  it was worth a try.

      hahaha! i love that saying  i think i might just keel over into a little pile on the floor. i am exhausted. i am very exhausted. i am terribly exhausted. and that is all i have to say about that subject.  our music teacher looked very exhausted too today. i think our class might just drive him crazy. but seriously, who needs insane and annoying voices in their head, when they have us?  i am still mad at the librarians for taking away my hitch hiker's guide to the galaxy, but i bought my own now, so it's all good. i have outsmarted the librarians!!!!! well, not really, i had to pay, but it feels good to say that.  i think i will now go sleep, or something like it.   wait, i cant, i have to go eat, then go to see the play.   oh phooey.  i dont like to swear, unless i absolutely have to, but i do admit that 'phooey' lacks the same impact as stronger words.   'one mad welshman on a hill called elsie' --- that is priceless.   *dies* (laughing) (it was a joyful death)

      hehe! i am happy, in a completely self-obsessed and arrogant way, but i think im allowed to be like this every once in a while. why am i happy? because i did better on my careers presentation than i expected. i am sure i didnt speak up as much as i was supposed to, and that i read to much off my slides, but i did it all with no notes, and this makes me proud. all my notes deleted. i stood up there and swore under my breath, which is something i only very rarely do, and did it off the top of my head. i am aware i sound like im bragging. i am. that is a big victory for me. i hate, loathe, depise presentations. they are evil. i am always so incredibly nervous and i freeze up and cant do well, or just read the sheet and never look up. so i am proud of myself. if i failed and you know it, please dont burst my bubble, i would like to enjoy this, then be terribly disappointed when i view my marks. its just better that way.  i have a lot of work to do. i should turn off the computer. i will do that. ...soon...  la la la la la !  i am having a rather uninventive day. i cannot think of anything. this is not good... O.o........  *wracks brains* *shakes head* *hits her head against the wall*   right, that acheived no more creative brain energy, and my head now hurts..  i shall be leaving now.  good day, or evening, or night, be that as it may.

      yay!!! what a fun-filled day!!! (with a few exceptions, like being deathly ill (but i got better =P)).  so this morning was ok, normalish and all, but i felt a bit odd walking around in full uniform when everyone else was in grub clothes. o.O  english was so fun!!! we watched seinfeld ALL CLASS!!! much funness!!! two n's? one n? i have no clue.  so anyway, THEN WE WENT TO ISMF!!! AND WE HAD FUN!!!! (capital letters, go away. thank you.)  i was feeling pretty deathly ill all this time so far, which continued for a long time, until halfway through the rehearsal. thank you sin (i used your nickname, cause its damn cool. and you probably won't read this anyway. muahahaha) for taking care of me!!! your shoulder was much more comfortable than the side of the bus. my head is numb *pouts* hehe!  so yes, rehearsal was like rehearsal. *nods* i was faking like mad in the hard parts. *nods again* but my 'stand buddy' was nice and all that, so it was good.  that school was confusing!!! and BIG!!! *shudders* and you wouldn't believe the line up for the bathroom, lol.   i heard lots of people saying good things about my school though, so it was cheerful!  and sin got me cookies and nice, non-chlorine tasting water, so she gets another mention of superbness!!! *nods*  and my medication kicked in, so i was good and well and non-pained and happy. *dances*  the bus ride home was fun. talking to people makes me happy. *nods* especially friends. which makes sense, cause if theyre not friends, i basically don't talk. ooo! logical!!! hehe! some interesting conversations were going on, and it was great stuff. even if ei felt claustrophobic :P   *spreads confetti around for no reason at all*  i get very odd when im hyper. i don't know what was in that medicine i took, but combined with general happiness, it seems to be making me abnormally insane.   *pow*  *giggles*

      i would like to briefly comment that my family is a bunch of mental-deficient, blindly rule obeying idiots. my grandma was wandering around the house for ten minutes calling out for my grandpa. she couldnt find him. it was hillarious. and we have a pretty small house. and then she wanted to highlight that ismf sheet and she's like 'i need a ruler! i can't do this without a ruler! aaah!'.  they are insane.  they are stupid.  they are (unfortunately) my family.  sometimes i question the logic of my parents dumping me on them. i think they need care themselves. it is not easy living with opinionated and opressive people who are going through some sort of weird second childhood. its like having the world run by particularly obstinate two year olds.

      THE WEEK IS OVER!!!!!  that was the week from hell. wait, in a previous entry i said there was no hell. hmmm, the week from a dark, unfriendly, unhappy place? *nods* thats it.  that geo test was    *TERRIBLE*   !!!!!!!!!!!!! and yes, it did deserve all that fancy decoration. i am attempting to emphasize the utter    *TERRIBLENESS*    of it. i am done.  i have a ton of homework to do this weekend. if i made flashcards for my french presentation, so people might actually have a clue what im talking about, would that ake me look silly? or very well prepared? do i care? can i afford that much time? all these are very important questions.  i just got back from skating for the first time in over a year. my legs hurt and i feel very out of shape. *sigh* BUT! i know how to jump still!!! *grins* spins are a different matter. i seem to have lost all my flexibility. *pouts*   and i saw dakota!!! *grins* (quick backstory update: i used to help out at teaching little kids to skate. i quit earlier this year. dakota was a girl in the group i was with last year.) ya, so that was fun.  the fact that my little icon of saint anne is wearing a red cloak i take as a pre-ordaining of the fact that red would be my favourite colour. coincidence??? i think not!!!  i think its funny that right now i am having both a serious scientific theory conversation and a completely silly conversation about padded walls. i'se got multiple personalites i think O.o  *hits you on the head with a dandelion* you paying attention? good good.  a rough translation of the subject name  "Entschuldigen Sie mich, aber Sie traten gerade auf mein Herz" -->"Excuse me, but you just stepped straight on my heart"  i like that. something about it just appeals to me. the amount of politeness in it makes me laugh. i have visions of this little timid man in a business suit tapping the shoulder of this giant in a business suit and saying it in this apologetic little voice with a little "sorry to trouble you but" wince on his face. i dont knwo why the business suits. it just seems formal somehow.  my mind is odd.  "Mon Dieu! Il y a une hache dans ma tete!"   until next time, i remain moderately yours, Anne.

       My Opa's Story: War From the Other Side   Siegfried, my opa, or grandfather in English, was born on the northern coast of Germany, while his father was off fighting in World War One. He undoubtedly grew up hearing about that war and the restrictions put in place on Germany by the Allies after the war.  When Siegfried was a grown man, he heard all Hitler promised, and thought it sounded good. There was a depression, Hitler promised jobs; people were poor, Hitler promised riches; people hated being restricted by laws placed on Germany after the First World War, Hitler promised freedom. All in all, it sounded rather wonderful. Siegfried learned about Hitler's plan for the extermination of the 'undesirable peoples', though. This changed his mind about Hitler's regime. Jobs, prosperity and freedom were important, but they weren't so important as to kill people.  Nevertheless, when invasions and war broke out, Siegfried joined the army. It wasn't that he wanted to go defend the Motherland. He had all he needed already: a carpentry business, a wonderful pregnant wife and a home he loved. It was basically a choice of enlist or be shot or sent to a concentration camp. That's what happened to people who resisted.  Firstly, he was sent to invade Poland. He was a Sargeant and set up anti-aircraft guns. After the success of this invasion, he was sent to Manheim, where he set up guns an top of houses to shoot down Allied planes that came over to bomb. He developed a technique that was quickly adopted as being very effective at shooting down as many planes as possible.  But now there was a new front to be sent to. Siegfried was sent to Russia to be part of the infamous siege of Moscow. Since the men were not given proper supplies for a Russian winter, many froze to death. The ammunition and tanks froze up and could not be used. Siegfried didn't want to die. He injured his knee and complained about it, saying he could hardly walk. His friend played up his stutter so that the officers thought he had shell shock. Their efforts were successful and they were both shipped back to Germany. They were the only two from their unit who survived.  Meanwhile, back home, Siegfried's wife, my oma Else, had given birth to a baby boy in the winter of 1940. There were bombs raining down every night on their town. My father remembers that one night he was hustled into the cellar, clutching his favourite stuffed dog toy. All through the night bombs and guns could be heard. When the morning came, he climbed out to see the entire town in flames around him.  My father was sent to his great-grandparents farm out in the country, where he would be safer.   My great-grandfather fought in World War One. He was gassed and shot in the throat, so he couldn't breathe very well and was therefore not drafted to go fight in World War Two. He stayed behind and worked in the police force instead. But later in the war, even he, an old, infirm man was drafted and imediately put in charge of a unit to defend his town from the invading Russians. Who was under his command? Young boys of no more than 14 years, armed with old rifles and rusting sabres. The glorious last defense.  The German army was desperate at the end of the war. Out of all the 40 000 men who had gone out in U-boats, only one in four returned. Have you heard of the Hitler Youth? It was an organization put in place by the Nazis to indoctrinate the youth of the country and prepare them for military service. In 1939 their numbers were 7 million. As the war progressed, they started to draft this children, because they were running out of soldiers. In 1945, only 5000 remained.  My oma was drafted in 1944, along with her sister. They were sent to Russia to dig trenches against the Russians.  When Siegfried got off the train back from Russia, all the men, whether they were wounded or not, were rounded up and formed into a new unit. They were packed off to defend against the Allied invasion in France. Siegfried was in charge of an anti-aircraft gun, with a group of newly-drafted boys, ranging in age from 13 to 15. He told them to always stay undercover when the planes came and follow all orders. But they were very young and very frightened. Whenever the planes came they panicked. Within two weeks they were all dead.  My opa was switched to setting up communications lines. Two days before the war ended, he was checking telephone wires when an American plane swooped down and bombed his jeep. He was thrown with the force of the blast and had his head smashed in. He was taken prisioner by the Americans at the end of the war, but released later and passed himself off as a short-order cook and worked for the American army. It was a way to get food, which was in short supply.  Back in their hometown, my oma and my father were reunited. They were in the part of Germany that was occupied by the Russians, later to become East Germany. The next two winters were the coldest ones that anyone could remember and food was scarce. They went to a friend's farm, where Else sewed clothes and my father, a child of 6, helped with the harvest. The machines would go along, and the children would walk behind, picking up every stray grain. Nothing could afford to be wasted.  When they went back to the city, Else began to sew clothes for the Russian officers, who would give her food in return. They could make a living, but they wanted to be with Siegfried, who was in West Germany.  Siegfried left for Canada in 1952. He built a house and found another carpentry job. This was the land of opportunity that Germany and ceased to be. He sent a letter to tell Else and Wolfgang to come. It wasn't so easy to get out of East Germany, but they were ready to try. They left with a group of others from their village and skirted round the mines in the minefield in the dead of night. They ran away frantically when the soldiers started shooting at them. Else and Wolfgang made it out, but many people had been killed by exploding mines or shot.   They found passage on a boat to Canada and embarked with 10 dollars and one small suitcase. The ship was a livestock transport ship though, with an area poorly partitioned off for the passengers. There was no bunk for Wolfgang, so he slept on the floor, where all the waste from the livestock area found its way under the partition. The passengers weren't allowed on deck, so for three weeks they stayed in their bunkroom with one toliet for them, seasick people and animal refuse. (Is it any wonder that this ship sunk a year later?)  In 1993, my oma Else died. She had spent her life as a seamstress, and died of cancer and Alzeimer's Disease. At the end of her life, she was disoriented and didn't know her own family. Her stomach cancer was likely caused by metals and poisons in the food she ate and cooking utensils used in the time she lived in East Germany.  Four years later, my opa Siegfried died. He spent his life as a carpenter. After Else died, he went downhill and downcast. He couldn't remember things either and said strange things. He had cancer as well, but he recovered. Finally he succumbed to the disease many old people die of, pneumonia. He died the day before my father's birthday, and two days before mine. The house he built has now been sold, the small suitcase sits in the basement, but their memory lives on.

       To dust   To know fully once and for all  That it does not matter Would be something I might consider Selling my soul for  When I think another thought I’ll reconsider  We all die without knowing Why we lived  And we thought that second place Was so very inferior That we lusted and killed  Only for a trophy  That quickly turned  To dust  Why bother thinking of tragedy When it presents itself to you Every day  In yet another time we may yet come to realize Everyone matters For we all have a purpose That we founder in finding   Meanwhile senselessness rules the world And as yet we are still  Alone    ok, so that was the poeticness. comment! anything! tell me its terrible! i dont care! feedback is good!  and i had something to say, stemming from history class today, but turning into a general rant about various second world war stories, but i didnt want to sound like a bigoted nazi pig.   so i didnt write it.  all i will say is history always looks different from the other side. being german i hate all the misconceptions and things people believe, even to this day. yes, my grandparents fought for germany in BOTH world wars, but that doent make them bad people. one time i remember a veteran came in to speak to us and talked about how he was glad he killed so many germans and how the germans were evil and how they deserved to die. (i realize not all veterans are like this, in fact, the greatest majority are good, fine, nice people.) but that really bugged me. i think its important to realize the difference between the nazis and the general german public. the nazis were the ones who were 'evil', if anyone can truely be branded as evil and not misguided. not only was the general german public brainwashed, but if they didn't enlist they got killed or sent to work camps. in other words they were FORCED. of course, many people say they should have resisted, but if you were in the same postion i doubt you'd have done any different. so that veteran annoyed me. he was talking about my grandparents deserving to die. and they didnt. if that had been a german veteran who came and said things like that about the Allies, i bet they would have been hussled off the stage and it would have been apologized profusely for weeks. the winning side always gets to write the history books. it feels so different from the losers perspective. my english grandparents talk about how terrible rationing was in england during and after the war, but they werent starving, like the other side of family was. and they certainly didnt get locked behind the iron curtain afterwards. they didnt even fight! and they were of an age to! my opa was in charge of units of 14 year old boys, who died because they had no training. but thats all that was left at the end of the war to defend their homes. and their homes werent destroyed, like my fathers was. bitter? of course. i should post my family history thing i wrote here.  darn. i wrote it.   hmmm, i wonder if i keep this up, what will happen?  don't kill me.  don't be superbly mad.  do argue sensibly.  *is nervous*  i hate speaking up, cause people in my family almost alwys yell at me if i dont agree with them.

      So I will be filling in again. No, it's no use running away. You cannot run from content, it will just follow you. Unless, of course, you lock yourself up in a padded room with nothing but reality TV re-runs. Then I can't quite reach you. But I wouldn't recommend such drastic measures. They can turn nasty. You might end up with no brain. And that's no fun.  Pink is the root of all evil. Shorts are also high up there. Pink shorts are to be homicidally attacked on sighting. Do not ask questions. Just destroy. The only people who wear pink shorts are insanely evil. In fact, all the evil forces in this universe of universes wear pink. After the invention of the little black dress, it was decided that black had become far too common as the instrumental clothing of darkness. So now, to be truely evil, you must wear pink. The evil clothing lords are cunningly converting the masses to their evil ways by selling pink clothes as 'cute' and 'cheerful'. Nothing could be farther from the truth. You have been warned.  Audrey Hepburn was hoped to have been the saviour of the colour black. She was approached by the evil side about supporting them in her little black dresses and thereby stopping the advent of the evil pink masses. She fought them off single-handedly with her cigarette holder and funny hat, then went to have breakfast at an over-priced jewelry store. This has been proven to have inadvertedly caused the end of the universe. How, it is not quite certain and the present moment.    The content provided by the Content Creator has now ended. We thank you for your patience.

      well today was a total waste of perfectly good oxygen.  i did elaborate more on this theme, but it got deleted, so why bother.  i think life doesnt like me.  *looks up at sky*  Whatever did I do to you?  (nothing but perfect grammar for whatever's running the universe. although i did not attempt to hide the extreme malice, anger and bitterness that was in there. but you might not have got that. the internet has that effect.)  that is all.

      i thought i was getting better, but then my cold came back and has decided to morph into some odd perverted type of flu. *glares at it*  and its going to my brain. i havent been able to think straight for ages. ive been trying to do my mountain of homework, but its not working... *cries*   so much history and science...  *light flashes on above anne's head*  next week i have a spare cause all the music people are going to boston and leaving me behind!!! i must use it to work amazingly hard on history which i have not done this weekend!!  i feel better now. so i will quit while i am ahead.  starting to fall... asleep....   The usual writer of entries in this blog has apparently fallen asleep. Due to the fact that she is rather sickly at the moment, it is probably best that she is not woken up to continue typing. Whatever she would type would not likely make much sense. You, gracious reader, shall be spared this. I, in my capacity as Content Crafter, shall be filling in for her since I do not think that this post has yet reached a sufficient length to qualify for Official Post Status.  From this moment on, all content is my own.  Thank you,  The Content Crafter    The Cast of Characters in Anne's Life   Today, we bring you a special feature specializing in profiling various people and things and 'others' which inhabit Anne's life.   PEOPLE    Family:  Generally refered to by Anne as 'them', it is a myth that she hates them all. In fact, she quite likes her second cousin and can tolerate her great aunt and uncle quite well. She spends a lot of time with her family and has become quite trained in being civil to them. I am sure you will all be pleased to know that Anne's grandmother has not been found to have the long, slow and deadly disease that it was suspected she might have had. Anne is denying reports that she ever wished a slow and painful death on her grandmother. She maintains that a quick, painless death is far more humane and achieves the same result. She now is denying that she ever wished anyone a quick, painless death. Anne is a very odd person.   Freinds:  Yes, the proper spelling of these people is freinds, not the more commonly used "friends". Do not question the Content Crafter. You have been warned. Well, most of these people have their own websites or journals or blogs where you can go find out about them. That is suggested. They are all very nice people, if occasionally slightly odd. Anne loves them all very much and often wonders whatever she would do without them.   NOT QUITE PEOPLE    The Faulty Logic Fairy:  This fairy occasionally preys on Anne and her friends and certain world leaders. She is not really evil, just mischevous and slightly sadistic in the fact that she revels in the destruction and misunderstanding she causes.    The Content Crafter:  This would be me. I occasionally give Anne inspiration or fill in for her when she passes out sick. *glances over at her* Hmph. I am overworked and severely underpaid. I have considered striking, but I think that might lead to me being fired. The thought of a world with no content makes me shudder. The Supreme Council has already scaled back my duties and influence an incredible amount and look what has happened. I mean, you have 'Survivor' and 'Extreme Makeover: Home Edition'. That's frightening to me.   DEITIES    The Weather Gods:  The relationship between Anne and these higher powers is a classic example of 'love-hate'. The Weather Gods consistently deny Anne her most fervent wish for a snow day for many weeks, then grant it to her on her favourite and most looked forward to day. Anne often curses them. The Weather Gods have also been known to throw Anne off their sacred cloud on many occasions. One particular occasion that comes to mind is when Anne started to campaign for a massive electrical blackout day, instead of her usual snow day plea. The Weather Gods objected to this because she wasn't applying to the correct department, so they chucked her over the edge of the cloud. She has been rather sour ever since.   The Minor Theft Gods:  Although it has been proved that these petty deities did not in fact steal Anne's beloved calculator, they are undoubtedly responsible for the loss of many things such as: numerous pairs of socks, hair elastics and her sanity. They are being investigated, but they are rather tricky characters and it is doubtful they will ever be convicted. They have a nasty habit of returning the things they took right after you have gone out and bought a replacement.   The Propaganda Gods:  After an intensive study in both English and History classes, the following scientific conclusion about the Propaganda Gods has been made: they mess with your head.   OTHER OMNIPRESENT ENTITIES    The Management:  The ever-present and ingratiating presence that generally apologizes for Anne's actions. She would like to that them apologize for any inconvience caused. She steadfastly refuses to pay you for your services on the grounds that she never asked you to tag around with her anyways. She would like to add that the previous statement was not meant to offend and that she really appreciates the work that they do. She also refuses to acknowledge that lawsuit you are now dangling in front of her face. Thank you for your time. Good bye.   The content supplied by the Content Creator has now ended.   Anne is waking up. She is mumbling something about radioactive cows. Oh dear. "Silly radioactive cows, no sitting on the three-headed monkey!".   "Why don't you go be normal, Anne?"  "Normal is boring."  Fair enough I suppose.  She is now looking in her homework diary at the amount of homework she has. She is now uttering some obscene curses which I shall omit from my record. I do not think the Weather Gods would appreciate their names being used in this context.   Anne appears to be deciding not to do her Math homework. She appears to be going back to sleep. I think I shall leave her to it.   Luckily for you, this entry has now surpassed Official Entry status, so I need not write anymore. I will go continue work on my masterpiece : A Tomato in a Communist Convention. If you have missed the humour in that it is suggested that you go get checked for red-green colour blindness and political party colour affiliation intelligence.  Thank you.  Goodnight. Or whatever it is where you live.   The supplementary content provided by the Content Creator has now ended.

      i think i have a cold. my throat feels incredibly scratchy. and my nose feels all funny. and my head hurts. and i feel weak. it is possible i may die. or not. i am going with the not for now, but will keep you posted on further developments.  i think my headphones just died. or at least half of them did. there is only sound coming out of one of the ear things. i feel lopsided. this is not good.  so here is a survey, because i am far from original.   1: Grab the book nearest to you, turn to page 18, find line 4. Write down what it says:   Of maistres hadde he mo than thries ten,   translated to modern english: "He had more than thirty lawyers to provide for"  its "The Canterbury Tales" by Geoffery Chaucer!!! yay for medieval novels!    2: Stretch your left arm out as far as you can. What do you touch first?  a newspaper article that i cut out of the paper for an ecology project   3: What is the last thing you watched on TV?  some utterly mindless stupid sitcom that was on. i watched it because it was the only thing on and my brain was fried from homework which i didnt want to finish. i am suprised i was allowed to watch it. there was only one good line,  "ooo! You made a baby guillotine!"  dont ask.   4: WITHOUT LOOKING, guess what the time is:  !@#$ i unconsciously looked! something about the word time just makes my search for the nearest clock. im sorry. it feels like 4:15pm, but its not.   5: Now look at the clock, what is the actual time?:  4:39 pm i was off by a lot.   6: With the exception of the computer, what can you hear?:  does music coming rather lopsidedly from the computer count? if not, then nothing actually. i am trying to drown out the silence with music. O.o   7: When did you last step outside? What were you doing?:  i got out of the car to walk inside. i havent been outside for more than a minuteor two for 5 months or something. it was hallowe'en. wow... thats ages. no wonder i feel so unhealthy. O.o i need fresh air!   8: Before you came to this website, what did you look at?:  um, everyone else's blogs... and i tried to talk to someone on msn, but they left. *cries*   9: What are you wearing?:  my school uniform.   10: Did you dream last night?:  i dont remember if i did   11: When did you last laugh?:  geo class was funny today.    12: What is on the walls of the room you are in?:  nothing. i have bare walls in my bedroom. although they have pale green paint clinging desperately on.   13: Seen anything weird lately?:  oh. so. much.   14(a): What book are you currently reading?:  "The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams   14(b): What is the last book you finished?:  "The Mists of Avalon" by Marion Zimmer Bradley   15: What is the last film you saw?:  "Good Bye Lenin!" go go go!!!! see see see!!!! *nods*   16: If you became a multi-millionaire overnight, what would you buy first?:  headphones that work.    17: Tell me something about you that I don't know:  you know nothing. where shall i start? um, i have a broken tape measure on my desk. hows that?   18: If you could change one thing about the world, regardless of guilt or politics, what would you do?:  i would make war impossible and illegal. wait, does that count as political? hmph. well, i cant think of anything else. ... oh wait! yes i can! no more building those pointless and huge ugly subdivisions. especially not on the oak ridges moraine or in my township. preferably not in my country. or my world. but thats a large goal.    19: Do you like to dance?:  not particularly   20: What is the last thing you ate or drank?  i had lunch. so lunch-like stuff. i am going to go have medication in a couple minutes though. stupid cold. i hate echinacea (sp?). it tastes bad.   21(a): Imagine your first child is a girl, what do you call her?:  Lazuli   21(b): Imagine your first child is a boy, what do you call him?:  Aidan   22: Would you ever consider living abroad?:  Of course. ENGLAND!!!!!!!!! *grins* but i think i will stay here. canada is good too. i ♥ canada a million times over. and over. and over again. and a few more times. and then some more.

      i watched the junos a few nights ago. that was fun. i liked watching my grandma make her little 'i am absolutely disgusted' faces whenever anyone who wasnt a classical musican came on. there was only one classical performer.   i hate popo-up ads. they are rather elusive though. but the other type of ad which i hate is pop-ups. i have a pop-up ad blocker which has blocked 485 pop-up ads in a month or two. crazy insane. is there any other type of insane? i guess not  and, just for music students, my cat prays to jesus! hahahaha. that was funny.  i am ignoring your befuddled stares.  if you continue to give me looks like that i will stop typing.  im warning you.  you have been warned.  thank you for stopping.  i have run out of things to say.  so i guess this is goodbye then.   goodbye.    then.       This entry originally had a point, but it has temporarily escaped the writer's mind. We would like to apologize for any inconvience this (and the blatant theft of the last line directly out of Douglas Adams' work, 'The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy') may cause. We would like to also stress the fact that you read this under your own volition, and therefore any medical (physical or mental) problems you develop as a result of reading this are strictly your own fault. We assume no responsibilty whatsoever for your foolhardy actions.   Thank you,  The Management

      I do not know what to enscribe here. Nothing is occurring in my life that could be construed as anything remotely resembling fascinating. Which makes me rather sad.   Today, my dad and I drove in the car, van, whatever, to experience the delight that is  urlLink Good Bye, Lenin!" . ...  ... and once again, my mother kicks me off the computer, just as i was on a roll, writing something. grr....

      i took some of my favourite lines from stuff and made one big poem-like thing, adding and changing along the way. im not sure if it all 'works' or no. whatever. it is shockingly depressing and self-pitying. you have been warned.  Broken Collage  I am asleep but so awake Stumbling on alone  Over such a little time The world got so deceiving And I have been left solitary To stand my lonely ground In the middle of nowhere From where I am The heavens seem a little far And God is fast asleep I cannot see I cannot breathe I cannot even cry My soul and heart have fled  There was an end to salvation  With a simple laugh So only my broken shell rests unaided It's as if I'm not here Can you see right through me? For we are all dust in the wind Destined to return forever To the perpetual cycle of sorrow  If only dreams came true And we had an endless second chance I might have happiness returned But in this narrow world There is no room for victories This abandoned fight will never be won For I surrendered long ago So walk right through me And simply forget You never cared, did you?  *many lines and words were mercilessly stolen from various songs and sources, and may or may not have been altered to better fit the context. I do not claim to own them. I simply used sources and moved them into better places to create something new; something like a collage, but with words.   i may be back with more later, or i may not be.  it has not been a good day.

      How's that for an informational title? Change from the ordinary that is.  I'm thinking of getting a new email address. I've this one since grade 8 I think, and yes it would be nice to have a change. But I think I'd lose a lot of contacts and such. *sigh* It might not be worth it, cause I'd have to change many other things. I shall consider it, but I think I'll reject the idea. *ponders*  Hmmm, yes. I have studied about 10 pages for history now. I keep getting distracted, because you know, Canadian history isn't that fascinating. And, yes, this is coming from someone who loves history. World history to the sixteenth century next year! Yayeth! That should be far more fascinating.  An important thing in reaching a goal of 30 000 words would have to be having something to say. Because if you don't have anything to say, you most likely won't write anything making it rather impossible to reach this goal.  Or you could just write about the fact that you have nothing to say.   But after awhile that gets rather boring after awhile.  Ah. I see you can also repeat words. Well that was more like a phrase. But you know what I mean, right? Exactly.  Hmmmmm.... Let's see....  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!  RADIOACTIVE COW!!!!!! RIGHT BEHIND YOU!!!!! FLYING AROUND OUTSIDE THE WINDOW WITH THE THREE HEADED MONKEY!!!!!   Now how often do you see that happen? Too bad you missed it. (hehehe)  Oh yes, I got a free hosting account and all that at a place with no ads or anything! *grins* So now all I gotta do is make a website. I forget whether I've talked about this before, but I suppose it bears repeating.  Right, now I have instructions for you. They are very important and you must follow them to the very exactness of the consonants and vowels to prevent certian world destruction.  1) Go outside and find dandelions. You are looking for the greyish white fuzzy type.  2) Very good, you found dandelions. Now for the Ziploc bag (probably a registered trademark, but my Typing a Special Symbol on the Computer Skills are rather deficent, so I can't be expected to put the little TM up. Please imagine it is there. Thank you.) Take out the large Ziploc bag that you have of course brought with you because no self-respecting person leaves the house without a Ziploc bag.   3) Right, go back and get the Ziploc bag.  4) Remember to bring them along with you next time.   5) Now, take the Ziploc bag and open it and stuff in it all the grey-ish white dandelions. Take out the spare Ziploc bag you brought with you because you were so very prepared and stuff in a few of the normal yellow ones.  6) Go back to your house and buy airplane tickets to every site that houses nuclear weapons. Yes, you did hear me right.  7) Right, first do research on where aforementioned nuclear weapons storage facilities are located. The internet offers a wealth of information that I'm sure major governments don't really want there.   8) Try to be more prepared next time you are called upon to save the world.  9) Alright. Now when you get to each one of these places you are to find a guard with pollen allergies and open the Ziploc bag with the yellow dandelions in it, then shove it in the guard's face. They will collapse helplessly sneezing and coughing up lungs and such.  10) Steal their uniform and security clearance things. If you are feeling ambitious you can steal a few valuables such as a gold watch, diamond ring, etc. These can be used as bribes later on. It is suprising what people will do for a gold watch.  11) Find where the nuclear weapons are stored and scatter some dandelions seeds around.  12) Run away and repeat until you have done this in every place where nuclear weapons are stored.  And there you have it; A Twelve Step Plan to World Peace With Dandelions as the Only Weapon.  You see, dandelions are very hardy and persistent plants. They will grow almost anywhere and multiply amazingly, resisting all attempts to eradicate them.  Since basic human nature is to despise these adorable flowers (the author has surmounted this rather antiquated philosophy) the world powers will be completely possessed with a need to get rid of the dandelions. This will cause them to forget about using the nuclear weapons, instead forging alliances with former foes to destroy these much more virulent dandelions.  Of course, if the dandelions somehow get onto the nuclear weapons and start to break them down, there would be no real problem posed by the nuclear weapons. Except for some leaky radiation, but that would actually be beneficial, since everyone knows that when exposed to radiation, creatures become rather fearful and superhuman. This would simply heighten the effect of the dandelions. The world leaders afflicted by these pesky, super-plant dandelions would have a real cause to band together against a common foe.  There you have it. As you can clearly see, dandelions are the answer to the worlds problems. At least of the nuclear weapon sort. There are of course all sorts of other things like world hunger and large epidemics of virulent diseases, but since these tend to occur only in  'developing countries' and the author currently residing in a rather 'developed' country, the author will follow the example of her most excellent 'Leaders of the Free World' and simply turn a blind eye.

      I have no words to describe how happy I am that the week is over.  So I won't waste precious space on trying to find them.  So anyways, a couple days ago I found my book of the prophecies of Nostradamus which I bought awhile ago when I was obsessive over that kind of thing. Some of the stuff is really spookily accurate, to steal a desciption from one of the reviews on the back. But then again, since he didn't really give much real information, just cryptic and metaphorical little verses, you could make them fit to anything. So it just seems spookily accurate.  And now for a random Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy quote, just because I can.  "The ships hung in the sky in much the same way bricks don't."  Hehehe...  I would like it very much if random people did not simply walk into my room and stand by the window for ten minutes not saying anything. *glares* Ah. Then they turn around and talk to me for another ten minutes. I don't understand this. I'm not looking at you, I'm not answering anything you're saying, could it be any clearer that I'm not listening? I would listen if it were something important like 'The house is burning down!' or if something really important or fascinating had happened in the world, but I really don't care that there is a new car on the neighbours driveway or someone is cutting down a tree in their yard. And I certainly don't care to hear you going through every single possibility of why they might be doing whatever meaningless little task they are.  My family talks too much. I think I did some sort of timing thing once. I talk about 5% out of all the talking done in my house. Most of the time I figure there's not much point in saying anything. They're so inlove with the sound of their own voices that they don't listen anyway. And then I have repeat everything and it just gets tedious. Most of the time I don't have anything remotely important or earth-shattering or entertaining to say either, so I try to lead by example and not say anything.  Obviously it's not working.  I'm going to try to download Good Bye Lenin! from another (faster) place. I gave up on the 189 hour thing. The more I downloaded the more hours it said it would take.  Ha! I was right about my presentation being the worst part of my history trunk project, cause that's where I got my two marks off. I still got 98% overall, so wheeee! I'm happy.  Oh, and yes French was boring today. I gave up on actually doing the work awhile in and just watched Ei blog and S play odd computer games. Then I got to build one nuclear power plant and a port in SimCity, when I was accused of having bad strategy. *slaughters S* And it was time to go anyway.  Hmmmmm, yes, history was silly today. But rather amusing. *giggles*  We started a new unit in geo. Seriously, what the hell? We have THREE classes left! A WHOLE new unit in that short of a time? River systems better not be that complicated.  LimeWire is telling me must I restart my computer. (I got the new version.)   *obeys the LimeWire god*  *remembers to post first (aren't you proud of me?)*  *goes off to get ginger ale and potato chips*

      Right, so I have something to say. I'd really like it if you all listened. Not that you really have to, of course. I wouldn't want to force anyone to do anything. That's just not nice. I don't like being forced to do anything myself, so I wouldn't inflict that on you. But like I said I'd like it if somebody listened for a change. See there's only so much talking to yourself that you can do. I've always found I'm a good listener, but I don't tend to reply to myself. I also don't give very good advice. I suppose a degree of seperation would help, but I'm not about to develop a multiple personality disorder simply so I can give myself good advice. That would be rather pointless in a way. Although I suppose with having a real problem like that I would have more to talk about than just these other ones which might or might not actually be real. Maybe nothing is real at all though. Wouldn't that be odd?  I forgot what it was I was going to say.  This is my day in a nutshell, in reverse chronological order, because that's the sort of logic that we've been using in Guidance as of late. (See where it's got me? I've only become more confused with Guidance. That was most likely not supposed to happen.)  1) I started writing this. 2) I ate dinner. It was nothing exciting. 3) I got home from the Doctor's. 4) I was in the Doctor's office, not getting a blood test. Suprise, suprise. He went for the other stereotypical Doctor answer and said, 'Nothing to worry about, most likely a viral infection. It should clear up.'  5) I came home from school in a bad mood. 6) I drew a circle. 7) I finished my Science work with half of the period left. Since no one was sitting beside me to talk to, I started drawing a circle. 8) I had lunch. It was very lunch-like. 9) I had French. It was very French-like. 10) Three people jumped from a plane above our school. 11) I had History. I decided I need to study for History soon.  12) I had recess. I don't remember anything that happened. 13) I had Geography. I learnt that there is a limit to how fascinating Alpine Glaciation can be. 14) I did my French homework. 15) I got to school. 16) I woke up and did stuff to get ready for school like eating breakfast.  Yes. Now, as promised The Greatest Party Ever Known to the History of Mankind.  This is a modified version of another spur of the moment conversation Ei and I had on msn. It's been prettied up into a coherent piece of writing.  Cartwheels  High-jumps  Fire eaters  Confetti  Rice  Dancing in the streets  Fireworks (*boom*)  Doves released  Flags flown high and waved by crowds  Celebratory rock concert  Gigantic birthday cake  Christmas lights lit all over country  Gigantic menorah erected  Large choirs sing rousing choruses  Easter eggs are scattered about  Cupid wanders around shooting people  Hearts float around  Large tomato fight  Ceremonial dwarf throwing  Bulls running down streets trampling innocent bystanders  Candy thrown around  Champagne fountains  Wine flowing like water  Lemonade fountains for minors  Chocolate bars line the streets  Sacrifices held on mountain tops in the moonlight  Incense burned throughout the land  Candlesticks light up the countryside  Militaristic parades  Marching bands  Nuclear weapons paraded around  Army marches around firing guns  Red carpet rolled out  Large security force hired  Television exclusive secured  Very important person person comes out on balcony and waves  Adoring masses faint from all this excitement  ------------------  Right I blocked out this space down here to say something, but honest, I forgot again. My memory is really getting bad.   Maybe I should have asked permission to put that in here. Ah well. If you really object, I'll take it out again.  RANDOM BABBLING!!!!  Let's see...  urlLink Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Movie!!!!  *hearts* *more hearts* *even more hearts* *Anne runs out of hearts and collapses from lack of blood circulation*  And... umm...  urlLink Good Bye Lenin!  *Anne takes out some spare hearts* *hearts*  Why has my grandmother spent the last hour and a half on the phone? I suppose it might have something to do with the fact that she never shuts up. Yes, I know that sounds mean, but have you ever talked to my grandma? Ah, the ones who have are nodding their heads knowledgeably. I suggest you go talk to them.  *thinks* *brain starts to hurt* *Anne stops*  I'm proud of myself cause I found my Tarot cards. Of course, I promptly misplaced one of my CD cases. I suppose the equilibrium, or whatever, must be maintained. I can't be permitted to find too many things. It might cause the Earth to self-destruct. *nods* And we wouldn't want that to happen. Unless we were suicidal, Earth-hating people. Hopefully that's not the case. No hating the Earth. I want you to go out and hug a tree right now! Very good. Thank you. Now go hug the random passerby who was looking at you strangely.  Ooooo! I have a Good Bye Lenin poster! Yayeth! Well, it's really just a sheet of paper. But it says 'Good Bye Lenin!' on it, so we'll call it a poster for 'Good Bye Lenin!', shall we?   Anyways, I am downloading the  urlLink trailer . *curses dial-up for a brief moment* *continues to wait* *thinks she'll clarify the poster thing*  It's the actual poster. But I printed it out on a 8.5 X 11 sheet of paper. So it's the poster, but it's reallt just a sheet of paper. If that makes any sense. If it makes sense, could you please explain it to me, because I don't understand what I just wrote.  Yay!  Ummm, that would have been random happiness.  It's an odd thing.  I have run out of things to say.  Here's hoping that this entry doesn't turn the template green again.

      Hey! I AM alive and all, despite a long absence (for me anyway) from updating.  Does anyone else keep getting that '404 Not Found' error message when trying to see anyone's blog that is on blogspot? Cause I do, and it's annoying. *frowns in blogspot's general direction*   Toulla ruoska roiskuaapi, nahkaruoskaa roiskuaa  siella vitsaa vinguttapi, vivi vivi vivi vivi vinguttaa   Right. That's a random Finnish song lyric for you. There's a missing 'a with the two dots on top' in there, because I have no clue how to type it.  We got an election now! YAY! *ahem* Sorry. I think I was one of the only people who found Civics interesting.  Ummm, let's see... what to say that's remotely interesting.  Let's give up on remotely interesting and just go for saying anything at all. Hey, enough people do it already.  Hey Ei! Guess what I'm listening to as I type this!  Haha. We had to write a French poem and it's like "If you were music, what would you be?". And since I couldn't think of anything, I put "Music of all genres", which makes me feel like a bit of an empty-headed idiot. Ah well, at least I'm an empty-headed idiot with a wide taste in music.  I'm sure at least some of you will be glad to hear that I am going to the doctor tomorrow, cause of feeling sick all the time. I am unfortunately not so excited. It is hard to be all excited and good feeling about blood tests. I will get a blood test. Whenever I go to the doctor's I seem to have to get a blood test.   Doctor: (all excited) Ok, blood test for you! Me: But I have a cold! Doctor: Ah, but we can't be certain of that, now can we? Just to make sure: BLOOD TEST!!!! (jumps on innocent Anne with a needle)  I think he may be a vampire.  And I always bruise so badly with needles too. *cries* I'm gonna have this huge painful bruise on my arm for WEEKS!!!! I don't heal very easily. I mean, I cut myself on my leg last August, and it hasn't healed yet. *pouts*  Hmmm, let's now say something completely different.  Alright, going back to the election campaign. Our local Liberal candidate was standing outside a gun shop this morning holding a big sign saying "Vote for (Whatever his name is...Lui Temevolski or something like that)" and waving at the cars. The funny thing is the drivers were all distracted and started swerving and such.  Conclusion: Our local Liberal candidate may be in need of a brain.  Hmmm, ok, I have French homework and various other things calling my name right now, and I apologize to this little box where I am typing this in, but these other people have more appealing voices and better bribes to listen to them than you do.  I assure you, it's nothing personal.  Except, in a way, it is.

      Today was another good day. But not for yesterday's reasons. This for the wonderful reason of...  I AM DONE MY HISTORY AND GEO PROJECTS AND IT IS A LONG WEEKEND AND I AM HAPPY!!!!  *nods*  A Very Good Reason indeed.  Ummm... yes. I was incredibly nervous doing my history presentation. I hate having to talk in front of the class. *shivers and faints* I forgot to say a lot of stuff, but ah well. It's over. It's scary to have all those people watching you.... *cries*  Right, so I have to clean up the messy desk I talked about yesterday. If I'm not at school on Tuesday, that's what I'll still be doing.  There's a lot of season finales on today. I beleive that they are paving the way for the rather terrible summer television season.  I also get to see my parents this weekend, so I am excited.  QUIZ RESULT CAUSE I'M LAZY!!!    You are Linus!    urlLink   Which Peanuts Character are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    So... I think that may be it.  Yes, that's definitely all I can think of to say.  *runs away still superbly happy*

      I wish to write an entry. I have absolutely nothing in my mind to talk about though, so this could be very odd. Tons of stuff happened today and lots of it were good, but I don't really feel like writing it all out.  Hmm. Look at my last sentence. Can you spot the evidence that I've been talking to English people too much on msn? *giggles* (I don't know why I just giggled. Probably too much chocolate. *nods*)   I should probably be plodding on with my tackling of gradational forces for geography right now, or at least writing a silly French poem. But both options are rather unappealing.   I think I will describe my desk instead.  My desk has a computer, a lamp and a printer. The printer is actually on its own desk. It's a rather big printer you see. And noisy. And moderately tempermental. *nods* *hugs her printer just for the hell of it* *printer glares at her and goes off to sulk unsociably*   Fine.  Ok, so then there's all the lovely clutter on my desk. I haven't really cleaned up all year. There's open pencil cases, random CD's in search of their cases which are stranded and drowning in a different region entirely, and various dictionaries scattered around old newspapers. We must not forget the seas of disorganized papers piling up and flowing around the rather scuffed up surface of the desk. They are massively important. Let's analyze them!  That's an article on lakes in Northern Manitoba. That's my study notes for a history test in November. That's a note on career planning. That's a sheet of song lyrics with my random scribbles of very odd sayings. Let's type a few of them in here!  "The world has gone for a swim, and know what, I think I'll jump in." "Decoupage clair." And then there's something in Russian. (I know Russian? What?)  Ok. Let's stop this now. It's getting silly.  My god! I found my necklace! Wow. I thought I'd lost that forever! *hugs her necklace* *is even more happy*  *goes and cartwheels off exuding happiness*

      Blogger is seriously messing with my mind. I was all happy and such things as I got home from school today which was unusual, then it made me mad.  It really seems to like the green template better than the white one.  I'm not kidding.  It's just randomly switching between the two.  This is more conclusive evidence that the internet is an animate entity and unfortunately it is using its powers for evil.   Today has been quite odd. Various people are almost certianly trying to make me insane.  *glares at the world*

      Look at that!!! The title relates to the post!!! Isn't that amazing??? *grins*  Ok, well... it is to me.  The Blogger Gods have decided to mess up my template. Why is it now lime green? How can I fix this? I want my lovely white and black template back. *wails pathetically*  And now on to more interesting topics.  The dandelion is completly dead now. *cries* i think I need to get them in the sugar water much sooner after I have picked them. But there are no dandelions to be had at home thanks to the rather vicious use of harmful and terrible pesticides by my perfectionist grandfather, and I can hardly go walking around the school with a bowl of sugar water, picking dandelions.  The concert went well!  I am almost done my grandfather's trunk project. Is anyone actually going to dress up to present it? Because I have this dress of my mother's that my grandfather made for her that i'm using for the 1960's item, but I don't know if I should wear it or not. I think I'll see what other people do.  We have these little ant traps all over the house, but I have yet to actually see an ant stupid enough to go climb into one of them. I wonder why humans think that other animals are so very stupid as to climb into little metal boxes that smell of poison and have the dead and poisoned corpses of their more un-intelligent species littered in them and just outside them. What we're really doing is just making sure the most intelligent ones do survive and propogate the species and all that, making the entire ant population smarter and less likely to actually go into the little metal boxes of death.   It's really rather stupid.  Besides, ants are cute. And we all know that they can survive being killed many times over if they have a remarkably intelligent grain of sand as a pet.

      Hello!  (That was for Fernando , who commented on my blog earlier! Welcome!)  So, right now I am doing two things.  1) I am trying to revive a rather weak dandelion flower that I picked outside the school today. It's lying in a bowl of sugar water. It doesn't look like it's going to recover. *cries* Ah well. It kept me company all through science when no one else was really talking to me. I 'll make a little shrine to it when it gets so dead that I have to bury it. Nothing less than the best for a friend.   I think Kelly summed this whole thing up rather well today when she said, "My God, I'm friends with a freak!". I took it as a compliment. I take most insults as compliments. It throws the insulters off track, which is a good thing.  2) I am getting ready to go to the school concert tonight. It should be tons of fun and all that. *nods* Wish us all well!   And I must be off!  *flies away*  *ahem*  *runs away*  That would be more in the realm of possibility.

      Introducing the new and nicer blog template!!!  And Anne's new typing style!!! I'm now using proper grammar. YAY!!!  According to Blogger I have written 25 731 words since January of this year. Wow. And my average amount of posts per week is 7, which makes sense and is a nice number for that sort of thing.    won    That makes me happy. *grins*   Crucify by Tori Amos  (just because I like it, and Ei was asking about her)  Every finger in the room is pointing at me I wanna spit in their faces Then I get afraid what that could bring I got a bowling ball in my stomach I got a desert in my mouth Figures that my courage would choose to sell out now I've been looking for a savior in these dirty streets Looking for a savior underneath these dirty sheets I've been raising up my hands Drive another nail in Just what God needs One more victim Why do we crucify ourselves everyday?  I crucify myself And nothing I do is good enough for you Crucify myself everyday  I crucify myself My heart is sick of bein' I said my heart is sick of bein' in  Chains (oh-oh-oh) Chains (oh-oh-oh) Got a kick for a dog beggin' for love I gotta have my suffering So that I can have my cross I know a cat named Easter He says Will you ever learn? You're just an empty cage girl if you kill the bird. I've been looking for a savior in these dirty streets Looking for a savior beneath these dirty sheets I've been raising up my hands Drive another nail in Got enough guilt to start My own religion Why do we crucify ourselves everyday?  I crucify myself My heart is sick of bein' I said my heart is sick of bein' in  Chains (oh-oh-oh) Chains (oh-oh-oh) Please be Save me I cry (ah-ah ah-ah) Looking for a savior in these dirty streets Looking for a savior beneath these dirty sheets I've been raising up my hands Drive another nail in Where are those angels When you need them? Why do we crucify ourselves everyday?  I crucify myself And nothing I do is good enough for you Crucify myself everyday  I crucify myself My heart is sick of bein' I said my heart is sick of bein' in  Chains (oh-oh-oh) Chains  Why do we... (Why do we) Chains (crucify ourselves?) Crucify ourselves Everyday (Why do we) (crucify ourselves?) Chains... (repeat backing refrain) Never going back again Crucify myself again You know Never going back again to Crucify myself Everyday    And now, onwards to large amounts of a rather pointless history project. I already know a ton about my family history. And most of the stuff for the trunk I am making up anyway to make fit the guidelines. This is a stupid exercise in teacher's simply trying to prove that they can set large, stressful projects.

      Right this was written yesterday after I signed off the internet. (Ah, the glories of Notepad!).  (You do know that the titles bear no meaning to anything whatsoever, don't you? Good.)  Notice... proper punctuation and all! I am thinking about abandoning my minimalist tendancies and going back to typing properly, but I'm not sure about it yet. I may just add in the apostrophes back in. The fact that I devote time to thinking about his sort of thing is rather sad.  If you see me on msn at any time in the next two weeks, kick me off. I need to do work. Please don't send me viruses that will kill my internet though, as that will impair my ability to collect mindless amounts of articles regarding the tectonic and gradational processes that have shaped our world in the past school year, and then talking about them.  *dies*  Ok, I am now going to talk some more about how ill I feel, because I am a generally boring person with not much else to talk about, and besides, it's common knowledge that everyone loves to hear about everyone else's miscellaneous diseases. Did you know that miscellaneous is one of the only words I am never sure if I spelt right? Well, know you are.  I need to go out and pick dandelions and dry them. I love dandelions and I only have a few of them dried on my desk here. They are rather old and faded too. Me want more dandelions. *pouts*  Where did 'humdala' go? They were this weird random commenter on my blog a couple months ago and after they said they were here to stay and add to the discussion, they promptly disappeared. Which I find odd, but not suprising. People have a habit of ducking out of my life right after saying they were not going to go away. It gets rather annoying, because it also means that a lot of the people who say they will go away and leave me alone never do. And then there's a few people who always hang around and I can't get rid of. Which is also annoying. But I've learned to live with it.  Life never sucks, it just needs a different perspective.  And there are no losers either, just different types of winning. For example, you could be really poor and almost starving, but you could have a family who loves you, which is something a lot of people don't have. Or you could be remarkably successful and famous, but have no one who loved you (apart from random screaming fangirls, they don't count).   You can't define success.  Don't give me the example of someone who had nothing going for them, because if you think that there's absolutely nothing good in your life, you're not looking hard enough. There's always something positive, even if it's really small and overlooked.  I seem to have gotten sidetracked.  Well, that was probably more interesting than the originally proposed topic of discussion.   But if a suddenly die at school tomorrow, you won't know why. *sigh* This situation could be avoided by me not doing that. So that is what I will do then.  Glad we could hear that up. Clear. Glad we could  clear  that up.  I think I need sleep. And medicine. We must not forget the medicine. It gives life and health. *bows down to Medicine* Hey! Isn't that what deities are supposed to do? Wow! Medicine is God. I never would have thought of that if I wasn't not in my right mind. (Can you get through the double negative in that sentence? Good job! *gives you a medal* *snatches it back and puts it in a museum instead* Much better.)  Right, definitely time to sleep.  Is there an e in there? Definitely? Definitly? Yes, there IS an e. The other one looks really mal-formed.   *is dragged away from the computer*  Probably for the best.   (A random sidefact: The name of this file as I save it on my desktop is "ENTRYPOSTITNOWGOGOGOGO.txt" . Hopefully I will not forget to. If you are reading this and you are not me, or a future historian hacking my computer, most likely I haven't forgotten.)     (Another one: This entry is EXACTLY the length of my monitor. Of course, it's not anymore, cause I wrote this on to tell you that it was, so this sentence isn't true anymore. Maybe I should delete it. But that would make it true again. So it should be noted. I don't like dilemmas. One m? Two m's?)   *many people are heard yelling at Anne to go away and stop hurting their sanity*  Fine. Don't tolerate me. Don't accept me. Don't try to understand me.  *Electricity God becomes deceased, therefore saving the upset reading populace*

      i feel rather ill still.  i thin the fact that i'm having difficulty breathing is very not good.   *hyperventilates*  and i feel all dizzy and stomach-achy.  and my head hurts.  and i feel like i might faint.  cause, you see, i can't breathe.  i don't think you want to know the large list of things a consultation with a self-diagnosis book gave me of things that might be wrong with me. those books always freak me out. cause like, along with 'common cold' and 'throat infection' you have stuff like 'kidney disease' and 'brain tumor'.   i'm hoping for common cold. *crosses fingers*  should i follow the general trend and get a new blogskin?

      right, hi, i'm back and i'm trying to re-introduce apostrophes into my writing. it may be a long and hrad battle.  anyways, since we may have an election some month soon, go  urlLink here  and meet the green party. and vote for them on the offchance that there is a voting-age lurker out there somewhere.  while we're in the linking mood, go  urlLink here  and get limewire, which is better than kazaa.  um, there's dandelions out there, which is nice. there is also humidity, which isn't.  that is all.

      right, well, i like the new blogger. im still in the  'wha??? what's going on??? where's everything??? aahhhh so confused'  stage, but it all looks nice and fancy and such things, so once i understnad it, im sure ill like it tons.  i feel so sick. i seriously thought i was going to faint in english. the world went all fuzzy and i felt really dizzy ... o.O not good. ive been feeling sick a lot lately. maybe this means im deathly ill or something. i hope not. it should least wait until after exams. i dont mind a mucked-up summer, but i dont want mucked-up exams. i need my brain for that. it cant be going on weird fainting spells in the middle of quadratic formulas and such.  i think the teachers are trying to make me ill. *puts on her conspiracy theory face* just take a look at all the projects theyre giving us. due for next week i have the following: -guidance portfolio -geo article assignment -history trunk -english essay -math assignment -plus exam studying and music theory exam  *dies*  the more work gets piled on, the more i just don't want to start, because it seems like there's so very much that i'll never get it finished, so why bother starting?  in other news: in a video in history class last week, they nuked sheffield. that made me rather upset. not only was it rather graphic and disgusting in showing people burning and dying of radiation sickness and such, they killed paul and alice. *wails* *cries* *other gestures of extreme grief*  do i really have to wake up early and go to school tomorrow?  yes, you do, anne.  *sigh*

      i mean, seriously, anyone who can write a song about the nuclear reactions in the sun is my idol. *nods* its catchy, its entertaining, and its about SCIENCE!!! whats not to love? *giggles*   The sun is a mass of incandescent gas A gigantic nuclear furnace Where hydrogen is built into helium At a temperature of millions of degrees  Yo ho, it's hot, the sun is not A place where we could live But here on Earth there'd be no life Without the light it gives   the canary song is gone, now i'm singing that one up there. no doubt, caleigh will listen to the canary song and go, 'this isn't all that great, anne is odd. let's shun her!' well, maybe not the shunning part. and they have a lot more songs, and some of them are much better than the canary song. but you were banging cutlery on the table for the canary song, and the tablecloth was crying and the forks were breaking and i was scared that the knife would fly out of your hand in a murderous rage and try to skewer me, so i gave you that song.   ive watched some of their videos (because french is very boring, and this counts as a valuable history lesson. im serious. stop looking at me like that.) and they are very odd. *describes the video for the canary song* there's a disembodied head, and lots of various types of lights, and people in jumping around in a ballet mimic, and children in plaid shirts and masks dancing, then riding on bikes with placards that say 'stop the rock video' and bad early 90's fashion throughout. and the singer is cute, in a odd, floppy haired, slightly too big teeth sort of way. *remembers he's got to be something like 45 now* hmm, thats pretty old. well, he was 29 when this was filmed, so im allowed to say it still.  *runs away before the people drag her away to the loony bin*  my sanity will come back after this weekend. i will be frazzled and braindead from all the work i must do this weekend.  *pow*

      1) i don't like school  2) i feel so very ugly  3) i think my self-esteem might register as a negative value  4) i don't get to see my parent this weekend EITHER!  5) my mother didn't come to ismf, even though she promised for ages that she wouldn't miss it  6)    This making of this list has been aborted, due to the fact that it is an act of outrageous self-pity, which should not grace the pages screen of this little corner of the internet. We apologize if you were moved to any emotion while reading the beginning of this list, whether it be pity, contempt or apathy. We understand how much energy an emotional response to anything that you may or may not read or experience takes, and we humbly apologize for the outrageous theft of what is so clearly yours to deal with as you see fit. No doubt you are wonderfully proficient at the effective and empathetic evaluation of where you should invest our emotional energy.     The making of this apology by the Management has been cut short by the Content Creator, because it did not like the superfluous amount of words that were being utilized in getting across a simple point.     The Undersecretary to the Council in Charge of Dispensing the Word of the Supreme Council would like to add at this point that the Supreme Council realizes that the Content Creator is a hypocrite and that the Management was in the right all along. She would like to issue apologizes to all parties concerned and issues her sincere wishes for everyone to just get along and stop interupting each others train of thought.    At this point, the original author returned and continued on with her list.   6) far too many bureocrats are following me around

       urlLink these people  have captured and enslaved my sanity. it is quite sad actually. they have very catchy and crazy songs, which are running around and chasing each other in my head.   for days.  *cries*  *beats the singing voices in her head up*   *silence resounds*  *anne rejoices*  *a small voice is heard singing  "'im your only friend, im not your only friend, but im a little glowing friend..." , shortly followed by another voice singing  "they call me doctor worm. good morning how are you, im doctor worm. im interested in things, im not a real doctor, but i am a real worm, i am an actual worm, i live like a worm and i like to play the drums....etc...." *  *anne self-destructs*  on the topic of annoying songs... anyone remember this one?   1-2-3-4-5 senses working overtime, trying to tell the difference between a lemon and a lime, pain and pleasure and the church bells softly chime... etc... (Senses Working Overtime-XTC (if you havent heard it, DON'T LISTEN!!! i heard it ONCE in grade 8, and its STILL there in my head.)  *runs away from the onslaught of enraged people who are now singing that song*  i'm sorry, i really am.  but these songs wont leave me alone. and then i have finnish pop songs and mediaeval songs too... and.... *cries* they dont go away...  the soundtrack to my life could benefit from a mute button.

      hey hey hey!!!  i didn't go to school today, because it was silly game day. i thought i would stay home and work, but! i have not been motivated enough, which is silly cause i have tons of stuff to get done. *cries* i am so disappointed in myself.  and now i must do a HUGE!!!!!!!! math assignment.  its not really that huge. and !!!! marks in the middle of a sentence is ungrammatical right?  evil cat woman!!! *hisses*   hehehehehe....  (one day i will do a real update, i promise. i apologize profusely. but if i were to make nice long updates everyday, i might have to give up doing something else, like breathing. which wouldn't be useful at all, because then, you'd never even get a short, pointless update again. right? i think that's right. ive lost my train of thought now. oh dear.)

      know what? i'm fed up with life. *nods* but 'tis alright, ill just keep wandering around in it until i find something of value. which may well be never. so be it.  ismf was today. it was nothing very special. i got to play on a nice big stage in front of a nice big audience and now i have a nice(but not so big) story to tell me grandchildren. *nods* i think we did pretty well.   the big thing of the day was going to the eternal egypt exhibit at the ROM. *grins* much nice stuff to be had there. and we saw the weapons stuff, and the 'walk through the rooms of time' exhibit, where you get to walk through an exhibit which has all these furnished rooms from different periods in time. that's my favourite part of the ROM. ROM means Royal Ontario Museum, in case i have a confused international reader.  and then the world all went mad.  which was strange, becuase everyone thought it was already mad.  and then there was a random side note: (which other people had to fill out)  1. Who are you? 2. Are we friends? 3. When and how did we meet? 4. How have I affected you? 5. What do you think of me? 6. What's the fondest memory you have of me? 7. How long do you think we will be friends? 8. Do you love me? 9. Do you have a crush on me? 10. Would you kiss me? 11. Would you hug me? 12. Emotionally, what stands out? 13. Give me a nickname and explain why you picked it. 14. Am I loveable? 15. How long have you known me? 16. Describe me in one word. 17. What was your first impression? 18. Do you still think that way about me now? 19. What do you think my weakness is? 20. Do you think I'll get married? 21. What makes me happy? 22. What makes me sad? 23. What reminds you of me? 24. If you could give me anything what would it be? 25. How well do you know me? 26. When's the last time you saw me? 27. Ever wanted to tell me something but couldn't? 28. Do you think I could kill someone? 29. Do you think our friendship is getting stronger/weaker/or staying the same? 30. Do you feel that you could talk to me about anything and I would listen? 31. Are you going to put this on your  LiveJournal  Blogger and see what I say about you?

      For lack of a better title, I bring you:   June 29th   I'd say tomorrow maybe If all things go as planned And the Martians don't land Then maybe we will see But there will always be no   I'm so glad you're here Cause talking to invisible demons It gets boring after eons The angels have died I fear You'll never make heaven now  Summer's come so fast The flowers didn't know to bloom We're robbed of their sweet perfume Can they survive like they did in the past? We may never know  Three days before the sky falls Was life worth living? He's having a hard time coping "Wait," after they've left he calls "There's still more to be known"  And I'd say tomorrow maybe If I wasn't so glad that you're here Cause summer's come so fast And there's only three days Before the sky falls   In other news, I cleaned my desk today and discovered that there is actually a surface under there. It is quite miraclous, if that's how you spell it.  My grandparents are telling me to come downstairs and be socialable. Blah on being social. I'd rather stay here.

      Yo. I'm back.  I've decided that I like both Edmonton and Calgary.   I saw a black bear with her cubs by the side of the road, eating dandelions (see, black bears know that dandelions are the source of infinite health, strength and wisdom). I also saw numerous mountain sheep with those curled horns, standing conviently in the middle of the road.   It is a curious fact that the size of animals is all skewy on the other coast. For instance, their squirrels and chipmunks are about half the size of the ones that run around in my backyard, while the common housefly and raven seem to have been put on rather large doses of body-building steroids.  I am proud to say that I survived walking around on the glacier. *waves* Glacier water is very cold. Seriously. Don't drink that stuff. Unless you really desperately want to have a frozen stomach. In which case, you are most likely insane, and wouldn't be let out to go put yourself in danger on a glacier. So I guess that whole last paragraph was rather redunant. Hmpf. Such is life.  I went to the shoppping Mecca that is  urlLink the West Edmonton Mall  (800 plus stores, water park, indoor rink, submarines, etc.) and bought socks. That's right. I went one of the biggest malls in the world and I bought socks. Yes, I am fully aware that I could have done that only a ten minute drive from my house. That is immaterial. I had run out of socks and was too lazy to do any laundry, so I just bought more. I also bought a Tori Amos CD, cause my dad seemed remarkably engrossed in the German DVDs, so I slipped away downstairs and bought that, then went back and stood there for ten minutes and kicked myself for not buying more while I had the chance. *sigh* *chants the "Next Time" mantra*  Hmmm, let's see. Anything else worth mentioning? Let's just go for random facts.  Ok, I was called away for a second to talk to my grandma, and I've just forgotten all my random facts. ACK! I gotta work on my short term memory o_O  Oh! Coolest store I found in Calgary!  urlLink Son of the Pharaoh  is an Egyptian store and is awesome. I got a new ring and a little statue.  Ok, that's all for now I think. Goodbye.

      And now I bid my school farewell for what amounts to two weeks. Such a summer holiday. I have a piece of paper in a plastic frame with some cardboard which says I have acheived Proficiency. I think I shouldn't have been forced to sit through 74 odd speeches of graduates that were remarkably similar, just to get that. My name doesn't even fit on it. *shakes head*   That being said, I would now like to lead you on a quick explanation of how to write a graduation speech.  If you wish to be conventional and almost exactly the same as the majority of the other speeches, please follow the following format. Suggestions have been made to alter the traditional sentiments.  a) I can't believe this has all gone by so fast! b) State whether you are glad or sad to be leaving. c) Thank your loving parents, who you have undoubtedly had more quarrels with than a millipede cann count on his toes, but all that is forgotten since this is a farewell speech after all. They were with you every step of the way. d) Thank your friends for the many laughs you've had together. Extra points for inside jokes, or taking this moment to remind a 'cherished friend' about a particularly humilating which will haunt them for the rest of the ceremony, rendering it quite unenjoyable. e) Thank your teachers for putting up with you. Please disregard the fact that this is, in fact, their job. f) If you're feeling religious, thank special deity of your choice for your success. Extra points for mentioning either Satan or the weather gods. Profess that you are their obediant servant. g) End with a inspirational quote. Extra points for using a quote that has not been heard before by the majority of the audience (consult with guidance teachers to see which ones they avoid) and has not already been used by several other students.  Now, for something completely different, please follow the following suggestions.  There is really only one sentence you need to say. And as we all know, short is good. This sentence is, of course,  "I would like to thank everyone I have ever known."    This sentence can be dressed up a bit if you prefer to be heart-warming and sentimental by adding such sentiments as  "Because they helped, in however large or small a way, to getting me here."   If you are known to have generally unruly or plain odd hair, please include the following sentence,  "I would like to thank my non-existent hairdresser."   If the following situation applies, please don't be shy, and tell the audience the following story.  "I would like to thank my dog's fleas for giving me a better appreciation of how necessary and useful veterinary medicine is, and eventually influencing my career path."   Please reverse a unfortunate misunderstanding and remember to thank yourself for putting up with your teachers all these years.   Please do not use an inspirational quote that is most likely highly overused and on its way to super-clichedoom. Please instead opt for something a little more unusual and perhaps, while you're at it, a bit more realistic, such as:  "The stars are very far away. It is hard to reach for them and not look stupid. Also, falls from that height are generally quite painful and possibily fatal. You'd better not try. Besides, there are terrible restraining orders if you're caught stalking famous people."   On that note, I would like to wish all of my readers a happy next ten days. I shall not be joining you. I am currently being hassled to quite an unforseeable level by various highly annoying family members. This is all in regards to a trip I will be embarking on in four hours. I shall be investigating the Rocky mountains. Please make offerings to the demon idols of your choice to ensure that I will not fall into a glacier and only be discovered thousands of years from now to be exhibited in some museum.  Farewell!

      ... and then the school year ended, and very few people regretted it.  Ah!!!!!!!!!!! SUMMER!!!!!!!!!  I'll be bored in about two weeks, and start wishing for school again. At about which point, summer school should be starting, so it all works out quite nicely, in a way...  So, yes. What a year! Quite a conventional statement and all, but I think it's appropriate. *nods* Maybe I'll write more along that line some other time, or maybe I won't.  I am currently trying to book an appointment with my father to go to the movies and see the new Harry Potter movie. He's not answering any of his phones! *cries* That's not like him. *is suspicious* Oh dear! The purple aliens from the Planet Equilibrium have stuck again! *cowers in fear*  Hmmm  Does inventory of 165 items in her Winamp screen:   Legal:  33  Sent from friends:  92 (Umm, can they track the stuff you send through MSN? Cause if they can... that's not good... Eeekiness...)  Through Kazaa or LimeWire or other illegal means:  46  Why does that all add up to more than 165? o_O  Hmmm... I hope the lawsuit things never get here. Cause, you know, I would buy the CD's. But my grandparents disapprove of so much music that doesn't fit this tiny little genre... so I'm not allowed to buy most of the music that I would like to listen too. *sigh* *resolves to sneak out and buy CD's next time she's in Ottawa* Maybe if I buy the CD's, then delete the songs from here, it will show that I am not beyond curing, or that I'm maliciously ripping off artists.  ... right? Maybe I'm just deluding myself. I don't the record companies actually care about individual motives.   *switches to a less controversial topic*  *tries to think of a less controversial topic*  *fails, but it saved by the fact that her Dad has called her*  And off to the movies I go!

      Hello and good morning or whatever it is in your time zone! *nods*  Oooo! There's a spellchecker feature on this!  *checks her spelling*  Hmm, apparently I spelled spellchecker wrong. o_O   Right, since there is a lack of intelligent or remotely coherent thoughts in my brain, I will go learn the math curriculum, because that stuff doesn't make a whole ton of sense itself, and must only be tackled when you aren't making sense yourself.  See what I mean about not having coherent thoughts?   And then she went away to learn about quadratic equations before she got yelled at by various family members to stop wasting her time doing unimportant things.

      *looks at math*  *feels she should really study*  *doesn't study because she's silly that way*  *writes entry in here instead*  Hmmm, so.  I've been instructed to take out all the stuff from my blog description except for 'but the truth is, we don't know anything.' I think I could do that yes. The rest of the stuff in there is really of no substance whatsoever and I only wrote it cause ... um... no reason really. That's probably why it has no substance. *nods*  This house is really dark. I'm not complaining. It's nice with all the curtains drawn and the lights all off. Light hurts my eyes. I'm serious. I go outside and my eyes all water and I have to squint. We may need the sun to live, but my eyes seem to object to it. Silly things.  I think I'll go study now, and leave the updating of the template and such things to another day. I also gotta update the links on the side. *nods*  Farewell!

      As a break from studying *cough*, I bring you a survey, stolen without any mercy from someone else. And I resent that cough up there. I was studying.  --Name: Anne Kirsten Somethingorother (hahaha. *ahem*) --Birthdate: January 5, 1989 --Birthplace: A hospital *nods* Hey, my dad was born at home and I might have been born during some terrible traffic jam, you never know! Oh --Current Location: My bedroom, Toronto, Canada --Eye color: Dark Brown --Hair color: Dark Brown --Height: 5'6 and 3/4 That 3/4 is very important. --Righty or Lefty: Right --Zodiac Sign: Capricorn.  --Innie or Outtie: This is a very odd question. Why is every survey I've met obsessed with this fact? *is suspicious* Innie if you must know...  // Ver. 2 - Describe  --Your Heritage: German / English / Complicated explanation of Northern German/Slavic people / Irish / Scottish / Polish. In other words, quite a mutt. And quite happy being a mutt actually.  --The Shoes You Wore Today: Black leather school dress shoes --Your Weakness: Being too kind and working too hard. What? In Guidance, that's how we learned to answer that question for job interviews. The trick is in finding something that could be a weakness OR strength. --Your Fears: Ack. We shall not be reciting the fear list today. Thank you, come again another day. (And take the rain with you.) --Your Perfect Pizza: Cheese, bacon, ham and green peppers. At least, that's what I always seem to get. --One thing You'd Like to Achieve: Ummm, can I find the cure for cancer? Or is that against one of the laws of the universe that says that the dream that many people have must never be acheived? I swear there's a rule like that.  // Ver.3  --What is your most overused phrase?: "Indeed" or *nods* --Your first thoughts waking up: Gaaahhhh!!!! Want to sleep more! *roll over* --The first feature you notice in the opposite sex: *sigh* I dislike this question. I'll notice whatever I want to, and it doesn't have a pattern. I'll say eyes. --Your best physical features: I have good physical features? o_O Who'd have thought? Um... hair or eyes. --Your bedtime: 10 pm to 11pm. But I don't normally sleep until midnight or later. I just lie there very bored. Unfortunately I lose most of the things I think about them. I'm pretty sure I've solved all the world's problems. *nods* I've just forgotten the answers. --Greatest Fear: We will still not be reciting the fears list today. Thank you. Go away. --Your Most Missed Memory: Ah crap. I really don't think you want to get me started. *avoids question* I could get sentimental, and we can't have that now, can we?  // Ver.4  --Pepsi or Coke: Um. Neither. Ra ra ra for soda water! It's healthy and years from now, you'll still have teeth. --McDonald's or Burger King: McDonald's. Only because they have nice Caesar salads. At least, they did once. I haven't been there for ages. --Single or Group Dates: Ahahahahahahaha! *ahem* I would imagine single.  --Adidas or Nike: These are sports clothing companies. I simply don't *do* sports. Therefore, we can logically conclude that I do not have a preference, through lack of need. Thank you. I am practising my logical explanation skills for exams tomorrow. --Chocolate or Vanilla: Chocolate!!!!!  --Cappucino or coffee: Ewwwww.... *makes sign against evil* Um. Hot Chocolate. Hehe. --Boxers or Briefs: o_O Do things like this really matter? Um. Boxers.  // Ver.5  --Do you smoke?: No --Cuss?: In amazingly inventive ways. Inventive so that they're not actually technically swearing. --Sing Well?: Hahaha. Ye gods no. --Do you think you've been in love?: *considers deeply* Nah. Me too young. Besides, me speak like cavewoman. (No, I don't know where that came from either.) --Want to go to college: If you mean the university type of college, yes. I have visions of double Ph. D.'s. Hmm, if I get a triple, I'll beat my grandpa. *schemes* This might just be impossible. Please don't shatter my nice dreams.  --Liked High School?: AAAAHHH!!!! It's EVIL! PURE EVIL!!! *hisses* Actually, apart from a ton of work and occasionally idiotic people, it hasn't been all that bad. --Want to get married?: Sure, but I think it might be illegal to marry a survey, so as much as I love you, this might not work. --Type with fingers on the right keys: Nah. I never mastered typing. Unless you mean that my fingers are on the keys that they're supposed to be pressing down. In which case, obviously. This makes sense (in a way at least) doesn't it? I rest my case. --Get motion sickness: *nods* Miserably. *dies* --Think you're attractive: At moments. Infrequent moments. That's the years of people at home telling you're not that much of someone to look at for you. You sadly begin to believe it. *hangs head* --Think you're a health freak: Most definitely not. Probably should be a bit more of one. Exercise is your friend Anne! *looks suspicious* But it wants to hurt me... *runs away* Realizes that, by running away, she has in fact, exercised. *self-combusts* --Get along with parents: We have lovely phone calls, thank you. Hahaha. My dad's quite a nice guy and a friend. My mom, as far as I can see is also quite nice, if inclined to frequent bouts of insanity. She's a bit stressed. The insanity is rarely mentioned.  --Like Thunderstorms: As long as the lightning doesn't hit my house again, I foresee a beautiful future for us. *nods*  // Ver.6 - in the past month, did/have you:  --Consumed Alchohol: No *looks innocent* *actually is innocent for once* --Have Sex: No --Made Out: No --Gone On Date: No --Go To the Mall: I might have... *racks brain* Um... I got nothing.  --Eaten an entire box of Oreos: In my dreams. *revels in dream* Ah. Very nice. *comes back to reality* I dislike reality. *goes back to Oreoland* --Eaten Sushi: Ewww, not a chance --Gone Skating: Actually I have! Well, it's more like a couple months ago, but I thought I'd throw it in here anyway. --Made Homemade cookies: Hmmm *adds idea to Oreoland fantasy* --Been in Love: With life. Every. Single. Day.  --Gone Skinny Dipping: No --Dyed your hair: I cut a split end off yesterday. But that's about all I've done out of the ordinary. --Stolen Anything: No *looks innocent* *actually is innocent*  // Ver.7  --Have you ever played a game that required removal of clothing?: No. See above. I was innocent twice. *grins* *is innocent* --Been trashed or completely intoxicated: Nope. --Been caught "doing something"?: No --Been Called a "Tease": No --Shoplifted?: Not on purpose. And if I have done this not on purpose, I have not discovered it yet, so I'm going with no for now.  // Ver.8  --Age you hope to be married?: Sometime in my 20's. --Numbers and Names of Children?: Um, somewhere between two and four. And as to names, no real clue. I think last time I said Lazuli and Aidan. So um, we'll go with those. *nods* Cause I'm uninspired and all. --Describe your dream wedding: Um. Let's use a cliched phrase for this. We'll cross that bridge of the imagination when we get to it. --How do you want to die?: How about never. Is never good enough for you? I'm sure I could make immortality interesting for a few hundred years. Hmmm, can I be some sort of ghost when I die? So that I can be alive, but not alive, if that makes any sense? --Where do you want to go to college: The moon. Sorry, couldn't resist. If that fails, Mars. Um, realistically speaking... Toronto? England maybe, or anywhere that speaks English or French and gives me a nice big scholarship so it doesn't cost as much to go over oceans. --What do you want to be when you grow up?: Maybe archaeologist... maybe doctor... maybe historian... maybe something else... I'm really not knowing right now. *twitches* Bad grammar. --most like to visit?: Oooo! Capitalization error!

      Wheeeeeeeee!!!!!!!  Ok, this entry comes from a rather hyper and odd conversation I had on MSN a bit earlier. Basically it started with a celebration, and I used my normal line of *militaristic parades with nuclear weapons being trundled along*, and things went from there.   So, I'd like you to meet my army.        And we have fearsome weapons. Nuclear? Of course.       And we are successfully indoctrinating the children =P     Right. There we are.  Goose-stepping soldiers from the USSR. *nods* That's my army. Their secret weapon is a radioactive cow with a stick. No messing with me. *glares*  Hehe.  Ei says I'm scary....  Come on, just cause I want an army and nuclear weapons... =P

      Wow, just had an hour long history study session over the phone. That was good. I don't think I would have bothered to study if that hadn't happened. Wheeee!!!! I feel all prepared now! Just gotta look over some of the pre-World War One stuff and causes of the Depression, then I'm good.  So school is over. The teaching bit anyway. Just got exams now. Pretty confident for them all, though I haven't started studying for any of them. I'm most worried about music and geo. Other stuff should be all pretty good once I spend some time on it.  And now it is dinner.  ______________________________ (This symbolises dinner.)   I am back now. Dinner was very dinner-ish. Thank you for asking.  Now I have a link for you.  urlLink GO IF YOU SUPPORT DEMOCRACY!!!   Thank you.  Now on to other wonderous things.  ______________________________ (This symbolises a long period of thought as to what exactly these wondrous things are.)  How about this?   urlLink This is something I drew.   I drew that a year or so ago.  (end of shameless self-promotion)  And these two things (they're rather large) were drawn by a friend of my great-grandmother's. From her sketchbook. I've brought it to school a couple times. I so want to scan everything in that book and make a website for it so that other people can see it. There's a lot of nice stuff in there.  Here are the two things. They're actually the same thing, but one is a close-up.   urlLink One  and  urlLink Two .  That is what happens when you let me use the school scanner. It's also why I was late to history class. Hehe. Stupid thing didn't save quickly enough. *mutters*  Wheeeeee!  School's done.  Wait... did I already say that? *scrolls up* Ah. I did. That's what happens when you put two black lines in the middle of a post.

      *sigh*  I don't think I can handle having to talk to my grandparents today. They require a depressing amount of optimism, which I am rather lacking at the moment.  *looks at world*  Go away.  *sigh*  Why does that never work?

      Is there a more boring class than Careers? I mean seriously... *sigh* We're supposed to be in study groups, but I really don't feel like studying and I also conviently lost my notes. Stupid geo anyway.  Updating from class is something I've never done before. I don't think I like this. People sitting next to me keep peering over to see what I'm typing. *hides*  Know what? I really want summer. I want to just get away from school and all the people and everything. At this time of the year I've pretty much had it with putting up with people. *slaughters everyone*   Much better.  I need an entire summer not seeing anyone for me to regain sanity and be able to deal with people next year.  Yes, I am in a bad mood. How perceptive of you.  Listening to other people study is quite a good way of studying yourself. All the topics are being nicely reviewed and I don't even have to do anything but listen to the people talking on the other side of the class.  Right, let's pretend that we are studying math. Anyone know how to factor:  y^2 + 2x + 2y + xy  Cause I don't.  Hmmmm, what's the address of that site which lets you go on messenger in school?  *looks at math mock exam*  It doesn't really look that fascinating.  Right. *stares at clock* You can do it, speed up one hour! Just one hour and I could be going home! And that would be great. Except i have to force myself to study. i wonder how well I'd do if all I did was study tomorrow?  *thinks*  Probably not that well.  *runs away to find messenger site*

      Oooooo! Ei's massive post means war! Or at least large amounts of typing. *nods*  Here I go.  I would like to start with saying that a true miracle happened today. That's right, the phone rang in French class to say that I could go home and sleep instead of having to sit through French class. I have been waiting for something like that to happen all year. I swear that time is slowed down in that room. It is enfolded in a sadistically evil demon's little pocket universe. *nods* I felt it rolling around once like it was in a pocket. The fact that I was rather ill and half asleep at the time only reinforces my convinction that I am right. After all, you are always most perceptive when you are sick and tired. That's where we get all our great pessimistic philosophers.  Right, to fill you in on why I was liberated. I was feeling incredibly sick all through History and really wished to go home since I was on the verge of either puking my guts out or fainting, neither one of which I really want to go through at school. So I went down to call home with Ei and M (a wonderful way to skip some French *grins*) and I talked to my grandma. She was all, "It's school! You have to stay and learn! Think of your exams!". Which was all rather disappointing. So I went back to French not only feeling sick as anything, but also rather sad. Then we had to play stupid Autour de Monde! Argh, I hate that game!!! I did alright though. Haha, I beat Frodo. He was telling me the answer to the first one though, so it's all good. Or maybe it was to whoever was up there with me. Ah well, eavesdropping can be useful in that case.   And THEN! A MIRACLE!!!! It rather shocked me, but I was too busy repeating "FREEDOM!!!! FREEDOM!!!! FREEDOM!!!!" in my head to really care that much.   So I got to go home and sleep for a long time. And when I woke up I got to talk to my lovely Australian genius, so it was a good day. He's since disappeared mysteriously. *pouts*  *does cartwheels across page*  Right. I'm not quite that talented.  But no crushing my dreams just yet. If I want to believe that I can do cartwheels across a page, I should be allowed to. Just next time stop me before I do, in case I break something.  Hahahaha. My Dad just emailed me. Let's see whathe has to say. Ah. He wants to tell me that the Green Party is now at 6% in the polls.  *does cartwheels across the page*  Why didn't you stop me? Some friend. *walks away in a huff*  *comes back because she realizes that she has no one else to talk to*  So, YAY!!! That's great news! *is happy* Let's hope it keeps going up and up and up. I can see the headlines : "Suprise majority government for the Green Party! Other parties question vote-rigging effectiveness after record low of seats for their parties attained." Hey, like I said, I can dream. Our time is in the future though. Look at Germany! There's sensible people with a Green government. Yes, it's a coalition government, shut up. It's working and that's what matters.   On reflection, I also think that I should be prevented in future from writing headlines. *nods*  I should probably start studying for history. I'll do that tomorrow. I promise.   *revision gods raise their eyebrows at Anne and mutter amongst themselves*  *Anne pulls out a history textbook and reads*  *revision gods are satisfied and go away*  *Anne stops reading and keeps on typing*  *pouts* There's no Paul or AGG to talk to (yes, he does have a name, but I like AGG better, cause it's more descriptive and mysterious and all that), so I'm feeling rather lonely. *looks at ceiling and twiddles thumbs*  Well, that's hardly fascinating.  Let's try something else.  Like....  *thinks very hard*  *stops because thinking makes her head hurt*  Let's answer stuff that Ei talked about in her blog.   *GO*  Nah, I don't think that's instinctual for mothers to love their children. Sure, for the most part they have to raise us and put up with us (and my mom even shirked out of that bit. hehe, just kidding, I love you mom. And I'm not just saying that because you're really depressed *looks around innocently*) but that doesn't mean that they're going to like us. *shakes head*   And dad's follow the same rule. They don't have to like us either. But if you're lucky like me they will adore you enough to occasionally email you election poll results.  I would now like to inform the world of an interesting phenomenon (the fact that I needed a dictionary for that word is very pathetic. My skills are slipping *weeps pitifully* Ok, I'm done. Let's continue.) This is, of course, the phenomenon of MICRO TIME ZONES, placed in capitals to display importance, thus increasing the ease of your reading and creating a general atmosphere of stupendous excitement. Yes, capitals are that important. Who would have known? The person who invented capitals of course. Silly.   To continue, micro time zones are special things because of their suprising inabilty to conform to all previously known rules of science, english and even guidance (suprising, I know.). They operate on the principle that at any given place, at any given time, it could be any given time. See, when put that way, it's not complicated at all, is it? Perfectly sensible in fact. Of course, many people who try to pass themselves as impressive minds can't deal with the next logical progression of this idea, which is that it can be 4:00 PM where you are, and one metre away from you it can be 9:37 AM. Sometimes I wonder at the future of society when people can't accept simple facts like this.  My God! (Any of you!!!) Save me!!! Suddenly the heavens opened and I saw a terrible thing. More rain. In superfluous amounts. Pouting down with incredible force.  Ah. It's stopped. Armageddon seems to have been rather short lived.   It's quite relieving to know that it's all over now. Isn't supposed to be paradise with all the righteous souls having the world to themselves?   In that case, why I am I still here?  *is perplexed*  *decides to fall off the earth*  It's not working! This is paradise indeed!  Or a strange new earth that has been overrun with invisible Vecro.  *is suspicious*  *decides to go away*  *decides to post a thing of song lyrics, just because she can*   Mad World - Gary Jules   All around me are familiar faces Worn out places, worn out faces Bright and early for their daily races Going nowhere, going nowhere Their tears are filling up their glasses No expression, no expression Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow No tomorrow, no tomorrow  And I find it kinda funny I find it kinda sad The dreams in which I'm dying Are the best I've ever had I find it hard to tell you I find it hard to take When people run in circles It's a very, very mad world mad world  Children waiting for the day they feel good Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday Made to feel the way that every child should Sit and listen, sit and listen Went to school and I was very nervous No one knew me, no one knew me Hello teacher tell me what's my lesson Look right through me, look right through me  And I find it kinda funny I find it kinda sad The dreams in which I'm dying Are the best I've ever had I find it hard to tell you I find it hard to take When people run in circles It's a very, very mad world ... world Enlarge your world Mad world

      Well, those blog police are starting to come after me, so I guess I shall post. But first:   Item One : Blog police, always post deadlines. Otherwise, if the offending blogger only next posts in a month or say, a year, they will claim that they have answered the demand of 'a post' and do not owe chocolate and oatmeal raisin cookies to anyone. And then people will be sad, because they have no oatmeal raisin cookies or chocolate-y goodness. *nods*  End police academy lesson for today.   Item Two : Ei, I do believe that if you were hit by a stray grenade, you would lose your faith in human kindness too. *nods*  Right, now on with the post.  I am dreadfully sorry that I have not posted, but you see, I have been busy spilling noxious chemicals, having a minor mental breakdown in an exam room, and supressing homicidal thoughts while out shopping.  Oh. And my computer broke.  The lab exam was interesting. *remembers she's talked about it before* Ah, nevermind the recap then.  The real exam was interesting too. Other people said it was easy, but I beg to differ. If you had been walking around inside my mind during the exam (never a wise idea, by the way) you would have heard many agonized screams and an incredibly large proportion of vile profanities not record here.   But Anne seems to have survived. And with enough brain cells to write a post. Even in third person! It's really quite a medical miracle!   Please imagine a sarcastic tone for the next segment, thank you.   Anyways, so after that wonderful experience, I got to go to the mall! With my grandparents. Which, of course, was tons of fun!    End sarcastic tone, thank you.   We left with the intention of having shoes picked out and bought for me, and buying a desk calendar.  We came home with a sweater, skirt and jacket for me, and a new television.  I don't think I need to say anything about that or dress it up in any fancy language for that to be funny.  Nevertheless, it was grating on the nerves (if you've ever spent four hours in a situation which highlights every single difference of opinion between yourself and my grandparents, you'll understand).  So, when I got home, all I wanted was to just go relax away from everyone. Naturally, I headed for my computer.  Which chose this very opportune moment to decide to stop working.  It should be fixed in a few days (which in my experience should always be understood to mean weeks).  After surviving the other harrowing experience that is having to spend a day and a half without a computer in the house of my grandparents, I arrived back here, worn out, emotionally shredded and really not in need of a severe shock.  Naturally, my house had turned completely yellow in my absence.  I am nominating myself for an episode of 'When Painters Attack'. It's not really horrible, so much as very... yellow... It makes the house look so very bright, and as we all know very well, brightness hurts the eyes. *blinks as eyes water from looking at the walls*  Right! After me!  We all live in a yellow submarine, yellow submarine, yellow submarine...   That's all I know of it, but it's very descriptive.  I saw Spiderman Two today. The best part was that Tritium had a starring role. Unfortunately, due to some lax Hollywood fact checkers, she was portrayed a dangerous radioactive substance that triggers nuclear fusion. I trust that all my far more intelligent readers realize that she is in fact a radioactive  cow .  Thank you for reading this far. If you've been skimming, shame on you. Get back there and read it properly.  *goes to bask in the fact that her room was not afflicted by the rampage of the painting gods, and is still grey*   We sincerely apologize for the amount of melodrama, choppiness and general length of this post. Our only possible excuse is that the author is recently returned from watching Spiderman Two, and it's general characteristics have rubbed off on her. Hopefully this is only a temporary effect, and shall disappear when we knock some sense into her.  Allegations of management brutality that the author is voicing are completely unfounded.  She fell.  No further comment.  The Management

      I would like to start today's post by saying that it is unadvisable to spill sodium hydroxide on metal. A rather nasty burning smell results and it is possible that the bench was starting to turn red... o_O Oops.   I would like to conclude this post with a "Top Twenty" list of songs. There's also a quote (or a few) for them. This is done on a purely song for song basis, with no consideration to much I am massively in love with a certain artist/group. They are of course subject to change, and are _way_ dependent on moods and such. Feel free to look at this and think I need major correcting in what I listen to. Feel free to recommend an entire new musical wardrobe to make me semi-fit to presnt in public, but please do not criticise my taste in musicto my face. Chances are I don't criticise you. And we're all different and let's learn to live in harmony, shall we?  *gets hit by a stray grenade*  There goes my faith in human kindness.    20. - Pretty Good Year - Tori Amos          Look! It's a Tori Amos song! What a suprise! *does double take* I just started typing this and it came on my Winamp player. *twilight zone music plays* That's freaky. *shivers* *writes another entry in her conspiracy theory book* Lotsa piano in this one... pretty... pretty.... (good year) (sorry, couldn't resist)          Hold onto nothing as fast as you can     Maybe a bright sandy beach is gonna bring you back, maybe not, so now you're off     Some things are melting now     Sometimes he's aware that they're drawing him in     Well, still, pretty good year         19. - Tourniquet - Evanescence          This is the first Evanescence song I liked. Remarkable lyrics, as always. *dances to the music* La la la la, that's about it.          I tried to kill the pain, but only brought more     Am I too lost to be saved?     Will you be on the other side, or will you forget me?     18. - Passenger - Deftones (ft. Maynard James Keenan)          I love the sounds in this one... *floats around in a soundscape for awhile* And the people singing have nice voices. Wheeee! I thinkit shoudl probably have been higher up, but these decisions must be made in a sophisicated manner, and the coin did not agree with me.                Roll the window down, this cool night air is curious      Uh... that's really it. Maybe it shouldn't be higher. Whatever.          17. - Black Halo - The Trews          This is an amazingly cool song. *dances* Go listen to it! Good music and good lyrics. 'Tis rare, I tell you. And they scream in the middle of it, which is always fun to listen to. It probably should have ranked higher, but hindsight is 20/20, apparently, so I should have foreseen this. Or not. o_O          Everyone you know wears a black halo     Mr. Richard Jones, please don't break my bones         Stand your lonely ground in the middle of nowhere, cause things come round and round to the middle of nowhere     The cold winter is coming back     Meanwhile, we're all damned         16. - Remember Me - Hoobastank          I love the viciousness in this song. Let's all go be angry at people! Ok? YAY! *dances* Um...  angrily ...         <>And now the real world has stripped you of your royalty, and from your kingdom you're evicted       But I remember being no one     Do you remember now? You acted like you never noticed me         15. - Optimistic - Radiohead          I've been doing this from the bottom up, and by now I'm tired of writing these comments. I should be studying for my exam. This is a good song, that's why it's here.          If you try the best you can, the best you can is good enough     The big fish eat the little ones, not my problem     I'd really like to help you man...         14. - I Don't Like Mondays - Tori Amos          You know what? I don't either. They're depressing. *pouts*          Nobody's gonna go to school today, she's gonna make them stay at home     Tell me why I don't like Mondays, I want to shoot the whole day down     School's out early and soon we'll be learning that the lesson today is how to die     And he can see no reasons, cause there are no reasons, what reasons do you need to be shown?         13. - Bullet With Butterfly Wings - Smashing Pumpkins          Hahahaha. I've always heard this song, but never quite caught who it was by or what it was called until a week or so ago. The music is better than the lyrics.                Someone will say what is lost can never be saved     Tell me I'm the chosen one         And I still believe that I cannot be saved         12. - Glory Box - Portishead          Wheeee! I love this song! There's a ton of contrast in it. *nods* Kinda jazzy, then not, then back again. There's weird sounds in the background too... Like industrial crushers from factories or something. You wouldn't think it would work, but it does.          I'm so tired of playing with this bow and arrow, gonna give my heart away     We're all looking through a different picture though this new frame of mind     This is the beginning of forever and ever         11. - Touched - Vast          I've only ever heard this song by this band, but I really like it. *dances* Kinda in the same style of Sister Dew down there, but different. It's only not as high up (or low down... these reverse numbering is messing with my head... o_O) because I haven't been listening to it as much lately. Actually, I think it may deserve a higher (...lower...whatever...) place now. *sigh* I'm not going to change it up now. Too much work, and I'm lazy.          God knows I'm not at home     I looked into your eyes and saw a world that does not exist     I looked into your eyes and saw a world I wish I was in     I'll never find someone quite as touched as you         10. - The Municipal Junkie - Doug Cheatwood          Hey look! It's Doug Cheatwood! He's a musical genius! In my opinion anyway. He's amazingly original and has nice catchy lyrics and music. Go to his  urlLink site  ,  and download his music. *nods* I also recommend "Where Do the Lights Go?" and "Digging Up Dinosaurs and Putting Them Together Again". Just try to get them out of your head once they're in there. Hehe.          You drive too fast, but you're much too late     He was a lonely soul, but he had a fighting chance         It's hard to keep talking with the audience laughing at the microphone walking away     It's a ridiculous end to a ridculous day         09. - Isabella - Mediaeval Baebes          It's mediaeval crossover! Yay(eth)! I basically like a lot of their stuff and had to pick one that was representative of this. So this song is representing every single song by them on this rather subjective chart.              It also has nice drums. *dances*              Oh, and it's in Italian. The jist is that there's this girl dancing in in a spring field and there's these elves who come kidnap her and take her away to their special fairytale world.          08. - Shazam! - Spiderbait          Uh. Ya. This one's here for the music, not the lyrics, so don't judge on those, mkay? (Until I just read the lyrics, I'd got them all wrong anyway. So we can safely say that they don't matter.)                 You need a little something that can make you smile again       You can try hard, but you never really had the time        Etc... etc... listen to the music.             07. - You're So Sober - The Trews          A very simple, but touching song. (For some reason, I am reminded of those descriptions on the back of wine bottles.) I think I'll let the words speak for themselves. (The bumble bee thing makes me giggle, cause I have trouble seeing bumble bees as 'humble', but ah well.)              I'd love to say, do you love me? But I'm as humble as a bumble bee     I'd walk away, if you'd come with me, or I may crumble for all to see     Hey, by the way, did you love me?     Sift through the ruble for debris     You only broke me         06. - Why Does the Sun Shine? - They Might Be Giants        <> THE SUN SONG!!! How many times have I typed this in all caps in MSN? What? That's too many numbers for you to fit in your brain? Pfah. ...it's amazingly catchy and it's about science, therefore, I am obsessed with it.           The sun is a mass of incandescent gas, a gigantic nuclear furnace!          Where hydrogen is built into helium at a temperature of millions of degrees!          The sun is hot! The sun is not a place where we could live!     But here on earth, there'd be no life without the light it gives!         05. - Only an Ocean Away - Sarah Brightman          This has been one of my favourite songs since I was approximately eight. *grins* It's got funny oxymoron-like things in it, but still makes complete and absolute sense.                There's an ocean between us, you know where to find me     More than a lifetime, still goes on forever, but it helps to remember you're only an ocean away         04. - 99 Luft Balloons (99 Red Balloons) - Nena          Right, this song is in German, so I won't post lyrics.       The general jist is that there's a nuclear war set off by these red balloons, and it's really terrible and tons of people die, and it's all the stupid government and military's fault. Near the end of the song, there's a line which goed like this:  99 years of war leave no room for victors.  This basically shows how nuclear war is pointless, cause there's a ton of devastation and no one wins. Which is what we learnt in history class. However, in history class, we also learnt that a nuclear war would be over like that, so there wouldn't be time for 99 years of war. I think she got a bit carried away with the whole '99 of everything' motif, but it's still a good song.       Oh, and it has nice music too. In an '80's way.            03. - Sister Dew - Deus          Wheeee! Sister Dew! Listen to it, if you haven't already. Once you have, it will be on your top twenty too. *nods enthusiastically*              I was taught a million things I can't explain     Please forgive me if I keep on smiling, but every sad story has funny side to it     Oh my sweet Sister Dew, what have I done? All my life I never loved no one           02. - Hello - Evanescence         I heard this song for the first time a few days ago, so I'm still in the 'OMG! it's so AWESOME!' phase. I don't know how long this will last, but for now, it's up here. Ilike the lyrics and the music has a lot of piano-y and string instrument-y goodness. So, uh, *hugs song*. Man, that's moderately pathetic.              Has no one told you she's not breathing?     Don't try to fix me, I'm not broken     Suddenly, I know I'm not dreaming     Hello, I'm still here... all that's left of yesterday         01. - Silent All These Years - Tori Amos           Well, well, well! Who'd have predicted this? Tori Amos is at the top of my list! *grins* There are no words to describe how much I love this song. It makes me feel better on a bad day, which is saying something.              I got something to say, you know, but nothing comes     Yes, I know what you think of me, you never shut up     Years go by, will I still be waiting for someone else to understand     Don't look up, the sky is falling     It's your turn now to stand where I stand    *falls over and dies*    That took hours. You better have read it. And respect me dammit. Hahaha.    Oh yes. These are good lyrics sites:        urlLink http://www.lyrics007.com  (but they don't have Tori Amos! or The Trews! or They Might Be Giants! BLASPHEMY!)      urlLink http://www.sing365.com  (but they DO!)      urlLink http://www.lyricsdepot.com  (I didn't bother checking if they did, they've got Sarah Brightman though)    There needs to be some site where you can find ALL THE LYRICS IN THE WORLD!     IN ALL LANGUAGES!!!!    *falls over and dies*    Uh...    Again.

      So, today wasn't hardly great. Didn't do to well on my test. There's an exam in a couple days which I'm not too happy or excited about or really confident _at all_.  I tried to kill off a character in my book today, but I couldn't do it. Not that I'm emotionally attached to her or anything, I just couldn't write it so that I was happy about it. It kept coming out all sappy and ack! how I hate sappy!   *murders all the sappy stories in the world*  You have to try harder than that to make me cry. I haven't cried in something like six months.  I also might just have lied.  *sticks tongue out*  I GOT MY TEXTBOOKS TODAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  They are pretty. And heavy. They broke the box they came in. The science and math textbooks and history textbook are rather scarily large.  Hmmm, you know how when people get house arrest as a sentence for something, how everyone thinks they got let off easy? I think it all depends on who they get cooped up with. Wait, do they get cooped up with people? Or by themselves? Or with only people that are ordained for them to get cooped up with?   Cause it changes it a lot.  In other news, I have decided that when those computer modifications I was talking about a couple days ago do come out, I'm going to go around secretly installing mute buttons in people.  Just my way of making the world that much more tolerable.

      I have been informed to post, so post I shall.  I got Firefox! Which is some sort of Mozilla, and it is way awesome and all the pop-ups have stopped invading my personal space, so I am happy. And I can only have one browser window open, and everything's here. YAYETH!  *dances to her German rock music*  *continues writing*  Should I have breakfast? Or should I just go straight to lunch?  *votes for lunch*  *munch munch munch*  There is nothing more for me to say and I think this is appropriate.   Sister Dew - Deus   Oh my sweet Sister Dew what have I done? All my life I've only loved the one. I was taught to be tolerant and plain I was taught a million things I can't explain.  It must have been the hatred in her eyes It must have been the power to her lies Sister tell me there's a place where I can hide  Oh my sweet this is how it did unfold no my body never felt so calm and cold. All around us there were people in the park. No my senses never felt so clear and stark.  And I swear that she saw it in my way and I'm sure that she heard it in my voice Sister tell me please I didn't have a choice.  I enjoyed to see her being idle she never had no worries, nothing vital from the day I met her to the final... afternoon. There was something there I can't describe it we were kicking ass we didn't fight it. She never once suspected, that she had it... coming soon.  Oh my sweet Sister Dew what have I done? all my life I've only loved the one. I was raised with compassion and they said I was loved for the loving that I spread  Now the only thing remaining is this chill. and the only emptiness I need to fill is understanding what it is that made me KILL.  Haaahaaah-haaahaaah-haaahaaah-haaahaaah  Please forgive me if I keep on smiling but every sad story has a funny side in from that moment on I felt like crying... every day. All around us there were people screaming For half a second I thought I was dreaming my baby looked at me her eyes were beaming, I walked away.  Oh my sweet Sister Dew what have I done? All my life I've never loved no one. So it dawned on me this should be the place now the only thing I crave is an embrace.  So let your tender wisdom be mine and let me come to you like a child I'd like to stick around here for a while.

      Well, I joined this banner exchange like thing which is supposed to get you more traffic, called  urlLink BlogSnob . I don't know why, no. Just thought I would, because I could and it seemed a better thing to do than my lab report. Life's funny like that. Anyways, I'm basically saying that if weird stuff starts showing up in that little AD box over there, I'm not responsible for the content.  Now I sound unpatriotic to something I'm a part of. Political correctness would appear to be a very fine line that is difficult to step over in either direction without making someone mad.  *switches topic*  Actually, it's rather a slow day in terms of things to talk about.  Uh... the sun is shining?  This morning my grandmother was talking about how she hadn't been listening to the radio all morning, so she had no idea what was happening in the world. I was still half-asleep at the time and looking out at the nice backyard with its flowers and green grass and the occasional bird trying to escape from the evil cat who lives next door. As a result, I was in a very idealistic mood, and couldn't help feeling that learning about all the terrible things that are happening in the world (people dying, children crying...) rather ruins a nice day. I'm all for being well-informed and helping out others less fortunate, but somedays I wish it was like the olden days, when all news travelled by letter, and you never knew much that happened outside your own little universe.  Cause in my universe, everybody's friendly and we have cookies.

      Our culture is under a severe attack.   These invaders are clever at their wily craft. They infiltrate our home terrain and ingratiate themselves until we cannot see their presence. This is when we are most vulnerable, for when we are the most comfortable, this is when we are struck.  These stealthy and unexpected attacks are a shocking and unjustified afront to our ordinary citizens. An innocent mother and child should not have to worry as they are eating dinner or sleeping peacefully about being trodden on by these clearly evil assaulters of our freedom.  We are referring, of course, to these terrible occurrances that have been becoming more and more prevalent in the past years.  Our honourable and upstanding citizens should not have to be subjected to the sheer humiliation of being forced into tiny prisons by these invaders from above. These children, they have no sense of dignity or shame when commiting their terrible crimes.  The emotional and physical trauma that our brave compatriots are subjected to on a daily basis by these outsiders who try to regulate our lives is immense and intolerable. They try to tell us when and how to eat, they give us different houses, they torture us with the corpses of our fellow species.   Clearly, these people are vicious and revel in the horror of their own crimes against us. We shall not stand for this any longer. They must be stopped, and stopped they shall be.  We will rise up against this new embodiment of evil. From this day forth, let all who are with us have a new hope for a peaceful future, free from fear, and all those who are against us tremble and repent from their ways, as they realize that we will not be defeated, for our desire for freedom is stronger than their desire to subdue us.

      I apologize in advance for any and all mistakes in grammar or spelling. I'm dead tired and I haven't been thinking coherently today. I found tons of mistakes in my lab observations today. o_O Switched decimal places and such.   I would like to take this opportunity to announce that 36.10 mL will now be known as 31.60 mL, according to the Anne System of Measurement. Thank you. We apologize for any inconvience this may cause to previous lab results.   I would just like to say I'm massively happy that that the weekend is here. *celebrates with fireworks and militaristic parades with nuclear weapons being trundled about*   *remembers that she is already exhausted*   *dies because of the extra effort*   And the moral of this story, children, is that celebrations are overrated. Or something like that. It's probably more like "Pay attention to what your body is telling you.", but that sounds too much like health class. And I know we'd all really like to forget health class, so I apologize for bringing it up.   I feel sorry for the little girl who just got stranded on our doorstep talking to my grandma for half an hour. She lives next door and her heartless mother just sent her over to give us cookies. Her mother is not heartless for giving us cookies, she is heartless for sending a little girl over here to have to deal with my grandmother during summer. This poor little girl was standing there for half an hour listening to my grandmother tell her the life story of my second cousin who happens to have the same name as said poor little girl standing on doorstep. Then, of course, I was summoned to come join in talking to her. This girl was fidgeting so much and sending those little shifty eye glances to her home (So close, yet so far away...) which should clearly tell anyone remotely perceptive that said child should be released immediately.   My grandmother has never been a perceptive person.   That's so much what my 'childhood' was like. Long conversations with adults where your greatest virtue was sitting or standing there quiet, being a model of proper behaviour and nodding your head every once in awhile, but heaven forbid you say anything.    "You should be seen and not heard. Don't talk unless you've been directly spoken to, or it's an emergency. No one wants to hear someone complain. Children should never talk out of turn."   Man. It's easy to blame that group of advice for so much of what's happened in my life. I get bad participation marks because I don't talk in class, people say I'm too quiet, etc. *shakes fist at said group of statements in blatant copyright infringement*  And then there's the whole thing about never being allowed out of the house alone. I can't walk next door, I can't go into my own (fenced!) backyard, I can't even stay home alone.   I am never alone.  And it is really aggravating. I figure I'd like them more if they let me have more of a free rein. And let me spend time away from them. *nods*  *switches to another topic*  EI IS ALIVE!!!!!!!!!!!! *gives her presents*   This is very good news. We were going through all the terrible things that could have happened to her, and it's very good to know that it was just laziness. *sticks out tongue at Ei*  Uh. I think I just ran out of things to say.  Somedays it gets very tiring being me. Ever get the feeling you just want to go be someone else for a change?

      Good evening, soon to be night!  Today was just as slow and boring as yesterday, which is really quite a shame, cause I can think of about a thousand ways to make things more interesting. Like not being at school and taking notes for six straight hours. I could imagine that that would be a good start. Ah well. This time next week, I'll be done, and wondering what to do with myself.  My measuring tape has broken. I consider this a great tragedy, because it's incorporated into a little figure of a gnome. You pull on the nose, and the measuring tape unravels. So now, his nose has fallen off and the measuring tape has broken in two. *deep sigh* Poor little gnome. *hold requiem mass* Oh wait. He's not dead. Uh... there's nothing you really do for someone who loses their nose, is there? Well, apart from driving them to a hospital.  Know what irritates me? Those synthetic scents that you get in stuff like conditioner and lip gloss. If real strawberries smelled like that, I'd be worried.   I just had dinner, and my grandparents were talking amongst themselves and I had reached the stage where tuning out is mandatory or your brain explodes. So I was sitting there happily oblivious to whatever was going on, and I was conducting a conversation with myself and singing a bit in my head when I suddenly realized that outside my mind it had gone rather quiet. I looked up and both my grandparents are staring at me with expressions of shock on their face. "What did you say?" my grandma asked in a rather incredulous manner. Since I had absolutely no clue what I had been thinking about, I just said, "Uh, this is a great steak!" and bolted back here as soon as possible.  Whatever I did, I swear I'm innocent. *points at subconcious* Her fault.

      I can't believe it's only Wednesday. It should be at least Thursday of next week.  *deep sigh*  I feel utterly exhausted beyond comprehension. With school, with people, with everything.  *puts her happy face on again*  I heard somewhere on the radio a few weeks ago that a computer company (I think Microsoft, but I'm not sure) got a patent for some device that integrates a computer into the human body. So you could be paired up with a computer. You could type something on your arm, you could transmit information with a handshake, presumably one day you will be able to take digital pictures with your eyes.  This brings us to today's discussion question:  Would you want to be part computer?   I think I would, as long as it was just certain parts that would aid me, not me becoming some sort of emotionless cyborg thing that wants to take over the world, a la low-budget sci-fi movie.  I would want a memory chip so that I wouldn't forget things as easily, and the aforementioned ability to take pictures with my eyes, thus getting a sort of artificial photographic memory.  Speaking of evil cyborgs wanting to take over the world, when is the new Battlestar Galactica coming out? *checks* Hmmm, courtesy of the  urlLink IMDb , it says 2004. I do believe it is already 2004. *sigh* Studios always do this. It's highly aggravating.   This was filmed at Simon Fraser University out in B.C., which is also disconcerting, since I've been there, which makes it rather hard to imagine as an alien planet. o_O But the actors make up for it. *winks*  urlLink *points to Jamie Bamber*   urlLink *points to James Callis*  *stops pointing to say that they are also good actors, which is important because looks can only take you so far and she does care how good looking someone is if they can't act*  *switches subject*  I will be as silly and superficial as I like thank you.   How does the shoe in the middle of the road get there?  I mean, its not like it can walk. And who just randomly drops a shoe out of the window in the middle of a eight line highway. This is the true mystery of the universe I believe. *nods*  Has anyone else had a headache for the past three days? Should I be worried, or is this natural with bad weather? Is there a safe limit of Advil to take each day? Does that number vary from the number on the box? Does Advil actually cause headaches in order to produce sales? Do any of these questions actually have answers?  I am ripping my CDs now. This wouldn't take that long if I had a faster computer. I only have about 30 CDs in total. Wheeeee! *brain fries in the meanwhile* Woot! Another one done. *switches CDs* I shall be done in no time!  There are way too many pop-ups on my computer. This is quite disgusting, because I have a pop-up blocker and run AdAware everyday. Hmmm, are there any other programs that get rid of Adware / Spyware / Pop-ups? Preferrably for free, but I'll pay if I have to to stop having to close a pop-up ad for every new page I load.  I feel very ugly as of late. *people from off-stage start yelling, "That's cause you  are  ugly!"* Ah. Well glad we could set that straight then. *sigh*  I am off to eat on dinner. I shall inform you if I die from the poison.   Eh... Wait....  I'm back. I'm not dead. That much should have been obvious.  Right now I'm going through a very melodramtic shooting death in an MSN convo. And another one about radioactive cows and biological weapons. The weather must not be interesting today. *looks outside* Ah. A typical summer's day. I suppose complaining about the stifling heat and humidity does get rather repetitive by the time we reach July.  I started crocheting a hat in January and it's not done yet. Maybe I'll finish it my October when the coldness comes back. Ah! WINTER! I can't wait! I am definitely a cold weather person. If there's no chance of snow, I'm not going, and that sort of thing.   This Christmas my parents are dragging me off to various Hot and Sandy Caribbean islands. I am very unhappy about this. I dislike Hot and Sandy places intensely. The heat makes you all sweaty and then the sand gets everywhere and it's highly annoying and causes a whole ton more laundry than you would otherwise would have to do, which is an incredible pain, because since you don't live in a Hot and Sandy place (unless you're incredibly unlucky), you won't have your washing machine close-by, so you'll have to wash stuff in a bathtub or go to a laudromat and get everything accidently redyed a pale pink, which has been aforementioned as an entirely undesirable colour to have an entire wardrobe of.  *takes deep breath as thousands of English teachers suffer massive heart attacks from the gigantic run-on sentence*  I apologize to you, gentle reader (why are readers always 'gentle'?) and to the English teachers' families. Laziness struck me and I couldn't be bothered to take the breath that would signify a new sentence. Shocking, I know.  I have this little statue of a knight on a horse sitting on my desk. I use the word statue quite loosely here. It's about an inch tall and made of plastic (the horse) and some unidentified metal alloy that is most likely mainly lead and radioactive substances. I got it from a Kinder Suprise. Ah, good childhood memories to be had there. I think that was the first thing I ever got possessive about. Those Kinder Suprise toys caused some trouble and fights, let me tell you. *nods* Luckily I grew out of it after Grade One. That's when I changed school's and switched personalities, you see.  Speaking of kindergarten (It's a German word, spelled properly with the t.) I saw a friend of mine from way back then this morning. It was really weird, considering the last time I saw him he was about a metre tall. o_O We were just driving down the road and I was like, "Hey! It's Dylan!". He was sitting in the car beside us. My grandfather replied with, "So it is!". His parents look the same and they have the same distinctive car and everything. (Yes I do remember stuff like that, it's amazing hoe much useless crap is in my brain from years ago, and I can't remember what I was taught yesterday.) Also, he has the same haircut, which is rather sad, especially if you remember back to whatever your hair looked like in kindergarten.  Where have all the dandelions gone? I thought we banned pesticides here. Where did they go? It's safe for you now! come back! *weeps and sends out search parties for them* Hahaha, maybe they're waiting for an invitation.   Dear Absent Dandelion Friends,  It has come to my attention that you have left this gracious city recently. I would like to take this opportunity to cordially invite yourselves and your friends back to the city for a grand infestation. It is safe for you here now, since a remarkably enlightened City Council has seen the sheer disgrace of the slaughter of millions of your kind has brought upon our glorious city. They have banned those most horrific substances that have terrified your species for decades. We now invite you back to our most gracious of homes, with a gesture of kindness and remorse that we have not seen the benefit of your bright blooms at an earlier date.  Sincerely,  The Public Works Committee.   I'm dead tired. *falls over*

      So today the weather gods decided to continue their persecution of me. They did this in the form of a series of thunderstorms, which was a severe miscalculation on their point, for they struck so hard and violently that they caused the electrical devices in the school to malfunction, leading to sheer darkness and an absence of running water and a working septic system. A sufficient emergency was perceived, and all the students got to go home. The chemistry test has been postponed.  SCORE: Anne - 1, Weather Gods - 0  We shall selectively ignore the many points that the weather gods have scored in previous matches. I have won the battle. And since the world lives for the moment anyway, I think we can safely assume that I am in the lead.  Because of the heavens opening and draining their bathtubs on my little patch of the earth, the stream running by my house is having pretentions of becoming a grand river, Mississippi-style. *glares at it warningly* You are permitted to flood, as long as you don't try to copy the scale being seen in  urlLink Peterborough .  My shower / bathroom has lost its smell of mould. I would be excited and generally enthusiastic, but it now smells like a particulary sanitary public washroom. Oddly enough, this is more disconcerting than the mould smell. It feels like I'm in some public place which is unfriendly and cleaned by people who scowl at you while conversing in strange languages.  *takes a ginger ale and corn chip break*  You can't write for too long you know.  Let's see, what else happened today? Something to do with hydrochloric acid. Nobody got hurt though, so it's not really worth mentioning.   *turns on light out of sheer and utter neccessity because the sky is clouding over*  The weather gods are coming to get me. *cowers*  When dinnertime conversation consists of your grandmother informing you about poisons that can be made from simple household ingredients and mixed into food, causing a natural-looking death that will not show up on post mortem tests, you start to get nervous.  In other news, you'd better not piss me off, for I strike quickly with common household ingredients and leave no trace. *grins*  Aw man. I had a whole post being planned out in my head during dinner, but it seems to have gotten lost somewhere in between the kitchen and my bedroom. Oh dear.  It has started raining again. I hope the power goes out.  Oh wait. *revises sentence*  I hope the power goes out  after  I've finished with my computer. Otherwise it's just stressful and annoying.  From  urlLink Bizzaro , "Every time they tell me to think of this company as a family, I want to lock myself in my room, or run away from home."  I am proud of myself because I got my Winamp player to work again. It was totally by accident, when I was trying to do something else (which, incidentally, didn't work), so I don't deserve any credit, but I'm snatching it anyway.  Until next time, I say Wheiofh! And leave you to go look at my Chemistry homework.

      Wow, the update page is all different! *wanders about lost* I suppose this is its way of telling me that I should update more than once a week.  &nbsp;  In the last week, nothing worthy of mentioning for more than a brief moment happened. There was a lot of work.&nbsp; Great things did not happen it was all generally boring and depressing and aggravating all at once.  &nbsp;  That said, I'm still here, so it wasn't unsurvivable.  &nbsp;  *switches topics to the great relief of the 0.25 loyal reader*  &nbsp;  Well all this school is making my brain melt and I think the symptoms are starting to show. Yes, I am aware that this is not a full change of subject. I laughed for rather a long time yesterday at the phrase 'excess aluminium'. Come on, tell me I'm not crazy! Can't you just picture a room full of Very Serious Military Personnel saying "Yes, we have an excess aluminium situation. Roger. I'm going in." *cue invisible string orchestra*  &nbsp;  I think I should just wear a sign around my neck which says "Does not talk unless in the company of good friends and in a rare talkative mood. You are warned not to approach unless the following requirements have been met or you do not object to awkward silences." I think might solve some problems. Or maybe it would create more. We shall probably never know, since this whole idea is purely hypothetical.  &nbsp;  A project for August includes making a website. From scratch. Without the aid of silly 'Page Creators'. Why? To feel superior and special and accomplished. Is it too high a goal? Probably. High goals are good though, cause either you suprise yourself and do really well and achieve your goals, or you don't and you just let something go and feel disappointed. I suppose that's not that good really. Well, people have selective memories, so... uh.... *prays the selective memories will prove useful for once and people forget the last thing*  &nbsp;  Hmmm. *goes to get potato chips for a lack of better things to do*  &nbsp;  My grandpa just told me I look like  urlLink Julie Andrews . I am oddly creeped out. (It's the classic Mary Poppins and Maria from Sound of Music for anyone who's unsure. !!! I never realized the only two roles that I basically know her from are variants of the same name! ...creepy.... o_O *dusts of her conspiracy theory book and makes a new entry* Today has not been totally wasted. This is good.)  &nbsp;  *launches into discussion of her MSN name*  &nbsp;  Right.  Meket Nephthys  means literally "Protected by the Goddess Nephthys". (Random sidenote: I am listening to Egyptian rock music now. Strangely enough, the words are in English.) There are of course alternate spellings of the name Nephthys. (Nepthys, Nebt-Het, Nbt-Ht, etc...) Now, as to what exactly she is goddess of, there are differing opinions too.&nbsp; My personal favourite is "The Goddess of Death Undying", because it is an interesting paradox. My personal take on that is that it means a goddess of the afterlife, or eternal life.  &nbsp;  She is the sister of Isis and Osiris and Seth, and some sources name her as the mother of Anubis and wife of Seth. (It's Ancient Egypt, they married relatives, get over it.) Also, "Mistress of the House".  &nbsp;  From  urlLink this site  the following is said about her:    She was the darkness to  urlLink Isis ' light, the bareness to contrast her sister's fertility. Friend to the dead, their protector, she was a beneficial deity who offered both guidance and comfort. Although linked with death and decay, she was also a bringer of life into the world, and rebirth into the land of the dead. Leaving her husband  urlLink Set , she became a follower of Osiris and a supporter of her sister. In Egyptian art, the twin sisters were almost always shown together. Great of magic, Nephthys was seen as a good goddess who would give them rebirth in the land of the dead, just as she had helped Osiris to be reborn.    To learn more (if you're interested about that sort of thing) go to  urlLink one   urlLink of   urlLink these   urlLink links .  &nbsp;  Apparently there's a German band called Nephthys.  urlLink See?    Hey, Ei! I'm asking about the Renn Faire tonight when my Dad calls, but I'm pretty sure the afternoon / evening is better. *nods* Oh, and Reason Number 729 to listen to Tori Amos : She's friends with Neil Gaiman!  urlLink See?  She talks about him and stuff he writes about in her songs and such.   Paul said I could quote him, so here goes.  The problem with all religions is the fact that there is more than one, which suggests to me that none of them are right.  And another one.  It's probably best if I don't remember anything that I've said.    And, since it has been Chemistry for awhile now, and we're starting on gas laws, and did fusion awhile ago, I present the SUN SONG!!!    Why Does The Sun Shine? - They Might Be Giants    The sun is mass of incandescent gas, a gigantic nuclear furnace,  where hydrogen is built into helium at a temperature of millions of degrees.  The sun is hot, the sun is not a place where we could live.  But here on earth there'd be no life without the light it gives.   We need its light.  We need its heat.  The sunlight that we see.  The sunlight comes from our own sun's atomic energy.   The sun is mass of incandescent gas, a gigantic nuclear furnace.  Where hydrogen is built into helium at a temperature of millions of degrees.   The sun is hot.  [The sun is so hot that everything on it is a gas, aluminum copper, iron and many others.]   The sun is large.  [If the sun were hollow, a million earths could fit inside, and yet it is still only a middle-sized star.]   The sun is far away.  [About 93,000,000 miles away, and thats why it looks so small!]  But even when its out of sight, the sun shines night and day.   We need its heat.  We need its light.  The sunlight that we see.  The sunlight comes from our own star's atomic energy.   [Scientists have found that the sun is a huge atom-smashing machine. The heat and light of the sun is from the nucleur reactions of hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon, and helium!]   The sun is mass of incandescent gas, a gigantic nuclear furnace.  Where hydrogen is built into helium at a temperature of millions of degrees.    Thats all ladies and gentlemen.

      How's that for a random title? I think only one other person in the whole entire universe will understand that.  This is just really a note to say that since people put my full name in those surveys they were filling out awhile ago, there's now results for my name if you  urlLink Google it . And you can find my blog now...  *censors herself from now on*  No more remarks about the family I think...  Only two of them are internet-literate to any dangerous degree, but one of them has been known to search my name in the past, so the censorship is necessary.  In other news, I feel sick.  *eats medicine*  Much better.  *has allergic reaction to medicine*  I hate life.

      Right, so I've told myself that I'll be actually writing a huge long post now, which is nice and all, but might be complicated by the fact that I really have nothing I want to talk about.  I seem to have already talked about the really long walk to the movies, which is rather disappointing cause that is about the most exciting thing that has happened to me in awhile.  I think everyone should be plonked down in a really big mall that is a cross between the awesome Eau Claire ethnic-y mall in Calgary, a generic mall like Upper Canada and The One I Forget The Name Of in Ottawa (Rideau Centre? Something like that...), with a large amount of money and allowed to buy anything they want, all by themself. Much of the evil emotions associated with shopping stem from the fact that some people are forced to go shopping only with the constant supervision of rather old-fashioned and single-minded persons who shall remain nameless, cause you all know who I'm talking about anyway.   Yes, it's true I'm not allowed outside by myself. Don't you know that there are several Very Dangerous People hiding behind that rather weedy tree, waiting to brautally attack me, and that the only thing that can save me is having the protection of a old man and woman who have osteoporosis and can't open jars anymore? Well now you know. Get your own bodyguard. They apparently will come in useful if ever these malicious people show themselves.  *looks at chemistry*  This is boring.  *takes some time off from writing this entry to yell at the Winamp player*  The randomization feature seems to still be broken. This is incredibly annoying. *glares* I extremly dislike having to listen to songs in order.  Did you know that there's nothing on my walls? *nods* No posters, no paintings, no random pieces of paper, no calendars, etc, etc. We wouldn't want to destroy the lovely paintwork.  And another thing. My bathroom is painted pink. *is generally severely unhappy* It's been like this for approximatly forever, because my grandparents felt that dark green was too depressing. *shakes head* Pink is depressing. Thirteen years of pink, five days a week, has really scarred me forever. (Yes, it is thirteen, I only got sent here when I started school, which was at two.)  Right, I just had dinner. So eight minutes have passed. Yes, I do eat dinner quickly. You would too if you had two people asking you a never-ending stream of questions. All they got was my name, rank and serial number. *looks around in a suspicious manner* *chokes and dies cause she's eating too fast*  Well. That certainly backfired.  *runs around hitting people with dandelions and then disappearing*  Hey, what would you do if you were dead?  That's what I thought.  Quite typical of you, actually.  Interesting. It seems that the ancient proverb,  As in life, as in death  is true.   *goes on to prove that the universe came from a dandelion seed*  *fails miserably*  *goes off to a corner and pouts*  *comes back and chronicles the events of the past few seconds*  They do say that non-verbal communication is the most important part of communication as a whole.  You all must understand me perfectly then.

      Hmmm. I had a big thing written but I reconsidered. Cause it was boring.  There's some painter coming today to talk about painting the house or something.  I walked to the movies yesterday with my dad and discovered that when you live in an urban sprawl development, you really can't walk anywhere. An hour and a bit long walk to get there. *fumes* I hate developers. There are way better ways to arrange the subdivisions. Like putting shops and other services in walking distance, so we don't all have to drive, causing tons of pollution and traffic problems, which all could have been avoided in the first place.  *runs away to clean up room*  I am so very bored.

      Wheeeee! So there's no one to distract me by talking to me on MSN, so I'll just turn up the music and destroy my eardrums and write something in here.  The most dramatic thing which happened today I would have to say was being bitten by a dog. *nods* That doesn't happen too often. Which is most probably a good thing. Anyways. It was Ms. Burke's dog and I was innocently walking down a corridor and stoppped to see the cute dog. Little did I know that it was actually a tool of the weather gods sent to further punish me for whatever great evil I must have commited to have made them so angry at me. So it started by mercilessly attacking my sweater. We shall disregard the fact that the sweater is rather ugly to start with and a few artistically placed holes might actuallly improve its appearance. So, I tried to rescue my sweater from this clearly ill-meaning dog, and in the process got a lovely tooth mark on my thumb. *frowns* It's actually not that bad. I should live and all that. It looks like it might have healed already.  Exciting thing number two is that I have a new mattress. This is only exciting when you consider that the one I had before this was my mom's before me, which makes approximate dating possible to an age of 45ish. Needless to say, not the most comfortable thing. Now I have a much nicer one which is more comfortable. Unfortunately it is way taller (all those years of gravity must have compacted the old one =P), so I may need something resembling a ladder. The top of my bed is now something like a metre and a third above floor level. If I sporadically fall out of bed I could do myself a serious injury. Yes, I do worry about things like this. That's the sort of higher level thoughts that run through my brain when I'm pretending I'm listening to whoever it is who's talking. Oooo! The secret comes out! I don't actually listen! Shock! Awe! Astonishment!  Hmmm. I am mad at Winamp. It keeps malfunctioning and this is highly aggravating. The Randomness mode isnt working, so everything's playing in order, which bugs me. I like the randomness. If I wanted to listen to songs in order, I'd listen to a CD. *glares at Winamp for awhile*  *gets bored with that*  *dances*  *looks at Chemistry review*  *sighs*  I guess I'd better do it.

      Well I can officially say that after one day of summer school my brain has been smashed into a little pulp. It hurts. *nods* And Grade Eleven Chemistry is rather confusing and hard. Well, when it's not just review.   I'll leave you with all that.  And now Anne will talk about  urlLink Doug Cheatwood , an absolutely amazing musican with  urlLink an incredibly interesting life.  Go to his site, and under  urlLink  "Listen" , download "Digging Up Dinosaurs and Putting Them Together Again (from the  urlLink Stories About Gods and Heroes CD ), then "The Municipal Junkie" (from the  urlLink  The Mini Magic CD) . Those are the two best songs, in my opinion, but he has others you can listen to as well. Go! It's pure genius! Um, if ou're life me and like rather strange music. o_O Whatever, just go.  My radioactive cow now has a name. Tritium. That's after something which is best described  urlLink here . Basically, it's a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. According to science teacher, it is used in the hydrogen bomb. According to  urlLink this source , Tritium is only dangerous if you ingest it, not if you become exposed to it externally. So you can pet or ride or whatever my radioactive cow however much you want, but no radioactive cow burgers. I think this works out quite nicely.  In other news, there is no other news. Good night.

      Good  morning  afternoon!  Since the amazingly multi-wonderful Alice is here from her home in Sheffield (which, from  Threads , we know was destroyed mercilessly by dirty Soviet commies and their nukes) I have spent the last few days trudging around way more of Southern Ontario than I realized actually existed. We've driven around Toronto (the highlight being a statue of a cat on a chair on top of a pole, which I do not understand in the slightest, but still find intruiging, since it was in the middle of the street), gone to the McMichael Gallery of the Group of Seven and other highly wonderful, but nevertheless fairly un-interesting Canadian painters (it looks exactly the same as it did on that art trip back in Grade Five, so you don't really have to go. They have moved the statue of the bear at the entrance though. But it's just to the other side of the door, nothing too drastic, don't worry.), and gone up to moderately northern southern Ontario, otherwise known as Cottage Country.  The trip to the moderately northern southern Ontario was yesterday, so I'll tell you about that. It started by me having to get up incredibly early. This is never a good start to a day, as no doubt millions of schoolchildren can attest. Then, we went downtown. nothing much special or exciting about that, unless you enjoy large highways with smelly trucks. After picking Alice and mother of hers up from downtown hotel (and receiving awesome present of archaeology books about Egypt and England) we got back in car and drove on same large highway with smelly trucks in the opposite direction for a much longer time, to arrive in the glory that is  urlLink Ste. Marie Among the Hurons . This is basically a reconstructed Jesuit mission from way back when Upper Canada was not easily accessible by aforesaid large highway complete with smelly trucks. This was an opportunity to walk around reconstructed old buildings filled with reconstructed old stuff and smoke. Which is quite a charming effect, once you recover from the coughing and watering eyes. These old buildings are also conviently populated with "Jesuits" speaking in terms that I'm sure would have shocked their authentic counterparts, who, incidentally, are / were  urlLink saints . If you have ailmeents you can visit the Martyr's Shrine to them, conviently located directly across the road. Apparently, this other group of 'Indians' didn't like these Holy Jesuits or the way they were 'civilising' them or bringing their exotic diseases to decimate the population. So they killed them. now they've got a shrine and are said to do wonderful miracles if you go kneel before their skull and recite the prayer that is conviently pasted to the bar where your eyes fall when you kneel. Most regretably, I could not kneel, due to a large amount of pilgrims from the real India, who were all very devout. We shall see if this grave transgression on my part negatively affects my humble request.   Actually, it was kind of nice to see that many people all so respectful and devout. Quite a nice contrast to the loud American tourists 'investigating' the church in the actual reconstructed village. I don't care if it is only a recontruction. You do not go into a church so noisy as that, go into the sacresty (sp?) and put on the priest's hat and march up to the altar which has more of the Saint's bones in it and re-arrange things and open the altar-piece and reliqaury (sp? again. My church terms aren't great.). Even if you don't respect the church, respect the dead. *generally fumes*  Then we went on a boat. It was boring. I don't like boats. Therefore, short choppy sentences. There were lots of islands. It was sunny. I got sunburnt. Therefore, boat was generally no fun.  Ok, never mind the short, choppy sentences.  Today is the last day of freedom. *sigh* Tomorrow I get to go back to school and take Grade Eleven Chemistry. How lucky I am. This seemed like a better idea when it wasn't actually happening.  To end, I bring you song lyrics, just because I can.   Arabian Nights, Part Three: Promise, Sarah Brightman   So should I return to chase the shadows of my chases My steps will echo there from sand to stone I will never let my eyelids close on empty spaces My dreams will fill the void with tales unknown Know the mighty infinite obscures the far horizon Alone And will the wind return my story to its promise Or will my story chase me to the end

      Wheee! So yesterday was a great day of fun at  urlLink this place . That's the Renn Faire for people too lazy to hover over that link for long enough.  Despite feeling completly like death cooled down a few notches in the morning, I survived the drive over there and after a little while I was feeling as right as rain, which is an expression that I think is very silly indeed. It was supposed to rain actually, but by not listening to the weather person, rain was sucessfully avoided and the ever contradictory weather gods decided to make it boiling hot instead. Just because they can, I suppose.  I love going to the Renn Faire. There's so many cool little store/booth things selling incredibly neat stuff that you don't see often at all. I'm not a person who runs around very hyperly and excessively joyously when I'm very excited, but if I was, I would have been.  I would just like to say that the 'privies' are disgusting. I am completly and utterly scarred for life. Right. Now that's said, on to more pleasant things.  I have no clue what the chronilogical order of the day was. In fact, I'm not even sure how to spell chronological anymore, but I'm too lazy to go look in a dictionary, and I think I got it right the second time anyway, so, um, there!  Let's start with stores, cause like I said, they were awesome.  urlLink The House of Musical Traditions  is easily one of the most highly fascinating stores I've been in. I remember that from last time. Britney and Ei tried to get me to play this drum, but I'm not a very rhythm-y sort of person when it comes to playing, so I was an evil idiot and refused. Then Ei went off and did her amazingly talented harp playing *gives Ei some medals cause she deserves them* and I found the most beautiful and nice sounding flute that I have ever seen. *falls in love* =P It was made out of rosewood and had only one key.  urlLink See?  (scroll down to the bottom, it's the "One Keyed Flute") Unfortunately, very beautiful things also have very impossible prices, so it's still there.  There were also  urlLink some   urlLink shops  which sold sharp pointy thing like swords and knives and daggers and axes and other highly dangerous things that children under eighteen aren't allowed to go near. I think that's highly unfair, but we were allowed to stay anyway, so it's alright. Again, highly expensive stuff, even if we were allowed to buy it.  Then there's the jewelry stores which are also awesome and I think I need a better stock of adjectives because these ones are wearing thin now, and the last thing we want to do is slip into the realm of the cliche! *horrifed gasps are heard* That's what I thought.  Anyways, I got a  urlLink really nice necklace  from  urlLink here , and an earcuff (which looks something like  urlLink this ) from  urlLink here . Yes, this is the same items from the same places as I bought last year, but trust me, they look different. *nods convincingly* Oh look! You're convinced! How wonderful! We can move on!  Time to talk about the shows we saw. Now, apart from the tail end of some utterly incomprehensible play, we saw two others. The jousting, which although claims were made to the contrary, looked remarkably staged, so it gets show status. Fun stuff, but it's way sweltering sitting on that hill.  Then came the  urlLink Men in Tights , who were as hillarious as last year, and go see them and I'm getting tired of writing so I think I'm going to end up after a couple more rather inferiorly descriptive paragraphs.  So after all this fun, which, like I said before, was not described in chronological order, we sat around in  urlLink very comfy chairs  and my watch had a little heart attack and gave up on working. (For anyone else interested in completly useless bits of suplementary information, it stopped at exactly 6:32 PM and 24 or 25 seconds. It can't make up its mind. Its twitching between the two. There's still hope! CLEAR!)  Then we were leaving and we stopped by this psychic's tent and tried to pronounce "lithomancy" for so long that she walked over and started to explain not only how to say it, but what exactly it is for awhile, which I thought was rather interesting, but I suppose I'm just a bit odd like that.  So that's it. We went home and it was all over. But it'll happen again next year (hopefully) (right? wrong? somewhere in between?) and I'll actually buy the horns that I said I was going to buy this time.  *goes away*

      Wow, I just forgot how to spell my sign-in name. I feel so stupid, especially since it was right in front of my eyes, cause it's the same as my sign-in name for something else.  *cries for a little while*  I am pleased to say that my room is probably about half cleaned up now. I've been getting rid of so much, it's awesome! I have almost nothing now! It's exciting! I didn't need all that in the first place. *sends things to Goodwill*  I love Ikea. I went there again yesterday. It's kinda sad that I know where mostly everything is. *sigh* I bought boxes cause I'm massively practical like that! Wheeeeeee!  Yesterday I also got a futon. Wheeeee! x2!!! It's pretty and comfortable and I can't be bothered saying much more about it.  As a souvenir from wherever she went, my mom brought me this Russian doll. (She went to Russia then I guess. That would make sense anyway. Unless there was just a Russian store at wherever she went, sent to confuse relatives who were brought souvenirs.) She's got a big white hanky sewn into her hand. *grins* Since there's no way she could have known about the whole big white hanky thing, this confirms my suspicions that she's actually psychic. Which is rather scary. *hides*  I hate pushy people. Don't make me do things. Telling me exactly what to do, just makes me not want to do it, because I'm odd that way.  Next topic. Uh, there's really not much to say.  What would you like me to talk about?

      I am up far too early for a day in the summer.  And I've been up for about three and a bit hours.  *falls over and dies*  Pfah to people who turn the radio on really loud when they get up. Pfah to people who flood the house with the smell of coffee early in the morning. Pfah to people in general.  Yes, dear mommy is home.  I would just like to take this moment to say that Toronto International Airport is really really big. Terminal One that is. It is so big it takes a while to walk through it, end to end. It also has many different levels, easily accessible by escalators. Which is a word I have never really been confident about my spelling of.  That said, I still had time to walk around this gigantic terminal, on every single level, in the time before my mother's flight was due in and the time when she actually arrived.  *glares in the general direction of pilots and air traffic controllers (I've been informed that the plane was innocent, so I shall not be accusing it of any wrongdoing)*  I can also safely accuse Terminal One of Toronto International Airport of being boring.  I am perfectly aware that Toronto International Airport is actually called Pearson International Airport, thank you. But I don't live in Pearson. I understand that to fully show our appreciation for various past heads of state we must name large landmark buildings rather illogically after them, so we can have fun confusing tourists and any slightly dimwitted locals. I do believe this is what we have things like mountains, lakes and other not as remarkable geological features for.  It looks dark and gloomy outside.  Pretty.  I thought of this entire huge post last night which was all very intelligent and witty, but unfortunately I fell asleep and it all fell out of my brain. I hope the landing didn't hurt it and that it is finding happiness wherever it went.  This house is very very quiet. It is unnerving.  I have absolutely nothing to write about. But I don't feel like pressing 'Publish' just yet, which is undoubtedly a unwise idea since I am half asleep and making all sorts of typing errors, since I can't think straight.  There is a gigantic chocolate bar on the floor here that I didn't see before. I sincerely hope I'm not hallucinating. It's real! And due to it's mysterious appearance, probably filled with poison or addictive drugs. *puts it back* I've always been taught not to eat candy that I find. Presumably this rule still goes, even though I'm in my own house.  Speaking about strange candy, don't read the ingredients in Russian chocolate. They will scare you. What exactly is "Food phosphatide concentrate" anyways? And why is the fifth ingredient alcohol? And why did they put almond in quoatation marks, with the note afterwards that it is identical to natural flavours? Do I want to know the answers to these questions? I used to like Russian chocolate (especially that one which was an Aero bar rip-off! That one was good!), but I don't think I want any anymore.  Moral of today's story : If you like the food, don't read the ingredients.  One last thing before I get kicked off the computer. I was walking around the university a couple days ago, and there was this message board with graffiti on it, and the graffiti said:   Little brother watches back.   Which made me laugh for awhile.

       Hmmmm.  Everyone seems to be going on holiday. Although I do not begrudge them this at all, it makes for a rather boringly lonely time on MSN.  My mom has all these post-it notes on her shelves describing what the piles of paper on the shelves are. Some examples:    Micro stuff (Mac stuff)  THIS MUST BE READ FIRST!!!  Need to be incorporated (or not)  Neat ideas (?)  To be read  Stuff to do with that     It's good to know I'm not the only person in this family who's filing system doesn't make sense.    Wait. I don't have a filing system. I just randomly put sheets of paper in piles or heaps on the floor and hope for the best.      *sigh*  I killed off that character I was talking about earlier this morning. I'm still not happy with it. But at least it's done, so I can shape it up in the future if I need to. Which I will need to.   I'm still thinking about a possible plot or theme for the story. I'm thinking something to do with World War Two, cause I'm weirdly historically obsessed like that. I want to do something about the firebombing of Dresden, cause I don't think we learn enough about that. *considers* And then I want to explore reasons for why we suffer as well. Cause, you know, I killed off a completely innocent character up there, and that's not fair, so why isn't it fair? Or maybe it is fair... Oho! Deep thoughts!  Right, that's enough of that for summer.  My dad told me yesterday about how the Allies bombed Dresden in World War Two and no one knows just how many people died, because everyone was completly burnt. Since the streets were filled with refugees living in tents, they don't even know how many people were there in the first place.   And those people who killed innocent people in a refugee camp were never brought to trial.  And neither were the people who dropped the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  *shakes head and loses faith in humankind*  I think my facts were right there. Although I'm opinionated, so I'm sympathetic to one side here. *nods*  So today we're going to IKEA apparently. That should be mildly interesting. I think I'll try to see if we can rent some movies on the way back. Suggestions anyone?
