      The year is more than half gone and I'm left to wonder if I've accomplished anything... I feel that everyday I grow a little and &nbsp;learn more about myself... but can I call that an accomplishment? After talking to my best friend today I drowned in thoughts... Thoughts of my life, of my present and my future... I'm a very anxious person and thinking about the future always makes me even more so... She made me stop and think... what do I want? I don't know... I don't know, really... That scares me... I wonder if I'm mediocre to have such vain concerns. I feel that there is much more that I need to do and somehow I don’t get around it… What is my problem????????????? The problem is that only I can find the answer…&nbsp;

      I love men but they are such bastards...They always screw you when you least expect it, and because we are women we get upset and keep thinking that we did something wrong... Well, you know what?! &nbsp;I did nothing wrong! You men did!!! You should have been more caring when I needed you, more loving when I asked you to, and you should have been there for me, like I was there for you!! Screw you all! I want someone who will love me for who I am! For now my friend's and family love will do...

      I don't know if I'm too sensitive, but the world seems worse everyday... Everyday people die or kill each other... The economy gets worse, people disappoint you... I don't know... They say that shit happens, but that much shit!? I read the news and nothing makes me happy about it... Just the fact that I know what's going on in the world! At least I'm not like most people who choose not to know, who live in ignorance, who thrive in their mediocre ways... What a shity life to live! Reality is bad but it's all we've got, so please don't run away from it... Don't take the easy way out! I used to think little of myself, but now I know that I'm better than many people, and that is good enough for me! I have no dreams of being the best, just the best that I can be! I feel good!

      I love myself... Do you know why... because that's who matters the most! I'm really tired of asking people to love me... They can love me if they want to, but I WILL ALWAYS LOVE MYSELF, ALWAYS!!!!!!!!!!
