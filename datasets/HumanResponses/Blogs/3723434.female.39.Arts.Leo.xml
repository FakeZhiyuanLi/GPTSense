      I was thinking today like I almost never do, but today I was thinking. I watched two people buy music. One a girl all in black with her hair dyed vamp red and her nails polished black. She has a CD with a dark foreboding cover and she was very pleased with herself for having saved up her money to buy the latest in the gothic top ten.  Then a man come next and he had a mullet and a stained shirt advertisings a beer and a old brown pleather jacket his CD had some guy on front with jeans and a big guitar and a even bigger hat.  I realize we are what we listen too our lives are what we hear. That girl does  not wear big pants and white make up and listen to Conway Twitty (I’ve always like that name) and if you suggested it she’s rather die. She was not born wearing black clothes, she started wearing them when she found the music she stared reading vampire books when she met someone at school who was playing this music or when she turned on the TV and saw a video. She didn’t stop going to church with her parent or sneak and get a illegal tattoos until her music taste change from humming along with the top ten playing on her Mickey mouse radio when she was eight, to searching for the underground collage station on her computer.  The man’s ears would probably started to bleed if he was taken to a Slipknot concert or to see Nelly he would choke on imported beer and puke out sushi. But give him a steak, a Bud and Clint Black and he’s in heaven. Which is also something he believes in avidly.  So there you have it    if you want to know all there is about someone look at their music collection because that’s who we are. Puberty is not when you grow-up sex dose not define you. Your race has noting to do with it. The meaning of life is when you get the music country, rock, punk, classical, etc it’s who we are it makes us who we are.

          What’s the longest anyone has ever cried. I’ve been crying for three years. What am I crying about you might ask? I’m crying for the  lost dreams and hops. I’m crying for all mistakes and missed opportunities. About what I am and what I wanted to be. I’m crying for injustice  and the lack of mercy in the world. I’m crying because no one wears lace or dresses for dinner, linen napkins are now used to dry dishes, the dinning room table hold computer parts.   I’m crying because we all work our assess off and get fired for being late or not paying a quarter for a drink. I’m crying because we can’t feel safe in our homes or our jobs. Fear has become normal we fear everything our jobs. the police, our country’s leaders, taxes bill collectors we live in fear every day we have to follow the line or we will lose everything and someone is standing behind every rock waiting to take it away and so I cry I cry and I cry and I’m afraid if someone finds out that I’ve been crying for three years they will take me away
