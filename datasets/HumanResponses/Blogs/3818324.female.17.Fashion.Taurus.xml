      "Why don't you just crucify me, nail me to a cross. Bite and scratch and make me scream, if that will get you off!" Lyrics from London After Midnight.  Those Lyrics are how I feel right now. Today I'm not in the fucking mood to beat around the bush about how I feel. I'm fed up with so many things.  I've been sick with a bloody stomach flu type thing since Monday, and well being lathargic and having no one there to just hold you is so fucking annoying. What am I bitching about? I'm sure any female who reads this has bitched about the exact same fucking thing, so its nothing you havn't read before, and if you havn't read it truthfully then you've thought of it.   My relitaves just got here frmo England, they're staying with us for three days. *spins a finger in the air sarcasticly* whoopty fucking doo. I guess its no big suprise, I havn't seen them in five freaking years. The only good thing I can think comeing out of this family rondevouz would proabbly be that I got my bass tuned.  Lets see, the only real development in my life besides that... Nero. I'm going to Toronto to play Nero. The highlight of my summer, that and Renn Fest. This summer will not have a bloody highlight so far that I can see. I've seen my friends twice, well two of them anyway. I've been talking to the others on MSN, well at least the ones that don't think its ok to ignore me because it IS infact the summer.  One male I do have an attraction to (that is suprisingly more than physical) was sopposed to go to Nero aswell, but it turns out he's working. So much to my dispare I won't get to spend the weekend with him. At least there are other people there I guess... though I&nbsp;was looking forward to it. Unfortunately its yet another thing that does not turn out how I'd like it to  &nbsp;

      Wonderland, heh, my Wonderland is a place where I have emotions that don't land me in a horrable place after. I'm writing this from the true and black depths of my black little heart. Everything I say is true, and I need to get this out, regardless of who or what reads it:  Emotions just fuck me over in the end, its all god damn pantomime! Never once have I ever felt anything for anyone that was returned without a slap in the face! The only person in my life, I ever loved, who loved me back to the best of my knowledge gave me what I thought the point to be the best gift ever. Whenever I was depressed he'd just let me sleep in his arms for as long as I needed to. Or he would cry with me when everything just became too hard. Now I'm nothing! Its better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all?!? Thats bullshit! Because once you've loved and lost it, you have nothing at all!  Those times when he used to hold me are now haunting me. We used to go to a friend's house and just sleep in the couch, not doing anything... just sleeping, or crying, or shareing the sweet serenity that was each other's silent thoughts. Now when I look at a couch, or a bed, with the intention of sleeping I'm just haunted by everything. I can't sleep, sometimes I wake up wrapped so tightly in my blankets I think he's there, sometimes I can even smell his lavander after-shave. Its all pantomime, pretending somethings there when its not.  I'm the Queen of Fools, to think that with every possible male I might find that something I'm missing. I've yet to find any mate in life that holds up long enough to see me cry, none do, and I doubt any ever will. My expectations are too high, especially for one such as myself.   I'm 17 years old, I've loved once and lost ever since. This Wonderland is just a dream, a world where people mean what they say.. and emotions are all they're cracked up to be.  Its pathetic I know. Trust me, I know.

      First let me introduce myself. I'm Arsenic or the Black Umbrella Girl... either or works. I'm 17 years old, metaly ill so my doctors say, though I think they were just being sarcastic, and some mixed up mess between gothic\punk\and rockstar. Don't ask about rockstar, people get the impression I'm famous from my appearence and mannerisums I guess. I don't look like one, most of the time I look like I just woke up... because I probably did.   Well, well... The unfortunate day has come... I'M HERE! Though more than likely anyone who reads this has probably scrolled over it looking for some kind of porpose, I'll tell you in advance There isn't one!  Lets see, anything I can write about? AH yes! I spent the entire day at Niagra trying to find some sort of word to discribe all the bordom suffered. Then I realized bored is about it. It really isn't a pretty thing to sit next to Lake Ontario and eat lunch. I wasn't sure weather I'd vomit or die. The water smelled like raw sewage, there was dead fish in the water... and people were letting their children swim in it! *shudders*  I have nothing to do at all, Canada day used to be reserved for sparklers and alcohol... but I rarely drink anyway, and I find playing with sparkers ends in setting things on fire. However I'm not allowed to play with sparklers anymore, and a grapefruit cooler is about all I really want. So looks like I'll be home watching sick humored movies and writing stories.  Well thats it for my first blog thing. *tips hat* Untill next time! Arsenic Malice, signing out! PAINT YOUR HOUSE BLACK!
