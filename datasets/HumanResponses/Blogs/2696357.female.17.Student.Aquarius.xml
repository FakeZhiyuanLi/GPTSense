      OMG, i haven't posted in almost 2 months.  I have sooo much to talk about!  Starting with three weekends ago, I went to jake's party!!!! I dragged Laura along because i didn't want to show up by myself.  Well, I got there and was surprised to see Tom, Boghard, Mike, Alex, Patrick, Teddy, Jimmy, and Will there.   I was prepared though because i dressed up in a short frilly jean skirt, a purple tube top, and a jeweled dangly belt, which was SOOOO hot!!   WEll, needless to say, I immediately went out on the dance floor and started to shake my thang!!  Kevin was ALL over me...like his hands were up my skirt..ummmm, just a little too forward!! i also danced with jake and joe & then of course by myself to give all the hotties a show :)  Anyways, Kevin left with his friends at like 10 pm & he called me wanting me to come over to soren's house.  Laura's parents wanted her home so I managed to find my way to soren's house by like 10:30 pm.  As soon as I got there, Kevin came out of the house and started making out with me.  He was like, come on amy, let's hang out in your car.  Knowning what that REALLY meant, well...i was like i need some alcohol.  Therefore, we proceeded to go inside and i took 3 shots of vodka....which kevin claimed would "loosen me up".  Every 5 seconds he'd be like amy, come upstairs or amy, come to the basement with me.  At one point I did come upstairs...and all the guys (tom, boghard, jimmy, teddy, soren, chris) all gave me this "u're gonna give him ass look" as i went upstairs.  WEll, to their surprise, I came back down 1 minute later and was like I'm just gonna chill with you guys.  Kevin, being mad that I rejected him in front of everyone (basically I told him i didnt wanna hook up with him again) decided to go off somewhere.   Meanwhile, I sat down on the couch and jimmy started to spin this crazy looking owl on soren's table.  Its eyes freaked me out so I decided to kick it off.  Teddy was fighting me to leave it on and we began to wrestle.  *DRUMROLL*  While we were wrestling, my tube top (I WASN'T WEARING A BRA) came completely off and I flashed the entire room.  At that moment, I was convinced that only teddy saw and it was only off for like 2 seconds.  However, I found out later that it was off for more like a couple minutes and EVERYONE saw!!!  On monday, I ran into boghard and we talked about kevin being an ass.  He was like, "Im glad u came...at least you made some new friends!"   Well, later that week I find out from Frances that boghard thought my boobs were the perfect size and my nipples were perfect too because they weren't "off kilter"  and were the "perfect color and tone".   HEHE, I'll take that as a compliment then.  Little did I know that the guys not only saw my tits, but they studied them too!    Then, that friday, April 30, my art teacher, Mrs. Shark, asked me to pose for my art class because we are working on gesture drawings.  Since she knows I dance, she wanted me to get into my ballet gear and do dance poses for the class to recreate.  OMG, i was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO nervous.   I ended up standing on a platform in the middle of the artroom in my leotard, ballet shoes, and tights for a hour and a half performing various moves.  To make matters worse, Jimmy is in my art class as is Sam, who constantly flirts with me (as i do to him).  Well, Sam kept screaming "Amy is hot" when I stood up there, especially when i put my leg over my head.  I guess they were thinking i would be good in bed.  Anyways, I got even more attention from Kevin's group of friends.   Well, I'm off to dance.  Just wanted to recap on the important/ memorable events in my life.  Lots of love :)

      HELL YEAH!   *BREATHING SIGH OF RELIEF*  I took the Ap chem test today and surprisingly it wasn't all that bad.  I'm thinking I got a 4, which makes me ecstatic!  Last friday, May 7th, I had Ap History, which I totally aced.  Ummm, hello 5!!!  Anyways, after the test, I left early and chilled with laura at the mall.  Then i got up extremely early on Saturday morning with my dad to go to Dulles Airport for my cousin's college graduation.  I slept the entire plane ride and we  got to Detriot at about 10 am.  My cousin picked us up at the airport and drove us to Toledo, Ohio.  My entire family was chilling at this adorable Bed and Breakfast, which we rented for the occasion.  I dressed up in this sexy, slinky black dress, managed to make it through the graduation without falling asleep, and ate some really awesome food back at the B & B.  Later that evening, my cousin invited his roommates over to hang out & we all got pretty wasted.  Even my dad and uncle were doing keg stands (funniest sight ever!)   So yeah, since my relatives were trashed, I ended up going with my cousin and his friends back to their house for a kick-ass party.  After  a few more shots, I started dancing with my cousin's friend matt, who was soooooooooo hot!   Immediately we hit it off, found somewhere to talk, and then started to makeout in his room.   The hook up was awesome...he was a total HOTTIE!  Since the party didn't break up until like 3 am, I ended up crashing at the house. Matt even gave me his bed :)       When I got back on sunday, I talked to Kevin online and he asked me how my weekend was.  I told him what happened and his exact words were "ughh disgusting, i can't believe you hooked up with a 22 year old".  Pshh, he was just jealous that he can't have this!! In fact, today in physics, Mr. Howard said something about how it was a good thing i took this honors class and was glad I didn't leave it in the beginning of the year.  Then he was like "right Kevin?"...and Kevin goes "No, she can leave".  Uhuh, this is coming from the mouth of the same guy that one week earlier wanted to look up my skirt and hook up with me.  BITTER!!  During our parade, which is sorta like our own chill time, we usually all play capitalism (me, tj, sam, and kevin), but today Kevin decided to talk smack about me & his friend Sam to Jessica and Tammy.  Whatever, I didn't care that much because I found out that Sam broke up with his girlfiend!!  That means there is a small possibility that he will aske ME to prom.  Omg, that would rock.  Sam is sooooo funny, cute, smart, tall, and has  a nice bod :)  So, we'll see what happens tomorrow.  Peace, i'm off to cook for my fam...

       Venus and Neptune take a turn today, and you'll get a second chance with a friend or date you might have crossed signals with recently. Let Neptune work its magic on you, and you'll have reason to believe that things happen for a reason. Sometimes the sweetest things take a little time to ripen.  So my horoscope says that i'll get a second chance with a friend (ummmm, sam!!!!) and finally have a date to prom because it is on June 12!!! I have the perfect dress with matching shoes, purses, necklace, and earings.

      So teddy pretty much summed up what I want in a guy.  He goes "you want someone who is funny, good looking, good dancer or wants to dance, must be taller than you, can talk to ya normally so there are no awkward silences, and smart."  Well, despite the truth in these words, I can't seem to find a guy that both fits the criteria and wants to go to prom with me.  Sure, 5 guys have asked me to go with them so far and the dance is still three weeks away.  (One of these 5 guys though was a hot random guy that I met in the mall while shopping.   He came up to me, asked for a hug, and started flirting with me.  Then, when I get up to leave, he proceeds to follow me to my car & hints that we should have sex in my car.  My excuse that I'm "a good girl" doesn't discourage his motives.  When I turn him down, he says "I'm not leaving without your number".   It turns out that he is 22 years old and although, I tell him that im only 17, he responds "I won't tell if you don't.")*sigh*      On another note, I found out from TJ that Sam isn't going to ask me to prom.  This is probably due to the fact that he is a) a Mormon b) friends with Kevin, who I'm positive still likes me c) doesn't like my friend Laura.   Despite this setback, there is still hope.  *crosses fingers*   My friend Laura is going with this guy named James, who she has known all her life.  He is a freshman at Elon, good looking, sings and plays the guitar.   He lives in Pittsburgh, but is coming down to take Laura to prom as a favor.  He is planning on bringing a friend along to keep him company & perhaps be my date if I don't get one myself.  So basically, if this whole ordeal works out, I'll be on a blind date for prom.   All in all, I've decided to take this one day at a time.  It is the only way that I can manage to stay somewhat sane.

           God, the weekend went by so damn fast.   On friday, I took my chem cummulative test and then had an extremely interesting Ap History class.   We were "supposed" to be researching for/working on our rough draft of our group report on the foreign policy for the upcoming democratic convention.  However, Rajai, Seth, and Chris had to write a paper for something in English and asked me to help.  I had already read and written a paper on the Great Gatsby, which I totally aced by the way, and was like sure I'd help.  Well, needless to say, we drifted off-topic and they didn't get any work done.  The conversation all started when I was handing Pat an article about Kerry for him to use and on it was an advertisment for the "south beach diet".  Chris saw it and thought I was looking up diets and he was like OMG, Amy, don't diet.  So, for the rest of class they kidded me that I was like 500 lbs.   Throughout this conversation, I realized that they believed I had gone through a sudden "transformation".  They said things like "amy, on wednesday, when you came in with that black halter dress, we didn't even recognize you.  We said, damn, she looks so fine!"  That comment of course, made me feel good because my ego was bruised upon finding out that Sam wasn't going to ask me to prom. Now I've realized that the guys actually do notice what i wear :)       Later that afternoon, once school had let out, I went to the mall with Tracy.  After she bought shoes for graduation, we headed over to the movie theatre to see Troy. Omg, it was awesome.  I loved the sword fighting, even though there could have been more blood.  O well, it was SO worth just seeing Brad Pitt.  It was like *instant orgasm" when I saw him.  God, the rock hard chest and abs is such a big turn on for me.  hehehe     On Saturday, I had dance, which was the reason I couldn't go to HFS.  Argh! After dance, I bought a new bathing suit (even though I already have nine :) ) because my mom was like "it looks hot on you".  HAHA, wow, this coming from my mother.  Who would have thought??!  Anyways, I washed my car in my new suit and then got ready to go out.  First, I went to Dulles for a sort time, then headed out to reston.  While I was walking around, I managed to run into you guessed it....SAM, david, teddy, and jamie.  Sam proceeded to turn around literally six times to stare at me.  (Probably because I looked hot in a tiny tank top with a short miniskirt)  After saying hi, I continued to walk around, only to be stopped by some random guy telling me to get in his car.  I was like *today is not a good day to get raped*.  Upon escaping him, I sat down at a bench to talk to Laura and suddenly these guys from the top of the parking garage were like come up here.  When I didn't, they decided to come to me.  It was all good because I met this cute guy named Tom, who is a senior at Herndon and plays the guitar.  He asked for my number, which I gave him, and he said we should hang out sometime. Hmm, I wonder when he will call.  Guys never wanna seem "desperate".   *rolls eyes*  ~peace

          Well, i succeeded in beating my problem for what...like almost two days and then let it go all down the drain. FUCK!  Anyways, on a more depressing note, I'm not sure if I will even have a backup date to prom because James's friends are pretty busy.  However, the only good news of the night came at like 9:30 when Tom called me.  He wanted to know if I would like to hang out on friday and I was like why not.  At this moment, I'm waiting for him to get his ass online so I can talk/get to know the guy.  And what do u know??? He just got on.  I'll tell ya how the conversation goes.  ~I'm out~ :)

         Quote of the day:   "Eyes are the key to your soul".  *pondering my moment of brillance* hehe     So yeah, I love that quote.  Seriously though, eyes are like the coolest thing about a person.  You can uncover an unbelievable amount of info just by gazing into their eyes.  *sigh*  Anyways, school was for the most part, uneventful.   Sam, Kevin, and I never talk anymore, which isn't surprising.  Physics was kinda cool...if you like walking in 95 degree heat looking at transformers while dodging a billion noisy cicadas in high heels.  History was "interesting" because I happened to wear a tight aqua halter dress...and I'm positive the guys noticed.  Chris came up to me and was like "hey, its amy...my favorite girl in history" and rajai immediately started teasing me. Even though our rough draft is due on thursday, I did absolutely nothing in that class.  (I have an A!!!!)   Therefore, I spent the entire class period chatting it up with Seth, who I think is adorable.   In fact, he doesn't have a date to prom either, and his b-day is even on prom!! AWWWW :)   I'd go with him.   Hahaha, we talked about my crazy dance schedule and he was like you must be really flexible...i was like hehe, yeah...is that a bad thing *wink*    Ohh, and last night, I talked to Tom until like 12 in the morning.  He seems pretty cool: he plays hockey, the guitar, writes, is going to U of Wisconsin, and works at clydes.  Besides being cute, he wants to hang out on friday, which is cool.  I'll inform you of the details when I talk to him tonight :)  *~later hun!~*

      ERRRRRRRR!~I can't believe that I haven't overcome my prob by now. That's it. I'm stopping this starting tom.   After all, the title of my blog is "New Era".  I need to take advantage of it.   On a lighter note, today was pretty easy. I took a history SOL, which I totally dominated.   God, that class is so funny.  Especially with Rajai shouting at me/ jokingly saying "God, Amy, stop laughing...you can't look at me with a straight face".  He is right though, but I can't help it if he cracks me up :)  Its obvious that he digs me.  Hey, its all good *SMILES IN A CUTE WAY* hehehe Ahh, quote of the day:  "No one worth possessing can be quite possessed". Ummm, self-explanatory, but it SOOO fits me.  Until next time...

      *Shakes head, then apologizes profusely* Wow, its been such a long time since I updated this thing and I feel as though the world is missing a whole piece of my life. So here goes... The highlights of June included the following: meeting Tom's adorable best friend Casey as well as his friends Sam, Ben, BK, Eric, and Jared. I ended up going to their afterprom party at Herndon (To this day, I still don't have any clue how I managed to sleep over at the hotel without the parentals finding out!) The party was fucking amazing...I got piss drunk, got naked in the shower and hot tub and then passed out/ hooked up on the bed with Casey. Somehow Tom and I never seemed to hit it off. He definately isn't my type and has earned the title of a "stalker". No joke, believe me. I'll explain later on *sigh* In admidst studying for finals, I atended Langley's prom. Of course the best part was the beautification process. If you want to see pics from prom and just me in general...you can go to yahoo photo gallery. urlLink http://photos.yahoo.com/cutedancer03  Laura was such a bitch at Prom and the entire night for that matter. She basically got pissed that her date, who was an old family friend, was more into me than her. For example, she refused to let him even dance with me! *Arghh* Anyways, I ended up going to Prom single, which wasn't too bad. Kristin, who went to Herndon's afterprom with me, (ka my other half since we have so much in common!!) shared her date with me. Haha, we basically had a threesome going on...ahhh...hehehehe good times.
