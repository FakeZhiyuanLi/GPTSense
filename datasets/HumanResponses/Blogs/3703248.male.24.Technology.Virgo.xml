      When I first started using the World Wide Web I started on Netscape v. 2.0.  It seemed fantastic at the time, but I was even more impressed when Netscape v. 3.0 was released.  Finally after I met my wife and used her old x486sx with Windows 95 I first laid eyes on Internet Explorer v. 3.0.  I have used Internet Explorer from v. 3.0 to v. 6.0 and now once again I believe it is time for change.  While Internet Explorer is a fast, free, and  a reliable web browser, it has one HUGE HUGE HUGE problem….. SECURITY….  For the past several hours I have been using Mozilla’s FireFox 0.9.1 and have visited sites that would have just demolished my computer if I viewed them with IE.  Also during this entire time I have not received a single popup.  Even with a popup blocker while using I.E, I still had a tremendously hard time completely avoiding popups.

      I must applaud Michael Moore for Fahrenheit 9/11.  I saw the movie on opening night in Tupelo Mississippi 6/25/2004 at the 7:35PM showing.  It was a powerful movie that dragged me through an entire range of emotions.  It would take through both laughter and extreme sadness.  For the first time ever I saw an audience applaud a movie.  It was a superior documentary and I believe everyone age 13 and up should see it.

      Today was a magnificent day.  For the past several weeks my wife has been on dialysis due to poor kidney function.  As of today her creatinine levels have returned to almost normal levels, she currently has 50% kidney function and does not need dialysis.  At this point I am ecstatic and I am hoping for a full recovery.   I feel bad for anyone who has to endure dialysis.  Imagine three times a week, having to go sit in a chair, unable to movie for five hours while every drop of blood in you is removed, filtered, and reinserted into your body.  That to me…would suck……!

      Today I weigh 255.5 pounds.  That’s a far cry from what I started at (315 pounds) a little over a year ago.  My goal weight is 200 pounds; anything below that I believe will be too thin.  During the past year I have gone from a person who couldn’t run 1/8th mile, to someone who could run at my highest 10 miles.  Currently I am able to run 2 miles, but my goal is 26.2 miles, so I have gone in reverse far as my training.  Losing weight is hard for me, but gaining it is easy.  I don’t have a fast metabolism, but running helps make up for my cursed genetics.  My goal is to lose the 55.5 pounds extra by Christmas, but doing that will fairly be difficult.  Everyone’s body is different.  It is this fact that no diet will work for everyone.  I enjoy carbohydrates too much to punish myself by eating the Atkins diet.  My method of dieting is to rapidly try things and adapt to what works.  Sometimes it is successful, sometimes it is not, but the body seems to change so what works now, may not work in two or three weeks.  Damn.

      People need to protect themselves.  I don’t understand how in today’s age people can have promiscuous sex and not use protection.  My wife’s best friend now has herpes.  Why?  Because she met someone online, they met offline, and he shot his load inside her.  He infected her with herpes.  When she confronted him through AOL Instant Messenger he just laughed about it.  Meanwhile she was forced to go from someone who was having sex with thirty different guys to having sex with none.  Some people say it doesn’t feel natural to wear a condom.  My response always is, “So does the burning itch of herpes feel natural?”  Other people say, “It can’t happen to me.” My response is usually, “Bullshit!”  I am not opposed to having hot steamy casual sex with everyone you can get your hands on, but by refusing to use protection you are saying you don’t give a fuck about yourself or your partner.  The worst kind of person is one who takes the risk, contracts the disease, and then spends the rest of their life bitching about it.  My wife’s friend does this constantly.  She won’t shut up about how she’s infected and how her life is ruined.  Take your chances if you want, but just remember, having an STD is not sexy, it doesn’t feel natural, and it can happen to you.  Care enough about yourselves to use protection.  If you do contract the disease due to your own stupidity, don’t bitch about it.

      For the past month or so I have heard a lot of buzz around the new mail system that Google has come out with in beta called GMail.  I anxiously awaited my invitation to join and finally it arrived.  The thing I notice first and I assume everyone does is the 1000 MBs of storage capacity.  This and the clean look is what sets Google apart from the rest of Web Based email.  In my opinion the most important thing about GMail is not the 1000 MBs of storage, but the clean look to it.  Opening GMail, Yahoo, and Hotmail side by side, GMail is the only one not plagued with tons of banner ads.   In the near future GMail will start with the Google Adwords, but AdWords in general are much less annoying than banners, popups, and popunders.  They allow me to focus more on the content than the ads, but at the same time AdWords are more relevant than the normal banner ad which means sometimes even I click on them to read their content.  In summary GMail is the Ferrari of web mail services.  It’s clean, fast, reliable, and good looking.  The only thing I see lacking is the inability to use POP3 email which is why GMail could never be my primary email service.

      I have never used a blog before.  I don’t really read them often, but some people have some interesting ideas.  I really don’t think I am a person with interesting ideas as much as they are unique.  I am starting this blog mainly to keep up with my day to day happenings as a memory tool kind of.  Just something so I don’t forget my entire life.  I could care less if anyone ever reads this.  Truly my life is not all that entertaining so anybody who does read my blog will probably fall asleep.  I’ve often tried to keep Journals in the past.  They either get lost or destroyed.  Sometimes they would go months or yeas without being written in.  I am going to try to continue posting using the blog, but if I don’t.  I’m sure it will just be another thing that will be lost in time.

         I thought I, Robot is a decent movie, but not a great movie.    It has a shameless product placement ad for Converse All Star Sneakers.    In the movie the shoes were “Vintage 2004”.    If Will Smith had focused more on the task at hand and less on the damn footwear it would have been a much better movie.      <>  Even with the advertising, it was still a movie worth seeing.    I want a sequel, but I doubt one could be made where it is actually worth watching.

         For the past couple of weeks things have been pretty good.    My wife is on a well deserved vacation in   Savannah  , GA.    She has been though    a lot lately with renal failure, blood clots, and other horrible painful problems.    Hopefully she will come back today fully rejuvenated and ready for veterinary college this fall.    I am excited for her and I hope it isn’t too hard on her.             My job is going great; I failed to do a migration of MS Exchange 2000 to its new hardware.    It was a domain controller which is where I believe the migration problems started.    The entire firm’s email was down for four days, now luckily it’s over with.    Now that the Exchange server is finally migrated I can begin working on other issues.             My diet is going well though I went high protein, medium fat, and low carb.    It wasn’t due to hunger or anything but greed.    After reading about ketosis I decided to jump on the metabolic advantage bandwagon.    October the 6 th  I plan on going back to my high protein, medium carb and low fat diet.    While I am having no problems with being on this diet, it just doesn’t feel right to eat this much fat even if weight loss does occur rapidly.    I only want to achieve and maintain 180-200 pounds.                 Maybe things will continue to go well… I am studying for a MCP certification exam now.    It’s taking a lot of time.

      Many people say it is not safe to lose more than one or two pounds a week…  Many people say to start an exercise program gradually to avoid injury…  I worry those people may be right…  I have finally found a diet that really really works for me…  For the past year I have been slowly adjusting my diet and exercise trying new things, trying a variety of techniques.  Finally, 7/6/2004 I found a diet that works for me.  I am hitting it fast and furious because it’s rare for me to be able to go through a day not starving constantly…  For me this diet has been a miracle and I hope it stays that way.  I haven’t taken any pills or supplements other than vitamins to stay healthy.  This diet focuses on eating low fat, high protein, and medium carbohydrate.  This diet counts every calorie and watches the values of fat, carbohydrates, and proteins.  The diet requires high motivation and the willingness to eat to live, not live to eat.    This is all new to me at the moment, I feel as if I have come across a miracle that works for me.  It’s too new to know if it will continue to work for me, but by October 6th I will know exactly how well it is working.  October 6th will be the next day I step on the scales.  It is a three month diet trial and I don’t want to risk screwing it up by stepping on the scales and lowering motivation.  My current weight is 252, with this new diet I worry heavily about losing muscle mass quickly.  The diet only has between 1,300-1,700 calories depending on the day.  I am not hungry at all during this time, but I am exercising profusely because I have the energy to do so.  On this diet I have high energy, high self control, and I don’t feel hungry…   I am paying close attention to my body.  If I feel weak I add more carbohydrates, if I feel hungry I add more proteins, and if my body hurts I will change exercises.  If I can remember, my next report on Weight will be October the 6th hopefully with a loss of 15-20 pounds of fat not muscle.  My long term weight goal is about 180-200lb of muscle not fat.  Once I lose the fat, I fully intend to continue dieting and exercising for life to maintain what I want to achieve.

      It was a great Holiday weekend 7-3 through 7-5/2004.  Saturday(7-3) my wife, Joey and I all went to Ballard Park to see fireworks.  Sunday I mowed both my brother-in-laws and my own yard.  Monday, my brother-in-law and I went to Tupelo to see his parents and get some cash so he can graduate.  On Saturday the parking in Ballard Park was a nightmare.  People were inconsiderate at their parking blocking everyone in, in every direction.  It has been raining this summer more than any other since I have moved to Mississippi.  The ground was soaked so before we came to Ballard Park we got a tarp that went below our sheet that we sat on the ground.    So there, my wife, Joey and I all sat; looking around at the sites, watching the sky, and eating PB&J, Pimento and Cheese, and brownies.  Eventually the fireworks went off, and … we were behind a god damn tree.  So quickly we all get up, Joey grabs one end of the tarp, I grab another and we yank it under a bright street lamp.  For the next 20 minutes we sat, tried to watch the fireworks, and had 30-60 bugs crawling on us at any one time.  The bugs ranging from crickets to mosquitoes were some of the most annoying things I have ever seen.   After the show, we packed up our blanket, tarp, and coolers and started towards the car.  Traffic was a nightmare.  People had serious road rage, trying to cut everyone off.  Of course I joined in and was more successful than 90% of the people out there at winning the cut off.  I am normally a calm laid back person, but if their going to be rude, then so am I.  Sunday, I spent the entire day mowing.  The grass was still damp and the mower died often, but in general it was a successful day.  The yard work got done, my wife spent the day resting from Saturday, and I really felt like I had accomplished something.  It was a fantastic day.  Monday, I went to Tupelo with my brother-in-law.  We had a Coffee at Books-A-Million, saw Spider Man 2(good movie), and ate supper at Harvey’s.  Everything went as planned and everyone had a decent time.  My brother-in-law lost his cell phone; we searched everyone under the sun, but in the end…. We never found it.
