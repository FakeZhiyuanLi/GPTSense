						    Making the Most of Startpage Traffic   Although startpage programs may not get you the best quality traffic or provide the best conversion rate, they can be useful if you have a new website and want to get traffic to it quickly.   I'm not talking about programs like Screenblaze - which I HATE - because it requires you to download software that can make your PC crash - at least that's what it almost did to mine!   I'm talking about programs that use a normal web-browser interface and give you credits every time you open a browser window - which you probably do many times a day.   I used them a lot earlier and joined a LOT of them when I was just starting out.   And there are a lot of people using them - so you CAN still get your message across using this simple and FREE source of traffic.    The best way to use startpage programs is NOT to sell something with them, but to use them to GENERATE LEADS.    You can do this by sending your startpage traffic to a page with a subscription form for your free report or ebook or ezine.   That way you can capture the emails of your visitors and follow up with them later with more information about your products or opportunity.   You'll find more information on how these programs work as well as tips on how to set up your startpage here    urlLink  Tips on getting traffic from Startpage exchanges     Here are some great tools to get more traffic to your website using Start Page Programs.   You probably know that if you join 2 or more startpage programs, you can't have 2 home pages set at the same time in your browser. So what are the alternatives?   You could use a java script to set up a rotator type web page, that requires you to have a working knowledge of javascript.   You could use a free tool I used to use called  urlLink Pagetool  - but that requires clicking on the links manually to visit each startpage - a big nuisance - which is why I stopped using it.   You could get a copy of the  urlLink  Snazzy Start Page Traffic Generator   .    So, if you join 20 start page programs and get 100 hits from each program daily then you get over 2000 hits per day.   If you're a bit of a techie and are familiar with setting up scripts, you can check out the  urlLink  Perpetual Traffic Generator   .    It combines two of the most powerful tools in web marketing into one easy system...  - Viral Marketing (You get Full Customization Rights )  - Reprint Rights (Make money by reselling it)

						      Why I HATE Screenblaze   If I get ONE more ad for Screenblaze or whatever the newest "blaze" is, I'm going to scream! :-(  When I visited the website to join the latest one, it just took over my computer like a virus.  I got a BIG, BLANK screen - that I had absolutely no control over and nearly went nuts trying to shut it down.  The first (and last) time I installed Screenblaze, it just went wild, opening up multiple copies that had me scrambling to press CRTL+ALT+DELETE far too many times.  You can bet I reached for the uninstall function pretty quick.  I don't mind click-exchanges or startpage exchanges that use a normal browser interface.  But I don't trust any programs that invade my computer and take it over its controls like an alien force.   Thanks, but no thanks to the traffic "boost." I like to keep control of my own starship.  I have a pretty fast Pentium 4, but I use a lot of applications at once, so its usually mission critical. And I'll admit it could use a dose of diagnostics.  But do these new programs have to SHUT it down completely, or take over the ENTIRE screen..?  I would not endorse any of this new breed of traffic generators for the reasons here:  1. Lots of people have operating systems that simply cannot handle them.  2. I hate installing superfluous software that I don't really need.   I don't use screensavers anyway.  And I'm sorry, but I'll delete every mail that comes in endorsing the latest "Blaze." I DON'T CARE how much traffic I'm missing out on.  And while you're here, you can read the article I wrote about this issue   urlLink  What the "Blazes" - and other Traffic B.S.    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

						        SEO Works Great for Me  If you have read my eBook " urlLink Be a WHIZ at eBIZ ," you'll know that I lay a lot of stress on search engine traffic.  Why is it important to get your site listed on search engines?  Let me tell you my own story.  I promote a network marketing program here   urlLink http://www.1whey2health.com   When I first started promoting my website above, I didn't know the importance of targeted search engine traffic.  Of course I did ALL the things that one is advised to do - create a free eBook and give it away, capture leads on an autoresponder etc.  But after I'd spent months promoting the eBook, getting a LOT of leads, signups and freebie hunters - but very few sales - I realized I had to do something different.  And that was... find paying customers!  You see, like me, you might have a very good product that helps a lot of people improve their health, but what's the point if no one can find it when they're looking for it.  I realised that my website wasn't targeted to those actually looking for my product - my CUSTOMERS!  So I spent months reading up about search engine optimization and applying those principles to my website - with great success (if I may say so myself).  In a few months I took my site from the third or fourth page of Google to a Number 1 ranking.  I also get over 150 free, targeted leads a month without lifting a finger or paying a cent for pay-per-click traffic.  I built (and continue to build) most of my business through free search engine traffic - and I don't spend a CENT on advertising.  If you need SEO resources, you'll find a large number of them (many of which I regularly use myself to optimize the new sites I keep creating) along with my own  urlLink  guidelines on Search Engine Optimization   .   &nbsp;

						      Quick Earnings with Google Adsense       Q: How can I find a quick way to earn revenue from my website?       A: Google's AdSense... A Tailor-Made Way to Monetize Your Site    If you visit my website  urlLink EbizWhiz Publishing  you'll see a banner at the bottom of each page (just above the menu links). It has four links in it that are supplied by Google AdSense.   According to Google, "Google AdSense is for web publishers who want to make more revenue from advertising on their site while maintaining editorial quality.  AdSense delivers text-based Google AdWords ads that are relevant to what your readers see on your pages - and Google pays you."  AdSense ads are just like the AdWords ads you see on the right-hand side of a Google search results page... except they are on YOUR site. For every ad clicked, you receive money (a share of what Google receives from the advertiser).  Here's a fantastic resource to find out how to get your site accepted and get the most out of this "revolutionary" way of earning revenue from your website.     urlLink  Google Adsense Contextual Advertising      Read the article here to ensure your site qualifies for AdSense.   urlLink  How to Qualify for Google Adsense Contextual Advertising      &nbsp;

						    THE TIDE IS HIGH...   ...And I'm riding the wave while it lasts.  Everything is transient on the internet, especially some ways of making money.  Some experts are already predicting the demise of Google's Adsense program,&nbsp; especially once the less scrupulous webmasters start to abuse this method of earning.  But did S.P.A.M kill email marketing? Hardly!  So I doubt that Google's Adsense program is going under anytime soon.  Its effectiveness may decrease over time - and Google may make its requirements for websites joining the program more stringent... all the more reason to get in while the going is still good.  Some webmasters are reporting earning in the thousands. But I can only vouch for what I've made so far.  A few weeks ago I dipped my toes in, with a tiny banner (not even the higher-earning skyscraper ad) at the bottom of my web pages and then promptly forgot about it.  When I checked out my reports a few days ago, I found that I'll be getting my first check soon,and I haven't even capitalised on the full earning power of this program.  So if your website has been less than profitable, and you've been struggling to make those first few bucks...  OR if you have a high-traffic website that could be a potential money-spinner...  All you have to do is apply below and you can literally start making money while you sleep.  And that's no hype!  Of course there are a few things that will help your website get approved, like:  - Your own domain name  - Content-rich pages structured around themes  - No competing ad programs  You can read more about Google's requirements here:   urlLink https://www.google.com/adsense/policies   Don't have a website yet? What are you waiting for?!  Get started building your content-rich website as soon as you can, and here's a great resource to help you get there.   urlLink http://ebizwhiz-publishing.com/adsense.htm   The water's fine, so come on in and ride the Google Adsense wave. :-)

						     What in the Heck is a HoverAd&#8482;?    Whew, things have a way of changing so quickly on the internet.    Its hard to keep up, and easy to get left behind - unless you stay at the cutting edge of internet marketing developments - and that's what I try to provide through  urlLink my newsletter here .    It seems like just a few months ago that pop-ups ruled the roost. Now hardly anybody ever sees them anymore - at least I don't, because I use the Google toolbar.    But the creatures that inhabit the internet are a quickly evolving (or is it mutating?) species - and they tend to find a way to ensure their survival.    By tweaking a bit of code, internet marketers have found a solution to that bane of their existence - popup blockers. The little monsters that are stealing their subs and sales from under their profit-sniffing noses.    Acquiring these solutions could cost anything from zip, to &quot;small-hole-in-pocket&quot;, to &quot;HUGE-hole-in-pocket.&quot; Even the esteemed Corey Rudl has jumped into the fray and sells one on his website for $97.    For my part, I did try some free code that was recommended on a forum, but could never get it to work.    So I opted for the &quot;small-hole-in-pocket&quot; version - the  urlLink HoverAd&#8482; Generator  created by that brilliant coder, Satyajeet Hattangadi (who, him again?).     You can see the little buggers in action on his website.     urlLink  Click here to see a HoverAd&#8482; in action        If you're still trying to figure out what all the fuss over pop-ups and hover-ads is about, this article will explain to you exactly why you should be worried - and what you can do about it.     urlLink  Are Your Pop-ups Invisible To Your Visitors?

						    You asked for the Moon... Now you can Have it   I can't believe what I'm reading nowadays. I just got a couple of mails by people claiming to sell land... on the Moon!  Frauds, I thought- and then clicked through to see what it was all about.  You see, I'd heard of this a while ago in the newspapers, but always thought it would be against the law - like human cloning.  Or at the very least, would (hopefully) be nullified by international treaties.  But this is what their website says.  ------------------------------------  There are over 1,125,000 lunar land owners from 176 countries around the world. To date more than 300 million acres have been issued to people from all walks of life here on planet Earth....  If this sounds like a joke to you, please read on, because this is no joke. The sale of lunar property has been ongoing for 22 years by the Lunar Embassy, which is THE ONLY COMPANY in the world to possess a legal basis and copyright for the sale of lunar, and other extraterrestrial property within the confines of our solar system. Lunar Embassy has authorized PlanetaryInvestments.com to sell Lunar Property exclusively.  The UN Outer Space Treaty of 1967 stipulated that no government could own extraterrestrial property. However, it neglected to mention individuals and corporations. Therefore, under laws dating back from early US settlers, it was possible to stake a claim for land, and register it with the US Government Office of claim registries.  A declaration of ownership was filed with the United Nations as well as the US and Russian governments in 1980 by Mr. Dennis M. Hope of the Lunar Embassy, to ensure that a legal basis for the ownership of the properties sold here can be claimed. At the time of writing, the Lunar Embassy has appeared on TV in over 180 countries worldwide on approximately 80 different TV channels, including CNN International, RTL, NBC and Australia Channel 9 to name just a few.  The biggest support of this claim has been in the form of actual lunar landowners such as two former US presidents, NASA employees and many well-known celebrities.....  The list of people who buy them is endless. Dentists, lawyers, nurses, space hobbyists, trekkers, doctors, taxi drivers, policemen and up to now, about 30 NASA employees. At the last count over 1,137,262 people are already proud owners of their extraterrestrial property, with properties on the Moon being the hot forerunner of course (because these are the only properties you can easily see from Earth).  ...If you would like to be notified when other properties become available in our solar system please click here. You will be notified as soon as they become available.  ------------------------------------  I ask you - is nothing sacred anymore? Does the great Mammon have to govern everything we do?  What's the big deal about a bit of land, you might ask?  Its not the land, but the ideas it represents.  As someone whose personal mantra is John Lennon's "Imagine," I find this sort of avarice disgusting.  Instead of letting our children share the last few regions untouched (until now) by humankind's greed and personal divisions - we're taking our baser instincts to the rest of the universe.  I'm not sure whether to laugh or be saddened. Its like something out of science-fiction. Only its all too real.  But then, who's to say that our children won't do the same? After all they're made in the same mould. Or are they?  When my daughter makes unreasonable demands, I sometimes tease her, "If you ask for the moon, would I be able to give it to you?" And she, showing all the wisdom that only a 4-year old can, laughs and says no.  I'm sad to say that I'll now have to tell her, "If you ask for the moon, I could give it to you - but, sorry baby, I can't afford to."  If you want to check out your own piece of lunar real estate - or give it to a loved one for Christmas ("Hey baby, you know you always ask me for the moon - well, guess what, now you can have it"), you can see what I'm talking about here.  http://www.planetaryinvestments.com/  (NOT an affiliate link)  Actually, from a planetary viewpoint, Mars would be a MUCH sounder investment. ("Oh deah, you live on the Moon? How plebian. Mars is soooo much more exclusive, dahling")  So, if you build your own little moon villa sometime in the future, you might want to invite lil 'ol me - perhaps the only person on Earth (besides 'Ol St. Nick) who won't own a piece of lunar paradise.

						    Marketing 'Gurus' : Do YOU Need One?   Its that time of year when everyone starts looking back and assessing what they did and didn't do, should have and shouldn't have done.  I do have a few reflections, on where I've reached as an internet marketer, and what it means to be where I am.  Like I've learned that the more well-known a name you become, the more "offers" and "joint ventures" you will receive from people you've never heard from before.  And the more you will have to say 'NO' to the "offers" you do not want to be associated with.  Sometimes its hard to know which ones to turn down, and sometimes its just plain hard to say "NO," especially when you've been brought up to be nice to people.  And like I've learned that there are four types of internet marketers out there  - The Doers, who TAKE ACTION, take risks and often make the big bucks. If I had to hitch my wagon to someone's star, it would be one of these guys - just make sure the "guru" you choose has a LONG track record of success (more on that later).  - The Whiners, who always gripe and complain that they just can't seem to get started or that they've been had - by the fourth kind.  - The Happy Campers, like myself - content with what they earn and happy with what they do, keen to learn more and increase their earnings, but not willing to do just about anything to get there.  - The Nasties ( prime example, the specimen showcased at  urlLink http://www.BewareOfJoeKumar.com  ) who seem to get a thrill out of finding out just how far they can go before the long arm of the law catches up with them (and believe me, it will!).  I don't have to tell you what you should do when you meet the latter kind...&nbsp; Run like the wind!  I'm sure you can think of many more sorts, but this is over-simplification time, so I'll just stick with these four.  And speaking of gurus, I've noticed an awful lot of guru-bashing on the forums nowadays.  Personally, as one who has learnt a lot from carefully chosen mentors (gurus, coaches, call them what you will) over the last couple of years, I think that expert guidance in any field of expertise is a good thing.  Without it I'd probably still be out there in the marketing wilderness, searching for a way to make a living online.  In fact it pained me so much to see the things being said by a few unenlightened twits, that I sat down and wrote an article. So here's my latest offering for you to devour.      urlLink Marketing "Gurus": Do You Need One?       &nbsp;

						    Am I a Guru Yet?    I'm back from a great vacation by the beach, refreshed and raring to go.     My daughter and I took the flight while my husband and parents drove down.     Believe me, I can only take so many entreaties of "Are we there, yet?" from a restless four-year old.     We had a great time, but I haven't developed the photos yet, so I'll save the details for the next issue :-)     Of course, I came back to a full mailbox, overflowing with spam... and a few (perhaps 10%) genuine messages - almost 2000 in all.     Now that they're dealt with and deleted, here's a dark secret I never told you about. (Sneaky Ol' Me ;-)     MY DARK SECRET...     I'm a wannabe "Guru"     Just kidding.     But here's my confession.     My friend Ewen Chia just published a brand new eBook and featured ME as one of his interviewees among 18 other "gurus" of resale rights.     I must admit it does feel good sharing space with the likes of Allan Wilson (among others).    Check out the new package " urlLink Resale Rights Secrets " that includes my interview     So have I entered the hallowed walls of "gurudom"? Naaaaah! ;-)     Never considered myself a 'guru.' Never liked like those labels.     I just like being plain ol' me.     But maybe I do have a few tricks to share that others might find useful.     And in " urlLink Resale Rights Secrets " you'll get plenty of them - 19 whole chapters, in fact.        Some of the interviews are really excellent - full of gems that anyone (not just those into resale rights) can learn from.     I learnt a lot reading them myself.     If you want to know more, just read this article by Ewen Chia, the smart guy whose idea it was to compile these interviews.     It sums up a few gems of wisdom gleaned from the package ... some I used myself when creating my own "Genius Guides" packages.     And there are many more brilliant strategies where those came from.     urlLink How To Pull Massive Profits From Resale Rights Instantly

						    Believe In Yourself And Become a Winner   It's been a very trying month for me, with a lot of changes and new regulations forcing me to make drastic changes in my business.    Its not that I haven't had problems before. I have.    But I've never had to make sweeping changes of the sort I'm going to have to make now.    I can't go into it in detail here, but suffice to say that I'm going to have to practically re-invent myself and my business.    So I'm going to have a few very busy months ahead and if I have to publish this newsletter less often, I hope you'll understand.    You see, I'm not afraid of change. Never have been. In fact I thrive on it.    I always find change stimulating and challenging, if a tad stressful.    Its usually an advantage to be that way if you work on the internet, where change is a way of life.    Like the recent changes at Yahoo (as of January 20th, 2004) which has stopped displaying Google's search results and unveiled its own search engine.    It's results are different from Inktomi's and now those who depend a lot on free search engine traffic for their sales and signups (like me) are going to have to learn how to keep ol' Yahoo happy as well as Google and Inktomi.    Here are some useful links that will keep you up to date and show you how to cope with the changes.    urlLink http://www.axandra.com/news/newsletter96.htm      urlLink http://docs.yahoo.com/docs/pr/release1142.html      urlLink http://news.stepforth.com/blog/    Things change online almost everyday, and those who adapt to the changes manage to survive. Those who don't, go under. Its as simple as that.    I believe that change is the best teacher you can ever have - if you respect her and learn to deal with her.    I use &quot;her&quot; because if change was a person, she would probably be a woman( and most men will agree) since we women always seem to be changing our minds about everything. ;-)    But out of change and adversity comes courage and inspiration.    There's always a light at the end of the tunnel. If you can just find your way through it.    In today's article, I've written about the most important thing (IMHO) you need to succeed in life.    It's not opportunity, talent or intelligence.    It's just a belief in yourself.    Being the movie buff that I am, I often find Hollywood a great source of inspiration to put my thoughts into words.    So go now and read my new article...    urlLink Believe In Yourself And Become a Winner

						    You Might Be Addicted To Internet Marketing If...    Do you sometimes feel like you need a good laugh?    I certainly do... especially when things go wrong, scripts that are supposed to work decide to give up the the ghost instead, my computer starts acting weird and flashing me all sorts of messages (not to be confused with flashing at the Super Bowl).     Well, I subscribe to some great humour columns to get my mandatory fix of the giggles and keep myself sane.     Sometimes just the going-ons in the weird world of internet marketing are enough to set me off...     Here are some of my recommendations for your laughter fix.      urlLink Keeping Abreast of The Super Bowl  : A Humour column by Melvin Durai (don't forget to signup for his newsletter)      urlLink A Satirical Look at The World of MLM Scams  (turn up your audio for this one)      urlLink Madeleine Begun Kane's Humour Column  (don't click if you voted Republican)     You've probably tried the next one, but its still not too stale for a laugh.        Type "weapons of mass destruction" into Google and click the "I'm Feeling Lucky" button.     Or just  urlLink go to the site here  (it looks like an error message, but it isn't)     Did you get it? :-)    And here's one of my personal Internet marketing favourites      urlLink Jim Edward's Friday Night Smackdown     Now Larry Dotson has joined the fray with a very funny book called " urlLink You might be addicted to Internet marketing if... " saying's and jokes.   Here's a snippet of what's included in this laugh-fest.     urlLink You Might Be Addicted To Internet Marketing If...          Yes, even geeky and sometimes dour-looking internet marketers (no personal reference to Dotson) are known to have a sense of humour.    So can you relate to all of those?    I certainly can.    Boy, I need a 12-week program real bad!    Unfortunately all I can afford to do is take a chai (tea) break and saunter off for a while to the world of the living.    But not for long...    Addicts never really quit now, do they?

						    Whose afraid of Inktomi?    I've added a new section to the website where you'll be able to read reviews of eBooks and products I have bought and personally endorse (I don't even bother writing about the crappy ones).   urlLink Product Reviews Section   So far there are only a couple of reviews, but I'll be adding more soon.  If you depend a lot on search engine rankings for your traffic (like I do), then you'll be interested to know that Yahoo has just changed its choice of search partners from Google to Inktomi.  Why is this important? Because it challenges Google's domination of the search engine world.  Until a couple of days ago, Yahoo was displaying Google's results to searchers. But now its displaying results from Inktomi (the same search engine that MSN uses), that it purchased a few months (I think) ago.  So now Inktomi has become a big player in the search engine optimization game.  Even though this means I can no longer rely on Google alone for my traffic, in some ways it's a good thing, because it diminishes the monopoly of Google - a name that many webmasters have learned to fear.  But since many webmasters have focused on keeping grumpy ol' man Google happy all this time, their rankings in Yahoo may (or may not) suffer.  It hasn't done any harm to my own rankings, but that's no reason to get complacent.  Wondering how to deal with this new shakeup in the world of search engine optimization?  Then do read this article by Jason Dowdell that will shed some light on this very confusing issue.    urlLink How to Optimize for Inktomi in 2004    Are you seriously interested in learning the basics of search engine optimization - and using it to get completely free, targeted traffic to your site? Isn't everyone? :-)  Well then, here's a resource I personally endorse for its non-technical language and much more, as you'll see in my  urlLink review of Sean Burn's Rankings Revealed .

						    With A Little Help From My Friends...   What I really want to talk about today is &quot;joint ventures&quot; - and how they can give your business that BIG break you've been trying so hard to get.    I'm referring here to the extremely successful and beautifully executed &quot;12 Days of Christmas&quot; promotion that Mark Hendricks concluded a in the holiday season of 2003.    I believe it worked out beautifully for everyone who participated - publishers and subscribers alike.    As many of you know, a bit TOO successfully for me. I was caught completely unprepared for the flood of traffic that came my way and caused my bandwidth to go &quot;bling bling&quot; - and my website to go &quot;blink blink&quot; (now you see it, now you don't).    But I digress...       So as the song goes, it was all possible &quot;with a little help from my friends.&quot; And that's how it is in the big (and often bad) world of internet marketing.    After all, its no point trying to run the marathon alone when you can convert it into a relay and get the same results with much less individual effort.    Of course, the problem with relays is that everyone has to be a team player. Even one bad apple in the bunch can raise a big stink.    Joint Ventures are like that. And considering how some of the biggest joint ventures of last year turned out, I bet the 11th Commandment this year is going to be &quot;Thou Shalt Play Safe and Do Business With Only Those Whom You Trust.&quot;    If you have no idea what I'm referring to, I mean the '30 Days eBook' with contributions from 61 big-name marketers - that sold, with much fan-fare, for $97, and is now selling for as little as $10, thanks to the unscrupulous behaviour of the compiler.    But we live and learn. And I believe that a shakedown in the world of internet marketing was inevitable, given the fact that it has been growing fast enough to attract some of the most unscruplous people in business.    And while we're on the subject of predictions, here are some in a rather long (but well worth reading) article by one of my favourite people, Jim Edwards.    The fact that he was one of the few guys who didn't give Joe Kumar the time of day, only increased my respect for him. (if you don't know who Joe Kumar is, visit http://www.bewareofjoekumar.com )    Add to that the fact that Jim's an honest, generous and down-to-earth guy, and you'll understand why I sing his praises every chance I get. We sure could use a few more people like him around.    So go ahead and read the predictions of Jim, the Internet Prophet, for the exciting, and no doubt eventful, year ahead.     urlLink  The State of the Internet Address - 2003

						     urlLink When Instant Messages Come Bearing Malice . Instant messaging is providing a new opening for junk mail and viruses. By Sandeep Junnarkar. [ urlLink New York Times: Technology ]  This is one reason I strongly advise against using autosurf programs. Hackers sometimes use them to plant malicious code on your computer.   It happened to me. I was trying out autosurf programs with a new strategy and a hacker website planted a trojan on my PC that was recording my keystrokes.  I was lucky I managed to get rid of it before it passed on all my security passwords and information to the hacker.   It was a VERY scary experience, so I advise extreme caution when using these traffic boosting methods. No internet user or marketer should be without all the tools below. Make sure you have them installed on your computer.   All the ones listed here are free, or have free versions, so you have no reason not to use them.    urlLink  Antivirus software    urlLink Firewall    urlLink Spyware guard

						   Want to know mine? Well, it has nothing to do with money or fame, material possessions or anything else normally associated with success...  In fact its slightly cliched, but exactly defines what I believe.  ---------------------------------------------   To laugh often and much,   To win the respect of intelligent people  and the affection of children;   To earn the appreciation of honest critics  and endure the betrayal of false friends;   To appreciate beauty,  to find the best in others;   To leave the world a bit better,  whether by a healthy child, a garden patch,  or a redeemed social condition;   To know that even one life has breathed easier  because you have lived.   This is to have succeeded.    --Ralph Waldo Emerson  ---------------------------------------------  Making money...  Is that all it really is?  Here's a tip..  Find what you love, what you really want to achieve... and follow it with all your heart.  Making money is a reward for your hard work, but its just secondary when you're doing what you really love. ;-)  Will leave you with that thought today.
