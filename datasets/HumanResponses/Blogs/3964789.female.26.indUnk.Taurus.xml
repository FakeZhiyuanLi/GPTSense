      "Any psychiatrist or psychologist whose own life isn't happy and whole enough to be exemplary isn't worth the hide it takes to upholster his couch."  &nbsp;  Hmmm.&nbsp; Well.&nbsp; Indeed.&nbsp; I have to agree with Tom Robbins on that one, but it makes me think twice.&nbsp; 2 years into my phd in social developmental psychology, I am quite sure Mr. Robbins would toss me out of school on grounds of being sub-exemplary if he knew.&nbsp; On the whole, I think I'm doing pretty well in the happy and whole departments.&nbsp; But does Mr. Robbins's maxim apply to specializations (even though he is very anti-specialization)?&nbsp; If so, I should definitely be thrown out of this field.  &nbsp;  I sat down today to rethink our coding system for evaluating twenty-something romantic relationships.&nbsp; My job is to come up with the best way to identify the qualities and strengths of the partnerships in our study.&nbsp; And really, who am  I  to stamp these relationships with my thumbs up, thumbs down,&nbsp; and observational&nbsp;comments? What do  I  know about "optimal"?&nbsp; My life is far from happy or whole in the romance department.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't help but feel that&nbsp;devoting my professional life to studying optimal relationships&nbsp;approaches the ridiculous, at least right now.  &nbsp;  For example, I spent this spring coding people's ability to form and maintain romantic relationships, which basically involves how many dates they've had and whether the people they choose to date promote their positive functioning.&nbsp; HA! Me, single for two years but with a series of ill-fated crushes that definitely did  not  promote my postive functioning.&nbsp; Me, evaluating others on the very thing at which I suck, at least right now.  &nbsp;  Note my double use of "at least right now".&nbsp; Clearly I am optimistic that I will not be relationally challenged my whole life, or even for that much longer.&nbsp; So, perhaps&nbsp;I'm being too hard on myself.&nbsp; Perhaps this is akin to saying only&nbsp;black folks or gay folks or _____ folks should&nbsp;be involved in&nbsp;black, gay, or ______ &nbsp;issues.&nbsp; Perhaps the loveless are actually in the best position to view lovers through an objective lens.&nbsp; Ironic? &nbsp;  I don't know.  &nbsp;  In the meantime,&nbsp;would it be wiser&nbsp;to&nbsp;concentrate on leading an exemplary romantic life, or on making my work less know-it-all?&nbsp; Probably both.&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      i know.  i  know .  it's summer. i'm supposed to revel in the sunshine and warmth and biking weather and free time that accompany summers in minnesota. i'm supposed to tend my garden and marvel at my burgeoning heirloom tomatoes and hope my cilantro doesn't bolt just yet. i'm supposed to line up for cheese curds at countless outdoor festivals, behind pale obese parents and their borderline-abused hyperactive tots. i'm supposed to stretch luxuriantly when i wake up in the morning and decide whether i want to stay in bed reading novels or get up and drink coffee and think how lucky i am not to work 9 to 5. i am supposed to soak up every drop of sun and enjoy every free moment because all too soon the days will shorten and before i know it'll be -30 degrees and a snow emergency and i'll be working 70 hours a week for school. i  know .  but i can't help it. i am not-so-secretly bursting with excitement over the end of summer. no more sick humid days. no more cheese curds. no more lolling around feeling guilty and lazy. bring on the brain fodder, the stacks of reading, the exams, the research. bring on the routine of school, the early classes, the library trips, lab meetings, the annoying administrative crapola. bring on the feeling that i'll never be able to finish everything i have to do.  i want to trade already 80 degree, humid, purposeless tuesday mornings for 37 degree stormy saturday mornings in bed with darwin and coffee. i want to trade cheese curds and salads and overripe melon for curries and stews and soups. apollo for odin. traipsing through mud and puddles in defenseless flip flops for traipsing through crunchy snow in sturdy and valiant boots. overly baggy shorts and schleppy tank tops for jeans and wool sweaters. gasp! scarves and jackets! feeling that my apartment is the coziest and best place to be (rather than the heat trap/den of guilt and laziness it is during the summer). october in duluth. fall colors. the first frost. thanksgiving in oregon. hot chocolate. lake skating. ruddy cheeks. mittens!   sigh.  only 50 days until the autumnal equinox.  until then, have a  urlLink cheese curd .
