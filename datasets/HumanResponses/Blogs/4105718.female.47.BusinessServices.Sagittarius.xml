      I use Yahoo as my instant messenger.  Just as I was signing up for this blog, I got an IM from a stranger who identified himself as a 25 year old male in my hometown of Phoenix.  He asked me how I am, what I was doing and expressed that he was bored.  Then he asked me if I wanted to "hook up" or meet him.  I am a 47 year old female, single and haven't been dating for about the last five years.  I'm big for my tall, settling in all the places that gravity likes to pull.  I do have have a profile that refers to me as a reformed slut.  Perhaps that is the draw.  It is meant as humor, a poke at myself and how I perceived myself at one time.   urlLink http://members.fortunecity.com/fixr1010/reformedslut/   So now I get messages from all over the world.  Three offers of marriage and counting.  All within the space of 60 seconds from the first hello.  We won't talk about the other offers, there may be children reading this.  I'm just trying to figure out why anyone would expect me to be a Dominos woman (with respect to the pizza company).  Who would want a strange woman delivered to their door in thirty minutes or less?  Why do men try to connect with a woman with the speed of their internet connection?  Does this method of finding women actually work?  Does a guy send out a hundred or a thousand messages trolling for someone, anyone to say "OK"?  Is it a control thing?  Do these guys actually show up to meet the one who says yes or is it a joke to waste an hour or two?  If someone who thinks so little of themselves as to place themselves in a position of risk, does that smack of desperation?   I know a guy who met a woman that way.  Talked to her for a short time on-line and agreed to meet.  They ended up getting married and from all I have seen, she was that desperate, he was that controlling.  I think they deserve each other, but it's not healthy.  People meet on-line and end up leaving their spouses, their homes, their lives for "a new chance".  Better dealing themselves into their own happily-ever-after.  Moving across the country to meet the person of their dreams.  Still, does it work?  I don't think there is enough truth in advertising to make the Internet a healthy place to meet the man or woman of our dreams.  Perhaps the anonymity of the computer encourages people to misrepresent themselves.  The visual cues are missing.  Does the person even resemble the image they project on-line?   A friend of mine fell in love over the internet and invited the man to visit.  He said he was going to get his own place, get a job and marry her.  He shows up on the bus with all his worldly possessions and convinces her to let him stay at her place so he can save his money for their new life together.  The short version is that it took two years to get rid of the man, that everything he said was a lie and she is filing for bankruptcy due to the financial hole the relationship placed her.  She had left the man she had been with for twelve years, fought a bitter custody battle for their son, ending up with a joint custody that shuttles the kid across the city twice a week.  I know that the cynics out there would say that she got what she deserved.  My friend was naive and had never experienced a pathological liar.  She defended him for a year, saying that she knew that he was capable of so much, there was so much potential in the guy and that he loved her.  She also had her pride.  Not wanting to admit that she'd made a terrible mistake, she kept waiting for the cream to rise, to be able to say "See, I told you he was a good man".  It is easy to spread a tissue of dreams over a lonely person.  Picking up cues from what people express and spinning visions of happily-ever-after.  Pouring out heart and soul to another lonely person.  Building sand castle dreams and lures of the life we've always wanted and don't have.  Excitement, adventure on a grand scale.  Someone to pin all our hopes and desires, someone that we make in our minds to be "the One", even to ignoring the little signs that all may not be as it seems.  I am sure that there are some success stories and I'd love to hear them.  Once we had a finite number of potential mates, those that lived and worked in the same town, city or neighborhood.  We knew them, had an opportunity to see how they interacted within the community, even the success with which they lived their lives.  Now there are millions of possibilies.  People all over the world wanting a better deal - a better life.  Trading their old lives in for a chance at a new beginning.  Words across the screen, pictures exchanged, long romantic conversations on the phone to potential soul mates.  How do you choose from such a selection, how do you know that the right one has come along, when there are dozens who express the same declarations of undying love and devotion?  Will the Internet make sluts and liars of us all?  Your thoughts?
