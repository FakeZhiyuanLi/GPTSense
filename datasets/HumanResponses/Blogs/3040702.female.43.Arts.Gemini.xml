       This was Daisy's idea - describe your perfect day, as is CURRENTLY POSSIBLE, in order to begin living that way. It's meant to be an exercise in deliberate living. When I wrote my perfect day, I sort of ignored that aspect of it, and wrote what my dream life would be like. It's very diet and fitness oriented, because that's where my head was (and is), but in general it's what I would consider an absolutely ideal day in a perfect universe:  Wake up at a reasonable time, not late and not crack-of-dawn.  Say 7:30.  Put on my bathing suit and walk out to the beach. Gather a few shells, breathe the sea air, have a little stroll, commune with nature. Jump in the water for a few minutes, to really wake up and clear my head. Back to the house, for coffee and a breakfast of fruit and seafood. Get dressed in a halter top and wrap-around skirt. Go to my studio for a few hours of creating masterpieces which sell for good prices to a small group of discriminating patrons. Walk to town and pick up some groceries. Have a giant salad with a glass of wine for a late lunch in a little cafe. Walk home. Read a good book for an hour, then lift weights for 30 minutes. Have a little nap and a shower with my beloved husband. Get dressed in something pretty and slinky, but no shoes. Make cocktails and hors d'oeuvres in my bright, colorful, funky kitchen, as my brilliant literary and artistic friends start dropping by in the early evening. Sit on the verandah drinking and talking, wolfing down canapes and bringing up epigrams. When we get hungry for dinner, whomp up a big batch of fresh seafood and pasta, open some wine, and stay up late talking and laughing and singing and dancing. Go for a midnight swim to clear our heads. Retire to my plush bedroom and write in my secret journal by candlelight. Tell all and name the names, for future publication. Go to bed and sleep deeply with pleasant dreams.

       Naturally, make substitutions as you see fit. More vegetables would be nice!  4 largish zucchinis 2 14.5 oz cans of diced tomatoes (Italian flavored) 1 lb ground turkey 3/4 cup Italian flavored breadcrumbs 1 8 oz. package shredded no-fat mozzerella cheese 1 12 oz. jar red peppers some olive oil  Slice the zucchini longways into flat, 1/4" thick strips. Drizzle some olive oil on the bottom of a 9x12" pan. Arrange a layer of zucchini as you would lasagne noodles.  Mix the ground turkey and breadcrumbs. Spread half the mixture over the zucchini in the pan. Pour one can of tomatoes on top, and half the cheese.  Arrange another layer of zucchini, perpendicular to the bottom layer. Spread the remaining turkey on the zucchini. Add diced red peppers and the other can of tomatoes. Sprinkle the remaining cheese on top, and drizzle with a little more olive oil.   Cook at 325 for one hour (approximate - cook until zucchini is tender but not mushy).   For a single serving (about one-tenth of a 9x12 pan) I figure the nutritional values as:  Calories: 228.	Protein: 18	grams. Carbohydrates: 15 grams.	Fat: 9 grams.	Fiber: 2 grams.

       As always, improvise as you see fit.  Dice a couple stalks of celery and a couple carrots. Heat up some olive oil in a large pot, and sautee them with a sprinkling of cumin and red pepper flakes. I don't know how long - ten minutes maybe, on a low heat.  In the meantime, dice up potatoes and whatever other vegetables you want to add - onion, zucchini, peppers, etc. When the celery and carrots have had enough of a head start, add the other vegetables, and also a splash of wine.   After a few minutes, worry that they are getting burned.  Add a large can of tomato juice and two small cans (14.5 oz) of diced tomatoes (Mexican flavored is good). Stir and throw in more seasonings - tabasco, more cumin, sage, whatever.  Simmer for maybe 20 minutes.  Add a handful of frozen corn. Chop up 2 pounds of catfish into large bites, add to the stew. The fish doesn't take long to cook, so put it in when you're pretty sure the rest of it is done.  Serve with cheese sprinkled on top.

       Marla's Bean Salad  1 can garbanzo beans (15.5 oz) 1 can black beans 1 can blacked-eyed peas 1/2 cup diced onion 1 can chopped green chiles (4.5 oz) 10 green olives, diced 1 tbsp. lemon juice 1 tbsp. balsamic vinegar 1 tbsp. sesame oil  Pour the beans into a collander and rinse. Transfer to large bowl. Add the onion, chiles, and olives. Spritz with a large amount of lemon juice, sprinkle with balsamic vinegar and sesame oil to taste. Stir.  The last three ingredients are definitely "to taste," so I'm using 1 tablespoon as an average to figure out the calories. I probably use more lemon juice and less oil, but you DO need the sesame taste to complete it, so don't leave it out entirely.  Other ingredients I use (it just depends on what's in the pantry): black olives, celery, those  urlLink red peppers  in a jar, garlic, etc.  This makes about 6 cups, and I think a reasonable serving is 3/4 of a cup, eaten as a side dish. So the nutrition counts for one serving are approximately:  calories: 186 protein: 10 (grams) carbohydrate: 29 fat: 1.1 fiber: 8.6

       I’ve put these in two groups, but they’re all worth watching. Where it was convenient to do so, I’ve listed some dates and actors and such, but haven’t invested the time to do it really thoroughly — IMDB does it better than I can. And I’m not writing giant reviews or analyses, just a sentence or two about why I like it. Maybe give you some ideas for the next time you’re trying to pick something out at Blockbuster.    Two Star movies.  Movies that I consider to be nearly perfect. They’re so well acted, or so intense, or so funny, that they shouldn’t be missed. They’re from different genres, and frequently they  define  the genre. These are the kind where people say “WHAT? You haven’t seen such-and-such???”  So run out to the video store right now! I just can’t wait until you’ve seen these!   One Star movies.  They’re very very good, but I can’t quite put them in the same category as the Two Stars. They’re just not  quite  perfect. However, each has something a little special: a great performance, or a fascinating plot, or a particularly good scene.  p.s. Rent the DVD when you can, and always rent the letter-boxed version. And watch the movie without other distractions. I don't care how good a movie is, if you watch it with commercial interruptions and phone calls and people talking, it's just not going to be the same experience.    TWO STAR MOVIES   in no particular order    Young Frankenstein   Directed by Mel Brooks, starring Gene Wilder, Marty Feldman, Madeleine Kahn, Teri Garr, Peter Boyle, Cloris Leachman, Gene Hackman, and others. I will state without reservation that this is the funniest movie ever made. If you haven’t seen it before, I hope that doesn’t set you up for too-high expectations leading to disappointment, but it’s the simple truth. Although it’s typical Brooks-slapstick, with classic vaudeville elements, it’s also a bit more sophisticated than most of his comedies, and the cast works together exceptionally well here. To ensure maximum enjoyment, consider first watching the 1934 “Bride of Frankenstein.”   Blade Runner  1982. Directed by Ridley Scott, starring Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young. The ultimate science fiction movie, with a 1940s detective-story atmosphere. Complex, riveting, beautiful, and terrible. It doesn’t get any better than this. Note: If you rent this movie, it is  imperative  that you get the Director’s Cut version, not the general release version, which was completely  urlLink fubar-ed.    Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark   Directed by Steven Spielberg, starring Harrison Ford. For those of you under 30 or so, you’re probably sick to death of this movie, and I am sincerely sorry for you that you didn’t get to experience it first-hand when it was first released. Spielberg reinvented the action movie, and laid the groundwork for all the (less wonderful) big action flicks that followed. The Adventure/Romantic Comedy film has never been done better, before or since. The opening sequence is brilliant. Great characters, and the perfect blend of humor and suspense.  In common with Young Frankenstein, it's an homage to an earlier style of movie, and that’s fun too. Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade have their good points — I’d give them half a star — but neither has the dimension of the first film.   American Graffiti   Directed by George Lucas, stars Ron Howard and Richard Dreyfus and other people I don't remember.  This is about high school kids on the last day of summer in 1962 or thereabouts.  It's what the word “bittersweet” was invented for.  The music is so important as to practically be another character in the story.  This movie is flawless.  There's no element of it I can criticize or find lacking in any way — not the writing, the acting, the sound, the pacing, the dialogue, the continuity, the lighting, or probably even the cleanliness of the restrooms on the soundstage. It's just perfect. And, again, Harrison Ford.   Notorious   193x. Ingrid Bergman, Cary Grant, Claude Rains. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Ingrid Bergman has to be one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen. Besides that, this is a gripping story about Nazi spies, danger, and romance. The suspense scenes (especially the key ring) are so tense you almost can't bear them. I like most, but not all Hitchcock, and I also recommend Rear Window, Rope, and Lifeboat. Rent the movies - don't watch them with commercials - and let yourself sink into the mood!   Victor/Victoria   Directed by Blake Edwards, starring Julie Andrews, Robert Preston, James Garner.  Romantic comedy about a female impersonator. This movie is FUNNY, warm, and beautifully crafted. The Art Deco furnishings are to die for. The story is great, the singing/dancing numbers are fantastic (and I do not like musicals), the characters are wonderful, from the major players to the tiniest two-minute roles — even Alex Karras is good in this movie, and Leslie Ann Warren is nothing short of brilliant in an important supporting role. I love to watch this movie when I’m feeling blue, because it always makes me feel cozy and happy.   The Maltese Falcon   Directed by John Huston, starring Humphrey Bogart, Mary Astor, Sydney Greenstreet, and Peter Lorre.  I guess this was the Blade Runner of its day — it’s useful to watch with your finger on the rewind button. It’s a suspense/mystery story by Dashiell Hammett, and the plot can be understood on several levels.  You can just accept it at face value and it’s an excellent detective movie, or you can pick apart the plot elements and go crazy trying to figure out who knew what when and who is on whose side. It’s cool.   To Have and Have Not   1944. Directed by Howard Hawks, starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall.  Everyone has a favorite Hemingway story, everyone has a favorite Bogart movie. Mine happen to be the same one. You'll find only a casual relationship between the book and this movie, but the performances and the tension between the two stars are sizzling. This is when Bogie first met Bacall, so you’re seeing Hollywood history occur right before your eyes, as their famous real-life love affair begins. It’s HOT.   What’s Cooking  2000. A large cast, directed by Gurinder Chadha. I find this film even better than her Bend it Like Beckham. It’s about four households of various ethnicities and their Thanksgiving traditions. A lovely study of humanness, love and hate and anger and pain and joy. And the delicious food woven throughout the story. It’s neat.    ONE STAR MOVIES     Fantasia   193x.  This animated movie has been useful to me for my entire life. As a kid, I loved the cartoony parts and the scary parts; as a teenager and young adult it was the ultimate stoner movie, perfect for smoking a joint and watching from the balcony (yes, in those days a few theaters still had balconies); and as a middle-aged crank, I am fascinated by the beauty of the nature sequences. And the funny parts are still funny. I also recommend Bambi and Sleeping Beauty for stunning visuals and brilliant art direction.   The Sixth Sense  Directed by M. Night Shyamalan, starring Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment. I love a good scary movie, but I am so sick of violent slasher movies.  They're gross, they're stupid, they're predictable. The Sixth Sense was the ideal horror movie to me; it relied more on suspense than gore, the story itself was fascinating, and the actors were surprisingly good (I can’t stand Bruce Willis, and that’s probably the only reason I don’t give this a Two-Star rating). And above all, it’s REALLY SCARY.   Snatch  2000, Benicio Del Toro, Jason Statham, Brad Pitt, and others. This is not “my type” of movie, but it’s so damned good. The 21st century version of a caper movie. The violence is a bit much for me, and the music-video-style scenes pull me out of the story abruptly (which also goes under the heading of Things I Will Never Get Because I’m Too Old), but damn it’s good. Fast, funny, clever, sometimes tense. It’s the first movie I ever liked Brad Pitt in, and now I’m a fan.   The Incredible Mr. Limpet; The Ghost and Mr. Chicken; Chitty Chitty Bang Bang   Various dates in the 1960s. Starring Don Knotts, Dick Van Dyke, and other people.  If you haven’t seen any of these movies, you probably think I’m kidding, but I’m not. I LOVE these! Did you know Chitty Chitty Bang Bang was written by Ian Fleming (James Bond)?!   Topsy-Turvey  1999. Directed by Mike Leigh. A British film about Gilbert and Sullivan and the ups and downs during their creation and production of The Mikado. The sound design is awesome, and as in Victor/Victoria, all musical numbers take place as musical numbers on the stage, not the main characters suddenly bursting into synchronized song. Entertaining.   Rabbit-Proof Fence  2002? Directed by Phillip Noyce. I'm going to warn you, this is a sad movie. That’s not giving anything away — it’s the story of three aboriginal girls in Australia in 1931, trying to escape the “school” they’ve been forced to attend and return across country to their families. It’s just haunting, with fantastic performances by the little girls, and also by David Gulpilil, a well-known Australian aborigine actor. It’s going to make you cry, but please see it anyway, and try to get the DVD so you can see the “making of” stuff.   Best in Show  2000-ish. Directed by Christopher Guest, and starring the usual cast. Any one of Guest’s mockumentaries are good, but this is my favorite. All of the characters were touching, in their way, and that’s his talent as a director: you find something human to empathize with in each person, no matter how silly or vain or petty they might be. And isn’t that a good lesson for life? Yes. Yes, it is.   Corrina Corrina  1994. Whoopie Goldberg and Ray Liotta. I might be the only person who’s even seen this movie, but I love it. The early 1950s sets, clothing, and cars are fantastic. It’s a cute story, about a grieving widower and his daughter and the housekeeper they hire after his wife dies, and the relationships they form. You might get a tear in your eye, but mostly it’s very funny. The cinematography is interesting, and all the actors are good. Don Ameche is especially touching as Manny’s father. Also the little boy who plays Percy is a riot. And I like seeing Whoopie in a romantic lead; she carries it off perfectly and I’d like to see her do more roles like that.    Deuce Bigalow, Male Gigolo , 1999. Rob Schneider, Arijus Bareikis. Remember how I said Young Frankenstein is the funniest movie ever made? This one is the second funniest. I know, I know, they’re not hardly in the same category, in any sense the same quality, and yet this movie made me laugh SO hard. And I love that Deuce is kind and well-meaning and has ethics. It’s a sweet story, and WAY better than the other Schneider movies. Eddie Griffin as T.J. Hicks is unbelievably funny. Also, Oded Fehr’s naked ass.   Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid  1969. Paul Newman, Robert Redford. Thirty-five years later, this movie is still the ultimate guy buddy flick. It’s the ultimate Newman-Redford flick. There are moments of political incorrectness I don’t care for (most notably the “rape” scene with Katherine Ross) but even that doesn’t detract from how exciting and funny this movie is. It has some unusual (or distracting, depending on your opinion) techniques, such as the musical montages and the freeze-frame ending, so it’s also an interesting study of filmmaking in the 1960s. One of the classic “anti-hero” films of the 60s, also.    QUICKIES    Liked ‘em, they’re good, you should rent them, but I don’t feel like writing a paragraph.    Frida - compelling.   Bowling for Columbine (because it’s interesting, even tho I can’t stand Michael Moore)   The Quiet American - my favorite Graham Greene novel.   Pollock - Ed Harris rules!   Kiss of the Spider Woman - sad but great.   Blue Crush - exciting, girls rule!   The Exorcist - it’s scary!!   Pirates of the Caribbean - so much fun.   The Guru - funny like Deuce Bigalow.   Bottle Rocket - jeez those guys are nuts.   Sling Blade - Billy Bob.   Pushing Tin - Billy Bob.   Brazil - oh so disturbing   Shakespeare in Love - cute cute cute      Disappointing Movies    What went wrong with these? I dunno; everyone else loved them, but they didn’t do it for me.    There’s Something About Mary   Star Wars. All of them.   The Fellowship of the Ring   Harry Potter   The Last Picture Show   Scream   Chicago   Any Stephen King movie except The Shining.   Titanic

       Compiling this list was harder than I expected. Oh, I could probably reel off a hundred books without much effort, but as soon as I began it became apparent how many of the hundred were by the same authors. I could list my favorites of James Michener, Robert Heinlein, Georgette Heyer, and Graham Greene, and be done with it in four authors. That doesn't seem like a really good representation, so I've trimmed multiple mentions to the minimum, including more than one by an author only when it was very notable to me. In a couple instances, I just couldn't decide between a couple books by the same author, and listed them together with a slash between.  I wanted to limit this to fiction, to novel-length writing, and that also threw me for a loop a few times. I realized I couldn't include Walden or Up From Slavery. Likewise O'Henry, Tillie Olsen, and Truman Capote, whose writings are short stories — at least, of those I've read. I love Tolstoy's short stories, but couldn't make it through War and Peace if you paid me, so he's out. I've allowed it in a few instances (Kipling, Bradbury) when the collection has a common theme or thread that unifies the stories.  The most important discriminator is that these are my  favorite  novels, not necessarily the  best  novels, the highest quality. This is a purely personal list of what I enjoy, and some of them are pretty cheesy. Some books that I like and are patently worthwhile, such as The Good Earth by Pearl S. Buck and The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison, didn't make the cut, simply because I don't like them as much as some other novel that may be less deserving but more to my particular taste.   At first I ordered these in descending order of preference or impact, but found I couldn't really do it that way. It's too often a matter of apples and oranges. However, there are some books that had a truly significant impact on my life, that caused me to think differently, to live differently. Frequently, these are books I read when I was quite young (9 or 10 years old; I had a "college level" reading ability since second grade and read adult books from about 8 years old on), and they had enormous influence on my values and aspirations. I've marked these with an asterisk, and I still think they are wonderful stories, but be warned that a couple of them are very cheesy indeed.  Eventually I decided to order them alphabetically, by title. Not by author, because that grouping is not necessarily relevant. I like the randomness of alpha by title. It would take me forever to link them all to Amazon or whatnot, so if you're interested, you can research them yourself. So here they are, finally:     The Alienist,  Caleb Carr    Angle of Repose,  Wallace Stegner    Appointment in Samarra,  John O'Hara    Armageddon Rag,  George R.R. Martin    At the Earth's Core,  Edgar Rice Burroughs    Babbitt,  Sinclair Lewis    The Big Sleep,  Raymond Chandler    Bluebeard,  Kurt Vonnegut    The Boys from Brazil,  Ira Levin    Breakfast of Champions,  Kurt Vonnegut    Callahan's Crosstime Saloon/Stardance,  Spider Robinson    A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,  Mark Twain    Cannery Row*,  John Steinbeck    Caravans,  James Michener    The Charioteer,  Mary Renault    The Color Purple,  Alice Walker    Conan the Barbarian,  Robert E.

       I want to address an open letter to people who drive dangerously. Let me first define what dangerous driving is: driving too fast for conditions, driving significantly faster than the posted speed limit, weaving in and out of traffic, running red lights or stop signs, making unsignalled lane changes and turns, passing in no-passing zones, tailgating, and throwing your car in reverse and shooting out of your parking space before you bother to look in the rear view mirror.  Here’s the thing, people.  In this life, we don’t all get to do whatever we want, whenever we want. That includes driving. You want to drive 70 miles an hour? Fine. Do it on the highway, not in my neighborhood. You want to drive 90 miles an hour? Fine. Do it on a racetrack, not on the highway.  You want to weave, run lights, and tailgate? Nope, sorry, that’s not allowed anywhere. You’re just going to have to suppress that little impulse.  Let me give an analogy. You like to drive fast? Well, I like to shoot guns. Seriously, I enjoy shooting at targets. So I go to a shooting range, where there are rules about how and when and where I can carry my gun, load it, and fire it.  I have to pass a gun safety test before they’ll allow me to shoot there.  There’s a rangemaster who ensures the rules are followed; for instance, he or she calls and ends a cease fire, in which the shooters can walk out onto the field to retrieve their targets and put up new ones. For obvious reasons, no one is allowed to walk back to where the guns are during this cease fire.  I’ve never seen anyone stupid enough to argue with these rules or try to defy the rangemaster. See, we all understand that we’re handling potentially deadly weapons, and we need to KNOW what the other people are doing. Their behavior has to be predictable to all of us. Because we could KILL someone if we fuck up.   If you can’t see the parallel here with driving, God help you. Actually, God help me, because I have to be on the road with you.  When I go to a shooting range, I have agreed to abide by their rules. And every person at that range has the right to expect everyone else to follow those rules. All of our safety depends on it. When you get in your car, you have made a legally binding, written contract with ME (and the rest of society) that you are going to abide by the rules.  That’s what a driver’s license is. I have the RIGHT to expect you to behave within those constraints, and thus predictably, for my own safety. I have NOT made an exception for you, no matter how “good” a driver you think you are.    When I see someone who flagrantly breaks those rules, I see someone who cannot function in a cooperative society. Someone who cannot understand the concept of restraining impulsive behavior for the greater good.  I don’t know psychological jargon very well, but I think that’s called a sociopath.  When I see someone speeding excessively, passing dangerously, changing lanes like they’re on a slotcar track, I see a child abuser, an arsonist, a serial killer, a rapist.  You can imagine how much respect I have for that person, and how much grief I would feel if I were to see their car wrapped around a tree on the next curve.  Yeah, it’s ugly to think something like that. But you see, that person has already wished the same fate on me; that person has already decided that my safety and indeed my very life are not as important as their momentary excitement or sense of power or whatever childish gratification they’re getting from behaving like an asshole. As far as I’m concerned, the sooner that person is taken off the road, the better, and I don’t much care how it happens.  And there’s one more thing I want to say about people who drive aggressively and rudely: they’re cowards. Because it’s easy to be rude and aggressive when surrounded by the anonymity and perceived armor of a car. I don’t think these people would dare exhibit the same behavior in a different arena, say for instance, the grocery store.  Someone might object, and someone might do something about it.

       This is my account of our 20th anniversary trip to Tahiti. I always keep a diary during our major trips, because writing it down once and then later transcribing it fixes it in my memory so much better. I was also trying to track my food and exercise, at the beginning, but soon gave that up. I don’t know that this will be interesting to anyone else, but help yourselves.   Friday, March 5th.  Left the house at 4:15 a.m. Of course it was hard getting up so early, but I’m so excited I can’t stand it. Found the Park and Ride without too much trouble. The bus was coming just as we closed the trunk, so we sprinted to the stop and hopped on. Then a dull time in the airport waiting for our flight.  Flight 1209 to Cincinnati on time, 6:20 a.m. An aisle seat and a middle seat over the wing. A crazy guy in the seat ahead of us, fighting with the other two men in the row. Looks to be a four hour flight. Gah! I didn’t realize it would be so long. The movie is no good, not sure how I’ll stand the tedium.  A bad landing at Cincinnati. That is, the pilot did a great job, but there was a lot of wind and he was fighting it the whole way. Bucko shook his hand as we were leaving.  4:00 p.m. A hellish time at LAX, trying to find things — no signs! Great design, folks. And a long, long line to get into the terminal. But finally ensconced in our very cozy window seat in Tahiti Air Flight 1. We’re now 13 hours out from leaving the house this morning. Didn’t get a chance to eat at LAX airport like I thought we would — no time. I’m starving!  I brought a can of tuna and some stuff like that, but we haven’t had a second when we could sit down and eat it.  My new purse is disintegrating already. Damn you, Wal-mart.  Had a delicious dinner on the flight. I resisted the salad dressing, the bread and butter, and had only half the chocolate cake they served for dessert. All the announcements are in French, then English, and then only as we got close to Tahiti, in Polynesian.  I don’t understand much of the French at all, not a good omen. Had several glasses of wine, along with the quite good dinner it’s done wonders to revive my spirits. Bucko also is much happier. The flight attendants are dressed in pretty, brightly colored dresses, and they are curvalicious and beautiful.  Two hours 45 minutes to go and I don’t know how I will stand it. My legs are sore and my feet swollen. I can’t wait to stand upright for a while, or to lie down and put my feet up. Along with several other people, I’m standing in the aisle to stretch my legs. I figure it’s 10 p.m. our time, and we’ve been awake since 3 a.m., although it’s late afternoon here and the sun is out. My eyes are burning. Can’t sleep though, I’m too wired. The Pacific is incredible, a vast, vast blue with white clouds of every shape and size.  I never conceived of anything so infinitely large.  Thank god they came along and gave us more water and orange sherbet. For a few minutes there my heart was beating really fast and I felt awful. Probably just fatigue because I’m okay now.  Did I mention that as soon as you’re underway they bring everyone a flower? Apparently it’s a gardenia, and it smells BEAUTIFUL. The cloud cover has mostly broken up beneath us and the clouds are scattered cotton balls, lit with sun that is just starting to become a golden color.  6:39 p.m. Just saw an atoll!!!!!  Unbelievable!!  It’s getting too dark now to see anything; I’d hoped it would be light when we landed.  Landed in Papeete, a little bit scary because the landing strip is not very long. Terribly hot and humid when we disembarked, but the air smells lovely. Salt water and flowers and diesel. You walk across the tarmac into the airport building, then Immigration (show your passport), get your luggage, through Customs (nothing to declare — rien a declarer) and then the rep from Islands in the Sun gives you a lei, which smells beautiful but is also heavy, itchy, and hot around your neck, and sends everyone off into mini vans to the hotels. A young woman drove us, with an older couple going to another hotel. She drove FAST. Couldn’t see much of Papeete because it was dark, but we went along the main drag at the waterfront, which I was much excited to see.  I didn’t realize that the city is so HILLY; it’s only flat for a tiny bit near the water, then straight up into the hills.  Hotel Mandarin is everything I could ask for. On a city street, across from Papeete’s town hall. A small lobby with a handsome Tahitienne at the front desk. She understood my French! I am very self conscious about trying to speak it, but apparently a lot of people speak English anyway. The room is nothing extraordinary, but the balcony looks inland and we have the most wonderful view of Papeete without leaving our chairs. We made pretense of intending to walk down to the waterfront since it was Friday night, the big party night in Tahiti, but Bucko fell asleep while I was showering, and I soon followed. Slept well until about 4 a.m., and then kept checking the clock to see what time it was. Also kept looking out the window to see the lights of the town climbing up the mountainside. I can’t believe we’re here.  Saturday March 6  We were up and dressed at 6 a.m. Took a little walk around the block and found the market. Too early, people were still setting up. But lovely to see the buildings and all the many materials the sidewalks are made of. Saw a rat at the market, walking around as bold as anything. Also saw people sleeping on the sidewalks, just like in the Michener book, both sellers and buyers, waiting for the market to open.  Back to the hotel for breakfast. The woman spoke little English, so I had to stumble along in French. It worked! Up to the room for bug spray because I was already bitten. Then a circuitous walk to the waterfront. Saw the Paul Gaugin cruise ship in port. Bigger than I expected. No private yachts, though. Made our way back to the Market (no map, so we circled around a bit) where I bought three hand-dyed pareus for folks back home. Beautiful. Also we got two very ripe papayas, now in our little mini-bar fridge. In the downstairs, vendors sell fruit and fish and baskets; upstairs are pareus, jewelry, and the like. Also a tattoo place, which we are considering. The Polynesian people are so beautiful — there’s a lot of variety, because there’s much mixing of European and Chinese, but in general they are tall, with lovely skin and thick, wavy hair. Some of the girls are tiny, obviously mixed with Chinese, and they are incredible. The men are likewise gorgeous.  11:30 a.m. Back to the hotel for sunscreen, and for me to rest my feet, which ache abominably. I wore my new sandals, and of course am getting blisters. So I’m sitting here with my feet up, wrapped in cool washcloths (the water doesn’t get actually COLD here), looking at the fabulous view and writing this.   4:45 p.m. After the market, I put on my tennis shoes and we walked EVERYWHERE. Past the city hall, in circles downtown where we found the most amazing furniture store. Massive pieces, some very ornate, some in a Mission style. Then wandered uphill into the residential area. At a small grocery store we bought two sandwiches, two orange juices, and two beers for 930 francs. Sat on a nearby curb in the shade to eat. Were accosted by a young Tahitian who wanted either to sell us dope or buy our beer for a tenth its price. Not sure, he was stoned or something and finally we got up and left. Circled the block and lost him, so we continued on our way. All uphill and hot sun. Breezy now and then, but not enough! The houses are sort of oriental looking, many with garden walls surrounding. Windows and doors open to catch the breeze, and often a piece of fabric hung in the doorway to let the breeze through, instead of a door. Lots of kids walking, on bicycles, and on scooters. Limped back to the hotel around 2 p.m., my feet in great pain. But so glad I walked as far as I did. Unfortunately, I noticed that my shoulders and face burned and it is fairly severe. We napped for a couple hours, much needed. Bucko is still asleep as I write. I could sit and watch the light change on the peaks of Tahiti all day. The light here is beautiful — the air is so clear. Even when the distance is hazy with cloud, some part will be lit brilliantly with direct, pure light.  I have not seen anyone wearing a pareu yet. I suppose that is more common at the beach. The women here wear dresses and skirts, rather formal, only occasionally a young woman in shorts. The dresses are usually bright and form fitting. There has been activity at the city hall all day — some sort of tent pavilion and seating are set up in the garden. I suspect a wedding. I just saw a woman in a long white dress, but hard to tell what’s up from here.  And another thing: there are CHICKENS wandering around the yard right next to our hotel.  It is true, what I have always read, that twilight does not linger in the tropics. Fifteen minutes ago the sun lit the grass in the city hall lawn, like on a late summer afternoon, and now it is nearly dark.   9:30 p.m. Had a couple lovely Hinano on the balcony. A cool evening. Then walked to the waterfront — many food carts to choose from, and many people walking around eating and sight-seeing. We settled on Chez Roger and had Steak Frites avec Sauce Roquefort and Mahi Mahi Riz avec Sauce Poivre. Delicious. Then sat and listened to a band in the gazebo playing traditional music. Many families walking around with their kids, lots of Polynesians, not just tourists. Then on to Mano Rock Cafe, just across the street, for a pitcher of Hinano in the outdoor cafe. They played much current dance music. Also saw a girl in a pareu walk by, at last. The bathrooms were kind of funny — one door to get in, and then the women’s to the left, the men’s to the right, WITHOUT doors. So if you cared to, you could see the men at the urinals. Staggered the couple blocks back to the hotel. We passed a popular club, where the locals go, but decided to pass it up. There wasn’t anyone over 25 years old there, I don’t think we would really fit in.  Sunday, March 7  Woke up at 4:00, as usual. Can’t get back to sleep, it’s too noisy. Sunday morning is the big time for the market, from 5:00 to 7:00. There’s been a steady stream of car traffic, and also many people on foot, outside the hotel. Can’t tell if they are waiting for the market or late party goers returning home. A bit of both, I think. As last night, I have heard loud music from somewhere in the hotel all night.  7:30 a.m. Breakfast in the hotel restaurant again. I’m having cafe avec pain, et les fruits frais. This is coffee with a loaf of bread, about 9 inches long, butter, and a plate of watermelon and papaya. Bucko is having an omelet, bread, and tea. I’m happy my only ill effects from yesterday’s long walk are my sore feet. I’m not stiff or sore anywhere else. Now I am once again watching the clouds and light changing over Papeete. It’s everything I could have hoped for here — beautiful, squalid, full of energy, joyful, relaxed. There are many cars and scooters, which sound just like leaf blowers, and always people strolling the streets. Polynesians, Chinese, Europeans, and every mixture of these, so that there are so many beautiful, varied faces. Children are everywhere, and as often as not it is the father holding them and playing with them, which is very sweet. I see many mixed couples and mixed groups together. I have fallen in love with this place. Late this morning we leave for Huahine, and I don't want to go!  -----  5:00 p.m. How can I even begin to describe this day? Huahine is a revelation. I’ve never been to such a peaceful place. Our flight was uneventful. Bucko and I could not sit together, but it was only 30 minutes. I saw little of Huahine or Tahiti from the air, a great disappointment, but the glimpses were magnificent. Very quickly through the tiny airport, then a five minute van ride to the boat dock. The land reminded me of pictures I’ve seen of Barbados; very lush but not jungley. Through Fare, but couldn’t see much. There’s only two towns, Fare and Maeva. The dock is wonderful, we haven’t seen much water since we’ve been here — in Papeete, the harbor is a "working" port, so the water was pretty but not exceptional. Here the hotel shuttle dock is tiny, like something you’d see in a city park, but the water is incredible. Turquoise, completely clear, with many-colored fish. Also a couple Tahitian dogs that Bucko immediately made friends with. They probably speak French, but it was no handicap.  The Te Tiare hotel boat is quite small, but the drive is nice. You can’t quite see the hotel from the dock, it’s around the other side of the island. About a ten minute ride. When we arrived, a Polynesian guy on the dock blew a conch shell, and a girl came down and gave us leis, then we were led into the most wonderful lobby over the water and open to the air. Like an ultra luxurious Gilligan’s Island. I tried to pick up my suitcase on the boat, and they were horrified and snatched it away from me. It’s hard to get used to being waited on hand and foot. They gave us coconuts to drink, delicious. Then a pretty woman from the reception came over to us and checked us in. She was cute as a button, with many interesting tattoos. We followed the guy to our bungalow (lucky #13) and were awestruck by the grounds and the interior of the hut. A demi bottle of champagne was waiting for us, surrounded by gorgeous tropical flowers. We changed into cooler clothes and had lunch in the open air resort restaurant. Very expensive, and not notable food, but what a beautiful setting. The buildings are round, and on stilts over the water. The roof rises in the center, so the ceiling is very high inside. There are half-walls, about three feet tall, and then the sides are open to the roof. Apparently they don't have an insect problem, because there are no screens or glass or anything.  Then we had a little swim in the clear, warm water. The hotel has a small beach between the lobby/restaurant and the over water bungalows. It's makes kind of a protected little cove or bay. I’ve never been in ocean with no waves before, it’s incredible. You can just walk right out into the water. The only drawback is that there are a lot of rocks and coral, you have to watch where you’re walking. Which you can do, because it’s so clear. Now again we are ensconced on our porch, tired and happy. A Hinano from the minibar now, and room service later. We’re going for all-out luxury today. The grounds are so pretty, all kinds of plants I can’t identify, and many beautiful flowers that smell lovely. I suppose there’s a sort of fake "Disneyland" feeling to it, but I don’t care. You can’t fake that sky or that scent in the air.  Later. Not sure what time it is, I can’t see a clock anywhere. probably around 4 a.m., since that’s when I always wake up. Slept quite well but woke up a little squirrelly. Maybe the food was too salty. I’m standing in the closet writing this and there are tiny tiny ants running around on the counter. I don’t know what they could have found in here to attract them.  Monday, March 8  11 a.m. GLORIOUS morning. We went for a walk early, around 6 a.m., before breakfast or anything. Had the place to ourselves, except for the gardeners and girls picking flowers for the day’s leis. When the resort ran out we walked along the tiny beach. Found a little piece of coral for Marella and a shell for me. I'm keeping my out for something special for Daisy. Also found a dirt road, maybe 10 feet inland. Those ten feet put you in another world, it’s a JUNGLE. Eventually we encountered another resort, or possibly a private residence, so returned. Saw several loose chickens running around, apparently they are wild here. Leftover dinner for breakfast.  Snorkeling is PERFECT. It’s the most wonderful thing I’ve ever done. It’s indescribable, so I won’t even try. Now we will walk to the restaurant to have a drink while waiting for the next boat into town.  Later. Had a drink in the bar while waiting for the launch. Weirdly, martinis are one of the cheaper drinks here. Arrived in Fare about 12:15. This is a TINY town; the whole downtown is one block long, and it runs along the waterfront, of course. It was very very hot, but there are lots of large trees, with many birds in them, for shade. Had a little stroll and bought postcards in one of the two gift shops. Then had lunch from a roulotte, grilled chicken. The girl running the trailer didn’t understand English at all, so I had to limp along in French. It was funny because there was a French group sitting right next to us, and they all stopped their conversation and were very obviously listening to me. What’s the deal with that? I don’t know if I was just amusing as hell, or whether they were waiting politely to see if I got into enough trouble that they would intervene and help me out. And the flies were terrible! It was hard to eat without biting them.  Walked around the block into the residential area. Much like the neighborhood in Papeete, only flatter. Saw many young people in the back of pickup trucks - that seems to be a favorite mode of transportation, carrying around seven or eight kids in the truck. The houses are the same, very simple, with porches and patios. It seems like the living is done outdoors. Came all the way around back to the main drag, and stopped at Pension Guynette, where they have a covered patio. Had LARGE Hinanos, and chatted with the owner and her husband. She’s originally from New Jersey, but has been in the South Pacific for 27 years. He’s Polynesian, probably 20 years younger than she, a good looking guy with a shaved head and many tattoos. We asked her what people do around here for a living, and she said the islands are filling up with retired French civil servants. She said immigration to the islands is very difficult unless you’re rich. Apparently the French franc goes further here than the American dollar does.  On the way back we stopped at the grocery for provisions for dinner and beer. Cost - 3600 francs, but still cheaper than eating at the resort. I considered buying French tampons for Daisy's souvenir, but I was too miserly - they only had big boxes for about twelve American dollars. Sorry Daisy, love you, but not twelve dollars worth. Arrived at the boat dock at just the wrong time — had a 55 minute wait. But there are worse places in the world to spend 55 minutes than on a beautiful Polynesian island, sitting in the shade over the clear water! We saw three of those outrigger canoes, each with 6 rowers. They seemed to be training — one of the canoes had a guy who was acting like a coach. They went back and forth just at the mouth of the harbor. Also several sailboats anchored just outside.  5:00 p.m. We planned on more snorkeling when we got back to Te Tiare, but saw that my back is far too sunburned. Damn! Now we’re relaxing on the deck while the beer gets cold. The fridge isn’t all that frigid. My feet are doing much better.  Tuesday, March 9  4:00 a.m. Awake at 4, as always. Had a nice evening eating and drinking on our dock, then walked to the beach to see the stars. Fantastic. Even with the lights from the resort, they were so bright and so many compared to what we can see at home.  8:30 a.m. Planning on more snorkeling this a.m. I must wear a shirt to guard against more sunburn. Today a maintenance person is sanding the banisters of a nearby bungalow. He’s wearing a head-to-toe white coverall. I understand the filter mask, but not sure why the coverall. It rained hard last night but this morning is beautiful. We’ve been fortunate in the weather, considering it’s the tail-end of the rainy season. My feet are much better but I can still feel the effect of that first day. A little lizard scuttled into our room last night, and this morning I found half a cricket on the floor.   Later. Another day in paradise. Spent the morning snorkeling. The water is so clear and shallow, and no waves at all. You just walk into the water from the beach, watching where you’re stepping because there are lots of rocks and coral bits. It’s not a problem, though, because it’s so clear. Then when you’re deep enough to float, you put on your fins (which is kind of tricky) and then roll over onto your stomach and start floating. We were enraptured with the first few feet; many tiny fish, beautiful colors, but then when we got out to five or six feet, it was a whole new world. The water is bluer, and there’s many more fish. I can’t believe they were here the whole time we were swimming, but of course we couldn’t see them. About 30 yards out, where the restaurant and dock are, there is a sudden drop-off in the bottom, and all of a sudden you’re hanging in a cold blue void. It was breath-taking, beautiful and also frightening. Without anything to focus on, no reference, you’re just suspended in nowhere, in nothing. It must be what space is like. There were tiny little bits of something — I don’t know what, plankton? — rushing by like tiny confetti, so that gives the impression of great speed and is disorienting. There’s no distance and no scale, so they could be molecules or planets passing by. It’s like looking into a snowstorm, when the snowflakes are being driven by wind. I was afraid the whirling would coalesce into a recognizable shape, such as a SHARK, which made me freak out somewhat. I could only stay in that area for a minute.  Had leftovers for lunch, and drinks at the restaurant, and then into Fare for beer and dinner. Stopped again at Pensione Guynette and chatted. Saw two small freighters pull in to the harbor while we were sitting there. They carry passengers too, mostly on the deck. The woman (didn’t get her name) said she had made the trip once to Tahiti on the freighter and booked a cabin. Found out she was expected to share it with four other people, all men!  It was okay because she knew at least two of them, but I think she said she ended up sleeping on deck because it was actually more comfortable than a room with four guys. I can understand that. Had a great dinner at Snack Temarara. Grilled mahi-mahi and coconut tuna. Wish the hotel had that kind of food. Many locals eating there, I didn’t see anyone else who looked like a tourist.

       Wednesday, March 10  9:00 a.m. Ate breakfast in the hotel, a buffet. We ate a lot because we don’t anticipate having lunch what with the travel schedule. Must leave the hotel at 10 a.m. for the 11:50 flight to Bora Bora. Just learned the "B" is pronounced somewhat like  "P". I am sorry to leave Huahine but eager to see Bora Bora. Hoping the hotel will offer better food, and maybe some night life. Much as I love Te Tiare, I have to admit there is NOTHING to do here at night.  4:00 p.m. We left Te Tiare on the 10 a.m. boat. Had a little scare along the way, Bucko couldn’t find his ticket. Happy ending. Had to wait 1.5 hours at the tiny airport; I guess we could have taken the later boat. This time we managed to get two seats together, by being rather aggressive about getting in line. The islands are fantastic from the air. It was a 15 MINUTE flight, quite uneventful except for the beautiful colors. Bora Bora airport is on its own motu (little island). It’s a former US military strip from WWII. I saw (I think) our resort from the air. Found the Hotel Bora Bora Lagoon Resort sign immediately, where a pretty Tahitienne gave me a flower crown and Bucko a lei. They loaded our luggage on a catamaran, and off to the hotel. Maybe 10 minutes. Checked in at the gorgeous lobby. Few of the buildings in Tahiti have permanent walls, and this was open to the gardens on two sides. Again we were given coconuts to drink, and someone came over to check us in.  I don’t know what fancy hotels in the States do, because I’ve never been to one, but I highly recommend this check-in procedure. It makes you feel important! Although I suppose there’s so many people coming in and out of a hotel lobby in the States that they don’t know who’s a checking-in guest and who’s not. At these resorts, you can’t even get there without their boat, so they know who you are.  Then she took us on a little tour — the pub room, gift shop, restaurants, bar, pool, and finally to our Over Water Bungalow (OWB, to those in the know). It’s beautiful. All the walls are paneled in some sort of teak-looking wood, the furniture and bedding are awesome, and of course the view is unbelievable. After a couple minutes to cool down and take pictures before we messed up the room, back to the poolside restaurant for drinks and a snack. I had a Banana Bora — vodka, creme, banana. Actually, I had two. Was surprised when the credit slip had a spot for a tip – we’d been told there is no tipping in Tahiti, and we hadn’t been. God, I hope we weren’t mistaken!  Then some snorkeling outside our OWB. Not as good as Huahine. Too much wake from boats, not enough fish. But still, not bad! There’s a ladder from the deck that goes right down to the water, to a little landing. You can put on your flippers there and hop right in. Bucko pulled up a giant shell, which we intended as a souvenir, but when we got back to the hut discovered it was occupied, so it had to go back. I have one thing to complain about —our hut is only one bungalow away from the working dock and maintenance area. There’s a lot of activity there and many boats coming and going. The place is so empty you’d think they could have put us in a better spot. Who knows, maybe they consider our hut IS one of the prime spots.  6:00 p.m. Sat in the cute semi-outdoor bar for a couple drinks. Two local musicians with guitar and ukulele. The bartender/waitress is very chatty, it’s interesting to meet a local. Also met Sebastien, the Head of Beverages. There are more Europeans working here than at Te Tiare. Ate outside by the water overlooking the lights of Vaitape. The food is much better here, and even more expensive. We found the room has an incense burner! Nice touch.   Thursday March 11  6:30 a.m. Went to sleep pretty early last night. They had turned down the bed, located my robe and laid it across the bed, and put out slippers for us!  Unfortunately Bucko’s were both left feet. Also they put bottles of drinking water on each table and a little card that said "Good Night" in several languages. Something woke me up in the middle of the night, I heard a BIG splash. It must have been the wake from a boat, but it sure was startling. Looked outside and didn’t see anyone or anything in the water. Also noticed we had left the fish-feeder light on all night. Maybe it was a shark attracted to our hut!  Today we will go in to town (Vaitape) to look for provisions. I feel a little weird, as though the floor is moving in the bungalow. I know it isn’t, but it feels strange. Hope I’m not getting seasick.  9 a.m. Giant buffet breakfast at the hotel. It’s impossible to eat right here! The food is so expensive, we’re stuffing ourselves at the buffet so we don’t have to eat lunch. The mini bar fridge is too small for us to stock up, so we’re limited in what we can get at the store. Perhaps just bread, cheese, and fruit. Today in to town and tomorrow the 4x4 jeep tour. As lovely as it is here, I am starting to look forward to home. Especially for healthy, cheap food. We don’t know how lucky we are. I think the expense is causing me a fair amount of distress, and might be what’s making me feel edgy. Must put it out of my mind, because there’s simply nothing to be done about it.  1 p.m. Spent a couple hours in Vaitape. Very very hot and sunny, and much traffic on the circle road. Walked along the main street half a mile or so. Bought a shot glass for my brother (he collects them) and perfume for his wife. Most of the shops were tacky and sold merchandise made in China or USA. But found local pareus for Bucko’s female relatives, and an extra special one for Daisy. Also went to Magasin Chin Lee for bread, cheese, pate, a couple pre-packaged salads, and Hinano. Somewhat cheaper than Fare and more variety; it’s a much bigger town. Had to come back because my stomach is still acting up. More pain than nausea, which makes me think I picked up a virus rather than ate bad food or seasickness. Now I’m resting and drinking a Coca Cola while Bucko feeds the fishies through our coffee table.  Later. Took a little walk around the resort grounds. Didn’t realize how much is still under construction. Probably only a third of it is done. Saw a girl topless at the swimming pool. Well, I’ve never seen that before!  I know people do it, but not around here. Tried to nudge Bucko, but I didn’t want to point and gawk either, so he missed out. They had wonderful Polynesian dancing at the buffet tonight. There was a round sand area with torches between the terrace and the water. About 10 each male and female dancers, dressed in bright orange. Also drums and singing. Gorgeous! Unfortunately I was feeling sick as a dog, dizzy and lightheaded. Still not sure what it is, but I’m sick of it. The buffet was nice, more vegetables than we’ve seen yet.   Friday, March 12  Up early for the 4x4 jeep tour. Holy cow! That’s worth the money! (I think it was $70 a person). Joseph, our driver/guide, is a huge Polynesian guy who has lived in France, Michigan, and Miami. He’s very conversant with American culture. He said he used to work in the black pearl industry, which is Bora Bora’s main industry besides tourism, but it was too dull, so a friend of his took him on as a tour guide, and he loves it. He sure seemed to be having a good time. He picked up another couple at another hotel, young honeymooners from Boston. We sat in the back of the jeep, where there wooden benches on either side. And handrails, fortunately. He took us up a "road" built by the US military in 1942 (I think) and apparently not repaired ever since. VERY bumpy ride, and my back and stomach are aching. It felt as though all my internal organs were moving around, and I think they really were. We stopped at a WWII gun emplacement, with the guns still in place, but filled with cement so they can’t be fired. Joseph knew many facts and statistics about the island, past and present. He was very complimentary about Americans and all they had brought to the island (besides 175 "illegitimate" babies during the war). I know he was in the position of being paid by us, but I think he was sincere; we didn’t see any anti-American sentiment the whole time we were there, even from the French. On the way up to the guns, Joseph stopped and picked mangoes and papaya so we could have a little "picnic" at the top. Then back down and through a residential area, so we could see what it looked like. For some awful reason we didn’t take a picture there, because it was so lovely. The gardens are awesome. He picked a couple flowers for me and the other girl to put behind our ears.  Then around the island, and a stop at Bloody Mary’s, which is a rather famous restaurant where many famous people have eaten. Whatever. The interesting parts are that the floor is sand, of course there are no real walls, and the bathroom is outdoors. It’s screened from view, but it’s an outdoor room, and the washbasin is a little rock waterfall. You have to pull on a cord, and the water comes down a bamboo pipe and splashes through the rock into a little basin. Another Gilligan’s Island detail I want in my own house.  Done with the tour around noon, so we had cheeseburgers at Snack Bora Burger. 800 francs each! That was the most expensive item, though, and still only a third the cost of eating at the hotel. Visited a little gift shop nearby to get a T-shirt for Bucko. The owner was a French guy, very nice. He talked about the "Operation Sterilization" which was going on at the time — a bunch of American veterinarians were there sterilizing all the dogs for free. He said there are 6000 people on Bora Bora and 4000 dogs, so it’s a problem. We were again struck by how complimentary he was about Americans; I don’t think he was sucking up because he already had our money and he initiated the conversation, it’s not like we were grilling him on his opinions.  It’s such an interesting point to me, because in recent years, our own media is constantly telling us how hateful we are and how much other countries hate us. The news always shows people burning our flags, and commentators and comedians alike are always making remarks and jokes about how bad, crass, loud, stupid, insensitive, or otherwise unpopular Americans are. So I was practically expecting to be pelted with garbage.   9:00 p.m. Went to the hotel Joseph recommended, Fare Manuia. Finally I had poisson cru (raw fish), and it was delicious. The restaurant is small (about eight tables) and no walls. Good food, not cheap but reasonable for here. Our waitress didn’t speak English as well as we thought, because we had a little misunderstanding about taking our leftovers home with us. A tragedy, because we’d only eaten half, if that much. Had a crazy cab driver, arranged by the hotel for us. He was having some kind of big-ass fight on the cell phone, apparently with his cab company. I could only understand a little bit, but I got the fragments of "I already AM on a job" and "You tell him I am already there!"    When we got back to the dock, the hotel boat was broken, and we had to wait for them to arrange another. As with all the towns so far, the waterfront at night is filled with kids goofing around and riding bikes. The boat arrived in about 20 or 30 minutes. It was tiny, but very fast.  Saturday, March 13  Had breakfast at the hotel. The buffet was in the little open air restaurant by the pool, not sure why they changed the location. Nice but not enough breeze. Today we may spend by the pool drinking and relaxing. Although I didn’t sleep well last night, I am feeling considerably improved today.  Yep, spent the day swimming in the pool and snorkeling on the other side of the boat dock. Found a nice spot with lots of fish, but had to fight the current a lot. It’s been very windy and the water is rough. Then a nap and a few drinks at the bar. Another conversation with the talkative Paloma. Her boyfriend is half German, if I understood her correctly. She has three children, the oldest 17. Then on to the seafood buffet. I ate an enormous amount, even more than Bucko, which is setting a record. Three grilled lobster halves, 15 skewered shrimp, a plate of sushi, and a bunch of stuff I can’t even remember. A large group came in last night, I think from Spain. There were only two other couples besides us (and the group). Apparently in April they get busy again.  Watched a little TV, for some reason. The hotel was playing "An American in Paris" nonstop. Also we saw TJ Hooker in French (zut alors!) and a very creepy Japanese horror movie dubbed in French.  Saturday, March 13  Very windy last night, neither of us slept well. But enjoyed sitting nude on the deck in the dark!  This morning breakfast at the hotel, and we have been lying around napping ever since. In an hour or so we’ll go have a beer at the bar, and then we check out at 5:30 and onto the boat at 6:00. It’s hard to figure with the time changes, but I think we have 24 hours of travelling ahead of us. I’m dreading that but looking forward to being home. I miss Daisy!  One thing I am not sad to leave is the constant attention. I guess some people love that, but it’s driving me crazy to have all this chair holding and napkin fluffing. Maybe it’s more noticeable because the hotel is so empty, they don’t have anything to do except wait on us.   6:30 p.m. Sitting in Bora Bora airport waiting for the 7:05 to Papeete. How to handle the tedium? It was bad enough when we had something exciting at the end. Damn, I want to be home. (much whining for the rest of this diary).  8:00 p.m. Made it to Papeete with an uneventful 40 minute flight. Not much to look at since it was dark. I’ve only landed in PPT in the dark, and it’s kind of scary. It doesn’t look like the runway is long enough. The landing seemed a bit steep, but who can really tell. Three more flights to go — PPT to LAX, LAX to Atlanta, Atlanta to home. Now we are in the restaurant (cafeteria, really) in Faaa airport (Papeete) because we can’t check in to our flight until 9:15. Plus we need the break and something to eat. Hope to sleep on the next flight, it’s 8 hours long.  11:30 p.m. I’ve been really uncomfortable on this flight. The tail-end of my stomach disorder, if you get my drift, plus my legs and butt ACHE from the sitting and I can’t sleep because I am also itchy all over.   Sunday March 14  Morning. Eventually I must have had 2 or 3 hours sleep because I don’t remember them. The landing at LA was kind of scary. Bumpy as hell and the smog was unbelievable. Had a horrific time waiting through the lines, a four-hour wait for our connecting flight to Atlanta. However, I saw Ed Begley Jr. in the airport, just walking along like a regular person. Sort of, because he immediately went to the extra-special first-class check in.  Middle and aisle seats to Atlanta. A 3.5 hour flight, so I watched that movie with Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson. Pretty mediocre but enough to distract me. Then an hour and a half wait at Atlanta — our next flight was running late. They have talking trash cans in the Atlanta airport. Yep. By this time it’s night, but I don’t remember what time exactly. We had bad weather and a rough flight on the last leg. No beverage service because of the bumps. I’m exhausted, thirsty, hungry, and filthy!  Midnight-ish. Ah, we’re home. I’m so happy. So so happy.

         I’m just another person trying to lose weight. The statistics? I’m female, 43 years old, 5’3”, married.   I started this weight loss attempt in December 2003. My starting weight was about 260 pounds, starting size a 26. My goal weight is 135-150, maybe a size 12.  I’ve tried to lose weight several times in the past, and can say with honesty that I’ve never lost a single pound before. This time it’s working, albeit slowly. I mostly credit the fact that I’ve been working at home instead of at the office for the past four months or so. Stress can make you gain or retain weight by messing with your hormones, and I guess I’m the poster child for that particular situation.  The blog is called "Someday is Now" because all my life I've thought that SOMEDAY I would lose weight. It's like a super Cinderella make-over fantasy. Someday this would just happen of its own accord and my whole life would magically change into something wonderful. I set all sorts of deadlines for myself: I MUST lose weight before high school starts or my life will be ruined. I MUST lose weight before prom. Before college. Before my wedding. Before the job interview. Obviously, I never did lose the weight, nor was my life ruined.  Now I've come to the realization (better late than never) than someday is NOW.  I'm 43 years old, and I'm tired of waiting for a dream to come true. It's up to me to make this happen.  That holds true for other parts of my life also, not just weight loss.  I'm an introverted, too-cynical person, so it's been difficult and very significant for me to adopt a positive attitude about anything. So I can say this has been a life-changing experience so far.  I’m writing a weight-loss blog because I have been helped so much by reading what others have published on the web.  Frankly, I can’t imagine that I could add anything that is smarter, funnier, more interesting, or in any way better than what others have written. But because they’ve shared their thoughts with me (and the rest of the world), it seems only fair that I should do the same. Tit for tat, so to speak.   What I’m Doing     I’m using a plan of my own devising, wherein I try to reach a target amount of calories daily (between 1300 and 1800 per day), and exercise for a minimum of 60 minutes daily (weekdays). I don't support the low-carb diets, but I do avoid carbs in the form of flour and sugar. I eat a lot of vegetables and fruit, and drink a lot of water. I have cut my portions back by about a third from my normal eating. My main exercise is on a Gazelle glider, as seen in the infomercials. I chose it because there is no impact to my knees and little to my feet. I have had difficulty with other exercise, even walking, because it hurts my knees, feet, and lower back. So I love the glider. I also use a cheap version of the TotalGym called the Sensible Gym, which I also love.  And I have some workout tapes, from Richard Simmons to Bellydance. I tape some shows on Fit TV. A little of everything.  I don’t weigh myself.  I learned the hard way that if I have a scale in the house, I obsess about every ounce, and check it three or four times a day. This time around, no scale. I’m taking my measurements once a week, and also using various pieces of clothing as indicators, such as the Measurement Pants. When I started this routine (December 30, 2003), these pants were five inches away from buttoning. Today (July 2004) I wear them comfortably. They’re a size 22.  So now I’m on to using the Measurement Shorts as my main gauge (a size 20).  I’ve kept a detailed (offline) journal since the first day.  My thoughts, rantings, complainings, about weight loss and unrelated subjects. I detail every single thing I eat and drink (calories plus grams of protein, carbs, fat, and fiber), and amount of exercise and approximate calories burned. I also include my theoretical amount of weight lost, going just by the numbers. Yes, someday I will weigh myself.   Now I'm putting the "thoughts" part of my journal online. Most of it is very dull stuff, just a chronicle of my day, which is why I say you probably won’t find any gems here as on the other web pages. I’m not a gifted writer, but keeping a journal has been absolutely vital to my weight-loss efforts.   My philosophy about weight loss is this: I want to lose weight because several aspects of being fat suck. Maybe if I was a different person, I would somehow be able to overcome or ignore or conquer those things, but I'm not. I don't want to be fat, I don't like it. I've been fat my whole life and now I want to try something different. However: being fat is not evil. It's not BAD. It's not a punishment. It's just a thing that happens to some people. I refuse to hate myself for being fat. I am not a failure, I am not weak, I am not in any way a lesser person than I would be thin.    What's with the "Marla was" headlines?   Somehow I became fascinated with this little Google game. You enter your name as the search term, along with the verb of your choice. Put it in quotes so Google doesn't ignore the verb. For example: "Marla was" or "Marla thinks". Some of the results are very amusing, especially since "Marla" is featured prominently in porn sites.  Anyway, it's more fun than trying to come up with relevant entry headlines, which were always things like "More dieting and exercise."  Got something to say?

       Wednesday, Day Three.  And also New Year's Eve.  8:33 a.m. So far so good.  Just finished soup and coffee breakfast.  Tried the Lowe's brand chicken rice soup, and it was awful.  All water, no chicken, soggy white rice. Bah.  Threw it away and went back to the Campbell's.  I have a rotten headache this morning, which started last night.  I think it might be the seltzer water.  I'm going to avoid it today, and see how my head is tonight. If no headache, then I'll drink it again tomorrow and see if headache reappears.  Decided to track my calories for past two days, to see where I stand. I'm estimating large, so my real intake might be as much as 10-15% less than these totals.  Well, the first thing I see here is that I'm doing quite well. Secondly, the caloric cost of alcohol is too high.  It's half as much as the food I ate during the entire day. Third, the alcohol is increasing my carbs with the wrong kind, namely sugar, instead of fiber.  Need to eat more vegetables. Now look at Tuesday.  I ate only 1108 calories, and I've accounted for every single thing I ate, estimating on the high side.  That's pretty damn good!  In fact, it might be a little bit low.  If I hadn't had the drinks, I should probably be adding a little to it. How cool is that?  Monday is also fantastic, and that's with the Quiznos sandwich, which is loaded with fat and cals.  So far I haven't felt hungry except first thing in the morning, which is normal.  Yay!  11:06 a.m.  Just finished with hour-long workout and a shower.  Not my best workout, but again, I managed to keep moving for an hour.  However, I'm starving!  Probably an effect of all the carbs last night.  I'm having a glass of tomato juice, and if that doesn't do the trick, will have some grapes or cherry tomatoes to tide me over.  I'd like to have lunch at 12:30 or even 1:00, because I got up late, and hence had breakfast a little late.  Still with the headache. Hope it's not the beginning of flu.  Not sure what I'm going to do today. I've done all the wallpaper removal I can do without help.  Maybe this time I really will pack some stuff.  Hee hee how many days in a row am I going to say that?  1:28 p.m.  Had a HUGE lunch of chicken, green beans, and sweet potato.  However, it was only 549 calories.  Probably less, as I don't think I had quite as big portions as I did for dinner last night.  But definitely I am much hungrier today than Monday and Tuesday.  I do think it's from the alcohol, though, and not just hunger catching up with me.  Also, I haven't been drinking the seltzer water today, and that stuff was so filling.  I really hope it's not what gave me the headache!  Which is just now starting to abate.  Had two aspirin before bed last night, and two more around 4 a.m., and they didn't put a dent in it. Two more after breakfast today, and now it's down to tolerable.  Now that I'm tracking calories, I'd better figure out what is the right amount for me to eat. Here is what thebeehive.org calculator said:  "As a 42-year old, 5 foot, 3 inch female, weighing 260 pounds, you need 2,102 calories every day to maintain your weight at your level of activity. In order to lose 1 pound a week, you should consume about 1,602 calories a day."  Since the difference between maintaining weight and losing a pound is 500 calories, I can then figure that to lose TWO pounds a week, I should eat 1102 calories a day. And I am way over that!  But, when I upped my moderate activity from 40 to 60 minutes a day, it gave me 2136 and 1636 calories (1136 for 2 pounds).  And if I split my hour with 30 minutes moderate activity and 30 minutes heavy, I get 2256/1756 (1256).  So I can indeed offset amount of food with exercise, though not significantly.  Now, the West Virginia Dietetic Association says that with those same specs, and "light activity" level (which they don't describe as fully as beehive did), I can maintain at 2,423 calories, which is 321 more than Beehive says, and at Moderately Active, 2746, which is 610 more than Beehive.  And this of course is why I say I don't overeat: I rarely eat 2746 calories a day, and yet I continue to GAIN weight, not to maintain. Whatever.  DIYGlobalSolutions tells me 2101. The Calorie Control Council says 2796.  So let's just use the average of all those figures. To lose one pound a week, I should eat 1802 calories a day (12,614 a week); for two pounds, 1303 calories a day (9,121 a week). This is at a moderate activity level.  I think I can handle that, as long as I am careful with the drinking.  My first goal will be to lose 10% of my bodyweight. That's the Weight Watchers plan. I think I weigh 260 right now, so I want to lose 26 pounds, and thus weight 234.  If I can lose two pounds a week, that would take me 13 weeks, or roughly three months.  What a depressing thought!  Three months to lose 26 pounds.  Well.  That's what will keep me motivated to do the diet and the exercise. Especially the exercise.  Overall, it's so much less painful than dieting.  I'm putting Dr. Phil's WLC stuff in another file, and will follow along with the Seven Keys and the homework.  I'm feeling just like quitting smoking now, where I've got to stop rationalizing and excusing, and do whatever it takes to make it work, even if I feel it's foolish or undignified.  Which describes Dr. Phil quite well. But, you have to accept help wherever you can find it.  Unfortunately, I can't find Key 4 on the website.  Perhaps a ploy to get us to buy his book?  6:29 p.m.  Nope, didn't pack anything.

       Tuesday, Day Two.  7:29 a.m. Just finished my half can of soup for breakfast.  Man, I woke up hungry!  I'm going to drink another quart of seltzer water today, I imagine.  I also woke up with a wretched headache, which I hope isn't the seltzer water.  Although, I lifted weights and stripped wallpaper yesterday, and I can feel it in my shoulders and neck. So hopefully the headache is muscular.  Ate well last night - four chicken wings, heap of broccoli with no-fat yogurt sauce, some frozen corn with no butter. Also managed to resist dessert - Bucko had the last of the pound cake and ice cream from Christmas, and there was definitely enough for two.  That's fantastic for me.  I had an apple, which was delicious, hence the name.  Also had just the one glass of wine. So it all went quite well.  I wonder, will today be easier or harder?  Yesterday it helped to write in here every couple hours, so probably I'll be doing the same thing today.  I know I will - I'm already writing nonsense just for the sake of writing.  Not sure what else I'm doing today. Haven't heard a word from work, so I guess I'm not going to the office.  I have a few hours, like 20-30, around the end of January, beginning of February, on that one project, but that's all I know about.  I'm assuming they'll close down the office after New Year's.  LATER. 10:09 a.m. Just finished an HOUR of exercise.  Pretty much the marching-in-place thing. I'm sure that sounds lame to someone who is fit, but for me it's a big deal.  And oh it was so boring.  Nothing good on TV, and I don't have any movies to watch.  Maybe I'd better start taping something every day. The Daily Show would be good, because I rarely stay up late enough to watch it. That's only half an hour though, so I need something else too.   Now I'm drinking my tomato juice and having three little celery sticks. They're about as many calories as water, so I'm not concerned with how many I eat, but I don't really have any desire to eat a lot of celery anyway.  I'm going to strip some more wallpaper, wait for the hvac guy to show up, and I don't know what else.  Maybe pack some stuff.  Probably I should paint some more sample boards.  I just need to keep busy.  LATER.  11:36 a.m.  Stripped another two panels of wallpaper.  There's probably only one or two more I can do without help.  I don't think I can reach the ones in the shower, and the mirror will have to be moved.  It might not have paper all the way behind it, but it at least goes in a few inches from the edge.  Just started to get hungry, so I came downstairs for a glass of Orange flavored seltzer water, and saw that it's almost lunchtime. Yay.  Not so much yay for lunch, as yay for not eating anything or even thinking about eating.  I know it's weird to be congratulating myself for a mere hour-and-a-half without eating, but whenever I try to diet, I immediately become obsessed with food.  I try to find a lot of no-cal food so I can eat constantly. Which doesn't work, because I'm still thinking about food and eating it, which doesn't break the habit or pattern or whatever it is.  Although - I'm not going to natter on about my disordered eating patterns, because I don't have any.  Yeah, fine, I'm going to eat less in order to lose weight, and to do that I will have to pull some head games on myself, but the point is that the dieting itself is the disordered eating pattern. So of course it's difficult to make myself behave that way.  This is not about wiping out bad patterns and learning to eat normally.  This is about wiping out normal patterns and learning to eat badly.  Maybe that's why there is such a psychology and industry involved in weight loss.  You have to force yourself to behave abnormally to lose weight, but somehow fool yourself that it's what normal people do.  It isn't.  Normal people eat whatever they want and watch TV all day.  When they start gaining a few pounds around the holidays, they cut down on the desserts and snacking for a few months and lose some weight.  There's only two extremes of the spectrum who eat healthy food and exercise daily: athletes and fat people.  LATER.  12:46 p.m. Damn. The hvac guy came just as I was sitting down to lunch.  I ended up eating in little snatches between dealing with him.  NOT a satisfying meal.  I would have been better off to wait until he was gone and enjoy a real sit-at-the-table meal.  Ah well.  Drinking my seltzer water, and then perhaps I'll have cherry tomatoes later for my afternoon snack.  Right now I'm going to paint some more sample boards, and then perhaps more wallpaper.  2:12 p.m.  Had enough wallpaper stripping for one day.  Also painted a few samples.  As I was coming downstairs I had this little craving to eat — not because I'm hungry, but just starting to get bored without a plan for what to do next.  Will hold out until 3:30, then have cherry tomatoes.  5:19 p.m.  All going well.  Had cherry tomatoes and grapes for a snack.  I don't know how many, I didn't count them.  Maybe 12 tomatoes and 14 grapes. Excellent (Mr. Burns impression).  Cooking dinner now — baked chicken legs, baked sweet potato, and sauteed green beans. Very light on the oil with the green beans — maybe a teaspoon in the whole pan.  It occurs to me that this isn't too difficult when I have good food in the house and the time/desire to prepare it.  When it will be hard is being faced with fast food or grazing on whatever crap is easy to eat.  The smart thing to do on days like that would be to have soup for dinner, or a tuna sandwich, but I think it will be too frustrating — food is such a reward, I won't be happy with a crappy dinner.  Perhaps I'd better make something yummy that I can keep in the freezer for just such an event.  I can see it is very important to make your lifestyle support the diet.  You have to plan and carry out the plan.  Like making sure to shop, preparing the good food, planning ahead for emergencies, avoiding the dangerous situations.  For me, one bad situation is boredom.  I have to find some other kinds of sensory input to take the place of food.  This is funny how I'm writing in here every couple hours.  I'm all for it, if it helps me get through, but it's funny how reporting in makes me feel better.  It makes me feel like someone else cares, even though that someone is really me. Also, I'm starting to be impressed with myself, and have some pride invested in being able to do this, so I enjoy writing about it.  Yeah, I know I'm only half through the second day, but it's a big deal.  It's like being half through the second day of quitting smoking — I had never gone that long without a cigarette since I started!  So far my feeling has been mostly "well, this is going pretty well" tinged with a little bit of "when is the hammer going to fall?"  I really want to be able to do this for a week, and I so do not want to "cheat" and rationalize it to myself.  I want to really be able to do this.  So I have to totally buy into it.  I can't have a little part of my brain saying "you don't really want to do this" or "you can't do it so quit now."  It's frightening how divided my own brain can be, and how many conflicting attitudes and opinions I hold concurrently.  One level will be doing X while another level will try to undermine X.  And probably several more levels doing incompatible things.  It's so much like quitting smoking. I'm not sure when I REALLY committed to doing it — certainly not at the beginning. Sure, one part of me wanted to quit, but another part didn't, in a big way.  For a lot of the time, I felt like I was just going through the motions, and waiting for this little charade to end so I could smoke again. Me and the ciggies, together at last.  Hey, maybe that's why this time I will be able to lose weight.  Maybe this is finally the "right" time.  With the smoking, I had to try several times, and somehow finally all the right things came together at once.  It's not that the last time was so different from the other times, just that I had all the tools together at one time.  So maybe this will be like that.  That would be so nice.  One of the things I really hate about trying to lose weight and not making it, is that I'm in a constant state of failure. Which is not good for the morale.  That's one of the reasons I quit trying — it's better to be fat than to be suffering and struggling and failing like that.  I can put up with a LOT of suffering, but not when it's so pointless and I have the complete power to end it instantly.

       OK, so here is Monday, Day 1 of embracing the idea that maybe I'm eating too much. Oh, how I hate that idea, but blah blah blah, get over it.  Well, no, first I want to justify myself one more time, and then I'll settle down to the suffering quietly (yeah, right). So here's the thing - I don't eat any more than normal-weight people I've observed.  I eat a very normal, middle-of-the-road amount of food.  With women it's very hard to tell what they're really eating. There's those bird-like little things that have one piece of toast for breakfast and an apple and a string cheese for lunch.  Are they going home and slurping down a large pizza all by themselves to compensate, or do they continue the pattern and have half a tuna salad sandwich for dinner?  Then there's the women who eat a whole whopper, large fries and a coke, plus something from the snack machine for dessert.  Do they go home and eat the pizza, or do they spend the evening vomiting up lunch?  Anyway, I guess I've reached the conclusion that it just doesn't matter.  Maybe I don't overeat, maybe I do have a good diet, but even so it isn't helping me to lose weight.  At this point in time, there's no other way to lose weight than to eat less and exercise more.  There's just no other viable method.  So my plan is to reduce my food without starving.  Don't want to slow down the metabolism!  Here's what I'm planning:  Breakfast   Half a can of soup.   Coffee.   Juice. If I feel like it.  Morning snack   Piece of fruit or green salad.  Lunch   Probably leftovers, in small portions, to include protein and vegetables.   If not leftovers, then veggie or tuna sandwich.  Afternoon snack   The rest of the soup.  Dinner   Normal food, in small portions, with emphasis on vegetables.  Massive craving for sweets/midnight snack   Gotta look for some sort of low-fat, low-cal, low-sugar dessert    that is delicious and satisfying. Yeah, that'll be easy to find.  I ordered the Gazelle glider yesterday.  They don't sell it in stores, but you can order from Wal-Mart online for $100 less than the infomercial.  They said delivery between January 7 and 14.  I realize I've been putting off exercise, thinking "I'll make up for it when I get the glider."  Bad thinking, obviously.  So today I need to put in some good time.  Maybe I'll watch the Royal Tannenbaums while I step.  You know, I really love some of the weight-loss web pages. I mean, Poundy, wow that girl is a good writer, no matter what she's writing about. Put Down the Donut, also good. Lose the Buddha, etc.  And I get really inspired by these sites, and I want to do one of my own, or at least keep a journal even if it's not online.  And then I think, What could I possibly write that those people haven't already covered, in a much better/funnier/more literate way?  I get all my ideas from them; I'm not the originator of ideas. But the thing that really discourages me is that I never have any progress to write about.  Then the whole journal thing becomes pointless — I'm trying to write about a subject that doesn't exist, and it's nothing but negative entries: "nothing happened."  So one thing I'm going to do, to keep my psyche up, so to speak, is to take this a week at a time.  Like, I don't think I can stand the thought of soup and deprivation for a year or two.  When I try to diet, I usually only last about a day. If that long. But I can do this for a week. If I know that at the end of the week, I can eat whatever I want, I'll be able to do it. It's like when I was quitting smoking, sometimes the only thing that kept me going was the thought of When this is all over, I will reward myself by having a cigarette.   If I can show the slightest bit of progress after a week, then I'll be able to stand the next week. And so on.  Not sure that will work, though. If I am able to lose two pounds in a week, it won't even show on me. I suspect I'll have to commit to a month before I see any results, and I'm not sure I can do that.   That's kind of pathetic, what I just wrote.  Like I can't curb my intake for a whole month, how weak.  LATER.  So far so good. It's 1:22 p.m. of Day One, and so far have kept to the plan. Yep. Got several hours under my belt here.  Had 1/2 can soup for breakfast. Exercised for one freaking hour. One hour. Had a glass of tomato juice. Moved some books around. Went to Kmart and bought storage boxes. Took the videos back. Went grocery shopping and bought a bunch of good food. It was SO hard to pass by the candy aisle. Seriously. Now that I'm allowing this concept of "maybe I shouldn't eat so much" I am stunned by how difficult it is to moderate food. For the past several weeks, I've had it in the back of my mind that I was going to eat less, and I'd do okay for one meal, and then suddenly find myself with a Whopper in my hand. And I'd think, that's okay, I hardly ever eat stuff like this. And then I realized how often I've been saying that to myself.  The exceptions have become the rule. So weight loss or not, it's time to be eating higher quality food.  So the rest of my Quiznos sandwich for lunch, and a glass of new raspberry-flavored seltzer water. Which, by the way, exploded all over the front of my blouse, the counter, and the cabinets when I opened it. Very fizzy stuff, seltzer water.  I feel quite full, so hopefully I'll get through the afternoon on plan.  I guess I'm not going to work today, so I'll try to be productive at home.  I was so so slothful over Christmas, and it's started to make me feel weaselly.  Maybe I'll even pack up some stuff in the storage boxes. It could happen.  LATER. It's 3:24 on Day One. Still good.  Haven't eaten anything since lunch. Actually, I'm still full.  Drinking my sodium-free seltzer water, which is rather filling, or perhaps bloating is the right word. Whatever, as long as it keeps my mind off eating.  I can see that's going to be important — it's not a matter of finding super low-cal food that you can stuff your face with all day, rather it's important to break the habit of needing to stuff your face all day.  I haven't packed anything, but I did assemble one box.  Now I'm ripping down the wallpaper in the guest bathroom. There's still SO much to do before the house is ready to sell.  We've only crossed a few things off the list.  LATER.  5:28 p.m. of Day One.  Still doing okay.  Haven't eaten since lunch — I wasn't hungry for my afternoon snack. I'm treating myself to a glass of wine (thinned with seltzer).  Making chicken wings and broccoli for dinner.  I will make some kind of sauce or dip or whatever with no-fat yogurt for the broccoli, so I can avoid the lemon butter.  Being busy all day definitely helped — I want to snack when I'm bored.  Also, puttering around like that does count toward burning the calories. I'm really looking forward to the glider.  My knees are a little iffy sometimes with the stepping, but even more than that, it makes my feet hurt.  The impact seems to be cumulative, because after I've done a lot of stepping, my legs and butt fall asleep when I go to bed.

       10:28 a.m. Saturday, Day 34.   Oh, my numbers from yesterday suck.  What a bad week it’s been.  I’m over the tppw number with two full days to go. I can only have 1700 calories each day to stay under oppw. On the plus side, I learned you can eat a LOT of sushi for very low calories. I’ll just try to do better today, and hopefully next week will be easier.  I haven’t fallen off the horse at all, just not doing as well as I want. And speaking of calories. Orange juice? It sucks.  Way too many calories. Juice is not a good deal, the actual fruit is much better.  I will try to have shrimp salad for dinner tonight.   3:51 p.m. I had to eat the damned pasta stir fry for lunch, there wasn’t anything else.  It tastes great, the problem is that it’s awfully high in calories. Even a small portion is pretty high and it’s not very filling. No more pasta.  Ever.  In good news, when I put on my “regular” jeans right from the dryer, they were almost loose. That was a pleasant surprise.

       6:53 a.m. Friday, Day 33.  Yesterday wasn’t as bad as it could have been.  I’m holding onto that.   I restrained myself heavily with the stir fry. No more pasta, ever. Never.  If I’m going to have that many useless carbs, then I want it in the form of alcohol. Which I also had.  Why has this week been so hard? Yeah, I keep asking that and coming up with the same answers: boredom and hormones. Or something. So let’s just drop it. I’m doing the best I can, and it’s not all that bad, anyway. I’m doing a B- instead of the A+ I want, but I still get on the honor roll. Not the best analogy I’ve ever come up with, but it will do.  In other news, there’s something wrong with my eyes.  I thought it was the monitor, because it’s all flickery, especially around the edges. If I focus on something reflected on the glass, the flickering disappears. But I noticed the same thing happen on the PC. Also the light in the room seems to be flickering to me, I thought the lightbulb was loose until I turned around and stared at it, and it’s fine.  It’s something that’s happening with my peripheral vision.  I don’t know if I need to panic yet.  Hoping for a better day today.  I found a great snack, frozen blueberries.  They’re wonderful frozen, a great texture, and you can eat a buttload of them for very few calories, but good fiber. Also I believe they are chock full o’ antioxidants.  Haven’t heard from Daisy for over a week, which is always depressing. The last time this happened, I decided to wait her out. I hate always being the needy one calling her three times a day. Yeah, so the last time I waited her out, it was more than two weeks, and I ended up calling her anyway.  Damn, I don’t want to be clingy, but somehow she’s my only friend. Which can’t be good, but I like her so much better than anyone else that when I’m with other people I want to be with her. I think she’s my boyfriend.  Been reading a lot of weight loss blogs.  It helps.  Something that a lot of people do is list a bunch of rewards they get when they reach a certain weight. Should I do that?  Like, when I can wear the Measurement Pants, can I buy myself something? Or give myself an outing of some sort?  Yes. I think I should. And perhaps I should look a few more pounds into the future. And also, I need to go eat breakfast. It’s almost 8:00, I’ve been surfing and nattering for an hour.  At least I’m feeling better today. More optimistic.  9:39 a.m. Just did twenty minutes of the Cindy Crawford video and it KILLED me. I don’t know how I used to get through that thing. It’s miserable. I’m going to glide for 15 minutes or so now, make sure I burn some calories.  10:06 a.m. 200 calories on the glider.  I’m tired!  Going to have a quick shower, a little snackie, and then I have to get the videos back by noon.  The roads are all good as soon as you get out of the subdivision, so that’s my only worry. Should be fine.  12:29 p.m. Back from the video store, no problem driving. Also picked up a tile sample at Home Despot. Vinyl tile for the kitchen. Not so good, I think the beige is better.  Had a couple three lettuce wraps with hummus and cherry tomatoes. Not bad, but not enough food for sure. I’m going to let it digest a little bit and drink some water, and then I’ll see what else to eat.  Finally gave in and called Daisy. She was at work (gack!) and says Dotty was laid off this morning. With no notice, just pack up your stuff and get out. Although, who knows the whole story. Pretty gross, though, no matter what. That place sucks. Which I might have mentioned before.  1:35 p.m. Had a burrito for lunch.  It’s more calories than I wanted to have, but the best choice out of what’s available.  I can’t get away from my journal today, it’s my lifeline. But I can’t seem to get any interest or enthusiasm for doing anything. I’m so listless recently. Doldrums.  I think I need something good to happen, to give me a little boost. Like for one of my tables to sell, or to actually lose some weight. I need a little encouragement.  3:40 p.m. Bored. That’s what it is.  I need a project to do. I haven’t painted anything in forever, and I’m never happy when I’m not painting.  4:44 p.m.  Just did another 38 minutes on the glider, bringing my calories burned to 500. Well, counting Cindy Crawford, it’s 718 today.  I’m glad to have done it — it kept me from getting too squirrelly, kept me from snacking, and will compensate somewhat for the drinks and possibly sushi I plan on having tonight. I don’t feel nearly so hungry, either. And I want to point out that it’s almost 5:00 on a drinking night, and I haven’t drank yet. Which is good.  That’s one reason I’ve been drinking so much is that I’m starting too early.  If I have one drink an hour (my average rate), but start at 2 p.m., well, it’s pretty easy to have six or seven drinks.  I think I like this idea of adding different exercise to the glider.  I have to introduce some variety. That’s why I wanted the library of workout tapes, so I can do a little something different every day.  Maybe I’ll even buy a couple more. I kind of want to try The Firm, but I doubt very much that I can do any of it. I also doubt I will be able to stand the tapes, because I HATE the commercials.  Those women look like Barbies. OK, so The Firm is out.  Also probably Richard Simmons. I like the level of effort in the Dancing to the Oldies tape, but I hate the music. Maybe if I can preview what songs are on a particular tape, I might buy it.

       7:03 a.m. Thursday, Day 32.  Okay, yesterday sucked.  I had a lot of good talk about the almonds, but then I went and had extra chicken at lunch, too many pistachios, too much wine, and extra pork chop.  Totally out of control.  It's just been driving me this week, I really really want to sit down and eat a LOT. In one sitting.  It almost doesn't matter what the food is, I just want to eat until I feel really full.  I want to SNACK. What's going on?  Is it the boredom, is it hormonal, is it the diet catching up with me?  Am I simply not eating enough, and my body is very strongly urging me to have some food? And if so, which of us is right, me or the body?  I mean, is the body guiding me toward health, or is it trying to trick me into more fat-producing patterns? Gah.  Well, in semi-good news, I finally weighed the pork chops we've been having, and as I suspected, I am WAY overestimating their size. They're only three ounces, barely, not four ounces. So here is my new official chart for the pork chops:  1 pork chop from the whole loin: calories	268; protein grams	23; carbs	0; fat	18; fiber	0.  It's only semi good because although it means I have been eating fewer calories than I thought, that leads me to the idea of why I'm not losing weight faster.  A line of thought I'd better not explore right now, or I'll quit dieting.  I hope it's OK I'm calling this a diet. It's not really, you can see by my charts [offline] that I'm eating a reasonable amount of food, and a great variety of it.  But I am eating less than I used to, so I'll call that a diet for the sake of brevity.  Not sure I'm going to the art museum today. I kind of don't feel like it, even after being cooped up in the house so long.  I hardly did a damned thing for the last five days, and want to get something accomplished.  Found a couple web pages I like, SkinnyCat and Mr. Ointy. Most of these blogs are people doing WW, so they talk about Points all the time, but I'm getting a lot out of them.  One thing I like is that they have, for the most part, realistic weight loss scenarios.  They lose a pound or two at a time, they occasionally regress, it takes them a couple-three years.  So that way I know that I'm not totally fucked up and unique. On Mr. Ointy she says something about starting to feel guilty about wanting to eat food, even when she doesn't eat it.  Yeah, I've been feeling like that too.  I've been obsessing and freaking out over my daily totals, even when they are well within the oppw range. I feel like my eating is out of control, even when I don't actually eat anything, because I WANT to eat so much. THAT is what I don't like about dieting - it's an eating disorder.  10:37 a.m. Well. I did weights, gliding, and yoga, for a total of 60 minutes. That sounds pretty good.  Can’t say I liked the yoga; I can barely do it, so I find myself lying on the floor waiting for her to move on to the next position. So I gave myself low calories for it since I had a lot of idle time.  I’m pretty hungry, but going to try to wait until 11:15 for a snack, so that I’m not eating immediately after exercising. Then I’ll have late lunch, 12:30 or 1:00. Then snack at 3:00. Sounds good to me. I also got my McN sales letter in the mail. Keeping my fingers crossed, it would RULE if something came of that. Finished watching Blue Crush, excellent movie! And I’ve taped Deadly Summer to watch for the next few days.  11:34 a.m. Little snack of carrot and pistachios. Also made some hummus. Not sure what a serving would be. I’m thinking about three tablespoons, which is sufficient for a sandwich or to dip carrots in. So I’ll estimate that as about 1.5 ounces:  3 tbsp hummus: calories	62; protein 2.4; carbs	7; fat	3.1; fiber	2.4  12:18 p.m. I’m still hungry and snack-wanting today.  I think getting the pistachios was a bad idea. They’re pretty high in calories and fat, and an ounce of them is not at all satisfying, it just leads me to want more. Fortunately I don’t have many here; I put up about five servings in baggies and sent the rest with Bucko to work.  I’ve got to keep busy today, keep my mind off food.  4:12 p.m. Gaahh, I’m still having a terrible time keeping away from the food!  I hope I can last until dinner.  I just had a handful of cherry tomatoes for my afternoon snack, and I suspect I will have a carrot too.  The pistachios are haunting me. At least I was honest and recorded them, but I think I might have to send the rest to work with Bucko.  I can’t eat 22 of them. I need to eat about 80.  I haven’t even planned dinner, I’m trying to avoid food as much as I can.  I hope I’m going to get over this soon, because if it keeps on this way I will absolutely have to binge.  I am all OK with going out to dinner or something to have a little celebration, but I’d like to save it for Week 6, or preferably Month Three.  I’m only four days into Month Two!  And if that’s not bad enough, I decided to take my measurements.  I knew it would be bad, but this was really frightening.  It was so bad, I only did my waist and hips, and then gave up. Which, by the way, ARE THE SAME MEASUREMENT.   Oh.  My.  God.   I hate, absolutely hate, completely and furiously and determinedly hate, the way my stupid stomach has grown so big.  Not only is it unattractive as hell, it is OF COURSE, the most dangerous type of fat to have.  Most women gain in their butts, which does not pose the health risk of stomach fat, which is partly why women live longer. But me? Oh no.  No no no, I have to get the BAD fat. Of course.   So. Here I will write what must be the most humiliating item I will ever write in this journal. The only reason I CAN write it is the hope, however small, that someday I will look at this number as a marathon runner looks back at the starting line. As simply the way to measure how far one has come. That number is my waist AND hip measurement. My wip. My haist. My one-number-for-all-body-parts-is-ever-so-much-more-convenient number. My-body-is-shaped-like-a-fat-cylinder number, or possibly like-a-watermelon-stood-on-end number. That number is:  45 inches.   I had toyed with the idea of taking some reference photos of myself, so I could see the change over time, but now I’m thinking that would be simply too horrible.

       7:24 a.m. Wednesday, Day 31.  Another day in the house. Bucko may try to go to work, but I'm not budging. Be surprised if I could get out of the neighborhood.  So yesterday was mediocre.  My total calories aren't that bad, it's just that I felt such pressure to snack.  Right before I went to bed I had another drumstick. I read somewhere that it's good to have a 100-calories protein snack right before bed, I guess it helps your body repair during the night and not burn muscle. Perhaps, but it also gave me intense, movie-like dreams all night. All about vampires. They weren't quite nightmares, just a little uneasy. Like, I'm never going to be RELAXED around vampires, you know? Even when they swear they aren't going to bite me.  I'm looking at this website, www.reneesgarden.com, that sells gourmet and heirloom seeds. Flowers, vegetables, herbs.  It's a nice page, sort of "old-fashioned" in design, kind of 1998.  I like it.  I won't be able to have a garden this year, but I'm hoping for next year, after we've moved. Maybe we'll have a yard that's better set up (sun) for growing things. I've wanted a kitchen herb garden for years.  I guess I want to sort of be a little hippie woman, puttering around my house nude, growing herbs, and making art. Ah.  Hoping today goes better. I feel better. I think it was looking at those lovely seeds. You see, the power of the mind is amazing. Completely changed my mood by visualizing being a naked hippie woman in the garden.  I need to defrost some meat for today. And figure out how to cook that spaghetti squash. That stuff is weird.  So anyway, I'm feeling pretty good, but I must say I want a further proof of weight loss. The Measurement Pants are too tricksy; I can't rely on them to be consistent. The ring is not bad, but I want more. I want to know that I am CONTINUING to lose weight.  I feel like I'm in a vacuum, where results are disconnected from effort, and that's when I get discouraged.  I'm looking back over my previous entries, and I see that I didn't notice any change until Day Ten. That's when I felt pretty sure I had lost some weight, because of the Measurement Pants.  Then they were tight again until Day 22.  Hmm. Is this going to run in ten or eleven-day cycles?  Better try them on today.  9:54 a.m. 50 minutes on the glider, and 415 calories. Watched half of Blue Crush. Not a bad movie - great music, great surfing shots.  I can't even imagine doing something like that. At my fittest, I would never have attempted it. On the other hand, I don't know when my "fittest" was.  When I weighed the least is not necessarily the same thing.  Glad I started using that postal scale to weigh food.  I had a tiny handful of sunflower seeds, and the smallest measurement for them in the Netzer book is 1 ounce. So I figured, yeah I probably ate an ounce. For 170 calories! No way!  I measured it on the scale, and my portion was no more than a quarter of an ounce. Big difference.  The sun is out today, and that will make all the difference in my mood. Much happier. I hope I can keep myself busy.  I will print out that McN. letter and get it ready for the mail tomorrow.  Not sure what else I will do. Perhaps pack more. Bleh.  Here's something else I just realized — I have to engage in deliberate, healthy snacking. There's no doubt that 5 or 6 small meals is a much healthier, fat-loss-promoting way to eat.  I've been hard on myself for snacking because I'm trying to limit the overall quantity of food I eat, and especially unplanned, uncontrolled eating.  I need to make the snacks planned and controlled.  AND I think I need to cut my gliding down to about 45 minutes tops, and then do 15 minutes of some other type of exercise.  I don't want to do weights every day, but I could dance, or do Cindy Crawford, or pilates, or whatever. Also: wait one hour after workout before eating.  1:46 p.m. Made it to the store, roads are variable.  First I have to write that I bought chocolate covered almonds and ate them.  They were delicious. I suppose I should feel guilty or something, but I don't.  Apparently I really needed that, now I've had it, and everything is fine.  I didn't need to eat half a pound, it hasn't put me on a binge, I don't need to eat more.  I'm happy with what I had, without it inspiring greater need. And that is progress for me.

       8:09 a.m. Tuesday, Day 30.  Looks like another day in the house - the ice storm has been less severe than predicted, but it has lasted a lot longer. So far we've kept power, which is the most important thing. But the roads are impassable, so we'll be in here at least until tomorrow. We have food for a couple more days, probably even 4-5 days if I'm creative, so that's not a worry. But almost out of fresh vegetables, which sucks. Only one apple left and one banana.  I had a really hard time not snacking yesterday. Look how high my calories are, for a non-drinking day. I even ate pretzels. Fortunately, I just took a very small handful out of the bag, put the bag away, then sat down to eat them. I think it's 90% boredom and maybe 10% undereating (considering all the exercise).  I will have to keep busier today, somehow. And if I need to eat, I will eat. But I'll eat good food, not crap. That's a winning plan. Yesterday was also hard because Bucko was on the computer all day.  I'm going to move this over to the PC again today. Bah.  In good news, I did that letter to G. McN yesterday. It finally flowed from my brain relatively easily.  I emailed it to Daisy, in case she has time to look at it, and I will send it out whenever the weather is better (no mail). I really want him to get "first crack" at my stuff before I end up taking it to the E.G. That 50-50 split is not going to work.  1:45 p.m. Fighting a great urge to snack. I'm definitely bored. There are things I could do, should do, but don't want to do. Housework. More packing. At least I did some grouting in the guest bathroom. Can't quite finish, though, because we have the tub filled with water, and I need to get into it to do the shower area. Put my tools in my new toolbox. I'll use the old one for oil paints. I'm taping a couple painting shows on PBS, and eventually I'll actually paint something. I'm thinking a Bob Ross landscape, a still life, and then perhaps that visual translation of a poem thingie. I had a bit more lunch that I should have, perhaps. A pork chop AND a drumstick. Ah well, I kept it to one of each, when I felt like I could eat six or seven.  Some leftover peas and corn. Nothing exciting, but it's only 2 p.m. and I'm up to 857 calories already. Grr.  I suspect I am overestimating the pork chops, because they are quite small, but then again, probably I miss a few other calories here and there, so perhaps it all evens out. Anyway, I don't like to be this far in my calories when I'm having a major snack-desiring day. Must drink a LOT of water!  I'll have to eat pickles and carrots and cucumbers and other almost-no-cal food today.  And perhaps have the shrimp salad for dinner - that's so few calories for what you're getting.  I remembered a carrot from yesterday, and had to go put it into the chart. Only 30 calories, but still, I don't like how my numbers crept up yesterday.  It seems to be from the snacking. Morning AND afternoon snacks.  I keep saying it's from the boredom, but I'm not sure if it's also from the exercise.  I don't want to starve myself, I want to keep my metabolism up, so I do actually have to be concerned with not eating enough.  It looks very well-rounded, though.  I haven't yet hit my goal for tppw - 1303 calories - and I'm starting to think I never well.  That's just not enough food.  Also I'm concerned that I'm not eating enough fiber. I want about 14 grams, and I'm doing more like 4 or 5 grams.  The carrots are pretty high in fiber for the calories, so maybe I'll eat those more frequently. Also beans and nuts.  I'm going to start using that postage scale for weighing dry foods.  It's too hard to estimate sometimes - and I want to start using a trick I saw on Drop the Donut, which is to divide up food into portions, and put them in separate sandwich bags. So you know what you're getting. How many pistachios in an ounce? I have no idea. 10? 50?  Bucko is upstairs working out, and I am so happy. Not only do I get to use the Mac, but I am thrilled he is exercising. As fat as I am, I'm starting to be more concerned about his health. He is just so sedentary.  I'm trying to get him to use the glider, for cardiovascular exercise, but he doesn't seem to have taken to it. Ah ha, I have to take that back, he just put in about 10 minutes on it. Yay!  7:37 p.m.  Drinking my last glass of water for the day. I got most of it in early, and then forgot about it in the afternoon.  Had a giant dinner of grilled shrimp salad, with mangoes and also chicken breast.  I couldn't help snacking tonight, but limited myself to three ritz crackers. If I can stop here, it will be fine, I'm still only at 1596.  Not great, but not bad.  I think I might be getting that "we're running out of food so I want to eat it all" panic feeling.  I know I won't be able to get to the store tomorrow, the roads are still so bad. We have enough food for another day or two, but we're out of fresh stuff and really yummy stuff. Well, I'm not going to beat myself up for it, my huge binge today was much less than it would have been a month ago. So, three crackers and an extra drumstick, BFD. That's a pretty well-controlled binge.

       7:40 a.m. Monday, Day 29. WELCOME TO MONTH TWO!  Week Five. I can't believe it. I can't believe I got through a whole month without falling off the horse, without "cheating," without going crazy, and most of all that I'm preparing to do it for at least another month.  I'm hoping I can do even better this month. Especially in this area: drink more water and less alcohol.  My yesterday's numbers are probably a little off.  I ate 8 more black olives after I filled out my numbers, and also ate somewhat more steak fries than the serving those numbers are based on.  It just seems like too much work to redo all my numbers for a lousy 50-60 calories. Sigh. Well, you know of course I'm going to do it.  Okay, I'm back, I did it.  It was 68 calories, not a huge amount. I also want to make sure I lift weights more often this month.  I notice that I am looking flabbier than usual.  Isn't that weird — that when I weigh less I should actually look fatter?  At any rate, I think that's a good indication that I need to build some muscle. Oh my. Look how I'm writing about having lost weight, as though it's definitely true.  And it probably is.  It's just that I can't quite believe it.  I think I will truly believe it on the day I can wear the Measurement Pants outside the house.  8:51 a.m. Just finished 20 minutes of TotalGym and lifting small weights. Whew!  We have the heat turned up pretty high so that if/when the power goes out, we might stay warm a little longer, and it's uncomfortable in here. I only have the heat at 68 degrees — I don't know how people can stand it at 70 and 72. Trying to drink another glass of water before I start gliding.   10:57 a.m. Finished 50 minutes on the glider, with 406 calories burned. It was exhausting, which is probably attributable to the weight lifting I did first. I'm on my seventh glass of water already, yay. And had a great snack of an apple with no-fat unflavored yogurt, cinnamon, and vanilla. Saw it on Dr. Phil, and it's pretty good. I'm fairly hungry today, looking forward to lunch, but happy I already met two of this week's goals, weightlifting and drinking water. And of course, gliding and dieting.  We are snowed in for today and possibly tomorrow, so Bucko has been using the computer a lot and it was driving me CRAZY that I couldn't get to my journal. I am seriously dependent on this thing.  I must write down my every thought, no matter how trivial.  Tried on the Measurement Pants AGAIN.  I must stop doing that. They were tighter than I remembered last time, but it's not a good scientific system.  I know I should only try them on once a week.  I know I'll give in to the temptation, but maybe I can at least put it off until Friday.  1:33 p.m. Apparently the worst of the ice storm is yet to hit. Bad news.  I'm getting a little stir crazy!

       7:59 a.m. Sunday, Day 28.  Yep, that's right. The last day of Week Four. One whole month done. Incredible.  Yes, let's talk about last night and get that out of the way. That was quite the big blow-out for me.  2268 calories, most of it in liquid form.  We went to Portobello for drinks and dessert.  I chose the blueberry sorbet, which was probably only half the calories of anything else on the tray, and also delicious and weirdly my first choice, but then I got a fancy coffee drink.  I really don't know how to count that, the coffee itself has no calories, but she put a shot of liquor in it, and some whipped cream on top. But the whipped cream was from a can, so it has a lot of air in it. So, whatever, I made a blind guess.  That was my big celebration for the end of four weeks, and I think it was pretty good.  I could have had pizza and brownies and ended up with a total in the 4000-5000 range, so in fact it was pretty moderate. However, it will ruin my calories-per-day average, which was quite low otherwise this week.   In other good news, the wedding ring is still fitting, and my newish jeans seemed pretty loose yesterday.  When I bought them a couple months ago, they fit snugly. Now they're starting to sag in the front, similarly to the way my old jeans do. Daisy talked me into trying another month, back when I was bloated and concerned I hadn't lost any weight, but now I'm definitely going to do it anyway. I suspect I am hovering at being able to wear a 24 again; what if I do this for another month and fit into a 22? That would be significant. My dream is to fit a 12. Then I could buy clothes ANYwhere.  We're supposed to have an ice storm this afternoon and evening.  I'd better cook a bunch of food today, because we'll almost certainly lose power. Grrr.  I don't remember EVER losing power in Colorado.  The good news is it's supposed to get above freezing tomorrow, so the damage will be limited. They will (should) be able to get the power back on faster than last time.  10:05 a.m.  I'm going around preparing for the power out — filling up bathtubs, doing laundry, washing dishes, cooking food.  I probably won't be able to write in here much longer, it would be safest to turn off the computers. So I'll have to scribble by hand for a day or two. Goodbye, dearest journal! Mmmmwwaaah! (kissy gesture).  10:53 a.m. Ha ha, the power is still on. I've got everything done except the cooking, which is in progress.  Already bored with this whole storm thing. I closed off the bedrooms upstairs and turned off the vents in those rooms. Turned the heat up a little so that when it goes out, we might keep warm a little longer. Now I don't know what to do, I feel like I'm just sitting around waiting. Perhaps I will try to clean up more of the office.

       7:39 a.m. Saturday, Day 27.  Two more days left in Week Four.  My numbers yesterday are terrible, so good thing for all that exercise!!  MUST do better today. Which won't be easy, seeing as it's a Saturday. We'll see. I'm still planning on some chocolate, either today or tomorrow.  I'd like to get some of that Skinny Cow ice cream sandwiches, but they come in a big package of six or either. I don't want that many in the freezer, I'll eat them every day.  Not sure I can justify buying the package, eating one, and throwing the rest away.  9:56 a.m. Still full from breakfast. Had some sort of steak-and-mushroom soup, which is 20 calories more than the chicken rice, but way more filling.  Probably worth the extra.  Note: need to increase fiber a LOT. By about double. I don't like most grains, and also most are too high in calories, so I'll have to do some investigating. Also get some almonds. They're worth the calories. And some frozen strawberries.  4:01 p.m. Just back from shopping for shoes, pillows, caulk, and casters. Took all freaking day, and I'm exhausted. And thirsty. Had a fantastic lunch at Greek Fiesta in the FOM, but it was very salty.

       6:17 a.m. Friday, Day 26.  Three more days in Week Four.  After the first couple days of this, it seems to have flown by.  I can say I definitely lost weight, but not very much.  My calculations give me a pound and a half a week, so in this period I should have lost 6 pounds, and I don't think it's been that much. Maybe only 3 or 4 pounds. Well, hell, it's impossible to tell.  I just thought 6 pounds would feel more apparent.  I have some proofs that I lost weight — the Measurement Pants, the wedding ring, so that's good, I just want it to be more.  However, I will not obsess too much on that. For two reasons: I don't want to be a scale queen, and also because it's GOOD to lose weight slowly.  I have a better chance of my skin shrinking along with my body, it puts less stress on every part of my body, and it's maintainable.  Crash dieting to lose quickly is useless.  Thinking about goals today.  I set my short-term goal to lose 10% of my weight, which should be around 26 pounds. Damn, that's a lot!  That's as much as some people need to lose in total!  So... my long-term goal is to lose 110 pounds. Jeez. Again, that's as much as some people weigh!  Anyway, that puts me at 150, which I think is a pretty good weight for me. When I get there, I can see how it feels.  So, that's four and a quarter "units" of 26 pounds.  I need to do this slightly more than four times. Which will take me approximately 14 months. Yikes!  That's a little intimidating, considering that most people lose weight quickest at the beginning!  I can only hope I don't fit the norm, and start losing weight faster. Yeah, I know a really good way to do that would be to stop drinking so much!  Well, one thing at a time, peoples.  It will come.  Reading some more food entries on FitDay.  The one I looked at today seems more realistic than the others.  She seems to eat a normal amount and type of food. Not all that Smart Ones crap.  I know that stuff is easy and fast, but it's expensive and crappy.  That's the dilemma with food choices; it can be healthy, cheap, tasty, easy to make.  But you can only have two out of the four.  I'm hoping for a more relaxed day today.  I have a little bit of work, which I will try to get out of the way after my workout. Then maybe I'll have energy to do something around the house. And try to delay drinking.  That's my problem with Drinking Day, I start it too early.  When it's not drinking day, I have one or two small drinks. Yes, I know I'm not supposed to drink AT ALL on non drinking days, thank you very much. Anyway, it's sooooo nice to sit down with a glass of wine in the late afternoon, chopping up vegetables for dinner and watching Oprah. It's so cozy. I'm hoping if I delay that a few hours, I'll end up drinking less overall. It's worth a try.  9:43 a.m. Did a few minutes of lifting small weights before gliding. whoo hoo! 55 minutes on the glider, not bad.  Now I am truly starving, and will have a banana for a snackie. And more water. More more more.  12:15 p.m.  Had a lovely lunch of two stuffed zucchini halves and an ounce of cheese. How do I know it was an ounce, you ask? Because I weighed it on the postage scale. Hee.  And I can tell you, cheese is not worth it. Over a hundred calories for an ounce!  I'd rather have chocolate. Which I might do this weekend, by the way. A little one-month celebration.  I've written 67 pages in this month, which is more than the entire previous year.  I thought I would slack off with the journal, but it's still important to me.  It's not just a record, it's actually helping me control.  It's a tool, if you will.  Who would have thought?  I got some of the office sorted out and packed up. We just have too damned much stuff. I mean, dammit.  And yet I can't seem to throw it away.  Now it's 1:07, and it looks worse than when I started.  I guess the problem is that we have two or three businesses going on.  I work at home on the computer, I paint at home, Bucko does video production at home... this is why we need to move.  If all this stuff was in a big ass bonus room that you didn't see from the rest of the house, then it wouldn't matter. I'd just build floor-to-ceiling shelves and be done with it.  Starting to crave a drink already.  I think I'd better do some more gliding today — both to delay the drinking and to work off the calories. And I need to get off the computer, except for writing in here.  I've spent all morning downloading documents. Bah.  Also, just got a good look at myself in the mirror, and am completely horrified. How is it possible I'm this fat?   I'm so scared at how far I have to go.  And sad about going to Tahiti looking and feeling like this.  I tried, or thought I tried, to lose weight for the past year, and if only I had been able to work at it this hard, I might be 80 pounds lighter by now.  It makes me think of all the "make it or break it" deadlines I used to give myself. "You HAVE TO lose weight before you start Junior High, or your whole life will be ruined." "You MUST lose weight before your wedding or your whole life will be ruined."  Sad part is, I was partly right.  I don't say my life was RUINED, but it was sure heavily affected by my weight in a very negative way.  It's stopped me from doing so many things.  Partly because of my own self-confidence and partly in a physical sense.  So now I have a lot more self-confidence and am willing to do things whether I'm fat or not, but it's too little too late.  Well, no, as long as you're alive it's not too late for anything, but I can't help but think how my life would have been different...  in a movie, we'd dissolve into a dream/fantasy sequence here where I had this fantastic, glamorous, utterly absurd life, and then after a while a bunch of annoying, stupid things would happen to shatter the image.  3:23 p.m. Whew!  I just did another 45 or so minutes on the glider, and another 460 calories, to buy myself two martinis!  I'm not sure of the time, because apparently it turns over after a certain amount. When I finished it said I had gone 10 minutes, which makes no sense. My brain is too numb to figure it out, but next time I glide I won't reset the clock, and I'll just see where it turns over. Anyway, I don't know if this is clever or me, or totally disordered, but since I know I'm going to drink tonight, I might as well work off the calories, rather than drink tonight and not work off the calories.  I'm going to finish my glass of water, then go make myself a delicious martini, and sit down and enjoy it without guilt. And then I really really need a shower. Can I start subtracting my exercise calories from those I ate?  Is that fair?  Like today I've exercised more calories than I've eaten, so far.  By the end of the day, can I subtract 1001 exercise calories from, say, 1720 eaten calories, for a total of 719 calories today? Or is that cheating or delusional?  Tomorrow I might actually take my measurements.  Yeah, yuck.  I hate to see those gigantic numbers. But since I'm not weighing myself, it would be good to have some sort of reference. Ugh. Depressing. Gonna go have that martini now.  4:06 p.m. Weirdly, I'm thinking about Bob Hope's passing, and it makes me quite sad. It's the passing of an era, the greatest era of American history.  That generation, which survived the Great Depression and World War II, and which we hated and feared in the crazy Sixties, are people I admire and envy now. Yes, envy. There is such strength to those people, such purpose. Read Michener. Read Heinlein. You'll see it in those two, as different as they are, they're the same generation. They believe in something bigger than themselves. They believe in making themselves as strong as possible, so that the One will be stronger. That's honor. That's what I want. Yeah, I just had a martini on an empty stomach. In vino veritas.  4:43 p.m.  Not a thing to write, but I still want to be in my journal. This has become such a huge part of my life. Trying to decide what to make for dinner. I've got chicken breast and pork loin. Maybe I should make both. Some sort of stir fry. There's broccoli and zucchini.... hmm. That sounds good. I'm pretty hungry, I had to have an apple. Can you believe how well I'm doing with snacking??  At the beginning, I planned to allow myself a morning and afternoon snack, and I've rarely had either.  Although recently I've been spacing my meals out more. That is, I eat a little something for lunch, and another little something an hour later for lunch part 2.  Which is apparently the healthier way to eat, anyway. You don't feel deprived because you're eating frequently, and the small meals eaten often keep your metabolism up.  Next week I had better make sure to do more weight lifting.  This week I did a LOT of gliding, which is fine, but I am probably losing too much muscle. I need to pay more attention to the exercise part of this equation — get more variety of exercise. I know I've been saying that for years.  But, it will come.  I'm more patient with this than before. Something I've been saying for years — if it just works, I can put up with anything. And this seems to be working. Yes, I'd like it to be faster, but it IS working, so fine.  And of course, I don't really know how much I've lost. Maybe it's MORE than 2 pounds a week. How could I tell, really?  I think my body looks a bit different. Unfortunately, not in a good way, which is what tells me I need to lift weights more.  I look flabbier than I used to. More saggy. I suppose I can expect some changes along the way. I keep pulling my ring on and off to reassure myself.  Can I say that counting calories is a major pain in the ass?  It would be easier if I was buying pre-packaged food, but I cook almost everything fresh. So if I make stir-fry tonight, I have to figure out the calories for: the oil, the meat, the broccoli, the zucchini, the peppers, the garlic, the onions, etc., etc., and then divide it by whatever amount we eat as one portion. And if I have a bag of frozen peppers, for instance, it gives the calories as "one serving" of the bag, with 3.5 servings per bag. So I have to figure out THAT. Now, vegetables like that are not a huge amount of calories, so I don't have to worry about accuracy that much, but I can't just GUESS.  That would be way too inaccurate.  Unrelated thought: I don't know if it makes sense to record calories burned during weight lifting. I don't do it by amount of time or calories, I do it by reps. It's not that I'm not burning calories, it's that I consider it irrelevant to weight lifting.

       6:56 a.m. Thursday, Day 25.  Halfway through Week Four.  Feel a little dragged out today; I took a whole actifed last night, to counter the drink/salt/smoke/cats of yesterday afternoon, and it knocked me out pretty good.  Dotty called me at 10 p.m. to ask about Photoshop and it woke me out of a very deep sleep. Yeah, love to play helpdesk  in the middle of the night.  Of course it's not the middle of the night, but it might as well have been.  I'm drinking a glass of water right now before I even have coffee, I'm so dehydrated from the actifed.  I have a busy morning if I want to get to the museum for the next lecture, so I will have to get through my exercise early. Watching Pirates of the Caribbean, it's great.  9:00 a.m. Did 50 minutes of gliding. For some reason I don't seem able to do an hour recently. Possibly I'm just letting myself off the hook. At any rate, any exercise is good.    1:55 p.m. Back from the art museum, video store, grocery.  And starving!  I don't have much prepared for lunch, so decided to have a couple hard boiled eggs and maybe graze through some vegetables and whatnot.  The eggs aren't as bad as I thought they would be, so that will be a treat — haven't had eggs since Christmas. I'm hoping to leave room for one or two drinks, we'll see.  I'm doing well with calories this week, really low.  I keep checking to see if I've left anything out, but no.  I guess my appetite may fluctuate, according to what? Hormones, stress, amount of sleep, amount of exercise?  Probably all those things.  I don't want to go any lower than what I've been doing this week, though.   The lecture was great — realism and impressionism.  It wasn't as clear to me as romanticism and classicism, but still interesting and wonderful to see the slides. Beautiful. She showed a slide of a Venus painting, and didn't say who it was by, it seemed like she wasn't sure. Heh heh, I knew who it was — Alexandre Cabanel.  Made me feel like a smarty pants.  I have to do some work today (feh) but I hope to work in another 15 minutes of glider. We'll see, that might not be realistic.  I have a lot of cooking to do, because I bought so many vegetables last time I can't let them rot.  Eggplant, broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini, cucumbers, and I don't even remember what all.  The whole pork loin was on sale again, for $1.57, so I bought one.  That's a bit difficult, because it's fairly high in calories, so I'll just have to work with portion control. Make a lot of side vegetables with it.  And for that price I don't always have to cook it like a chop; I can shred it up and stir fry, or grind it for meatballs, etc.  Now that's a good idea — I could mix it up with beans in the blender and make meatballs. Yum.  As much as I'm bitching about work, I'm glad to get the hours.  Things are a little tight around here, and a little scary. Tomorrow my goal is to get that letter written!  4:14 p.m.  Did another 20 minutes on the glider!  5:22 p.m. I am soooo hungry.  I didn't eat enough for lunch (just the two eggs) and it's catching up with me.  I didn't intend to skimp so much, but it just seemed like too much work to prepare anything, and there's nothing I could just reach into the refrigerator and grab.  So I never got around to it.  Now I'm so close to dinner I don't want to prepare and eat a mini-meal.  I'm drinking water to see if that will help.  6:43 p.m. Damn good dinner. That eggplant ruled.  I think I will have it for lunch tomorrow. Had sort of a sweet attack after, though, and ate 3 crackers with jelly.  It's not a major problem, since I only had three, just 88 calories.  But boy do those calories add up fast. 40 here, 120 there, and all of a sudden you're at 2000.  I'm not sure how accurate my numbers are for the pork chops.  I kind of took an average between the Netzer book and what I found online.  Since I don't have a scale, I can't know how much anything weighs, so if the numbers are given for weight, rather than size, I have to guess.

       6:31 a.m. Wednesday, Day 24.  Feeling pretty good today. Slept well last night, again. Looking at my numbers for yesterday — not bad for a drinking night.  Bucko brought out a little plate of snackie cheese, actually a rather large plate, and I was remarkably restrained.  Had a few little pieces, then got out some pickles to munch on.  Good choice.  I even drank less than I wanted to, in order to keep the calories down. Excellent.  Doing some research on my BMR — basal metabolic rate.  This is how many calories I would burn while sitting and watching TV 24 hours a day.  Well, I'm paraphrasing, but one gets the idea. Here is the definition: "Your BMR, or basal metabolic rate (metabolism), is the energy (measured in calories) expended by the body at rest to maintain normal bodily functions. This continual work makes up about 60-70% of the calories we use and includes the beating of our heart, respiration, and the maintenance of body temperature. Your BMR is influenced by a number of factors, including age, weight, height, gender, environmental temperature, dieting, and exercise habits."  As always, I'm getting several answers. DIYglobal solutions says 1883, and Hussman.org says between 1636 and 1745  Those are the only two I can get to work — most of the pages seemed to be linked to some calculator or database that is malfunctioning. I keep getting 54545 as the answer. Seems unlikely.  OK, I'm going to use the average of those three, which is: 1754.  That is how many calories I need a day to support life. And, as always, the numbers don't make sense.  I am eating well below that now. I should be dead.  Perhaps I'll ignore this, and just continue eating well and exercising a lot.  In other good news, I am wearing my wedding ring again. Not the original one, but the larger one.  Ah, there's another nice measurement — if I can fit back into my original wedding and engagement rings. OK, those will be the Measurement Rings. Haven't fit into those in YEARS.  I ate breakfast a little late, considering how early I got up, and now I'm drinking water in preparation for exercising.  I realized I need to be good and hydrated first, or it will be much less effective at burning calories. However, now my stomach is all full of water and I must wait a little while before I can exercise, and this is a day I need to get going early. Oh well, I will let everything else suffer and make sure I do my exercise well. Planning on watching Pirates of the Carribean while I glide. I don't have anything ready on tape.  9:04 a.m. Finished 50 minutes on the glider. Got a higher calorie burn than yesterday; I'm not surprised if I was going faster. Yesterday was hard after the TotalGym.  I want to sit here and write all day, but I need to get ready for work pretty quick. Bah.  Also just realized I need to bring something for lunch so I don't eat a bunch of crap.  I guess I can probably put together a salad or whatnot. An apple and a tomato. Etc.  8:25 p.m. Hurray for me!  Even with drinking and eating out, I come out well on the numbers.  Below tppw!  I'm not sure about the she-crab soup; I used the biggest-calorie clam chowder I could find in the Netzer book. Should be close enough.  Also they weren't giant glasses of wine, because two of them were in a restaurant.

       6:44 a.m. Tuesday, Day 23.  Feeling pretty good today. Slept well last night, that makes a big difference.  I might have to go to work today, I hope not. Definitely must go tomorrow for a meeting. Bah. Yes, it's good to get the hours, I'm pretty broke. But that won't stop me whining about it.  Thinking of that Oprah weight-loss show yesterday. One of the things she said was, you have to want to do what it takes to lose weight. We know you want to lose weight, that's not the question, but do you want to do the things that will make you lose weight?  That's about where my head is at these days, so it makes sense to me.  I mean, I wouldn't quite phrase it as "want to" do this stuff, but I'm willing to do what I have to.  I've been getting inspiration in the weirdest places. I mean, no insult to Oprah, but I don't expect to find anything meaningful in a television show. And here I found words of wisdom in the Nutty Professor, too. That's OK, I'll take the help where I get it. I might not admit to anyone else where I got it from, though.  I'm setting up my [offline] chart to start tracking exercise. Whenever I figure out my basal metabolism, then I'll start subtracting my exercise from it.  I can't do it now, because my goal calories already account for exercise. But I want to start tracking it, to make it part of this effort.  I'm still so excited about the Measurement Pants. I was so terrified that I was actually gaining weight instead of losing. But they fit me even looser (less tight, that is) than the previous loose time, so I'm not just shuttling back and forth between the same two points. I guess I can expect a learning-curve type experience with that — I go up occasionally before my period, but when I go down it's lower than the previous down. I think that's the way most people's weight goes when they diet — it rises but falls lower each time it falls. I hope.  So now I'm really looking forward to the day when I put those pants on and then just wear them out of the closet.  Thinking about clothes this morning.  I had a dream last night where I was wearing a pretty little nightie.  I've never had much interest in clothes, because I haven't been able to — I don't fit into anything nice now, and when I was younger my chest was too big and I couldn't fit into anything nice.  I think there's more realistic sizes now, though. And I wouldn't be looking in the Junior department of the store, either, so I think I would have better luck. It's not something I focus on, but it would be so nice, and such a relief, to walk into a store and be able to buy clothes without wanting to cry. Or just be able to buy clothes!  You know, that's why I'm not all feminine and girly, not because of personality but because I've never been able to be dainty and fragile. I guess I never will be, but oh it would be wonderful to buy something PRETTY.  To be able to tuck my shirt in!  I've never in my life been able to do that. Tee hee, I'm being all girly and gushy. What the hell, it's fun.  9:28 a.m. Finished 50 minutes on the glider. Just couldn't quite do 60, it was too tedious and I wasn't doing a strong workout.  I did SensibleGym first, so I imagine that had something to do with it. So that's great, I have one SensibleGym done, one to go for the week.  I tried on the Measurement Pants again before the workout, to make sure I wasn't hallucinating. No, I'm not. They're still difficult to button, but I CAN button them, and zip them, and almost wear them.  I decided to try on some houndstooth dress pants that I haven't worn in several months because I could barely barely button them, and guess what — I can button them. They're still a little tight to wear except with a long shirt, but there is obvious progress. I thought it would be good to have a secondary pair of measurement pants, but they're not going to work.  I'll have to root around for something even smaller that I might have kept. So exciting.  I'm going to have protein today for lunch, since I did SensibleGym today, but I want to increase the amount of vegetables I'm eating. I was so pleasantly surprised to see my low calorie count on high-vegetable days.  I'm going to cook some chicken now, for lunch and for Bucko's burritos, and then I'll have to face the music and deal with work. Yuck. These people are so damned annoying. I want a job where I just do my thing, and people either buy it or don't buy it. Which points to the furniture more than the murals.  I'm sick of people second-guessing what I do and coming up with suggestions and critiques. It's some kind of fun game to them, and they LOOOOVE playing art critic. (yes, I'm crabby today).    Hee hee. Just looked at my recommended weight on the calorie control council page. 115 pounds.  That is fucking ridiculous.  12:09 p.m. Yep, work was just as stupid as I thought it would be. I'm disgusted. Had a chicken breast for lunch. The Netzer book only lists chicken with skin — what's with that? So I'm going to take off 50 calories and 3 grams of fat. Hope that's semi accurate.

       7:50 a.m. Monday, Day 22.  The first day of WEEK FOUR!  Feeling apprehensive - I want to see a lot of progress by the end of this week, and afraid that nothing will have changed.  My goals for this week are the same as last week - drink 7 glasses of water a day and workout on the SensibleGym twice. Didn't achieve either one last week, so here's hoping this time will go better.  Bucko has off from work today for ML King Day, which is nice, but I'll have to move over the PC with my journal. Which I don't like. He knows I have this journal, because the name of the file is "MarlaSecretDiaryBuckoKeepOut.doc," but I don't think he knows what it's about at all. Although maybe he has figured it out recently, since I run in here after every meal and type furiously for five or ten minutes. Ah well, it's a better hobby than bingeing and purging.  8:29 a.m.  Just finished my soup, and drinking a glass of water (noncarbonated) so I can be ready for 9:00.  That's cutting it a little short. Also moved over to the PC.  I'm going to take this opportunity to do a spell check; the ancient version of Word I'm using on the Mac doesn't have it installed.  I guess I'm still feeling a bit squirrely, since I'm writing a bunch of nothing in here. Still nervous about not having lost any weight. I'm so scared that I CAN'T lose weight. I understand I have to be patient, that it will take a while to be measurable, but I really need some kind of proof, something to keep me going.  I'm afraid to try the Measurement Pants, because what if they give me bad news?  I won't have the heart to continue.  I think I must take the risk, though, today or tomorrow. If they give me good news, it will inspire me for the next two weeks!  10:05 a.m.  I'm on my third glass of water. Did a whole hour of gliding, and feel pretty good.  I didn't glide over the weekend, and I think I missed it. According to the glider computer, I burned almost 500 calories. I wonder how accurate that stuff is?  I think it's right on, because the Calorie Control web page says an hour of brisk walking is 686 calories, and I could believe it if gliding burned a little less, because you don't lift your legs. Hmm. I could also believe it burns more. For now, I will go with what its built-in meter say.   After the end of this week, I think I may recalculate my target calories. Maybe. I'm not taking exercise into account in my charts. What I did was roll in the glider/stair stepping I do into the "moderately active" category. However, I might recalculate for my basal rate (number of calories needed to survive while sitting on the sofa) and then chart my calories burned through a) my sedentary lifestyle and b) my deliberate exercise.  My reason for doing that is not so much for greater accuracy, but for greater sense of control over this process.  The exercise is a huge part of this, but all I chart and write about is the food. So my journal is not showing everything I am doing for this goal. It's just a way of involving myself with it more thoroughly, and having a positive number to report - where the bigger numbers are better. I hate that about dieting, it's a process of denying oneself something. That's not good psychologically.  Although - I have to admit this hasn't been too bad. A couple days where it really grinds, but for the most part I am eating plenty of good food, and starting to adapt to this as "normal."  Which is good, because it's not like this is ever going to be over. I can't go back to eating as much as I used to.  I think I can live with it, though. Suppose I can lose weight on this amount; for a maintenance diet what if I eat the same, but one day a week I have pizza or dinner out?  That's livable.  I'm interested to see how much money we're spending on food.  I'm charting our expenditures (for everything) over the last 4 months, and I want to see if we're spending less on eating out (should be) and if so, is our grocery bill the same amount as the difference?  I'm hoping that we're saving some money by eating at home, even though we're eating high quality food. Because it's not cheap!  It will be a little hard to compare, because November was Thanksgiving AND Bucko's mother visited, which entailed a lot of restaurants, and of course Christmas in December, plus our dinner party the same month, so I'm not sure they're normal months.  10:48 a.m. O joy, o victory, o glorious day. Yes. The Measurement Pants. Yes yes YES. I buttoned them. And zipped them. And I could ALMOST wear them. No camel toe. Just a little too tight in the butt crack. A little uncomfortable around the waist. But SO close. And my cool low rise boot leg jeans — I used to struggle to get them buttoned right out of the wash. Today — no problem. So it is happening. It's happening.  3:54 p.m. Doing really well today.  We went out at 11:30 ish, so I brought along a tomato and an apple, so I wouldn't be tempted to eat a fast-food lunch. Or even a restaurant lunch for that matter, because that's going to be pretty big calories. And I'll be damned if I'm going to pay a restaurant price for a green salad, I can make that at home.  Here I am with only 501 calories after lunch! I could have an 800 calorie dinner if I wanted and still be in the tppw range. Hee hee hee. Of course, I'm starting to get hungry already, and I ate lunch at 2:30, so obviously vegetables don't last long enough. But, I know I can make it to dinner, I just will drink a lot of water and keep busy. Learned that trick early on.  You see how inspired I am from the Measurement Pants?  I don't need much encouragement, but I need something.  I am so excited.  Partly horrified at how long this is going to take (one year to 18 months) but mostly very excited.  I have said, every time I failed to lose weight, if it just WORKED I could stand anything.  If it DOES work this time, I am going to be interested to know why.  Not sure what is different. Well, yes I am, it's a bunch of small things, not one big difference.  7:02 p.m. Delicious dinner of shrimp salad and steak fries. Drank my quota of water for the first time!  I decided to up my estimate on the shrimp salad by double.  I want to make sure I'm not scrimping on the olive oil, which I use in the dressing and also to sautee the shrimp. Even so, look at this incredible total today - 916 calories. That's fantastic, because I'm full, I ate really wonderful meals today, I'm not suffering at all.  I don't understand some of the online food diaries I saw; all they eat are pre-packaged frozen meals. I guess because it's easy, and it's easy to track because the numbers are all there for you, but it's such unattractive food, to me.  You can eat a MUCH larger volume of food with fresh vegetables, and it's so much more delicious. Of course, I have the time to shop and cook right now, and it's nearly impossible to eat healthy when you're working full time, so I guess there's a place for these things.  I'm going to make sure I'm really careful about my estimates. I mean, I have been, I have been consistently estimating large, and I don't think there is any significant amount of food I've left out. I'm sure I've missed a condiment here and there, although not many, because I've been scrupulous in charting this. But I was watching Oprah today, and she said something interesting about keeping to a diet/plan: she said "Don't do it if you're going to lie to yourself. Because you know you're lying, and you feel just like someone else does when you lie to them."  It was a good point.  I've been completely honest in here, even when I so want to cheat, because there's just no point otherwise.  I've been really tempted to cheat on recording how much I'm drinking, and haven't even allowed myself that out. So I guess I'm just recommitting myself to this, re-promising that I'm not going to lie to myself.

       6:21 a.m. Sunday, Day 21.  Last day  of Week Three!  Hoping for a better day than yesterday. Although, my total wasn't that awful yesterday, considering the physical activity, and also, as Bucko pointed out, having given blood a couple days ago.  Not that he knows about my "diet," but he did mention something about my doing too much work and not eating enough to recover from it.  I don't know if that's true, that a person would need extra food or rest, but I'm going to allow myself the excuse and treat it as a legitimate reason. And, I didn't have some kind of major pig-out yesterday, it's still a normal amount of food to eat, it's just not within my goal numbers.  At this point, I still have 3080 calories left in the oppw goal.  Unlikely I will eat that much today, so I am still on target.  Today we have to take the truck back, sometime before noon. If we are smart, we will stop at the grocery store also, because we're a little low on food.  9:32 a.m.  My "regular" jeans might be a little looser.  Tried them on fresh from the dryer, and didn't have any struggle buttoning them.  Maybe I can use that as a yardstick also, because I'm pretty sure I used to pull on them harder to get them closed. So that will be another minor measurement milestone: at the end of Week Three, I could button my regular jeans without pulling hard.  I need to make sure I stay on target today. Not so much that I don't have any leeway, because I do, but to make sure I don't lose momentum after yesterday.   6:53 p.m.  Had to move over to the PC, since geek boy is on the Mac. Dinner was very good on the numbers, considering how much I ate!  A huge meal, but all vegetables and fish.  Baked sweet potato, broiled stuffed zucchini (stuffed with other vegetables), and steamed sugar snap peas.  Delicious. I had to use the numbers for grouper, tilapia wasn't in the book. I had too big of a portion, 8 ounces uncooked.  I should eat two-thirds or half of that.  I'm still at a good total — 1351 if I don't eat anything else today.  I doubt I will, it's already almost 7:00.  Having a glass of raspberry seltzer water.  The type of food I'm eating has had a big effect on my total calories for the day. Sometimes I eat a fairly large amount of food (volume wise) and I'm surprised that it comes out at 1300 or so calories. It's because the vegetables have so few calories compared to meat, and certainly a lot less than cheese or butter.

       7:21 a.m. Saturday, Day 20.  Two more days in Week Three.  Hoping they'll go better than yesterday, so I end up with good numbers for the week. Yesterday was my worst eating day. Of course it was Drinking Night, which really pushed up the calories, but also I did some snacking on cheese after dinner, something I haven't done since this started.  I was able to stop before I really regretted it, but I did realize it was unmindful eating and a dangerous activity.  That's how you start eating and keep on going and going.  And as before, I'm relieved that my numbers aren't worse.  I'm still keeping it pretty well under control even when I think I've gone over the line.  At the end of the week I'll analyze everything, but I think I see a pattern that there will be one day a week when I go over my numbers.  The other six days vary; sometimes I'm higher than I like but still under the goal. It's just that one day I'm over, and so far it seems to be Friday. Hmm.  Slept AWFUL last night — no doubt because of the wine. The red kills me.  And today we are loading the truck and hauling our crap to the dump, so I'll be doing it on 4 hours of sleep. Bah!  Had a little extra breakfast to energize me — three crackers and peanut butter.  I must point out that peanut butter is VERY high in calories. There's no sane amount of it you can eat.  But, I'm going to need energy today, so don't be surprised if a few more get entered into the chart.  10:09 a.m. Well, instead of more crackers, I ate a giant muffin from the grocery store.  I'll have to look it up, but I'm thinking 400 calories minimum. Sigh. Sure was delicious, though.  2:41 p.m. OMG, I'm at 1093 calories already, and haven't eaten dinner yet. It's the damn muffins. But, as disappointed as I am with the count, I'm not despairing, because we worked HARD today.  Loading logs onto a truck — that's heavy duty calorie burning.  So I'm not going to be too hard on myself; you need fuel to do that kind of physical activity. Muffins aren't the best choice of fuel, but that's what's available in the supermarket at 8 in the morning. So, I'll "forgive" myself and move on.  I am interested to try on the Measurement Pants in a few days, because this morning I put on what I thought were my "tight" jeans, and they seem awfully loose.  So that has rekindled some hope, maybe I really was just bloated when I tried the Pants last.  I'm going to wait until my period is good and over before I try them again.

       7:23 a.m. Friday, Day 19.  Can you believe — only two more days left in WEEK THREE?  So yesterday's eating wasn't as bad as I feared.  I expected a whopper total because of the sandwich and pizza, but when I add it up it's actually pretty good. I estimated big on those items, too.  Apparently I compensated with dinner, because that grilled shrimp salad is very low on the cals.  Also, I kept it to ONE piece of pizza, and didn't just keep eating and keep eating, which is what I felt like doing.  Man, what a hard habit to break.  So anyway, my totals ended up good, I'm completely on track, and glad yesterday is over.    I have a GIANT bruise on my arm this morning. A little souvenir.  I'm still feeling a bit aimless because of lack of visible progress.  Must keep pep-talking myself to get through a month.  I think that's the minimum fair amount of time to try this.  It freaks me out when I see other people losing 4 and 5 pounds in their first week, and I don't seem to have lost 4 pounds in three weeks. But, as always, I can't really tell whether that's true.  Is it completely idiotic that I don't have a scale?  I guess so, if I want to know my weight so badly.  It's just that I thought the Measurement Pants would work, and either they're not working or I have gained weight.  Haven't started my period yet, not surprising since I'm so irregular now, but I want it over so I can try the Pants again.  9:51 a.m.  40 minutes on the glider. Not bad.  I haven't been able to do the 60 minutes that I reached a couple times before, although I think I have been letting myself off the hook somewhat because of boredom.  Need to be a little firmer with myself.

       7:44 a.m. Wednesday Day 17.  Feeling a little more optimistic today.  After the disappointment of the Measurement Pants, it's hard to pick myself up again, but I'm not ready to give up.  Still looking for some inspirational websites. Also not reading NAAFA anymore.  Well, actually I had given that up a long time ago. I agree with the fat acceptance idea, but on that site there's too much personal bickering and in-fighting.  I want a site that promotes both weight loss and fat acceptance.  That's almost impossible to find, apparently the ideas are mutually exclusive in most people's minds. But I have to credit the NAAFA board, that's where I first heard about Poundy. Someone posted with that very request, and someone else suggested her site.  10:20 a.m. I finally did some SensibleGym!  Good for me. Didn't do any glider, but I think I'll get plenty of exercise today - we're planning on cutting down the last tree this afternoon. Fun fun fun.  Very hungry, I'm having some water to stave it off.  I'm trying to eat light today so I can have pizza tonight.  Just put some chicken in the oven so I will have lunch today. As always, a lot of drinking on Drinking Night.  Keeping track of it has really shown me how much we're consuming.  I so want to cheat on reporting it, because I'm ashamed of it, but I won't let myself do that because I don't want to hide the calories.  7:56 p.m.  Today went perfectly according to plan.  I ate lightly throughout the day, and for dinner I managed to restrain myself with the pizza - only ate two pieces.  I don't know the exact calories, but I used the figures for three slices of Pizza Hut italian sausage.  That seems reasonable.  I'm so pleased with it, I'm having a little more sake!  I am only at 1729, which is well within oppw, astounding for a pizza day.  It was really the orange juice that killed me - I knew I shouldn't drink it, but the pizza was so spicy I needed something. Damn, that stuff is killer - 110 calories in one glass.  At least it's nutritious, no-sugar-added OJ.

       6:27 a.m. Thursday Day 18.  Very sore this morning from SensibleGym yesterday. I will try to glide early, so I can shower and go to the lecture at the art museum. I'm kind of forcing myself to do it, but I imagine I'll enjoy it once I get there. I've become a real hermit the past couple weeks.  I've been waiting for Daisy to help me with my cover letter to G.McN., and I don't think she's going to do it.  I can't fault her, she's got problems of her own right now, but I'm feeling pressured to get it out and do something.  Our money situation is depressing as hell, and I am becoming frightened that there's no way I can ever quit my miserable job. I've been dreaming that I'm going to be so successful as an artist that I can make my living that way, but looking over our expenditures recently, there's no way.    I'm looking at some of the online food diaries that a lot of people have.  From the three or so I read, they seem to be eating in the 1100-1300 calorie range.  I'm worried that I need to hit this a little harder than I am, because I'm not sure I can do it.  On the other hand, and I have several hands to mention here, I'm adjusting pretty well to this amount of food, where it seems almost normal now, so perhaps I will dig up the wherewithal to cut down some more. My other-other hand is that I'm not entirely sure I believe their entries.  I know, that's cynical and rude and probably a big fat lie I'm telling myself, but there's just not enough food listed, and they're such compact entries that I'm wondering if they're estimating and rounding off a bit too much.  Maybe I'm kidding myself.  I don't list everything individually, I combine the total ingredients into the calories for a serving. That doesn't mean I'm not doing it carefully and thoroughly.  This is the thing that confounds me about weight loss, and confounded me the last time I tried to do a formal diet.  If I eat X amount of calories and maintain my weight, then if I reduce by Y number of calories, I should lose Z number of pounds. No matter what X equals.  I mean, suppose I was eating 5000 calories a day, and maintaining my weight. Then I cut by 500 a day for a total of 4500 calories a day. I should then lose a pound a week, even at an outrageous 4500 calories.  So my point is, if my current "diet" calories per day is higher than the standard, it shouldn't make any difference so long as it's 500 calories less than the amount I was eating to maintain my weight. And it damn sure is.  See, once again I'm insisting that this follow the rules of logic that I have set forth.  And that lets me get into such denial.  It lets me say, "this can't work, therefore it's a waste of time to do it."  Which, come to think of it, is pretty sound reasoning.  But the thing I finally realized, two and a half weeks ago, is that it doesn't matter if it's fair or logical.  If I have to go to 1100 calories, that's what I have to do.  If I have to go to 800, that's what I have to do.  Yes, it is horrible and stupid and unfair and unreasonable and sucks giant ass, but there is no other option at this point in science.  I have to give this a chance.  It's only been two and a half weeks.  I need to go at least a month to see if it's working. Then I can reconsider whether it's worth continuing at the same level, whether I need to reduce further, or whether it makes more sense to ditch the plan.  I want to point out, though, that I have also significantly increased my exercise. I'm not depending solely on dieting to achieve this weight loss.  I write about the dieting more because I hate it more. And it lasts all day long, every day.  You have to constantly think about it and constantly control your behavior.  With exercise, once you do it, it's done. Poof. Nothing to talk about.  7:51 a.m.  Just did 30 minutes on the glider, and I'm taking a break.  More from boredom than fatigue.  Also I need to figure out if I have time for another half hour.  If I want to get to the museum at 10:15, I need to leave here at 9:45, so I need to be in the shower at 8:45.  So yeah, I guess I have time, if I don't take a long break.  8:25 a.m. Put in another 15 minutes, I think that's all I can handle today.  I'm thinking about a piece of pizza for lunch, so maybe I can get more energy this afternoon and work off some of it.  3:15 p.m.  What a day!!  I'm worn right out.  The museum was great, had a nice time. Then I decided to give blood, since they're so low recently (the Red Cross, not the art museum). I made an appointment and then had to kill time for and hour and a half, so I went to the bank, got a sandwich at the grocery store for lunch (will have to estimate), and picked up videos.  I considered and rejected several restaurants, because I didn't think I could get a reasonable meal at them, and thought I'd pick up sushi at the deli of the supermarket. Unfortunately, they don't have it anymore.  The only good options was a ham sandwich.  I mean, it could have been a lot worse.  So I get points for making a pretty good choice in a poor situation.  Plus I had a large water with it.  Anyway, when I gave blood, it took forever. My blood was draining really slowly, and the nurse was wiggling the needle around and thumping my arm, and I was squeezing my hand, etc., and it got to be really painful!  Not to mention I was in the chair for 20 or 30 minutes, and the nurse was kind of mean.  When it was finally over, I felt a bit lightheaded, which has never happened to me before. I toddled over to the snack and drink table, sat down, and started crying!  It was SO embarrassing.  There was a really sweet boy, couldn't have been more than 24, who talked to me very casually for a few minutes about his bad experiences, and it made me feel much better.  I was really impressed with how well he dealt with the situation, very mature and capable, and did just what would make me feel better without overplaying his hand.  What a good boy. However, as soon as he left, I was on the verge of crying again, so I left as soon as I could, and sat in my car for a while.  Damn.  I'm pretty sure I'm going to have a piece of pizza to console myself.  Yeah, it's emotional eating, there's no doubt of that. But can I cut myself some slack once in a while? I gave blood, dammit!

       6:50 a.m. Tuesday, Day 16.  Feeling a little discouraged this morning.  I'm pretty sure it's because I don't have a good visible proof of progress.  I know, I'm not doing the scale, but I want something to go on.  I want a little reward to keep me interested and motivated. The Measurement Pants were a disappointment when I tried them a couple days ago.  I wanted to see a big difference.  I will succumb and try them on again today.   And what is it recently with all these weight-loss programs on TV?  I'm sure some of it is attributable to being January, but there are just so many.  It's like there must be some government grant money that came out this year. Well, more likely it's different networks trying to cash in on the success of Dr. Phil's whatever program. I just don't like the overemphasis.  It's been developing over a period of a year or two, though.  All the makeover shows are about losing weight, there's SO many shows about WLS and liposuction...  as though obesity is the ONLY health problem worth notice.  And don't tell me people are motivated for health concerns, that's bullshit.  Maybe some, but the average person who wants to lose 20 to 30 pounds is in it for the relief from societal pressure.  And the women are also in it for the fashion/beauty aspect.  That sounds cynical, and I guess I don't mean that everyone, including myself, is uncaring of the health aspects, just that the other reasons are much much stronger.  Like, I want to regain the mobility I've lost from being fat, because my life would be a lot easier and more enjoyable. But that's not the main reason. No, I want to LOOK good.  Anyway, I cannot tolerate the Discovery Health channel.  It's nothing but weight-loss stories, and they send a lot of messages I don't like. They're forever saying things like "Tracy wanted a new hairstyle to match her new life," and "Now Rhonda could let her real self shine."  No, fuck you.  Tracy and Rhonda are the same people they always were. They're just thinner. That's it, just thinner. If they were assholes when fat, they're assholes now.  It they are brilliant and talented now, they were just as much so when they were fat. Yeah, you can experience a big change by going through the weight loss process — the discipline, the strength, the entire emotional and physical experience of it.  But being skinny, by itself, is not going to change you.  And something else I don't like — this big push for WLS.  That shit is dangerous.  It's a very extreme "treatment," and I don't think it should be encouraged and advertised like this.  There are many serious risks and side effects.  One of which, perhaps the least life-threatening, is that when people lose weight that quickly, they are left with enormous bags of loose skin hanging off their bodies. If they expect to have anything like a normal life after the weight loss, they will absolutely need more surgeries to fix that.  Maybe people consider that a reasonable trade-off, but I don't think there's enough attention paid to the long-term involvement — it's not just a simple one-day surgery and then you're done.  8:54 a.m. 40 minutes on the glider. Rubber legs. Feeling a little down about my chances — watched the Dr. Phil show and saw all the people who had lost 60 and 80 pounds, and feeling like it will never happen for me.  Like I was writing earlier, I have no proof that this is working.  I so much hate the idea of a scale, though, and checking every two minutes.  Maybe I can get through this week without freaking out, and then can consider some sort of measurement system.  I want to give this long enough to work, to actually get those measurable results.  9:57 a.m.  The Measurement Pants were a great disappointment.  They are actually tighter than two days ago.  I know I haven't gained weight — I mean, how could I?  (OMG, what if I have???)  It occurred to me maybe I'm retaining water or whatever. Sure enough, consulting the calendar I saw that I'm 2-7 days before my period, so probably I am a little bloated, as well as possibly a little cranky.  Although, I'm not as unhappy as my writing sounds, I just like to complain in here.  I should probably ignore the Measurement Pants until after.  2:30 p.m. Just got home from the E.G. and I'm SO hungry.  Going to have some chicken, but drinking water first.  I'm a little dehydrated, plus it's filling. Stopped at Wal-Mart and bought another pair of jeans (size 26) and a light sweater.  If the jeans become too big (cross my fingers), so what, it was only $11.  In the meantime, I need some more clothes.  5:44 p.m.  So far have resisted the temptation to pig out.  Today has been iffy.  In Wal-Mart and the wine store I really had to resist the temptation to get some chocolate. And when I got home, the cheese in the frig was tempting. When I put the chicken in the oven tonight I really wanted to keep the skin. I even told myself I could have ONE skin, but at the last minute I managed to throw it away.  Must be the pre-period thing.  I am semi-planning to have pizza tomorrow night, so I will try (try, I say) to eat lightly tomorrow to compensate.  The fish soup is pretty light in calories for being so filling, so maybe I'll depend on that.  Tonight, sushi tuna and chicken caesar salad, which should end up very light also. Hopefully that will keep the week reasonable.  Yesterday was low as hell — 1154!  That's some serious dieting.  Is it too much? Who knows.  However, I want to note and compliment my ability to pass up the chocolate and cheese.  I am truly astounded that I'm able to do that.  It's just that in the last couple days I've felt that I'm going to drop the ball any minute, that it's just a matter of holding out as long as possible but that eventually I won't be able to take it any more.  I'm really glad I tried the Measurement Pants, which led to checking the calendar, because I am almost certain I can attribute this to my particular hormonal state.

       6:41 a.m. Monday, Day 15.  The first day of Week Three!  So. Last week went VERY well.  Yesterday was amazing in terms of calories.  Since we had raw fish and soup for dinner, the calorie count was very low, even with the drinks we had. Awesome.  My average calories per day in Week One was 1660. For Week Two, 1487. That's 173 calories less!  I don't think I'll be getting much lower than that, but we'll see.  I have to take this a bit at a time.  However, I would like a pizza or something like that the end of this week, so I might try to go a bit low to compensate in advance for that.  OK, let's look at theoretical weight loss.  According to the numbers, I lost one pound, with 2201 calories left over. That should be about six-tenths of a pound.  So let's call it a pound and a half. My weight at the end of Week One was 258.75, so my new weight is 257.25.  That leaves 23.25 pounds left of my initial goal (26 pounds), to weigh 234.  If I go at the same rate, that will take about 15 weeks. So not bad!  Damn, this has been going well.  It's almost too easy now, and I keep checking my charts to make sure I'm not slipping and eating a bunch and then just telling myself I'm on a diet.  But no.  I'm recording everything I eat:  I've cut my portions down by a third. I've all but eliminated between-meal snacks. I've cut my breakfast calories in half.  There's a real difference here from the way I ate before.  So this week, I want to do two things. One, get on the ball with the water drinking.  That did NOT go well last week.  Two, do a SensibleGym workout twice.  I need to make sure I do some strength training.  8:52 a.m.  Did 30 minutes on the Glider.  If all goes according to plan, I will do SensibleGym later. Feeling a bit peckish already, but not surprising since I got up so early (6:00). Also would like to congratulate myself again for getting through TWO WEEKS.  And doing a damned fine job.  10:04 a.m.  So hungry I had to have a bowl of soup.  Not bored-hungry, but stomach-hurt, might-vomit, can't-keep-my-body-warm hungry. And it was delicious.  I feel very unmotivated today, very aimless. Probably because I haven't worked in so long.  I need to use this time for painting and advancing myself that way.  Brain is not working right now, so I will go clean up my studio.  12:25 p.m. Well, I did a little of both. Cleaned the studio, and started a draft of the letter. Emailed it to Daisy for input. I'm going to try to do another 30 minutes of glider before I have lunch.  2:03.  Did the 30 minute glide.  Small late lunch, because of the large morning snack. Still feeling rather unmotivated. I know I should do some more pages for the sample book I'm trying to put together, but not very energetic.  5:18 p.m.  I don't really know what I've done since 2.  Packed up some computer manuals, but that's all I remember!  I am SO hungry.  I'm making chicken for dinner (chicken sandwiches) and it was all I could do to save it for the meal.  I'm having a glass of tomato juice and writing in here to keep my mind off. Looking at my chart, I'm only at 543 calories before the juice, so maybe I just haven't eaten enough today.  I really hate this about dieting, it's hard to know or remember what normal eating is like.  I'm starting to get used to this amount of food, so if I eat what I ate last week, it feels like "too much."  Like I'm not dieting enough, because now it seems normal.  Grrr.  Dieting is fucked up.  Doing a little better with water, though not where I should be. Oh wait, now I remember what I did this afternoon — a little logo project.  That must have taken an hour and a half.

       8:08 a.m. Sunday, Day 14.  The last day of Week Two!  At the end of the day I'll do a big recap of all my calories and theoretical pounds.  In the meantime, all is going well.  I succumbed to the potato chips last night, but I very cleverly shared them with Bucko, so it was not a giant impact on the diet.  Good thinking. We're planning on grocery shopping this morning, and I'm all into that.  I think that's where the anxiety and need-to-eat is coming from, the lack of food in the house.  I'm still not sure about my numbers — how much I should eat to lose x amount of weight. But if I go by the rule that 3500 calories = one pound, then I think I'm well in the range of oppw.  I'm sure I've cut 500 calories a day from my diet. Maybe even more, on a day-by-day basis.  Went back to chicken and rice soup today, with a dollop of mashed potatoes. Not bad.  10:02 a.m. I just had to go and try on the Measurement Pants.  They seem about the same as last time — I can button and zip them, but they're too tight to wear.  I'm disappointed, I was hoping for a more noticeable difference.  I want to think they were the tiniest bit looser than last week, but it's too subjective to tell. I really want some sort of visible, measurable proof of progress so I don't lose motivation.  As always in the past, I can't keep this up if it isn't doing anything. Don't worry, I'm not quitting today, I'm just whining a bit. I have made progress, I can't deny the Pants.  Also, I have to remember I just tried them on 4 days ago. Somehow I thought it was over the weekend, but looking through my journal, it was on Wednesday. Therefore, Wednesday is now Measurement Pants day, not Sunday.  12:38 p.m. Finished lunch of chicken, leftover mashed potatoes, and beet salad. A little hard to estimate on the beet salad, but the only significant ingredient was the low fat mayo, so I won't stress over it.  We did a large shopping and have lots of food in the house.  Tuna, catfish, and shrimp. Also more chicken, of course, and tons of vegetables, fresh, frozen, and canned. I am still craving sweets; it was very difficult to pass them up at the grocery store. Haven't had anything sweet for two weeks, why is it hitting me  now?  Did something trigger it?  I wish I could have just a tiny piece of chocolate, but that probably wouldn't solve it, it probably would just reinforce the craving.  Must keep my mind off it and do something today.  2:35 p.m.  I wish I could find a weight loss site that I liked!  Poundy was perfect, but she's not blogging the weight anymore.  It's just that most sites are too anti-fat, and the body positive sites are too pro-fat.  I mean, I want to lose weight. I want to lose.  And the bp sites are filled with people saying "I can't lose weight" or "I won't lose weight" or "I don't want to lose weight."  So, how likely is it that they are going to lose weight? Right, zero.  But some weight loss sites are a little too nasty and righteous.  I won't buy into self-loathing. Can a person be seriously interested - and dedicated - to losing weight without hating herself?  It's as though if you desire to change, that means the current self is bad.  Damn, it doesn't have to be that way.  Can't I just say my current self is wonderful, and lost-weight-self will be just as wonderful but fit into an airplane seat better?  It's a matter of good and good, not bad and good.  Losing the weight should be an accomplishment, not an identity.  You're not bad for being fat, and you're not good for losing weight.  It's like learning another language. You weren't an evil asshat before you learned it, but it's a useful and desirable thing to do.  I'm going to figure out something to watch and glide for 30 minutes. I know, I could watch the 30 minute glider tape workout.  Also making fish stew for dinner, that's going to be hard to calculate the calories.  It's all vegetables and fish, no milk or butter.  I think I will use the numbers for Campbell's Manhattan clam chowder, that should be reasonably close.

       11:07 a.m. Saturday, Day 13.  Almost done Week Two!  Last night did not go well, I drank a great deal and had a rib.  Well, the rib was in the plan, but not that much drinking.  Isn't it tiresome writing about how much I drank and feeling contrite?  Bah.  Either stop doing it, or stop caring that you're doing it.  At any rate, I showed a great deal of restraint with the rest of the day, plus exercised for 90 minutes, so I officially declare that the day went OK.  It is not a smudge on my record.  Made some great mashed potatoes with no milk or butter, just a wee bit of olive oil and a small carton of unflavored no-fat yogurt.  Curry and thyme. Perfect.  Today I slept until 10:30.  Half the day is over already.  4:03 p.m. Haven't done a damn thing today.  At least I'm keeping the eating under control, considering how bored I am.  I ALMOST ate the little bag of chips. Took it out of the pantry and looked at the label — 260 calories. Not a good deal. Impressed that I was able to resist. I guess I'm going to make chicken for dinner.  If I take the skin off, I can have three drumsticks. Maybe will have cauliflower, not sure. MUST go shopping tomorrow morning, we're on our last legs.  Had minestrone soup for breakfast this morning, and must say I didn't care for it.  I don't think I'll keep the leftover half for tomorrow, I'll just toss it and go back to chicken and rice. So much for experimentation...    Looking back over my entries, things are going quite well.  I almost feel like I'm not doing enough, because really I've had good meals and little hunger. It doesn't feel like a "diet."  That's the idea, I guess. I just hope it's enough. I don't think I can stand the idea of a typical diet. You know, for breakfast oatmeal, half a cup of skim milk, 6 oz orange juice. Lunch: 4 oz lean chicken breast no skin, five green beans, two carrot rounds. Snack: low-fat yogurt.  Bah!  No normal person can live on that. I'm toying with the idea of a juicy greasy meal to celebrate getting through two weeks, but I'm not sure that makes sense.  It might be better to save that for when I have a really big craving, than to use it as a reward.  I'm thinking pizza.  I'll think of something else to celebrate the two weeks. Which should be, by the way, between two and four pounds. I wish it would be five pounds.  Five pounds in two weeks, yes I can handle that. That's a livable rate, enough progress to keep me motivated. Two pounds? Eh. That's the size of a large bowel movement.  Well, OK, I don't actually know how much a large bowel movement weighs, but you get my point.  It's too little to know whether it's a real loss or a momentary fluctuation. But FIVE pounds, that's a real number. That's solid. And that would mean ten pounds in a month, which is significant.  If my numbers are at all accurate, I don't think I'll achieve that. So I'm going to go with what my numbers say, erring on the more-lost side because of all the exercise I've been doing, and rely on my Measurement Pants. I'll keep pretend track of my weight until (and if) I get a scale.  One reason I don't want a scale is the compulsion to check it three times a day.  It probably doesn't make sense to weigh yourself more than twice a month, if that often. You can't look for those kind of quick results, it's a long-term thing. Man, talk about tedious. This is a goal that will take me over a year to achieve, and it will require CONSTANT attention. But, here's something interesting. I read on the Dr. Phil page that food cravings and overeating usually occur within a very small window of time.  Like, there's a particular time of day or situation where this happens, it's not a constant all-day thing.  So if you can get over that hump, you only have to resist for a few minutes at a time.  I'm finding that's true; when I get a craving to eat, it will go away in a few minutes.  The trick is to delay the gratification, and then you have the power to control it.  5:47 p.m.  Put the chicken and sweet potatoes in the oven and did 30 minutes on the glider. Rubber legs.  There's a sideways move that's really hard.  I can feel it in my entire butt.  In other news, I don't think the seltzer is giving me a headache. Either that or I've become accustomed to it. That's good news, because obviously it's hard for me to drink enough water.  I'm wondering if that headache was from de-sugaring myself.  I haven't had anything sweet (except for apples) for two weeks! In the same self-congratulatory vein, I spread that Quiznoids sandwich over three meals, instead of my customary two. AND didn't eat the chips.  I'm really surprising myself with what I'm able to do.  There have been a few days where it's been hard, but nothing all that terrible.  I think it was clever of me to think of the soup for lunch, because that's a giant savings in calories that's pretty easy to achieve.  I'm hungry in the morning, but my taste buds aren't really awake, it's the least important meal to me emotionally. I'm just starting to get tired of soup, so when I go shopping I'll look for some different kinds, and damn the cost.  Because it's not that much.  I'm spending $1.29 to $1.79 per can, and it lasts me two days.  So I think I can afford to splurge and get a $2.09 can once in a while.  Also I'm impressed with how little snacking I've done.  My original plan allowed for both morning and afternoon snacks, and I haven't been eating them.  I think two days I had an afternoon snack, and once in the morning.

       6:59 a.m. Friday Day 12.  Almost done Week Two!  It's gone really well.  I've only been at tppw one day, but I've been well under oppw every day.  And hopefully, because I estimate large, and exercise a lot, I'm really doing better than oppw.  I don't FEEL any thinner, so I'll have to rely on Measurement Pants as a guide.  I'm planning on trying them on Mondays.    Yesterday's food was hard to estimate.  I get very different results from the Netzer book and the calorie council online calculator.  I find myself wanting to check both and use the lowest count.  The Netzer book is a lot more complete — the calculator only shows calories and fat — so I will use it as my main source and use the calculator for backup when I can't find it in Netzer. Although, I've had my doubts about Netzer before, because she shows broccoli as being 20% fat, and that seems unlikely.  Now tonight is Drinking Night, so I have to do two things: 1. drink moderately (not likely) and 2. go light on the food to compensate.  That will be a little hard; I've got ribs and quiznoids in the house for lunch today.  Better try for an extra good glider workout to offset.  I really need to go shopping and get some good food in the house.  I have chicken in the freezer, and a cauliflower, and that's it for the healthy stuff. Tomorrow we'll be eating crap.  It's supposed to snow today, which means the stores will be insane right now.  I'm kind of considering waiting until it actually does snow, because everyone will be off the roads then.  Had some desire to snack last night.  I think it was boredom or restlessness.  I've spent a lot of time in the house lately and starting to feel a little cooped up.  I got a lot of stuff done, though, so it hasn't been useless.  7:59 a.m. Gross, it is snowing!  Yuck.  However, for the very first time ever I don't have to go to an important appointment, such as an interview, during the snow.  It hardly ever snows here, and every single time I end up having to go out in it. Today, gonna stay home and be cozy.  9:37 a.m.  Just did 30 minutes on the glider and I'm exhausted!!  I'm going to finish out the hour, but probably will be moving at a crawl.  I need to do some research and find out if it's useful to do this, or if I'm better off ending after 30.  10:38 Finished out the hour. My legs are like jelly. Or possibly pudding.  I am feeling very peckish today.  Had a little lettuce salad and am drinking more water, but I'm disturbed about this.  I'm getting that panicky feeling and wanting to eat a whole bunch.  Not sure why, because I've been doing so well.  Is it from being snowbound?  Is it from being almost out of food?  If so, I need to quell that idea, because there's plenty of food in the house.  There's enough ribs left for another meal, I have 2/3 of a quiznoids sandwich, there's a large package of chicken drumsticks, and we have a TON of frozen vegetables. Also several veggie burritos I made last week for Bucko's lunch.  AND red potatoes and canned beans, beets, and spinach.  Also cauliflower, carrots, onion, and celery.  OK, brain?  Do you get it now?  There's plenty of food. Plenty.  Maybe I'm stressing about work.  I won't be having a paycheck this month, so we're getting pretty broke.  There's plenty in savings, but I hate going into that. But perhaps I need to remind myself that this is what the money is for, to get us over a lean time. And apparently they are NOT shutting down, and they ARE planning work for me. Nothing has changed, it's just a little slow right now. That's what part-time is about.  So have I allayed my fears at all?  Not quite.  I'm also a little nervous about moving and going to Tahiti.  They are both expensive and scary, and I've been dealing with both recently.  So maybe I'm wanting to eat for comfort and security.  Probably a little boredom too, from being house bound. Damn, I hope I've shown some significant weight loss this week, because I need something to keep my spirits up.  Also maybe I'm just being hard on myself.  So I'm not super motivated today, take it easy.  You know what it is, I really want to get through two weeks without "cheating" on the diet.  I want to prove to myself that I can do this.  I really hate the idea that I'm too weak to manage a moderate, self-imposed regimen. And I hate the way I'll lie to myself and rationalize in order to pretend (to myself!) that I'm telling the truth.  So far I've put everything I've eaten, and drank, in here.  There were several times I came close to not recording the whole truth, and managed to resist the temptation.  I still feel guilty for even considering it.  This might be a really useful tool for me (the journal, not guilt).  It's as though keeping this journal can actually help prevent me from eating, rather than just record what I eat.  As long as I'm too stubborn or embarrassed or guilty or whatever it takes to cheat, then I'll stay on the diet in order to avoid the bad feelings.  Now, see, isn't that fucked up?  That's what a diet is about.  No matter how much I need to do this, and no matter how much or little success I have with it, nobody is going to convince me that this isn't sick, obsessive behavior. The diet, that is.  I'm deliberately creating in myself the same eating disorder that other people spend years of therapy trying to remove. Gah.  12:09 p.m.  Cut myself some slack and had lunch early.  Another third of the sub and the rest of the delicious clam chowder, plus a very small glass of wine. Man, I really need to find something to do this afternoon, or I'll be wanting to snack again.  Maybe I can glide some more!  1:58 p.m.  Did another 30 minutes on the glider.  Can hardly walk. However... I don't think I got my heart rate going very much.  I didn't use the workout tape that comes with, I just did a medium glide for 30 minutes.  It might not be quite enough work.  Again, I figure it can't hurt, because I'm burning calories, right?  I think.  I need some research on this.  On a different train of thought, I sure hope I'm overestimating on those ribs, because that's what we're having for dinner and I'm already at 700 calories after lunch.  I only have 600 left for tppw, and just one of those ribs is over that. Plus drinking night.  Well, that's why I did more gliding, but this is the first day since Day One that I'm having trouble staying with it.  Maybe I'm being unrealistic about how few calories I can eat — when I look at my charts, I'm not eating a large amount of food, they're quite reasonable meals. I can't tell if ending up with close to 2000 calories today is rationalizing and allowing myself to fall off the horse, or if it's simply a realistic give-and-take with any diet.  It's so messed up to have to think this way!  Okay, I looked back over my charts, and notice that I'm eating about 200-300 calories fewer each day than last week.  So I'm doing GREAT and can relax a little bit.  I'm not giving up or cheating or whatever just because today's calories are higher than yesterday's.  They're still within my goal and very reasonable. I notice also that I started the week a little too gung-ho about beating last week and doing this thing to death.  I've been hungry a few days and that's a bad scenario — that's what causes bingeing on bad food.  So I just need to be chill until I get to the supermarket. In the meantime, I'm going to go cut up some celery and carrots to have with hummus, and get the chicken defrosted. And all the exercise I'm doing is keeping my metabolism up, building muscles in my legs, and burning the hell out of those calories. So lighten up.  3:54 p.m.  Having some lovely red wine.  Bucko's coming home early because of the snow, so we can have a fire and eat the ribs and be cozy. Watched the video of Travis's graduation party from last June, and I'm HORRIFIED at how I look.  I am HUGE. HUGE. And I have no neck anymore.  Gaaah.  I'm not entirely depressed about it though, because I feel like I'm doing something about it.  OMG, I hope this works.  If it doesn't, then there's just nothing that will, and that's a very frightening thought. OK, I won't think that way.  I will get through this week, I will try on the Measurement Pants Monday, and I will find that I've lost more weight. I will continue with the diet and exercise, losing more and more weight, until I am where I want to be.  Yes, that's what will happen.  One of the things I want most about losing weight is being able to buy clothes. I've never been all that interested in them (possibly because of my weight) and I think it would be just wonderful to go into a store and buy what I WANT, instead of the one thing in the whole store that will fit me. It would be so cool to feel like I look NORMAL.  I'm old enough now that I don't have to be gorgeous, I don't have to prove myself that way (I think), but it would be nice to feel like I'm not a freak.  At least I don't act like one — I don't think I behave the way other fat women do.  Well, fuck it, let's not go there.  I don't want to spend time on negativity and regrets.  Oh please please please let this work!

       7:11 a.m. Thursday Day 11.  Did very well yesterday, especially considering the giantness of the rib.  I started stressing out a little this morning, whilst still in bed, thinking about having a rib again for lunch (my normal pattern, to eat leftovers for lunch) because it's so many calories.  I've been eating 400-ish calories for lunch, not 700!  But I think I'm over it.  I don't want to live the kind of life where I have to be unhappy and worried about the food.  I have to consider it, because otherwise I'll end up back where I started, but instead of not eating, I can offset it with exercise.  It's not like I'm ordering up a whole large pizza myself, it's just one rib.    10:39 a.m.  Oh!  I am exhausted.  I just did the 30-minute workout that came with the glider, and it was killer.  I'm rubber-legged.  That was more work than my usual 60-minute workout, which is exactly the results I was hoping for. It took me an hour and a half to set the machine up.  It's heavy, and seems sturdy.  Hopefully Bucko will take a look at it and see if it seems right.  I don't know where we can put it when we're selling the house!  1:06 p.m.  Just finished giant lunch of pork rib and black bean salad. Heaven.  I want to congratulate myself for not eating any rib when we got home from Man Bites Ass theater last night.  I was tempted, because they're so full of tasty greasy goodness, and I went so far as to open the refrigerator door and stare at it.  I think what finally stopped me was the idea of having to write it in here.  That makes the calories more real; I can't pretend I didn't really eat it or that it wasn't "that much."  On another subject, Man Bites Dog theater was disappointing. It was comedy improv night, and apparently they are known for drama improv.  I dunno, it just didn't engage me. I'd like to go back some time when they're doing drama.  I do think the Netzer book is a little high on the calories for the rib.  I couldn't find it online, but they did show six spareribs as being less than 400 cals.  Not sure how that relates to the cut of meat I had.  So I'm going to go with 703 and not indulge in too much wishful thinking.  Finished painting half the bathroom; will finish the other half after I've digested a little.  7:26 p.m.  Taking a break from packing up stuff in the guest room closet.  Carrying down the stairs is getting tiring.  Did well with dinner; we got Quiznos and I ate about a third of the sandwich instead of half. Also only half the soup and no chips.  I'll have to figure out the calories more precisely tomorrow; I got the turkey guacamole sub, which is the same as their low-fat turkey sub only with guac.  So I think I can use the stats from their website on the low-fat turkey and estimate the guacamole.  Tomorrow I'll look in the Netzer book. So far it's looking good even considering the rib, because I haven't snacked on anything today.  Not sure how much water I had today, the power was out for a while so I wasn't recording.

       8:29 a.m., Wednesday Day Ten.  Yes, I am still congratulating myself.  I can't believe how well I handled yesterday.  I am so COOL.  And just LOOK at my totals!!  Here is some other good news:  I have been massively overestimating the amount of wine I drink in a single "glass."  I was looking it up on the Calorie Counter page, because I didn't know how big a restaurant serving is, which is what I had yesterday. Turns out to be 4 ounces.  Which seemed awfully small to me, so I went and measured how much I drink in our big wine glasses. Because they are rather large.  I just assumed I was pouring myself 8 ounces at a time, but no, in fact it's only 6 ounces.  ALSO the website gives a lower calorie count than the Netzer book, because it distinguishes between red and white wine.  Those two items cut my original estimates almost in half. So this is great news.  I'm not going back and revising my original calorie counts, but will use the corrected version from here out.  It won't be an excuse for drinking, because it's still a lot of calories and sugar, but I'm relieved it isn't as bad as I thought.  Didn't do well with water yesterday, but will improve today.  I slept like hell last night (too much wine and salty food) so I am going to be hard put to exercise today. Maybe I'll do the 10 minute increments. I don't think I have the strength to do an hour straight. My eyes are dry and my muscles are burning just from sitting upright.  Perhaps today I will work on the bathroom; yesterday I bought primer.  Also need to do some sorting out so we can haul away our crap Saturday.  10:06 a.m.  OMG OMG OMG.  I just tried on my Measurement Pants, to see where I am with that.  I haven't tried them in a long time, and I figured I gained a bit over the holidays. Well, I figured WRONG.  I almost could WEAR those pants.  The only thing that would stop me is that too-tight pants are sleazy.  But if I put them on and walked around the house a few minutes to get them stretched out, they would be almost possible.  You know what this means. This means that I HAVE LOST WEIGHT.  For real.  I am so excited.  Also managed 30 minutes of exercise.  I'll try the other half later in the day, maybe after lunch.  1:11 p.m. Two things of note: first, the GLIDER HAS ARRIVED.  I want to drop everything and set it up, but don't have a place to put it yet.  I need to dismantle the dining room table, and that's a big project.  Second, I ate too much broccoli at lunch, and now my stomach hurts. Like seriously.  That's a big change in me, apparently I'm becoming adjusted to the smaller amount of food I've been eating.  I am quite uncomfortable and had to give up painting the bathroom until I digest a little further.  So, bad that I ate too much (I was "finishing up" the broccoli regardless of whether it was the right amount) but good that I can tell a difference.  4:06 p.m.  Feeling a little better.  I had a small nap and then primed the bathroom.  My stomach is much improved, although not 100%.  I think it's amazing that I can overeat.  Before, I'm not sure I could.  Having a tiny glass of wine (so sue me) before dinner.  I just put the ribs in the oven. They are big ass pieces of meat, and I think I'd better have just one. Uncooked, a single rib weighs about .95 pound. Of course, there's a bone in there, but I don't know how much that accounts for. I'd better be conservative.  I've jumped on this bandwagon really quickly; looking back at my entries, Day One was the only time I was really negative about my ability to do this.  (I've been continuously negative about my chances of success, however.) Now I'm looking at it as a challenge, a sort of game: get the most nutritious food in the smallest amount of calories.  You know, I'd like to look at this as a quest to eat the BEST food, not the LEAST food, but right now I need to go overboard. Maybe that can be the motto for my maintenance, rest-of-my-life diet.  6:26 p.m.  Thank goodness I decided to only have one rib.  I can't believe the counts on a sparerib!  The entry in the calorie book was for one pound uncooked weight, which is right on the nose.  I think I'd better not buy these too often, no matter how cheap they are.

       7:50 a.m. Tuesday, Day Nine.  Wow, look at yesterday's total!  That's impressive.  It was hard to do though.  I was pretty hungry in the afternoon and evening. So I'm going to be careful about going too extreme, because then the temptation to eat something bad will be too much. Yeah, I don't like using the word "bad," but I couldn't think of a more appropriate label.  Had a little bit of a panic lying in bed this morning - realized there wasn't anything for my lunch!!  It scared the hell out of me.  Not that I would have literally nothing, but that I would eat something crappy.  See, it's that diet-induced food panic.  Have to be chill about that. There's plenty of food in the world, and I'm going to have delicious meals.  No panic.  And if one meal is boring and unsatisfying, don't freak out, because the next one will be good. I can't believe my dependence on food!  I took the Dr. Phil test of "are you an emotional eater?" and scored VERY high.   Anyway, I realized that there's still two pieces of chicken left and broccoli, and I can get something else cooked this afternoon so I'll have leftovers available again. And I can go to the store today and get more vegetables or shrimp or whatnot.  The shrimp is such a good deal, diet-wise, I wish I could afford more. The best I ever see is $4.99 a pound, which will make two meals for both of us.  I got up a little late again today. Stayed up too late watching Cast Away (I'll give it a B-) and was a bit restless all night.  Didn't drink, so that's good, but I was pretty thirsty from the fish. Have a small headache this morning.  I don't think it's seltzer-related, I didn't drink that much seltzer yesterday plus this seems centered in my neck and shoulders.  So I'm a little behind schedule again, will probably have to exercise at 10 instead of 9.  It's 8:19 already and I haven't eaten yet.  You know, I have been really de-sugaring myself with this diet.  I hadn't thought about it before, but I haven't had sugar since Day One. Maybe that's causing the headache.  Like when you go through caffeine withdrawal.  I am so addicted to sugar it just seems safest to not have any.  Like I'm afraid to buy those Skinny Cow ice cream sandwiches, because if they're in the freezer, I'll eat them constantly.  They're no diet bargain if you eat the whole package.  Right now I'm reading the success stories on the Weight Watchers page. Can you believe the change in me?  I am SO SO SO not a joiner, and that includes joining or accepting a philosophy (so to speak), so it's amazing that I'm buying in to this stuff.  Again, it's just like the smoking.  I wasn't able to quit until I really bought into it. I used all the silly little psychological tricks and silly inspirational gimmicks I could.  I thought "No one else is watching you do this, no one is thinking how stupid and sheeplike you are. This is private and you can be as silly as necessary."  So that's what I'm doing here, and that's why I'm writing in this journal every two hours.  It's part of my buying in to the idea.  One thing I'm reading about is setting goals, and then rewarding yourself for achieving them.  I'm thinking I need to reward myself for getting through Week One.  Don't know what the reward is, though.  I swear, that's one of the drawbacks of living where we do, it's more of an ordeal than a treat to go somewhere.  Like I'm thinking of browsing Barnes and Noble for a magazine I might want to subscribe to, but thinking of how it will take me 25 minutes to get there, so I'm thinking of other "chores" I can combine with the trip to make it worthwhile, and all of a sudden it's work and not a treat. Whatever, I will find some nice treat for myself.  8:57 a.m. OK, finished my soup and I'm right back in my journal.  I'm taping the Dr. Phil show so I can have it around for another day when there's nothing good on. Will probably exercise to Ellen today.  I really want to keep this up. Over the weekend we got lots of exercise doing yard work, so I didn't need to do a specific exercise. I absolutely cannot exercise in front of anyone, even Bucko. Maybe especially Bucko.  Like I get mad if he even comes into the room when I'm working out.  I guess I'll have to get used to that, because the glider will be right in the dining room. Although probably I'll do it when he's at work. But on the weekends — if we don't have major yard/house work planned, I'll have to do the gliding. Speaking of, just got a confirmation email from Wal-Mart saying it has shipped and will be delivered sometime between Thursday and next Wednesday. Yeah, that's a tight schedule.  11:21 a.m.  Finished one hour workout.  Not a good one, I don't have enough energy today. Perhaps from how little I ate yesterday!  Watched half of Waiting to Exhale during. I'm going on a late lunch with Daisy, so trying to figure out someplace I can get reasonable food. I would love some sushi, maybe I could get sashimi instead. If we go to one of those Chili's type restaurants, I'll have to get a salad, and low-fat dressing. Blah. Sushi would be better, even with the rice. But what the hell, they're the kind of restaurant that is open ALL the time, we can get drinks, Daisy can smoke.  It won't kill me to have a salad.  Maybe they even have a fish meal.  6:24 p.m.  Just got back from lunch/drinks.  I am SO pound of myself.  Didn't succumb.  We ordered a shrimp and cheese dip with croutons or whatever, and it was DELICIOUS and I only ate 4 pieces of bread. We left half of it on the plate. Oh my god, I can't believe I did that. Because it was filled with delicious greasy rich goodness and I wanted to eat it ALL.  But I stopped myself after eating a quarter of it, and then got a salad.  And I could tell the salad had a fair amount of oil in the dressing, so I DIDN'T FINISH IT.  I ate about half.  Holy cow, who has killed me and replaced me with a non-eating robot??? I am so rewarding myself for this!  Don't know what form that will take, but damn I'm impressed with myself! Resisting that kind of temptation while drinking.  I'll have to figure out the calories later (too drunk now) but it was very moderate for that type of restaurant. Damn, I rule! I rock!  I am the BOMB.  And thank god, because I had four glasses of wine, and will probably have two more later tonight.  7:45 p.m. Okay, DOUBLE points to me.  Bucko brought home a Wendy's salad for me, AND french fries. I ate FOUR fries.  And half the salad.  Man, I am doing so good.  I'm so impressed with my strength.  My only failing today is not drinking the water.  Mostly because I was out all day and didn't have the opportunity, not that I'm excusing myself.  I've seen other people write that eating a particular thing might feel good but that it just doesn't feel as good as losing weight.  I've never quite gotten that, but it's starting to make sense.  Like as delicious as that shrimp dip was, it wasn't as delicious as staying on my plan and getting to brag about myself (to myself) about how strong and wonderful I am.

       MONDAY, FIRST DAY OF WEEK TWO!!!  Which makes this Day Eight.  We are having a big old celebration today, because I got through Week One with flying colors!  Here's the count for WEEK ONE:    calories consumed: 11,625    goal calories tppw: 9,121    goal calories oppw: 12,614  I am 2,511 calories over the goal for tppw. Therefore, I should have lost one pound, with 989 calories left over, which in a laboratory setting would equal another .28 of a pound.  So about one and a quarter pounds.  Therefore, I now weigh 258.75.  Hee hee.  This is hilarious, the whole thing is on paper (on electrons).  I don't know what I weighed to start with or how much, if any, I really did lose.  This seems to be an exercise in faith for me. I'm going to simply believe that it's working.  It has to be that way at first anyway.  A scale is not able to reliably detect whether I've lost a pound or not. There's too much fluctuation for that to register for real.  It might say I'd lost 4 pounds, but 3 of that is water, not permanent.  So we'll leave the scale alone for now.  Back to today:  overslept terribly.  I didn't get up until 8; it's 8:38 now and I haven't even had breakfast yet.  So exercise will be a little late today. I think I will tape Dr. Phil so I have that available in case Ellen is dull. Oh please let the glider arrive soon!  Had a wonderful time with Daisy last night.  I missed her SO much, and it broke my heart that she could go two weeks without me.  I know that's silly, she's lived 32 years perfectly well without me. It's not that I want her dependent or clingy, I guess it just hurt my feelings (or maybe ego) a little.  Anyway, she's back in town and we have grandiose ideas for our Plan 9 and how we're going to change our lives. So yay.  And I'm on the Mac today; with Bucko back at work I can probably get access enough.  That's nice.  So, this week I'm going to start tracking water consumption.  I want to drink 80 ounces a day. That's ten eight-ounce glasses.  My water glasses are 12 ounces, so I need to drink 6.6 glasses, which I will round up to 7.  I need to drink 7 glasses of water a day.  I know I'm only drinking 3-4 glasses now. And in a random note: removing the skin from the chicken is definitely worth it.  I LOVE the skin, but it adds so many calories, I can have a whole nother piece for the same amount.  11:29 a.m. Finished the hour exercise. Hard going!  The first half hour was good, I worked really hard, but dragged the second part. Barely picking up my feet by the last quarter. Also I'm starving.  I'm having more water now to fill up, because I don't want to eat until 12:30 or 1:00, since I am running behind.  I don't want to be slave to the clock, but I'm trying to spread my meals out, so I don't eat my day's "allotment" in the first five hours.  Really excited about Week Two.  Bucko and I have once again resolved to limit ourselves to "Drinking Nights," which are Tuesday, Friday, and Saturday.  That will cut another 400 to 1000 calories from my weekly total. I like the way I'm treating this as an exact science, even though I don't actually know a) how much I weigh, b) how many calories I used to eat, c) how many calories I should eat, d) how many calories I'm burning in exercise, and e) my ass from a hole in the ground.  1:08 p.m. Delicious lunch of leftover chicken.  I decided to have four pieces — two legs and two thighs — but didn't realize the plate had five pieces. When I sat down to eat it, I thought "oh well, then I'll just have five."  Uh-uh. Hit the brakes on that one. I was so hungry I wanted to eat forever. But came to my senses and realized, I won't still be hungry after four pieces.  I don't have to keep eating just because it's good. I mean, chicken isn't THAT good.  So I ended up eating only three pieces.  That's so much better, it leaves me room for a snack later and it was a good exercise in stopping in time.  2:27 p.m.  Cleaning out the closet upstairs. What a mess!  I'm trying to carry some of it out to the garage, but can't take too many trips up and down the stairs.  Had a really strong craving for something sweet.  Had an apple, that seems to have taken care of it. Doing well with the water too.  I'm starting to track fiber also.  I'm not sure it's as meaningful as if I also track the sugar part of the carbs, but I think this is as much of a chart as I can take.  It's enough to give me a good picture and it's fun and interesting to maintain. Any more and I'll either lose interest or I'll focus too much on filling out a chart instead of living.  3:13. My tight jeans seem looser today than a few days ago. Hope that's a true sign. Feeling hungry again, and it's early in the day. I'm drinking more water. Going to get a little more exercise this afternoon, even if it's just packing.  I don't want my metabolism to slow from eating less.  4:05 p.m.  Taking down the blinds in the bathroom. Dusty!  Also dull.  I'll try to finish, but taking out all those screws by hand is killer.  I got my water quota done today by 3:30.  Good news, I won't be up peeing all night.  Haven't planned dinner yet, but we have a little piece of salmon.  I think the ribs are still frozen.  Of course we can have a vegetable-intensive meal with just a tiny bit of fish.  I can see I need to shop more often than usual, since we're not eating fast food anymore.  I have 811 calories left for today. And I'm babbling again.  5:25 p.m.  I can't believe how often I feel the need to "check in" here. It's just been my whole life for the past week, and I'll write any trivial nothing just to be writing and thinking about losing weight. Maybe that is what will make it work this time, maybe somehow I've developed the focus and interest to do it, and managed to set aside the resentment and onerousness.  Because honestly, it pisses me off that I should "have to" lose weight.  It pisses me off that people judge me, in all aspects of my character, based on this single physical attribute. I hate the societal pressure for women to lose weight to look good.  It's one thing to lose for health, but as far as looks, hey go fuck yourself.  Having salmon, steamed broccoli, and black bean salad for dinner. It will be a pretty big piece of salmon, around 8 ounces. Made a sauce/dip for the broccoli out of no-fat yogurt with about a tablespoon of gorgonzola cheese, ginger, and fresh ground pepper.  It's not bad — the tanginess of the yogurt doesn't go with everything, but it's nice with most vegetables. The bean salad is a can of black beans, a can of "Mexican" diced tomatoes, and a handful of leftover lettuce.  It's pretty and colorful, and has a wonderful texture.

       Sunday. DAY SEVEN!!  I am so excited to be on the last day.  I did really well last night at Capper's.  Before I've even added in my calories, I'm going to congratulate myself. Two drinks, a salad, and a dinner roll (the roll was irresistible). I probably have gone over my target, but I still was remarkably restrained in an environment where I could have easily added on another 1000 to 2000 calories.  OK, just added up my calories for yesterday. 1920.  Not bad!  That means I'm at 10,032 before eating anything Sunday, which means I still have almost 3,000 calories left just for today (for oppw). I'm over tppw by 911 calories.  I certainly won't eat 3000 today, so I guess I'll lose somewhere around a pound and a half.  Since I'm not weighing myself, I can't imagine how I'm going to track progress on these terms. But as I've mentioned, one or two pounds isn't going to show up on me anyway.  I'll need to do this for a month before I can see any difference.  I guess I'll just go with how my clothes fit.  If I really do start losing weight in a noticeable way, maybe I'll buy a scale for inspiration.  I'm pretty psyched up for next week, hoping I can beat this week. Saw a really funny sketch on Mad TV, of a QVC show where two tiny thin women were doing the sales for a Plus-Size clothing line, and making nasty comments about the fat model. Then the model gets sick of it and turns on them. She says something to the first one like "What are you so righteous about? You have the body of a 10-year-old boy. When you were puking up your third breakfast this morning, did you also puke your personality into the toilet, because that's where you left it."  And to the other women, something about "You're so shapeless you look like a Pez body with a Bitch head."  I LOVE that line. With a bitch head. Hee hee hee.  2:56 p.m.  Just finished with the wood piling.  That's it!  I am TIRED, but glad to have gotten the exercise.  Daisy is going to come over around 4:00, and is bringing wine or beer.  I'm glad I had the small lunch (270 calories), because that will give me some leeway for drinking and snacking.  Drinking seltzer water now to keep my stomach full until then.  I am starving, so probably will cut up some celery, cucumber, and carrots.  Also I want to congratulate myself that I've been to the supermarket twice since the beginning of my "diet" and also to a restaurant, and I resisted the temptation to buy any sweets.  I LOOKED at the Skinny Cow ice cream in Lowes, to make sure they have it, but I didn't buy any.  I'm reading over what I wrote on Monday, and I've come a long way just in this one week.

       Saturday, Day Six. Can you believe it?  Almost through a week.  A little difficult to figure yesterday's calories. We had a dinner of leftovers and tiny smidgens of stuff, so I'm making a best-guess.  Once again, too much wine. That was my highest day of calories so far.  It's not a horrible amount, so I don't feel like I fell off the horse or cheated or anything like that, it's just a reminder to pay attention to what I'm eating.  We're going food shopping this morning, which is good. I need to replenish the tomato juice and vegetable sitch.  Not sure about the seltzer water. I don't have a headache today, but I had a bit of one late last night. Of course, that could have been the wine!  Which I must drink less of!  Time to start having wine spritzers.  Not what I would do with a good wine, but it will be fine with the cheapie stuff we usually get.  Delicious lunch of veggie sandwich in whole-wheat pita.  Not enough food though, you can't pack much into a pita.  So also had the last leftover drumstick. That's actually fewer calories than the pita alone. Bread sucks!  Drinking lemon-lime seltzer today.  Didn't exercise this morning, since I got up late and we went grocery shopping. Will have to work it in this afternoon.  So I figured my weekly amount of calories should be 12,614 to lose oppw; 9,121 to lose tppw.  Right at this moment I'm at 8,112 with a day and a half left in the week.  So I don't think I'll make tppw, but I should be good with oppw. Hee.  Definitely have to crank this up, I am not going to be patient enough for oppw. Damn wine!  3:09 p.m.  Taking a little break from cutting and hauling wood. Oh yes, this will account for my exercise today.  It isn't quite backbreaking, but it's very hard work. Good.  My, what a change in my life, deliberately looking for opportunities to exercise.  5:07 p.m. Done with the wood for today. We didn't get all of it done, there's SO much to do.  I can see we're going to need help loading the truck next weekend. Not sure who we can sucker into it.  I'm drinking wine coolers, which are kind of nasty, but obviously a much better deal calorie-wise and probably better for my liver too.  Had a little snack of cherry tomatoes. I looked up tomatoes again in the food counts book, and I think I've been overestimating significantly. I'm going to go with 11 calories for ten cherry tomatoes.  Also, they're actually called "grape" tomatoes" because they're so small.  I figure we can have that shrimp salad again for dinner, because I've got all the pieces for it. Shrimp, lettuce, tomatoes, mangoes.  Mmmm.  I might get inspired enough to start tracking fiber on my charts.  Most of the carbs I'm eating (besides wine) come from vegetables, but without tracking fiber there's no way to note that it's not from sugar.  I like the stream of consciousness style of journal I'm doing here.  It's all so trivial and random, just whatever thought pops into my head.  Definitely not blog material, nothing here that would interest or amuse anyone else.  7:10 p.m.  I'm at 1495 calories right now, and we're getting ready to go out to Capper's.  I really don't want to be writing in here tomorrow about how I blew it tonight, so I need a strategy.  OK, I'm going to have vodka and soda. One of those is 65 calories, so I can afford to drink a couple.  And I'll have water with each one, to keep hydrated and slow down the alcohol consumption.  OK, that sounds good.  Oh boy, one more day to go in week one! I'm at 9,607 calories right now; 12,614 to lose oppw; 9,121 to lose tppw. So unless I go completely crazy tomorrow, I should have lost ONE POUND this week!

       Friday, Day Five. Feeling OK today.  Slept OK, a little restless but not bad for me.   I'm pretty happy with the soup for breakfast.  That's the least emotionally important meal of the day for me, and so the easiest to have something boring.  It's a major savings of calories for me.  I used to eat leftovers for breakfast, as well as lunch, and referring to my charts of this week, that would be 350 to 450 calories instead of 110.  So I've saved 240 to 340 calories right there.  Which is well on the way to reducing intake by 500 calories a day.  Not sure how much I was eating before the diet, so I don't know how it compares.  I'm guessing I was eating a third again as much food, and maintaining my weight for the most part. Call it another 550 calories, or around 2195 total.  So actually I'm right on target with how much I'm reducing.  I might even be in the two-pounds-per-week range. I think I'd better start abbreviating that as tppw.  Also having increased my exercise from 20 or 30 minutes to 60 minutes will help.  I'm going to go look up some calories expenditures for exercise.  Holy cow!  The calorie council website says that walking briskly for an hour, I will burn 686 calories!  I think that's a little high, but still...  excellent.  "Taking a stroll" was 358 calories.  I think my expenditure has been somewhere between those two.  More than strolling, but perhaps not as vigorous as brisk walking.  That's what I'm saying about not being able to exercise as hard as I would like. I mean, I can't RUN.  And I can only walk so fast because of knees and feet.  I can't jump around too much for the same reasons, and also for the stair-stepping.  That is a good workout, but it's hell on my feet.  Also, the calorie council website recommends fat intake of less than 35% of the diet.  I am doing WAY less than that. Way less. Like 10%.  Some of my foods are hard to track because they're such a small portion.  Like, I can't put NOTHING, but it's hard to figure how much it is.  I might put a can of tomatoes in the bean salad, but I drained the liquid out. So how much of a can is left?  The actual serving I ate might have had four or five chunks of tomato in it. How much of a whole tomato is that?  I'm just doing my best guess, and estimating high.  The "Food Counts" book is hard to use, I might try referring to the calorie website.  I read about "Skinny Cow" brand low-fat and no-fat ice cream bars and sandwiches. They look pretty good. 130 calorie each, 0 or 20 calories from fat, 22 grams carbs.  So it's not like they're GOOD for you, but if I have an uncontrollable sweets craving, it would be better to treat it this way than go get an entire Lindt bar. Looks like Lowe's, Food Dog, Kroger, Harris Teeter, and Wal-Mart all carry them.  10:51 a.m. Finished an hour workout.  Managed to work a little harder today. Did stair stepping interspersed with total gym and the little dumbbells.  I was just dragging the last 15 minutes.  Also starving.  Had a glass of tomato juice.  I'm trying to resist the mid morning snack, and am having cherry flavored seltzer water instead. That will also be my test to see if I get a headache.  I'm completely addicted to this little journal now.  It was making me very edgy when Bucko was on the computer and I couldn't write in here.  I moved over to the PC so I could have access all the time.  I guess I just have to make this my life for now. That's been pretty easy to do since I'm not working, I don't know what it will be like when (hopefully) I'm back on the job.  Speaking of which, I have no idea what my employment status is. There's a rumor the office will be closed down this year.  Don't know if that means "sometime this year" or "January 1."  Since it's already the 2nd, you'd think we would have a little notice, but I wouldn't count on it.  I hate that place terrifically and want to get out, but I can't deny the convenience of the paycheck. The large paycheck.  I worked ONE hour in the second half of December, so my paycheck will be about $20.  As opposed to $1600 or so.  That's a little scary.  I just transferred $1000 from savings to get through the first half of January, and I'm not sure it's enough. We just spent over $300 on getting the HVAC fixed.  If I don't get some hours in the next two weeks, we'll be living off savings.  It would be nice to sell a piece of furniture; I've got to get that stuff somewhere people can see it.  I'm not keen on Asheville, the one table I have up there hasn't sold. Not to mention the prices are quite low.    Gross. I hate work.  I'm going to go make veggie burritos for Bucko's work lunches now.  The burritos turn out to be approximately 400 calories each, 19 g protein, 57 carb, 13.5 fat.  Most of the calories and fat come from the tortillas.  I mistakenly bought the fat-containing brand this time. At least it doesn't have lard.  Had a rather rich lunch, with the porkloin and all. Delicious though.  Today is going well.  4:08 p.m.  Finished the first sanding and patching of the bathroom. I'm just having the last of the cherry seltzer, so that will be one liter I've drank today.  Very happy I'm halfway through Day Five.  Right now I've had 656 calories.  I think that's about right — I'm halfway through my goal amount, and I have dinner left. That always tends to be the biggest meal.  I'm really happy with how low-cal the shrimp salad was.  Not just the lettuce, but the shrimp were a bargain too. 15 shrimp, 83 calories. That sounds too small, I'm going to check the book again.  No, it's right. 4 large shrimp are 22 calories. That's 5.5 calories each, so for 15 it's 82.5 calories. Excellent.  How can they be so little?  Ah, calorie counting.  How obsessive and horrible.  I hate it, and yet I need to embrace it to do this thing.  Wouldn't it be so wonderful if it worked?  I wish so much I could have done this a year before Tahiti.  And I tried, I mean look at the beginning date of this journal.  It wasn't working, and I hope the results are different this time.  I think so, because I'm willing to modify my behavior a great deal now, whereas before I think I was too hung up on the concept of fairness.  Anyway, I hate the thought of going to Tahiti fat.  Yeah, another fat American. Gaaah.  I don't know why white people aren't allowed to be fat. Polynesians are kind of heavy.  So are a lot of African Americans, and Latinas.  Those girls on Univision are hot!  Well fuck it, white women are too allowed to be fat, because I'm fat, and I'm very hot, and no one can tell me what I'm "allowed," so there.  For all this calorie-counting and writing, I'm actually not obsessing about food.  I haven't been hungry much and haven't felt deprived.  Can't wait for the glider!  Could be as little as six days, maybe the end of next week.

       Day Four. New Year's Day. I'm at the half-way mark of the week.  So, not so bad on Wednesday, especially for New Year's Eve.  Not quite where I want to be, but not too bad.  I'm still in the lose-a-pound-per-week range.   I almost cheated in tracking my food yesterday, because I ate so much compared to the other two days.  I filled out my chart before I ate dinner, with approximations of amount that I could finalize after the meal. But I hadn't taken into account the gorgonzola sauce or the black bean salad, and definitely not the drinks.  So I almost didn't put them on the chart, because I didn't want to see my totals go up too high.  But I'm not going to do it that way.  There's no point in this if I'm going to lie or try to create some kind of false impression.  Who am I lying to? There's no one else involved in this besides me.  I've got to give up the notion of "proving" that I don't overeat.  I know I don't, and it has nothing to do with the concept of dieting to lose weight.  I don't have to prove it to anyone.  I guess I think that if I diet and lose weight by doing so, it means that my whole life I've eaten too much and that's why I'm so fat, and it's all my fault.  That I have a faulty behavior that I could have fixed and didn't. That my whole life was wasted through my own stupidity and weakness.  Well, fuck that.  That isn't what it means.  The fact that I have to diet to lose weight doesn't mean that you just reverse the polarity to see the opposite result.  Slept really crappy last night.  I went to sleep too early (9:00).  I woke up at 12:30, and watched TV until about 3:30.  The whole South Park movie.  I didn't even get up until 9 today (my normal exercise time) so I can see it's going to be hard to fit it in today.  I might have to do it in pieces instead of an hour straight.  A little frightened today thinking about having to do this for a year.  That's more-or-less the amount of time it would take me to get to a reasonable weight.  52 weeks times two pounds a week, is 104 pounds, which would bring me to 156.  So it's more likely to be longer than a year, because I may not achieve the 2 pounds, and will probably have some backsliding and plateaus.  I haven't thought in terms of goal weight yet, but I think 150 has been floating around my mind.  Maybe 135, but I'd have to see what 150 was like first; 135 might be too thin.  So I'm looking to lose 110 pounds, maybe 125 pounds. That sounds so crazy!  That I can lose an entire normal bodyweight. God, how did I get to be so fat?  You know, when I look in the mirror, I don't look that fat to me.  It's not until I see a photo that I'm stunned by it.   So anyway, I don't like the thought of doing this for years.  But, I'm going to look on the optimistic side, and realize that I've been eating very delicious, varied food on my diet, so it's not like a sentence of celery and grapefruit.  This is mostly portion control and cutting out the unnecessary calories from condiments.  As far as the exercise, maybe if I get fit enough, I will actually enjoy doing it, and be able to do more.  It could happen.  11:38 a.m.  Feeling kind of cranky.  I think it has to do with no exercise today.  I did ten minutes, and figured I'd do another 10-15 in a while, repeat until I have my whole hour down.  Maybe I should have done more in one swell foop.  We're planning on taking our New Year's walk around Lake Lynn today, which I think is at least a mile, maybe even two, so that will be good, and certainly counts toward the exercise.  Oh, I can't wait for the glider.  It's about the only exercise I've been able to do that lets me work really hard.  Because of knees and feet and impact, it's difficult for me to move very quickly or for any great length of time.  The glider lets me "run" without pain and damage, so I can exert more and get a good heartbeat.  I don't think I've moved my heart rate into the fat-burning range for months, if not years.  2:18 p.m. Back from the lake. Yep, seems to be two miles around, and I've got my hour's exercise accomplished.   4:54 p.m.  Finished stripping the wallpaper.  Now I will have to sand, patch, sand again, prime with oil, and paint.  Fortunately we never use that bathroom, so it's no hardship to have it torn apart for a couple weeks.  Still full from lunch, so that's good.  Definitely feeling better after walking and stripping. Heh.  7:40 p.m. Delicious dinner — shrimp on lettuce salad, with mango and cherry tomatoes, and a side of sliced cucumber and radish and one of steamed carrots.  Also I see I have room for one or two glasses of wine, which would be nice. Overall a pretty good day.  No headache, which doesn't bode well for the seltzer water. That is so damned disappointing, because I really like that stuff and it helps me drink enough water.  So I'm almost through Day Four, and the whole week has gone very well.  Of course, this is what I've spent all my time and focus on, and I expect that will be a challenge to maintain.  After the full week, I will spend some time analyzing what I've been eating, and see where I can make improvements. Also I'm quite proud that I've exercised an hour each day so far. Haven't let myself off the hook once.  I know one of my danger points is boredom, and another will be eating in restaurants. We both love restaurants, and the food is so rich and the portions are huge.  Assuming I can make myself take home half of it, it's still far beyond what I should be eating.  I don't see any point in going to a restaurant and ordering salad, so I think the wisest course is to avoid eating out as much as possible.  Then when we do, we can order regular food, but it will be so infrequent as to not sabotage my entire diet.  Did I mention I can't wait for the glider to get here?

       7:23 a.m. Sunday. I guess I feel okay, except for being tired. I woke up at 5:00 a.m., and couldn’t go back to sleep.  I couldn’t get comfortable in bed, and my mind was filled with squirrelly thoughts. Nothing major, just things I need to remember, chores, bills. That kind of thing. I went downstairs to watch TV and thought I would fall asleep in the chair, but I didn’t. I finally gave up a few minutes ago and made coffee. I don’t know what caused it.  My hip still hurts, that’s bad news. I’m afraid it might be in the joint and not the muscle.  My numbers yesterday aren’t bad for a drinking day. Also, limited myself to three drinks. Yay for me.  I need to do something to change this, and I think I will take the advice of Dr. Phil, who says willpower doesn’t work. Willpower comes and goes. You have to change your life so that the opportunity isn’t there. So it might be wise to stop buying vodka. Buy a bottle of wine for drinking night, and that’s it. Red wine, because I don’t drink that so quickly. I will see if Bucko is willing to try that for a while. Again I want to note that I seem to be allergic to alcohol. I get a stuffy nose from one drink.  An interesting tip for avoiding eating when hungry: engage in a highly-scented activity, such as polishing your nails or cleaning furniture with lemon-scented oil. Umm, okay.  I’ve decided to track my total minutes exercising for each week. I’m setting 300 minutes as my minimum goal. I’ll total them up on Sundays, because I rarely exercise on weekends. I’m going to count only deliberate exercise, not incidental exercise. When I get back from vacation, I would like to weigh myself at the doctor’s and get an official weight; recalculate my BMI and BMR; start counting my BMR calories and subtracting exercise from that figure.  If I feel that energetic!  5:19 p.m. I am SO crabby.  It came on me very suddenly as we were driving around looking at neighborhoods.  It’s so intense that I have to suppose it’s related to hormones or something I ate.  I mean, I am so foul I can barely force myself to speak civilly to Bucko. Every single thing he does or says is making me FURIOUS.  I guess I have to blame the chocolate; I haven’t eaten anything else unusual today or yesterday. Boy!  I don’t remember having a reaction to chocolate like this in the past, it must be from removing it from my diet for so long. I’m not used to it anymore.  Also I was so hungry when we got back from the ride that I ate half a rib.  That’s going to affect how much I can eat for dinner.  I think I let myself get too thirsty and too hungry this afternoon, and then couldn’t catch up.  8:18 p.m. I have GREAT numbers this week.  I should have lost almost two pounds.  I’m going to drink more water tonight and make sure I don’t eat anything else, so I end the week well. I’m glad I got in such low numbers before vacation, maybe I can continue for the rest of next week. We leave on Friday, and I just don’t know what it’s going to be like. There’s no way I’m going to fly halfway around the world in order to deprive myself of great food, but I’m going to try to balance it. I don’t have to eat hugely or richly every single meal. I can experience the restaurants and local cuisine without going crazy. I hope.  I’m planning on having a little notebook with me so that I can keep SOME sort of record, though since all our meals will be out, I won’t be able to be super accurate. That’s okay, I’ll just make my best guesses as to WHAT I ate, and then when I get home I can try to figure out the numbers.

       8:05 a.m. Saturday. Only two more days in Week Nine.  Feel pretty good today. However, I’ve got a sore spot around my left hip.  It’s so hard to pinpoint I’m not sure whether it’s in my back, my thigh, or my hip. At any rate, it hurts when I walk.  I think I overdid it with the exercise lately. I will take it easy for a couple days, since it’s the weekend anyway, and hopefully recover before vacation.  Looks like the snow will all melt today (yay). I made an appointment for a haircut Monday morning.  It’s at ten, so I will have to work in my exercise around that.  2:17 p.m. Finally finished cleaning the garage, and now we move on to the office. My hip is still bothering me, when I stand or step a certain way. I’m pretty sure it’s from the bellydance, because it hurts when I extend my hip to the side. Probably I overdid those rib and hip circles.

       6:59 a.m. Friday. Nearly the end of Week Nine. Feeling okay. I had  a lot of dreams, as usual, but at least not unpleasant.  Looks like we have about 5-6 inches of snow on the ground. Classes are cancelled, so Bucko will be home today. I’d better put this on a zip disk so I can take it over to the PC. Fantastic numbers yesterday; good thing because I’ve been pretty high calorie-wise this week.  Here’s something I want to mention:  I have noticed that my thighs are slimmer. The outsides of them, anyway. When I put my hand on my thigh, I can feel that it doesn’t stick out as much as it used to. Also last night in bed, I went to scratch the top of my left thigh, and thought “hey, what’s that?”  You know what it was? A muscle. Yes. There was a hard ridge along the front of my thigh that hasn’t been there before. Hee.  I’m thinking about getting an exercise ball. Because I can sit on it at the computer, and train my abs while geeking.   2:21 p.m. Puttering around the house, packing and cleaning. It’s stopped snowing, and the sun is _almost_ coming out. It’s supposed to be warm and sunny tomorrow and Sunday, so we won’t be trapped too long. Unbelievable that the power hasn’t gone out.

       6:17 a.m. Thursday. Feeling pretty good today.  I woke up a little early, around 5:15 I think.  Had to use the bathroom, so I couldn’t go back to sleep and figured I might as well get up.  We have a winter storm warning today AND tomorrow. This has been the worst winter since we’ve lived here. We’ve had a couple bigger storms, but never so MANY storms.  I’m really looking forward to Tahiti just to get away from the weather!    So yesterday wasn’t too bad.  The Crazy Fire was not a good choice, but I compensated with dinner, so it came out reasonably.  Once again I am concerned whether I am still losing weight.  My progress is so slow that I feel like I lost several pounds after the first four weeks, and nothing has happened since then. So I want to remind myself that the first time I was able to wear the Measurement Pants was February 19. That’s exactly seven days ago, on Day 52. So obviously there has been continuous progress. Maybe today I’ll try the Measurement Shorts and see how that goes.  My ring has been tighter for a couple weeks now, ever since I did the kitchen floor. I figured my hands were a bit swollen (they were) but surely that should have worn off by now? At least I can still take it off and on, even if it’s a bit snug.  So I’m wanting to get my hair cut before the trip, and with this weather I doubt it will happen before Monday.  I’m going to look online for a Mitchell’s.  Not sure why, I think I had a dream about Mitchell’s.  I would like to find a good hair stylist that I could stick with, but since I only go every couple years that’s hard to find. Maybe if I found one I liked, I would go more often. Whatever.  8:13 a.m. Boy, I REALLY don’t feel like gliding today.  Can’t weight lift because I did it yesterday. Can’t say I feel like Richard Simmons or Cindy Crawford, either.  Maybe I can do more belly dance.  I’d prefer something mindless, but just can’t face any more gliding. Unless there’s something really absorbing on TV, it becomes dreary.  Don’t worry, I still like the glider over most other forms of exercise, but I need something to watch and Dr. Phil has sucked for quite a long time.  There’s nothing on until 10, when Ellen comes on, but that’s too late in the morning to exercise. Breaks up the day too much.  I made a separate home page for all my weight loss links. It’s pink. Hee. I’ve been screwing around with it instead of exercising. But I’m going to exercise. Soon. Really.  10:14 a.m. OK, I did the belly dance tape.  I’m not sure how to figure the calories, but what I’m going to do is this: a 35-minute workout, with 10 minutes equivalent to dusting (the warmup, 44 calories), 10 minutes equivalent to disco dancing (the ending part, 115 calories), and 15 minutes equivalent to walking the dog (the middle part, 123 calories).  Also tried on the Measurement Shorts, and sure enough they’re a wee bit closer to buttoning. And on a different subject: I am damned tired of this snow and ice and sleet. We can count on being stuck in the house for at least two days, which isn’t so bad in itself, but it’s so likely the power will go out. I have to fill up the bathtubs for flushing the toilets, fill up some pitchers for drinking water, cook up a bunch of food, do laundry, make extra ice for the cooler, etc. etc. It’s taking up too much time.   11:23 a.m. I’m cooking chicken in anticipation of power failure, and the smell is driving me wild. I’m starving!  I had an apple and another glass of water, but it’s hard to keep my mind off.  I don’t want to eat until 12:15, so I have a long way to go. I have discovered an activity that I link with eating in my mind: reading.  Whenever I sit down to read I want a snackie.  So far I’ve managed to limit that to pickles, but it’s hard to break. So anyway, I’m trying to pack some more. Collected and washed off the gargoyles, when they’re dry I’ll pack them with some silk plants. I might just sit and futz around in here until it’s lunch time. I hadn’t wanted to spend all day on the computer, but I need something to distract me. Random thought: remember to do push-ups as shown on WW page (side pushups).  Also I would like to discuss a weird goal of mine. This is something that will take a couple years.  I would like to belly dance in public. Professionally, I mean, like at a restaurant, or along those lines. I guess more than just once, but it doesn’t have to be a career. But I’d like to a) learn to belly dance well enough to do it, and b) lose enough weight to feel okay doing it.  Those two goals go together quite well.  Dancing is very difficult for me, I’m worse than having two left feet.  I seem to have some sort of weird mental block against understanding steps.  But belly dance uses natural, female movements, so it’s not hard to figure out. Hard to DO, yes, but not hard to figure out.  You can tell when you’re doing it right because it FEELS right.  So anyway, an unusual goal for me, but I’d love to accomplish it.  What the heck.  I can do the belly dance tape more often, once or twice a week, and I have the next tape in the series all ready to go. Then I can think about taking classes. Yeah, I’m just assuming I can find belly dance classes here; what do I think this is, Boulder? Heh. Well. I want to wear the outrageously sexy clothes, and the bangly jewelry, and fling my hair around and just be completely wanton. That would rule.  And I want to write about how I’m starting to dream about gorgeous clothes.  I’ve hated clothes for so long, but now I’m starting to think about being able to shop in ANY store. Like when you go to the beach, and they have these beautiful, exotic, slinky, tropical dresses in the shops, and they’re absolutely gorgeous, and I want them so much, and the biggest size is maybe a 12 or 14. Well, some day I’m going to have that. Oh, I have so far to go, but I’m starting to feel like I might really make it. Because I can do this. I can definitely eat this way. As far as the exercising, the only thing that will get in my way is a job. If that happens, I will simply have to put everything else in my life on LOW priority. Everything.  2:22 p.m. Bonus points for me — did 40 minutes on the glider, while I watched the second belly dance tape.  And did I mention it’s snowing? AGAIN.

       7:11 a.m. Wednesday.  Not sure how I feel today. I overslept, which always makes me groggy at first.  Also I feel kind of stiff.  Not bad numbers yesterday.  I was very moderate (for me) on a drinking night. My biggest expenditure was the chicken wings, and I ended up havng quite a small dinner because of it. Those little buggers add up fast. Drank a lot of water, not quite where I want to be but only one glass short.  Today I will finish the skirt I started yesterday. Also go pick up our tickets at travel agent, take the tapes back, go by the PO and stop our mail while we’re on vacation. Not sure what else.  2:05 p.m. Just got back from all the errands. Picked up our passports from the safe deposit box. We had lunch at Crazy Fire, and boy I sure hope I am overestimating the calories, because otherwise I’m topped out for the day. That’s what I get for having seconds. I COULD have stopped at one plate, but noooooooo. Let this be a lesson to me. Yeah.  6:58 p.m. Did a little more gliding — 25 minutes. Yay.

       7:13 a.m. Tuesday. Feeling pretty good today. I woke up a little early (5:30) but went back to sleep for an hour, so I’m doing okay. This morning I’m putting Benefiber in my coffee. For 20 calories I get 3 grams of fiber, so that’s a pretty good deal. I’m not having problems with my bowel movements, it’s just that I don’t think I’m eating nearly enough fiber. And I just wanted to write about bowel movements. Anyway, it doesn’t seem to have affected the flavor of the coffee.  Good numbers yesterday, almost in the ttpw range.  Here’s an exercise from the SDP that I’m going to do, only rephrase it in the positive: she says to list all the things you can’t/won’t do because of your weight. As a motivator to stay on plan. Only I’m going to list the things I’ll be able to do when I lose weight. Which might also inspire me to do some of them now.  Here’s my plan for today: going to digest until about 8:30. Then, will try for an hour of gliding, and watch that Rowan Atkinson movie. Then, off to Wal-Mart for 22 and 24 jeans, a makeup bag, a small carry-on, a broom, and some spring clothes if they have them, for the vacation. Or maybe some fabric to sew some wrap-around skirts. Depending on my results there, I might go to DressBarn. Then lunch. After, I may try to come up with an idea for the inside doors of the small armoire. Or if I have fabric, I might sew. I am going to try really hard to NOT drink until at least 5:00.  Since it’s officially drinking day.  9:23 a.m.  All I could handle was 45 minutes. Mostly because of nothing on TV. Johnny English was absolutely unwatchable, Dr. Phil had his most recent Fucked Up Family, and Carol Duvall is not good exercise material.  Maybe I will be able to do a few minutes in the afternoon.  I’ve done that a couple times, and I think it’s not a bad idea, so long as it really happens: do the most of the gliding in the morning, but get in another 10 or 15 minutes in the afternoon to re-boost my metabolism.  Been thinking about clothes, because of buying stuff for this trip.  I have never ever been into clothes. Because I’ve always been fat.  When I was younger and just slightly pudgy, I suppose I had some interest in the subject, but relatively little compared to other teenage girls. And recently clothes are just measurement devices to me. Sometimes I have idly fantasized about being able to buy normal clothes, pretty clothes, and look good in them, but I’ve never considered that it would really happen. Because I think, even when I was 15 and weighed 135 pounds, I couldn’t find clothes that fit and I looked terrible. So there’s no way at 42 years old and my goal of 150, that I’m going to like clothes. But you know, I’m not sure that’s true. Because I won’t be buying clothes in the Junior department of Fashion Bar, and because these days you can get fun stuff in women’s sizes, and also because even if I never weigh that little again, I will be in better shape physically.  I’ll have more muscle. Lower body fat. And WAY more confidence.  So I’m going to allow myself to look forward to clothes.  12:49 p.m. Just back from shopping, and here are the results:  I am a size 22, in everything except those jeans, where I am still a 24.  Everything else I bought is a 22, in Wal-Mart and Dress Barn.  My other observations are that Wal-Mart does not have enough plus size clothing, and that what they do have is ugly. Dress Barn has more, but it’s still ugly. Why are the colors different than the regular size clothes? Funk dat.  Anyway, I was thrilled to see that I fit into all 22s, and they were slightly large. Not large enough to go down to a 20, but still. Man, I can’t wait until I get to 18. That will be a major milestone, to be in the teens.  Also, isn't DRESS BARN a bad name for a clothing store?  BARN??  Not flattering.  6:15 p.m. I’ve put in another 15 minutes on the glider!

       6:16 a.m. Monday, first day of Week Nine, of Month Three.  Hard to believe.  I’m hoping to recommit myself to this plan, and recapture some enthusiasm for it. Although my numbers haven’t been terrible, I realize I’ve slacked off quite a bit, in my attitude if not my actual eating. I figure a prolonged binge won’t be far behind. No, let me rephrase that, not a “binge” but rather several days or even weeks of eating normally.  It might be a good idea to deliberately include a break from the diet, but I don’t want it to happen accidentally — I’m already planning that break for our vacation in Tahiti.  So I need to get through a couple more weeks on track.  Snacking has crept up on me the past couple weeks.  When I started this, I was very rigid about how much I ate, and I drank a lot of water to push away hunger and bored-stomach. Then I added a little more food, because I didn’t want to starve myself and slow down my metabolism, so I started having an apple in the morning, and a little something in the afternoon.  And that’s okay as far as it goes, but I think it opened the doors for mindless snacking to occur. There’s been too many times lately when I just want to sit around and eat. And eat. And eat.  So far I’ve handled it pretty well by eating things like celery, pickles, lettuce, but not always. A few times cheese has snuck in there, Ritz crackers, etc.  I’m not going to beat myself up for it, but I want to stop the slippage from going any further.  I’m planning on grocery shopping today, and will probably allow myself a small amount of chocolate. Maybe not the almonds, because they’re so high in calories, but a little handful of something. I’ll get lots more fruit and vegetables, hopefully some shrimp, and be back on track.  I’m really happy about how much weight I’ve lost. Just the fact that I’ve lost ANY at all is miraculous to me, but at the same time I’m a bit depressed about how long it’s taking.  I don’t think I can, or want to, eat significantly less than I’m doing now. However, I might be able to trim a little bit and also increase my exercise.  I guess I should start setting fitness goals for myself, as well as weight-loss goals. Just read that on the Skinny Daily Post (hereafter referred to as SDP). Anyway, that’s the key to the metabolism thing, and the key to the maintenance part of the diet — the “after” part. Because I don’t want to be dieting the rest of my life.  Doing a little formatting of my [offline] journal today. Putting my week’s wrap-up in a box, and bolding progress text. Whenever I see something that says “I could button the Measurement Pants today,” I’m highlighting it so I can see that progress DID occur.  I’m going to try really hard to take my “before” picture today. Sigh.  I just hate to do it, I’m so horrified by how I look, I don’t want an explicit visual record of it. Without sucking my stomach in. Without hiding behind something in the foreground. Gah.  9:53 a.m.  I took the Before photos.  Damn. It’s pretty scary. The thing I can’t get over is how big my stomach is. It’s ENORMOUS.  Gaahh.  The other thing that bothers me is my face. I have no chin or jaw or neck anymore.  This is so hard, because I don’t want to hate my body, but when I see how I look I just feel sick.  I need to stop thinking about this.  I need to remember that the point of the Before photos is that I have already lost a lot of weight.  I want to be able to record my progress.  In a couple months I will take photos again, and be happy with how different they are from today’s photos.  And I will realize that in all my photos, fat or slim, I look exactly like what I am: a good, kind, smart, talented, beautiful, happy person.  11:58 a.m. Had the chocolate, and it wasn’t very good.  Without the delicious texture of the almonds, cheap chocolate tastes pretty crappy. Not that it stopped me from eating it. But next time, whenever next time is, I’d be better off to buy a good quality Lindt or Tobler or something, and have Bucko bring me back 2 ounces a week.  In other exciting news, my low rider jeans almost fell down at the store.  I can’t wear them anymore. Hee.  My plan is to go to Wal-mart (maybe tomorrow) and try on a 24 and a 22.  I suspect the 24 will be about right, but I will also buy the 22 for a new goal pant.  I bought a Cooking Light magazine at the store, and am going to read it while I have my delicious lunch of grilled salmon salad.  1:26 p.m. Just did 32 minutes of the belly dance tape. Which is only halfway through, but that’s about what I could handle. Not just because it’s hard, also it’s complicated — the steps become difficult at that point. Anyway, got a hell of a workout. My stomach is killing me!  I’m not sure how to estimate the calories burned. I’m going to say 200 for a half hour until I come up with better numbers.  I like this.  I’m trying to make a giant change in my brain, where I look for opportunities to exercise, instead of avoiding them. That would be an even greater change than the way I eat.  Hard to imagine.  I’m thinking of getting a pedometer (?) — the thing that measures how many steps you take, or how far you walk. Since I currently walk about a 100 feet a day, I’m not sure what that would do for me. But I’m hoping to start walking in the evening with Bucko. It’s a good temperature for it, and it will get us conditioned for vacation a little. Should have started a month ago!  But, better than nothing.  I know I should start walking up the stairs. It kills me to walk up once, I’m not sure how many times I could do it. I suppose I have to start somewhere.  So far I like the Cooking Light mag.  They apparently revamped the magazine this issue to include more entire-lifestyle stuff in addition to recipes. It’s a typical magazine; lots of two-paragraph columns, but that’s what I want in a magazine. I read so many books as it is, it won’t hurt to do some lighter reading. And that reminds me that I want to make it out to the used book store this week and find some books for vacation. In particular some more John D. MacDonald.  I can get them on Amazon for $7, but I’d rather buy a used one for $3 and no shipping. Although - Lucy’s is pretty much all romances these days, which is why I started shopping at Amazon in the first place. I got tired of waiting and hoping for something good to come in. So we’ll see.  2:41 p.m. Cleaned the garage a little more.  It’s not heavy exercise, but it’s more movement than sitting around watching TV.  I remember once, a year or so ago, I suddenly got a burst of energy for a couple weeks in a row. I have NO idea what caused it, but I ran around doing stuff all day. Cleaning, painting, building, driving, everything. I couldn’t believe it. It seemed like “Aha, this is what other people feel like!”  I wish I knew what caused it. There wasn’t any change in my life or lifestyle that I could attribute it to, I supposed it was just some sort of random hormonal fluctuation.  I wish I could have that again.  6:30 p.m. Got in another few minutes gliding with the Bucko. Now I’m starving. I bought chicken wings, which I hope will satisfy my desire for succulent greasy food. I think so.

       6:57 a.m. Sunday, last day of Week 8.  That’s the end of my two month “experiment.”  And I have come in just under the wire, being able to wear the Measurement Pants. So I’ll continue.  Not that there was any doubt, anyway. I realized a long time ago that I was going to do this for a year or more.  I can’t see giving up and resigning myself to more weight gain just because this isn’t going as fast as I would like.  9:32 a.m. Putting on the rubber molding in the kitchen. After that, put the dishwasher skirt back on, the heat register back on, and we’re done!   11:12 a.m. Having myself a little glide. Bucko’s working today at the Sheraton, god knows why. I’m a bit at loose ends, not sure what to do with myself. I’ve got the kitchen as far as I can take it, I can’t figure out the dishwasher, so now I’m having a glide while I watch tv.   3:07 p.m.  Not sure what I’ve been doing today, piddling around I guess. I painted the wall in the garage, which will look much neater.  Packed a little. Had a snack of lettuce salad, and I’m trying not to eat more. I’m a bit peckish, but I have to stop the habit of snacking every time I’m hungry.  I’ve slipped a little bit in the past few weeks, forgeting that I need to break some of my connection with food.  I don’t have to eat just because my stomach feels the teensiest bit empty. Also I want to have a glass of wine later this afternoon, so I need to leave room for that.

       7:55 a.m. Saturday.  Yesterday turned out better than I thought it would. I may even be estimating a little high on the drinks.  I didn’t have anything to drink in the evening — I mixed up a martini, then didn’t want it, so Robert drank it. Hoping I will have a good end to my last week of Month Two.  I’m doing a little minor formatting to the [offline] journal. Adding the date/week in the header.  I’m considering starting a new file when I get into Week 9.  This is 184 pages already.  On the other hand, this ancient version of Word is pretty streamlined, and it isn’t cumbersome to work with the file. And I like being able to search for previous calories. We’ll see.  Adding little red hearts when I do something good. Also put my goals/rewards at the top of the document. Which reminds me that I haven’t bought my Amazon book rewards yet.  In fact, I’m probably nearly at the second goal (size 22), depending on which pants I measure by. Next week I want to go to Walmart, and try on 24s and 22s of the jeans I bought recently — the low riders or whatever they’re called.  That’s what I’ll use for measurement pants to determine what size I am, because it’s that brand of pants that I was wearing a size 26 in.  Okay, here’s what I did: I decided my size 24 reward is the $240 worth of new shoes I bought already, and size 22 will be Amazon books. Because I should reach that goal pretty soon, if not already. Then size 20 will be dinner at Cappers, something that probably won’t happen for at least a couple months. I’m as far away from fitting into the Measurement Shorts as I was last year of fitting into the Measurement Pants.  Although, here is some good news: yesterday I thought the Measurement Shorts were about a quarter-inch or half-inch closer to buttoning. So that should also lay to rest my doubts about whether I am still losing weight. I am, just slowly. And not where I want it the most, around my waist.  I can definitely fit into shirts that I haven’t worn for a year. Also, yesterday I wore the underpants that I had set aside as too small a few weeks ago. They didn’t roll down my stomach. Slow progress, but progress nonetheless.  I’m going to wear my new tennis shoes around the house today to continue trying to break them in.

       8:04 a.m. Friday, Day 54.  Three more days left in the Two Months.  I feel really crappy this morning. Could barely get up.  I’m pretty sure it was the single tiny slice of Domino’s pizza we had at the basketball game. Or the diet coke. I was SO thirsty from it, eventually I woke up and couldn’t drink enough, and couldn’t sleep. So I was up for a couple hours, then eventually slept again, which always makes me feel crappy the next day. Also I am very stiff and sore, more so than I should be from the weights yesterday, which is a sure sign of too much salt, MSG, or some other inflammatory ingredient. I will be very wary of diet soft drinks in future.  However, I am glad that my numbers weren’t too bad yesterday. I decided to eat the rib after all. It’s okay to eat it for dinner, after all that’s what I had for dinner two days ago, I just didn’t want to eat it in a weird emotional storm.  So that was okay, I had potatoes and cauliflower with it, and it let me have only the one useless piece of pizza at the game. And I completely resisted the free ice cream. The game turned out to be quite fun and I’m glad we went. We had quite a little walk from the car to the stadium, and I loved it!  I wanted to walk more.  Wore my new shoes, and they did okay except that by the time we walked back I started feeling a blister on the bottom of my left foot. My feet are a little sore today. But I know that’s symptomatic of new shoes because the same thing happened to me when we went to London, and those shoes ended up being my most comfortable. But if I’m going to take these to Tahiti (not sure) I should start walking in them every day to get them in shape.  Oh, and here’s something else:  I gave Bucko the Girl Scout cookies to take to work. I ate NONE of them.  I love me.  And now for some bad news: we just got a Stop Work on that CoM project. The one I was counting on for some hours this month. That means another month with no paycheck, and our vacation coming up, which means that’s the end of our nest egg.  2:58 p.m. Yay, Daisy came to visit. I had three bloody marys. Yes, I know that’s a lot. However, it happened at lunch time, so later when I’m lamenting about how much I drank today, we must all remember that it happened over a period of about ten hours.

       6:52 a.m. Thursday Day 53.  Only a few days left in the Two Months.  I am feeling pretty crappy today, mentally.  I slept okay, but had lots of sad dreams. I feel like I’m not losing weight anymore, and I’m worried about money. Work was supposed to pick up this month, and it hasn’t, and now it looks like the bulk of the project will occur while I’m on vacation. We’re not broke yet, but it’s starting to make me nervous.  I don’t know about the not-losing-weight thing.  I keep wavering about getting a scale.  I know it’s not a good idea, but I’m having a hard time finding any measurement device that I trust.  I guess nothing is going to give me consistent results all the time. Like today I can barely take my ring on and off.  So I feel very fat. But I know it’s from working on the floor — my hands are swollen.  I have to keep reminding myself.  Yesterday I tried on shirts that I haven’t worn in a while, and was thrilled to see that I can button some of them now.  So I’m not necessarily losing weight where the Measurement Pants are tight.  Still, I don’t think I’ve lost any more weight since about Week 5! Nothing has become any looser since then.  Well, I have to get through this week.  Then MAYBE I will go weigh myself at the doctor’s. Maybe.  Did much better with food yesterday, although I didn’t exercise at all.  Still, I ate somewhat when I wasn’t hungry, so it’s not an unqualified success.  But I’ll take what I can get (you see how pessimistic I am today).  Reading the Skinny Daily Post, and got some motivation back.  I know what I need to do. I need to exercise more. And vary the exercise. More strength training.  What I don’t need to do is eat less.  I don’t know if these bloggers realize it, because we’re all too close to the subject to see ourselves, but whenever one of them eats too much for a week, they lose weight.  So today, I will do the glider/weights routine. That’s killer. And since I’m pressed for time, I can get a good amount of exercise in 20 minutes.  The thing is, when you’re dieting and exercising to lose weight, you have to be really focused and establish strong habits. You can’t let yourself off the hook, you have to make sure you don’t allow any exceptions.  That discipline causes you to settle into a pattern, which allows your metabolism to adjust, which means you don’t lose weight.  Maybe I can do this the smart way, taking advantage of everyone else’s experience, and vary my exercise and calories from the beginning. Almost the beginning.  Keeping a close eye that I do ENOUGH exercise and don’t eat TOO MANY calories, but make sure it’s variable.  Yeah, that’s easy to do on the high calorie/low exercise days!  In other positive news, the kitchen is almost back together. We had an issue with the refrigerator water line leaking, so that delayed us a bit.  Now I’m out of nails to put the molding back on.  I guess all told this little project will take us six or seven days.  8:44 a.m. OK, got in a nice workout.  I’m feeling better.  I need to be drinking more water, too. There’s no doubt that dehydration doesn’t improve my mood, and I haven’t been drinking enough.  Now, even though I want to sit here and type some more, I need to go get a shower and get on the road.  3:19 p.m. Oh, and by the way... I AM WEARING THE MEASUREMENT PANTS TODAY.   YES YES YES YES YES YES YES.  4:28 p.m. Here’s something really weird. Just talked to Bucko on the phone and he reminded me that the employee appreciation night basketball game is tonight. I SO do not want to go. But I kind of have to, because he wants to so much. And I mean, I really don’t want to go. Anyway, as soon as I hung up from him I thought: I must have that leftover pork rib. RIGHT NOW. I must have it.  I went so far as to open the frig and take one bite. Then I caught up with myself and said, What are you doing?  What is this rib doing for you?  And my brain tried to come up with excuses like, There’s only going to be hot dogs and crap to eat at the game, so I need to eat dinner now. Which is not a bad idea, but I don’t need to have a pork rib! At 4:28.  I could wait an hour and have a salad or the rest of the cauliflower or something like that.  Thank god I didn’t go for the girl scout cookies. I was planning on allowing myself two, but when I saw the calorie counts, I put them right in the freezer, and I will put them right into Bucko’s car, and tell him to take them away and never bring them back.  That’s not how I want to waste my calories.  I’d much rather just have a candy bar. So anyway, I was apparently reaching for that rib to have a pleasant experience to counteract the unpleasant one.  That’s bad. But I caught myself, and managed to put the food back (it’s really hard to set down food once you’ve picked it up and especially if you’ve had a bite). A narrow escape.

       6:33 a.m. Wednesday Day 52.  I ate SO much yesterday for dinner that I almost decided to just put 4000 calories in my chart and leave it at that.  I wanted to avoid the horror of adding up the numbers.  But glad I finally did. Not only is it way under 4000, but I want to continue with my non-lying streak.  Last night was the first time since I started this diet that I’ve gone back for seconds at dinner.  I really don’t know what sparked this. It’s not like I was on a mad eating binge, I just ate somewhat larger portions than usual, and I quit halfway through the second plate — realized that I didn’t need to eat it.  So...  I’m not really beating myself up for it, maybe I just needed an emotional, mental vacation from the diet.  That’s fine, and today I will re-commit to what I’m doing.  I have become a tiny bit slack, so I will gently nudge myself back in the right direction.  I’m just a little confused where this came from.  It’s not like I had a big-ass craving working itself up (which I have experienced a few times) that simply needed to explode in a pizza.  This was out of nowhere.  It was a very small binge, but the reason I’m giving it so much attention is to figure out how and why these things happen, so I can avoid them or minimize their effect on my eating.  I’m looking back over my entries for the past week, and I see that I’ve been eating over-salted food, I’ve been stuck in the house for days, I’m bored, the kitchen floor has been a frustration, I have my period. Last night was our first home-cooked meal since last Friday.  I guess all those things could add up to a little binge.   So, I’m back on the horse today, and re-commiting to this.  I will have my soup for breakfast, and a lovely salmon salad for lunch.  I will exercise.  I will write in my journal.  It will all be okay.  10:20. Shit.  I have done NO exercise yet today, and have drank no water.  I’ve been surfing the internet mindlessly.  For no good reason. What the heck is with me?  Apparently I need some sort of kick in the behind.  Well, I’m on my way to Home Depot, perhaps on the way I can revitalize myself or something.

       7:07 a.m. Tuesday, Day 51.  I can hardly type this.  I have two cuts on the end of each middle finger, from something sharp under the dishwasher. I was sweeping out underneath for putting in the tile, and encountered something that gave me what amounts to a large paper cut. Twice.  I’m going to buy the rest of the tiles today, but I’m not sure if I will finish the job. My hands are the most sore, I doubt I can work the utility knife well enough.  8:59 a.m. Decided not to buy the tiles today. It’s snowing again. And while there is probably a window of safe driving conditions, I simply cannot face going out into the cold and cleaning off my car, and then a 20 minute drive to the store.  So I’m going to stay home and get in an hour on the glider. I haven’t been exercising enough recently, and I need to stretch out all my muscles after yesterday. Maybe I can also clean up the house a bit.  We’ve got the stove back in place, so we can cook (yay) but the frig is still in the drawing room.   9:30 a.m.  25 minutes on the glider, and my feet are in agony. These new tennis shoes don’t seem to be working out well.  I can’t tell if they’re going to feel better when they’re broken in a little. Whatever, I’m going to have to put on my old shoes to finish gliding — I can’t do any more with this going on.  9:51 a.m. 40 minutes. Can I stand another 20?  Oh, I so want to let myself off the hook, but I keep thinking how good I will feel if I do 60.  I guess I just need a little break between sets. Watching the new Dr. Phil Dysfunctional Family. My god those people are fucked up. Way more than the first family.  It makes me feel a lot better about my own life and marriage.  Whatever little issues we have, I never have to feel that Bucko is working against me or that he wants anything other than the best for me.    10:28.  OK. 60 minutes. I’m beat.  Here’s some positive news — when I woke up this morning and found that I was fairly stiff and sore (big surprise) I noticed that I had no problem walking down the stairs.  That used to be a big deal for me, even on an average day I had to clutch the banister and be very cautious.  Since I’ve been exercising I haven’t had problems with my heels, and the stairs are easier. Going up them is still difficult, but my knees are behaving better. So there’s some great progress, no matter what the pounds are.  12:08 p.m. I’ve decided to give myself the day off, to some extent. Not regarding food and exercise, regarding everything else.  I need a break. Having decided that, I have no idea what to do with myself. If I get bored I’ll want to eat. But I don’t have the energy to start any projects.  Maybe I can just sit and read, something I rarely do any more.

       7:14 a.m. Monday, Day 50. First day of WEEK EIGHT.  Ladies and gentlemen, that’s TWO MONTHS on a diet/exercise plan that I wasn’t sure I could maintain for two days.  And I want to point out that I think I may have lost more than the nominal 9.5 pounds.  My pants almost fell off me yesterday. As in, almost slid down my stomach, past my hips and butt, and onto the floor.  That’s progress. As always, I am hopeful that this week will go better than last week.  Last week was not bad, the numbers came out better than I expected each day. But I’m slacking a little bit with the exercise. I’ll work on that this week, but off to a bad start today with my glider buried in the dining room and no where to put it — the house is still torn apart.  Hoping to get the tile done today. It could happen.  The floor is levelled, so now I have to scrape off the ridges and prime it again. That will take 2-3 hours. Then I can start laying tile.  I’m a little nervous about that, because once they’re down, they’re down!  So I have to be careful to do it right.  I’ve figured out the center and where to start them, so that part is done.  It shouldn’t be difficult from here out, it’s just a little scary.  10:15 a.m.  Got the floor sanded and primed. So now in an hour or two, I can start laying tiles!  Not only am I anxious to see it done, I want my kitchen back. I can’t go another day eating fast food. Even that Wendy’s salad was a bit of a problem.  I’m obviously retaining water today, my face is all puffy, and it’s 2-3 days into my period, not the right time for that. Also I want to note that sanding the floor was a significant amount of exercise. Sure, it was all upper body, but I was sweating and my heart rate was up. So it counts.  I’m thinking about two things today: weight loss surgery and the stereotype of the jolly fat person.  That stereotype still exists, though I don’t think it’s all that strong anymore.  I’m wondering where it came from, and it occurs to me that probably in earlier eras, when plentiful and nutritious food was harder to come by, maybe fatness was seen as a positive, an asset. Maybe fat people were assumed to be jolly because they were in fact happy. They had attained an enviable degree of material success, and the evidence of it (the weight) was not despised either as a symbol or as itself. What’s not to be jolly about?  Now weight loss surgery... what the hell is with WLS?  It’s all I see on television these days, especially on the so-called Discovery Health Channel, which should be renamed the One-Continuous-Commercial-For-WLS Channel.  I admit up front that I don't know enough detail about WLS to have an informed opinion about it. But I have a bunch of questions.  In addition to the ethics of the issue, there are a couple things I don’t understand about WLS.  It seems that the traditional surgery is to reduce the size of the stomach until it’s tiny — I guess there’s a couple ways to do that.  The person then can eat very little, and rapid weight loss ensues. My questions are: what happens after the person loses all the weight?  And they can still only eat 500 calories a day?  Do they starve to death?  During the diet, how do they absorb enough nutrients? Contrary to popular myth, you can’t survive indefinitely on fat stores. Doesn’t such rapid weight loss put as much, or more, stress on the body as being fat?  Wouldn’t it be smarter to achieve a much slower weight loss, the traditional one to two pounds a week?  Is this surgery actually enabling weight loss, or is it simply enhancing the SPEED of weight loss?  I guess I can understand a doctor saying, You MUST lose this weight or you are going to die.  But I don’t understand WLS as the solution. If the person’s health is in jeopardy, then the stress of a major surgery and then the rapid weight loss is too dangerous to subject them to.  Surely starting a moderate diet and exercise program will do more for their overall health, starting immediately, than a surgical solution that actually jeopardizes their health for some period of time (not sure how long recovery period is). At any rate, there’s no way I’m even remotely interested in WLS, and I fit the criteria for getting it. Do you people realize I need to lose 152 pounds to fit my so-called normal weight?  And a slightly less shocking 110 pounds to fit my goal weight?  As they say, that’s a whole other person. That’s a serious undertaking, but there is just no way I would consider WLS. I might be very fat right now, but I’m also very healthy. My only health concerns are the greater RISKS involved — I don’t have anything wrong with me right now.  12:57 p.m.  I have a couple rows of tile down — it looks great. My knees are killing me! It’s a bit tricky to keep them straight (the tiles). The tiniest deviation shows up. Trying to do my time card right now while I eat lunch. That damn server so slow, it takes me about 20 minutes to open and sign. Feh.  5:58 p.m. Well. The floor is nearly done.  I am about 16 tiles short, so it will have to wait until tomorrow when I can run to Home Depot.  I haven’t the energy to do it now.  I am EXHAUSTED.  My whole body is sore, and my knees in particular are suffering. Not just from the getting up and down, but the kneeling on them. Also my wrists and fingers, from cutting and holding myself up on one hand while kneeling.  I am going to be sorry tomorrow!  I can’t tell how much exercise this was, because although I am sore as hell, it’s not the same kind of sore as from weightlifting or gliding. It’s more injury-sore than exercise-sore.  I took a couple aspirins, and ate a quarter-can of soup. I am ravenous, and Bucko will not be home with dinner for at least an hour. Another night of no-cooking; he wants to leave the applicances alone until tomorrow morning, so the tiles have time to “set.”  We’re having Quiznos, so it won’t be a low calorie day for me.  It just occured to me that I should use Bucko’s ice-water thing from his knee surgery. Unfortunately, we don’t have any ice! The freezer water is disconnected. I just put in an old fashioned ice cube tray, hope it doesn’t take long.  Now I’m going to get a nice book from upstairs, assuming I can get up the stairs, and sit with frozen peas on my knees. Ah, I am a poet.

       8:27 a.m. Sunday, Day 49.  Not very good numbers yesterday, hope to do better today.  The kitchen is all torn apart, so unfortunately we’ll be relying on restaurant and fast food at least for today, and possibly Monday.  We got about half of the bad spot cut out of the floor. It’s very slow going, that RotoZip tool is not beefy.  However, so far it’s looking like we’ll be able to replace the floorboard in a small area and be done with it (keeping my fingers crossed).  I truly hope to get all the priming done today. In a perfect world, we’d get to the tiling also, but I know that is unlikely...  So I slept poorly last night.  I felt a little oversalted again.  I suppose it could have been the pizza, but I ate that so early in the day I wouldn’t suspect it as the main culprit. Perhaps the french fries, then.  I haven’t eaten something like that for quite a long time either. Anyway, I was very restless and waking up every 30 minutes or so.  Got a couple solid hours at the end, so I’m not doing too badly today. Must make sure to drink enough water, though.  9:42 a.m. Tick tick tick.  1:14 p.m.  We’ve got the bad piece out, and a new subfloor piece in!  Now it’s a matter of finessing the 1/4” top layer — a lot of sanding and chiseling to make it level with the existing floor. Oh, we’re so close, so close.  What a giant pain in the ass it’s been.  Bucko is working like a dog, and I take back all the ungracious thoughts I had. We’re both feeling happier now that the gaping hole is covered. And by the way, of course we found more extensive rot in the sill joist or whatever it’s called, but that’s a problem for another day.  My plan right now is to get this damned thing done, send Bucko to the store for provisions (possible snow tonight) while I re-clean and prime the floor. I don’t know how much I’ll be able to get done today, at a minimum I wanted to have it primed, levelled, and primed, ready for tiling tomorrow. In a best case scenario, we could get enough tile laid tonight to put the stove back in. That would make a huge difference in our living arrangements for the next few days.  It’s a little frustrating right now, because there’s nothing I can do while Bucko is tweaking the last layer.  I can’t clean the floor or start priming or anything like that.  I’ve put away as many of the tools as possible, but that’s about the extent of it.  Man, I can’t believe how long this has taken to do.  We’ve got about 13 hours in it right now, of which probably 8 are simply dealing with the hole.

       7:44 a.m. Saturday, Day 48.  Let me tell you, that pizza wasn’t worth it.  It sucked, and it was massively oversalted, which I can really feel today.  Dammit, when I splurge on some greasy tasty calories, I want it to be good!  What a disappointment.  I feel like crap today, from the salt and also from the wine.  A sad result from my high-calorie day. Sad.  We’re planning on doing the kitchen floor today. That will be a huge amount of work, but I’m really looking forward to it. Bucko is less enthusiastic  Reading the Skinny Daily Post as usual this morning.  I have gotten a lot of good tips from her page.  9:57 a.m. We’ve got the kitchen emptied out, and Bucko has gone upstairs to get dressed before we move the stove and frig. So it’s going a little better than I expected, but slowly.  I had dreams of finishing the whole job today, and I don’t think that will happen.  I am famished already, no doubt due to the empty alcohol carbs, and have eaten two pieces of the foul pizza.  Bucko ate the other two. So at least it’s out of our lives now and we can move on. It will be hard for me to have a low-cal day with such a bad start, but at least I will be getting LOTS of exercise today and need the sustenance.  12:07 p.m.  It took all this time to get the appliances out, and now we’re removing the moldings. Then the cleaning of the floor. Then the priming. Then the leveller coat. Then another priming. THEN we could do the tile. So I think we’ll be tiling tomorrow.  Then it will be Monday, and Bucko will go back to work, and we’ll have stuff strewn all over the house and no moldings or baseboards in the kitchen. See, home improvement projects ARE fun.  6:48 p.m. No, homeowner projects are NOT fun. We found an area of completely rotten floorboard. It’s like dust.  We have to replace it, if anyone stepped on it their foot would go through. So had to run down to Marella’s (40 minute trip) to get Jaeger’s RotoThing tool, chat with them (30 minutes), come home (40 minutes), pick up spare bits and plywood at HomeDepot (20 minutes), come home and fuck around with testing the tool and making tiny baby cuts in the floorboard (1 hour).  So now it’s almost 7:00 p.m., and all we have accomplished is to make one small useless hole in the floor.  Do I sound crabby?

       6:32 a.m. Friday, Day 47.  Had great numbers yesterday.  I keep trying to remember if I didn’t eat more than that, but I can’t think of anything. Excellent. Also managed another 10 minutes on the glider in the afternoon.  Feeling OK this morning. I got up a little early, maybe, but I slept a lot better than the previous night.    I think I have accidentally done some things right on this diet.  I was watching that woman (country singer?) on Oprah having a trainer and chef figure out her diet plan, and for the first month they just wanted her to start exercising and get her metabolism up before she started dieting.  I inadvertently did that myself — I started exercising every day, on the stair stepper, back in December or November, I don’t remember exactly.  I didn’t diet until December 29.  Today I need to paint the red wall by the office (so the painters won’t have to give it several coats), clean out the baker’s rack so we can remove it from the kitchen so we can put the new floor down, do the bills so I can transfer money into checking, and something else that I’ve already forgotten. No, wait — it’s that I need to take “before” photos of myself. Like in a swimming suit. Oh yeah, that’ll be fun.  I’m also two days away from remeasuring my various parts with the tape measure. Hoping to see progress there.  Other things, if I have time:  - sort through binders on office shelf and discard or consolidate.  - clean off shelves in dining room.  - remove curtains on plant shelf.  - hang curtains in office door.  9:26 a.m. Did 30 minutes on the glider, and five of that with the resistance set at the lowest. Holy cow, I could hardly move my legs.  It’s good, though, because it will help with muscle building, not just cardio.  1:08 p.m. I got a bunch of stuff done — painted the office door, cleaned off the shelves and moved the baker’s rack stuff there, packed the stuff in the baker’s rack, cleaned and packed a bunch of tchochkies (NO idea how to spell that)... I’m tired but happy.  3:44 p.m. I tried to take my Before pictures, but couldn’t figure out how to put the camera on timer or remote control.  The whole experience was kind of disturbing. Not the camera, me.  I put on my black swimming suit from a couple years ago, and was so sad at how fat I am.  I look fatter than I’ve ever been.  I don’t know if I really DO look fatter, or if my perception of myself has changed, or what.  It might be that I’m really looking at myself now, or it might be that I expected a much thinner person.  It might be that I’m getting saggier because I’ve lost weight. I don’t know, but it sucks.  At least, however, I know I’ll still be plenty fat when I do get the photos taken!  Here’s another unrelated item. I think I have been slightly overestimating my martinis. I made one and then poured it into the measuring cup. It’s the tiniest bit over a 1/4 cup, which would make it less than 3 ounces.  A cup is 8 ounces, right? Half of that is 4 ounces. A quarter of that is 2 ounces. Add a touch more, and you get 3 ounces. 3 ounces times 65 calories an ounce is 195. With three olives is 18 calories.  So 213 total. Take off a smoosh for the “not quite” three ounces, and you get a nice round 200 cals. That’s what I’m going with.  And in very related news, I am definitely allergic to vodka.  One drink and my nose is stuffed up.  6:22 p.m. Having pizza tonight!!! Can’t wait.  Two 10-inch pizzas, I’ll figure out the calories tomorrow.  Going to be high, but I feel like splurging. Also Daisy called. So good to hear from her. I miss her terribly, I’ve felt completely unanchored since she left.

       7:15 a.m. Thursday, Day 46.  Didn’t sleep well last night.  I woke up around 1:00, and was awake until at least 2:30, and had all kinds of squirrely work thoughts.  I think it was from eating the red grapes right before bed. I shouldn’t eat before bedtime anyway, and maybe all the sugars weirded me out.  So yesterday wasn’t too bad, I came in pretty low. Good, to help balance Tuesday. I’m glad I decided on that high-low pattern, because now when I have a large day I don’t feel so horrible, I just think “have a low day to balance it.” Today is the lecture on abstract art, and we might have snow.  So far it’s rain, but they’re saying it will turn to snow eventually. Plus I’m supposed to go to work today. Feh.  7:35 a.m. It’s snowing. Hard.  7:48 a.m. Now it’s sleet. Whatever.  One of the things I woke up thinking about this morning is my fear that I’m not still losing weight.  I haven’t been able to get a really definite milestone. The Measurement Pants are cursed, and my next session with the measuring tape isn’t for another four days.  And the funny part: I don’t really feel like I’m dieting anymore.  I have adjusted to this, and it seems normal.  Oh, now and then it seems like a great deprivation, when I’m craving something greasy and salty and oily. But those cravings go away in a couple minutes. So now I feel like I won’t lose weight because I’m not dieting anymore. But I’m NOT eager to start eating less food to “feel” like I’m dieting!   I also want to write about why I think this will work This Time.  Daisy asked me that, and I wasn’t sure I had an answer. I realize it’s several things, in no particular order:  1. I am being brutally honest with my food intake, and also simply accepting the fact that I will have to eat less to lose weight. In previous attempts, it’s not so much that I swept a lot of hidden calories under the carpet, but I really felt I wasn’t eating too much, so I wasn’t terribly concerned about a few calories here and there falling off the record.  And I still say, No, I wasn’t eating “too much.” Not by any reasonable standards. But dieting for weight loss is not a reasonable standard, and this time around I’m willing to do whatever fucked up thing I have to.  2. My level of stress is MUCH lower. I rarely go in to the office any more, and that reduces about 98% of all the stress I experience.  Less stress equals better hormone chemistry, which equals less retention of weight. Less stress equals greater ability to stay on a diet and exercise program. When you’re super-stressed, it’s just too much to add on deprivation and punishment, which is probably how I will always view diet and exercise.  3. I have a much better body image than I used to, believe it or not. I simply no longer hate myself for being fat. I hate BEING fat, but I don’t hate myself for it. It’s not my fault.  I’m not evil, stupid, lazy, gross, characterless, despicable, whatever because I’m fat.  Neither am I viewing myself as a victim — I DO take responsibility, but not blame, for being fat and for changing it.  4. In a more concrete aspect, I am drinking a lot of water and exercising much more consistently. Longer workouts, harder workouts. I have always tended to cheat on exercise because I hate it, much more than I ever cheated on food, and this time I’m not letting myself off the hook.  8:30 a.m. I can tell this isn’t going to be a wonderful day for me.  I don’t think I’m going to exercise this morning, I don’t have time. Well, let me amend that to 10 minutes on the glider, which is better than nothing, but that might be all I get done today.  I’m just feeling a bit under from the lack of sleep, and I need to get out to the museum a little early because of the potential snow. Yes, and this is minutes after I wrote that I don’t let myself off the hook with exercise. Hee. But I want points for putting in my 10 minutes when I really really really don’t feel like doing it.  9:16 a.m. OK, I guilted myself into 20 minutes on the glider. Yay for me.  3:10 p.m. I picked up a little sushi dish at the supermarket on the way home from stupid work, and it was delicious. It’s cold and gray out, but fortunately no snow. I am glad to be home and cozy. Daisy sent me an email so now I am happy.  Making my own southwestern chicken soup this afternoon. There are five of my standard bowls in the whole batch, so that would be, per serving: 1 bowl homemade soup:	171	calories; 9 grams protein;	129.4	carbs; 2.9	fat; 4.4 fiber.  I’m a bit disappointed with the high calories, but I have to suppose it’s because my soup has less water than the canned soups.  There is much more solid food in it.  I guess I could water it down a little. Nah.  Here’s another little hint I read today: drink hot beverages between meals to keep hunger down. Especially green tea.  5:57 p.m. Here’s some interesting news.  When I tried on the Measurement Pants this morning, I ALMOST decided to wear them today. Yes, I’m that close. They’re still too tight across my lower stomach, but if I wore a long shirt they’d be OK. I decided not to because I didn’t want to stretch them out and thus lose their Measuring properties.  Also because whenever I finally see Daisy I want to wear them in victory. So we are making slow but sure progress there.  Then, for further amusement, I just now decided to go try on all the pants in my closet. Here’s what I found: I fit into all the size 24 pants with no problem at all (excluding cursed Measurement Pants) AND I ALSO fit into all the 22s.  They were slightly snug but not unwearable. You know what that means. It means I’m probably a size 22 now, or very close to it.  I was going to go to Walmart tomorrow and buy the next size smaller jeans from last time, which would be a 24, but now I’m thinking I might buy a 22.  If it doesn’t fit immediately, it will soon.  Also, I now have new Measurement Shorts.  These are shorts I fit into (barely) seven years ago when we went to Disney World. They are size 20.  Now I can’t even get them closed. Not even if I laid on my back and exhaled.  I pulled them as close as I could without really squeezing my stomach and measured the gap between button and buttonhole.  It’s six inches. Now, everyone remember that, because in the coming months when I complain about how I’m not fitting into those pants, we will be able to measure the Gap. These are not stretchy pants, so if that gap lessens, then I’m losing weight.

       6:42 a.m. Wednesday Day 45.  Before anyone says anything to me about the huge amount I drank yesterday, I want to say two things: 1) I know. I KNOW. 2) at least it was over many hours. All the wine was in the afternoon.  I have a novel new theory today.  I think I might be allergic to alcohol. Heh.  But really, I think I might be.  For this theory, I have three supporting arguments. 1) When I drink, my nose gets stuffed up. 2). They say you crave things you’re allergic to. 3). A food allergy can account for the bloated stomach, and alcohol’s one of the only things I’ve had regularly enough to be a candidate for allergy. So it’s not that crazy a theory. What I’m going to DO about it is a whole different question.  Today I am also thinking about the idea of eating my main meal at lunch.  That will be a little hard to work, because I generally cook dinner for Bucko and myself, and that’s where I spend the time in the kitchen. I don’t want to do that twice a day. Perhaps I can keep the same meal times, but make the change in portion size. An idea, I keep it on ice for now.  9:39 a.m. I am annoyed with the Boca Burger.  I didn’t check the numbers on the “chicken” version, and it’s TWICE what the “hamburger” version is.  I needed to supplement my soup this morning, since I ate some of it yesterday afternoon, and I thought a Boca would be good. Damn! I’m already a hundred calories more than usual.  Did 30 minutes on the glider interspersed with 5 minute bursts of weight lifting. Very exhausting. Wore my new shoes, and I need to break them in, they weren’t entirely comfortable. Also, told Bucko about my diet last night. In great detail. I couldn’t shut up. Yes, I’ve turned into a fanatic.  11:39 a.m. I’m waiting for the paint guy to come and give us an estimate, and I feel at loose ends. Not sure what I’m going to do today. Maybe paint the entrance to the office — it’s such a dark red they would have to do several coats to cover it. It will be cheaper if I do that myself.  It’s supposed to snow 2-4 inches tomorrow, which sucks ass because it’s the lecture on Abstract art at the museum.  I don’t want to miss that, but no way am I driving around in snow. Feeling a bit peckish, because of boredom, so I had some pickles and a breath mint. Yum.  I don’t record the pickles because they are basically zero calories. My ring is much looser today — I guess I’ve stopped retaining water. Also it’s cold today, that always makes my fingers shrink. Or maybe I’ve lost more weight. I am thrilled with being able to pull my pants down without unbuttoning them, so I do it constantly. At home. Only at home.  3:09 p.m. I made new sugar this afternoon and sugared my legs. I tried Marella’s suggestion of spreading it on the cloth, not on my skin, and it worked pretty well. Next time, I will try spreading it while hotter (and thinner), letting it cool a bit and then putting it on my legs.   Here is a post about Syndrome X and PCOS. http://skinnydaily.blogspot.com/2003_03_19_skinnydaily_archive.html

       7:18 a.m. Tuesday, Day 44.  I wonder if/when I will stop numbering the days like that. Maybe never, it’s kind of interesting to see “where I am.” Now that I’m realizing this isn’t going to stop after two months, I even more want to know how many days it’s been, because it will feel less like floating in a huge formless void of food deprivation.  On reflection, I have to say I haven’t been feeling deprived lately.  I have two reasons for that: 1) I’m getting used to this diet and 2) I’m eating a little bit more than I did the first two weeks. Which tells me I need to put more effort into maintaining the mindset. Last night it was very hard to have only one serving of salmon, and I almost succumbed to snacking. I felt a little hungry or maybe bored after dinner, and I had a tough time explaining to myself that I couldn’t really be hungry right after eating that much food. So I drank some water, which is my usual weapon, and it did work. It was kind of a close call, though, because it was a craving for that mindless eating for entertainment and sensory input. That’s a behavior I can’t afford to fall into.  I’ve still been good with maintaining my [offline] charts. There’s one day (Sunday) that I ate three Ritz crackers and didn’t put them in.  It’s not that I’m hiding it, but I swear I just didn’t have the energy to refigure all my numbers for the week. So I’m letting myself have that one.  I might eventually go back and recalculate.  Felt very cold last night in bed, I had to get two extra blankets. I read in Skinny Daily Post that you will feel colder as you lose weight. I wouldn’t have thought I’ve lost enough for that to happen, but on the other hand I may have lost a lot of FAT if not pounds, and that would have an effect. Either that or it’s for some completely different reason!  Here’s what I would like to do, in my pretend-perfect world.  Have the patience to get through Week 8. Visit Daisy’s house and weigh myself. Find that I’ve lost another ten pounds. Go out and purchase my own scale. Be patient enough to use it no more than once a week. Be able to track my weight and thus my goals and rewards. Because I’m really feeling the need to reward myself, and yet I haven’t even reached my first goal (fitting into the Measurement Pants).  I know I have lost weight, but apparently those pants have some kind of curse on them wherein no matter how much I lose they will always be too tight across the belly.  A piece of good news: I notice I’m not having that double-boob situation with my bras anymore. You know, when the cup isn’t quite big enough and you sort of blob out over the top. Yep, the boobs are always the first to go. Maybe I’ll be able to fit into that 2x sport top I bought a couple years ago. THAT would be nice.  I’m not using any tops for Measurement Garments because I don’t think it will be at all accurate — as I gain and lose weight, the boobs kind of change position on my body, and thus chest measurements are useless.  I’m a bit sore today from TotalGym yesterday, so that’s good. I think I am concentrating too much on upper body, but with my bad knees it’s very difficult to do any lower body work.   9:30 a.m. Just did a stint on the glider and then immediately ate a second breakfast of salmon and snow peas. Which were supposed to be for my lunch.  I don’t know what happened, but suddenly I was RAVENOUS. Not like peckish or bored-hungry, but seriously starved and drained of energy.  Not sure what’s behind that, but I’m going to listen to what my body is saying (EAT EAT EAT) and accept it.  I didn’t feel like I wanted to binge on candy or chips or something like that, so I’m going to assume it was a legitimate message from my body saying “I need more fuel.”  I should now be approaching the Period, and if I am not mistaken, last month I was quite hungry then. So that might be a normal part of my rhythm; I might need more food the week before.  12:24 p.m. Well, I had quite the wonderful morning. Finally went to the Wide Shoe Warehouse, and every single shoe in there fit me. I had to limit myself to four pairs — three for vacation and one exercise shoe. It was WONDERFUL. Oh yeah, and I spent $230.  I suppose some people might not consider that a lot, but I have never spent that much on mere shoes before. Heck, I have never spent that much on CLOTHES before. THEN I went to Target and bought TWO little nighties for vacation, and a new suitcase. $68. Then I made myself go home before I spent more.  I am sort of horrified by how I look in the sexy nighties, but believe it or not, I am (at least at the moment) mature and smart enough to say “You know what? It doesn’t matter how YOU think you look. Your husband will think you look MARVELOUS and that will carry the day.” And he will. He’s wonderful. Oh and then some perverse instinct made me try on the Measurement Pants, and I do believe they are the tiniest little bit looser. Oh yeah. I’m having a glass of wine to celebrate. That’s my rationale, and I’m sticking to it.  5:09 p.m. Just finished the daily conference call. What a pain.  Oh well, it’s a billable hour.  I just now got hungry, so I had a little bit more soup.  I was a bit worried about eating my lunch at 9:30 in the morning, but apparently it tided me over quite well. Found an interesting neighborhood today, must show Bucko this weekend.

       7:17 a.m. Monday, Day 43.  First day of Week Seven.  I have GOT TO do something about my back.  I wake up every night around three, and toss and turn after that, trying to get comfortable.  I switch from one side to the other every 15 minutes.  I can’t sleep on my back, because my throat closes and I can’t breath. I haven’t been able to sleep on my stomach for a long time, because it hurts. Presumably putting too much pressure on something. I wake up with my neck, shoulders, and upper back burning.  I don’t know whether it has anything to do with the bed or pillows. That’s what I always suspected, but then I read somewhere that it’s what you do during the day that causes back pain at night, not the bed. I dunno.  Maybe it’s all this sitting at the computer.  I’m feeling rather uninspired today.  It’s those damned Measurement Pants. I just don’t seem to be making any progress, but I can’t tell. I took a few measurements yesterday, so I have something else to track. I wish I had done this six weeks ago. Anyway, I don’t know if they’re the typical measurements, but I wanted to measure a place I’m fairly certain I can find again accurately. Like I don’t have much luck measuring my waist — I can’t tell where to put the tape.   I guess I’m also feeling a bit guilty or something for my high calories the past few days.  I need to get over that.  Because I still came in under oppw, and besides I had already decided that it was good to mix up the days. High, low, etc. So I’m doing my usual daily reading of wl blogs, and that helps.   9:46 a.m. Did 15-20 minutes on the TotalGym, and then 30 on the glider.  It makes me a little nervous to not do an hour of gliding, but I can’t manage it after weights. And I can’t ignore that it’s important I do weight training.  So I hope I’m achieving a good balance.  I haven’t varied my workouts as much as I keep saying I will, but have managed to incorporate more weights and the occasional Cindy Crawford.  I want to give myself some appreciation and congratulations this morning and hopefully life my attitude a bit.  I have made such a giant change from six weeks ago.  For instance, I haven’t touched butter once since then. I haven’t eaten any ice cream or Goodberry’s.  I’ve had about a tablespoon of sour cream. Very little cheese.  I’ve had chocolate twice, and in very small quantity.  I sent the bulk of pistachios to work with Bucko when I found they weren’t working out for me.  And most of all, I’ve exercised every day for about three months. That’s HUGE.  I know I have lost weight, it’s undeniable.  I waver about how much I’ve lost, but that’s a detail.  The hell with the Measurement Pants.  When I look in the mirror I can see that I’m thinner. My face is different. My ring fits.  I just have to keep going, and mix up the exercise a bit more. The rest will follow.  4:08 p.m. Haven’t been writing in here much today because I’ve been out a lot and on the phone. Bought the vinyl tiles for the kitchen floor today — they’re gorgeous.  5:17 p.m. Good news bad news. Bad: I’ve drank three glasses of wine on a nondrinking night. Good news: my pants are falling down. Not quite off my body, but they’re sagging down terribly. And I’m tripping over them, because they’re too long now. Hee.  I decided to go back and read Day One. What a difference from then. This thing has been hard to do, there’s no denying that, but it’s sort of funny how trepidatious I was.  6:35 p.m. I need to make a little note to myself here, and I need to read it and BELIEVE it tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. This is the second day in a row that I’ve had fish with soy sauce. It’s salty.  I’m going to retain water. I’m going to be puffy and swollen, and my measurements aren’t real. So no Measurement Pants, no ring, none of those games. And by the way — we’re moving into Bloat Days anyway. So don’t be trying on clothes until AFTER. Okay?  Just remember this, to tide you along: today you pulled your pants all the way down without unbuttoning them. Yes.

       9:08 a.m. Sunday, Day 42. Last day of Week Six!    Oh, I didn’t even want to add up my totals yesterday.  Not only the ridiculous amount of alcohol consumed (1232 calories) but I ate more food than I strictly needed or wanted to. Like I ate two pork chops instead of one, and the really sad part is that I wasn’t even enjoying them. They weren’t that tasty, and I was definitely full, and I ate it anyway. And the only reason I ate it was that it was on my plate. It was there, so I ate it.  That’s a big lesson for me to learn.  Well. Today will be a lower calorie day, to compensate for that. Salads and fruits for me today. And water, which I neglected shamefully yesterday.

       6:58 a.m. Saturday Day 41.  I just realized there’s only 15 days left in my Two Month trial period. Now that I’ve had a taste of the scale at Daisy’s, I wish I knew my exact starting weight.  I would so love to think that I’ve lost 15 pounds. Hee hee.  Not likely, but I’m pretty sure I’ve lost ten.  I don’t know if I should start over my estimates assuming a weight of 240.  Probably not, since it’s not verified.  I guess I could drop in at the doctor and ask to be weighed, but that doesn’t appeal to me. I’m so PRIVATE about this, if not secretive. The only person I’ve told is Daisy. I guess I kind of want to have a sudden transformation, a real fairy-tale experience, where I drop the fat clothes and step forth all radiant in my new body. Like no one is going to notice up until that point.  Have no idea if Bucko has noticed. He knows we’re eating differently, but I’ve told him it’s because HE’s too fat, and I think maybe he bought it.  Or he’s letting me have my little secret.  He’s so sweet.  I’m still resisting buying a scale because I don’t want to check it three times a day, and I know I would.  OK, let’s go back to clothing sizes and forget about the weight.  Whenever I’m next at Daisy’s I can use her scale to see if I weigh less than the previous time, whatever the particular number is.  I’m starting to get a little tired of soup for breakfast, so I’m cruising through my journal looking for something with about the same calories that would be enough food, and I can’t find anything. The soup is a really good value. It’s filling, for being so much water.  Guess I’ll stick with it, at least for today.  I’m planning on grocery shopping this morning, so I could pick up something else, but I don’t know what.  Been reading the skinny daily post, and she is stressing the importance of keeping a journal. Well, can’t argue with that. But she says to record not only your food and exercise, but your weight and how you feel that day.  So when you run into a similar sitch you can look back through your records and determine how best to deal with it.  It’s a good idea, and I have already used my journal as a reference. Just not at that level.  9:18 a.m. Feeling very cranky earlier, but calmer now. Probably it was the Quiznos sub. We’re going to shop, take the videos back, etc. Hopefully clean out the garage today. Here’s something that’s been kind of disturbing me — I’m having a hard time sleeping lately because my back hurts, and I can’t get comfortable in bed.  That’s something that usually happens when I GAIN weight. Why is it happening now?  I thought as I lost weight I would become more comfortable, not less. In good news, I tried the Measurement Pants again this morning, and found that while they are still too tight to wear, I am able to button them without much struggle.  They’re too tight in the lower belly, not around my waist.  I think that’s why I couldn’t wear them back when they were nominally my size — they just don’t fit my body right. Because the waist is OK, the behind is OK, but they’re too tight across my lower stomach.  I am annoyed that I’m not seeing more progress with them.  How am I going to tell if I’m losing weight?  It is NOT okay with me to lose a quarter of a pound a week. I’m afraid I really will have to buy a scale.

       7:42 a.m. Friday, Day 40.  So, yesterday. Unbelievable. When I added up my totals, I got 981 calories. Yeah, 981.  I thought, that can’t be right. I must be missing something. No, I wrote down everything I ate.  Then I must be underestimating something. Well, no I used the numbers right from the book and the labels. OK, I’ll increase my estimate of how much olive oil I used. And the artichokes. And still, only 1,061.  Incredible!  What a way to eat. I don’t know why people eat those stupid frozen dinners. You get a tiny block of food, which may be tasty because they’re better than they used to be, but it’s got sugar and salt in it, and half of it’s gravy. Really, the turkey dinner I got was 10 ounces, and I’d estimate 4-5 ounces was gravy. Which you can only eat with a spoon, or sop it up with some bread. Which I didn’t.  I ought to take off half the calories in my chart, because I only got 5 ounces of food.  Anyway, I only ate around a thousand calories, and it was all delicious food. Very happy with it. And for a nice bonus, we’re actually spending less on food than in previous months. For a few reasons — not eating out very often, Bucko is not buying lunch out as often, we’re eating less food, and we’re throwing less away. Before we’d be too tired or lazy to cook, and food would go bad, and we’d throw it away. Bad.  Reading about something called “the Wendie Plan”, a modifed Weight Watchers thing.  The gist is to vary your daily calories throughout the week, so as to shake up your metabolism and break a plateau.  I don’t use points, but I think it sounds like a good idea, I can adapt it to calories.  I think this might be worth considering.  I think I’ve already plateaued. I’m not making any more progress with the Measurement Pants.  So perhaps it would be good to shake things up a bit. AND change my exercise routine. I absolutely must incorporate more strength training.  I did little weights yesterday so I’m not going to do it again today, but maybe I will do something besides glide. The Cindy Crawford workout, or belly dance.   I don’t eat exactly the same amount every day, so that’s good, but I think I do need to make some bigger spikes.  Probably Monday would be good for the low spike. It’s not a drinking day, and I can get it over with early in the week. But instead of my big day midweek, I probably want it to be Friday or Saturday. I mean, those are going to be big anyway.  I do want to introduce the concept of varying amounts of calories over the course of the week or month. Something the person said on the website is that it doesn’t make a difference what you eat in a single meal. It makes a difference what you eat over 21 days. So that’s another good reason to not freak out at one or two days over the goal calories. As long as you get back on, it probably does better in the long run.  9:58 a.m. Did 20 minutes of Cindy Crawford, and then 10 minutes of glider. That’s all I could manage!  Maybe I’ll be able to do more this afternoon. And before I forget, I’m going to go start the timer for my water right now. I didn’t drink enough yesterday.  11:02 a.m. Here’s a couple interesting things:  I think the Measurement Pants are a tiny bit looser today. And also, my face looks different. And thirdly, I’m sick of water. Bleh.  2:22 p.m. I have been in a two-hour conference call and I am exhausted! And cold and hungry.  God, what a waste of time.  Anyway, here’s my plan for today: I am going to have one martini whenever I sit down for the day (4-ish), and then two martinis tonight, with an optional vodka and soda. I know that’s four drinks, but they’re spread out pretty far, so I’ll allow myself that.  By the way, I have written 153 pages of this journal. About 112 of them are in the last 8 weeks. I can tell this is going to be my high-calorie day, which seems to follow my pattern. I’ve already ate 547 calories, and we’re going to get Indian food for dinner, plus I will have drinks.  I’ll just try to keep it reasonable.  6:10 p.m. Looks like we’re getting Quiznos.  I’m making a guess about the calories, because they don’t disclose any info except on their low-fat subs (bastards).  I think I’m overestimating, so all good there. Bucko is late tonight, and I’m starving, and I’m probably going to have a glass of water now, and then a bloody mary (fewer calories than a martini).

       7:12 a.m. Thursday, Day 39.  Well.  I’m sure excited today.  It’s been a good week so far — I came in under ttpw two days, and mostly there’s the exciting news of yesterday’s scale adventure.  I didn’t have time to write about it much, I got home late and Bucko was ready to chat, but I did manage the time to put in my chart and write the great news.  Feeling pretty good today, could have slept more. I had an actifed last night, on account of all the smoke, and those really put me out. But I needed to be up early today to get in a workout before I go to the art museum, plus unfortunately I need to call Crazy Hair. Bah. Anyway, those things make me retain water significantly, so I won’t be trying the Measurement Pants today. I’ll try to save that for the weekend.  Since I’m running a little late, I ate my soup right away, instead of writing in here for an hour, and I’m trying to get in a glass of water before I exercise.  I need to watch some of those movies I rented!  I have two left, and only two days.  8:27 a.m. Did 25 minutes on the glider and I’m exhausted.  I think it must be the salt/grease/smoke of yesterday.  I’d like to get another 20 minutes, but I’m not sure I can manage it.  I need to get ready at 9:00, so better make up my mind soon. I’m watching Gods and Monsters and it’s boring as hell, that’s not helping. I must remember to rent more exciting movies for exercising. Nothing too subtle or intellectual.  I have The Last Picture Show left — yeah, that’ll be great! Not!  Maybe I can listen to music.  8:42 a.m. OK, I got another 11 minutes in.  Let’s call it good and move on.  9:19 a.m. Getting ready to go, and not sure I want to.  My stomach hurts and I feel crappy.  I think it is almost certainly the smoke from yesterday, but I can’t seem to get past it.  I feel kind of shaky. Can’t drink the water because my stomach hurts. I’ve started feeling worse in the last few minutes, so I took a Gas-X in case that’s the problem. I feel kind of like I want to throw up.  12:49 p.m. Back from the museum and so glad I went. Expressionism and the beginnings of Abstractionism. Wonderful.  Feeling much better. Had a lovely lunch of lettuce salad with chicken and artichoke hearts, also delicious. Am treating myself to a small vodka. A sipping vodka. Yeah, I fell off the wagon already.  Let’s see if I can limit it to this one. Had to talk to Crazy Hair. What a tool. It’s 1:36 now and I feel done in for the day.  I might just relax this afternoon, or possibly glide some more and finish that movie.  You know, it occurs to me I’d better start planning some strategies for our vacation. Almost two weeks — how will I keep from overeating?  How will I get enough exercise?  Probably the easiest part will be to eat a small breakfast. That’s what I do now. I eat ENOUGH, but I don’t eat more than enough. 200 calories is enough for breakfast. Then I could probably go for a walk. Plenty of beach. When I get back, a piece of fruit. Then we can go out for the day, which will frequently involve more walking or swimming. And a few days of complete slothfulness. I’ll have to watch out for dinner and drinks, that will be my downfall.  3:00 p.m. and I’m still in front of the computer. Waiting for Boss to call me back. I’ll give him a few more minutes, but then I’m going to glide some more. No, better idea — I will glide now, and if he calls I’ll stop gliding and talk. Duh.  4:47 p.m. Got in another 36 minutes and 200 calories on the glider. Yay.

       6:55 a.m. Wednesday, Day 38.  So, not too bad yesterday.  I kept myself to three drinks, and I put a lot of time between them.  In fact, I felt drunker than when I have five drinks, and I didn’t even want any more.  Maybe I can create a sort of revulsion in my mind about drinking too much.  I was reading on a blog yesterday, she talked about brainwashing herself out of wanting potato chips; she hung up sticky notes saying “potato chips = pain” all over the place, and otherwise repeating that message to herself.  Eventually her brain believed it, and she didn’t crave them anymore. Then she did the same thing with sugar and white flour. I'm not sure I want to go that route! On the other hand, there’s really nothing positive to be said about potato chips, and if you’re hovering on the edge of diabetes, have a serious junk food habit, and need to lose weight, then I guess potato chips are pretty evil.  I just don’t like making those kind of associations with food. Food is neutral, in moral terms. It is more or less nutritious, more or less tasty than another food, but that’s it. So I’m a little undecided. I just want my subconscious to decide something like: “I enjoy having two or three drinks maybe twice a week, or once a week, but more than that is not enjoyable and therefore I have no desire to do it.”  That would be nice. So get to work, stupid subconscious.  I’m planning on not gliding today. Or lifting weights. Or anything cardio.  I feel like my body needs a recovery break.  I might do the yoga tape, which I am miserable at. Baby steps.  Reading a website that gives examples of food portions as common household objects. Like a half cup of broccoli is a lightbulb size.  Am glad to see that I am generally overestimating what my portions are. When I figure I put a tablespoon of butter into something, it’s more likely a teaspoon. Good news.  2:27 p.m. It’s really weird not working out today. I didn’t do the yoga, and it’s made me feel a bit rootless all day.  I’ve been working on cleaning up my studio and the office which is still a giant mess. I can’t believe how much crap we have. Speaking of trash, they didn’t come last week because of the ice, so everyone left their cans out all week, because we assumed they would come later in the week. Nope. Now here it is the next official trash day, and almost 2:30, and they haven’t come yet. Interesting. They’ve probably gone out of business and not bothered to tell anyone.  8:27 p.m. OK, here’s what I want to talk about.  I spent the afternoon at Daisy’s, and planned to allow myself some leeway in the junk food department. When we shopped for snacks at Wal-Mart, everything was so ridiculously high in calories, I just couldn’t do it.  I mean, I WANTED Pringles and Crunch ’n Munch, but I just couldn’t stand the idea of eating 600 calories in one little snack. So I got a WW dinner, and had just a FEW of the delicious taquitos and ginger snaps.  I still came out under ttwp, even with a Coke!  I am impressed with myself. The idea of how bad I would feel about getting behind in my dieting was enough of a deterrent.  Now for the really cool news:  There was a scale in the bathroom.  I decided What the hell, let’s just see.  So guess what it was? It was 240.  You know what that means?  It means I’ve lost AT LEAST ten pounds. Maybe even fifteen.  I know I can’t be too exact with it, because I didn’t know my real starting weight, but the last two times I was weighed at the doctors, I weighed 255 and 263.  I might have even lost TWENTY pounds.  Daisy said the scale was accurate. Can you believe it?  I almost can’t.  I guess I’m not going to believe it until I fit into those damned Measurement Pants.  Which I think I will, by the end of Month Two. Which will be in two and a half weeks. Also please note that I didn’t drink today.

       7:16 a.m. Tuesday, Day 37.  Had an excellent day yesterday. I will attribute it mostly to having a salad for dinner, and being so busy talking to Daisy that I didn’t even finish it. Also, it was a Greek salad with no calories of consequences except for the tiny amount of feta cheese in it. It was mostly lettuce. I might even be overestimating it.  As always, I wish I could be sure something is happening.  I know that I have lost some weight, but no idea how much, or even the time period in which I’ve lost it.  I wasn’t dieting in November and December, but I was exercising a lot, so that might have contributed.  And as always with dieting, I don’t think my numbers are good. Yes, in theory they’re correct, but I don’t think I will lose weight on 1300 calories, I think I would have to eat 800 calories.  So I wish I would get a sign that I could believe and not talk myself out of.  I guess the other depressing part of it is that if I have lost x amount of weight, I’m simply back to where I was a year ago, when I wanted desperately to lose weight.  Every time I gain a little, which I notice by my clothes not fitting, I think “oh great, there’s ANOTHER five pounds I’ll have to lose,” and conclude that it’s impossible, fighting against the tide. Like I can’t lose fast enough to even keep up with the gain. If you see what I mean.  Maybe I’ll just be the anomaly. Maybe I’ll be the person whose weight loss speeds up as they get going, instead of plateauing.  Yeah, that’s it.  I just had a really weird thought.  I’ve committed to doing this dieting thing for two months. And I’m concerned that eight weeks of effort is only going to get me a small weight loss, like five or six pounds.  Then I thought, will I go off the diet in Week Nine, because it’s “not working.” And you know what?  I don’t think I will.  Because I cannot tolerate the idea of gaining back those five or six pounds. I can no longer accept the idea of not being in a state of weight loss, no matter how slow and dreary it is.    This journal is what’s enabling me to keep this up. The only thing is, I’m spending so much time on it I can’t do anything else.  It’s completely taken over my life.  For the past six weeks, I haven’t left the computer for more than a couple hours at a time, unless I’m physically out of the house.  I’ve been writing in it continuously since 7:16 this morning (it’s now 8:43) with only tiny breaks to eat my soup and pee. And surf weight-loss sites.  Well. Let me focus on some good things today.  I went out with Daisy yesterday and ate a salad. Didn’t get the greasy appetizer, wasn’t even tempted. That’s progress, I just reread my previous entry about going to the same place with her and it was a major victory for me that I didn’t eat all the greasy appetizer nor all the salad. And it WAS a major victory, it’s just great that now I can handle that kind of thing without problem.  I can choose the healthier food and not feel all deprived and depressed.  I guess I am slowly cutting the ties between emotional need and food reward. I hope so — at least, I’ve become AWARE of the ties, but if I’m honest I have to say I haven’t done any work toward eliminating them. Perhaps mere awareness is the important part. I think I do need to give myself some rewards, though. Small daily or weekly rewards. Because I’m doing this so much in a vacuum, I’ve got to invent milestones, even if they’re make-believe.  Like when I theoretically lost five pounds, I should have celebrated.  Looking over my previous entries, I’ve been saying the same three — no, four — things since the very beginning. They are:    1. I want and need a valid indicator of progress.    2. I need to reward myself for my efforts.    3. I must drink more water.    4. I must drink less alcohol.  And I haven’t done jack-shit about any of them.  So let’s make a better attempt at all four. For the first one, I will force myself to take my measurements. At any part of my body where I can reliably hit the same place every time, doesn’t matter where. Two, I am going to browse Amazon today for books, and put them in my Wish List. 3. I don’t KNOW.  I’ve tried everything. Well, almost everything. I’ve drawn the line at carrying around a timer with me. Well, guess what — today I start carrying around a timer. 4. God. I don’t know. This is something I need to work on. I have to start thinking — and writing — about what drinking is doing for me that it’s so hard to stop. Because a year, two years ago, I had about two drinks a week. Three or four years ago I had about two drinks a month.   Let’s just continue with that line of thinking right now and try to make some progress here. Part of it, I think, is that I CAN drink more without it affecting me as it used to. Weight and age are probably the culprits there.  Secondly, Bucko drinks with me, and he didn’t used to. He drank even less than I. Now he’s right up there. So we’re enabling each other. We’re drinking buddies. That sucks.  And what’s it doing for me emotionally?  My off-the-cuff answer is that it’s numbing me, making me not feel inadequate or useless or a loser. It’s a happy pill. And face it, I’ve been pretty miserable for most of my life.  I don’t even know what happy feels like anymore.  I’m just gray.  I don’t know what else to say about it — I don’t think the reasons for drinking are very complicated. You feel bad, it makes you feel better.  What will make me not feel bad anymore?  Improved self esteem and success. Which go together in a chicken-and-the-egg manner.  Will losing weight help my self esteem?  I think so.  What would do even more is to sell some furniture, and get out of the horrid, self-hating atmosphere of where I work.  And not allowing myself to tolerate that kind of toxic environment again.  So what will I do for Item 4?  Cold-turkey won’t work, that’s for sure.  OK, I will try to stick to Drinking Days and I will also limit my drinks. Tonight, if we have Drinking Day, I will allow myself two martinis, with an optional vodka and soda. Instead of three martinis and two vodka and sodas. I will also drink a full glass of water between alcohol drinks. OK, that’s a good start. Will revisit this later. But one more pont needs to be made, although we’ve touched on it before: if I weren’t drinking so much, I would be losing more weight. Maybe that can serve as a motivation.  10:06 a.m. Just did 30 minutes on the glider. For the last ten minutes, I alternated with five minute sets of weights. It KILLED me.  I think I’m onto something here.  Perhaps tomorrow I will start doing that from the beginning, the alternating. Also I am carrying the timer with me. I’m on my third glass of water. Yay. Today, I am going to clean up my “studio.”  How can I even consider working when I can’t walk into the room?  I need to think up some places to sell furniture.  I need to get some more stuff into E.G. — it’s better than nothing.  Maybe I can do some smaller furniture type stuff that I can afford a 50/50 split on.  11:02 a.m. The water is helping. That’s probably what I needed to do last week, drink a lot more water.  12:40 p.m. Oh yeah.  I am FULL of water. Very full.  Made some progress on my studio. I got a little sidetracked in that I decided to paint the shelves in the closet, which makes it hard to clean up, because everything on the shelves has to come out of the closet.  I’m doing them one side at a time; tomorrow I will slide the stuff over to the other side and paint the next half.  Had a drumstick for my snack at 11:00.  It’s not a bad choice nutritionally, but I’ll see if I can come up with a more balanced lunch. I’ve been eating a lot of meat recently (o bacon!).  3:44 p.m. I have drank 8 glasses of water. That is 96 ounces of water. 3 quarts.  I think I might burst.  I set the timer for an hour, and drank every time. Plus extra when I was exercising. Enough!  In other news, I am finished painting the closet. The paint really wants a couple days to harden, so hopefully I will be patient enough to let it sit tomorrow, and put everything away Thursday. It could happen.  As far as my other goals, I browsed Amazon a little bit for some books, but didn’t find much. I’ll do it again soon.  I’m not going to measure myself until some of this water is gone. Maybe later this afternoon, maybe tomorrow morning would be better.  Not even going to bother with the Measurement Pants when my stomach is this full.  Also, I think I’m just starting to bloat up a bit. Just a touch...  8:55 p.m. I ended up with three martinis, no vodka and soda. Not bad.  And another random thought: I might have to buy Metamucil or some sort of fiber supplement like that. Not for the bowel aspects, but because I would like to get more fiber than I am, without the calories.

       6:32 a.m. Monday, Day 36.  The first day of WEEK SIX.  A nice fresh week. Hoping it will go better than last week. I barely managed a save on Sunday to stay under oppw.  It helped a lot that I didn’t drink.  However, I did eat two Ritz crackers after I’d done my totals, so I refigured for those this morning.  I didn’t want to, it’s such a tiny amount (32 calories) and I was thinking along the lines of “oh, I can let myself have this just this once,” but quickly came to my senses and nixed that. What the hell am I thinking, let myself have this one?  I mean, I can eat whatever I want, that’s not the issue. The point is that it’s useless to record my food if I’m not accurate. I don’t have any problem with eating the crackers, but I can’t let myself get into that kind of thinking with this journal, because then whose journal is it? Some fictional person who sounds like me a lot of the time.  Watched the Super Bowl yesterday, voluntarily.  It’s the first football game I’ve watched in probably 20 years. Not bad, it was actually interesting. I think it’s because the photography is so much better. You can really see what happens, and the replays are great. I suppose regular games don’t have so many cameras working, though.  And that reminds me, although I don’t know why, that my BRAS are fitting differently. You see, all this time I’ve been concentrating on the lower half, and I forgot that the boobs are the first thing to go. And hopefully also some back fat.  I mean, I am THRILLED to lose weight on my boobs, but I don’t see them as the culprit that my gigantic stomach is. So anyway, first I thought the bra had just gotten a bit stretchy from old elastic, but no, the others are fitting the same way.  I’m buckling them in the middle row, not the loosest row. So yay for me. Or my boobs. Oh yeah, now I remember why it reminded me: Janet Jackson.  9:05 a.m. 50 minutes on the glider, and only 402 calories.  I’m kind of dragging today. I think it was the movie. I’m watching Lovely and Amazing, and it sort of sucks.  It’s about a woman and her two grown daughters, and it’s a total chick flick, but it’s dreary and stupid. The women are so fucking neurotic they’re not amusing.  I cannot relate to a single one of them, even though one is a 36-year-old woman trying to sell her arts and crafts around town. But she’s so bitter and awful and bitchy, even I can’t relate to her. That’s pretty bad.  I’m toying with the idea of putting this diary in reverse order. Most recent entry at the top of the page. I don’t know, it’s a trade-off.  It would be easier for me to search, because most recent food would be close, but I like to read back over the past few days, and it’s easier to do that in this order. I don’t want to get TOO wrapped up in the journal, I spend enough time in here as it is, but I guess I’m jealous of the websites I see. Also I really need to go to the supermarket today, and have zero interest in doing so. It’s so damned far away!  I guess I could shop online, though, and then just pick it up. But what the hell, the shopping part only takes me 20 minutes. It’s the 40 minute round trip drive that I don’t like. I might decide to go to Harris Teeter, which is slightly closer.  10:57 a.m. Yay yay, Daisy called me. Unfortunately she has to go to work today, but then we can go out at 3:30. Can not wait. I am so dying for some social life. I think it has given me enough energy to go to the store. Whee!  1:08 p.m.  Yeah, yeah, I bought more chocolate covered almonds. However, this time I bought the merest handful. A trifle.  And in other weird news, I had two pieces of bacon for lunch. I wanted to get some bacon to have with our shrimp; one piece used to flavor it, split between the two of us, can’t be too bad. And I was surprised that the calories are so low. Well, I thought, this isn’t such a bad deal, I’ll just have a couple pieces with lunch. That was before I cooked it; after I cooked it I wondered how 1.5 linear inches could possibly use up 80 calories.  Apparently I need to buy a higher-quality brand.

       8:25 a.m. Sunday, Day 35.   Yesterday wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be, but it’s bad enough. I only have 1600 calories left for today. I don’t understand what’s gone wrong with me this week.  I’m not going to hit oppw, I might be able to achieve half a pound.  Better than gaining, but I’m sad to have “lost” a week.  Looking back, I can see it was the chocolate almonds and then the pistachios that killed me.  Not just for the calories themselves, but that was the beginning of my desire to snack all the time.  I had to stave that off all week.  I don’t know which was cause and which was effect.  Well, the pistachios are all gone now, so that’s not an issue, and I won’t buy chocolate almonds any more. Maybe when I’ve gotten through two months, or reached some sort of goal, then I will have a little reward that includes chocolate.  Speaking of goals, I wrote earlier that I wanted to set some, and also the rewards that go with. And I am sort of jealous of people’s beautiful web sites. I’m thinking of putting this into html. Is that crazy? Yes it is.  Let’s discuss that later. For now, what about goals and rewards?  The first goal, clearly, is to fit into the Measurement Pants to the point that I’m comfortable in going out in them. That is my initial yardstick, and it will be quite the big deal to me to achieve it.  And what of the reward?  I don’t want to reward myself with food too much.  Maybe just a little bit, like a particular snack.  How about: when I make the Pants, I buy myself about $50-60 of books on Amazon? THAT I would love.  Not sure what the goal would be after that.  Since I don’t have a scale, it’s hard to increment. I suppose I’ll move on to other Measurement Garments.  Like I have some size 9 undies that I can’t wear.  And there’s always my original wedding ring.  That’s about it, though, because I’ve thrown away most clothes that don’t fit.  If I had a scale, I would use ten pound increments.  How will I know when I reach my original goal of 26 pounds?  I can see I’ll need a scale eventually. Which I don’t like. But what the hell, dieting is so fucked up anyway, what’s one more little neurosis added on?  It would be nice to know if this was working. Yes, I know, the Measurement Pants, the looser jeans, the ring, etc. etc., but I have been fooled before.  My calculations say I should have lost about six pounds since I started this, but have I?  Have I lost three pounds? Have I lost ten?  You’d think I could notice a big difference with ten pounds, but honestly that doesn’t show up much on me. So who knows.  This is just so glacially slow that I’m not really sure it’s happening, and definitely I feel like one large meal could wipe it out.  Feh.  This kind of thinking is not helping.  I have to believe this is working to have the strength to continue doing it.  It’s not going to work if I don’t do it (well duh, but you see my point).  That’s why, among other reasons, I stopped reading the FA sites and NAAFA in particular.  I don’t want to identify with people who can’t/won’t/don’t lose weight.  It’s not going to help me.  So, perhaps I’ll base this on clothing size. At the start of this, a month or so ago, I was buying a size 26 pant.  When I can buy a 24 (of the same brand) that will be one goal accomplished. The Measurement Pants are a small 24, so that will serve. Then when I can buy a 22. Then an 18. And on down the line.  I like that, because then I don’t need a scale, but I can see progress.  I think I want to get to a 12.  I’m not sure, because apparently sizes have changed a LOT since I last wore “normal” clothes.  Back in the day, 12 was kinda medium. But there’s been some size inflation since then, and a 12 now fits someone quite larger.  So that’s why I’ll have to wait and see.  I might decide I want to fit into a ten or an eight.  Here’s my list of imaginary rewards (like I’d have the money for this...):  Size 24  $230 of new shoes Size 22  more clothes Size 20		$100 of new clothes, dinner at Cappers	 Size 18		$200 of new clothes	 Size 16		Monty Python video collection	 Size 14		A breast reduction and LOTS of new clothes	 Size 12		A cruise	  I think each of these sizes represents about ten or twelve pounds. And no, I'm not all that clothing-oriented, it's just that I can't think of what else I might want.  I’m very stressed about going to Tahiti this fat.  I’m afraid I will be conspicuous and perhaps people will be unkind.  It’s a beach-type vacation, so I can’t hide in clothes.  I don’t know how other people perceive me.  When I look in the mirror I see someone who is somewhat overweight. No big deal. But when I see photos of myself I am stunned by how fat I am. But other people tell me they don’t see it as a big deal.  Daisy did not believe how much I weigh.  She was very doubtful when I told her. So perhaps I don’t seem as fat to other people as to myself.  At least, I know I LOOK as fat to other people, but they don’t seem to treat me like I’m fat. I don’t ACT fat.  Not sure how to describe that particular idea, but somehow I’ve never accepted the role of being fat. Maybe it makes a difference in the way other people treat me or perceive me.  So maybe I’m worrying for nothing.  I have visions of people actually taunting me and yelling insults.  In French.  I’m terrified.  5:00 p.m. Excellent news — got Bucko to work out with me. We traded off five minutes on the glider with five minutes lifting weights. Almost fun.  8:09 p.m. Hah! Unbelievably, I managed a mere 1240 calories today, for a week’s total of 12,254!!

       6:32 a.m. Wednesday, Day 93. Feel great. As great as I would ever feel before 7:00 a.m., anyway. Too many dreams last night, but I only woke up a few times. Didn’t take any actifed, any melatonin. This morning as I checked the date to put on my journal entry, I realized that Bucko’s birthday is FRIDAY.  Uh-oh.  I don’t even have an IDEA for a gift. Well, I think he was complaining something about his socket set last weekend while installing the new faucet, but I’m not sure that’s something I can pick out for him. I must admit ignorance of sockets. I know he wants to replace the Spyderco pocket knife he lost a few months ago. However... if I’m not mistaken that brand runs close to $200, and we’re a teensy bit broke right now. So okay, I DO have some ideas, but they’re not workable. Maybe I’ll go to Target and browse. Cheesy? Yes. Let that refute the mistaken idea that I’m living the high life — I’m planning on buying my husband’s gift at Target.    Well. I have now read all the Skinny Daily Post articles up through today. Which means I don’t have a giant backlog available so I can read five or six of them each morning.  9:41 a.m. Now I don’t feel so great anymore.  I’m 100% sure this is entirely weather-based, because it’s grey and cold and drizzly today, but I suddenly feel depressed and overwhelmed. There’s so many things to do I can’t pick one, and I feel like I will a) never get the house in shape to sell it, b) never again earn a paycheck, and c) never sell a single piece of furniture or paint a mural again for the rest of my life ever. Ever ever ever. Nevereverever.  Because yesterday went so well, I thought I would be on a winning streak and super productive today. I thought the more I accomplished today, the better I would feel. Now suddenly I’m considering taking the day off entirely, treating myself like an invalid, and doing only self-indulgent activities designed to make me feel cozy and pampered.  So which way should I choose?  The rock-like Puritan work ethic of strength and vitality and self-worth through labor and personal fortitude, or the wallowing in sybaritic excesses flavored with New Age-ish wisps of self-care and mindful soul activity? And can I also point out that whenever I hear the phrase “self-care,” I think of either a) the ability to cleanse one’s personal regions adequately after using the toilet, or b) probably masturbation.  I’m going to take the middle road — I will do ONE thing toward preparing the house, I will clean up my studio, I will go look for a birthday present, and then I will come home and take a hot bath, wax my legs, and spend the afternoon watching The Royal Tenenbaums while drinking wine.  12:43 p.m. Yes, that was a good plan.  I did clean my studio; I packed up two tables and a bunch of pictures and hauled them to the garage; I went to Dick’s and got Bucko a decent knife for $40; picked up three bottles of on-sale wine at Totally Wine; and got him a shirt and some little storage boxes at Wal-Mart. The kind you put screws and wire and crap like that in. He will love them. Now I am home and will have something nice for lunch and spend the afternoon as described, without feeling like I’ve COMPLETELY wasted the day. Also I resisted buying chocolate in the wine store AND Wal-Mart. Points for me.

       7:11 a.m. Tuesday, Day 92. Not a bad night, considering how late I ate dinner (10:30).  That’s the drawback to the Flying Saucer — they haven’t any decent food. You can get oversalted, overpriced bar munchies and that’s about it. So anyway I’m not feeling too bad this morning, considering. My calorie count for the day wasn't overwhelming, either, considering there was beer. 4 beers.  I forgot to do the Monday Measurements yesterday, so I did them this morning. Sort of inconclusive.  I try really hard to get the tape in exactly the same place each time (mostly navigating by mole or freckle) but I can’t seem to be consistent in how tight I pull the tape. It’s too subjective for me to know if I’m doing it the same each time. However, IF my measurements were accurate, then I would have lost 1.5 inches in my waist (in one week? not likely), .5 inches in my upper arm, and gained a quarter of an inch everywhere else. So I’m thinking that’s not very accurate. Perhaps over the long term. Also, have completely forgotten to try the mShorts — Monday is also mShorts day. I’m going to save it until tomorrow. Give me something to do with the huge, empty hours that have become my life.  1:20 p.m. Just back from meeting with GMcN. He was very charming, very kind. I felt quite at ease with him. He seemed to like me and my work, but not quite to the point of commissioning any pieces from me. I am not crushed, however, because I didn't see it as a loss; if nothing else (and it may indeed be nothing else) it was a personal victory for me in being calm and confident and not hysterical when making a sales call on a stranger.  In that sense it went VERY well. What's gotten into me? Driving downtown, being confident around strangers... it's a whole new world.  Also went to the grocery store and then dropped a “congratulations” card at Daisy’s house and hung it on her front doorknob. Today was her first day of a temp job, and I wanted her to find it when she got home and be cheered up after a hard day. As it turns out, she called me on the way home and said she had a WONDERFUL TIME. Apparently when one is a temp, one doesn’t have to manage projects, trawl for clients, and attend meetings and conference calls. Apparently one is allowed to simply WORK, and it’s a couple million times less stressful. Unfortunately, the pay is commensurate.  2:59 p.m. Put in another 30 minutes on the glider while watching the rest of Pushing Tin. Really enjoyed it. Will someone explain to me why Billy Bob Thornton is so incredibly sexy? You know that if you knew someone like him in real life he would absolutely creep you out and you'd assume he slept in the bus station a lot, and he'd ask you out on a date and take you to Denny's and not have enough money for the tip, but then you'd STILL sleep with him (in the back seat of YOUR car because his was "in for repairs" and it would be hot and heavy and probably greasy, and then you'd feel like a total ho-bag the next day. But then you'd think about it for weeks.  You would, wouldn't you?

       7:00 a.m. Monday, Day 91. First day of Week 14. Woke up a bit groggy, but feel okay now.  I had a couple bananas right before going to bed, and as always that disturbs my sleep. Lot of tossing and turning, but at least no long periods awake. Just finished my “chart” for last week, and I’m not sure it makes sense anymore. When I first started doing this, I figured out how many calories, theoretically, I should eat to lose one pound per week (oppw) and two pounds per week (tppw). Divided by seven, and I get a target range of calories for one day. So at the end of each week, I add up how many calories I’ve eaten in the past seven days, and figure how much weight I should, theoretically, have lost.  It’s a crazy system, but I had to have SOME measure of progress, even if it was make-believe, because I simply cannot bring a scale into the house. Maybe someday, but at the beginning of this little project I knew the psychology of the scale would defeat me before I could even get started. It was better, although sometimes maddening, to NOT KNOW if I was losing weight. Then the only choice was to continue the dieting/exercising in hopes that eventually I would get a positive proof. Which psyched me into continuing, to the point where I did one day get proof (the mPants). The scale, you see, would have most likely given me negative proof for quite a long time, because I’d be hopping on five or six times the very first day, and I would have quit trying by the end of the first week.   So anyway, my current chart says that I should have lost 13 and three-quarters pounds since December 29. My original goal was ten percent of my body weight, or around 26 pounds, which means that as of today I have 12 and a quarter pounds left to lose. Well, I think it’s apparent I’ve lost more than 13.75 pounds. It’s more like 25 to 35. I’m not being precise with that because my weights were on two different scales. But that’s the range.  At this point, I now KNOW that I’m losing weight, so maybe I don’t need the Pretend Chart to convince myself that it’s happening. Maybe it makes sense to continue recording my calories, but stop recording the pretend weight.  9:47 a.m. Just did 40 minutes on the glider, and I’m running out of steam. Stopping for a water break. I’m going to put the resistance on and try to get another 5 or 10 minutes — I can’t go very long with the resistance. Watching Pushing Tin, which is very good. I didn’t know what to expect from it, but it has Billy Bob Thornton and John Cusack, both of whom I like, and it’s turned out a good choice. I was so involved in the story I didn’t even look at the glider calculator until I was up to 37 minutes. That’s a first; usually I’m counting the seconds after about 12 minutes.  10:26 a.m. Managed ten minutes with the resistance on, and another ten without. It’s so hard, I can barely move the footholders more than 6 inches either direction. It becomes more like strength training than cardio. I feel like I’m stomping grapes in a barrel, or maybe doing a stair climber. In other good news, I am now on my fifth glass of water already. I know I’ve been dehydrated for a week, but haven’t been able to get make myself drink enough. Had a little lettuce salad for my morning snack, and I’m still hungry and want to eat MORE. I have to reestablish some of the patterns I used at the beginning — drink a glass of water every time I feel hungry; if I’m still hungry after eating, wait 20 minutes before I eat anything else; delay eating by finding something else to do for 15 minutes or so.  12:48 p.m. About halfway through the little box I’m painting. It’s going really well, and I am SO happy to be painting again. My back is killing me from leaning over, I had forgotten about that. Need a better set up. Anyway, the boxes look lovely, and now I’m taking a lunch break. The leftover salmon, I guess.  9:45 p.m. Back from the Flying Saucer. Met Bucko’s boss, Sally, and had a great time. She’s interesting and fun and kind. Good combination. It’s a long drive to downtown, and I am impressed with myself that I had no problem getting there and back. A few moment’s qualm, but nothing major. That’s a big deal for me, because I tend to a certain amount of agoraphobia, which frequently takes the form of being afraid of driving to anyplace complicated or where I haven’t been before. Going downtown in rush hour and having to parallel park is a situation that would normally get me in a cold sweat and I probably wouldn’t do it. But this went okay, partially because I pep talked myself and partially because I was going against traffic and ended up being able to park in a lot, straight in. A funny thing about that: it’s the kind where you have to go to the money-collection box at the front of the lot and put in money for your spot.  It cost three dollars, and all I had was quarters. So I started feeding them into Number 5, my spot. And for some bizarre reason, probably because my brain was all the way filled up with the logistics of driving someplace by myself, I didn’t seem to think it was necessary to make sure I put in the exact three dollars. I just put in SOME amount, which could have been three dollars, but might just as easily have been $1.75.  I dunno, it was some sort of mental hiccup where apparently I thought it was okay to just make the GESTURE of paying for the spot.  We got to talking about it over beers, not the hiccup part, but how do those places work? Does anyone actually count the money or do they just peer out a window somewhere to see if you go up to the money thing and pay. So when I got out to my car, there was in fact a guy opening up the money things and checking whether everyone had paid. Paid the right amount, in fact, I’m guessing. Fortunately he had started at the other end of the lot, and I just squeaked out in time. I think he gave me a LOOK as I peeled out of the lot, probably he had just opened up Number 5 and found a SHORTAGE. Hah! Once again I’ve managed to stick it to The Man!

       7:31 a.m. Sunday, Day 90. Feeling good today. I pretty much slept right through.  That is, I know I woke up a few times, but only for a couple seconds. That’s phenomenal for me. I’m glad I started tracking how I feel each morning, because hopefully if there’s a pattern to my good/bad times, I’ll be able to look at the previous day’s entry and see if there’s anything that might be a factor.  Had a nice time last night, but a little disappointing. When we got to Capper’s, it turned out they were having problems with some sort of burst water pipe, and the restaurant was closed. Bummer for them!  So we toddled on up to Portobello, which is our favorite restaurant, for drinks. And it was fine, but of course there’s no live music, and sitting in the restaurant drinking just isn’t the same as sitting in the bar drinking. Why?  I don’t know. Just one of those things. At any rate, it’s a pleasant place to be, so I can’t complain, and I had only two vodka and sodas, so my total yesterday was 2137. Not good, but not a major, diet-ruining excess either (I shoot for between 1300 and 1800).  For some reason, when I woke up today I immediately walked into the closet, in a hypnotized-robot-like trance, before I even peed or anything, and tried on the Measurement Shorts. I pulled them on, zipped ’em up, buttoned ’em. Just like that.  They ALMOST fit.  They’re about where the Measurement Pants were, when I would say “Well, I could almost wear them except they’re too tight and ride up my butt and it would look tacky.”  So I’m making progress, my weight loss hasn’t stopped since vacation.  I can’t predict how long it will be before the Measurement Shorts fit; with the Measurement Pants, it was exactly one month from “almost fit” to “wore them outside the house.”  And also I’m tired of typing “Measurement.”  From now on, it’s “mShorts” and “mPants.”   1:12 p.m.  We’ve got the “rock” border done around the mailbox, and also planted the petunias. Looks pretty good. The rocks are more plastic-y looking than I remember them in the store, but maybe when the flowers grow in, they will seem less glaring. Also got the rest of the wallpaper border in the office primed. We’re planning on driving around this afternoon looking for houses. Not sure where to look, it seems to me we’ve covered everywhere interesting and/or possible. So many times we’ve seen a modest little house for sale in what appears to be a modest little neighborhood, and I jump out of the car and grab the sales brochure, only to find that the 1500-square-foot built-in-1960 house is going for $355,000.  Prices are so relative to an area I guess that number doesn’t mean anything on its own. For comparison, we hope to sell our built-in-1990 house for around $210,000.  And we were crazy enough to hope we could buy something smaller for LESS money. Not MORE money.

       7:57 a.m. Saturday, Day 89.  I feel pretty good today. Had a solid eight hours sleep. Took an actifed last night to counter the effects of Daisy’s cats, and of course that always makes me sleep.  Bucko brought home a Wendy’s salad for me, and I ate that and then pretty much immediately fell asleep on the sofa. Perfect ending to a picnic-lunch-sit-in-the-sun day.    So many things to do this weekend, I don’t know where to start. Bucko’s plan is to install the new kitchen faucet, and water the front lawn so the fertilizer can sink in a little. We also need to finish painting the wallpaper border in the office; put up the new border; paint the hallway, downstairs bathroom, and living room wall; paint the trim in ALL the rooms except the kitchen; go grocery shopping; balance the checkbook; get mini pine mcnuggets for the front walk area; arrange delivery of pinestraw for the entire yard; get some sort of edging to go around the mailbox area and also plant something there that might actually survive; drive around and find a new place to live.  11:09 a.m. Making small progress. Bucko is working on the faucet right now, and I’ve got the hallway and living room wall painted. Starving, had the last bit of turkey lunchmeat and swiss cheese. Too early for lunch, so I guess it’s a large snack.  2:30 p.m. Back from Home Depot. We've got the edging (fake rock, very groovy) and a bunch of petunias. Also dirt. The faucet is done (yay). Also picked up chicken wings to cook for dinner, to satisfy my craving for salted grease. There's a few drops of rain, so we probably won't have to water the lawn.  7:20 p.m. Getting ready to go out to Cappers. I’m a little disappointed with my numbers today.  I’m eating too much.  It’s not way out of line, but I’m not staying within my goal.  I need some sort of mental kick in the butt to get back on target.  I’m at just over 2000 calories now, and I’d still like to have two drinks and share a dessert at the restaurant. Which will put me at around 2600, and that’s WAY too much. Well, here’s what I’ll do: stick to vodka and sodas, which are only about 65 calories each. That’s not too bad.

       6:27 a.m. Friday, Day 88.  Man, I slept awful (awfully?) last night. And I took a whole melatonin.  Just tossing and turning, waking up a lot, and DREAMS. Far too many dreams with too much detail.  Something about filming an aerobics video on a beach in Israel, while our house was being secretly made over by a team of television producers. And then about surfing. We can see by that I’ve been watching too much TV. My back hurts this morning, I’m so stiff I could hardly walk down the stairs.  I want to give a little explanation about my life, because of a comment someone made to me about my journal/blog.  I know it sounds like all I do is have lunch with friends, drink, and shop. Well, not true. First of all, I only have ONE friend, not friends plural. Heh. Anyway, I’m not sure that particular lifestyle needs a defense anyway, but I want to explain that 1) I have a job, 2) but I mostly work at home, 3) I personally consider that a blessing and a luxury, though some people hate it, 4) my job is part-time and inconsistent because there is no longer enough work to support me (and other employees) on a full-time basis (we’re talking recession here, people), and 5) I am also developing a business and freelance work on the side.  For some reason I don’t want to be perceived as an idle, wealthy woman who lunches. I’m not sure why, and perhaps I’ll delve into that sometime, why I feel the need to explain my situation, but in the meantime I am reporting that No, I don’t have that kind of life. I’m very grateful to be getting by as well as we are, but we’re not rich by any means.  I’m currently in a situation where I hate my job (oh, boo-hoo for me), so it just sounds like I don’t work because I don’t like to write about it.  Wendy on girliness: http://www.poundy.com/journal/06-01/6-27.html  And a Progress Point to report:  I have been able to SQUAT recently. Yesterday when I was leaving the post office, I dropped my keys on the ground. And I just squatted down and picked them up, and kept walking. I was in my car driving away before I realized what I had just done.  I’m not even sure how I did it — was it a one-knee or two-knee squat?  I know I didn’t stumble on the way back up, and there was nothing for me to hold onto while I straightened up. I just did it, and kept on walking.  5:51 p.m. O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay! Listen: I just got back from Daisy’s house, and amongst other things, I weighed myself on her scale. Because I don't have one. 41 days ago I weighed 240; today I weighed 225. That’s 15 pounds in 5 or 6 weeks.  I am ECSTATIC. There can be absolutely no doubt that I’ve lost weight. It’s irrrefutable.  IF her scale is accurate, I have lost 35 pounds since I started in December. But whatever, even if her scale isn’t accurate, I’ve lost 15 pounds since the last time I’ve weighed myself.  So it’s POSSIBLE.  It’s possible that I can lose weight. It can really happen. Who would have thought?? Color me smug.

       6:10 a.m. Thursday, Day 88.  I woke up very early this moring (5:09) but I’m feeling good.  I went to bed early, so even getting up at The Crack, I still got 7 hours of sleep. Took half a melatonin, I think maybe I need to take an entire one for it to be effective. I did manage to not eat anything else yesterday, for an astounding 1022 calories. THAT’s not going to happen very often, but I’m glad to get a super-low-cal day to compensate for all the high-cal ones.   10:11 a.m. Finished an hour of glider, and watched most of Chocolat.  I have some thoughts about it that I will get to later. It’s pretty good, but apparently I have some sort of limited attention span, or movies tend to get dull and meandering about 3/4 of the way through.  I’m ready for it to wrap up. Maybe some movies don’t introduce enough new plot or action in the last half, so I get impatient for something to happen. But not a major criticism, I’m enjoying it.  I would like to say that I LOVE Johnny Depp. I love his roles, too. They're always a bit outre.  My only issue with him as the leading male fantasy of my life - his mouth. Just a little too small, a little too feminine. If Johnny Depp swooped into my life and gathered me up into an erotic sex-fest of all my fantasies come true, would I shrug my shoulders and say "Ehh. I dunno. Your mouth is too small." ?  I'm guessing I could overlook it.  1:42 p.m. Back from the post office, mailed everyone’s vacation souvenirs. Also stopped at the supermarket and got sandwich stuff and salad for tomorrow, in case Daisy and I have a picnic lunch. It could happen. Picked up sushi for myself for lunch today. Now I’m digesting and trying to decide what to do the rest of the day. Probably I should read over that RFP for the proposal. Yeah, and I’ll sit in the sun while I do it. That won’t take long, I could also paint another wall.  6:00 p.m. No wall, but I painted the trim and fireplace in the drawing room (known to most people as a "family room." I just don't like that phrase). Wow, what a difference. I highly recommend that to anyone who wants to spruce up the house — fresh paint on the trim makes a BIG difference. The house looks new again. Talked to Daisy and we’re going to meet tomorrow for a picnic-style lunch on her deck, and hopefully get a little sun. That’s such a GIRLY thing to do, I’m really thrilled with it. Losing weight really is opening up my mind to new ideas and possibilities, even something as trivial as that.  That’s why I identified so much with Ju-Ju’s review of “Passing for Thin.” She says “Frances... fell in for that brand of easy sarcasm that passes for comedy these days... self-deprecating humor, belittling humor... But as the book goes on, as her fat comes off, as Frances becomes more and more exposed, vulnerable, willing to take on and take responsiblity for changing things, she becomes more and more and more genuinely funny, likable.”   http://www.skinnydailypost.com/archives/2004_02_06_skinnydaily_archive.html#000964  Well, okay, it’s presumptuous of me to make the comparison, since I’ve only just started losing weight and no one has declared me funny or likable. But I completely understand where Frances is coming from, as described by Ju-Ju. I don’t use the cynical humor as a defense, as pop-psychology would insist.  It’s not an armor, it’s more like a burden, something I’d like to be able to rid myself of.  But when you’re a fat girl, it comes with the territory. You develop the attitude as a REACTION to rejection, not a preventor of rejection. And I understand the idea of not knowing how to act like a girl.  I mean, one isn't required to fit into a behavior pattern, but being able to willfully and deliberately reject a role is different from never having had the opportunity to try out the role for size. I know my non-girliness as a teenager had EVERYTHING to do with being fat.  Why knows, maybe if I was normal weight, I would still have decided it didn’t suit me for other reasons, but I never had the chance to find out.  7:26 p.m. Doing well with my eating now.  I think I’m back on track after vacation and having the dinner party food around.  The cheese is gone, the ice cream sandwiches, that kind of stuff. The tortilla chips are still here, but that’s not a major temptation to me. After watching Chocolat today, I could definitely go for some good quality chocolate!  Right now I’m at 1390 calories. That’s very good.  I will try to not eat any more tonight, but I might have another glass of wine, and that will of course raise the total. By the way, I’m doing well with the drinking. I resolved to buy nothing but red wine, because I just don’t drink it in volume. So far that’s holding true.  A couple glasses is plenty. I’m pretty much ignoring the concept of Drinking Night. It was a good idea, but it ended up making me drink more.  Scarcity increases value. So when I could drink only a couple times a week, I overdrank. I dunno, it’s some kind of weird mental thing.  I do better if I can just have a glass or two of wine while making dinner.

       7:08 a.m. Wednesday, Day 87.  I feel a little groggy this morning. Didn’t sleep as well as I would like, and had some squirrelly moments around 4:30 a.m., thinking about work.  Talked with Warren yesterday, and he has some proposal work for me around the middle of April, which is nice but not much.  A good post about the book “Passing for Thin,” which also perfectly describes MY personality: http://www.skinnydailypost.com/archives/2004_02_06_skinnydaily_archive.html#000964 I prefer to wait until it's in paperback, but I might give in and buy it now.  8:32 a.m. Had a little roll and butter with my soup. Yum. I’m planning on bellydancing today, we’ll see how that goes! Then in to work to meet with Warren. Oh, THAT will be fun. Maybe Daisy will be there.  2:38 p.m. Yes, Daisy was there, but I didn’t really get a chance to talk to her.  Talked to Crazy Hair, of course, couldn’t avoid it. What a tool. Printed out some vacation pictures to send to my brother. Then off to the video store, because there’s no way I can glide with the crap that’s on television. Had a hard time choosing movies, though, I’m too picky. Of course I was starving by the time I got home around 2:00, so I had an apple and then a tuna salad with a pickle. Delish. I may very well eat the last Skinny Cow for dessert.  7:33 p.m. Home from the wine tasting. The vineyard wasn’t notable, but we bought two cheap bottles from the general stock. Not much in the house to eat, I guess I’d better shop soon, or cook so we have leftovers.  Had two giant plates of salad for dinner. I’ve migrated the balance of the oil and vinegar dressing so that it’s only about a third or a quarter oil - the rest is vinegar, water, lemon juice, and other non-caloric ingredients.  I’m going to try to not eat for the rest of the night, and have a super low-cal (1041) day to get back on target.  We’ll see how it goes; I’ll certainly be hungry tomorrow morning!  So about the food in Tahiti, I never really described it.  Well, first of all, it’s HIDEOUSLY EXPENSIVE.  Apparently the dollar is very weak right now, so we found that even very plain food was out of our reach.  The restaurants at the hotels and resorts were, naturally, very high-priced.  Breakfast or lunch, about $26 a person. Dinner, about $40 a person. And up. That's the basic price, not including drinks or desserts or what have you. We had planned to buy food from shops and eat at local restaurants frequently, because we wanted to have a fuller experience than a resort offers.  And that’s what we did, but it was still very expensive (dinner about $25 each) in restaurants, and there was not much variety in the food. Grilled fish, beef, or chicken. French fries. Bread and butter.  Pineapple, papayas, lettuce, and cucumbers.  That’s pretty much the extent of fresh food in the restaurants. No other vegetables, no carrots, broccoli, zucchini, cauliflower, asparagus, beets, or peas. No beans. No apples, oranges, or pears. Sometimes watermelon, bananas, and grapefruit.  On Huahine, we shopped in the (only) grocery store and bought: 5 cans of beer, a wedge of brie cheese, a loaf of bread, a can of sardines, a can of deviled ham, a box of raisins, a small package of cookies, five eggrolls. Price: $38.  So sadly, we ended up eating a lot of bread and cheese on the trip, and other carbohydrates, because that was the only food available/affordable much of the time. At our last stop on Bora Bora, we tended to eat breakfast at the hotel, where they had a large expensive buffet, so we ate as much as we could so that we could skip lunch and possibly eat a very very small dinner.  That’s not a good eating pattern, and I was relieved to get home and be normal again. That’s not to say I didn’t enjoy the trip, because I absolutely LOVED it.    And, by the way, I wore the Measurement Pants all day today. Yep.  For something that has haunted my past two months, I haven't made enough of a big deal about the fact that I fit into them now. Perfectly comfortably. AND I look good in them.

       6:46 a.m. Tuesday, Day 86.  Feel pretty good today. I slept decently; woke up a few times but went right back to sleep. Also had normal dreams!  I think that’s the melatonin. I’m sore today from TotalGym, and so are my abs. I kept my feet off the platform for some of it, and it works the abdominals that way.  A lot.  Yesterday had much better numbers. I’m thrilled to be below 2k !  And I ate a lot, so I got good numbers and a lot of food.  A reasonable amount of water. I’m gradually working myself back into this. I really really want to start LOSING weight again, and I doubt I’ve done that for a couple weeks.   8:08 a.m. Spilled my soup when I was putting the second half away for tomorrow. I will have a little something extra for breakfast tomorrow. Trying to get some water down; I want to do a nice long glider workout today. I will pick out a movie to watch; there’s no way Dr. Phil is going to entertain me enough. Well, I can check and see what he’s got on, but even the commercials drive me to boredom and make me want to stop.  Plus I sort of hate him.   2:29 p.m. I finally have a blog up and running!  As I knew it would, it's taken me most of the day to get it going, and it's quite primitive. If anyone is reading this, you are probably thinking "But you have entries going back to December..."  Yes, that's because through the miracle of web technology, I am able to date entries whatever I want, so I can put up all my previous offline journal entries. Why would anyone want to read them? Hell if I know!

       7:43 a.m. Monday, Day 85.  Feel okay today, considering I had red wine and wasabi peas last night. Took half an actifed and half a melatonin so I would sleep better, and I think it worked. It was a little hard getting up, but I feel fine now.  My numbers from last week are SO bad, that I’m not even going to spend time bitching about it. It could have been worse, and I’m doing the best I can. So now let’s just move on to this week.  9:18 a.m. Just took my Monday Measurements, and I seem to be down half an inch or so in every measurement except my waist.  It makes no sense - I must have lost in my waist to be able to fit in the Measurement Pants, but it never shows up with the tape. Oh well, I guess that’s why I need several different methods of tracking progress, no one of them works consistently enough. Anyway, good news that I am down in some areas. Speaking of the Measurement Pants, I am wearing them today but they seem a bit snugger than last time. I may indeed have put on a pound, or perhaps my stomach is bigger than usual today.  11:33 a.m. Just back from the dentist. I am so sleepy!  Not sure why.  Also hungry, so I’m drinking a glass of water to try to push lunch at least until noon. Speaking of water, I have peed at least eight times already this morning. Something I ate or drank yesterday must be causing it. Maybe the actifed.  Here’s what I’ve decided: when I can fit into the Measurement Shorts, then I will get weighed and take another progress photo.

       7:34 a.m. Sunday, Day 84.  Well. Since this week’s numbers suck so bad, I will start with the positive things first.  First of all, practically the first thing Jaeger and Marella said to me last night, with no prompting, was “Wow, you’ve lost a lot of weight!  You look great!”  This is very significant, because I had never told either one of them that I was dieting. They just noticed of their own accord.  I haven’t seen them for a while, so they could see the big change in me. Which, by the way, so can I, because we looked at some video Bucko shot back in November, and I couldn’t BELIEVE how fat I was. OH. MY. GOD.  Remember how I said I was horrified about our Tahiti pictures? F**k, no, that’s NOTHING compared to what I looked like in November. Okay, this was supposed to sound positive and it’s not coming out that way, so I want to phrase it this way: I can really notice, myself, how much weight I’ve lost. I’ve become, incredibly, even MORE beautiful than I used to be. I RULE.  And I apologize for that slip into self-loathing. The only thing I hate more than hating myself is when I fail to hate the hating. Yeah, I hate that.  Second good news is that even though my numbers are over my goal, I did quite well with all the massive amount of food last night.  I had a little of everything (actually, not even everything) and I didn’t go back for seconds.  I’m 358 calories over goal yesterday, so I think we can expect I won’t be losing any weight this week, but I am impressed with my ability to eat a 1200 calorie buffet dinner instead of a 3200 calorie dinner.  Which I could easily have done.  Also I think I am overestimating portions and calories.  When someone else cooks the food, it’s hard to know.  So the bad news is that I ate more than I should have.  I can see where the problem was: I had munchie food sitting out on the table for hors d’oeuvres.  Some of it was safe, like the carrots and celery, but the bread and brie cheese killed me.  I had three pieces instead of one.  Also I ate the Skinny Cow ice cream sandwich for dessert. Which is not so horrible in itself, it’s just that I was NOT hungry at that point and should have skipped it.  Ah well.  I guess it’s harder than I thought coming off vacation.  In a week or two, when I feel like I’m back on track, I will go get weighed.  10:21 a.m. Did 25 minutes of gliding, good for me.

       9:12 a.m. Saturday, Day 83.  Yesterday sucked!  Dammit!  It was that stupid hamburger, and everything that led up to it.  The chicken rice soup was too watery and so left me hungry, then lunch was about two hours late so that I was over-hungry and decided it was a good idea to get a giant hamburger. I don’t know what the hell I was thinking. I guess something like “Oh, I can go off plan once in a while. I’ll just eat nothing tonight.”  And of course that didn’t work, because of course I was HUNGRY in the evening. Duh. Just because something has a lot of calories doesn’t mean it’s filling.  So I sat around eating celery and pickles and drinking wine, which made me too drunk and did not appease the hunger at all, until finally I was smart enough to have a little piece of salmon at 9:30, which of course disrupted my sleep and I stayed up too late, got up too late, and now feel kind of icky. And also stupid.  Bah. Okay, time to move on. I know what went wrong and will avoid the situation in future. That means that I will eat enough food, I will not starve myself!  Added about a third cup of kasha to my soup, to make it more filling.  It sure increased the calories, but after yesterday I’m going to err on the conservative side, and make sure I’m eating enough of something healthy so I don’t go overboard and eat crap.  12:55 p.m. Chicken and sweet potato for lunch. And more water. I’m trying to increase my water, which has fallen by the wayside. It will also help with the hunger. I feel like I’m starting from scratch, and having to relearn how to do this. Thank god I didn’t gain ten pounds on vacation.  Although I’m still sort of waiting for the axe to fall, because I figure it takes a little while for the effects of diet to show up, and I might still have an increase over the next week or so. Hope not, but I will TRY not to freak out if I do.  In fact, after I finish this glass of water, I will go glide for a while.

       Has anyone noticed how obsessed I am with Daisy? I know, it's no big secret, she's totally my boyfriend. Or possibly girlfriend. (No, I'm just kidding, we're both straight.)  7:04 a.m. Friday, Day 82. I feel good this morning. I did have some interrupted sleep, but seem to have dealt with it okay.  I went to bed too early, brought on by too much wine, and so I woke up around 2 a.m. I probably could have gone back to sleep sooner, but I got involved in watching a South Park Behind the Scenes show on VH-1, and I was awake until about 3:15.  Then I had a horrible nightmare, with much violence, set in Frasier Meadows. Whatever. So I’m surprised I feel as good as I do this morning. But the sun is coming out, and that makes ALL the difference. Plus I get to see Daisy today. Yay!  11:18 a.m. Okay, I am just killing time until Daisy calls. I decided to get dressed up, since she’s probably in her interview clothes, and I found that the Flintstones Dress is too big.  I really can’t wear it. Hah!  So I am wearing the black linen-esque dress that has a sheer navy blue polka dot duster with it. It’s also too big. Damn, I look good.  6:33 p.m. Well, I ended up wearing jeans and a shirt, but I still looked good.  Daisy had gone home and changed into casual clothes, so I didn’t want to look like a dumbass being overdressed. Had a great time, but ate too much calorie-laden food. We went to Steak and Ale, which of course is very meat-and-potato intensive.  However, I did another 200 calories on the glider, so that will help to compensate. Because I would like to have a little salad or something later, which will probably push me over 1800 calories for the day.  7:58 p.m. Bah.  My numbers are bad. I mean, not AWFUL, I’m only 120 calories over target, but it’s annoying. Jaeger and Marella are coming for dinner tomorrow, which means another day of big calories. I have to make sure to have a LOT of low-cal food around.  I will try to have a small lunch, and eat a lot of celery, pickles, etc. All the no-cal food. But still, I want to congratulate myself on gliding this afternoon. That’s a big change from my life six months ago.  Also, all my clothes are too big.  I had a hell of a time picking something to wear today, because everything looked awful. I need to spend some time this weekend altering my clothes. Put in darts, increase the seams, that sort of thing. Hee hee, that’s great. Today for the first time I could really see that I’ve lost weight. I could look in the mirror and see a difference. Very exciting.  I still feel a bit “off” since we’ve come back from vacation — since I couldn’t track my food well, or eat well, or exercise well, I feel a bit shook up.  I’ve gotten back to my routine pretty quickly, but I don’t feel ensconced in it yet. It feels almost like at the beginning, when I was very tentative about the whole thing.  I imagine I’ll be fine by next week. In good news, we’re hearing that the CoM project should start up again any day.  I don’t have a huge amount of hours on that, but I think I ought to get maybe another 40 or 50 over the next month. That’s a lot more than recently, so that’s good.  I enjoyed the belly dancing today.  It’s still hard, but it felt a little more normal and less strained. Maybe I wasn’t trying so hard.  I look in the mirror some while I’m doing it, to try to maintain form, and I think I strained myself a bit last time, trying to look like those girls. My body is just not going to look the same as theirs when I move, and so I probably forced it too much.

       6:54 a.m. Thursday, Day 81. Feel pretty good.  I took half a melotonin and it kicked my butt.  I’m going to try it for a while, a few weeks at least, and see if it improves my sleep. I think it will; so far when I’ve taken one it hasn’t prevented me from waking up, but I’m only awake long enough to get up and pee, not two or three hours. Big improvement. Also my stomach hurts today, and my back. I suspect I must have slept weirdly. Also the lack of exercise is catching up with me. Will try to glide/lift weights today. And I want to report a progress point (and this is in fact unrelated to my back hurting today): I can now sleep on my stomach. I haven’t been able to do that for months. Yipee.  8:43 a.m. Did 20 minutes of gliding, with 10 minutes of the resistance on. Man that’s hard! The calories burned show up less than usual because I’m going slower, but I’m pretty sure I burned at least as much as gliding at the regular setting. Also did two 5-minute sets of little weights. Now I’m starving and I’m going to finish the cauliflower. The sun is almost out today, and I’m feeling a bit better than yesterday.  2:39 p.m. Never mind, I am NOT feeling better than yesterday. The sun lasted two seconds, and it’s been gloomy and rainy all day. Also Daisy cancelled on me, which I pretty much expected, but I’m still disappointed. Now we’re planning on meeting tomorrow for lunch, which will probably be more fun and a nicer day. But it wreaked havoc with my mood today. I forced myself to call E.G., and Liz wasn’t in, and then I forced myself to call G.McN., and I got his voice mail.  I’m trying to psyche myself up to call him again, because if I don’t do it soon, then I won’t. I actually called and hung up before it rung twice, because I have no idea what I would say. My brain is numb. This is so not normal. It’s not normal to have so little energy and such inability to cope with things like a mere phone call.    2:45 p.m. OK, I psyched myself up for another call and got the machine again. Didn’t leave a message. I feel relieved.  5:33 p.m. Making a delicious dinner of salmon; sweet potato, onion, and green pepper sautee; and devilled eggs. The eggs are mostly for Bucko, since he loves them, but I just ate one. Or two halves, that is. Not bad, but I put in too much mustard. You know, I have been wondering about the “Points” system in Weight Watchers.  It doesn’t seem accurate enough. I mean, if it works for someone, then I’m not criticizing, but for me it seems too general. On a lot of blogs, people talk about a particular meal they had that was only X number of points, and they’re happy about how little it is, and yet it’s something that I would never eat at all. Because it’s too high in calories, fat, or sugar. Or all three. So I wonder how WW figures the Points. Maybe I'm not allowing myself enough leeway. What I would love to do, with an unlimited budget and a personal chef, is figure out three weeks worth of menus, and then just have the food served to me. No balancing as I go, compensating for this and that... of course I know that wouldn’t work, because I would feel more snacky one day than another, or crave a particular food, or whatever. Can I say something that really disappointed me about Tahiti was the food. Because although I planned to eat reasonably, I also planned to have some wild days. And most of the time that wasn’t possible. It was too expensive! And most of the time we couldn’t find very good food anyway. The hotel in Bora Bora wasn’t bad, because at least they had sushi, but it wasn’t notable. The breakfast buffet was okay, because I could get fruit, but they only had two kinds, pineapple and papaya. Which I like, but it’s not like that’s a feast of fruit, you know? They had more variety than the other hotel, but it wasn’t really tastier. On the seafood buffet night, they had a lot of seafood salads made with MUCH mayonnaise. So I didn’t have a lot of that, but I did have THREE lobster halves and about 20 skewered shrimp. Yum. So I guess I can’t complain too much about that meal. But oh man, I missed salads and vegetables. Almost non-existent on the islands.  6:47 p.m. Wow. For some reason I really pigged out at dinner. Ate about twice as much as I intended, and I’m really full.  I’ve done well otherwise since I got home, so I hope this is just some aberration while I get used to my diet again. My numbers don’t come out badly, but still I’m not happy that I overate.

       6:37 a.m. Wednesday morning. Feeling pretty good, considering I am about four hours short on sleep. I’m trying to get back on normal schedule after all the travel and time difference.  What I’ve decided to do is count the days during my vacation, but I doubt I’ll go to the trouble of logging the food.  I wasn’t able to keep accurate enough records to make it worthwhile.  I will put in summaries for the weeks, with average calories, and that will be close enough.  They will be HIGH calories, because I would rather err on the side of more than less. Don’t want to fool myself that I ate a proper amount of food, ‘cause I didn’t. However, I tried on the Measurement Pants first thing this morning, and they still fit comfortably. Not quite as loose as the first day of vacation (I even wrote on my postcard to Daisy that they were baggy) but only by a slightly perceptible amount. So that’s a great relief and I am very pleased that I didn’t gain weight with the large and not-so-wonderful food I was eating (more detail about that later).  I think my diet can tolerate, and even benefit from, a week off plan, but more than that is iffy, and of course I need to get right back on. Exercise today will be difficult, since I’m short of sleep, but at least I’m eating right again!  I want to mention that it was VERY difficult not having this journal available for 10 days.  I wrote in my little notebook, but it just wasn’t the same.  9:42 a.m.  So.  I am at a loss about what to do.  My stomach feels like hell again, and I’m tired and unmotivated. I checked my email and voicemail at work, and there was nothing. I really need some hours, or I have to find a new job. Like right away. Of course I am not at all thrilled about that. Nor am I thrilled with the idea of trying to drum up some mural/furniture sales. I want to give myself today off, to readjust and recuperate, but I’m afraid I’ll find a reason to do that tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day. Bah.  1:37 p.m. Talked to Daisy and that helped, I feel a bit cheered up. Also she gave me permission to slack off today, and that’s just what I needed. I did attempt to call Liz at E.G., and of course she doesn’t work today, but I am impressed that I made the effort. Right now I’m uploading some Tahiti pictures to my [other] web page, so everyone can see them.  I have mixed feelings about how I look in the photos. As always, I am absolutely horrified at how I look. But I think I can see a small difference. Not enough, certainly, but there is a change. And once again I am horrified at how large my breasts are. I look like a freak. That’s my next big goal, the breast reduction. Can’t WAIT. It’s sad to think how little of my life has been documented in photos, because I avoid the camera so much. There are almost no photos of me from about 25 years old on up.  3:39 p.m. Yay, I managed to do a little glider. It was hard to get motivated, but thinking about how I look in those photos helped. I don’t like the self-loathing implied there, but at least I don’t feel desperate or sickened. I think it was just a cause-and-effect reaction: I saw that I am too fat, so I exercised. I’m also eating well and drinking water.  I hope after a good night’s sleep tonight I will feel more energetic tomorrow. I did my Monday measurements today, since I was traveling on Monday, and the results are erratic. Gain in some places, loss in others. Phooey.

       2:33 p.m., Tuesday. I’M BACK.    Well.  I’m planning on entering some sort of information for each day I was gone, but will probably do that over a period of time. For now, my summary is this:  I don’t think I gained any weight, or if so it’s quite a small amount; I got some exercise but not enough; I ate the best I could but the food available often defeated me. Those islands have quite a limited choice of extremely expensive food, so I had to eat what I could get. Which is to say a lot of bread, cheese, fruit, meat, and fish, and not nearly enough vegetables.  I’m not sure yet whether to “count” this period of time in my Day/Week countdown, or view it as some sort of hiatus.

       For anyone who doesn't know - Bucko and I are going to Tahiti, Huahine, and Bora Bora for ten days for our 20th anniversary. We leave tomorrow.   6:04 a.m. Thursday. Feeling good today, despite waking up so early. On the other hand, I was probably asleep by 10:30. Pretty good numbers so far this week. Last night I succumbed to a few crackers, which pushed me over 1400, but still it’s not too bad. Right now I’m averaging 1285 calories per day for this week.  Have I mentioned yet that yesterday I was able to button the Measurement Shorts?  Uh-huh.  They’re still way too tight to wear, but I was able to get the button into the buttonhole. That’s significant. It seems like I lost a lot of weight very quickly, in the past couple weeks. The jeans I bought are already too big, and I bought them only 9 days ago. So whatever I’ve been doing recently is working. Looking back over the last 20 days or so, my calories are good overall, but by no means super-low. There’s a nice fluctuation, which is good. But also I have more varied exercise than when I first started. So I’m going to say that variety, in both diet and exercise, is probably helping a lot.  I don’t really see any difference in myself. I look just as fat, to me.  But, I avoid taking a really good look at myself in mirrors, so I suppose I didn’t have a realistic view of myself to start with.  So I’ve been thinking I won’t have much problem keeping on track in Tahiti. This is just too important to me to jeopardize for something transitory. I can have a wonderful time there without overeating. It’s not a necessary part of the experience.  I mean, I can eat food anywhere, any time.  If I run into something special, something specific to that place, then I’ll eat it. I’m not going to deprive myself or miss out. But if there’s a choice of fruit or fried eggs for breakfast, then I’ll take the fruit.  If there’s a choice of salad bar or genuine Polynesian pig roast for dinner, I’ll take the pig roast. And I’m going to try to walk every day. Deliberate walking, not the meandering through town type.  And I have a new measuring device: the Measurement Belt.  I realized I need a belt to keep my pants up, if I take the size 24s with me. I have only one belt, not sure I’ve ever worn it. Anyway, I had to put a new hole in it, about 1.5 inches away from the smallest hole. So that will be a new way to gauge success.  9:41 a.m. Incredibly, I managed 60 minutes gliding. It was HARD. Just too boring. Feh. Oh well, that’s the last time I’ll be doing it for ten days. Oh my god, we’re going to be in Tahiti tomorrow night.   Today I’m going to wear the size 22s jeans around the house, and see how they stretch out. I’m planning on wearing or bringing one pair of jeans with me, and I can’t decide between the 24s and the 22s.  I want to wear the small size, but I don’t want to be uncomfortable either. But they stretch a lot, so if I wear them for a few hours they might be just right.  I’ve started to accept the fact that I’m losing weight, that it’s actually happening, and just the general concept that it’s possible.  I’m sort of incredibly excited about it, but also it just seems so normal now. It’s just part of life to keep shrinking.  Now that I’m this far into it, it doesn’t seem difficult. Yeah, I know it’s incredible to even say that, but I suppose with most endeavors, getting started is the hardest part.  Practically and mentally.  It’s almost like going through the steps of grieving, or something. First there’s this massive denial, then anger, then acceptance, and then finally looking beyond.  Once you’ve gotten to the acceptance part, you don’t have to keep fighting the initial battle every day. During the denial, anger, and beginning of acceptance, it really is the same fight every day, over and over, and that must be where most people drop it. Because you just get so damned sick of dealing with it.  Weirdly, I haven’t had so much issue with that. I plunged into the journal and the whole experience fully, and that’s helped. I made this my entire life, and it’s working.  Sure that’s unbalanced, but what the heck. That’s how I do everything: drop everything else and focus on only the one thing. So it might not be normal, but it’s normal for ME.   2:47 pm. Just got back from the store. Picked up some water, apples, tuna-in-a-bag, and trail mix for on the plane. I was going to buy a bag of hard candy, but resisted and bought gum instead. You know, I was standing there in the aisle looking at the candy, and I really was going to get some, and then part of my brain said “Why? You don’t need candy on the plane any more than you need it any other time. If you start out making exceptions and allowances to eat crap, then you’ll continue that pattern.”  I’m glad that part of my brain prevailed, because I gave up the candy and bought sugarless gum. That will keep my mouth busy without adding calories.  I did, however, buy us two beers each for tonight when we’re packing. Just enough to relax us a little bit, without having enough in the house to get drunk or hung over.  7:45 p.m. Well. My last entry for 10 days.  I guess I’ll track my food in my little notebook, and try to figure calories when I get back. Or not — I might just pick up again fresh on March 16th.  I am going to miss writing in here. Hopefully I’ll be too busy having fun to think much about it. Bye bye journal, hello Tahiti!

       7:05 a.m. Wednesday. Feeling pretty good today. My last couple hours of sleep were choppy, but I went to bed so early I’m sure I got at least eight hours. Took half an actifed to counter the red wine, and I didn’t drink enough water to counteract them both. Other than that, feeling good, and I’m pleased with the amount I drank for Drinking Night. My new plan is to buy only red wine, and buy only enough for the one drinking night.  If I don’t have it around the house, I won’t drink it. Because I am far too lazy and too self-conscious to go buy it. Therefore, this way I am not relying on willpower, I’m setting up an environment where I can’t drink. I’m having a glass of water right now, with my coffee.  I don’t usually start until after breakfast, but I feel quite dehydrated.  I’m adjusting my estimates for the coffee with Benefiber, because I’m not putting an entire tablespoon in. Maybe two-thirds that.  Note: remember to buy an exercise ball to sit on while at the computer.  5:00 p.m. Had a nice little lunch with Daisy. Ate a veggie wrap and some fries, which I hope I am estimating reasonably.  It was a decent meal, but not entirely filling, so I had a little chicken when I got home.  Now I am finishing up my work emailing before vacation, trying to do my timesheet, etc.  My hip is still bothering me. I’m not happy about that, because it hurts when I walk, and I want to do a lot of walking on vacation. I think the bellydancing may have caused the strain, and then the gliding is exacerbating it. So perhaps it’s a good thing that I’ll be away from the glider for a couple weeks. I can walk and swim for exercise, and perhaps that will work out the problem, whatever it is.

       6:10 a.m. Tuesday.  Feeling pretty good today, although I woke up at 5:30 and couldn’t get back to sleep. That’s only six hours sleep, but I don’t feel too bad. Hungry, though. I didn’t eat much yesterday. I think my calories are so low because I had that rib for lunch, and then around 4:30 I ate the salmon. Never did have dinner, so I did more of the “mini meal” thing, and thus skipped a large meal. Not something I want to do every day, but I’m glad to have low numbers before vacation.  I had quite an annoying anxiety dream about work last night. I think that’s what made me squirrelly when I woke up. It surprised me to even have this dream, it was a combo work/not prepared for the test kind of dream, and I didn’t think I was having any of that type of anxiety recently.  Just had the Manhattan clam chowder for breakfast, and I didn’t like it.  Kind of a musty flavor, not appetizing. Also not enough solid ingredients, just a few bits of potato and carrot. I will be needing a snack later this morning.  1:12 p.m. The painters have been here since about 9 a.m. They’re very nice guys and everything, one of them speaks English, but it’s kind of weird having them around. They’re painting right outside the office, in the foyer, so I can’t just come and go at will without interrupting them.  I felt a little weird about sitting in full sight in the kitchen eating lunch, too, so I just made a quickie salad of leftover tuna and tomato. It was delicious. I offered them lunch, but they had already eaten in their van, so it’s not like they would mind if I ate in front of them, but it just seemed strange. Then I was afraid of what music to pick out, because I listen to a lot of Latin stuff, and I was afraid they’d think I picked it on purpose in some sort of patronizing gesture. And I’m afraid they’ll think I’m just sitting around twiddling my thumbs whenever I’m not actually typing at the computer. I’m hoping to run out for a bottle of wine, but don’t want to leave while they’re here. Not that I don’t trust them, but I guess I’m just weirdly freaked out about having people in the house who are not guests. Then I started cooking dinner at 1:00 because I had to do SOMETHING.    Finally got the airline tickets/flights straightened out. That travel agent is such a waste. I have to call her too many times; she’s simply not proactive at all.    Here’s a random little tidbit. I’m glad I don’t really have a deadline for this weight loss. Because it’s not going to end. I guess I kind of have known that all along, and definitely realized it when embarking on this particular effort. A year ago I wanted to lose weight for the vacation, and I DIDN’T, and so of course I am kicking myself for not finding this motivation a year ago when I really needed it. But what the hell - what’s one vacation compared to the whole rest of my life?  And you know what else? I know they’re talking about me, because I heard the word “computer.”  I imagine the conversation to be as follows:  Painter 1: Do you think that fat gringo woman would have sex with us? Painter 2: Probably. Or maybe just blow jobs. Painter 1: Yeah. Don’t you think she’s the ugliest, fattest, most repulsive woman you’ve ever met? Painter 2: Absolutely. I had no idea American women were so unattractive. And so obviously whorish and lazy. Do you suppose she’s a prostitute for a living? Painter 1: Probably. Right now she’s on the _COMPUTER_, probably surfing the internet for potential clients. Painter 2: Let’s go back to Mexico where the women are all beautiful and decent. Painter 1: Okay.  And just now I distinctly heard one of them say "Paraguay."  I can't even imagine what they are saying about me that concerns Paraguay, but I'll bet there's a brothel and a donkey involved.  A good post about getting fat: http://skinnydaily.blogspot.com/2003_11_01_skinnydaily_archive.html  2:48 p.m. Yay, they’re almost done. I am so relieved. And I want to reiterate that they have behaved perfectly nicely, it’s just weird to me having them here. It’s my mind that is the problem. Oh my god, they just said Paraguay again! What the hell is with Paraguay????  4:22 p.m. Ah, the house to myself.  I ran out and got a couple bottles of wine, and now I am sitting here enjoying a glass all alone in my house. Incredibly, it’s almost dinner time and I have had only 362 calories so far. Holy cow!  Of course the wine will add to that considerably.  But I have a nice healthy dinner planned, of more chicken, that lovely eggplant ratatouille or whatever it’s called, and broccoli.  5:37 Got another 10 minutes gliding in. Not much, but it will help with the metabolism. I rule. RULE.

       7:23 a.m. Monday. First day of Week Ten. Wow!  Feeling pretty good this morning. I took half an actifed last night, so I slept like a frog. Woke up to pee maybe once. My plan is to do TotalGym this morning. Then I have my haircut at 10:00, so I need a quick workout. This afternoon perhaps I’ll be able to work in some gliding — I’ll see how my hip feels.  I’m almost caught up with the archived Skinny Daily Post entries, I need to find something else with hundreds of archived entries I can read from the beginning!  Here’s something I want to say about losing weight:  I am glad I’m doing it, and I really want it. BUT I am angry with myself for not being everything I could be while still fat.  I’m disappointed that I bought into this myth that you have to be thin for anything to matter. Therefore: I must work on being more fabulous NOW.  And here’s the other thing I want to say:  I am realizing that to me, the eating and possibly the weight are all about control, as far as any psychological factors may be involved.  I had a little epiphany about that several months ago, and looking through my journal I see that the only really difficult spot, the only disordered eating event in ten weeks was when I didn’t want to go to the basketball game. Somehow food was a means of taking back control.  More random thoughts: whenever I am “done” with losing weight, I will have to maintain it. I think I need to work exercise into my life in a more natural way. Hopefully, with a lighter body I’ll be ABLE to exercise more. But I’m going to have to do those things like always take the stairs, park far away, get a dog and walk it, etc.  I’m not always going to have the luxury of all day to fit in whatever workouts I feel like.   And here’s another thing. I bought an issue of Shape magazine, and threw it away within 2 hours.  First of all, the “articles” are nothing but prompts to buy products. Secondly, there’s nothing useful in the entire publication. Next to no information. Thirdly, their photography is not consistent with the avowed mission of the magazine. I do NOT want to see underweight-by-30-pounds fashion models pretending to lift weights with little stick arms that don’t have enough muscle in them to lift a fork to their mouths.  Another: maybe I should buy some nice workout clothes instead of the horrible oversized rags I wear now.  12:56 p.m. Well, it’s been quite a nice day so far. 1) the Measurement Shorts are half an inch closer to buttoning. Yep. 2) I got my hair cut and I look great. 3) My measurements are a little tiny bit smaller. I had a great time going to the hardware store and Ace. I looked so good with my hair freshly cut that it gave me all sorts of confidence, and I didn’t want to go home after!  I wanted to stay out and show off. It was such a difference from my usual run-home-as-fast-as-possible self, that I began to get an inkling of how much self assurance I might have when I lose weight. It’s not that I have to look gorgeous, it was the feeling that I was NOT a freak. That no one was staring at me in disgust.  3:13 p.m. Did a little gardening. Nothing all that strenuous, but I’m going to give myself 100 calories. It’s hard work for me, maybe not for someone else. Here’s some fun news. My new jeans? The size 24s? Starting to fall off. Yep.  Daisy is planning to call me at 4:00. I can’t wait. I so want to have a drink while talking to her. There’s nothing in the house except vermouth, so I will have a small glass of that. I can’t overdo it, there’s only a drop left in the bottle. Also going to do a little bit of gliding beforehand - I’m not going to hit my goal of 300 minutes a week at this rate! Not when Friday will be devoted to airports and airlines.  9:16 p.m. Just back from Target. What an ordeal. Mostly bought vacation clothes for Bucko, although I got a new blouse. I had to get a 24; it was a button-down shirt, and of course the 22 was too small in the bust. And the 24 is too large everywhere else. That will continue to be a problem for me no matter what size I am. But that’s okay, because: remember the new jeans mentioned above? I can now pull them down without unbuttoning them. Hee.

       6:37 a.m. Thursday, Day 122. Damn that restaurant! Damn damn damn. Both of us woke up groggy and stupid, with swollen eyes and puffy faces. MSG.  We don’t get it, because Bucko gets lunch at that place all the time, which is why we figured it was safe. Don’t know what happened — they changed their recipe suddenly; they make food differently at night; they used a pre-packaged sauce; it was an acccident (Whoops! I spilled this box of MSG into the stir fry. Oh well.). Anyway, I am very annoyed with them, because I don’t like to be literally poisoned when I eat restaurant food. Come on people, is there seriously any mutant customer on the planet who  wants  MSG in their food?  Had a hard time coming up with the calories. I ate most of a serving, but with hardly any rice (compared to what they provided, which must have been 4 cups per person). I figured all the components separately, and come up with 535 calories, which ain’t bad, and which gives me 1447 for the day.  Much  lower than I expected. I hope my estimate is close — I did it as accurately as I could and rounded up.  So moving on from the Chinese food... talked to my brother a few days ago. He cracks me up. He’s probably the smartest person I’ve ever met, and his conversation is... eclectic.  I grabbed a pencil and wrote down the topics he covered in a 20 minute phone call, although I gave up halfway through. Each one followed logically from the previous, although now I can’t see some of the connections. It's not wild-eyed rambling, though, this was all intelligent, meaningful conversation. Here, then, is a partial list of Jimmy’s Phone Call Topics:     Plumbing*  Labor Unions  Hotels     Jimmy Hoffa  heroin  The Phoenix Project     Conspiracy Theories  Vietnam war  Laos     H&R Block  Carter vs. Reagan  Trickledown economics     Voodoo economics  Carpentry  1000 Points of Light     James Watts and Amway  Deaths at 4th of July Parties  The Beach Boys     Dead people in bushes  Islands in the Stream  Mardi Gras     Class struggle  Robert Heinlein  Sex in science fiction     Conan the Barbarian  Ireland  Swamp monsters     Werewolves  Gollum  The Lord of the Rings     Indians  Malaria  Vampires and Jewish people**     sharks  one shark for two people (?)  Bimini     *My brother is a plumber, and believe me he contradicts every stereotype of a plumber you’ve ever had.  **Why don’t vampires just attack Jewish people. Since they don’t have any crosses.  1:43 p.m. I’m trying to be really active today and drink a lot of water to flush out the MSG as quickly as possible. So far today I have painted the dining room, dug out two more shrubs in the front, went grocery shopping, bought and unloaded eight new shrubs, did a second coat in the dining room, and now I’m making catfish stew for Bucko’s dinner. THEN I will take a shower and make a chicken caesar salad for me and Daisy, because we are having dinner together tonight. I cannot wait to see her. I haven’t seen her for 15 days, and I need my fix.

       7:40 a.m. Wednesday, Day 121. Slept late today, I must have been making up for Monday night and recuperating from all that bush digging. I’m a little sore this morning, in the back of my thighs, but nothing terrible. Came in at 1467 calories yesterday, which is perfect. The week is off to a good start.  Not sure what I’m doing today, probably a repeat of yesterday. Work on the proposal from home, dig bushes, paint furniture. They’re behind schedule in writing the proposal, so we won’t go into production until Sunday. Which means being in The Orifice on the weekend. Yeah, yuk. Whatever, I’m glad for the hours. Nothing like a little impending poverty to make you appreciate a paycheck.  On that front, Bucko and I have decided to go ahead and get the house all ready to sell so that whenever I DO get a couple good paychecks, that’s when we can apply for a loan. It’s not the end of the world if we don’t get it on the market now, because it’s not like we have a deadline, but this is the time of year to do it. Houses in this neighorhood don’t sell fast, so I don’t want to miss our best opportunity.  I have a new favorite food. Pompeian brand Fire Roasted Red Peppers. $1.69 for a 12 ounce jar. That’s a bargain!  Also, check out the ingredients: roasted peppers, water, salt, and citric acid. Period. In the entire jar, 90 calories, 15 grams carbs, 3 grams fiber, 0 fat. I’m using about a quarter or a third of a jar at a time. These things are perfect in a salad or diced up in a rice dish. They’re not hot; for some reason I read the “Fire” part of the label as meaning spicy.  I don’t usually write that much online about what I’m eating, although offline I record every bite. At the beginning of this weight loss adventure, I discovered that I absolutely MUST have the most delicious food I can manage (which mostly means “can afford”), so that I don’t feel deprived. There’s no way I would survive on the typical bland diet. You know, half a grapefruit for breakfast, 3 ounces broiled chicken for lunch. Feh. So I’ve put a lot of thought and effort into condiments and — I don’t know what to call them — garnishes, I guess.  I eat a lot of salads, which can become dull, so I dress them up with some diced artichoke hearts, or a few black olives, mandarin oranges, or these delicious roasted peppers, and it makes the salad look fantastic, it adds a lot of flavor, thus making a very appealing meal for not much money and not much added calories. Then I don’t feel deprived, I feel like I’m eating a luxurious diet. I feel very... Zsa Zsa.  The backyard has become  filled  with wildlife recently. The squirrels, of course, are always here, but the migratory birds have started showing up. The hummingbird came three days ago. Usually they show up on May 1, but there’s always an outrider who arrives a couple weeks ahead of that. To set up camp? I don’t know. This year, TWO hummingbirds showed up early, and there have been great, epic battles already. Hummingbirds are very territorial, and I put out only one feeder, because I like to watch them fight. Also, TWO male cardinals have appeared at once. Again with the territorial wars, because when the dust settles we’ll have only one in our yard. The women haven’t arrived yet. We always called them Cardinal Richelieu and his dowdy wife Estelle, because the females aren’t so brightly colored. Last year a second wife was added, so we called her Stella. Neither one is evident yet, but I can’t wait to see how this pans out. It’s sort of the avian version of Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice.  2:20 p.m. I just took a break from formatting the proposal and laid in the sun in my backyard for 30 minutes. I know, that’s so unlike me!  5:21 p.m. Done with the proposal for the day. I’ve had enough of sitting at the computer. I got a base coat on the windsor chair, and I think I’ve decided on painting a seashell on the seat, and then some kind of funky-cute pink details on the rest. It’s hard for me to paint “cute,” because I  hate  whimsy, but I don’t think this will be putrid. I hope. Marella is sending in our booth fee and application today, so it’s definite. Or will be soon. Bucko is bringing home Chinese food for dinner, so this won’t be a low calorie day for me, but I’ll try to come in at least within goal. I think I can make that. My high end is 1800 calories, and right now I’m at 912. Should work out.

       6:45 a.m. Tuesday, Day 120. Feeling quite chipper this morning. Not quite enough sleep, I woke up at 5:30, but I’m doing okay. Dreams? Yes. Brief version: Dominick Dunne was on his way to prison for refusing to reveal a source on the stand, and I ran into him in the airport (?) as he said his farewells to family and friends. I rushed up to him and gushed all over in a fan-like way, and instead of being repulsed, he immediately loved me and promised to write to me from jail. Also Daisy was there, and he totally ignored her. It is unkind of me to be catty and jealous, but in my dream I was all “Ha ha, see, I’m WAY hotter than you,” which is significant because in real life Daisy is not only incredibly beautiful but has actually met Dominick Dunne.  So I managed 1224 calories yesterday. I can’t brag; it’s mostly because I missed lunch, and that’s not something I want to make a habit of. Other good news today — tried on the Measurement Shorts, and I think I see some progress. They were  almost  wearable. Way too snug in the butt for comfort, but I could almost conceive of wearing them. It’s such a tiny hint of progress, but more than I’ve seen for a month, so I am considerably heartened and remotivated.  12:32 p.m. I just dug up three giant bushes out of our front yard, roots and all. That was HARD work, so combined with my gliding today I think I’ve got my exercise accomplished.  5:27 p.m. Well, this has been a productive day. Besides the bush digging, I also formatted the proposal for four hours, finished the piano bench, primed the windsor chair, and did two loads of laundry. I rule. AND as of this moment I’m only at 754 calories, which means I have plenty available for dinner and still stay within goal. Rock rock rock!

       7:23 a.m. Monday, Day 119. Feeling a bit slow this morning. I think I’m dehydrated — I had both sashimi and red wine last night. Otherwise okay. But the dreams. Gah. Not nightmares, but unpleasant.  So I ended up the week well within goal (one pound per week). According to calculations, I should have lost 1.25 pounds this week. Yes, do you know anyone else who tries to lose weight without a scale and just does the math on paper? As I eventually discovered, initially I was losing MORE weight than what my calculations showed. However, the loss has stopped, or slowed down so much as to be imperceptible, so I’m not confident that I really did lose any this week. I might need another week or so On Plan for it to kick in. But, my method is to use a hypothetical universe, and I’m sticking with it. This way, I get to feel positive and motivated and successful. The calculator says I lost weight. Also, I want to point out that raw tuna is an  excellent  value, calorie-wise.  A good weekend all around, really. Almost finished painting that piano bench, and it looks very nice and beach-y, got some yard work done, went grocery shopping, and picked up a windsor chair and a wine rack to paint. Not sure what I’ll do with them, I’ll have to wait for inspiration. Today I will have to go to The Orifice, but probably just for a few hours. Maybe this Friday I will send in my temp application, unless something else has come up. I have great plans for this week. I will do SensibleGym this morning, because I have been neglecting the weight training aspect of my exercise. I’m going to try really really hard to stay on plan. I’m going to drink all my water. I’m going to get a bunch of stuff crossed off the To Do list. And probably monkeys will fly out my butt.  It very suddenly turned into Spring here.  We’re in the middle of the tree pollen season, where the pine trees shed a fine, greenish powder all over everything, every day, for about three weeks. It is absolute hell for people with allergies, and a great annoyance otherwise. The temperature is so nice, it’s not humid yet, it’s sometimes breezy, everything is growing and it smells wonderful, but you can’t keep the windows open. Oh, you’ll regret it if you do. You’ll wake up at night literally choking on pollen. Your car is covered every day, and you’ll need to wash it a couple times a week if you want to see out the windshield. Everything looks dull and dusty. Then when it finally ends, it’s so damned hot and humid you have to close the windows and put on the AC. That’s when I wonder why the hell I ever moved to the South. But then I talk to my brother in Denver, and he says they just got 8 inches of snow, and I look outside at the green leaves basking in the 85-degree day, and then I remember. Fast forward to August, and I’m DREAMING of a snowstorm. No, I just can’t be satisfied.  4:00 p.m. My god, can that place get any stupider? Or, let me rephrase that: can Crazy Hair get any stupider?  Here is what he did. He sent out an email memo, with attachments, to the FIVE other people who work in the office, describing the office’s printers and their uses and the office’s scanning capabilities. Why is this stupid? Because, of the FIVE other people, all of whom have worked there for years and have used the equipment for years:   One of them is Crazy Hair’s underling, who already knows about the printers and scanners because he wrote part of the memo.   One of them is ME, the Publications Manager, and believe me I know ALL about the printers and scanners, because, you know, officially those are the tools of my trade.   One of them is the Receptionist. No comment about her.   One of them is the Accountant, and she prints only on a confidential-use printer in her office.   One of them is the VP of a large division (not ours), and he is the intended target of the memo. The main message is: “Don’t use  this  printer, use  that  printer. Nyaah nyaah nyahh.” And if you know the personalities involved, you’d realize how insane it is for this low-level project manager to give orders to this high-level VP. And how silly to dress it up as an “all hands” memo. Oh sure, Crazy Hair, that’s going to go over well. He’s like a little boy in some sort of pissing contest. What a dildo.   I guess it’s not funny to anyone but me. That’s work for you.  In other work news, when I walked into the conference room of three men, I received compliments on my appearance (along the lines of "you look nice today" not "have you lost weight?"). No, really I'm not so pathetic that I need that kind of reassurance, but it was a notable event to me. I was like "Huh. Well, okay. Sure."   No, I changed my mind. I AM so pathetic that I need that kind of thing. If anyone else is losing weight solely for their health, I applaud you and you're my hero, but I cannot deny that a LARGE part of my motivation is to look better. So, yeah, I like it when I get compliments from men. So sue me.   In other other news, I didn’t bring lunch with me, and I stayed longer than I expected, so I had 6 hard candies from the receptionist’s desk, which has given me a sugar headache, although fortunately not many calories, and now I’m home ready to eat dinner at 4:21.  8:18 p.m. I’m interested in seeing Troy. I’ve only seen a few brief commercials for it, and I haven’t been able to tell who is cast in what part. I’m really interested to know who Brad Pitt is playing. If you read my Favorite Movie list, you know I’ve become a Pitt fan recently, and also I love the Iliad. He’s such a big star you’d figure he’s playing Achilles, but I just don’t see that. Achilles is so callow sometimes, and Pitt is too mature for that part. By the same token, I can’t see him playing Paris. Orlando Bloom would be perfect for Paris. Which, then? Agamemnon? Hmm, no. Agamemnon is too old. Menelaus? Nah. He’s sort of a weiner. I’m voting for Hector. That’s the only character with the strength and importance for a player like Pitt. In fact, Hector is one of my favorite characters in the story, and doesn’t usually get the attention he deserves. Any one else have any theories? Ooh, ooh, I have another: what if Pitt plays Odysseus, who doesn’t have a giant part in the Iliad, but is perfectly positioned for the  sequel  ? We’ll have to wait and see.

       8:20 a.m. Sunday, Day 118.  Feeling okay, slept okay, somewhat better mood. We ran out of Benefiber recently, so I bought a bottle of Metamucil. It’s less than half the price. As I also discovered this morning, the first ingredient is sugar. I don’t know how I managed to miss that on the label. And it’s not dissolving well in my coffee. Also, a few days ago I tried to put it in the CoW, and it turned into a gelatinous mess. So I think we’ll have to go back to Benefiber, even with the cost. I didn’t see any other brands to choose from, but perhaps today I’ll go to the super-expensive trendy “alternative” supermarket and see what they have.   I think I will just make it under goal this week (oppw) if I eat lightly today. It’s been a real struggle. All week I’ve had that panicky feeling every time I felt hungry. Like: whatever meal I’m eating right now is the only one I’ll ever get, and I want it to be good. I can’t tolerate any deprivation, or even moderation. When I’m  not  feeling this way, I realize that if this particular meal isn’t 100 percent fulfilling and filling, so what, there’s another one coming up in a few hours. When I’m in this panic state, I can’t see that, I can’t wait for another four hours. The food becomes the only thing that matters, and nothing else can distract me. Where is this coming from? It reminds me of once (at band camp), a friend’s therapist said that when people become stressed, they develop “tunnel vision,” their peripheral vision actually shuts down. It’s a coping mechanism, to cut down on the amount of distraction until they have dealt with the crisis at hand. Sometimes that’s useful, sometimes it causes them to miss important input.  I feel like I might be focusing on the food and shutting out everything peripheral... possibly the stress of the past couple months, the moving, the job situation? Oh well duh, how long was it going to take me to reach that conclusion? I’ve said before (although I don’t know if I’ve written it here) that I think one of my emotional issues with food is control, that it’s an area of my life where other people cannot control me and I’m the one making the decisions. Maybe when I’m feeling particularly helpless, I want to eat because it puts me in charge.  I have a lot to mull over here, and I’m sorry I can’t write it more succinctly. I am thinking as I type...  Denise, Yvonne, and Mo are having a three-sided discussion about “why do we go off plan when it feels so much better to be on plan,” and I think this is giving me an insight about that particular question, at least in the way it works for me. The equation is not “go off plan = feel bad,” it’s really “feel bad = go off plan.”  Maybe that’s Weight Loss 101 for most people, but I’m just now understanding it for myself. Getting back on plan is not, in itself, going to fix things for me; there are underlying issues that must be dealt with before I have the strength to continue the plan. I’ve always thought that’s why I could never lose weight when I worked full time in That Miserable Hellhole (a.k.a. The Orifice): my level of stress and unhappiness caused both chemical and emotional conditions that prevented it. So now I’m in another, albeit lesser, period of anxiety, and I’m finding it difficult to stick with a rigorous, self-imposed regimen of hard work. Gee, really? Heh. Without jeopardizing my resolve to get BACK on plan, I am not going to beat myself up about this. I’m going to allow myself to feel sad and brave and worthy, and marinate in it to my heart’s content. Then when I’m done with it, I can move on. But the key for me is I have to get DONE with it, not keep ignoring it and suppressing it, because that just prolongs the sitch.

       7:06 a.m. Saturday, Day 117.  I could feel worse. I can’t pretend I feel  great,  not after four martinis, but it could be worse.  Yesterday was rather high in the calories, due to martinis and also the pork rib.  I realize I have to stop buying those things. They’re just so delicious slow cooked in the oven, and the bastards keep putting them on sale for 99 cents a pound. I’ve resisted them the last two or three times they were on sale, but caved in eventually, and we’ve had them for two days now. There are two leftover in the fridge right now, and either Bucko’s got to eat them or we have to throw them away, because I don’t want to have another 795 calorie rib.    urlLink These   urlLink guys  are doing an Immediate Challenge — to stay on program through the end of the month. Which right now is 7 days. I should do this too. I need a small goal, like I was writing about yesterday. Little, easily-managed, bite-sized goals. Yes, I really should do this. I should email Denise and say “Sign me up!”   Yes. Well. Maybe later. Or better yet, I’ll take the challenge, but I won’t tell anyone. That’s it. Sorry guys, I want to join in, but my brain has been too fragile lately. I know I’m letting myself off the hook. But I’m with you in spirit, okay?  I got a clothing catalog in the mail from TravelSmith. Probably the recent vacation has put me on a lot of mailing lists. Anyway, in this catalog, they don’t use models, they just show the clothing. Which is fine, it’s expensive to use models. It takes so many shots to get just the right one — not only does the clothing have to look good, but the model has to have both eyes open, no hair in the face, etc. In this catalog, they show the clothes on hangers, generally with no background. But once in a while they’ve got a shot where the clothing is sort of  arranged  to look like a person. Like a flat, handless, footless person with a clothes hanger poking out where their  urlLink head should be.

       7:06 a.m. Friday, Day 116. I'm reasonably okay today. Not chipper, not crappy. Slept okay, but with a disturbing dream in which I killed some people who had broken into the house. I’m trying to figure out the symbology of that one, in light of how depressed I was yesterday, and all I can come up with is feeling beleaguered. Because I wasn’t feeling invaded or attacked. Hmm. I guess this one is just a cigar...?  Anyway. 1312 calories yesterday, even with ribs for dinner, so three good days in a row. That helps. I made the most delicious stir-fry on Wednesday, did I rave about it yet? Celery, carrots, onions, garlic, zucchini, mushrooms, and tofu, spiced with curry powder, thyme, allspice, and ginger. This is only the second time I’ve cooked tofu, and it came out well. I pressed it, which removes some liquid and makes it denser and thus chewy. Then I sauteed it at medium-high temperature, with soy sauce and a dash of sesame oil. I had leftovers of that for lunch yesterday, and green beans for an afternoon snack. Hence the low calories.  I still feel I’m circling on the edge of squirreliness this morning, so I must take care today to stay busy and stave off the gloom. I read the beginning of my journal yesterday, to reinspire myself, and the most obvious thing is that I was dealing with the diet/exercise “one day at a time.” At the most, one week at a time. Apparently for me it’s important to take on challenges in little pieces; I don’t want to see a huge, gray, endless mountain of effort ahead of me (no, really?). If I think of this as a one-week effort, then my brain will make a little contest of it, get psyched into trying to see how well I can eat, how much water I can drink, how many hours I can exercise. If I consider it as a one-year-plus-forever project, then my brain tries to find ways to cheat and lie. Because it seems like a prison sentence, and my brain is very sensibly trying to escape.  I know I won’t have a low-cal day today, but I’m not planning on a huge overage, either. I want to leave room for the martinis, so it’s salad for me for the rest of the day. Isn’t that disordered, to cut out food in order to drink? Yes, I know it is, that question was sort of rhetorical.   Two unrelated things:     You know what I miss about not getting a real paper newspaper anymore? I used to like to read the Lost and Found, and match up the Losers and Finders. You know, “Lost: small brown dog” and “Found: little beige canine.” And draw a line between them. There was always at least one happy ending to be discovered.    Did you know that a person who has the condition  anorexia nervosa  is described as “anorectic,” not “anorexic.”? Well, I know it. Now you do too. Futhermore, “anorexia” means loss of appetite. “Anorexia  nervosa”  means loss of appetite because of psychological reasons.

       6:46 a.m. Thursday, Day 115. Had an excellent day yesterday, calorie-wise: 1189. Oh yeah. Also cleaned, painted, painted the trim and door, and redid the caulk in the bathroom. That took a few more hours than I thought — I don’t know why I think I can paint a room in two hours. I’ve done it enough times to know it doesn’t work that way. Anyway, it looks great. I painted the same color, but in flat instead of eggshell, and it’s a big improvement. I love the way flat paint looks. It FEELS awful, but it looks great, and how often do you touch the walls, anyway?  Feeling good this morning. Another decent night of sleep. Made Bucko breakfast (CoW, three eggs, and the last porkchop. Yeah, I’m trying to kill him).  Have another bunch of things on my list today. Need to get cracking on the cover for the proposal, write bills and balance checkbook, prime the new piano bench, and do another item toward getting the house done. Haven’t decided which one, yet. But don’t worry, I have a huge list to consult.  One cup of zucchini has 29 calories. You know, I couldn’t possibly eat more than two cups of zucchini. 58 calories=full stomach. That’s a good deal.  9:13 a.m. Oh boy. This is not going to be a good day. There are many bad omens. I sat down to balance the checkbook, and of course the first thing is how broke we are. I’m transferring the last bit of savings into checking to pay for this month. Second shock: when I tried to transfer funds by phone, the system did not recognize that I have a savings account. Uh-oh. So I had to wait patiently until 9:00 a.m. to call the bank to speak to a real person. Third shock: They’re not answering the phone. Earth Day isn’t a bank holiday, is it? This morning I started the process of uploading Tahiti photos to PhotoIsland. Disconnected so I could use the phone line to call bank. After that, tried to get back into PhotoIsland. Fourth shock: “Server not found.”  How can my bank and my new photo library go belly-up at the same time?  9:18 a.m. Okay, got through to the bank, and they do think I have a savings account. An ever-dwindling account Whew!  2:20 p.m. And PhotoIsland is working now too. Whew, again. And by the way, I have put up my diary of the  urlLink Tahiti trip,  if anyone is interested. But don’t feel obligated to feign interest.  5:32 p.m. I’m having kind of a bad day.  I guess it started with balancing the checkbook and realizing how quickly we are running out of money. I’m so frustrated with the concept of jobs and work. Yeah, I know, poor me, I’m the only one to suffer so. Well, just because it’s a mundane and unavoidable part of life doesn’t mean I’m not going to complain about it. Anyway, I’ve been kind of moody and of exceptionally low self-esteem today, even for me. And yet, I got a lot of stuff accomplished, which I don’t usually do when I’m mopey. I worked 3 or 4 hours on real work, for which I will get paid, I cleaned and primed that new piano bench, gave it a first coat, and I’ve eaten nothing but vegetables all day. It’s 5:30 and I’ve had 430 calories so far. Which is good, because I’m about to have a whopping big pork rib for dinner. Also, managed to avoid buying or drinking any alcohol. I was on the verge — like, putting my shoes on and grabbing my car keys — to go get a bottle of vodka and some vermouth, and have a delicious icy cold martini or two, as some sort of salve for the wounds of the day (that sounded kind of literary and cool) but stopped myself short. Partly because I’m trying to drink less, mostly because I didn’t want to screw up my great calories today. So I know I should be impressed with my initiative and fortitude, but they ain’t paying the bills. However, TOMORROW is drinking night, and you bet your ass I’m having martinis!  Tomorrow will be better. It’s all okay. I promise.

       6:46 a.m. Wednesday, Day 114. Feeling quite chipper today. Last night I slept ALL THE WAY THROUGH.  That happens to me so rarely, maybe a couple times a year. Plenty of dreams, but nothing notable or disturbing. Just random snippets.   A reasonable total yesterday, 1500 calories even. That’s right in the middle of my range, so I’m not unhappy with it, but would like to go lower today. I will plan on an all-vegetable day, that usually does it.  I ate breakfast so early today I will be starving by 9:00.  I bought another piano bench yesterday for $15. Looks like Marella and I will do the Topsail show in June, so I need to get to work. I’m trying to do mainly furniture this year, not all that little stuff like switchplate covers and boxes.  1:54 p.m. Doing well with the food, but almost had An Incident with wasabi peas. Those things are so delicious, and I had settled in to mindlessly munching on them. Sadly, they are not devoid of calories and fat. Fortunately I noticed what I was doing and stopped at a reasonable quantity. It’s been recommended, many times, that one should not do anything else while eating — no TV, no reading — and I see the value of that. I’m at 511 calories right now, with dinner still to go. We’re having salmon (I forgot it was in the fridge, and it needs to be eaten today, so much for all-veg day) but I will also make a zucchini and tofu stir fry. Load me up on protein! Whoo-hoo! Anyway, that should work out fine to stay within goal.  2:30 p.m. I’m trying to get a LOT of things done today, and I’m losing steam. Besides exercise, an hour of “real” work, and of course writing obsessively in my journal, I’m painting the downstairs bathroom. I’m most of the way done, now it’s just the trim and redoing the grout. Heh, “just.” That will take as long as the walls, since the trim is filthy and I’ll need to clean that and the floor first.  Also trying to clean our filthy upstairs shower, on and off for a couple days. Haven’t found anything that will make the floor white again, not even straight bleach. That’s not a good sign...  I miss Daisy. I haven’t seen her since the 14th, which according to my calculations is 7 days. Seems longer.

       7:26 a.m. Tuesday, Day 113.  Peoples, I MUST get my shit together. I don’t want to flagellate myself (ooh!) but I do need to be a little stern. I am eating too much and not exercising enough, and I need to quit it and get back “on program.” Enough’s enough.  The annoying thing is, I haven't exactly gone OFF program, I’m just not hitting it quite hard enough. I’m not having eating binges, I haven’t quit exercising, I still THINK I’m on a program, but I’ve become too lax, and I’m not losing weight anymore. I’m just not doing  quite  enough: like, I’m fifteen minutes short of exercising enough, or eating just 120 calories too many. Which also makes me feel like a big dumb-ass, to go through 95% of the effort, and not be able to focus enough to come up with the other measly 5% needed.  Today I’m going to read the beginning of my journal, and try to recapture whatever emotions or thoughts that enabled me to start this program. All of a sudden those 12-Step programs are making sense to me, I finally understand that one-day-a-time philosophy. Not only that you have to deal with your life in manageable, bite-sized chunks, but that each day requires its own commitment, its own re-evaluation and re-dedication to your cause. You can’t bank those for tomorrow. You can’t coast along on your previous commitment and success, which is what I have been doing. I have never been successful at losing weight before this, so I must have thought that I had broken through some sort of tangible metabolic barrier in the past few months, that once I had started the process, it would continue on its own momentum.  Dammit, I hate it when I’m wrong.  So, I will try to re-focus on this. But I will also give myself props for continuing to improve my health by daily exercise and a nutritious diet, whether or not it has caused me to lose weight. I know that sounds very Stuart Smalley, but I’m willing to take what inspiration I can, wherever I find it.

       7:08 a.m. Monday, Day 112.  Here is what I dreamed last night: I dreamed I was in art school, and the classes sucked and the tuition was high, and we were obviously getting massively ripped off by the school. So I tried to lead a student revolt, get the administrators to concede to our demands, but I was having a hell of a time organizing anyone, because we were Weeble-type people, about three feet tall, and also we were filled with straw and damp lawn clippings inside. So the evil school administration was having NO problem slicing us down, literally. Near the end of the movie, I mean dream, I discovered a secret agricultural and manufacturing plant in the school, where I learned that they had actually created us, as soul-less and un-free creatures designed specifically to do their bidding. Which bidding was to go to their crappy art school. Whatever.  So the beach was great. The water was too cold to swim, but we were happy to sit on our chairs, drink, read, and watch the waves. Very relaxing. Picked up a little tan, very little burn. I’ve never been one for “laying out”, mostly because for most of my life I wouldn’t be seen in public in a bathing suit, but also because I can think of few things as tortuous as sweating in the hot hot sun for the sake of a tan. Now I have reached a place in my life where these two things are irrelevant: 1) I don’t care what people think of me in my bathing suit, and 2) sitting on the beach with friends, beer, munchies, and a book is not tedious.   I didn’t track my food AT ALL. It was as though the entire concept just flew out of my brain as soon as I got in the car. Fortunately, the concept of dieting didn’t entirely fly out; I ate as well as I could in the circumstances. So as in Tahiti, I’m using a high guesstimate for those two days, which has me ending the week at slightly over goal, meaning I didn’t lose any weight but didn’t gain any either. Will try the mShorts later and see if any progress has been made by that yardstick. Here's a nice Progress Point: I haven’t been to the beach since last summer, and I was pleased to see that this time I didn’t have any trouble slogging the two blocks of sand-filled pathway from the Love Shack to the water. I mean, it’s still a workout for my calves, but I was able to do it without gasping and nearly having a heart attack, as in previous years. Good on me.  10:12 a.m. Finished 40 minutes of glider sprints (whew!) and two big plates of lettuce salad with red pepper slices.  Working on my second glass of water; I must concentrate on water this week and get my consumption up to a reasonable level. I’m carrying around the timer to remind me to drink. For some reason I have to keep relearning two of the basics of weight loss: 1) drink a LOT of water, 2) make sure you have good food in the house and with you out of the house, and the corollary to #2, make sure you don’t have BAD food in the house, because you WILL eat it.  A lot to do today, and not sure whether I’m going to The Orifice. Possibly not, but probably tomorrow and some hours the rest of the week. I have some work I can do at home. Also need to grocery shop and vacuum. The floor is DISGUSTING. Our vacuum cleaner is dying a slow death, so I haven’t been using it much. Also need to work on the candle holder. And the giant list of things to do around the house in order to sell it. Yeah, like that'll happen.  P.S. no progress with the mShorts.  4:22 p.m. Got about half of my agenda accomplished, and some extra credit assignments thrown in (clean the shower and dust). Had a huge pile of shrimp for lunch, for 420 calories. MUCH higher than my typical lunch, but on the other hand, as a result I haven’t snacked all afternoon. So it’s a tradeoff, my total for the day should be within goal. It’s actually hot today; I haven’t seen the weather but I’m going to guess in the mid 80s. Hello summer!  Not quite, it’s nowhere near the heat and humidity that it’ll be in June, but still it’s pretty toasty. All the sweating makes me think I’m working harder than I am. That would make an excellent fake-French name: S'elf De Lujion.

       7:34 a.m. Friday, Day 109.  I’m feeling rather hideous this morning. Physically, anyway.  Had a WEE bit too much wine last night, so I fell asleep very early, then of course woke up at 2 a.m. and didn’t get back to sleep until after 5. On the bright side, I saw a really great movie,  urlLink All That Heaven Allows,  which is partly why I was up so long, I couldn’t stop watching it. There’s a scene I loved, where all the bohemian people have a merry little dinner with much laughing and dancing afterward, that is so much what I wanted to describe in my  urlLink Perfect Day  story. Has anyone else seen that movie? The IMDB review by “Alex V” is spot on. I want to say that Rock Hudson is certainly tall and handsome, but his acting wasn’t anything outstanding in this. I haven’t seen many of his films, but I have the impression he’s better in comedy. Secondly, did anyone see a similarity to  urlLink Far From Heaven,  at least in the beginning of the movies? I wonder if that was deliberate, especially considering the titles; Far From Heaven is  almost  a retelling of the story, with a different ending. I’ll bet they were both books, too, and I’m going to look for them. Hopefully will have the same names... And on a related thought, Dennis Haysbert is one of my favorite actors, and I really don’t think he should be doing television commercials, especially for  Allstate,  for crying out loud.  The other bright side is that I came in under goal (the high end, anyway) even with the wine and subsequent munchies. So I’m not proud of myself, but not cringing in guilt, either.  We’re going to the beach this weekend (staying with friends for FREE), and leaving this afternoon as early as Bucko can get off work. Which might be around 3.  I’m going to drive to Marella’s and leave my car there, and he can pick me up. Because that’s on the way to the beach, and if he had to come home to get me, it would add another hour onto the trip. So my point is, I’ll need to leave here no later than 2 and possibly earlier, so I have to get everything accomplished early, including shopping for weekend food. And I’m dragged out and haggard, and already behind schedule. Oh yes, life is so hard, I have to RUSH around preparing for a little beach vacation. Can you believe how much I whine about everything?? At least when I catch myself doing it I’m embarrassed.  11:38 a.m. Just back from the grocery store. No email or messages from The Orifice, so that’s good. I was afraid I’d get a ton of work today and have to make the difficult choice between getting paid and going to the beach. I have a little bit of a headache, not surprising. Also, after I went on and on yesterday about eating soup for breakfast for four months, today I broke the pattern and had a leftover chicken breast and a banana. I didn’t want to open a can of soup and then have the second half sitting in the frig until Monday morning. It’s not like it would actually go bad, but I can’t see it improving, either.  I tried to buy a bunch of food to bring with us; since we stay with our friends at their house I feel obligated to chip in more than the usual amount with food. The problem is, I just can’t find anything at the supermarket that’s both convenient and healthy (and also affordable and palatable). It would be easiest to get a bunch of chips, pretzels, frozen pizza, and cookies and that crap, but no way am I eating it, and I don’t want to risk having it around.  So I compromised with ONE bag of chips, of a kind that I don’t like so I won’t be too tempted, a couple packages of “trail mix” type snackies (dried fruit, nuts, some crackers), a bunch of bananas, apples, 2 canteloupes, and 24 bottles of beer. Which I will drink probably 4 of. Also I’m making a giant salad, and I’ll bring it in a cooler so it doesn’t get all wilty, and I can eat it whenever, and anyone else can join in. I’m bringing soup for my breakfast, and also a couple cans of tuna and salmon. Some homemade burritos for Bucko (I don’t eat them because I can’t find low-fat tortillas and so the calories are too high). And for dinner we’ll either go to a seafood restaurant or buy fresh from the market. I think I’ll survive.  So no updates until Monday or maybe Tuesday. Bye bye.

       1. Blogs, for starters.  2. Anime. Japanimation. Other Japanese cultural things like Hello Kitty. Not that I have anything against the Japanese, and certainly I appreciate their expertise in the delicious raw fish with rice department, but my generation had no particular interest in Japan. We were more into the Vietnamese, Cambodians, and Indians. Also Native Americans and sometimes Africans.  3. TiVo. You kids have just got to stop watching so much television. It’s not  good  for you.  4. X-boxes, iPods, and other things with a “single-letter-then-a-word” name. It’s as though I have a mental block (an m-Block) that prevents me from understanding what these things are, except that I know they are not the same thing. I think.  5. Sleeping in bed and cuddling with a person of the opposite sex, but not having sex with them.  I’ve read of this in more than one blog, and several times in Tomato Nation, where a date of sorts takes place, including spending the night together in the same bed, but no sex occurs. Listen up, young persons. I know you’re going to think I’m an old fogey, but in my day a primary objective of a date was to have sex, or “hook up” as it were. Also, you’re not doing enough drugs.  6. Reality TV. Hmm. I’ll admit the first few seasons of “The Real World” were entertaining, in a horrible sort of way, but enough’s enough.  These programs are so devoid of content they’ve resorted to minutes of ominous-sounding music with out-of-context shots of silent people gazing thoughtfully/recklessly/intrepidly/blankly/balefully at what is probably a small bug walking up the wall. Also, I have never heard such inarticulate human speech since The Planet of the Apes. I am sick unto death of hearing people end a sentence with "so...." instead of making the effort to put their thoughts into words. "So" is just as semantically null a term as "you know," and we must all work together to wipe it out.  7. Girls Gone Wild, and other similar flashing of the tits for the camera.  This is going to require its own separate long-winded essay.   A thing I have always wanted to say   “You mark my words!”  I’m just waiting for an appropriate time, but you better believe that someday I’ll say it. Yep, I sure will.

       7:11 a.m. Thursday, Day 108. Feeling remarkably good this morning, considering my typical night. Somewhat less dream-filled, so maybe I slept deeper, or woke less often. Who knows. Bucko says I don’t snore much anymore (a benefit of weight loss!) so I can’t even blame that. He suggests setting up a camera at night, to see what the hell happens that disturbs my sleep so much. Perhaps trolls come out from under the bed and have loud parties, or perhaps Bucko just jabs me with pins every few minutes.   I got up early enough this morning to make breakfast for Bucko. I love doing that, it’s so homey and romantic. I made him Cream o’ Wheat (he likes it), slipping in a little extra fiber in the form of Benefiber powder, three scrambled eggs, and a pot of green tea. I’ve never made C o W before (or eaten it, for that matter), and I’m not sure it was entirely successful.  It seemed a bit thin. He said it was okay, but that he usually makes the next larger amount listed on the instructions (two cups rather than one cup) and it comes out thicker. So that’s how I’ll make it next time.  I have half a can of soup every day for breakfast. Except for vacation, I haven’t varied from that in 108 days.  Recently, I have settled on Progresso Southwestern-Style Chicken, and nothing else will do. I won’t eat any other soup, I love that stuff. It makes a bizarre sameness to my mornings: Day 1 of the soup, no matter how hard I try, I can never get exactly half the soup out of the can, and no matter how I stir it up, I can’t get half the rice. So Day 1 is always a smaller, thinner soup day, and I have to eat an apple at 10:00. Day 2 is always a larger, thicker day, and there’s no apple. And that’s how my life alternates, Day 1 / Day 2 / Day 1 / Day 2, on into infinity.  A largish day yesterday, calorie-wise (1900), which is 102 calories over my limit. It was a three-martini day, because of going out with Daisy, who wisely had two Bloody Marys, not three. However, she weighs HALF of what I do and can easily get drunk on two drinks, the cheap whore. We both ordered salads, and the way they are prepared in restaurants is not exactly low-cal, but I ended up eating mine largely without dressing because firstly, the waiter forgot to bring it and it took about 15 or 20 minutes to flag him down and get it, and secondly I didn’t like it once he brought it. Took most of the salad home, and ate it with my own lite oil and vinegar dressing. So I figure 1900 is not bad for an “away” day, and I’ll spend today compensating.    Here is a nice little  Progress Point:  I can wear some necklaces that I haven’t worn for years.  I have all sorts of awkward, kludged-together extensions on most of my necklai, so they can fit around my neck, and have recently discovered that I can, in many cases, remove them.  Yesterday I just couldn’t stand to glide or SensibleGym or bellydance, so I put on my brand new Best of KC and the Sunshine Band, and danced around the house to almost the whole thing (40 minutes worth).  According to the calorie calculator I use, that’s 423 calories!  Heck, that almost balances out the martinis. A small anecdote: One time, Bucko and I were in Charleston for the weekend, and after dinner we walked around in the  urlLink Battery district * where all the giant houses are. There was obviously a party going on in one of these mansions — catering trucks, parking valets, security, lights in the garden. We could hear “I’m Your Boogie Man” coming from somewhere inside, and stopped on the sidewalk to listen. After only a couple minutes we realized “Oh, that’s LIVE music, how neat,” and then only another couple beats before we realized “Yes, and that’s  the  KC and the Sunshine Band performing it.” How cool would that be? And if you could hire a major band from the 70s to play at your party, who would you want?  *I have no idea who the people are who took these pictures, I just Googled until I found some nice shots.  I did NOT fax in my application. Partly because I am scared and skittish, partly because it looks like I have some hours at my “real” job this week and next. Yeah, I’ve been burned by that before, but I think this might be real. And it’s easier to earn the money at The Orifice than at a temp job, to whit: I only have to work about 13 hours to make the same amount as 40 hours temping. As long as I can get two days a week, I’m better off. So here’s my middle-of-the-road, no-real-decision plan: today I will get everything filled out, printed out, ready to go. I will put it in a nice clean folder by the computer. As soon as the schedule at The Orifice begins to go awry, I’ll shove it in the fax machine and hit Send.  Has anyone noticed that when there’s just a few pickles left in the jar, floating around near the bottom in the brine, they look a lot like green turds floating in a greenish-water toilet? Yes, I know that was gross and childish, but it really struck me.

       6:49 a.m. Wednesday, Day 107. Feeling good this morning. A typical night for me, too many dreams, woke up several times but not for any length of time. No actifed, no melatonin. Just a chocolate brownie right before bedtime.  My total yesterday isn’t bad (1564), but it sure would have been better without the brownie. I did a little shopping yesterday and bought stuff for dinner at Daisy’s: salad, asparagus, sweet potatoes, and a brownie each for dessert. But when I talked to her on the phone last night, she wants to go OUT tonight. Not cook at home. So there I was stuck with two brownies in the house. So I ate half of one. And it was so good, I ate the other half. Then I felt like an eating disordered freak on a giant binge, mindlessly putting food into my mouth until finally my stomach could handle no more (Mr. Creosote, anyone?). And THEN I realized I had only eaten one small brownie, that there was a second brownie in the fridge that I didn’t touch, and I was still under my goal calories, so no need for panic. But it was a fun little drama for a couple minutes.  See, this is what I hate about dieting. I mean, not the ONLY thing I hate about dieting. I hate obssessing about food, about every bite, counting up my calories and deciding if I’m “allowed” to have this. I hate having such a disturbed relationship with food.  Happily, it doesn’t feel like that all of the time. I’ve adjusted pretty well to the type and amount of food I’ve been eating, so I don’t always feel like I’m on a diet, I don’t always feel deprived. Just sometimes.  I have another little separate essay today, which is  urlLink here.  I don’t know any other place to put these things than in a fake-dated part of the blog, in case anyone is wondering how I come up with all this retroactive writing. Anyway, this is my response to Daisy’s question,  “If you could live an ideal, perfect day, what would it be?”   You can see mine is very diet-and-fitness oriented, because that's my mindset when I wrote it. The idea was, a perfect day  that’s currently within your grasp,  but I embellished mine a little bit, by transporting myself to a warm climate with a beach, and sort of fantasizing about my degree of financial success (no job!). But you know what? If I was super-wealthy, it would still be pretty much the same day. This is a fun exercise, because of course it makes you think, “What’s stopping me from doing this now?” and possibly you will start living closer to your ideal.   Several Times My Life Has Backfired   1. Never copy what your cool older brother does. Like all the kids in my family, my brother was a talented artist. In high school, he did a lot of detailed pencil drawings, mostly copies of album covers and pages from Sports Illustrated. The most famous piece he did was a copy of the Olivia Newton John album, where she is wearing a denim shirt opened at the throat. Everyone thought it was wonderful (except my parents, who never noticed anything we did), and he got a lot of attention for it at school, partly because of his drawing ability and partly because of the subject matter. She was quite the hot stuff, back then. So I, a girl in junior high, immediately decided to emulate my cool brother, and drew (drawed?) a big old picture of the Camel Man. Or possibly another brand of cigarettes, I don’t remember. But if you lived in the seventies, you’ll remember this guy. Dark hair, moustache, very handsome and manly of course, wearing a denim shirt opened at the throat. Well, the perfect corollary to what my god-like older brother did, I thought. Only I didn’t get the same reaction at school. I got a lot of snickers and weird comments from the adults that I didn’t quite understand, sort of implying that I was one to “keep an eye on,” and so forth.  I didn’t quite get that they were implying I was some sort of nymphomaniac, but I did get quite clearly the idea that I’d done something embarrassing. Again.  2. Still, never copy what your cool older brother does. My brother, three years older than me, was one of the most popular kids in school. I was one of the least popular. We were never in the same school at the same time, but his legacy was always there to greet me (or slap me upside the head, more commonly). When he was in high school (I’m talking about Boulder, Colorado in the early-mid 1970s) the cool thing to wear was: hiking boots, Levis boot-cut jeans, Tshirt or flannel shirt, denim jacket, and down vest. That’s what ALL the cool guys wore, and most of the cool girls, only instead of flannel they wore a turtle-neck sweater with a thin gold chain around their necks. So when I got to high school, I was determined that FOR ONCE in my life I would be cool, I wouldn’t be the awkward, weird geek. I insisted to my parents that I must have a down vest. They didn’t want to fulfill this request, because the vests are kinda expensive. Somehow my whining prevailed, and they bought me a poly-fiber filled vest from Sears. Instead of the down vest from North Face. It was HUGE, and completely non-pliable. It fit around me like a turtle shell. But I wore it. Oh yes, I was desperate.  Somehow, it didn’t achieve the desired popularity. In fact, I had an even worse time fitting in. Few of my friends (or even enemies) from junior high attended that high school, and I didn’t have a single class with any of them, anyway. I didn’t know ANYONE, and couldn’t seem to establish any sort of friendships or even acquaintanceships, even among the nerdy group I would normally belong to.  I drifted out to the smokers’ area, where the bad stoner kids hung out, and that’s where I stayed for the rest of high school, and you can indeed assume THAT had a big effect on my life. Eventually more than one person made a comment to me about the “down” vest — along the lines of, “I didn’t know if I should talk to you at first, because obviously you’re a Goat-Roper, not a Freak.” Which was how we classified kids from farms and ranches, or who dressed as though they were, and the stoners. And believe me, there was NO interaction allowed between those two groups. I realized, sometime during that first year of high school, that a significant part of my isolation and loneliness had been caused by that one garment. Sometime before I reached sophomore year, the down vest had migrated from “cool” clothing to “goat-roper” clothing, and I never realized it. I’d typecast myself into the wrong clique, and gotten a reputation as a poser, someone who jumped from nerd to cowboy to freak and back again, so I wasn’t liked by any of the groups. Irony, anyone?  Well, I’d meant that story to be funnier and less angst-filled, but apparently it still bothers me 27 years later. You know, one of the cruelest aspects of the absolutely rigid caste system in high school is that the unpopular kids are supposed to acknowledge, accept, and even participate in their own low status. You’re simply not allowed to step outside certain boundaries, and if you do, you’ll suffer for it. In retrospect, I wonder why I couldn’t observe that the vest was sartorially incorrect for myself. But I guess that’s the very quality that made me not a popular kid — I couldn’t figure out what to do to fit in. Because believe me, I wanted to. I wanted to be the biggest conformist on the planet, but I could never seem to get it right.  It was only after the vest incident that I gave up and became self-righteously and virulently an outsider and a bad kid. I think I decided that I was helpless to control any part of my life, in a world where such a tiny detail could have such ultimate, Kafka-esque result (please see the movie "Brazil" for perfect analogy to this story). And when you feel helpless, or scared, you become angry. Or at least, I do.  Has anyone seen “Romy and Michelle’s High School Reunion”? Remember the Janeane Garofalo character? THAT was ME.  10:45 a.m. Last week I got a coupon at the grocery store for a free package of Brown ’n Serve rolls.  I don’t eat white bread these days, but I thought since it’s free, I might as well get it and feed it to the squirrels. We have several squirrels in our backyard, and I feed them with leftover bread or crackers. These are the kind of rolls that are somewhat raw, you have to finish them in the oven. So I baked them, and the next day fed a couple to the squirrels. Bucko said “You realize you are baking for squirrels.”  That will be the name of a famous documentary film I will someday make. Baking for Squirrels.

       6:41 a.m. Tuesday, Day 106. Something must be done about the dreams. I can't handle it anymore. How am I supposed to get any rest with these epic movies playing in my head all night? I feel okay this morning, just a little unrested, and slightly sore from SensibleGym yesterday.   It's going to be another cold, rainy day today, so I must try to keep up my spirits. First goal: finish and fax in my application to temp services. I don't know if I have any work at The Office; Warren never replied to my messages yesterday. That's typical of the way things have been going there, and why I've somehow let three months skip along before I suddenly realized I wasn't getting paid anything. Friday he emailed me and said something not-quite-clear, like "I'm going to have drawings for you I need Monday."  So I wrote back and asked "Do you have them ready for me now, or you will have them for me on Monday?" He wrote back a one-word reply: "Monday."  Okay. So Monday morning I emailed him and said "Let me know if/when you need me to come in and work on those drawings."  Never heard from him. No email reply, no voice message, and he's not answering his phone. From which I deduce he probably took a vacation day Monday. Which, you know, is fine, he's allowed to do that, but I had the expectation of WORK on Monday. Paying work. Now I don't know when this work occurs, if at all. I can't keep delaying finding other jobs because of promised work that never materializes. Yes, it's my responsibility to figure that out and do something about it, but I want a little sympathy, at least, for being strung along like this.  Anyway. Talked to Daisy very briefly yesterday, and we will try to have dinner after work on Wednesday. That will give me something to look forward to. I hope to do some more work on the candle holder today. I'm not entirely happy with the color of the base coat, possibly because I can't quite decide what color I want it to be, so it's a bit of a hodgepodge. My plan today is to decide whether to go more yellow-ochre or more burnt sienna, and then mix up a spit coat of the chosen hue (haven't decided whether glaze or polyurethane) and give it several light coats to solidify the color and add some depth. It's supposed to look like a painted piece, I'm not doing a faux wood grain, but I don't want a competely flat appearance, either.  I want it to look like it's had 190 years of beeswax polish.  Had a medium-day yesterday, calorie-wise. Up near the top of my limit, but not over. Mostly because we had Quiznoids subs for dinner. I was at the end of my rope with that application (more later), the weather was depressing as hell, and I was getting cranky, so I asked Bucko to pick up dinner on the way home. Usually that means a Wendy's salad for me, but I wanted something warm, so I got a sub AND a small clam chowder. So there is no denying I was comforting myself with food. Can't say I feel guilty; I think it's pretty normal to want a tasty hot meal after a day like that. And it was perfect — I set up TV trays in the drawing room in front of the fireplace, and it was indeed cozy and happy and a nice end to the day. To me, eating on a TV tray is the height of luxury, and in fact it's best if you have a TV dinner to go with it. But it's got to be an old-style meal, like Swanson Salisbury steak with potatoes and corn. When we were little kids, and our parents managed to get a sitter and go out for a movie or whatever, they'd put us in our jammies a little early, so the babysitter wouldn't have to deal with it, and instead of eating at the dining room table like usual, we'd have our supper on trays in front of the television (television also not part of normal meals), AND we were allowed to have soda instead of milk. It's a pretty exciting break from routine, when you're six. So the only thing missing from that wonderful picture last night is that I no longer own footie pajamas, and I drink neither soda nor milk.  So here's the thing that was frustrating me about filling out that application. It wasn't a bad one, even, as far as those things go. It really did ask for the minimum required information, but I was having a hard time coming up with that info.  I've worked at the same company for 11 years, and there is not a single person who was there when I started. The company has been sold twice, and while my job title was never taken away from me, it's never been exactly confirmed, either.  When we were bought by a larger company, we (this particular office) went from being the corporate headquarters of a small-to-medium sized IT firm to a remote, unimportant satellite office of a large IT firm. Which then, as with fishies, was swallowed by a yet larger IT firm, who apparently are not even aware we exist. Well, this part is a tangent and has nothing to do with filling out the application, except to say that it's sometimes difficult to describe exactly what I do in my company, and where I do it. The problem part of the process was filling out the information for my  previous  job. The one that ended 11 years ago. NONE of those people are still there. The company is now in another building. The phone number is different. The division I used to work for was combined with other divisions and renamed. So there is absolutely no reasonable point of reference I can give my prospective employers to check up anything about me. I figured the best I could do is give them the HR department of the corporate headquarters, in D.C.  So I went to the website of this very large, multinational IT company, and from there spent over an hour trying to find a phone number, ANY phone number, for this company. I progressed from attempting to find the number for corporate HR to looking in a local phone book to find the number for a branch of the company at which I never worked. And that's what I'm putting on my application, because fuck it.  I know, that doesn't sound like much of an annoyance to send me into a tizzy for the afternoon, but of course it's not JUST the phone number. It's the stress and fear and uncertainty of looking for a job, in a very depressed market, for the first time in 11 years. It's all my anxiety and confusion about even wanting another job, because I don't. I hate the industry I'm in, I don't like the work any more, and I cannot STAND the office environment. Like it almost makes me physically ill to walk into a corporate setting, whether it's my company or another. After 21 years of this, I already know what the new job will be like. I already know all the office personalities, all the cliques and factions, the evil managers, the weak managers, the nice receptionist and the mean receptionist, the arrogant but stupid VP, the arrogant and nasty VP, the constant reorganization and ensuing chaos, the copy machine that dies every other week, the email glitches, the network problems with the intranet, impossible-to-please clients, deadlines compressed to the density of black holes, hours of uncompensated overtime, working weekends, the afternoon headaches of missed lunches and dehydration, and above all the endless meetings where nothing is accomplished that couldn't have been done in a three-line email, and I watch the clock while the seconds and minutes and hours of my life tick by, tick tick tick.   Not that I'm bitter or anything.  So naturally I'm not looking forward to finding another job. My current one is bad enough. My hope for the temporary service is just to get a paycheck while I regroup and figure out what to do. Sadly, it's not going to be a BIG paycheck, and it's unlikely I will find temporary work within my field. But as Daisy has pointed out, a day spent filing papers and answering the phone is a day with much less stress than we're used to. Not that I am downplaying the problems and issues of clerical jobs, I'm saying that when you do it as a temp, nobody really expects much of you. You're a warm body, and if you can do the work itself adequately, that's all that's required.  8:19 a.m. My life goes round in circles... Here is an email this morning from Warren: "...There will be some slippage on the schedule, but we are continuing to push forward... for planning purposes, why don't you plan on going into heavy rotation next Monday. I will probably have some resumes and corporate references to you by mid week this week. By the way, we are looking seriously at another proposal... due on May 10. Do you think you could support us on that one if we go for it?"  So what the hell am I supposed to do? I mean, I'm going to submit my application to the temps, but what the hell do I do if they call and say "can you work tomorrow?" which is what happened to Daisy.  8:25 a.m. Just received an email about the CoM project, stating that it should be back online in a few days.   My brain hurts.   9:20 a.m. Did 30 minutes of glider sprints, I'm wiped out!  Now I'm reading some  urlLink Mimi Smartypants.   Yes, I know I'm the last person in the universe to discover that particular blog, but let me say she is HILARIOUS and her daughter is adorable. I mean, ADORABLE.  I will be going in to The Office (or as Bucko calls it, "The Orifice") early this afternoon to pick up those drawings. Hope to talk to Warren about this upcoming work, i.e., how concrete is any of it? Hope to avoid Crazy Hair and Overly-Talkative Receptionist. There are only five full-time people left in an office that once had over 200. They don't have enough work to do, they're bored and restless and lonely, and they POUNCE on anyone who comes in the front door. Fresh blood. I can understand and sympathize, but the thing is, I work part-time. I'm paid hourly. Hourly, people.  So I really don't want to stand here and chat with you for an hour, and you for half an hour, and YOU for 90 minutes, because I can't charge for any of that, and I've just spent three UNPAID hours in a place I hate. I try to fob them off as politely as possible, but I have become  very  firm about it, and not so concerned any more about whether it hurts anyone's feelings.  I've written so much today, I'm going to post now. Maybe that will shut me up.

       6:57 a.m. Monday, Day 105. Slept like hell last night — woke up for an hour or so and couldn't get back to sleep, felt anxious, and as always too many dreams. Something about working on an irrigation project in an Arabic country, which was kind of interesting, and something else about my having to wait impatiently to climb down a telephone pole on Hillsborough Street because there was this college girl in line ahead of me who was going to do some sort of gymnastic feat on the telephone wire in order to get into Ripley's Believe it or Not, and the event was to be recorded on Etch-a-Sketches, which is partly why it was taking so long.  That's what I dreamed; I'm not making it up for an attempt at humor. Neither of these dreams was unpleasant, but both were so vivid as to be unrestful.  Otherwise, I guess I'm feeling okay. I managed to come in at oppw, incredibly. I'd forgotten I had several very low cal days earlier in the week. Yay. And yesterday was pretty low too. So here we are Monday morning all ready to start fresh. It's a rainy, cold morning, so I'm not exactly chipper, but not despairing, either.  9:58 a.m. Did 10 minures on the SensibleGym, and 10 minutes step. It's not enough, I will have to work in something else this afternoon. Right now I'm trying to determine if I have work today, and if so, whether I need to go into the office to do it. If not, this would probably be a good day to call the temp place, wouldn't it?  10:49 a.m. Okay, I'm filling out an application to University Temp Services. Let's keep our fingers crossed. I don't think I can get it sent today; I'm waiting for replies from a few people about whether I can use them as references. So hopefully tomorrow morning I can fax it in.  I forgot that I'm doing my measurements monthly instead of weekly, so I did them this morning, with the usual confusing results. Lost the two inches in the waist that I inexplicably gained last week, lost half an inch in other places, gained half an inch in others. What the...?  I've lost at least 30 pounds, I've gone from a 26 to a 22, and my measurements are essentially the same as the first day? Nope, something's not right here. Feh.  2:18 p.m. I had the last little bit of leftover turkey scraps for lunch, and also steamed three carrots. I ate them all, and I am FULL.  Those things are so filling. Fiber is my friend. Started painting the base coat on the candle holder. I'm only doing one, which might be crazy because they should probably be a pair, but I'm regarding the first one as a practice run, unless it comes out well, and then I'll have two. It doesn't look very good yet, but that's not unusual, there's still a long way to go. I'm not pushing it. Today is so gray and gloomy and quiet that I must be happy with small accomplishments. This is not a day for taking great strides, for bold actions or loud voices; it's a day for humbly accepting whatever tiny gifts are offered. It's a day for keeping my head down and quietly working, without drawing undue attention to myself.  4:50 p.m. It's also a day for throwing in the towel at the appropriate moment, getting dressed in my jammies, starting a fire in the fireplace, and drinking wine until Bucko comes home, when he will fill my head with unwanted but unavoidable details about edit systems, firewires, and so on. How cozy.

       7:01 a.m. Sunday, Day 104. It's Easter!  I just realized.   Easter was an exciting holiday when I was a kid.  Not in the same league as Christmas, of course, and not quite as candy-abundant as Halloween, but still fun. It was always a little confusing to me, though. It's too complicated a holiday, and it seemed to have many unconnected aspects that never made a coherent picture in my mind of what it was all about. Like, Christmas was easy. Jesus is born, Santa gives you presents. Halloween, you wear costumes, people give you candy. But Easter...? Jesus was dead and then he was alive (and there's a whole BUNCH of steps leading up to that part), there's an Easter Bunny, and if you don't go to sleep he won't bring you candy and eggs. Eggs? You mean the eggs that we dyed ourselves yesterday? And also now we have to search for them in the yard? How exactly did they become lost in the first place? And then the chocolate candy shaped like the bunny, not like a chicken. Although there are those little yellow marshmallow peeps... also jelly beans. And the Easter hat contest at school, back in the days when, apparently, the school board believed it would be beneficial for ALL the children to be exposed to Christianity in the learning environment. This involved a paper plate as a base, with a ribbon threaded through a couple slits to tie around our chins. Then we decorated the top with various elements glued onto it — I don't remember what, but I imagine pipe cleaners and cotton balls made their usual school-craft appearance. I don't know what happened after that. I guess we wore them all day. I don't know if the boys made them too. And on Easter Day, the new dress for going to church, also possibly with new patent-leather Mary Janes. Always a pink, yellow, or minty green dress. The exact colors of those little pillow-shaped mints, in fact. I don't think the boys got new clothes, at least I don't remember it, but I have a strong recollection that Easter meant new fancy clothes for women. What was that all about? I have the weirdest memory fragment that it has something to do with a movie!   Now, of course, I can put together a lot of the pieces and see what most of it means. You have your basic concepts of rebirth and renewal, both in the religious sense and the good old pagan earth-worship sense. It's spring. But as a child, it was bizarre. I suppose Christmas customs are just as complicated, illogical, and contradictory, so I don't know why that never confused me. Possibly because my family didn't HAVE any Christmas rituals, but for some reason tried to participate in several at Easter.  SO anyway... yesterday was only fair, calorie-wise. There were martinis, you see. I am going to TRY to compensate today. Putting that pressure on usually immediately leads me to a small eating binge, but I think I can handle it today by bingeing on vegetables. I can eat plenty, in fact I can eat A LOT, and still meet my goal calories. That's my plan. Also, the cramps are all gone.  I don't know what that was about, but will mention it to my gyn, which by the way I am overdue for my annual exam. AND I didn't get my mammogram last year, so I need to do that soon also, and oh boy, one of these days I'm going to write about the experience of mammograms, and you young women who haven't had one yet NEVER WILL, and it will be my fault that you go through life risking breast cancer.  Now here's my complaint about the Netzer Big Book o' Calories: sometimes it just doesn't make sense.  I had an artichoke for morning snack. That is, I had a fresh, raw artichoke, medium size, and I steamed it. Then I pulled off its leaves and ate the tiny edible part at the base of the leaves. Then I scraped away all the choke part, and ate the delicious "heart" of the artichoke. So for my money, what I just did is eat "artichoke, steamed, one." So I go to the Netzer book under "artichoke," and here is what I find: &nbsp;Artichoke, Fresh &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Dole) 1 large.............................. 23 calories &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boiled 10.6oz choke.....................60 calories &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearts, boiled, drained, 1/2 cup....42 calories  Huh? What does that mean?  1 large artichoke, 23 calories, okay, that seems to make sense, if that's all you look at. Except the calories are kinda low. But then the next entry, "boiled, 10.6 oz, choke" means what? Does it mean you boiled the artichoke, which weighs 10.6 ounces, and you ate the choke? Does it mean you boiled something, and the choke weighs 10.6 oz? Which why would you care, because you don't eat the choke. And why are the calories apparently increased by boiling? The next entry, half a cup of artichoke hearts, would again be okay by itself, but is confusing when compared with the other entries. How many artichokes are needed to make 1/2 cup of hearts?  So I log on and go to nutritiondata.com, where I type in the search term "artichoke." Among other entries, I am given these to choose from: &nbsp;&nbsp;Artichokes, (globe or french), cooked, boiled, drained, without salt &nbsp;&nbsp;Artichokes, (globe or french), raw  Perfect. I pick the first one, and am given 60 calories. For comparison, I check the second (raw) entry, to see just what effect BOILING has on the calories. And I find the effect is: nothing. Same calories. So easy.    Listen up, Corrine: I appreciate that you went to a lot of work to compile that book of yours, but I have to tell you it's not very user-friendly. And what part of the artichoke is 23 calories?  6:36 p.m. An uneventful day. Went to look for swim fins for Bucko, didn't find any. Found a nice neighborhood with a house we could almost afford, though. I have been eating vegetables all day until dinner, when I had some turkey (not much, just pickings off the carcass) AND I managed 30 minutes of glider sprints. I don't usually exercise on Sunday, so that was good. I am only at 1343 calories for the day, hopefully can maintain that or something close, then I can come in under goal for the week. Had a Wendy's spinach salad for lunch, that's new. I don't have the exact numbers for that, so I estimated it as more than a Mandarin Chicken salad, but less than the Chicken Club salad, because it has less meat and egg. It was okay, but as always I couldn't eat the dressing. 120 calories, and the first ingredient was high fructose corn syrup. A shame, because spinach salad really needs sweet/sour dressing.

       8:07 a.m. Saturday, Day 103. Feeling a bit slow today, most likely from the large delicious turkey dinner last night. I did a mutant Martha Stewart version, where you soak a cheesecloth in wine and butter.  I used beer because I didn't have any white wine, and I must say it worked very well.  I also used one stick of butter instead of the THREE her recipe calls for.  That makes for a hell of a gravy, but I do let it cool and skim off the fat, so a lot of that goes away for the final product. Or else one bite would be 30,000 calories.  Speaking of calories, of course my total yesterday was NOT good. That will be my "high" day for the week, which does seem to generally fall on Friday.  Took a melatonin last night, I'm not sure why I thought that was a good idea. Can't see that it helped any.  Also I have KILLER cramps, which started in the middle of the night, and actually woke me up from discomfort. That's very unusual for me.   10:11 a.m. These cramps are killing me. I don't even remember the last time I had such severe ones. I'm thinking maybe when I was about 14 years old. This is freaking me out a little. It's not like unbearable pain or anything, it's just that I don't normally get much in the way of cramps, so what is suddenly causing this? Turkey? I've taken aspirin and it's done nothing, so I will see what else we have around. I know I don't have Midol or anything like that, I never need to use it. This sucks!  I'm going to try to do the pinestraw today; maybe exercise will help.  12:30 p.m. Took a naproxen sodium, and that seems to have done the trick. Got all the pinestraw distributed; it went a LOT further than I thought it would. We figure we could still use three or four more bales, though, and one more bag of mcnuggets to really do it right. We can probably carry those in our cars, in two trips. I hope it will help to keep the dead leaves from being blown around. I can't keep the sidewalk or driveway clear of those things, and it's SPRING.  We have 12 years worth of dead leaves piled up all over, and it's gotten out of hand. Now we're off to a craft show where a pottery friend of mine is exhibiting, a show I COULD have been in, if I'd had my shit together. But you know. I'm not entirely crazy.  I'm trying to concentrate on the furniture, not little piddly boxes and switchplates and junk like that. People at a craft show want to spend $12. I can't paint ANYTHING that would let me make a profit at $12. People aren't there to spend $400 to $800, which is where my furniture is priced. However, they did get an exceptionally good turnout, so MAYBE next year, if I'm still trying to do this, and haven't given up and found another stupid job.

       6:47 a.m. Friday, Day 102.  I guess I feel okay today. Took a quarter actifed last night, because I was so wired from my TWO cups of coffee (which are only half-caffeine, anyway). I woke up a couple times but went back to sleep. Many many dreams. Some morning when I feel ambitious, I will record one in full, and you people will see what I mean about how they’re overly detailed.  I think I could have slept longer, but I left the window open last night, and the little birdies woke me.  So yesterday was a stupendous 1230 calories, even including half a Quiznoids sub — which is about half my day’s calories all by itself.  It’s all the vegetables I ate, they have hardly any calories. And some of them are reasonably filling. Since I have to take the movies back today, I will pop in to the grocery store and get some more. Yep, just like that.  Last night I read aloud parts of the RFP to Bucko, just like families used to do in the olden days before television. He came up with a couple ideas to represent data warehouse, and I came up with one while sleeping.  I will have to remember that reading it aloud to another person is a useful technique. Of course, in the case of proposals, it’s fairly painful for them. Perhaps one could read aloud to the dog, entirely in the “good doggie, nice doggie” tone of voice.  Or corner the UPS man, while wearing a too-sheer nightgown, high-heeled slippers, and a cigarette in the corner of your mouth. You know, that’s a good basis for a movie and I’m going to stop writing about it now so nobody steals my screenplay.  1:32 p.m. Having an okay day so far. Not as productive as yesterday, but I'm getting some things accomplished. I'm in a reasonable mood, not bubbly but not depressed. Bought a turkey at the grocery store today. They were on sale, I suppose for Easter...? Whatever, it was 89 cents a pound, so I felt obligated. I'm going to cook it this afternoon, because I'll be home, so why not. Also, then I can do it without Bucko hovering over me, second-guessing everything I do. There's such a mystique about cooking turkey — I guess a lot of people have had bad experiences. I'm more casual about it. It's just a large chicken, in my mind. We can have snow peas, sweet potatoes, and asparagus with it. I think I can keep my calories reasonable that way. I don't feel the need for stuffing, bread, gravy, or any of that stuff.  1:44 p.m. Just got an email that the proposal has been extended to May 4. Okay, people, I can't stand this bullshit. I need a paycheck NOW, dammit. Reckon I need to go to the temp agency. Also, this has knocked my mood down a few notches. I'm now at "surly."  Will try to recover.

       Speaking of stealing, I stole the following from  urlLink someone,  who stole it from  urlLink someone else  (however, I’ve shortened it a bit; my blog is big enough already):    Grab the book nearest to you, turn to page 18, find line 4. Write down what it says.  "[Mau]passant allows his characters’ words and actions to express..."  Sorry, it was sitting right next to the computer.   Stretch your left arm out as far as you can. What do you touch first?  An 8-inch JVC video monitor   What is the last thing you watched on TV?  The new South Park, where the boys get “served.”   With the exception of the computer, what can you hear?  The television in the other room. Cars pulling out of their driveways. Some airplanes.   When did you last step outside?  Yesterday, to feed the squirrels.   Before you came to this website, what did you look at?   urlLink Donut    What are you wearing?  Pink sleep shirt with green leaves and pink and yellow bugs.   Did you dream last night?  Oh, you better believe it.   When did you last laugh?  Last night when Wayne Brady played "a stage hypnotist who hypnotizes people with his butt."   What is on the walls of the room you are in?  A set of the Tabasco different-art-styles  urlLink posters.    If you became a multi-millionaire overnight, what would you buy first?  About 300 music CDs. Then a sushi dinner.   Tell me something about you that I don't know.  I have a toe hair that’s more than an inch long.   If you could change one thing about the world, regardless of guilt or politics, what would you do?  Heh. Raise the average IQ by 50 points or so.   Would you ever consider living abroad?  Absolutely   This was so fun, maybe I'll be inspired to make up my own list of questions!

       7:14 a.m. Thursday, Day 101.  Sort of like Dalmations. Disney’s 101 Dieting Days, the fun-filled escapades of a motley crew of heart-warming characters: see our heroine, Princess Fleeting Optimism, vie for dominance with her evil conjoined-twin sisters, the Bitter Bitch and Self-Pity Mouse, along with her sidekicks, Resent ‘n Remorse, as they journey on the Road to Health and Self Acceptance, from Misery Wallow to Perfection Palace, with sidetrips into Fantasyland... Okay, now I’m sounding more like Lord of the Rings than Disney, and that’s enough of that either way.  I feel AWFUL today.  I woke up at 4:00 a.m., my head filled with anxieties and squirrelly thoughts, and I couldn’t get back to sleep until 6:00 or thereabouts. Another hour of dream-filled sleep, and now I feel groggy and hungover and like I’ve been sick in bed for a week.  I feel on the verge of a nasty depression. I hope I’m not going to have to self-care myself all day, sitting around in my jammies, wandering from television to computer and back again. I didn’t take any “sleep aids” last night, either Actifed or melatonin, which probably had something to do with it. I better explain the Actifed, before you all think I’m a junky.  It’s an OTC allergy/hayfever medicine.  I take it 2 or 3 times a week, usually a quarter or a half a pill. Sometimes I take it zero times, sometimes four times, it depends. It does several things for me: it makes me sleepy; it prevents me from snoring nearly so much; it counteracts things I’m actually allergic to, such as cats; it counteracts things I’m not allergic to but are bothersome, such as a lot of cigarette smoke, the current tree pollen, or some foods; and it’s a better hangover prevention than aspirin. So I take an actifed when I’ve been out to a party or out to dinner, because it will be useful for one or more conditions I’m likely to encounter in that situation.  Melatonin is a hormone that occurs naturally in your body and helps to regulate your sleep cycle. People tend to produce less of it as they grow older. You can buy synthetic melatonin pretty much wherever they sell vitamins and other supplements, and use it to combat sleep problems such as jet lag or insomnia.  So it seems on the surface that melatonin is the thing for me. It’s not a “drug,” and it’s specifically for sleep problems. Howevah: the problem with melatonin is that it isn’t regulated by the FDA.  Because it’s considered a supplement and not a drug, it isn’t subjected to the testing and control of something like Actifed. So even though the Actifed (pseudoephedrine) is officially a drug, and was developed from a prescription-only product, its effects and risks are more thoroughly documented than the melatonin. I know what I’m getting, in other words. I can read the package insert and decide if my use of it is safe.  I can’t do that with the melatonin. And if anyone wants to point out that my poor sleep might in fact be caused by MENTAL problems rather than physical? Get in line.  In other news, yesterday was kick ass, calorie-wise. 1169. Unbelievable, yes? But true. This was accomplished by eating mostly vegetables for every meal, and having no wine. Also 8 glasses of water.  9:31 a.m. So here’s my plan for the day. I won’t self-care myself, or allow myself off the hook for the day, but I will be somewhat indulgent, and I will mix up my normal routine to encourage creativity and loose bowels. I will have a SECOND cup of coffee — unheard of — while I look over that painted furniture book and find inspiration for the two violin-shaped candle holders I’ve had sitting around since last summer (1). I’ve already put on my favorite pink t-shirt, which still smells like Tahiti. (That’s the joy of an unscented laundry detergent; it’s been through the wash two or three times since we got back, and it still smells like suntan lotion, salt water, and fresh air. It’s making me happy.)  I will wash the sheets (2). I will review my resume (3). I will start painting the candleholders (4). I will clean the kitchen floor (5). I will watch a movie (6). I’ll get some kind of exercise (7). I will work on the proposal cover this afternoon (8). Then I will have a lovely bath, and read books for the rest of the day (9). Those are my assignments.  How to Mop a Floor:  This is something I learned only a few years ago. I could never figure out how to work those standard sponge-mops-with-scrubby-part. It seemed like all I did was push dirty water around, and then give up. Then I saw an Oprah show where the guest was a guy who owned a large professional cleaning service.  He showed how one mops a floor professionally, and from that I could finally deduce how to work that darned sponge mop (hint: it performs multiple functions).  Professional version: Fill a bucket with your soap and water mixture. Spill some of it onto the floor. Use a scrubby-only mop to scrub the floor with the soap. Then use a long-handled squeegee to scrape the dirty water into a pool. Use a dustpan to scoop the water up and deposit it into a second (slops) bucket. Dry the floor with long-handled towel pads or clean cloths.  Sounds crazy, doesn’t it? But it worked great, and they did it FAST. Now here’s the standard mop version:  Fill a bucket with your soap and water mixture. Put the clean, dry mop into the bucket, and let it soak up some water. Put the wet mop over the floor, and use the squeezing lever to spill out some water. Then use the scrubby side to scrub the floor with the water.  Dry out the mop by squeezing it over your second bucket. Then use the scrubby side to push the water into a puddle on the floor, and turn the mop over to the dry sponge side to soak up the dirty water. Squeeze it into the second bucket. Repeat as necessary. Air dry.  1:16 p.m. I’ve accomplished items 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7. For bonus points, I’ve also taken the trash out, washed a load of regular laundry, and entered my debits in the checkbook register.  I located a bunch of URLs for publications I’ve worked on, to include in my resume. Item 4, start painting the candleholders, might be a little too ambitious. My brain is now FULL of ideas for the design, and I will need a little time for them to swirl around and sort themselves out. However, I will WORK on the candleholders, even if it only means cleaning and sanding.  I feel SO good to have accomplished something today, and on several fronts: work, home, creativity, self, and self-indulgence.  4:25 p.m. Okay, I’m nixing item 6 (watch movie) and 8 (proposal cover).  #6 was kind of optional, anyway, in case you couldn’t tell. And 8... well, I’m so damn sick of that cover.  I’m going to wait until the better half comes home, and pick his brain. I need a fresh mind here.  I’ve cleaned and sanded the candle holders, so I will cross off item 4. So now I’m off to accomplish #9, have bath and read book. Here’s the book I’m going to read:  urlLink The Moon Spinners,  by Mary Stewart. Yes, really. No, it is so a good book. A little dated, no doubt, but very fun. And don’t even THINK about watching the movie version with the abominable Haley Mills. The book is about grownups, not little girls.

       7:34 a.m. Wednesday, Day 100 !  Whoo-hoo! It seemed like a landmark of some kind, until I remembered that I’m not trying to accomplish a number of days dieting, I’m trying to accomplish weight loss. But what the hell, 100 days! Yay me!  Had a wonderful time at Daisy’s last night. Talked for four hours straight. Had a great meal (sushi appetizer, grilled chicken on lettuce salad, steamed carrots, black bean salad, pecan brownie for dessert) and a lot of wine. My day’s total is 1895, which is 93 calories over my upper-end goal. So, not a victory, but on “dinner out” days I figure I’ve done well if I reach a draw.  Speaking of reaching a draw, of course I weighed myself while I was there, and I weigh exactly the same as I did 12 days ago.  That’s what I’ve suspected, that I haven’t lost anything in quite a while. It’s not surprising, what with the vacation (much food, little exercise) and then I’ve had a lot of “over plan” days since.  I won’t quite call it “off” plan, because when I’ve stuck to my regimen for 23.75 hours of the day, I want some credit for that. This is one thing I hate about dieting — you can follow your diet all day long, or all week long, and then blow it right the hell up with one meal.  A few minutes can cancel out the rest of the day.  At least with exercise, when you do it, it’s done. Nothing can take that away from you, you can’t negate it or reverse it.  I stop short of actually giving myself permission to go “over plan,” but I will still pat myself on the back for what I did manage. Like, I’ll think to myself, “If that was a year ago, I would have had that brownie for dessert AND have already eaten 2200 calories earlier.”  At least now I’m putting that brownie on top of 1500 calories.  I’m reading  urlLink Food Politics  by Marion Nestle.  I’ve only just started, but it’s fascinating. I’m shocked, but not surprised, at the amount of fast food and junk food Americans eat.  I think one reason I’ve been so healthy despite my weight is that we’ve never eaten like that.  Not to any great degree; for the past ten years or so (before this diet) our pattern was: I’d eat a fast-food meal maybe twice a month. We’d get a higher-quality fast food (real pizza, Subway, Chinese food) about once a week. A bag of tortilla chips or pretzels once a week. Go out for Goodberry’s once a month.  That was the extent of our junk eating.  No Ring-Dings, Fritos, Krispy Kreme, or Doritos. Mostly we cooked real meals at home. Chicken and two vegetables, that kind of thing. Bucko has eaten a can of soup and a tuna fish sandwich for breakfast for about the past 20 years.  But our food bill is much higher than the statistics in that book indicate. She says food costs only about 10% of the average American’s income.  I keep track of our expenses, and I know it’s 20% of ours. Our net income, anyway.  You’d think eating at home would be much much cheaper than eating at fast-food, but apparently not.  I suppose that’s part of the success of those businesses. However, since I’ve been dieting, our overall food bill has gone down somewhat.  The decrease is mostly because of fewer restaurant meals — we used to eat at a regular restaurant about once a week, now we do it once a month. My grocery store bill has actually increased. Although I’m eating less food, I’m buying better food, and that’s costly. However, none of it gets wasted anymore. I’d estimate that about 15% of the fresh food we bought used to end up in the trash, because of spoilage. Now I can’t even remember the last time I threw something away.  Now I have the time to cook, and manage our food in general, so all these factors together add up to almost $200 less a month.  That really makes you wonder how much having a job COSTS you, doesn’t it?  You have less time, so you end up eating more restaurant meals and throwing away more food. If you made $15 an hour, that $200 difference would cost you 17 hours of labor (I’m assuming about 20% taxes and other deductions from your paycheck). So you have to work just over two days before you make up for what the job is costing you in food.  And what about other expenses...?  On a related note, if you want to read an interesting article about food and women, try Gloria Steinem's essay found  urlLink here.   SO anyway...  it’s 9:22 already and I’ve been surfing and dicking around for almost two hours. I need to go exercise. I’m planning on “glider sprints,” which is the term I just made up for going fast then going slow then going fast again on the glider. And I’m going to watch the first Lord of the Rings while do it. Nope, haven’t seen that movie yet.  And you know what? Please don’t threaten to burn me for heresy, but I never liked those books, I think they’re dull as ditchwater. Hoping the movie is better.  10:28 a.m. The glider sprints worked out great. I did 3 minutes regular speed, 2 minutes fast, and repeated that for 30 minutes. According to the glider's built-in calculator, I burned 241 calories, which is about what I usually burn in 30 minutes. That doesn't seem right, so I'm going to assume that the calculator is only good for a ballpark idea of the calories burned. Which is true, because it doesn't take into account body weight or muscle density or any of that stuff, and apparently it's basing its calculation more on elapsed time than repetitions.  Watched the first 30 minutes of TFotR, and I'm not impressed. It's more dull than the book.  I wonder if it would have worked better if the first movie was The Hobbit?  I didn't like all the back story part, that's not a grand opening to what should be an adventurous, epic movie.  And I just had this weird feeling of watching a "making of" special.  Not sure how to describe that, but to me none of the characters seemed real, they were all flat representations, almost symbols, of the people in the book. It didn't seem like anyone was trying to be believable and bring life and interpretation to the role, they were just trying to be the most obviously-recognizable version of what they thought most people imagined the character to be. Whew. Could anyone follow that chain of thought?  I'll probably try watching more later or tomorrow, maybe it will get better.  1:38 p.m. Tuna fish and lettuce salad for lunch, very nice. Doing very well with my eating and water drinking today. I got the trim in the staircase painted. Now for some more research on data warehousing; Warren didn’t like any of my covers Monday and wants me to try again.  I almost felt upset for about half a second, and then immediately thought 1) I don’t care if he likes them and 2) fine, more billable hours.  2:25 p.m. Researching data warehousing in the web and I’m cross-eyed from it. This is unbelievably tedious, and I’m not coming up with any ideas for the cover. I can hardly keep my eyes open, and I think I will need a nap this afternoon. Otherwise, how will I stay awake for the new South Park?  5:26 p.m. Watched another hour of TFofR, and I doubt I’ll finish it. I thought it started to get better for a while, but then it reverted to dullness.  And all that CG. You know, I hate CG.  It is simply not good enough.  I don’t care how “real” it looks, that’s almost beside the point.  It’s not done “well.”  I’ve never seen any CG that’s half as captivating as the average Disney feature cartoon from the 1940s.  I don’t suppose you could make a movie (three movies) of the Lord of the Rings without CG, but as usual, they’ve let it overpower the story.  It’s as if the CG is a character, the LEAD character.  There are some scenes where the actors are allowed to exercise their craft, but only too rarely.  It makes for a very sterile film.

       6:45 a.m. Tuesday, Day 99. Feeling good today. I woke up a little early, 5:30ish, but I think I had enough sleep. Took a melatonin last night, because I was all wired up from dancing around to my new Best of KC and the Sunshine Band CD.  Now, that’s a good workout. I did it a little late in the day, though, like around 9:30 p.m., which is not the optimal time to exercise. Anyway, I had a good day yesterday, food and exercise-wise. 1463 calories, six glasses of water, and lots of activity: SensibleGym, stepping, gliding, and disco dancing around like an idiot. I’m glad to be back on track and remotivated; I don’t think I’ve lost any weight in a while.  It might be the vacation catching up with me, plus I’ve had some high-calorie days lately.  Or I’ve reached one of those plateaux. We’ll see. As always, this is happening so slowly that it takes me a month before I can see any change.  As impatient as I am with the speed, I know that ultimately it’s better to lose weight slowly. If nothing else, my skin has a better chance of adjusting. I imagine I should try changing and increasing my workouts now, that seems to have the best chance of breaking through a plateau.  Now I want to get on my soapbox and seriously rail against a non-fat-related issue, so be warned if you don’t want to read something like that. It’s  here.  And I don't know what suddenly caused me to write this, although it's been on my mind for a long time.  12:40 p.m. A pretty good day so far. I’ve drank 4 glasses of water (and recorded it), exercised, cleaned out some of the stuff in the attic, threw away a bunch of deceased Christmas decorations, written a scathing indictment of poor driving, shovelled out three bags full of pine bark mcnuggets into the garden, and realized that the proposal is due at the end of NEXT week, not this week. So the big hours I was expecting aren’t going to happen for a little while yet. Damn. Still planning on going to Daisy’s house for dinner. Yay, I can’t wait. How ever will I fill up the afternoon until it’s time to go?  I had another “overcoming obstacles” dream last night. This one involved my mother trying to persuade me to do something or other I didn’t want to, and when I stuck to my guns, she turned into some sort of monster with tentacles and became VERY bitchy about the whole issue. In my dream, I told her to fuck off, and LEFT. Very happy ending, and if you know my mother, very likely a true story.

       7:11 a.m. Monday, Day 98. Figured out all my charts from last week, and it’s not good. On paper, I’ve lost 0 pounds. On the bright side, haven’t gained any, either. My highest priority today is go to the grocery store and get some decent food in the house — yesterday I ate a bunch of crap because that’s what we had around. Those stale tortilla chips from way back when? Had three handfuls. So this morning I am again oversalted and my eyes are beady little red things surrounded by swollen and dark skin. Oh yeah, baby. This time I can only blame myself.  Other than that, I feel fine.  The proposal work should start this week, and I plan/hope to spend some time on cover ideas today and tomorrow. I think I might get about 30 hours this week; at least that’s what I’m hoping for. That’s giving me a more positive attitude than I’ve had recently!  Another goal for this week is to track my water better.  I haven’t been drinking enough, I never do, but I’ve also slacked off about tracking it. I’ll have 3-4 glasses in the morning, but then once I get going for the day I forget to tally it up. I doubt I’m having more than another 2 glasses, though, so I’m still falling short.  My Monday Measurements are confusing and disappointing as usual. I show a 1 to 2 inch gain in all measurements except my neck, which shows a half inch loss. None of those are likely to have occurred in the space of one week, and I’m thinking of canning the entire idea. No, I have a better plan — I’m going to do the measurements once a month, instead of once a week. Maybe over the long run they’ll make sense. So: next measurements will be May 5.  9:35 a.m. I just did 15 minutes of SensibleGym and 10 minutes of step. That step is killer; I don’t know how I used to do 30 and 40 minutes of it. I got a much higher heart rate than gliding, it’s a harder workout. That’s a reminder that it’s good to mix up the exercise more than I’ve been doing. Going up stairs is still really hard for me, and it would make sense to start doing it more often, keeping a careful eye on the knees. Presumably as I become lighter it will be less stressful on the joints. Now I’m on my way to the supermarket. I’m going to the Harris Teeter, which is 4 miles away, instead of my favorite Lowes, which is 12 miles away. See, that’s why we need to move closer into town. I’m no longer willing to spend so much of my life traveling — it leaves less time available for doing other things. 20 minutes to the supermarket is just not do-able anymore. Heck, 4 miles isn’t even that great!  12:31 p.m. Back from the store. That place is too expensive, I won’t be going there often. But I got a bunch of vegetables, fruit, chicken, and tuna, so I can eat better this week. I gave in to the temptation of 10 chocolate covered almonds. Very exciting. Now I’ve been working on the proposal — emailing, gathering up logos, looking for cover ideas, reading up (just a little) on the concept of data warehousing. Geez, I feel so professional again.  3:33 p.m. Got three cover versions done. I can charge 8 hours for that, right? I am so excited because Daisy and I are planning to have dinner together tomorrow. I’m going to just bring it to her house right after work so we have the maximum amount of time to drink and complain. Aaaahhh. I can’t wait.  3:52 p.m. Wow. I just discovered that  urlLink SOMEONE ELSE  has a link to my blog. Huh.  I never really thought about other people reading this. I mean, I understood that the possibility exists, but I never thought it would apply to me, I guess.  If anyone is actually reading this, well, I'm stunned and flattered and appreciate your interest.   I've always written as though a pretend someone else is reading, sort of like a letter-to-a-friend format. Now I'm gritting my teeth at every word I type and thinking about OTHER PEOPLE reading it. What will they think? Had I better clean up my language? My grammar? My attitude? Should I start trying to write something sensible and useful?   Naah. I'll write just like I've always written, which is pretty much whatever natter goes on inside my head at the time. I'd LOVE to be witty and brilliant and sensitive and above all useful to a reader, and I promise you all ("all," ha ha) that I won't try NOT to be those things. Okay? And in the meantime, if you want that stuff, go to  urlLink Pound .

       8:26 a.m. Sunday, Day 97. Daylight Savings Time, hence the lateness of my first entry of the day. Feeling okay, a bit groggy. MASSIVE dreams last night, something about a haunted hotel, a bit like “The Shining,” but in an unusual twist for me, I was going around picking up energy and magical tools, and talking to some of the spirits, RPG-fashion, to combat the evil, and it looked like I was going to come out on top. I choose to regard that as an omen that I will/can overcome obstacles in my life if I pick up the tools and consult the right people. Also I killed a Jaws-like shark with a harpoon. Cool!  So yesterday’s calories are not great (1975), mostly due to beer, but at least I got quite a lot of exercise toting boxes up and down the stairs. My knees seem to be fine this morning. I’m not sure what we’ve got planned for the day. I might very well try to get in some gliding to combat all the eating I’ve been doing.  My offline journal is now 248 pages in a Word document. I’ve never kept a diary for so long. I used to attempt it once in a while when I was younger, but we didn’t have computers in the olden days, and it was too much work to handwrite it. I wish I had been able to do it, I would love to see what I wrote and thought when I was 16, 21, 31, etc. We sorted through a bunch of old slides yesterday, and found some that were taken just after we were married. Back then I had NO IDEA I looked that good. I thought I was really really really fat and frumpy and unattractive. Nope — I was really hot. And not terribly fat. Just slightly zaftig, but that’s all.   Sigh.  I wonder what it’s like to be a girl these days. I don’t know any teenagers very well, so all I can go on is what I see on afterschool specials and the MTV. On the one hand, there seems to be an insane pressure to be beautiful and sexy. The thin models have become WAY too thin, and that’s scary. On the other hand, there seems to be a greater diversity of beauty models available. More colors, more shapes and sizes, different ethnicities. In my day, there was pressure to be beautiful and sexy, though perhaps not quite as much as now, the thin models were still horribly thin, but there was only a very narrow range of acceptable beauty. Whatever, I’m saying I think there’s been a tradeoff.    11:46 a.m. Managed 60 minutes on the glider, yay for me.  Finished watching Sling Blade. Holy cow, what a movie.  That’s the saddest happy ending I’ve ever seen, or maybe the happiest sad ending. Anyway, fantastic, and I can see why that movie made Thornton famous — writer, director, actor, he’s brilliant in all aspects. And a good performance by John Ritter and the boy. Heck, everyone was good, even the evil guy.  1:27 p.m. I’m watching a program on transgenderism, and seeing a lot of parallels with being fat. They have the idea that their bodies don’t suit their SELVES; there’s a disconnect. The transgendered people are saying things like “I always felt I was in the wrong body.” And they believe that when they have the sex reassignment surgery, they will then be in the “right” body.  I’ve always had such strong doubts about whether that surgery solves anything. Now, if any transgendered people are reading this, I don’t disapprove and I don’t disbelieve you. It’s that I don’t understand it myself; I’ve never had any experience that led me to feel I was the wrong sex, so I just can’t feel what you’re feeling. My imagination and empathy don’t go that far. Where I do see a parallel is in believing that when your body is a certain way, then you’ll feel “right.” Because that’s sort of how I feel about being fat. One part of me radically rejects the idea that there’s anything about my body that I should change, that rejects the idea that there’s something “wrong” with me, and resents the holy hell out of the societal pressure to conform. But I can’t deny that my weight has had a massive effect on my life — more so than any other single aspect.  I bought into the idea that you can’t have a real life if you’re fat.  I was always waiting to lose weight before I would try to achieve anything, and of course that never happened. So I’ve spent a lot of my life on the sidelines. And I always believed that IF I lost weight, everything would change.  I don’t believe in that type of fairy tale anymore, but I have to admit I’m still hoping for and expecting change.  I think there will be change, but not in the way I thought when I was young, and it’s not going to all be positive. I know some of it will be annoying or confusing.  I’ve always seen being fat as a type of prison, a limitation on my life. When that limitation is removed, then what will I do? Who will I be? The confusing part is that I’m only now realizing how self-imposed that prison is. Not that I think being fat is self-imposed, but allowing one’s self to be restricted because of it. Being fat hasn’t made me less capable, less intelligent, less educated, or less talented, but I’ve acted as though it has. I’ve been afraid to strive for anything where there was the slightest hint of competition, because I’ve always assumed I would lose. Like there was no point in trying, because it was a foregone conclusion. Why go through the effort when you know the game is rigged?  That’s the way I always looked at it — whether it was trying out for a junior high school play or applying for a job last year.  It’s regretable, because it’s a weakness in me, or a vulnerable spot that makes me feel weak, when in reality I’m a very strong person.  Looking at those old slides has been unsettling to me. Seeing myself at 22, 23 years old, and realizing the incredible disconnect between what I thought I looked like and what I really looked like — my god. We didn’t have the phrase “body dysmorphia” back then, and we sure needed it. This isn’t all about vanity (although I will not argue that it’s partly involved), it’s about feeling wrong or lesser or bad because you don’t look the way you think you’re supposed to. Feeling invalid. So all that time I was limiting myself, counting myself out of the game, FOR NO REASON.  Okay, there IS a reason, it’s just not what I thought it was then. It wasn’t entirely the way I looked. Sure, that’s a part of it. I mean, I WAS fat. Fattish. It’s not something I just invented in my own head — I weighed more than my friends, my measurements were larger, I couldn’t wear the same kind of clothes, and people did sometimes indicate to me that I was “overweight,” and not generally in a kind way. And I will not underestimate the difference in the way fat and normal weight people are treated in society, but that’s a rant for another day. My point today is, how come this one aspect of me gained so much ascendancy that it completely ruled my life?  There are other areas in which I was less than perfect — I was terrible in math, I have the worst singing voice ever, and my hearing isn’t very good. All those things were important when I was 13 years old, but none of them controlled my life. How come I wasn’t able to view being slightly fat as an undesirable but not fatal part of my entire self?   Is it possible that, when you’re raised to be self-critical and ashamed and with no self-esteem whatsoever, that you will just pick out any old negative attribute, and use it as the focus of your failure?  Is it possible that even though my fat wasn’t in my head, the way it controlled my life was?  Those are all rhetorical questions, by the way. I guess it’s pretty obvious the answer is Yes to both.  I suppose this isn’t a new idea to anyone, but the whole realization is new to me, and I’m having to talk it out to myself at length to grasp it. So going back to the transsexual issue, is it possible that one’s physical sex doesn’t have anything to do with one’s satisfaction in life and sense of belonging? Is this a physical, permanent solution to what is actually an emotional and social issue? And is my losing weight going to be worth a shit unless I also address the emotional aspect?

       9:20 a.m. Saturday, Day 96. Oy! It was hard getting up this morning!  Salt. Yes, once again salt has disrupted my sleep, puffed up my face, and given me huge dark circles under my eyes. In case the chefs of the world are reading this right now, I would like to send a message to each and every one of them: STOP OVERSALTING THE DAMN FOOD IN YOUR DAMNED RESTAURANT.  Seriously, I need to just send the whole dish back to the kitchen as soon as I taste that bitter, metallic flavor. I mean, I asked for no salt, right? Did they somehow interpret that as “Please add EXTRA salt to my food, because you know my doctor said it would be good for me to raise my sodium intake significantly”?  I’m a little bummed about it, because I love that restaurant, but it’s getting to where it’s too risky to eat there. Can’t tell whether I’m going to be poisoned or not.  So other than that, it was a delicious meal and I had the most fabulous tangerine sorbet for dessert. Those people do know how to put together a sorbet. My calories? High. Very high. Very very high. To wit: 2448.  And here I would like to recommend http://www.nutritiondata.com. This site has nutrition data on the most extensive list of foods you’ve ever seen. It’s great for figuring out your stats on a restaurant meal. Type in “mashed potatoes” and you’ll get about eight or ten different variations to choose from (with butter, with milk, with 2% milk, etc.) and three or four portion sizes to choose from (2 tbs, 1 cup, 100 grams).  2:22 p.m. Cleaned out 7 boxes of video, super 8, three-quarter, film, and slides. Managed to throw away and consolidate down to 4 boxes. That’s pretty good!  I’m going to take some of the movies to Daisy, she can watch them and throw them away if she wants. And what a lot of DUST.  We’re also in the middle of tree pollen season here, and I have a headache and sore throat from it. That’ll teach me to dust once a year. Moved some of the boxes out to the garage. Now Bucko is probably going to fertilize the front lawn, and I’m not sure what I’m going to do.

       6:05 a.m. Friday, Day 95. Feeling pretty good today. Hopefully that will LAST and I won’t be a psychotic mess in a couple hours. I slept reasonably well, although as always I had too many vivid dreams and I tossed and turned a lot because my back hurt. Those two items can just be assumed to have occurred for any night.  I started having this issue with dreams when I quit smoking, which was something like seven years ago, I don’t remember exactly. I was using the Nicorette patch, and I wore it 24 hours a day. Now they have a version that you don’t wear at night. Presumably because of the slow influx of nicotine into my brain while I slept, I had the most incredible dreams every night. Huge, epic, brilliant, movie-like dreams. I still remember some of them, seven years later, and could write a screenplay based on them. Fortunately I wasn’t prone to nightmares during that period or I probably would have gone insane.  After I stopped using the patch, the dreams didn’t abate. Not for months. And the phenomenon has never disappeared entirely. I still have much more realistic and complicated dreams than I did before, though perhaps not quite as intense. Sometimes they wear me out because of the level of detail. People are supposed to have fewer and less intense dreams as they grow older, so I’m still waiting for that stage.  Came in at a high but not unreasonable number of calories yesterday (1696) considering how much I ate. Salmon was on sale this week, and last night I ate TWO large pieces. This is why I think I need to recommit to this diet, I’ve been doing some “automatic” eating like that. Just went back to the kitchen and took another piece and ate it before I even thought “maybe one piece is enough.”  If you’re going to eat past your goal, salmon is a good thing to do it on, but it reminded me that I haven’t been mindful of what I’m doing recently. Moments like these remind me why it’s taking so long to lose weight. Also why it’s good to track everything I eat. I can look at my charts and see that my calories per week have crept up a little, but not outrageously; it’s just that my “high” days are going a little higher than they used to. So I can exercise more; have lower “low” days; or cut back on the high days. The chart is so useful because how much I FEEL like I’ve eaten doesn’t have much to do with how much I’ve REALLY eaten.  10:16 a.m. 60 minutes of gliding and watched the first part of Sling Blade. Yep, it’s good.  4:31 p.m. Managed to paint the trim in the foyer today. It’s taking me about two hours per room, much slower than I’d hoped. I had a really horrifying thought today — here we are getting ready to sell the house, and I’ve worked 34 hours in the last three months. There’s no way we’ll qualify for a loan. I need to get off my butt and get some income for the next three months. I suppose I could go Daisy’s route and get a temp job... at least, I could TRY to get a temp job. She said she went to four or five different places before they would even talk to her!  Today is going to be a BIG calorie day. I’ve done okay so far, but tonight we’re going to Portobello’s for Bucko’s birthday. I’ll make the best choices I can, but it’s still going to be high. But no way am I going to a nice (and expensive) restaurant like that and ordering salad! Maybe I can compensate tomorrow with a lot of exercise (yeah, sure...). Anyway, I’m looking forward to a nice romantic dinner together.

       6:05 a.m. Thursday, Day 94. April Fool’s Day. I can’t say that particular holiday interests me as much as it did when I was in the 6-11 year old range. When you get into your 30s and 40s, you feel like the universe has handed you enough beastly practical jokes. Had PIZZA for dinner last night, which I absolutely loved and do not regret in the slightest, but of course I didn’t sleep well. Restless, stress dreams, woke up too early. I’m not in terrible shape, however, and perhaps will be able to nap later today.  My plans for today are to get Bucko one more birthday present (dvd of Snatch), create a new master list of what needs to be done around the house, check in at work and see where we are with that proposal, and if I really have my shit together, I’ll go to Home Depot and order carpet for the downstairs. I mean, it needs to be done. I just haven’t been able to bring myself to do something that I know will be so expensive. And I guess I’m feeling uncomfortable or a little scared about making a decision like that by myself. How in the world did I ever get to a place in my life where deciding to buy carpet can paralyze me for a week? No, seriously, how did I ever become so TIMID? And don’t tell me to self-care myself, because that was okay for yesterday, but today belongs to the iron-willed Puritan. Today I will accept all challenges with courage and resolve, and triumph over all. Also I have to remember to return the videos today.  I did not like the Royal Tenenbaums. I watched 33 minutes of it and gave up. Maybe if I watched longer, I would have had a change of heart, but I think half an hour of my life is long enough to spend on something I’m not enjoying. It’s obviously a great cast, but I don’t like the quirky style. Because that seems to be all there is to it, the style. They’re trying too hard.  I said I’m picky about movies, and I am. But I can’t believe the crap Hollywood churns out year after year. Dull, insubstantial, poorly written, predictable, barely-acted hunks of mediocrity. Sure, the Royal Tenenbaums was better than THAT, but still not enough that I saw any reason to watch it.  It reminds me of Forrest Gump — the whole time I was watching that movie I was thinking, “this movie is just not doing it for me, but I’ll bet the book is really good.” Apparently I don’t like that “one vignette after another” style. Maybe I’ll be inspired to play movie critic later, and put up a list of my favorites.  8:59 a.m. Did 30 minutes of gliding and ten minutes of lifting small weights. It wasn’t my best workout ever, I’m low on energy today. No doubt from the pizza. But what the hell, I DID it. Also watched another 30 minutes of the Royal Tenenbaums, since I needed something to distract me, and I’m still of the same opinion. Measured all the downstairs so I can get an estimate on carpet. That’s a good first step, right? Made the new To Do list.  It’s only 9 a.m. and I’ve accomplished things!  11:21 Okay, here’s what I did, and I am very happy that I’ve done something today. Got gas in the car; went to Ace and arranged delivery of 10 bales of pine straw and 4 bags of pine mcnuggets; returned the videos, bought Snatch and rented Sling Blade and The Lord of the Rings; and decided to talk to Bucko before I buy the carpet. No, I’m not really chickening out — part of my hesistancy about buying it is that he wants to just get the carpet cleaned instead of replacing it. So if I go buy it today, I’m doing it behind his back, and I’m not happy with that. I want to see if I can bring him around to my view, and if so then I’ll have no problem picking it out and buying it myself.  3:31 p.m. Painted the trim in the drawing room and the hallway.  I guess I had hoped to do the ENTIRE downstairs this afternoon, but it’s slower going than I expected. For one thing, I have to move furniture. And dust, because all the molding is filthy. And then there’s window frames and door frames as well as doors.  Had TWO Boca burgers for lunch and I’m stuffed.  5:24 p.m. I’ve been messing around with my blog template for a couple hours.  I’m trying to come up with an Impressionist painting color palette. That’s important, don’t you think?

       7:02 a.m. Monday, Day 154.  Are you wondering if I was awake last night from 3:00 to 6:00?  Well, I was not. I was awake from 3:30 to 4:30. Not bad for me. I don't feel horrible, but it's starting to catch up. My eyes are slitty little burning things in a puffy face. Yes, it's as attractive as it sounds.  A great many calories yesterday, let's just not discuss it. Today is a new week. We're off to look at carpet, that should be a load of fun. Although, it's so darned hot and humid today, I'm looking forward to getting into the extreme cold of an air-conditioned car. The deck guy dropped off some wood and tools this morning, I have a verbal OK for the permit and should get the paper tomorrow or the next day. All is going swimmingly.

       8:58 a.m. Sunday, Day 153. Feeling sort of medium today. Had another night of wakefulness from 3:00 to 6:00. On the plus side, there's always a late movie to watch. Last night I saw Wolf with Jack Nicholson and Michelle Pfeiffer. It wasn't bad. I must be in a more accepting mood at three in the morning than I usually am. Looks like about 1709 calories yesterday, so it's not likely I will lose any weight this week. According to my calculations, I have 1343 calories left for the week (meaning today) and I suspect I won't be under that. However, doubt I'll be much over either, so that means I won't GAIN any weight, which is always a good thing. I'm still riding high on my size-18 dress, so I guess I've thrown caution to the wind the last couple days.  Today we are going to stop by Bucko's work to pick up some lights, so he can take shots of Marella's pottery, so I can put together a web page for her. Then, since we'll be in the area, we'll drive around looking for a place to live. We are so close to putting the house on the market, we need to scramble and find a place to go after we sell it.  4:44 p.m. Okay, I have to eat my words. And everything else in sight, apparently. We went to a Mexican restaurant for lunch, and I had delicious vegetable tostadas, with rice and black beans and chips and salsa. I'm figuring that meal alone was about a thousand calories. So I will definitely not be losing weight this week!  I'm not displeased, though. My calories have been high, but I've been eating wonderfully health food and gorging on vegetables. You cannot believe how I am craving green things after that week (almost) of Atkins. Next week I'll start with the low-cal again. Keep things shaken up.  Bucko is out in the garage shooting Marella's pottery and I'm hiding inside. I will help when he gets to the point where I can do something useful, but for right now he has spent ONE AND A HALF HOURS setting up the lights. This is why I could never ever work in television or film production. I cannot stand the tedium of dicking around with things like that. I suppose to him it's not tedious; in fact he seems to be having a wonderful time. So all in all, a good day.

       6:39 p.m. Saturday, Day 152.  I have been TOO BUSY to enter anything in my journal until now. I can't even remember what all we did today. Grocery shopping first thing, like ten minutes after I got out of bed first thing, a trip to the video store, the liquor store, and home. Sprayed the clover in the lawn, painted all the windowsills (21 of them), moved all the boxes to the garage, rearranged the furniture in the drawing room, drilled holes in the back of the shelves for the wires to go through, oh I don't even remember the rest. We've been on our feet since about 9 a.m. and we're both exhausted. But we are so close to being done with the house. I should be able to get the permit Tuesday, I have a verbal approval over the phone and he's passing on the paperwork asap, so hopefully the contractor can start demolition right away and being building on Wednesday. Also I'm having a hell of a time remembering what I ate today — I've been running around too much to track. It's not going to be a low-cal week though: I had almost 3000 calories yesterday, because of the huge restaurant meal. Which was, by the way, fun as hell and I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I looked GORGEOUS in my new dress and Bucko was completely blown away and leched after me all night. Overall, a great evening.  That's all I have time for! Got to go collapse.

       7:25 a.m. Friday, Day 151.  Feeling good this morning. I am so saturated with vegetables now I feel 100% better. The last couple days I was not only fatigued, I was getting depressed. Feh. A large number of calories yesterday (1978), mostly due to beer consumption and Indian food buffet lunch. Anticipating an even larger number today, as we go out to dinner. Will try to compensate somewhat with breakfast and lunch. Should be a busy day today. Again with the building permit. Bucko has taken today off, for a four-day weekend, so we hope to get ALL the house-related chores done. Not sure that will happen, but we will at least shoot for it.

       6:43 a.m. Thursday, Day 150. I'm free! Free! Free!  No more meat! No more cheese! I can't wait to eat a big fat salad. A tomato. Red peppers. Zucchini and broccoli and snow peas. Aaaaaahhh.  As you can see, I've given up the low-carb thing a day early. I just can't take it anymore. I have to find a different way to shake up my diet next time, something that doesn't make me feel like crap. So anyway... I had a big fling last night, in celebration, and had a Wendy's burger and fries. AND a cup of blueberries for dessert, plus this and that, bringing my carbs to 164 grams. Versus the 16.8 grams of the day before. Hee. Ended up at 1816 calories, which is just over my diet goal, but not bad for a meat-filled, fast-food day. Planning on a LOT of vegetables today, to recuperate. And then, of course, tomorrow night is Cappers, and I will eat everything and anything.  The only good thing I'll say about eating high protein is that it was very filling. I didn't get nearly so hungry as I do on my regular diet. So I have learned that lesson, and will increase my protein from now on. Trying to do that without increasing fat is difficult, but I'm sure I can work in a few more grams. I'm not phobic about fat, especially not the vegetable fats I mostly consume, it's just that in order to eat low calorie, you're spending twice the calories per mass with fat as you do with carbohydrate and protein.   7:30 p.m. This has been the most fantastic day. First of all, the Measurement Pants are LOOSE. They are baggy. I shouldn't even wear them anymore. I did, however, because it's too hot for jeans, which are the only pants I have right now that fit. Anyway, I went to The Barn — Dress Barn — and saw in the window the exact dress I wanted for going out to dinner. It's perfect. It's pretty and flirty, and kind of a swirl of red and pink and orange. Cute as hell, probably too young for me but I don't care. So, I crossed my fingers and picked up a 20, and a 22 in another dress I was considering. Tried them on. Too big. WAY too big. I couldn't believe it — I kept checking the label to see if I really had a 20. Yep. Went back for an 18. It fits. And it's not tight, it's just right. In fact it's a little loose in the waist and hips (I have the not-unmixed blessing of a large chest, so my top half is generally a size larger than my bottom half).  I was SO excited I bought earrings and a necklace to match. Just little $6.99 earrings, but what the hell.   I haven't been excited about clothes for so long I can't remember. Probably not since I was a teenager. Actually, probably not even then, because I had a much lower tolerance for being fat. It was more of an issue to me. Boy, a little perspective sure changes things. 30 years and a hundred pounds later, a size 18 starts to look pretty damned good instead of a terrible tragedy. I went out to lunch with Marella later, for her birthday, and when I told her I fit into an 18, she said "You should go to Hecht's for some new pants, because their petite sizes go up to an 18." And I was floored. Shop in a department store? Like a normal person? Instead of the special fat store? I can't even imagine.  Well. Pardon my babbling. I'm just so excited.

       6:17 a.m. Wednesday, Day 149. I could sleep another six hours. Unfortunately, I need to be up at a decent hour to continue the good fight with the county Department of Permits and the Department of Ecological Health. I have become involved in an administrative snafu wherein no agency will admit authority or jurisdiction over the septic tank in my yard, and yet the building permit requires one of these agencies to sign off. Sigh. Talked to Bucko about it last night, and he had some good ideas: Call the Permit department directly, instead of DEH, and ask them what information they need from DEH to proceed issuing the permit. Perhaps that is information we can obtain from another source. Call that "Call before you dig" place, and see if they can find non-metal conduit in the ground. They could mark it so that the Permit people know the deck would not encroach on the septic tank. So I will have  another  day tied to the phone. Except, funk dat, because I'm going to the art museum today for the History of Paint lecture.  1689 calories yesterday, 186 grams protein, 16.8 grams of carbs. Look at all those sixes and eights. My least favorite numbers. Coincidence? Every muscle in my body feels weak and deteriorating. Two more days. Two more days. I have great hopes for this week, totally unfounded hopes.  urlLink This girlie  lost five pounds her first week of SB, and of course I wanted the same result. I don't think it's likely, as I am on Day Six with no apparent loss. At least I have shaken up my typical diet, which was my primary goal. Oh yes, it's shooken up alright.  It's only 8:27 and I already have the second coat done in my studio. I can paint the trim in about an hour. Then move all that furniture back in. Will call the Permit place at 9:00, if I haven't heard back from DEH guy.  4:25 p.m. Well folks, I'm calling a halt to the low-carb thing. I just can't take another day of it — I've felt exhausted since I started, and overall just not right. I need some vegetables.  In other news, I'm STILL dealing with the building permit. No end in sight.

       6:56 a.m. Tuesday, Day 148. Day FIVE of MeatWeek. Feeling pretty good today. I only woke up once, and went right back to sleep. Had a wonderful time at Daisy's, and we both drank very moderately, which no doubt helped my sleep. She made us steaks and a tiny salad, which was perfect for my Atkins-esque diet. Which I will report, once again, that I don't like. I don't care if  other  people do it, though. I just want to point that out, since I bitch about low-carb, that I'm talking about ME and low-carb, not YOU and low-carb. I don't think there's one method for weight loss, just as I don't think there is one method for weight gain. The simplistic "calories in--calories out" equation is only valid in a test tube, so you have to find what works. The proof is in the pudding, as they say. The no-fat, sugar-free, low-carb pudding.  Also I weighed myself at Daisy's, which I haven't done since April 7th. Good news: I've lost five pounds. Bad news: I've lost five pounds. On the one hand, I've been worried that I haven't lost any weight at all in the last couple months, so it's good that I've actually lost a small amount rather than just maintained or even gained. On the other hand, jeez louise! A measly five pounds for seven weeks of effort?  Well.  I'm trying to remind myself that losing a pound a week is reasonable. When I first went into this, I told myself it would take one to two years to achieve my target weight. So, apparently, it is. I'm going to enjoy and appreciate weighing 220, which is a number I haven't seen on a scale for five years. I'm not discouraged, just disappointed.   In other news, I've got an interview with the university temp service in two weeks. I have mixed feelings about that, also. I need to bring in some money, but I also want time to paint. Temp work will be full time with little pay, which is the worst of both possibilities. On the plus side, it's  temp  work; I can do it for a month and then quit. Yeah, that's what everyone says. I can quit any time I want to.

       6:23 a.m. Monday, Day 147. I'm up too early AGAIN.  Didn't get to sleep until 12:30ish, and then up at 5:30. What exactly is my problem?  Maybe too much protein, maybe severe mental problems. Who knows?  A good ending to the week, yesterday.  My chart tells me that I lost 1.5 pounds, even with three Meat Days at the end. My average calories per day was 1547, which is excellent. This is Day 4 of low-carb, and I am very tired of it. I think I can get through it, though. Monday-Tuesday-Wednesday-Thursday, and then on Friday I can eat vegetables and drink wine. Woo-hoo!   12:17 a.m. The morning's over and I don't have half my agenda accomplished. The powerwash guys are here, and I expected that to take one hour, but they've been here almost four. I guess they're very thorough. Also I'm in the process of getting a building permit for the deck, and that's a lot of confusion. We have an unusual septic/well situation, so we need to deal with a couple agencies and forms. Fortunately the deck footings will have the same footprint as the old, so they won't need to survey the lot, I think. But that's keeping me tied to the phone and fax machine, which means I can't be online (!). Man, it's time for cable modem.  I'm getting ready to cook some shrimp for lunch. And I'm going to have  lemon butter  with it. That's one of the things I really miss when dieting: butter.  I just crave it sometimes, and I could practically eat a stick of it. Don't worry, I've never done that.  I might have to nap again this afternoon. It will be a terribly unproductive day, but I've been going full tilt for a week, so perhaps today is my weekend. My day of rest.  3:35 p.m. Just finished watching Mona Lisa Smile.  It was better than I expected. I was  hoping  it would be entertaining enough to sit through, and it definitely was. There were some silly Hollywood contrivances in the plot, especially near the very-predictable ending, but overall I liked it. It has some of my favorite actresses — Julia Roberts (I don't know WHY I like her, but I do), Marcia Gay Harden, and Maggie Gyllenhaal. I really really like Gyllenhaal, and I have no idea where I've seen her before. I know I have, but I don't recognize any of the movies she's been in. Go figure.  I'm going to try the Measurement Shorts tomorrow...

       7:34 a.m. Sunday, Day 146. Day 3 of Meat Fest. I'm up much too early this morning, been awake since about 5:30. Since we didn't go to bed until after midnight, I'm dragging a bit. Couldn't sleep anymore, though, so I figured I'll get up and then have a lovely afternoon nap later. Ahhh.  A whopping 2049 calories yesterday. I'm not entirely sure that's accurate; I'm finding it harder to quantify what I'm eating. I might be overestimating. That's okay; I'm not so concerned with calories this week, I just want to have a ballpark idea of where I am.  I estimate 22 grams of carbs. Still not enjoying the low-carb plan. I'm not going to torture myself with it — if I feel awful I'll quit — but if possible I want to do it for the week. I have been feeling rather tired, but since this has been during two drinking days, that could easily account for it. Also getting 4 hours of sleep might be a contributing factor.  I'm planning to buy a new dress for our dinner next week. I am hoping hoping hoping that I can fit into a 20. I guess it will depend on the dress — I have some 20s in my closet right now that are too big for me, and some 22s that are too small. I'm planning on Dress Barn (isn't that a lovely name? Moo.) since they have the larger sizes. But their dresses are a little strange, it's hard to find something good. A lot of their stock is the kind of thing you see TV evangelists wearing on Sunday morning. I may be fashion-retarded, but that is not my first choice. Wouldn't it be cool, oh so cool, to shop in a regular store? I'm hoping for that to happen someday.   Talked to Daisy this morning, and I am so happy. Have you noticed that I hardly mention her anymore? That's because I never see her, because the evil ho-bag is working a very demanding temp job  and  interviewing two and three times a week. I'm really keeping my fingers crossed for her to land a good job, so that a) she will be able to pay her bills, and b) she can hire me.  Actually, reverse the order of those two items. Anyway, we're having dinner tomorrow at her house, where I will eat meat meat meat meat meat and we can drink and talk all night. Can't wait.

       9:13 a.m. Saturday, Day 145. Meat! Meat! Meat meat meatmeatmeat!  Mmmmmmeat!  Yes. I ate nothing but MEAT yesterday. Well, okay, I also had eggs and cheese. I am a bad-ass consumer of animals. Beware!  Not sure, but I think all that protein is making me aggressive.  Seriously, I'm not sure if I feel different. I sure don't  enjoy  the big meat diet, but I don't know if I actually feel bad because of it. I will report back on that subject in a couple days. If not sooner. I allowed myself a very small lettuce salad with half of a small tomato, and a drizzle of Paul Newman caesar dressing. That gave me 5 grams of carbs; two eggs gave me 1.2; I'm guesstimating the leftover quiznoids  sans pain  at 6; and the coffee with creamer, sugar, and Benefiber is 4. So a total of 16.2 grams of carb yesterday, vs. 146.5 grams of protein. And 116 of fat. I hope my arteries survive this. Remember Bart saying to Homer "But Dad, my heart hurts," and Homer says "Shut up and butter your bacon!" Or words to that effect.  And, I totalled 1752 calories, which is VERY good for a drinking day. So that's a relief.  4:23 p.m. I'm up to 813 calories, before dinner. A little more than usual, but overall I'm encouraged that I can still eat a reasonable amount of calories while gorging on meat. My diet range is 1300-1800 a day, so if I go 1600-2000 for this low-carb week, I think that's survivable. Naturally I'll aim for the lower end of the scale.

       6:12 a.m. Friday, Day 144. Woke up early, 5:30ish, but I'm feeling good. I think I fell asleep around 10 last night, so that's reasonable. I was  exhausted  yesterday, I kind of overdid it with all the house stuff.  Today I have to decide if I'm going to low-carb it this week. Still hesitant: most of my carbs come from the vegetables I eat, I'm not sure I want to cut them out or lessen my intake. (Although if I remember correctly, one can subtract carbohydrate calories according to the amount of fiber they contain.) I don't think I can achieve my current low-cals with a high protein diet. Not to mention the monotony of meat and cheese. On the other hand, it's just for a week to shake things up.  1354 calories yesterday. That's great considering I had half a Quiznoids sub and a beer. This has been one of my best weeks, calorie-wise, since I started dieting. Right now I'm averaging 1296 calories a day. Of course, that will shoot up quite a bit after the weekend, but I think I'll still have a good week. Maybe this is the time to do a shake-up — right after a low calorie week, have a high calorie week of meat. Hmm.  I just realized that in The Nutty Professor — the original, with Jerry Lewis — that when Lewis plays the obnoxious Buddy Love, he's imitating, to some degree, Dean Martin. Which is funny, because of all those Martin and Lewis movies they made together. Did everyone else in the world already know this in-joke except me?  9:50 a.m.  Okay, after all that shilly-shallying I've decided to go low-carb for one week. Please do not regard this as an endorsement of low-carb diets, because I think they suck. I consider this a very short-term change in diet to introduce confusion to my body. I'm just finishing a very low cal week, and I want to  change  what I'm doing, for the sake of change. Because I think change will help to prevent my body from adapting to low-calorie diet as SOP. Maybe that's bad science, I don't know, but the beauty of it is that I can do whatever I want, and account to no man. Hee.  In other news, I'm remembering why we want to move. In recent weeks, as we spiff up the house, I become more reluctant to sell it, because it looks nicer. A little Catch-22 there. However: this morning I am trying to ready materials for the SunFest show, and I am sweating out in the garage (humidity near 100%), trying to label and pack up disparate items such as flowerpots and coffee tables. I've got a bunch of accoutrements to this activity, such as Sharpies, labels, string, brown paper, packing tape, business cards, flyers, padding blankets, notebooks, etc. I had to gather all those items from four different locations in the house, not all of them on the same floor. And now I must return them to those locations.  I don't mean this as a boo-hoo-life-is-so-hard story, I mean it as an example of why it's difficult to run a business or serious sideline from a house meant for a family with no interests besides watching television, and why we need a house that has a basement or outbuildings or a bonus room or SOMETHING. We need  messy  areas.  1:37 p.m. Just got back from the grocery store with a cart full of meat, cheese, and eggs. It felt so WEIRD to buy that stuff. I pretended it was for someone else. Really. In the checkout lane I suddenly found myself blurting out to the cashier that we were having a cookout and everyone who is coming is on Atkins. I totally made that up, I totally  lied,  and it was completely spontaneous and unsolicited. It's not like she asked me about the food, like "Why are you suddenly buying all this meat and cheese when every week you come in here and buy 20 pounds of vegetables? I think we'll need to check your ID."  Also I bought a little breakfast tray, the kind you have for breakfast in bed with a newspaper and flower on the side, for $4.50 at Goodwill. So I have one more beach thing to paint.

       6:25 a.m. Thursday, Day 143. Feeling good, slept good, etc. I'm on a roll. 1380 calories yesterday, another excellent day. Finished the wine rack. That's everything currently on hand that I'm planning to bring to the SunFest in June. Now — should I try to get more stuff ready, or let it go? Undecided.  Back in the day, when I was a tiny young Marla at her first professional job, we didn't have computers. That is, computers existed, but they were large mainframe things with their own rooms, if not their own buildings, and they had nothing to do with normal life. Hee. The way I did my work, in those days, was sitting or standing at a giant drawing board that had hydraulics involved in lifting and positioning it, with a 6' wide crossbar. I used tools and equipment that I haven't seen in years now. A waxer. No, not for your legs, for applying a thin coat of wax to the back of galleys, so that you could rub them onto a board (not wood, illustration board) in order to "paste up" a "layout." The wax was a great technological improvement over rubber cement, because it was repositionable. You could kind of slide the little piece of paper here and there until it was straight, and then rub it down with your  burnisher.  The only drawback, as I discovered to my great regret one day, is that wax MELTS when it gets too hot, which causes the little pieces of paper with the words and pictures on them to slide around the board willy-nilly, which is what happened when I delivered five boards to the printer one summer day, transporting them in the back seat of my behemoth 1969 Chevy Impala with no air conditioning.  5:51 p.m. I'm not sure I can even keep track of everything I did today.  The macro story is I cleaned up the bedroom, master bathroom, and closet. The micro story is I went up and down the stairs about 24 times; moved furniture around; climbed up and down the ladder a dozen times; cleaned, caulked and painted six windows; installed hardware on the six windows; sewed curtains for the six windows; packed the winter clothes; threw away the old clothes; hauled said clothes out to the garage; patched all the nail holes in the walls; sanded and painted the nail holes, packed the paintings and mirrors; painted the trim in the bathroom; and then fell down. I know I'm leaving things out, but I'm too tired to think of them. Literally. I had just enough strength to call Bucko on his way home and send him to Quiznoids. Which I hope I don't regret, but I haven't the energy to think of anything else.  I haven't done any deliberate exercise in a week and a half, but boy oh boy I don't feel the least need.

       7:41 a.m. Wednesday, Day 142.  Feeling good today, a bit slow: lost an hour or two of sleep in the middle of the night. This time I definitely blame the wine. A decent numer of calories yesterday, 1479. Had tilapia filets and broccoli for dinner. I stirred up some low-fat mayo and mustard, smeared it on the fish, then topped with a mixture of chopped sunflower seeds, crushed Ritz crackers, and a tiny sprinkle of brown sugar. That's what I had in the house to mimic chopped pecans, and it worked quite well. Bake at 350 for 12-15 minutes. It's always hard to tell when tilapia is done; it doesn't get flaky like other fish, so be careful not to overcook. I will be having this for lunch today, also.  I've been feeling remotivated the past few days. After being so depressed and discouraged, I've taken an upswing. Have NO idea why — maybe writing it through in my journal helped, maybe it's random. I think the tiny progress I'm seeing has a lot to do with it. I feel like I can stand this, can stand anything, if I just know it's working.  Warning: long, dull, pointless bitching follows:  Yesterday I went to Kmart looking for these Curvation brand bras and panties, which come in large sizes and are inexpensive. I read about them SOMEwhere, can't remember where. I thought, how wonderful to have  pretty  underwear for a reasonable price, something I haven't experienced in 20 or 25 years. I mean, I can spend a wheelbarrow-full of money at a specialty lingerie store, but I can't just walk into one of the Marts and buy a cute blue-with-lilac-stripes bra and matching panties for $16 the way average-sized women can. I can buy white, tan, or black heavily-constructed butt-ugly bras for $15, and a roll of  very  brightly colored underpants for $6. So I found the Curvation bras, all four of them, in the lingerie department at Kmart. They were ALL black or white. On the same display they had another brand, cannot recall the name, let's call it Other, which had pretty pink-with-polka-dots, lavender-with-flowers, pale-green-with-stripes bras. In my size, I might add. Perfect, I thought. Let me just find the matching panties...  yeah. Where are the matching panties? There was ONE pair of panties, two sizes too large for me. So I looked over in the panties section. Couldn't find any Other brand panties. Looked high and low (panties in my size are generally high; they put the tiny ones on the bottom of the rack. Seems dangerous to stack it that way, might tip over. Anyway...). I found some really pretty underpants in gorgeous colors, but they were Another brand. On the package label it said "Matching bra available!"  If you say so, but I can tell you it's not available within the same store.  I tried mixing 'n matching bras from one brand, underpants from another, but couldn't get a reasonable combination. And that was the thing I was trying to avoid in the first place — I'm tired of wearing a mismatched white bra with a turquoise and magenta panty. So I would like to ask Kmart: What the hell did you think you were doing? What sort of bizarre stocking scheme was that? And I would like to say to Just My Size, Hanes, and Fruit of the Loom: Why in the world do you think a woman would NOT want softly-colored, pretty, feminine underthings simply because she weighs X number of pounds more than the model you designed these things on? Why do you think this woman would WANT to limit herself to white or hideous primary colors with infantile patterns on them? And another thing, Just My Size in conjunction with Kmart: Am I mistaken, or are you not supposed to specialize in plus-sized bras? And if so, why the hell is the entire display stocked with 36 C bras? Because that is NOT just my size.  Was that the most boring, uninspired bitch session ever? Yes, it was. Sorry.  5:14 p.m. I'm considering Going Atkins for a week, starting with May 21 and ending May 28 (the night we are planning on eating at Cappers). I'm not decided yet — in general, I don't support the high-protein diets, because they are also high fat and low vegetable. There are aspects of health other than weight to consider, and I don't feel healthy on a protein diet. On the other hand, I want to shake up my eating and try something different for a short period of time. I just took an average of six random days, and I'm eating 32% protein, 55% carbohydrate, 13% fat.  While I'm happy about the fat, I could try reversing the protein and carb ratios. I think I could do that for one week, hopefully rev up the metabolism (or whatever...), and return to healthy eating after the seven days.

       6:26 a.m. Tuesday, Day 141. Got up too early today, I can tell from my beady eyes that I should have slept longer. I feel good though, and I was ready to get up, so I did. An astounding 972 calories yesterday. Holy shit!  I didn't exactly intend to eat that low, but once I got past lunch with only 495 calories, I decided to go with it and see if I could stay under 1000. It wasn't too difficult, because I had chicken salad (i.e., lettuce salad with chicken pieces) for lunch and dinner. You can have a whole lot of lettuce for 30 or 40 calories. So anyway, great. It's not going to be my goal from now on, because it's much too low for everyday consumption, but it does help to balance out the high days.   Also painted that cabinet/shelf dealie. I found out why it cost only $7 in Goodwill — it had a big old gouge out of the top. Didn't have any wood filler, so I fixed it with my own concoction: paste of wood glue and cream of wheat. Worked great. So yesterday I painted a little ocean scene on the front, framed with some tropical flowers around the edges and along the top. It's pretty cute. It has been difficult for me to paint beach stuff, which is usually light and airy and pretty, and that is NOT my style. So it's a good stretch for me to paint flowers and the like. The day before I painted a really heinous mess on the wine rack, so I had to scrape that off and reprime. Not sure what I'll do with that, but I should work on it today.  *Can I tell you I am completely smitten with that little "Marla is..." Google game? Smitten, I tell you. For one thing, the name "Marla" is featured in a lot of Internet pornography. A LOT. Who knew? My self-absorption knows no bounds: "Marla Is" simply wasn't enough, I also did "Marla Was" (not recommended, you get a lot of obituaries), "Marla Will Be" and "Marla Thinks."  I am so fascinated by it, I am going to use one in every post. Be warned!   Ballooning.  I am SICK of hearing this word, as in "Mary's weight suddenly ballooned up to 185 pounds." Or whatever number of pounds. You can't turn on Discovery Health Channel without seeing a show about weight loss surgery (more about that later), and you can't see a show about weight loss without hearing the ballooning phrase. I hate it. It sounds like someone stuck a bicycle pump up Mary's ass and inflated her with pork grease, or some sort of special heavy air. How about a more realistic, less stupidly dramatic phrase, such as "Mary gained 45 pounds," or the more verbose "Mary's weight increased from 140 to 185 pounds, a gain of 45 pounds in two years." Or AT LEAST consult your thesaurus once in a while for a different silly word. How about if Mary swelled, bulged, surged, billowed, expanded, boosted, or aggrandized her way to 185 pounds? How about if she waxed obese? Maybe her pounds mushroomed or pyramided, unfurled or upsurged, escalated, mounted, proliferated, pullulated, swarmed, or snowballed.  1:19 p.m. Today I bought:  two cans of spray paint, white and cream three rolls of packing tape one bra, white one sweatshirt-gray-colored tank top, size XL (too small) two lipsticks, Copper Dust and Iridescent Punk    I mean Pink six foam paintbrushes two bottles of wine one liquid eyeliner  I'm not sure, but I think it sounds like I'm getting ready for a big evening.  Also, I wish to take this opportunity to complain, again, about how bad Kmart sucks and how ugly their larger size clothing is. You're in pretty sorry shape, Kmart, when you make Wal-Mart look good. Also, please explain to that bitch in Customer Service that the proper expression is "Can I help you?" not "Did you have a question?".

       Marla is looking for interesting places to perform. Marla is running and winning races all over the United States today. Marla is his feminine side. Marla is definitely a real, living character. Marla is Going to Iowa. Marla is the most professional, honest, person. Marla is a wonderful psychic reader. Marla is a stopping point. Marla is one of the few, the proud, the original. Marla is in your extended network. "Marla is terrific, sensational!" says Lou. Marla is a Florida Gator who moved to Sarasota. Marla is now over me again. Marla is having a bit of a hard time. Marla is a pure-bred, 14-month-old female fawn-colored boxer. Marla is astonished by their claims. Marla is soft-spoken, humorous, down to earth. Marla is (against her will) sucked into a board. Disagreeing with Marla is something sane people avoid. Marla is in the perfect setting for listening to gossip. Marla is doped on despair. Marla is well-maintained and features creek crossings. Marla is a fantasy. Marla is so fast Marla is the key and the lock Marla is so much more than a dead ringer for Bette Midler. MARLA IS NOW A TUPPERWARE MANAGER! Marla is a skillful billiards player. Marla is actually a quite pretty name Marla is aware of the Huxley. Marla is a threat to the narrator from the get-go. MARLA is still on the floor.

       7:08 a.m. Monday, Day 140. First of all,   urlLink Tahiti photos are here!    You will see a list of photo albums on the left; click French Polynesia to see a few representative pix of our recent trip. If you click on the photo you will get a larger view and a more descriptive caption. Also in the album Various, you can see a picture of me as a young puppy, graduating from school in 1981. More to come.  Secondly, slept well last night, feel pretty good this morning. Came in under goal last week; theoretically I lost 1.25 pounds. The mShorts do seem a tiny bit looser today, I hope I'm not imagining that. Took my measurements, after a month of abstaining, and I  think  I see progress there, too.  I seem to be unable to get accurate measurements, so I'm not relying on that too much. Anyway, I feel considerably more cheerful than yesterday, regardless of the measurements. I think I was so determined to get out of that weaselly mood that I planted a sort of hypnotic suggestion to myself. You WILL feel better, you WILL, you WILL...  So I said I would write in more depth about this attack of self-loathing I had yesterday. I don't even know where to start with that. It seems so complicated and confusing to me. I don't loathe  other  fat people. Sure, I don't like to be around people who are insecure, hostile, or defensive, which are traits that can be caused by a low self-esteem due to being overweight. But fatness itself? A neutral attribute, when I see it in other people. That makes me think it's not fatness  qua  fatness that bothers me about myself; maybe the fatness symbolizes all the other issues. It's the easiest one to focus on, the most tangible.  Maybe everyone, regardless of weight, consolidates all their problems under the heading of a single, simple manifestation.  And probably you pick the single manifestation for which you will receive the most agreement from the rest of society. You're going to have a hard time getting everyone to buy into the idea that your slightly-stubby left thumb is a huge social handicap that has scarred you tragically, but you will find lots of validation for the theory that your weight, big ass, crooked nose, receding hairline, or small boobs are ruining your life. You will also find a  lot  of people and organizations who are happy to take your money in the pursuit of "fixing" those problems.  I have a friend (Daisy, who else), who has a lot of the same psychological issues I do, the insecurity, paranoia, low self-esteem, and extreme introversion. We joke about how similar our psyches are (also we were born on the SAME day, ten years apart). Here is someone who typifies the ideal of female beauty in our society. Tall, thin, long-legged, blonde, incredible smile, beautiful features. She looks like a model or actress. She also typifies my ideals of a cool friend: smart, funny, talented, witty, kind, generous, and bizarre. So from my perspective, she's pretty much the perfect person. Yet she has these weird self confidence issues. Somehow, this perfect woman has found a way, or been made to find a way, to feel invalid.   How can she feel that way when she's not even fat?? That's what makes me think we all find  something  to hang our problems on, and name it as THE problem. There are other people as fat - fatter - than I am, who don't have the self-esteem problem. Something about them, either inherent or in their upbringing, enabled them to disregard the bad things society is saying about them. I want to be that way. I want to lose weight AND not hate being fat. It's not the paradox it seems, if you regard losing weight as a beneficial but not required activity. Like, if you learned another language, that would be an enhancement to your life, right? But it's not like your life sucked and you were worthless  before  you learned the language. That's how I view, or want to view, losing weight.  I know I haven't addressed the attack of self-loathing very directly, but I'm not sure what to say about it. All my strength and sense of self are completely undone when I see photographs. It's like Kryptonite to me. I'm angry and hurt (by/with myself) when it happens, and then I spend a couple weeks not looking in mirrors. When I see a photo of myself, it's not just that I don't like my shape, it's that it doesn't FEEL LIKE ME. That is not how I feel inside! I don't mean something retarded like "there's a thin girl inside me," I mean that my posture, my expressions, my very body language, do not accurately represent what is going on in my head, because the translation from mind to body becomes blurred by the fat. I will be feeling, for instance, very relaxed, and I think I am expressing that feeling by the loungeful and cool way I am perched on my bar stool like Lauren Bacall, and then I'll see a photo of me and I look hunched over, dense, uncomfortable. I look like Danny DeVito. And dammit, that's not how I felt!  I felt like Lauren Bacall!  But my body refuses to take on the correct aspect to convey simple emotions. No, it doesn't refuse, it's DOING it, but no one can see it, because the shapes and outlines are different on me. They represent the wrong thing, and I always wonder, how are people perceiving and treating me, based on what they are seeing? They are not seeing the cool lounging, they are seeing discomfort and awkwardness. They are not seeing ME.  And then I slap myself, and say "How do you think people with blatant physical disabilities feel? How do you think someone in a wheelchair feels about being invisible or not perceived as who they are? And you're crying about being FAT? Stop your stupid, weak whining!"  So you see, I don't even allow myself a nice wallow in self pity. First I hate myself for being fat, then I punish myself for feeling bad. Gee, who needs enemies? Maybe if I did allow myself a wallow, I would get over it faster. I could just boo-hoo for a couple minutes, and then say "Okay, well, enough of that, I got stuff to do today...".  I don't think I can write any more about this today. I haven't solved it, but I'm not sure it's solvable. Not once-and-for-all. Never fear, it will come up again and I can write about it some more. The fun never stops!

       6:55 a.m. Sunday, Day 139. Slept well, feel good, a little burny-eyed. 1749 calories yesterday, very good for a Saturday and a drinking day. I also have almost 3,000 calories available for today, if I chose to eat that much!  I'm thinking I'll try to avoid it...  3:33 p.m. I feel awfully depressed.  I was going through some photos to upload, so you all can see them (which by the way are  urlLink here ) and I was, as always, truly horrified at how I look. I so hate myself for thinking that, I so very much don't want to allow myself that self-loathing, and yet, my god, how does anyone get around it?  I'm so saddened by this, I promise I'm going to write about it later in depth, but right now I don't have the energy. And tomorrow, when I'm in a better mood, I will add my photo link to my blog template and be all happy and excited about it. Really, I will.  * Apu to Homer.

       6:14 a.m. Saturday, Day 138. Slept very well last night, for me. Only woke up once or twice, back didn't hurt, dreams were mild. A very wonderful 1689 calories yesterday, on my HIGH day. How did that happen? I will tell you: I missed lunch. Yeah, not a good way to diet, but it wasn't deliberate. Then had a moderate dinner. So I am averaging 1578 a day so far this week, which is perfect. I have discovered frozen, pitted red cherries. That is a delicious dessert. Higher in calories than the blueberries, but manageable.   Watched part of Searching for Bobbie Fisher last night.  I'm not quite getting into it; it seems very contrived and heavy handed. Someone whose opinion I respect recommended it to me, so I want to give it a chance. Maybe I wasn't quite in the right mood, or maybe we just have different taste in movies.  I want to say a little something about Bucko. You know, sometimes I take that man for granted. I've mentioned, haven't I, that we've been married for 20 years? (yes, it's just as weird to me.)  We're still fabulously in love, which is not to say we don't have our little  moments,  but still... Anyway, I wasn't fat when we met and when we married. Not that I was slim, either, but I weighed about 135 when he first saw me (the summer after 9th grade. Hah!). And maybe 150 when we married. A lot of men, if their wife gained approximately 100 pounds, would be very, shall we say...  disturbed  by it. A lot of men would be downright rude, cruel, and horrible about it. Yet Bucko has never, ever, indicated that he finds me anything less than fiendishly attractive and due every degree of worship and respect. And sometimes I don't appreciate how rare a quality that is in a man. But the great part? I never, ever, expected anything else from him.  I think that speaks well of both of us.  p.s. don't get all creepy and feel sorry for us that we've known each other for 27 years and been married for 20. We were both complete WHORES in school (and this is in the late 1970s sex-n-drug-fest, I might add), we didn't date each other as teenagers, and we didn't get married until after school, so it's not as though we've never had any EXPERIENCES besides each other, if you get my drift.

       7:36 a.m. Friday, Day 137. I took a melatonin last night, and it kicked my butt. I'm groggy but well rested. I "overslept" by an hour!  I put overslept in quotes because I don't set an alarm; I usually wake up so early there's no need. Anyway, slept without interruption until 6 a.m., then fell asleep again until 7:30. I guess I needed to catch up.  Enough about that. 1126 calories yesterday, good news. Today is Friday, my high day, and I'm back on track. Here's what a typical day is like for me, and this is a good example because it's not perfect, I eat some crackers:  Breakfast - half a can of soup, coffee with creamer and sugar: 158 calories Snack - cantaloupe: 188 calories Lunch - 1 chicken breast, bunch of green beans: 278 calories Snack - 12 Ritz crackers, 2 eggs: 342 calories Dinner - Wendy's chicken salad, my own dressing, and cup of frozen raspberries: 492 calories.  For a grand total of: 1458. Now, on a really good day I don't eat eggs or crackers, I eat an apple or leftover bean salad. About the same calories, but more nutritious. On a drinking day, I'll add another 230 to 800 calories of alcohol, depending (800 calories is a martini day). You can see why I am annoyed with myself when I drink too much, it's mostly a matter of the extra calories. Another typical pattern is that I eat more later in the day. I can restrain myself better in the first half, by late afternoon I'm very hungry and less likely to practice portion control. So we can see that I am not as adjusted to this diet as I think I am, it's not what I consider normal eating. Also it makes me aware I have to spend more effort on having good food in the house. Like, whenever I have crackers or eggs or some other food that I would prefer not to eat, it's not because I had a giant craving for it and ran out and got some. It's because I was hungry and there wasn't anything else in the house.   Today I go to the Orifice for a few hours in the afternoon. Good, more paycheck. Not sure what I will do this morning, maybe numbers 4 and 5 from yesterday's list. Also need to grocery shop. Here is the recipe for my  urlLink bean salad.   4:42 p.m. Got most of Item 4 (clean and paint utility room door) done.  I just have to flip it over and do the second side. Item 5, feh, I guess Monday. Just got back from the Orifice, billed 2 hours, fairly painless. Having a glass of wine and some wasabi peas. Oh yeah.

       6:39 a.m. Thursday, Day 136. Felt a little groggy when first got up, and my eyes are rather beady, but I feel okay. Had a nightmare about being chased by some sort of monster, woke up at 4:00 a.m. but went back to sleep pretty easily. So whatever, what else is new.  1164 calories yesterday, which is good because I had a lot of compensating to do. 2027 Monday, 1886 Tuesday, and those are supposed to be my low calorie days. I'm not exactly Doing a Wendie, but I don't want to eat the same amount and type of food every day, I want to shake it up a little. Generally at the beginning of the week it's easier for me to stay on the low cal end, but my plans went all awry this week. Thus the low cal days to compensate. Tried the mShorts yesterday and they seem a smidgen looser. Hard to say. Bucko is ALL into going to Capper's, whether I fit in the shorts or not, because of that half-off coupon. I don't think I can reasonably deny him the chance to go, if I don't happen to fit into the Shorts by the end of the month, which I don't think I will. However, I will continue to work toward that goal as if the reward were still pending. I'm still frustrated with myself for being 95% on goal. If I'm going to not diet/exercise enough that I don't lose weight, it would be more fun if I ate some pizza or something like that, instead of apparently eating just a smidge too much salad. Actually, what got me on Tuesday is that I was trying to compensate so hard for Monday, that I was STARVING by dinner time, and ate two pieces of salmon instead of one, thus adding 350 calories, which is pretty much the amount that would have kept me exactly on plan (if I hadn't eaten it.) Follow me? I must recommend that you do not, even in the metaphorical sense.  Here's what I am going to do today:  1. Fix all the hundreds of thumbtack holes in the walls of the office. They are just big enough that paint alone will not plug them; I have to spackle, sand, and blot with paint, which hopefully will blend in when dry. 2. Finally paint the foyer thing upstairs. 3. Clean the so-called utility room (half as big as a closet, but it does hold the washer/dryer and vacuum cleaner. It is remarkably filthy for a room that is used to clean other things. 4. Clean and paint the door that is supposed to close off the utility room from the hallway, so it can be reinstalled. 5. Call the powerwash guy recommended by the carpenter who was out here to look at our deck yesterday.  If I can manage all those things, then I'll see about adding on to the list.  2:08 p.m. Here is what I have accomplished:  1. Done. I think the touch-ups are reasonably blended in. I can see them if I really look, but I don't think anyone else is going 2. Done. It took me an hour and a half to get one coat up, and it needed two coats. That Duron paint is like WATER. Then I took a break for a little snackie: one fat-free Ball Park hot dog and several slices of Pompeian Fire Roasted Red Peppers (for some reason this is the Brand Name Paragraph). Here's what I love about those peppers: one 4 oz. serving is 30 calories. 0 fat. One serving has  100 percent  of your daily vitamin C requirements and 42 percent of your Vitamin A. There is no added sugar. I love you, Pompeian Fire Roasted Red Peppers. In a special way. Um, back to the list:  3. Done, including re-grouted along the edge of the floor.  Item 4 might have to wait for another day. And 5 I think I can do after lunch. Having a good food day so far. I'm planning on salmon for lunch, probably yellow squash and chicken for dinner.

       6:27 a.m. Wednesday, Day 135. I slept all the way through until 5:00 this morning, and then managed another 45 minutes dozing. I attribute this to two things: I took a melatonin and I went to bed at 11:00.  I think I've been going to sleep too early, in order to catch up, and it's working against me. Maybe I'm waking up early because I'm falling asleep early.  Since Bucko gets up at 5:30, we've gotten into an early-night routine, but it's not working well for me.  Yesterday was a good day. Got a lot of stuff done. Half the office is now bordered. The other half today, and also I will clean the upstairs windows. I can't believe how sharp and clear everything looks with the screens down and several years' worth of grime wiped away. And that's just cleaned on the inside, the outside is still filthy.  Here's how much I miss Daisy, since we no longer work at the same place, and she is more or less gainfully employed (with little actual "gain") and thus has no time to sloth around with me: I have taken to checking the "Yes, please send me more information about your programs and product offerings" boxes, just so I will get some email. It's breaking my heart everytime I look and all I get is "You have no new email."  4:23 p.m. Does anyone want to hear about Secondhand Lions? Good, because I want to tell you.  I'll give it a B-.  It's pretty uneven. Some of it's good, but the plot is not entirely coherent, and the focus wanders a bit. Kids will probably like it, and I guess after all that's who it's aimed at. So I would say: If you get the opportunity to watch it, do so, but don't make a special trip to Blockbuster. On the other hand, Lost in Translation is excellent, and I highly recommend it. The  urlLink Ebert review  is worth reading, if you want to get an idea what it's like, and it's a great description of Bill Murray's performance.

       6:58 a.m. Tuesday, Day 134.  Slept like HELL last night. Woke up around 1:00 a.m., all restless and weaselly, and never got back into the groove until around 5:00.  And here I am at 6:58, wide awake and scratchy-eyed. Yesterday the power went off around 4:40 p.m., and stayed off until sevenish-ish, so Bucko and I hied ourselves to the nearest sushi emporium, and stuffed ourselves. Is it the sushi? I don't know. Since I've been tracking my food consumption so closely, I always think I'm going to discover what causes the bad nights, but so far there's no rhyme or reason. Like, for a while I thought it was red wine. Then the next time I had red wine I slept fine. Also the corollary: the next time I slept poorly there was no red wine involved. So what the eff?  Anyway. An unexpected high calorie day yesterday, from the eating out. Today, the compensatory low calorie day. I think I can manage, I have a lot of vegetables in the house. Not sure what I'm going to do today. I suppose I should fax my resume, now that the proposal is over and no other work in sight. And, as yesterday, I want to get as much house-related stuff accomplished as possible. There's no way we're going to get this thing on the market anytime soon if we don't pick up the pace. "We" meaning Bucko.  11:07 a.m. Did half an hour of glider sprints, while watching O Brother Where Art Thou. I've seen it once before, really liked it. I'm considering dropping cable and signing up with NetFlicks. Hmmm, big decision. Daisy is going to, and of course I have to do whatever she does.  Also managed to get my resume off to university temporary services and also state temporary services. They told me their pay rate is 8 to 10 dollars an hour. Which means if I can get 12 hours a week at The Orifice, I'm better off. Now if only I could get that 12 hours... Today I hope to wash all the windows on the inside, and paint the foyer upstairs, which I did not do yesterday, but I did write bills instead.  1:57 p.m. Got a lot done so far today. Washed all the windows downstairs, it takes a lot longer than I expected. Perhaps when you wash windows once every six years, the dirt kind of builds up. I also found time to lay in the sun for 30 minutes and read a book. Ahhh. That's the life. I think what I will do with the rest of the afternoon is, instead of cleaning windows upstairs, I will get the rest of the office done - paint the trim and clear off the monitors so Bucko and I can put up the wallpaper border tonight. Don't want to be dripping paste onto the computers. I had a delicious sauteed zucchini with red bell pepper slices, and a cup of blueberries for dessert. I'm only at 358 calories so far!  I'm going to need a little snackie before dinner, but will limit it to veggies or maybe one of those no-fat hot dogs (45 calories). I will eat it bunless with relish and more red pepper slices. It's ironic that the hot dog is less than half the calories of the bun.  4:44 p.m. Got the office prepped for hanging the border. The reason we're hanging a border, by the way, is to cover up the previous border, which was a poor choice. Very poor. This will now be the only room in the house with wallpaper of any kind.  I have to say: don't hang wallpaper. It's tempting, because there are SO many kinds and they're just so rich and elaborate, but you'll regret it. They go out of style and look dated very quickly, plus they start to look ragged around the edges after a few years. Then they're a bitch to remove. Paint will also go out of style and look beat up, but it's MUCH easier to put on a fresh coat of paint than deal with wallpaper.  I'm at 448 calories, with dinner left to go. But: we're having salmon caesar salad tonight, so I think I can stay under 1200 pretty easily. Which will balance yesterday.

       7:01 a.m. Monday, Day 133. The first day of Week 20.  Yesterday ended up at 1,578 calories, for a weekly total of 12,102.  Not bad, not great. According to my calculations, I should have lost one pound. I didn't get nearly the exercise I wanted, because of so many hours working, but I will concentrate on that again this week. Out of the seven days, I worked out 60 minutes one day, 30 minutes two days, and some serious gardening one day. I managed to exercise 4 out of 7 days, so it's not HORRIBLE, just not where I wanted to be.  Apparently I have suddenly become tired of soup for breakfast, because I just can't bring myself to eat it. I ate some leftover red potatoes instead, and now am annoyed after looking up the nutritional facts. It's about twice the calories of the soup, so I'm already 150 calories above my normal diet, meaning I need to take that out of somewhere else.  Sigh. Some days the  bother  of counting calories is intolerable. It's not so much that I have a giant craving to eat excessively, it's that I have a giant craving to not OBSESS about it. I have other things I want to do besides count every bite that goes in my mouth. I've said it before, I'll say it again (and again): Dieting is the process of deliberately  creating an eating disorder  in an otherwise normal person.  In other news, I see Blogger has changed their interface a little bit, and offer new blog templates. Will I be tempted to change templates, and thus spend an entire day trying to tweak it to my liking? It's possible.  1:43 p.m. Here's what I have done today: Removed all the screens from the windows, washed them, and stored them in the garage. But Marla, you are no doubt saying, this is the time of year when you put screens ON the windows. Au contraire, mes freres: in the South, this is the time of year when you know you will not open a window again for five months, because it is too blasted hot. I will be living in A/C from now until October 15. Also: I have washed two loads of laundry plus a load of sheets, and put clean sheets on the bed and the guest bed. I have touched up the ceilings in every room in the house. Now I am preparing to go paint the foyer or whatever you call that little area where the stairs arrive upstairs. I also DID choose another template from Blogger, but I spent only 30 minutes dicking around with it. I am drinking a lot of water. I am not eating much. This is good.

       7:36 a.m. Sunday, Day 132.  I feel a bit squirrelly today, like I have so many things to do I can never get caught up. I'm feeling overwhelmed. It's probably because I just worked three ten-hour days in a row, and then Saturday, so in fact I  haven't  been able to get things done. I need a day to recuperate from that. Once in a while I can step outside my current panic and see the larger picture like that, to realize, Oh yes, well of course it's perfectly normal to feel like this. But most of the time I'm to close to my own problems, too  in my own head  to see it. Probably that's when it helps to have a counselor of some type. That outsider's perspective to slap you upside the head.  So yesterday was another high day, 1971 calories. I got one of those new salads from McDonald's (it was okay) but I also succumbed to a small French fries. Huge calories. So today I really must compensate with an all-veggie day. Which then means I need to get to the grocery store this morning. After I eat my half-can of soup, there's not a thing in the house. Sunday morning is a good time to shop, the stores are empty, but I also want to get some serious yard work (digging and planting) done before it gets hot - supposed to be 88 degrees today.  I might have to shop while Bucko digs, which I think is a perfectly wonderful division of labor.  Did I mention that I wore the original Measurement Pants earlier in the week, and they were actually a bit loose? That was great. I'm really trying to show some progress this month, specifically to fit into the Measurement Shorts, and my losses have been so tiny they're barely measurable. But at least now I know that I  am  losing, be it ever so slowly.  12:19 p.m. A good day, squirrelliness mostly banished. Went shopping, got a lot of vegetables, and salmon was on sale for $2.99 a pound. Incredible. Bucko mowed the lawn, and I finished planting the bushes and installing the brick edging. Said edging requires a prodigious amount of digging, sweating, and cursing. So I have fulfilled my exercise quota for today.

       7:15 a.m. Saturday, Day 130.  I’m awake much earlier than I want to be. I wanted to sleep in today. But three things prevented me: 1) cramps, 2) heat, and 3) the Tweet TWEET bird. I’m ready to go out there and get that thing with a shotgun. I’m certain there have been several Looney Tunes about that very scenario.  I have to work again today. On Saturday!  The proposal is nowhere near done. Warren is going to email me a section this morning, and then I can start printing and assembling. The copier/printer was giving me trouble yesterday, so I may have problems printing that many copies. Hello, Kinkos!  2399 calories yesterday, on my High day. Typical for me. I notice I don’t really eat more food on a High day, I just eat higher-calorie food.  Remember how this was supposed to be the Exercise Week? Nope. I was great Monday. I was great Tuesday. Wednesday nothing. Also Thursday and Friday nothing.  I think I can expect today will be nothing. I am NOT happy about that.

       6:21 a.m. Friday, Day 130.  Once again, I could sleep for another couple hours. But a bird woke me up. This bird does not have a musical little chirp. It says “Tweet TWEET. Tweet TWEET, DAMMIT,” every couple seconds.   We are a little behind on the proposal production, and I would very much like to get out of The Orifice by COB today, so it will be helpful if I’m in early. Daisy is coming over for dinner, and although I  could  postpone that, I’d rather not, because we have a hard time getting together these days. What with her working daily and all.  So that’s what I’ll be doing today, a bunch of work. Which leads to another boring post. I’m impressed that my food intake has been good during this project. 1411 calories yesterday, 1548 the day before that. Look out, Measurement Shorts!

       6:18 a.m. Thursday, Day 129.  I could sleep for another three hours, at least. The circles under my eyes have bags. I had some sort of recurring task-oriented dream last night (gee, big surprise after working on the proposal for ten hours straight) and so it was very unrestful. For some reason my brother Jimmy and I had walked (?) to Florence, South Carolina, and were having a difficult time finding our way back out. We kept being distracted by various entertainments and attractions, of which I wasn’t aware Florence had any.  I’m up early and already eaten my soup so that I can glide for half an hour before work. I did NO exercise yesterday, and that is not okay. So I’m feeling very brave and martyred. I’m thinking, How cool am I, that I can get up at 6 a.m. to exercise for 30 minutes in the comfort of my home, before I drive to my well-paid desk job where I will sit on my ass for 10 hours?  That’s the funny thing about “white collar” jobs: you’re supposed to feel humble and thankful that you don’t have to physically labor for a living. You’re supposed to feel privileged that you don’t have to dig, or carry, or cause things to move from this place to that. You’re not supposed to complain about the physical inactivity, even though that lifestyle is giving you stress, repetetive-motion disorders and back problems, and slowly killing you.  7:38 a.m. Managed 32 minutes of glider sprints. Yay me. Watched the beginning of “Lost in Translation,” and so far I really like it. There’s a wonderful scene where the girl (name?) wanders into an ikebana class, and she’s so at a loss as to what to do with the flower in her hand. It’s perfect — one must bring thought and reflection to ikebana, and she’s so empty she can’t muster up any idea. Her soul is just flat. I would like to contrast and compare this movie with “Gothika,” which is my vote for Worst Movie I’ve Seen This Year. What the hell was Halle Berry doing in a piece of crap like that? And why was Robert Downey Jr., there? I don’t mean, why is such a fine actor involved, as I did with Berry. I mean, what exactly was the purpose of his role? His character contributed NOTHING. Here are the three rules for writing dialogue: each pieces of dialog must 1) advance the plot, 2) develop the character of the actor, and 3) be interesting in and of itself. Downey did not utter one single line that did any of those things, for the entire movie. All I can figure is, someone owed him a favor and wrote in a part for him at the last minute. Also, the plot: Not believable, not scary, not logical. The cinematography: Oh, it’s all dark and blue. Oooh, how innovative. The writing: You know, it could have been really interesting to see the Berry character, a psychologist herself, doubting her own sanity. There were many fine moments of subtlety and nuance possible. However, they never materialized.  Now I am off to work for another 10-hour day. Yay, giant paycheck!

Must be the martinis. 1864 calories yesterday, which is fabulous for a large drinking day.   8:43 p.m. Spent ALL day at work. Ten hours. I am SO glad to be home. Tomorrow, a repeat of the same.  Just keep thinking "big paycheck."

       6:15 a.m. Tuesday, Day 127.  Slept like HELL last night, once again highlighting the lack of predictability in the universe. Achieved an excellent 1331 calories yesterday, largely due to making stuffed green peppers for dinner. Vegetables rule; you can eat SO much for so few calories. I’m lucky I have the time to shop and cook.  In fact, I don’t think I could have come this far (35 pounds) if I had been working my normal full-time job. I sort of don’t like to admit that, because I don’t want to let myself off the hook if/when I work again, I don’t want it to become an excuse for not continuing to eat well and exercise. But I can’t deny that when the going gets tough at work, there’s no time for shopping and cooking. I’m just not going to grocery shop at 9 p.m., come home and unpack groceries, get in an hour of exercise, and up early the next morning to prepare stuffed green peppers. It’s not going to happen. So I’ve been formulating a plan in advance for how to deal with it, if/when. It involves a lot of frozen vegetables, and shopping on Sunday morning when the Believers are at church and I have the grocery store to myself. Preparing meals Sunday afternoon to put in the freezer for the week ahead. Gah. Well, I guess I’ll do what I have to do, but that doesn’t mean I’ll like it. Also, with the current economy, this is speculation of the most flagrant sort. Anyway, without meaning to WHINE about it, I want to point out that it's very difficult to lose weight/be healthy in the current average lifestyle.  I’m planning on doing the Cindy Crawford workout video this morning. It’s KILLER. I’ll probably do the 10-minute version, plus gliding, because I can’t handle the 30 minute workouts. She got a lot of press about this video many years ago when it was released, partly because of its visual style and Cindy’s ass, and partly because the movements are too fast and potentially harmful. The second part is not an issue to me, because Oh believe me, I cannot do those moves fast. I do a slow-motion version of what Cindy does. I like the video, though. It’s an entirely different style from most workout tapes. First of all, she's got this weird little Romanian guy cruising around, who turns out to be some sort of famous fitness expert, but I didn't know that, and he sort of wafts around her muttering instructions in heavily accented Dracula-style English, like "Now ve go de udder vay." Secondly, the moves are not complicated. You don’t have to pause and rewind to figure out what she’s doing. It’s like, lift your left foot. Put it down. Now lift your right foot. I can handle that. Thirdest, it’s not aerobics, or what used to be called aerobics. It’s more like... calisthenics. A type of exercise that’s gone out of favor since the advent of leg warmers in the 1970s. I like it, you get cardiovascular work AND stretching AND muscle-building. Fourthwhile, it has great music and great sets. It's not all  perky  like those Firm videos. Because the moves aren’t complicated, you don’t need to watch her every second. You can just listen to the music, and they change sets enough to make it interesting. The only thing I don’t like is that during one of the gritty, urban rooftop scenes, they bring down the music in order to let you hear a siren in the distance. I mean, big deal, Little Mister Video Producer. So it’s a siren. I’ve heard one before. This does not in any way increase the usefulness of the exercise or make it more appealing.  12:05 p.m. Planted five bushes - two large, three small. They look great. I didn’t realize how overgrown and sloppy our front entrance looked until I cat-sitted for the neighbor last week, and they had redone their landscaping. Yes, I’m trying to keep up with the Joneses. It’s been a good exercise day for me so far: 10 minutes Cindy, 30 minutes glider, five bush plantings. And now I’m going to go buy some paver bricks, which will involve loading and unloading into my car. And I’ll do butt clenches while I’m driving, so I look like Cindy. Oh yeah.

       6:24 a.m. Monday, Day 126. I managed to come in at one pound lost, theoretically, last week. It was a struggle. I haven’t checked the calendar, but I think it’s a safe bet that hormonally I’m in the Hunger Week. Just can’t seem to eat enough. This week I will focus on exercise; I was very slack about that last week. I’m off to an encouraging start; I ate breakfast early, instead of surfing and writing for a couple hours, so that I can work out early, because I probably have to go to The Orifice today. And as I know from experience, there’s no way I will exercise  after  work. Just won’t happen.  The other day I had the television on, but not really paying attention to it, and I heard a snippet from a news story about new visa and/or passport security measures. What I heard is that there will now be “rectal scans.”  Eww. Can you imagine what the glass on the scanner will look like in just a few days?  Of course, in a few moments I realized they had actually said “retinal scans.” I suppose that makes more sense.  No discernable progress with the Measurement Shorts today. I can button and zip them, but they’re way too tight to wear. Same place as last week. One of my rewards, and in fact the only food-related reward, is that when I fit in the mShorts (a size 20) I want to have dinner at Capper’s, a restaurant we frequent for martinis and music, but where we cannot afford to eat. Last week we got a coupon in the mail for buy-one-entree-get-the-other-free. Unheard of, they never offer coupons. It expires May 31. That’s some sort of sign, right? So that’s my goal, peeps. I want to fit into those shorts by May 31. Can I do it?  It’s dark and rainy this morning. It was dark and rainy yesterday. And the day before. Considering the drought of recent years, I suppose I shouldn’t complain too much, but it’s getting me down. This is how I know I couldn’t live in a place like Seattle. I’m almost glad I’m going to work today, because if I didn’t I would mope around at home, not accomplish anything, eat too much, and feel guilty and sad. Work is such a FAR worse environment that the contrast will make me  appreciate  being depressed and alone.  8:49 a.m. Just did 30 minutes gliding. Harder than I expected, largely because I am so bored. I don’t have any good movies to watch, so I’m reduced to The Shaggy Dog (the original), which I loved as a child but which has lost its ability to hold my attention. Taking a little break, then I’ll try again at 9:00. It’s possible there will be something watchable on Dr. Phil. Glad I’ve got the 30 minutes done, though. No matter what else happens the rest of the day, I’ve accomplished something. I must grocery shop today, so I will also pick up some movies. This is my Exercise Week!  I’ve been thinking a lot lately about my emotional state, my past, whatever neuroses and psychoses I’ve picked up along the way. Partly because of  urlLink Erin’s  impending book, partly because of  urlLink this woman,  who is very bravely writing about things that so many of us have experienced but don’t have the courage or determination to bring to the light of day. She ROCKS.  Weirdly, I’ve never believed that fatness is caused by emotional issues. Or rather, that it’s not  necessarily  caused by emotional issues. You can call me Cleopatra if you want (Queen of de Nile), but I think it’s quite possible, and likely, that any given person is fat because of a combination of genetic disposition and poor behavioral training toward food. Not necessarily because of deep-seated mental problems, emotional neediness, poor self-esteem, childhood trauma, or whatnot. However, I think those things come into play when you’re trying to  lose  weight.  Losing weight is hard. Really hard. As we all know so well. Accomplishing an intensely difficult, long-term, sheer-gritting-the-teeth-with-determination goal is going to expose all your little mental foibles. Whether you’re losing weight, quitting drinking, getting a college degree, leaving an abusive spouse, climbing down a mountain with a broken leg, or any other large, life-changing event, you will end up examining and challenging your weaknesses and fears. You will spend A LOT of time inside your head.  It’s so punishing to be fat in this society, especially as a female, that it’s hard to determine which came first, the fatness or the self-esteem issues. It’s a chicken-and-egg puzzle that’s not really solvable. But I think it’s important that we stop thinking of ourselves as being fat because we have emotional problems.  Everyone  has emotional problems. Skinny people binge on junk food when they’re stressed just the same as fat people. The way that junk food affects your particular body, as opposed to the way it affects theirs, is not the measure of your mental health. It’s the measure of your body’s unique metabolism.  I don’t mean we should stop examining and solving our problems. I just mean that the fact that we can even attempt something as difficult as losing a significant amount of weight points to STRONG mental health, not weak.   12:18 p.m. Just got back from the store. I bought a large quantity of vegetables and fruit, and very cleverly did NOT buy any alcohol. If I don’t have it, I can’t drink it. This, I think, is the only thing that redeems me from being a card-carrying alcoholic: I am too lazy to drive the 4 miles to the nearest store to buy liquor. Or wine, actually. The nearest liquor store is 11 miles away. That’s the South for you. I also rented three movies — Gothika, Lost in Translation, and Secondhand Lions. I will state right now that I’m not expecting much from Gothika. I just want it to be scary and entertaining enough to watch the whole way through. The other two I’m keeping an open mind about. Lost in Translation was raved by the critics, hated by the public. I don’t know what anyone said about Secondhand Lions, but when I saw the preview several months ago I thought it had possibilities. If nothing else, I want to see Michael Caine and Robert DeNiro together. They are both capable of brilliant or lackluster going-through-the-motions performances. Which will it be? Apparently I am NOT going to The Orifice today, but am no longer worried about having a bad day. I ended up doing 60 minutes on the glider and have all sorts of projects I want to do, so I’m feeling optimistic and not depressed. Even though it’s still dark and rainy.

       9:15 a.m. Sunday, Day 125. Last night I had five drinks, 4 pieces of toast with artichoke-spinach-crab dip, and a whopping piece of chocolate cake at 11:00 p.m. By all rights, I should feel miserable this morning. Instead, I slept all the way through, didn’t wake up once, had mild dreams, and feel great today. It’s bad enough that there is no justice in the universe; it’s intolerable that there is no consistency.  Naturally all of this came with a whoppin’ big caloric load. I figure 2452. Yikes. Not freaking out, though, because I have just over 2000 calories left for today and still come in at oppw.  I think I can manage that.   Painted the seat of that windsor chair with a pink seashell yesterday. Looks good. Not sure how I’m going to finish it. I want it semi-whimsical, but since the shell is a fairly realistic style, I can’t go TOO whimsical and yet maintain some consistency. Which we all know is my ground rule for the universe.

       7:25 a.m. Saturday, Day 124. May Day!  At the grocery store I go to, there’s a hanging sign over the counter where they have all the cheese. It says “Cheeses of the World.”  I swear someday I am going in with a Sharpie and write “unite!” on the end of that.  Still feeling pretty crappy. Slept okay until 3:00, and then was restless the remainder of the night. Too-intense dreams, something about werewolves in the snow, something about a world where we all lived on boats, something about cats. Whatever, I tossed and turned, and probably got 5 hours sleep total. Question: What is moronic? Answer: Eating a quiznoids sandwich when you’re already suffering from MSG poisoning.  Ate a lot yesterday, I will have to try to compensate today. Friday is my high day, but it always scares me when I see the big number. I think: there’s still two days left in the week, I could still blow it! At this point I have 4540 calories left for the two days, to remain under goal, which should be PLENTY, but it still makes me nervous. Also, I got NO exercise yesterday, for which I am ashamed. I’ve been really uninterested in exercise lately, but because I’ve been doing so much yardwork, I’ve figured that’s a fair trade off. No really, I don’t think I’m lying to myself on this one. Digging up and pulling out stumps is definitely as much work as gliding for 30 minutes. It’s not the cute kind of gardening where you have a little trowel and a flower-printed knee pad to kneel on. This is the kind where you wear boots and carry around big rocks to act as a fulcrum, and sweat so much you become blinded at a critical moment, and end up with a giant bruise on your leg. Not that I’m complaining, I’m actually bragging.  Today I’m finishing painting all the trim in the dining room and living room. Then there’s just two rooms left downstairs to deal with. The office and the utility room. Will it never end? Yes. It will.

       7:22 a.m. Friday, Day 123. 1-2-3. My god I feel awful. Drank too much, didn’t sleep well. My eyes are tiny, beady little slits this morning. And this is the day I go to The Orifice. Oh well, might as well feel gross there instead of at home.  Also I think I am still experiencing the tail end of the MSG, because in fact I didn’t drink  that  much. Not enough to account for feeling so crappy.  Well, good morning to you too, Little Miss Grumpy!   A reasonable “high” day yesterday — 1688.  I ate lightly all day and then brought chicken caesar salads, homemade potato salad, and Skinny Cow ice cream sandwiches to Daisy’s. Of which I ate one, and left the package at her house. I did NOT take the opportunity to weigh myself while there.  I think I am just now starting to lose again, as evidenced by the mShorts, but I’m afraid of what the scale might say. So I resisted the temptation because I didn’t want to get smacked with the discouragement stick. Next time. Maybe.  Progress Point: Some good news along that line: even though I’m not into the Measurement Shorts yet, I am now wearing the smaller size (22) jeans I bought way back when (February 24), for when the size 24s became too big. The 24s are now officially too big. These are the jeans that I think run small, so that the 22 is really  almost  a 20. So it’s good, I think I’m probably a 21.5 right now, if such a size existed.  4:30 p.m. Good news / bad news: we’ve gotten a one week extension on the proposal. G: I don’t have to work this weekend. B: I won’t have the giant paycheck.  It means I’ll be working next week, which is good, but I had some plans I will have to postpone. Marella and I were going to Habitat for Humanity, to see what kinds of furniture I could pick up to paint, and she was going to carry them back to my house in her truck.  In other bad news, I still feel awful. I’m totally blaming the MSG at this point, because I have HUGE black circles under my eyes, a sure sign. And I’m exhausted, and my muscles ache. I tried to have a little nap on the sofa, but couldn’t quite doze off. Early to bed tonight. Bucko is bringing home Quiznoids, and I am going to eat too much.

       7:03 a.m. Wednesday, Day 183. Whoa, what's going on here? Another good night's sleep? I don't know what to think of this. Really I don't. 1437 calories yesterday, very nice.  Here's my plan for today: 1. Exercise 2. Look for job 3. Put the pine straw under the deck 4. Kill weeds with POISON, aha ha ha ha ha!  That's all I've got. I know it's not enough, will try to be more productive.  Here's something interesting. I cannot STAND to look at George W. Bush.  When he's on the news or delivering an address, I might listen, but not look. Because I can't STAND to look at him. I don't like hearing him either, that's nearly as bad, but somehow if I look at him I become enraged, filled with bitter disgust and horror. And you know what? I've heard LOTS OF PEOPLE say the same thing! That they can't look at him!  Concidence?  5:15 p.m. Accomplished items 1, 2, and 3. Somehow I didn't get around to Item 4. Well, not "somehow," I didn't get around to it because I just now finished writing and faxing a cover letter for a job. It's at a design studio, which is not my background (I'm corporate and scientific), so it was very hard to write. How to make myself sound like a catch? Also, needed to spiff up the look of my resume, I can't send a plain-text version to a design firm. So THAT took a while. The whole thing made me feel squirrely, I ended up spending 5 hours on the computer today and that sucks, plus I felt very pessimistic about getting this job, or ANY job. Listened to another meditation tape for 20 minutes, and I feel MUCH refreshed. I must try to keep that up.  Having a good eating/exercising day. 45 minutes of the Cardio Blast workout — maybe someday I'll get to an hour! Currently at 573 calories, right before dinner. Since it's a non-drinking night, I should do all right. I feel like if I get through this week with good numbers, then I'll be officially back on track.

       7:00 a.m. Tuesday, Day 29.  Another decent night's sleep, woke up a couple times but only for a few minutes. I did start to worry about money, but I had my meditation tape ready in the little boombox, so I played that very softly and fell back asleep. MUCH better than turning on the TV; that will only keep me awake longer. I really like these tapes (actually I have CDs), and would highly recommend them to anyone. They're from  urlLink Health Journeys.   All the tapes I have are narrated by Belleruth herself, so I can't speak for any of the other types on the site. She originally started making the tapes at home for her patients — it's an interesting story, you can go read it yourself. Anyway, there are tapes for both physical and mental concerns, something for everybody.  Here are my plans for today: 1. Exercise 2. Call E. Garden and see if they want to put some of my furniture in the store. 3. Finish Photoshop tutorial (so close!) 4. Find a damned job! 5. Sugar my legs. Again.  1:42 p.m. Having a decent day so far, got a lot done and eating well. Item 1: 45 minutes on the glider. Item 2: Called and am waiting for return call. 3. Tutorial became so stupid and incomprehensible I am finishing with the built-in help in Photoshop itself. 4. Applied to two jobs. 5. Semi successful. It went better than last time, but still not ideal. I suspect it is too hot and humid to get good results.  4:48 p.m. Talked to the E.Garden woman, and am sending her photos of my furniture. She has looked at them before, and my prices were too high, but now I am desperate enough to come down. So we'll see... I really do want to sell them, but I'm not willing to sell them for less than what it cost me to do them, which includes a reasonable fee for my time. If I'm going to give them away, I will give them to friends, which I will do if no sales result within, let's say 6 months. Then I sat down for 20 minutes and did a little relaxation meditation. I'm trying really hard to battle the stress, because it's messing up my dieting. I can't clamp down any harder on my eating, that's counterproductive. I need to eliminate the stress that's making me want to eat. I think I'm getting a handle on it. It occured to me while meditating that my worrying about getting a job will not make it happen. So long as I make my best efforts to get one, sending out resumes and calling people and whatnot, that's all I need to do. Worrying about it is not going to affect my chances in any positive way — I'm going to either get the job or not. DUH!

       6:55 a.m. Monday, Day 182. So far, so good. Had relatively undisturbed sleep last night, so I have an edge on the day.  An acceptable though not stellar week last week. According to my chart, I should have lost 1 pound.  I'm not confident that's true; it doesn't FEEL like I lost weight. I mean, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference of one pound, but it feels like I ate too much and exercised too little to lose weight. I don't know what to think of this — how useful are subjective opinions like that? I have to say, probably not very.  Yet it's still nagging at my mind; maybe my brain is smart enough to know that weight loss is not occuring, and is trying to signal me somehow by planting these "thoughts" and "feelings" in my mind. Hmm, yes.  Since I don't weigh myself, I can't check the scale every week to see what's working and what's not. Anyway, I don't think weighing oneself is a good way to measure; body weight fluctuates too much from day-to-day for it to be a good indicator except over long periods of time.  I do know I am no closer to fitting in the Measurement Shorts. Here it is almost July, and I haven't made any progress with them since mid-May. Therefore, it's obvious that something isn't working. Heh, that  something  is me. I hate to admit it (boy do I hate to admit it) but I have been slacking on tracking the calories. I used to overestimate, and I think recently I've been going the other way, trying to present the best-case. Which, obviously, is not fooling anyone.  For quite a while now, I've been having a hard time keeping portions small, and to some extent the type of food I'm eating. I'm pretty sure it's caused by the stress. I don't obsess about food until I can't have it — that's a problem I've faced every time I've tried to diet. It just creates a PANIC in me.  It's an unfounded panic, because on this diet I'm eating plenty of food and eating frequently. I need to re-read the beginning of my journal, and try to figure out how I managed it then. It occurs to me I'm looking in the wrong direction now; I'm concentrating on food issue, and what I really need is to focus on the stress.  If I relieve the stress, the food problem will disappear along with it; if I focus on the food I'll just become more stressed and both problems will get worse.  Okay, well, glad I solved that little problem (dusts hands off briskly). If anyone has ideas for how to cope with this food panic, let me know.  I want to stop treading water and start losing again!  LATER. I read through the beginning of my journal, and picked out some key concepts I learned along the way. I've let these ideas slip away recently, so I need to go back to school!  - Make sure there is plenty of delicious healthy food in the house. It's when the cupboard is bare that I get squirrelly and want to eat everything in sight.  - Practice "mindful eating," i.e., decide how much I will eat before I sit down to eat it.  - Make exercise a priority. Make it the most important thing I do today — put it ahead of showering, brushing my teeth, or working.  - Take it a week at a time. How much can I accomplish  this  week?  - Drink a lot of water. Oh, a lot. A lot.  - Institute some sort of accountability. For me, that is writing in my journal. Talking it out. I used to write in here every two hours; now I'm doing it once a day, and I rarely write about weight. I need to go back to every two hours.  Today's spam: Honorable O. Rosana, Ethiopia L. Couriers.  10:06 a.m. Found a great workout program on Fit TV. I think it's called "Cardio Blast." It seems like The Firm, with weights and a high step. Like half cardio, half strength. I thought it was a 30 minute program, and so when 28 minutes were up and we hadn't done cool-down, I finally became suspicious. Yep, it's a 60-minute show. Couldn't quite make it, but I did 45 minutes. Not bad.  It was a good hard workout, and none of the complicated dance moves that make me hate aerobics. The instructor wasn't annoying, and she showed signs of fatigue now and then, which is weirdly encouraging. So I give it a thumbs up, and will try to do it again.   Here's my plan for today: 1. Exercise (done) 2. Grocery shop 3. Hardware store - miscellaneous items 4. Bank (deposit two tiny checks) 5. Lunch 6. Return calls to the recruiters and Warren 7. Finish Photoshop tutorial  5:31 p.m. Accomplished everything except Item 7. I spent almost 2 hours on it today, but I have one more chapter to go, Advanced ImageReady. It's been a good day — I feel more energetic and rededicated to My Noble Cause. Had an understanding email from a fellow blogger about my hostile rant yesterday - thanks, I appreciate that!  I have a little more to say on the subject, will pick it up again later. In other positive news, I haven't been starving all day, so hopefully that's over.  I had a Healthy Choice meal for lunch, and I can't really say anything good about it. I rarely buy the pre-packaged meals, but I just didn't have the energy to deal with preparing food myself. It was too salty, and the little dessert was too sweet, sickeningly sugary sweet. So probably won't be going that route again.  No news yet from the recruiters, I'm still in the running for two temp jobs and one permanent job. Warren says the proposal was a false alarm, it's going to be done at our corporate headquarters. I'm sort of relieved, but on the other hand I really need the money, if none of these jobs come through. Wait and worry, wait and worry...

       6:57 a.m. Sunday, Day 181.  I feel... okay.  I think I managed 6 hours of sleep, which is refreshing. However, I was massively oversalted yesterday, and I can definitely feel the effects. Possibly even MSGed, because my entire back is sore, as are my shoulders and arms. That's one way it affects me, some sort of muscle inflammation.  For the past three or four days, I've felt like I simply cannot eat enough. I am hungry CONSTANTLY. I put food in my mouth, and ten minutes later I'm hungry again. So it's been a real struggle this week. Yesterday, after eating two eggs for breakfast (unusual for me), I immediately ate a large salad and half an ounce of cheese. Then a carrot. And I was STILL hungry.  I decided to just have a big-ass meal and get it over with. Like maybe I just needed to "get it out of my system." We went to Eastern Buffet, a very inexpensive restaurant frequented by Mexican painting contractors that prepares Chinese food in Southern form. Let no one tell you that we here in the South are not multicultural and cosmopolitan! The spices are more redneck than Asian, so perhaps that could qualify it as some sort of trendy fusion cuisine. I started off with a large pile of green beans and zucchini. Probably three cups. Went back for three pieces of "sushi" (no actual fish involved), 2 tablespoons of Pepper Chicken (tastes exactly like KFC), a slice of beef on a skewer, and a spring roll (didn't eat; one bite and all I could taste was old cooking oil. Yuck!). On the third trip, got a pile of watermelon, a couple little slices of honeydew melon, and a 1-inch-square "German chocolate cake."  Now, how good do you think a German chocolate cake in a Chinese restaurant that cooks redneck style and caters to contractors would be? Yes, exactly. However, I ate it anyway.  I think it worked, as far as getting it out of my system, because I ate lightly for dinner and don't feel so crave-ish today.  It wasn't a terrible meal, nutrition-wise or calorie-wise, the main drawback was the very large amount of salt. But since I had it for lunch instead of dinner, I had more hours remaining in the day to drink BUCKETS of water and sort of flush myself out. So I'm not feeling wretched this morning, but not fabulous either.  I've got to be PMSing, but I'm too lazy to go upstairs and check my calendar. Let's just assume I am. For one thing, I was so terribly depressed Friday (remember how depressed I was?) and for another, last night I was watching the Trading Spaces outtakes show, and Amy Wynn fell down skateboarding and skinned her elbow, and I CRIED.   That doesn't sound like PMS to you, does it? Naaah.  Today's spam is from Outranking H. Ravined and Bookkeeper Wang.  I would now like to write about something that is probably obvious to everyone except me, but I just realized it this morning. My idea is, that if something happens to hurt you, and you do not have the tools to cope with it, that hurt doesn't go away. It isn't resolved or lessened or shed. When you get to a level of sophistication or competence where you can take that kind of hurt in stride, it has no bearing on the previous hurt, it doesn't miraculously cure it. Emotional hurts require  immediate  treatment, and if no help is available, it doesn't heal. Putting a bandage on it ten years later is not a solution. (Warning: cursing and an incredible amount of paranoid hostility toward faceless strangers follows.)  Here's what I mean: I was watching a biography about Marianne Faithful this morning, and one of her school chums said words to the effect of "Marianne was an innocent and good kid, but she was never successful at being good, because her looks made people believe she was a bad girl and that's how they treated her."  The idea being that she was forced into the role that others wanted for her. And I really recognized part of my own formative years in that description, because absolutely I was forced into a role (but not Fat Girl this time, surprise!). When I was 12, I suddenly grew breasts. Within the space of less than one school year, I went from little-girl-flat to a full C cup. Added to this, I was "chubby," as it was called them, which began to manifest itself in my hips and bust. So I was an extremely curvy girl with big tits and long blonde hair, and rather pretty also. Oh, I will stop being modest: at 12 years old I was a knockout. And it was HORRIBLE. Because, contrary to popular belief and a very misguided South Park episode, having large breasts is not a pleasant experience. People do NOT treat you better because of them, they treat you disrespectfully and cruelly. Somehow they think you grew these things on purpose, that you have complete control over the situation, but oh my god you're so stupid and such a bimbo you didn't even know when to quit!  Especially if your peers are hormone-raging boys and that-bitchy-phase girls, you will receive harassment and humiliation, not admiration or preferential treatment. You understand, I'm not saying that large breasts SHOULD get you those things, but that it's a misconception they do. What they really get you is scorn, ugly jokes, and a whole lot of highly embarrassing and inappropriate commentary from simply everyone, including friends, hairdressers, sales clerks, teachers, neighbors, doctors, and of course total strangers.  That was one of the most hurtful aspects to me — adults suddenly started treating me like a whore, especially my friends' mothers. At 13, I was nerdy, had never dated a boy, never been kissed, and still occasionally played with dolls. Yet adult women were reacting to me as though I was a crack-smoking prostitute, trying to snatch their girl children away from my evil influence and prevent me from knocking their husbands down and having my way with them. Grown men made some very inappropriate, illegal, and explicit moves on me. Guys yelled at me in public all the time, and they didn't yell things like "You're really pretty and I think you're nice and I would like to take you to a movie or something." They yelled things like "Hey Tits! Hey, can I fuck your tits?" And like I said, it started when I was TWELVE. (I have puh-lentee more examples, but that's enough to get the point across). I wasn't even entirely sure what the sex act consisted of, at that age, and men were yelling explicit sexual comments to me, in front of other people, which made it even more horrific. Because then all THOSE people stared at me. Jesus. And the gross gross gross thing is, part of me wanted the attention. ANY attention. Parents, this is what all the psychologists and Dr. Phil and everyone is talking about when they tell you to raise your kids with self-esteem and the belief that they are loved. Because a kid who feels her parents HAVE HER BACK is not vulnerable to looking for attention, love, and validation from some creepy guy who wants to fuck a 13-year-old.*  Right, so I DID have a point in this story. My point is, I understand what Marianne Faithful's friend was saying, because I went through a similar situation. Too many people insisted on treating me like a slut, based simply on outward appearance. Too many people in my life wouldn't allow me any other role, and not enough people cared to support my being any other way. And duh, of course that's how I began to behave. And THAT is my point about hurts like that not going away. Sure, NOW I could cope with that. NOW if some guy yelled at me I would have a few things to yell back, and it would not keep me up nights worrying and it wouldn't sink into my psyche and horrify me for the rest of my life. But that's NOW. I didn't have those tools then, and I can't retroactively apply my current emotional strength (such as it is) to the past. So how does one get rid of that stuff?  Because it's still there.   *I know a lot of people become indignant and self-righteous when others complain about their childhood and assign blame to their parents. So, since I'm using the F word rather freely today and PMSing to boot, I'll say this: Fuck You. I will complain and blame as I see fit, and if you have a problem with that, I see one of two possibilities: 1. You did not have a dysfunctional, literally insane, child-abusing parent and therefore have NO idea what you're talking about, absolutely no credibility to act self-righteous, so sit down and shut up; or 2. You DID have the childhood from hell but believe you have now "fixed yourself," and selfishly have no patience with others who aren't as far along the road as your wonderful self, in which case, sit down and shut up. And this ends my hostility for the day. Presumably.

       7:24 a.m. Saturday, Day 180. Feeling so-so.  I slept until 5:00, but that was all I could manage. Now I'm burny-eyed and loveless. A reasonable day yesterday, food and exercise-wise. Not quite what I wanted, in order to compensate for Thursday, but not bad. I was fairly exhausted all day from the martini-fest and the anxiety of dealing with THREE different recruiters for THREE different jobs. One of them is a permanent technical writer position that I DO NOT WANT, but feel compelled to take (if offered) because we need some $$, but fast. And THEN, in mid-afternoon Warren from The Orifice emails me with a heads-up about a big proposal due end of July, with hours for me. Good lord, what next?  Which way should I jump? I've been on the phone and email for four or five hours a day for the past week, and it's wearing me down. Yeah, I know, it doesn't sound like any big deal, having employment possibilities I desperately need, and you're wondering what my problem is that I'm whining about it. It's because, in case I haven't made clear before, I am a highly introverted weaselly-type person, and too much time spent with other people really does exhaust me. This week was full of barbed-wire contacts — the recruiters, phone interviews, going to The Orifice and running shrieking away, etc. These are not pleasant, no-pressure interactions with kindly friends, these are situations that are, for me, full of sharp edges and splinters.  So anyway, what was my point? Oh yeah, yesterday I did 30 minutes on the glider, and it was a HUGE struggle to make myself do it, so I'm giving myself several bonus points. AND I did it at 3:00 p.m., which deserves triple points, because first thing in the morning is my exercise time, and no other. So this week's Focus On Exercise is an offical success. Yay me.  Here are some wonderful people who have sent me spam recently: Euphemism J. Inflammation, Embalmed Q. Refracting, and Moderators K. Pencil. Love it.

       7:24 a.m. Friday, Day 179. Holy cow, them martinis add up!  Let's just say that in binary, my calories yesterday were 00110010 00110011 00111000 00110001! Much compensation today, in the form of salad and water.  I feel surprisingly good for someone who drank so much and had restless sleep (o the dreams). I saw something on the news the other day about teenagers who watch too much television having the same type of insomnia I do (waking up in the middle), and that it also makes them irritable and stupid. Or words to that effect. Oh my god, I thought, that's ME! I'm a surly teenager! But why should this phenomenon be limited only to teenagers? Since it was a local news report there was little or no scientific information, so I'm not sure what the exact mechanism is, except they mentioned the bright light from the TV. I couldn't tell if they meant overall TV exposure, or only when falling asleep (that's me), and whether the light from the computer monitor has the same effect (one would assume). They didn't mention content at all, which would also be a factor. Televison programming after 9:00 is nothing but death, autopsies, murder, and other crimes. It's depressing as hell, not a good frame of mind to fall asleep with.

       7:23 a.m. Thursday, Day 178. Not entirely sure how I feel today. I had too many dreams last night and so was restless. It's been awhile since that's happened, and I don't miss it at all. 1557 calories yesterday, and 30 minutes gliding. Not bad, but I could do better. It's been hard getting back into the habit of exercise. That's another thing I haven't missed! I know that I'll feel better when I build up a couple weeks of daily exercise, but right now it just feels like an annoyance.  urlLink Yvonne  is walking around with a pedometer, and finding out she's not as active as she thought. I don't think I'd even bother with it; I'd be surprised if I hit 2000 steps on my busiest day. Hmm, there's a lesson to be learned there. Maybe... maybe... I should MOVE more? Interesting concept. My first reaction is: it's too damned hot. And it is; in this neck of the woods, one does not walk around outside in the summer. Yeah, it's not just an excuse, believe me.  I guess I could walk around the mall with the seniors, and be humiliated that they're all in better shape than I am. That sounds like so much trouble (nearest mall 14 miles away), I think I'd rather just make myself glide more. But, I'm going to put this idea up for consideration and get back to you. We'll do lunch.  6:15 p.m. Oh my, what a gross day. I decided to go to The Orifice, so I could use the PC there to learn Microsoft Project, and secondarily do a web tutorial on Access. THAT didn't go well - the Project help is ABYSMAL and I couldn't find any sort of manual or download reference. Does it even exist? Then it turned out my Access is WAY older than the version on the web tutorial - so outdated I couldn't really use it. THEN I started having connection problems and getting 404s constantly, even after several restarts. While these technical issues were going on, I was also being driven insane by the accountant and somewhat by the receptionist, who are bored out of their minds and eager for someone new to talk to. I was rude to the accountant to the point where hopefully she will never speak to me again, and I don't feel the least bit guilty. It did, however, combine to make an unpleasant and unproductive experience, so I left after about an hour, bought martini fixings, some cheap jewelry at the dollar store, and came home to drink. Aaaah, it was lovely. Tomorrow, of course, the caloric compensation.

       7:54 a.m. Wednesday, Day 177.  Feeling good today. Slept almost all the way through. Had some weird dreams, and when I woke up from that around 2:30, I stayed awake for 20 minutes or so, because I didn't want to go right back to sleep and into the dream. Sort of a nightmare, but more adventure than fright. Yeah, yeah, whatever. An excellent 1475 calories yesterday. Daisy made turkey chili, I brought California rolls, pineapple, and grapes. Moderate drinking and much much talking. Her new job is going well, although she is incredibly busy. They have so many projects they want her to take on. I think they're excited to finally have some one on board who can do these things. Also she gave me a little present for our mutual birthday, which you can see if you click on the Pictures link --> and look in the Various photo album.  I didn't get her  anything.

       6:57 a.m. Tuesday, Day 176.  Good and bad to report today.  Bad first: I whacked my back muscles again, and could hardly sleep last night. This will also affect my ability to exercise today. I will try to do something with little impact. This is  my "refocus on exercise" week, and damned if I'm going to weasel out of it. Also bad: giant zit on my chin. Good news: 1573 calories yesterday, even after gorging on eggrolls. Man, those were good.  Tonight, dinner at Daisy's house. I'm bringing dessert, so I will make sure to get fruit instead of brownies. I am still having a hard time with the portions, and resisting yummy food. But I'm not overeating, in fact I seem to be maintaining my weight perfectly, so apparently I have found the exact right long-term diet for me. Unfortunately, I want to still be in the weight-LOSS phase, not the weight-MAINTAINING phase. I've been in a mind-set where it's really difficult to deprive myself of anything. I know it's the stress, I'm relying too much on food as a reward and comfort. When I have a really crappy day, it just feels like too much additional punishment to deny myself the pleasure of eating.  It's that control thing, again. I remember when I was a kid, and I hated school and my family was insane, and that I regarded my life as unceasing drudgery and horror, so that sometimes dinner was the only good thing that was going to happen to me all day. If dinner sucked, I felt cheated and betrayed. So I have to make sure that the food I prepare is delicious and attractive, which there is no reason it shouldn't be, as well as look beyond food for comfort and distraction. I'm not freaking out about it; I've been reminding myself that I've lost 40 pounds, and that's an achievement even if I never lose another ounce. Which I WILL, this isn't loser talk. No no no.  12:41 p.m. Weirdness. A recruiter I haven't talked to since 2002 just called me about a position. Unfortunately, it seems to be the same one I was submitted for yesterday. She might have another one, though. Managed 30 minutes of walking this morning. Seems to have helped my back, if anything. Yay. I've been job hunting since 8:30 this morning, emailing and talking on the phone, and I'm sick of it. I want to sit outside for 30 minutes to even up the hellaciously weird uneven suntan/burn I got at the beach. Four days of sun exposure, each with a different style top. I look like someone played tic tac toe on my back. It's awfully cloudy, though. I don't know what the UV index is today.

       7:26 a.m. Monday, Day 175.  I am still full from last night. We ended up going to a Mexican restaurant with Marella and Jaeger and their son, for Father's Day, and I blew my remaining calories there. It's okay, I ended up  just  under my oppw calories. Which is nice, because out of the past 5 weeks, I've scored "0 pounds lost" 4 times.  This week, my mini-goal is to refocus on exercise. I let it go when I was doing so much work on the house, but now I'm not, so I must exercise regularly in the morning again. We're in a tough time of our lives right now, and I need to feel as good as possible to get through it. I expect the next couple months to be highly stressful as we run out of  money, try to sell the house, buy a new house, get a mortgage, and try to find a job. Yeah, actually, I don't even want to think about it. It's too early.  In other news, yesterday we found a "normal" neighborhood that we both liked. We're so into (especially me) the "loft" concept that regular houses are not even appealing. But this was a really cool neighborhood, with older houses, heavily wooded, large lots, but right in town. The kind of neighborhood that used to be out in the boonies ten years ago, but town grew up around it. Perfect. We picked up one flyer (there weren't many houses for sale, a good sign), and it was just slightly above what I would consider our top range. But it was a somewhat large house, giving me hope that we could afford something smaller in the area.  Here are the things I would like to accomplish today: 1. exercise 2. sugar my legs 3. find job  12:38 p.m. Item 1 accomplished. Making efforts in Item 3, i.e., I've sent my resume to a couple consulting places, and someone has passed my name on to a recruiter who is looking to fill a state position. We've already emailed and talked on the phone briefly. The contract is 160 hours, which is perfect, because it would be a good paycheck but not a long-term commitment. I don't think my chances of getting it are high, however. It's work I can do, but not work I specialize in, so there may be better candidates. Also, I had to turn in my resume before I saw the position description, so I didn't tailor it for this specific job. We'll see.  She's also interested in me as a freelancer to do some design work for her company. And now I am going to turn my attention to Item 2. Yeeowch!  2:20 p.m. Had to give up on #2. I don't know why, but it's not working. It's every bit as painful and irritating as if I were ripping out my hairs by the roots, but no actual hairs are leaving my body. I don't get it — it's the same formula I always use, my skin is clean and dry, etc. Maybe too humid today? Anyway, I'm giving it up because I'm getting all the pain and no gain. Having a hard time settling down to anything today. I ought to get the house put back together, and it seems very slow going. We've got bits and pieces all over, because of tearing up the downstairs, and it's a lot of work to track down the pieces and decide where to put them, or whether they should be packed, and acting accordingly. I'm kind of flitting from room to room and not quite finishing anything. At least I'm eating well today — my half can of soup for breakfast, and for lunch a bowl of bean salad with a banana. I'm having a glass of tomato juice now for a snack. Tonight I plan to make those eggrolls I took to Topsail; Bucko missed out because we'd eaten them before he got there.

       6:59 a.m. Sunday, Day 174.  Feeling okay today, slept pretty well. 1993 calories yesterday. Not great, but not bad for a Saturday. Not sure what I'm doing today. I think Bucko will mow the lawn, and there's still furniture and belongings to be put back or packed.   You know I am not of the psychoanalytic school of thought when it comes to weight loss — I look at it as a physical process, not mental. HOWEVER:  urlLink this girlie  has quite a good description of realizing her psychological hurdles, and I found myself identifying with a good deal of it, particularly the "using it to stay myself" aspect.  I realized a long time ago that I am sometimes quite  resentful  that I should "have to" lose weight.  For good or bad, being fat is my identity, and being told to change that identity, to change my SELF, is infuriating and hurtful.  8:45 a.m. So what is it with me and the fatalism? I'm WAY beyond pessimistic. Bucko pointed out that whenever I talk about moving, I say something like "I'll miss this house because we'll never have such a nice place again." And I've decided that I'll never again have a good-paying job. Or a job that I like. I've somehow decided — and "decide" is the right word — that from now on I'm going to be poor, unhappy, and unfulfilled. Damn. I mean, could I maybe experiment with a mode of thought where I at least  hope  my life will improve? I'm going to try this. The other day, when I went to the trendy store, I was teetering on the verge of being terrified. Because I haven't the slightest bit of confidence or self-esteem, deliberately putting myself into a situation of possible rejection is like holding my hand over a fire. Anyway, I could feel myself getting ready to freeze with fear, and I kind of talked myself out of it. I thought "Okay, we've already tried the panic mode of behavior, many times, and it hasn't worked out well. What if this time, just for an experiment, we try being calm and unafraid?"  I assumed the attitude, I  put it on,  just as I put on my clothes and jewelry. It's part of the outfit.  And it seemed to work pretty well. And I wondered, not for the first time, if for some reason I MAKE myself panic. That somehow I feel it's appropriate, or even that it's  required.  Sometimes I have the tiniest sense that I'm NOT unconfident, I'm not scared, it's that I've somehow internalized the idea that I'm supposed to be, and so that is how I will act/react, even if I have to force myself into it.  You had no idea I'm such a psycho mess, did you? Hee.

       3:49 p.m. Saturday, Day 173.  Trying to get the house put back together today. A lot of work. I've decided to put out whatever furniture I have that's for sale, with a tag — there will be realtors walking through here, and I might as well take advantage of that sitch. We haven't yet engaged a realtor, I guess that's the next step. That, and finding a place to live. Daisy knows a commercial realtor, and we've been trying to arrange to get together with him, just to get a feel for whether it's remotely possible for us to buy some kind of industrial space on our budget. I would say a loft, except that's not literally what I mean. These days, a loft is a tiny expensive apartment with very high ceilings, in what may have been commercial space, but not necessarily. I'm talking old-style loft, as in concrete floors, bare walls, huge amount of space. It doesn't have to be the second story, in fact it would be nice to get a small two-story building. Bottom floor studio, second floor living space.  That's probably in the daydream category, but we won't know unless we try, hence we need to talk to a commercial realtor. In the meantime, I am all freaked out about how we will get a mortgage when I have no income. I'm so afraid of it, I haven't taken any steps to find out where we stand. I've heard different things from people, like if you can put down 20 percent, you won't have a problem getting a loan. I don't know if that's true, and I've really been hiding my head in the sand, or some other warm, dark place. You'd think a person would get to be 43 years old and be more sophisticated, right? Sheesh. However, I'm reaching critical mass with the stress, and I think that's what enabled me to go to the gallery yesterday. Other parts of my life are just so damned scary that making a cold call was easy, in comparison.

       7:21 a.m. Friday, Day 172. Feeling much improved today. My back is not quite back to normal (har! "back" to normal!) but it's much less painful. A stunning 1369 calories yesterday. I think it's mostly because I was trapped upstairs for a large part of the day, with no access to snacks. Hmm. I think I should learn something from that. The computer is back up this morning, so I have transcribed my little scribbles from yesterday. I'm more optimistic about losing weight than I have been in quite some time. Not sure why, maybe just getting a good night's sleep, that does a lot for one's attitude. I'm planning on going to one of the trendy stores here in town to pimp my furniture, and I'm vacillating between terror and confidence. Trying to stay on the confidence side of the line. There's nothing to be afraid of. There's nothing to be afraid of. I think I'll be okay. I decided to do it yesterday, this morning I looked up the address on Yah00 Maps, I vacuumed out the trunk of my car, and put two tables in the back. I've got my portfolio packed, and business cards. Now my greatest hurdle is figuring out what to say. Seriously, that's the most difficult part to me, whether in person or over the phone. I walk up to the counter, I open my mouth and out comes: "****."  What comes out? What are the words?  I got a spam with the subject line of "gorgeous intolerant."  That's so much more intriguing than "V~i_c_o`din 0n1ine today". Did I read it? No. But still...  On another unrelated topic, have you noticed that my random post headlines often make sense? It's accidental. Or perhaps I should say coincidental. Either that or I have begun to write to the headline.  1:44 p.m. Okay, guess who just got back from the trendy little gallery store, without having died or fainted or vomited? Yes, me. It went quite well, except for them not actually buying anything from me. But she seemed quite impressed with my stuff, and I left pictures for her to show her husband (she says he does the buying), and also she does interior design, and of her own accord without any prompting from me, brought up the idea of my doing commission work for her clients. So it was a good contact, and I have already written a thankyou card and put it in the mail, along with some more pictures. Keeping my fingers crossed.  Daisy is off to her parents' this weekend, for Father's Day, which sucks because I have many many stories to tell her about Topsail and That Asshole and the trendy store. Since Bucko and I have no fathers and no children, it's just another day. I feel gipped.

       7:41 a.m. Thursday, Day 171. Oh man this sucks. I pulled a muscle in my back yesterday, moving furniture. I could barely walk down the stairs this morning, clutching the banister and going one step at a time. Ate breakfast right away so I could take aspirin. The downstairs is bare now, for the carpet, excluding the big furniture like the sofa, which the carpeters will deal with. They should be here in an hour. I guess I will spend the day upstairs. There's TV, a bathroom, and all my books, so I won't be bored.  Ate well yesterday, about 1548 calories. I had a big salad for first course of dinner, so I wouldn't overload on pizza — a good strategy. I am glad I'm back in the mindset of making plans like that, instead of eating whatever "happens" to come along. I can't afford that laissez-faire attitude.  9:30 a.m. The carpeters are here and have already started ripping up. I'm watching Seven Years in Tibet. It's pretty good.  [later: had to give up on it; the carpeters are making such a racket removing tack strips that I can't hear anything, and it's not close-captioned.]  3:30 p.m. The carpet looks great. Same color as the old one but softer and of course cleaner. Spent most of the day in the bedroom reading Their Eyes Were Watching God. Fantastic novel, the language is incredible. It's written in dialect, or whatever you call that, so I can't just skim the letters quickly and understand the words, I have to sound it out in my head. So it's slow, and like listening to someone talk. It's such a rich story, lots of ideas to chew on. I am devastated to discover that it was an Oprah book recently. I suppose that doesn't affect my experience with it, but I've noticed that a lot of Oprah books are pointless and vacant. More about that another time.

       7:52 a.m. Wednesday, Day 170. I'm back to my pattern of waking up at 2:00 or 3:00 a.m. At least Comedy Central is running the old What's My Line Anyway shows. 1857 calories yesterday, not so great. Maybe I'll finally become so embarrassed at revealing my half-assed dieting in my blog that it will shame me into doing better. That was my hope, anyway.  It's at this point, where I KNOW what I need to do and am not able to DO it, that I start questioning my motives, my beliefs, whether I am subconsciously sabotaging my weight loss efforts for some sort of unhealthy emotional payoff. Very Dr. Phil, you know?  But here is my answer: bullshit.  I just don't buy into that "hidden emotional cause for obesity" crap. Maybe people are fat because their bodies, due to nature or nurture, deal with energy differently from other people. Now, I'm not talking about someone who consistently eats 6000 calories a day, but that's not me, so it's irrelevant. So duh, of course it's hard to stay on a diet. No one likes depriving themselves of something they enjoy, and enjoying food is not some especially mentally-disturbed activity. It's  normal  to like food.  Anyways, I've said all that before. For some people, it's going to help them in their dieting to psychoanalyze themselves, and if so, more power to them. For me, it helps to drop that baggage entirely — the introspection just derails me from my goal. As they say, analysis brings paralysis. (who said it, anyway?)   9:54 a.m. I got a sort-of response to one of my resumes already. At least, they asked me to send it in Word format and wanted to know my rate. As much as you will pay me, is what my rate is. It's grotesquely humid today. I'm moving more furniture out to the garage. Bucko is going to pack up the computers tonight. He's asked a friend to help, so we'll get pizza and beer and have a gay old time. I might not be posting for a day or two, until they're put back together.  3:19 p.m. Back from Kinkos, a little discouraged about the cost to print a postcard. I'm going to call regular printers now; compared to $1.24 per impression, it might be cheaper. Also trying to get a hold of the Employment Security Commission to find out whether I'd be eligible for unemployment, if The Orifice lays me off. Hard to say, since I'm part-time. The number has been busy for the last 42 minutes. Yeah, great economy. Please please please no more Bush. I don't give a fart in a high wind about Kerry, but please god no more Bush.   More things I am too old to understand,  specifically when young people write in with a problem and receive advice (you all know what site I'm talking about, and I wish to point out that I am  not  criticizing the often excellent advice provided there):  Sample Question: "I went out with this guy, and then we broke up, and then we went to college, and then we got back together, and then we broke up, and then we moved, and then I dated his friend, and now we're together, and blah blah blah blah."  My Answer: "Dude. There are more than two people on this planet. Go date someone else, for Christ's sake."

       7:58 a.m. Tuesday, Day 169.  Slept quite well last night, glad to be back in my own bed, until 5:00 a.m., when I had one squirrelly stress dream after another. But overall I feel rested. I'm back on track with soup for breakfast. I didn't count my food well while I was gone, so I won't try to come up with statistics for last week. A fresh start today. I did eat a lot of fish and shrimp, but unfortunately much of it was fried. I mean, it's Topsail Island, everything is fried, even the beer. I drank a lot of water and although I didn't get exercise every day, when I did get it, it was extreme.  Our booth was at the far end of the boardwalk, and we couldn't get the truck in — the way was completely blocked. So we carried everything from the parking lot to the booth. I'm not sure how far it was, maybe 100 yards. That's a football field, right? So, multiple trips carrying pottery and furniture. Plus the tent, water jugs, folding chairs, banners, cash box and credit card thing, etc. Then on Sunday, we couldn't even get the truck into the parking lot, which was closed, because we wanted to pack up and sneak out a little early. We figured if we waited until 5:00, when ALL the vendors packed up, we'd be there until midnight. So we carried everything back to the truck, only this time it was across the street and down a block, so add half again the distance. When we finally reached Marella's trailer around 5:30, we got right into our swim suits, mixed some drinks, and dragged our exhausted asses a block to the beach. Bucko and I set up our beach chairs right in the water, which was warm and soothing and like a wonderful massage. The sun was low, so no more sunburn, and the water was silver and green and perfect.  Today I'm moving everything out of the first floor so they can do the carpet Thursday. That's my exercise. Also I'm trying to get hooked up with some temp agencies, and my wretched IE is bombing constantly. I need to download a newer version. I'm taking a break from it for now; I'll hit it again this afternoon.  1:44 p.m. Okay. I emailed my resume to four different contracting places. I hope they will be impressed by the resume itself, because I was too brain-dead and uninspired to write a good cover. Me need money. Me work for money. You pay me. I also visited the  urlLink postal service web page,  which I am fond of, to get info on direct mail. I think a 5x7 postcard is the thing. I also made many many trips up and down the stairs, carrying small furniture and stuff, to get the downstairs clear. AND I called my boss, I don't remember what alias I'm using for him, so I'll just call him THAT ASSHOLE, to discuss my options with him, i.e., either I need hours or I have to quit. And he took another call in the middle of that conversation, and has not yet called me back. Like, it was  too much trouble  for him to concentrate on accepting an employee's resignation.  All in all, a productive day, and it's early still.

       7:13 p.m. Monday, Day 168.  I'm baaaaack.    Let's start with the good news first. Happy birthday to me and Daisy today. I am now 43, and she is 33. I ate well and got lots of exercise while I was gone. Marella and I had a beautiful day at the beach Thursday, the weather was lovely and the water warm. I have a tan that's deeper than anything I've had since I was a kid.  The bad news: I made $50 the first day of the show, $5 the second day, $35 the third day. Which is $90 for three days, minus $35 for my half of the booth rental, minus $20 gas, equals $35. Minus what the furniture cost  me  when I bought it, equals $0. Minus three ten-hour days at let's say $10 an hour, equals negative $300. And if I want to follow that line of thought, I can subtract the time and gas for me to bring the stuff back from the store, to clean it, prime it, and then to paint it. If I pay myself $20 an hour for the actual creative painting part, then I'm about $500 in the hole total.  And yet, weirdly, I haven't given up. That place was the wrong venue, but I have not lost faith in my work. I do good work*, it's gorgeous and happy and wonderful and  someone  out there is willing to pay a reasonable fee for it. I just have to find them. Several people were interested in murals rather than furniture, and asked me about it and took my card, so something might come to fruition there. Also I'm thinking I'd better implement a plan I thought of a year ago, to get some postcards printed at Kinkos, and do a mailing to some of the ritzier neighborhoods around here. I can just take an afternoon to drive through and get addresses, and then mail to "resident." That's targeting the right audience.  *Which you can see a few examples of, if you click on the "Pictures" link in the About section -->   In the meantime, I need work  immediately.  We're on the brink of broke. I like that phrase. The brink of broke. So tomorrow: cruise the temp agencies and try to mass mail/call them with my resume. Also something I am considering, but need to think through for possible ramifications: call my boss at my "real job," and tell him I need either ten hours a week, or he has to lay me off so I can get unemployment and access to my 401k. Sadly, I know he doesn't have ten hours a week for me, but I might as well try.

       7:37 a.m. Tuesday, Day 162.  Slept very well last night, until I woke up at 4:00 with horrendous stomach pain and nausea. That kept me awake for an hour, and I'm still not clear of it yet. I strongly suspect it was the slice of pineapple I ate immediately before going to bed — not a wise choice. That stuff needs to be digested in an upright position. I had some scary dreams too, probably caused by the discomfort of the stomach. Something about a giant wolf killing people, and a guy who was supposed to be a wizard of some sort with a talisman to keep the giant wolf away, but we noticed that he ALSO had a talisman to call the wolf to him, which did not bode well. A later dream with Weird Al Yankovich, which was not scary, partly because I have a giant crush on  urlLink Weird Al.   Did you not know that? Most of the men that I find terribly attractive aren't just in the common taste. Some are. See below for a partial list.  1546 calories yesterday, very good. Lots of water. Vegetables. Exercise. Yay me. Today, must go to the bank and get cash for the show. Wash clothes and pack. Remember to bring touch up paint, sunscreen, and bugspray. I just realized I won't be posting again until at least Monday, maybe Tuesday. I will miss you all.  While I am gone, please read all the archives  urlLink here,  because this is the funniest site in the world.

       6:59 a.m. Monday, Day 161.  Last week was a TOTAL bust, and I aim to do better now.  I sucked it up and had my half can of soup for breakfast. 120 calories. Gonna drink lots of water. Probably even exercise.  Marella and I are going to Topsail on Wednesday, two days ahead of the show, for some beach time, and that is the sort of situation that could go either way — I could end up overeating and overdrinking, or I could have my own mini fat camp for five days. I'm going to choose mini fat camp. I'm making spring rolls today, to freeze and take with. Also some quiche. That's not exactly diet food, but not bad either, because I'm not loading it up with cheese or cream. Mostly vegetables and some eggs. Also I'm doing one version with tofu instead of eggs, should be interesting. I've never made a quiche before. It's not hard, right?  10:51 a.m. Just finished 20 minutes of step, and it killed me. Glad I did it, I feel a million percent more optimistic now. Had a little snack of fresh pineapple, which was delicious and reminded me of Tahiti. I would go back in a minute. In fact, I would love to live there for a couple years. In Papeete, that is. I'm not terribly interested in the island beachcombing ideal. Well, of course that's not realistic anyway, you have to be a millionaire to do that, but even if it was possible it doesn't attract me. But Papeete — now there's an interesting town. It would be so cool to get a job that afforded a reasonable standard of living, and spend a year or two.  5:06 p.m. Oh, bad news, bad news.  That temp job is not mine. They are giving it to "another candidate" who is cheaper and also can start work immediately, which I cannot, because of the Topsail show. Shit shit shit.  In a completely unrelated tirade, I would like to say that here is a lovely illustration of one of the things wrong with this country:  Ronald Reagan is lying in state, in the Ronald Reagan Public Library in Simi, California, his coffin covered with an American flag. The general public is allowed to enter the room for viewing. They go past in single file, following the velvet ropes. This is what they are wearing: Shorts. White t-shirts. Flowered capri pants. This is just wrong.   I absolutely hated Reagan when he was in office, but that's irrelevant. You don't go to pay your respects to a deceased president of the United States dressed in leisure clothing. Why? Because it's disrespectful. Disrespectful to the office of the President of the United States, to his widow, to the United States itself, to everyone else who takes it seriously. When you will not bother to dress appropriately for a situation, you're saying that the event is insignificant, that your tiny little ego is more important than the views of the others, that you are not willing to  contribute  to the occasion by presenting a concordant image. The same principle applies when people are underdressed or undermannered for a party or restaurant: they are lessening the experience for the other people. It's selfish — they are taking without giving.  To end on a positive note, I made four quiches, and they look  beautiful.  1. Eggless with tofu, spinach, mushroom, garlic. 2. "Mexican" quiche with jalapeno-flavored tomatoes, chili peppers, cheddar cheese, and sliced bell peppers on top. 3. Multi-vegetable with green peppers, peas, yellow squash, thyme. 4. Zucchini and red peppers with garlic and parmesan cheese. We're having that one tonight, the other three I am freezing and taking to Topsail.

       11:14 a.m. Sunday, Day 160.  I am planning a SLOW relaxed day today.  I need a day off. Bucko, however, has to mow the lawn. No day off for him. Well, okay, I'll probably weed the so-called garden while he's mowing.  I've kind of given up on this week. Not that I'm giving myself license now, but I know it's too late to achieve any kind of victory. I'm right at my calorie limit with the rest of the day to go. Somehow I seem to have forgotten I'm on a diet, recently. At the art museum opening, it never even crossed my mind to monitor, and definitely not to limit, what I was eating. Just never even thought of it. Same with going out to sushi afterward, I just ate and drank whatever the hell I felt like. Which, I cannot deny, is enjoyable, but it's not helping me lose weight. This is what I realized at the start of my current effort — I have an extremely healthy diet in my day-to-day eating, but allow myself too many exceptions. Because I eat a nice balanced diet of vegetables, fruit, and low-fat meat, my brain thinks it's okay to have a Wendy's double with fries every third day or so. And maybe that's fine for a normal weight person, but not for me. It's so unfair, and pisses me off immensely, that my extreme "upper" range of calories is well below the average person's usual consumption, but that's also an important part of how I managed to come this far: I gave up the idea of "fairness." This is the hand I've been dealt, as they say, so I'll play what I've got. Other people also have physical limitations or conditions, or what have you, that they aren't happy with and deal with every day. This is mine. Mine, mine, mine.  On another subject, have you noticed that I haven't gone to see Troy? I don't think I will. Two reasons: 1. the more commercials I see, the more computer animation I notice, and I  hate  CG. I really really hate it. Moviemakers, please take note: CG sucks. You all are so thrilled with yourselves to develop scenes with gigantic buildings, herds of zebra, spaceships, people dancing in a reflective room with curved surfaces. Like, whatever. I don't care. What you're creating is just some complex math. It might make the nipples sproing out on a programmer, but it doesn't do anything for me. It doesn't LOOK GOOD.  All that ridiculous detail is not the way human beings experience sight. If we were THERE in real life, in that scene, it wouldn't look like that to us. If you want to learn how to capture the way a complex visual system FEELS to a human, go watch Disney's original Bambi. Check out the backgrounds. No, I am not kidding.  You thought I forgot about Reason 2, didn't you? I did not. Reason 2 is some unfortunate comments Pitt and others made in the recent Vanity Fair. I quote: "He [Achilles] wasn't formed by any belief system; it was strictly trial and error, and yet he was able to take those experiences and create himself from it." Um, dude? Not formed by any belief system? Are you out of your mind? Okay, sarcasm aside, the entire character of Achilles is ABOUT the way he is formed by a very strong belief system. He is a man whose lineage is half-divine. Any woman caught with a baby and no husband is going to have the good sense to say a passing god impregnated her. That's a pretty common story amongst ancient Hellenes, so, like other heroes who claim a god for a father, he has to prove it. The glory and honor he achieves in war are the unarguable evidence that he is the child of a god. His victories not only reflect his own honor, they bring honor to Zeus. Achilles, more than other men, must make his life a dedication to the god.  Now, does that sound like someone with no belief system?  There is also a silly comment by Wolfgang Petersen that "[Achilles is] a very modern kind of man." No way. Modern men are not driven by the same motives as Achilles. He's the very antithesis of modern man. There are some notable exceptions, but I am prepared to say that modern men, Americans at least, are not motivated primarily by the concepts of honor and service (to a greater being or greater ideal).   Feh, I say.

       6:53 a.m. Saturday, Day 159.  Okay, I have had enough of this. Fall asleep early, like 9:30 or 10:00, wake up at 12:30, stay awake until 3:30, sleep until 6:30, then I'm up, with sandpaper eyelids.  This has got to stop.  My irregular sleep pattern has become so entrenched that I suspect my brain is doing it. For some stupid subconscious reason, it's setting off the internal alarm clock every night, because now it thinks that's how we do it. My brain is so stupid.  *that line was in a spam I received recently. It almost looks like it... means something.  This evening we're going to the opening of the Hudson River School exhibit at the art museum. Wine and hors d'oeuvres, and then a tour of the exhibit by the curator. Can't WAIT. Daisy is going too, and then we're going to have sushi after.

       6:51 a.m. Friday, Day 158. Dammit, I am NOT doing well this week. I'm not sure exactly what my problem is. Just not paying enough attention, I think. I'm eating whatever is handy, instead of planning my meals. As always, I haven't had any giant binges or junk-food eating, just my portions creeping up. I know that part of the problem is I'm really tired of soup for breakfast, and haven't found a good alternative yet. So my breakfast calories have about doubled without my noticing. Need to find something besides soup...  10:03 a.m. I am starting to feel more normal. The deck crew is gone, and that's a relief. They were very good, but they tended to need something about twice a day, plus I was still dealing with the permit and inspections, so I've been tied to the house most of this week. They finished yesterday morning, so I was able to go to my interview with that under my belt, and then afterward to Marella's to return her pottery that Bucko shot. A couple beers and then home to a relaxing evening on the deck. We even ate out there, coated head-to-toe in mosquito repellant. Today, the carpet estimator at 11:00. Then another interview at 2:00 p.m. for Daisy's old temp job. Not stressed about that, exactly, but not looking forward either.  I can't complain, I've never had a job handed to me on a silver platter quite so easily. It's not in the bag, of course, they may decide not to hire me, particularly since I will be gone most of next week. But at this point they are very predisposed to me, since it will make things easier for them than starting over with the temp agency.  I plan to visit Totally Wine on the way back, and Wal-mart to look for that Curvaceous underwear as a little treat for myself. At this point I only have one bra that fits. All the others are too big, even on the smallest settings and after I put them in the dryer to shrink them. I don't at all mind losing size in my chest, but please could I just lose a couple inches around my waist for once???  11:30 a.m. Carpet guy has come and gone. Nice guy, and handsome too. He RAVED about how nice the house is and LOVED my murals and furniture. It was wonderful getting feedback like that. I gave him a business card. Dude, buy some of my stuff!  4:24 p.m. Back from interview, which went well. Hopefully I will start June 14 (my birthday!). The assignment should last for one month, and I think I can get almost full time out of it. Yay. It's about two-thirds my usual pay, so that's not too bad. Wal-Mart sucks just as bad as Kmart did in the underwear department - why in the name of all that is holy would you stock a BROWN bra with pink ribbons and NOT stock the corresponding panty? What do you wear with that, the lilac and green brief?  Bah.  But I did pick up a plain old white bra, in a 42DD, which is two inches smaller than what I used to wear. I'll be in a DD until I get down to around 160 pounds, when I  might  fit into a D. Yeah, it's like that. And if you think for one moment that having a large bosom has affected my life in ANY positive way, you can think again. Please do not give me that "I'd trade with you in a hearbeat" nonsense. You know not of what you speak.

       6:44 a.m. Thursday, Day 157.  Well. I'm feeling a little more normal today. 1471 calories yesterday, which is mid-range for me, so that's good. Slept better than I have for a week or so. The deck is almost done, should be over with this morning. This afternoon my job interview with university temp services. Also sometime today a phone call from Daisy's other temp job, who are considering me to take her place, because she has found a better temp-to-perm at the university. Small world, eh? Then tomorrow the carpet estimator guy at 11:00. Then, thank god, the weekend.

       10:52 a.m. Wednesday, Day 156.  Well. I hope life will be a little more back-to-normal today. I've been running at full steam since — I'm not sure when, I think a couple weeks. Certainly since last Thursday. They started building the deck yesterday, and the inspection office did indeed have the permit ready, and I was able to schedule the first footing inspection for this morning. Hopefully he will show up soon and I can also schedule the final for tomorrow. It looks so nice, I'm feeling even more like I don't want to move! All this time we've had a simple landing on the back door. When the house was built we couldn't afford to have a deck built, and then we kept saying we'd do it ourselves, and of course we didn't. Watching these guys work, I'm glad we didn't!  I'm not sure we could have handled it.  I finally put together a calorie estimate for Monday and Tuesday, and it's not pretty. That is, Monday was bad, Tuesday was medium. Will try to get my act together today. Planning on salad for lunch, maybe a mango, and possibly a tiny bit of leftover potroast.

Now I'm going back trying to remember what I've had, and of course I can't. And what I do remember, I don't have numbers for, because it's stuff I don't usually eat. So, a little research for me tomorrow.

       6:25 a.m. Friday, Day 213. Sh1t. My amazing feat of self-restraint yesterday wasn't enough to keep me within goal. 1950 calories, caused partly by a couple glasses of wine and some of those new chocolate jelly bellies, which Bucko brought me from NJ. Only a small handful, literally 15 pieces, but chocolate adds up quickly. They were tasty, but not as delightful as regular JBs.  I need to get myself to the grocery store early today. All I've got in the house is that hamburger, and while that's okay for one meal every other day or so, it's too high in fat and cals to eat more often. Need to get some chicken and hopefully fish, and we're down to the last bit of vegetable matter, too. And, of course, the job hunting. Well, I've been doing that every day, I just haven't had any results to write about. I've sent out a gazillion resumes and the best I've gotten is automated email responses. My only lead currently is  maybe  I can be a laptop instructor for two days at one of the local colleges. That's lapTOP, not lap DANCE. I think (don't have the details yet) that they put on an orientation for the incoming students that includes basic computer operation, because all freshman are required to have/purchase a laptop for school. Well, what the hell, I'll do it. Of course, I quickly need to learn how to use a laptop. Yes, I know, it's insane, I've been using a computer for TWENTY ONE years, and have never used a laptop. Never.  Not sure what else to do today. Bucko is back, obviously, but he's going to work today.   10:03 a.m. Trying to make up for yesterday's calories in a big way: 45 minutes cardio blast, 20 minutes aerobics. I rule. And I now have completely exhausted tricep muscles.  12:22 p.m. I'm thinking about not blogging for a while. Still maintaining my offline journal, but putting the online aspect on hiatus, and maybe dropping out of reading blogs for a while. I'm not sure I can articulate exactly why I'm feeling like this. I guess I think I'm becoming too caught up with other people's issues and concerns, and thus not spending enough thought on my own. Reading blogs has been so so SO helpful to me, but right now it's exerting too much influence on me. (See - all you people had no idea what POWER you have!  :-) For example there's a lot of WLS talk going around, and I am very anti-WLS. But I don't really want to write about that, because I don't want anyone to think I am arguing with them in some sort of oblique, passive way. Because I'm not. But then there's no reason I shouldn't write about it, because that's what blogging's for, and I can say whatever the heck I want, and nobody ever objected to that in the first place, what am I, some kind of paranoid freak? (answer: yes). But on the other hand, I had no interest in the subject of WLS until I started reading it elsewhere, so why bother to write about something I don't care about? What's the point? So I spend too much time thinking about this kind of thing, and wondering what to write in my own blog that could be of interest to anyone else, wanting to be honest but not wanting to be offensive, yadda yadda, all these tangental issues, and I realize I'm no longer using blogging as a tool to help me lose weight, I'm using it as a hobby related to losing weight.  Yeah, I think I need to do this. So, folks (as though there are hundreds of people reading this), I'm going to take a one-week break and see what I think after that. Very likely I'll realize that the whole blogging experience is very important and I need to return to it. Maybe I just need a little vacation from thinking about other people, because you know I do become very interested in what all of you are doing, and when you have bad days I feel bad for you, and when you have good days it makes me happier. So I will be back on August 6. Kisses to all! Mmmmmwaaah!

       9:07 a.m. Thursday, Day 212.  I believe I have achieved 8 hours sleep, in one night. Haven't done that in a long time. I'm feeling pretty good this morning, consequently. I sort of don't even want to post my calories from yesterday, because it's a whopper. So let me get it over quick, I'll type it fast and you read it really fast: 2392. Okay, glad that's over. My plan today is to drink a LOT of water, and stick to vegetables as much as possible.  I have an eggplant that would make a delicious lunch...  Two more days until the Trying On. Keeping my fingers crossed. I don't  feel  like I've lost any weight, but of course that's not meaningful. I'm right in the middle of TOM, so I might wait until early next week for the Try On.   11:55 a.m. Oh, sometimes I impress myself so much. Last night Daisy brought a bag of these Combos, which I don't now how to describe. They're not chips, but they're some kind of crunchy, salty, cheesey snack in a bag. Delicious and entirely without nutritional value. Anyway, this morning I ate four or five of them, put the bag away, and then two minutes later took it back out of the pantry. Getting ready to finish the rest. Somehow I overrode the impulse, turned to the trash can and up-ended the bag into the trash. Whew. That was hard, but I am o so glad I did it.  A fascinating  urlLink editorial  about treating obesity as a disease. "We don't really know whether taxpayer costs are higher, on balance, than they would be if everyone were thin. In the case of smokers, economic analyses indicate that taxpayer savings from less health care in old age and fewer Social Security payments (because of shorter life expectancies) outweigh the costs of treating tobacco-related diseases. Something similar could be true of obesity."

       7:19 a.m. Wednesday, Day 211. How do I feel? Repeat of yesterday. Pretty good, but suffering some allergy symptoms. I've been sleeping well considering Bucko is gone, so that helps. I took a small piece of Actifed before bed last night, but it doesn't seem to have helped with the baggy eyes. Well, it's not like I'm having my school picture today. 1205 calories yesterday. Very low, and so was Monday. Today will be somewhat higher, since I'm making pot roast and will be drinking some amount of wine. Also making mashed potatoes (fat-free yogurt substituted for milk and butter), steamed carrots, and probably salad. Also I bought ground beef on sale (99 cents a pound), so I'm having hamburger for lunch. It's pretty high in calories — 191 for a 3-oz patty — so I will definitely be at my upper limit or above.  I borrowed a couple movies from the neighbors: How To Lose a Guy in Ten Days and Saving Private Ryan. How To Lose was just intolerably stupid and dull and I couldn't watch it. I mean, I wasn't expecting a brilliant classic, just something entertaining and fun. It was neither. It's the same kind of zany romantic comedy that was popular in the thirties and forties, but the things is, with such silly, unbelievable plots, you have to compensate with witty dialogue and engaging characters (imagine Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn). Let's just say there was  no  compensation going on here. I must be the last person on earth to see Saving Private Ryan, and I am quite impressed. The cinematography and editing style all work together to bring you a sense of the contradictions of battle — the dilated time sense, the numbness, the moments of intense clarity, the choppiness of movements, the discontinuity between this moment and the next. Really really good, and I highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it. It's emotionally exhausting, though. Not a feel-good movie (yet strangely, not a feel-bad movie either).  Today I'm thinking about something the daughter of a friend said to me. Several adults in her life have lost significant amounts of weight recently, and we were talking about weight loss. While she thinks it's good, she also comments that she doesn't quite understand it, because she just wouldn't "let herself get that way." She's not quite 16, so I wasn't wounded by what she said, but it did get under my skin a little. I didn't have a reply, really, because I wasn't sure that what I wanted to say was entirely acceptable. I was thinking "Let myself GET this way? I've ALWAYS been this way."  But I didn't want to say anything that sounded like "It's someone else's fault I'm fat." On the other hand, damned if I think it's  my  fault!  I was born fat. I was fat as a two year old, a six year old, a 20 year old. Now seriously, how much are you going to hold a toddler responsible for her weight? Are you going to lecture an infant on her formula intake and put her on a treadmill? I didn't suddenly become fat as an adult; the condition was determined long before I had any control over it.   As an adult, I make a huge distinction between the idea of responsibility versus blame.  I do not at all believe it is my "fault" that I'm fat. But I do believe that I'm personally responsible for what I do about it, if for no other reason that at this point in time, there is no magic pill. The only known method is dieting and exercising, and no one else can do that for me.  Of course, as I'm writing this I realize that there is at least one other way — weight loss surgery. I've never considered it as an option, though I probably qualify for it. I'm not sure exactly what my antipathy is; I'll have to think it through before I can write about it. I suppose, for the short answer, I don't really believe it's safe, but that's an emotional reaction, nothing I have any proof of.  4:08 p.m. Just got back from the kitty. I made sure to wash my hands and face a couple times while I was there, and I think it helped. Watched a few minutes of TV with him. Charlie's Angels (the second one I think) was on. Now, that looks like an amusing movie. Not brilliant, but fun. So maybe I'll rent that sometime.

       7:38 a.m. Tuesday, Day 210. I feel okay today, but I look like HELL.  I was shocked when I looked in the mirror — HUGE black circles under my eyes, pale skin, puffy face, red eyes. Then I remembered "Oh yeah, the cat."  I'm cat-sitting for the neighbors, and my "slight" allergy to the little weasel has developed into a  huge  allergy. My chest hurt and my eyes were almost swollen shut when I came back from feeding and petting yesterday afternoon. I had to wash my face and hands and change clothes. And he's a very very affectionate kitty who's lonely with his people gone. So LOTS of hugging. Oh boy, three more days of that...  1287 calories yesterday, no drinking! Yes, I agree it is pathetic that I'm celebrating  24 whole hours without alcohol,  gee Marla maybe you can get a one-day pin, but my point is that because I am lonely, scared, and bored, it is significant that I'm not medicating with drink or food.   Did 30 minutes of aerobics, fairly lame. Although my sleep was better, now I'm suffering from cat hair and my chest hurts. If it's not one thing, it's ten others...  5:09 p.m. Just got back from sitting the kitty.  I think I'm going to have to take some sort of allergy medicine, an Actifed or something like that. Which means I will fall asleep in about one hour. I'm having so much reaction, though, that I have to risk it ("it" being a restless night of nonsleep). Itchy, chest hurts, etc. In fact, I'm sleepy now. How early is it decent to go to bed? 6:00? Can I stretch it to 7:00?

       7:34 a.m. Monday, Day 209.  I guess I'm in decent shape. Of course, was awake for a couple hours, but I slept in until 7:00, so I'm better off than many other days.  Should have lost one pound last week. That puts me (on paper) as having accomplished my original ten percent goal (26 pounds).  The reason I'm not having a major celebration today is that I passed it a long time ago; what I calculated as the amount and rate of my weight loss was an underestimate. The last time I was at Daisy's, I weighed 217. I should have lost two pounds since then, so I'm going to  start my next ten percent goal today  at 215 pounds, with 21.5 pounds to lose. Just imagine, at the end of that goal I'll weigh  under 200!!   I'll continue to track whether, by the numbers, I've lost any weight each week. I know it's a crazy system, but it prevents me from going scale-crazy. If I track my calories and exercise, then at the end of the week I can say "Yep, a 4,374 calorie deficit this week, I should have lost 1.25 pounds." For me it's a less angst-filled method than using a scale, because those things LIE and CHEAT.   So let me talk about how I first figured out my daily caloric needs. I surfed for BMI and BMR, and found several sites that calculate, based on your height, weight, age, sex, and level of activity, how many calories you need per day to live. I averaged the results from five different sites, and found that to maintain the same weight, I should eat 2300 calories per day. The rule of thumb for losing weight is that 3500 calories equals one pound. To lose one pound per week (oppw, as I say), eat 500 fewer calories a day (x7 days=3500). To lose two pounds per week, eat 1000 fewer calories a day.  That's A LOT. If anyone is wondering why weight loss is so slow, that's why.  I subtracted 500 and 1000 from 2300 to get my weight-losing calorie range: tppw = 1300 calories a day, oppw = 1800 calories per day.  Not long ago, I decided to refigure my numbers based on my new weight. You know my weight loss has been creeping along recently, and one thing I considered is that I am now eating too many calories for my lower weight (isn't that a horrible thought?)  I tried to use the same method of averaging the results from five or six different sites, because they don't all return the same answer. But two of the sites I used in my original calculations no longer exist.  Apparently they gave lower-than-normal estimates, because all the other calculators I used told me that I should be losing one pound per week at 1900-2200 calories per day.  Well, obviously not. If that were true, that means to maintain my weight I could eat 2700 calories per day. 2700 calories is more than I normally eat when I'm  not  dieting. Yet I've been  gaining  weight for the last... well, the last 43 years. And that, I suppose, is where metabolism, hormones, genetics, or some other hoo-doo comes into play. That's why "calories in versus calories out" is a valid equation only in a test tube.   Because I haven't been able to refigure the calories to my satisfaction, I'm going to continue with the 1300-1800 range. That's working for me (I hope).  1:32 p.m. Back from the dentist (just a cleaning). Lettuce wraps again for lunch. I'm going to have a split lunch today, another little meal around 3:00. Finished cleaning guest room and guest bath. Laundry done. Almost done Daisy's table (has to dry). Wrote and emailed estimate for logo design for recruiter.   8:09 p.m. Tried making a web page in Dreamweaver, but I wanted to do something with frames and couldn't quite figure it out — I had to go back to hand-coding. Doing really well with food and drink. I'm impressed with myself. Daisy has postponed dinner to Wednesday, and I was SO looking forward to it. I am bitterly disappointed but proud of myself for not allowing it as an excuse to throw a pity party and overindulge. Miss Bucko terribly. Three more days to go.

       6:58 a.m. Sunday, Day 208.  I am not feeling wonderful today, but it's nothing mysterious — went to bed too late, got up too early (Bucko is driving to NJ this morning to visit relatives and is making an early start). ALSO had two Taco Bell salt-lick tacos last thing before going to bed. That was a very bad decision, and one of the few times I've just slipped right off plan without consciously deciding to. Somehow I just ended up eating two tacos at 11:30 p.m. without even considering the consequences. Which, combined with some other bad choices yesterday, totalled up 2666 calories in one day. Holy cow!  Well, no great harm done, I am still within my oppw goal — cutting back on the drinking does indeed save me a lot of calories, and I had low days all the rest of the week. It's just amazing how those calories creep up.   9:30 a.m. The next five days seem awfully empty. I'm going to miss Bucko so much. He's been gone 45 minutes and I feel lost. I'd like to have some kind of project to do, to keep my mind occupied, but I don't know what.  I will have to make a very serious effort to not overeat and overdrink, because I already have a feeling of "all bets are off." Dangerous.  I need a list of chores and projects, goals and rewards.  10:19 a.m. Here's my preliminary list, which I will add to as things occur to me.   Projects/chores    Finish painting Daisy's table   Clean oven   Wash guest room sheets   Clean guest room bath   Stain deck (weather permitting)   Weed garden   Do a website in Dreamweaver, even if fake   Make a tortoiseshell sample board   Make two marble sample boards   Sew some painting aprons     Goals/rewards    Drink a LOT of water    Stay on plan    Keep alcohol to a minimum   Paint or draw daily   Exercise daily   Concoct some kind of bizarre facial out of food items    1:47 p.m. Holding on, just. Bucko has called me twice with status reports (obviously he misses me as much as I miss him). I've done two loads of laundry, plus run the dishwasher, plus run the self-cleaning oven, and it is HOT downstairs. Really really hot. I'm doing  okay  with eating; it won't be one of my best days, because I had a handful of nuts this morning, but it won't be too bad. I had a fantastic lunch of lettuce wraps: make long thin slices of cucumber, carrots, red peppers, and a hard cheese (like Asagio). Wrap in lettuce leaves and dunk in low-cal dressing. Delicious. I love food like that, because it's pretty, there are lots of different colors and textures, and it's fun to eat.  I will probably need a nap this afternoon, after getting up at the crack of dawn. I'm watching a show on local PBS featuring the director of the art museum here, and it's quite good, but he has this weird ass way of pronouncing "museum" that's sort of like "moo-zyum." I don't know how to describe it; imagine Inspector Clouseau saying it. And, of course, he says it  a lot .  8:16 p.m. 1818 calories for the day, and I'm going to consider that a success. I ate a lot, and frequently, but it was mostly low-calorie, healthy, vegetable-based meals. I'm hanging on...

       7:03 a.m. Saturday, Day 207.  I didn't wake up much last night, but I don't feel rested this morning either. 1845 calories yeserday. Friday is usually my big day, plus lunch out was a wad of calories. I had Chicken Massaman, but I only ate half to two-thirds of it, so I'm estimating that at 282 calories, according to what I found on cooking.com. I also had a wee bit of chocolate. But that was all balanced out by a dinner of sauteed brussels sprouts (with olive oil, 106 calories), spinach (25), and salmon (206).  They had frozen wild salmon on sale for $2.99 a pound, which is cheaper than chicken breasts, so I got a package. It was quite good, more of a strong fish taste than the farm-raised stuff we usually get, and definitely not as pink (no dye). I will watch for that to be on sale in the future.  I haven't been exercising the way I'd like this week, because of the fatigue. I hope that's ending... yesterday I didn't need to nap and felt better in general, so hopefully it's over.   urlLink Kristen  has pointed out that Benefiber is the wrong kind of fiber to move the estrogen out of the system, if you get my drift. Doh! Back to the drawing board.

       6:48 a.m. Friday, Day 206. Once again my sleep could have been worse, but it wasn't good, and it's catching up with me. I woke up at 3:00 with a backache, and fell back asleep sometime around 4:30. I don't know what to do about this — aspirin isn't enough to block it out. It doesn't seem to be the mattress, because I have the same problem no matter where I sleep, and it doesn't seem linked to anything during the day. At least nothing I recognize as being the cause. I've got to do some detective work on this, because it's becoming a real nuisance.  1440 calories yesterday, and two glasses of water with Benefiber, but unfortunately only 15.5 grams of fiber. I'd better start sprinkling that stuff on my food like salt! Only 8 more days until the Great Measurement Shorts Try On.  I haven't tried them since the end of June, so I have hopes I will see  some  progress. Have to check the calendar for TOM — I'm not going to try them if the timing's bad, I'll wait another week if necessary.  6:08 p.m. Lunch was great, I really hit it off with the recruiter. Seemed like I've known her for years. Unfortunately the freelance work won't materialize until sometime in August.

       7:05 a.m. Thursday, Day 205. All I can say is, it could have been worse. My sleeping, that is. I was awake from 4:00 to 5:30, but got in another hour after that. So although I don't feel  wonderful,  I'm not too badly off.  1485 calories yesterday, pretty good considering how much I ate. A neighbor brought over some home-baked zucchini bread, and I had a small slice of that in the evening. Not sure of the calories, I checked several recipes on the web and averaged them.  I have LOTS to do this morning before the crew gets here. Not the least of which is shower and wash my hair. No idea what I'm going to wear, or how to do my hair, or any of those important details. In the middle of the night (4:00) last night, I thought "Surely any normal woman, faced with a television apearance, would have scheduled a trip to the beauty parlor and/or hair stylist, to have her hair and face done up professionally?"  Well, maybe so, but I guess I'm not that normal woman. It never occured to me until last night, and now there's no time. Even worse, one of the weather anchors is on these segments, and so a beautiful, professionally made up woman will be standing right next to me.  5:27 p.m. Okay, the shoot went really well. Everything was fine, all the crew were really nice, and I don't think I appeared too much of a dumb-ass. They are interested in having me on again, doing murals, but there's no firm commitment. However, the producer is the one who mentioned it, I didn't bring it up, so hopefully it will come to pass. Next step: Hollywood. Heh. One of the people who appeared on a segement recently was spotted by a "scout" for Carol Duvall and is going to be on her show! So I have great hopes that I'll get some kind of exposure, if only locally. We did shoot in front of a mural, which will not get a LOT of coverage because the shots are mostly in close, but it's  something.  All my worry was for naught, as my worry frequently is.  In other news, I have a temperature of 99.7.  Not super high, but enough that I suspect I am coming down with something. That could explain the fatigue, or vice versa. I have a lunch tomorrow with a recruiter, who also wants me to do a web page for her, so hopefully something will come of that.  Now I'm tired and my eyes are burny, so off I go for another nap.

       6:09 a.m. Wednesday, Day 204. Okay, I am officially in the pattern of Can't get comfortable and toss and turn all night and my back hurts. I really would like another couple hours sleep this morning, but instead here I am all dry-eyed and sore, awake since 5:00. Bah. AND I think I feel the first twinge of a cramp. Oh lordy, and with the shoot scheduled for tomorrow...  1432 calories yesterday, pretty good. I had this amazingly low total at the end of the day, was so impressed with myself, and then realized I had left out breakfast calories. Doh! No harm done, I'm still in my range, but disappointing. 25 grams of fiber yesterday — that's still 5 short of goal. I supposed it's not a bad thing to increase gradually. Anyone remember the Colon Blow cereal commercial on the old SNL?  7:50 a.m. I'm feeling tired and weak again this morning. Probably due to lack of sleep, but it's getting to be a big problem with exercising — I don't have the energy or stamina to do much of anything. I suspect also that I haven't been eating enough to support the level of exercise I've been trying to do. Probably I need to increase my breakfast calories a little, which makes me nervous. That's the meal where I've managed to cut out the most calories, compared to my pre-diet pattern. I'm afraid of adding on in the morning, because later in the day it's harder for me to stay on target, so I don't think I'll be able to balance the addition with subtraction at another meal. Guess I'll just have to try it and see. If I add a couple hundred calories to my day, but am able to exercise for an hour, that seems like a good tradeoff.  So far today I've had coffee (38), half a can of soup (120) and a banana (105) for a total of 263 calories. The banana is what I've added on, and I'm considering a little more protein in addition, maybe leftover bean salad. I've drank two glasses of water so far, and will hope to get in two more before 9 a.m. (exercise time).  10:22 a.m. Here's what I did. Had the little bit of bean salad, more water. Did 60 minutes of Cardio Blast!  It was hard, but I made it through. Ate a piece of chicken and a slice of pineapple — after workout protein and carbs.  I've added about 300 calories more than I would normally eat by this time of day! Not good! Or maybe it is!  I guess all I can do is try it for a while and see.  2:37 p.m. Okay, this sucks. I am EXHAUSTED again this afternoon. I've laid down to rest three times, and I'm so sleepy. I need to get everything ready for the shoot tomorrow, and I've done almost nothing. I need to figure out what I'm going to show before a production crew shows up at 10 a.m.! I just feel overwhelmed, and like my brain is stuck in quicksand.  I want to postulate all sorts of exotic diseases, but I think it's really pretty simple: I'm stressed as hell, worried and anxious, and trying to push my body really hard on too few calories and not enough sleep. I'm going upstairs now for a serious nap - a get into bed wearing jammies type of nap, because if that's what I have to do to accomplish something today, better to do it now.  6:19 p.m. It's taken me this long to muster up enough energy to start working on the lampshades and such. I had a two-hour lie down, with about half of it being actual sleep, and I STILL feel like I could snooze.  I've been very hungry and thirsty today, and eating a lot. My calories are still good, I've been eating mini mini meals all day long. I'm at 1033 right now, and expect another 300-400 before the day's end. That's not bad. Hope tomorrow goes well, cross your fingers for me.

       *sometimes those random titles are SO damned accurate...  6:41 a.m. Tuesday, Day 203. Slept pretty well, feel okay this morning. 1439 calories yesterday. This morning I have my crown reaffixed, I'm looking forward to being able to chew on both sides. I made the  urlLink zucchini lasagna  again yesterday. Man that stuff is good!   After the dentist, I hope to spend the day preparing for the shoot. I am not nearly ready, and starting to freak out. Freak freak freak! Yes, and I notice I have a touch of echolalia recently, another sign of stress (I think I'm making a joke, but on further reflection there might be something to that).  I've been reading on  urlLink someone else's  blog about estrogen dominance, and I'm very interested in how things turn out for her. My gyno made a similar, well it was more like a comment than a diagnosis, but anyway I got the same story a few years ago, and honestly I pretty much dismissed it. It sounded like she was saying, "You can't lose weight because you're fat." And at that time, I was tired of hearing every ailment or condition I had being attributed to my weight, so I never pursued it. Although, it's not like she suggested any treatment or course of action anyway, it sounded more like a Catch22 that I would have to live with. Anyway, I have a lot of the same symptoms as this girlie, although I have regular periods and no PCOS (that I know of): belly fat, acne, hirsutism, boils (and probably a plague of frogs for good measure), insomnia, anxiety, hot flashes, and depression. I pretty much won't admit to the depression, especially not to a doctor, because I refuse to get on the modern-day Valley of the Dolls bandwagon and be medicated, but to myself I can't deny it exists.  In other blogger news,  urlLink Denise  here has lost a few pounds  while on vacation,  and I'm so happy for her. It's making me hopeful. See, this is what  urlLink I mean  about how I am influenced by what other people are writing, which I suppose is the purpose of blogging, so guess what? It works. I feel all happy and glowy and positive now.  Here's the best job I've found today: "  Tire Stacker  A company is looking for light industrial workers for various temporary/contract assignments: Rolling tires, stacking and loading tires, etc. Heavy lifting (50lbs) required. Repetative moving, lifting, bending and loading is also required. Call Express for details."   Today I'm starting on a new plan of not drinking so much. I kind of don't even want to write about it, because I'm afraid I will revert and then be ashamed, etc. However, I have to face the fact that I'm adding a whole bunch of useless calories to my diet every time I have a drink. And I find that because of weight, metabolism, and age, I have to drink A LOT to feel enhanced. Like, the way I used to feel with one or two glasses of wine, just kind of happy and relaxed, it now takes me 4 glasses. I just don't want to be drinking that much — it's not healthy in any sense, diet or no diet. Not to mention we can't afford it. So, I'm confining it to the weekends, i.e., Friday and Saturday evenings. A bottle of wine shared between the two of us. Today — Tuesday— is a normal "drinking night" for us, so I'm cancelling it (for me, Bucko can drink as he sees fit). The funny thing is, if we don't have it in the house, I don't drink. I won't bother to go out and buy alcohol or go to a bar. But if it IS in the house, then I WILL drink it. Not unlike candy...  so anyway, the strategy is obvious. Don't buy it.  Also, I'm going to increase my fiber. I really don't get enough, I suppose partly because I shun bread and pasta. I do eat a lot of vegetables, but you'd be surprised how little fiber most have. A carrot is very high at 2 grams each, but most vegetables, because they are largely water, are in the .5 to 1 gram range. I'm averaging only 15 grams a day, which I want to double. I'm going to start putting the Benefiber in my water. That's the nice thing about that stuff, it will dissolve completely even in ice water and have no taste. I've been reading up on the estrogen dominance thing, and increased fiber is indeed one thing to try. And since it won't hurt to increase anyway...

       6:49 a.m. Monday, Day 202. Feeling somewhat tired this morning. I didn't sleep that well last night, lots of tossing and turning. Sometimes I get into this pattern where I cannot get comfortable on the bed, and my back hurts all night long, and I roll over from this side to that side. It will go on for three or four nights, and then disappear. Other than that, I was okay. No extended periods of wakefulness. I watched Fantasia while I was falling asleep, and I think that made me happy and relaxed. The worst part is that I am physically unrested and will have a hard time exercising today. I'm guzzling water early so I can at least be well hydrated.  Figured my numbers for last week — I should have lost 1.25 pounds. If I go entirely according to the numbers, that means I have one-quarter of a pound left in my initial goal (10%, or 26 pounds).  Of course, according to Daisy's scale I passed that a long time ago. I think what I will do, is at the end of this week, or whenever I next go to Daisy's, I will use that weight as my starting point for the next 10% goal (currently would be about 22 pounds).   I've been using the Measurement Shorts as my goal more than number of pounds, but I am just not getting anywhere with those things!  I have definitely lost a small amount of weight in the past 4-6 weeks, and all my other clothes are looser, my wedding ring is looser, but not those shorts. It's confirming what I have suspected for a long time — I've lost little or no inches around the upper part of my waist. Yeah, I know, how funny will it be when I weigh 135 pounds and still have a 46 inch stomach?  I have SO much to do today: 1. exercise 2. tweak resume and apply for printing services purchaser position 3. grocery shop 4. check Goodwill for lamps and furniture 5. finish painting armoire (the impressionist scene) 6. call mortgage broker (STILL haven't done that) 7. start cleaning up house for shoot on Thursday.  9:47 a.m. I think today I will have to be grateful for small victories and not be too rough on myself. I managed 30 minutes of Cardio Blast, and that's all I could do. I'm going to focus on the 30 minutes I did, instead of the other 30 minutes I didn't do. Which reminds me of something else — I'm going to buy some Gatorade or other electrolyte-replenishing sports drink. For some time now I've been really exhausted after exercising, like I have to lie down and nap exhausted. It seems like I'm recovering slowly. I do drink a lot of water before and after, and some during, so I don't think it's simple dehydration. And here is something else I notice about exercising: I don't stop sweating for quite a long time after. 30 minutes, 40 minutes, something like that. I don't even bother taking a shower until an hour after, because I haven't cooled down enough to stop pouring sweat; any sooner and I sweat right through the shower and keep on sweating after. Sweat sweat sweat.  12:54 p.m. Have finished Items 1 through 4.  I did NOT buy Gatorade, because (surprise!) its main ingredient is corn syrup! No thanks!  I'm going to surf some body building sites and see if anyone can recommend an alternative. Please email me if you know of something low-calorie I could eat or drink after exercise to stabilize myself.  4:58 p.m. I finally forced myself to take some progress photos. It's always distressing, and this was no exception. However, once I got over the big shock of seeing myself, I could take an inventory.  In the front shots, it didn't look like I'd lost any weight at all. I looked exactly the same. In the side shot, I could see that my upper arms and upper thighs were definitely smaller. My stomach, as I've been saying, was pretty much the same. In the shot from behind I could really see a difference. I've lost a lot in my thighs and butt, arms, and even my back. But this stomach thing is SO frustrating! I look nine months pregnant! Arrgh. Anyway, here's the funny part — I stood in the same place and put the camera in approximately the same place, but it's not like I had marked it on the floor or anything. When I overlay the new shots on the old, I'm standing in EXACTLY the same position. My limbs are EXACTLY in the same spot. I couldn't tell which was the old and which the new picture. Hee.

       8:31 a.m. Sunday, Day 201. Feeling pretty good, perhaps a bit slow. I overslept, and that always makes me a little groggy. Not that I set an alarm on Sunday morning, I'm just talking about total hours of sleep. Around nine, which is too much for me. Maybe I'm trying to catch up.  1770 calories yesterday, not bad at all for a weekend. I've got plenty left for today and still come in at one pound per week. I would so much like to speed that up, but I don't think it's possible. My body seems to want to lose weight VERY slowly, and I'm not willing to eat less than I am (not sure that would be effective, anyway). I did 30 minutes of aerobics yesterday (Bodies in Motion) since I missed exercise on Friday. I don't like it as much as Cardio Blast; I've never been that fond of pure aerobics.   The last of the catfish stew for breakfast, and then I will go buy a newspaper to search for nonexistent jobs.  4:26 p.m. As expected, not a single job. I'm trying to think outside the box, as it were, and search for things I  might  be qualified to do, but not having any luck. I've really only done the one thing, my whole life. Spent the afternoon painting. I'm trying to learn to paint like an impressionist, and boy is it hard. If anyone thinks non-realistic artists just slop the paint on, I can tell you that's not the case. So it's not bad, but definitely I need more practice. I'm feeling a little peckish, or possibly bored, now. I have eaten just under 600 calories so far, which is about normal for me before dinner. I don't want to blow it by snacking. Going to go find something to do now, take my mind off it...  8:12 p.m. Wow! Only 1475 calories today, including a couple glasses of wine, and I don't feel hungry or deprived at all. That's very good, and I'm looking at my food chart to see what I did right.  I think the difference is that today I didn't eat one lunch, I ate two. Around 10:45 a.m. I had broccoli and one chicken drumstick (very small, 200 calories combined). Then at 2:00 p.m. I had a couple eggs (150 calories). I think splitting lunch into two small meals made the difference, and I am considering adopting that as my standard pattern. One situation where I get into trouble with eating is pre-dinner snacking: I am STARVING around 4:00, and can't wait another 2 or 3 hours for Bucko to get home. I end up having snacks PLUS dinner. Apparently if I split my lunch, it breaks up the day better.

       6:28 a.m. Saturday, Day 200.  Here's what I did yesterday. Getting ready to go sit outside on the deck, putting mosquito repellant lotion on my legs. Swung one foot up on the kitchen counter to do that side (like you do when you're shaving your legs in the bathroom sink). Finished, switched legs. Stood there for a second blinking and gasping. HEY!  I just put my foot up on the counter!  I haven't been able to do that in YEARS. And Poof! I just did it without even thinking about it!  Oh, so cool. So so cool. And in another sense, a frightening story concerning the sanitary condition of my kitchen. But never mind that! I put my foot up!  I'm leading with the good news first before I admit the bad: 2055 calories yesterday. Goodberry's frozen custard happened, as did martinis. That means I have 4522 calories left for the week, to stay within oppw. 2261 per day. That should be plenty. No way will I come in at tppw, but maybe I'll manage one and a quarter.  6:49 p.m. I became very ambitious this afternoon, and put together  urlLink this list  of my 100 favorite novels.

       6:28 a.m. Friday, Day 199. Oh, the dreams. I haven't had a night like that in a long time. I won't bore you, because they are too fragmentary.  1204 calories yesterday, very good. I've been eating catfish stew for a couple days, and that's very light (and delicious. recipe  urlLink here ). However, I want to up my protein today. Yesterday, 39 grams protein, 200 grams carbohydrate, 41 grams fat. Usually my carbs and protein are split about evenly. Today I will have MEAT. And BEANS. Oh yeah.  Now that I watch Fit TV all the time, I notice these commercials for some product — can't remember the name — that's supposed to help reduce belly fat by regulating your cortisol. Now, I know the cortisol thing is a real, documented phenomenon, but I doubt very much that these supplements have any legitimate effect. It's the same way I regard "miracle cleaners": I figure if these things really worked, you know reputable companies would have been selling them for years. Back in the day, in some previous diet attempts, I tried the supplement route. I think it was called Diet Fuel, and it was some pill you buy at GNC for a whopping amount of money. I have no idea what was in it, but I do know it didn't help me achieve any weight loss whatsoever. I also tried protein supplements, to force ketosis or whatever. And I went through a very brief Dexatrim phase. All useless.  It's been a long time since I tried supplements. And this time around, when weight loss is actually occurring, I've never even considered using them. My method has been white-knuckle diet and exercise, sheer physical and mental effort. That's the particular mindset that has worked for me — a "let's get real" attitude about weight loss, a refusal to fool myself with the sweet temptation of gimmicks. Just eat less, exercise more. I know, I hate that phrase myself, because it's usually uttered by some dildo who has never had a weight issue in his/her entire life. Dude/ess, let me tell you: it's not that easy.*  *Can I indulge in a little self-pitying whine here? I can? Thanks. To whit: I don't know a single person ("know" in the real-life face-to-face sense) who exercises as much as I do or who eats as healthily as I do. And yet these people are thin, and I am fat. There is simply no justice in the universe. The end.  So is anyone using supplements of any sort? I never read about it on anyone's blog. Is anyone having good results? Or bad? Email me if you're  using;  I'd like to know what your experience has been.  In other news, I am going to have martinis tonight, and I am so looking forward to it. Icy cold, delicious vodka martinis. It is something of a celebration in addition to Friday Drinking Night: Bucko is officially signed up as a student at the state college where he works. He's going to get some kind of Communication degree, which is also the department he works in. We figure it will take about thirteen years...  well, it will if he takes one class every semester plus summer. Because he is working full-time as well. But, things like that tend to work out, and I'll bet he can CLEP out of some things, get some kind of credit for experience, find a summer when he can carry a full course load, etc. etc., so that hopefully it will only take five or six years. So if anyone out there is currently, oh maybe 20 years old, and thinking about deferring college until later, let me give you this advice: Are you crazy?? Get it over with now! It is  not  going to get easier later.  In other other news, I had an email from The Orifice, saying that one of the documents which was delayed back in FEBRUARY has been approved and might go into production soon. Well, I'll believe it when I see it, but that would sure take some pressure off if I could get a couple weeks' work.

       6:49 a.m. Thursday, Day 198.  Feeling quite reasonable today. I had decent sleep. The late afternoon coffee yesterday doesn't seem to have affected me. I usually drink one cup of coffee in the morning, so I'm fairly sensitive to additional amounts. I had anticipated being awake all night.  1364 calories yesterday, not bad. The week got off to such a bad start, I'm glad to have a good day. Oh, and here's the really good news: weighed myself at Daisy's. I've lost  three pounds.  Yay!  It's not much to show for months of effort, but I was pretty terrified that I've been  gaining  weight recently, so I'll take it.  I'm crediting the Cardio Blast. For a month or two I haven't been exercising the way I should, and I think that caused the glacial rate of weight loss. I don't want to lower my calories any further; I need to increase exercise.  10:20 a.m. 45 minutes of Cardio Blast, legs and core, I'm EXHAUSTED.  I'm thinking about this whole weblog experience this morning. I had never read a blog until my weight loss attempt, and now I read several of them every day, including some non-weight ones. I publish my own, and I occasionally post comments on others' and email with them. It's been a really important aspect of my effort, because I've learned a lot from these writers. Sometimes by example and sometimes by "what not to do"!   I can't speak for anyone else, but I think sometimes we start a cycle together. I mean, we all read each other, we get ideas from each other and add our own particular perspective. Sometimes it's like a big game of telephone (purple monkey dishwasher). You can almost track an idea leaping from blog to blog over the course of a week. It can be good or bad. Sometimes it makes me reluctant* to write anything pessimistic or negative; I don't want to bring anyone else down, or start a negativity cycle. For the most part I refrain from criticizing or overly-analyzing anyone else's blog; expressing disagreement with someone else's life is just too close to openly contradicting or invalidating their experiences. And that seems to be the way most bloggers operate, and it's really really neat how supportive and encouraging we all are to each other.  Eventually there comes a point, though, when each person is on her own. The support of others is absolutely necessary to the process, but it doesn't do the work for you**. And as much as you can learn from other bloggers, you're not going to agree with everything they write, and at some point you have to say "That worked for them; but this is me. What works for ME?" You can't compare yourself with others; measure yourself against them; adopt all their strategies, their eating plans, and definitely not all their philosophies.   I'm not sure what my point is. I guess just to say that I'm appreciative of what I've learned from other bloggers, and at the same time cautious about equating me=them, them=me, and hope others feel the same. Yep, that's it.  *It makes me  reluctant;  it doesn't  stop  me. The whole purpose of a blog is personal experience. If I'm hiding my experiences, what's the point?  **Remember when Oprah was on her giant weight loss/fitness crusade? And she did shows about it, and put out a tape called Get the Picture or something like that. And a lot of people were very critical of her, saying things like "It's easy to lose weight when you have a personal trainer and a private chef." Oh, puhleeze. I don't care one way or the other about Oprah, but I'll defend her here. No matter how much money you have, no one else can do a sit-up for you. You can't hire someone to run a marathon for you, or diet for you. She did it, by herself. Same as the rest of us.

       7:48 a.m. Wednesday, Day 197. Merry Bastille Day! Yes, I am feeling MUCH better today. No wasabi peas, moderate amount of wine, lots of sleep. Also had some good news (oh finally): the TV producer called me back last night, and we will shoot on the 22nd. That's the good news, the bad news is that he wants to concentrate on the lampshades and switchplate covers that I paint, which is something I would rather bury in the ground. Ah well, it's free publicity, even though not quite the right kind.  I made an excellent no-pasta lasagne last night (recipe  urlLink here ). I am embarrassed to say I got the idea from the Dr. Phi1 show, although the recipe is my own. It was 456 calories for two large pieces, so presumably one could eat a single piece and also have a side dish for a reasonable caloric total. That is, if one had the energy to make side dishes.  4:40 p.m. Getting ready to go to Daisy's, with a big batch of catfish stew for dinner. I have had TWO naps today, and had to drink a cup of coffee about 20 minutes ago. I can think of several valid reasons for this sleepiness (too much salt recently; STRESS; took an actifed at 2:30 a.m. last night; weight lifting), but will keep an eye on it. If I'm still like this in a day or two I'll schedule a doctor visit.  By the way, my calories the past two days were in the mid 1700s. Not fabulous, but I wasn't completely destroyed by those wretched (but o so delicious) beef ribs. And today, 30 minutes of Cardio Blast. I know, only 30 minutes! They were doing some sort of kick boxing thingie, and it TOTALLY KILLED ME. 30 minutes was like 30 days. Also, they were kicking their legs just above waist level, and I was seriously kicking about three inches off the ground. Heh. It was killer and I am impressed that I managed 30 minutes!

       6:59 a.m. Tuesday, Day 196. First let me say, I am even squirrelier than yesterday. I woke up that way.  I feel moody, depressed, hopeless, etc. Also I really need to wash my hair. Just be glad you are on that side of the monitor glass, because I am no treat to be around just at this moment.  Besides all my list of woes from yesterday, I am annoyed at these beef spareribs we had for dinner. I got them at half price and was very pleased with myself, but that was before I found out the calories (after I'd eaten two.  Doh! ). It's awfully hard to figure; it seems to be anywhere from 400 calories per rib up to 1100 or so. Yeah, almost my entire day's calories in one rib!  This morning I cut the meat off one and weighed it, and it comes to only 3 ounces, so I think the calories are on the lower end of that range, but it's still way too much. Oh, I know this isn't a major big deal, I'm just in the mood to magnify any little thing into a giant tragedy.  I don't want a repeat of yesterday, so I think I need to go one of two ways: 1. buckle down and force myself to be productive, or 2. take a mental health day. At the moment I can't decide which would make me feel better.  1:47 p.m. I guess I've ended up with a combo of 1 and 2 - half productive, half hedonistic. Got a few things done around the house, took a shower and washed the hell out of my hair, and now I'm going to read a book for an hour or so. What am I reading? Currently,  urlLink The Nature of Alexander.  Also  urlLink  Hell's Angels.  I will flip a coin for which I read this afternoon.  Also, am meeting Daisy at her house tomorrow night for dinner, so having something to look forward to is improving my mood.  For those of you who read this blog (and I know SOMEONE does, because of the Sitemeter) I'm sorry I've been moody and depressing and dull. As amends, here is something amusing:   urlLink www.toxiccustard.com . It's all good, but Great Vomits of the Twentieth Century is my favorite.  LATER: Some sort-of good news: I've figured out part, if not all, of the cause of my squirreliness: wasabi peas. Too much salt and possibly too much wasabi = squirrel.

       6:41 a.m. Monday, Day 195. I feel good today  and  I slept well, which doesn't seem to occur together all that often. Totaled up my numbers for last week, and it says I lost 1.5 pounds!  O I hope so. 19 more days to the Great Measurement Shorts Try On.  I have a lot of things I should do today (doesn't that sound enthusiastic?) (not to mention, LOVE the passive language). Anyway, they are, in no particular order:  1. Search jobs 2. Call dentist about crown 3. Finish malachite sample board 4. Do other sample boards (mahogany, marble, etc.) 5. Call mortgage broker (just to see possibilities) 6. Grocery shop 7. Dick around with Dreamweaver 8. Exercise. That goes without saying.  10:02 a.m. Accomplished Item 1 (negative results), Item 3 (adequate) and Item 8 (45 minutes Cardio Blast). Just had a carrot and hummus for a snackie. Am planning on grocery shopping as soon as I stop sweating, because there is almost no food in the house, which as we all know makes me panic and want to eat a lot. Sheesh.  6:05 p.m. Well. I didn't get half of my agenda done. I got a little bogged down with depression today, and spent most of the afternoon wandering from computer to television to book and back again. I just seem to be unable to make progress — the television guy hasn't called me back (I've left two voicemails and an email), the EGarden decided my furniture is too expensive (personally, I think they're crazy, but that's another story), neither of the recruiter jobs has come through, and there's NOTHING in the want ads. I just feel stymied, and very sorry for myself, and hopeless. At the same time, I feel guilty and weak for letting it get me down, which of course makes me feel even worse... I've been pushing it away most days by telling myself that it is not  necessary  to be depressed and stressed — it won't help me find a job any faster. If I do my best to find a job during the day, then there's no reason I shouldn't relax and even enjoy myself during the rest of the time. But I almost feel like I'm not  allowed  to be worry-free, that it means I'm not serious and not trying hard enough.  Just once, I'd like to be happy during a happy time and sad during a sad time, and not keep QUESTIONING myself about whether those feelings are valid and permitted.

       7:24 a.m. Sunday, Day 194.  I've been so busy today, just haven't had time to post. I don't have anything interesting to say, so no big loss to anyone! Let's see... one of my crowns came off. Will need to visit the dentist asap. Got the paper this morning and there were NO jobs for me. I mean, NONE. Feh. Am eating quite well, I expect to be around 1100 calories at the end of today. That's about it.

       7:24 a.m. Saturday, Day 193.  I'm feeling good this morning, even though I drank more wine than was strictly necessary last night. If I drink (x) amount, it disrupts my sleep; if I drink (x+1) I sleep soundly; if I drink (x+2) I'm restless and feel awful the next day. Evidently I hit (x+1) square on the nose.  1858 calories yesterday. Not bad for Friday. The wine was about a third of that; I ate lightly. Made curried chicken salad with the low-fat mayo for dinner; Bucko had his on bread and I had mine on lettuce — I figure my whole dinner was just under 200 calories. I was trying to compensate a little because I'd eaten saltines and butter earlier in the day.  Man, saltines are salty. I can't claim that they blindsided me, though, because it says right there in the name. Anyway, I've been having a giant craving for fat. Grease, butter, oil, you name it. My calorie distribution works out to be only about 12% fat, which is quite low, so I'm wondering if my body is expressing a legitimate need for more (as opposed to a mental/emotional craving). I'm not deliberately keeping the ratio that low, it's just that fat has twice the calories of carbohydrates or protein, so when you're trying to keep the calories low you end up cutting out the fat.   I've been plateaued for such a long time that I'm eagerly awaiting any sign that I'm losing again. Really, I can't even say it was a plateau, because definitely it was self-induced, but you know what I mean. I'm setting July 31 as the next trying-on of the Measurement Shorts, to see if progress has occurred.   Anyway, today I'm thinking about how far I've come, and I realize that it was all worth it. It's been just over 6 months, and I've lost about 40 pounds. If I never lose another pound, it's been worth it, even the bad days, and it's worth maintaining the diet/exercise to keep that 40 pounds off — my life has changed significantly just from that amount. Here are some of the differences between now and then:   I can pick up things that fall on the floor.   I can wear shorts somewhat gracefully.   I can reach my own butt (not pretty, but someone has to admit it).   I don't have to slide the car seat backward to get out.   I can squat. I can tie my shoes. I can cut my toenails.   Snoring greatly diminished.   I fit into restaurant booths.   My heels don't hurt in the morning.   There are also some psychological differences, that have to do with me feeling more confident and less of a freak (yes, let me disclaim right away that I wish I would feel like that regardless of my weight!). I went to a fast-food driveup window by myself for the first time in my life. Yep, 43 years old, NEVER gone to a driveup window alone. Too self-conscious. I don't hide from the camera now. As agonizing as it is for me, now I am able to walk into stores and try to sell them my stuff.   I know I've mentioned the positive body image websites once in a while, but I will plug them again now. The general message is: you are a valid, legitimate person, regardless of your weight. Live your life now, don't delay your goals until you're the "right" weight. I guess some people who subscribe to these ideas also do  not  subscribe to the idea of diet/exercise for the purpose of weight loss. Which is fine; I think that's a perfectly logical conclusion and a valid point of view. Think how much time and energy we would have available to DO things if we weren't focusing our lives on our bodies.* I went through a couple years of not trying to lose weight, and although this sounds contradictory, it's part of what finally gave me the strong base from which to make an effective attempt. Although I do have my bad days and moments of self-loathing, the PBI tenets help keep them at a minimum, and remove a lot of the frustration, desperation, and anger that have fueled previous weight loss attempts. I'm a lot calmer about it this time, and (I think) I'm approaching it more reasonably and sanely. I'm dedicated to losing weight, I WANT it, but I'm also not torturing myself over failures and setbacks. I feel like, I'm going to be doing this (this=eating well and exercising) for the rest of my life, there's not really a time limit on when I lose this particular 5 pounds, now or two months from now. Sure, my preference would be to smack myself upside the head with a magic wand and lose it all right now (WHUMP! SPLAT! EW!), but PBI helps me to keep going even when that doesn't magically happen.  *I am SO not trying to discourage anyone from trying to lose weight. One of my reasons for trying to lose is that I believe I will be able to do MORE things, to accomplish more, if I feel strong and good about my body.  Here are some of my favorite sites:  urlLink Body Positive   urlLink Mary Mc's Fat Acceptance Stuff   urlLink Lynne Murray (author)   urlLink Radiance Magazine  Sadly the print version of this mag is no more, but read their article archives.

       6:26 a.m. Friday, Day 192. I am STARVING this morning. Only 1281 calories yesterday, that probably explains it. I needed that to balance out Wednesday. Somewhere I found a recipe for wasabi tuna, and I also use it for salmon. You marinate the fish in soy sauce and sesame oil for one hour (no more, or it gets too salty), crust it with sesame seeds, and pan fry or bake. The extra delicious part is the wasabi mayonnaise served with it: mix up some wasabi (or buy already mixed) and stir it into low-fat mayo. Use your own taste for proportions. I've tried mixing the wasabi powder right into the mayo, but for some reason it comes out bitter.  Not sure what I'm going to do today. Call the TV guy for sure. It's been a week, so I don't think it will be pushy to contact him again. I have another sample board I should do (burr walnut). I don't know what else. I already searched Monster and several local job boards. Found one little job and applied for it. I'm thinking about going down to the busy intersection and standing there with a sign that says "will work for salary and benefits."  Yesterday I shopped at the FooDog (aka Food Lion) because it is generally the cheapest grocery store. I bought the FooDog brand Flavored Sparkling Water Beverage. Gaaah!  It's sweetened with Splenda, and is massively OVERsweetened. It's nasty. I bought 3 liters of the darned stuff. Thankfully only 50 cents a liter, but still...  10:08 a.m. 60 minutes of Cardio Blast. Yeah, I feel blasted. I'm glad I found that show - I need to do more strength training, and have been unmotivated when it comes to using the SensibleGym.  I need someone to tell me what to do. When I'm left to my own devices with exercise, I tend to slack off and not work hard enough.  It's that holding your hand over the flame experience, or maybe it's inertia. At any rate, I don't exert myself hard enough without a metronome of some kind.  4:51 p.m. Haven't accomplished much this afternoon, but I did get a really nice burr walnut sample board. I will accept that as a Good Sign.

       6:19 a.m. Thursday, Day 191.  Another good night's sleep, yet I feel so-so. Bucko believes there is a pollen abroad that is making me feel crappy. Could be.  I am determined to pull myself up by my bootstraps, emotionally, today. No more whining and crying. Today I will be energetic and constructive. You can't tell of course, but I am typing that to myself in a very stern tone.   1767 calories yesterday. It's within my range but it's not great, for so early in the week. I would have been okay, but then in the evening I just HAD to have a slice of bread with peanut butter. VERY unusual for me. I kept the peanut butter down to a thin layer, and I can report that works very well. It doesn't have to be a giant heap to be satisfying.  Unrelated anecdote: Whenever I wash my hair, I spend the whole day picking up loose hairs from my clothes, the floor, the desk, the kitchen counters, the grilled chicken salad, etc. I don't know why this happens. I mean, I know hair falls out regularly and grows back - my hair is as thick as ever, I'm not losing more than I replace. So what's the deal? I guess shampooing loosens up a bunch of it at once. At any rate, it's become a major annoyance. I'm going to start wearing a hair net or something, because it is SO gross to pull a big old hair out of a salad. Especially when it breaks off when you tug on it, and you know there's another several inches still lurking in the lettuce. Yesterday I pulled out a hair that just went on and on, so I decided to measure it. How long? 29 inches. I'm 63 inches tall, so that's 46% of my body length!  I think it's time for a haircut before I start to look freakish.  8:18 a.m. So here's my plan for today: 1. Job looking (done). Yes, that was fast, but it doesn't take long to read one page of classifieds. 2. Exercise. Waiting until 9:00 for Cardio Blast. 3. Contact another trendy home furnishings store I found. I think I will mail them a little package of photos of my work. 4. Attempt the malachite sample board again. At least I know where I went wrong yesterday.  5. Perhaps grocery shop. I'm afraid to spend money, but we do have to eat, right? Also visit PO Box. 6. Call the unemployment office and try to talk sense into them.  10:46 a.m. Cardio Blast was, unfortunately, step aerobics. So I did a Sweating to the Oldies tape. That's fine, I got a reasonable workout and it gives me another day for my arm and back muscles to rest. Wrote my letter to the trendy home store and put it in the mail. Sent an updated resume to the two recruiters I've been dealing with. So even if the rest of my day goes completely to hell, I've accomplished  something.  I will try REALLY hard not to freak out today. Yesterday sucked, and I don't want to repeat it.  3:47 p.m. I've done everything on my list. Can I relax now? Yes, I can. I'm a little higher on calories (648) than I want to be at this time of day, so I will curtail any afternoon snack. No problem, I'm not hungry. I had salmon for lunch (on $ale), and it was delicious. Not sure what I'm making for dinner. Maybe cauliflower and chicken.  I haven't freaked out today, so that's good. The malachite didn't go as well as I'd hoped; good thing I'm working out the bugs now instead of on a customer. The problem is I don't do this often enough; after I've worked out a really good technique I sometimes forget what I've done because it's been so long. I do keep notes, but there is a certain amount of on-the-spot mental and physical effort that can't really be transcribed into how-to language. On a positive note, I'm almost through my third week of daily exercise! (I consider daily exercise to be M-F, a little disclaimer there...). It's been hard to get back into the groove of it, so I'm patting myself on the back.  Another unrelated thought: whenever I see rodeo on television (ESPN, Outdoor Channel, Spike), I always call it The Gay Rodeo. Oh look, The Gay Rodeo is on. There's something about rodeos that strikes me as very... gay. Maybe it's the chaps.

       7:05 a.m. Wednesday, Day 190.  Wow, almost up to Day 200. Is that any kind of landmark?  Got a lot of sleep but still feel kind of groggy this morning. Overall not very chipper, slight headache. There is simply no justice in the universe - I ate nothing weird yesterday, didn't drink any alcohol, and got a lot of sleep. I should feel GREAT today, not half-assed. I wish I knew who to sue.  10:32 a.m. Did 30 minutes cardio. Kind of lame, but it's all I could manage. I watched Cardio Blast, but my muscles are too sore to do it today - I need a rest day. So I did step while I watched other people exercise. Searched for jobs with no result. Posted my resume on Monster and CareerBuilder. Haven't heard back about those state jobs. They move glacially, so I might get an offer four months from now when I (hopefully) have another job.  2:20 p.m. I am REALLY depressed today. Nothing seems to be going well. The TV guy hasn't called me back. I've left him a voice mail and an email, so I don't want to  stalk  him. There's being proactive and there's being a giant pest, and I want to stay on the right side of that comparison. In the same vein, the E.Garden isn't calling me back about my furniture. My malachite sample board went to complete hell, and I have to redo it, which means several hours drying time before the next board is ready to work on. The job search is worrisome. I'm not getting anywhere, and running out of money fast. The employment situation around here is bad - I can't even get temp agencies to talk to me. I'm starting to freak out: what am I going to do in approximately 4 weeks when there is no money to pay bills or buy food? No really, what do I do? Apply for welfare? Call the bank and say Sorry, won't be paying my mortgage anymore? I'm at a loss.  Well, I know that's all loser talk, but I need to vent it. I'm scared shitless and don't have any ideas to fix the situation. This is the point in the movie where the brave heroine, on her last crust of bread, is discovered by a wealthy movie producer who hires her to star in a big picture. Where, with one can of soup left in the cupboard, a painting finally sells. A gangster drops a briefcase of money in front of her. SOMETHING.  Something  is supposed to happen now, dammit. This is NOT supposed to be the kind of movie where the heroine goes broke, loses her house, lives in her car, and ends up murdered by car jackers.  Here's a sort of funny(not) story about my brother. We were talking the other day on the phone, about how we were so poor when we were starting out. We all three (I had another brother) started adult life with  no  financial help from our parents. We all three moved out as soon as we turned 18, and naturally we had nothing. So I was telling Jimmy how poor Bucko and I were, our jobs were so low-paying, rent was so high, we used to eat potatoes - literally, nothing but potatoes and ramen - for weeks at a time. We slept on the floor of our apartment, because we couldn't afford a mattress, let alone a bed to put it on. Anyway, you get the drift. Boo-hoo. So then poor little Jimmy starts talking about when he was 19 or 20, and it gets to be like one of those "How poor were you...?" jokes. He couldn't even afford the potatoes; he was eating at a church charity kitchen. One time he was so destitute and starving, there was a whole week where he had to skip out on his lunch hour from work, and go up Boulder Canyon and FISH IN THE STREAM FOR FOOD. Not for recreation, for FOOD.  Now that's just bad. And I guess that's what I'm afraid of right now. I don't think I can handle that kind of life anymore. It's bad enough thing when you're young and strong, but I feel like that would just destroy me now. I know I'm being incredibly pessimistic here, but the story doesn't always have a happy ending. There's no guarantee that this one will, and I'm scared right down to my bones. Oh, I hope I'm going to have a better outlook tomorrow. I will write happier things, or at least weight-loss related things, tomorrow. I promise.  Completely unrelated thought, but happy (OH AT LAST MARLA): When it snows, I wish so much I could fly, because I would like to fly to the top of the very tall pine trees in our backyard, and lick the cold cold piney-minty snow off the needles. Wouldn't that be refreshing?

       6:37 a.m. Tuesday, Day 189. Feeling pretty good, but definitely some reaction to the intense weight lifting yesterday. I may have to glide today, something that's mostly lower body, instead of doing Cardio Blast. We'll see, maybe they alternate the programs in a sensible way. Slept well, woke up only once. I think I got about eight and a half hours sleep.  Haven't even thought about what I'm going to do today, first day back after the three-day weekend. Exercise, of course. And maybe the guy from the TV station will call me. I have a loose script put together, but don't want to go too far with that until I talk with him. Of course job-looking, but the want ads were pretty slim pickins this week.  7:58 a.m. I have made a mid-year resolution for myself, which is to not criticize or complain about things that don't affect me. Things that are none of my business. Things that, if you don't like them, you just don't DO them/go there/watch them. You know I'm going to break this resolution a billion times, but I'm at least going to attempt it. It's just too easy to mock things, to tear things down, and it's to no purpose. This doesn't mean I will lose all power of discrimination - being human means the ability to like and dislike, to apply tests, to make judgments, and I will continue to think that way and write about it. I just mean I want to stop  making fun of  people who aren't doing any harm. We'll see how long that lasts...  10:09 a.m. I was able to do Cardio Blast - today was legs and shoulders. I'm exhausted but feel good, same as yesterday. AND I did 10 minutes of aerobics beforehand, so that means 80 minutes of exercise today.   I RULE.   4:55 p.m. So here's what I did today: 1. Looked for a job. 2. Exercised. 3. Finished Dreamweaver tutorial. 4. Ate lunch. 5. Surfed and blogged. 6. Did base coats for a couple sample boards. 7. Drew a picture of a shoe. Does that sound like a nice day, or kind of pitiful? Not sure.

       6:29 a.m. Monday, Day 188. I'm up too early, as usual. Woke up at 5:30, which still gives me a couple more hours sleep than I normally get, so I really should feel better than I do. I think I'm a little dehydrated.  Last week was excellent. I have racked up two good weeks in a row, i.e., I exercised  every  day, and stayed within my one pound per week (oppw) caloric range. I calculate I lost 2.25 pounds for that period. I feel like I'm back on track and remotivated. I'm not sure what to credit, but I think re-reading my journal was helpful.   Had a fantastic dinner last night: lettuce wraps. I sliced up cucumber, carrots, zucchini, and onion. Also had bean sprouts and shrimp. Then we put a spices, soy sauce, sesame oil, lemon juice, etc., on the table, and built our wraps from this little buffet. It was SO good. A perfect Sunday supper, because I was able to sit around and chop up vegetables, which is rather time consuming. That is something I will point out again, that the success I've had so far (-40 lbs) is largely due to having the TIME to exercise, shop, and prepare food. I am somewhat concerned about how I will cope if/when I have a job again. Guess I'll be buying those wretched Smart Ones frozen dinners.  I will try to do Cardio Blast this morning. One day last week they were doing "Rhythmic Step," which is that hateful mambo-cha-cha crap. What a disappointment. I know some people like that stuff, probably a LOT of people like it since it's so prevalent, but I hate it. I want to  exercise,  not stand around confused trying to figure out the steps. Of course she's been completely discredited now, but Susan P0wter said something in her Stop the Madness book that really struck me, about aerobics instructors being frustrated Broadway dancers. It was catty but oh so true. On a completely unrelated, non-weight-loss note, there is a writer named  urlLink Susan Power,  no "t", who is really good and I am waiting impatiently until her next book is in paperback. Anyway, back on subject: that's what I like about the Richard Simmons videos, the steps are not complicated, and they are in cycles of eight repetitions, four reps, single reps. The mambo school of exercise is, in my opinion, dangerous. There is not enough repetition, the steps are sometimes done only once, so that you are constantly changing position and footing, while prancing around on a step, and in my world that's inviting a twisted ankle or worse.  10:09 a.m. Did ONE HOUR of cardio blast! Whoo-hoo!  It was mostly weights, for chest and back. I did cardio during the commercials and during the couple exercises that I cannot do AT ALL. Like the supine plank. Yeah, right, I can barely do a regular plank for two seconds. But that's okay, little steps, little steps. I feel great, nice and warmed up and tired but happily so.  5:45 p.m. A good day, calorie-wise. I'm at 1346 after dinner. We ate pretty early, so I suspect I might want a little snackie later, but I can keep it reasonable. I hope this will be three good weeks in a row.  7:38 p.m. Had a little snackie, but it was celery. A negative calorie food, as it's called. Apparently you burn more calories chewing it than you take in. I'm having that can't-eat-enough feeling, so I'm taking my own advice and writing in my journal to focus on  losing  weight, not on eating. I'm not sure that makes sense, but it's working for me.

       6:29 a.m. Sunday, Day 187.  I almost slept through the whole night!  I'm up early, but still I must have gotten eight hours sleep. I'm surprised, after eating and drinking such variety yesterday. A lot more sugar than I usually have.

       7:36 a.m. Saturday, Day 186.  Feel okay today. I was awake from 4:30 to 5:30, but that's late enough in the night that I got most of my sleep undisturbed. A little on the high side yesterday - 1835 calories - which is typical of Friday. Not to worry. I did glide for 30 minutes after that last entry. It was hellish, but I was glad I did it.  Brunch this morning with Daisy. I'm making devilled eggs, which Bucko ADORES, and also scrambled. We have some steamed shrimp. Locally-made sausage. Tomatoes and coffee cake. She's bringing bread, fruit, and Mimosas. So I'm thinking today will be on the high side, also. The beginning of the week I was so low I should still come out within range.

       6:17 a.m. Friday, Day 185.  Feeling a bit SLOW today. Had martinis last night, which of course led to disrupted sleep. Q: When will I learn? A: Never.  An interesting thing happened this morning. I got an email from a producer at the local CNN affiliate, and he produces a segment called At Home, which covers "from crafts to table decorating." He wants to know if I am interested in being on it. Duh Wilbur!  Hell yeah I want to be on it! I just taped and watched the Friday segment at 8:45, which was indeed about table decorating. It was three minutes long, in the "how to" format. I have NO IDEA what I could show people how to do. Something, anything, whatever, I'll think of something!  So that's my number one priority today, call this guy back. I'm moving exercise to number 2 only because I am too frail to do it this morning. It will have to be after several hours of drinking water and possibly a nap. We are having a little brunch with Daisy tomorrow around 11:00. If it's cool enough, we can sit on the new deck. So I will be shopping today also. And I want to update my [decorative painting] web page a little, especially the "About" part. In anticipation of the millions of people who will visit after my very special TV segment airs. That's all I have planned.   5:03 p.m. Guess who hasn't exercised yet. Oh, it's no fun guessing, you know it's me. I'm going to do it right now. I will glide while the chicken is cooking. Update on TV thing: Called the guy, got his machine, left message. He's probably taken the day off for a four-day weekend. I'm so excited. I forwarded his email to Daisy immediately, and she said "You know this completely blows your theory." My theory being that because I am so introverted I never go out of the house and thus never meet anyone or make any contacts or find any opportunities. I always say "Nobody is going to come banging on my door looking for me and dragging me into the limelight."  Apparently I was wrong.

       6:17 a.m. Thursday, Day 184. Feeling okay, neither up nor down. Slept reasonably well — I did wake up around 3:30 and had somewhat broken sleep after that, but not major. So... I feel okay. Had a nice dream about whales flying, and Godzilla coming to wreck a small seaside town, and everyone meeting at a restaurant that had awesome clam chowder to discuss what to do. It was cozy.  1291 calories yesterday. Whooee. That's just under the low end of my range (1300-1800 per day). I didn't go that low on purpose, it just ended up that way. Which is fine, because you know on Friday I'll be way over the top end.  I use a daily caloric goal as a yardstick, but I figure my progress on a weekly basis (9,100 and 12,000). I think that's a more realistic and accurate unit of time — what I eat for one meal, or even one day, is not significant. It's what I'm eating over the period of seven days, or even two or three weeks that matters. That's the weird Catch 22 about dieting, psychologically. You know one meal doesn't make or break the diet, but those one meals all add up to your pattern over the week or the month. That's how you (I) become fanatic about dieting: keeping those "exceptions" under control, making sure they don't become the norm. It's easy to freak over one incident, because you're on such a tightrope. You're not supposed to obsess about food, that's bad, versus you're supposed to count all your food and keep a detailed food diary, that's good. Huh? Run that by me again?  Speaking of food diaries, I don't put my food online for two reasons: 1. I'm lazy. In fact, I'm too lazy to come up with a second reason. But I find it useful once in a while to see what other people are eating. It gives me ideas. So here, just for kicks, is the record of what I ate on Monday, June 28, with calories in parens:*     1 cup coffee with sugar, creamer, and Benefiber (38); half a can of Southwestern Chicken soup (120); / Healthy Choice salisbury steak entree (360); slice of fresh pineapple and some celery (40); / homemade vegetable pasta salad with parmesan cheese (445); lettuce and red pepper salad with oil and vinegar dressing (90); 1 glass wine (90); / half a cup of frozen raspberries (66). = 1249.  The slashes indicate breaks, or meals, or however you want to define it. One reason I'm getting away with such low calories for so much food is the proportion of ingredients. For instance, the vegetable pasta salad is 90% vegetables and 10% pasta. The oil and vinegar dressing is mostly vinegar. Here is what I ate on a higher calorie day, Friday June 25:     1 cup coffee with sugar, creamer, and Benefiber (38); 1 cup red grapes (110); lettuce and red pepper salad with oil and vinegar dressing (90); / half ounce cheese (86); 1 carrot (30); / 2 eggs (150); ground turkey (193); 1 cup red grapes (110); / 1 martini (240); salad with meat and oil and vinegar dressing (350); / half ounce cheese (86); 3 glasses wine [18 oz] (360) = 1843.  That last was during  urlLink Hungry Hormone Hippo  week.  I felt like I could NOT STOP eating, but in retrospect, it's not that bad. 1843 calories is not a huge amount of food. While I was looking back for examples of a high calorie day, I saw two situations in which I go way over my range (like 2400 calories): 1. When I have something other than soup for breakfast. It's hard to beat 120 calories and still eat something satisfying, so when I try something else I inevitably end up with a couple hundred calories added on before I've hardly started the day, plus I am still hungry, which leads to more eating. 2. Large drinking and/or eating in restaurants.  *Yep, here's that footnote, at last. The way I figure calories is thus: if there is nutritional info on the package, I use that. If there isn't, I use Netzer's "The Complete Book of Food Counts."  If that is inadequate (it's sometimes confusing) I use  urlLink this website.
