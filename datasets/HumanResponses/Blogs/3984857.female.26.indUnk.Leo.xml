       It's the first time that I came across this song,&nbsp;&nbsp;there was a time in my life that i could have moped around with this song in the background.&nbsp; But not anymore,&nbsp; i've come to accept that fact that there are certain things that we just can't have.&nbsp; We may not like it but we just gotta live with it.&nbsp; Gone were the days when I'd ask myself,&nbsp; was it my fault? Should I have done something? Should I have said something?&nbsp; Maybe...but I know deep down, even if I did.&nbsp; It wouldn't have changed anything. &nbsp; Still,when I hear these kind of songs...             "I had no right bringing you here. Knowing what i know, feeling the way I feel I had no right being so uncontent, Being so confused, Being so not for you "

       urlLink    i have been reading this book (veronika decides to die) for a few days now, i'm not even half way done. But reading this line did strike me. we've heard this a couple of times before. but with all the things that's been going on my mind this past few days, one might say that this thought, that nothing happens by chance, is the only thing that makes it a little easier for me to accept certain facts of life. Can't really do anything about it, can't question it either. i'm a firm believer in destiny, one of the last few souls left. I believe that in time, we'll understand why certain things happen. In time, we'll just say.."aah..now i get it." i'm still waiting for that day...  just wondrin'

        when we two parted it was just like a breeze     As swift as the wind it happened, as cold as the night it came     When we two parted I was broken     As the mist from heaven touched my cheeks     And I watched you walk away from my side     When we two parted you never said goodbye     You simply moved on and left me behind     When we two parted it was without warning     In the darkest time of my life you left me standing          Now as I listened to your words without feeling     Again you break my heart without you knowing     Now as you laugh, as you smile, I could just die     Knowing it never mattered to you that I cried     Now you tell that nothing has changed     But as I look into your eyes...I know it has     Now when I close my eyes, I can't help but imagine what used to be there          Strangers now we are indeed, never thought it would come to this     And it just hurts me that you took it all so easily     That as I think of what is of us then, it was nothing to you until the end      When we two parted we never said goodbye     Now, I wish we did so at least I could look at you and smile     Cause when we two parted I couldn't even do that     I truly held on to the lie that you'd come back          But you never did...                  note:    inspired by Lord Byron's When We Two Parted
