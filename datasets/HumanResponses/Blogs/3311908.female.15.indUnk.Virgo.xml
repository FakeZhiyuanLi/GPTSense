      My parents just got a phone call from mr. bryant telling us that mrs. janice has past away. The bryants are VERY close family friends of ours...her son was in my brothers wedding, kelli babysat me...they are just an awesome family...mrs. janice has been suffering with cancer for a very long time and today at 5:00 she just couldn't make it anymore. I know that God has taken her when He thought the time was right...but it's hard. It really makes you think. We should be thankful for ANYTHING God has given us and live life to the fullest...Anyone who reads this please say a little prayer for the Bryant family..they need it!..
