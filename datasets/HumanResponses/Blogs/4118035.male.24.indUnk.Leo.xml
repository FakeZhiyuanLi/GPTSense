      Last night I went and saw the first movie I've seen in about 5-6 months.  Since I'm so cheap it probably was the fact that movies are free here on CBS that I even went.  As I was sitting there watching Shrek 2 I lost the reality of my surroundings.  I felt as if I had a youth group sitting around me.  At first I was happy with the warmth of the thought, but then it made me sad and I realized how much I do miss all of the youth that I've come in contact with during the past 4 years.  To all of the youth around Fairless, I'm thinking of you.  To all of the youth at Stonybrook UMC, I'm thinking of you.  May God be blessing each of your lives and calling out to you to join Him in everlasting joy and freedom that only comes from knowing Jesus Christ personally in your life.  I'll be praying that someday our paths may cross again.  If not, then know that I'll be out there praying for you and smiling as I remember you.

      I have arrived here safe in Kosovo, yet that's a very ironic statement.  How safe can one be in a country that isn't safe from itself?  Most of it's struggles and strifes are from within.  As usual with the military, it was very interesting getting here.  I was supposed to leave very late at night and that got bumped at the last minute to later that morning.  Then we boarded the bus and unboarded a few times, took a few breaks, tried to board the bus again, and finally left to sit/stand at an airport in Germany until finally we started to load the plane.   By load the plane I don't necessarily mean people getting on the plane, I mean I literally had to load the plane.  I happened to be put in charge of a 15 person baggade detail.  Yeppers we got to take all the duffels and ruck sacks for over a hundred people and load them into the bottom of a plane.  Not only did we get to load them but when it was all over we even got to unload them.  That's the joys and perks of being in the army.  When have you ever been on a flight that you got to put you own luggage on and take it off to insure it went with you?  That's what I thought.  You haven't done that before have you...  Well not in a big commercial plane at least...  Once we finally got into the plane we sat for awhile longer.  Turns out the plane's scheduled time to depart was still 30 minutes away.   Flying from Germany to Kosovo was quite a site though.  I only wish it had been clearer as occasionally poking through the clouds you could see mountains below.  It was still quite beautiful the way it was.  Some simple things (or not so simple) never seem to stop amazing me.  As we were above the clouds I couldn't help but to just stare at the clouds.  How can anyone believe this all happened through evolution and/or the big bang theory?  Even something like a cloud is so absolutely amazing to me.  God created all of this is my only solution.  Just take a look at the creation around you and tell me how you can come up with any other solution?  Flying into Kosovo reminded me much of flying into Tegucigalpa, Honduras.  We had to fly all the way around the airport and then come back in from the South and we flew between moutains and hills all around us weaving from one side to the other to get around them and line up for the landing strip.  The whole airport terminal was probably the size of an olympic swimming pool and that was it.  We never went in it though as we unloaded (both baggage and personnel but you probably caught that pun this time) and went straight to the buses.  We had a little over an hour bus ride to get to Camp Bondsteel otherwise referred to as CBS.  The bus trip in was great to get to finally see the countryside that I've seen so many pictures of.  It was exactly as I expected it to be yet I was totally glued to the window wanting to soak it all in.  My experiences in other countries had prepared me for what to expect and see yet I believe I look at the world through a different perspective.  As the devotional said a few weeks ago about wanting to see the world through the lens of God's eyes and perspective.  Here is a countryside full of unfinished houses, or are they finished?  Many homes have been partially built and have stood for a long time untouched.  Money may have run out or the families mave have been chased out or moved away.  Families live in the first stories of homes where the second or third story is unfinished.  No windows and sometimes still no roof.  As we pass through you see the candle lights and lanterns in some of those first floor windows.  Many homes were unlit or lit only by the dimness of those small flames.  Then you would come across an extravagant home all lit up with plenty of lights on the outside shining for the world to see.  Right next door to it is that common unfinished or damaged home that sits there uninhabited.  I'm sure they have their different neighborhoods of monetary influence, but from what I saw it all blended together.  One home sits next to another with no similarities.  What fascinates me most about any other country and culture is the people and how they live.  I love to just see people interacting with people.  I love to see where they live and how it is that they live.  I'm sure I must be perceived as an annoying tourist because I do nothing but stare intently and look around trying to observe people.  I only wish that I my duty position would involve interacting more with the local population.  I will be blessed if I get to leave CBS at all.  It will most likely not be because of my duty position because my job is established and functions solely here on camp inside the wire.  I've decided that if I do get a day off, I'm going to do my best to hook up with someone or a squad that is going outside the wire to be able to experience better what it's like for them and for the people of Kosovo.  In fact I truly hope that while I'm here, I can figure out how to interact and help out a local school or orphanage.  I've got some homework to do to figure that one out.  I only wish the bus ride in could have been done in a little more daylight to have been able to observe even more.  We arrived safely inside the wire and have been moving in to our new homes for the next 6 months to 1 year and 6 months.  Only time will tell how long it truly will be as well as how things play out...  Until then, I'm here, safe in Kosovo.

      In case you didn't get to see my picture when it was there, it's back! I made some changes and forgot that it would affect my picture. Whoops!  Now, usually I really don't like pictures of myself. In fact I don't like to be in people's pictures. But you have to admit that's a pretty darn good picture of me there?!?!?! Right? I mean it's not like I'm thinking highly of myself here. Just out of all the pictures I've seen of myself, it's a good one that even I half-like. At least it should get a good smile out of everyone so for that reason alone I don't mind sharing it.  Not much longer here and then I'll be in Kosovo. I'm ready to be there and start settling in and learning how we will be operating and working. Please keep the transition in your prayers. Most of the true hard work is now out of the way. That is as long as things stay calm throughout the region there. Keep us all in your prayers as well as soldiers everywhere tonight.  God loves all of us more then we will ever fathom.

      SPC Mackey just informed me of another quote that I should add to my quote's list that I frequently say.  "No thanks, I have to drive."  Most of you have heard me say that on rare occasions... :)

      Are you having a tough time? Let me share with you again another devotion from "Five Meaningful Minutes A Day" by Charles R. Swindoll:  "I have found great help from two truths God gave me at a time in my life when I was bombarded with a series of unexpected and unfair blows (from my perspective). First,  nothing touches me that has not passed through the hands of my heavenly Father.  Second,  everything I endure is designed to prepare me for serving others more effectively.   'Momentary, light affliction is producing for us an enternal weight of glory.' - 2 Corinthians 4:17"  If you get a chance, read the scripture of the devotional for the day too. 2 Corinthians 4  May you have as blessed of an evening as I'm going to have thanks to Jesus Christ our Lord!

      Wanted to share with you the below letter that I just sent home. It captures some great thoughts and really sums up how I am right now.  Hey Mom and Dad,  Well my shift hasn't started yet, but I know tonight is going to be a good night. Please keep your prayer candle light well into your evening which should be just about when the insaneness of my shift is winding down. Usually around 2-3AM here is when things settle down and then around 5:30-6AM they are back at it. So when I get on at 7PM it's crazy until then. Keep your candle lit till late when you go to bed and I should be covered!  Tonight is going to be a good night though. I've badly slacked of on two things that have been greatly affecting me. One is not doing much PT (Physical Training) since we've been here. More important though is I haven't spent my time daily in my devotions and in God's word. Today I finally have had enough. I scolded myself and sat down and spent some good time. I've got a great devotion that I copied down onto an index card to carry around with me right now too. Listen to this...  "I have two enduring goals in life. First, and foremost, I desire to learn how to think biblically. I want to see life through the lens of God's eyes. I don't want to argue with Him, I don't want to fight Him, I don't even need to understand Him, but I desperately desire to obey Him. And so I want to see life, whether it be struggle or joy, through God's perspective. And coming in a close second, I want to encourage other people to do the same thing." [taken from Five Meaningful Minutes a Day by Charles R. Swindoll] Pretty powerful huh? Even more effective when I have been arguing with people, I have been fighting, and I have been asking to understand because I don't. But God is in everyone. Just like in Matthew where Jesus talkes about the sheep and the goats. "Whatever you do unto the least of these brothers of mine you've done unto me." This is my fight for the night. A new fight. No longer will I try to be fighting or arguing or understanding, I will just work on desperately desiring to obey Him.  There's even more though. What's funny and ironic about my outlook on tonight of all nights is that tonight is supposed to be worse then any other night we've had. Yet I know that if I listen to the verse that was also with the devotional it will all be good.  "Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfector of faith." - Hebrews 12:2  Love you greatly, David

       "You're only bored if you let yourself be bored."      "I prefer to think that I'm the only sane person in the world and everyone else is insane."      "Everybody loves a bouncy ball!"      "Always think the best of everyone, no matter what."    "Yes." "Exactly." "Great!" "Wondermosa!" "Superb!" "Beautimus!" (If you've heard me do this, then you know what I mean.)      "Greater love has no one than this that he lay down his life for his friends."  - Jesus Christ

      Welcome everyone. I've been thinking about this for awhile and finally have decided to go with it. Now we will see if I can keep up with it.  This will be my piece of sanity in this insane world.
