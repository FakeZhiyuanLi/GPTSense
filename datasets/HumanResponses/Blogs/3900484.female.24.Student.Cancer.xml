      I feel like I ate enough for 2 of me today. Even 3 of me. I had both lunch and dinner out, with one of my sisters and separately with my parents. UGH I can't move now. My fortune from dinner says "your example will inspire others". I want to know how exactly that is a fortune. I mean, when did they stop with the actual fortunes and start with the cryptic messages? I wanted something like, "You will be very lucky tomorrow", or "That one thing you really wish for will occur within a week", or I would even settle for "You will meet a very handsome man and have fabulous sex". That's seriously not too much to ask for, right? I also got judged for my naughty behavior/attitude today. Sorta pissed me off.  I may have been acting like a petulant child, but I feel I have right to act that way when I want to. Especially after the past year or so. I've become a lot more involved with my mother because she is disabled and is losing the ability to do a lot of day to day tasks, like paying bills and other stuff that needs to be done. My computer is doing funny things, the font keeps changing size. ARGH stop. So anyway, I am not having a happy day. The only thing that really helped was the idea that I get to go buy a new shirt to wear with my khakis for my meeting (had to throw that in, still very excited). Oh plus I was going to clean tonight. In case anyone exciting gets to see my house anytime soon. (ie. the handsome man with the fabulous sex? I'm waiting...)

      Im awful.  This is my 4th post today.  And looking back over them...do I sound like I belong in a sorority?  Honestly.  I don't think I've ever sounded as girly as I do on this thing.  I should talk about volunteering more.  And the snakes and junk.  Machoness.  Right now I stink.  Is that macho? I just got done with my evening run, which I think could have been a little longer...but, oh well.  So now I smell.  In fact, I should maybe take a shower.  STOP FANTASIZING ABOUT ME!!  Im a sweaty stinky girl and I don't want you thinking about me in that way. I apologize.  I just always wanted to say that.  So I can live with just typing it.  2 things kept running through my head as I was running tonight.  I'll share one with you.  I think I have magical powers.  See, our ice machine at work has been leaking, and today it stopped, while I was opening the shop.  So I figure, it must have been my magic.  Working without me knowing.  Oh Oh and then, the email that I received from the prof.  I got that right as I was thinking about sending another email.  So again.  Magic.  OH and my zoo person emailing me back...I am so good that I do this stuff with out even knowing it.  Now I just have to decide whether to use my powers for good or evil.  I call a vote.  With my one reader...

      Regardless of what you may think, my title is my scream of joy.&nbsp; I just logged into my school account to try and do another email, because it's been about a week.&nbsp;&nbsp;(and at the urging of my reader, that's singular&nbsp;since I think there's only one of you out there...) &nbsp;Lo and behold...to my surprise, there was an email awaiting me, from the prof.&nbsp; My prof.&nbsp; That's possessive, huh?&nbsp; I am excited.&nbsp; Very Very Very  EXCITED .&nbsp; This means a road trip for me next weekend, and a break from Kansas.&nbsp; Yippee!&nbsp; I am planning an afternoon meeting with him, and then I think im going to stay overnight in Omaha.&nbsp; See the town a little.&nbsp; I must admit that I'm not very adventerous when Im on my own in new places, but at least I've been there once before.&nbsp; I may just be my big geeky self and spend all day Friday at the Omaha Zoo.&nbsp; Last time I was there we rushed through it.&nbsp; Way too fast.&nbsp; Oh yeah!&nbsp; Now I just need to reread all of the articles so that I have something to talk about with him and so that he doesn't think im not qualified to work with him. My Bio advisor said he (the professor I want to&nbsp;work with)&nbsp;has a big ego.&nbsp; I think he was just trying to freak me out, but he said he was an alpha male type.&nbsp; I can deal with non-human alpha males.&nbsp; He also said that "You don't have to like the professors you work with in graduate school."&nbsp; I was thinking, come on Dr. M.&nbsp; Find some more good stuff to scare me with. Anyhow, YAY!

      Ok.&nbsp; Friendly mood this week, huh?&nbsp; But honestly.&nbsp; All I know is, I was sound asleep and dreaming at about 1-ish last night.&nbsp; Until I dreamt I was hearing screaming and flashing lights.&nbsp; I think the flashing light thing was someone pulling into my driveway.&nbsp; I don't know about the whole screaming thing, but I do know my neighbors were outside smoking when I motivated out of bed to check on what the heck was going on.&nbsp; I swear they never sleep.&nbsp; Someone told me they got home at about 3am once, and he (neighbor guy) was out working in his garage.&nbsp; Working.&nbsp; At 3 in the morning.&nbsp; I am so in need of sleep that I didn't even curse at them this morning.&nbsp; Trust me, they would have deserved it.  Oh and new developments.&nbsp; I wrote ZB a quick email to say hi and sorry I haven't seen him around much and have a nice rest of the summer (a generally friendly email).&nbsp; And he wrote me back.&nbsp; Something like INSTANTANEOUSLY.&nbsp; So I am not the email leper I thought I was for a while.&nbsp; Still haven't heard from my prof. yet.&nbsp; I am still checking email something like every 2 hours.&nbsp; Maybe I should write him again?&nbsp; I mean really, can you be too pushy when you want something?

      I am pouting.&nbsp; Alot.&nbsp; Now it is like me and the prof I want to work with are dating, since he&nbsp;isn't writing me back.&nbsp; Ugh!&nbsp; And I ran into zoo boy today (one of my former crushes).&nbsp; That was interesting.&nbsp; It went something like this:  BunHug:&nbsp; Oh! You scared me.&nbsp; (since he creeped up on me) ZooB:&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; So are you done with the observation? BunHug:&nbsp; Yup. ZooB:&nbsp; I was wondering if you were still alive... BunHug:&nbsp; (wondering if now is the best time to remind him he stopped emailing me...)&nbsp; Yup, Ive been around... *and then some other nonsense was spoken here* ZooB:&nbsp; I had to get up early yesterday to take somebody to the airport. BunHug:&nbsp; (wondering if i should ask if it was in fact his girlfriend) Oh yeah? ZooB:&nbsp; Ok, I need to go work on something or other...*as we both walk in separate directions*  Yay.&nbsp; My life is so interesting.&nbsp; It is encounters like these that make me say boys are stupid.&nbsp; And in the long run, saying it doesn't help any.&nbsp; It doesn't change things.&nbsp; So anyway.&nbsp; From this conversation and how I have been anxiously awaiting my reply from Neb.(I check my email at least 4 times a day), you can tell its shaping up to be a less than stellar week.&nbsp; Maybe I am too pushy.&nbsp; I like my pushiness though.&nbsp; Im the queen of pushiness.&nbsp; At least it helps you get your way. Oh and work is making me extra tired lately.&nbsp; Im not sure how much longer I can handle the opening at 5am thing. The most interesting thing thats happened so far this week is that I get to maybe help out with orientation.&nbsp; Talk about study abroad or something.&nbsp; Woo Hoo.&nbsp; Slow down, roller coaster of life.

      Allright.  I actually had a fairly good time last night.  M and I went down to KC and ate at the Macaroni Grill, and then went over to the Plaza and wandered a little.  My sister (who lives in KC) gave me a call and said she might see us out later.  So she went to a sort of reception thing for some people she works with who are getting married, which was also, conveniently, on the Plaza.  So D and I stopped in for a little while, to say hi and stuff.  And I had a beer.  UGH.  Drinking does not agree with me, even one beer makes me a little tipsy.  I had a pretty good time though.  It was the first time M had been to the Macaroni Grill, which surprised me a lot, I guess since I've ate there so often.  She was duly impressed by the operetic singing waiters and waitresses, and the crayons.  That really is one of my favorite restraunts, Im lucky it hasn't been spoiled for me by my going there with some ex-bf.  The plaza, on the other hand, has been a little spoilt for me.  The barnes and noble there...  Bad memories.  Plus, we saw some girl holding hands with her boyfriend as they were walking along, and I was like "dammit.  I want that."  Not specifically her boyfriend or anything, just the ability to hold someones hand while walking, without them freaking out and practically yelling at me for it. I guess thats what I get though.  We  all make choices and I guess I just need to work on realizing why that one didn't work out for me.  It should be fairly simple.  You'd think.  He didn't want to be "in love" with me.  He wanted to sleep with me and was happy having me around, every now and then.  But I wanted to love him.  That's why Ive been kicking myself for the past 3 years.  It's really time to be over it though.  It was time to be over it years ago.  I just need to find someone I like.  Someone new.  Thats the main problem with living in Kansas.  It's so difficult to meet new people.  It's good to think about him less though.  It makes me feel a little more done with everything about him.  If only I didn't have to see him every week or so.

      OH yeah.&nbsp; Omaha, Nebraska.&nbsp; Here I come ya'll.&nbsp; Or maybe not.&nbsp; I could be jumping the gun.&nbsp; A little.&nbsp; But I responded to my email from the Prof. I want to work with.&nbsp; I had to restrain myself to not answer it right away so as not to appear too desperate.&nbsp; I am so so so so excited.&nbsp; I asked him about days to meet.&nbsp; I wonder if he's going to think im pushy.&nbsp; It's like we're dating.&nbsp; Or something.&nbsp; OH GOD i didn't think that Graduate school could just sneak up on you like this.&nbsp; I am such a geek to be so excited, but what can I say?&nbsp; Im an uber geek.

      I feel like I am the walking dead.&nbsp; I didn't think that working 8 hours a day would make me so tired.&nbsp; It's tough work, barrista-ing, let me tell you people.&nbsp; You have to be nice for as long as you are at work.&nbsp; I find it difficult to be so cheery and generally happy for such a long time.&nbsp; Plus it's such a drawn-out day since Im working mornings and evenings (split-shifts).&nbsp; I feel only sorta alive.&nbsp; Plus I have no time to run.&nbsp; That is making me a not so happy person.&nbsp; I think Im getting up extra early tomorrow to get a little "road-time" in. I hate that women have to put up with some crap that men never really have to.&nbsp; The whole double-standard thing.&nbsp; It's hard to be a girl in todays world.

      Oh Dear.&nbsp; Oh Dear.&nbsp; Oh crap.&nbsp; I am now officially somewhat decided on what schools to apply to once I have taken the GRE.&nbsp; That means I now have to start studying for it.&nbsp; Crap. And then I have the worry about being accepted to one of these places and what will happen if im not.&nbsp; Im allready stressed and I haven't taken the friggin test.&nbsp; And what happens if I am?&nbsp;(accepted) Can I move halfway around the country and still remain sane?&nbsp; And somehow make it through graduate school without starving?&nbsp; Im worried.&nbsp; REAL worried. ARGH its about 11pm and I still want to run tomorrow morning.&nbsp; I read something about how i should split my runs in 2, run in the morning and evening in order to beat this heatwave that is buffetting us in the midwest.&nbsp; Don't know if I can handle it.&nbsp; I may just sit up all night chewing off my fingernails.&nbsp; This is shaping up to be a tough year and I thought I would barely survive last semester.&nbsp; My braincells are allready cowering at the back of my skull, knowing what punishment they are in for.&nbsp; I've got a headache from all my web research.&nbsp; Hoorah.

      Allright.&nbsp; so it's not going so well with my having my fallback schools ordered.&nbsp; I have vague ideas of where I would like to go.&nbsp; Such as, anywhere that would accept me.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; I am that shallow.&nbsp; Show me that you want me and I'll never leave... (oops!) Anyway.&nbsp; Dragging myself to my computer this evening, I am slowly now attempting to get on with my career driven life.&nbsp; UGH. If I ever decide that I actually want to be married, it will be difficult to learn how to do acceptable social interaction with boys.&nbsp; They are another species, in a sense, and I don't understand them.&nbsp; I do like  urlLink this book  which says they will die out in 125,000 years though.

       Ok, so, its well known that to be an exercise fanatic you actually have to do it every now and then.&nbsp; Linds (my exercise buddy) and I have very good intentions.&nbsp; We just sort of forget to run, because we get too busy talking.&nbsp; So we walked the other day, 4 miles.&nbsp; We could have run those four miles in half the time, at least, but we were busy talking.&nbsp; Maybe it's sorta like those anorexic girls forgetting to eat.&nbsp; I can understand that.    Sooo yeah.&nbsp; I've been really lazy lately, slacking off from running and all.&nbsp; I do have the good intentions though.&nbsp; Linds and I talk about&nbsp;maybe lifting weights in the fall, as well as running in the mornings.&nbsp; Which would be fab, could we ever work up enough energy to actually DO it.&nbsp; Ugh, stay away from the nike brands though, children, I don't like their business practices much.&nbsp; I lean towards asics or addidas.&nbsp; or New Balance.    Ok, today's the day, as well.&nbsp; Im going to get my final list of Grad schools I want to go to, and then start practicing for   urlLink  this    horrific test I have to take in the fall.&nbsp; It's enough to give a girl an ulcer.

      Ok.&nbsp; In my quest to be a complete airhead, I totally loved  urlLink this  show.&nbsp; Yes, the writer gave it a thumbs down, in a sense.&nbsp; However, I was creepily attracted to the goth boy, Cooper.&nbsp; Maybe its just my identifiying with another middle child, but he has a sort of underage sexiness going on.&nbsp; Weird.&nbsp; I can't wait to see what happens next week.&nbsp; And how weird would it be to find out you are pregnant at the same time as your daughter?&nbsp; I'm hoping she has an abortion, I can't imagine dealing with a kid while in high school.

      Example of how my braincells stop functioning once I admit I like someone:  &nbsp;  BunHug: Want a cookie?  &nbsp;  TattooB: No.  &nbsp;  BunHug: They're really good, I made them, and I make the best cookies out of anyone.&nbsp; That's my sales pitch.  &nbsp;  TattooB: &nbsp;....(looking at me)...  &nbsp;  BunHug:&nbsp; I've sold two of them allready, I'm a culinary artiest.  &nbsp;  TattooB: &nbsp;...(still looking at me)... So are those for tomorrow?  &nbsp;  BunHug: &nbsp;Yup, Bec's a little slow on the cookie cooking, so I thought I'd help her out...  &nbsp;  TattooB:&nbsp; Bec???  &nbsp;  BunHug:&nbsp; Long blonde hair, normally opens on weekends?  &nbsp;  TattooB:&nbsp; Oh yeah, she's not here as much as the rest of you.&nbsp; (indicating he thinks Im a looser)  &nbsp;  BunHug:&nbsp; Can I get you something?&nbsp; (Starting to wonder why he's still standing and staring at me, I know Im beautiful and all, but this is a little much...)  &nbsp;  TattooB:&nbsp; (indicating his steaming coffee) My coffee.  &nbsp;  BunHug:&nbsp; I'm sorry, you don't have to get a new cup everytime you come in you know, free refills and all.&nbsp; (as starting to ring him up)  &nbsp;  TattooB:&nbsp; They threw my cup away!&nbsp; (indicating his employers at the tattoo parlor across the street)  &nbsp;  BunHug:&nbsp; I'm sorry, next time just tell me to shut up and ring up your coffee.  &nbsp;  TattooB:&nbsp; (Laughs as he exits)  &nbsp;

      The most interesting thing at the zoo is a big male orangutan.&nbsp; Mawas.&nbsp; He's a cutie, chasing the girls around and everything.&nbsp; Batang, the youngest girl was jumping on him today a little, trying to get him to play with her.&nbsp; He still looks really young because his cheek pads aren't fully grown in yet.&nbsp; My advisor said thats&nbsp;because he was housed with another male at the zoo in pittsburg, PA, which suppressed him hormonally since he was younger.&nbsp; Animals are so neat.&nbsp; I can think of a few humans that it wouldn't hurt if they were hormonally suppressed. Its bad that I lean to the animal right side so often.&nbsp; Like when the Gorrilla got out of the Dallas Zoo and I was angry at the people that provoked him so that he had to be put down.&nbsp; And Tarzan's tiger having to be shot.&nbsp; They said because he lunged at the people trying to capture him.&nbsp; He's a lion for chrissake, they lunge.&nbsp; What else would you expect, him to calmly sit while he is caged again for the rest of his life?&nbsp; People are so stupid, so much of the time.&nbsp; OHHH what was I going to do today? Data entry and junk for my research prof.&nbsp; and maybe look up some masters programs to apply to.&nbsp; I could seriously just quit now and go into wildlife rehab though.&nbsp; If only it paid well.&nbsp; I don't think it does at all.&nbsp; Too bad. I spent a little time with the hippos today as well.&nbsp; They are such sweeeeet girls.&nbsp; Big huge sweeet girls that could kill me in a single bite.&nbsp; I've heard they kill more people in Africa than cars.&nbsp; They are supposed to be related ancestrally to whales.&nbsp; This is my nature lesson day for my readers, sorry.

        Ok, Im feelin' girly.&nbsp; Pink and frilly, if you will.&nbsp; This is how much of a dork I am.&nbsp; I'm getting ready for bed at 10:30pm on a Friday evening because I want to get up at 6:30 in the morning to run.&nbsp;&nbsp; I want to get in a good long run before having to be at the zoo tomorrow (more orang watching..., oh and children, it's O-R-A-N-G-U-T-A-N, there is no freakin'&nbsp; "G" at the end).&nbsp; Yes, I could probably do this without waking up before the sun, but I want to stay on my schedule.&nbsp; Plus, less people are out that early in the morning, which means I don't have to be scared of creepy people.&nbsp; Most of the crackheads are still sleeping.&nbsp; Most of the ones I know, anyway.   EWWW speaking of crackheads.&nbsp; I was stretching out after my run the other morning, and this guy, some old guy whom I do not know, drove up (ie. pulled into my schools parking lot, where I was stretching by my car, and not in a sexy stick my butt out way or anything) and tells me to "start walkin', it's allready 79 degrees by the clock".&nbsp; To which I was like... No, Im sorry, did I somehow give the impression I needed company?  Sheeesh!&nbsp; The one day my running buddy doesn't show and I get this crap.&nbsp; To make&nbsp;things worse, I keep thinking about how I have no hot young boys slobbering after me, but I do have a plethora of old creepy ones.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; Any of you girls out there need a stalker?&nbsp; I could just lend you one of mine.&nbsp; Ok, I need to throw in a little activism, since that's my thing for another year or so till I've finished my Americorp time,   urlLink  this   &nbsp;makes me angry.    I should here lead into my story about how I helped at the nature center, a couple of weeks back.&nbsp; We had a new male bald eagle in, because some retard was shooting them along the Kansas River.&nbsp; Whomever shot him had killed his mate, and he was being torn up by scavengers when we found him.&nbsp; It amazes me, the stupidity that abounds in this nation.&nbsp; We aren't even sure we will be able to release him, because he may not be able to use the talon near where he was injured.&nbsp; Some days I really hate people in a big way.&nbsp; I think taking an animal off of the endangered species act just because it has recovered slightly only increases its risks, especially to things like poaching.&nbsp; Ok.&nbsp; Enough of my preaching for one night?

       Yay! Friday!&nbsp; I get to spend most of today watching an orang be introduced at the topeka zoo.&nbsp; They just got a new male in, and they want to make sure he gets along ok with the girls before putting them on exhibit.&nbsp; Im excited...this is more along the lines of stuff I want to do after I finally get done with school (in the next 6-7 years).&nbsp; Yay for orangs.   Boys are making me angry.&nbsp; Very very angry.&nbsp; I keep getting these stupid crushes on them that last for about a week because then they piss me off by not responding to me.&nbsp; "I NEED SOME HELP HERE PEOPLE!".&nbsp; Honestly.&nbsp; And it's not like im butt ugly or anything.&nbsp; I had real hopes for tattoo boy.&nbsp; They are dwindling as time passes.   I had visions of us living together, and him scaring away my family.&nbsp; That would be awesome.&nbsp; I need someone who could do that more often.&nbsp; I think he could thrive in conditions like that.&nbsp; But, ok... I moved a little ahead of myself on that one.&nbsp; At least hes not like Tim, whom I had visions of us living together and running every morning and getting married and living happily ever after.   Maybe this is a psychosis.&nbsp; For some reason I picture me and "boy" (whomever my current crush may be) in&nbsp;the future, before even having one date.&nbsp; It's been something like a year since Ive been on a date, speaking of that.&nbsp; Do you forget what to do?&nbsp; Im scared that if I go on one Im going to be too intense and scare the person off.&nbsp; I think i allready do that with my visions of marriage.&nbsp; Heck, I don't even want to get married and im envisioning marrying these people.&nbsp; Weird.   I smell.&nbsp; I need a shower.

      It's good to be excited a week is nearly over, right?  I can't wait until classes start again.  I'm starting to feel really lazy and unfocused this summer.  I ought to be studying for the GRE, but I really don't want to take it and have put it off thus far.  If I want grad school though, I should start working on it.  I'm worried about that.  Getting in.  And what I will do if I don't. I don't want to get stuck not getting in and then working and forgetting all about school.  I could see that happening fairly easily. Sleepy sleepy me.  I can't believe how tired I am and it's not even lunch time yet.  Tomorrow I get to watch the new orang be introduced at the zoo.  YAAY.  Should be fun, as long as I don't run into any stupid zoo people who make me angry (ie. boys I had crushes on in previous weeks).  But then there's always one of those around somewhere, right?  Im feeling a nap right now... then maybe I can work a little before heading back to work.

      Ugh.  Thats right.  I get to work tomorrow morning at 5am, meaning I should be leaving my house around 4:30, meaning I should be awake at approximately 4am.  I don't know how I will truly survive.   Well, thats not exactly true.  After all, I am a barrista.  I am so happy that H attempted to come to my work tonight, nevermind that we were allready closed.  At least I didn't scare him off like I had thought.  Hey, it's possible.

      I love working at the nature center.  It is so much fun, and where else could you find a lost snake peeking down out of one of the corners of the display cases?  Yes.  We have lost a snake, a kingsnake to be exact, and he was spotted and grabbed today, but he is much too smart for us, apparently.   Before D could get him out, which I was attempting to help with, he snuck back up to the top of the compartment that he was peeking out of.  So he is still missing.  Momentarily.  He's in the display case, at least, and we don't think he can escape out to the rest of the nature center.   I am so disappointed to see more of  urlLink this type of news .  He makes me so angry with everything he's done.  I am so not political, normally, but I can not stand to deal with this man anymore.  I don't want to see his face and I don't want to hear his stupid remarks, and I don't want to have him elected again.  I think I might have to move, if it happens.  Here I come Canadia.

      Today I am feeling sorta crappy, but better now that MegHan finally remembered yesterday was my birthday. I've been wondering when it was gonna happen, and not quite sure whether I should or shouldn't say something. Yay for the trials of friendship. I am currently worried about everything related to my career. I think I tend to space off about it, but I can't believe I only have 1 year, or more like 6 months to get my shit together. Then Im finally off. Far away. Scary. A little. Anyhoo, I suppose I'll start studying my standardized test crap soon, before I have to take it. So what did I do for my birthday? Had a Strawberry Margarita at lunch and then had a major shopping spree. Questionable timing, since I think I was still tipsy off of the liquor. Sad sad thing to get drunk off one drink when you are my age.

      Soon.  I don't know if I can handle 5+ hours of chem in one day.  I am determined to get an A in the class though, which is a good thing.  I will work my butt off until I have no butt.  I had to be at school at 8am this morning, people.  Cut me some slack.  I also had no real break until 11am.  Thus, I may be brain-dead within a few weeks.  We'll see.  I am dissappointed to say that there are no real hot boys in any of my classes.  I feel the urge to graduate and prey on the men there.  Surely there will be a selection at a higher level.  Or I could just see what Tattooboy is doing later.

      I miss England.  Blaine sent me a bunch of photos of it.  His trip there, etc.  I wish he had excluded the one of him kissing his girlfriend.  I wish he wasn't such a total ass.  I don't know how to describe my love-hate relationship with him.  I want to go back (to England).  Libprincess, we need to schedule an out of the country excursion.

      I bought a hamburger from a local  urlLink Sonic  on the way in to school today, for lunch. Little did I know, when I bit into it, that it would be nasty and stale tasting. I had to throw it out. How do you predict something like that? So I am now subsisting on my Ched 'R' Bites and medium cherry-limeade until I can go to dinner with my fam again. It sounds ominously like a repeat of last Sunday. I'm not going to let them bitch me out though, this Sunday. I'm debating whether to munch my protein bar I had intended to eat before running...  3 Revelations that have occurred to me:  1. I have to buy another binder. I allready have 4, but my chem lab manual won't fit in with my chem lecture paper. 2. I need to start a word journal. That's about as exciting as it sounds, but if its gonna help me get where I need to be, I can handle it. (In preparation for the  urlLink GRE  this Oct.) 3. 8 Quarters fit inside my belly-button. I do not wish to tell you how I came by this knowledge, just that it is there.

      Dear readers. I have done  something ... Something a little risque`, for me. Now, I know what you are going to say, "bunnyhugger, you can't wear those... you have no legs for those..." But I tell you now, you are WRONG! We must observe a moment of silence for the seriousness of this topic.      *crickets chirp*       I have bought HOOKER BOOTS! Yes. It is true. I have my first true pair of hooker boots. I did this on a whim, based on my earlier purchase of said miniskirt. I went to Target, and bought  urlLink these . Now, it was partially based on an earlier post from my good friend  urlLink libprincess , and partially because of my deep need, my deep urge to belong in the socially and fashion forward groups that pervade our college campuses nowadays. Yes. I have become a lemming.  I know what you are thinking. BunnyHugger, you have no calves, the boots will fall down to your skinny skinny ankles.  But this is not so. My friends, I have found a wonderful device. A helper in the land of those with helplessly skinny legs. SOCKS. Long,  GLORIOUS, BOOT SOCKS!!!  I know it may be difficult to comprehend, but I now have boots which stay up. On my  LEGS!  The utter joy I am experiencing is difficult to describe. I almost think it's better than sex.  The only thing that may help more is many nights of leg lifts. I don't know if Im up to that, so for now, I will worship the socks. And the boots. In fact, I'm wearing them right now. And I look pretty damn good, if I do say so myself.  No more nights of prancing around half-drunk in boots that wobble around my legs for me, no sir.

Buy books (did that the other day, $360.00, ouch!  And that's not all of them!)  d. Go out to eat.  A lot.  e. move into a new apartment  f. go on vacation  e. quit your job  g. get a new tattoo  h. get a new pet  i. invest (although this one isn't quite so exciting...)  j. pay off all the loan-sharks and thugs  k. buy a new car (new-used)  l. buy a prostitute, for a day (depending on where you live)  m. donate to charity

      I have a great horoscope today:   Your warm blood begins to boil. This is the perfect time to take charge in areas of romance, whether it be with a longtime partner or someone who's just caught your eye. That other party is not only willing to listen and be charmed, but quite ready for it. So put on a flattering shirt and step forward. You may just find that a sly and knowing humor defines the mood of the day, and the rules you're playing by are those which you yourself dictated long ago. You know what you want, so go get it.   I think that means Im supposed to ask tattooboy out... I don't know if I can do it...  but I'll try.  I'm wearing my "boys are stupid shirt".  Think that will win him over?  I have to close tonight as well as working this morning, so Im pretty much assured I will see him.  Hopefully.

      I am so useless this week.  I watched tattooboy play around in the parking lot of the tattoo parlor for about a half hour today.  It's been deathly quiet in the coffee shop lately.  Anyway, he had a skateboard and was riding it back and forth and kinda did some funny falling type things.  Very cute.  I wanted to go attack him in the parking lot.  That would have made his coworkers wonder, Im sure.  I should just ask him out, but damn Im shy.  I was disappointed he only came over once for coffee today...  Oh, on a high note, I got my loans in today.  Finally.  That means I can buy the rest of my books before class begins monday.  Ugh.  Class.  I'm taking 18 hours and talking to Dr. McG about sitting in on a class (Learning).  He's funny, hes the prof I do research with, and babysit for.  I was wearing my oscar the grouch t-shirt today, which has a big picture of oscars head right over my chest.  He told me he liked my shirt, and then I told him how whenever Sarahs baby sees me in this she just stares at my chest.  Sort fixated-like.  He said, "Maybe you shouldn't wear that around me..."  He's also one of the nicest profs I know.  Dr. A, my advisor and the one who wants to work on publishing my paper with me, tried to talk me yesterday into doing work for her comparative class, which Im taking this semester.  She wanted me to organize the extra readings and junk, add to the folders and whatnot, and make copies.  I decided to tell her I was too busy, as opposed to actually doing it.  Wasn't much in the working mood today.  Speaking of, I have to work again tomorrow morning, and then Im thinking of heading to the farmers market for some fresh veggi's.  Yum.  I need to sleep.

      Yeah. I got to hear about how great my ex is yesterday. For about an hour. Because one of the girls helping with the orientation thing has some new relationship with him. I don't understand it. He's just so sneaky. So good at pretending to be a nice guy, that he slips under the radar. Anyhoo, it made me want to puke, on her shoes. She was like "Oh we are going to go to this conference together, and then this one, and oh he wants to drive up to that one...(in  Milwakee )." I guess she lives like 2 houses down the street from him or something, which also freaks me out internally. That's a fucking long drive from Kansas. Argh. I have been doing pretty well with not thinking about him too much anymore. Until people bring him up in conversation. Or I have to see him. Bastard. I think it's better to be hateful towards ex's, because that way you hopefully never have to deal with them again. Scare them off, so they don't come traipsing back into your life at a later point. And that whole "lets be friends" crap, does not work. Trust me. And you will hate yourself for it. And what is with the whole they break up with you and then are jealous like hell whenever you talk to one of their species? I hate boys today. (except tattooboy...he's yummy)

      That is what I have done. All day long. He came in twice today, and it is now so bad that everyone I know know's I have a crush on him. I got nudged and elbowed and "Oh BunnyHuggered". It was awful. Mayer, the big stupid old guy was like "Oh look at you jump up and...." That was fantastic since tattooboy was in the store by then. And looking at Mayer. I could think of nothing mean-ish to say in reply so I told him he'd better throw his cup away (as in Im not cleaning up after his lazy butt). Yeah, pathetic, I know. But he talked to me again today. So things are looking up. Slightly. I got whole bunches of conversation out of him yesterday. I loved it. I wonder if he noticed the drool leaking out of the corner of my mouth as he walked away. Probably not. Sarah said he smiled at me though. YAY! I wanted to chase after him today and make him stay in the shop and talk to me. I have no balls. I need to be more ballsy. More OOMPH.

      Look at me.  Up awake and all in the am.  And god awful tired.  I had a social event today.  Yay.  My family will cry tears of joy for me.  Do I sound like the worlds biggest loozer? In case not, the movie we went out to see was Princess D. # 2.  It was fairly good.  I like the new love interest.  I didn't think it was laugh-out-loud hilarious, but apparently some old people a seat over and behind me and  urlLink libprincess  did.  The lady kept laughing so loud, I thought she might die.  I didn't think her heart could take it.  It would have made my movie viewing experience more enjoyable had she and her husband not been there.  I wanted to kill them both with my bare hands, and maybe my nail clippers, by the end of the movie. Her husband, I thought was cracking his nails for a while.  No no, it was the lid of his freakin' water bottle he kept screwing on and off.  Im not even sure there was any water left, it was like he was just playing with it.  Die Die Die. That's my happy thought for this early in the morning.  Death to all the morons that think they have the theater to themselves when it is actually semi-full. Long day tomorrow.  9 hours at work and orientation and all.  Ugh.  I think I have to look nice, too.

      Yes.  That's right.  The most action (and it really doesn't count as action) I have had in the past few months is when I was holding my friends baby at work last night.  She just leaned her head over and chomped onto my arm.  So now I have a baby-hickey on my arm.  I told little Alison she needs to keep her mouth to herself.  I was like, that's not a boob, you realize this, right? Anyway. I bought 3 textbooks today.  I still have 2 more to buy, they are the more expensive ones.  Is it bad to have the first chapter read before class begins?  My comparative book is looking really good to me.  Or, I could start on the mountain of paperwork I have acquired from my recent trip to Omaha NE.  Yeah.  He sent me something like 6 articles.  I think I used a whole ream of paper printing them off (thank the lord for school, where I sneak usage out of the grad students printer...). I have an hour until work.  Hmmm... I suppose I should work on some of the articles for Dr. M.  Filing is sort of automatic you know?  Mindless drone work. I think I will listen to  urlLink this  work of genious while doing some of that.  "One thing" is my new favorite song.

      I am tired. Yet again. Im hoping that means I'll stop my crappy sleeping pattern though. I've not been able to fall asleep before 1am the past two nights. And I wake up before my alarm (6ish). That means something like maybe 5 hrs. of sleep. Ugh. I don't know whether its excitedness or worry that's making me have such problems. Maybe it's the fact that school is coming up. I'm going to get some textbooks tomorrow, if my loans have been deposited yet. Then Im going to be debt free! Well, other than student loans. YAY! I can't remember the last time I had no credit card bill to pay. It's amazing the weight that's lifting off of me.  I don't really have much to say tonight. My work schedule is wearing on me a little this week. I'm going to have about a 40hr work week, when I normally have about a 20hr. work week. And that's not including my working on my internship paper or doing research/office work for Dr. M. Little tired. And all the crappy people I have to deal with at work (ie. the unwashed masses).  I think I have to speak at this orientation thing on Thurs. I'm not so good with the public speaking, although after last semester when I had something like 8 presentations to give, you'd think I'd be stellar. Not so. I get so nervous in front of groups. Im better one-on-one.  I'm a little worried about my research group with Dr. M. I didn't get on so well with some of the people that worked with us last semester. One girl, Laura, I think is the sweetest person I have met for quite a while, and we get along pretty well. Blaine probably despises me because I ditched him as a research buddy for our school research forum after he left me to do all the work on a project for the regional psych conference. I wasn't too happy about that. And he couldn't understand why I was upset with him. Kelly... I don't know about her. I had a running joke with one of my buddies that she was my girlfriend. I don't remember how it started, but Megan said she tends to hang on my every word. That kinda stopped. She said something to a friend of mine that hippo observations drove us apart, but it was more that when I needed a friend, she couldn't be there for me. I had a rough time dealing with how awful my mother is actually doing last semester, and one day when I was talking to her about it, she rolled her eyes at me. Like I wasn't...giving her a chance to get a word in edgewise or something. Or like she didn't think I was upset. All she ever said to me when I discussed anything was, "I don't know what I would do without my mom."  Yeah. I didn't like not having one either, while growing up, and what really started to bother me was the feeling that I will never get the chance for a normal relationship with her. I have been pushed into a mothering role with her, and it makes me angry because that is her job. Or was. But she's never done it. Not since I was maybe 7. It terrifies me that I will never actually know my mother. I know my dad. Well. He shares just about everything with me. Anymore, I don't know what's real and what's not with my mom. I don't know if she's telling the truth or making things up, and I don't trust her. That is what makes me most sad about how things are now. The good news is, I don't think about it much. My sisters have started thinking about it more, and have become more involved, which is good.  Yuch. Sorry. I'm getting a little too introspective with this thing. I need more ren & stimpy type comedy to liven things up...  For a boy update: I have no luck. I need to move out of this dead, dead town.  Soon (tattoo boy doesn't even visit me much at work anymore, and zoo boy has been busy).  I have cute shoes.  Tell me Im not the whole package?

      I think that's what my family was trying to say the other night.  That I need more human interaction in my life.  My father keeps telling me that work isn't everything.  I can't stand people who sit around and do mindless things like watch TV all day, every day.  I have a few shows I like watching in the evenings, but it is by far one of my least favorite things to do.  I understand the ability to relax in one's home, in front of the TV.  I have enjoyed that every now and then, having a nice quiet time in.  Watching TV and doing nothing and needing to do nothing.  I feel so useless though, if that is all I do.  I like being busy.  I like having deadlines and projects and goals I am working towards.  I have known this about myself for a long, long time.  It keeps you from having to stop and think really.  About anything, sad things especially.  Work is an escape for me.  It's not that I'm burying my head in the ground or anything.  If I happen to meet someone I instantaneously enjoy being in the company of, I won't ignore them.  I just so rarely feel that anymore.  More and more, I like being alone.  I am comfortable by myself.  I am happy in my skin, as many have said.  When I was still dating looser-boy, whom I refer to quite often in the most derogative of terms, if you haven't allready noticed, he asked me if I was happy.  I said I was content.  Satiated, if you will.  I got the reply that that was a bad thing, a bad way to be.  To be honest, it had been quite a long while, years, since I had felt remotely  right  with the world.  I think that at that time, that percise moment in space and place when I was with him, I just needed something.  Something to ground me from feeling like I was reeling from all the blows I was receiving.  Someone to touch.  Touch is very underrated.  I was happy just to be around him.  I guess thats why it has taken me so long to understand why he didn't feel the same.  And why I still feel sad about it every now and then.  I do miss him.  But I think its become missing more than him.  Missing the act of being with someone.  Of belonging with someone?  I don't know.  Missing having someone you feel you could say anything to.  Having someone to go home to.  I miss his cat, almost more than him.  How ironic is that?  I don't really know how I thought it would end though.  I think we were doomed.  From the start.  Yugh!  I'm through with all this relationship junk.  I'm how I am.  Screw my family.

      My semester is shaping up to be a fun one.  I'm taking 18 hours, which I have done before, but not for a while.  It helps that 6 of those 18 are Criminal Justice workshops.  I've never taken any of them before, but I've heard it's a quick and dirty way to get extra hours in.  And they are supposed to be easy.  My Schedule is as follows...  Genetics - MWF at 8am and lab on Tues morning - 4 cred hours Chem 151 - MWF at 10am, recitation at 12 on Mon, and lab at 5:30pm Mon - 5 credit hours!!! Comparative Seminar - MW 1:30-2:45 - 3 cred hours Oranized Crime - Weekend workshop (2 weekends in a row) - 3 cred hours Crime Scene Analysis - 'nother Weekend workshop - 3 cred hours  Im excited for all of them except the chemistry.  At least people I know will be in all of the classes.  That's what I get for being an undergrad for so long.  Last night after dinner, we went for more Ice cream on Mass Street.  This guy ran by us as we were standing outside, and my comment was "I want that."  I think it was my entire family's plan to make me feel badly for not liking bar scenes, but what can I say?  It sort of turned into "you have no social life" attack on me.  Im focused, I can't help it.  I don't think I will meet anyone I will like in a bar, because that's not exactly the best place to meet people, in my view.  Even my dad was making fun of me for not having a date for quite a while.  I could have a date, if I wanted one, that's just not something Im thinking about right now.  I don't really have much time to spend on a boy anyway, so he would probably feel neglected. Anyway, my fam can be pretty catty.  I think it's hard for people to understand that I like school so much.  And they don't understand that Im a little afraid to get into anything serious right now.  Don't really enjoy getting my heart stomped on, so Im trying to do it less and less.  And plus, with the possibility of moving in a year, what's the point any way?

      I have that song in my head. But I really do need some help in order to stop posting. It's addictive. Or something along that line. Since my earlier post I have done the following:  a. showered b. drove to school (stopped on the way for ice cream... I love summer... when it's not 100 degrees out) c. sat and started replying to emails and what not in the lab. And read Meghan's blog... It's really my only way of keeping up with her d. procrastinated to keep myself from actually doing work. Which I love to do. What is wrong with me? I am a work-a-holic I swear. Lately I can't seem to stay on track though. I get pulled off my thought process too easily.  I looked through a lot of my possible future home's stuff, and I think I have decided I would really like it. Probably a lot. Hormone research isn't too far away from things like pheromones and stuff. Which really interests me lately. I can see myself being cooped up for long hours on end in the building I visited, and loving it. And I do like the marmosets allready. I fall in love with animals quickly. So now... I'm only praying I get in. I think I will. I hope I will. With my research background it shouldn't be too hard. Hopefully. It's awful to be nervous about something I will be doing a year from now. If everything goes according to plan.

      I just finished my book last night.  Yeah, it was the one I wrote about on the last post.  It was really good, I got all engrossed in it.  I emitted a little scream when her loved one/husband was killed in the middle of the night by her brothers though.   I wasn't expecting it.  Which was good, I get tired of the books where the plot line is so easy to predict (ie. chick lit.).  I have a habit of getting too into stories and not being able to put them down.  That may have led to my sleeping until 11am this morning.  I figure it's ok since I have nothing much to do today.  Just work at school some, and meet my father and sisters in a nearby town for dinner.  See, one sister lives in KC, and another lives in one on the way to KC.  All in all, we all live about an hour apart.  From my home town to KC.  I am considering wandering the stores in L-town (where my younger sis lives) before meeting with everyone.  Get some nice alone time.  Too bad I don't have money to spend after Thursday and Friday. You know what?  I sorta like my blog.  It's like my online journal that everyone gets to read.  Granted, not many do, but I still like it.  I've almost given up my real journal for it.  Nothing can replace paper and pen though. I'm considering actually styling my hair today.  This is how bored I am this weekend.  I never put much effort into myself...I guess Im not as girly as I sound.  Just think of all the mens that would be following after me if I tried!  I could get all the supermarket rejects.

      Yup that's right.  Still tired.  And frustrated that my computer is being a thing worthy of being thrown out a window.  All I can say is, thank the lord for lap-tops.  I really wanted to start working on my paper to be published today (had to remind you all of how famous I will soon be).  I really don't want to be at school today but Im on a mission to have all of Dr. M's files organized before next week, so that they will be ready when school starts.  Ah, the life of a research assitant.  How do I withstand the glamour? I keep forgetting to mention  urlLink the book  Im reading right now, which I assume means it isn't very captivating.  But it is in a way.  I don't know who was crazy enough to read the bible throughly enough to make up a story like the one Im reading, but then who am I to judge.  It's fiction again though, which is a nice break from the REIGN of non-fiction.  Lets see, the last books I read were  urlLink this one , and then  urlLink this one , and then  urlLink this one  I started, but haven't finished.  I also recently bought Middlesex, which I need to read before school starts.  I figure a week is enough time.

      I'm better now. Less grumpy. I think its the tasty adult beverage I had about an hour ago. It's numbed my senses a little. I don't normally get to have those, so tonight was a welcome change. I went out with my manager from work, Megan, to see  urlLink this  movie, and have a drink. We just went to a restraunt bar since it was kinda early. I had a good relaxing time. Except I went by a store on the way to the movie, and this guy outside was trying to talk to me. Why do strange people I don't know think I want to strike up a conversation with them? Or get hit on at a grocery store. Let me tell ya, that's really classy. If we dated and then had kids later in life, I could tell them how dad met mom at the local supermarket. And not even inside, he was sitting outside. Fabulous. The movie was fairly ok, I thought. I liked the romancy part of it, which is unusual. Well, unusual since stupid head. I haven't been much into romance lately. But Im getting better. Anyway, I think Mr. Phoenix is my type. He's a very solid person. I like people who seem very real. Ok, so Omaha. I spent Thursday night hanging out in my room watching videos. That ordering video thing in hotels is really cool. And expensive. Watch out for the cost of the movies you rent/watch. I had planned on maybe going out somewhere, but lost the nerve. I bummed around town the first day, and gave the prof. I was meeting with a call. I met him this morning, which was nice. I got to meet a couple of grad students, and the marmosets. I felt a little like I was being quiet, which I have a tendency to be around new people, which is bad since it may have made me seem uninterested. I am very interested. Im just not sure if I want to do behavioral endocrinology for the next five years or so. Gotta work that one out. Plus I didn't really have anything to eat all morning. So I wasn't feeling my hottest. But I still had a good time and I'm going to mail a thank you card to thank him for taking time out to meet with me. I stopped in this small town on the way home for lunch, and ooh it was scary. Beware small towns with only 3 fast food restraunts. I think everyone in town was out at the Arbys today. So Im sorta boring but I had a good time. I need more mini-breaks from Kansas. Plus the town was a lot bigger than mine. We don't have any 5 lane highways here, like they did there. I think I like bigger cities.

I am so tired I don't think i can even share the fun about feeding the marmosets grub worms.  I save that and all my other wonderful stories of Omaha for a day when my computer is being less stupid.   And Im less tired and grouchy from a 3-4hr. drive.

      I had the absolute worst attempt to sleep last night. I don't know what was wrong with me. Kept tossing and turning all night. I think that my karma from saying bad things about people is coming back to haunt me as well, because I had some funky dreams last night. This will teach you to not say things about people (except nice things) unless you yourself want something bad to happen to you. Mostly, they were about how my friend was very very angry with me, Im not sure what about, but all of them ended with us never wanting to speak to each other again. I had at least two separate dreams in which this happened, most likely because I kept waking up. UNNH. 6:00 came really early this morning. I had intentions of getting to my meeting place (with my running buddy) a little early and doing an extra 2miles. That didn't happen. I got there on time, she called since she hadn't heard from me yesterday, and we met about 10min late. And then we only ran 2 miles as opposed to our normal 4. It was muggy out and my stomach hurt. Probably all the stress from thinking that Im never going to talk to my friend again. It took me quite a while this morning to realize all of that was only a dream (or 2ish). Big plans today, still need to a. clean my car out b. pack c. fix my school schedule (yay if I can get in touch w/ our dept. secretary, I need a new access # since I lost my old one and I want to register for some easy classes, ie. weekend workshops. I figure Im entitled since I have to take chem again this semester.) d. volunteer at nature center (3 hrs?) e. email one of my references I haven't been able to get in touch with yet (for my CV). f. make a list of directions so I can figure out where to go once I get to NE. g. oh and laundry. and other random stuff like meet with my bio advisor. Im so split personality-like lately, having meetings with my psych and bio profs. I think they confuse me sometimes. I forgot something that Im supposed to have done for today, so hopefully I will remember it before I have to meet with my bio advisor, but Im not counting on it.

      The funniest thing happened today.  I overslept a little, and so missed my mailman by about a half hour.  So, since I had a bill to mail, on the way to get lunch, I stopped by a mailbox in a shopping center.  Unfortuntely, as I pulled up, I noticed the Oldies station PT Cruiser parked nearby.  Actually, they were sorta blocking the mailbox.  The event played out as follows: As I leaped from my parked car to try and throw my bill in the bin, this scrawny boy thrust a Coke can into my hand. Scrawny boy: how about a free coke? BunHug:  Um.  Ok.  Thanks. As I threw myself back into my car and sped off, I noticed them watching me go.  Did they think I realized on my way to get my free coke that there was a mailbox nearby, and that I had just been waiting to mail a letter?  Do you think they realized my ploy to get a free can of coke with no intention of listening to the station in my free time (we actually listen to it at work)? And anyway, who goes to a live radio spot to get a free coke?  Thanks again Brian &amp; Levy, the interns.

      YAY!  one more day till my mini-trip!  You know what's strange?  How excited I am to leave Kansas for a little while.  And its not like Im visiting a hot-spot in the nation or anything.  It's only Omaha.  But still, it's outside KS.  I am only slightly worried, I've been stressing over what to wear and what to say.  I think my enthusaism will come across either way, so that will help.  I think I've decided on some khakis and a nice shirt, maybe just a polo one or something.  I want to look nice, but I have at least a 4 hour drive.  I think he'll be understanding about that.  I guess what I wear shouldn't really factor into how well the meeting goes, anyway. I did agree to publish my paper (notice the "my").  Everyone I've said something to about it has just said that unfortunately, I'm just being inducted to the jerky world of academia a little early.  So it sucks, but at least when I ran into my advisor yesterday, she made it sound like it was more for my benefit than hers.  So maybe she won't want credit for it.  Either way, I guess it would be nice to say i've been published.  Plus it would probably help when applying to grad schools.  Sort-of on that note, I finished typing up my CV yesterday, and its looking good.  I've got three pages of how wonderful I am. I had a dream last night, about camp.  It was very strange, because when I checked my email today, I had 2 letters from a bunk-mate of mine that was in a cabin with me a couple of years ago (that must have been my magic at work again). She actually went back this summer, which Im a little jealous of.  I haven't really accomplished much this summer.  I could be back having fun in PA.  It was weird to think of the kids I was a counselor for, they are in the Dorm this summer, which means they are about 16 or 17.  crazy.  They were 12-13 the two years I was there.  I wonder what the waterfront looks like now.  They were planning a big renovation.  Everytime I hear the song "American Pie" it makes me think of them.  That was our call to lunch song.  UGH.  I almost want to go look through photo albums now.  The girls in my bunk are like the daughters I'll never have (because Im not sure I can handle kids, after looking after my parents).  Ooo that was mean, huh?  I remember that for my birthday, they decorated the bunk and made me a huge card in arts and crafts.  It was great. I have so much that I need to work on getting done before thursday, I just don't feel like doing it.  I made myself a list of stuff to get done tonight at work.  I'm good at planning to do stuff, its just the actual "doing" part that I have trouble with.  I suppose I should go work on my bio stuff for my advisor tomorrow though.  I've been slacking enough on it for all summer.  Since school starts in 2 weeks, I feel its time to be motivated.

      The situation is as follows... I did some research at our local zoo for my senior project.  The project is essentially done, and I have been approached by my advisor as to whether I want to submit it for publication.  This worries me, in part, because she presented a poster of my work with her name listed as first author last Spring.  At a fairly important conference. Now, with this publishing thing...she said she has made an attempt to fix some of the problems with the paper.  Does that mean she expects first author privileges again?  I'm at a loss of what to do.  I would love to have a paper published as an undergraduate, but it is MY work.  She helped out, as my advisor.  I have trouble standing up to the professors I work so closely with because of that very fact.  I have to work closely with them.  Plus some of them do have quite the large ego. So now Im excited but stressed that she is trying to take credit for my work again.  I don't know what to do.
