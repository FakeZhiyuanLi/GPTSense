      Well, on Saturday, I bought season 1 of the Transformers on DVD.&nbsp; I watched this show in the mid 80s all the time, and recently I just really wanted to see it again.&nbsp; While the first 3 episodes I knew quite well, the rest of it seemed completely new to me.&nbsp; I know it isn't new, because there were little things here and there that I could remember, but the episodes in general I could not remember.&nbsp; Now I want seasons 2, 3 and 4.&nbsp; Nearly 100 episodes in total.  Now, this brings me to a subject that seems to pop up from time to time.&nbsp; What is a 27 year old man doing watching cartoons?&nbsp; To that question, my answer is:&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; Is there some rule that says adults can't enjoy good entertainment that's aimed at children, while still having a broader appeal?&nbsp; Besides, I'd rather not leave my childhood completely behind.&nbsp; It's always fun to indulge your inner child :)

      Well, I've requested Monday and Tuesday off from work next week so I can get started on my preparations for going to Japan.&nbsp; While it won't take me 2 days to do what I have to do, I also just want the time off, as it was pointed out not too long ago that it seems like I never take time off.&nbsp; You know what?&nbsp; I haven't taken a full week off in months.&nbsp; Well, next week, I'm applying for my passport.&nbsp; Off to Canada Place I will be going (which, strangely enough, is right next door to the building I work in).  I think I'm going to get my bank card replaced, too.&nbsp; The thing is getting so old and worn out that it's been taking a few swipes for it to work in the last couple of weeks.&nbsp; But apart from that, I won't be doing much else, except for a haircut.  What I am looking to do soon is apply for that Mastercard that I can get through my university alumni association that gives a very low rate for alumni.&nbsp; While it's not amazing that I've been able to get by without a credit card for all these years (really, it's so much easier just to use Interac with my bank card), it'll be quite difficult to get by without one while traveling.&nbsp; I'm also going to have to figure out things with my bank for transfering money to my account while in Japan so that my student loan payments can actually go through.&nbsp; I won't be using a bank in Japan, since it's somewhat difficult for a foreigner to get an account and the fees are apparently ridiculous.&nbsp; It's much easier just to get an account at a post office.  Anyway, the fact that I plan to go to Japan by the end of the year is finally starting feel real.&nbsp; I'm applying for the job in less than 3 months, and if everything goes well, I could be there by December or January.&nbsp; I can't believe that's only 5-6 months away!&nbsp; I'm sure I'll be quite nervous, excited, and very anxious then.

      Well, this was a surprise,  urlLink Edmonton had 150mm of rain on Sunday  in a once in 200 years storm.  So, we've been having some pretty wild weather so far this month.  It's funny how I was complaining about the lack of thunderstorms just 2 weeks ago, then we get 4 severe thunderstorms, including the worst since probably the 1987 tornado.

      Well, the cold's getting better, just have a nasty cough.  Today was interesting, though.  We had our 4th freak thunderstorm in the last couple weeks.  There was golf ball sized hail reported, as well as a lot of flooding.  Even West Edmonton Mall got flooded.  The rain was so heavy, it was difficult to see very far.

      One of the worst colds I've ever had.  I feel horrible...when the extra strength Sudafed isn't in effect.  Damn that stuff is good.  I feel very little of the sore throat, runny nose or coughing when the codeine has taken hold of my system.  It's got to be a mood altering drug, too, because my mood sure does improve (though that may be because I feel so much better with it).  Surprisingly, I've been able to get by fine at work.  However, I've had almost no appetite, which makes me feel out of energy all the time.  Well, I hope I can get over this cold quickly.  It sucks.

      I think the title explains it all.  Good food.

      I'd like to start of by wishing everyone a happy July 5th.  Okay, so July 5th has no significance.  But I have today off from work thanks to July 4th.  I guess that's the benefit of working for a company that deals mainly with Americans.  But enough of that.  Friday was interesting.  After having to call for most of the shift (first time in over 3 months), I went home and had to run for half a block through the heaviest downpour I've experienced in years.  I was completely soaked when I got home.  That didn't help my cold, which was getting better at the time.  Now I'm sick as a...sick person.  Maybe it's a good thing that this is a long weekend for me.  Anyway, welcome to the new blog, people!

      Well, the Olympics are here, and I'm obviously going to watch as much as I can.  I love the Olympics.  However, while watching, I see a commercial about West Nile virus.  My main thoughts are that this is stupid.  West Nile is being overhyped as some big deadly disease that will plague us all.  But West Nile rarely ever affects humans.  It's a bird disease, and your chances of getting West Nile are so low that you're probably more likely to get an infection from having a hangnail.  It's absurd how much they're making this out to be a horrible disease for people.  Sure, it's a bad disease because it kills so many birds, but humans are almost always totally immune to its effects.  Let's get more awareness about things like HIV/AIDS, which has been utterly lacking lately.

      Well, on the 20th, I'll be going to Beaverlodge, a small town near Grande Prairie in northern Alberta.  That's where I was born, and I haven't actually been there in about 8 years.  It's the town's 75th anniversary, I'm looking forward to seeing the town again.  It's funny, but I kind of just want to spend some time walking around the town from one end to the other.
