      What the hell is wrong with me? It's summertime and I should be reveling in my abundant free time. But it's hard to even the leave the house. It' hard to turn off the tv. It's hard to enjoy myself. I'm beginning to think that happiness is an illusion. I mean real happiness, not just the plastered smiles we reserve for social situations. Or maybe those people who like to go to parties and bars and numb themselves really are happy. I usually assume that people who like to socialize a lot are miserable inside and need the company of others to feel alive. But I'm miserable and alone, even if it is by choice. I've cut myself off from my friends during the last couple of years. I meet new people all the time and make friends easily at school. But I won't let myself get close to anyone. Boyfriend loves me to pieces. He calls me "complicated." He likes me the way I am. What the hell is wrong with him?  Last week we got all new windows in my apartment building. This meant someone coming into my apartment, as well as several more people outside, peering in to my tiny studio. I had fears that my cat would either a) leap out the empty window frame in a desperate attempt to get some fresh air or b) attempt to escape into the hall for some exploring the moment the guy opened my door. I must explain that my cat has a die-hard will. Every goddam day he waits for me at the door and tries to sneak past me, into the hallway. Now, I've been dealing him for 8 years and I always know what to expect from him. But some window installer guy, I thought, would be an easy mark for cat. So, I left a note explaining that my cat would try to escape and that he must the lock the door immediately, since it wouldn't stay closed otherwise. The day they replaced the kitchen window, everything was fine. But on Friday, Boyfriend picked me up and we went to Tacoma. I got home Saturday evening. As I stood in front of the front door of the building looking for my keys, I saw a flash of black fur run up the stairs. I got upstairs and the door to my apartment was wide open. Cat had been roaming the halls for two days. Neighbors left me a note saying they closed the door for me and were wondering if everything was okay. They didn't sign it though.

      I’m still reading that Greg Palast book. Could be the reason I’ve been even more depressed than usual. The more I read about the way things really are, the deeper I fall into the abyss. But ignoring it makes me feel worse somehow. I love a good conspiracy, but Palast is an investigative reporter with evidence. Yes, it’s true people. Corporate greed is rampant and it affects you in ways you may never understand. It boggles the mind how easily humans will sell each other out…for money. I wonder how these people justify what they do. Polluting the environment, eliminating jobs, promoting poverty as a choice, creating food without any nutritional value…I mean, what do these people eat? Have they no concern for the air they breathe? I just finished reading the chapter about the privatization of the prison industry. Wackenhut is apparently a huge player. When they took over a prison in New Mexico, the number of guards decreased, and the number of inmates per cell went from one to two. Prisoner abuse was rampant and they hired teenagers in some cases to guard murderers and rapists. All to save a little money in operating expenses. Governments gladly hand over operations to companies that promise to do things cheaper, without sacrificing quality. But quality is never cheap and shoddiness, no matter how inexpensive, will always cost more in the end. People know this from personal experience, yet somehow free market enthusiasts have convinced themselves that the rules don’t apply in business, as long as the money keeps flowing.

      I want to be one of those people who just doesn’t give a crap about anything.

      Spent the long weekend going back and forth from Seattle to Tacoma. Boyfriend has a house out there with a lovely yard. Too bad about the stank, but I'm told I'll get used to it. It's nice to get away from the urban hubbub. While Boyfriend putzed around in the yard watering things and pulling things out of the ground, I sat in the 60s chaise lounge chair and read my book. But nature kept pulling my attention away from the words. First it was the bumble bees buzzing around a flowering bush of some sort. They were in a frenzy, hopping from flower to flower, pollinating their little brains out. So singular in purpose. I'm kinda jealous.   Then the mama Robin dropped by for a bath. She was real cautious, landing first on the fence, and then resting on a lawn ornament. Then she headed for the birdbath and checked in all directions before diving in. Another bird came over and snapped at her, but she kicked it's butt away and continued her bathing.  I'm reading "The Best Democracy Money Can Buy" by Greg Palast. He's a journalist from the United States who writes about American corporations for British media. Why? Because journalism here in the states is a bloody joke. I just finished the first chapter which is all about how the Bush family stole the election. Palast broke the story back in 2000. Now I'm reading the chapter about the IMF and World Bank pushing the globalization agenda on poor Latin American countries.

      I'd like to think of something witty and fabulous to write for my first official post. But I don't think that's gonna happen. I've thought about blogging for years. But something always held me back. Does the world really need another blog? Especially one written by a 30 something urban pessimist? I think not. But that's not really the point, is it? I think it's the technology that scares me a little. I'm somewhat of a technophobe. I don't even have a cell phone yet. The only reason I have a computer is because my 64 year old mom--a devout mac fiend who has taught herself Photoshop, Illustrator, and a bunch of other programs--couldn't stand that I didn't have one. Inevitably, when I bring my laptop to the coffee house, some tech head will ask me something like "What are you running?" I just shrug. A few months ago, a guy asked me if I was excited about upgrading to Jaguar. I didn't have the heart to tell him I hadn't even made it to 10.2.   I saw two movies last week: The Corporation and Fahrenheit 9/11. And I have to say that it gives me a little hope to see that mainstream people are turning out to see subversive documentaries. I think deep down everyone has an inkling that we're being lied to on a regular basis. The problem is that people don't talk about it.

      Cat�s curled up in a ball next to me and I�m watching the Paris and Nicole show. It�s terrible, or course, but I can�t keep my eyes off these rich bimbs. To think, I used to not watch TV at all. I am 35 and I do not own any real furniture. I sit on my bed and type away on my laptop. Maybe that�s why my back always hurts. Whatever. Some day I�ll bust through that glass ceiling and leap over that poverty line. Then I�ll get me a couch. If I work real hard, I�ll get my master�s degree before I�m 40.  Boyfriend and I can�t stop playing Scrabble and Backgammon. Bridge cannot be far behind. He wants me to move to Tacoma and go to the university there. We�ll see.   Friendships are different as I get older.
