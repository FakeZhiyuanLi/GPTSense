      hey all hows everyone doing   heres my testimony   Hello everyone my name is alice i was born in london ontario. when i was 2 my dad left my mom I never heard from him again. My mom had schrezphrenia was unable to look after me so i was put in a foster home. Then i was adopted when i was 4 by my grandparents and moved to timmins. Growing up my grandparents were christians although they never told me. They never really talked about their faith. I grew up as a catholic. I went to sacred heart church and was baptized when i was 12 there so i could attend sacred heart school as my grandparents felt it was a good school to get into. I also went to church at sacred heart church and i would listen but never really felt like i belonged there. Me and my grandpa would go from church to church trying to find the right one we never seem to settle down in a church. We went from church to church for a while and then finally we gave up altogether going to church because we couldnt find that right one. I was never a happy child growing up as i was teased alot.I was born with epilepsy and grew up having seizures all my life. When i entered highschool it stopped and then came back again when i graduated. After highschool i started hanging out with the wrong crowd getting involved in fights getting in trouble bars drinking etc. It was a life i enjoyed at the time but was making me really depressed. Then after that i started to work at lords kitchen a place for people who have no food to come and eat weekly. It was there i met a guy and we started dating. It was pretty good for about a year but then he never made time for me anymore so i ended it . He was my whole life , nothing else mattered to me thats why when i feel the relationship ended.  God showed me that i needed to change and that wasnt the kind of relationship he wanted me to have and not a good way for me to live to depend on someone else for happiness. We broke up after a year together. At that point i felt my life was falling apart, i wasnt getting along with my grandparents as we were always arguing i was in special olympics at the time and i wasnt getting along with any of my friends, so i felt like i needed somebody i dont know where i came up with the idea to do this but after the breakup and the loss of friendsips and the not getting along well with my family i went to my apt said a short and asked jesus into my life and prayed that he would help me sort out my life. Not long after my grandma called the baptists church looking for christians groups to hang out with thats when i found out about c&c i started going there at bfa. Then i started looking into joining a church would go regularly between bfa, faith community trying to decide between the two which one i would attend. Then after a while i finally decided on faith community but wasnt really sure that i wanted to a member right away and wasnt really ready to be baptized yet as i was still sorting out my life and taking one day at a time not really making any commintments. So i started attended faith community and going to college and careers it was going good i was meeting new friends praying and doing bible studies i was learning a lot about god and the christian life. My mental health wasnt doing so well. I wound up twice in the hospital because i was feeling very suicidal and it was god who kept me from doing it getting me into the hospital before i did something to myself. The second time i wound up in the hospital some friends came to visit me when i was there. They gave me some tough love, which i never had before and aksed me a lot of questions to make me look back and reflect on my life and what i was doing with it. It gave me a lot to think about. As at that point in my life i had nowhere to go the drs and councillors didnt want me living in a homeless shelter as i left home looking for an apt and they were looking into places in which i could live , which was even more things i needed to decide i had to make a lot of decissions and quick so this is the time when i needed god the most, and when he made himself very clear in my life and helping me out in the most difficult time of my life. After my friends left the hospital i spent my week in the hospital praying and reading the word trying to find the answers and solutions i needed to fix my life around as i was so unhappy with the way things were going and i needed to do something drastic to change my life. I did a lot of reading in the psalms that week as the ppl in the bible were all in down times and in depression which is what i was going through so i could relate to them. I knew that i was tired and didnt wanna end up in the hospital it was not how i wanted to live. I wanted to be happy and joyful and live for the lord. So from then on i decided to change my life around to try better to get along with my grandparents not to hang around with the ppl who got me in trouble and to live life for god. I also decided to leave c&c for awhile even though it was a good group i felt i needed time alone to heal and get counselling and come back when i felt i was ready. I took about six months off i really got the chance to heal and also had a weekly hangout with some ppl just to keep in touch with some friends i had made from the group since i couldnt see them at the group for a while. I'm glad that i had that time off really felt like i needed it . I'm back in the group its going very well, on the right medication doing well with family and friends and living my life for god. It was a hard thing to go through but i learned a lot and all the time god was right there with me and never gave up on me even though i gave up on myself.
