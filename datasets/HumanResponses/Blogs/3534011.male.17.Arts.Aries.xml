      monday was a weird but wounderful night for me, as i sat down to my computer on msn talkin to my friends, rather than studying for my maths sac which i might add i fuck up real bad, i was talking to a friend of mine, and she reveled something that i never expected...  the reson that i didnt expect it was because i thought she had a boyfriend, and she asked all of these really weird questions which started to get my suspicious... then in more or less words she tells me that she has somewhat fallen for me...  well i did not prepare for this at all and it totally threw me off guard... i did not expect this person to like me at all... but at the same time i am not complaining...  she is one of the nicest people that i have ever met (i would be saying liga is one of the nicest at this point but she cracked the shits with me playing uno today so ner). She is so genuine and funny, and not to mention pretty... and going otu with her would not be a bad thing at all...  The only thing that threw me was when she said she wanted to take it slow, but didnt know what she meant by it ... argh... but i am willing to wait and take it slow... thinking about it all day tuesday, i finally came to realise that it had been in front of my face all the time and i hadn't seen it... well like i said earlier i thought she had a b/f... but it definatly changes things between us...  i dont really know y she likes me though... she says i make her laugh and i am interesting... ha... i laugh at that... im stupid, maybe to some people that is interesting  yes i do like her and no i will not hesitate to go out with her because she is such a nice person...but i cant help but that something has to go wrong cause everytime i do feel this good something does go wrong...  i feel that something has to go wrong cause im  feeling way too damn good

      today was the final exam for the mid year and it was relieving... sitting a 3 hour long english exam will tend to make u very sleepy  i would however like to clear a few things up about a particular rumor i happened to hear a while back... Certain people think that i like a girl at school when i really dont... a few things went down once at a party her and myself were attending, but that was in fact it... i dont care for her and never have... and i dont plan to in the future... afer hearing this rumor i am scared to look at her cause i dont wanna know what she feels cause i really dont like rejecting people, but if thats how it goes down, then thats how it will go down...  The only real reason i talk to her is to tell her to  shut up and things like that... im not the best of friends with her and dont really intend to be... and i know the sorts of people who would spread this kind of thing and i dont like them for doing it...  Some people think that i like her and i really, really dont... might i add eeeewwwwwwww...  people get it through ur heads that  i dont wanna know  about any of it and i really dont care!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      today was my first official exam for year 12.. and not to blow my own trumpet or anything but i think i did really well... I could actually answer every question that the stupid exam threw at me, and now im real happy.. My practice exam was nothing to be proud of... 50% (d)... but i believe that i did a whole lot better on this exam then i thought i would which is such a relief  It is so hard for me to be the only person in my biology class who has no clue of anything... i dont think anyone can concour with this thought (see i even make spelling mistakes)... i try so hard only to fail everytime and now i believe that i have succeeded... no words can describe that feeling... and by the way it was a biology exam... Between my teacher losing my coursework, then finding it again, and getting a 'd' on my practise exam, i was floating up shit creek to put it nicely, and to finally feel like i have come out on top is relieving to say the least...  Everyone thought that i would crack when it came to crunch time, and only a select few actually believed that i could do it... i dont even think my family believed i could... and to prove everyone wrong is a feeling that is undescribeable... I think that most people wanted to prove me wrong when i said i would or even could be as good as some are... they wanted me to fail so badly...  Let me tell you something else its gonna take more than a stupid fucking biology exam to put me down... i will fight to be as good as i can until i am dead and buried... mark my words all of you... i will fight until i have nothing left to give...  So to all those little fucks who thought that they could kill my spirit...   Shoot me again, i ain't dead yet!!!

      people people, i may not be the smartest man alive, or even the smartest person u know, but i am not stupid... cut me a bit of slack... anyway i would also like to state that when u either give out this address or share information about things u have read on my site automatically waves ur right to sue me as a result of u getting the shit beatin out of u...   on a friendly note... i know something that everyone else does not... i am not the sort of guy who would name names so i guess they will be X and Y (sorry no subtle hints today)... X likes Y and he told me so first.. i felt privelaged... and X is unable to tell Y how he feels because he know (and i know) that others will riticule him for it... personally i think its cute (hehe). He made the first move and Y said yes to it and he is happy... he said the other night that Y is the only person that matters to him which mean that X is in love... hehe.  X is a good friend of mine and i believe that he will be happy with Y is she says yes to going out with him... so i say good luck to them both...  People... if u didn't believe that this blog would change the way in which you think... think again and....    believe the hype ppl!!!!!

      hmm... this is my second 'blog' as they call it... so here   last night i sat up and thought of all the things i would put down  and now i have nothing... go figure i will tell you what i hate... that is ppl keeping secrets from me i am the sort of guy who likes to know exactly what is going with everyone... as of late i am seeming to become more distant with details and seeing as pretty much only one person reads this (yeah thats right) i will be specific... i hate the fact that 'they' will not tell me what is going on... no scratch that i hate the fact that 'they' don't trust me enough to know that i wont tell ne one...  it kill me to know something is going on and not to know... aargh... i believe that this person has said yes to... well i call him D (obvious enough).. D, but 'they' will not admit it... maybe i should get over it or maybe i should keep bitchin bout it so 'they' tell me...  i would however like to know why, if so, 'they' said yes... i would never say this again but 'D' has a history of just asking chicks out in the hope that he will get some... lets look at past situations that i have been witness of or other close to me have witnessed... not to be too specific but a certain person named liz on physics camp... he acted like he had never seen a chick before... i believe that it was the fact that she didnt know him to be.. well sorry but a nerd... no offence intended... she of course said no cause she was respectively good looking... then shall we look at alpine hiking (i believe), it was a certain T.M. (sorry i am not going to mention this name but if ur smart ull figure it out) whom he asked out and she of course again said no... she was the ground of him slowing the process down a bit cause she laid down the law for chicks (thank god someone did cause he had no clue)... he then restrategised again to only become more eager than ever... he really needs to gat laid and it is showing big time the way he grovels over the person i call 'they'... he is an ok guy and i dont mind him that much but he needs to look over his picking up strategies again cause they arent working... or at least i dont think so?!?!?!?!?!  do you find me sadistic?.. i dont intend to be but i feel the need to present all the facts about ppl to others before they ('they') make a decision they end up regreting sorry but thats how i feel  when i said it i meant it...   this blog site will change the way u think

      "cause im broken when i'm open, and i dont feel right, but i am strong enough"  what can i say but....... fuck...... sorry for that but under the circumstances i believe it was necessary to do so.... let me tell u why...  C+... and not just one, but two... only to add insult to injury....  i was so sad about that result that i either wanted to punch a hole in a wall or just breakdown and cry. That was the only time i was angry with myself for getting a really bad mark. I wanted that A soo badly that it hurt, and the worst thing is i studied for 3 days straight and still couldnt get it. I'm not disputing the fact that i may know the material, it is my inability to think laterally...  The worst part was i didnt really want the A for the enter score... at the moment im not thinking about the jobs or the unis or the large enter scores.... im thinking about respect... people, you may think that i am stupid but i know that most people dont take me seriously... i mean my inability to be able to recall the most simplist information in the bio lab speaks for itself... i mean fully who doesnt know what the fuck genetic engineering is?...  All i wanted was not just my family, but my teachers and my peers to respect the work that i have done... and i cant even get that... and here is little Mr. 'sunshine on my fucking shoulders' ben beck flaunting his squeaky clean A+ to everyone like he should get a fuckin medal or something... i really would have liked to shove that A+ up his ass... i see it that i have a life and he doesnt so thats my justification... hehe... all i really wanted was my parents/teachers to say for once 'well done, you did really well, congrats'...  i for one know that ms crome doesnt take me seriously and probably wont until im long gone... well actually ever... even my parents dont take me seriously but ill get over that....  one thing that gets to me is that everytime i say im gonna do well or have done well, ppl dont believe me, they dont take me seriously... it really does hurt when even you (yes u liga) dont take me seriously... and dont bullshit me i know you dont... oh im happy that u got an A and u deserved it, every bit of it... but i believe that i deserved one aswell... u dont think i have sacrificed for a good mark... oh believe me i have and have fallen very short evertime... I wanted that mark soo bad, i deserved to have at least one A next to my name... i have paid my dues and i just want my mark... i want my fucking good mark...  but most of all... i want to be taken seriously... no one takes me seriously, so why should i... If i had been writing this 3 days ago i would have been saying what is the point of trying anymore... but ive found a reason... and it my reason....  One thing i found really good was Ms Ray found me personally and said how sorry she felt for me cause she knew how much i sacrificed for it and didnt get it... i never thought i would say this but ms ray understood what i was going through.... and for that i personally thank her...  Monday was soo hard, everyone got their A+'s and there is me... the black sheep with his C+... hold on there were a few of us... but still i felt alone... not only did i fuck up one exam... i fucked up 2... yay team mattjew...  I mostly over it... cant do shit about it now...  as it goes "the worst is over now, and we can breath again..." quotes were taken from the song broken by seether & amy lee which i personally think if off the fuckin chart awesome... wooo  "tomorrow is a new day, you will find your own way, you'll be stronger with each day that you try, and then you learn to fly" anywho im out... oh and by the way sceptor... no its not jess u sick frrrrrrrrrrrrreeak...
