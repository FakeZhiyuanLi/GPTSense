      I GOTTED GUINEA PIGGIES TODAY!! THEY'RE SOOOOO CUTE! I named mine Charlie amd my brother, Kevin, also got one, and he named his Junior. They're adorable!!! I went to our city's Relay for Life event thingy yesterday and into this morning. We had a group of 8 planned to get together and hang out there and raise money for cancer but, that's where the problem was...RELYING ON PEOPLE! Our team captain and another member were in Europe for out school's Orchestra class, 2 people came...and left without letting anyone know, 1 person came, but had to leave early cause she had to work, which was perfectly understandable. So, that left 3 of us...me, Kendra, and Lucas (I know names mean nothing to those of you that don't know me but, get over it). It was from 6 p.m. last night til 8 a.m. this morning, so we stayed up all night walking our school's track, where it was held. We had alot of fun! I hijacked Luc's hat too...I tend to do things like that when I get bored...LOL. Well, anyway, I'm gonna go...I have work tonight. :'( Byyyyyye!!!

      Sorry about the tone of this whole site being kinda depressed. Normally, I'm not all depressive like this but I am now, so just deal with it for now, it'll all change at the end of this god-forsaken season. Sorry for the inconvenience.

       SUMMER SUCKS!  I know, I know...*my* opinion. My computer's not working right, so I can't use my MSN messenger and Yahoo barely works. Therefore, I haven't been able to talk to the majority of my friends this summer. Phones are always busy or they're not home. Or, like my best friend, Jimmy, too busy with his girlfriend to talk to me... Not to mention that I've been working alot lately. I got my permit last Friday, so I've been driving alot lately, lol, which is fun, damn near gave my mom a heart attack on several occasions. LOL. Well, I'll post again later.
