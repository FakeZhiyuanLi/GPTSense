      Hey, Weeza here. I have no idea what a blog is, except for the fact that I just made one, proving how easy and care free the internet has gotten. So far I have figured out that, on a blog, you apparentaly you have a template and then you post things. I think it asked me what I wanted my URL to be, so now I gues I have somesort of a site name to type in if I want to go to be blog. I've heard the term blogring before, is that what this is? Do I go to the same site to view and to post? How do I change my template?

      I live in the suburbs, in a nice little community, active with plenty activities to do. Lots of streets to roam down, etc. Summer has always been my favorite season, most likely because there's no school. But every summer as far as I can remember I've always wanted to spend every day roaming through meadows, woods, and orchards. I would spend my time instead reading Calvin and Hobbes books, watching them walk through the woods behind their house, having their own make believe adventures, just the two of them. Last summer I started reading The Summer of the Monkeys (I didn't finish it) and the boy spent his time, again, in the woods behind his house, exploring and looking at the nature. I wish that I could have some sort of semi-wilderness near my house so that I could spend my days wandering rather than dreaming of wandering. Today I couldn't bring myself to do anything except for imagining that I could hop the fence of my back-yard and wander through trees barefooted, feeling the grass between my toes, and climbing oak trees until I could see a whole valley below my self. I also dreamed that I had a cabin, or some kind of a house, outside of the city, to lounge around all summer. I wish that I could be like Scout in To Kil a Mockingbird and spend everysummer with a few close friends, make-believing, wandering, and of course getting a little mischeif. Whenever I imagine the "perfect" suburban summer, I always think of friends running around at the park, having water gun fights in their front yards with kids on their blocks, and having barbeques at night. But of course, I have very few friends, and I don't like any of my neighbors. When you have woods behind your house, you don't need other people, roaming is a solo sport.  So then I thought of the "perfect" city summer, since the city's not too far, I could just light-rail it downtown. I see people roaming (again) window shopping and eating ice cream with friends, looking into the weird shops, visiting the library and looking at pictures in books. Only the problem for me is that I'm only fifteen, not allowed that freedom, I'm allowed to go to down town plaza, that's it. I can't roam anywhere else. Down town plaza gets boring really fast, and shopping (even if you don't spend any money it seems) wastes a lot of money. And of course, this brings back the necessity of having friends. You get tired of hanging out everyday with the same people, or they get sick of you. And friends can't always be reliable, you won't always want to do the same things together, they might want to try on clothes in every shop while you want to sit down on a bench, eat ice cream, and watch passers-by. My summer would have to be roaming through trees and nature, there's so much to do with nothing. The nature is always reliable, it will always be there and never deny you doing whatever it is that you want to do. Instead I sit here, looking out the window, at the oak trees, rustling with the breeze, right over my fence, in the neighbor's yard.

      The art of movies and the art of books are very different. That's probably why no one is ever happy when a book is made into a movie.  With movies, the art is in the timing, the wardrobe and how it adds to the character or the scene, the camera movements, compaction of a long story into a couple hours, background music. It's all audiovisual. Books are a lot different, some may say deeper. With books you need an imagination, you may see the character how ever you wish, things have descriptions, but even with the most detailed descriptions, you still have variations to the imagination. for example: an aquamarine vinyl handbag with white polka dots, zipped closed at the top with a bow on the upper left side, the handles are long enough to be worn on the shoulder but not around the neck aswell. There're a lot of details there, but to each imagination, the bag is different.  my mind's not working right now, I'll finish/change this later.

      What is it with teenagers these days? No longer do we say "hello!" "hey!" or even "hi!". We never wave and seldom shake hands. Now, our thing is The Nod. Why do we Nod? And what does The Nod mean? The Nod isn't a nod like we are saying yes, that nod is more like The Bob, when you are listening to music. The Nod usually tends to go out ward and slightly up, always with eye contact. I've noticed that The Nod, is either used when saying, "hey," is socially unacceptable. Last Sunday I was at the supermarket and saw my brother's friend (although they never spend time together anymore), he goes to my school, we know each other, while we never talk. Well, he works at the supermarket and saw me from down the isle, to acknowledge our liaison, he Nodded at me. Saying "hello," would have been to personal, and waving is unfashionable, so, you Nod. This is a 'friendly' Nod, but other Nods seem to suggest otherwise. I pondered this while sitting in the car, as we drove along the boulevard, I saw a guy, about my age, sitting on the balcony of his apartment, I decided to Nod at him. He Nodded back. Not a 'friendly' Nod, since we do not know each other. Instead this was an 'I'm checking you out' Nod, his Nod back was an 'I accept that you're checking me out, and I, in turn, check you out aswell' Nod. This Nod has more to do with the eyes, and sometimes with the lips. The eyes close more and suggest lust. The lips protrude oh so slightly  as if about to kiss, but the head comes back to its normal position like a wave returning to the sea. The 'friendly' Nod has become what was once the recognition smile, the one where we bare no teeth but still maintain the same basic facial structure.  What will come next I wonder, how long will The Nod live? Will there be The Eyebrow Lift? The Wink? Or will we go back in our greeting fashion and return to shaking hands?

      Many people now-a-days, usually those drunk with the punk revolution, are trying to be different than the regular, popular jock/prep. They claim that they are different, that they do not believe in stereotypes, and will follow Avril in being themselves. So they go to Claires or some other accessory store, buy fishnet arm warmers and a fuzzy pink diary, clad with the slogan "punk rebel". Now, are these people really being themselves? Or are they just following the next trend?  Many others, not so much going after the fashion, go after the music. A year or so ago, it seemed that my generation was listening to the local Top 40 station, now, everyone has switched to the rock-alternative, is it just coincidence? And it seems like a shocking amount of people have decided the sudden urge to play guitar... why guitar? What draws people to this music with people screaming their heads off, trying to upstage a blaring guitar in the background, possibly a few drums aswell. Ok, that doesn't really have anything to do with this post, it was just on my mind.  But back to the punkers, they grab onto whatever's there, they wear they're bracelets and have their new stereotype, but they're still who they were. Why do they try so hard to be a stereotype, instead of trying to be themselves? Who we are doesn't change with which rockband is topping the charts. We now think that being ourselves is being different, but we're all in the same generation, we're going to have similarities. I have a huge problem with this, what I like is influenced by what other people like, or atleast I think it is. With some things I want to be the same as other people, with other things I want to be different from other people. Other things it'll be both, if everyone likes Sesame Street, I'll want to like it too. But most of these people like Elmo, I might love Elmo far more than any of the others (and I do), but I must be myself (different) so I'll say that I like Big Bird. But what if I don't even like Sesame Street.. or I might, I just really like Elmo just as everyone else does... Which is the bigger lie? Being the same, or being different?  Why care? We could just be ourselves, don't care what people do or don't like. But can we live like that? Uninfluenced, is that possible? That's probably why it takes people so long to find themselves, and when people do finish that quest, what do they find? When they set out, what do they expect to find?  I guess we are not really individuals, we are we. One big mass of human.

      Some people might just see the Harry Potter series as children books, but there are so many lessons that I didn't realize when I was reading them. J.K. Rowling slips them in so casually that I didn't even realize it, probably because I was speed-reading to get to the end, but still, they're great lessons. Of course there are the basics with the racism against the muggle-borns, the mirror of Erised (relating to my previous entry, about 10 minutes previous), basic love principles, Dudley's greed, then the one that's most important to me, human feelings. Dumbledore said it throughout the books, but it became most obvious in book 5, "it is our feelings that make us human," that's probably not a direct quote, but whatever. I wish I remembered that a few months ago, I've never told anyone this. Around the end of May I had a lot of stress, mostly from school projects, but I was depressed one night because I felt unwanted, in P.E., my speed away team ignored me, I'd tell them I was open, when I was right in front of the goal, they'd ignore me, I knew I was the one that they didn't want, the one that got stuck on their team, last one picked. I don't remember everything else I was feeling, but there was a lot. I felt that my life was crap, but then I was thinking about how great my life is, and how I thought I didn't deserve to feel that way, that I wasn't really feeling bad, just being a selfish greedy complaining drama queen brat. I was in my room with the lights off and door closed, crying on my bed. I wanted to do something to prove myself, to prove that I really did have a problem, that I was sad. I didn't want to leave my room, I didn't want my family to see me crying and puffy-eyed like that. I used what I had, I dug my nails into my wrists as hard as I could, I didn't choose my wrists because of the veins there, I did it because the skin was thin and the closest to my fingers. My nails weren't sharp and I barely drew blood as hard as I pushed my nails into the skin, as hard as I scraped I only got a few drops of blood. Afterwards it felt better. It's weird. The next day I stared at my wrists, little red marks were where my nails were. Pathetic scars from the night before. Little pathetic, sad, reminders of how pathetic I was. I thought about doing it again, digging deeper, to prove again that I wasn't a drama queen trying to hurt herself for more drama. I didn't. Instead I just stared at my scars, still slightly visible today, and thought about what I did. Now I know that I wasn't being bratty when I did it. Everybody has emotions, they make us human, I had every right to feel that. We all do, it's why we're human. I don't have to repeat that to prove to myself that my feelings are legitamate. I feel what I do and I can't control that. I wish I remembered Dumbledore's words back then, but now everytime I look at my wrists, see the little marks left, that no one else would reckognize as anything, and I can hear Richard Harris's voice, from playing Dumbledore in the first movies. "It is our emotions that make us human."

      I wrote this a while ago, I'm guessing it was in 2003, just by the dates and stuff.  To want something is to desire a luxury in which you do not posses. Something that is wanted is not necessary for life. It would be nice to have everything that we want but then we would all be spoiled brats. Wanting, without recieving itself can poison the mind. We focus on the items we wish to have, the people we wish to know, and ocmpletely ignore all the important things that we already have. It is human nature to think about bigger better everything rather than enjoy what wehave. This whole concept has a path leading right to greed. If you got what you want all the time, your mind will be tricked into thinking what you want is what you need. Think about it: you start with a brand new cell phone in 1993, your one of the only people who has one. The cell phone is about the size of your hand, with a blip open mouth piece and antenae which make the phone more than twice as big. You don't care because that is the standard size cell phones come in. Years go by, technology is advancing faster than ever. Your cell phone changes with each advancement. Now it's 2003, your cell hpone is no longer twice the size of your hand, but the length of your index finger. It hass all the new capabilities, such as mini games and a million different rings to choose from. Asd well as accessing your emial account and checking the weather forecasts. Now, for some reason, you can no longer have your high-tech minicell and need to go back to your old, huge cell phone. How do you feel? Your old cell phone no longer holds the pride it once did, it doesn't fele good anymoer to hold the phone you once loved. You desire your other cell phone, the tiny high-tech one.       This is what wanting can lead you to. The constant lust for the better luxuries.  Needing is a lot healthier than wanting....  I never finished it, I know what I was going to say though, needing is living in the real world, goals instead of dreams, you only get what you need, and what is wanted is forgotten. When you need, there is substantial reason, not just the bigger. Advancements are because they are necessary, not because you are lazy, yes, as a society we might not have industrialized as much, but we would be purer.
