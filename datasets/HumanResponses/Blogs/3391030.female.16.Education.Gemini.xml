      YES only 2 more Years!!!! and then i can move out of this crappy house! I know it may sound dramatic or whatever you wanna think but my gosh i really really can't stand it here. Today i got to spend the day home alone just me myself and angel and omgosh it was the best day ever! Then mom comes home yelling at me as usual because i left my brush on the bathroom counter top. She always finds something to yell at me about, but does she ever yell at casey? (my 8yr old sis) NOOOOOOO of course not.... then this evening i'm out there talkin to her about it because whenever me and casey argue she always yells at me because "you are older and you should know better" ya and all i'm doin is defending myself and Casey won't even listen to me and mom wants me to watch her this summer.... and then we were talkin about her singing and i said i don't like it it gets on my nerves because she thinks she has to sing over the music and then i can't hear it and it's so annoying and then mom says "you are just jelous" ha i'm sure they will be happy when i move out too because then they won't have to worry about giving me any attention ya know? My gosh she gets away with everything... we were in the pool swimming and casey said "i hate you" and she was talkin to me and my gosh i said that to her before and mom flipped and so i don't say it because i dont' need another stupid reason to get yelled out but of course she's not gonna say anything to casey... and Then casey will do or say something that upsets me and mom will start laughing and i tell her to stop cuz it just encourages her but she won't.... they say that they treat us fair but my gosh they don't. i member when i was that age i had to pick up all my stuff and my bookbag i carried it in the house everyday and carried it to the car everyday but now mom does all that for casey and won't even ask her to get it or if she does she still wont' make her.... and i member too when i was her age i couldn't leave our street and mom made me come in at like 6ish and go to bed at 7:30 and casey comes home at 7:30 and goes to bed at 8:30 and gets 30 mins of tv and give mom a hard time every morning. I am praying that this thanksgiving they will let me stay home for the week because A) i can't miss school B) i dont' want to stay in the house that we have to stay out and C) i need a week to myself it would be just so lovely This summer mom and dad are supposed to go to somewhere in mississippi for a weekend and they are gonna let me stay here so maybe i can see if casey can go stay with one of her friends so i can stay here by my self. Oh ya and then today i told mom i would eat when i got home because i was goint to run over to morgan's really quick and i come home and they ate like everything and didn't leave anything for me except like a scoop of mac and cheese so i just decided it's all good and i dont' need it but ya........ Ah i'm so so sry i'm not really a complainer or aka a Whinger all of the time it's just that today it all really got to me and this is one way to just get it all out of my system but moving on My party is the 12 so you better come!!!!!! only 1week and 4 days til i turn 16!!!!!! (June 7) but yes anywayz ya'll have an awesome day! mine will get better now that i'm in my room! love all of yas!

      Wow wow wow! This has been such and odd day! I seem to have this weird thing going on... honestly i'm beginning to think that it's from the one and only man upstairs if ya know what i'm saying... but yes anywayz... Like i'll be sittin there think 'wow wouldn't be cool if such and such happened?' or i'll be like 'i think such and such is going to happen' and just weird stuff like that........ but then that's not all. It actually happens... at first i thought it was just haha lucky guess or whatever but then it started happening more and more when i was drawing closer to God... but then i started drawing away from him too and as i did it became less frequent to the point where it didn't even happen anymore... but now just recently it's starting to pick up again... i dunno i guess mr man upstairs is tryin to tell me something and gosh darnit i need to listen. This past weekend mom and dad's friends came over (bob lynn gabe{  Another thing is that i was just watchin this Christian concert on channel 141! lol jctv and it's got various artist on it and i just realized how much of a gift music it is and what a beautiful gift it is! Oh it would be hard to live without music... it's like some of it is speaking to you like the writer of the song wrote the song just for you. i wish i could play an instrument or something... i think it would be so awesome. Music is just like so beautiful i know that i already said that but it's so hard to put it into words right now... it's our gift and some people have in my opinion abused it by using it to sing about drugs and sex and crap like that........ anywayz there's my other story!  no one sits with him,he doesn't fit in but we feel like we do when we make fun of him cause you want to belong,do you go along? cause his pain is the price paid for you to belong it's not like you hate him or want him to die but maybe he goes home and thinks suicide or he comes back to school with a gun at his side  and a kindness from you might have saved his life heroes are made when you make a choice   you could be a hero - heroes do what's right you could be a hero - you might save a life you could be a hero - you could join the fight for what's right, for what's right, for what's right  no one talks to her, she feels so alone she's in too much pain to survive on her own the hurt she can't handle overflows to a knife she writes on her arm wants to give up her life each day she goes on is a day that she's brave fighting the lie that giving up is the way each moment of courage her own life she saves when she throws the pills out a hero is made heroes are made when you make a choice  you could be a hero - heroes do what's right you could be a hero - you might save a life you could be a hero - you could join the fight for what's right, for what's right, for what's right  no one talks to him about how he lives he thinks that the choices he makes are just his doesn't know he's a leader with the way he behaves and others will follow the choices he's made  he lives on the edge, he's old enough to decide his brother who wants to be him is just nine he can do what he wants because it's his right the choices he makes change a nine-year-old's life  you could be a hero - heroes do what's right you could be a hero - you might save a life you could be a hero - you could join the fight for what's right, for what's right, for what's right  (rap) little mikey d was the one in class who every day got brutely harassed this went on for years until he decided that ever again would he shed another tear so he walked out the door grabbed a 4.4 out of his father's dresser drawer and said i can't take life no more and like that a life is lost but this ain't even about that all of us just sat back and watched it happen thinking it's not my responsibility  to solve a problem that isn't about me this is our problem this is just one of the daily scenarios in which we chose to cause a riot instead of doing the right thing if we make a choice to be the voice to those who won't speak up for themselves how many lives would be saved changed, rearranged now it's our job to take a shot now don't keep walking by now why didn't you try cause you don't wanna exist and never be seen so let's wake up change the world our time is now  you could be a hero - (our time is now) heroes do what's right you could be a hero - (our time is now) you might save a life you could be a hero - (our time is now) you could join the fight for what's right, for what's right, for what's right

      Wow!!!!!!! Hey! My first post thingy!! i'm so excited!! ya well anywayz just ta let ya know a bit about myself I am THE Mrs. Bloom (hehe) yes i am married to the one and only Mr. Orlando Bloom that you see on the big screen... it's quite interesting how we met here i'll explain.......... It all stared when i knew that my friend kristopher was madly in love with liv tyler and i was MADLY CRAZY in love with Orlando *sigh* well i was thinkin and then i thought of steven tyler (Liv's dad) so me and kristopher got backstage passes and we got to meet Steven and everything.... and while we were talkin to him i mentioned that kirstopher like his daughter and he was so totaly kewl with it! he was like "oh man that's so awesome! she has been needing a man in her life and you are like totally perfect! i'll pay for you guys to fly to go see her and meet her!" so then we were off to go meet Liv. Once we met her she was totally awesome. We became fast friends and as for kristopher he put on his 'charm' and said "hey babe, i think we should date" and then Liv just melted because of Kristopher's 'charm' and she was like " Oh Kristopher!!!! of course we should!!!" and well we all know what happened after that ;-) lol well then anywayz later Kristopher told her bout me liking Orlando so he was like " Oh hey babe! we have so gotta hook Tenea up with Orlando!!!" and Liv was like "omgosh! i am so goin to call him i have finally found the perfect person for him!!!!" so she called him and Orlando said "omgosh i have got to meet her" and he immediately fell in love with me *sigh* it wasn't even love at first sight because we hadn't met yet well then a week or so after i met orlando Kristopher and Liv decided to get married! i was so happy for them it was just a lil small wedding and i was the maid of honor and orlando was the best man. Then a couple of weeks later Orlando and i got married with Liv as the maid of honor and Kristopher as the best man. So now here we all are.... i'm married to Orlando and Kristopher's married to Liv. Not only that but they are expecting a new member of the family soon (kristopher is in denial though).... hehe  oh and by the way don't listen to Kristopher.... there isn't really a Camera i made Orlando get rid of it ;-)   Ya pretty interesting huh? hehe anywayz some other things lets see... um i'm 15 at the moment but i will be 16 on JUNE 7!!! don't forget my presentS! hehe nonononono jk... lets see what else hmm oh ya and i'm tryin to learn how to speak aussie! o dea... singa... finga.... thinga... ringa.... see i'm getting pretty good at it! ummm what else what else umm oh well i dunno right now but i will tell you more the next time i post! so don't be a bunch of "whingers"

       Hey! whoa ya it's like weird! it's like i'm confused about something but i dunno what i'm confused about! it just feels like i'm confused about something like it's way far back in my mind that i'd just have to sit and think awhile to figure out what it was!.... weird huh well yup if you haven't figured that out already then haha! it's true! but yup yup anywayz... you know i strongly believe that everything happens for a reason... God brings people into your lives and God takes em out for a reason...sometimes you meet a person and it's just like ugh why! but ya i dunno maybe that sounds mean but it's complicated i guess.... I was also thinking... When people think of me... What do they think? is it nice... Do they think of me as a Spoiled brat? i hope not... sometimes when peeps think that it's like ugh i wish i didn't have any of it cuz yes i know i have nice things... but i hope i don't act like a spoiled brat because if i am PLEASE TELL ME that's the last thing i wanna come across as... sheesh where is this post goin? i have no idea but anywayz ya... ttyl!

      'We Are' by Kids in the Way We're on the edge of our youth, the days are getting long. It seems the times of our lives have all come and gone, but we know better. We've just begun. We are, we are, the kids in the way. You can't hold us down, oh no, you can't hold us down. This world it tells us what to do. It tells us who to be. They think their answers to this life will satisfy our needs. We are so different. We are another breed. There's nothing you can do or say, to make us choose another way. There's nothing you can do or say, to make us go away.

      You know... the thing about this thing that i don't like is that everyone can read it if you post it! all they need is the link... ever feel like you wanna write something but then you only want certain peeps to read it and certain peeps you don't wanna read it.... ugh i dunno i do.. cuz sometimes you just wanna talk about something that has to do with someone but you know if they read it they will know it's them... hrm argh so confuse so confused so confused... Gosh you know what my problem is? i just think to much... I think to much into everything then i get myself all worried and what not and then i just like go crazy... not literally but like it feels like it... ya but anywayz that's all i'm gonna say before i go "crazy"

      Do you ever just sit and think? Think so much that you think yourself into a mess of some sort? I do... a lil to often... What if...? that seems to be the most popular question... These are the times that i wish i couldn't think cuz i just like drive myself mad with it! hrmm and it's about so many different things... and stuff that's pointless but yet i let myself worry about them or get to me... sheesh i dunno i guess i just have problems.... lalalalalalala i dunno i feel like writtin like something deep but i never can! it sucks butt! i think it's so awesome to read stuff from someone who's like a "deep" person but then of course half of the time i don't always understand but ya i'm just not a deep person i'm more of a Blah person ya know? more borin sheesh.... maybe that's why i've never had a bf cuz i'm just not interestin.... or maybe argh nvm not gonna go into that... It doesn't really bother me most of the times but then it's like ARGH when everyone around you can talk about it but you can't. oh well i'm just different! what's new? lol oh ya i know something else i wanted to write about! Ya i've got alot of stuff from my friends about my dad... like they think he's mean or something because he has this look on his face... true sometimes it does look like he's mad but that's just his facial expression... in someways i dunno it kinda erks me when peeps say stuff like that bout him but then i know they don't know him as well as i do... but then they act like they are afraid of him and he's never done anything to him but ya... so if you are readin this and you think that my dad is like always mad or anything like that just know that he's not because if he was mad you would know... but ya i guess that's all i'm gonna right about for now! ttyl!

      Well in the profile there is this question spot and i got this awesome question! but it was like you can only type 150 characters blah blah blah and well i typed like 462 or something like that lol so i'm gonna post it! ok here it goes... Mud between your toes, How would you live life as a frog? Does there have to be mud between my toes?! why not just on my legs or something! If i were a frog.. i'd invent Frog Shoes! and then all the frogs would be like oh great and awesome Tenea Frog how can we get some Frog Shoes? And i'd be like you must bring me 5 of the best kinds and rare bugs there are! then i would crown myself Queen Tenea Frog and i'd have TENEA FROG POWER with the cutest Frog King! and everyone would love me! and i'd live happily ever after!
