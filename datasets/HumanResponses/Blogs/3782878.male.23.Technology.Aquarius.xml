						   There came a day that I was told was the day I would begin the journey to furfill my destiny. I had spent many of my hatchling years under the tutilage of the Mystics of Cabalis, they taught me all living things have a spirit, and while it was easy to convince a living being to be a tool for our regal line, the art of asking the dead spirits of animals to give to us their blessing is quite different.  I am the oldest of 4 Siblings, and I am a shaman. My brother Shasthis spent too much time playing with the Scaled Wolves, and has since become a Beastlord. Next in the Line is my Sister, who unfortunately has been pampered by the nobles of Cabalis, for she went down the respected path of Necromancer. My Brother Shaszaak has a burning in his blood to that he has forged to perfection, learning the skills of our battle hardened monks.  Since I was the eldest, I made my rite of passage first, and began my spirit walk with the first steps into the Field of Bone, a place filled with the remains of the fallen warriors of both sides of the Iksar vs Dragon battle. I spent the first few seasons of my life honing my skills against the skeletons and the Scaled Pups, and as I worked to increase my skill, I saw the powerful Deltree, an elder beastlord, hated by most Iksar for his befriending the "softskins" as we call all other races. Upon meeting him, he told me his story, and inspired me to join him in the Call of Honour, a guild of like minded warriors seeking to rid Norrath of the greater threats against us.  One I had accepted his call, I returned to my practice, and eventually getting very tired of killing the unyielding number of skeletons, I made my way to the Plane of Knowledge for the first time.  The Plane of Knowledge is hard to describe, picture a giant floating library, with stores and banks all around it, as adventurers pass through seeking to fuel their knowledge of magic, or to barter their magics with others. Many even gave young adventurer's free enhancements for battle. I was impressed by the charity of many in this place. But I also heard this place was a crossroads to connect me to any location I needed to go quicker than any boat could promise. So I touched the Kelethin Stone, it felt as if a lightning bolt hit me, and then I was standing just outside the tree city.  It was here I met a powerful barbarian named Finaid, I gave him my assistance for I felt with two strong sets of hands we could destroy the orcs, and possibly gain me enough favor to one day enter the city of Kelethin, if anything out of convienance, not out of compassion. Finaid was mighty indeed and we slayed many Orc's for countless seasons together.  Eventually I had heard that my brother had finally left the nest as well, and that Shasthis was working toward earning the respect of his warder. I found him hunting the same forest city that I had when I first got out of the nest. When I got there, I found that he had grown through many seasons without my knowing it, and so I allied with my brother as we as a duo killed many more orc than we could have alone. We entered the corrupted city of Crushbone, and we began to slay the Orcish slavers, my brother gained many more seasons under my watchful eye.   Later that evening I had heard word that my Sister had just been granter her leave from the necromancer's tower, and that she could now practice her arts on the world at large, and not just in chantries within the walls of Cabalis. We met her at the Knowledge book inside Greater Faydark, and we watched over her first few seasons. She has been tutored more in the ways of the noble iksar necromancers, and because of this has an intense hatred for living softskins than me and Shasthis.  After a few close calls, my sister decided to make camp, so we went to the Plane of knowledge, and made camp, while my brother Shasthis said he needed to finish a few things, probably testing his skills with his new warder he had earned that day. I bid him farewell, and made camp.  The next day we awoke we discovered that my other brother Shaszaak had left the nest and began to hone his fighting techniques in the ways of the monk. Shaclas our sister and Shaszaak joined forces against the vile orcs while Shasthis and I joined forces to keep watch over our brethren. I almost neglected to mention that I had met once again the mighty Kretais, a mystic elder shaman. I knelt in reverence to him, for any one strong enough to wield that much power deserved to be shown respect, even if they are a softskin. My sister and brother shaszaak didn't believe this so, and my sister told me that Shamans are soft, and challenged my life. I told her that she should not challenge the power of a shaman at her age, but her naivity won out over my wisdom.   I accepted her challenge, and promptly slowed her and blinded her, she managed to hit me with her diseases, but they had no effect on my health. I kept her blinded and repeatedly struck her in the back of the head, as I saw her swaying about to topple over, I held fast, and informed her that if she wished to stay conscious, she would yield and call off her annoying skeleton ally, I also wanted to make sure she was still strong with the enhancements the mighty kretais had laid upon us. She did yield, and we all received the blessing of temperence from Halzor, a dwarven ally from the Call of Honour. I exchanged his gift for my control over the spirit of wolf. and he left us there.   We went back into battle against the orcs, and my lesser brethren gained a few seasons, despite the best efforts of the softskins in Crushbone to antagonize the orcs and deliver them to us. We proved those softskins that we iksar are far stronger than they are, and we slaughtered all that they brought. Only one of us fell in battle, my brother Shazaak, I mourned his loss, and felt the deep rooted iksar anger against the Softskins, but I learned in my shaman training that Anger is much like any spirit, and can be controlled with enough effort, and I held my tongue.  Eventually the greedy softskins left no quarry for us, and there was nothing left to hunt in Crushbone. We made camp that night, determined to make a better day of it tomorrow.   We have ruled Norrath before, know your place softskinsss, Shactolas

						   I started this day in Cabilis after being recently liberated from the dungeons of Gloomingdeep. Being only my 3rd season I began to wander and eventually found myself once again outside the city walls. Having recently been captured I made my way cautiously into the land of Kunark. As I wandered I came upon a stone book mounted upon a pedastal and as I touched I was whisked way to an unknown land.  Fear is the strength of the Iksar thus I did not fear but I was still startled by all the noise and ... the Softskins! They were everywhere! Having the memory of the teachery of those first softskins to land on Kunark I was terrified but then I saw a familiar face. Deltree, The Great Feral Lord, basking in the sun in his alabaster robe.  As I approached the great lord he turned to address me, me a young broodling without anything but a dagger, and invited me to join the estemed guild Call of Honour. I immediately accepted having heard many of the exploits of this great guild and being aware of how selective they were of their members. Deltree then blessed me with the best spells my young form could take and I commenced my hunt.  During my time in this land, which I learned was called the Plane of Knowledge, I heard of a place called Crushbone on the continent Faydwer and of the vile orcs that live there. Appearently they were mounting an attack on the elves in the woods of Faydark. Now not that I care anything of the elves the thought of battle excited me and I traveled to the woods of Greater Faydark. It was here the next six seasons passed slaughtering endless patrols and camps of orcs. As my ninth season drew to a close I learned that another of my siblings had hatched so I raced back to Cabilis to greet my new sister and to show my guildmasters I was ready to receive training in the arts of healing and enhancment and receive my first Scaled Wolf.   Shasthis Ironscale Norrath is mine for the taking stay out of my way and you shall live ... for a time

						   Within these pages are inscribed the tales of the House of Ironscale. Noble and powerful Iksars of the 6th age of Norrath.  The eldest of the Ironscales is Shactolas. A shaman of Cazic-Thule and pupil of the Mystic Kretais. Inducted into the guild Call of Honour by the noble Feral Lord Deltree, who has always been a great ally of the House of Ironscale.  Second hatched is the ferocious Shasthis. Never one to be content with one path he has studied the ways of shaman and of monks. Finally with the guidance of Deltree and his brother Shactolas he decided to follow the path of the Beastlords and raise is very own Scaled Wolf named Scooter.  The youngest of the line hatched late and greatly consern to Shactolas, Shasthis and their mother for they feared these two broodlings would not make it. But Cazic-Thule inspired fear in these young ones that drove them from there shells and so were hatched Shaclas and Shaszaak.  Shaclas, third hatched and only female in the brood, never acquired and interest in the physical combet her brothers enjoyed and thus began to study the art of necromancy under the supervision of a 47th season Iksar named Rmdir.  The youngest Ironscale, Shaszaak, always had a nack for getting in to trouble. So he was sent to train with the Iksar monks in order to hone his energy and recklessness.

						   It has been very trying without my companions, yet I trudge on. I have a mission and a quest from Brell. I have taken many adventures from the Wayfarers Brotherhood and in all of them I am overcome with a sense of loss for my companions. It simply seems that no one else of Norrath wishes to help me in my quest. They are all greedy for fame, riches or magical jewels. I am now at a loss.   Though there is one Shadow Knight, a dark elf that beings my hope and joy. His teasing taunting have showed me that even outside of my former companions the people of Norrath can stand up to the evil and wish to overcome it. His name is Sivius. We have done many adventures together in the dungeons under Norrath and we plan to do many more.   There have been groups with us that seem to want to perish us all. Yet with Sivius I have not perished yet and neither has he. There are some arrogant fighters and spell casters in Norrath that seem to believe that they can accomplish everything themselves without the help of others. There was a barbarian warrior who would pull massive mobs when all were low on energy. He did meet his doom a few too many times; however Brell told me that he chooses his own destiny and that I should heal the others before him. I felt bad however I did as Brell told me. There was also a wizard who told us repeatedly that she can take on a dungeon by herself alone. A few hours later I saw many of her bodies that Brell did not see fit to bring back to life lying outside a cave. I believe Brell has taught her humility.  I will rest now and rejoin with Sivius tomorrow for more adventures, he is very persistent and willing to join me on my quest. It is a very nice change from the eager for fame population that lives on Norrath.  Akcron – Ziggur! Wait for Backup!!

						   I have made an entire circle and have my new spells while awaiting the return of my group. I did not know that so many of the people that live on Norrath or not inclined to help me in my noble quest. Perhaps I am still a little young with the high hopes and ambitions of the young, yet it was a shock to meet those that did not wish to smite the evil to protect the young, helpless and innocent.   I met an Iksar the first night without Ziggur and my companions, we were going to go to Dulak harbor to clear the beach. I know that Iksars are supposed to be mean and ferocious beasts however I have met many, such as Delltree, that I trusted him with my life. I was wrong. As we were swimming to the beach I yelled out to him not to swim to fast because I can not swim too well. Yet he trudged on with out me. I yelled that I am frail and have met my demise many a time on this beach, yet he still left me. There were many undead there and they all did not like intruders. I did the best that I could yet I still met a valiant doom. When Brell kindly brought me back to the Plane of Knowledge I contacted the Iksar, he had fallen fast asleep under the waters of the beach. I was not impressed. I contacted my ally’s and they retrieved my belongings for me. They were slightly concerned that I would not make it on my own however I told them that with Brells wisdom and faith I can accomplish anything.   And so I picked myself up and carried on.  -- Akcron --- Ziggur! Wait for Backup!!

						   This day has gone well. The evils at the castle have been eliminated. The spiders have been squished and the orcs that were present have been dealt with accordingly. It did not take too long to accomplish this with my trusty group of Ziggur, Kretais and Ellektra. They have done their jobs to the best that anyone could imagine and we had a wonderful time knowing that our deeds were the most noble of all on Norrath.  At the end of the day however I received some terrible news. Ziggur, Kretais and Ellektra will be leaving me for a short time. They must attain a brilliant sword called the SoulFire to enable Ziggur to be the best Paladin ever known. This saddened me and for a second I feared that I will be unable to meet my goals of cleansing the evil on Norrath. However, Brell shined upon me and told me that while my companions are indeed leaving on another equally important quest that the Wayfarers Brotherhood still had a need for me and its own evil to eliminate. I was proud to know that even without my beloved group that I can still commit to my quest. At that I bid my group adue and wished them on their way.

						   This day was started again near the Dark Kastanor Castle. I shiver even at the thought of entering, remembering the pain that it brought to me and my companions. I vowed to myself right then that no one should fear such things and that when my companions and I are ready we will smite every creature that sets foot on that ground with an evil thought in his mind. But, now we must get stronger. We head past the castle to a giant fortress where large dark humanoids breed their young and teach them the ways of all the dark gods and goddesses. I feel sorry for the young ones that my compainions slaughter yet I know what they will grow up to be and am grateful that I am saving them the tragedy of serving one that is not Brell. This takes us a long time, yet we are successfull. Kretais, Ziggur and I agree that we should contact the Wayfarers Brotherhood to see if they have any use of our abilities. I am ashamed that it has been so long since we have asked them, yet there are many evils in the world and we have been busy.  Kretais then called upon his powers and made us all as light as a feather. Before I knew it I was levitating. I had no idea it was so much fun to fly in the sky. I could see the world and the mountains, the slight sunset on the eastern horizon. I felt that with one long hard bellow I could cure the world simply by shouting my prayers. All the evil creatures would turn thier heads and listen immediatly putting down thier swords and maces and taking up a book of Brell. I was ashamed at my naivite yet it was a wonderous and emignatic feeling of power. Though I must admit that I like being little and so close to the ground. Ziggur and Kretais miss out on so much that I see from my small stature. Such as did you know ants and other small bugs have the cutest little faces? Everyone should bend down and take a look, it might bother you to step on such small creatures.  Brell has blessed me yet again with new spells and abilities that I will put to good use. I picked these up on my way to the Wayfarers Camp where they told me of a great evil in one of the many dungeons on Norrath. It seems that the evil is starting to creep slowly into Lesser Faydark and they thought that these creatures are just right for me, Ziggur and a few other companions to smite. I agreed and contacted Ziggur, his beastlord friend, another paladin and a ranger to help. We went through the dungeon smoothly and with ease. These creatures were of no match for Brell's powers in our group. We take care of this in less than an hour and are on our way again to the Kastanor Castle eager to beat this evil once and for all.

						   Our journeys have been successful, perhaps too successful. The evil creatures that we have been fighting have found a particular hatred for me. I have been smited down time and time again. My companions are bewildered they have all tried to protect me to the best of their abilities however the evil in this Castle is just too strong.   We have camped here for more than a week, every day that I rise I pray to Brell for safety however I don’t believe he hears my pleas. The guards of the castle are just too strong for any of our endeavors and we have yet to triumph. I fear that perhaps my companions and I are too weak to clear the evil of this place. We have succeeded in a number of these dark creatures yet there are more to dispel.   Kretais the sage of our group has decided that we must first level and gain more power by smiting lower evils first then return to this Dark Castle to clear this castle. Ziggur, my dear friend, has also ran to the Bazaar to buy me better armor. He fears that the evil ones everywhere might wish me harm.   Pray for us all,   Ackron – Ziggur!

						   I was a cleric. Clothed in nothing but a flimsy robe and Brell, yet I was still young and with the ideals of one so young and naive. I will cure the world of all the pain and suffering it could have. I didnt think there would be so much. I traveled with a few friends of mine in the begining, ranging from an Froglok wizard, Ribbikolos, to one of my close friends an Iksar shaman named Shaktolas, both have since moved on.   I met my closest friend a paladin named Ziggur in about my 10th rotation. He also feels the innermost need to cure the world of pain and suffering. He introduced me to all of my current companions in the guild of Call of Honour. There are two Vah Shirs, a shaman named Kretais and Konath a warrior. However, I find that Ziggur needs the most of my attention. He is a wonderful companion and bodyguard, yet I find that, like myself, he puts his own life as forfeit for others to live. We ran along Norrath for many years together clearing the world of all that is evil, however as I roamed I found that evil is everywhere that I go. No matter how big the Call of Honour becomes the evil will always be bigger. Yet, we can try and what we dispell will never come back again. Their cousins and sons might, but they certainly will not.   Along the way we also picked up a few more for our journey, another paladin name Katheena and a Dark Elf named Ellektra. Both are essential for our plans. Ellektra, though her race is not one known for good has been convinced of our mission. Brell has even blessed her with the ability to mezmerize the fierce creatures that we fight so that I can heal our companions. Katheena is also essential, though not yet as strong as our Ziggur and Konath, she will soon be able to kill the monstors as swiftly as they.  For now, I must go. Tommorrow we are going to Lower Gukta to kill the Arch Magi. Ellektra needs a robe that a certain Magi drops so that she may be a more effective enchanter. I also hear that it is a prime place to clear out the undead of the area.  Akcron --- Ziggur! Wait for Backup!

						   Gnomes believe that they are the best thing since Brell. However I slightly disagree. My father, mother and all of my 6 siblings are tinkerers. They make the tinkering merchants, suppliers and other handy tinks for my city. I personally hate them. They are loud and they break. Yes, they are a good idea and all but what if you just want an ale and some company! I hate drinking ale alone, its depressing. Yet when the families away or busy and I want an ale just try to find a live human being. I told this to my father once and he made me a talking tinker toy. He doesnt have much of a brain and only say 5 things. 'Hi', 'Bye', 'Come back soon','How are you today?' and 'Missed you while you were gone.' Hard to have a conversation of deep thought within those capasities. I tried to program it to be smarter, know a little about nature, gnomes and philosophy. Totally broke but I'm not so sad about it. One time when I was young I told my mother I wanted a pet. Something to love, hold and take care of. I personally wanted a young dire wolf puppy. I thought that if I took care of him just right then he would love me and never grow up to eat me or any other gnome. I thought that after that he could go out into Rivervale and tell all the other dire wolves that gnomes are nice and wonderful and not eat them. My parents didn't agree with this and so my father, mother and siblings all made me a tinker puppy. Who wants a clanky metal puppy when nice warm fluffy ones are right outside thier city?  My mother sat me down one day. I was slightly lit and bashed so gnomes, my city, those blasted toy and the world at large. She was repulsed, she thought that something might be wrong with my head. My father came in on half the bout as well, he thought that I was accursed and perhaps not a gnome at all. They didnt know what to do with me. If I was of an uncivilized race then I probably would have died, however gnomes really are not that violent. My bags were packed the next day and I was off to the nearest School of Brell. I wasnt too pleased as I too was set in my ways of long nights with an ale bottle and mornings that dont exist, yet at least here I could talk to living beings.   There I learned to be cleric of Brell. Fantsy that. Me, Ackron, the gnome voted "One With the Least Potential" was a cleric. I studied hard and found the entire dogma absolutly fasinating. I was entranced. Soon I learned how to call upon the favor of Brell for healing and power. I was also taught that some used this power for evil yet I swore to never do so. I still am young and even cry when I stub my toe. Pain is terrible and I will cure all the pain in Norrath if I must die a thousand times to do so.  Ackron -- Ziggur! Wait for Backup!

						   Sivius and I have become fast friends. We have done many adventures together yet none are more memorable than the fast paced action of Neriak and Dulak.  The night before we were fighting hordes of green balding undead in Neriak. All was seemingly well and my energies were staying in fine accord. I was beginning to daydream when I noticed all of the party was being swarmed by at least twenty of the evil monstrous hordes. I casted my new complete heal on them one at a time, thinking that Sivius, as strong as Ziggur could last till the end. When I finally got to my companion he was in dire straights. I casted complete heal which takes a while to catch hold. The monster was swinging at him time and time again it was all that I could do not to run up to distract the monster with my own capabilities, yes Sivius needed my heal so I concentrated hard on my powers and prayed to Brell for mercy. He fell then yet my backup healer was on the toes and he rose again within minutes beating the remaining enraged monster with all the might of my previous companions. Just as he was about to fall again. I felt the spell lift off of me and onto the shoulders of Sivius closing his wounds and giving him that spark of life. The beast was slayed within seconds.  There was another night of sheer anxiety and terror in Dulak. I had just gotten my complete healing spell and was with Sivius and Ziggur both who had decided on this night that he would like to meet Sivius to make sure that I was in good hands. Ziggur pulled one of his namesake pulls that we have dubbed the ‘Ziggur Pull.’ With many orcan pirates on his trail he ran to our camping grounds. He reached us only minorly wounded and Sivius ran to pull some of the creatures off of him. I healed them time and time again yet my energy was running low and there were still many monsters to slay.  I begged them to flee however they would not. I pulled out my spell book and quickly remembered the lesser healing spells of my youth and started healing with those. Yet they were not sufficient. With my energy at its lowest Ziggur slew the last monster and cried ‘Break!’  This was a good day for that night Ziggur, Kretais and I were together again and I received my Temperance spell. Ziggur looks mightier now with bigger muscles and new spells that he has learned. I can’t quite place it yet there is something ‘more’ to Ziggur now then there was before. However I will put that out of my mind and simply revel in having them both back in my camp with the new addition of Sivius.  Akcron – Ziggur! Wait for Backup!!!

      I was summoned to assist Kredien in mastering his next circle of spells. I am not even a wizard yet I get instructed by my god to assist him, obviously I have done something wrong for my god to hate me more than usual. So I meet up with the frilly High Elf, and I show him the way I slaughter my enemies with my newly found 4rd circle of spells. he was impressed, and eventually decided to show me his abilities. After a few moments of this, he achieved the enlightenment needed to use his own 4th circle of spells.  &nbsp; After this, he wanted to try out his area of effect spells, I decide to let him. Never let High Elves play with their new found power, they will kill us dark elves, however unintentional it may appear. And they dance on our bodies, I've never seen them do it, but I know secretly that they do enjoy this. At least he was useful enough to drag my body back to the Plane of Knowledge book for me to recover my materials. Then he made the second foolish mistake, deciding that we go to Paludal Caverns. I unfortunately being foolish myself and quite mad with power decide to agree and go with.  &nbsp; When we arrived we had to avoid many fiendish mushrooms and rogues, before we arrived at the Phlargs, which my ally seemed heartset to kill. the first one we took out placed a foul disease on us, and nearly killed my skeletal minion, I asked Kredien if he had the money for the coffin's we would probably need to get our bodies back out of here if we fail. He said he did, I nearly used all of my powers to kill the phlarg. Then my ally decides we might need some curative potions for disease, I agree and he leaves.  &nbsp; Unfortunately I got a bit carried away and did I mention I was a little power mad? thinking I could take on the world with enough poison and disease. I attempted to take on a phlarg in a duel, I lost, and it tossed my body in the river. Took some time to retreive, which I did under invisibility. Then when I got back, Kredien was back with the curative potions, and we took out another couple of phlargs, before a wandering phlarg snuck up behind Kredien, and before I could warn him, it killed kredien and began to hunt for me.I ran it and others back, and shouted to all who could hear me to clear the way to Shadowhaven, for I was running back there to survive. Apparently Kredien had just gotten in the way as I had made it to Shadowhaven, and died again. All the costs of our folly I suppose.&nbsp;I hope my god does not ask me to go out with this power mad wizard again, I think I've learned my lesson about being a bit less egotistical. But if Innoruuk commands it so, then so shall I serve. &nbsp; &nbsp; Love is a weakness, it must be shown behind closed doors, Qaz

      It has been a while since my last journal entry, not much has changed. I met another ally in the Call of Honour, a High Elf Wizard, another useful tool, I find wizards are quite handy when taking on larger hunts. But today I found my true power, I have mastered what the elder Necromancers refer to as fear-kiting  The art is intense as a lot of things have to go correctly, and the only reason I had failed it before was my inexperience with casting my spells, my spells kept fizzling out and soon I'd be out of mana, and out of life. The technique involved casting darkness upon my prey, and then as it's coming for me I send my skeletal minion to attack, while my minion is heading towards it I immediately cast my fear spell on it to send it running away, after my fear lands I poison the monster and then suck it's life into my own if I am weak. The slowed monster can't possibly escape my minion, and the poison whittles the monster down into nothingness while my minion kills it. I have also found that if I commit to the dark pact, and let me life force be drained for benefit of my mana, that I can perform this kiting much longer than I could without it.  I used this method while the others were too low on mana to do anything constructive, and when they were ready, the wizard would hit the quarry with his powerful fire spell, and my pet would keep the prey away from us. I could then poison it while the shaman slowed it.   Before we left for the evening the Wizard wanted to test his Area of Effect spells. so I pulled 2 giant scorpions upon us, both of them higher in strength than I, and the wizard then held them in place, and hit them both with fire, while I hit both with my darkness and poison. my pet dispatched one easily, and the other went down almost as fast.  I have learned my power and that I do not depend on anyone to survive, however, the more useful allies I have on my side, the larger enemies will be that much easier to feast upon.  Love is a weakness, it must be shown behind closed doors, Qaz

      I do not know why I haven't described my thoughts in a journal before. It would make sense to keep things organized. Perhaps the reason I chose not to write one so early was that as a young Tier'Dal Necromancer, I feared my notes may be discovered and used against me by my own kind. Now that I've entered the 8th season and achieved the 3rd circle of necromancy spells, I no longer fear this as much. I understand that there are still many more Tier'Dal who are more seasoned than I am, but I now understand the concept of making plans against your superiors, without making them openly known.   Anything I publish can be safely hidden, as can I, for I have now achieved the art of manipulating shadow. This is a powerful tool that even the mighty wizards do not achieve until their 16th season and their 5th circle of spells. I practiced this art last night with my ally Kretero, and Sazlan. I will now publish what I have discovered since I began my travels.  Neriak, is a place only Tier'Dal could love, it is highly convoluted and the first time wanderer into the gates and even some of our elderly still get lost inside the city. I would say it's not overly convoluted as I have heard Ak'Anon is, it will be the Gnome's folly when they become trapped inside their own city due to their overly complicated construction.   The first day I left my home, I met up with Kretero, a fellow Tier'Dal Wizard, whose power could augment my ability to eliminate our enemies. So I formed an alliance, and he made use of his powerful ice spells while I used my basic spells to poison our enemy. I also met up with a mage, named Konaddar, a high elf who must be so ignorant to ignore our races long standing blood feud. That aside, he is a very useful tool in the battles ahead, and as I come to know him more, I find that he isn't as repulsive as the rest of his kind, most of them have a superiority complex, because they forget that we were born of the first king and queen of his kind, augmented by the sheer power of Innoruuk. We are better than them, they just fail to realize it, as they stare blankly refusing to see the truth. This works to our advantage of course.  I made it to my fourth season 2nd rank with these two spell casters, before they had to leave. Later someone must have been watching over me(I assume it was the Tier'dal ally for he was higher circle in his spells than I was and had the contacts to do this) for a Cleric of Brell came to my aide! A cleric of Brell! Unheard of that a cleric of brell would ignore the fact that I am a servant of Innoruuk. But this gnome seems to be one of those that gives freely of herself, yet another tool at my disposal, and a good tool at that, she had to be at least 9 circles in her spells! I appreciate a useful tool, and Akcron assisted me through to my 7th season before leaving me to assist some dwarf ally of hers.   While I was in my 7th season, a associate of the Call of Honour invited me into their ranks. It was a guild of adventuring parties, of whom Kretero had told me of. They are an honorable group, and as Kretero explained to me one day, it is often safer to make friends with those less ambitious than yourself, for they will often save you from those more ambitious than you. Such wisdom, it is no wonder that Wizards are regarded highly by most. So I made alliance with Call of Honour, it turns out their ranks include all races great and small. I was surprised by the diversity. It is indeed wise to befriend those that will have you, as long as they do not attempt to claim sovereignty over you.   I spent some of my 7th Season on expedition in the Field of Bone, and I must document I have discovered an odd dungeon just beyond the desert. Inside were many spiders my construct had no problems dispatching, however there was 1 golden spider, further research turned it up as a Burnai-bane spider or some such, whose fangs are capable of setting the blood to boil for a short time. I broke a fang off and tossed my old dagger to the side. This is a much more useful tool. I also found the ruins in the Field of Bone amazing, from what I understand this area was ravaged in a war between the Iksar and the Dragons. Cabalis used to be a majestic city, is not nothing but a bowl with ruins around it.   Finished my 8th season and 3rd rank of Necromancy with my ally Kretero, and last night I gathered my spells I required for my rank. Sazlan, a Vah Shir Shaman, whom which I must say has features that please the eye, joined Kretero and I in assaulting the Field of Bone again. Armed with my new spells that take my life for my mana, and a stronger pet, we were assaulting larger enemies than we had before. An Iksar Monk, a Gnome Wizard and a Gnome Cleric all joined our group in assaulting the scorpions in the field. We even attempted to fight the evil giant Burnyai, a badger like creature. And we lost a few lives to that account.  I shall continue to document my travels and those that I meet, for any who find this tome when I perish, may be able to make use of those allies of mine that are still alive.   Love is a weakness, it must be shown behind closed doors, Qaz

      Many day cycles have passed since I have written in this journal, I'm well into my 20th season of exploration. The unity between my mind and my body has strengthened further as of late, as now I can consume my flesh to fuel my mind at a faster rate, allowing me to perform my tasks easier, and with less rest in between battles.  Once I had reached 16th season, I began my hunt in the Paludal Caverns in earnest, where before I was dying more than I was living, I now thrive. Since none of the foolish recondite camp raiders will invite me to assist them, and the ones that do have been nothing but trouble. I hunt the phlarg fiends, with my skeletal assistant I can handle them very easily now, though their disease is quite potent.  I have reached 20th season now with the aide of a Mage who came to assist me, a friend of Mheat's, a person I met and befriended in the recondite camps the one time that I got invited. The mage was powerful and it seemed as though we could take on three or more at a time with this combination. We were successful at getting my 20th season accomplished even with the set backs of being what people in common parlance call "trained".  Afterwards I gated to Shadowhaven and made way to the Plane of Knowledge as I had missed picking up my latest summoning spell from the vendors there. With it, I shall be even more powerful.

Draft Progression of Life on Oerth - Show progression of life forms on earth, which race eldest etc. Complete with standard elder dragon race, with a new twist that I have not seen in other Campaigns.  Draft intial cities and city historys - placement of cities on the world map that are consistent with the logical placement of real world cities. Complete with most popular cities, including trade routes and trade good lists to show supply and demand for each city.   Draft history of government agency - royal lineage of current ruling body, as well as older ruling systems - 25% complete, royal lineage of Everwind complete, other continental lineages will have to be established along with noble families, and previous governing structure.  Draft Key Non-Player Characters in this story - create the NPC story drivers, the main NPC's and their motivations - 50% complete  Draft overall campaign overview explaining what should happen in a "win" scenario - details out what will happen if the players succeed in stopping the evil on Everwind. - complete  Draft overall campaign overview explaining what should happen in a "lose" scenario - details the consequences for failure to stop the evil on Everwind, or to assist in it's taking over. - 0% complete  Draft Campaign goals and setup campaign timeline - setup the milestones that the campaign will try to attain during game play, including key points that reveal the overall plot - complete with fairly detailed key points.  Draft maps for main points of the campaign - draw rough maps of the areas that players will be exploring - 5% complete  Compile drafts into the Game World Development Software - compile all relevante data into the Roleplaying Master Game World Organizer - 1% complete  This is all the requirements of the drafting stage. Many of these steps have been completed in notes and MS Word and have yet to be migrated to the game organizer. After the drafting stage, we will refine all of these items above to create a cohesive and believeable game world. I will not stop on this project until it is an excellent adventure. More detail on the development on this game world will continue later.

      Nefarnomicon is a Dungeons and Dragons 3.x Adventure/Game World&nbsp;being composed by Phoenix, and Edited by Akcron. it is an epic level Game World, with the included adventure being focused around the Continent of Everwind, a continent darkened by the evil that has spread nearly coast to coast. This world does make use of characters from a friends previous game session notes and fleshes out the campaign into an all encompassing battle against the players, and the planes. As yet mostly unwritten, this blog will document progress towards the goal of completion, in which play testing the campaign with friends will commence, and then if proven viable, a PDF of the game world will be delivered to Dungeons and Dragon's World Publishers for review, if approved, I will have accomplished my dream of writing a successfully published book.

      Decided as an additional twist to the campaign of Nefarnomicon I would bring the Sun God Taiia slightly closer to the edge between being obscure and staring the players right in the face today. Taiia is supposed to be an unknown god to the Characters of Nefarnomicon, a forgotten legend that only the Dragons keep. So with it being unknown that she is in fact a god, and the creator of the entire world, the humans fear of their sun growing into a cold blue orb is less than what it should. But I intend to reveal to the player characters little further than midway into the campaign of this fact, and that the sun goddess Taiia is dying, her energies being stolen by a powerful shadowmancy spell. A curse that can only be lifted once the proper incantation is found and dispelled. That incantation is written inside the Nefarnomicon. I'm pretty sure the book itself should create a ton more adventure sidelines once it's in the players hands, but I'm certainly not going to just give it to them. That would be folly. but that's my current note for today. I think it'll go over particularly well in game. I'm really aiming for this to be a captivating world full of incredible and fascinating things.

      Mood: indifferent and Tired  So goes a typical morning here at work. Only problem is that I was 30 minutes late today :( I hate alarm clocks, they need to be more precise, this is not to say that they aren't precise about the original alarm going off, but it seems once you hit that snooze button, life becomes a gamble. Will it go off, and when? I don't think it's too much to ask for a snooze button that is reliable(will always go off again) and consistent(will go off at X minutes later). Oh well, I woke up to it at 9am, could've gotten up then. But I still blame the thing for not going off early enough. I got up at 10:57am, 3 minutes before work, it takes 5 minutes to get to work, and it takes my fam about 15 minutes to prepare for work on a rush day.  Hate alarm clocks, absolutely hate them. Anyway, Played more EQ last night after eating some corn dogs. Things went well, but I about passed out while playing, and that's never fun. Was just totally drained. Had to call off our hunt on pirates, though we did get some diamonds and other high sell items, we each ended up with 75 platinum, not a bad haul. Put my character on Trader last night to try and sell some velium I had on me(very pricey ore sells really high) but apparently my internet was going wonkie, cycled the router today and resetup my trader in EQ, so hopefully he stays up tonight, and when I get home, I hope to see mountains of money :)  Anyway, typical day on the helpdesk, they've put me on the Customer Service side(I've done both and like Tech better) which is alright, except the angry customers hunting for money, but that's only a small portion of my calls. the rest are definitely getting all mixed up in our systems and I have to unravel the strands to get them back on track. There's rarely a wait on my line, so most of my time I'm sitting here relaxing and writing stuff like this :)   More to come as it happens.  Please try not to feed the stupid people, Phoenix Malakai

      Okay, new blog from a new blogger. Don't cringe yet, I'm sure you'll find something interesting here. Now I figure it's time to give you the run down on who I am to give you a frame of reference for future posts.  I'm a 21 year old ex-Air Force Computer Programmer turned Internet Helpdesk. I have a fiance SammyCaine, and a kid very close to hitting the 2yr old mark. I was a goth in my teenage years, and still have that angsty goodness in my soul, just doesn't come around as much. Been using a computer since I was 4, been playing role playing games since I was 18 in the Air Force.  hopefully that helps a little bit in understanding what makes me who I am. This was supposed to be yesterdays little opening blurb, but it didn't happen. Why? because the best of plans will certainly fail. I actually didn't give myself enough time while at work to publish this. So we're gonna do a dual day post :)   Someone might ask, why didn't I finish this post last night after work? because my computer dumped on me. OS had been about:blank hijacked, and so I did a lot of headscratching all week, tried to run a few simple commands that reset the OS back to stabilityville, and hopefully nuke that lil trojan out of my computer. But instead, it took out the whole system. Typical. so last night I spent reloading all my critical stuff(Windows, Windows Updates, Motherboard drivers and utilities, all other system drivers, Anti-Virus, and Office) then making sure I could still access Everquest.  Forgot to mention that I play everquest, I know. Some of you will probably shun me for that, I don't care, it's more complex than just picking up a box at the store and playing it. But I'll leave that to a seperate post. Wanna try to keep on track of this post, which is about what happened yesterday(since it's extremely tough to write about today today, I mean, how much is there to say about a day just started?  So last night, SammyCaine was sick, so she didn't get to partake in the action last night, she was watching TV snuggled in blankets. Very cute, while I was right behind her, playing my Dwarf Paladin trying to hit level 40. This was optimal since I could tend to her needs, and get my fix. About 3 hours of play later, I hit 40 with my paladin, I was very happy since I have a weapon that does something special at 40, it heals my character 7% whenever the effect triggers.  After that, and not realizing it was 3am, I decided to play my necromancer to get his level 8. did that as well. Logged off and went to bed around 4am. This is the life of an EQ junkie.  This morning, woke up to kicks from the fiance to get up, at 8am :( needless to say I'm not the most chipper person in morning hours, especially after doing a all night burn on EQ. So I growled and moaned about sleep, got up, changed the kid. brought him into our room while I tried to feign comatose on the bed, that didn't work either. Sick people have this kind of special pitch of whine that prohibits doing anything other than assisting them in their endeavor. So out of bed I go, grumbling all the way at 9:00am, to get myself and the kid some breakfast(Kix for him yech, and Cracklin Oat Bran for me!) read some webcomics, and sleepdrove to Sammycaine's father's house, to deliver the kiddo to them.   Now I have my peace, my alone time, I'm kind of a car guy, I like cars, fast cars. I drive a Dodge Stratus ES, with Autostick. So I'm bumping out the Need For Speed Underground soundtrack through my car stereo with the windows down and the autostick engaged, doing some high intensity driving to work. which unfortunately is only 10 minutes away, but this kind of thing wakes me up, gets the blood flowing.   Work has been light enough today for me to write over 90% more today than I did yesterday. Go Figure.  For the curious I'll leave you all with a list of my webcomics I read day to day.  urlLink User Friendly  - a ISP tech comic  urlLink pvp online  = a game magazine behind the scenes comic  urlLink NuklearPower  - original final fantasy with a humorous twist  urlLink Penny Arcade  Penny Arcade, a twisted vantage on Gaming  urlLink MegaTokyo  - an Anime style gaming oriented comic  urlLink /GU Comics  - A MMORPG Comic  urlLink WTF Comics  - a Everquest related Comic   everyone try not to feed the stupid people...

      In my previous article I mentioned I play everquest, and that the reason behind my everquest playing was more complicated than a person merely wishing to play something and buying it from the store. Let me go into detail on what brought me to this addictive entertaining game.  For those that do not know, Everquest is a online game, a game you play with multiple people from all over the internet. It carries a monthly fee of $12.95. It is a roleplaying game, or a game where you play as someone potentially different than yourself acheiving goals to progress the game story as a whole. There is no clear way to "win", you make the decision as to whether you are winning in terms of how satisfied you are with each play session.  I had at one point in time told myself I would never pay money to buy a game, then pay money to play it per month. I decided that this was a waste of money because there are plenty of free games to play online, where all you pay for is the original software. This attitude changed however because of a friend of mine.  This friend is one of my old buddies from when I was in the military. we used to gather weekly for Dungeons and Dragons which I ran, and he was a really cool individual. He is a Air Traffic Controller for the Air Force. Well eventually he got called to duty in Iraq maintaining the bagdad air field. He was gone for many months, and every month he was there I worried about his welfare.   Eventually he did come home, and he let me know that he was back. I was excited to see him again! First night he returned and was settled in enough he came by, while SammyCaine was with her dad wasting his money away at the casinos in Iowa. He brought his computer as we figured we might hook up to my internet service, and play some games or something. When he arrived, he brought Everquest with him, the Planes of Power Disc to be specific. He had told me at that time that if I wanted I could install it and play with him on it and that it was free for the first month, and if I didn't like it I could give him back the discs and the account and he'd give it to another person. Since there was apparently no risk to this scenario, I decided what the heck, I would find out what all the hype was about.  I installed Everquest, patch took 20 minutes or so, while it was doing that we played a little hockey on my Playstation 2. Then we eventually got my account setup. We both decided to play new characters(as he was a long time player of the game) on the server he specified. That night I setup a human Monk(melee class style of play) and he setup a human Wizard, and we started in the same city. it went okay first night, we played a bit had a decent time trying to kill things we should've known not to, and we got offline for the night.   The next day was a day off, I think I had a 3 day weekend, and my friend had to run errands. So bored but semi-fascinated by this game, I decided to create a new character just for myself to play on. I built a Male Dwarf Paladin named Ziggur. Paladin's seemed kind of cool, and I like dwarves, so I thought why not. played that character for a while, and noticed how much more fun this character was, not to mention I started doing quests, which are little missions that garner decent rewards in everquest. When my buddy returned for the night, he decided it would be more fun to play with my paladin than my monk, so I scrapped the monk and played the Paladin all the time while he was there.   Turns out that my friend was stationed with a guy in an Everquest guild(a group of players playing together to acheive greater goals) and he got us invited in. This dramatically improved the gameplay experience, as now I had a greater pool of people with who to talk to, who seemed really cool, and were always very helpful for a new player like myself.   Eventually my friend had to go back to the typical military grind, and eventually stopped playing everquest. I however played it for hours every night. So much so, that my fiance began to feel neglected. I had heard of EQ addiction and the effects on the home, so I always kept myself alert to this situation and corrected it everytime it popped up. But eventually I convinced her to try it(after we bought a second computer to play games together online) and she liked it, she liked it so much she bought Everquest evolutions that same night, I had already bought that plus the Lost Dungeons of Norrath to open up all the spots on the Everquest map for me to play with. She was hooked.  Now I've made friends with a warrior and shaman in our guild, and we go out almost every night adventuring. my Dwarf just made level 40 last night and I have 7 other characters, maxing out the number of characters I can play on any given server.   I don't know what my friend is doing now, sometimes I wish he'd stayed playing so we could group together, but he's just that way. playing different MMORPG's and hopping between them as one gets stale. All I can do is thank him for giving us an experience, that my fiance and I can share, and keeps us entertained till way late at night.   Why do I play everquest? It's not the world that keeps me involved, it's the time I spend with good friends exploring that world.   Try not to feed the stupid people... Phoenix

      Well, since I won't be able to play EQ most of the days of the weekend, I've decided I'm going to make some of the utilities to work on my project portable, so I can take them on my USB flash drive to my Father in Laws house to work on my D&D adventure, as well as my website, so hopefully I'll have a website draft finished and ready to post by end of weekend and perhaps the complete background story of my D&amp;D campaign fully drafted and ready to go, depends on how much quiet time I get to do this work. expect more blogs as the weekend continues.

      Don’t let the previous blog from Pheonix fool you. Yes it is true that SOS came within minuets of our phone call. Yes they did make the suffocating AC blow large amounts of air. However it is not nice refreshing cool air. It is warm stagnant air. Our AC is broken. So I called the landlord. I told her my AC thinks it’s a heater and needs moral support and perhaps a psychologist. She told me that she will call SOS again. So I wait and wait. I wait for an hour. Where are my SOS guys, my large staff of people that are just waiting to serve my every need and whim. Where are the people who show up before I even know I have a problem? No where. I call them. They tell me that perhaps they can fix it by next week. They don’t seem to sure of themselves. I ask them why? Perhaps they need moral support, I will defiantly give them moral support to fix my identity challenged AC. They say that some things need to come together. Like what? What kind of an answer is that? ‘Some things need to come together.’ Do they need head? Who do I have to blow to get my AC fixed?  Last night was the worst. I enjoy playing EQ. It’s my lifetime goal to play EQ for an entire night, from kid asleep to kid up time. Oh yeah, that’s my life. Last night however it was 90 in my house and 70 outside. I couldn’t hack it. Perhaps I wasn’t strong enough or maybe my biological needs of fresh air and cool breezes out weighed the health and welfare of my group. I felt bad yet when I went outside for a smoke and felt the sweat that was rolling down my chest and in between my boobs freeze in the cool night breeze and I actually shivered. EQ didn’t have a thing to sitting on the deck outside reveling with nature.  Akcron -- Ziggur! Wait for Backup!!

      Well, despite the best efforts of the speedy SOS Heating and Air person, we are still without AC. Not his fault really, since apparently the Air Conditioner's Compressor is grounding out, or grinding out. If it's grounding out, that would mean the wires that supply the Compressor with power is contacting something else metal, and instead of the electricity getting to the compressor, it's going the quickest route to ground, which is the roof. If it is Grinding out, well then I would guess the compressor Pump's bearings blew out and the pump is grinding and not doing any good. Why the confusion as to which is which? because it seems that Technology Repair Specialists have the mandatory requirement to have the handwriting of Doctors. This is why I type instead of write most of the time, but for some reason, these guys never seem to have a computer capable of printing out an invoice. so instead I get this poorly written slip of paper that says&nbsp; "Compressor is (grounding?/Grinding?) out, Cond. needs Replaced."  The other problem with this is that they didn't give us an estimated time of completion of replacing this equipment. We called our landlord, who is going to call them to kick them in the rear, and we called the SOS ourselves, and their answer to us was they're not sure it'll we fixed all week! and with 85 Degrees all the rest of the week, it's gonna start baking me and my computers :( which sucks. I probably should have turned off my computer, but I didn't, will have to start doing that the rest of the week. hopefully all the fans in my system will keep the system chilled.   What also ticks me off is that I may not be able to play EQ this weekend, because we're taking refuge up in my Father in Law's house, which I assign the standard "nice place to visit" clause. As in, it's a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live there. They only have a PS2 for gaming, the computer is off limits for gaming and even anything short of basic internet access.   Now those who know me know that I cannot live without my computer, I want to at least be productive, but all I can forsee me doing at her dad's place is drooling on the couch watching the kid get in trouble. And frankly that Blows goats, I'd rather go to work than be nothing more than a slave to the child. I have needs to, and I guess they just won't be met this weekend, this weekend will be hell in a cell. might as well be in prison.   Try not to feed the stupid people, Phoenix

      Mood: Refreshed, happy  Finally got sleep last night, we were only going to nap for an hour and join our friends in EQ, but when the pillows were hit, it was ALL over. woke up at 8:30am this morning refreshed and sweaty, because our AC was broken, called the Landlord who then called SOS heating and AC, who showed up not 15 minutes after we called. Very good response, if you live in Nebraska, give them a ring, they do good work.  Anyway, today I'm striving to expand my mind, I'm reading up on Cascading Style Sheets. I'm an old HTML horse, and CSS is too new for me, however I know how XML works, figure that out :P  So I'm surfing the sites about CSS, so that I can practice with it so I can put up the Phoenix Perch Website, which once I do, will be linked here. It's content obviously going to be more static than the information you can find here. Things like my Resume, and Flash Apps and such :D Looking forward to doing some Flash type stuff, I might even make animated EQ comics, who knows, depends on how much time I dedicate to playing with flash apps.  I'll let you know the progress on the website as it happens. till then.   Try not to feed the stupid people Phoenix

      mood: Damn Tired, but happy   3rd night in a row sleep has been so short, I might as well not be sleeping. Past 3 nights I've gotten all of 4 hours of sleep, without a nap the next day. First couple of nights were my fault I admit, last night was just craziness, here I am, all set to go to bed at 2am, which is a perfectly good bed time for me 6 hours of sleep is just fine. Any less and I approach critical mass, start getting headaches and stuff. Kid has a nightmare and starts wailing, and now the house can't get to sleep until he does, which is right around 4am :( not fun.   I wake up at 8am, hit the snooze, thinking, hey, we can live with 30 more minutes of sleep. It turned into 9am without my knowledge, and me and Akcron tear off, we get out the door in less than 15 minutes, and when I get to work I setup my computer while reading the new deadlands book my best buddy gave me, and suddenly, I realized how hard it was to read. couldn't read a damn thing, eyes were blurry for a good 1 1/2 hours before clearing up.   So I've been reading up on deadlands, produced by Pinnacle, it's a pretty interesting tabletop roleplaying game, and I look forward to playing it, I'm going to probably make a couple of characters for the game to see what character I like.   Been in a writing mood lately, I wish I had access to my roleplaying master at work, I'd get more accomplished, but then again I really do need my D&D books to write effectively(as they provide the standard NPC's and major characters of D&amp;D) anyway, this weekend it'll be time to write more for my game, so look at my other blog  urlLink Nefarnomicon  for more information. Also been hungry to write my Website so I may start that task tonight or sometime real soon, going to add it to my Outlook Tasks.  more to come as I think of it.

      I have to admit I am now an addict. Whenever I am at work, eating, giving Zack a bath I think of playing EQ. Even when I am sleeping – I dream of EQ. Last nights dream started like a normal twenty something mom of a toddler dream.   I was riding in the backseat of my Grandparents car with Zack, who for some reason was around two months old. The only minorly strange thing here was that Zack was extremely young and I have seen these particular Grandparents in forever, yet this is normal dream strangeness. So we’re driving down a rode in some unknown ghetto little town and I notice that Zack isn’t buckled into his car seat. This kind of freaked me out because I’m am a slightly paranoid and overprotective mom. So I yell at them to pull over and they yell back ‘Just buckle him up.’ So I try and realize that the metal parts to the straps are broke off. This angers me so I’m slightly dream pissy and yell at them to go to Walmart so I can buy another one. After a long argument that ghetto rural towns don’t have a Walmart they concede because I am all-knowing and I know where one is. (Hey, it my dream!)   As we are driving down this dirt road the town disappears and there is a huge ditch on the side of it. My Grandpa is driving and he just kind of pops into the back seat to help with the car seat, maybe jiggy-rig it to work for a couple of miles. Just as it dawns on me that no one is driving I look out the window and yell ‘DITCH!’ Then we fall, forever, and land on a tree branch about 1/3 of the way down the ditch with long yellow grass weeds getting caught in my hair. I think for a second about huge bugs and fleas just leaping on my head and going to town before I pull Zack out and of the ghetto car seat and leave the car. Just then my Grandma tells me ‘Don’t pull on the grass.’ I tell her its sturdy enough. Just as I do the grass breaks and Zack and I fall and land on another tree branch near bottom of the ditch. Somehow we are just fine and Zack is still asleep. So I sit on the branch. The height is just high enough that you know you will break a leg if you jump down yet you still debate if you really should. I hate that height it’s such a mind boggler. Yet I sit and wait, I don’t know for what.   Just then a town appears in the distance with a police station on the outskirts. Fantastic! I get up and jump up and down yelling for help. A young male cop comes over and so I ramble on about all that happened and all he says is ‘Alright.’ I get kind of mad when at the end of my speech he’s still standing there saying ‘Alright.’ So I ask him if he has a ladder or some rope, he just looks at me, says ‘Alright’ again and walks off. Now I really consider jumping, but before I do my dream turns into EQ, complete with windows and chat channels and my Grandparents OOC the zone with ‘Don’t Aggro the Cops in this Zone unless you have Vah Shir Stat FOOD!’ Now I’m panicked. I’m stuck in a tree with a baby without any stat food at all and no temp or any HP buff at all to cushion my fall. I’m even OOM for some reason or another. I sit and try to med really, really fast cursing all the enchanters that are in the zone and to scared to come give me clarity.  Then the cop comes back with the mayor. I look up and my Grandparents have already ported out, damn wizards. The mayor looks nice, he’s smiling and laughing, though it is an election year so that explains that. And good God they con red. Me, a cleric, and a kid facing reds. I decide the best plan of attack is to just go with the flow till mana charges for a gate. They get me down and take me to their police station. It’s full of con yellows to reds and election year posters. They ask me to join their guild to put the mayor on the throne again and take up their quests. I deny I just can’t join the side of evil. They go agro.  Just at this moment Zack wakes up and then I wake up. I kick Pheonix. I tell him something jumbled about how I need to make some stat food so I wont die and he tells me to go back to sleep. Yet, somehow I cant because all I can think about is how to make Vah Shir stat food.

      Mood: Impatient  This day just doesn't seem to end, I want to go home, take a quick cat nap and finish my epic sword in Everquest. I got up today at 9:55 AM, I had to be at work at 10:00am, if that tells you anything about this morning. Got up, threw on clothes and out the door with tea in hand.  Finally got more tea, my body thanks me. After drinking mostly Soda for a long time, the Tea just gives me a much greater feeling of contentment, something Soda never does. Got an hour left of work, I've read all my web comics, and I'm kicking myself because I cannot seem to figure out what to write in my Ziggur Blog. I had a pretty good time, despite the fact my buddy Kretais was out most of the day. I spent the entire day out with Guild members on various assualts for my fiance and my pieces to spell quests, and finished the last portion of my soulfire drops. Spent the last part of the night with Kretais farming Sashes, which turned out rather well later in the night.   Tonight I've got more sashes to do, then once the busy work is out of the way(25+ sashes) then I've gotta finish getting my epic sword with it's 5 complete heals. need to also take the time to write up a Zblog and do some work on my Adventure for D&D.  Oh yeah, a follow up on my organization skills. I actually sat down and completed about 5 % of the D&D origin story. Thinking about posting the collective thoughts of this D&amp;D Project on a seperate blog, using it kind of as a white board/forum for comments from readers.   But then again, isn't that just more for me to keep up with? So much to do, so little time in wake filled life to do it. isn't that always the case? maybe that's why I stay up till 4am and get up at 8am at times. 4 hours of sleep, some say it's unhealthy, I say it's the only way I can get anything done. I'll sleep when I'm retired or dead. That's my motto, there's too much in this world to experience or do, to simply spend 1/3 of my life asleep.  Consider it maximizing effeciency. As long as it doesn't affect my work quality, and as long as I can avoid passing out at my desk, I will continue to min/max my life.  For those who do not know the definition of min/max  Min/Max -   Abbv of Minimum/Maximum - origin: Roleplaying Game Slang  - 1. A person who does the minimum to acheive the maximum result. 2. A method of spending the least to get the most. 3. A person who takes advantage of a system to achieve maximum results with the lowest possible side effects.  &nbsp; Try not to feed the stupid people, Phoenix

      mood: silly, wacky even, and peaceful.  &nbsp;  Today has been pretty hectic here at work, the problem with the phones at our work continues so we keep getting calls flowing into our dept that should not be. but those things happen. Aside from that I've been keeping up with  urlLink The Newbie Zone , the Everquest forum of personal choice. making comments when I have time, and also keeping up my other blogs.  &nbsp;  But I made a vow last night while my fiance was tucked into bed, that I needed to organize my life and priorities a little bit. Right now I'm on a pretty ferocious cycle of Sleep, Eat, Work, Eat, EQ, repeat. I have several projects I've been meaning to work on, and I'll explain them a little bit here.  &nbsp;  Dungeons and Dragons Adventure Concept: Nefarnomicon - a detailed campaign world, I've worked on this for over a year now, and I've got the concept world all in my head, and many of the pieces written down in various places. But I need to write this, it's very important to me, but has always been pushed around to being nothing but something in my Outlook ToDo list with nothing to push it past hitting the snooze button for the thousanth time. I built this world, with my bare hands, from the original goddess, to the various races, when they came into being, what drove them to be how they are, etc. and no of it is organized or complete! grr, that angers me sometimes that I let it get away from me. It's going to be stupendous to play, and maybe, when I'm done I can submit it to WotC for publication and if that happens, well, money is always good :D  &nbsp;  Shadowrun Covert Operations Suite: a package software much like the  urlLink RolePlaying Master  I typically use for the Dungeons and Dragons. I wanted to put my coding skills to decent use and make a tool I could use for designing and laying out things structured easily and offer online access at the same time. So I could run games even with people physically seperated from my game table. I began research into what I would need to do, but didn't move past that stage. &nbsp; The Phoenix Perch Website: I've been meaning to do this for well over 2 years I just haven't spent the time with Flash and Dreamweaver to hammer out the particulars about this site. I figure it may generate more traffic to this page, and give me a place to show off all the screenshots of all the cool stuff I've done in EQ, and link my shirt shops I run non-profit. &nbsp; Organize and catalog my Magic Cards using Magic Workstation: I have 3 binders and a pizzabox sized box of Magic cards, organization of these has always been a chore, however if I could put them into my database, I could sort them easily, and create virtual decks out of my available cards before I even have to touch the dreaded binders.  &nbsp; In an endevour to actually accomplish these fabled tasks obviously I'm going to have to cut back a little on my EQ time, which is suprisingly easy to do, in small increments. I have started to place things in my Outlook Tasklist a little more broken down, instead of "organize all magic cards into MTGW" I have "append and organize the black cards into the database" and I give myself 2 full weekends to accomplish even these broken down tasks, and I can extend that as necessary, but I'm going to try to force myself to accomplish at least 10% of any given task per weekend, so that I am making progress, even if it is slow and steady. We'll see how it goes next weekend.  &nbsp; more to come later, &nbsp; Try not to feed the stupid people, Phoenix

      Well this weekend was a hot one for Zack and I. We went off to our family reunion right outside of North Platte at the lake. It was a scorcher. The weather man said it was supposed to rain all weekend yet the little man and I showed our pale bods about every two hours as we walked to the beach for a dip.  &nbsp;  The little man surprised me a good one too. I knew he liked to swim, however I didn’t know he was suicidal. He has taken a liking to jumping off of rafts and boats. He has also learned to like his Spidey life jacket. Suicidal is fine with the appropriate life saving devices.  &nbsp;  Another big concern for us was quarters; you know it those round silver 25 cent pieces of valued coins. Not only are they there to clean your laundry, yet they can also be used for showers. Fifty cents is about 2 mins. I now take a 3 minute shower. Oh yeah, I'm good.&nbsp;However those coins are the new gold. If I wasn’t the one going around begging for the damn things I would be the one selling 50 cents in quarters for 5 dollars. Bet I’d get it too. Zack, on the other hand, has grown to hate water falling out of the sky. He thinks the sky is falling, or the oceans raining down or any other paranoid version of Henny Penny he can think up. He really trips a big one. Raging toddler tantrums from hell, face red through minor sun burn and flaling arms and legs. The showers are cut off of the rest of the bathroom by a curtain. With both of us butt-naked he ran through the curtain and headed for the door, our only towel in his hand. He opens up the door and runs out. Here’s flaming mom, flashing the camp, soaking wet, running after screaming, streaking two year old. Oh yeah, most embarrassing moment, *raises hand* I have the best one.  &nbsp;  NEWAYS – Those are the highlights of our trip. I also have been sleeping since I got back. I’m hoping to do some Ever Cracking tonight. Miss that smash and bash.  &nbsp;  Akcron – Ziggur! Wait for Backup!

      Mood: happy and a little tired  I'm full of pride, I've actually made posts for all the blogs I've been writing on, and this is the last one to finish. Akcron is leaving for her family reunion tomorrow morning and she will be missed. Work has been slow paced in terms of calls, but the day is just flashing past me in turbo, I just hope it settles down enough for me to get lots of satisfaction out of my Everquest tonight. I'm going to read some comedy links at the  urlLink EQ Forums  which have been really funny so far, so if you're a huge EQ nut, give it a peek. You'll enjoy it. Anyway, not too many thoughts to comment on other than my pride and current events, if something comes up you'll see another blog from me :)   Try not to feed the stupid people, Phoenix

      Life the world and nothing. I’m none too happy today. Its really for no particular reason at all either. I just don’t feel the need to be up and yuppie today.   Today I want to talk about boobs. I used to hate the male (and female) obsession of boobs. So much so that I wore baggy clothes and was called a variety of names from a dude, to a dike to a guy continuously. Well meaning strangers would kindly tell me that I was entering the wrong restroom for my own safety. I simply did not want to be a piece of meat. I wanted to be known for my charming personality and quick wit. Yes, you know it, I rarely got a date. (Love ya Pheonix)   Then a dress code change came into work. No baggy clothes, I was upset and mortified. I felt like my old ratty boss wanted to see my boobs. I contemplate going for sexual harassment, Pheonix talked me down and told me that boobs, yes wonderful are actually sources of infinite power if used correctly. I decided to hone this power and use it for good and not evil.   It’s been working pretty well too. I get days off of work and if I wear just the right shirt, nobody really cares if I’m late. (Only girl in the workplace.) The best thing that I have done with my boobs was sell my car. It was a ratty 150,000 mile totaled Ford Taurus. It wasn’t always like that though. I loved that car. It went through my rebellion years with me. But hasn’t been driven since. Two years ago at about 5am I was blazed and driving home to crash. I was also stopped at a red blinking stoplight. I waited. I rocked to a number of songs headbanging in my car and bellowing along. I waited some more. Finally a little voice in my head whispered, ‘it’s a red BLINKING stoplight.’ I turned down the music and the little voice told me, ‘at a red BLINKING stoplight you must Stop Look Both Ways and Proceed.’ I felt like I was in the Field of Dreams. I looked around the car, no one there. ‘DO IT!’ yelled the voice. Then it finally dawned on me. It’s a RED BLINKING STOPLIGHT. I hit myself in the head and ran into the intersection. Then  I saw it. A bright orange Scooby Doo van, it hit me, I turned three full circles and stopped on the other side of the intersection exactly as if I had stopped, looked both ways, proceeded and stopped on the other side of the intersection. I was wondering why  I would do that. Why would I stop on the OTHER side of the intersection?   As I was scrambling in my head for some weird law concerning this Boone, my best invisible friend from when I was a kid, popped up on my steering wheel and said ‘DUUUDE! You totaled your car MAN!’ I told him I didn’t and asked him where he had went I missed him. As we were catching up on old times there was a knock on my window. I thought that was just kinda rude to interrupt a conversation but I decided to be polite. I rolled down my window. The guys asked me if I was ok, I told him I was just talking with Boone. He looked around the car, obviously only seeing me since Boone is my invisible best friend, and said ‘Don’t move. The ambulance is on its way.’ Then it dawned on me, I’m 23 and talking to an invisible friend, I’m insane.  So that’s how I wrecked my car with no registration, no insurance, expired plates. I didn’t even get a ticket, I got a court date. The Judge I got was really, well weird. His grandson had just won a spelling bee and he told everyone awaiting punishment that if they congratulated him he’d go easy on them. I watched as people went up most of them getting thousand dollar fines or jail. It rang in my head ‘jail’, ‘prison’, ‘jail’, prison’. I hated high school I sure as hell was NOT going to prison. I was too young and too cute. It was my turn. I had to pee. I walked up there and stood in front of the judge hanging my head and doing the pee dance. Then I looked up to him and thought I was looking at God, you feel really lame and little when you look at God. But I did stuttered a congratulations to his grandson.  God smiled at me and said ‘What did you do.’ I told him. He asked me why. I said I didn’t know but was really, really sorry. I think a tear fell then. He smiled again and gave me a warning and not to drive for a while as a punishment. He didn’t suspend my license or anything just kind of like a warning for a toddler. I was ecstatic. I couldn’t believe it. I left while another person was being put in jail. I was invincible.   Well back on the main story I just paid off my piece of shit car and found out that since it wasn’t ‘under cover’ ie under anything including a towel, I owe registration and back taxes. So I marched down to the court house in my boob shirt, waved them in front of a really lonely ugly guy and got them waved. He just told me to sell the car or give it away, also not to tell anyone who he was. So I did and the over a grand of fines and fees are waved and I got a profit of 200.00 from flashing my boobs to my Mom’s old boyfriend.   I like boobs.  Akcron – Ziggur! Wait for Backup!

      I am sick and tired of God playing praticle jokes on me. You step outside from the AC and it feels humid yet temperate. You walk the mandatory 50 ft away from the building and step into the shade the temperture falls to a humid yet lovely 10 degrees cooler.You light your ciggarrette. As you puff away you think to yourself, 'Whats everyone bitching about? Its not that bad out here." It becomes a little hotter as you sit on the bench puffing away till it gets to a humid yet slightly a little too warm. You feel slightly suffocated since people with asthma really shouldnt smoke especially in humidity so you do your lungs a favor and put out the ciggarette. You step outside the shade and WHAMMO! Gods sick twisted little mind thinks that it will be funny to make the temparture go up to a stifling 98 degrees with max humidity. Its like a punishment for smoking too long when your not supposed to have that break. It's 50 feet back to the door. You think you should run, but your feet just cant. You trudge to the doorway, hair falling and laying flat on your head trapping the humidity on your skull, your bangs start leaking sweat into your eyes and your makeup starts running in turrents. You now look like crap. Coworkers will know you went on an illegal break and now you stink. You get to the door, you forgot to punch the handicap button five feet away and this door is heavy. You try to tell your arm to open the door, your arm rebels. Your tell your feet turn around, the buttons right there do arm a favor. Your feet say 'Fuck you and the arm, We just walked 50 feet.' You stand there in a debate with feet and arm looking like an idiot staring at all the nice AC'd people inside while God is up there laughing at you with Michel and the boys. You picture Michel putting back Hard Lemonade say 'Crank it Jesus, Crank it some More!' It gets hotter. Finally the arm gives in and you walk under that mandatory whiff of AC right by the door. Feels nice yet now the running makeup and sweat under your armpits freezes into a stinky sticky gell.   Is smoking worth it? Must be because I'm about to have another. God ... Bring It On!

      mood: agitated and bored Okay Okay, can't let Akcron take the entire stage that I built :P I know it's been a while since I said even hello to you all. But I must say I am annoyed by this blog tool, looks like they fixed the random unable to display this page issue. But I just wrote a blog post for my other blog  urlLink Ziggurs Camp , my everquest character blog, and it ate it! I went to hit publish, and the thing session timed out. grumble, oh well, nothing I can do but be annoyed. I'm at work, contemplating the idea of putting hydraulics on cars, and why they don't put hydraulics on saturns or something. I mean you'd get more bounce in a lighter car :P   Anyway, I apologize to those who read my Ziggur Camp blog, but you'll just have to wait longer for the most current post.   Also of note, Akcron is leaving for a weekend with the family at a family reunion, I won't be going with her because of financial reasons, so I'll be posting all the antics while she's gone ;P honestly might not be much, but you never know what a lonely guy might do :P   Anyway, more to come later on as stories progress.

      That night was one of many oddities.   I had forgotten my badge at home and was sent to pick it back up so that the freshman could address me appropriatly and ask me inane questions. On my way back to work I saw a homeless man on the street with a sign that read 'Anything will help, even if it is only a dollar.' Well, all I had was a dollar on me and was feeling charitable so I pulled over in a grocery store parking lot and ran across Dodge to give it to the guy. All the sayings of saftey and girls being tormented that my mother has told me over the past 23 years ran through my mind, yet I was on a mission to give this poor homeless man my dollar. I get there and hand the guy my buck, apologize I dont have more and turn around. He yells at me to wait. I see the zooming car run past my nose then turn, smile and say thanks. He grabs my hand bends down and kisses it. I'm astonished and a little grossed out but hey, he doesnt exactly have a bath and a toothbrush. But the thing is that he wont let go of my hand. I know Judo, I'm a black belt, I'd feel guilty about beating up a homeless guy but ya know I really wouldnt care. I tell him to let go first I think that you should warn everyone before breaking thier noses and kicking them in the nuts. But before I can even get out, 'Let go of me or I'll beat you senseless.' he starts jabbering about steaks and shrimp. I tell him again that all I have is a dollar. He points to the grocery store and says a dollar doesnt buy much these days, he wants a steak. I'm bewildered, I cant beleive that this hobo wants me to buy hima bloody Bew Yourk Strip! If I buy anyone else a New York Strip I better be fucking them, and I dont have sex with people who dont bathe regualarly. I get my hand back, he places my dollar back in it. I tell him my long story about how my credit card wont accept anything but ciggarrettes or gas. (I know laugh it up. My bank is ghetto and my card declines at random intervals. Its annoying but I just take heart in knowing I have the only credit card with a personality.)I give him my dollar back. He starts to get angry, he wants a steak. I tell him to save all the dollars that he gets and he can buy his own steak. He gets pissed. I ask for my dollar back. I get it, flip him off and run back to my car. You know, I wasnt exactly wanting a big gush of emotion over my puny little dollar, I wasnt even wanting a thankyou from schizophrenic homeless men but that was just a little too much. I mean the sign said any money, even a dollar. Really its false advertising, I should sue for his box. I head off to work wondering how to summons a homeless man to court.  When I get there I buy myself a Mountain Dew with MY dollar, see still works for little stuff, and head in. Here I see the freshman class for Creighton University, dressed in the lastest fads, hair sleek and shiny apparently not homeless.  I got an email from the President of the University today to treat these future lawyers and doctors well because they are the highest of their classes with the best SAT's and honors (they are also paying the most since tuition just raised by 5,000 dollars). These future doctors and lawyers however are smooshed together in a big circle jumping up and down and shouting out the words to TuPok and Ja Rule. Its quite comical because half the songs their belting out actually say how much the singer and the ghetto peeps want to shoot them and take out their liver.   Thier probably all Republicans too. I hate republicans just like I hate spiders. Simply out of neccessity and reason.  Have fun - dont kill yourselves  Ackron -- Ziggur! Wait for Backup!

      Today has been both eventful and uneventful. I woke up today and Pheonix and I had a wonderful miscommunication. One of those stupid little things that seem to be so important at the time yet when you look back at it you realize that you just need to grow up. Who cares who has the keys when your both going to the same place and why in the hell do when you put on your shoes really matter in the long run? Not a clue but this morning those things seemed to be at the top of my list of priorities. If I ever get a divorce or break up with Pheonix I want it to be about more than just shoes and keys on the table.   Besides the chatastophes of this morning I am working 17 hours straight today and into tommorrow. Today at Crieghton University's DOIT (Division of Information and Technology) we are holding GameFest, a bigger and better LAN party for all incoming sniveling whining bratty freshman that I hate more and more each day. I want to make a t-shirt that says, 'Please dont bring your 80's computer to Crieghton. It sucks and so do you.' My job today is to haul 5 plasma tv's and 40 Gateway computers three blocks across campus. My shoulders hurt, my arms have fallen off, I'm tired and I'm on break. I'm sitting here bitching in my blog about this and that and the other thing while random people are coming up to me. 'Can you fix my computer?' 'I cant get connected.' 'Where is the nearest wireless connection?' Dude I'm on break. Just because I work for DOIT does not meen that I like people. I tried to ignore them but then it seemed that they multiplied like mold on cheese. I want to charge money, $5.00 to see the on break DOIT person. I bet your asking 'how do they know you work for DOIT? Do you have a sign above your head?' Almost but not quite entirely unlike tea there. I have a big sign on my shirt. In large bold letters across my back and chest my shirt yells DOIT to the masses. I'm going to apply ducttape to it today. It's not even a nice colored shirt. It reminds me of a janitor or an industrial worker. I feel like I should be scrubbing toilets and not crawling around on the floor hooking cables into walls and explaning what a Desktop and a window is to estranged students. (Yes, that really happened I just got through talking to them. He wasnt even 50, he was a sniveling freshman.)  However I too have a tendency to digress as well and my break is over. More on the fantasies of DOIT later.  Ackron --- shoot the stupid people.

      Attitude: bored Mood: indifferent, looking forward to tonight  Been a long hard day in the trenches here today folks, almost no time to write anything for you readers. however it's good to see Tigger(now akcron) taking up the reigns herself and making an appearance and talking about things :)   Not much to say about things, yesterday was shakespeare on the green, was a lovely play, but I had to leave before closing curtain, which kinda sucked, hopefully someday I'll see the entirety of a shakespeare play. but I digress.  Akcron is right about the problems with the shower, it sucks, in terms of laughing at her in the shower, you have to admit, the look people get when committing self torture can be pretty entertaining. I took one myself in fact, but then again I'm used to it. early Basic Training and later Field exercises were both sans hot water, and thus we got to enjoy the blasts of cold water. I rate our current shower scenario a 2 out of possible 10 where 10 is the warmest. I use the showers in the field as the coldest this side of a snowball.   Anyway, we did more EQ last night and will do more probably tonight as is what is typical, so expect more ziggur camp blogging to ensue.

      Hello world, this is Ackron/Tigger_On_Crack. Yes, yes I am undecided on which name  I’m going to choose so I’ll use this one for right now. I don’t think it will be too confusing for the world at large to associate two names for one person, especially if they play EQ and can understand the concept of ALT’s.   Well, my morning was interesting today. I am used to lying in bed with the sounds of Kermit and Cookie Monster going off in the background till I have to wake up at about 9 or so. This morning however I was awakened by a sippy cup bashing me repeatedly in the head. Unbeknownst to me my son just figured out how to open doors and really, really wanted a drink. I guess he felt the need to go agro on me. I swear the sippy cup has to do lethal damage. *touches tender eye* So there I was black eye on the way, Pheonix still sleeping peacefully and a two-year old on rampage. First thought through my head is “this is too painful to be a dream” second thought “how in the hell do men sleep?”  When Son was born he slept through midnight roll calls, he sleeps through tornado alarms, now he’s sleeping through 7am juice requests. Is there some sort of biological chemistry that the female brain simply neglected to give us or is God still pissed about that God-damned peice of rotten fruit? I wonder if the man who got his dick chopped off slept through that as well. Anyways, I get up and give the kid a drink. I think if he is smart enough to get out of his room and strong enough to give me a black eye then he can get his own drink. Get a chair, spill it on the floor if he doesn’t drown I don't care.  Now is the second dilemma of the morning. How do you put a 2 year old back in bed when they can open up the door with out having well intending neighbors and Grandmothers call CPS? Not sure. It's 7am, my thought processes just are not booting. So I let him in my room and tell him that I’m going to sleep. He seems fine with that and why not? I never let him in my room it’s a no-kid zone and not baby/toddler proof at all. So as I lay staring at the ceiling with Zack merrily sipping on his fucking juice and staring at all of his new toys that he gets to randomly destroy, horrible thoughts start to pile through my head. He could climb on my desk chair, fall and get a concussion, go Evil Kinevil off my desk and into the pile of forbidden laundry, fall into my closet and enter a second dimension of reality never to be seen again (nice thought at the time I stuck with that one for a while) electrocute himself with the outlets under my desk. I get up again and try to convince the rampaging toddler to sleep with me on the bed. He body slams Pheonix who finally wakes up. Not bad, there is something that will wake him up besides sex. Now we’re all up. Fun. I decide to go to work early.  For the past weekend our water heater has been broken. Nice lovely landlord from hell has been promising a fix ‘the next day’ since the end of June. I feel like a pioneer woman, heating the water before cooking and bathing and ice showers. Son is the luckiest out of us all and gets an invitation to have a nice bath at Grandma’s house. I’m so jealous. What are my boobs not as speacial as the kid? Do they not deserve love? Guess not. For all the men who don't have boobs picture your testicles without the turtle feature then take a shower in falling ice cubes. Time to take another. I yip as I get in and Pheonix laughs. Never laugh at a woman with frozen nipples. Rage ensues. I'll leave it at that.  Ackron -- Ziggur! Wait for Back-up!

      Been having trouble writing this post, simply because I don't want to bore you with too many of the crappy details. Sometime's I'm just too perfectionist for my own good.  I just want to say for the record money sucks.  Or rather, that being out of money sucks.  For me, money = confidence, at least the confidence of being secure in your position in life. When money tides roll out, you start to notice the rocks that you're narrowly avoiding, that will cause you to sink to the next lowest lifestyle. We're Working class anyway, which is a pretty big group of people who make almost enough to live on without working ourselves to the bone, and so we also have good reason to dread going further down the monetary based caste system of america.   when the budget works, life is good, I'm usually more pleasant, I sleep better, and don't feel bad if I go to Burger King for a lil meal here and there.   It's when the budget breaks that I feel like a 10 ton gorilla is sitting in my pocket where my wallet was. That ten ton gorilla makes me hesitate spending any money, even for food. because I know if I buy food, then I can't afford a bill, or if I pay that bill, I'll not have much in the fridge.   I never was good at carnival tricks, but since I got started out in the real world(read: not sheltered military world protected from such things as rent and power bills) I've gotten pretty damn good at juggling.  I don't think there's a single working class citizen out there that hasn't gotten a "last chance before we repo/disconnect/cancel/eviction your (insert reason for bill here)" once and a while, and I'm sure more than a few have had it happen that the company actually goes through with it. but if it can be helped, a working class person will avoid the disconnect/repo/cancel at all costs. because as soon as you get disconnected, usually they need an insane deposit, and 2 months up front. and if you couldn't afford the bill initially and it got cut off, then how are you going to afford to turn it back on? rob a bank?   So you learn to juggle, the art of letting one bill slide into being late or even into the next bill you get from that company, so you can pay other bills and still eat. Then the next month you pay the late+new bill from that one company, and let the company you paid the month before slide. and by doing this you really only pay for a handful of stuff at at time, while the other stuff becomes late. then you pay the late, and let the current slide, this prevents a disconnect, because the disconnect usually only happens after 2 months of unpaid bills.   The problem comes when even with juggling, your still leaking money from somewhere, those bill-balls start turning into bowling balls, and later flaming machetes. you end up getting tired of the juggling, and you just wish you could let all the balls drop without repercussions. Right now I'd say that I'm at the bowling ball stage, but I've been here before, and so my juggling skills here are not too bad. I'm pretty sure I'll live, but it won't be comfy for another month my guess would be.  See, I think this post came out really well, better than the other 4 drafts :P just be glad I didn't torture you with those. They were incredibly boring, and well, I figure if you're going to post anything it had better be at least semi interesting, and not some detailed ramble that gets more than the point across. :P  Anyway, Even Everquest was tragic last night, check out my Ziggurscamp Blog for details  urlLink Ziggur's Camp   try not to feed the stupid people Phoenix

      Mood: relaxed  well, looks like SammyCaine has decided to go by another of her aliases, Tigger_On_Crack. one of these days I'm sure she'll make a post(even if I have to prod her to do so :P) so future posts will reflect her choice in names.  Well the 4th went pretty well for us. I worked for the day(time and a half woohoo) which is okay since all the good stuff happens at night anyway. I went directly to my soon to be father in laws where Tigger and my Son had been hanging out most of the day. I had a beer and relaxed for a bit, while the ladies made macaroni salad. and I must say I'm not usually a terribly huge fan of a lot of people's recipes for egg based salads. but this macaroni salad is pretty good. and Tigger has learned the art of making it, so I'm hoping to see some in my home someday soon :P  I ate Chicken and Potato Wedges and Macaroni salad for dinner, it was very good. and I helped my youngest Brother in Law with smoke bombs and found some unfired black cats amongst the carnage in their backyard. we did this until it was time to go to the big Fireworks show at Harrah's Casino(I still don't know why Iowa wants to pronounce Harrah's (which I pronounce harrah! like when you are applauding something) like Harris. it's not Harris, it's Harrah!) which was very awesome, my son got a kick out of it, and the place we sat at you'd swear the fireworks were going to rain down right on you. they were huge! Very good show. Anyway, we drove back, me being completely dehydrated for a little home fireworks display setup by the brother in laws.   The brother in laws had mortars to fire off, the first couple went off well, then the brother's got the idea to try to link them together 2 at a time. well, when they lit them off, the tube got knocked sideways and the mortar fired off screaming right toward a neighbors house and blew a big scorch mark on the neighbor's garage door. my Father in law was pretty ticked off at what my brother in law did, but my fiance said he would probably just do some free mowing's to cover the expense if any to be had fixing that garage door.  Second botch came right after the first. the littlest brother in law didn't understand how to load a mortar in the tube correctly, so he placed the ball end down, which of course by any who have fired these lovely night time toys, is upside down. He lit it off, and backed away, all the sudden we head the thump of the propellant fire off, but we didn't see the mortar leave the tube, we all screamed for the kid to run away from the tube, and he was almost hit by the flaming sparks as the mortar tube blew into pieces.  After that the evening returned to normal. But I must say a lot of funny and cool things happened that night. it was a blast!   Try not to feed the stupid people Phoenix

      So I saw spidey 2, with my fiance, the biggest fan of Spidey I know, I mean during the whole Spiderman 2 Movie she was bouncing in her seat, raising her arms in celebration and generally being more hyperactive than a lab rat on speed.   The movie features one of Marvel's most malevolent bad guys, Doctor Octopus. It also revolves around the love story of Peter Parker with Mary Jane Watson. A lot of the movie focuses on Spiderman's inner struggle with his own dreams and his duty to being a superhero.   The special effects were really awesome, and on par with the former movie, and the fight scenes between Spiderman and Doctor Octopus are very intense, and features even more property damage than the Hobgoblin fights in the first movie. One of the coolest scenes was the fight on the subway train, very intense and very good special effects. The movie also features a comic relief in Peter Parkers current apartment and his interactions between the landlord.   The movie invokes a wide spectrum of emotion throughout the film, and does it with very good cinematography. if there is anything to complain about in the movie it would be the amount of times that Spidey is without his mask. He reveals himself to too many people in my opinion. A Superhero is supposed to mask his identity, and in the comics does so to a great extent, whereas in the movie he's practically revealing himself to everyone toward the end of the movie.   All in all I recommend seeing this movie, it was very well done, and besides the slight annoyance by the amount of times spidey reveals who he is to people, there is nothing else to dislike about this movie. I give it 5/5 stars, and is a must see movie.

      Mood: Headache, hungry and tired  well my buddy didn't show up this weekend, didn't even call, wonder what happened, anyway, time to go have barbecue and relax with the inlaws as best I can. probably gonna be a short night.  I'll edit this post later and give you more info on my weekend.    -edit-  My buddy didn't show up this weekend, dunno what happened to him, will have to call him up and ask him someday, oh well, things like this happen. And sometimes they disappoint me. This weekend was pretty rough, Friday I spent from the time Sammycaine got up, till around 9pm taking care of the toddler. That much time alone with him can be a little challenging, now compound that with a lack of cigarettes till around 6pm, and you have a recipe for a crappy day. The second day I had to get up to take Sammy's brothers home, at 8:30 am, after spending till 5am playing. 3 hours of sleep, luckily I overslept my alarm, got up at 9:30 instead, so 4 hours of sleep, lil better, drove the brothers home, came back home, and kid was crying and fiance was asleep.  I felt awake, I tend to whenever I get up, I just can't get back to sleep once I've gotten dressed and have met the morning. I have to wait forever before I can even think about taking a nap. Anyway so I stay up, take care of the kid until the fiance wakes, SammyCaine wakes around 2ish, says she feels sick, and went back to bed. I took care of the kid until around 5:30 when Sammy needed to pick up her brothers for babysitting duty. They arrived, I got rushed around the house doing this and that, while I wanted to just chill.  Things started to pick up Saturday after the brothers came over. We took off and went to Taco Bell before we went to a movie. I ordered their new 1/2 lb combo burrito(which I will tell you for a fact, was not 1/2 lb!) a beef grilled stuft burrito(now that's 1/2 lb or more!) and a cheesy gordita crunch(nirvana of cheese to me) and a large Dr Pepper. What do I wind up with? 2 of my items, and I'm missing my fave one, the Cheesy Gordita Crunch, they didn't even ring it up, we checked the receipt, the dude operating the register was a complete idiot, and you could tell when I told him my order, and he waffled it twice and didn't repeat it back to me the last time. Maybe he was new, but new people should be forced to work a night shift before being put on rush periods to ensure they know what they are doing before they handle the tough times of the day. Ah well, I digress.  Now my day was still being crappy, missing my fave item in my bell bag, and then I go to take a swig of the Dr Pepper while driving. SPLASHDOWN! the lid was not Firmly affixed to the cup, and thus, I end up with a Dr Pepper Shower, Ice cold refreshment this was not. more like frosty hands of death while I'm driving. I can't help but laugh at that last part though looking back on it. I dunno just seeing people getting the suprise of their life by being splashed with water when they're not looking always made me at least giggle. but at that time it was pretty crummy, Thanks Taco Bell Stooge! missing parts of my order and not putting the cup lids on correctly! you're fired. Okay I feel better.  Then we saw the movie, Spiderman 2, which I will review in a seperate post. Turned my day around, just snuggling with SammyCaine in the movie(Spiderman is her fave superhero, mine is Punisher) just made my life more complete. we drove away from the show later, and I was no longer as grumpy as I had been the whole day. I didn't care that my buddy didn't even call. I didn't care that I had the kid for 2 days straight. We went to the park after, for a lil while, walked around it looking at artwork. then went home, played more Everquest, and went to bed. so it got better, and everything turned out all right.

      My buddy who got me addicted to everquest contacted me last night, for the first time in a long time I got to talk to him. he's doing decent and been playing City of Heroes(a superhero MMORPG) and has become leader of a top Supergroup(Guild in CoH) I think he's thinking about stopping in tonight or soon to hook up with us and do some LAN gaming. should be a fun time. I'll keep posting the details of the days that we have together, he has a tendency of doing this, since his schedule is so hectic most of the time and he's so occupied, whenever he gets a bunch of days off stretched out for a while(july 4th holiday) he hooks up with us so we can do some serious LAN gaming. it's fun, and it never seems to last long enough. We miss him often when he's gone, and we enjoy every moment that he's in our home. I'll keep you posted as things develop.  Try not to Feed the Stupid People, Phoenix

      Mood: sleepy, but content  I want to wish Sammycaine a warm welcome, she is a shining star in my life, and a welcome addition to the Phoenix Perch crew. She will post her thoughts as they come to her as well. This way not everything has to come out of my mouth :P Welcome SammyCaine, let's get blogging.   Anyway, SammyCaine had most of the adventures last night, she hooked up with an old buddy and went to a bar, she'll probably tell you about that. I had a long day at work yesterday, but a lot of it I spent blogging and surfing, which goes to show just how slow my work place is. I came home, cleaned the house for the arrival of Sammy's friend, and he never showed, then I got on Everquest, made 899 platinum last night helping me break 1k of plat for the first time. I then did some tradeskilling, making smoker's to boost my pottery skill high enough to make prismatic dye's for Sammy's characters.   When Sammy came back, we decided to play our lowbie characters, so I played my necro, which was fun, I played the necro because our regular mage was not playing that night, and the necro has a skeleton that is highly useful in combat when you don't have anyone to tank(take hits) for you.   Ended the night with a pull of 3 giant badger things known as burnies, which almost wiped the whole group. I knew then that it was time to camp for the night. Snuggled in with Sammy for the night, talked about the usual stuff, and went to bed.  Try not to feed the stupid people Phoenix

      mood: little tired, feeling lazy Well it's been a while since I've written anything for my blog, So todays I good day to do it, mostly because I actually FEEL like doing it. which differs often from the need to do it :P. I intend to write some more ziggur's camp blog today, though there's not a whole lot to write about, except the latest 2 excerpts.  Very rarely do I ever click on an ad on a website, it's pretty uncommon for me, what with all the crap that gets advertised on most websites, half of which is spyware ridden. But  urlLink Split Reason  peaked my interest. But then again, unlike most internet sucker's who get pulling into paying for and downloading spyware, I'm a sucker for Old School Gamer Reference's and T-shirts that portray this love. So if you like that kind of stuff too, give em a glance.  I've really gotta start writing the static content for my website as well, but time never seems enough. Hell with all the time I wasted last night trying to get into a Nagafen Raid on EQ, I could've written 3 pages of static content for my website. /groan fasten your seat belts folks, rant is beginning:  Why can't people make up their minds? biggest problem we had last night was the fact that our Raid group had it's leadership rotated about 50 times in 2 hours time. The person who originally advertised the raid and had actually been there wanted me to be Raid Leader right off the bat, told them no thanks since I was still a little green with raiding. She said no sweat. Then suddenly I get made Raid Leader with no forewarning, I start to setup group leaders and begin to form a party, then someone announces the Main Assist would be the Raid Leader, so made him leader, then the Original Advertiser for the raid asked everyone to leave the raid and get reinvited by her... So she becomes raid leader again, only to give it back to the MA later, who was 2 boxing and not paying attention to his Tank, who had Raid Leadership when we were asking for it back before we lost too many players. By the time the idiot realized he had Raid Leadership(obviously the screaming at him in Raid Chat wasn't good enough) 2/3rds of the raid disbanded. So we had to call it off.  Had raid leadership stayed fixed, wouldn't have been a problem, if the MA had realized he had RL when we were screaming at him to give it to us, I could've migrated a cleric from group 3(which had 2) to group 2(which didn't have 1) which would have kept 3 more players in raid. we would've had 3 partial groups and probably could've filled the rest out.  It was the most disorganized mess I've ever gotten involved in, and it drained my mental energy faster than a mana sieve from an Enchanter. I gave up on EQ for the night and went to bed. Just not worth it that night.  I hate the stupidity of some people, I understand new people or people who haven't done something before being bad at it. But people not paying any attention, and not knowing the basic fundamentals, really gets to me, especially the post lvl 30 crowd. If you made it to past lvl 30 without knowing how to do basic group mechanics you need to either solo less, or pay attention. I like LDoN's because they encourage grouping, and group mechanics. Whereas there are many places in Norrath that people can solo, granted I find most solo opportunities either Slow or dangerous. My Necro has had trouble finding any groups except inside of LDoN's, I don't know what it is about the necro class that makes them ungroupable, but seems anytime I ask about getting a group, I don't find one, and have to go to PC's Phlarg bridge and hunt.  Anyway last night sucked, and the fact that the raid drained my energy made it where I couldn't help my buddy Kretais on his epic quest :( which sucks I hate it when I can't help even though I'm online, I just camped out, and watched a movie. Dunno what I'll do tonight, probably find an ldon group or something.  /rant off  That rant wound down quickly. Anyway, Time for my break at work, so I'm gonna go have a cigarette, do some thinking and start writing Ziggur's Camp for the past 2 nights worth of adventuring.

      Well a while ago I was added to someone's MSN messenger account, happened right about the time that I started blogging so I thought maybe someone of my EQ buddies that knew of my Blog had added me to their IM list, so I thought cool, though the name never was online at the time I was. So I shrugged, and it lingered. Today this morning while I was loafing before making it to work ON TIME! woohoo! it began to speak. Turns out it's a fellow blogger *wave to blogger* and is a Shadowrun Fan. I know I haven't talked about Shadowrun before on my blog, but let me put it this way, it's one of the coolest Tabletop Roleplaying Games I've played. It's what got me started in the whole sordid RPG community when I was in the military. It's a game of corporate espionage with heavy weapons, equally or better armed resistance, and Stealth. Some people run quick shoot em ups because they like action. Me personally, I'm a stealth afficianado(hence why I like hitmen, snipers, ninjas, hackers, and thieves in games)  so I like to force my players to use their noggin, by drawing up elaborate failures when stealth is not used, and sometimes, just for fun, I make an easy one that is a shoot em up, just to watch them avoid it. I've found in past with some players that a simple shoot em up or a poorly planned stealth run can be shot to hell with but 1 player. The ever present First Person Shooter loving Min/Max'er who has a character so well built that grenades land at his feet and he just stands there and continues shooting, because he can soak the damage all the way down to nothing. These people destroy that kind of game. But anyway, I just wanted to wave out to that guy, and say it's glad to see someone besides 5 other people read these things! especially since nobody ever comments on them on the site :(  Anyway, another part of today's topic, I keep having this weird flash of an idea that flies through my head, of an angel being shot at, going incorporeal, and laughing. I'm actually thinking about writing a story about this angel, maybe a screenplay or something. it's pretty cool, and using that seed I built up an entire little action comedy idea in my head about a Malakim superhero. If you notice my handle I go by on here is Phoenix Malakai. I took Malakai from a distortion of Malakim, which according to a French RPG I used to play is one of the choirs of angels. The malakim as the ones that God sends out as his mighty vengeance against evil. They are the only angels that are permitted to kill to get their jobs done, whereas other angels can only kill demons. The malakim wear black wings, and are the only angels that have never had one of their choir fall from grace and become on of the many ranks of demons in Hell. I always thought that Malakim's would be serious bad asses, taking no crap from anyone except god. God sent them to each to punish the sinner's, and that's what they do, no matter who or what gets in the way of that ideal. So maybe when I get the time I'll start jotting some short hand notes on that project. Anyway time for lunch I have to send my mom and email apologizing that I missed her B-day AGAIN :( I suck. Anyway  Try not to feed the stupid people, Phoenix

      I hate alarms, especially when they fail in their purpose. lately it seems as though my alarm is refusing to awaken me, I'm not sure whether this is because I am way beyond tired to the point I don't acknowledge the existance of the Blaring Country music, or that the machine itself is failing to respond. Today I woke up at 10:50, 10 minutes before my shift. I dare you to try to get a 2yr old changed and dressed, a lady dressed and appropriately prepped for work, and drive 5 minutes to work, in 10 minutes. that gives all the things that need done 5 minutes to get accomplished. Frankly this worries me. I do not want to lose my job, it is not the finest job, but it's better than a lot of jobs I can think of. Tonight I'm going to take a nap when I get home I think, and then after that, I'm gonna go to bed early tonight, and I'm gonna tweak with the alarm such that I hope above all hopes that it does not fail me again. I also hope that my bosses realize that after 2 years of service to the company it is not my intention to come in late, nor is it my intention to put myself in a hazardous position to my career.  Also of note, Yesterday I began my attempts to Overclock my AMD 2400XP, Results have been okay so far. I've started making only small increments as this is my first try, and well I don't want to burn my processor to death. I stepped the Processor from 130mhz FSB which is what it was running at(about 1950mhz proc speed) to 135FSB(2045mhz Proc Speed) and adjusted the voltage by .25 volts. There was a noticable jump in temperature from what was a 58c temperature to a 61c base running temperature. Temperature at full activity now climbs but stays stable around 66c with no lock ups or crashing. I've been running Prime95 a Prime Number finder application that peaks processor at 100% usage, which means it should reflect what maximum system temp should be at full operation. I ran this test for 4 hours to prove whether or not it was reliable.  I've also come to the conclusion that the stock Fan for the AMD is crap, and a more premium cooler needs to be purchased for future overclocking, so I'll be researching this to determine what it is I'm gonna use. Stay tuned!  Try not to feed the stupid people, Phoenix

      mood: bored, tired  Well, I've been at work for an hour and ten minutes so far, and not one single caller has reached my headset, I'm beginning to wonder if there is a problem. Course if I report it that'll just mean that I will have work to do, but sometimes that's a good thing.  Work on my projects has been nullified by the need to play more EQ,  I admit that my goals outside of EQ are not making much headway, and I need to dedicate at least some part of one day to doing this great work. I'm tempted to do a little tonight, just to appease my need to create. I still wish I could bring my laptop to work as I used to, and that the laptop even worked. Heck if the laptop even worked I could probably do my writing and play EQ, crazy isn't it? but there's sometimes enough down time to write a document or two in the greater scheme.  There are things that need doing, and with proper planning they can be done. I'm going to spend an hour on my projects tonight, dedicate a little time to them, before I touch that demonic thing that is EQ. Heck I've even been neglecting these blogs, but that's not EQ's fault, because I don't have EQ at work. It's work's fault for keeping me too busy to write.  Also today I have to pick a surname for my necromancer, I'm going to dig through some online stuff until I find something that fits.   Try not to feed the stupid people, Phoenix

      There comes a time in everyone’s life when decisions have to be made and followed. I am not talking about minor ones like ‘what to eat for dinner’ or even ‘how I wipe my butt.’ I am speaking of pro and con decagons, such as ‘be late for work or play games’ or more importantly ‘Money or EQ.’ Those are the hard decisions of life. The decisions that define who you are and your lot in life. Play EQ, be late for work, lose job, no money and then, utterly no EQ. The small change to the decision such as play for ‘X’ amount of time and then go to bed is just beyond us. We get online after kid goes to bed and we just play. We get so engulfed within the game that even though we are less than a yell apart we don’t talk we /tell each other. “/tell Ziggur how are you today?” We wait to the very last minute to go to the bathroom and we do the dance to the toilet letting it flow. We wait till we are dehydrated or until we see the other already up and dehydrated to get another pop.  I personally have come to the utter in geekness. To such a degree that I can’t stand being myself. I dream of EQ, I can’t wait to go home to play EQ. Even at work I think in EQ. When I want to laugh my mind spits out ‘LOL’. There was one time yesterday that I even laughed the letters of LOL in my laugh. Humiliating. When I get mad at a computer my mind say ‘WTF yo?’ When I am speaking with coworkers my mind says ‘/g.’  There comes a time in every girl’s life that she just has to put down EQ. Will I be strong enough? Probably not. Will I even try? Probably not. However the first step is just admitting it. I have completed the first step now and am quite proud of myself and also satisfied.  Ackron – Ziggur! Wait for Backup!!

      Mood: happy and hopped up on caffeine  I woke up today at 10:15am, I thought today was Wednesday, my regular 11am to 7pm shift. Turned out today was not in fact Wednesday, which Akcron so lovingly pointed out, but Thursday! my 10-6 shift! this has been the 3rd or fourth time in this week that I've been late to work, I kinda dread the paperwork that would be imposed by my company for this. Now sometimes they do not catch these things, and I may get lucky enough not to see paperwork, but needless to say something needs to change in my house and I need to turn over a new leaf of coming in on time everyday. that and I need to remember what day it is before I set my alarm.  Anyway, work hasn't been too hectic today, but getting up the energy to write my blogs has been an effort lately, hopefully I'll be able to catch them up tomorrow while I'm off. Look for more as it happens. I'll probably also start on my Website project this weekend, I've got some preliminary site designs in mind, but I'm just learning CSS, so it may take some time to iron out all the cross-compatibility wrinkles.

      Mood: tired, self-loathing  Gah! can't believe how long it's been since I posted an update. well, turns out the AC got fixed and I didn't go to my father in laws as expected that weekend, and it's all been downhill from there. staying up WAY too late, and getting to work the same. Bad bad eq, been staying up till 4am most nights just to play. setting up a more restrictive 2-3am clause on my eq'ing. hopefully this will tame the problems with sleep and getting up in time to perform the functions required to make sufficient income. I was restricted earlier today from viewing non-work related sites since we had clients coming into the office. So I read a lot of my Platinum Edition Que HTML Bible, I say bible because this book is so huge you'd swear it was the old testament. Anyway, I learned a lot of Sweet stuff about CSS, XML, and DTD's, which is what I plan on using for the bulk of my site, also found a handy Javascript file to work around IE browser's inherent flaws.  Which brings me to my next conclusion. I hate IE, it's always behind the standards of other browsers. CSS2 is supported by most Netscape knockoffs, but not fully by IE, who claims to be fairly compliant with W3C standards. The thing that was ticking me off is something called Fixed. it's a property in CSS that let's you create content that hovers at the same place on the screen even when scrolling, and is handy for putting useful links on a page, that way people will not have to scroll to the tip top of the page to make use of your links or other content.  I plan on writing a Flash menu for the left hand part of my site, which will be fixed, thanks to that javascript file. this menu will allow easy access to a lot of content without having to put a million links on any one page. condense the links, create more white space for content. that's what it's all about.  Anyway, that's the thoughts for the day. Also going to work on making CDF files for my blogs so people who use internet exploiter can check updates on the blog site regularly. pretty handy I think.

      When I woke from camp at the base of Kelethin(I rarely enjoy going into it, the height will give a dwarf's heart a flutter), I made my way to the Plane of Knowledge to meet up with the lovely cleric Akcron. When I arrived in Plane of Knowledge I went to the infamous Delly Tree(the Iksar's favorite camping spot) and waited, it turns out the Cleric was off gathering supplies. While I found my good friend Konath, the Vah Shir Warrior who I trust the most to stand by my side in battle. Once we met up we went over to the bank to see if there was any nice people giving any powerful strength and health boosting spells. There was not, so I focused my own divine powers to Guard and fill my friends with Daring.    When we all finally got together we made our way to Gunthak, I attempted to find an easy way to the vile shore, but I could not find any other way than to swim. Making a perfect 360 rotational dive into the water, I began swimming for the shores from the lighthouse. Konath was very close behind, though Akcron, bless her soul could not swim very well, and thus almost drown in the sea. Konath eventually reminded my of a folly I had made attempting to go west to the shore, it was south that I needed to go! so turning myself around we eventually made it to the corrupted wastes of Gunthak Beach.  Gunthak beach for everyone's information is a beach filled with terrible undead things, zombies, and skeletons, all the lost souls of those who have wrecked their boats against the rocky shores. I immediately called upon the power of Rodcet Nife to assist me in removing the undead presence from the beach. and he answered my call. It seemed with almost every fourth attack I made on the vile creatures they would scream in agony as the evil power that held them to this world was being torn from them. They all died relatively quickly.  I am also thankful that I brought my Hammer of Silent Screams with me, as it's aura closes my wounds, this ability was further enhanced when my closest brother at arms arrived, Kretais showed up on his Drogmar. I congratulated him on the purchase of his steed, and he proceeded to enhance us and make us invisible with his spells.  We then made the run to Dulak, a place of pirates and vagabonds. When we arrived Kretais marched forward in search of a place to safely assualt the enemy. While this happened a dark elf assualted us as we were not invisible at that time(we had lost it to the giant mushrooms of Gunthak) we swiftly dispatched the dark elf, and I took the dark elf parts, pulled my spit out, and roasted Konath a couple of blackened Tier'Dal steaks to munch on during battle. I love making food out of my enemies, it produces a kind of satisfaction that cannot be had any other way.  Minutes later, someone had lost their invisibility and was running right for us with many enemies on their backsides. So we quickly ran away to avoid being run over by this assualt. When we returned to Gunthak I assisted the young lady with Daring, and placed a Guard upon her skin. She thanked me profusely and got invisibility back and ran back into the fray.   We too ran back into Dulak, then we returned to invisibility, and made our way to the stormwind, a pirate ship docked at Dulak. we proceeded to kill Ogre and Dark Elf vagabonds until it seemed as if the Pirates had placed a sleeping curse upon me, for my strength faltered, and I could barely keep my eyes open. I informed my allies of my plight and they sent messages to their friends that they would require a druid to assist us out of Dulak. Eventually as we continued to fight, our Fine druid made her way to the ship. the druid, whose name I have forgotten the spelling of, then called upon the power of nature to sweep us back to the plane of knowledge.  When we returned to Plane of Knowledge, our fair Akcron who had been collecting the valuables off the corpses of our fallen enemies, sold them to the vendors inside the Plane of Knowledge, and returned to us with 75 platinum! a very fine day of battle it was. I put the platinum in the bank, headed to the bazaar, set up my shop to sell some velium I had acquired recently, and fell asleep. It was a good day, and a productive day.   If we may ever meet, may it be as brothers, and not as enemies, Ziggur Rathebringer

      It is here that I shall tell my tales for all to see, the escapades of Ziggur Rathebringer 40th season Paladin of Brell. I have made many adventures already, so I'll tell you a little bit of my history here to catch you up to current days events.  I began my life on Norrath by my father Krellon Steelswinger, and my mother Adilyne Potter. They raised me in the traditions of our great people, the mighty dwarves of Faydwer. I always had great pride in my people, the efforts that we make each day so that others may use our ore from the rich butcherblock mountain range.  I didn't have much experience with outsiders in my youth, as they were often travellers who would arrive to simply buy goods, drink at the tavern, and be safe from the wandering hordes of evil outside our safe underground city. One day I happen to be wandering by the tavern, when I heard someone speaking ill of the Irontoes! these people are some of our most heralded heroes! I became so enraged with the comments by this human that I jumped at him, kicking him squarely in the nose. The constabulary eventually took us both away, and I was handed over to my parents. My parents in their wisdom decided I needed some discipline, as I was going to be grown up soon, and I would need to learn the skills to survive.   Given my strong fondness for my people my parents figured the best place for me was with the clergy. I spent the remaining years of my childhood with the clergy learning all that was the glory of Brell, our creator. I learned quite a bit about the world, including that the gnomes were related to us and lived in the mountains of Steamfont. I decided one day that I should meet these folk, for I had only seen a handful coming into our city. I also learned the ways of chivarly and the sword, once I had matured and passed the rights of initiation, I became a paladin! The road was hard and long, but I had begun the walk toward great deeds!  The first great deed I had was to acquire bone chips for one of the fellow paladins, this was to prevent the evil necromancers from using them to reawaken the dead. I spent much time hunting these skeletons. Eventually I had proven worthy enough to be taught the secret of crafting underfoot defenders platemail armor. At last I could dress in armor consecrated by my god. I worked hard towards that goal, and made quite a few pieces. It was while this was happening when I happened across a Wizard. The wizard had come to me with an offer to join together to fight against the evil. I agreed and learned the wizards name was Gerillion. He was a human, and one of the nicest ones I had met for a long time. We hunted for quite some time, and he gave me some things that his monk friend had no use for any longer. I thanked him for this gift. It was grand indeed.  During our days of combat against the evil hordes, Gerillion made mention to me that he knew of a guild of adventurers that might be interested in our service. It was at this time that I met Deltree, a ghastly Iksar, one of the most evil living things in all creation, however I came to learn that Deltree was indeed one of the few Iksar that had repented the evils of his ancestry, and has in fact proven himself throughout norrath to be kind to all goodly people. he invited us into the Call of Honour, a guild who is very selective as to who joins with them. I was honoured, and I vowed my blade to their assistance at any time.  It was after this that I began to hunt the vile Crushbone Orcs, who had been attacking our wood elf neighbors relentlessly. Deltree came to my aide with his powerful magic many times there. I had decided to also follow Gerillion to his hometown of Freeport, there I found out about the Temple of Truth, and the servants of Truth, the paladins of Freeport. As it turns out the Freeport paladins had been working hard to rout the evils from freeport, one of them being the corrupted militia. I offered my assistance, and helped them deliver a message to a spy inside the militia, only to find they deemed me unfit for further duty unless I could prove my worth.  So I spent time delivering messages for the bards of antonica, which was slowly proving my worth to the temple. However on one fateful day, I decided to step foot in Kithicor forest to deliver a message to Highkeep, when in I died deep inside the pass. Recorporated in the Plane of Knowledge, I asked for assistance to extract my body. Gerillion and I watched as my corpse was brought to me from none other than Deltree. Again he had saved me countless hours of struggle. I thanked him and went on my way.   Eventually I lost communication with Gerillion, but had joined another elite group of adventurers in the lands of Norrath, the Wayfarer's, they thought I was worthy enough to begin working for them, and it was at this point that I have met one of my best friends on norrath. A Vah Shir named Kretais. Kretais helped me in the very first Lost Dungeon I was sent to explore by the wayfarer's, and we had a blast. We had so much fun we continued to spelunk the dungeons in search for finer weapons, and to crush the evil within.  It was also around this time that I had finally visited my relatives, the Gnomes in Steamfont. I was instantly entranced by a Cleric of Brell, named Akcron Mercaii, I immediately got her into the guild, for her diving healing powers were strong, and I knew the moment I had joined up with her, that she would assist us for years to come.  Since then I've also met a Vah Shir named Konath, who has been helpful and is good with a sword. we adventure regularly together though we must strengthen our cleric against the hearty forces of the dungeons before she can step foot in them with us. For the wayfarer's are very wise, and know whether a dungeon is too dangerous for one of their members.   It would also turn out that I have become known for a interesting style of baiting the enemy into our ambush. My friends refer to this as a "Ziggur Pull" which by definition, is just the right amount of enemies to barely escape death. I rarely pull too many to be dealt with, but when I do, I am certain to try my hardest to save the rest of the group.  These have been the adventures of Ziggur Rathebringer, this is my story, now you know my past. you shall hear more as my adventure continues.  If we ever shall meet may it be as brothers, and not as enemies, Ziggur RatheBringer

      I awoke Saturday in peaceful Plane of Knowledge, fully prepared to engage the Mistmoore Catacombs anew, however when I went to the bank to get enhancements from the kind people casting them on everyone in the area, I met a fellow guild member Jael, a beastlord. She gave me some of her enhancements as well, we hugged, and she took off. Meanwhile I began to hear murmurings of activity from our Guild, and it sounded like they were on a quest, and all of them were within my experience. I asked them if they had space for a paladin, and they said they had one space left. I jumped at it, and ran to Gunthak.   In Gunthak I received more enhancement and then invisibility, so we could run past all the man eating plants in the tunnels towards Dulak. Today, we were to assualt the Mines of Torgiran. We went to find Teeo's, our ranger, Sharpened Mining Pick. We spent a lot of time in those mines with Rmdir, Jael, Vyoletta, Teeo, and Kary. No Pick ever did show, Rmdir eventually had to setup camp, and we wished him fare well. Aminea then joined our group, with his mighty "puppy" a Gigantic Grizzly Bear. and we proceeded to kill the miners who were lost to mental instability, and rescued those miners who would fight the evil of the mines. we killed many Guards as well, and eventually Vyoletta, Aminea, and Jael Left, and we picked up Qali, Dextrin an iksar monk, the first one I've ever met, and Wildlily. Qali did not stay long, and left eventually, and Jael returned. We fought a bit longer, then Dextrin left us. So we were short one person of a full group, so Akcron decided to come!, and so Jael Left and Qali returned, and Akcron was guided to Dulak by Lily, while the Ranger Teeo Camoflaged me and told me to run like the dickens.   I ran all the way to zone, as Teeo said often his camoflage would fail. It suprisingly held fast on me. and I made it all the way to the entrance of Gunthak, and waited for the others. Teeo was not as lucky, as he attempted to camoflage himself, it kept failing him, and he accidently snared himself. Once he was snared, his Camoflage held, and he began to slowly crawl to us, dragging his feet due to the snare spell. Camoflage eventually dropped, and Teeo died. I mourned his loss, but Akcron resurrected him. We then made way to the docks, to kill dock hands in attempts to find a black medallion that was lost out in Dulak for Millius Darkwater.   So I start baiting everything I can find, and things are going so well Akcron gets her pouty face on showing me her boredom. So I decide to give her and myself a work out, and perform what many refer to as the Ziggur Pull. I taunted 3 Treasure Sorters from their tables inside the warehouse, and ran back for the group. When I got there, 3 more arrived. I was in shock, but kept trying to keep track of all the enemies and keep them focused on me. Akcron started to scream in panic, and I setup to lay my hands on her wounds, but she died before I got there. I mourned for her, but kept fighting, while the Enchanter Qali attempted to stave off the enemies with her mesmerizing spells. That also failed, and she began to yell out in pain, I ran across to her, but she too was dead before I could lay hands. Without an Enchanter and a Cleric, I was naked as a newborn baby dwarf. I took as much of the damage as I could, before Brell took me from the fight, placing me back inside Plane of Knowledge.   Suprisingly I discovered the Druid Lily, the Shadowknight Kary, and the Ranger Teeo both did not die. the Druid apparently shielded them and killed off the additional trolls. I found out later that the Ranger Teeo had also decided to pull a few at the same time I had, and this lead to the overwhelming force. we all got drug to the entrance of dulak from gunthak, and Akcron was escorted to the bodies to resurrect. We then continued fighting, without our Ranger for he had to leave. After several hours of attempting to get my medallion from the dock hands, I decided it was best to leave and head for other tasks.  I decided it was now the time to act against the nefarious Sir Lucan De'lere, Militia Leader of Freeport. He was turned away from the Truthbringer and had to be brought to justice. I summoned my greatest allies to my side, with exception of Ellektra and Akcron, for Ellektra was still sleeping, and Akcron promised another that she would assist him in the dungeons of Norrath. I called forth Feral Lord Deltree Sikholen, Konath Khaostar, Kretais, Vyoletta, and Shahlya to assist in this epic battle. Some were nervous that they would be hated by Freeport's militia forever, but I told them if they escaped to the commonlands in time, the guards would not notice their transgressions.  We arrived in Freeport, and lined up near the passage to escape, we discussed the plan, and I put it forth, running into the militia hour, glaring menacingly at the foul Lucan, and I hit him with the Holy Might of Brell. As the holy blast erupted his flesh and stunned his mind, I ran, he gave chase as soon as he could, but by then, the spirit of wolf had carried me to the common lands.  My allies then came up to lucan, who suprising to all of us, was all alone, Brother Jentry obviously quaking in his boots at the sight of a Holy Paladin of Brell. I returned from the commonlands, and began to strike the defenseless Lucan, pulling him closer and closer to the escape route before laying into him with everything brell has blessed me with. As lucan began to look deathly, I urged my allies to flee, while me and Shahlya continued to smash Lucan with our holy might. he fell, and in his place a Lich appeared! truly this man is the foulest of beings for he was truly dead inside. I summoned forth the holy power of Nife, imbuing my blade with retributive power against undead, and slayed him easily. No more would Lucan reign over the people of Freeport. I took his testimony that I would later need to give to the Truthbringers, in exchange for the Brilliant Sword of Faith.  I thanked my allies, unfortunately Kretais did not escape the yard of Freeport in time, and is also hated by Freeport now. I apologized to him, and Kretais, Konath and I went to West Karana to slay bandits. The bandits were hated by the priests of life, and I knew that I would have to prove myself to brother hayle before he would relinquish the firey sword Soulfire to me. I slayed well over a hundred bandits and retrieved fifty of their sashes, which I turned into Chesgard inside Qeynos, he then thought highly of me, and so the next day I summoned forth my allies Akcron, Kretais, and Konath, and along the way, Allies I haven't seen in ages joined my crew, Arymist the Wizard, and Katheena the Paladin. I thanked them for coming, and we all went into Infected paw, into their dungeons, where I spoke to brother hayle. he thought warmly of me, and handed me my soulfire once I had given him my testimony, the glowing sword hilt, the brilliant sword of faith, and a note I received from him months before. I took it into my hands and my allies did cheer! I was proud that I had earned such a powerful weapon, a true symbol of divine force. I conscribed a Bard to sketch a portrait of me and my allies, once he finishes the color work on it, I shall place it in my journal here, to help me remember my friends who helped me on this quest.  The rest of the night after I received soulfire I spent in Dulak, killing the armor smiths of the dastardly pirates. Soon I grew weary, and Arymist cast his portal spell to drag us across time and space to the Plane of Knowledge. Ah, I was home again, and there I rested for the night. With my final Prayer to Brell I spoke:  Praise be to Vyoletta! A fine cleric who aided me in killing Sir Lucan Praise be to Deltree! his fierce blows did strike fear in Lucan Praise be to Shahlya! a fellow Paladin who helped bring Lucan to Justice Praise be to Kretais! my dearest friend, always there when I need him Praise be to Konath! his mighty strength helped fell the Mighty Lucan Praise be to Arymist! who's Portals saved us in travel, and who's spells destroy evil Praise be to Katheena! Whose strength assisted me and reaching Brother Hayle Praise be to Akcron! the Gnomish Cleric, and Love of my life  If ever shall we meet, may it be as brothers, and not as enemies Ziggur Rathebringer

      This weekend Akcron, my trusted compatriot could not join me on my adventures, claiming something about a Gnomish Family reunion, I shudder to think. So I decided in her absence I would seek to make new allies in the Wayfarer's Brotherhood, and I met quite a few during my weekend long siege of the foul undead castle of mistmoore and it's dungeons. I met Hits It, another Gnome, and a roguish fellow, with a penchant for using masks of illusion to disguise himself, often times as a hated iksar. And Masri, another female Cleric, who lays down the holy smiting as much as she heals. I entered a total of 7 or more Mistmoore catacombs and crypts, slaying undead and I must say these crypts never empty! I seems as though more and more undead are created each day, and there is nothing we can do about it. Seems almost hopeless. Luckily the fellow Dwarf Vaun in the Wayfarer's camp has been passing me information about a brood war between different clans of Mistmoore vampires. I might someday be able to use this against the vile beasts. Time will have to tell. &nbsp; Unfortunately combat this weekend seemed to blur together, as each battle seemed much like the last, otherwise I would give you more details. The blessings of Virtue and Protection of the Nine now adhere to me, and those blessings make me more powerful than ever before. Look for many more fierce battles as I begin to hunt the Planes outside of Norrath.

      Last night when I woke, I was immediately invited to attend a raid against one of the dragons I have to slay in order to acquire a torn book that she holds. The Lady Vox. That same even Ice Dragon who I spoke of recently. I decided to attend, despite the fact that Akcron could not attend. I was more than a little worried that without my cleric, I may be doomed to die. This would turn out to be a logical fear.  When I arrived, Kretais and Ellektra were already there, and Konath was on his way. I nearly died getting lost in the ice goblins lair. But I made it and healed up. While we were plotting and waiting for more to attend our Raid, some foolish warrior probably went in to peek and see if Lady Vox was even home. Well she was, and immediately set to killing everyone, I screamed in terror, which is very unlike me and ran away, she must have put a spell on most of us, for a majority of us were running away.I died when I came back to assist those still living to kill her. Unfortunately it was I who died in doing so.   Luckily we had a ton of clerics on hand and a person there specifically for dragging bodies, we got resurrected, and continued our plans. Unfortunately one of our elder saviors had a pet who had found lady vox and was attacking her, while she was caught on the walls of her lair. I sat down seeing as there was no sign that Vox would be back to kill me again in a while, and I was recovering from the resurrection.  That's when it happened, while I was sitting an a ridge, I get knocked in the side and stand up, look over and there's lady Vox again, looking very upset at me, so I run, with the rest of the crew hoping to find safety as I was the youngest of the adventurers there. when I got into a corner, she stopped hitting me, and I felt reasonably safe that someone else was now keeping Lady Vox's attention. This was not the case, because as soon as I rounded the corner, I was slain by her again.   I got another Resurrection, and finally, we began to organize the raid, and our leader of this charge gave us all instructions, and he was a fine leader, for he knew exactly what we would need to survive, and how quickly things must be done. Unfortunately the elder's were casting spells that only people who have been around for 46 seasons or more could receive. I had not yet hit that mark, and thus I was nearly naked of enhancement. I got some dexterity from Kretais and I used my own paladin enhancements, but they pale in comparison to clerical enhancements. Luckily during the assualt on Vox, I did not die. She did manage to incite fear in me once, but I returned quickly and aided in the elimination of her.   The sad thing is, she did not drop the book that I had been looking for. However I did meet a man who claims he has several books from her, and will give me one when I am ready. I wrote down his name to not forget it, and will contact him when I have the other pieces of the book of scale. We all took sketches of us standing in front of lady vox's corpse, and it was a good day.   I took a teleport with a druid to the nexus and made camp in the Plane of Knowledge as I like to do. it was a great adventure, I just wish I could've claimed the book as my own. Perhaps Nagafen or the dragon of Skyfire might be more inclined to drop their half of my book.  If ever shall we meet may it be as brothers, and not as enemies, Ziggur Rathebringer

      I got water all over the last page I've written, and lost all of the hard work I had writing it, guess that's what I get for brewing ale while writing. The day following the raids on dulak, I met up with Kretais and Konath, they were going to go to Dulak again. I agreed as I knew the place well by now, but they said they had some shopping to attend to and meet back up with them later tonight. I made my way to south ro, for I had heard that there was an ancient cyclops that sometimes roams through that area, and that he has a ring that I could use.  When I made it out to South Ro, there was already a necromancer outside slaying younger undead. He asked me if I saw any Giants to let him know I told him sure, and he asked whether or not I was looking for anything in paticular, I told him I was looking for the ancient cyclops, and he said he was as well. I told him that since he was here longer he will get the prize. He wished me luck in attaining the cyclops as well, and I did the same, but by then Kretais had finished his shopping and decided that we should do a Dungeon adventure.   I met them at the Butcherblock Wayfarers camp. And learned we had a couple more on the way. We picked up a shadowknight whom I have forgotten the name, Rmdir, the 2nd Iksar I've ever really trusted, with an interesting style about him. And Jkaisi, a Vah Shir Beastlord.   We made our preparations, I blessed my weapon with the power of rodcet nife, and we went into the Mistmoore Dungeons looking for Gargoyle Claws. About halfway through the fighting the casters were low on mana, and so Konath tried plying his mana-sticks, a trick I've seen Konath do a couple of times. Rmdir was shocked that a warrior would be carrying sticks of mana in his pack, and began to question what they were made of. Never being one to let a trick fall short, as brell does like jokes from time to time, I told him they were made of crushed up manastones. Rmdir's eyes got even wider, and Konath then nearly struck me dead with his next sentence "two words... litter box" I laughed so heartily that I think Brell could hear us.  We continued on and easily dispatched the dungeon, getting all of our items that we needed. We began our hunt for the leader of the dungeon, but then it was our time to leave the dungeon before it locked us in, and we did not find the leader of the dungeon's minions.  When we returned to camp, 43 platinum was ours to be had from the gear the undead possessed. Our group left, and I waved farewell to Rmdir hoping to rejoin him again someday. I joined up with Akcron, a Paladin named Jas, Jkaisi again, and a Druid I believe. we entered another dungeon of Mistmoores, aimed at slaughtering 53 of the fiendish undead. Jas was in charge of baiting them to us, while I was the one who would pull the enemies off of her, and onto myself to swing at.   We completed that dungeon quickly and nearly destroyed the entirety of the dungeon dwellers, but once again, it became time to leave before the gates of the dungeon swung shut and locked us in for the evening.  After these battles I discovered that Kretais and Ellektra had placed themselves inside Karnor's Castle once again, and so I went to join them, Akcron thought we were hunting giants, but nay, we were to hunt more drolvarg's. Poor akcron has grown a phobia of Karnor's, and said that if she so much as faints that she will leave. I promised her that she would not fall not even once. and this promise was sealed with another cleric giving our group Temperence. I thanked that cleric, and we set off to kill many things.   Eventually a necromancer arrived in the entrance of Karnor's and began killing himself a path to the middle of the front battlements. I shrugged and hoped that he would not make it harder for me to find quarry. Suddenly a Drolvarg Guardian made his way to post in front of the entrance bridge. I ran forward to attack, and in the distance, I saw the skeleton of that necromancer bearing his way towards us. I had engaged the enemy, and he stole our quarry! I was irate, if I were a berserker I would have been in a rage by then. but being a paladin has taught me how to soothe myself. I told the necromancer not to steal our Quarry from us and he said he apologized for he had set his skeleton against it at the same time we assualted it, and he apparently has no control over this beast, else he could have easily told it to come back to him.  After that incident, Akcron and I decided to make way to the plane of knowledge to make camp. Kretais helped us get out, before returning to the new additions to his group, a warrior named Axes, and a bard whose name escapes me. It was a long night, but very productive.   If ever shall we meet may it be as brothers, and not as enemies. Ziggur Rathebringer

      I awoke the next morning to the kicks from Konath and the sound of battle. I nudged my head out of my tent and asked him what was going on. He told me that he had gotten up earlier and as soon as he got out of his tent he was recruited into this group he was fighting with currently. So I pulled my armor on, and picked up the hammer of silent screams, and joined up with the merry band. Nobella was our cleric, on a white horse she could heal all of our wounds with one powerful spell. We also had an Ogre Warrior, whose name I don't recall, and a Dark Elf Shadowknight.    It turns out we had room for another, so I sent word to Akcron to rise up and get herself to Dulak. She got her invisibility, and came running into the battle. Our shadowknight was very busy baiting many monsters, pulling more into our ambush right as we were killing off the last one he had baited. Eventually Nobella had to leave, and Akcron became main healer, she did a good job as always. We fought until Akcron grew weary, and she gated, and I once again went back to my tent in Dulak.  When I came back later, I managed to find a group fighting along the entrance, told them I would be on my way, and unfortunately on my way to meet up with them, drew the armory guards who slayed me. when I rematerialized in South Ro, I immediately got a message back from the cleric of the group asking if I wanted a resurrection I agreed and allowed them to take my body to a safe place to resurrect me. After the resurrection I assisted them in slaying many entrance guards and what not, the money wasn't great, and the enemies were lacking in numbers, and my hammer craved more action, so I recommended that we go to my spot near the warehouses. We went, and we had a fun time, Once again we had a dark elf shadowknight, who was baiting, and with a little convincing, I got him to bait more once we almost had one finished, and we chain lured them to their deaths for a great long time. It seems as though the assualt on Dulak will never end.   Eventually I got satisfied of fighting there, and decided to go home, my bags full of reclaimed pirate bounty, I got Spirit of Wolf from the Shaman of our group, and made a run for Gunthak. The run was dangerous, and became even more so when I hit the tide. I slowed down so much that the enemies I had chasing me caught up, and my body arrived in davey jone's locker. I rematerialized again in south ro and made way to Gunthak. After a short time, I found my body under the waves, reclaimed my gear, and swam to shore. Once I got to shore, I sold my bounty, and headed to PoK, by the tree, heaved a heavy sigh, and made camp in safety.  If ever shall we meet may it be as brothers, and not as enemies, Ziggur Rathebringer

      When I broke camp with Akcron two nights ago, we got a message from Kretais to make our way to the Dreadlands for he found a good spot to hunt, and also got a message that Konath needed a resurrection near the entrance of the Dreadlands. Akcron went to assist Konath with the resurrection, while I went to the Bazaar and found Akcron some better equipment for her hands and feet.   I bought Akcron 800 platinum worth of fine quality armor, and arrived back in Dreadlands to accompany them to the giant fort. Konath unfortunately did not have SoW, and Kretais was in trouble, being low on mana, and stuck in the Fort with no Melee assistance. I decided to leave Konath in the dust to make my way into the Fort, there was a lot of angry enemies to dodge, before I made it inside, and even once we arrived, the giants were very angry and in large number, we nearly lost our lives if not for the assistance of Akcron and her healing.   We eventually settled in and I received the necessary buffs to keep my abilities sharp, and my trusty Hammer of Silent Screams awake with healing power. We took out quite a few angry Giants while there, and picked up a Beastlord Jaggur Meister for a short time. Eventually he had to leave, Konath had left to hand in a piece of his epic to someone, so we decided it might be best to head out to Permafrost to help Konath further his pursuit to his epic.   We arrived in Everfrost Peaks, fought off some orcs and pumas. and eventually entered Permafrost. The goblins were unprepared for battle, not that goblins have much in the way of brains to plan a decent defense. We slaughtered them for quite some time, and Akcron, seeing no real need for her talents, gated and camped for the evening. While we camped a ritual site for the wizards of the Goblin horde. Kretais had called for a druid to assist us with tracking and killing the goblins, and eventually we got the frozen heart we were looking for.   After destroying the Goblins, we made our way deeper into Permafrost to assualt the Ice Giants, we killed several before we found one that had the block of permafrost we needed. It was here that I learned that these Goblins and Ice Giants worked for "the ice witch" also known as Lady Vox! Lady Vox is a dragon, and one that I must kill in an attempt to retreive the portion of a book I need to strengthen soulfire once I have completed that item.  We decided tonight was not the night to assualt the Ice Witch, so we heading out via the Druid teleporting us to the Nexus. After the teleport Kretais made camp, and Reiahla left us as well. Konath and I being the sole members of the group left, attempted to find someone willing to spelunk the Dungeons of Norrath, but no one was to be found. So we setup, and made a dash for Dulak, while the buffs Kretais applied still held. we made it quite easily, but the fight to find a safe spot to battle was more difficult.  I imagined it would be easiest to go toward the docks, then across to the warehouses. we fought our way to the docks, and nearly died in doing so, my hammer was helping, and Konath had bandages and was doing a reasonable job of patching me up after battle. eventually I got enough mana to cast my soothing spell, and I began to slowing manuever and soothe our way past the dock workers.  I spotted a Dock guard and began casting my soothe, my soothe did not hold on him, I could tell by his glare from that distance, so me and Konath began backing up quickly, until the guard stopped at his post. I began to attempt to make a group of dock hands soothed, but the guard started walking again! I held my breath as me and Konath slammed against the wooden building behind us, Konath was good at sneaking and so made sure to make use of this skill while we held still against that building, not breathing. It seemed like forever before he began to take off, but he did, and so did the other guard that showed up a bit later.  we safely made our way to the warehouse, I felt as though my sturdy stature could not hold my jumping heart! but we made it, and met up eventually with a cleric, and a few others began to join our group. We fought valiantly, and I grew stronger in doing so, we ended up with many treasures that night, and eventually Konath had to pack it in for the night. I understood, and so we both made camp that night in Dulak.   If ever shall we meet may it be as Brothers, and not as Enemies, Ziggur Rathebringer

      I awoke in Karnor's Castle, right where I camped, and my friends notified me they were on their way. I awaited them, and Ellektra, Kretais, Konath(who we recently saved from Runnyeye, though I do not remember when we did that :( seems my dwarven mind is slipping), and a new compatriot, and member of the Call of Honour Elos arrived. We setup just as we had before, only without a Cleric for a short time(Akcron was still sleeping in at the time I believe.) we fought hard for a decent length of time before Akcron finally broke camp, and headed over to join us. As she joined us, another of our Guild, an Arch Convoker and one of the elders of the guild, was not otherwise occupied and said he would come down to give us a hand in the raid on Karnor's.  That's when I decided I wanted to show Mordjan, the Arch-Convoker just how great our group was. Mordjan, had never seen my style of fighting, nor had he seen what my friends love to call a Ziggur Pull. Well eventually after a few warm ups, I managed to bait around seven or more Drolvargs and a few other things on top of us. Mord had a look of shock, as he said "Damn!" while we went after the enemy and dealt them swift death. The Arch-Convoker even admitted that he had gotten frightened by the pull, and that he had eliminated one of our enemies, just for safety reasons. I felt a great deal of pride, seeing as Mord is such an experienced Arch-Convoker, that he has seen many things even I have not. I look forward to becoming as experienced as Mordjan, and grouping with him, so that he may get the benefit of my fast and heavy style of fighting.   Eventually the ladies became tired, and decided to leave us, as did Konath. So it was just me and Kretais. It had been a while since it was just me and Kretais, but we decided to run off to Dulak, as we arrived in PoK Kretais began to recruit people for an assualt on Dulak Harbor, a place full of pirates and shifty types of people. We picked up MadCricket, and headed to the harbor. The run from Gunthak to Dulak has always gotten my heart to racing. It is like a decathalon, first you have to swim the gulf of gunthak from the lighthouse to the shore, then while dodging the undead shipmen who had crashed on the shores, you have to reach the tunnel, the tunnel is filled with man eating plants, sentient mushrooms, and infected drogmars as far as the eye can see, and if you are not invisible, you have quite the run ahead of you.   We made the run successfully, though I took a wrong turn ended up in nadox before running the right way and arriving. When we arrived we took over a boat, the Storm, a hardy boat and one not to be controlled by the pirates. So we began to dispatch the pirates, the top decks were full when we arrived, and empty once we were through, we ended up having to wait for their reinforcements before we could find anything to fight on ship again. Eventually another person met up with us, whose name I forget.   The new person told us of a location just as good as this one, but with better treasure and less downtime. So I took her up on her offer, and we ran our way to the Dulak Warehouses. When we got there, someone else was already there, and said he was hunting gems in a certain warehouse. We agreed not to bait his quarry out, and instead focus on our own.   Eventually the other man, Paladin I believe left, and we had control of the warehouse's. When this happened Kretais summoned forth a Druid Reiahla, and a Cleric. we spent a great deal of time there, and I managed to get a large amount of valuables before calling it an evening. It was a fun evening, and once we were complete the Druid teleported us back to Plane of Knowledge, where I sold my goods, and made camp. Came out with over 100 platinum pieces after that battle. not bad for a night.  If ever we meet may it be as Brothers, and not as Enemies, Ziggur Rathebringer

      Mental Note, remind myself never to place my journal in the bank, for interesting things always happen when you're without a way to write about them.  Woke up in Plane of Knowledge Again(Thank Brell!) and was immediately greeted by my associates in battle Kretais, Katheena, Ellektra, and Akcron. After discussing things a bit, it was decided that Karnor's Castle might be the place for us to conduct battle. the Drolvarg's were a pretty mean sort of creature, looking kind of like Gnolls, only taller and stronger. So we all went. Upon arrival, Akcron got herself into trouble and promptly died. I had to resurrect her. One she had been resurrected, we went invisible, and made a mad dash for Karnor's.   One thing to note, Drolvargs have sharp senses and can see through Invisability. When we got into Karnor's there were already a few people laying waste to the Drolvarg guards. After they saw our party, they moved further in, knowing we would handle the outer defenses. After we arrived, Katheena disappeared, I still have yet to figure out where she went. I mourn her loss if she has been taken by Brell to never return.  We spent a great deal of time assualting the outside defenses, and on occassion I would bait the battlements from their posts to chase me into the throes of awaiting death. It was only toward the end that the unfortunate began to happen.  Of course we had Ellektra with us, our enchanter who has a knack for dazing enemies so they do not attack us. Well we were doing a decent job, and I eventually bait a fair group of about 3 to 5 Drolvargs, and Ellektra is doing the best she can to hold the dazing effect up so we only have to deal with one of them at a time. Unfortunate for Akcron, and for the group, there was a Beastlord, I do not remember his name, but if I did I would curse it from here to Brell. he pulled even more monsters on us. Ellektra of course using her maximum ability to keep the enemies dazed, when the beastlord starts to kick random monsters, shaking them out of their dazed states and back onto me. Both myself and Akcron die in the resulting wave of death.   I start heading back, with Akcron deftly behind me. unfortunately by the time we reached Karnor's Entrance, looking back, Akcron had gotten killed by the spiders protecting the entrance. I managed to resurrect both bodies of Akcron, and she Resurrected mine. and we attempted to continue battle. but With the Beastlord there pulling too much for himself and causing nothing but trouble to us. we decided to call it a night. Akcron gated, and I decided that I would stay behind. I setup camp in a wall of the castle. hoping not to be seen. I was successful.   If I should ever meet that beastlord again, I hope he would be prepared to battle a Paladin of Brell, for he cost my allies greatly, and nobody harms my allies and gets away with it.   If ever we meet may it be as Brothers, and not as Enemies. Ziggur Rathebringer

      I missed a day in my journal entry, but luckily my dwarven mind is sharp enough to remember what it is that took place that evening.  Once again we decided to assualt the Lower Guk in attempts to destroy the Ghoul Arch Magi that we missed the night prior. So once again many of the familiar group assembled. Kretais was there, Ellektra was there, Katheena was there, Akcron was there, I was there, and two new additions to our team assembled Crucial, and Arymist a wizard who assisted me in obtaining a piece of the epic weapon SoulFire! we assembled near the Delly Tree in Plane of Knowledge, our Ally Kretais would not be able to stay with us for this battle, so he enchanted us with his mystical combat boosts and camped for the night. The rest of us, 3 paladins, a wizard, a enchanter and a cleric made way to the Innothule swamp as we had done the night prior.  Luckily a majority of us were accustomed to the location, and we sped quickly down into Lower Guk. Arriving in lower guk we fought our way, with me leading the way into the lowest level. Knowing of the traps in the floors helped us today, though the wizard did find himself a trapdoor, so I took it down with him just in case he was going to be attacked by that vile gnome that I know hangs around inside that trap. Luckily, no evil gnomes hiding in the basement, and we began our way upstairs.   I led the team over to the Ghoul Arch Magi which turns out a couple of people were already laying siege to, but they said they were doing it for sport, and we were doing it for a piece of a fabulous epic item for an Enchanter. The other group were interesting fellows, they said they were just trying to spend time with the undead frogloks, and they mentioned that these frogloks were a bunch of rascists attacking them for hanging around. I mentioned to them that perhaps if these frogloks were not undead, that they would receive a different response, and we all had a good chuckle.  We spent a lot of time inside the Magi room, and we got a little bored, so they sent me out looking for more action. I managed to bait quite a few enemies outside the Magi room, using a secret passage to bring the undead into our ambush. We killed many of them before the Magi showed up, and upon assualting him, he did not have the robe upon him that we were looking for.  Apparently we killed the wrong Magi, so we waited for the next Magi to arrive, while doing this, I charged forth, and found the Lord room, the same place I died the day prior. I asked the group if we wanted to challenge the Lord room. they agreed, and thus I baited the wizards and knights of the lord's antechamber into our Magi room, where we spent a great deal of time killing these undead off. We all had a good time, and were complimenting each other on our tactics, as another Magi appeared.   We took some time in killing him off, but once again, no Robe. Wrong Magi again, and eventually our group decided it was time to leave for the evening, another night in, and another night without this robe. Arymist gathered us around, and opened a portal back to the plane of knowledge. we teleported out, and camped for the evening.  The Next day, we didn't go back to Guk, instead we went to Karnor's Castle. More on that in the next entry.  If we shall meet may it be as brothers, and not as enemies, Ziggur Rathebringer

      Last evening I awoke in the same place I camped, thank Brell for that. As I said earlier we had a mission plan, and we attempted half of what we set out to do. When I first got out of the camp, I found out my ally Kretais was busy in Skyfire battling some rather large hoards, I also found that Ellektra, our Enchanter was otherwise occupied as well. So my trusty Cleric companion Akcron and I made our way to Emerald Jungle, because we heard the hunt would be good there. Sometimes it's nice to just go somewhere on safari and hunt. when we arrived to the cliffs of Emerald Jungle, we found our way down the staircase into the jungle. The jungle was lush, and the animals were no where to be found. After some hunting I came across a large mosquito, called a Soulsipper by most. I ran forward and shot arrows at it, it chased me and I began to hit it with my hammer to fair effect.   It was then that I realized the shouts of pain from Akcron, who was being pummeled by a gorilla. I attempted to taunt off the gorilla while providing my lay on hands to Akcron, but I wasn't fast enough, she fell dead before me, and I knew I was in trouble, running with all my might through the trees I was trying to find my way out of the jungle, but apparently I took a misstep, and was quickly killed by a reflective spirit. I found my body rematerialized at the soulbinder in Gunthak, and made my way back to Emerald Jungle to recovery our equipment.  While this happened Akcron had met up with Ellektra and began mustering forces to assist, I made the decision that since Ellektra was now with us, we should head to Lower Guk once I rescued out items from the jungle. We agreed and I made my way deeper into the forest. I eventually found my body, removing most of my equipment from it so that I could use it against anything that got in the way of my recovering the body of Akcron.  I found Akcron in the same place she had fallen, and I drug her body back while being assualted by 3 large mosquitos I eventually outran them, and found a quiet spot to cast my resurrection spell. Brell brought Akcron back to her corpse to recover her strength and equipment. I left her there in that safe place and returned into the jungle.  I made it to my body fairly safely, after having gone too far on the cliffs and almost being eaten by leeches. Down stairs I managed to grab my body and return it to the safe spot I left akcron at, and she blessed my corpse with brell and I recovered my strength. after recovering our equipment Kretais had completed his Raid on Skyfire, and made way to meet us at the Grobb stone in the Plane of Knowledge.  We returned slowly but surely to the Plane of Knowledge, and made our way to Innothule Swamp, home of the Frogloks. We had a new member of our group, another dwarf paladin named Katheena, she was upset for a man had mistreated her, but she turned that pain into strength as we went forth into battle.   When we made it into Upper Guk we did not realize the Frogloks of Guk did not take kindly to our Enchanter, but then again, many people distrust Dark Elves, even I distrust them, though Ellektra has proven in battle her worth. the Frogloks of Guk began assualting our enchanter so I fought a few of them off, and we fought our way into the passageway into lower guk, where forbidden things have occured for quite some time.   I found out that many of the lower guk denizens were undead, the foulest creatures on the entirety of Norrath. so I called upon the power of Rodcet Nife, and he imbued my hammer with the power of Life to slay these undead creations. and we continued on into Lower Guk. We almost got lost a few times, as Kretais said that we needed to go North, but his map was not very clear of this place. So I eventually found the lower level that did go north. came across a blood pool, I had a strange feeling in my beard that this was going to be trouble.  Cautiously I attempted to walk around the pool of blood, as I had a feeling it may be a trap, well it turned out that the space around the pool was the trap, and I landed in a pit, assualted by a mean nasty gnome and his pet skeleton. A necromancer! worse than the undead themselves! by brell's beard I must destroy him. so I fought him, while my friends were all looking for me. Eventually Kretais found me then the rest, and we set out to dispatch this corrupted gnome. This gnome was no child of Brell for sure, and it seemed as if the battle would last forever as my hammer kept missing it's mark. Knowing how poor I am with blunt weapons, I always carry my two handed darkforge sword, so I switched to that, and began causing havoc, as blow after blow began to land on him, eventually he fell, and we rested for a bit. after a little rest Akcron and I went spelunking further into the area, following someone I had seen earlier moving north.  When I got to the spot I had seen the man walk to, he had become a skeleton, I realized this is often what necromancers do, but I figured this Necromancer was fighting other undead, and it is better to realize an enemy to be your ally, until he stops fighting your enemies, so I decided not to challenge this individual for his beliefs, and instead asked him if this was where the Arch Ghoul Magi was to be found. The Necromancer seemed to know who I was referring to, so he led me and Akcron back into another area, with a library and a cot, and said that this was where the foul Magi lived. he then took out one of the guards that was in the room, and took off. Meanwhile I was fighting off another of the guards and sent Akcron out to lead the group back to our location. they made it to my location, and after dispatching the guards, we setup camp inside the room.  It took a long time for the magi to return, so I sat in the cauldron, ducking down so only my eyes made it over the lip of the cauldron, and teased the others that I was invulnerable inside the potted steel. they then further teased me by dropping various ingredients in with me, and talking about how tasty Dwarf Stew was. I played along and pulled out my garnish and spices, and poured a jug of sauces over my head. Then I began to pull out my wine from my pack, and began to drink. Claiming the whole time of course to be "marinating" myself. everyone got a good chuckle, and began to laugh even harder when they started saying they couldn't understand me.   I must say I have a weakness for the bottle, but I recover quickly and I have yet to meet a dwarf who couldn't drink and still fight. Akcron began telling me how she would help me get off this addiction. I told her it was no addiction, I just enjoyed the feeling. We hung out in the Magi's room for a great long while, and killed a few guards who returned to the room. but eventually our Vah Shir friend Kretais had stated that he grew weary of the battle, and that we should return home.  I led the way out, only to find out I led too well, half of the group was not behind me, and as I turned around more undead frogloks attacked me, so I was fending them off while hunting for the others of our group. Well it turned out I began to hear Katheena grunt from the blows of battle, and I cried out asking where she was, she was in the trap that we fell in earlier. Now equiped with the power of levitation I floated down right as Katheena grew weak and was about to fall, and laid my hands upon her, rejuvenating her back to decent health. I told her to climb the ladder as I began to taunt the attackers away from her. Apparently brell blessed her, for she disappeared out of view of all for a time, such that the undead forgot she existed when she returned to view.   After taunting the evil Gnome off of Katheena Akcron had been rooted by the vile corruption of Brell's creation. I couldn't get the Gnome off of Akcron sadly and she died. so I ran up the ladder and noticed the pained sounds of Ellektra running through the hall, I ran around trying to find her, only right as I found her and was about to cast my strongest healing spell, she collapsed dead. I could not find out ally Kretais anywhere either, we just all got lost and seperated, and that made us all dead. I tried to escape to the upper guk area, but I made a wrong turn, and my heart fell into my stomach when I wound up standing face to face with the Arch Ghoul Lord.the undead closed in behind me, and I fell dead. I learned later that Kretais was lucky and managed to gate out before being killed.  Anyone who knows me, and knows paladins, we are knightly people, and I uphold the art of Chivalry, so when I heard that Katheena was all alone trapped inside Guk with no safe way out, I scrambled to assist, unfortunately being without my equipment I attempted to rely on my spells. I had made it down into lower guk, but I did not make it much farther than the entrance before I was slain yet again. By this time Kretais had assembled a fine group of rescuer's, they were a Warrior, a Wizard, and a Cleric. they ran in, made a path and began to resurrect us. They found one of my bodies without error, and once Akcron and Ellektra got resurrected they took their stuff, meditated and gated out. I however stayed behind for I was the last one resurrected and Kretais was lost as to where my corpse may have been. I guided the troops to the appropriate spot, using nothing but my summoned hammer of wrath and my halo of light to guide my way. Brell must've given me strength, not to mention the cleric's temperance because I marched ahead and managed to help the Warrior clear the path for our group. Eventually I met back up with Katheena, informing her that we were coming to pick up my body and that we were going to then teleport away together. she was happy that we had finally made it down to salvage her.   The Warrior pulled my body out, they resurrected it, and we all ported away. Needless to say, it was a messy evening, and I have learned a very important lesson. when the group splinters and get's lost, there is no hope to survive, only through preserverence and close unity can a group survive against powerful enemies. I will always look behind me when leading the way, to ensure no one gets left behind. Tonight perhaps we shall return to that rotten place, and finally meet that arch magi. but now it's time for me to rest.  If we meet may it be as brothers, and not as enemies, Ziggur Rathebringer

      Couple of nights ago I woke up in the East Commonlands, I remember clearly making camp near the tree at the bank in the plane of knowledge, for some reason the gods chose to move my camp whilst I was sleeping. I do not understand why this is, but I accept those things as the mysteries of life on Norrath. I also awoke and found my special compass I have acquired had been replaced with a very basic piece. I will have to forage for another later.  I met Kretais and Akcron near the tree where I like to make camp. We gathered up and after receiving the blessings of wolf from Kretais we made our way to the Great Divide, for we had chosen to assist my honorable cousins the Coldain Dwarves of Froststone. We had decided to assualt the fortifications of the Ry'Gorr Orc Tribe.  The assualt went fairly well, Kretais decided that he would bait the Ry'Gorr away from their posts so that we could assualt them away from their reinforcements, we spent some time doing this, and I was so happy assisting my icey brethren that I toasted our acheivements with red wine and ale. it was a good night, but eventually our resolve grew weary and it was once again time to camp, so back to the Plane of Knowledge we went, and I set up camp and rested.  We have since discussed battle plans, and I have discovered an ally Konath has found himself stuck inside Runnyeye, so tonight we plan to assist him in escaping runnyeye, and once we have rescued our dear friend, we shall help our new Guildmember Ellektra with obtaining some of her pieces of an epic Enchantress item that she desires inside Lowest Guk. I hope our raids on these locations are successes, and we shall find out tonight.  If we meet may it be as brothers, and not as enemies, Ziggur Rathebringer

      Last night was rather slow, I started the day with making a run to HighHold Keep on bequest of my dear friend Riktolas Klawdriver, he had told me that an ally in battle had been slain and was awaiting a ressurection, I set out to do just that, he told me there was a cleric there already but she kept getting lost. So I trekked out there, only to find the corpse had already been handled. so another run out of HighHold Keep back to the plane of knowledge, and I was back to doing what I set out to do originally.  I needed to work on my pottery, the wheel has so far mystified me, course I can now make the simple ceramic container with ease and skewers are even easier, but I decided to do something challenging and useful, the smoker. It took a while, and several prototypes before I even began to make fairly decent smokers. I had been doing this because I wanted to get better in tune with the art of pottery, so I could make the dye vials I would need to finish some gifts for my friend Sazlan.   Eventually I felt confident enough to make the vials required. So off I went to Gunthak for supplies, once I got there, I spent 350 platinum on the material for 10 Prismatic Dyes, I went to the brewing barrel in Plane of Knowledge, and produced 10 Prismatic Dyes, then I walked to the pottery wheel, and made 6 Dye Vials. 4 of the vials either shattered or burned inside the kiln, I don't know what they make the unfired vials out of, but it smells atrocious, get's all over your clothing and hangs there for a good week.   I took the finished vials I had back to the brew barrel and pours the dye into the vials. I now have 6 vials of prismatic dye. I gave them all to Sazlan, who used 3 of them, and will share them with my other friend Akcron. I must say that female Vah Shir have a way to tempt the strongest resolve. The Beauty of the Vah Shir is great, but whenever I get lost in looking at Sazlan, I think of Akcron, and snap out of it, before Akcron catches me looking and bonks me on my helmet.

      Two nights ago I awoke from camp, and began my recent progress toward gaining enough favor from the Wayfarer's to acquire a powerful set of Plate Sleeves. I joined a powerful group to do a high risk adventure, and we succeeded, everyone disbanded the group and I awaited the return of a couple of my allies to start my own group for 1 more high risk adventure that would allow me to get the sleeves I desired.  The group was a ranger Gwean, Disciple Tikob, Mystic Kretais, Cleric Akcron, Channeler Arymist, and myself. The group was slow to organize but once organized we had our Monk be the bait while I acted as tank pulling them off of the monk. After a few kills, we encountered a bat. I had forgotten how badly Bats hate light, and so I summoned forth a flash of light to blind the bat, who then proceeded to run in fear, and brought a large army of undead upon us. I died while ensuring others escaped, got resurrected, apologized for my error, and we continued.  The monk then started pulling pairs of enemies, which were causing a lot of havoc, as they were dealing a lot of damage to us. Eventually poor Akcron died, then I died, and most of the party died. When our chances of completing our collection of materials for the wayfarers was at it's lowest, the Ranger Gwean left our group. We shall remember this and never group with him again.  The loss of one of our front line fighters resulted in the odds being higher, and our resources being lower. We still kept our heads high and tried our hardest to succeed, but in the end, we failed to perform our task. we sulked out of the dungeon, licked our wounds, and camped for the night.  Last night, upon waking from my slumber I head someone shouting in the Plane of Knowledge that a Nagafen raid was forming to slay the Fire Dragon. I accepted this call, and waited for others to join our band of adventurers. It soon became clear that raid leadership could not make up it's mind, many leaders bowed out of the position, and eventually as we made way to nagafen's lair, someone became leader and was not responding to our requests, so I requested leadership, but by then morale was so low that many of our raid disbanded from us and returned home, so many had left, that the raid was no longer survivable. I became Raid Leader, and decided that the raid was a dead horse, and there was no reason to kick it any longer. Made way back to the plane of knowledge and camped.  I would like to congratulate my honored Friend Kretais, his elders of Shar Vahl have dubbed him worthy of the title Baron. I only hope that soon the dwarves take notice of my contributions and do the same for me. I would also like to congratulate my good wizardly friend Arymist on his being inducted into our special band of friends. Peace be with you, and the rest of Justice Eternal.  Hopefully today's adventures turn out far better than any that have come before. I intend to investigate the Mistmoore catacombs, and attempt again to gain enough favor for the mighty armplates to replace my simple Acrylia Studded Leather I've been wearing for quite some time now.  If ever shall we meet may it be as brothers, and not as enemies. Ziggur

      Two nights ago I woke from camp, and found Akcron peddling her Temperance inside the Plane of Knowledge, she said she was seeking an adventure, later while we were waiting for more people to join our adventuring party, an old friend Shimara arrived and wanted to also adventure. We joined together, not to do Mistmoore Dungeons, but instead the frightful Miragul Dungeons. I had only been there once before, and was not prepared for what was to happen.  We arrived and picked up a ranger and a Shadowknight, and proceeded into battle inside Everfrost dungeons. The first few rooms of the dungeon were filled with spiders and bears. Easy enough for our team to handle. But as we grew further back, we ran across Magic wielding goblins. The room we originally encountered these nasty threats seemed a basic room, with 1 goblin in the middle, and a couple on the outskirts that seemed far enough away from the central goblin that I should be able to shoot and arrow at him and have him run my way. Being low on Divine Energy I could not pacify the others in the room.  When I shot the goblin, all of the friends in that room proceeded to chase our party down. Our Druid attempted to evacuate us, but died while trying frantically to memorize the spell. then Akcron Died, and I decided it was best to beat a retreat. Most of us made it out alive. I ran back in to Rez Akcron, who then rezzed our Druid Shimara. We went and attempted again, since we had killed 3 of the beasts last time it seemed safer, so I began to pacify the room, but 2 spotted me on the side before I could pacify them, and they gave chase, again about 5 goblins mowed me down in seconds, and took the rest of the party.  We were determined though, even with our Ranger ducking out on us, I died again later on in the dungeon as the mage's in the dungeon were powerful. We eventually overspent our safe time in the Dungeon without completing our tasks and left a failure. My Shaman friend Kretais swore not to go back there, but I told him that we should not let thse set backs prevent us from these endeavours. I suggested we go back for vengeance, when properly outfitted with a Enchanter to assist us. As I know Ellektra, the finest enchanter I've met, would easily have prevented all the carnage that took place. She is wise, and powerful, and we definitely appreciate it when she is with us.  I laid down camp with a heavy head, and I only hope the next battle I go into, turns out better than the last.  If ever shall we meet may it be as friends, and not as enemies, Ziggur
