      Happened to be driving up from Buckingham yesterday afternoon, between 2 and 3 in the afternoon. The road was beginninig to get busy, but hadn't yet reached critical mass of stationaryness. In other words, you were able to do 70-80 mph if you didn't mind being too close to the vehicle in front.  There was a lorry, I forget the name of the company unfortunately, it wasn't an artic, but it was bigger than a Luton van. It was Hovis lorry sized, your general delivery truck. Anyway, it was doing 80, weaving in and out of lanes, including the outside lane, which as far as I am concerned should be Forbidden to anything larger than a 4x4, and it struck me that, given the time of day, he was the sort of driver who would cause the traditional 4-5pm holdup.  He passed Junction 25 at around 3 pm - within 20 minutes he'd be up to Junction 28 where a long climb is succeeded by a steep descent combined with a sharp (for the motorway) curve. And if he was still trying to progress at that rate, as the traffic built up and the road conditions changed, he was likely to fuck up in a big way, in the 5Live Travel, "A lorry has shed its load..." kind of way.  It's people like this who are responsible for the worst of our road problems. Speeding motorists have less time to react to mistakes and have more accidents, which cause traffic jams.  On the same subject, the worst and naughtiest thing I ever do on the road is to undertake on the motorway, because I'm sick of having to deal with the middle-lane huggers. There was one this morning as I joined the motorway at J25. She was doing 60 mph in the middle lane and the majority of the traffic, therefore, was queued up in the outside lane, attempting to get past her. They were then compounding the problem by staying in that lane because there was a lorry about 100 miles ahead of them in the middle lane, and they all live in fear of being "trapped" behind a lorry and people "not letting them out."  My counter to this is to either: always, check my mirrors, signal my intention to pull out, a good 8 seconds notice, check my mirrors again, and then pull out. So fucking what if the BMW or Audi in the outside lane has to use his brakes? It's not like you just suddenly swerved out without warning.  Strategy number two is the undertaking manoevre. And this morning I used it. Felt good about it. Undertook her, the inside lane being largely empty, and scooted off up the road, leaving her and the queue of angry, frustrated drivers behind. You're not supposed to do it, because people have a blind spot and are likely to pull in without signalling, which they don't have to do, but they never do, do they? They just hug the middle lane because they are afraid to do anything else. Anyway, I had a pleasantly quiet journey to work, because she continued to hold up traffic all the way up to J26, where I left the motorway.  Middle lane huggers, like speeders, cause holdups because people do have to queue up behind them. All the speeding motorists catch up with each other and tailgate merrily along, an accident waiting to happen.

      When Kurt Cobain was in a bad mood he described himself as being "pissy". That's how I feel. Like Kurt Cobain. Blonde and dead. Not really, but I am in a BAD MOOD.  Not only did my wife have the car yesterday, emptying the petrol tank so that I had to fill up on the way to work this morning making me Even Later, but there were road works on the A60 which held me up even more again, which I would have avoided if I had not had to detour down the petrol-getting route. And then just to turn the knife blade in my belly the sunglasses have gone out of the car AGAIN! If I'd wanted people to remove the sunglasses from the car what's the betting that they would ALWAYS GET LEFT IN IT!  Right, down to business. White short wheelbase truck owned by a company called Lievers. Reg FG52TVT. I was on the ringroad doing 50. 40 mph speed limit, dual carriageway. Approaching traffic lights where there is congestion ahead and the road narrows to single carriageway. Van is behind me. Yes! He sped up and overtook me (he must have been exceeding the speedlimit by at least 50% because I was already a crazy lawbreaker) and pulled in just in front of me before slowing down because of the traffic jam ahead. The nice touch is that he completely blocked my view of the road ahead.  Why did he overtake me? Just abuse, that's all.  PS. Sorry for any spelling and grammar errors: I'm in a very bad mood.

      Went for a breezy bike ride yesterday morning. A warm day, but windy, and I really am pathetic against a head wind. I just want to stop pedalling and fall over on the grass verge, weeping.  Roadside detritus included: the red lid of an aerosol can of lighter fluid; McDonald's packaging; a half-empty bottle of Irn Bru that could have been urine; a few England flags; and hundreds and hundreds of empty fag packets.  Smokers.  Not only are they happy to kill themselves, make the rest of us put up with the smell of their clothes breath, make themselves look ten years older than they are, with their yellow skin and Smoker's Face, but they also insist on throwing their empty packets out of the car windows, an additional fuck-you to the world.  I would like to start here the rumour that smoking causes Alzheimer's Disease. Quite clearly, people "forget" about the existence of litter bins whilst smoking. It's an early symptom.

      My kids went to London by coach on Saturday.  When they got home they told me how they were almost involved in a motorway accident.  Apparently there was a car in front of them as the coach was heading home. Another car came by them, overtaking in a perfectly normal way. It then pulled in again in front.   Still fine, except that it clipped the front of the car in front of the coach, causing it to veer into the hard shoulder where it managed to screech to a halt.  The car that caused the accident went into a 360 degree spin, amid a cloud of smoke, narrowly missing the central reservation before finding itself facing in the right direction again.  Now we all know that where there is blame there is a claim, so the driver of the spinning car just floored it away.  It is an amazing thing that nobody was killed and that it didn't turn into a pile-up.  I'm told that the coach driver reported it to the police at the next lot of motorway services. But you and I all know that the driver who was to blame was probably not the vehicle's owner, but, probably, was one of the 60% of under-25s; driving under the influence of drugs. Perhaps he didn't even notice the accident.  Let's hope he didn't notice because otherwise something as scarey as that might be prone to making someone dung their pants up with poo.

      This is a terrible thing because I have to admit that I've become quite blase about people who drive like fools.  This blog has been cathartic for me. You see, I've come to realise that every car journey I make will entail interaction with at least four crazy suicidal/murderous idiots whose flame should be snuffed out for being rude, selfish, and a danger to themselves and others.  I've also realised that we blank all these bad people from our minds. They exist only in short term memory and our past. And perhaps that is a Good Thing.  Is it that I have run out of things to say? Negatory! It is the opposite. I have become overwhelmed with the utter number of stoopid driving incidents in which I unwittingly participate: I've lost the will to rage.  Let's talk about fine old forms of transport then, from the days before the world became fast, false, and flabby. Lovely lovely horses...  I see lots of horses because I sort-of live in the country. Well, not really; just not in the unending badlands of student-accomodation lifestyle creditsville. There are often horses around. They are bad road users. They never use their mirrors, and drive far too slowly to be safe on the roads.   Sometimes they are suspended in a mode where they are overtaking each other but never quite manage it, so they are permanantly two abreast, locked together in the fabric of space and time, like a binary star system, or like a brace of overtaking lorries on a hill on the A1.   Their legs also snap very easily. Most of them are driven by teenage girls too. Oh yeah, and they are chicken-shit scared of noise or sudden movement.  I always avoid horses when I'm driving, and on the country roads that take me home, I always drive as though there is a horse around the next bend. I have to, because otherwise one day I will have my car transformed into a plate of mashed girl and horse leg drummers.  Most people who use those roads don't drive that way. They have "5 minutes from home" syndrome, where the only objective is to drive as fast as possible and cut corners and overtake anyone who is in front.  I had to swerve out of the way of a fat old man driving a car, who had rounded the blind hilltop bend between Gotham and East Leake only to discover that there was not one but two slow horses being driven in front of him. He didn't even attempt to slow down; he just went faster and swerved onto my side of the road. It was a close thing.  Many times I've slowed right down so as not to spook horses, only to watch as someone in a silver or red salesman's car came blasting through on the other side of the road, as though the horse and I had slowed down out of respect for them and to give them plenty of room to drive as fast as possible.  I think maybe many drivers don't understand horses. They think of them as slow motorbikes that shit all over the place. It's like schoolkids who have no idea about something that was common knowledge in my day: even the slow kid in the class wouldn't have had to think about it. When you see cluelessness in young undergraduates, it strikes you as funny. They have no general knowledge.   But it is just a sign of the times. General knowledge is obsolete, like mental arithmetic and spelling. It's all done for us now. People don't need any irrelevant knowledge cluttering their busy celebrity minds - if they need an answer they access the web via a mobile phone...  www.askjesus.uk.co.... Q. "what is a horse?" A. "A slow moving scooter that shits all over the place. Download polyphonic ringtones here..."

      There appeared to be a bit of a flag shortage on the roads this morning. Maybe the shops have run out? Saw one greedy white van with a painted red cross and  six  flags. Must be a Henman fan.  A couple of other cars and a pickup truck or two were the only other flag wavers in evidence.  It's one of those mysteries we may never solve.

      Interesting amount of debris on the roads this morning, following the Freak Summer Gales yesterday and overnight.     England Flag Count: 14    Brick Count: 1    Branch Count: 72    Lumps of Scrap Metal on A610 roundabout From Psycho Truck Driver: 1    Boys and girls, it's worth remembering that following too closely behind lorries in town traffic (or anywhere) can be Bad for Your Paintwork.

      Quite pleasantly surprising this morning, in the pouring rain, not to find Snottingham drivers adopting their usual bad weather tactic of driving everywhere in reverse, with their eyes closed. The roads were almost serene, as if the blinding spray was happening somewhere else.  It helps to have some good music on, I find. Something you can really get into and enjoy. I still find the greatest pleasure in making compilations, burning them onto CD, and giving them a listen in the car, seeing how they work. I'm not sure, but I don't think your iPod playlist would work in quite the same way; too easy, too ephemeral, just another menu item.  And I'm almost insulted by auto-generated playlists and party mixes. Do people have no self respect? People who want everything done for them, everything on auto, I hope they're all on trains.

      Last night I had the pleasure of driving through Loughborough just after the football had finished. You'd think THEY'd just won a war, and peace had been declared after years of needless death and destruction. Yes indeedy, people! Cars and their drivers were driving around in a seemingly random way - ignoring good sense and driving roughshod through lights and road junctions, engines thrashing, twat flags & Very-Big-Flags-of-Righteous-Patriotism-But-Secretly-Closet-Nazi a-waving, and horns a-hooting.  FOR FUCK'S SAKE! England won a game of football! That's all. Just a single game in the early stages of another series of games. And another thing that really gets my goat. What do the headlines mean by WE've done it? Don't they mean THEY've done it? If they are talking about WE when they say WE've done it, the headlines must surely refer to SOME OF US WHO ARE NOT PART OF THE ENGLAND TEAM driving around like fucking irresponsible idiots, drunk and pissed up on drugs.  The best Cunt though was the one in East Leake who had more flashing lights underneath his car than there are at the Nottingham Goose Fair. What's that all about then? It's about time that blue/purple/white LEDs on cars were banned. Those drivers should concentrate their efforts on growing up.  I haven't posted on here for a couple of days because my computer got hijacked by a particularly tenacious trojan browser plug-in that kept redirecting me to someone's search engine page (they must get paid on number of hits) and providing me with random helpful product information (in this day and age every mofo needs advice on where to get cheap drugs afterall). Anyway, it has gone now. I killed it with superior skill and acumen.  My last righteous comment concerns the driver of the bus I was on this morning: he stopped at 3 bus stops for a Really Long Time. You know; long enough for other buses to arrive and go again. What's that about then? I mean if you total up everyone's time that he wasted it probably came to like 30 hours or something. That's a lot of humanity. The only plausible excuse I could come up with is that it was power-crazed megalomania or just for a laugh. Or maybe he'd been out on the piss last night with the gang, after watching "the beautiful game" (as the effete aspiring-middle-class sport pseuds like to call it) and had to stop every now and then to get his breath back and prevent himself from vomiting.  (Turns round again for a slight return....) And another thing. Someone told me the other day that you can buy upgrades for cars now. They cost a couple of hundred quid and they make the car use more petrol and stuff. Or make the engine louder. Or make the car go PWAH when you change gear, like on formula one racing cars. What's that all about then? As far as I'm concerned it is symptomatic of the computer filled age we live in. Upgrade this! Upgrade that! It's just another product marketing scam based on analogy with the computer industry. You watch: soon we will buy car use on a rolling subscription basis. It's a good thing therefore; anything designed to fleece stupid people of their cash and hurry them onwards towards their death in a teenage motoring accident is a Good Thing. That's why I am so in favour of LED upgrades for cars as well.

      I try to be patient, honestly, I do. But you know when you are familiar with a route, and know well the periodicity of the traffic lightage? How it will be on red for a lonog time, and on green for only 0.00004 seconds? A period of time that requires a nukular clock to establish.  So when I am sitting behind someone who is drunk or on drugs, and they take fucking ages to notice that the lights have changed, it sometimes causes a little smidgen of rage to boil up within me. Friday night, I was following someone so drugged up it was like he was in a different time zone.  He pulled away (late) at one set of lights, and accelerated down the road towards a red light - this is where the trams are, so there are a lot of unnecessary red lights that stay on randomly in case a tram is in the vicinity. So this light is red, and he accelerates towards it, but with seredipitous timing, it changes to green as he approaches it. Only  then  he chooses to slow down for the red light just gone! So he slammed on the brakes, and then took  ages  to realise that the light was now on green.  I bet the world was all just pretty colours, far as he was concerned. Or he'd dropped his crack pipe down the front of his trousers.

      No trouble this morning! I think most people who drive aggressively are off today, following a night on the piss in the wake of Engerlundland's failing to loose in the Euro 2004 xenophobic jousting competition. Here's a short interlude until normal service can be resumed.  I was on a bus once on Leytonstone High Street in North-East London. The bus stopped at a bus stop to allow passengers to get on. This act blocked the view of a car driver in a side street, preventing him from pulling out into the main road.  The car driver hit his horn.   The bus driver shouted something like "be patient!"  The car driver got out of his car and got on the bus. He then threatened the bus driver with violence.  The bus driver closed his doors, with the car driver still on board. He then drove off and stopped about a mile away at the other end of Leytonstone High Road.  The car driver just stood there in stunned silence. When the bus finally stopped he just got off and started walking the mile back to his car.  People on the bus cheered.  I was most impressed. That's my kind of bus driver.   Of course that sort of down-to-earth righteousness would be impossible these days as the car driver would be likely to pull out a gun and blow the bus drivers head off.

      I tell you, whoever thought of having a Jolly Roger on their car instead of the George's cross, that's genius, that is. It made me thnk further on, apropros of what we were talking about a  urlLink couple of weeks ago,  that it would be quite useful for drivers to display flags in accordance with the  urlLink International Maritime Signal Flags.     urlLink Like this one.  Which means, "Keep clear of me, I am manoevering with difficulty."  Or   urlLink "I require a pilot."   Or this one, especially for Simon:  urlLink "Stop carrying out your intentions and watch for my signals."   For road ragers, I especially recommend:   urlLink "You should stop, I have something to communicate."  With a baseball bat.  And for the Outside Lane Of The Motorway Posse:   urlLink "My engines are going full-speed astern."   Let's see how long this takes to be circulated by email by people pretending they thought of it first.

      Heh, I bet that title caused a few disappointed surfers to click the "back" button.  It's not completely inappropriate. In a sort of metaphorical way.  This morning I had to give my wife a lift to the hospital (work, this time). This happens usually at 6am. You would think that things on the roads would be calm at that time wouldn't you? Free roads, plenty of room, no rushing, etc etc etc. NOT SO.  I don't know why, but people seem to drive much more aggressively at that time of day (tiredness, frustrated expectation of a fast clear road, still drunk and pissed up on booze from the night before, late for work (shift workers)? I dunno what.)  On my short journey today I was tailgated 4 times, overtaken aggressively twice, cut up three times, and "undertaken" twice (one of which while I was exceeding the speedlimit by 50%).  Check this uber-twat out (S63BHW) though - clear road, dual carriageway, I'm in left hand lane doing 50 (max speed is 40) but I'm readying myself to slow down for a built-up area just ahead where I need to turn left, nothing behind, nothing in the right hand lane. Slip road to my left. Car comes up it parallel to me at about the same speed. And I'm thinking "when is he going to slow down, because he is running out of road?"  The answer was "never". He waited until he got right to the end before flooring the accelerator, and pulling out literally feet in front of me, cutting me up, to move into the right hand lane. I had to brake sharply.  But why? I had right of way, I was going too fast anyway so I wasn't slowing him down, there was nothing behind. he could have eased off the gas for 1 second, slipped in behind and dropped into the right hand lane. Exquisite and perfectly executed. But no.  That wouldn't have been insulting or cuntish enough, would it? He was the sort of man that would make his wife suck his cock in front of his laughing ugly mates. Then ask if they want a go with her. Just so as she knows her place.

      A special "Rimmel" flag for the woman in the Fiat Bravo in front of me, who was applying her mascara in heavy traffic. Kept creating a gap in front of her so that sharper minded motorists could nip in front of her, thus causing me a longer delay than there would have been otherwise.  Congratulations, and I'm sure you look beatiful with mascara smudged up your forehead. Next time, just get a tin of paint, empty it, and wear the tin on your head.

      No rage for me today. I adopted serenity for the morning, which involved not looking at Bad Things and adopting the Duck and Cover tactic of using the inside lane of the motorway as much as possible. I did this yesterday also, driving 160 miles and achieving 53 mpg, which is pretty durn good.  I had a cabbage and a meat cleaver in the boot, and I certainly wouldn't have wanted to explain that to anyone. I did see an interesting, and German, white van, driving slightly too fast for the traffic conditions (he narrowly avoided a shunt as we approached one stationary/slow stretch). The name on the van was Blitz Transporte. Which I thought was nice. I hope he went to Coventry driving that.  Like driving through Dresden in a van with "Firebomb Couriers" on it or something.

      I was behind a van the other day. A big white one with no windows. It was obstructing my view of the road ahaead. That makes me uncomfortable so I left plenty of white space between us.  You know how much I love people who don't bother with signals when they drive. In fact I even thought that a lack of signalling was a fashion statement at one point.  After a while behind this van I came to realise that not only was he not doing any indicating at all, he was also not using his brakes. Deaf, dumb and blind. Fantastic.  I was well impressed until he took a sharp right at the Raleigh Island, and then I saw that he was on tow.  It would have been apparent normally that a vehicle was on tow because the tow truck had flashing orange lights on top, but this van was so monolithic that you couldn't see the truck in front. It was higher and wider than the truck.  Now its strikes me that it was pretty dangerous, which is good. And illegal, which is good. But I would have thought, as my wise compardre Mr Neil has said, that the driver has a duty to put the keys in the ignition and operate the lights as he steers and brakes? (last sentence spoken with australian infelection)  Is this a common arrangement when towing vehicles?

      As we were saying in my loud Mind, I got overtaken on the West Bridgford side of Trent Bridge by a silver mini-cab. He was in the right-hand lane. What he actually meant to do was get into the left hand lane behind me to turn left into West Bridgford. Funny that. Still - no need to worry. His mistake was easily solved by viciously cutting me up. Notice how in my Mind cars have gender and personalities.  Right, West Bridgford... and Edwalton... and Rushcliffe in general. All the roads from those areas into Nottingham are very congested at peak times. This morning, I read the development plans from Rushcliffe Borough Council who need to find an additional 8000 houses over the next couple of years.  Why do they need to find 8000 houses? What is going on? Is it a secret demographic explosion?  I talked with my wife, and we thought about a number of things at play... a) People need two houses because they are divorced b) Couples now tend to keep two properties anyway (ready for the good day when they decide to divorce?) c) Make money my boy! d) There are a large number of people moving to the UK from abroad (either refugees, assylum seekers, or good-life hopefulls) -  want to be careful here that this is not a non-PC comment. Historically, immigration has been a good thing for culture and economy in Britain - it is just plain matter of fact according to my wife that the number of non-British-born residents (colour not involved either, note) she treats at the hospital has rocketed over the last couple of years. e) Because the government told them to (jobs, spending, demand, etc etc etc)  So then, I know this is off topic so I'll shut up and get to the point. In the quest to provide all this newly required housing, Rushcliffe has deemed two large areas of greenfield/greenbelt land as targetable for building lovely new homes on. Nice big housing estates for the Young Tanned Salesmen and Emotionally Robust Credit Control Accounts Executives to rub shoulders with Nouveau-Celebs and other Good Consumers. 70 more houses in Wilford, and 1200 houses in Edwalton. Now, given that in most families today there are two car drivers, work out how many cars that will put on those already congested roads. I bank on around 2000.   Yes, that is another 2000 cars on roads already more congested than a heroin user's arsehole. Just think of those hot petrol-breathing summer days clagged up on the virtual car parks that are the roads of south Nottingham.

      I find it really really really annoying.  If you drive to shop at the Coop in East Leake you have three options: 1) The huge car park at the back that has plenty of space, is free, and has wide parking spaces for mums with sprogs, has trolley stations, and is about 60 yeards from the supermarket entrance. 2) 4 Disabled parking spaces on the road that runs beside the supermarket to the car park. 3) On the small bit of road that has a zebra crossing, is double yellow and forms a junction with the village high street.  Lets talk about those who use number three. Always male. Usually with someone kicking an amplified bass drum in the boot (or equivalent). Usually just popping in for fags or alcohol. Sometimes they use hazards.   How many offenses is that? Errr. 1 for parking on a junction, 1 for parking on double yellows, 1 for leaving the engine running unattended, 1 for inappropriate hazards, and prolly 1 for obscuring the crossing. That's enough for a driving ban isn't it?  But what really makes me angry is that it becomes impossible to see if traffic is coming down the high street when you are trying to get out of the car park, because the view is blocked. They should be stabbed or made to run out into the high street blindfolded.  Disability spaces. OK I have used them too - early in the morning when I've had my 3-year-old in the booster seat and I want the cashpoint. To save me probably 5 minutes. I note however that some people use them all the time. Often the same people who use position 3 too. I thought it was bad form because people with real disabilities would have to go round to the main car park. But then I realised that in a certain sense most of these people are lazy and crippled intellectually which makes them far more needy than most disabled people. I've only ever seen one car parked there with its disabled parking card on display. And I make a point of looking.  Please people, do not park on the corner, because it is stupid, dangerous, and illegal, nomatter how thick, selfish and idle you are.

      As a special weekend treat I thought I would share this story with you.  Half way between East Leake and Gotham there is a roundabout, for the road used by lorries carrying "gypsum" from the powerstation at Radcliffe on Soar to the gypsum mine in East Leake. Coals to Newcastle? Indeed - gypsum is made in power stations now and gypsum mines make plasterboard out of it. Anyway, I digress....  One day, when I was driving along the road, not particularly slowly (probably regulation speed limit + 10% + 3 = 69mph), someone decided to use the roundabout to overtake me by going around it the opposite direction. It has central reservations on the approaches too so it was quite a risky move.  It was really quite impressive. It also showed me a thing or two about being a fat Miserable Old Git, rather than a youthful and dashing twatface.

      Simon just pointed  urlLink this neat product  out - ideal for fighting back against the stupid fog light dazzlers, or the rear-view blinders. I've often wished for a little device I could switch on to reflect peoples' light pollution back in their faces.  It's war out there, isn't it? It's pretty much true that most blokes want to kill most other blokes most of the time. Mainly strangers: you see them, you want to kill them. This is played out in its raw state in Snottingham on a Friday and Saturday night (who am I kidding? every night) with the random punchings and stabbings of innocent bystanders at bus stops in the square.  But in the tiny febrile minds of the pinhead baseball cap hooded top crew, foglights, used aggressively, are real-life space cannons, and they are killing, or hoping to kill, oncoming motorists, either by laser fire, or just causing them to swerve blindly into a ditch at speed.

      I used to drive to work along Coventry Lane. I don't any more, partly because of the frequency of queue avoidance by super-important Red Van Men. At one point, the single-carriageway splits into 3 lanes at a traffic light. Two are for straight on, the second being for aggressive BMW drivers to overtake slightly slower motorists. The third right hand lane is to turn right into Aspley, land of the smashed bus shelter.  But there is also a left hand turn, into Strelley Village, which is a no-through road. Enterprising red van men have realised that, if there is a queue to turn right into Aspley, they can simply turn left into Strelly, pull a U-turn, and then wait for the light to change so they can go straight on into Strelley, thus poisoning the poor saps waiting in the queue at the traffic light with extreme amounts of stress-induced stomach acid and bile.  Still, as long as they get to work 2 minutes before everyone else, that's alrighert, isn't it?

      And on the subject of being too special to have to queue with common mortals, something that really annoys me is something I see every day on the way home from work.  Now I don't think this is necessarily illegal or anything. It is just antisocial.  On the bit where the A453 turns off the ring road towards Clifton, there is a flyover. Underneath is a roundabout from Wilford Lane and with a slip road from the Northbound carriageway of the ring road. There is also a slip road joining the A453. Clifton is a single lane bottleneck where you essentially have a dual carriageway and two other main roads merging into a single lane. You always get a traffic jam.  So there is a fair amount of courtesy required to keep things sweet and moving.  I'm always on the A453 and I always make sure I let people in coming up the slip road from the roundabout: the principle of "do unto others" being applied.  What really narks me though is those drivers who can't wait in turn and go racing up on the inside of the slip road (on the hard shoulder) and then force their way in at the top. Basically they wave a large virtual "fuck you" at everyone being reasonable on the main road and on the slip road.   What are they trying to say? "You are too stoopid to do this but I am clever"? Don't they understand that they are doing the motoring equivalent of eating someone's vomit; something very very vulgar indeed.  I dread the day when one of them does it to me and I am in a bad mood. I SHALL end up getting sent down for nerfing.

      Last night on the way home, something was wrong.  At one point I travel down a two-lane road. The right-hand lane is for people who are going to turn right and head for the motorway. The left hand lane is for people who are going straight on.  I don't know if the motorway was clogged or something - you know; accident caused by intense sunshine or random braking, but the right hand lane on the road I just mentioned was at a standstill.  Someone in that queue had a brainwave. Rather than sitting in the queue like everyone else he decided to pull into the left hand lane, drive to the front of the queue and try to get back in.  Understandably nobody would let him push back in. Now I understand that we all have errors of judgement with lanes. That's why I usually let people switch lanes if I can help it. But this was a clear cut "fuck off! I'm not waiting, because I'm more special than all the rest of you fuckwits" manouvre.  Anyway the net result was that he blocked the the left hand lane.   I joined in with the three cars in front of me, making sure he could feel the heat of disapproval. In the end he edged into lane purgatory. I told him what I thought of him as I went by. What a canon-ball-headed glowing-with-the-rage-of-conceit-and-self-importance solipsistic twat.

      I want one of those new 4x4s that has an autopilot button.  Now you all know that I don't actually know much about cars from a technical perspective, such as makes, models, engines, or mechanisms. But what I saw today was amazing.  I followed behind a 4x4 for some distance. It travelled at a constant 45mph - through villages, on the main A-road, thru road junctions, turns, past parked cars and pedestrians. Constant as granite.   And it never used any signals at all. None. Nomatter what.  Pauses to think.....  For someone to display such an utter lack of any sort of response to the changing environment in which they are driving, it can only happen, surely, if they are on complete autopilot.  It is as though they are a passenger in their own vehicle, only the steering to deal with, somewhere in the lower levels of the subconscious.  Maybe that's what happens with some "hit and runs" - like snow-blind to the road, bump, still blind, huh? did something happen then? ..... nah..... returns to daydream.

      Yeah yeah yeah.  It was a blue Rover, W415SMJ. I didn't really notice it until it overtook me at the Raleigh Island. I'd slowed to give an articulated lorry space to get round the roundabout, but this guy decided to use the inside lane (which is for right turners) to overtake me and then cut me up to get back into the correct lane.  Nice skills, you may think. Well, yeah, but he'd had to go so fast to get by in time that he was going too fast to stop at the lights just after the roundabout. Pedestrian lights. Which were at red. So he almost scored a kill. I stopped to allow the pedestrian to cross, so I might reasonably have expected not to see Gordon the Rover again.  False. I caught up with him a mere 200 yards on, at the Beechdale lights. He was in the "I am too important and fast to queue like everyone else" lane which is intended for right turners and overspill. I queued with the rest. When the lights changed he ripped away leaving us all standing. And he cut across all three lanes. Nice.  Except that I caught up with him again about a mile on. At some traffic lights. He was in the right hand lane. He zoomed away and cut up 2 lanes of traffic. I turned off after that.

      simon got me thinking about this.  1. pedestrian crossings are a privilege, not a right. hardly anyone uses them properly, and therefore this privilege should be removed.  2. i tend not to press the button unless the road is exceptionally busy. however, it is quite common for me, on leaving the scene of a pressed button, to receive abuse/dirty looks from halteed drivers when someone else has pressed the button.  3. anyone who uses a pedestrian crossing "properly" looks stupid/old.  4. if we're going to keep them, they should also have a cancel button.  5. tests have shown that repeatedly pressing the button DOES hasten the arrival of the green man.

      A permanent flag, on a pole, should be planted at the crossroads near our building. To commemorate all the truly skilful and thoughtful driving that goes on there.  In a moment of what can only be called wondrous serendipity, not only was the red van man not signaling his intention to turn right, but the taxi driver turning right towards me was steering one-handed whilst talking on his (handheld) mobile and, it looked like, reading the Sun on his passenger seat at the same time.  In my bitter experience, red vans are more likely to cut you up than white vans - though tell that to the white van man who overtook me (I was doing 30 mph, god forbid) in a built up area yesterday eve, and then overtook the guy in front of me (who was daring to do 40 mph, by now, it being a 40 mph speed limit), only to immediately slam on his brakes in order to take a right turn.

      One of the things that really annoys me is pedestrians who press the button at a crossing when there are no cars approaching and then cross anyway.  The result is that the lights turn to red after they have gone when I am approaching the lights. So I have to stop for nothing. If it pisses me, I dread to think what it must do to our Good Friends in the world of HGV who would have to make 112 gear changes for No Reason.  Often it doesn't matter, because the cycle of the lights is hard-coded for complex junctions, but some sets of lights are placed FOR pedestrians and they do respond to a button press.  I thought it could only be thoughtlessness and stupidity that would make someone do it.   And then I did it at the crossing between the Royal Concert Hall and Cornerhouse in the city centre. It was an autopilot thing.  And so I award myself a flag of red and white to wear on my head when I am a pedestrian. Also, I am not quite as quick anymore to wind the window down and shout at somebody 100 yards away, "YOU STUPID STUPID FUCKING SELFISH MORONIC IDIOTIC..." You get the idea.

      It is almost certain that I drove like a cünt this morning. I blame the heat, and the fact that I blinded myself trying to take photos of the transit of Venus, and the fact that CJ's teacher didn't open the door at ten to nine as she is supposed to, and nor even by nine o clock, when I had to leave, and the fact that there were people on the A610 roundabout who anticipated the lights, then had to slam the brakes on, then didn't notice that the lights had now changed. I'm afraid I had to blow my horn aggressively at somebody and then overtake them and drive away from them at speed.

      On the way home last night, once again, I tried to memorise all the incidents that happened to me of the terrible driving variety and once again I lost count. Strange that this morning I can only remember one of them: a car with three baseball players that pulled out on me on the ringroad in an itchy sort of way.  Well, anyway, the thought occurs to me that on every journey that we make by car, all of us, we get our goodness flipped in some way by twats several times, but we forget about it. Odd that isn't it. Maybe it is because we are concentrating on driving and that causes our short term memory to filter out these events from longer term storage. Just think of the ultraviolence that would build up otherwise.  This morning's post goes to the boys in East Leake village last night who, at around midnight, were using the Gotham Road as a race track. There were five cars, using both sides of the road to race each other. They were using both sides of the roundabout indiscriminately too, which is worrying because one of the exits (from Lantern Lane) is blind. Just imagine the mess a head on at full speed would cause.  I tried to get the registrations to call the police to report it, but hey! they were probably stolen cars being driven by drugged-up young criminals from somewhere or other. They probably have some sort of injunction on them in connection with a criminal record that makes them exempt from prosecution.  Then they were gone. Like Mary Poppins. Probably to shit on the karma of another village.  They use the car park next to the grocers to demo their stupid exhaust pipes and sell their wares in the shade of blue LEDs. And I'm half convinced that there is some sort of drug-related prostitution shit going down in the public toilets across the road.  I know they've been over before because they crashed twice last time (into the wall at the Chinese takeaway). They are there to play high speed chicken with blind junctions. Now I would be happy for them to die, but I worry because they will take several innocents with them and that isn't fair.  May the gods love them, and may they consequently die young in a ball of flame and mangled aluminium. Prithee no humans involved though. Please baby Jesus, make them die before they kill someone.

      I've just remembered something that happened last night after reading the last posting.  The scene is Hilton Crescent in Edwalton. There is a one way circular road to get to the car park. As I approached the road, there was a silver mini cab behind me. I indicated and entered the road.  I arrived at the parking position of my choice only to find said mini-cab already there and parked across two parking spaces.   He had taken the opportunity to overtake me audaciously and get to the car park "more faster" by going in through the exit and driving the wrong way down the one way bit.   Once he arrived at the parking spaces though, which are angled from the road, he found at that he was facing in the wrong direction to park squarely in the spaces, so he didn't bother trying. He just parked crazily across two spaces. Nice and convenient.  However, I ought to point out that you can only drive the wrong way up a one-way-street if you REVERSE! Fool!

      Wildlife enthuthiasts will be interested to know that the psycho truck drivers can often be found on their way into Snottingham from the M1 Junction 26, along the A610. Snottingham is, of course, the natural habitat of the psychopath.  I love the A610, because for a couple of stretches, it's dual carriageway national speed limit, and then it's suddenly dual carriageway 30 mph. And people tend to think it's a 40 mph road, if anything.  And they have those speed cameras that calculate your average speed between two points. Now, I don't know this, but if I was in charge, they would work between point A and point B - several times. That is, your speed is always calculated between a pair of cameras. And you'll note, if you care to look, that there is always a pair between each set of lights. I believe that this is specifically to fool those motorists who assume that if they  average  30 mph along the whole 30 mph section, then that's alrighert. So they assume, oh, well, I stopped at the lights there, so I can drive like a maniac along this bit - out of my way, puny pedestrian!  Anyway, for the record: point A is always far enough from the lights for you to have accelerated to the speed limit safely. And point B is at about the point you would be slowing down for the next light.  Anyway, truck drivers. Often there is a truck full of scrap metal that leaves the motorway at 26 and drives into town. The pile of scrap always looks precarious, wobbling around all over the place as he drives his truck as if it was a two seater sports car. People like this, I either want to be a long way behind them, or in front of them, so that when a car door drops off the back, it's not onto me. But this particular driver, and I assume it is always the same one, hates to be overtaken. And he always seeks to punish you for overtaking him, by intimidating you, either by means of the tailgate, or by means of the "I'm going round the roundabout at the same time and speed that you are, even though I am no longer strictly in control of my vehicle."  This morning, it was a wide, flat, extra long, vehicle, one with a warning triangle indicating that its rear wheels would move across the carriageway as it steered. Naturally, once I was right behind it, I felt it would be safer to be in front of it. So at one set of lights, I accelerated past it, but being aware of the speed cameras, I didn't disappear into the distance but moderated my speed to 30 mph, in time for the Point A and Point B stretch.  Thus trucker must have been enraged, and tailgated me up the hill, then pulled out into the second lane to overtake, though there was nowhere for him to go. Noticing a central reservation approaching, I shifted position in lane so he had no room to squeeze past. Eventually he dropped back behind me, and I slowed down to 0, so he would have to use all 26 gears to get going again.  This is life in Snottingham. People are basically trying to kill you - or make you feel as if they are going to kill you - every morning on your drive to work. And stand too long at a bus stop on Saturday night, and you will be randomly punched or stabbed - because it is the local sport, the random attack on an innocent party in a queue for the bus.  Someone tailgated me on the way into the Sainsbury's car park yesterday, close enough that he wouldn't have been able to react in time to my brakes. Now, I ask you: what is between the ears of someone who, essentially, wants to drive as fast as he possibly can in a busy car park?

      Only two things this weekend - the funniest of which was a big silver 4x4 on Abbey Road in West Bridgford, yesterday evening (Sunday), that overtook parked cars on her side forcing me to stop to give way when it should have been the other way round. I had right of way.  Probably if she was driving her usual Nissan Micra Broomstick we could both have got through the gap, and it was a temporary lapse of concentration on her part: she forgot which car she was driving, and the law, as well as all common courtesy.  This morning though, everything was back to normal. I decided, lest you should think that I make this up, to name and shame a few people by mentioning their car registrations. By the time I was 15 minutes into my journey I already had 6 in memory and it became muddled up.   The first one I had this morning (P666MVF) pulled out on me in Gotham village (nothing behind me) forcing me to slow to 5mph, and then parked 70 feet on down the same road outside the newsagent, blocking my side of the road and forcing me to stop for a gap in the oncoming traffic before I could get by. A classic "itch" manouvre. 10 out of 10 for pointlessness and annoyance with that one.  I also had two tailgaters, and a lovely overtake-on-the-inside on the ringroad where the A453 joins it. I was doing 60 (it's 40 mph speed limit though) and a nice big silver car came racing right up behind me and slipped into the inside lane before ripping by and indicating up back into my lane. Very smooth.  Lastly, "thanks" to the water-sports-yellow Merc 190 who tailgated me after Raleigh Island too. Good skills.

      Damn, I'd stopped but Dog's comment about buses has started me up again.  Two things.  The first. I too have days, often when it is sunny, where I like to control other motorists with my politeness. I go out of my way to apply the golden rule of ethics to treat others how I would like to be treated. I slow down for twats, make room for people who have blundered in their lane selection, allow people to pull out or cross my side of the road. I've even stopped to let people through a narrow gap when I have right of way. I have this kind of feeling that some sort of chaos principle will kick in and infuse the world with goodness, fairness, and kindness. But by about 10.30 am the blackness has got me again.  The second. I live one village away from a bus depot. This means that the time can have a significant effect on the way bus drivers drive. I know that they have one of the most stressful and low paid jobs that there is, so largely I'm sympathetic. I couldn't do it - I would murder rude kids and stupid people who don't make sure they have their money first etc., BUT, one of their tricks is "not getting to the depot before my shift ends". I assume that if they get to the depot and their shift has ended they go home, otherwise they start another run, which might end in them working for another hour and a half. The roads are bendy and long, with many blind spots due to corners and dips, and I am afraid to say that I commit the sin of impatience when I have to drive more than three miles at less than 30 mph on a 60 mph road.  Once I got so angry, that after I overtook (eventually, after about 4 miles) I gave him the sign of the cloven raised legs and hooted my horn. He responded by putting his headlights on main beam, thus blinding me. It nearly escalated but I realised what I was doing.

      This is going to be my last post today.  Has anyone else noticed that other drivers speed up when they are closer to home? I wonder if this has anything to do with that statistic about most road traffic accidents ocurring near to the home (and no, I'm not getting confused with the "most accidents occur in the home" thing).   Certainly my only accident of note was near home. Although, I hasten to add, I was driving ultra-carefully, as usual, and it was a fault with the steering lock, but that's by-the-by and another story altogether.   It often happens that when people are tailgating me on slower roads they are about to turn off into a side road.   Check it out. You can almost place bets on it. As a result I drive purposely slower as I approach home. Just to annoy them all.

      Rob posted a comment earlier regarding a further use of hazards to warn other motorists that one of your indicators is broken. Worth reading.  But that reminded me of a related issue that I often notice.   After I passed my driving test I laboured for quite some time under the misapprehension that it was fashionable to have your lights disconnected. I assumed that vehicle owners would pay a garage somewhere to disconnect their indicators and brake lights. Afterall, typically you would see no red or yellow lights (and usually no white ones either), but it stood to reason because there would often be a display of blue LEDs that would make an Egyptian desert sky at night look dull.  It was only when someone pulled out of a side street and hit me, smashing one of my indicators, that I realised that someone's lights might be out of action for reasons other than foppery.  Broken lights (any of them) are worthy of a flag award, but also an offence. You can be stopped and charged by the police for it.  And it is an offence to have fog lights ON when visibility is greater than 100 meters. Unless you want to use them as photon guns for blowing slow cars out of your way, like many younger drivers do.

      Sometimes people act very foolishly when trying to obtain a red and white flag. Listen to the story of this irresponsible fool I saw recently.  You will be aware that the life expectancy of someone who leaves their vehicle on a motorway or dual carriageway is 29 minutes.  I saw a car recently, pulled up on one of the four lanes of the 70 mph section of Clifton Bridge where the A52 and A453 merge. It appears that the car had broken down, because the driver was actually under the car with his toolbag. During rush hour.   He hadn't bothered to use his hazard warning lights either. Not that doing so is likely to save him.  This is just a single example of what can happen when an unskilled driver attempts to acheive flag status.  He might have been one of the 60% of drivers under the age of 25, who drive under the influence of drugs, according to police statistics.

      You will all be aware that it is an offence under the Road Traffic Act to use hazard warning lights UNLESS one of two things applies: a) you have broken down or suffered some other sort of serious emergency and you need to warn other road users so they can avoid you; b) on a MOTORWAY you may use your hazards while moving to alert other drivers of a hazard up ahead.  Some drivers thoughtfully and usefully extend the law in the following way: a) I am double parked. b) I am parked where I am not allowed to park. c) "thank you!" d) "Er, actually I need to stop here to buy a newspaper, even though I am blocking the road."  I just wanted to make these motorists aware that putting the hazards on under those circumstances actually constitutes an ADDITIONAL motoring offence to the one you're already committing. I.e. it doesn't excuse you, it makes what you've done even more wrong. Why do it therefore? The only possible reason is stupidity. I will be issuing future flags of red and white for this.  Thanks also to the van driver in Bobbers Mill that blocked a blind bend on a narrow road. The driver and his mates, who were ostensibly gardners, had used their hazards to alert other road users to the fact that they were laying emergency turf in front of some flats.

      Of course, acts deserving the award of the good flag didn't begin when this blog was started. They have been going on since Homo Vehiclus first stumbled out of his dreary cave into the light of day and rolled a Round Thing along the highway.  As such I thought it only right to give mention to these brave pathfinders in the  driving techniques which we experience today, they have gone before now, but these brave men and women deserve special mention, and thus honerary awards....  I award a flag to the brave driver of a blue car on the Ring Road under the Derby Road underpass. He helpfully used his horn to remind me that we had passed the speed cameras section and that it was therefore safe to speed up to say 60 whereas I was only doing 45 (40 mph speed limit on the section where they only use portable speed cameras). Awarded for "I am urgent" services.  I award a flag to the driver who overtook me on the 30mph section of Gotham Road in Clifton. He carefully used an oncoming slip road to get by me. He left me eating his dust. Indeed he would have received an honerary double flag but for the fact that his performance was flawed by his getting stuck behind the bus in front for the other 4 miles of our shared journey. He should have thought about that first. Awarded for "I am urgent" and "itchy" services.  I award a flag to the driver of the silver mercedes on North Gate, who overtook me and the three cars in front at the road junction. He almost caused a collision with the two cars at the front of the queue who were turning right. Services for "I am urgent".  I award a flag to the driver of the silver people carrier for pulling out on me on the three lane roundabout at Dunkirk on the junction of the ring road and the A6005. Fantastic example of "itchy" because he hadn't looked to see whether the roundabout was clear ahead of him. It wasn't, so he had to stop, blocking my lane on the roundabout. Lovely example of "itchy". "Here's your flag, sir. Fly it proudly!"  Many, many more go unremembered. A group flag to all of them. They are the "unknown soldier" of shite drivers. As virgil said, "a great man has the entire world as his epitaph." May the road network of Britain serve as a reminder of all of the acts of stupidity that precede those on this blog.

      I am always full of admiration for those people who can drive while conducting their urgent business on the dog and bone. They are truly the surfers of fortune.  I salute the blue van driver this morning who swerved out of North Gate, across the filter lane on Radford Road, in front of me. It was almost a perfect manouevre. "Almost" because it didn't actually cause a collision with me....  "However, as a self-appointed driving expert for the BBC, I would venture to suggest that you will only acheive a 100% perfect head-on collision if you put your mobile phone down and concentrate harder while you drive."  "If you'd had two hands on the wheel you probably wouldn't have missed me. Here's your flag. Try harder next time, and maybe you'll get a coveted double flag."

      I am looking forward to being able to issue awards for "itchy" - those drivers who can't see more than 30 yards down the road, or at least their attention doesn't go beyond that.  You notice them particularly when you approach a road junction. Typically, you'll be on a fast moving A-road, nothing in front of you and nothing behind. And you'll see the road to the left of you, and as the "scratcher" gets you vaguely in his field of vision he will suddenly pull out in front of you, forcing you to slow down to say 20 mph.  There are degrees of itchyness and variations on the theme.  A common form is the "it's alrighert, because I have better acceleration than a Saturn V rocket" itch. They pull out in front of you, forcing you to slow right down. By then they have floored the gas pedal in 2nd gear and are half a mile up the road, while you slowly try to build up speed again in your normal car.  The highest form of itch though is the "I want to turn right across oncoming traffic next" itch. They pull out on you, again, nothing is behind you. It's a very busy A road, say rush-hour, and in the paradigmatic form of the move, you will be going the other way to most other people. So now you've slowed down they indicate right to go across heavyoncoming traffic, and because it's moving steadily there ain't no way that anyone is going to stop to let them turn. So you switch off the engine, put up a tent, start a fire and make some tea.   The common man may take these driving moves as a display of a lack of foresight and consideration on the part of the performer. Not so. It takes a huge amount of skill and judgement to make that sort of move with finesse.

      It is a Well Known Fact that truck drivers are psychopathic. They have a cab full of porn and eat nothing but lard and breathe nothing but carbon dioxide, so of course they are.  If you can't see my mirrors, I can't see you! Because I never look in my mirrors anyway! I'm known as Mad Dog to my friends.  There didn't use to be all these artics in the old days. When I was a lad, I remember being excited to see the Long Vehicle sign, because you didn't see it that often. Now, I only get excited by Vehiculo Longo, because it sounds nicer in Italian.  It wouldn't be so bad if they learned how to drive the thing before venturing out onto the road, but they "learn" to drive when they are empty. The first time they have a cargo of convenience foods and Chinese cockle pickers, it is a shock to their systems.     Fact: most motorway holdups are caused by overturned or jack-knifed lorries and shed loads.    Fact: all trucks drive too fast: especially in traffic jams, because they are paranoid about people nipping in front of them    Fact: all truck drivers are watching DVDs while they drive, and they all have two mobile phones (one for the wife, one for the mistress)    Fact: if they didn't drive quite so fucking fast, they wouldn't get so het up about fuel prices    Fact: they don't need to overtake each other, but they do. The one in the inside lane is doing 60 mph; the one overtaking it is doing 60.0000000009 mph, a speed only achieved by running in the slipstream of the one in front until he was 2 inches away ("If you can't see my brake lights, I will stop suddenly!"). You can spoil a trucker's day by overtaking him, then pulling in front and slowing down to 59 mph until he has to change down a few gears. I wouldn't suggest doing this, of course, because it would be Wrong.

      And welcome to the roadrage blog. In this environment, we will record all the crazy, dangerous, dumb, and anti-social incidents that clog our roads and our lives. Remember: social = moral. We live in a car culture, spend a lot of time in our cars, and the way we behave in them matters -- probably more than we think.

      Thanks to the guy behind me for sounding his horn at me on the junction with the ring road in Nottingham, where the tram depot is. It seems I wasn't fast enough for him...  "There was a car coming from the right and my clutch is starting to go, so if I'd pulled out he would certainly have hit me. You would have been delayed even longer."   "I enjoyed your childish display of agression though, where you overtook me, pulled back in, in front, and then stopped. I was REALLY shitting it, you know. Luckily you remembered that you had a deal to attend and drove off."  "Next time I'll remember to take that risk for you. Here's your flag, you fucker."

      I don't normally complain about motorbikes. They don't normally bother me, apart from their laser-like headlights (and that is hardly the rider's fault), and those times&nbsp;when they take a corner and lean into my side of the road like they are trying to headbutt my bonnet.   But today one  did  annoy me.   I was approaching a roundabout in a 30mph zone. I wanted to turn right.&nbsp;&nbsp;But then, about 100 feet before the roundabout, a motorcyclist decided to overtake me. I hadn't started to indicate, admittedly, as I was going slow, but overtaking  that  close to a roundabout (pulls Dame Edna Everage face)?   It's just not my sea, man. I had to slow right down to let him get out of the way. He went straight on, and flew off at about 70mph. Down the road where two children have been run-over in the last four months.   Have you ever seen a motorbike collide with a pedestrian? Quite a common sight in London. Very entertaining.

      A word of warning. There are many holidays in the offing which means that posts here will be few and far between for the next couple of weeks.  There's been a lot of horse shit spouted recently about the 1960s decade being to blame for all the troubles in the world today. My initial thought was, "how on earth can a decade of liberation and free questioning, where the attitudes were on the whole very moral, be to blame for our current crime-riddled and selfish society?&nbsp;Surely the eighties must be to blame."   Why am I talking about this now? What does it have to do with road rage and driving? Well I think that the way people drive is just another facet of their attitudes and set of values. So, plugging in values into our variables, you might say that politicians are&nbsp;claiming that people drive like twats now because of the slack morality and rule-breakers of the 1960s.   Is this valid? It doesn't seem to make sense.   I was talking to my wife. She works in the hospital. She treats lots of people who are caught up in the drugs/prostitution/hepatitis/organ-failure/death trip. She tells me that most of the women are young (20s), from respectable&nbsp;stable families, former students, bad drug habit, and they get involved in prostitution to pay for their drugs.   I was on the bus this morning, overhearing conversations. I heard a woman bemoaning that fact that her husband had "pissed off with his mates for the week". He'd told her that if he had to choose between his mates and her-&-the-kids, his mates would always win. Her husband is 45 years old, works full time, but on a Friday night, and saturday night, he will have three or four lines of coke, delivered to their home, for personal use. At £40 -£45 a line. To a middle-aged working-class woman then,&nbsp;it isn't that strange to&nbsp;have a husband who blows £240 a week on coke.   So you see, in real world Engerlundland, most ordinary people are stuffing themselves full of&nbsp;Snow as fast as they can get hold of it.   The whole thing of over-confidence and bullshit, and selfishness&nbsp;& aggression, and celebrity-self-importance, and not-giving-a-shit-about-others,&nbsp;very much makes sense, doesn't it? I mean, these are ordinary people who work 5 days a week. It makes sense that they drive like bastards under the circumstances.   So, recreational drug use&nbsp;is commonplace and accepted. Everyone is "doing it". It's the modern man's "trip to the pub with workmates to blow the week's wages".   That got me to thinking that it was perhaps in the 60s that it became acceptable to use drugs openly for recreation. Fashionable even. Or that drugs became commonly available to the likes of you and me. So maybe the politicians are right, albeit for the wrong reasons. Perhaps the 60s does have something to do with people driving like they deserve to be put out of their misery, like limping dogs.   PS. I promise no more overt politics in future.

      This morning I was out on the road much earlier than is usual. It was very quiet. There were no incidents.   I drove through Clifton and noted that someone's car had been vandalised and about 70% covered in gold spray paint and graffiti. Nice surprise for them when they get up! Certainly wasn't in that state last night as I drove home.   And I thought that I'd got away with an eventless journey.   But it was not so.   In Gotham a bus had stopped on the other side of the road at a stop. As I approached I could see another car approaching from the other direction (behind the bus). Now we all know that the human and correct thing would have been for the other car to stop, as I had right of way. But it didn't have to stop. It just kept on going. I had to pull up hard. And the "lady" driver didn't even thank me. She was too important with self-love. Fuck bitch! My virgin journey was despoiled.  And just as if to show that there is no such thing as a quiet journey, on the straight road between Gotham and East Leake there was an Argos lorry parked up next to a field with its hazards all akimbo and flashing. I saw it from some distance. I also saw a car approaching it from behind. And I thought, "I bet that car won't stop". Because I've learnt by now that people don't give way when their side of the road is blocked any more - they just go for it, like good Modern Americans; like an illegal chicken game or something. So I got ready to brake and pull over onto the verge to avoid a head-on.  But guess what! What actually happened was completely unanticipated: the lorry flicked his hazards off and pulled out with no signals, cutting up the car approaching from behind. Then it came straight on to my side of the road, still no signalling, and pulled up and flicked his hazards on again. Thus my side of the road (an A road) was unexpectedly blocked forcing me to pull up hard and wait until the other side of the road was clear.&nbsp;Licensed to kill!&nbsp;  I do love your human world! And it's crazy dangerous sense of its own mortal importance.

      I ought to point out that "post-manufacturing" below means "after people stop&nbsp;manufacturing things", rather than "making components of fences and gates or things to put lamps on".  Just in case that wasn't already clear.

      I just read Rob's post below. Completely true and very well put.   First the rediculous: I think that rather than putting&nbsp;6 gears in a car, which seems to be the new fashion,&nbsp;they should drop them all back down to&nbsp;4 gears like in the olden days. I know from my weekend with only&nbsp;4 gears what a damper it puts on going fast. Maybe they should only allow 5 gears on cars for the over 40s. Or simply no 6 gears at all except on lorries and tractors.   5 or 6 gears&nbsp;creates an illusion of going slow, and the fact that the engine is turning slower means that driving is cheaper (fuel consumption)&nbsp;which encourages more use of cars. And&nbsp;of course&nbsp;it is harder to stop in an emergency than it would be in a lower gear because of the lower engine torque. That's three Bad Things about higher gears.   Six gears, my arse: it's just a fucking gearbox "celebrity&nbsp;makeover" for the nouveau under-stimulated&nbsp;imagination-deprived&nbsp;ones of today. How long until they invent a car that goes all the way up to 11? I bet if they dropped all cars down to 4 gears there would be a huge reduction in the number of accidents.   Now the sublime. I was thinking to myself last night about all of this. To be fair I was suffering withdrawal symptoms&nbsp; too, as I've stopped drinking, eating cheese, and started avoiding other unneccessary luxuries, like being cheerful, but I really do despair for young people. What is going to happen to them?   They are polluted and diseased by our society and the media in any case, but it really is no wonder that they drive like utter, utter, utter cunts so often. Their "reality" is that they are fixed rigidly at the centre of their own little solipsistic immortal celebrity video-driving-game universe, where damage-resistance is set to infinity, and everyone else on the road is simulated road fodder. It's a game.   I was reading that in the 80s economists celebrated Britain as having the first "post-manufacturing" economy. It was seen as evidence of cultural evolution. I have another word for "post-manufacturing": it is&nbsp;"useless".&nbsp;Britain is all tied up in mediocre nothingness: hairstyles, perfume, celebrity, one-chord pop, fastness, drugs, emotional stress over nothing, careers in mobile phones and credit control. There is no  real  value now. No thought either. People have 4 months off work because they have split up with a boyfriend or girlfriend, no kids or house though; just a failed relationship. How pathetic is that? As members of society we are feeble and selfish.   The number of people employed in services has trebled since the early 80s, but is the level of service in this country three times better than it was then? Or is it worse? Make your own mind up.   Put another way, we have a surfeit of Service provision: call centres, helplines, salespeople, consultants, credit controllers, web site providers, television, and the like. Normally demand controls supply, but the output of the services industry is actually useless, so the rule here is actually reversed. Supply has to dictate demand.   This, in turn,&nbsp;has spawned off an entirely new dependant industry, generating a demand for the excess supply of services we have: advertising, spin doctors,&nbsp;viral marketeers, and mobile phone providers. That means there is an entire elite culture of people generating demand for something that is useless.   And when you realise that anyone can supply useless products, and anyone can sniff coke while thinking of new ways to con stupid people into wanting ringtones and eMoticons and neon lights under cars, you get to realise that the poor of the third world are poised on the brink of inheriting the world. Good for them: they have waited in the wings for long enough. But this country and its inhabitants are doomed to failure and bankrupcy. This is the New White Man's Burden.   I suspect that the whole Extreme Wanker Driving Phenomenon is down to our post-manufacturing economy. It's like some people can talk about "nothing" for ages: fashion designers can make a livelihood out of nothing of any real use:&nbsp;some countries can therefore "do" nothing for ages: self perpetuating, feeding on its own waste.   Perhaps there will be a collective realisation that actually we are all chasing&nbsp;shadows for nothing. But probably not. We all have a vested interest in keeping up the appearance that we are more important and useful than we really are. And once the connection with reality is broken, the scope for deluding ourselves that we are celebrities, around whom the whole of space and time revolves, is limitless. That's why the roads will just get worse.

      Some geezer texted 5Live this morning with the news that, if road tolls cost as much as %A31.20 per mile, he would have about %A372 left of his annual take home pay. Which puts things in perspective.    urlLink Transport,  it seems to me, is the Great Debate of our age, in the same way that the state od the sewers was of such concern to the Victorians. In the 19th century, the effluent of overcrowded cities threatened to wipe us out with the diseases of poverty spreading to affect even the rich.  But now we're fully car-cultured up. To not have some kind of car, in the early 21st Century, is to be in the same position of a Victorian pauper without even an outdoor privy. And as more and more of us crowd onto the roads in order to flaunt our conspicuous consumption, it becomes more and more of a huge social and moral issue.  And this problem needs to be solved, in all its myriad facets, for our society to evolve onto a higher level. We need the motoring equivalent of indoor plumbing, and we need it fast. Whether it's BMW-style driver aggression, or Corsa-Boy twattishness, whether it's 4x4-style inappropriate technology, or speeding, or congestion, we need to, collectively, step back and see what we're doing to ourselves.  Until motorists stop reacting aggressively, dismissively, and defensively to every suggestion, we'll get nowhere. What will it take to make people, like that BMW driver who nearly poleaxed me at the school crossing yesterday, sit up and pay attention?

      This posting has a few tasty snacks rather than being a three course.   Once again, there have been so many incidents and examples of bad driving that I can't remember all of them.   Incidentally, going back to indicating at roundabouts, I had a funny one this morning as I approached a roundabout. I stopped,&nbsp;though the first car coming round was indicating left, and quite correctly it turned off. Best to stop anyway these days.&nbsp; Sure enough the next car round wasn't indicating at all, but turned off. Last car was indicating right, but turned off to the left. So I stopped for no reason. But I wasn't bitter: it was nice to see all possible permutations of indicating in a line like that. Just goes to show that indicating is at least pointless.   A small zen-like thought: where do all the boy racers go in daylight? Are they vampires? No, they drive white vans labelled as "builders", "decorators", or "van hire". Today on the ring road I got overtaken by six of them in a convoy. I was doing 65. They must've been close to 80. Either they were racing to work, or it was amphetamine residues still in their bloodstream. They live on a higher driving plane than the rest of us mere mortals.   Last night on the way home, I drove through Gotham. There are always plenty of parked cars in the street, kids playing, horses sometimes, and all those sort of things. As a result I am a stickler for 30mph. Same yeserday, except that wasn't good enough for one of the drivers who was tailgating me. He actually overtook me on a bendy road in&nbsp;the village. I estimate he was going 45 mph. Boy racer? No; the middle-age equivalent - a salesman. Superb skills. Of course I caught up with him again once we were outside the village because he was stuck behind a British Gypsum lorry.   And this morning on Wilford lane a woman overtook me. You'll remember that the speed limit is 30mph along there and that road is a "hot spot" for mobile speed cameras? I was doing a frankly&nbsp;indiscreet 35mph. She'd been tailgating. She flew by me at the traffic lights. 45mph again? Of course, once more the traffic ahead of us was heavy and slow so I caught up with her. I took great joy in driving close up to her as a reminder that she had overtaken so aggressively. H563OPY she be. Possibly on her way to an emergency celebrity hair makeover on Meadow Lane.   They used to say that women drivers were "slow", or, more accurately, "careful". But how often have you had a 4-headlight Tailgate Twat buzzing you in his little car with a wing on the back, swerving around road humps, first gear a-thrashing, only to see, instead of the usual baseball cap and acne, a girl in her early twenties behind the wheel. What's all that about then? What's going on? Are drugs and fast food causing hormonal imbalance as well as obesity?   And best last: on the slip road from the Silverdale roundabout onto the A453 at Clifton, westbound. Traffic queue on main road and the slip road. Everybody acting patient and courteous except for one driver who decided to overtake because he was too special to wait&nbsp;his turn with everyone else. Did he drive up the hard shoulder on the slip road in the usual manner? Notatallatory. He sped up the slip road with his right-hand pair of wheels on the hard shoulder, and his left pair of wheels on the pavement. Yes, he overtook everyone else by driving fast up the pavement! How cool is that? It must've been someone very important behind the wheel, like a celebrity gangsta hair-makeoverist from one of Nottingham's fantastic lifestyle salon/bookshops. T458SUT he be.

      A bruising encounter this morning with an unbelievably stupid and arrogant BMW driver, whose behaviour was so far out of order it simply boggles the mind. I was a pedestrian, having just dropped CJ off at school, and I was walking back to my car, which was, sensibly, parked in the pub car park about 5 minutes walk from the school.  So I step out of the school gates and there are still a lot of kids/parents on their way in, and the lollypop lady has just stepped out into the road to let a bunch of them across. A green Suzuki has stopped for the crossing lady, leaving plenty of space for people to get across with pushchairs etc.  But the BMW driver behind her, thought... actually it's impossible to tell what he was thinking, or if he was capable of thought at all, because he decided to  overtake  the Green Suzuki, having decided, presumably, that it was "parked", in spite of the fact that it was in the middle of the carriageway and that there was a lollypop lady helping dozens of children and parents across the road a few yards in front.  Jay-zus. I shouted, as he nearly drove into me, "Where are you going?!" He had his window down (a more arrogant pose, I expect, ripe for the elbow he likes to show the world). He shouted back, "She's pulled over!" and drove off towards the lollypop crossing. With the green Suzuki, stunned, following in his wake.  There are no words. Ignorant, stupid, arrogant, dangerous, aggressive, solipsistic, dumb cunt. Oh what joy it would be to see an angry mob of parents lay into you and rip your face off your thick skull in order to pound your tiny brain into smithereens.  BMW drivers: they're all the fucking same. Shit off, you bastards, and start your own planet where you can all be bastard shitbird cunts together.

      I had to drive in the dark last night for the first time since summer (sic)&nbsp;began.  &nbsp;  It's amazing how many people only have one headlight working. So many in fact that I would suspect, in spite of it being an offense&nbsp;not to have working lights, that the police turn a blind eye. I thought it was easy to check headlights but apparently not so. &nbsp; I once had one of my headlights out for a week: someone collided with me, smashing&nbsp;a headlamp and indicator. I was crapping myself&nbsp;for fear of getting pulled up for being illegal, but it didn't happen.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Why do some cars seem to have their headlights on  all  the time?&nbsp;Some people just need to see their own shadow on the road and they'll switch their lights on, I know, but some cars seem to have their lights permanently on. Why? What a waste of energy and fuel. I bet it is a road-safety thing, because lots of people are too lazy to put their lights on when they  should &nbsp;so car manufacturers have had to build in a failsafe to circumvent their laziness and stupidity. &nbsp;  New headlights - those stupid multi-coloured lenses! Arrgh! It's like having your senses nuked with a fucking psychedelic super nova.  &nbsp;  And I'd forgotten how annoying tailgaters are in the dark. Especially 4x4 drivers. My wife thought I'd been abducted by aliens or something because the back of my neck was lobster pink with radiation burns.  &nbsp;  And what is it with some cars whose headlights are so bright that they seem to be on main beam permanently? Is this a new thing too? Saves the car driver the inconvenience of having to fuck around switching main beam on and off? It's like they have a fucking gamma-ray burst going on under the bonnet.  &nbsp;  And while I'm on the subject of cars with stars on thars, I would just like to say that driving behind someone with&nbsp;their main beam on is, frankly,&nbsp;shite. Just because I'm not facing them doesn't mean I enjoy those photon beams blasting around my car off my mirrors. Or that it is otherwise OK for them not to bother dimming down.  &nbsp;  And... those on-coming&nbsp;fuckers who keep main beam on until they are about 40 feet away from you! It's too late by then, for chrissakes!  &nbsp;  And... &nbsp;finally; those without stars... &nbsp;  There was a girl cycling along last night on the fast road between Clifton and Gotham in the dark, with no bike lights. Good work! I was lucky I saw her, silhoutted&nbsp;in the distance against someone's headlights. Otherwise I might well have sent her spinning into a field because I was pretty dazzled by someone tailgating already.  &nbsp;  Unbelievably I also saw a boy on a moped on the road between East Leake and Gotham with no lights at all in pitch darkness. I was vaguely aware of a sort of black shape looming in the distance, and at first I thought it was a horse's arse. In a metaphorical way I suppose it was. The rider was sort-of hunched over his handlebars. I can just imagine that he knew he was being a twat and was trying to cut his wind resistance down&nbsp;to help, albeit&nbsp;feebly, to&nbsp;get to his destination faster. &nbsp;&nbsp; And... (sorry&nbsp;- force of habit) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

      I had to drive over to Beeston this lunch time to do some shopping. &nbsp; I had to take a right turn on the big roundabout at Dunkirk. It's a three-laner. The slip road down from the ring road is two lanes - left for left and straight on at the roundabout, and right for right or straight on. &nbsp; I got simultaneously overtaken and cut up by someone in the left lane, who wanted to, err, actually turn right. He overtook me and screeched round the roundabout before cutting me up. &nbsp; Now you might think that it was a simple error on his part - we've all found ourselves, too late, in the wrong lane. But there was nobody behind me in my lane, so there was nothing to stop him just dropping into the correct lane.  &nbsp; And we all surely know that when there are two lanes approaching a roundabout and you're turning right, you go in the right-hand lane? Unless told otherwise by road signs? &nbsp; So that means that it was intentional. A calculated premeditated overtaking scam. Involving very bad driving, dangerous speeds, and plain rudeness. &nbsp; Probably a student on amphetamines. The car was certainly a hunk of shit.

      I see lots of them in Clifton; teenagers on scooters.  They appear from nowhere and scoot flamboyantly along the main road before disappearing just as mysteriously down a driveway or up someone's back passage. A bit like fireball meteors on a cloudless summer night. Or sparrows passing through the light of the meadhall in winter.  The one I saw yesterday was in jeans-and-a-T-shirt. He might have been wearing a helmet, but probably not. He thrust himself out of the petrol station, cutting across oncoming traffic, out in front of a double decker bus.  Once in front of the bus he started to "wheelie" up the road. He did that, with only one short interruption, for almost a mile. I was praying to the Muses for him to fall off and slip unceremoniously underneath the bus, but no such luck.  Other Clifton scooters I've spotted have done similar circus stunts: particularly common is the overtake-by-driving-on-the-wrong-side-of-the-road-for-several-hundred-yards manouvre - where they go round the wrong side of roundabouts and reservations and the like.  It's also usual to see them overtake you and then pull sharply across in front of you into a left turn such as a road or a garden.  My journey through Clifton last night was quite an interesting one, in all. Apart from the scooter boy, I also had two tailgaters, myriad non-signallers, and someone who pulled out on me.   The jewel in the crown was the Old Magoo Twat in a tank-like 4x4 who pulled straight out of the shopper's car park on Southchurch Drive/Farnborough Road, without looking. He caused an emergency stop on his side of the road, and then he swerved right out onto my side of the road, forcing me to stop, before carrying on in lofty oblivion.

      I have been trying to avoid this subject for a long time. It's one that really annoys me; indicators at roundabouts.  There are three schools of indicating thought:  a) signal everything - I'm one of these people. Sometimes I forget, but on the whole I always signal - note that on most roundabouts this means at least one application of my indicators. Quite often it requires two applications of indicators.  b) signal sometimes - "if my hand is near the indicator switch, if I'm not on my mobile, and if I feel like it, I will indicate".  c) "NO! Piss off, homosezual law-abiders!"  Is it just me, or does it piss everyone off when you stop because a single vehicle is entering a roundabout from the road on your right, except they turn off on the road you are on. So there was no need for you to stop.  So you stopped, wasted petrol accelerating away again, employed all those pedal and gear movements, AND caused the traffic flow to stall,  just because someone couldn't be arsed enough to move their hand 4 inches to the indicator (their wrist is strained from excessive wanking perhaps?)  This happened to me today in Clifton. I gave the offending minicab driver a wide smile and a  big thumbs up to show my appreciation, and unfortunately he almost crashed as he looked at me in confusion. I say "unfortunately" because he didn't actually crash. Damned shame.  And just as annoying as "no indicators" are the ones who indicate wrongly. I suspect some of this comes about due to confusion about the different rules on indicating that we have for normal roundabouts and mini-roundabouts.  Plenty of people approach a roundabout, and lets say they want to leave on a road that is at their three o'clock position, so, correctly, they indicate right. Except their good work goes right out the window because they never indicate down (left) to say that they are turning off. They turn left while still indicating right. So once more, you get poor fuckers believing their bogus indications and stopping unneccessarily.  Or even worse, you get people who pull out thinking that somebody is turning off and err... they're not.  We need some sort of hard line rationalisation here. Either we should indicate or we shouldn't because the current "yenoyeanooyeanoyes" approach is dangerous.

      Huge apologies to the driver of the blue Ford Escort, signalling left to pull into the left hand lane on the A610 because he happened to have encountered a bit of a queue in the "fast" lane. What I don't understand, if you were planing to turn left onto the Ring Road, as you did, why were you in the wrong lane? Unless you perhaps thought you were in some kind of a  race?  But surely not, because that would be stupid.  Anyway, just in case you thought that driving to work in the morning was a race, and that stupid risks were worth taking because there was a huge  prize  waiting for you if you arrived two minutes early - guess what? I won.

      Blimey! I got my car back with clutch, gears and starter motor all now working at no extra charge. It doesn't seem possible.  I just had to slap myself across the face to make sure I hadn't turned into a junkie student, a crazed dream-timer, or Fearne Cotton.  This sort of thing isn't meant to happen. Surely the Bitch Troll of Ill Fortune is hiding underneath Clifton Bridge, sniggering, waiting for me to cross it like the Billy Goat Gruff.

      The postman whose round covers our estate has a big shiney red van.  The glowing Post Office Red paintwork is indeed fortuitous.  For, let me tell you now, this Postie insists on parking his van in the most obstructive places he can find.  Usually it doesn't bother me because I understand that he is probably just a student doing postman-ing for drug money or something, and therefore he will still have an element of devil-may-care rebellion in his personality. Or proud selfishness. Or just a really arsey 'tude like the till girls at the Coop. Or the thought that England owes him a living. Something like that: you know, the first flush of Celebrity.  But what really annoys me is when he parks his van on the corner at the end of our road as he did again this morning.  When he does this he is breaking the law for starters. But his van is huge and it makes it impossible to see whether there are any cars approaching from the left.  So when he parks on the junction he also makes a point of leaving about 8 foot of his van sticking out into the road, so I have to move over to the right hand side of the road at the junction to get onto the main road, which, given that he has made the junction blind to me, is really fucking dangerous.   Let me emphasise this: I have to move into oncoming traffic on a blind junction to get by the van.  Why does he park there when there are many safer and legal places within 30 feet?   Do you think he is one of those people who just shits their pants to save themselves having to go to the toilet, and just chucks their pants away every couple of days? Like a down-and-out junkie or something who steals pants off washing lines.   Hey Salesman's Wives of the 'hood! If your knickers keep disappearing from the washing line, check out the postman! He's probably got a mud-stained pair of your pink frillies under his hi-vi uniform right now.  Now it makes me think: if his driving behaviour is as slack as a Brighton cottager's ring-piece on a Saturday morning, with how much respect must he handle our post?  Jesus, I wish I were a traffic warden or the God of Justice.

      The roads have been very quiet last two days - eerily so. It's as if the blissful 6-week summer hol had started early. I guess there is a percentage of kids not going to school because the exams are over. Not complaining at all.  Special thanks to the 4x4 driver who thoughtfully only blocked half a lane on the A610 this morning, so he could pull over and take/make a mobile phone call. While you weren't breaking the law by using your phone whilst driving, you were, in fact, breaking the law by parking on a double yellow and on the pavement  at the same time  - quite an achievement.

      Zoned out again on Saturday - is this a worrying trend? This time, I set off for Tesco and "woke up" when my wife asked why we were going to Sainsbury's. This could be a subconscious longing for the warmth of Sainsbury's bosom as opposed to the cold hard greed of Tesco Heiress Dame Shirley Porter of "homes for votes" fame... or it could be that I'm having trouble concentrating. Could it be a brain tumour?

      I collected my car from the garage on the way home from work on Friday. You'll remember that the clutch finally gave up on me on the motorway.   Let's talk about the Good Thing first. The clutch is fixed and boy what a fix! I can go up hill in any gear, and even accelerate in 3rd and 4th. I can move into gaps again, rather than having to wait until the road is clear. And the car does what I want it to do, rather than reacting in its own time!  Now lets get back to the Black Things in life.  I was driving home on the ringroad all flush with the pleasure of clutching and tried to get into 5th gear. No way; I now have no 5th gear. Obviously something to do with the alignment of the gear box. Ever seen how a gearstick connects to the gearbox? It's like a series of shafts and pulleys that would make a victorian engineer proud.  Secondly, the starter motor has become "intermittant". Instead of turning the engine, I get a sound like a brontosaurus being mauled by an allosaur; a sort of terror stricken screeching "ruuuurrrrlllllllllllghgghghghglllllleeerrraaaaarrrgh". This wouldn't be much of a problem if the dinosaur sound was less frequent than the engine starting. Sadly that is not the case. I spent 20 minutes yesterday in the car park at Lings Bar Safeway Superstore, to the consternation of the great unwashed, making alarming dinosaur noises with my car.  So, you see, in getting the clutch repaired I've taken one step forward but taken two steps backwards. This is the Great British way of making progress though, so I'm not too worried just yet.  The funniest thing concerns my wife driving the car. Now the clutch is fixed we have a "bite point" again, and the car is thus once more stallable.   My wife pulled out onto the three lane roundabout at Dunkirk Flyover on Saturday morning and stalled, blocking all three lanes. Remember the starter motor problem? Yes indeedy! She sat there for 2 minutes trying to start the car while blocking three lanes on a busy roundabout. That's what I call pleasure. Wonder if any students were driving pissed up on drugs and thought that they were in a Jurassic Park acid trip.  Lastly, a big "thank you" to the lady in Clifton this morning at the shops who was double parked, stationary, and indicating left (presumably because she was parked), who, in spite of my indicating that I was going by her, decided to pull out on me while continuing to indicate left, forcing me to do an emergency stop. Did she even know that I was there? I think not. Fabulous display of solipsism.

      Rather scarily I experienced an actual zone-out this morning, managing to drive through two sets of lights across two busy junctions without any awareness. One minute I was on the A610 waiting for the lights at the junction with the ring road, and the next thing I knew I was on Wilkinson Street, driving up to where the road was flooded across the tramlines.*  Which is odd. Because I not only must have pulled away onto the ring road from the 610 when the lights turned green, but then must have gone through a green light on the right filter lane to turn into Wilkinson Street - except this is normally extremely red for a couple of minutes - because of the way the phasing of the lights works. So either I sat there for two minutes and then turned onto Wilkinson Street, which I don't remember doing, or I went through a red light, which I didn't notice, or the light was green, which means the traffic light system was out of phase.  Anyway, when I "woke up" on Wilkinson Street, it really did feel as if I'd been asleep at the wheel.  *I just love the fact that they took  three years  to build the new Snottingham tram system, and that every time we get a bit of heavy rain, the road floods over the tracks on Wilko Street.  So. Going back to what we were talking about yesterday, I thought I'd posted a comment to Si's "Starsky and Hutch" piece, but apparently I was dreaming.  My favourite example of righteous police trunctions flailing down upon the guilty happened a few years ago, on a country road in France. You should know about me that I do fully one third of my miles on French roads, so a lot of stuff happens to me there.  It was a winding country road with a solid white line down the middle, indicating No Overtaking. More to the point, no crossing the white line. There was a tractor, holding up a queue of cars for a few kilometres. Say around 30 cars, and we were about 10th in the queue. The tractor came to a village, where it began to execute a complex 3-point turn in order to reverse into a yard which was right next to the village sign. So, those of us that can see this are just sitting there waiting, anticipating the joy of release when we can drive off again without a tractor in front of us.  Then, from towards the back of the queue, a BMW comes roaring up, taking advtantage of the fact that the tractor is now also holding up oncoming traffic. So he's committing an offense, crossing the white line, and he's being a cunt, too, performing an anti-social (i.e. immoral) manoevre, by jumping the queue, leaving everybody helpless with frustrated rage in his wake. Or so he thinks.  Because the car he pulls in front of at the head of the queue, a car which has left a BMW-sized gap between it and the car at the very front of the queue, happens to be a police car. O joy, o bliss. So the copper, or gendarme, makes the BMW pull completely off the road in order to administer the punishments.  By this time, the tractor has completed its reverse, and we all begin to pull away. Everyone blows their horns in greeting at the BMW as they go by. It was better than sex.

      I've just remembered that I had an incident where I came across a despicable selfish cunt last week.  I was in the car park at the University Arts Centre, waiting for a free space. Someone was getting into their car ready to go. Just as that car started to move, though, a cunt who looked like a computer salesman came flying into the car park, blocking me from getting into the space I'd been waiting for.  And then he took the space.  Leaving me waiting there.   And when he got out of his car he graced me with a look of businesslike contempt.  It was probably bravado on his part when he realised that he'd stolen the space I was waiting for, but I was ready to ram his car into the grass bank. In the World of Right surely I would have crumpled his Piece of Flash Shit into scrap, and stared back at him with even greater contempt.  Or maybe he thought he had done something really clever that made him better than me. I decided to let him get on with his petty greedy hand-to-mouth orange-skinned con-artist salesman's existance. I saw the reality; that he was a rude bore, an ignorant bastard and selfish sub-ape.

      Hey! "Star, sky and hutch". Is that a comment on the human condition? Some sort of allusion to the enormity and infinity of the cosmos (the sky full of stars) as opposed to the cramped rabbit-hutch like human-world?  That was totally irrelevant because all I wanted to say was that I totally understand that thing about more police cars. Rob's comment is a considered one, but mine is purely emotional.  I wish that all people would drive as though the car in front or behind was a police car.  I get a warm feeling when I'm going along at the speed limit, aware of a police car up ahead, and some twat tailgates me, roars past, and you see his brake lights when he realises that he's been sussed.  Have you noticed how cowardly most of these people are? Like they speed about in their fast cars as though they think they are at Santa Pod, all aggressive and antisocial and full of themselves, but as soon as they see a patrol car; brakes on, and 5mph BELOW the speed limit. Chicken blood!  I sometimes wish I were Police when people drive like cunts; a sort of Blue-flashing Avenger for the good folk of the road: someone tailgates me - I drop my window and put my blue lights up on the roof, "just pull over sonny", and then I deliver a sound thrashing about the head and face with my righteous rubber truncheon.   Er... does that sound a bit gay?

      Road tax was brought in as a "temporary" tax on road usage to provide funding for the upkeep of roads wasn't it? Are they saying that isn't enough anymore so we need toll roads? Why don't they just put that up some more? Or they could tax on mileage. Or petrol consumption. Or both.   I don't know what I think about road tolls: I feel as though they are bad, but that's gut feeling rather than a reasoned response. I don't like the idea of restricting an existing freedom only to those who can pay for it: all that does is removes the freedom from those who can't pay - a tax on the poor. Like saying "rich people and businesses are important: you are not", which is, of course, actually true. I suppose that if the toll is low it is reasonable.  There used to be a toll bridge over the river Trent between Wilford and the Meadows in Nottingham. If I tell you that The Meadows was a notorious poor area with back to back terraced housing whereas Wilford was a suburban middle-class village you can understand that the toll was a very effective means of keeping the snivelling and undesirable working class kids out of Wilford.  They should put governors on cars to restrict them to national speed limit, like on lorries. If only to please me because it would spoil the fun for people with cars that go fast.  Rob's comment on shopping via the motorway is very relevant for other reasons: hypermarkets are also a bad thing: they are probably responsible for much of the decay in health of the population - long distance commoditisation, preservatives, pollution from transport, cheap mass-produced food, non-local foods, homogenised crap products. These are all Bad Things, contributing to the decline of this country. There should be a tax on shopping outside a certain radius of home and work and on non-local produce. This isn't taxing the poor because it is good for them; and the rich lard-arses will spend their money on their own increasing weakness and extinction.  My other worry is probably also related to what Rob says below about local journeys - that you end up with a road system where you can't go very far without incurring some sort of toll, or where the roads become essentially a privatised concern. If they have tolls they should make sure that the network of Class A roads and all the rest are up to scratch.   Still, it worked up until the 17th century. It is an effective barrier against movement of people. Actually that would be good for reducing crime too. So perhaps my instinctive distaste for toll roads is just wrong.  There is probably a very deeply political element to it all though, because I think the funding for road maintenance comes from different bodies. I used to work for the Planning and Transportation Department of the County Council and they used to have a really cock-eyed way of doing things, like where policy, funding, and implementation were all undertaken by different eschelons of government - you know what I mean - national government would commission and approve the work, county councils would fund it, and borough councils would actually do the work. It's probably even more complicated now with all the private concerns involved.  I also think the minimum age for driving should be 25. And they should have a curfew that prevents people under 30 from driving more than 5 miles on non-business matters.  Fucking blanket ban phones and computers and TVs in cars too: on the spot equipment confiscation and points on the license for it. No questions asked: no right to reply. If you use your phone while driving you are a dangerous idiot. And that includes hands free - thinking what to say without being able to see the person you're talking to is far more distracting and therefore dangerous than driving with one hand.  There is a right fucking twat in our village. He's got a car (usual set of 3 pairs of headlights, fucking cunt spoiler on the back, dual exhaust, and Las Vegas modelled in LEDs all over, the front of the car is orange, the back is silver and the interface between colours is flame patterned), and let me tell you he drives like a TOTAL CUNT. My only consolation is that one day he WILL have a crash and that one day he WILL get caught by the Police with their just and righteous truncheons aloft as nature intended. That thought puts a smile on my face, and makes me grit my teeth at the same time. Nemesis.  They should make everyone drive the same kind of car: something like a plain black VW beetle. Now that's socialism in action! Right on and P.C.  (that last paragraph may have an element of irony by the way)

      I often fantasise that they put a lot more patrol cars on the motorway. Forget the silent menace of speed cameras to raise revenue, but actually just intimidate motorists into driving more slowly.  Patrol cars should just pootle up and down between junctions at just below the speed limit, encouraging motorists to slow down to just-70, and all that. With fewer junctions, you could do this. Police patrol cars could get on at J27, pootle down to J24, doddle round the junction, and back up to 27 again. Rinse and repeat around the country.  Drudge work for the police, but fuck 'em. They'll get a better pension than me.

      So. The Weasel government, suddenly realising an election is in the offing and that some motorists might actually vote, are   urlLink proposing an extension to the M6 toll motorway .  I'm not 100% against toll roads, but we're all aware by now that building new roads doesn't reduce congestion. In fact, figures show that there are now considerably more cars using the M6 and the M6 toll combined than there were previously on the M6 alone. Big surprise.  Older readers already know where I'm coming from. As far as I'm concerned, speeding motorists cause congestion. Middle lane huggers cause congestion, too, in the main because speeding motorists are queuing up in the outside lane to get past them. If people simply slowed down to the actual speed limit, there would be fewer queues, less of the concertina effect of stop-start traffic, and fewer accidents causing queues.  But one particular thing that causes congestion is local traffic using what shouuld be long-distance roads.  I'm guilty of this myself, and I know whereof I speak. In France, sure, the motorways are mostly toll roads, and they are considerably less busy than British motorways. But it's not just that. Because of the economics of toll collection, there are also fewer motorway junctions, so there is less traffic using the motorway for local journeys.  Each morning, I get on the M1 at junction 25, travel exactly one junction, and leave at J26. In the evening the reverse. I don't need to do this, and there are two or three different routes home, along normal local and A roads, that I could use instead. But I've found the motorway route to be a bit quicker, and although it's further, the higher average gear/speed means it's probably more economical.  But... and here's the thing: Junction 25 doesn't need to be there. It's not a good route into Snottingham, and you could get into Derby from an earlier junction. The consequence of closing Junction 25 would be to remove all the local traffic using the 25-26 "short-long" cut, but it would also considerably lighten the load along the A52 into Snottingham/Derby, making it a viable route into town for those of us who have been forced to find alternatives.  And there are any number of other junctions that could be treated the same, I'm sure. I know it seems like a crazy, drug-fueled, radical solution, but it's simply applied chaos theory. Remove a few junctions (thus "contracting" the motorway system by making it less useful to local traffic) and slow the fuck down, and you could have a congestion-free life.  Think about the M25. What is it for? It's there to route motorway traffic around, rather than through, central London. So why are there so many fucking junctions on it? It's become local shopper's paradise: a ringroad surrounded by retail parks and industrial estates, clogged with locals out to run up more credit card debts. So, I say, close all the junctions that aren't on actual motorways relieve the retail constipation, and see the traffic on the M25 flow. I say this with some bitterness, because the absolute  worst   M25 traffic jams I've encountered have been on Sundays and Bank Holidays at around shop closing time.

      Yesterday something Most Dreadful happened. I was driving down to Coventry when I experienced a mechanical failure in the car, on the motorway.  The car seemed OK for quite a way along the A roads, but it is my own fault - I've been aware of a creeping clutch problem with the car for some time, but it has been fine so long as I don't give the engine any hammer.  I joined the M1 at Loughborough, accelerating nicely down the slip road. Unfortunately at the bottom of the southbound slip road is a hill. About 10 miles long. It being a motorway, you don't normally notice hills.   But, let me tell you, the car started to get slower and slower until it bottomed out at about 45 mph. 45mph on a motorway is very very very very scarey proposition. At one point I thought the engine was not engaging at all. I tried all of 3rd, 4th, and 5th gears. 3rd was just silly at that speed: I sounded like a hairdrier (remember those?) - 4th gear was maxing out and any increase in gas just caused thrashing of the engine with no acceleration. 5th gear wouldn't even engage. In other words, I needed to be in 5th but the torque caused by the hill was preventing the gear from engaging.  It was fearful, my people. I was in two minds whether to pull up onto the hard shoulder, but the car was at least still moving and I know, statistically, that once you get on the hard shoulder your life expectancy is down to something like 30 minutes. Which makes the hard shoulder about as dangerous as the Somme in 1917. So I kept on going, like a train in the night.  I managed to limp to the next exit and get back home via the byways of Leicestershire.  Funnily, the car seemed OK once we got off the motorway.  Gotta call a garage to get it repaired today. Open that cheque-book and bend over, boy!  So, the moral is, next time I get stuck behind a fucking moron plodding along at a steady 45mph on a clear straight fast road, I will think "maybe his clutch has just gone" rather than just nerfing him straight away.

      No incidents this morning. Still, an hour and a half with my thoughts each way gives me plenty to unburden.  What used to be 10 junctions 15 to 25 is now supplemented with 15a, 23a, 24a, possibly others that I haven't noticed. 15a to 26 has three distinct phases. Up to Junctions 18/19 it is horrible, busy, clogged with trucks. I agree with dog's comment below: all the government policies, matrix signs, and punitive taxes in the world won't change the simple fact that the biggest problem on the roads is the trucks. There are too many of them and they drive like maniacs, far too close to the vehicle in front (which only encourages other motorists to maintain gaps that are less than truck-sized), and they pull out with no or almost no warning.  Driving with a lot of trucks on the road is running a gauntlet, taking your life in your hands, and there's no hiding from them, because you're either trapped in the outside lane with inadequate space between cars, or you're surrounded, intimidated by truckers, who act like they don't see you, like you're not there. And god help you when it's raining, because there are just as many of them, driving just as fast and just as close to each other, only now they're throwing up more spray than you thought possible.  So this morning, for the 2nd time, I drove from the A43 up the A5 to Junction 18. Much more pelasant, with more or less the same average speed, and hardly any traffic. This may be something of a lottery, but I'll try it a few more times.  Then from 18/19, which are the ironically named Rail Freight terminal and the M6 respectively, there are fewer trucks, and the road is beautifully clear (which makes people drive too fast, natch) - but only until you get to 21, M69/Leicester, where the cars just  hose  onto the road, two lanes full, madly trying to swerve into the outside lane as soon as possible in case one of their friends sees them in an inside lane of some description.  So from there to Snottingham you're in local-traffic commuter heaven, because it's only a 20 minute drive from J21 to J26. It's about this time that I start to play with peoples' heads, because you can see their does-not-compute brains trying to deal with the fact that the Big Gold Passat that just overtook them (say) is now sitting in the inside lane, where no self-respecting motorist ever goes. Inside lane? Then-I-Must-Overtake-For-Lo-It-Is-Written. They must overtake because that's what they  live  for, to overtake the slow cars and lorries in the inside lane. So I see them creeping up their speed, trying to catch the car that just overtook them, and I wait until they get closer, then, usually, it's time for me to pull out and overtake yet another middle-lane hugger, unless I choose to undertake, just for laughs.  But do any of these drivers realise, I wonder, that the train journey from Leicester to Nottingham is ridiculously short? 10 minutes, something like that. How much nicer their lives would be. 10 minute train ride to Snottingham, walk to work, or take the tram.

      I often hear those words on the radio and think to myself, how scary would it be to be right behind the lorry when it sheds its load? Now I'm commuting 160 miles per day, I guess I'm going to see my share of incidents. Still a surprise to see one on what was only my 3rd day.  I saw, no more than a km ahead, what looked like sheets of cardboard or paper suddenly dumped onto the inside lane and hard shoulder. Turbulence and wind started them flying around madly, spreading across the remaining two lanes. Luckily it wasn't too busy, so I smoothly moved to the outside lane in order to give them the widest berth. Only when I am almost on top of them and about to go over what I had thought was no more than cardboard did I realise that it was squares of aluminium!  I narrowly avoided them, and looking back in my rear view saw the chaos that was about to ensue. Passing a Golf that had gone through the aluminium ahead of me, there was one wrapped around its front end, so I'm lucky to have avoided something like that.  =+=+  As a footnote to yesterday's  urlLink spray report , last night, under clear blue skies and on dry roads, the matrix signs were still saying, SPRAY - SLOW DOWN. Which is exactly why they were such a stupid idea, waste of money, and why nobody will pay them a blind bit of notice. You just know that the functionary who thought them up is the kind of person who puts up signs round the office... YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE MAD TO WORK HERE... PLEASE LEAVE KITCHEN TIDY... PLEASE DO NOT WIPE BOGEYS ON THE WALL... If not signs, then lots and lots of internal emails in capital letters full of advice and requests.  This deluded person clearly thought that putting up signs saying SPRAY - SLOW DOWN and DON'T DRIVE TIRED would moderate driver behaviour. But like the old YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE MAD etc joke, it wears thin with repetition, and its daily presence is just like any other billboard or notice, there to be ignored. Request to hackers: please break into the system and make one read, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE MAD TO WORK HERE, and the next one, BUT IT HELPS...!  Further south, suddenly, the message END appeared on one of the signs. End of what? End of the joke about non-existent spray? End of noble matrix sign experiment? End of Leicestershire? It didn't say.

      Hired a van this weekend - a Luton with a tail-lift. Much fun. It's so great to sit up so high, and easy to drive. Only 60 mph, no air conditioning (hottest weekend of the year), but with the radio blaring and the windows wide open, it was happiness on wheels.  This is why people go for those 4x4s isn't it? For the feeling of being up in the sky looking down on people. When I got back into my own car this morning, it felt like someone had let all the air out of the tyres.

      You see people at motorway service stations, especially in France, with that bombed-out road-trip look*, the glazed face, the pasty, flaccid skin, wearing crumpled leisure clothes you'd otherwise hope they'd only wear behind closed doors (and curtains). They've been living in their car too long. Their car is just piled with junk, they're tired, they've been driving all night. They started the night before, and now it's 7 a.m. and they've only just got North of Dijon, and they've got 4-500 miles still to drive.  And you see people sleeping in their cars, stretched out on front and back seats, surrounded by detritus, sock-clad foot squashed against the glass of the side window, face squished into the cool bag. And you see them inside trying to get the coffee machine to accept their remaining Euro coins, the ones Italian shop keepers refuse to accept. And the machine is spitting out the coins again and again, and they have creases on the sides of their faces, sand in their eyes, stubbled chins, grey skin.  And that's when you realise how dangerous it is out there on the road. Not just the speed you're doing, not just the crazy speeds the Beligians are doing as they flash by on their way to the queue at the turnpike, not just the "crasy" Dutch with their "crasy" wobbling caravans, but the fact that they are dead, dog-tired, bombed-out, barely alive, asleep at the wheel, one headlight. You're surrounded by these people, operating machinery, travelling at  urlLink 140 kph+ , reaction times slowed to a grandfather clock tick and a tock.  I once did the all-night drive to the South of France, and swore: never again. The stupidest, dumbest thing you can possibly do, the horrible risk, to get yourself killed going on holiday. No journey is worth it. I'll start early in the morning, I'll drive all day, I'll swap places with my wife, I'll stop and rest, shut my eyes on Le Shuttle, drink plenty of water, but I won't drive all night. Doesn't stop other people doing it though, and doesn't stop the motorway being a very dangerous place.  If people on UK roads are already drunk, coked up, high-stress aggressives, the hoiday season all-night drive just about makes the motorway (adopts Clarkson drawl)... the most dangerous place on Earth.  *Thanks to Mr Neil for the expression!

      I watched the television last night and saw, on the news, a man being dragged away by a mob in a far away land, no doubt to be clubbed to death, or have a petrol-soaked tyre lit around his kneck, because he didn't agree with the seething majority.  This morning for the fifth time I saw the same red car parked on double-yellows right outside the entrance to the nursery obscuring the view of children running out into the road as well as making passing a very tricky manouvre.  See, that's the difference between us and them. Life is cheap abroad - you can die for as little as your thoughts, whereas here our time is so important to us we are even prepared to sacrifice our children to save thirty seconds.  But exactly why is it trendy now to have purple windows in cars?

      Today I travelled to work at a slightly different time from usual. Different times mean different road conditions and therefore different idiots on the road. Today I met with 3 people who I would rank as "fucking idiots".  First the driver who overtook the car in front of him on immediately turning left at a T-junction, forcing me to stop because he was on my side of the road. What a stupid dense fucking zombie. "Durr! Cars  do  go slow when they are starting to move because of "inertia". Twat brain! Go back to school."  After dropping my daughter off at her friend's this morning I also had to stop because of another car driving on the wrong side of the road. Some stupid lazy twat was turning a wide sweeping bend on the estate and decided that they were Important enough to drive on the wrong side of the road to shave a quarter of a second off their time on the corner. I stopped to avoid a head on. The  lady  driver didn't even acknowledge me. "STUPID MINDLESS NOUVEAU UGLY BITCH - piss off back to your kitchen and  Ideal Homes  magazine."  I was driving down the straight road between East Leake and Gotham. A white van cock-licker had already pulled out on me forcing me to brake from 55mph down to 25mph when there was nothing behind me. After that he thrashed off at about 70mph down the 40mph stretch where the houses are until he got stuck behind a car and large lorry. We all rounded the bend on the hill, and at that point he decided to overtake the car and lorry in one move... in spite of the fact that there was a cyclist coming the other way and it was utterly obvious that there wasn't anywhere near enough room for the bike, him and the lorry all in the same bit of road. Still, physical space is no barrier to someone who is Important. He went for it. And at some point it must have become clear even to him that he was going to have a head-on with the cyclist, because he applied his brakes and forced his way in behind the lorry. What a pox-weeping cock-face!  Finally, I would like to issue the salutation, "piss up your cunt!" to the following Important People who overtook me at least twice on the ring road in their frantic lane-switching attempts to get in front of everyone else: the spikey haired acne-boy in the torquoise-and-rust-coloured Fiesta; the baseball capped bloke in the anonymous white estate-type van, and the blonde-haired sales-prostitute in the black Corsa with her mobile disco.  Good work, inferior people!

      Today I had some white van fun. Not the monolithic white vans with the back windows painted over so you can't see the road ahead when one is in front of you; nor the kind that are driven by 17 year old drug-addled boys with volcanic pizza faces, who're employed by builders to get their team of Irish and Chinese "unemployed" to a building site as fast as possible; but the smaller sort of white van so beloved of self-employed electricians and burglars.  It happened when I was driving through Clifton. I was 'trolling along at a steady 25-30mph because of the speed ramps. I saw him creeping up on me like a pike behind a minnow. Once we hit the 40 mph two-lanes section of the A453 he overtook me on the inside: I was only doing 60, you see.  Once he overtook me I noticed that he was pumping clouds of blue-white fumes out of his exhaust. It was making the road quite foggy. And it stank. Good riddance, eh!  Some time later, on the 70mph section of the ring road, I caught up with him again. In fact, he was trapped in the "slower" lane and I was indiscreet enough to overtake him effortlessly. Not that I take great joy in that sort of thing. Only so much as is natural, you understand.  Well, shortly after that he was tailgating me again. So I pulled into a gap in the "slower" lane to let him get by and out of my way.  His final manouvre was to overtake me, and without any signals, push in just in front of me before crossing straight into the slip lane for Dunkirk roundabout on my left in a puff of dragon smoke.  It makes you wonder, doesn't it? Can it be that most people are only thinking, say, 5 seconds ahead when they are driving?

      I've been thinking of getting some cue-cards made, so I could hold them up at people in order to pass messages. I want one that says, "Cruise Control" on it, so people I overtake who then overtake me only for me to have to overtake them again will understand that it is they who are fluctuating wildly, whereas I am doing a steady, constant speed.  I want another that says, "Inferiority Complex?" only in French, "Complexe d'inferiority?", for all the pointy little boys in their little white cars who feel obliged to pursue the Big Gold Passat with the GB magnet when it overtakes them, even though they can't keep the speed up on long climbs so I have to overtake them again... and again. Maybe I'm doing them a disservice though, maybe the GB magnet is just extremely powerful.  And one that says, "BMW = ARSE".  And one that says, "SEE YOU IN THE QUEUE ON THE SLIP ROAD," only written backwards, so they can view it in their rear view mirrors... except they probably don't use it.

      it seems no matter what side of the driver/other people interface i am on, i still receive grief.  i have been a crosser of roads myself, and i've been a bit of a fly guy, i admit, but never as nasty as the people i am tempted to run down these days. mostly teenagers, they don't bother looking, in fact they make a point of not looking, walking as slow as they can as they cross, daring me to spear them and carry them up the road on my bonnet. but i don't, of course. i slow down, or adjust my direction slightly. one day, i won't. and it will be great.  after all, aren't we all just trying to get somewhere?

      Picking up on Simon's moan below about people who speed through villages, the fuck-you from the town mouse to the county mouse, this is something that bugs me every time we visit my wife's parents in France. They live in a village, along what I was reliably informed was a road to nowhere. In other words, there's no reason for any through traffic, other than the odd meandering tourist - everyone else is a local.  Now, in the 10 years I have been visiting, the village has grown somewhat. Quite a lot of townies have moved in. The road from Plancher Bas, where we go, turns off to Belfort (nearest big town) in the centre, and then the smaller country road goes along to Plancher Les Mines, which is an extension of the village that grew up around a mining industry that no longer exists. But a whole bunch of Belfortians have snapped up properties, or built new, in both places, and I've seen that so-called road to nowhere get busier and busier. It happens to run right alongside my in-laws house. In fact, my children, if left unsupervised, would be 2-3 seconds away from running out into the road in forgetful game-on excitement.  The speed limit immediately next to the house is 70 kph (about 43 mph) - already too high for a road along which people live. In some places, it reduces to 50 kph (31 mph), but of course people ignore that. They also ignore the 70 kph limit, to a quite obscene degree. Cars, trucks, and motorbikes roar along the road at motorway speeds. And as the road goes nowehere in particular (just up into the hills and beyond to more tiny little villages - all of which can be reached on bigger and better roads) these speed freaks are locals. And I've seen repeat offenders. One shitty little Rover 100 repeatedly goes by doing at least 100 kph, screaming down towards the roundabout in the centre, where the limit is 50 kph.  Ironically, it's not even a question of "someone will get killed" because people are always being killed. It seems to be the ambition of most of the youth of the area to kill themselves - or at least go into a 72 hour coma - before they are 22. They graduate from stupid little beesfart scooters to motorbikes to stupidly fast Peugeots in their attempt. We visit the cemetery each visit to see who has died recently that my wife was at school with.  With the motorbikes, I harbour a fantasy of stringing a nigh-on invisible wire across the road so that they decapitate themselves. Is this mean-spirited? I don't know. But I feel a deep, burning,  seething rage at the speeders. Because, let's emphasise: they're only driving from their house to their job, a short, 10-20 minute journey; or, more outrageously, they're driving to and from home for a two-hour lunch break. So they're driving through their own village, putting at risk their own friends and neighbours and their children in order to arrive 5 minutes quicker. Which is exactly what I mean when I talk about the moral importance of the way we behave towards each other in our cars.  Michel Serres once wrote of French driving habits and the incredibly high death/injury tolls (they have enough serious injuries in a year to populate a fair-sized town - well over 100,000 people). He compared it to the fabled (and possibly mythical) human sacrifices that were made, of old, to Moloch. He said, we worship machines and technology, and in order to prove our devition we sacrifice people - children and adults - to the great god of the machine.  In other French-related driving news, I sometimes "forget" to put the GB magnet on the back of the car. You'd be amazed at the difference it makes in terms of aggressive tailgaters and crazy, suicidal, overtaking manoevres. Idiots.  And here's a tip for French motorway drivers. No matter how aggressively you tailgate, no matter how fast you drive, no matter how much you insist on overtaking me back, little white cars with inferiority complexes, it all evens out at the Péage, where it's down to the luck of the draw, queue-wise, or just a smart and considered choice of lane. You twats.

      I just had a thought relating to a post that Rob made about a month ago: the one in which he said he wished there were more police cars out patrolling the roads.  I have seriously entertained the idea of keeping a letter I have from the Police in my glove compartment. Why? Well, it's on letterheaded paper and has a very large clear Notts Constabulary logo printed on the header. My thought is that when I'm being tailgated I wave the paper at the car behind, and give the impression that I am from the Police, but off duty. Sounds good, eh?  So far I've only been put off by my notorious bad luck: It would be just my luck to get tailgated by a speeding twat, I would pull out my Police letterhead and wave it at the twat behind, and it would turn out that  the tailgater  was an off-duty policeman, and he would perform a citizen's arrest on me for impersonating a Police officer. How ironic would that be?

      I just noticed I've used "man is a political animal" as a title for postings here twice. I apologise for that. It's that bloody Aristotle: he's just too "catchy".  Anyway. I've nothing worthwhile to say this time, but I just felt like having a moan about people who drive too fast through villages. I've already spoken about the "45mphconstantlius" subspecies of village speeder, and I never stop complaining about the juvenile speeder who doesn't know any better.  But it seems to me that everyone goes faster than 30mph through villages. I always end up with a train of tailgaters behind. Aren't they bothered about killing someone?  As far as I am concerned it is simply a display of aggression and disrespect towards locals. It's like their actions are saying, "fuck you! I don't care if I   do   run your children over." And where I come from that is fighting talk.  I am considering changing all the road signs in our area that point towards the M1 so that: a) either they all point in a huge circle, and after say 7 miles the driver who follows the roadsigns finds himself back where he started (actually most people wouldn't notice that and would circle forever or until they ran out of fuel). Or; b) make the signs point down a narrow country lane that gets narrower and narrower (making turning round impossible) with, at the end, a very muddy field so that all the cars get stuck in it, like mammoths in a prehistoric tarpit.  The rusty carcasses could then be auctioned to travellers for scrap.  That would be good.
