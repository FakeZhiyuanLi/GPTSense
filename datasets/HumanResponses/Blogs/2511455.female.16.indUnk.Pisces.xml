       Today I'm going to see a movie with my pals, Lianna, Margot, Rachel and Amanda. I'm not really sure what we're going to see, but Fahrenheit 911 is a possibility. What I think is , if it makes fun of good ol' George W then i'm all for it. what a dumbass......anyway I won't get into all that controversial crap seeing that I only have 15 minutes and I know I can't stop typing when I get started. The most recent movie i've seen was Anchorman. I loved it, it was so funny! If you haven't seen it I recommend that you do. Anyway I have to scoot.... I'll continue this later because I have to bus it to the movies...tres fun!    [3 hours later]    Hey hey, I'm back with 2 hours until I have to go to work. I ended up seeing Harold and Kumar go to White Castle. It was hilarious! I love playing battleshit....j/k. You should go see it,... it seems like a stupid movie but it is as funny as hell. Well, after the movie my friends and I munched on some fries and drank some slushies, of course brain freezes were involved. Then me and my friend Margot played DDR while Amanda, Rachel and Lianna ate candy and laughed. I was so embarrassed, not because of their laughing, because a crowd started forming around us and were just staring at our way cool moves.    As well as the movies was a fun time, I felt kinda lonely. Since their were five people, one person was left out of any sort of conversation, and that was me. Maybe i'm just being moody because "the painters are in" (lol, Georgia Nickleson) but I was talking to DJ and he feels the same way sometimes, like out of everyone we're the ones left out. Well for him its understandable because he's the only guy, but I dunno why does it have to be me? Anyway I'm getting kinda sad because of all this so I think i'll get going. I can't write anymore tonight because I'm working until 12:00am. Fun, fun, fun..... always fun in the life of Lisa.

       The day is ending... and I might as well tell you about the coolest people I know, my friends. The DR SMALL Gang...lol. D - DJ: The only boy in our group, he's fun to talk to, a good friend, adventurous and great at DDR.   R - Rachel: Rachee (as I call her) is an outgoing, happy all the time person with a big heart. A person who you wished would be your friend, and is mine! (hehehe)   S - Sydney: Her laugh and smile will brighten your day. Spending time with her will make you forget everything troubling you. She will forever and always be the pamplemousse!   M - Margot: Kooky, anime lover a great laugh and a special friend. Is very curious at times but, she is what a friend should be, loyal, trustworthy and generous. Remember shes not your mother and your not her daughter.   A - Amanda: Whats not to love about her. Cool as a cucumber and as crazy as a clam. A friend you don't want to give up, I know i'd jump in front of a bullet for her. *sings* Amanda she is a great big star........   L - Lianna: Also known as Lianno, Liannson, Linell or Stuart...just kidding. She my best bud, I've known her the longest out of everybody. She like my twin, in a weird twisted way. She's the best, she's Lianna Anderson√©.   L - Lisa: Hey thats me! What to say about me.... we'll i guess i'll leave it um to your imagination

       Hello, Hello, and Hooray for me. Its my first post on my brand spankin' new blog. And I've got loads to rant about. Just for all you people to know I proudly work at the shit capital of the world.....Cineplex Odeon. Well, it's not that bad I guess I do make some money but the two things I hate the most come up there... 1. Ignorant, Rude and Stupid people who sometimes cannot count for crap and 2. Heat like you were working in El Nino, Jeez it's hard to hold back the sweat. I for one suggest that they spring for an Air Conditioner....I'd acctually buy it for them...cheap bastards. Oh and we got a new manager, Ms. Hitler herself, German accent and all. After the shift is over she gives us a talking to,... it's like she doesn't want us to leave. She'll talk on an on about how in the old country they didn't use rags to wipe up things...they used bread. Now thats alittle over the line...bread?.... I assume that she probably eats it when shes finished. Good ol' Germans with their revolutionary ideas. Anyway, I'll get off of talking about my boss as it is getting me all worked up. But I came up with third thing that I can add to my list. I haaate working the night shift. Why? you ask, well i'll tell you why. 1. They usually give me two in a row, 2. I have to clean the popcorn machine and 3. I have to clean out the popcorn machine. Yes I'm aware I said that twice, but if you did it you would too. Not only does it smell like a burnt hobo but it's greasy, crusy and very big. And the only tools I get to fight off this monster: a brush, a knife and a spray bottle. (the knife is for scraping if you didn't already know.) Anyhoo, I think i'll be leaving because I have things to do before I go in for my death shift. Cya!      My good friends!  [Left to right] Margot, ME, Rachel.
