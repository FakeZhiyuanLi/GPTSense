						    Tax Cuts for Good Citizenship   In a democracy, every individual is a legislator, in that they help to make decisions.  Every individual has a job that everyone else in the community (and any individual who is affected by that community) needs to be done well.  A citizen who is aware of the world and interacts with their community is a more effective legislator than one who is not (not in the power of the vote, but in the wisdom that was used to decide on what way to vote).  Furthermore, a citizen who does not vote is allowing the government to have more control; to allow big business and other institutions to have more control over the choices of the representatives.  We can see two duties from these two concepts: 1. the citizen ought to be aware and conscious of everyone in his community. 2. The citizen ought to vote.  A citizen who does not fulfill either one or both duty is indirectly harming the other people in her community.  Thus, it would be just to reward the citizen who fulfills these duties, or to punish those who do not.  For example, we could give tax cuts to those citizens who have voted during a given year (a fixed cut of a certain dollar amount, ignoring percentages) and to those citizens who participate in community organizations that increase that individual's awareness of the diverse group of people in his community (both local, global, and everything in between).

						    Hatred, Mistakes, and Forgiveness  I'm sick and am generally annoyed for no good reason.  Tuesday nights are the night when I have a class with a very special professor; a professor who was engaged to the same woman I was engaged to, almost immediately before me.  I've heard a lot of gossip, from reliable and immediate sources, that he has ridiculed me in front of others, although he had never met me.  He'd give me the evil eye quite often over the last year, before I was in his class.  I could have sworn he even said, under his breath, "unbelievable," as he walked past me once on the third floor of Hagg-Sauer.  Unfortunately, the class was required, and there was no alternative.  I think we've coped quite well in the class.  It's actually been a growing experience, for myself at least, and hopefully for him as well.  But occasionally, when I'm in a bad mood, I want to embarrass him in front of the class, and perhaps take a swing at him or something.  He's a very nervous man, and I'm sure it would be the most entertaining and educational class most of the students will ever see at Bemidji State.  Today, I couldn't stop thinking about it for the whole two hours.  The class had also kept me from attending a post-Grand Canyon spring break trip that I should have been in, but I chose to endure my silent rage instead.    I should say, however, that he's not a bad guy, other than being an shit head.  He is an excellent lecturer, and he even assists the famine and poverty stricken in areas of Kenya, not by donations, but by living there two months every year and teaching them ingenious, simple, and nature friendly techniques for cultivating their farms.  Ass hole (from a purely subjective point of view, I admit).  Everyone has flaws, everyone has done things and behaved in ways that they wish they had not.  Its inevitable, and thus it is not just to hate someone, or condemn someone, for a mistake.  All we can hope is that we can learn from our mistakes.  Jack ass.       I still have a lot of shit to do--that law and economics paper has yet to be written, although I got some great ground work done this morning.  Take-home test has yet to be started.  At this point, I say fuck it.  It's 9:30pm, and I would be extremely inefficient if I started now.  I'm going to bed, and I'll wake up at 5:30am, whip up some magic, and be done with it.  I'm aggravated and stressed out right now, just in case you were curious.  Sweet dreams.

						   Well, a lot has occured since the last post.  Yesterday (Monday) was pretty busy.  I got some mental work done on my citizenship, law and education paper.  Many thanks go out to the diverse bunch of people who replied in response to my last post.  Your comments stimulated a lot of thinking, and I'll probably have more to say about that later today.  We also held the philosophy club meeting yesterday evening, where we talked about equality.  One of the basic problems we were trying to answer was how we are supposed to treat people who are different equally.  What does equal treatment mean, in other words.  Different people have different needs and different values, and if we were to treat everyone the same, we would inevitably be treating some of them unequally.  An easy illustration: everyone has different sized feet.  If we treated everyone the same by giving everyone the same sized shoe, anyone who has feet that don't fit the shoe will be treated unequally.  This is very different from moral issues such as rights of a fetus and affirmative action, but I think the necessary common aspect between the illustration and the real problem is evident.    Anyways, Eric, Molly, and myself went to Keg'n Kork for a single beer afterwards, at about 6:00pm.  Three pitchers and five hours later, Eric drove me home.  We had an excellent talk/argument/bonding experience...well, at least I did.  Molly and Eric know each other exceptionally well, so the bonding was mostly in my relationships with each of them.  We talked about love, relationships, the future, personal histories, and other such interesting topics.  I won't go into more detail, unfortunately, as much of the conversation was private.  You'll just have to trust me when I say that it was a very interesting conversation, so you should pretend I just had lots of interesting things to say, which will motivate you to visit this blog more often.  OK, I've got to go and deliver the remainder of my presentation on Heraclitus and strife, now.  Later today, I've got to pound out that law, citizenship, and education paper---it looks like it'll be 15+ pages...holy crap.  I've still got a take-home test for the same law and economics class due in two days, which, by the way, I haven't even looked at yet.  "What does not destroy you, makes you stronger."--Nietzsche.  (Quoted quite a lot, and yet, not lived nearly as much as it should be.)

						   If being educated is necessary to be an effective citizen, and therefore necessary for a democracy to be legitimate and effective, then should all voters be required to have a four year degree with a liberal education?  If that is the case, the government should pay for a higher education for all US Citizens, completely.  If this didn't happen, then the poor would lose their vote, which is clearly unacceptable.  If it is necessary for the security of the state and the liberty of its people to be educated, then the state, and taxpayers, have a duty to implement and pay for a system where everybody gets a higher education.  Furthermore, people must become aware of the  need  for a higher education.  If an individual does not desire or feel like they need to know something, they won't learn it.  A sense of urgency is required.  How can this be created?  Propaganda?  Where is the moral line there?

						    Citizenship, Education, and Law  Alright, so I've begun working on the paper concerning pragmatism, law, and economy in America.  I haven't written anything yet, just toyed with some ideas.  I began thinking about "instrumentalism," which is John Dewey's variation of pragmatism.  Instrumentalism, in the context of law, would say that we can create laws in order to change some aspect of our culture.  I also decided that I want to incorporate some of Robert Bellah's concerns about our nation's movement towards egoisitic individualism and away from a commitment to community.  During my interview, he also talked about how our nation's "democracy" is merely a facade.  Partly due to the lack of community involvement, and partly due to a lack of awareness of the rest of the world, the individual voter's opinions and beliefs are basically controlled by the government, big businness, and mass media.  Thus, although the form of the government is democracy, in actuality, it is much more of a plutocracy (literally "rule by money;" democracy is "rule by the whole people").  This also connects to John Stuart Mill's concerns about the tyranny of the majority in a democracy; since the majority opinion rules, the minority opinion and interests are effectively ignored; thus the minority becomes oppressed by the majority and loses all of their power.  Coming back to Dewey, he also had a a lot to say about democracy.  Dewey splits our national society into four areas: school, family, church, and work; in each sphere, democracy must be practiced, and each individual must be allowed their voice; otherwise, people will be oppressed (its been a while since I've read that particular essay; I'm sure that's not quite what he said.)  Also, both Bellah and Dewey were extremely concerned with the role of education in a democracy.  According to Bellah, too many people have the idea that an higher education's purpose is to help one find a job.  In my experience, this is certainly the case.  Consider how often one sees an add for a college that offers technical skills that will help you get a job compared to how many adds you see for an education that will make you a more effective citizen.  In a democracy, every individual is effectively a legislator; someone who makes decisions for the government.  Legislators need to be informed.    Anyways, somewhere in this mess of loosely connected ideas, I am going to try and identify (or blatantly copy) the primary problems affecting the community involvement of our culture, then identify some goals whose attainment will get us past the problems, and finally, try to think of some solutions, in the form of laws that will effect the economy, and eventually effect our society as well.  As I work on this problem, I'll do some more relevant postings on this blog, so if anyone has any criticisms or ideas, let me know.  (I always enjoy making others do my homework.)

						    Sunday Morning  Yesterday, I didn't get any homework done.  But I knew I wouldn't, so I got some movies instead.  I don't know much about movies, or where to look for a good one, so I enlisted the help of some friends, although without their knowledge.  On froyd.net, which is run by Sean Froyd (my roommate), there is a message board.  And on this message board, a group of people that have known eachother since high school are constantly arguing and ridiculing each other.  These people are Bemidji locals, by the way, and are that "second circle of friends" that I mentioned in my very first post.  Anyways, a few of them  do  know about movies, or at least think they do, and occasionally they come out with their own  "best 100 movies" list.  Shane Wahl, whose blog can be accessed to your left, is the ringleader, but it also includes Eric Cole, Nick Auger, and Jake Westrum.  So, I picked movies from their list when I decide its time to watch a movie.  Last night, the winners were "Taxi Driver," and "Fight Club."  Both movies are fantastic, and I definitely recommend them, if you can take come bloody violence.  Their also both male-oriented movies.  More than being a bloody action movie, they are both primarily thought-provoking movies, but you don't need to think to enjoy them.     Tommi  Tommi contacted me this morning, and invited me out to coffee sometime in the near future.  I was happy to accept.  That's all I'm going to say about that, for now.     Work  Its 9:37am right now, and I am looking forward to getting some work done today.  I'm going to make a quick stop at the coffeeshop, then get to work.  Today, I'll be studying for an "Intro to Art" exam, writing a paper on Heidegger's conception of "intentionality," and beginning a paper on how the American philosophy of pragmatism influenced the development of law and the economy of America.  I'm afraid that last one might turn out to be bullshit; not due to lack of effort, but due to a lack of strong influence.

						   I hate weekends.  I'm quite unmotivated today.  Maybe its because I drank too much wine last night, or maybe I don't feel the press of homework assignments, although I should.  I haven't done any productive work, in regards to school, since Thursday night.  I hate being unproductive, and I become somewhat depressed when that occurs.  That makes me less motivated, which then means I produce less, become more depressed, and so on.  This is one of the most frequent obstacles I encounter.

						    Optimism   The last week has been incredible.  The pieces of my life seem to all be coming together in an extremely positive way.  The future looks really bright at the moment.  I admit that I'm having a hard time keeping my head from getting too big.  Success is temporary.  There are few things in life that I know as well as that; although I have the sensation that my future is set, nothing could be further from the truth.  My life will fall apart at some point in the future; it may occur next month, later today, or maybe in a few years.  But at some point, I'm going to enter a position that seems hopeless, and the higher I have climbed, the more painful that desperate position will feel.  This may seem pessimistic to some, but it is a fact of life to me.  The prudent thing to know is that despair and strife are necessary parts of life, and there's nothing you can do to keep them out of your life.  By being aware, you are one step closer to being prepared.  Obstacles will manifest; be prepared for it, psychologically and physically.  This is, of course, something that we are all aware of, and I think we would all accept as common sense.  But I am sure that we are all prone to forget it, because when life is good, we don't want to think that life is going to be miserable in the future.      I had a good friend when I was in the Marines, Michael Watts.  He always told me, "Ben (that was somehow short for Bernard), It's not how you fall.  Everybody falls.  It's how you pick yourself up again."  He embodied what I consider the highest form of Honor.  Sometime before I knew him, he had bought a stereo from another guy in his platoon.  However, it turned out that the stereo was stolen, and thus Mike had unwittingly bought stolen merchandise, which is a crime.  His battalion tracked the stereo to Mike, and he was questioned.  Mike was told by his senior that they were required to charge him, even though his senior knew that Mike was innocent.  Mike understood this, and accepted the punishment.  I believe the law was unjust in this case.  Mike viewed the situation as one that he couldn't escape, and thus, his role as a leader was to be allowed to be used as an example, so the discipline and intergrity of the battalion would persevere.  He lost his rank, and was prevented from achieving the next rank for an unreasonable length of time.  His pay was also docked.  At this point, many Marines would have become spiteful of the Marines, and would turn into "shit bags," those Marines that have ceased caring about their role in the Corps and their duty to their brothers.  Mike, on the other hand, was motivated to work harder than ever.  His uniforms always looked the best, his physical fitness was superb, he did his job beyond what was required of him, and treated everyone fairly.  He was aware that shitty things happen, sometimes because of mistakes he made, sometimes because of things that are beyond his control.  But he was prepared for it.  He didn't throw his arms up, except perhaps in private, and then only for a short time.  He faced his new position, and struggled to attain what he was potential of achieving.    My friend Amy told me that my philosophy of strife is optimistic.  I think you can see why.

						   I have just returned from the Union Station, one of the best bars of Bemidji; it beats the other four by a long shot.  I'm fairly drunk right now, so I cannot remember clearly all that happened.  But that is alright, because nothing much happened.  Talked to Molly, Amy, Julie, Kvale (pronounced Qualie), Beth, and Chelsea some; perhaps others, too.  Some interesting talk.  Eric has an idea that Bemidji should construct a community center in Bemidji that would encourage a diverse selection of people to come to, to hang out and communicate.  While there woudn't be a drinking section, there would be sections for smoking.  There would also be no recorded or transmitted music; he wants to encourage music to be played by local musicians.  The idea was motivated by Bellah (spoken about in previous posts) and the purpose is for people from the community to share ideas with people they wouldn't share with normally.  I think it is a great idea, actually (I rarely agree with Kvale, because he is absurd).  The discussion we had tonight was fantastic for getting some different ideas out on the table concerning the perceived parking problem on our campus, which all of the groups seemed to concede was MERELY perceived, and that their wasn't a real problem.  OK, I'm going to bed, as I have a lot of work to do for the next week, and I need to start by Friday afternoon.  Goodnight.

						   OK; the time is now 6:25pm.  The storm is over, at least for a few hours.  Yesterday, I got the chance to interview Dr. Robert Bellah for the Northern Student, our student newspaper.  Bellah and four collegues wrote a book in 1986 called Habits of the Heart, which was a major study, and criticism, of American society.  They focus primarily on the ethics of individualism as an American way of life, and how a certain sort of individualism has been plaguing America.    There are different sorts of individualism.  The sort that was valued by such earlier people such as Benjamin Franklin and Henry David Thoreau expounded a strong individualism where somebody is supported by and supports the communities they are involved in.  They are self-sufficient in that they do not depend on society to support them in a one-way fashion; there is reciprocity.    On the other hand, we have moved towards a more egoistic individualism, where people look out for their self before they look at the needs of others.  Commitment to community activities such as clubs, organizations, and churchs have dropped dramatically over the last years (in the book, he mentios that churchs have been stable, but in the interview, he says that their membership has dropped as well).    The only sort of membership that has increased are support groups, which is essentially a group of individuals coming together for their selves.  The member stays in the group to seek help for the self, not for others.  When the member is cured, they leave the group.  It is essentially a group of people who come together so they can be by themselves.    The irony of the second sort of individualism is that it is directly against the ideologies of religions, democrats, and republicans.  They all value the "love thy neighbor" over the "love thyself," whereas the new individualism of America values the "love thyself" over the "love thy neighbor."  Bellah and his crew point to this continued movement to individualism as the primary problem of America, and it is not getting any better.    Anyways, the interview was a great experience.  A huge honor, I thought.  He's a celebrity in the academic world, and my experience was probably the equivalent of interviewing a movie star or big politician for others.    The paper on Heraclitus was a great success.  I still have a lot of work to do on it, but I'm really enjoying it, and look forward to presenting it on Student Achievement Day in a couple of weeks.  My mid-term in the history of law and economics was not such a huge success, however.  It went better than I thought it would, but it will definitely be a heavy weight on my final grade.  C'est la vie.  I did the best I could with the time I had; no regrets.

						    Wine  OK, taking a bit of a break at 11:20pm, and drinking a glass of merlot.  The battle is going very well.  I am enjoying the analysis of the various fragments of Heraclitus, and trying to put all the pieces together into something coherrent.  Everytime I go through the fragments, I find some new, subtle connection to another area of the fragments, and to my own life.  That is the good news.  The somewhat mediocre news is that it is taking me longer than I anticipated.  I probably won't be finished until 2:00am, at the earliest, and that is not including a read-through for grammar and writing a bibliography, which will include about a dozen books about Heraclitus.  I've never done so much outside research for a single paper before.  That is also good, as one should always be striving to accomplish more than one accomplished in the past, otherwise, you don't grow.  Growing is painful; another example of strife manifested in an obstacle that must be overcome.  I also realized that I still need to write two articles for the Northern Student's April fool's edition.  Another thing I remembered was that I was supposed to work from 8 to 10 tomorrow morning, but my friend Tessa was willing to pick those hours up for me.

						    End Game  The time is now 8:03pm.  The Heraclitus paper is due in fourteen hours.  Law/Economics paper is in nineteen hours.  I've got about ten pages sitting in front of me for Heraclitus, so I need to reorganize, rewrite, and revise tonight, study for the exam, and help my old friend Suzy with her philosophy paper.    Due to popular request, I will be writing long entries, but this one is an exception.  I've had an exciting day, and perhaps I'll tell you about it later, but for now, there are obstacles to overcome, and freedom to win.

						   quite tired; I've been working on an essay about this ancient greek guy named Heraclitus.  He's the one who said "you can never step into the same river twice."  My essay is about strife.  Heraclitus thought that war and strife, at least in a metaphorically speaking, are necessary, just, good, and beautiful.  Strife shows that some people are mortals and other immortal, some free and others slave.  I believe this to an extent; we only know our worth when we have been tested by some sort of struggle.  We are presented with obstacles in our lives.  Sometimes we overcome the obstacle, and prove our self-mastery and freedom.  Othertimes, we fail, and we demonstrate that we are not really in control of our lives.  Some people seem to be the masters of their own lives; in control of their actions and thoughts, and usually making wise decisions.  Others seem to live reactionary lives; they keep muttering about all the things that have happened to them and how they can't do anything about it.  Its the difference between asking,  "how is life treating you? (reactionary, slave assumption)" and "how are you treating life, (assuming freedom, self-mastery)."  Anyways, its midnight and I'm debating whether to stay up and slog through the paper, even though I am tired, or go to sleep and work tomorrow before class.  This is an example of strife.  Either option could be prudent, and if conducted properly, will facilitate the creation of an excellent paper.  But both could potentially be mistakes as well.  If I stay up, and yet am distracted because of my weariness, I will produce no paper and get little sleep, ensuring that I will not be fully aware and capable for the new challenges of tomorrow; but if I go to sleep, I will have to finish writing the essay entirely tomorrow along with the other stuff, which may not happen.  Two choices are given here, each with two likely methods of conduct (one negative, one positive), thus there are four general camps of conclusions that I could be in tomorrow.  Now I must choose and blah blah blah.  That is only useful and interesting to a point.  Just got a call from Suzy Iburg out of the blue, a girl that is 5 years my junior and grew up in the house next to me.  Haven't seen her in a long time; she needs help with a political philosophy paper on Plato's Republic, I guess.  I enjoy this sort of thing.    ok...tired, not going to bed, and clearly distracted.  I'm going to work on the paper now.  I've decided on a moderate choice; I'll make some progress on the paper now, get some good sleep, then tomorrow, print it off, make corrections, retype, and present on thursday.  Can't forget the test on thursday, and the discussion group that I will be a moderator for as well...its on individualism vs. citizenship.    I found out that I will likely be going to Atlanta during the last week of April with some professor for a professional workshop.  Neat-o.  I need to learn to write shorter posts.  That's what I told my friend Amy, but she knows me too well, and thus has no faith in my goal.  Good night.

						   Well, I had an incredibly interesting trip to the cities this weekend.  Odd things abounded.  First of all, I visited my old high school (Eagan), because my brother was coaching a speech tournament.  I ran into an old teacher who recognized me, and we talked for a bit.  I decided to walk around the school, and realized that all the classrooms were unlocked.  After visiting a few classrooms, I walked into a special one; the class in which I took accelerated math for two years, and got my ass kicked constantly.  At the time, I was a student who was never meeting expectations and so forth, and, acting like an 18 year old, I blamed the teacher and so forth.  Sitting in the chair, I knew I was a different person.  Where before I felt weak and the prey of mathematics, I now sat in the chair as a master of that realm.  My old spirit still dwelled in that chair, but it cowered in the presence of my current self.    Saw some speeches, met my brother's mentor and friends, then left.  Next thing was the Iranian party itself.  Very well done; good food, good music, good people.  I met this family whose mother was Iranian, and father was Cameroonian (Cameroon is in West Central Africa, between Nigeria and Congo).  There were three children, one woman, age 25, and two sons.  The oldest son graduated in Eagan '97, which is the same year as myself, although we didn't recognize each other at all.  He was only there for 1 year, and it is a very large school (over 2000 students when we were there).  When he left, he gave me his card so we could hang out next time I'm in town.  Onto his sister, May.  We talked for a while, and she was very cool, and beautiful; the half-persian, half-african blend can be an amazing thing with the right genes.  She works at the math department at St. Thomas in St. Paul.  She grew up in Cameroon until the age of sixteen, and went to school in Mankato.  She also loves "The Lord of the Rings," having read all the books a couple of times, and the movies a few times.  I plan on keeping in contact with her.        I went to bed on Saturday night, thinking that I had a satisfactory weekend.  How little did I know that it was not quite over.   I flew back to Bemidji Sunday morning.  At the airport, I ran into Tommi, my ex-fiancee.  We haven't seen each other or spoken to one another since November.  The last conversation had been very cold.  As I was getting into my Jeep, I saw her at her car, which was about fifty feet from where I was standing.  She had been dropping her mom off at the airport.  As she opened the door, I just looked for a moment, not knowing what to do.  She hadn't seen me yet, but I thought, "what the hell?"  "Hey!" I said, and she looked at me, noticeably surprised, and after a moment, said "hey." We stared at each other, unsure of what to do for a solid fifteen seconds.  Then I walked over to her.  The meeting was very warm.  We talked for a few minutes; she seems to be happy with her life right now.  We didn't have much to say, and she was late for work.  This entry has gotten quite long, but I have one more thing to say.  I know I have been angry with Tommi on occasion over the last few months, and have said and thought some pretty harsh stuff about her.  Well, I would like to take it all back.  I know that I can't, of course, but it is not how I really feel about her; I would like to keep her in my memory as I saw her today.  Despite our problems, I did love her because I find her to be an amazing person, and I suppose I do still love her to some extent.  Yes, she did hurt me, but I was the one who hurt her first by ending the engagement.  But don't read into this too much; I have no intention of starting the relationship again, or even contacting her.

						   Guests can now respond to my posts.  This means that there can be actual conversations on this blog now, and as you all know, I love a good dialogue.  Conversation is the meat and wine of life.  We had our weekly philosophy club meeting today.  Our topic today was the origin of values.  Where do our values come from?  Are they universal or do we create them?  Is life valuable?  How do we create and change values?  Does everybody understand what honor is?  What  is  honor?  What are we supposed to do when our values clash with those of others?    I think that from a universal, or "eye of God" perspective, there are no values.  Whether someone is insulted, cheated, murdered, or betrayed, or whether they are honorable, charitable, and honest, is irrelevant from the universal point of view.  They are essentially valueless acts and behaviors.  However, as humans, faced with the obstacles that society, and even bare existence presents us with, we must create value, and these are worth striving for.  Being honorable and honest is of higher value than cheating and betraying, because of the way that individual humans give meaning to these concepts.  Is this artificial?  That will depend on what one means by "artificial," but I would say that the meaning we give these concepts is certainly very real.  Even if it is artificial, we shouldn't assume that that automatically has less value...if you think it does, then you should ask yourself where that value comes from.  I'm clueless on that.

						   Hello, all!  My life is incredibly interesting...at least on occasion...and thus, you should read my new blog everyday...at least on occasion.   But seriously, check this thing out.  I will do my best to provide some stimulating topics as often as possible, so read, think, disagree, post, etc..  I love the basic experience of life; there is always an adventure to be had, if you look for it, and my life always turns out to be interpreted as such.  Whether this means I actually have an interesting life, or I just interpret it as such, is another question, and perhaps one that I am incapable of answering.  One note: I reserve the right to interpret my life in any truthful manner that I find appropriate, interesting, and stimulating.    A bit about myself, for now, that will be filled in later.  My name is Kamran, and I was born in Tehran, Iran, in 1978, during the revolution.  I was raised in the US in the suburbs of the Twin Cities, and graduated high school in 1997.  Hated school, hated living in Eagan, and so I joined the Marine Corps immediately, became an infantry man (machinegunner), travelled quite a bit, and finished my contract in 2001, months before the 9/11 attack.  Travelled to Bemidji, Minnesota in the Fall, where I have been studying philosophy for 2.5 years.    I've loved philosophy since I read the first chapter of Plato's Republic in '97, and I have looked at the world through that filter since.  I love the university, traveling, and am always interested in stimulating experiences, even if they prove quite painful.  I live by Nietzsche's aphorism, "what does not destroy you, makes you stronger," so I intentionally do some pretty careless things in my social and academic worlds to spice it up a bit.    I have two primary circles of friends in Bemidji; one is relatively stable, trustworthy, and will always be there to support me.  My "best" friends are located there.  My other circle is a bit more chaotic, less unified in opinions, older and more permanent bonds, more prone to arguments and dissention, and is also a valuable part in my life.  There is some overlap, and some friends exist in neither world.   I was engaged once, about 1.5 years ago, and the consequences of that relationship still challenge me occasionally in this town.    At this point, I don't believe life has any universal meaning, and so I try to create my own.  This idea manifests itself in my life by treating life as an experiment; bad stuff may happen, or may be caused by myself, but that is acceptable and desired.  I try not to let my friends feel the pain on the way.  Well, there's a lot more to say, but I won't say it now.

						    To Yarbles  [This is in response to a comment by Yarbles (Sunday, April 25), posted on the Shanism blog as a comment concerning my reading list comment below.]  Dear Yarbles,  I'm not sure exactly what your problem is with me, because your anger seems to be fueled off of more than what I have written on these blogs.  First of all, my  ad hominems  were meant in light hearted jest, because you simply have insufficient basis for the claims you were making.    On transliteration, I've seen both Dostoevsky and Dostoevski, and I was unaware that one was a more traditional error than the other, and thus more acceptable, as you say.  (For saying that I am somehow at fault for using the unacceptable error seems ridiculous to me; perhaps you could justify this.)  In my experience, I've seen Russian names end with a 'ski' more often than an 'sky' anyhow.  I'm aware that you are at least somewhat familiar with the Russian language, and in this, you are clearly more knowledgeable than myself.    As far as my description of  Notes from Underground  is concerned, the fact that my interpretation resembles others could be explained in at least two ways.  First, as you say, I could have copied some other person's idea, in the introduction of my copy, for example.  Or (and I'm certain there are others), these could be my legitimate thoughts on the topic, and they so happened to be like other people's thoughts, because it was an accurate representation.  I chose to read  Notes  because I enjoyed Dostoevsky's  Brother's Karamazov , and have been recommended  Notes  repeatedly, by professors and friends.  I haven't read or heard anything else about it.  My description was not based on anything else.  I'm not saying my description is accurate, but it clearly is not a copy.  You're jumping the gun by inferring that I am some sort of poser.  Concerning my "empty existence" and such, it is something I've considered, but have always rejected, almost with conviction.  I'm not going to defend myself to you; my life speaks for itself.  I'm certain that if you knew me, you'd never make such a comment, and would question the credibility and judgement of anyone who did.    To finish off, I can't help but to think that your comments are childish at best, idiotic at worst.  I may be trying to appear sophisticated, as you say (and which I question), but at least I am not providing outright evidence for the contrary.    To sum it all up in a few words, GROW UP YOU GOD DAMN JERK!  Have a nice day,   Kamran

						    The next morning   Ok, that was fun.  Yes, I spent far too much time out last night.  No, I do not regret it.  Sometimes a good conversation is far more important than getting enough sleep.    The issue of love once again.  The issue of empathy and emotional involvement was talked about.  Disclaimer: What I am about to talk about does not concern any particular individuals, although it has been inspired by actual examples.  There is no hidden message here.  Interpretation: The people whom I consider my best friends and family are the ones that have the greatest potential for making me upset, distressed, angry, happy, or causing any emotion.  The more time someone spends with another person, and the more communication that occurs (both verbal and non-verbal) the more emotional ties are created between the two individuals (this isn't an accurate way of describing the event, but it is practical).  If two individuals find that the other individual is capable of pissing the other one off due to the smallest action or variation in the tone of voice, it is clear that the two individuals are in an emotionally unhealthy relationship.     Has it ever happened to you where you're with somebody, and due to an action or communication (or miscommunication) that your entire consciousness is absorbed with feelings of anger, envy, frustration, or some other emotion that overshadows your clear mindedness?  That is what I'm talking about.  What are your possible choices?    First, you must realize the sort of situation you're in.  There are two individuals in a relationship that interact with one another to a certain degree. (I don't necessarily mean a romantic one...All individuals exist in relation to all other individuals and everything in their environment; however, the more one interacts with another element of this network of relations, being people, places, or things, the stronger those particular relations become.  More on that later)  These two individuals have a history, both independent of and shared with the other person.  Due to a great deal of interaction, and a great deal of history, two individuals can create a relationship so strong that it is beyond their means to live around the other person and still maintain control over their emotions.  (living meaning interaction, which can occur over the phone, or even through the rumor mill without each other's bodily presence)    An imperfect picture involves a balance beam that represents the relationship.  At first, when there are no weights added, the balance beam is balanced.  If a little weight is added to each side, which represents a little bit of emotional involvement, it is still balanced, and if one side has less weight, the beam is thrown out of balance, but the result is not catastrophic.  It doesn't take a lot of energy to bring balance back to the beam, and not much has been invested, so even if balance is not restored, there is no big loss.    On the other hand, when there is a great deal of emotional involvement, there are very large weights added to each side, and any imbalance would be catastrophic.  The balance beam could break, those involved could be hurt by falling weights, and the amount of energy required to return balance is immense.  One cannot simply remove all the weights and start over again, in this case.    Anyways, two individuals in this sort of emotionally entangled relationship have a couple options.  One, is to continue spending time with one another.  The relationship is already out of balance, and spending more time, meaning more interaction, merely brings a greater imbalance.  Something in the way the people interact needs to change, or time needs to be spent away from the other individual; a lot of time (I know this one from personal experience).  Perhaps eventually balance can be restored.  Strong emotions equate to strong emotional interactions, and thus a little love or hate causes the relationship to become stronger more quickly than a lot of mere friendliness or annoyance.  To love and hate someone at the same time is playing with fire---(but oh so fun!)     Observation: One last unrelated thing.  For some reason, at some times, our thoughts our more clear, and thus our communication is more clear than at other times.  Sometimes our words flow smoothly, and are understood by everyone around.  Sometimes, disjointedly, and one is unsatisfied with their ability to communicate.  This latter bit is how I feel now.  If there is something that was not understood, let me know.

						   Haha! I'm drunk!    It's Tuesday night. Or Wednesday morning, depending on how one looks at the situation.    I spent it primarily with Kvale, secondarily with Hanson, tertiary with Beth, Emily, and Molly, further supplementary social interaction provided by Chelsey, Donovan, McManus, Karl, Ethan, JJ, and Emily's two cats, Winston and Kittie.)    Goodnight.    (But it was a good, enriching night.  And my spelling is better than Kvale's while he's sober.  Did you notice how I used one disjunction and two conjunction at the beginning of a sentence in this message, which is poor grammar unless intended, up to this point?  I did, and I'm drunk!  Notice the time.  (The temporal, not spiritual variety, of time) I got to the bar at 8:10pm, because my favorite professor held class for an extra twenty minutes.   But everything is alright.  I worked hard today.  I read Plato's "Protagoras," and Dostoevsky's "Notes from Underground", in part.  Wheee!  Hanson just got his wisdom teeth pulled.  He looks like a chipmunk, because his cheeks are swollen.)  Before I was drunk, I was sober.  And my sober day was very good and industrious.  I read previously mentioned things.    Goodnight.

						   OK, so there is a book quiz on the internet that asks you questions and then tells you which book you are, as well as a neat description about you and your book.  It's something like a personality test with a twist.  If you want to take it yourself, hit the "book quiz" button at the bottom of the post.        You're  Roots !   by Alex Haley     While almost everyone agrees that you're brilliant, no one knows quite how to categorize you. Some say that you're a person with an amazing family tree. Some say that you're just a darn good storyteller. Others say that you're both and don't much care where to draw the line. What is known is that your people have been through a great number of trials and that you are where you are because of hard work. You have nothing to lose but your chains.

						    Changes   I've made a couple of changes on this blog.  Most obviously, my picture with Nietzsche no longer adorns  this page.  It was fun at first, but it got to be creepy.  Second, Shane and Kvale have lost their segregated status as philosophy blogs.  There are two reasons.  One, they are not philosophy blogs.  Two, somebody called me an existentialist on Friday.  I've thought of myself as an existentialist, but I never expressed that thought out loud.  Suddenly, somebody else had defined me as an existentialist, and I hated being defined by another.  I'll define myself, internally, so I can change it when I want to.  (If you don't understand the connection, think about it.)    Finally, the most important change is the name of the blog.  It is now "Observations and Interpretations."  Contemplating will still be a regular feature on this blog, but interpretation is far more interesting.  The previous post, for example, was not an example of my actual state of mind or the "true" events that were going on in my life---it was a certain interpretation; not false, but with other possible interpretations that are just as true that were not expressed.    When an event occurs in one's life, the individual often has the ability to give it a wide variety of different meanings, and respond to it in different ways.  The account of the event, as given by the individual, can help that individual gain some understanding of the event, as well as providing some meaning, or lesson, and some base as to how one will act and feel after the event.    Observing and interpreting are two of the most important and relevant tasks of the philosopher.  The philosopher is not capable of uncovering, or even attempting to uncover, some great, hidden mystery as to the ultimate meaning of the universe; that is an old wife's tale.  The philosopher tries to elucidate what should be obvious; the object is not to "know," but to see clearly; to gain a better understanding.  In our human way of experiencing the perceived world, this means observations and interpretations, not mystical encounters with the Truth.    (I believe that most philosophers will reject my account of the role of philosophers. That's OK.  We're all fools anyways.)      And by the way, I thought it would be important to tell you all that I got to hold a real human brain on Saturday. It was cool.   And also, it is even more important to tell you that this last weekend was a pivotal point in my life.  I may say more about it later, but basically, I gave the speech about strife again.  Except this time, it was far more passionate, both in its subject and its delivery.  My mind was whirling all day with the strife of passions.  I shook in my sleep that night with love and hate.  I was more powerful internally than ever before.  The experience was immense, and even frightening.  But as I sit here, I sense nothing more than an aftertaste.

						    Today   So today started out spendidly.  I woke up at 6:00 am and went running with a friend.  Then, I read some ancient Greek shit (Antiphon), then I walked to school, had a decent class, and walked back.  Then, I wasted most of the afternoon, worked a bit on my phenomenology paper, and went to an evening class.  Next, I went to the Union Station at 8:00pm, where I planned on staying for 45 minutes.  I just got home.  It is 12:51am.  Damnit.  I did have a great time, and I'm glad I stayed, but there is lots of work to do.  Am I drunk?  That all depends on what you mean by "drunk."  Just kidding, sort of.  I'm not drunk, but clearly buzzed.    Contemplations: Fuck love.  Love is great, but it is also hell.  Assuming you like spicy food, love is best described as really hot buffalo wings.  When you haven't had them for a while, you crave them quite often.  When you're eating them, you know it's painful, but you like it anyways.  At the same time, you frantically try to pacify the burning in your mouth.    Okay; I am and am not speaking of a specific person.  Does this make sense to you?  Of course not.  Do you think it makes sense to me?  The last week point five has been fun.  I feel as though I've suddenly become more attractive to women than I ever have before, although the time may be fleeting.  Why?  I don't know.  I feel more relaxed, and not as tempted to play nice.  I've been doing more pushups (that sounds ridiculous), so I look more solid.  I've been hanging out with Kvale, and, for better or worse, intentionally becoming more like him.  Women have been flirting with me more, a LOT more (there is a reason the "cry baby" was changed to "ladies man" on Eric Kvale's blog).  They've been giving me an anxious  look  (you know the one) more often.  Regardless, the bars have become something altogether different for me.     Women  have become something altogether different for me.  That is not to say that I have become a womanizer, but I feel closer to that extreme than I have before.  I worry about myself.  Men often act like jerks, but it is not because the man is trying to be a jerk; we are often too stupid and reactionary to become anything else.  God save me.  Goddamnit, I don't believe in that.    Besides all this, I'm still hooked on my old romanticist notions of an individual women having transcendental value.  There are women (only a very few) whom I regard this highly; whom are high quality, and deserving only of the best.  Not necessarily love, but  special  admiration.  Regardless, tomorrow comes quickly.  One year from now will be here before I have time to prepare, and then I will leave Bemidji, leaving any positive or negative perception (reputation) of myself behind.  This is bad for my friends, especially some female ones, as my only concern for the welfare of others is completely altruistic.  And that has become surprisingly week.  I've given my warning.  Don't trust me.  I like Bemidji because the social travails have become interesting, challenging, and fun.  I hate it because of the same reason.  This would never be possible in a big city like St. Paul, Minneapolis, or NEW YORK, for God's sake.  That's where I should go, where I'd always be anonymous, and incapable of hurting someone for more than a moment.    Who reads these blogs?  I only know of some, but what about those that I cannot detect?  Do I damn myself by posting such a message?  That all depends on what one means by damned, and who reads the blog, and who hears about the blog.  Fuck it.  I suffer no long term consequences here, except for academic or medical (that's a poor view, ethically speaking, in my opinion.  A clear violation of Kant's categorical imperative).  If things go sour, I'll only have a few months of hell, until January or May 2005 (ok, almost one year).  Bemidji is an experiment in my position.  Yee-haw.

						    carelessness   For some reason, perhaps my recent fascination with strife, I have been a bit too careless with comments and actions that I have made.  For example, I currently give tours to prospective students at BSU as a part of my job.  As I was bringing a fairly large group of students through the Lower Union Food Court, I noticed that one of the top food service managers was sitting directly behind me, and listening to my tour.  I always talk about food services at this spot, and when I talked about the walnut Hall cafeteria, I made it very clear, in a loud voice, that our cafeteria food sucked, which I don't even believe.  Hell, I don't even eat in the cafeteria.  Of course, the manager contacted my boss, and I had to deal with it when I got back to the office.    Actually, this incident isn't too bad; the only individual that was put into an uncomfortable position was myself.  But it is a specific example of the type of things I have done.  There have been a few other things said by me that  may  make the lives of my friends more uncomfortable.  There were no lies told, but perhaps some things that were implicitly known to be private were, while not disclosed, at least pointed to  (If this is too vague, then it probably doesn't apply to you).  In my opinion, that's not expressing loyalty and respect towards my friends.  I won't repeat what was said or done here, as it would only perpetuate the problem.  I need to have more control over when to keep my mouth shut (for talking as well as another thing).

						    Schizophrenia and Kamran Nature  Today was the "Student Achievement Conference" at BSU.  My parents flew up to Bemidji yesterday for the event, as I gave a presentation about strife, passion, and overcoming.  Overall, I was happy with the presentation, but I am still not entirely comfortable giving speeches in front of a group.  Its getting much better, though.  Two years ago, I gave a presentation about how we can use our understanding of the nature of mathematics to help us understand the nature of God.  I had a lot to say, and I managed to finish the entire thing in about seven minutes, because I spoke too quickly.  This time, I didn't have nearly enough time.  From what I gather, though, the audience enjoyed it (even Kvale, although I'm sure he has his problems with it.  I haven't talked to him about it.).    The last few days have been exhausting, and it wasn't entirely due to the preparation for the presentation.  We had a seven hour philosophy club on Monday.  The most interesting thing that occurred there was the social tensions that were disclosed between a few individuals.  They are in a complex relationship with one another, full of both love and anger bonds, that can manifest in different ways depending on the environment and current moods.  This time, it seemed especially volatile, but I think it will pass (It probably already has).  My parents were able to meet both friends and professors of mine.  Tuesday night, Dave Hanson, Eric Kvale, and Professor Brian Donovan joined us.  The situation was odd for me; I clearly have different worlds that I have lived in...My parents were most prevalent for my younger years, and Bemidji inhabitants are currently the prevalent ones. (That is not to say that the parents are less loved, or ejected from my life, but the role has changed.)  Anyways, whenever one is trying to understand a particular subject, one must understand it internally as well as externally in order to have a more comprehensive understanding; ie, through its  relationships  in its environment.  This applies to a person as well as it does to a piece of a puzzle.  What this means, is that I am, to some degree, understood by others, and myself, in part by my environment.  When individuals from two different environments come into contact, while I am present, it's as if there are two different identities of  Kamran  present; that I am living as, or dwelling through, two  different  Kamrans.  It is an enriching experience, but clearly an uncomfortable one.    This schizophrenic feeling occurred at different times while they were here; Bemidji is so small, that it was an almost constant experience.  The most challenging bit was when Professors Kit Christensen and David Lund treated my parents and I to coffee, and carried on a long conversation.  Fortunately, we talked politics; that is easier than talking about personal things.  Still, each group of people would describe me in an entirely different way if they were pressed to do so; the individual that the professors react towards is not phenomenally, or experientially, the same individual as my parents were react towards.  I was essentially being pressured into either being two different individuals at once, becoming someone new, picking one (and thus disrupting the experience of either profs or parents), or not acting at all.  Unfortunately, I think that I was none at all.    After reading my previous post about being an artist, Kvale criticized me as merely not knowing who I was.  The same criticism could be made from this post even more easily.  I think he is wrong.  By saying that I don't know who I am, one is implying that there is some unchanging "essence" of Kamran; that there is a "Kamran Nature" that I am ignorant of.  If I was constantly changing, then who I am changes; what I understand Kamran to be changes; and my experience demonstrates that I  am  a changing individual.  It does make sense to say that I am two different individuals to two different people, at the level of experience, of what is given.  This has suddenly become an interesting topic.  I'm going to write a paper on it, so if anyone has any relevant thoughts or comments, bring'em on.

						    Goodbye, Northern Student   I have just quit writing for the Northern Student.  The primary reason is lack of time, but the catalystic event occured somewhere in between being denied a "Philosophy Column," due to a lack of space, where I would try to write articles that would stimulate the minds of my fellow students, and then being assigned an article about the guy who ate a two pound, nine ounce burger at Bar 209.

						    Brief Statement on Saturday's Events  Saturday was a calm and productive day.  I spent most of the day reading and thinking about Zarathustra and overcoming, although there is no chance of me finishing the book right now as I planned.  Dave Hanson came over for a bit in the afternoon, although I left soon after to meet Amy and Julie at the coffee shop to study.  Tessa came over in the evening, where we had a few productive hours working on our presentations for Wednesday.  She left around 9.  I did some brainstorming for a couple hours, and then I went to bed.  Today, I still have mucho work to get done.  I'll post in the evening if there is anything worth blogging about.

						    Am I an Artist?  I was asked this question by Shane in the response to the previous post.  The answer depends on what one means by artist. I am  not  a visual or performance artist, which is what one usually means when they say "artist."  However, that is not what Shane meant.  Am I a creator?  What do I create?  Do I apply certain principles and create a purpose in my creation?  Am I willing to destroy a previous creation in order to give birth to a new one?  In the context of the last post, the object by which the artist does his work is the self.  In this sense, I am an artist, although perhaps not a proficient one.  I have always tried to recreate myself; to reject who I was with the intent of becoming someone new, and improved.    I've used different tools to do this; leaving my home at 18 and joining the Marines was entirely motivated by the desire to become someone new, although in that case, I was giving myself to an institution with the intent that   they  would recreate me, rather than myself.  But I have long since destroyed that self as well, except for a few aspects which I considered worth holding onto.  There are key points in my life where I chose to change: becoming a philosopher as a Marine; leaving the Marines to go to school, becoming a Christian, becoming an atheist, getting engaged, breaking off the engagement.    These were more than simple actions; they each defined who I was.    Just like the easal of a painter, my life is an experiment for me; I try new things to see what happens.  Sometimes, the results are satisfactory.  Othertimes, a failure.  One must remain creative, new, changing, and active, while also using some principles of form, and a foresight as to what one wishes to accomplish.  And even when this is achieved, it is not satisfactory to admire one's work for more than a few moments before destroying it and creating something new.     How are you an artist?

						    Who is Zarathustra?  In Nietzsche's  Thus Spoke Zarathustra , Zarathustra is the herald of the overman, although I am unsure if he is an overman himself.  The overman is something that is "beyond man," which I  think  means someone who has basically: 1. destroyed all of one's old values, and 2. created a new set of values.  These values provide the meaning and purpose by which an individual lives their life.  This involves destroying who one is now, and recreating the self in light of the new meaning that one has given for oneself.  This is not the end, however.  One must continually destroy and recreate oneself; it is how one grows and constantly goes beyond oneself.  It is an uncomfortable existence; someone who has embraced a life of strife.  "You have made danger your vocation; there is nothing contemptable in that," said Zarathustra to the dying tight rope walker.    (I'm simplifying this a lot; more will follow.)   Zarathustra's Overcoming    The overcoming of Zarathustra is an intense and immediate experience; one cannot experience it as detached, despondent, or passively.  One must have passion, strength of will, focus, discipline, and understanding.  The mind must be sharp and possess a keen situational awareness.  There must be a desire to change; to want to cease being who one is in order to become something else.  One must see a purpose in changing.  The purpose is necessary in order to provide the motivation for success.    Strife, and the obstacles created by it, serve as a gauge for those that want to overcome, because they need some way of measuring their success.   The willing and overcoming spirit relishes a challenge for just this reason.  It is a self-affirmation for a being in a state of becoming.    Those who follow Zarathustra cannot do so with blind, unquestioning loyalty.  They must go willingly, always with the potential to leave when they are no longer interested in staying.  Zarathustra will be followed because he is strong, or not at all.  He must be "followed" by equals; fellow creators, fellow harvesters.   Questions for Readers  What is strife for you?  Do you embrace it, or avoid it?  Do you find value in strife?  What does the act of creation do for you, especially the act of creating your self?

						   "Man is capable of standing superhuman suffering if only he feels sure that there is some point and purpose to it, while much less pain will seem intolerable if devoid of meaning."--Walter Kaufmann, in his "Translator's Introduction" for  Thus Spoke Zarathustra .  Do you have purpose in your suffering, or do you run away at the thought of strife?

						    Eye of the Hurricane  I have finally finished all of the business with the Citizenship paper and take-home test for the Law and Economics class.  I was up until about 4:00 a.m. last night, and because of all the caffeine in my system, I never really got to sleep, although I was out of bed by 6:00 a.m..  That was a legitimately difficult three days.  I'm granting myself a few hours break and a single good night's sleep tonight, although tomorrow I have to get back to the fight.  I have yet another large project that will be presented on Wednesday.  I'll be returning to Heraclitus and strife, although I am shifting my focus from the interpretation of his fragments to an existential and phenomenological examination of strife and overcoming obstacles.  I'll be blogging about strife and obstacle-overcoming constantly for the next few days as a result. It should prove to be an interesting presentation for Student Achievement Day, if you're available to see some of the presentations.    I'm looking forward to this project.  The business about citizenship, education, law and such was fun, but not my primary interest.  Perhaps some other time.  Tomorrow, I will begin researching by reading through Nietzsche's  Thus Spoke Zarathustra  for the second time.  That is a fabulous and fun book to read.  Check out this blog for the barrage of thoughts that will be stimulated by that book.    But for now, I'm going to bed at the sweet time of 9:14 p.m..  The academic war will resume at 5:30 a.m..  God, I feel like I'm in the Marines again.  Except there's no camoulflage paint or machine guns.  But other than that, its identical.  Actually, philosophy would be more fun with camoulflage paint and machine guns.  I'll bring it up to Dr. Christensen.  Good night.

						    Blogs   I'm beginning to become bored with writing blogs entries.  Lately, I have strived to become more empathetic with individuals that I come into contact with.  The blog is counterproductive towards that goal, however.  I'm thinking that I may try to avoid blogging, and take up writing letters to my family.  I'm not certain yet.  They both have their disadvantages and advantages.    Spending time in Athens (Georgia), I was able to spend a lot of time with some great professors from Barnard College, The University of Georgia, and The University of Texas, as well as some amazing students from Barnard and UG.  The quality and quantity of my conversations and classes during those four days were unmatched in my life.  I would like to strive for more depth in conversations and interactions with individuals.    Anyways, I love as good conversation.  It is my favorite past time.  If you've got something interesting to converse about, I'm all ears.

						   My life is too comfortable.  I almost wish for a r–  	I was going to write, “for a real tragedy,” but I was writing for someone else to read it.  Every time I write or am in public, it is a performance.  It is only when there is great passion, or when I write for what is written–not for who is reading–that there is any honesty in my words.  I am a dishonest person; dishonest to the world and dishonest to myself.  I am doing it at this very moment.  I keep slipping into it.  I improve for a moment, and then descend again.   	But am I any worse than the other people in this sterile city?  Maybe not everyone.  There are at least a few who seem genuine, or at least have flashes of genuineness more than the norm.   	We are a nation of jerks.  But we are no worse, inherently, than anyone else.  If another group of people had been through what we have been through, they would be just as horrible.  I make it sound as if we are the victims.  In a sense, we are.  But we are victims of ourselves-our decadence is inescapable, and so we are prisoners–but we imprisoned ourselves.  We would break free id we only thought that this cage was a cage. 	I am too egotistic–that is the problem.  I read myself in everything I admire, and in everything I despise as well.  I think about myself more than anything else.  I am doing it now (although at the moment it is necessary).  I like to stare at my face in a mirror–to study it and admire it–and the more beautiful or ugly I perceive it to be, the more I am fascinated by it.   	Is any of this true?  Yes, but not all of it.   	In the suburbs, where life is too easy, the hardest thing is to become strong in honesty, courage and far reaching compassion, and struggle when it is not necessary; when one could be comfortable living as everyone else does.  The American suburbs are sterile.

						   Alright, I'm going to start writing on this blog once again.  May through the beginning of June has always been a bit depressing, at least since I began school three years ago.  They were always exciting before that for some reason.  After the excitement of the semester, I enter into a period of minimum productivity until I hate myself that it serves as a catalyst to start doing something worthwhile again.  So, I'm not sure if anyone reads this anymore, and that's acceptable.  Over the last few weeks I've wanted nothing more than to stay away from people for almost the whole day--spending it in seclusion so that I can study or reflect, and then spend just a few moments with others for conversation purposes.  Since my last post, about 45 days ago, I've been to Seattle to take care of my grandmother, started an easy summer class, gained a girl friend, read two mediocre books, and finally regained my motivation.  Lately, I've been occupying my time by spending quality time with Jennie (my gf), studying Nietzsche (via Kaufmann's "Nietzsche:P,P&AC), Sartre, Intro to Psych (my summer class), and reading "The Idiot," by Dostoevski.  I am currently in Eagan in order to serve on Jury Duty (which was cancelled) and for Father's Day.  My friend "The Stingray" has returned from Iraq, and is starting a military intelligence school at Virginia Beach.  I'll be seeing him along with Joe (another Marine) in Pennsylvania during August.  If there are too many readers, I will destroy this blog and create another one, which will have an undisclosed address.  You have been warned.

						   Well, I've spent one night in Amsterdam, and four in India since my last post.  We'll be leaving in three days.  I'll write more about it when I get back to Bemidji.    Reading "The Idiot" right now--too personal.

						   The effort to arrive at a genuinely peaceful world would appreciate the absence of conflict, pain,&nbsp;or strife&nbsp;of any sort.  But the effort to be greater, to overcome, to attain perfection, the so-called "will-to-power," demands struggle, is driven by the fight against what is unwelcome, and so&nbsp;is secretly pleased that evil has come to play, while publicly denouncing it and raising an eager sword.&nbsp;&nbsp;

						   The bad news: I spent five hours writing the last post.  The good news:&nbsp;Five hours ago, I had no idea what I was going to write my paper about, and now I have a rough draft that is over twice as long as the five page minimum (when double space, 12 font, Times New Roman).  I'm going to sleep.&nbsp; I've written over twenty four pages today, did my laundry, cleaned the kitchen, and played Medieval: Total War for two hours (killing the Egyptian-Muslim infidels with my panzy Frenchmen, and then getting invaded by another Muslim faction from the south)--making this the single most productive day of my LIFE!&nbsp; I love(m) life.&nbsp;

						   Do I love life?&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; A professor from Denmark is currently teaching a class entitled, "The Philosophy of Love."&nbsp; We've been expecting him here for two years, now, and he has finally arrived.&nbsp; I was looking forward to this class, especially considering my experiences in love for the past two years.&nbsp; Now, seven days into it, I am annoyed by this class.&nbsp; I was hoping to plunge into the depths of this human experience.&nbsp; This force, intensely powerful and destructive at times, quite mild and pleasant at others, that many people would agree is the most wonderful and meaningful aspect of the human experience.&nbsp; Love was bold, passionate, powerful, and dangerous.&nbsp; I was working on a paper that described love as a potentially powerful force that could charge an individual with the internal motivation and purpose needed to struggle through and overcome the greatest of obstacles--that it can, depending on one's situation, make one a warrior of life, against the elements that seem bent on caging one in.&nbsp; Love is the&nbsp;sword of a struggling sole.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  This class, however, is not about that.&nbsp; This class&nbsp;abstracts love, and makes it so ideal, so optimistic, that it is not only completely detached from any experience I've ever had (except when I'm intoxicated), but it makes the&nbsp;idea of love nauseating.&nbsp; I don't even want to think about love right now.&nbsp; Worse still, the arguments seem so invalid and confused, interpretations of philosophers determined by how the&nbsp;professor wants to see them rather than what is obvious, and so optimistic that he&nbsp;begins with&nbsp;what he thinks ought to be the case rather than what certainly is the case, that&nbsp;it doesn't even constitute good philosophy, in my humble opinion.&nbsp; I may be mistaken about all this--after all, I've been studying philosophy for three years compared to his thirty (I'm guessing).&nbsp;&nbsp;I may be ignorant--but I am not an idiot.&nbsp;&nbsp;When&nbsp;I subject his argument to the most sympathetic and analytical skills I have, it still turns&nbsp;out to be bunk.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  He begins by saying that if the good life is possible for anyone, then it&nbsp;is moral and right to say that the good life is possible for everyone.&nbsp; And that if we were to say that it isn't possible for everyone, then we are immoral.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is&nbsp;his first point by which he starts with, and everything else is based on this.&nbsp; And this is where I&nbsp;find my first problem.&nbsp; We may want to say that it would be better for&nbsp;the good life to be possible for everyone than only some.&nbsp; We could say, that if there was a good and just&nbsp;omnipotent&nbsp;God, then the good life should be possible for everyone.&nbsp; But what if we don't assume a good and just God?&nbsp; What if we look about&nbsp;the world and see much of it&nbsp;plunged in chaos and arbitrary death?&nbsp; And I'm not talking about the human world alone.&nbsp; I can go into my front yard and witness ants besieging a sow bug and&nbsp;eating it while it's still alive.&nbsp; I can see a cat pounce on and kill a bird,&nbsp;and then leave it half dead without eating it.&nbsp; In the human world, acts of&nbsp;arbitrary killing seem even worse because we assume&nbsp;(quite rightly) that he are self-aware, morally capable individuals, and that we ought to know better.&nbsp; The seven&nbsp;year old boy in the Congo who&nbsp;was raised in a war, given an AK-47, and assists in slaughtering and raping&nbsp;women villagers is not living in the same world that I do, and most likely not the same world that you do.&nbsp; Neither does&nbsp;his victim.&nbsp; If someone is living a life that is completely reactionary,&nbsp;who is operating only on the instinct of survival, who lives in constant fear of starvation, disease, war, rape, or the death of her family, then this "good life" is  not  possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is possible for me.&nbsp; Is it wrong&nbsp;for me to say so?&nbsp;&nbsp;I have lived an overall privileged life where I have never been hungry (other than in military training), always had a warm place to sleep, money for clothes, leisure time, access to mass media, and most importantly, the ability to study philosophy and experience love.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't need all of this to have the good life.&nbsp; I'm&nbsp;sure plenty of people would claim that they live the good life who don't study philosophy, or even those who have far less material&nbsp;wealth than I do (and I'm not talking about college student poor--I'm talking 3rd world country poor, which is the shits)&nbsp;What if the good life really isn't possible for everyone?&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it then moral to lie to ourselves and say that we ought to say that it is possible for everyone?&nbsp; Is it immoral to be honest, and say that it really isn't possible, despite how tragic that is?  &nbsp;  The good life is&nbsp;treated by the professor as something real, something achievable, and most importantly, something universal.&nbsp; At first he seems to say that the good life is defined by the individual, in that it is subjective, what is the&nbsp;good life for me may not be the good life for you--but then he denies that a thief or a killer can lead the good life (they are still capable of it, but they would have to cease being a thief or killer), and denies that they could ever be really happy--if they appear happy, it is merely a show.&nbsp; How can&nbsp;he make that judgment?&nbsp; It is not empirical, and it is not rational.&nbsp; It is based on what he wants to see.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  He says that the essential part of the good life is the love of life--and we are all capable of the love of life.&nbsp; The skeptic in his manuscript asks, "well I don't love life, does that mean I can't have the good life?"&nbsp; And the professor replies, "but you do love life--you love being a skeptic, that is your reason for living!"&nbsp;&nbsp; I ask, "what if the&nbsp;killer loves life?"&nbsp; He replies, "the killer is not doing a loving act--the killer hates&nbsp;his victim, he hates life."&nbsp;&nbsp;"But what if he loves the act of&nbsp;killing--killing&nbsp;is his reason to live."&nbsp; The professor shakes his head and looks down sadly.&nbsp; "Can a hunter love hunting?"&nbsp; Some class members avidly agree, and the professors eyes look up with&nbsp;a glint.&nbsp; "Can a cook love cooking?"&nbsp; Certainly.&nbsp; Recalling&nbsp;that earlier in the day, that this is not a racist philosophy--that it&nbsp;does indeed&nbsp;include sentient animals, I ask, "what then is the difference between a hunter hunting deer and a cook preparing meal out of flesh, and the killing and cooking of gourmet meals of human flesh by Hannibal Lecter?&nbsp;&nbsp;Hannibal, according to the movie,&nbsp;put great care and creativity into killing his victim in an almost artistic manner and then making a gourmet&nbsp;cuisine from the&nbsp;victim's flesh.&nbsp;&nbsp;He seemed to genuinely enjoy it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although Hannibal is a fictional character,&nbsp;the hypothetical case serves&nbsp;just as well and serves to point&nbsp;to a flaw in his reasoning.&nbsp; Did the professor defend&nbsp;my critique, or offer to&nbsp;abandon his position?&nbsp;&nbsp;Alas, no, he did not.&nbsp; He&nbsp;spoke to those who were disgusted with my example, and when he&nbsp;seemed convinced that he had persuaded them&nbsp;(who were&nbsp;philosophical&nbsp;virgins), he continued his argument, leaving me annoyed and&nbsp;unsatisfied.  &nbsp;  He uses this tactic quite a lot.&nbsp; I'm the only philosophy student in the class--Kit Christensen's son Mike is as well, and he is a philosophy student, but he hasn't spoken much and&nbsp;has missed a couple of days.&nbsp; Often, I'm the only one raising the objection, and&nbsp;when he placates the easily placatable, he moves on.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Well, I intended on answering the original question, but its clear that I have had a lot of unexpressed&nbsp;opinions about this class that I needed to get out of the way.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Do I love life?&nbsp; I could answer it like this: of course I love life.&nbsp; First of all, (1) there are plenty of things I love to do, such as think, read,&nbsp;talk/argue, travel, enjoy female&nbsp;intimacy, etc., and in order to love these, I must&nbsp;live, and&nbsp;so I love life.&nbsp; Second, (2)&nbsp;if I did not love life, there would be no reason to continue with life.&nbsp; There would be no&nbsp;reason to&nbsp;get out of bed, no reason&nbsp;to eat healthy foods and stay fit (although&nbsp;I  have  been&nbsp;lax on that one lately), no reason not to&nbsp;kill myself.&nbsp; But there is a reason.&nbsp; Thus I do love life, and that love&nbsp;of&nbsp;life is my reason for getting out of&nbsp;bed in the morning.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  But I have a problem with those answers.&nbsp; In the first case (1), my reasoning is that I love x, and x is dependent on&nbsp;y, thus I love y because it&nbsp;allows me x.&nbsp; I don't know if I can prove that wrong, but it seems to&nbsp;me wrong.&nbsp; Love is always love of something, and it is an experience.&nbsp; If&nbsp;I love Sara (hypothetical character), then when I think of her, or speak to her, or she touches me, I&nbsp;feel something intense.&nbsp; It is not her surrounding that&nbsp;does this to me, or her house, or the city she lives in, or her parents--but just  her .&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose Sara lived in New York&nbsp;city and she refused to leave the city, because she loves it so intensely, and perhaps&nbsp;she&nbsp;is either afraid or has no reason to leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I don't like the city.&nbsp; In fact, I love small quiet rural towns, like Bemidji (bullshit, but hypothetical...) In my life, New York is a necessary part of Sara.&nbsp; If I get New York out of my life, either by leaving it or&nbsp;destroying it, I have also lost my love.&nbsp; New York is a necessary&nbsp;condition of&nbsp;being intimate with Sara, and yet I don't love New York.&nbsp; Life is a necessary&nbsp;condition&nbsp;to&nbsp;thinking,&nbsp;but does it&nbsp;follow that&nbsp;if I love thinking, then I love life?  &nbsp;  Another objection is in the fact that while life is a necessary condition for one's love of something, it is not sufficient.&nbsp; The above reason said, y is dependent on x for its existence, I love y, and thus I love x.&nbsp; This implies that my love of x is dependent on my love of y.&nbsp; But if I love both being loved by Sara and life, and suddenly Sara denies my love, it doesn't imply that I lose my love of life.&nbsp; So, the reasoning above, that I know I love life because I love Sara's love for me, is shown to be fallacious, since I can love life without Sara loving me.&nbsp; On the flip side, if I did lose my love of life after I stopped loving Sara, then we would want to say that I wasn't in love with life--that I merely deceived myself into thinking so, and simply using the special properties of life (existence!) in order to get to my love of Sara.&nbsp; No matter how we look at it, there is no necessary condition between one's love of life and one's reason for living.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  In the second case (2), it is clear that there is some motivation for getting out of bed and "living" life, and that motivation is my  reason  for getting out of bed.&nbsp; That reason could be anything from (A)"I'm hungry so I'm going to make myself some breakfast,"&nbsp;to thinking, (B)"I am really anxious to read some Plato today," or even because I think, (C)"I love life!&nbsp; I&nbsp;can't wait to get out into the world and feel my heart beat and&nbsp;my muscles flex as I go for a run along the lake!"&nbsp; Indeed, I have felt all&nbsp;of these before, sometimes none, and sometimes all.&nbsp;&nbsp;The important thing to notice is that each one of these reasons has a different feeling.&nbsp; In the first case, I am hungry.&nbsp; Hunger is a sort of&nbsp;longing, and can be uncomfortable or even painful.&nbsp; As sad as it is, there are many people and animals in the world who are motivated to do anything and everything because of this, or other survival reasons.&nbsp; Does this show that they&nbsp;do love life, or that they have no reason to love life?&nbsp; Well, most of them are&nbsp;not committing suicide, which means that either (P) they do love life, or that simply because (Q) one has a reason other than love&nbsp;of life for getting up in the morning.&nbsp; This is a simple either/or, P&nbsp;v Q (meaning that it must be at least one, and it could be both).&nbsp; If they do have a reason for getting up in the morning other than love, then we cannot say that this reason implies that&nbsp;I do have love,&nbsp;although I offered this reason (2) as a demonstration of my love when I&nbsp;first asked if I love life.&nbsp; So, to be consistent with my answer in (2) above, I would want to reject the Q and thus accept the P.&nbsp; But we cannot deduce P simply because we feel inclined to reject Q.&nbsp; Is P a viable answer?&nbsp;I think that the evidence shows that it is  not .&nbsp;&nbsp;P is saying that these people and&nbsp;animals who spend their whole, or nearly their whole life&nbsp;in the effort to survive, who are motivated&nbsp;merely by hunger and&nbsp;need for shelter, love life.&nbsp; If we&nbsp;were to accept that they love life, then we are saying that either (R) they experience the same thing&nbsp;throughout their struggle for survival as when I wake up in my air conditioned home and shout "I love life! I look forward to living life to the fullest today, as if there were no tomorrow!"&nbsp; or (S) the love that I feel and that the survivors feel is so radically different that the word love&nbsp;means two different things in each case.&nbsp; Love for me is some ecstatic,&nbsp;thrilling experience, and love for the survivor is a mere clinging to existence, like the clinging of a life raft in the middle of the ocean.&nbsp; And while it makes sense to say that&nbsp;the castaway loves his raft, it is a reactionary, instinctual love, rather than my active, passionate love.&nbsp; We can accept that this is love, but that it is a different kind of love is a necessary distinction that we must make.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will call the active&nbsp;love,  love(m),  and the reactive,&nbsp;cling-to-life-love,&nbsp; love(n). &nbsp; Love(n) of life is thus&nbsp;a sufficient and necessary reason for living life, and it is necessary but insufficient to have love(m) of life.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  If we are going to say that the love of life leads one to the good life, then we must ask ourselves, what sort of love?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Is it the&nbsp;love(m) sort only that gives us the good life, or can we extend it to love(n) as well?&nbsp; Let's try to&nbsp;assume each option independently.&nbsp; If&nbsp;we assume&nbsp;that only love(m) leads to the good life, then&nbsp;a good life is rich indeed, constantly&nbsp;filled with excitement, joy,&nbsp;passion, the feeling of free will, and security.&nbsp; We'll reject love(n) as&nbsp;being sufficient for the good life, which means that we can now reject&nbsp;both R and S above, and thus we can&nbsp;also reject P, and so we must accept Q: they do have a reason other than the love(m) of life in the morning.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  P1: P&nbsp;or Q  P2:&nbsp;If P,&nbsp;then (R or S)  Conclusion: Q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Proof:  P3: Not R  P4: Not S  P5: Not R and Not S  P6: Not (R or S)  P7: Not P  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  We can then return to the question, do I love life?&nbsp; We can now ask the question in two different ways.&nbsp; First, do I love(m) life?&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, do I love(n) life?&nbsp; I gave the answer in the affirmative and used two reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first reason was that I love things in life, and life is necessary for those things to be loved, and so I love life.&nbsp; I rejected the on the grounds of love's intention.&nbsp;&nbsp;This first&nbsp;rejection applies to both types of love, as the rejection was based not&nbsp;on the content or sensation of the love, but on the&nbsp;thing-that-is-loved; on the fact that love is intentional.&nbsp; Regardless of whether I was talking about love(m) or love(n), the refutation stands.&nbsp; Furthermore, the love I spoke of there referred to love-of-things in general, but love(m) and love(n) are specifically loves of life itself.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;My second reason was "if I did not love life, there would be no reason to continue with life."&nbsp; The meaning of this reason changes a great deal depending on what sort of love I am speaking of.&nbsp; A logically equivalent&nbsp;way to state the reason is, "if I did not love life, I would have reason to end my life."&nbsp; So, there are four instances of the statement, and they can be divided into pairs due to logical equivalency.&nbsp; The first pair states, "if I did not love(m) life, there would be no reason to continue with life," and "if I did not love(m) life, I would have reason to end my life."&nbsp; The second pair states, "if I did not love(n) life, there would be no reason to continue with life," and "if I did not love(n) life, I would have reason to end my life."&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll examine the second pair first.  &nbsp;  These second pair&nbsp;propositions are essentially saying that if I am not willing to, and have no instinct to&nbsp;struggle for life, then I may as well kill myself.&nbsp; This makes a lot of sense.&nbsp; For someone who's&nbsp;sole occupation has been to&nbsp;cling on to survival has suddenly found no desire to do even this, then why continue?&nbsp; What reason is there not to kill oneself?&nbsp; Someone who does not love(n) life, does indeed have no reason to continue.  &nbsp;  The other pair is more problematic.&nbsp; These state, if I do&nbsp;not have an excited, passionate, active, and joyful feeling about life, then I&nbsp;would have no reason to continue and reason to end my life!&nbsp; Gagh!&nbsp; If that were true, I'd kill myself right now.&nbsp; But even if we discount the inevitable periods of ecstaticless, joyless, and yet non-depressive life,&nbsp;we must think back to the people who only have love(n) of&nbsp;life.&nbsp; There are plenty of people&nbsp;who do not love(m) life and still find a&nbsp;reason to continue on with life.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when&nbsp;I ask myself,&nbsp;"Do I love(n) life?" I can now say, "absolutely," as would&nbsp;nearly anyone who is alive (unless they&nbsp;desire to commit suicide but are unable).&nbsp;&nbsp;But&nbsp;when I ask myself, "Do I love(m) life," well, I suppose I do, but that does not mean that I am feeling it right now.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  When the professor says that the love of life is the necessary and sufficient condition of the good life (he never said it exactly like that) I must then ask myself, what sort of love is he talking about?&nbsp; Well, he never made any&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;distinction like the one I just made.&nbsp; He&nbsp;divided love into the universal, subjective, and existential (love of the world, love of individual people or things, and love of existence).&nbsp; He denied the classic&nbsp;distinction between philia (friendship), eros (romantic, passionate), and agape (divine), and was resistant to any other distinction.&nbsp;&nbsp;He claimed that these other distinctions didn't really demonstrate a true categorical distinction--rather they were aspects of the same thing.&nbsp; But in assuming that everyone can&nbsp;have the good life, and that&nbsp;the love of life will result in the good life, and given my arguments above, I am adamant that we cannot dispense with all these distinctions--to include the one that I made above, which I think is especially relevant to this topic.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Is everyone capable of the good life?&nbsp; The&nbsp;professor says, "yes, because everyone is capable of loving life."&nbsp; Well, is this the love(m) of life, or the love(n) of life?&nbsp; If it is the love(n) of life, then yes, everyone is capable of the&nbsp;good life.&nbsp; What the good life then means is that one&nbsp;is compelled to struggle for existence.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the necessary and sufficient condition.&nbsp; Thus, I am living the good life.&nbsp; So is the poor farmer in Patagonia.&nbsp; So is the seven year old fighter in the Congo--he fulfills the condition--we may&nbsp;not want to say this, we may feel inclined to create an "anti-condition," but there&nbsp;any such&nbsp;condition in this case would be contrived and arbitrary.&nbsp;&nbsp;The good life is achieved also by&nbsp;the screaming woman he is about to murder and rape--her scream and her fear are an expression of her clinging to&nbsp;life--she fulfills the condition.&nbsp; But operating under this definition, we can be satisfied that everyone has the good life, and thus, we can be content leaving the way the world is, with everybody leading their good lives.&nbsp; And while it makes me feel warm inside that my little logical excercise has shown me that everyone is living the good life (except for those people who kill themselves) there is something about this definition that strikes me as wrong, and I'm just going to reject it because I want to.  &nbsp;  But what if the condition is the love(m) of life?&nbsp; Well, then it is clear that some people have, or are at least capable of&nbsp;having the good life.&nbsp; But the professor said, if some people can have the good life, then it is morally right&nbsp;and necessary to say that everyone can have the good life.&nbsp; I have two problems with this.&nbsp; First, while this seems theoretically possible, if by theoretically we mean&nbsp;in a simplistic thought experiment&nbsp;where there is no strife,&nbsp;no pain, unlimited resources, and bland people,&nbsp;this does not seem practically possible by any stretch of the imagination.&nbsp; As much as I would like to say that it is possible, and that it ought to be possible if there was a&nbsp;good and powerful god, the evidence that the world provides me amounting to the billions of individual cases tells me otherwise.&nbsp; And what about the&nbsp;white collar retired suburban with Alzheimer's?&nbsp; The man whose house just burned down with his family inside?&nbsp; The business executive with&nbsp;severe chronic depression--the sort that is a result of a&nbsp;chemical imbalance rather than a chosen attitude?&nbsp;&nbsp;And what about those people whose "good life" causes them to inadvertently hurt other people?&nbsp; What about the white collar suburbanite young American&nbsp;student environmentalists who prevents dams from being built in Brazil,&nbsp;thereby saving the rainforest and leaving&nbsp;tens of thousands&nbsp;of Brazilians without heat, electricity, and&nbsp;jobs (there industries fled the area!).&nbsp; These people were&nbsp;certainly acting with loving intent--and were probably&nbsp;quite&nbsp;happy with themselves and their ability&nbsp;to change the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Although I cannot&nbsp;accept that everyone&nbsp;can have the good life with this definition, I prefer it.&nbsp; If we accept that there are billions of people who do not have the good life, then it motivates us to work hard to change their lives in a way that will facilitate that goal (assuming that is their goal).&nbsp;  &nbsp;  There will always be people who enjoy tragedy and pain, and who find value&nbsp;in being depressed and miserable for a time.&nbsp; There is no love of&nbsp;life when one wants to kill themselves--but the value of having been through that experience is immense,&nbsp;especially&nbsp;for one who&nbsp;is interested in the human experience.&nbsp; Pain and suffering add a richness to the human experience that would make life seem much more bland if we lost it.&nbsp; I am not advocating for the creation of pain and suffering, nor denouncing efforts to reduce it--there will be plenty of it despite our best efforts--the good life for everyone will never be,&nbsp;it cannot be, and I for one am&nbsp;at once&nbsp;heroically unsatisfied and devilishly pleased with that&nbsp;conclusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

						   Four years in the Marines gave me something that is ironically being taken away by school--and that is an open and free mind--thoughts that are constantly creative, born solely of my own mind, having been influenced by outside sources by the smallest and most insignificant of levels.  It is ironic because a military life--especially one in the Marine Corps infantry, is stereotyped as one without freedom of thought--as a place that brain washes and indoctrinates its subjects so that they are nearly mindless automatons.  I admit that in some aspects, I was very similar to others.  In some ways, I looked alike, behaved alike, talked alike, and even thought alike many of the Marines around me.  But the Corps only needs you to conform in some ways, and in others, I needed to break free.  When it came to thinking about the only philosophical text I was familiar with--the first book of Plato's Republic--when it came to thinking about its subject--the various understandings of Justice--I was on my own.  When it came to freedom, metaphysics, ethics, knowledge, God, group thinking, feminism, Descartes's Cogito, the self, the soul, fate, foreign policy--I was on my own, and I did think about them in such a way that was driven only by the Socratic and Cartesian methods of questioning and doubting everything.  The University, where my mind was supposed to be set free, burdened me with knowledge, and now, when I am asked, "what is good?" "what is happiness?" "what is love?" my mind instinctively follows the reasoning and explanations offered by Plato, Aristotle, Mill, Kierkegaard, Kant, Nietzsche, etc., and I do not go through the effort of discovering an answer for myself.  I do not necessarily care if it is any different than those that preceded me (although that would be nice), but I would like my answer to have been discovered because I discovered it by my own creative thinking.  My mind is caged and shackled by this knowledge--by this education.  Naively, if you would have asked me a few days ago if I had a free and open mind, I probably would have said something like "I feel as though I do, but I certainly have biases and habits that I am not quite aware of," or on another day, I may have simply said, or at least thought because the truth sounded unbelievable and ridiculous, that yes, I do have a free and open mind.  The caged animal often forgets what it is to be free, or that it is valuable.  Monday night, I felt the cage and escaped for a few hours.  After more reading and eight hours of classes, I am back in, but I can at least remember that there is a freedom that is somehow beyond my grasp, and I have made my cell just a little bit bigger--allowing for just a little more freedom.
