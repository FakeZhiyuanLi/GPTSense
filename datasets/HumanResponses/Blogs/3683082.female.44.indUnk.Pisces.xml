      Hi all,  had to reqroup after the weekend of Drama I had,  OMG you will not believe this but here goes anyways.  Plans for the lake.....go out friday evening and set up camp.....take out the jetski, tube, food, and lets not forget the smores..........fun in the sun!!woohoo this ol gal ain't got to work the weekends no more......happy dance for me... Brittany and Chrissy (bio kids...hehehe) packed up as i did have to work till 6pm..they also did the shopping for food and other needed items....did a great job with toiletries, pillows, towels, clothes, ect....momma trained them well.....Come home friday evening all excited only to met at the door with drama from foster child  (we will call baby) as she is the youngest and for the most part acts like a baby....she don't want to go.....well hmmmmmmmmmmm  new boyfriend in the picture...hubby has to work saturday and other foster daughter has to work as well.....nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnoooooooooo not a good idea......I state  "you are going, end of story"  piss mode starts.  Little verbal attacks towards everyone.  The last one at me....something in the nature of "Everyone has sticks shoved up their asses" i believe is the comment she made to me while standing in my bedroom.  now i am not one to deal with disrespect too well...at first i asked her to leave my room....when i got the, Who Me? look i realized a lil physical persuasion was in order, swung her around and lifted her up two stairs by the seat of her pants....and a very firm OUT OF MY ROOM NOW!!  she has a brian and at that point decided to use it......up the stairs and backed off for a bit..... now before leaving my big ol love bug dog snuggles up to her for attention (he was a rescue dog from humane society, chessapeekbay retriever who was beat for a yr and 1/2 by previous owner) she lashes out and hits him on the head several times.....needless to say....momma is not happy. She did live through the evening...we got to lake...she assisted with setting up camp and all seemed calm. SATURDAY F**k why did i even get out of bed?  that was a question i kept asking myself.....but i did so now i deal with it....my oldest daughter came out and was very excited about spending the weekend with her and also with the other girls....breakfast came....baby ate, took meds., back in tent to lay down....ok....lunch came, baby up, ate lunch, complained of a headache.....back to tent to lay down...ok now this is where it begins......she realizes we are not putting jetski in water as day was too cool..we all decided to just enjoy each other and visit....piss mode starts again....trying to visit with  my girls and she is in tent.......MMMMMMMMMOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM.....whinning like a two yr old....yes baby what do you need....i have a headache....i know baby...what do u want me to do about it .......crying some more and whinning in between.....i go sit back down....then she starts in with the other girls...they leave to go shower....she comes out of tent to start in on me about how everyone is mean to her and treat her like shit....ok baby....how do they do that....what did they do to you???? well no comment.....then Brittany is perfect she does no wrong...u just don't see it...on and on....Now this is comming from a kid that is dying from a headache...but we feel well enough to get up out of our death bed in the tent to B*tch about Brittany...(HMMMMMM think this is a personal attack against Moi?)  yep that is pretty much how i was looking at it....go figure... well Chrissy and I both tell her enough.....go back to your tent and lay down.... Then of course we were chatting with park ranger on the road side.....she decides to crawl to the door of the tent.....hang out and pukes right outside the door....oh no it gets better....she then sprawls herself half in and half out the door......Yep you got it...just laying there.....Park Ranger looks over and asks....IS SHE OK?  I state oh yes......for now anyways!!!!! by 7:30pm  about 8 hrs of this crap and her whinning every five mins....i load her up and take her back to town.......to the hubby to deal with her shit cause i had had enough.....drowning her was sounding really good about now.....she worked herself up that she made herself physically ill and then wanted to be babied for it....sorry not going to happen.  Now i don't know about you all but if i felt that ill......i would have climbed in bed and called it good....oh no she goes straight to the bathroom and takes a bubble bath......of course i got to listen to her puke all the way home in a bag and first thing out of her mouth was can i have some IBprofen......ummmmmmm no!!!  first thing out her mouth is why is everyone treating me like shit....the fact that she had been throwing up including as we pulled into the driveway never crossed her mind......  Weekend not a total loss.....Sunday and no BABY!!!!!  we got up, made a huge breakfast, ate like pigs, cleaned up and put the ski in the water......now you all don't know me but The Wife does....that is my escape from everything.....it helps blow the cobwebs out of the ol brian and at 67mph on the water it will clear out any other un-needed items up there as well....lmao I think it is because i am part fish that i love the water and jetskiing so much.....or maybe it is because i like submarines roflmao.....ask The Wife.....that's another chapter in our book......  well then the clouds roll in and wham ....lightening....ski out of water......time to tear down camp...GIRLS KICK ASS!!!!   30mins two tents down everything packed in van ......get in Van.....RAIN RAIN RAIN all the way back to town....lmoa  Pull up to unload....here comes BABY ....hi mom....yadda yadda yadda.....nothing ever happened!    not likely.....so i calmly told her...get your sleeping bag....go back in the house.....and stay out of my way for awhile....3 hours later we sat down for a big pow wow....she is on her last leg in this house which really upsets me as i have tried very hard with this little girl to keep her here.  thanks for listening to me vent......  now on to a lighter note.....rof....new employment is making me take all these classes before i start work....two weeks worth as a matter of fact....tommorrow is cooking class......yep that's me ...can't boil water...rof...but today there was me, another woman my age, a twenty year old...she was very cute wearing a low cut top and her lil tummy showing with her jogging pants rolled down on her hips......all the while our 50yr old instructor is peeking down her shirt and checking out the ass...now i as a mother felt i should say something to the girl so she could maybe adjust some of her clothing so as not to be so accessible to his peep show.....so i told her...she was so embarrassed and all she could say was GROSS roflmao....i guess she thought that the peep show should only be reserved for guys her age...........roflmao.....ok now that is real life!!! Right Folks??   ok now that i have proven i am not dead.....nor is the child i so desperately wanted to drowned this weekend...hehehe....i will close for now.....take care and God Bless

      Day to day is how i live my life.....the past can't be changed but can be repeated if you are not careful and the future is uncertain, so day to day works for me....lol  If i make it through the day and haven't pissed somebody off or abused one of the children, or better yet killed the hubby, then i guess i did something right.  Today was one of those days,  relatively calm and went according to plan...of course i don't think i really had a  plan...it just happen to be a good day.  Woohoo for me!!    4th day on my new job....7hrs of  medication class......oh my god...i am learning how to pass meds. and documenting them....oh what will i do...roflmao only been doing it for years and years now...lol new company......gotta take their classes.....it all goes hand in hand...passed class with a 99% so i guess i did ok...hehe..the one that i missed ....hell write me up on a medication error....lol  I have written about my best friend that lives in Iowa, that ran off and abondoned my sorry ass down here lost to deal with everyday shit on my own...of course no hard feelings or anything 0:) oooopppsss my halo slipped......lmao you know i love ya girl....anyways she linked me to her blog...and i am not sure about spilling my guts to a bunch of strangers but i guess she thinks its ok...(who the hell pays her to think anyways??) rof  i have a lil story to tell ya all that know her and may come here via her links!!! (EG)  her name is julie AKA the Wife.....i thought i would share the story of her title with ya all. Here goes Wife!!!!hehehe We became friends through work...for several months we just assosiated through work and only work...when she quit the job...i suppose we missed each others company so we started talking on the phone, and visiting each others houses...ALOT...i don't think a day went by that phone or visual of some sort didn't go on...and then there was also the puter in there as well...after about i would say a year or so....right wife??  my husband started referring to her as my wife....hey your wife called.....oh ur wife stopped by...and so on....so the more i thought about it i realized he was right  ..SHE DON'T COOK...SHE DON'T CLEAN....AND SHE DON'T PUT OUT....SO SHE MUST BE THE WIFE!!! and that is the story behind her title as THE WIFE!!  I have to say she has worn that title proudly...lmao   She was my partener in crime...we had alot of good times together and i do miss her dearly...but most importantly she is my Heart and always will be!!

      hey whoever......I was throughly impressed today and have to share what about....I left my job of nine yrs to start a new so to speak and I started Monday and so far so good.  The part of being impressed though comes from my old job so here goes.  I not only left a job of nine yrs but a family, three beautiful clients that I love dearly and are a big part of my heart as well as my life.  They all have extremely long and beautiful hair which I absolutely adore.  When people meet them they comment on thier beautiful hair not thier afflictions, which means alot to them as well as me.  All three ladies are in wheelchairs, partially paralyzed, with Cerebral palsey or head injury, so anything to make them stand out positive is a great thing. Everyone of the other clients have short institution style hair so this helps them to stand apart.  Anyways the staff that work there have for several yrs tried to get it cut off and of course I fought like hell to not allow this to happen just to make things easier for staff.  As clients relayed to me that they wanted to keep thier long hair....Well, today they had a house mtg...which is with all the staff from the house, site manager, service coordinator, program coordinator (which use to be my title) and nursing.  House staff started in about getting the hair cut...i was told that the discussion last almost 45 mins. about getting the hair cut and that is what the clients wanted.  Well considering two of the clients are non verbal..........hmmmmmmmmmm what cha think....lol the site manager held her ground and told them that the women looked great, the hair was awesome and beautiful, as well as the times that she had seen this issue addressed it was not agreed upon by clients that this is what they wanted.  that it was staff trying to manipulate clients into complying against thier better judgement.  END OF STORY    You go Debbie.....my hat comes off to you lady.....Hell i even called her today and told her thank you for standing up for my girls rights.....I left my job but i will never leave my girls..... As a matter of fact i am taking on guardianship and payee for one of them, and then i already have power of attorney over one of them now...i think they maybe stuck with me for life......hehehe  Life is a bit emotional for me right now....a new job is fine....no scare tactics for me...hell i think i am fearless.....but these ladies mean so much to me and not being there daily to protect them just makes my heart ache like nothing i have ever felt before...my guardian angels will have to help me look after them.....  I lost my mother in October of 2001,  i sit here at my computer with a pic of her on my desk.  I sure do miss her,  before she got sick she was alot of fun to hang out with and visit with.  We use to go alot together, out to eat, shop, trips, drives, fishing, or just laying in her bed together visiting (i think i miss that the most).  She would share stories about when she was a little girl some funny, some sad.  She grew up in an orphanage, hard life for a child.  I just couldn't imagine how that felt.  I know that we shed alot of tears together over her life and the sadness that was in it.  She was also very close to my two girls...Actually she was the only grandmother my two girls had....i know mom.....MAMMA is her title.....they miss her as much as i do...they spent several hours with her....you see i never had a sitter....hell i had MAMMA...that was much better...Cuz you see,,,,in thier eyes she was the Bomb...and of course they could do no wrong....lol  I still have my Dad....and yes i am daddy's lil girl....not to mention his only girl...he is 72yrs old...his health is fair, but i still get scared when i think about the possiblity of loosing him.  Dear God help us all, cuz this daddy's girl will loose it to the extreme.  We have become very very close since my moms' passing.  I think we cling to each other for fear of loosing the other.  Not a day goes by without us talking on the phone, even if just for a min.  It is as if we have to hear the others voice to just keep each other going.  Does that make since?  Probably not, but it works for us i guess.  well i guess that is enough babbling for one day ....take care and god bless

      Well Hello All,      Yes I am back, today I started my new job and I am sure that not many people care, but I thought I would share it anyways.  It was really interesting and everyone was happy to see me as well as pleasant.  That is something I haven't experienced in sometime with my last job of nine yrs. so needless to say it was great.  My job tasks are going to be pretty much the same just on a smaller (much smaller) scale.  That ol stress meter just keeps going down. ;)  Basically I was in orientation and classes today, but what was really cool was that I got two breaks as well as a lunch break woohoo!!! after nine years of none of those that was a treat in itself...hell I even have a company that allows you to go smoke a cig.  if I want to and they don't make you feel like a second class citizen for it.  now that is a treat in itself..hehe  I start tommorrow with OJT and I am looking forward to meeting the clients that I will be working with.       I told my best friend that moved out of state that I started a blog.  I am in kansas and she is in Iowa, anyways she wanted my addy, but she has been at this since January and I am such a newbie...don't think I want her laughing at my ignorance.....I just needed a place to vent, no one cares and no one will read this so it is just a place for me to ramble on and vent when I need to, that way I don't have to bother anyone else.  I haven't figured out how to change my blogskin, or add a message board or a counter or shit nothing...it took me twenty mins. to figure out how to get back to here to post again.  lol       My girls are doing fine and I was met at the door by one who just got her first paycheck from her new job and she just had to go to Mall to buy these special shoes she wanted for $60.00...only problem is we went to a few other stores first, she purchased a pair of must have jeans and wooopsss not enough greens for the shoes, so we settled for $30.00 pair instead roflmao....I was the good mom, I bought my babygirl a new outfit just because I depend on her so much to help me with appointments and getting other kids to work ect.  She is a god send to say the least and I don't know what I would do without her.  But she graduates High School half way through the school yr. this fall and then she is off to college so I guess I will find out then just what I am going to do. She is spoiled rotten but I have to admit it is not in a bad way, she is respectful and alot of fun to be around.  She loves her mommy and tells me all the time....especially when she is walking out the door with mommys cell phone as she goes out in her cute lil car that mommy is paying for and (I might add am not allowed to smoke in)  wearing her lil short skirts and looking like quite the girlie girl.  oh no she is out on the porch saying goodbye to her ex boyfriend who is moving to Tenn. with his new girlfriend....now mind you this was my daughters first love and she is happy they are leaving so all the drama stops but she is going to miss him also...he is a good kid just got involved with the wrong people.  hopefully someday he will see that before he gets in too deep..       Hubby keeps coming up here and growling at me for not spending any time with him.....lol oh well shit happens.  I guess I could go down and watch that mind numbing TV with him but naaaaaaaaawwww I think I will pass...lol       Well enough for now.......me needs to shower and get ready for work in the AM ....take care and god bless

      Hello all,      This is my first entry of my first blog.  Not really sure why I have chosen to do this, other then I have enjoyed reading others blogs and thought that maybe, just maybe I remind you, I may have something important to say or share as well.  Maybe I could put a smile on someone's face or make them laugh at my crazy life as many have me.  Life can be so complicated at times, it is important that we all have an out or release.  Someplace to go vent, yell, scream, or cry if needed and it's all ok.  Maybe that is why I am doing this, this may be my release when need be. Hell maybe I am just nuts and no one else will even read this and I will be talking to myself.  Oh well I guess it really doesn't matter one way or the other as long as I don't hurt anyone while I do it right?        I thought maybe I should share something about myself, so as to let everyone know that I am not an alien. lol  I am the mother of two beautiful biological girls, ages 16 and 22 yrs old, and I am also a foster mother of three other beautiful teen girls that live with me at this time.  I am in the process of installing a new webcam and as soon as I get this task accomplished I will post some pics of my little beauties.  I love children and relate well with them, not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing.  I guess it is a matter of how you choose to look at it. lol       I am also an animal lover,  I have a 20# cat named Moses, a slim white terror of a cat named Casper, a chessapeekbay retriever named Buster who is a gentle giant and a momma's boy, just added a lil guy 9wk old cocker spaniel named Sebastian who is a Buster's boy, an adorable lil ferret named Nala who steals everything including your heart, two snakes sampson and mondonna (burmese pythons) and fish.  That is all at this time and quite the full house I might add.       I am also a working mom on top of all this, (like I don't have enough going on right?) I just resigned from my previous job of nine years, last day being wednesday, and start a new job on Monday. Same type of work just a different company with better benefits and little less stress factor involved.  Hooray for me!!!!  I do home health care with mentally and physically handicapped adults. DO I HAVE LIKE CAREGIVER WRITTEN ALL OVER ME OR WHAT PRAY TELL!!!!!!       I am 44yrs old, blonde, busty, and very opinionated.  For the most part I say what's on my mind and honesty plays a big role in my life.  I don't lie to people and hate it when I am lied to.  Friendships are special to me as I have alot of acquaintances, but I am very picky about close friends.  Letting people into the real me is quite disarming to me so I am very careful about choosing friends.  As of right now you might say that I am on the Outside looking in as far as the friend department goes.  Not sure what I mean by that?  Well let me try to explain, My best friend up and moved out of state, which in turn left me totally lost.  When I was happy, sad, mad, or whatever she was the one I called on and could always count on.  Well now that she has moved she has a new life, new home, new friends, don't get me wrong I know she still cares about me, but she has so much going on in her life that I hate to burden her with my crap.  Then there are two others here and for the last 5 years we talked and hung out all the time, well the two of them had a oh shall we say parting of the ways which left me kind of in the middle. now I didn't take sides and remained true to both of them, I called and stop by to check on them and see if all was ok, well a couple of months ago I noticed something, it was all one sided, my side, I seemed to be the only one who made an effort.  So I stopped calling, stopped it all and as I thought, Nothing at all, no calls, nothing. So needless to say here I am on the outside looking in as far as friendship department goes.  It's lonely at times but at least I know where I stand.       Married??? Now that is a loaded question.  yes the last time I checked there was a man still in the recliner watching TV and occassionally he comes through the house and grunts something at me.  So yes, I am married.  woohoo for me!! I think we have lost each other along the way as so many people do with children, jobs, life, ect....and we are no acceptions.  I am not going to get on this blog to blow smoke up you ass about how perfect my life or marriage for that matter is.  It's not, that is why it is called life and not fantasy.         I will close for now and maybe share some more with you later
