      I've always lived my life following all standard norms so as I would not be hated by people. I've toiled and worked so hard to just be normal and accepted by society even to the point that I reaped awards in the process! But I thought having them all was enough and good enough to make me happy. But naah I was never happy instead this only ushered  another life for me and that's what I call...living a life of FANTASY!

      amongst the many who toil and dream...  i am but one of them so it seems  yet why am i persecuted and rejected..  is it because social norms i have not perfected?   where is thine divine grace that thou art should shine upon  the lowly servant....   who am i to say what is right or wrong..  but who are they break my heart's song  left unminded and unwanted  amidst the darkness hate has grounded..   where is my redemption?..   looking around and there i see  hatred and disgust given to me  my slow near-dying torch seems to be at its last..  as my drive to go on is ceasing fast   where is my light...   whispers of silence like waves clashing  upon a bold mountain  is what fate has given to me...  whispers of silence all around... unknowing society's verdict..  woe is me.. for i may never know...  the whispers of silence will forever live on.. today.. tomorrow and for the rest of eternity..

      my dark secrets to you i've told... your reactions were expected and like prophecies, it's been foretold.  the vague future... the dramatic present and the shameful past words being described were deep and vast  my love towards you i confidently sang... but just like a pigeon... i was killed with one bang!  don't worry... don't fret i haven't lost nor won in any bet...  The song... the ever so lovely song i sang to you... the song that you muted and then turned me blue...  this isn't unfamiliar... this isn't new but why so much heartache?... why of all people it's you?  i love you... really i do i want to accept it... but it's hard to say adieu  if only i am given one more chance... the chance, to see myself with you dance  it may seem vague... it may seem blurry but love takes time to grow... i am in no hurry  i so wanted to show you everything... the world's greatest love songs to you, i'd sing   i know you're not blind and you can see clearly... the beast that i am... but alas! my heart you didn't see  although you say everything is and will be okay... I say i am and i will... But what you don't know, i'm a wilting rose in a rotting boquet.  my unending love towards you couldn't be reciprocted... well that's just funny... like a blind-deaf-mute trying to be educated.  a friend is all that you want from me... it seems fine, but the love i feel is still caged... unable to flee  yes i didn't actually lose all... you said i'm your bestfriend... yes it's okay... but as i said, my true feelings is inside me... it will never end.  i love you yesterday, today and tomorrow... my broken, bruised, bleeding, rejected heart is draped in satins of pain and silks of eternal sorrow.  don't worry my bestfriend... this rejected heart sheltered by now brittle ribs, by myself, i'll try to mend  ...for you weren't the first and you won't be the last... I will always be a staple actor in the rejected cast

      time has come for this wilted rose...  toiled and suffered yet never arose...   who would've thought this fighter would quit?  but hey... i gave it to the last drop every fuckin' bit...   i'm sorry to leave... im sorry to go...  but what my future is to be, i do not know...   i loved the world, yet it did not love back...  i guess i came out short... i did with so much lack...   a bright future they said. yet i do not see  the future that you people saw in me.   you thought i was happy...  you thought i was glad...  well sorry, wake up... my life has gone bad...   you all say im your friend that you'd be there till the end..  well... the end is near for me....  when my funeral is?... we'll just have to see...   I have a few more strings to pull... but I swear i'm not looking back...   round and round he goes.... where he stops? nobody knows....  twisted... broken... used... unspoken...   nothing seems to come out of your filthy mouths... "you're so good... you're so kind"... do you honestly think it amounts?   enough with the bullshit enough with the games...  i swear when i'm dying i'm taking up names.....  i will never forget you...  i will never fuckin' lose.....  the oh so-called sweet memories you all gave and i choose..   goodbye to all... and may He bless you bountifully...  this is the end... of the ever so helpless...

      Being betrayed is the worst thing one can experience... especially if the person who gets to betray you is the person who you love and trust the most.   I have been betrayed a lot of times my life... who doesn't? When I get betrayed I just shrug my shoulder and say to myself "so?"... and don't give a rat's ass about it... but recently, I really got affected cause the person who got to betray me was my best friend. Man it stung like shit! and really scarred me... but I can overlook that one for I love him so much... regardless of how many times he gets to lie, betray, or maybe, take advantage of me... I can and will forgive him cause I know that he doesn't mean it and he is aware of what he's done.   We all have our own quirks.. our own shortcomings... even the perfect person that you think is, can have their own flaws. But it is not with their flaws that we get to weigh their value to us, but how they help you grow... make you happy... make you appreciate everything in life. SO therefore, I love my best friend... my soul best friend no matter what.

      Having a best friend is one of the most beautiful thing that life can give you. A best friend is very different from any ordinary friend.   Believe me, my best friend is my reason... The reason why I look forward to each new day just to be able to text him or call him and hear his voice. The reaso why I try my best to be a good person. The reason why I get to appreciate life more cause he makes life more beautiful. The reason for everything good that has came to me.   June 17, 2004... around 11:30AM... I am beginning to lose my reason. He is slipping away from me...fading away...  all of this happening because of one fuckin' fruit that has entered into our once-perfect life. Paul Carreon... a name which I despise so much. His face, his name, his total existance I truly despised...   Aaron Garcia, my best friend, befriended this Paul moron and I explained to him that Paul is really a threat to my part. I hate my best friend... my bes for overlooking my insecurity for I really thought he cared for my feeling. But it seems he doesn't... It's ok though... as from what he has mentioned, we both have different concepts when it comes to 'bestfriendship'...   I have never been hurt by someone I love so much my entire life... I mean, I didn't mean to restrict him form having new friends... it's just that with this Paul Carreon Shit that I am most insecure about. I know I am better than him... I am richer than him, smarter than him, more articulate than him... basically I am fuckin' better than that loser!... but my concern here is... no matter how rich, smart or whatever I am, I am a no one if I lose my best friend... my soul best friend. As I said, he is my reason that I get to exist longer in this fucked up world... We both have different principles.. different beliefs... I thought I could learn from him... but he indeed is fading away from me and I can't stop him...  He fuckin' promised me he would only text Paul which wasn't OK for me at first but got to understand it and I was OK... but he really betrayed me... insulted me even when he went out to dinner with him and never even got to tell me... I even forced him to spit it out which was worse!... and then it happened again, they went out for coffee! Shit! I have just forgiven him and now he's doing this and I even got to find this one out by myself... he really didn't have any plans to tell me. That sonuvabitch! They both fuckin' deserve each other. I so hate them both... but I am willing to forgive my bes... but, will this happen again? Will I get to be hurt again? Is he trying to make me immune...get used to the pain? This will really be a persisting thing in our friendship... From that day on, I don't trust him anymore neither does he...   Friendship...what a terrible thing to waste... I really expected that we would grow... but we just destroyed one another... What has transpired makes me question... Di I have the wrong reason? Would it be mean of me if I question the credibility of our friendship?... I think not... I have been very good (I tried my best) and always gave in... yes, he does his fair share... but what we give out to one another doesn't seem enough for the both of us... He is my soul best friend... is he really?...   I am lost... without a cause.. without a reason... now, the skies aren't as blue... the grass not as green... and my outlook towards life is now jaded and cynical.     I saw you with a bright light behind you I thought to myself, you are the one you are my reason but you turned your back and your shadow faded away it sank into the darkness lost, and never to be found again now life is meaningless life is so full of pain now like thousands of jagged rocks  being stabbed into my fragile self goodbye my friend my best friend my soul best friend you occupied the empty space in my heart and you always will even if your gone... your shape takes that blank space goodbye i love you so much  ... but please, ask me to stay... give me a reason to stay....

      He's my best friend. The best one I ever had... as a matter of fact, he's my soul best friend. It's kinda' like a soul mate but just best friends. Anyway, I met him thru work and right then and there, I knew he was very different. Not in a way that would remind you of Marilyn Manson or Ozzy Osbourne... but just different. It's weird really, cause he's the complete opposite of who and what I am (in some things though *wink*)... He's my constant chillout buddy, text buddy, phone buddy, movie buddy... in all things. Anyway, you can check some of our phots of us just foolin' around and doin' what we do best... HAVE FUN! :D *BIG HUG TO MY BES*

      Life indeed is more rewarding if you find it's purpose?... What is life's meaning? What should we be doing with our lives? Where will I be 5,6,7 years from now on in this lifetime?... All of this question truly can be answered by our own choice...   Life without a purpose?... that's such a sad thing... We should be setting our own goals right? Where's the fun in life if you don't have any destination to reach? no goal to achieve?... Set some goals...set them high! Believe me, the fruits of your labor during your journey would indeed be a sweet one! Good Luck! :D

      Shit! the overnight stay at Shangrila was what I just needed! It was sooo much fun. It started around 10-ish Sturday morning (6/26/2004)... My colleagues and I rendezvoused in Sykes' bulding for the shuttle to arrive... I was like fuckin' excited... anxiety attack here and there!  We arrived at the Shang and checked in. Got a room, settled in and even had a 30-ish minutes dip on the bath tub just relaxed and thought about things to do in my stay there. In the afternoon, I played volleyball with my colleagues and damn! was that fun! my hands were sore in the end though but it was well worth it. had dinner and chit-chatted with my friends... after eatin' we freshened up and then headed for Coco Loco (a club in the Shang) and had a karaoke-helluva-good-time!!! Sharon, Love, Jayson, Peggy, Paul, Bryan, Jonas, CJ and I sang to our heart's content!!! afterwards, we (Sharon, Glauce, Paul etc) got wasted and drank vodka before headin' to the dance floor where we grinded and gyrated so hard that we give the sex bomb dancers a bad name! :D... at around 2 AM-ish next day, we got so tired that our muscles were so sore... we ended going back to our rooms, had another dip on the tub (with bubbles) and then slept!...  That morning was like living hell cause I had a major hang-ober from that friggin' VODKA! Damn! I swear! never will I drink liquor AGAIN!!!...  we had our breakfast then swam at the beach and then the pool.... then checked out at 11:00...   it was so fun yet so tiring... I wouldn't mind doin' it again... but hey! next week, Bantayan Island, here we come!!! :D

      It may sound strange, but one of the most positive things one can do is to say "No" when necessary. The ability to say "No" is directly proportional to your confidence in yourself and your belief in what you are doing.   You must be able to say "No" in order to stay focused. There are too many distractions that come along, too many people vying for your time. If you don't learn to say "No", you get spread too thin. Of course you don't want to miss any big opportunities, but neither can you be all things to all people.   You can have anything you want, but you can't have everything you want. You can't be a doctor and a lawyer and a scientist and an engineer and an airline pilot. You have to make choices, and that means saying "yes" to some things and "no" to others.   A sincere, honest "No" shows that you have the courage of your convictions, and that you are committed to staying on track. And what's so hard about it, anyway? It's just a word. Learn to say it, politely and firmly (No, thank you), with compassion and conviction, and you'll take control of your own destiny.  Funny really, how a two-letter word can be one of the most poerwful words that could come out of your mouth. (",)

      When I stand up for myself and my beliefs, they call me a bitch.   When I stand up for those I love,  they call me a bitch.   When I speak my mind, think my own thoughts, or do things my own way,  they call me a bitch.   Being a bitch means I won't compromise what's in my heart.  It means I live my life MY way.  It means I won't allow anyone to step on me.   When I refuse to tolerate injustice and speak against it,  I am defined as a bitch.   The same thing happens when I take time for myself instead of being everyone's slave. It means I have the courage and strength to allow myself to be who I truly am and won't become anyone else's idea of what they think I "should" be.   I am outspoken, opinionated, and determined.  I want what I want and there is nothing wrong with that!   So try to stomp on me, try to douse my inner flame, try to squash every ounce of beauty I hold within me.  You won't succeed.   And if that makes me a bitch, so be it.   I embrace the title and am proud to bear it !!!!

      If I should not wake up tomorrow I wanted to tell you "I’m sorry" I’m sorry if I was selfish If I wanted you just for myself I’m sorry if I demanded too much If sometimes I was hard to live with  I’msorry if I did not try to understand you If I was too headstrong and stubborn at times... I was onlyhuman… And so were you  But I have no regrets in knowing you Spending time with you was always a pleasure And looking back I see that they are indeed some of the best days of my life  And I thank you for giving me those days For making me laugh though I wanted to cry For making me laugh at myself and the whole world  The first few days we quarreled The pain was intense And I hated you for giving me pain  Now I see that you gave me pain so I can move on It didn’t work out for us  But that’s no reason why we can’t be friends You toldme you were still my best friend And I know that I will be yours I’m proud of you and happy for you  Your friends are great They love you And I love youtoo  In time I have learned that the best way to show your love is to let go So I am setting you free Go and run wild like the free spirit that you are A butterfly is beautiful only when it is dancing on the dewdrops But withers and dies when caught by the hand I will always treasure our friendship I will keep it close to my heart But know that I’m always here when you need me  TIME HEALS ALL WOUNDS AND I KNOW THAT THIS TOO WILL PASS...
