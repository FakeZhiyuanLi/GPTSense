      I don't think I can overestimate the value in crayons.  It takes you right back to the womb, ya?  Because everyone colors in utero.  Anyway, I was pretty stressed the other day, so I grabbed my red crayon box (which proudly proclaim "Almost evry color") and made some pictures.  What did I make, you ask?  I made flags for L's country and Craig's country.  Everyone has their own country, so why not make a flag for it?

      When I was a kid, I used to have a big party at the end of school, and gleefully tear up all my paperwork from the year.  It was gloriously cathartic, and had a happy ending all at the same time.  In fact, some of my friends would come over, and we could rip up *each other's papers*.  Amazing.  Now, I'm sifting through about ten times as many assignments and notes, and rather than ripping up the ones I don't need anymore, I'm selling them.  Not as cathartic, but it works.

      When there's no school, each study day just kind of blends into the next... I don't know how all those "non-class-goers" managed to keep from going insane!  It's sort of like "Space madness" from Ren & Stimpy.  I just might eat the soap...  Here's a joke you'll only get if you're a med student who games (oh wait, Jason and I are the only med students who game):  How do you know if a med student games?  She has a d6 that she's spinning around to try to figure out if the numbers correspond to the chambers of the heart (in filling order, and order in space).  I did this for 15 minutes before giving up, because the heart isn't shaped like a d6.  Maybe I can try a d8!

      Well, this is my first blog post.  Not that I'm a private person or *afraid* of blogs or anything... Let's just say I've spoken with my muse, and the stars are in a flush, high Queen.  I'm a med student.  A very almost done second year who's hiding from big nasty books right now.  This seems like as good a place to retreat as any.

      Today is my last day of summer vacation!  Waaaaaa!  And I have a dentist appointment at 9.  I hate that, but I'd rather get it over with than try to schedule it during the first month of my surgery rotation.  I'm definitely nervous, scared, jittery, and any other words you can think up for "Hell's no, me's don wanna go" to school.  This is going to be a whole new ball game for me.  As a perfectionist, I love excelling at everything I do.  But starting new things is a bitch.  I hate being a pawn (like I told Cassie: "I'm going to be the only pawn on the chessboard who insists on moving like a knight"), and I hate not knowing what's going on.  I'm afraid I'm going to lose all sense of perspective locked in the hospital for days on end.  What am I going to do today?  Probably play a lot of FFXI.

      For some reason, I managed to sign in as "L Jensen" and couldn't, for the life of me, figure out why I couldn't post to my blog.  "I'm L Jensen" I thought.  And "I'm the Lusty Lizzard".  Wow, my first DID experience.  Well, maybe I've had DID (Dissociative ID disorder--the fancy way of saying "Multiple Personality Disorder") before, but it's never been this confusing.  I am again in the process of updating my website.  Having pictures on multiple servers is a bitch.  I'm transferring everything big to Craig's account to simplify things.  Also news is that I've started playing Final Fantasy XI, my first online game.  It is every bit as addictive as any other bit of net-crack, and Craig and I are already chomping at the bit to play.  We can't play simultaneously, and logging in and out is an ordeal.  Jen, if you've got any time to kill, this is a rather amusing way of doing it.  Not sure if you'd like it, but it's definitely interesting.  Amber, you and Nick will love it, and probably fight each other to play--expensive though, if you don't already have the PS2 hard drive.  I'm Yunie, a Hume in Bastok on the Ramuh server if you ever get there :)

      No more boards!  Now I'm on vacation, and trying desperately to relax.  I had a great time with Jen (yes, famous Jen of blog-dom) at lunch on Tuesday.  Then I came to Ann Arbor and had fun with my friends (including Amber, who also needs to update her blog :) All in all, it's been a nice trip, and I hope it doesn't get too stressful when I try to contact the "fake family" and let them know I'm on to them...  That is, trying to figure out how to tactfully let them know I'm not really related to them.  Also wondering if I should try to make progress on the "real family" front.  Always a mess...  But for now, relax! Get ready for the trip back to Detroit!

      Okay, this is mostly yesterday's rant, but I was too depressed yesterday to do much of anything.  I hate feeling useless!  I hate collapsing and crying, and feeling useless!  Studying for the last two weeks has been driving me crazy.  I've been "stealing" moments for myself.  I shouldn't have to steal moments to take a break!  I've been working 10-12 hours a day, and I still don't feel ready for this ridiculous test.  Yesterday was the straw that broke my back.  I woke up at 6am to take a practice test, and I did horrible.  Then I beat myself up.  Perfectionism is not for the weak-of-stomach.  Another thing is that I feel that I'm putting off everything.  I hate procrastinating, because it makes me *way* more stressed.  I like getting things done.  I hate having to tell myself, over and over and over, "This needs to wait until after the boards"  or "I can't think about this right now".  Do you know there are three separate defense mechanisms that involve putting off thought?  It's ridiculous.  I need to vent NOW.  I need to get it out NOW.    What am I putting off?  Well, the dad situation is around #1.  The fake dad situation is #2 (figuring out how to tell him and his mother that I'm not really a part of their family, but I really want to continue having a grandmother, just not a retarded father).  Getting a new shrink is #3.  Investing the emotional time and energy into finding a reasonable person who won't abandon me and who can deal with my special needs.  My last shrink's husband died, so she flaked out and basically abandoned me (the shrinks out there are probably nodding to themselves, full aware of "my special needs").  Jenny, maybe you can be a shrink...  So then I was ridiculous to Craig, drove him away, and convinced myself he didn't love me anymore.  The great thing about Craig is that he only stayed away for a little while, and then we went to wal mart.  Good husband.  Then we had a water fight outside in the backyard, because I've apparently needed to regress for the last month.  Wet and happy, I sat on the furniture to watch Star Wars Episode 4.  And ate lots of sugar free chocolate.  My cataracts will be arriving anytime now...  Yumm....sorbitol.

      Wow, I spend three days away from my blog, and there's a lot going on!  And I've been inspired to leave little pieces of blog all over the place!    Maybe I'm just nervous about my exam today.  In less than 2 hours, I'm going to be practice clicking my way through 350 multiple choice questions.  Not much creativity there.  My right brain is getting its last hurrah before succumbing to overviewing information and looking at diagrams.  My left brain is dead.  2+2 = my kidneys don't work anymore.

      Urgle...  I haven't been able to sleep for the past two nights.  Two things emerge:  1) There is absolutely nothing I can do about the Hartwig situation, and it's driving me insane (insom).  2) I should avoid both caffeine and alcohol, as neither will make anything easier for me.

      Like every national and religious holiday, this afternoonI ate way too much.  I feel ill.  Did I really need a cheeseburger w/ a bun, corn on the cob, pasta salad, lettuce salad w/ thousand island, chips, pretzels, strawberry shortcake, and two non-light beers?  It's not even 6:00 and I've probably got room for something else.  I'm not counting the cold pizza I ate for breakfast.  This has got to stop!    As of Tuesday morning, I shall try YET ANOTHER DIET.  This time it will be the 'Candida diet'--nothing to do with Voltaire, believe me.  The list of acceptable foods is as follows:  --High fiber low starch vegetables such as: broccoli, celery, radish and asparagus. Plenty of fresh steamed veggies: especially onions, garlic, ginger root, cabbage and broccoli. Onions and garlic are very good anti-fungals.  --High protein foods such as: antibiotic free fish, fowl, nuts, seeds and eggs.   10% complex carbohydrate; rice, beans, millet, amaranth, quinoa and buckwheat.   --Fruit: papaya, pineapple, grapefruit and all types of berries. Other acceptable foods are sea foods and sea veggies, olive oil, eggs, mayonnaise, white rice, soy and vegetable pastas, white rice cake and crackers, some citrus fruit, herb teas and unsweetened cranberry juice.  Maybe I'll start tracking my (hopeful) weight loss weekly on this 'blog.  Kate has been doing this diet since December and has shed 15 lbs.

      Even though I have a ton of legal reading to plow through within the next few weeks, I still need to free my mind with a good book.  My apartment has about 1000 cheap paperbacks and some decent hardcovers, but I still keep returning to an old love: "Good Omens."  It's this great novel written by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett all about a supremely awesome Demon named Crowley, an angel, the Antichrist, and the days leading to the end of the world.    The first time I read it was in 9th grade and I was in the process of getting a really horrible spiral perm at the time, so I missed out on some of the nuances in the story.  Getting the skin burned off one's neck is always a distraction.  I stumbled upon in again at a used book store in East Lansing, whilst visiting my sister at State.  Since that time, I've read it about 7 times, and counting.  Even my sister has read it, and she's usually too busy to do anything but work.  She purchased a newer edition because she claims the smell of mass-market paperbacks turns her stomach.

       This is a profile of a guy who winked at me on Match.com, untouched and in all it's glory.  Along with the fact that he probably hasn't yet finished high school and has a child, his grammar is a total turn off:   "i'm vary outgoing. looking for long lasting ralationship. who injoys the same intersit i do. no short ralitionship.im vary funney. my deam date wold be at the water front with wine waching the sun set and talking for hours. so try me and you wont be dispointment"  Um...okay.

      After an email yesterday afternoon, it looks like I'll be speaking to my new Match.com, object-of-my-affection de jour, Mike for the first time tomorrow night.  I'm both excited and nervous.  Of course, I'm plagued with all the "what if's..." and I'm prepared for disappointment, but he seems genuinely sweet in his emails.  I've been disappointed with Match.com EYF's four times now.  All seemed like decent guys with potential...then things go wrong and I realize they're idiots.  Hell, maybe it could work this time.  We do have tons in common and he's interested in the works of Leonard Cohen--that certaintly doesn't hurt.

       This is an email I'm mailing to all the attorneys in the Detroit office of my firm tomorrow morning.  We have a little problem...   It has come to my attention that the library shelves are getting a little bare.  Maybe the books are sprouting legs and running away.  Maybe some attorneys are snatching certain popular titles and hiding them away in their offices for personal use.  Perhaps someone (I'm not naming any names, of course) likes to read a page or two of Martin, Dean and Webster volume 2.100 in the lavatory at home.  Whatever the cause, who knows, I don't care.  The only thing for certain--we need these missing books to be returned.  "What can I do to help restore the library to it's original full-shelved splendor???", you may ask.  It's simple.  On  Friday morning before 10:00, leave any library books that may have wandered into your office outside your door.  I'll pick them up and take note of who contributed.  One of these names will be picked at random after the collection is compete and the winner will receive a souvenir (of the fermented molasses or sugar cane variety) from Candace's upcoming Grand Cayman vacation trip.     Thanks for your support,  Jennifer

      The only thing that could make sitting in a small, windowless office for 8 hours straight any worse is the lack of ventilation.  Sure, modern downtown office buildings usually don't have windows that open, but something other than a slight drift of chilly air might be a nice idea for air circulation.  I just finished using the super-duper  urlLink Sanford Magnum 44 Marker --the mack daddy of all markers.  Roughly the size of a stadium kielbasa, but much easier to write with.  I love any office supply with disclaimers.   "DANGER: HARMFUL OR FATAL IF SWALLOWED.  VAPOR HARMFUL.  COMBUSTIBLE.  Contains toluene and xylene.  Use only in a well ventilated area.  Do not use or store near heat or flame.  Avoid contact with eyes or prolonged contact with skin.  If swallowed, do not induce vomiting.  Call physician immediately.  Keep out of reach of children.  Do not shake."   Geez, I'm not sure I can handle all the responsibility that comes with using this marker!  p.s.  I may have been a bit over-dramatic while writing  yesterday's post, but I am still freaked out.  If a medical issue does present itself, I'm sure it can be dealt with in a calm, and preferably non-invasive manner.  Hell, it could be absolutely nothing!

      I am sick, tired and completely fed up with my job.  It's a completely dead-end position that I've been slaving away at for over three years and I've just hit my breaking point.  The librarian has just emailed something to me that basically says "Hey, guess what?  You're incompetent and can't do anything right.  I'm sharing your shortcomings with everyone else I CC'd on this email.  By the way, you'll be in charge for the next two weeks, don't fuck everything up, but you probably will anyway and we'll be doing damage control for months afterwards."  Not in as many words, of course.  The condescension here is out of control!  Her opinion really doesn't matter to me, but now I'll be pissed off for the rest of the day.  I need a vacation and have two remaining weeks stored up, but I always have work on the mind, so what's the use?  I'm inspired to work on my novel, and have made some progress recently, but I also have a beast of a take-home paralegal studies exam to work on due Thursday.

      Okay, what is wrong with my sleep pattern?  In bed at 5 AM, awake naturally at 8:50.  What gives?  I'm tired, cranky and crampy right now.  Cranky due to a ordinary foul mood and being peeved at Tim Hortons because my coffee tastes old and burnt--bottom of the pot   **Not the greatest experience at the T-Ho's on 8 Mile by Eastland!  Beware!**   The crampy element is probably due to sitting lady-like for nearly 10 hours (GOOD DATE!)  M. is really sweet and his choice of movies is A+  Last night/this morning we watched The Big Lebowski and Mystery Men.  Fun stuff!  Plus  urlLink John  seems to like him.

      That's my weight-loss mantra.  I carry my weight like a camel; that's better than in the gut, I guess.  Of course, once all the surplus tonnage disappears, so will everything else, but I actually don't mind.  I don't have any discernible waist or hips, so I'm a little boy-shaped.  On the handy Land's End swimsuit guide, my body shape is designated as the rectangle shape, but I guess that's better than being the really hippy triangle shape.  Once I lose all the extra pounds, I'll hopefully be a size 2 or 4, but that all depends on my exercise plans.  I'm doing my  urlLink Weight Watchers  online weigh-in tomorrow morning, so I'll be at Bally's to use the accurate medical scale once I wake up, right after I pee, before I drink anything, before I shower and before I have any heavy thoughts.  I've already lost one pound, so I'm feeling fairly successful.  I've been sticking to this diet religiously for the last two weeks, and I'm not cheating.  I had a double cheeseburger for dinner last night at McDonald's, and even though it was 12 Points, I still recorded it.  Thank G-D for Flex Points!!!  For lunch today it's Lean Cuisine Baked Fish with Cheddar Shells.  Yum!!  Seriously--it's yum!

      So, me hears from my fan club that millions of my loyal readers are clamoring for more J-Sto information.  When will my new fragrance be released?  What do I think of the fat ass comments?  How did I break into Hollywood as just a short, very pale girl of Polish extraction sans rhythm or any discernible groove?  What  urlLink Netflix  movies are you currently watching?  My publicists will handle the first three, yet in the interest of staying close to my fans, I'll answer the latter.  I LOOOOVE Netflix.  For a hair over $20.00 a month, I can rent all the movies I can watch (three at a time.)  It's positively wonderful.  The three I have at mi casa are:  1.   urlLink The Shape of Things  2.   urlLink Girl with a Pearl Earring  3.   urlLink Little Otik   M. hopefully will be coming over this weekend, perhaps Saturday, to hang out and watch one of these flicks, none of which I have yet watched.  If only the damn papparazzi will leave us alone.

      I was leery of this geek test, but now I know for sure what the entire universe has known for years: I'm kinda geeky.  It's a proven fact.  Oh well, there's worse things in the world.     You are   57%   geek     You are a geek. Good for you! Considering the endless complexity of the universe, as well as whatever discipline you happen to be most interested in, you'll never be bored as long as you have a good book store, a net connection, and thousands of dollars worth of expensive equipment. Assuming you're a technical geek, you'll be able to afford it, too. If you're not a technical geek, you're geek enough to mate with a technical geek and thereby get the needed dough.  Dating tip : Don't date a geek of the same persuasion as you. You'll constantly try to out-geek the other.      urlLink Take the Polygeek Quiz at Thudfactor.com    And now for something completely different: I'm hungry.  It's 47 minutes till lunchtime, my attention span is completely shot (thus blogging instead of actually working,) and my office looks like it exploded.  It looks like old school Beirut.  Rubble and all.  Maybe I'll get out the Pledge and dust.  Oh, the joys of ADD!

      After nearly a year of vowing to do so, I have finally upgraded my cell phone!  Since this is my only means of communication, and since my previous phone which had served me well for over three years had taken a turn for the worse, this was necessary.  I had AT&T since the beginning, but decided to switch to Verizon since Kate uses this provider, and I talk to Kate the most, this makes sense.  Although I entered the store yesterday with the intention of purchasing the most bare-bones plan available, I was somehow talked into buying (for only $20.00 more)  urlLink this pimptastic phone.     This phone is tiny and weighs several ounces less than my previous phone, so I'll probably be losing it on a weekly basis.  I'll try to be careful.  The alarm function isn't as persistent as the previous phone; I'll have to work with this.  Something about it reminds me of Number 5 from  urlLink "Short Circuit."     Now maybe I'll be able to figure out how to retrieve my messages...

      Here's another something wonderful to find it's way to the LISP listserv.  Although I'm no longer on the path of librarian enlightenment, sometimes something interesting occasionally shows up.

Also, Friday night/Saturday morning's showing of Lawrence of Arabia was grand.  I can't believe it!  I'm technically seeing a nice guy with manners!!!  He was also the only non-relative to wish me a happy birthday!  I've invited M. to watch the Detroit Fireworks with me on Wednesday, but I just emailed him this morning and since it's a Monday he's probably busy.

      Everyone who knows me knows about my belief in the Jinx.  According to  urlLink Dictionary.com , a jinx is "A person or thing that is believed to bring bad luck.  Possibly from jynx, wryneck (from its use in witchcraft), from Latin iynx, from Greek iunx, perhaps from iuzein, to call, cry."  I don't think of it as a tangible item, but more of a roving black storm cloud.  I'm not a witch, but I'm a bit superstitious.  Here's an example: apart from Idiot Attorney Boy's mental imbalance and self-centeredness, I'm also attributing the downfall to my bad habit of getting my hopes up and chattering waaaaaay too much about my personal/social life, ergo the jinx got me.  Although this blog is basically a semi-public diary, I'm going to limit using my EYF's name, until things become more certain/stable, if they ever do.  Then maybe the jinx will start visiting other people and I'll be happy for once.  Plans have been made for tonight!  I'm going to M's house to watch "Lawrence of Arabia," which is not the usual date-night movie, but it's a great epic flick anyway.  And there is definitely something attractive about a British guy garbed in traditional Arabic attire.  I was in a T.E. Lawrence phase throughout my junior and senior years in high school, yet I never did get burnt out.  I watched movies, read historical accounts, his books, everything.  Yeah, I'm a dork.  It's obivious to M that I like him, I'm sure; maybe I'll get some indication tonight...Although this will be the third time we're hanging out this week, so at the very least, he doesn't mind hanging out with me.  Ugh, this is far more difficult than it should be.

      Well, the game was okay.  A bit dull, in fact.  Maybe it's because I'm not a basketball fan, maybe because the puppy was more interesting than watching sweaty guys run around and demonstrate hand-eye coordination.  Either way, the Pistons won the championship last night.  I've had my fill of sports for the time being.  Everything seems to be going well with Mike and his friends are pretty cool.  It was quite a comfortable atmosphere.  I still can't determine whether he likes me or not.  Grrr.  He hugged me and said I was "warm and soft" but that might be an illusion to my layer of blubber, which reminds me, I should re-start my campaign to "lose the back, keep the rack."   After departing from his home at 12:45 or so, I decided to crash at my parent's house.  It seemed like a good idea, especially since my left contact was roaming around the back of my eyeball.  A bit of a dangerous situation.  So, after going to bed at 1:30, waking up at 5:00 and arriving at work at 7:00, my entire day/internal clock is screwed up.  I'm planning on crashing hard at 3:00.

      I completed Nicholas Sparks' "The Rescue."  It wasn't the best novel I've ever read.  It wasn't the worst.  Maybe some people enjoy reading novels that involve obstacles being overcome and the power of true love.  I'm getting out of that phase; I need to clean the warm fuzzies out of my brain.  I'm starting on Dalton Trumbo's " urlLink Johnny Got His Gun " this afternoon.  I've had it for years but for some reason, last night, I finally decided to read it.  Everyone either wants me to dress sexy or sporty for this evening's sporting event/meet the friends escapade.  I don't have the wardrobe for either of those options.  Now I'm getting nervous.

      Within the last couple of days, I have become strangely popular!  I'm meeting up with Liz ( the Lusty Lizzard ) and Craig this afternoon for lunch downtown...that is, if they can figure out how to get to Cobo for parking.  Hmmm.  Then, I was invited to watch the Pistons game at Mike's house tonight...and meet some of his friends!  Eek!!!  I'm really excited, but I'm not always the best person in the world when it comes to meeting new people, especially a new guy's college buddies.  This should prove to be very interesting.  I realize I'll be the new girl on display, but there will also be the cats and a puppy to take the attention away from me.  Now what the hell will I wear?!?!?

      Yesterday was very interesting, but before I go on, I must give props to my homies at Pfizer for their damn fine allergy medication  urlLink ZYRTEC .  On Sunday I met Mike at his house before embarking on our zoo outing.  He has two extremely affectionate cats, both of whom I am extremely allergic to.  In two or three hours, the Zyrtec I took in the morning had knocked out any allercic reactions I may have had.  Wonder Drug!  We spent a lovely afternoon at the zoo, weather was party cloudy and about 80 degrees, all the animals were out and doing their particular animal thangs.  We walked around for nearly five hours.  Then we had dinner (Artichoke, black olive and fresh garlic pizza) and drinks at Como's in Ferndale, and back to his place at 8:30 for more conversation and to watch the Piston's game.  I left at 10:45, wayyyyy past my bedtime, but all is cool.  He wants to see me again sometime this week!  Eeeek!  He even emailed me this morning!  I'm glowing like a smitten teenager, but these beginning days are always fun!  I think he's interested in me, I'm pretty sure, but I have been fooled before.

      In order to become a more well-rounded individual, I have decided to take a break from Catch-22 and Dr. Zhivago and start reading some more "mainstream" titles.  This weekend, I shall sink my teeth into the fourth Harry Potter book (which I'm quite looking forward to) and, er, um, uh...A Nicholas Sparks novel.    I read one of his novels about a year ago and shortly afterwards experienced internal bleeding.  My eyes also filled up with blood and I started coughing up a black, tar-like substance.  Okay, it wasn't all that bad, but it was pretty sappy and simple.  I'm reading "The Rescue" and already on page 52, I can totally foresee the ending.  Perhaps it won't be all that bad, but I'm not holding my breath.  The author's picture on the dust cover also threw me--The writing reminded me of an Andy Griffith-esque old man, not a guy looking like an old preppy kid.  This reading will not bode well on my writing plans.  If I start writing the literary equivalent of Celine Dion schmaltz, someone please put me out of my misery.

      Whilst dreaming away the time before lunch, I decided to add Vivian to the list.  Shortening it to "Viv" would be just plain stupid, so it still falls into the 'perfect name' category.

      As I was driving down Jefferson this morning, listening to the Pixies and drinking my Panera Bread coffee, I officially decided on four winning baby names: Miriam, Matilda, Lydia, and Julian.  3 girls and a boy.  These are perfect--uncommon but not strange and difficult to shorten into a nickname.  Maybe when I'm 40 and adopt a pile of kids from a Polish orphanage I'll be prepared name-wise.

      My last two posts were just basic little quizzes that I found interesting and educational (since I now know how to get images on the page.)  It's not that I'm suffering from a lack of issues to write about, it's just the opposite.  I'm cursed with an abundance of ideas, unfortunately most of which fall into the "surly, nasty, bad attitude" category.  Hell, since the chosen few have ever wandered onto this page, I'll give myself permission to rant and rave.  In eleven days, I will be turning 27 years old.  27 years boils down to 9861.75 days.  Apart from the 1461 days spent learning how to talk, walk, and gain bladder control, I've spent the rest in educational settings or in some kind of semi-professional situation.  Now I'm stalled.  When I started at Central nine years ago, I was pre-law.  Technically, I graduated pre-law as well.  If my initial plans were followed, I will have graduated at 22, finished law school at 25, and would probably have a nice job that would involve responsibilities, financial stability and a decent wardrobe.  But alas, no.  Things never work out the way you plan.  I'm turning 27 with a job that only requires the ability to alphabetize, an outdated wardrobe, and a crappy, cheap, yet overpriced apartment.  I have no peers at all and not even any close friends nearby.  I'm unhappily single.  I'm considering moving back home with my parents.  I'm really depressed today thinking about this.  Hell, it's 80 degrees outside and sunny, yet I'm in my cold office typing away feeling sorry for myself.  Even if I stuck with my library science degree, I would have a better existance by now, but of course, no.  And I have at least 1.5 years left on the paralegal degree, but I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel.  Man, what a stinker of a day I'm having today.  I need a hug.  Unfortunately, this attitude/outlook will probably last for the next couple of months, unless something good comes along--like a mood elevator or a social life.  Another thing: I hate computer dating.  Although it's relatively easy and convenient, it's also soooo enlightening, in rotten ways.  I checked my profile this morning to see how many times my profile had been checked out (1450) and out of curiousity I checked to see when Mike had last been logged on.  He was active within 24 hours.  Of course, so had I, but I'm a bit insecure right now.  I need to get a life, or a hobby, or something to keep my brain occupied.  He does seem interested in me, but who knows.  Maybe he's got other dates lined up.  After all this time, I'm quite used to rejection, but it doesn't get any easier.  Why can't I make my brain slow down!?!?  I will snap out of this.  I'm going outside for lunch.  Ciao.

      Hmmm.  Interesting indeed.  Okay, who in this situation am I?  ET or Elliot?  Probably not Drew Barrymore, probably not the older brother.  It's been about 15 years since I put myself through the agony of watching this; I'm not planning on watching it anytime soon.  I remember going to see this with Kate and our cousin Karen.  I vividly remember Kate sobbing in the ladies room at Eastland Theater "Why did ET have to go home?!?!?"  As far as alien movies go, I prefer "Close Encounters of the Third Kind."

      According to the  urlLink "Live Detroit River Webcam by the Great Lakes Maritime Institute from the Dossin Great Lakes Museum on Belle Isle"  (that's a mouthful) it is currently 82 degrees outside.  On Channel 7 this morning, I was informed that it could reach 91 degrees today.  Keeping all this in mind, I shlepped myself outside to read and returned about fifteen minutes later because I was chilly.  Not that this office is balmy either: I have goosebumps and a runny nose.  If I'm getting sick, there will be serious hell to pay.  I'm blaming John for this one; it's probably a reptile virus.  Damn.  I've got to recover by Sunday!  I'm going to the  urlLink Detroit Zoo  with Mike!  Yippee.  Now, what to wear...  I have a nice khaki skirt, maybe a white shirt, but I'll probably look like someone dressing for safari, and I'm not going to be that dork this time!

      For the first time in a few months, I had a bona fide date!  A real, pre-arranged meeting with definite plans!  A definite prospect who was extremely gentlemanly, mannerly, and more than willing to pick up the check!  What more to ask for in a fella!  In a nutshell, here's what we did:  Whistler exhibit at the DIA 1:00 pm, coffee, chatting, strolling around the Medical Center, beers, bowling, Royal Oak, more strolling, " urlLink Super Size Me " at the Main, more strolling, resist the temptation of the hookah, tea (in liquid form) then farewell at 1:00 am.   Quite a lovely time!!  I really hope to see him again, yet I AM NOT getting my hopes up, only to be dashed soon afterwards.  With the past few guys, after the first date, I've thought giddily "I'm going to marry him" but not this time, well yes this time but not exactly.  Instead I can honestly see something real developing; a real friendship leading to something else.  We have so much in common and that's a rarity for me.  Plus the fact that he has an evil streak is a bonus. ;)

      It's been in front of me for so long!  I'll start writing again!  I think I stopped because of Stupid Attorney Boy's opinion.  I have so many ideas; one is bound to be a success!  Here's the skinny on one of the stories--just the basics.  20-something girl, freshly dumped, discovers psychic/telekinetic powers and true love.  Chic lit marries sci-fi.  How does that sound?  Anyone?  Liz?  Damn it's a slow day at work, as I'm sure you have already gathered.

      Perhaps I need to reevaluate my choice of favorite movies.  Last night I watched  urlLink Secretary  again, and although it's not the most mainstream romantic comedy out there, something about this movie speaks to me.  Maybe it's the fact that my job is so unbelievably dull.  Maybe it's my tedious day- to-day routine.  Maybe it's my wish for an exotic guy to arrive and shake me out of my comfort zone.  Who knows?  I just love this movie.  My sister hated it.  It's one of those movies where either you love it or hate it.  At my firm, I can't think of an E. Edward Grey equivalent, but, of course, I'm not a secretary and everyone treats me fairly nicely because I help them find obscure titles and missing materials.  Not that I'd love getting flogged by a superior...

      I'm not sure what I'm doing.  Should I keep going at Oakland and eventually become a paralegal?  Should I return to Wayne State and become a librarian?  Is there a third option???  Am I choosing a career just because of the money?  I'm not sure I'll ever find job satisfaction and this is freaking me out.  I'm jamming my free time with stupid activities hoping to discover a hobby that will make up for my dull, lifeless workplace existance.  On Tuesday, I'll be starting knitting classes.  It's no longer an old lady hobby (or so I've been told) and perhaps I'll be able to make Christmas and birthday presents with more of a personal touch!  The classes are held at The Wool and the Floss in Grosse Pointe, just off of Kercheval so when I'm finished with each class, maybe I can stop by The Pointe Peddlar and get a ham and cheese croissant for dinner.  Mmmmm.

      Last night/this morning I had a really strange waking dream.  I could've sworn that I was completely awake, but I couldn't move.  Not at all.  I couldn't lift my head or any appendages.  Later I remember desperately trying to reach out and throw something from my bed, and SOMETHING GRABBED MY WRIST!  I screamed and instantly woke up, or at least was able to move.  The first person I mentioned this to was my New-Age buddy Yvonne at work.  She said, as if this was the most normal thing in the world, "Oh, that was just your spirit entering your body.  That's why you couldn't move.  They leave and roam around at night."  Apparently I grabbed my own wrist but since the spirit was AWOL, my sense of touch was impaired.  Maybe telling her wasn't such a great idea after all.  She also told me something about the Venus eclipse and how my powers of telepathy are going to be increased in the coming weeks.  Great.  Now I won't just be thinking that people are talking behind my back--I'll know it!!  :)

Also, I have a&nbsp;new love:  urlLink Buca di Beppo!!!!! &nbsp; Oh my gawd.&nbsp; The BEST Italian food on the whole planet.&nbsp; Maybe the whole galaxy or solar system.&nbsp; Maybe in the entire whole of existance!!!!!&nbsp; YUMMMMM!!!

      Well, after years of laughing off the suggestion and aggressively&nbsp;resisting the idea, I will be moving back with my parents.&nbsp; Back to the wonderful world of Sterling Heights.&nbsp; Gone will be the days of sitting around on MY couch, watching MY TV, in MY perfect world of solitude.&nbsp; Of course, I will be looking forward to the days of living rent-free and relatively bill-free.&nbsp; So, I guess it slightly balances out.&nbsp; I'll be able to afford full-time grad school and gas in the tank!&nbsp; I'll miss St. Clair Shores, but mostly just the water.&nbsp; Now my priority is finding a reasonable self-storage facility to share with Kate.&nbsp; Her new apartment's balcony isn't big enough for her patio set.

      Wonderful, just wonderful.&nbsp; The law school idea has been implanted in my brain yet again.&nbsp; Here's the current scenario: I could finish the paralegal degree in 1.5 years, secure a paralegal position (hopefully in the firm I've been working at for 3+ years,) then find a night program at one of the local law schools, where I would plow through the program in the standard 3 years.&nbsp; I'd be in my early thirties and would hopefully be successful.&nbsp;   Of course, this whole plan doesn't include where I'd be living, who'd be paying for the excessive educational costs, where I'd be institutionalized after melting down, etc...&nbsp; And imagine everyone's surprise when, after I  finally  graduate, I decide to join the Peace Corps or decide to go back to art school for metalsmithing or something.   Maybe I should get back to the damn novel that's malingering in my mind.&nbsp; I need some direction.&nbsp; At least my plans are taking into account my vast, expansive, useless liberal arts background.&nbsp; I wish I could go back in time, to high school and smack myself around.&nbsp; I'd beg and plead with my younger self to study harder in science and math.&nbsp; Spend less time reading Stephen King novels and more time on biology and chemistry.&nbsp; Then I'd haunt my 18-year-old&nbsp;college self with the same advice, only tagging&nbsp;on the suggestion to drop political science and enroll in more science, math, anatomy and other practical courses that could result in a nursing degree, maybe.&nbsp; And to party more...make more friends!!!&nbsp; And not to waste my time on useless,&nbsp;going nowhere&nbsp;guys.&nbsp; Oh well, too late for all that, I guess.

      Okay, I've got guys calling me out of obligation, not of their own free will, others who aren't calling me at all when they said they would, perhaps because my number has been lost or set aside, perhaps because they JUST DON'T CARE, AND to top all things off, I haven't lost a single pound in two weeks. If I plateaued after only six or seven weeks, I will be supremely pissed!   I've gotta start eating more greens, less Goldfish crackers, and maybe running or at least walking once a day. I wonder how many Points the cheeseburger I have planned for dinner tonight will add up to? Maybe I'll have prunes as a side dish...that should balance everything out!!! :)

      I may be one of those people destined to be alone...and that's not all that bad.  I don't have to have a pristine bathroom and bedroom because someone else likes it that way.  I don't have to do all my dishes the minute I'm finished eating.  I can be an adult with Sea Monkeys living on my kitchen windowsill.  I can remain in bed all day, except to leave when nature calls or when pizza arrives.  I will rent all the foreign films I never got a chance to see, out of the uncomfortable feeling of watching a movie alone (granted, I rarely have this feeling, but there's "Little Otik" still waiting for me...thanks Luis.)  I've also started writing with full force.  According to  urlLink Jennifer Weiner , one of my all-time favorite authors, she has it all worked out: basically in order to write a kick-ass novel, one needs to have the following:  1. The Unhappy Childhood.  2. The Miserable Love Life.  3. Major in Liberal Arts (but not necessarily creative writing.)  4. Get a Job (not an MFA.)  5. Write to Please Yourself.  6. Get a Dog.  7. Get Published.  8. Find an Agent.  9. Be a Smart Consumer.  10. Read.  I have 6 out of 10.  Not too shabby.  Maybe the turtle and the Sea Monkeys combined can assume the amount of responsibility a puppy requires?  Probably not.

      Well, it looks like things between M. and myself are pretty much finished, even before anything really started.  I'm fairly crushed even though nothing is certain, but for the most part, I'm sure, even though my mind is probably twisted and all is still good for now.  I bet he never liked me in a serious way.  On Friday we went to see Fahrenheight 9/11 and hung out with his friends.  At dinner, we shared an appetizer sampler and we seemed like a beginning-dating couple.  After the movie we hung out with some of his friends and had coffee, then afterwards I hung out with him at his house and we talked about everything until 4:00 AM, even though I was in a really shitty mood.  Then I crashed on his couch.  Seriously, we talked about everything, even things he probably hadn't intended on sharing with me.  Then in the morning, he made me coffee and tea  As I was leaving, he didn't even want to kiss me goodbye.  Maybe it was the fear of coffee breath?    After seeing him for a month, he seems distant and not interested in seeing me.  Maybe that's just the way he is, who knows?  Maybe he's not a chit-chatty type of guy.  I plan on inviting him over to my place this Friday for dinner (I'll cook a turkey or something) and ask him where all this is going, or if he is interested in me at all.  After a month, I would like to know if I'm wasting my time.  Of course, maybe he's not sure, but I'd like to know if he is at all interested, even a little.  To be perfectly honest, he doesn't seem to mind paying for all my meals, drinks and movie tickets, so that's something.  Time is precious and I wasted more than my share on Luis--that's for sure.  I don't want that to happen again.  I'd like to know if I should put away my feelings for M. if they aren't based on a mutual attraction type of thing.  Even if he doesn't want to be anything more than friends, maybe that's just what I need--a friend.  I have way too few friends these days and my life is wasting away spent being lonely.

      How do I love thee, Bacon?  Let me count the ways.  Ordered as a side dish with toast.  Ordered as a side dish alone, wrapped unceremoniously in a sheet of aluminum foil.  Purchased in one pound increments and cooked until crispy on the George Foreman Grill; fat and drippings saved to use as suet for the birds in the winter.  Geez!  I have such an incredible craving for this wonder meat!!!  And now for something completely different.  This past holiday weekend was quite nice.     Friday --spent with Kate at home.  We went shopping at Marshal's, then spilt an appetizer sampler plate at Pizzeria Uno.  Fun greasy stuff.  Saturday --Hung out at home for a while, returned to my place, cleaned, ran errands, shopped, watched movies and read.  Sunday --Cleaned house and made Rice Krispie Treats.  My friend Penny had a fireworks party, so I introduced M. to everyone.  Good food.  Deep Fried Turkey!  Monday --Helped M. plant several shrubs in his backyard.  Then we had La Shish.  Yum!  After sweating and getting filthy and dift covered, he said I still smelled nice.  Awwww.

      According to the Meyers-Brigs personality test, I'm a INFP.  INTROVERTED-Applies to the way we interact with the world. Introverts are people whose thoughts and ideas are drawn inward. This type scan the external environment and make evaluations based on their inner ideas and mental concepts. They derive their energies from these inner ideas. It is important for them to take time to study and reflect on a subject to get the right idea, before taking action. This type is able to grasp and accept a moral principle in its abstract form. Introverts are territorial and desire space. They draw their energies from activities where they can be alone to meditate or activities that require few people. Introverts can experience a sense of loneliness when they are in a crowd. Some are the most alone when surrounded by people, especially strangers. This type can enjoy being around people, but it can drain their energies. They need to find quiet places and solitary activities where they can meditate and recharge. Many introverts achieve the ability to extravert, but they never become extraverts. Introverts enjoy their private time, and if this is easily invaded, they learn to develop a high level of concentration so as to shut out the external world. Many view them as great listeners, but they may view others as taking advantage of this. They may have problems expressing themselves and are sometimes labeled by others as shy. Many times they will have to rehearse things before they say them. This type may wish to get their ideas out more forcefully and like to state their thoughts and feelings without interruption. They resent ones that blurt out something they were just about to say.  INTUITIVE-Applies to the way we take in information. Intuitive types look for the possibilities in life. What is possible is always in front of them, pulling at them like a magnet. Intuitive types are attracted to fantasy, fiction, and the future. They may enjoy figuring out how things work just for the sheer pleasure of doing so. This type is attracted to pun and word games. They are masters at metaphors and similes. Intuitive tends to think of several things at once and because of this are sometimes labeled as absentminded. This type likes to look at the big picture. They try to read between the lines, not accepting things at face value. Intuitive types tend to trust their hunch, their gut feeling, and this usually prove right, since they are highly in tune with their intuitive powers, their sixth sense. They are creative and imaginative, but are sometimes viewed as dreamers.  FEELING-Applies to the way we come to decisions. Feeling types make decisions based on how others feel. They are empathetic and sympathetic to others needs. This type puts themselves out for others, putting others needs above those of their own. Feeling types value and almost insist on others living in harmony. They will avoid conflict at all cost. This type tries to please others. They will take a comment back if they say something that offends someone else. Feeling types are usually friendly, tactful, and enjoy contributing to the welfare of others. They are personable, being more interested in people than in things.  PERCEPTIVE-Applies to the way we structure our lives. Perceptive types put much value on the open ended. They do not like to come to a conclusion unless forced to and then may still be uncomfortable with its closure. Being aware of how many factors are involved and how much is still unknown, they are terrified at making a rash decision. They hope they can solve a problem simply by understanding it better, by seeing it from all sides and eventually being able to see the thing to do. They love to explore the unknown. They don't like to be pinned down, to plan a task, to make definite statements. They prefer to be spontaneous, to live for the moment. They like to make-work fun or they lose interest in it. They don't believe in deadlines, but use them instead as alarm clocks allowing them to pick up spurts of energy at the last minute and accomplish the task. In conversations they can jump from subject to subject, depending on whatever enters their mind, or whatever enters the room.  PERSONALITY PROFILES  INFPs-live their lives focusing on their values. They know what is important to them and protect this at all cost. Their values focus on the optimistic verses the pessimistic, although they are often conscience of the negative. To understand the INFP is to understand their cause. They can work tirelessly toward a cause that deems worthy. They will quietly let others know what is important to them, and rarely will they give up on their purpose. They will go along with the crowd, sometimes even letting decisions be made for them, until someone violates their value system. Then they will dig their heels into the ground and will speak up for their feelings, insisting their values be followed.   INFPs are withdrawn and are sometimes hard to get to know. Some may view them as shy. But those that take the time to get to know them will find them warm and gentle, with a surprising sense of humor. They care deeply for those they consider special friends. Putting forth-unusual sacrifices to help such individuals. They often have a subtle, tragic motif running through their lives -- inner pain and unease which others seldom detect.  INFPs are creative and are constantly seeking out new possibilities. They have a gift with language and usually will express this by means of writing. Their intuitive preference supplies the imagination and their feeling preference giving them the need to communicate. They are gifted at interpreting symbols - being drawn to metaphors and similes. Because of these gifts they often write in lyric fashion  INFPs work must be more than just a paycheck, it must be fun and must contribute to something that is important to their values. To be the most productive they need a sense of purpose behind their job. They often have to look at the large picture in order to see how specific programs fit in. They are adaptable to changes and to new ideas. They work well with others being conscience of others feelings and relating with most, though not always vocally. They like to work with others who are cooperative and who share their same set of values. They strive for harmony and dislike conflict.   INFPs treasure their privacy and may keep a lot to themselves. They need time and space for reflection. Others usually get along well with them, although they may not know them intimately. INFPs may not always be organized. They may tend to lose things or to forget appointments. Only when they see the importance of organization in a task will they strive to work at it in an organized way to get it done. They can be extremely patient with complicated issues, but may become impatient with routine and details.   INFPs strive for perfection, and this is especially the case when using their feeling preference. They may have trouble finishing a project, because they never find it is good enough. Even when the project must be finished, they may feel the need to go back and improve on it later.   Reluctantly INFPs may accept leadership roles. They lead with their values being their guide. They do not aggressively lead people, but rather work with people to develop their talents and to independently achieve their goals. They have a hard time criticizing others, but will try to motivate them by their appreciation and praise. When conflicts arise, they avoid directly approaching the situation, but would rather wait for the others to work out the situation themselves.   INFPs view leisure activity as very important. However they may have a difficulty separating it from work. If they have a special skill they use at work, they may use this skill in their leisure time to help friends, family or those in need. When they are interested in pursuing a new leisure activity, they may spend a great deal of time researching this activity. Many INFPs enjoy activities that are done alone such as reading, listening to music, or gardening. This gives them the opportunity for reflection and meditation. They may also enjoy social activities with those they feel close to. When they want to be social they can be outgoing, charming and quiet funny, making them a pleasure to have around.  INFPs present a calm and pleasant face to the world around them. Because they are reserved, they may be over looked. But to those that know them they have a view into their warmth and concern and their deep commitments to their values.    OCCUPATIONAL CHOICES   Actor  Artist  Architect  Church Worker  College Professor: Humanities/Art  Counselor  Editor  Educational Consultant  Employment Development Specialist  English Teacher  Fine Arts Teacher  Human Resources Development Specialist  Journalist  Librarian  Minister/Priest  Missionary  Musician  Psychiatry  Psychologist  Religious Educator  Researcher  Social Scientist  Social Worker  Speech Pathologist  Writer: poet/Novelist   STRENGTHS:  They can do a good job of blending production with compassion for the work force. They enjoy giving freedom for each to develop according to their own personality and are willing to give commendation and have a listening ear for new ideas. They are able to communicate well with others on a one to one basis.   They are intellectually astute, competent, and enriched with idealism.    They have a high need to be of service to others. They enjoy working toward causes they believe in.   They work well alone, and are faithful to their duties and obligations.   WEAKNESSES:  When the workplace becomes negative, they may become restless. They can have mood swings between stubbornness and criticism. This is uncharacteristic of their nature and is an indicator of stress.   They are perfectionists. They may be self-critical. They feel there is never enough time to do the job right. They must recognize when to quit, and live with a less than perfect product. They also must realize that others will never fully meet up to their expectations.   They may become discouraged if their work is not geared toward something they believe in. They want control of their projects, and if they lose control they can lose interest.    They may have trouble working in a competitive environment.   They may become unrealistic when planning a project. They may become inflexible when requested to change some of their ideas.    CAREER NEEDS  They need work that allows them to express their vision, and lets them work within their own set of values and beliefs.   They need work that gives them control over the product and the process of creating it, allowing them time to fully develop their ideas   They need work that gives them a private space and uninterrupted time, but allows them from time to time to meet with ones they respect, and bounce their ideas off them.   They need work that gives them a flexible schedule, with no restraint to rules and regulations, and allows them to work as they feel inspired.   They need work that is done in a tension free environment, with other creative caring individuals.   They need work that let them be original, and that encourages personal growth and rewards it.   They need work that gives them time to do the best possible job, and that doesn't call for them to do presentations of their ideas before large crowds.   They need work that lets them help others to learn how to grow and develop their full potential.   They need work that allows them to develop deep one to one relationships with people, letting them understand others and discover what makes them tick.   They need work that allows them to fulfill their ideas, without being limited by money, time, or other obstacles.    IN THE WORKPLACE  INFPs enjoy working alone, treasuring the opportunity for contemplation. They enjoy variety in whatever they do. They enjoy taking on new projects and activities, but have a tendency to take on too many things at once. They get a sense of satisfaction from the fact that nothing is constant, which means they can positively influence a cause in a positive or constructive way.   INFPs are loyal and industrious team players. They work hard to achieve team harmony and make their work meaningful. They are encouraged from approval from others, but when criticized they may be deeply hurt, taking such criticism personally.  INFPs can be powerful leaders when dealing with people and drawing people together to achieve their purpose.  INFPs lead with people in mind. They look to the individual growth and development and will look for a way to encourage and support such growth. They may tend to relate with a few special people, being drawn to their causes and goals. They quietly encourage these individuals to achieve whatever they set out to do.  INFPs manage in a very quiet unassuming way, getting personally involved with individuals within the organization. They are at their best dealing with people, drawing out their outstanding qualities. They are naturally tuned into the motivations and emotions of others, having a gift at understanding individual differences.   Because INFPs are focused in on people's emotions and motivations, they become aware of and get involved in their co-workers personal problems. They may feel obligated at resolving disagreements and conflicts among employees, trying to create an atmosphere of harmony. INFPs listen carefully and intently to others, giving them individual attentions and responding with the proper feedback for the needed situation. They masterfully show appreciation and give praise when they find the appropriate opportunity. they direct their praise toward human accomplishment. They are alert to individual potential and look for ways to help individuals meet that potential.

      I'm trying to make my job seem more important.  The librarian will be in Cape Cod for the next two weeks leaving little ol' me in charge.  Fortunately, it's the slow time of year and I've been on a cleaning kick.  I've been working on the Introduction to Law take-home final exam for the past few days and it's due at 7:00.  Unfortunately, "working on" doesn't exactly mean finishing, or even making a dent.  Good thing for me--I'll channel all my nervous energy and procrastination skills for a big brain power explosion due to hit in a few hours.  I'll work through lunch and for an hour after work.  I don't think there's too much to worry about.

      It looks like things between myself and T. are not going to happen. Not a peep from him since Thursday night, not even a response to my "I had a great time" email. Dammit!!!  On the up side, I lost 1 pound this week, bringing my total up to 6 pounds!!!!!  I'm on my way to skinniness!  :)

      I had a date last night withT.  Yes, a Thursday night date and it was really great!  We met at Ferlito's, a cute family-style Italian place on Mack, at 6:30 and talked nonstop until 10:30.  We did find time to eat a bit (I had an antipasto salad, he had eggplant parmesan) but we talked and talked about everything.  There were no lulls in the conversation.  Yet, I am not sure if he is interested in me.  I dressed cute, wore lots of eye makeup, and was completely myself, no pretending.  T. is really sweet and he actually mentioned wanting to someday take a cruise on a ship/tanker/barge traveling down the Detroit River.  That almost knocked me out of my seat.  I've been saying that for years!  We have so much in common but chances are, I'll hear from him once or twice more and then he'll disappear like all the rest.  I've got to think positive but everything in the past has fallen to pieces when I get my hopes up.   It's about time I catch a break...maybe I'm being tested; maybe my patience is at some super-human level and this is all a mind-control experiment, something like in the Matrix...hmmm, maybe doctors in a lab somewhere are reading the test results and saying something like "Wow, most others in her situation would've given up by now and accepted their spinster destiny.  Deliver the stray cat and sensible shoes to her doorstep immediately, we must find her breaking point."  Okay, that's a bit weird.  I'm hardly paranoid, but I'm also getting discouraged.  After years of horrible, terrible, unreliable, emotionally abusive, unfaithful, thieving and otherwise stinking turds of supposed "boyfriends" I've had in the past, I think I deserve something nice for a change.

      Mike's email has rolled off me like water on a duck (whatever that expression is.)  Last night I had a nice conversation with a new EYF (Eligible Young Fella) who I shall refer to as T.  We have so much in common so far!  He called me around 9:00 and we talked nonstop until around 11:00, when I had to cut the conversation short because I had to get to sleep and was starting to lose my voice.  He seems like a nice guy (well, they all start out that way,) and I'm going to call him tonight to carry on the chat.  Yay!

      After three weeks of silence, I was formally dumped by Mike.  He must think I'm really vacant.  I've been given the silent treatment zillions of times; I'm not stupid, I know what that means.  What a turd...and to think, I was having a great day until now.

      Last night I had a dream that spanned a month.  It probably lasted 10 minutes total.  It involved leaving work early with my perpetual, impossible, workplace crush, who I shall not name or initial for fear of someone who knows me reading this and putting clues together.  This was not the same guy as last night's home-makeover dream.  Needless to say, this is a hopeless crush.  I've crushed on him for three years, and still blush every time he speaks with me.  I turn beet red.  Rather immature, really.  It's not even a secret crush anyway; a handful of coworkers know about it and they rag on me for it.  In the dream, in a moment of complete aggrivation and impulse, I walked into his office and jokingly said "Let's take off this afternoon for a Tiger's game."  He answered "That sounds great, lets go."  At the game we chatted and eventually...he wasn't paying attention to the game anymore, just me.  I'm not one for PDA's but in this dream I was all up for it.  Afterwards, the next day at work he walked into my office and expressed his interest in getting to know me better, wanting to take me out to dinner, movies, dancing, the cider mill (bees were in this dream) and meeting my parents and having me meet his.  He actually said all of this.  Instead of freaking out, I said that it sounded lovely.  I also dreamed of going out with him to all these places and the dream ended with him proposing to me with a beautiful diamond ring and letting everyone at work know.  I'm really not a psychopath, I'm just sad and lonely and he's a nice guy.  On Friday, I went to  urlLink www.adiamondisforever.com  and designed imaginary engagement rings, so maybe that caused part of the dream.  Also, the latest Match.com guy who didn't work out may have inspired the thoughts.  I need to get over this stupid crush.  It's not professional and will never work out.  He had his chance about a year ago.

       Stream of consciousness dream recollection:   Last night/this morning I dreamed that I was part of a home-improvement makeover show like Trading Spaces or Extreme Home Makeover. I was the crappy team member who no one liked and who's ideas were never considered. For one room we were doing, I recall the walls were painted blue and strung with ribbons for a multicolored plaid look. It didn't look too bad. One of my jobs was to purchase a couch or a slipcover for an existing couch and I was to go shopping with a guy from work. I rode my bike and he drove a silver Jeep Cherokee. Somehow, I managed to keep up with his car on my bike. We stopped at his former apartment building because he wanted to show me something. The place was a complete rundown shithole on the outside with weeds and weedy trees taking over the landscaping, much like abandoned building has growing all over the outside. As we climbed the stairs, I noticed the place was much different on the inside. Hardwood floors and plaster walls. Very old but well-kept. On one floor was a restaurant filled with elderly people and I remember the menu only had cabbage soup. We walked to a window and looked out onto a huge harbor or bay with a few yachts docked. It was like looking out onto Lake St. Clair, but the area we were in was nowhere near water. As I looked out the window, I noticed dark storm clouds.

      I've been getting to sleep a little later than usual nearly every day this week, so any dreams that I may have had have been forgotten or are lying deeply imbedded in my brain.  I should concentrate a little harder in the morning, but just getting out of bed has been an ordeal!

      A major portion of my dream was me being set up with random guys at my boyfriend's funeral.  I remember telling everyone "What is your problem?  My boyfriend just died!" and having my comments go unnoticed.  The strange thing was that I was still hanging out and talking with my dead boyfriend, who looked just like the guy who plays J.D. on Scrubs.
