      I began my routine of going to Jurong Regional Library by travelling the IMM free shuttle bus yesterday. Well, I am not very sure how long would I be persisting this "ingenious" idea of mine to travel for free in the substitution of waiting for the bus to come in the hot bloody sun. However, for the time being, I can still say that I am quite comfortable with the routine. Adeline told me that I am cheapbo when I told her this. Hahah..but I don't care...at least I can save money *hmpf*  I dropped by Daiso in IMM after going to library. I had the intention to buy a dumb bell to build up muscles in my ever-skinny arms but I dropped the idea and bought myself blotters instead. Boy, this act of mine revealed how vain I am.... In fact, I decided not to buy the dumb bell because the quality of the dumb bell was not as good as what I had expected (but what can I expect huh...since it costed only 2 bucks). Therefore, I decided that I can save the money by  NOT  buying the dumb bell and I do push-ups at home!   Adeline asked me to accompany her to watch Spider-Man next Monday and I am wondering whether should I go. After watching Shrek2, I have decided it is cool to watch animated movies. I mean, why not since technology is so advanced these days that the characters look almost real... Yet, on the other hand, I am thinking of saving money. I had planned to buy thermal wears with Linda on Wednesday...and my bank a/c was depleting....  On the subject of money, I think I am a failure in savings. I don't understand how come for working about nearly 2 years, I don't really save a single cent. Okie...I did have some basic savings now but that constitutes to my travelling expenses to UK next year. After I come back from the one-month trip next year, I would be back to square one again...with almost zero amount to start with. Haizz...I better don't think too much and concentrate on the present.  Algorithmic theory proves to be much drier than I thought it would be. Or is it the teacher? Anyway, after taking part-time studying, I realized that I enjoy the studying process but at the same time, I felt stupid as I was slow to pick up...That sounded a bit of contradiction isn't it? Hmmm....maybe I am one that enjoys being lost?

      On my way home yesterday, I bought the newspapers and 8-Days on the spur of the moment. Well, the journalists have done a good job. I was attracted by the interesting headlines.  Starting with the good news, Diana Ser's face was splashed over the mag cover. She is going to be Mrs Lye very soon. Looking at the pictures, James Lye and her do make a handsome pair. Indeed, couples like them in the media industry are rare gems now. They have a marathon-long relationship of 9 years before they finally decide to walk down the aisle.                                ****    And on the newspapers' headline was the Korean soldier who was held as a captive by the terrorists. He was beheaded despite his pleas. I was quite upset by the news. Perhaps if I did not watch the clips in which he has pleaded so pitifully to the terrorists to let him off, and the heartless (or should I say, thoughtless) Korean government insisted that they would dispatch more troops to assist US on air, I would not feel so much.   After reading the article, I was having mixed feelings: IF the Korean government do have the intention to save the hostage, they would not have said such things on air. It was OBVIOUS that the terrorists wanted was that the Korean government stop sending troops. On the other hand, the Korean government insisted on doing the silliest thing in mind...and that was to declare that they would not stop dispatching troops ON AIR. Oh mine, even someone with an IQ of 80 would have known that the poor captive's chance of suriving was slimmed down to zero with such bombastic announcement.   On the other hand, on a more intellectual and less emotional point of view, the government did their role. They have sticked to their promises to the US government and acted accordingly to what they have promised. At the same time, they did try to send special missionary troops over to rescue the captive. Well, on a grave note, people should know that survivial or death are just part and parcel of life. Perhaps, the demise of the Korean soldier should be viewed in such a way that his death was a patriotic act, and not just another loss of an innocent life...   Sigh...Being the ever-peacemaker, Icould not help but to think that would not it be great if there isn't any war at all? Humans should be cultivated to realise that violence(War) should not be the ultimate solution to solve problems. COMMUNICATION do it. How many lives have been robbed off in the substitution of power and material gains?

      Today I must have gotten out from the wrong side of the bed. I picked up a pleated skirt which I have never wore in my life from my cupboard and wore it to work. Being a very conscientious, and I should say VERY conscientious person, I kept staring at my reflection in the glass panels of the MRT.   Why didn't I notice that my skirt is at least 2 inches above my kneecaps before I left the house? I look more like   going to school and joining the cheerleading team than going to work. Staring below the skirt, I began to think of the exercise regime that I should start so that I could add some meat to my scarecrow-like legs and arms.   On the other hand, albeit those little complaints here and there, I felt happy. It had been quite some time that I really wear a skirt to work...I mean, those real skirts and not casual denim skirts. Maybe I should top up my wardrobe with more office skirts when I have the financial means. It is good to have a change at times. Wearing skirts make me feel more lady-like and less workholic...hahah....skirts have a psychological effect on me.

      You cannot believe the tremdenous changes that the  urlLink library  has undergone. I was in for a double shock, albeit a pleasant one, when I went to the library the first time after it was opened after the renovation.  It was swarmed with people. Well, it was understandable as it was Sunday. You can see teens whispering and looking at books in the teens' corner on level 4.Young adults mugging for their studies in some corners of the Research centre on level 3. Daddies, mummies and their kids doing leisure reading on level 2.   Overall, the library was spacious and well-equipped for academic and family gatherings. The only negative feedback I wanted to give was that the pathetic number of tables that the library provide for readers. I guess it is a strategic move to keep muggers from staying too long in the library, reading their own books than the library books. It explains the increased number of cushions. Yet, I felt it would be a great loss to people who are cramming for exams be denied of the conducive environment to study. Hahah....I am onli talking on my own behalf.

      I signed up with blogspot on the spur of the moment. I do not know how long would this last. I abandoned my geocities account and my danchan diary corner to start up a new blog with blogspot just for convenience's sake. Hope with the hassle-free tools provided by blogspot, I would update on my entries regularly and diligently.

      I was reading on Artificial Intelligence the whole day today (less than one month to exams). I hated to admit but I am a scatterbrain and am easily distracted. I surfed into flowerpod again and surfed into other people's blogs. My heart just raced when I saw the picturesque designs that they had for their own website. It reminded me of my own self a year ago...busy toying up my free site whenever I have the spare time to do so....   It seems that these days I am too engrossed in studying that I forgot this passion of mine. I realized that I still like web-designing very much though I am not very good in it. I conclude I am an introvert..and a homely person. I don't need to talk much...except that I always need to get my hands or brains moving. You can easily see my confession from my interests: web-designing, maths, cleaning up my room, photography, reading, surfing the site and watching tv...hahah   Talking about TV dramas, I simply love to watch TCS 8&nbsp; 9 pm show...tian yan mi yu...nice nice...The serials is very sweet and for the first time, I love Fiona Xie's acting. Well, in fact&nbsp;it is the show that&nbsp;I form a better impression of her. I love her haircut, her clothings and last but not least, to be the blessed girl in the show. Isn't it fortunate for her to have three&nbsp;admirers showering with love&nbsp;and at the same time, have a virtuous mother to care for her?   *Smacks* Janet! You should wake up from your daydreaming and start revising!   &nbsp;

      I don't know what suddenly come over me and I decided to write a petition to the school. I even coerced Linda and Patrick to join me. Linda was rather enthusiatic and asked a couple of classmates to take a look. However, most guys are not interested. I do not know what was the reason behind. Perhaps I should go and find out.   Patrick had the idea to drop off from the course as he just got to know that the degree course is NOT recognised by SAF. Damn...this news was as bad to him to me. It just shows that the paper is going to be how useful for job seeking next time.   I think I should concentrate on studying on the time being. It is going to examination time soon. 24 days more to be exact and I have not really started studying. My goodness! I better stop surfing the forum for the time being.   GOAL(s) ========  A for AT B for AI

      I managed to settle most of my inter-bank GIRO transactions and other transactions between the banks...after several hours. Kinda hassle but luckily, it is almost over....  I took the initiative to ask him for meal yesterday but alas, it was a wrong move at the wrong time. He was busy and I was hungry. In the end, I went for dinner myself and he had his dinner with his long-time bosom friend...duh! I shared my view on how he handled a matter that concerns about one of our colleagues and somehow I believed that I brought out the optimisim within him. After the short chat with him, I realized that I do not have the chemistry with him...well, at least not anymore. I was wondering whether do we have any in the first place now...Shrugs.  Forget about that...I should concentrate on my studies now, provide my parents a better standard of living and sought for better life partner.   *Calculating* If I am to get married by 29, and pregnant by 30, my child would be at most 20 when I turn 50! Gosh...that sounds old....I better find someone to get married fast! Wahahahha

      Not that I want to brag. After posting the last message, I read upon the last few messages that I posted and I realized that I had taken actions to rectify/improve my "poor" living conditions.   I got myself another bank a/c and I had worked out my own "saving" plans to ensure that my cash inflow and outflow would be balanced. :)  I also got myself re-organized in the sense of my wardrobe, and my studies...  Now what I need to do is to continue my way of savings, concentrate to do well in my studies, and start my ever-procrastinating exercise regime!

      Dad, mum, bro and I went to Chinatown for dim sum today. We were to go to Lao Beijing but I overlooked the fact that the NKF coupon could not be used on high-tea buffet..so there goes our hopes *%#@!  The food at the restaurant was delicious. Well, I am glad that we went as I bet the dim sum that we ate would be of no less quality compared to that of Lao Beijing. Most importantly, dad and mum looked rather happy.  Zec told me that I do not need to work Ot today at the very last minute. In one sense, I felt happy as I do not need to rush to work and work 24 hours NONSTOPPED but on the other hand, I felt sad that I would not be able to earn 2 times OT. Nah...I should comfort myself that I could sit comfortably at home to type my things out rather than at work.  Bro has just gone back to Thailand tonight. Dad and mum decided to send him off although he insisted that we do not need to. I felt that I have too much work to do..so I decide not to go. Moreover, he will be back in a month's time soon too.  I had a shopping haul today. Bought a pair of ballet shoes, facial products and 25 hangers to re-organize my own cupboard. My cupboard seems very much tidier now. All thanks to brother's recommendation to buy the hangers. I realized that mum's remarks on my clothes are indeed true. I really have too much clothes!!! Damn it....I think I have tons of t-shirts in my cupboard. They are practical. I could wear them for daily purposes but as I work, I need more formal kinds of clothes which I do not possess much. On the other hand, I think I should keep a low profile at the moment. I don't want to change my wardrobe overnight. It would be too much...I can survive with mix-and match for the time being.  Read on JH's blog again...she was lamenting over some heart affairs. Sometimes I do think that I know what she means. I am also wondering whether I do feel anything for him. Although I am able to change topics swiftly when he asked me how come I am especially nice towards him, I could not help to wonder why I am so. I just could not help but being nice to him. However, on the other hand, I know if we come together, we would not be able to last long...Our lifestyles are not really accomodating towards each other and our perceptions are not really the same...I believe I do have feelings for him but the feelings have faded away gradually within this past year...I could carry my life on without him in the picture much...though sometimes his image does float into my mind and it brings me warmth. Self-indulgence? Yes it is but it is not a crime.

      Sharon came back from Australia yesterday. She had spent a week there, surveying the university which she intended to attend next year. With bro, I went to the airport and fetched her.    You cannot underestimate a lady who is on shopping spree. Within a week's stay there, she managed to come back with 4 big luggages when she went with only one luggage...I was horrified when she admitted that she had paid aussie 100 plus for her luggages being overloaded.     We went straight to Swensen to have our dinner after we met up....All the three of us were terribly hungry. Well, you can't really blame us to be gluttionous as we were "trained" at home to eat at 6pm sharp... We had baked rice.... And we managed to look through the shots that she had taken while she was in Brisbane and Gold Coast over the dinner.    After dinner, we headed straight back to her home. The taxi uncle was extremely friendly. Sharon, being a sociable person as well, managed to keep the conversation lively with the taxi uncle throughout the ride.     Her cosy house appealed to bro and I so much that we were reluctant to leave. We decided to stay over as both of us did not have events on in the morning. We talked and sorted out her things that she had brought back.....    I am feeling rather guilt-stricken that I have been receiving a lot of gifts from her these recent months...free treats....free clothes and now, expensive presents...I should be giving something back to her these days or else I will definitely be remorseful of my bad attitude.

      It started out with I agreed to Ivy's request to help her to monitor the tickets' queue w/o further thoughts of the consequences of what would happen with one more person less in workforce. Though no one had exactly pinpointed that I was at fault, but from what vijaya's voice..I detected sarcasm which I believed was directed to me. I knew that I was partially at fault so I was pretty downcasted.  Hoping to seek some comfort from someone, I called JH yesterday during the meal break.In the end, I did not manage to bring this matter up to her as we were too busy rattling about the cliche gossipy topic...BGR. This lucky girl always have tons of romance whirls, highly-eligible bachelors under her skirt...We talked for an hour or so and it managed to uplift my spirits. It was that moment that I had the long-lost feeling of feeling how good it was to have friends to bitch about topics that do not revolve around work at least for a moment!  As I came into the office today, I surfed into her blog. I was surprised that she did not mention a lot of things to me in our conversation yesterday. Perhaps all female species are supposed to be emotionally complex creatures. Perhaps it was something to do with her work so she did not say it out...  Nevertheless after reading her blog, I am re-enforced with the fact that I should cherish what I have. I do have a loving family...a stable (though not perfect) job, a bunch of loyal friends that I could count on when I need companionship. And last but not least, my studies..which I think till now suffer no much hiccups along the way...Perhaps the one thing that I am lacked of most now is LOVE. Love that can grow into companionship that can endure sufferings and have fun, which could lead to long-term compatibility. I know what I am lacked of but I am not actively seek for it. I guess my viewing of heart affairs still remains the same over the years: if it is yours, it will come to you...I believe in fate and destiny. Perhaps the ONE for me has not arrived.However, someone dear has reminded me of the fact that I should put in enough efforts to maintain the relationship if it comes...at the right time. Thanks, Linda...

      I read some pple's blogs today. They were once my school/class/project mates but I was not  close to them. As I read one post that was posted by one of them, I was saddened and "jealous" of the fact that the closest pal that I had in my nus days was still a firm friend with her. They still managed to keep a sms-rally when she don't even bother to sms me once unless she faced some problems...I guess I just have to face the fact that friends do come and go...    ***    Initially, I had the feeling that Linda was putting me down when she told me that I should not pushed myself so hard to complete the task given by Bill. However, I guess what she said was rather true as all I had in return was the compliment "Good work done." Maybe I should not have so much expectations at first... high expectations usually result in higher disappointment....    ***    On a brighter note, I saw a shop in my neighbourhood selling 6230 at $398! That is soooo much cheaper than the usual retail price. From what I saw from the signboard, the conditions are about the same as the conditions posted by the usual retail shops. I will keep my fingers crossed. Hopefully it is such the case and I shall buy the phone at a cheaper price then!    My enterprising spirit rose as my financial situation got worse. As I finally got the hang of using yahoo auction (I bought an outdated calculator from there), I decided to auction some of my unused objects off... I took some photos of my clothes with my bro's digital camera and will post them in net later on. ; )

      I have been meeting up with friends this week. It feels good to get in touch with friends.  Met Adeline L on Monday. We had planned to watch SpiderMan 2 initially but I guess she had sensed my disinterest to watch. Therefore, we suggested we go and drink in HV.   After meeting up with my JC gang yesterday, I wondered if we did the right thing by giving the show a miss. They were saying that the graphics are damn nice and cool..I felt a pity to miss the show suddenly. However, action-pacted shows, irregardless of whether it is movie or cartoon, just don't appeal to me.   Adeline T broke the news that she was pregnant for 2 months when we finally caught up yesterday. It turned out some people have really known about it. It was the conversation that we had while they had their dinner in Sushi Tei at Suntec City, do I realise the gap between me and them... I wasn't informed of the latest happenings till the very last moment. This feeling isn't great...  Went to Adeline T's new house after dinner. Well, the fact that this was our first time to her new place, and she, being a non-driver herself, does not help much. We spent nearly an hour on the road figuring out how to go to her house. We reached her house at nearly ten, spent an hour in watching her wedding photos before we left her house to heed home. Her kitchen looked cosy...I liked it the best as it was all PINK! Wooo!                                        ****  Do I have the nerdy and chee-na look? JH and Zec made the same comment that I should change my image. Hmpf...is my image so lousy that I should accept new look? Being a narcisstic person, I was thinking whether it is my character or my image that make them pass such a remark. Though I always smiled and brushed off such comments as if I don't care about them, I could not help but to feel lousy that why am I the only one who is receiving such comments all the time.  Nerdy and poor...what a good combi!  On a more positive note, bro is coming home today. He has lost his hp again and dad decided to check with him whether he has a mobile. If not, I should return his hp to him and my father would give me his 8310 to use. Okie...8310 isn't that new or fantastic but it is better than the 3310. I am aiming to buy 6230 by the end of August so even if I use the 8310 phone, I would return to dad by then.

      I don't know what is wrong with me these days.Well, especially today...I felt extremely down inspite of being quite uplifted the few days earlier.  It is perhaps that I told Linda my tiny secret that I am very tight these days. Well, I tot she could have sympathised me a bit and say something nice by comforting me...Instead, I got a "scolding" from her. I was rather upset by the fact.  I have overspent for the past months, and the fact that my company expenses have not been reimbursed to my bank account isn't that helpful. My pitiful plight just reveals how dependent I am on my current job to sustain my living. :(

I am considering whether I should be joining her as I have the doubts on whether I have the stamina, money and most importantly, money to join her.  I think I wld be seeking tuition assignments first. If I do not find any assignment, I would be considering joining her.

      I finally attended artifical intelligence class after missing it for 2 lessons. I think I did not miss much except that I shld be concentrating on mastering Prolog. Okie...not master...but at least pick the language up as fast as possible.  Linda was passing the remark that I am very skinny. Indeed I know that I am but I think I have grown used and tired of my own skinniness that I did not do much abt it. I was walking home when I started to measure my left wrist with my right fingers...I have grown thinnier indeed! Damn...I wld have to eat carefully these days and make myself grow fatter. This wld be a difficult task...bearing in mind that I AM saving up for my UK trip next year! Haizzz...  Went to Chinatown and shopped for clothings for next yr's trip (a bit ks lah) but then we realised there were not much discounts and so we din buy ANYTHING... We came to a conclusion that we have to buy: a pair of gloves,thermal wear, jacket and cap...

      I wonder if it is really good to have a wide circle of friends rather than a small group of close friends.  If you have a big group of friends, you can choose to meet whoever is free to meet up with you and just go out to have fun. On the other hand, you would not feel comfortable in a sense that you can rely heavily on one person.... Hmmm..I am not very sure whether anyone know what I am talking about but it just suddenly dawned on me after a heart chat with Sharon.....  ****  My ego is really inflated after receiving compliments for two consecutive days .... One was even from a guy and he had mentioned that I am a perfect lady...wahahah... I am so scared that his illusion would be dashed soon....      ****     Anyway, I have already actioned to matchmake him and her together. To think that I felt delighted when I told them about each other...I am wondering whether would I ever feel jealous if they were to be together. *Shrugs* I have made the choice and I should not regretted it.

      It has been a long time since I catch up with the bunch of girls but it is always so enjoyable to meet up with them.  We had our dinner in Fish &amp; Co where I was only updated with Shirley's new relationship then. We moved to Baker's Inn to have our desserts and we had a good laff. Sometimes I miss the days when we were back in secondary school. Days were so good then....  ***  I was thinking whether I should be going to take a week's leave to do a crash study at home. After going out with them, I felt that I am really a no-lifer.... everyday needs to study and work...damn sianz...

      For the first time in the 4 months, I went to Dr Teo's class today. Well, I was an hour late despite the fact that I took a cab down from City Hall. Blame that on my poor time management.  To my surprise, I bumped into Hamka in class. I was so excited upon seeing him in class again that I behaved in an erratic behaviour...my god...I sure have created a damn good impression of myself. As we went out together in class today, he was telling his friend that I was his classmate eight years ago. And I go again, "Eight years? Surely not that long?" I have passed the jc stage that long and I did not realize it... As I recalled that remarks, I felt proud that I still maintained a close relationship with my jc friends...In fact, I am going to JH's house on sunday for BBQ...  In the part-time class today, did I realize that Kay, the ger who always sits in front (the one who I think resembles Sharon), is a financial controller! I am impressed by her dillegence and self-motivation to pick up a skill/degree that is out of her own job scope. It is in fact totally different from what she is doing. Well, I should be motivated to learn from her....
