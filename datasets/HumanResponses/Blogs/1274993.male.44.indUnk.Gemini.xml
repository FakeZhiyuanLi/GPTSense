       I just posted the " Spotlight on: CMHA Education Coach " article to the  urlLink Education Coach  site. It was published in Victoria Update Email Newsletter on July 15, 2002. It is a good introduction to the services Bernice Montgomery offers here in Victoria. Posts as long as this one cause blogger to crash so most of my posts will be shorter.

        Victoria Update June 30, 2002   Contents:  Introduction  Announcements  Web Sights  Spotlight on Movie Monday  “Ordinary People”  Spotlight on NEED Crisis and Information Line ------------------   Weblog Notes:  This was a controversial issue. No one complained about the articles but a link in the Web Sights column offended someone and lead to my including a disclaimer in later issues. The link lead to a review of "Mad in America" by Robert Whitaker.   One link that didn't cause any problems was to the  urlLink Mood Disorders Support Group  of New York City. I have found this group's newsletter to be informative and engaging.  Both  urlLink Movie Monday  and  urlLink NEED  have informative websites.

         Victoria Update Format   The newsletter is published on the 15th and 30th of each month.   -- The newsletter is sent bcc to protect privacy. -- There are no attachments. -- It is sent in the main body of the email.  -- The main font is Arial size 12 and Headers are 14 pt Arial, bold and underlined. This is as fancy as it gets.  -- I send as html but since some people receive as plain text I use solid lines between articles and dashed lines within sections (between different announcements for example). This came as a result of a conversation with Bruce Saunders of  urlLink Movie Monday .  -- The "Subject" of the emails is: Victoria Update (date).

        My idea of posting past issues of the newsletter in this weblog is unworkable at this time. The length (up to eight pages) of the newsletter is the main problem. I will post the table of contents of each issue just as I did when I published the 2002 Index in the newsletter. I will add comments and updates. I will also add links given in the articles. ------  Victoria Update June 15, 2002 .  Contents:  Introduction  Virtual Volunteering  Spotlight on: Regional Mental Health Advocate, Kootenay Boundary Health Area  Special Issue on Newsletters  Announcements  -----  Weblog Notes:   The Virtual Volunteering article was inspired an  urlLink article  in the print version of DigitalJournal.com.  The KBHA is now part of the  urlLink Interior Health Authority . This is the shortest (less than a page) "Spotlight" so far.

        Iraq and the Middle East .  The world's attention is focused on Iraq this week due to the American led invasion. Many people would like to learn more about the country and it's neighbours. While the major news sites offer some background information most of this is related to the present conflict.  While doing research on the Internet within the last year I came across some informative and interesting sites dealing with Iraq and the Middle East.    urlLink Encyclopaedia of the Orient  - This site has maps and a detailed encyclopaedia covering geography, history and culture.   urlLink The CIA World Factbook  - This site is a good source of current information.   urlLink Exploring Ancient World Cultures  - If you wish to research ancient and medieval history this is a great site.  The Metropolitan Museum of Art's " urlLink Timeline Of Art History " - This wonderful site has maps, history articles and examples of art from around the world.

        Weblogs - finale (for a while).   I find weblogs interesting because they offer people fast and easy ways to publish to the Internet. The net is no longer solely the domain of programmers and geeks but of anyone who can access the Internet.  Kevin Werbach's article " urlLink Triumph of the Weblogs " deals with this issue in more detail.

       Welcome to Victoria Update. Here are some more thoughts about Weblogs.   Education Blogs   There are several blogs that deal with education such as  urlLink eduBlogs  and  urlLink eBN  (Educational Bloggers Network). Both of these have links to other sites.  One interesting aspect of these blogs is the ability to share educational materials.  urlLink Commontext 's goal is "to create freely shared, publicly licensed educational materials."

        More About Weblogs   With the right tools Consumers can express themselves in a variety of ways in a weblog. Photographs and artwork can be added to added using  urlLink Blogger Pro  and other programs.  I was following Internet links when I came across  urlLink hoshq.com  (subtitled: a southerner in the far north). While there is nothing to indicate the author is a Consumer the site has some great photos.  From the hoshq site I followed links to the following sites:  The first is called " urlLink nutz'so " and it is "a place where those recovering from mental illness have a voice; a place we can go to listen and be heard".   Some people may be concerned about putting their feelings on the internet. " urlLink A Blogger's Disclaimer " is a good place for blog writer's and their reader's to visit.

         A New Blogger’s Perspective    Refreshing Weblogs   Some of my readers will not be familiar with weblogs.  Posts to weblogs are dated and the homepage is the latest post. If you check a site and don’t see anything new click on the refresh button and the latest post will show itself. If you remember this you won’t miss something interesting.    Post Often/Visit Often   Chapter 2 of “ urlLink We Blog ” recommends that new bloggers post regularly and consistently to hone their skill and attract readers. Like all skills writing will improve with practise. If you are consistent people will know your schedule and look for your posts.    Experiment   With so ways to organize weblogs a blogger is only limited by what he or she wants to do and is willing to learn. Check the help files, read books or ask questions.  Blog readers must experiment also. If one writer’s style or content doesn’t appeal to you another’s will. There are blogs for almost any taste.   Be prepared   Before you begin writing a blog you should make sure your virus scanner is updated and working properly. When I first started writing my blog I clicked on an interesting title in Blogger’s  urlLink Fresh Blogs  listing. McAfee warned me of a virus and I deleted the “temporary internet” file and left the site. If I hadn’t had the latest virus definitions my computer would have been infected. The author of the weblog lost a potential reader.

       Welcome to Victoria Update. I was glad to post "The Will To Publish" and the addendum yesterday. It seems to be my personal mission statement for the newsletter and the weblog. For some reason I can't edit the post to touch it up a bit (eg: highlight my headings) but that is fine.   I added some information to  urlLink Education Coach . More will follow this week.  I revisited some blogs today and noticed my comment had been answered at  urlLink Toast and Coffee . Click on the Sunday, March 09, 2003 posting and click on comments. You will see my comment and Claire's reply. If you want you can even surf back to this weblog.   The more I think about it the more I feel that comments would be a great way to share information on this weblog. Of course sharing information is what Victoria Update is all about.

        The Will To Publish by Leon Rivest  I published my first newsletter when I was nine years old. It was called Star Rocco, after the logo on my favourite hot chocolate mug, and it was two handwritten pages long. In that first issue were reports on comics, books and my GI Joe. I might have continued with the newsletter but my brothers laughed at the effort and my parents didn’t have time to be interested.  I was involved with school newspapers in high school and university. I liked the experience and wanted to be a writer. As things will, life didn’t turn out as I expected. My road to writing/editing was a much longer and circuitous route.  Chance led me to Victoria Update. One day Bernice Montgomery asked me for help and I became involved in the Student Rights Project. Since we needed to keep people informed about our coming symposium I would send out a form letter I called Victoria Update. When the symposium was finished I kept sending out infrequent updates.  One thing I noticed in my dealings with various organizations was the need for communication. When we have something new to say we inform the local newsletters, and newspapers and then email everyone we know. This works to a degree depending on what media people have at their disposal.  The newsletters are good for allowing people to plan ahead. The newspapers are good for getting information out when it is needed quickly. Email is fine except that many of us already receive a lot of mail. Furthermore, some people treat emails as if they are long distance calls on hold. Not every email is a priority.  When I was reorganizing Victoria Update in June I kept thinking about communication. How could I create a useful vehicle for sharing information? I knew I wanted to use email but in another form. Victoria Update’s medium of distribution is email but its method/message is that of a newsletter. This allows a fast method of dispersal but a more coherent form of communication.  There are still limitations in using this form of communication. I have to govern how often to publish by balancing medium versus message. If information comes too fast it becomes spam in your inbox. If the information comes too late it is irrelevant. Another issue is that the newsletter is only available to those who have access to email or to a copy printed by someone who has access. I am looking into a fax edition but this won’t be in the near future.  One benefit of producing a newsletter this way is in organizing and printing it. I write and organize the newsletter in Works and then copy/paste into Outlook Express. My only concerns are clarity and a readable font. I don’t have to worry about pictures or colours.  In a way I am acting out one of my childhood dreams. Like all dreams it is modified by circumstance. Many things have changed since my first newsletter. The one thing that has remained constant is a love of communication.    © 2002 Leon Rivest --------------- March 2003 Addendum  "The Will To Publish" was the feature article in Victoria Update Email Newsletter on July 30th, 2002. The rest of the issue focused on newsletters dealing with mental health. Later on I published it at myhiddentalent.com - a Website for aspiring writers. The article has been a favourite in the Nonfiction section - frequently rating in the top twenty (out of five hundred or so articles).  I have been thinking about this essay quite often since I began a weblog. I realized that although my medium has changed my message has remained the same. I am still informing people about education and mental health.   The dream continues.

        Here are the weblogs that I used as examples in the "Victoria Update And Other Weblogs" newsletter article.    urlLink Free Dartmouth  -- a forum for "liberal thinkers" and "activists" at Dartmouth College. (Hanover, New Hampshire).   urlLink Kevin Sites Blog  -- from a reporter who is (at this time) in Iran at the border with Iraqi Kurdistan    urlLink Working Drafts  -- from a reporter who is (at this time) aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt in the Eastern Mediterranean.   urlLink GeekPress -- an example of a blog specializing in links to online articles.   urlLink Ordinary Boy  - a weblog by a bipolar guy. Contains strong language and content.   urlLink McBible Prayer Requests  -- an example of Christian blogging.

        Victoria Update News   On Thursday March 13th  urlLink Camosun College  held Open House 2003 at Interurban Campus. Bernice Montgomery (the CMHA -  urlLink Education Coach ) and I shared an information table. We also attended a fine luncheon put on by the  urlLink School Of Access Programs And First Nations . I had a great time.  The latest Victoria Update Email Newsletter was emailed Saturday night (March 15th). It is eight pages long. Here is the list of contents:   Contents   Introduction Announcements Blame it on Movie Monday Movie Monday by Bruce Saunders Camosun College Open House -- APFN luncheon Transitions For Students by Leon Rivest  Victoria Update And Other Weblogs  What's New Online - a new column summarizing the latest weblog postings. Expressions: Two Poems To Welcome Spring by Leon Rivest -------------------------- The newsletter was sent as plain text because of a corrupted mshtml.dll file. Later on I managed to fix the problem. This  urlLink issue  is addressed on the Microsoft website.  Leon Rivest, Editor   urlLink Email Victoria Update .

       Sometimes it does pay to surf the net. I was following the trail of blogs through various directories when I came across a blog from right here in Victoria. After browsing  urlLink Toast and Coffee    for a while I found the  urlLink Canadian Phrasebook . We don't often think of our way of speaking as a dialect. Usually it isn't until we travel and find ourselves misunderstood that we realize this.

       I have been doing research online for the next issue of Victoria Update Email Newsletter. I checked  urlLink Blogdex  and noticed an interesting link to a  urlLink Christian Science Monitor article  called  "English Sans French".  This tongue - in - cheek article shows how different English would be without French words. It is a reminder that English has borrowed words from many languages, especially French, Latin, and Greek.

         (continued from previous post)   Other comments:    The Student Rights Project developed from discussions between Bernice Montgomery, the Education Coach at CMHA - Victoria, and Heather McKee, Project Manager, CMHA National Promoting the Rights of Students with Psychiatric Disabilities project.  I joined the project in March 2001 and began to paraphrase the national name in memos and e-mails. The name caught on and we decided to make it official.  Our initial goal was to organize a symposium focusing on local services available to student consumers. We achieved this goal and held our symposium at Camosun College in October 2001.  To read a review visit: (weblog: see link above)  Victoria Update began as a form letter to participants and partners involved in the symposium. Over the last year the update has evolved as we provided a wider range of information and news about local events. We want to continue this evolution and produce a useful and informative e - mail newsletter.  Currently 29 individuals and organizations from across Canada are on our mailing list.

        (continued from previous post)   Spotlight   Spotlight is a series of mini profiles of member organizations and individuals. Since most of the organizations in Victoria are familiar with each other I will focus on out of town members. However, I thought it would be useful to begin by introducing myself and the Student Rights Project.   Spotlight on: Student Rights Project    Contact Person:  Leon Rivest   Organization:  Student Rights Project   E-mail:  (removed for weblog edition)   City:  Victoria, BC   What does your organization do?

Based in Victoria we share some services such as: a mailing address, accounting, fax, and photocopying with the local CMHA office. Generally we work from home and communicate via e - mail.  Our Goal is to: promote education and communication within the mental health community. We do this by:   Participating in information fairs, symposiums, and conferences.  Conducting Internet research and sharing information.  Publishing an e-mail newsletter.   What do you do?   I have two roles in the organization.

       Welcome to Victoria Update. I am starting to post the back issues of the email newsletter. The  June 11, 2003  issue was the first real issue of Victoria Update. Some changes to note in this weblog version are that I don't give out any email addresses; the mailing list is for members only; and many of the essay articles in Victoria Update have since been republished at  urlLink myhiddentalent.com  and are copyright protected.    Membership clarification:  Members are those who receive Victoria Update and agree to not spam any member or any organization listed in the newsletter. Members also agree to not distribute the mailing list to non members. Organizations may choose to be included in the mailing list. Individuals never are.   "free and accessible"  means members may print the newsletter for themselves and their clients/students. If members (and readers of this weblog) wish to reprint articles please email me.  Click here to Visit the  urlLink CMHA  site and view the symposium article. Follow the links to  "Partners","Symposium Committee", " November 2001" or cut and paste the url given in the article. ------  Victoria Update: June 11, 2002   Contents:  Introduction  Victoria Update Facts and Membership  Mailing List  Spotlight on Student Rights Project  Introduction:  Welcome to Victoria Update June 11, 2002 edition.   This a special issue is intended as an introduction to the newsletter. On June 15 I will send a brief issue dealing with upcoming local events. There may be a Spotlight article. On June 30 (approximately) I will send a regular issue. After that issues will come out on the 15th and 30th of each month.  Note: If you receive this e-mail you are a member! Let me know if you want to change your Membership information or need a clarification.  Welcome Aboard! Leon Rivest, Editor  Victoria Update  Victoria Update is a free and accessible e-mail newsletter available to members.  “free and accessible”: You may post, e-mail, and print the newsletter for the benefit of your staff and clients. If you wish to include articles in a published newsletter please ask first.  Membership is free. All I require is:   An Organization Name - if applicable   A Contact Person - preferably listing first and last name. (the last name is optional)   An E-mail Address   You can choose to Terminate Membership at any time. I will simply remove your Entry from my address book.  Our Golden Rule: By becoming a member you agree to not spam fellow members.   This will apply to me too. I plan on no more than 1 or 2 issues a month.  Format: The newsletter will be in the main body of the e - mail. The e-mail Subject Heading will read Victoria Update (and a date).  There will be no attachments. Attachments (e.g.: .doc files) may be used to submit articles. Be aware that your formatting will probably suffer when it is converted into plain text. I plan to send as Html but many organizations use plain text.  You may request articles from me sent as attachments. Please tell me what type of file (e.g.: WordPerfect 7, Word 2000) and I may be able to help.   Archives: Each issue will be saved on disks.  Mailing List: I may distribute the mailing list if there are no objections. Your organizations e-mail address is probably already on brochures, business cards, etc. The mailing list would only be distributed to members. Only members would appear on the mailing list.  New Members will be introduced in the newsletter and they would receive a current mailing list.  To protect the privacy of individual members (clients, students, etc) I will exclude their names if requested.  Feedback and Submissions are appreciated.

        Easy Website Creation For Clients   I just created a web site called:  urlLink The Shelby Fan Club . I wanted to see how easy it was to use a basic, online, website creation program.  It took around 1 1/2 hours because I kept puttering with it. It would have been quicker if I didn't have to recheck the street address and phone number and other facts. Writing the "disclaimer" also took some time. A website for a client would take much less time to create.   Many consumers would love to express themselves online. Many are not computer literate. Anything that can make people want to learn is valuable.   " urlLink Walkers in Darkness " makes it easy to make a website. This ease of use encourages people to try. Check out the user pages and you will agree with me.   Some clients may need help with this. A provider/volunteer who is patient and knows a little about computers can help someone express themselves and feel proud of their achievement.  I have a confession to make. Although I have made linked html photo albums and a home page in FrontPage Express I had never created a full website and uploaded it to the web. Now I can say I made a site using basic templates and had  someone  or  some machine  upload it to the web! The point is: I made a website and others can too.  Now people can learn about Shelby and I can surprise her owner. You see, I didn't tell my boss......

       Learning can be fast or slow. I have been having trouble accessing the blogger help section. It is sooo slow or offline. I saw  urlLink Click On Chris  and posted my first comment. I then followed the link to  urlLink BlogOut  and now have a resource to use if I want to. I may add comments in the future.  "Click, Click, Learn!" -- sounds like a company slogan!

       Welcome to Victoria Update. I am working on a project that I thought about this weekend. I am working as a mini - Webmaster for my friend Bernice Montgomery. The new weblog  is:  urlLink Education Coach .   Hopefully this will allow information about Bernice's services to reach more people. It will complement the website of the organization she works for. Bernice and I will work out the format and the disclaimer statement and other details. Bernice is unfamiliar with weblogs and so we will be emailing information back and forth. If and when Bernice wants to try editing her own material I will invite her as another user. (When I learn how) ---- The third of my experiments (besides these two weblogs) is joining a hosted website service for mental health consumers and making a simple webpage. More details on that later.

Some prefer the term “user” but I feel that “Consumer” implies that we 	have choices.    A Mini Manifesto   Victoria Update’s goal is to promote education and communication within the mental health community. Dialogue among consumers, providers and the general public is always encouraged.   Education    --Consumers are encouraged to pursue all forms of education - from upgrading to post graduate courses.  --Literacy is important.  --Computer Literacy is important.   Communication   --Self-expression is healthy. Getting our ideas and feelings out helps us heal and promotes interaction with others.  --Social Interaction is important. Victoria Update wants consumers to know that they are not alone and that isolation doesn’t have to be endured.  --Consumers can make valuable contributions to their community through work, education and/or volunteerism. In doing so consumers help themselves and others.  --Knowledge is valuable. Sharing information within the community helps all of us. Find out what you need and pass on information to others. You will feel empowered.   Dedication   This weblog is dedicated to the readers of Victoria Update Email Newsletter. Your encouragement and support have been wonderful.   Leon

       Welcome to Victoria Update.   My name is Leon Rivest and I live in Victoria, BC, Canada. I edit and publish Victoria Update.  Victoria Update Email Newsletter began as an infrequent series of emails from the Student Rights Project to agencies and individuals interested in our syposium. On June 11, 2002 I reworked the newsletter and began publishing on the 15th and 30th of each month. Currently Victoria Update is distributed by email across Canada and to England.  Victoria Update's purpose is to "Promote education and communication within the Mental Health Community". I hope that the weblog version of Victoria Update continues to fulfill this purpose.  More information will be posted as I develop this weblog.

        Welcome to Victoria Update. I have been doing Internet research to find websites that would be appropiate for UpdateLinks. One area I plan to expand is called "Education Resource Links" and will cover online glossaries, encyclopedias and so on. I hope to provide many links but there probably won't be as many as those listed by 'Walker's in Darkness' - they list 753!   We often think of content being free to use or copyrighted and thus unavailable unless we ask permission or pay a fee.  urlLink Creative Commons  offers licenses that help you retain your copyright while allowing certain exceptions to it, upon certain conditions.

         Spotlight on: Higher Education Project    Contact Person:  Heather McKee   Organization:  Promoting the Rights of Students with Psychiatric Disabilities, Canadian Mental Health Association National Office    Email:  N/A   City:  Toronto, Ontario    What does your organization do?    The project was funded for two years to make a web site with information on student's rights in college and university and to partner with consumer/survivor groups across Canada. The purpose of the partnerships was to help these groups develop their abilities and skills to educate consumers and the public about our rights (through forums like this very e-newsletter!)    What do you do?    My official title is Project Manager which means that I do a little bit of everything, including, building partnerships with consumer/survivor groups, overseeing the development of the web site, researching and writing information for the web site, making presentations at conferences on the work we have done, and all the office-type work, like sending in budget reports to the funder.   When did you start on the project?    I started on the current project when it began in September 2000. This project actually built upon an earlier project, which I also worked on, where we partnered with disability service professionals in the colleges and universities. It was great to be directly involved with the higher education sector in that project, but one thing that we found was that there are so many consumer/survivors in the community at large who are not aware that they have the right to receive support and some financial aid and this, in part, holds them back from college and university. Recognizing that unmet need was what lead to the proposal to the funder for the current project.    What have you accomplished?    I hope we have accomplished quite a lot! We have built a web site from scratch using some of the most important information that a college or university student who has a mental health problem needs to know. For example: how to pay for school, get support and accommodations from your school, and how to reach out to peers and others who are going through the same issues. We also formed some great partnerships with consumer/survivor groups across Canada who went out and did the hard work of education and advocacy with local colleges and universities. Hopefully, the local activities and even the web site will continue after the formal end of the project.   What still needs to be done?   Lots! It's a very interesting time in the higher education sector right now. When I first started working on this area, there was hardly any information out there on consumer's needs and issues. Now, four years and two projects later, I am coming across news stories and activities taking place all the time. That's the good news. Despite this, the actual level of support to individual student/consumers remains uneven. It seems to depend completely on your good (or otherwise) luck whether or not you receive support. The key remains having access to a skilled advocate, someone who works within the mental health or higher education system, who knows how the system works and can help you out with financial aid and other supports. The problem is that very few consumers have a connection with such a person. Being able to access an education, including access to any specific supports we may need as consumers, should be a right, not a result of chance. That is the goal that we still to have to fight for.   What was the best part of your job?    Traveling all across Canada, Victoria, Prince George, Vancouver, and Halifax, to meet with consumer/survivor partners was wonderful. Having the chance for all the partners to be together and meet for at least one day was also wonderful.    What are your future plans?   CMHA is submitting a proposal for a project for youth with mental health problems in high school. The idea for the project is based on the feedback we have heard in the current project to start educating consumers well before the end of high school about their rights and opportunities to attend college and university. If the proposal is successful (i.e., if the funder agrees to fund it), I hope to be involved in that. Beyond that, my own plans are to take some time kayaking on a very calm river in southern Ontario, a vacation away from web sites and e-mail!    Other comments:    It's wonderful that Victoria is keeping up the great work that they have started with this newsletter. It's so important to keep up the momentum for change, and this newsletter will help to lead to improvements in the lives of students with psychiatric disabilities.

        Student Rights Project - a busy year.   CMHA National’s Higher Education Project is done on July 30th. Bernice Montgomery and Leon Rivest have worked with Heather McKee, the Project Manager, since March of 2001.We managed to accomplish a lot and met many interesting people.   We conducted Internet research and created resource materials for consumers interested in post secondary education.   We attended two conferences in Vancouver.  We participated in numerous information fairs including: “Celebrating Mental Health” at the Downtown Community Activity Centre; Camosun College’s “Welcome Week“; and the University of Victoria’s “Disability Awareness Day“.  We hosted a symposium “Promoting the Rights of Students with Psychiatric Disabilities” in October at Camosun College.  Bernice was a panel member at UVic’s symposium on “Disability Awareness Day”  We helped organize this years “Celebrating Mental Health” information fair.  Leon is continuing to publish “Victoria Update”, our email newsletter.  Thanks to all of the people who have helped us over the last year. The project may be over but the work continues!

        The Magic Of Spelling  by Leon Rivest  English is a wonderfully weird language. Different words can mean the same thing and the same word can have different meanings. For example: the word spell can mean, among other things, putting letters in order to form words, or a word or formula that has magical power. Because of human nature sometimes these meanings get mixed up.  Spelling is a concern for students and writers of all types. The reason for this is that a misspelled word can distort the message being presented. Readers may be insulted, essay marks may be lost, and the writer may appear ignorant or careless. Is it any wonder that writers have wished for a magical, or at least magic like, solution to the problem.  If magic were real we could use it to manage our spelling and grammar.   Magic in fiction often stresses the importance of using the proper formula to cast a spell. I haven’t come across a story that relates specifically to spelling but I recommend “The Last Wizard” by Avram Davidson.  Instead of magic we rely on technology to help us. One of the most useful developments in word processing has been the spell check feature. With little effort a writer can use the feature to analyze his or her document. Spell checkers are very popular. In “Alphabet To Email” Naomi S. Baron writes: “Spelling, of course, is left to spellcheckers. Most of my university students - except the international ones - don’t own a dictionary” (Pg. 100).  There is a caveat however. The spell checker is not always correct. The program can only fix words that it recognizes. Sometimes it tries to fix what is correct. Canadians are faced with the dilemma of using American spelling or keeping a dictionary handy because most spell checkers use American dictionaries. Check whether your word processing program supports a Canadian dictionary.  Spell checkers are useful but they can make a mess of your writing. The following poem will pass a spell check!  Owed to a Spell in Checker...  I have a spell in checker,  It came with my Pea C  It plane lee marks four my revue  Miss steaks eye can knot sea.  It is easy to see that a writer still has to have some knowledge of grammar. It’s also a good idea to have a dictionary and possibly a thesaurus and a basic grammar book. If you’re like me and have an old dictionary (mine doesn’t even list email) you can check out online dictionaries. The writer can still use spell check but shouldn’t be dependent on it.  Writing often seems like magic. Little marks are made on a piece of paper or computer screen and we can understand them. With a click of a mouse we can change the words into something common or something exotic. By understanding the magic of spelling we can keep our words correct and our ideas clear.

       I came across an interesting post in  urlLink Ordinary Boy  in which the author comments about  urlLink Canadian English . This reminded me of an article I wrote for the newsletter and I will post it shortly.  English is weird no matter how it is spelled. Can you pronounce "ghoakn"?  - gh = f as in enough  - oa = o as in loan  - kn = silent k + n as in know  Therefore ghoakn = phone. Ring, Ring it's for you!

        Linking To Specific Posts  The March 30 issue of Victoria Update Email Newsletter had another instalment of “What’s New Online” my column about this Weblog. I covered such things as the comment system and the links page. One item I would like to add covers links to specific posts.   Every post in this Weblog is followed by the time it was posted. This time - stamp is a hyperlink that can be used to link to that post. If you right - click on the “11.17pm” time - stamp of the post above and select properties you will see that the address (url) is: http://victoriaupdate.blogspot.com/2003_04_01_victoriaupdate _archive.html#91828542. This is that posts “www” address.  This means that any post in this Weblog can be linked to. For example I can create a link to my “ urlLink Victoria Update Mini - Guide to Victoria, BC .”

One item I thought interesting was a PowerPoint presentation by a second grader named  urlLink Darrick . Even young students can do amazing things if given the right tools.

        Wild Web   Issue 33 of  urlLink Web Pages Made Easy  certainly provided me with many design sources. The article "Make A Site For Free" provided Cooltext.com and many other free resource sites.  I was especially looking for ideas about templates and found lots of information. While I enjoyed looking at the fancy Flash templates I found the subtle ones more appealing.  urlLink The Open Source Web Design  site offers templates that are similar to Blogger templates. Check out the  urlLink Blogger Template Contest Winners  and compare them to the OSWD ones.  Another magazine ( urlLink PC Utilities #34 ) provided me with a free copy of Xara Webstyle 2. This program allows you to make navigation bars, buttons and even banner ads. I have been playing with it for days.  All this will be useful later in the year when I hope to take a web design course. Right now it just sparks my creativity and aids in my search for useful websites.

         Going Graphical    I have been playing with several web design programs and visiting various websites dedicated to web graphics. I think this started when I used CoolText.com to create Victoria Update logos and buttons. I have played with Computer Graphics ever since I first opened the Paint program on my old 486 computer. I once even wrote an article called Self - Expression and Self -Therapy (Victoria Update Aug. 30, 2002) about creating graphics and music on the computer.

         Events    REES Network hosted a very good conference on May 1st here in Victoria. The theme was: Vocational Rehabilitation: Opportunities & Options for Developing Skills, Learning, and Earning. There were a number of interesting speakers. REES holds two conferences a year - one in the Spring and one in the Fall.    Playing with Linux    Issue 34 of  urlLink PC Utilities  has a cd with the full " urlLink Knoppix  KDE 3.1" version of Linux that will run from the CD. This means that you can sample Linux without installing anything. All of the included programs are useable but the email/web browsers probably aren't worth setting up. Because the system runs in RAM nothing is saved when you exit and all the work of getting setup online would be lost. The disc is still worth checking out.    TextShield Fusion    This is a small and powerfull wordprocessor that can do everything that the Works wordprocessor can do except tables.  urlLink TextShield Fusion  is free!

        Research, Google and Victoria Update.   I was not tired so I did some research on online journals/diaries and how they differ from blogs. I also did a Google search of Victoria Update, Education Coach and UpdateLinks. I will publish the results and my comments in the newsletter and then reprint them here.   I also found some interesting information concerning foreign organizations and upcoming education projects. I will post more about this later.  Now for the second Blogger test.  This should publish immediately.

        Retesting Blogger   I noticed that a post didn't seem to be loading Friday. When I went to check things out I edited the "control post" instead of making a new post. (This is an example of why one shouldn't blog when tired).  Things may be working properly. The archives seem to be working now too. Now when my comment provider is done maintenance I can have "shout out" instead of "closed for maintenance".   I will follow this post with another in a few moments.

        Playing Tourist   I visited some interesting places in Whitehorse, Yukon this week. I went to the "Old Log Church Museum "(I had been there before) and the "Yukon Transportation Museum" and the  urlLink "Yukon Beringia  Interpretive Centre" . Playing tourist is fun. I am also having a good visit with my family.   I am writing this in Dawson City, Yukon, where my mother was born and raised. The buildings and people are part of my history. I worked up here years ago for one summer and everyone treated me like a local. One of the good things about this current visit is that I can see how I have changed over the years. Self - evaluation can be a way of maintaining your mental health.

        Happy Canada Day!   It seems that things are back to normal with the comment system. I am not sure if it is as useful as I thought it would be. All of the "shouts" have been posted by myself or people who wanted to know what I meant by "a comment system." As a feedback tool for this blog the system is being wasted. As a teaching tool it is more of a novelty than a true lesson.    Weblog Workshops?   I may design and present a workshop on weblogs and online journals/diaries this year. I have shown one person how to blog. Maybe other people in Victoria would like to learn.

        Journal Writer   I have created a  urlLink Diaryland  account to serve as an example of an online diary. It is called  urlLink Journal Writer . It will be a great way to contrast weblogs and diaries. I have done some editing of the template but it remains a light purple. I also have to set my email and decide if I am going to borrow a template created by others or continue to work on the existing one.  One item I am concerned about is the url. I tried various combinations but they were either used or too long.  I  created  one 'good' name  yesterday  and  Diaryland  accepted it  but  the confirmation got lost in the mail. I would have liked to have had a matching  url and name (like I do here). I may try another combination but I dont want to have three or four dead journals lying around. One consolation is that the url matches my name.

        Doing Maintenance   I am rethinking different aspects of this blog and getting an idea of what changes to make.   Links   I have been checking links and most of them are still valid. I will provide new links as well.   Comment System   I will leave the broken comment system alone for now. I can use it as an example in the workshop. I may replace it with one from another company but this would require some thought and preparation. Very few people used the system when it did work.   Workshop   This blog will be used to research and design components of my journaling workshop. Of course most of the work will be done in a word processing program and saved to my hard drive.    Email   I will leave the email as is for now.   New Diary   Instead of a generic “demo” diary site like I planned I will create a diary about editing the newsletter. I will post reprints of articles from the newsletter and maybe some new stuff. The diary will be both an example for the workshop and a useful complement to this weblog.   One of my reasons for doing this is my frustration with posting long posts to this site in the past.   Education Coach   I will probably delete the site after I copy some parts of it to this site.    UpdateLinks    I will update links and add new ones. It will remain this site's link page. I may eventually delete it after transfering the information to the diary.   Newsletter and Website   If I am planning on doing all of this work I may have to rethink my plans for these projects. (Again!)   Conclusion   These ideas will develop over time and I may not even use some of them.

        Reviving The Blog   I decided to revive this blog to a certain degree. I am seriously thinking about teaching a workshop on paper and online journaling. I would like to use this site as an example in my workshop. I was worried that Blogger would pull the plug on this site due to inactivity.  I want to publish a few more issues of the e-mail newsletter before I close it down for good. The newsletter, like this journal, has stalled.   I had computer problems in November and reinstalled Windows. Later on I installed  urlLink Xandros  Linux and then upgraded. This combined with the holidays meant I had little time for the newsletter.  I have been busy volunteering and keeping a personal journal. Occasionally I would visit this blog and feel like I accomplished something here. I think this was/is a good experiment.   That's it for now.

        Goodbye Education Coach   It's strange to feel a loss when you delete a weblog. A "child" of mine is gone (sniff, sniff). The blog wasn't a problem but it wasn't going anywhere. Now I can use the space for other projects.  The comment system is also gone. I had to repost an entry from each archived month to get everything cleared.  I will update UpdateLinks in the near future. Keep an eye out for my new blog about Victoria.

I have reprinted the latter here. Later on I could make a blog just for the all the Spotlights that were done. We shall see.   I tried to make a title for this post using Blogger's new titling system but it doesn't seem to work on these old templates.

        Spotlight on: CMHA Education Coach    Contact Person:  Bernice Montgomery   Organization:    Capital Mental Health Association 125 Skinner Street Victoria, BC, V9A 6X4 Telephone 389-1410   Email:  N/A   When did you start as Education Coach?   I began working at CMHA in 1996. Before that I had worked for many years in the public school system and adult education. Previously to CMHA I had worked for Goodwill Industries.   What do you do?   Basically my job is to assist adults with psychiatric disabilities to be successful students and learners in the environment of their choice. So a lot of my time is taken with individual consultations with clients in which they explore their educational goals and make plans to accomplish these. Clients most often want information about their educational options. Once a person has decided how it is that they want to pursue their goals I may assist them in a variety of ways. Sometimes we will go together to Camosun College or UVic for an appointment or assessment or just to visit and become familiar with campus. I encourage students to connect with disability support services that are available on campus. Sometimes students will develop an independent learning plan for themselves if they do not feel comfortable in a formal learning environment. Once a student is enrolled in a program or course or has a learning plan I am available to them for consultation on study skills, perhaps time management or tutoring, or just a sympathetic ear.   Another big part of my job is to promote education and training to consumers. So I meet with groups and participate in forums that promote the rights of students with psychiatric disability.    What is the Community Scholar Program?   The Community Scholar Program was developed to provide a place and time for people to assess their particular learning skills, to practice reading, writing, math and basic computer skills, or to develop and participate in a group activity such as a writing group or study group. Often people will use the CSP to prepare for a formal assessment or course or receive tutoring in a particular area of learning. This program is strictly drop in and has no formal referral process or registration. Anyone who is interested in doing reading, writing, math or using the computer is invited to come by any Wednesday between 1:30 and 3:30.    Who are your cliental?    The Education Coach Program has served people between 18 and 65, people with practically no formal education and people who are working on postgraduate degrees. Most clients are attending or planning to attend a program or a course at any of the numerous schools and colleges in the community, many are poets and writers working on individual projects and others are in the process of deciding what they want to do.   What is the best part of your job?    Everything about my job is the best part whether I am promoting adult education, advocating for the rights of students with psychiatric disability, talking with individual clients or assisting an individual to figure out a math equation. I am an education zealot and think of learning as being as broad as the world and as long as a lifetime.   What is the most challenging part of your job?   Sometimes the most challenging part of my job is convincing people that they are entitled to education and that they can shape their education to suit their needs and aspirations. I often tell clients two things:   1. Once you begin schooling you will do it for the rest of your life because education comes in an unlimited number of ways and  2. the more you learn, the more you learn.   How did you become involved in the Student Rights Project?   I became involved in the Student Rights Project after meeting with Heather McKee from Canadian Mental Health Association, National Office and connecting with Leon for the first Mental Health Fair in Victoria.    What are you going to do on your leave of absence?   I plan to relocate to Whitehorse from September to February. I want to spend time with my brand new granddaughter and return to classroom teaching. I hope to come back to education coaching with a better understanding of new developments in secondary and post secondary education ------------ Published in Victoria Update Email Newsletter (July 15, 2002).

       I thought I would experiment with the "Blog This" feature that can be added to  your web browser.  The following is an interesting (and pretty) site full of graphics.    urlLink Graphic Garden

       I have been working hard on 'Journal Writer'. I finished the large ' urlLink Links ' page and readers of Victoria Update will find many of the links quite useful. There are no Mental Health links but many writing ones. I will link to the page from UpdateLinks and this will allow me to streamline that site when I redo it.   I will post some Mental Health material here when I am less busy with the new journal.

       I have completed the editing and republishing of UpdateLinks - Victoria Update's links page. Sites referred to at Routes Victoria or Journal Writer have been removed. Some new links have been added. I also changed the template.   UpdateLinks' main focus is on Mental Health and Education Links.

       I decided to change templates to take advantage of Blogger's new features. Please let me know what you think. The  urlLink UpdateLinks  and  urlLink Email  links on the sidebar may be down while I putter.  I am also activating the comment system. However this will only effect the posts that have been edited recently.
