       Today was just like any other day, received several calls from amber in the morning, I don’t want to answer her calls. Last night she pissed me off, acting like me talking to another girl was like cheating on her. Screw this crap, I really don’t know what I'm doing anymore. It’s starting to piss me off. She WONT leave me alone and I don’t have the heart to tell her I don’t want to talk to her. I miss Tammie like nuts, why won’t she just tell me to leave amber, and move in and be with me. God I can’t take this anymore, I need Tammie so bad….I love her. I’m talking to amber as I write this, I cant stand her yet I can’t tell her, I just wish god would give me a sign, tell me wither or not I should wait for Tammie, and give me the strength to tell amber. If only I could see the future. I’m going go to bed, and try to get amber to hang up, until tomorrow, l8ter

       What a day, shitty of course. I stayed yesterday night with amber…I really am starting not to be able to stand her. BADLY I can’t stand it no more, she really pissed me off today acting like me playing around with a few co-workers meant I was gona sleep with them. SCREW THAT, she’s starting to remind me of Melissa, her house is a mess, EXACTLY the way I remember Melissa’s..odd eh. I miss Tammie so badly it hurts, the only reason I decided to stay the night, that’s right I wasn’t going to at first, was the fact that I had to drive to the hospital to get my son’s shot records. Well who did I see but Tammie herself, hanging out with her boyfriend, I cried, got pissed, cried some more. I’m tried of that, what the hell am I supposed to do when I fee this way. It really hurts me when she says she loves me yet can spend a day with him at work, what the fuck am I…chopped liver? I feel like I will never find anyone who feels and needs like I do. Tammie is so perfect yet I feel sometimes she just wants attention from me, the attention she don’t get from Scottie. OH WELL, not like that’s anything unusual in my life, sucking as usual. Well I am staying home tonight, when amber calls me I am gona break it off, tired of this shit, I will not go through with amber what I went through with my ex-wife. As far as Tammie, I am gona wait and see, I just hope she comes around and realizes what a man I can be to her. For gods sake I won’t even let her come over here because I am afraid of kissing her, because I'm dating someone. What must I do to prove myself to this woman is beyond me. Well I’m gona go cook something, my son should be down here in a few days, and I miss him badly. That’s if for everything of interest today, as you can see if I had a good love life, my life would be perfect..sad eh. L8ter

       GOD what a day, sleep till 10:30 so I was tired all day, first thing off the bat I get a wake up call from Tammie. Though I know she means well I don't think she understands me. I CAN NOT continue seeing her the way we have and not be able to hold her at night. I do love her but I just cant put myself back in that kind of situation where I lay in my bed, awake all night hoping that she's packing her things and will be knocking at my door any minute. I think she's upset with me now because I won’t give in this time. She tries to blame herself for this but it’s not that, I just refuse to do that again. I talked to her and it made me late for work, mostly cus I did not want to let her go being mad at me, she can be rather hateful to my feelings when she's mad and may do something rash. Got to work around 2:30 pm, and boy did it suck today. Amber works with me, and was a grouch all day. For some reason she does not like me to complement her at all. I'm not that attracted to her but I do find her good looking, I just don't see this relationship going anywhere. As for the rest of the day, one of my mangers who has a habit of causing problems told me that a door greeter called her last night and wants to have a "conventional relationship" with her. Problem is he's married, and I find that ridicules because this guy doesn’t seem the type to cheat on his wife, though when I left work around 11:15, they where at her car talking, so who knows. Amber wouldn’t even say bye when she left so whatever, I'm about done with her. She's all about having sex but wont give me her emotions and attention, and that’s what I need. Sure she did at first, but now..It’s just all about my body lol. Rather strange to say that, I’ve never found myself attractive, but evidently I am..and good in bed =P. For the past few weeks this older women, who I would guess is about 35, has been coming in having long conversations with me. Come to find out she asked one of the night shift girls to get my phone number. She’s very attractive for her age, one of the more attractive females I’ve seen. So I gave it to her, and hope she calls soon considering what’s going on with amber, I need someone to talk to. Only thing is..she is married. He’s very mean, she’s not allowed inside the house after she gets off work till he gets home, and she’s not allowed to sleep in his bed. Sad men like that exist out there. But if she has a good heart, and will treat me right for more than a few weeks, or months, you never know. I would rather date older women anyway, mainly because they understand me better and have the mature level I need. I’m not into parties, drinking or any crap like that, I just want someone to hold me at night and likes sex as much as me lol. Anyway that’s my day, maybe tomorrow will be brighter. L8ter

       I guess I just want a way to express myself without people looking at me like I'm nuts, even though sometimes I look at myself this way. You see I’m going through a hard time in my life. I just got divorced as of July 22 this year, I’m in love with a women who has a boyfriend and lives with him, and I’m dating someone who treats me like gold but yet my fellings for her are dwarfed by my feelings for the other. See my confusion? Just like today, today is the annual fair here in our little town of Petersburg and of course I would like to go. Tammie, the women who has a Boyfriend, is in fact going with him to this parade they are having. Now why would I get jealous is beyond me but I did and am still. Yet she says she loves me, how in fact can she I will never understand but none the less I do believe what she tells me, though she thinks otherwise. She had asked me to go to the fair but common, how could I go with her after she was hanging out with him. Oh and the other women, amber. She wants me to go with her and her kids but, I don’t feel that I should when the other will be there as well. Alas, some day maybe all my dreams will come true, and I'll understand what im feeling, perhaps. I need to go groceries shopping so I’m out of here, l8ter.
