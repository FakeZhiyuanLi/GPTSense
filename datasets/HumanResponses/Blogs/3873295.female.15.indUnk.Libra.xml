       Why must summer holidays be so boring? Most of my friends are in germany. I really hate this. But lucky for me i have Final Fantasy x-2 (like finally). I missed out a lot already, but who cares. I really like Yuna. But the guys, Gippal and Baralai are so cute *drools*. Although they're just animations, i think they are so cute. But still my number one guy is Kei-chan *squels*

       Just seeing them on tv makes me think of them even more than ever...lol. Keita's the best. Who are w-inds? They're a group of three extremly cute japanese guys, Keita Tachibana's the lead singer and he's only 18. The other two are Ryuichi Ogata and Ryohei Chiba. They're cute, too. But not as cute as Keita. My cousin was the first one who found out about them. When I first saw them, i thought they look like girls. But then, they were only 15 at taht time. Now thay've grown so much and become so much cooler...*drools*

       Holidays are supposed to be great, right? But no, my holidays are boring. I'm not allowed to go out, not allowed to do this ao that. What am i supposed to do? Sit at home and tidy up my room (well, my room is kinda messy). And when my mum's allowed to go on a holiday next week, i'm gonna be stuck at my aunt's house doing absolutely nottin at all. My friends are all away for holiday. Lucky piggys. Never mind. I just burn my new W-inds CD *squels*. W-inds are my absolutely favourite J-pop group. I love Keita. He's got such a nice voice and he's cute...*drools*

       Holidays at last. This year is the longest year ever. But it's no the worst. I think it's the best one. I just hope the next one would be better. On the last day of school all the beautiful memories came back to me. Like our class trip to lake kenyir, my birthday party with mario, my crush on patrick, the trip to jakarta, when i met alex, how lisa and i became best friends, meggy's and athi's fight, meggy and mandy, robin and sari, theresa and marc, me and kevin, our romeo and julia play, the valentine's party, how i got to know marvin and robin...everything came to my head. Next year won't be the same. Why? Because ami, athi, anna, maia, farah, chris, lisa, so menay people is leaving school. It's so sad. DSKL is like a home to us. It's a small school and we know everyone in this school, so when someone leaves, then it's really sad. Well, at least i have something to look forward to: christine's brother. I sure hope he's coming next year. :P

       I'm watching some pics my friend took while we were in jakarta for our school trip. But at the same time, i'm watching the w-inds another paradise pv. If you ask me, i think watching w-inds is more worth it. I'll see my friends soon when the school holidays end. But will everything be the same again? Will lisa still like me? Would the friendship between jess and i really break? Gosh, i'm so stupid thinking like this, right? I mean, who cares? If lisa doesn't like me, i still have mandy and meggy, right? No, i won't they have themselves, becky has jess, i can forget about ami, she's off to germany and athi's going to the iskl *sigh*. It's gonna be a great year, but who cares? I won't care what others say anymore. I did too many mistakes last year. I won't make the same mistakes again. I feel kinda weird at the moment.    Current mood: Weird (don't ask me why)   Current music: W-inds - Super Lover ~I need you tonight~ ( absolutely love the pv of this song)Current colour: Blue!
