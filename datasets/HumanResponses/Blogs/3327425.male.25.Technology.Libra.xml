      Chalk it up as lesson learned.  I get it.  I understand.  Now enough!  My wife and I moved into our house last November (Thanksgiving weekend to be exact).  Too late in the year to effectively start a lawn.  So we waited untill this spring.  Spring is now.  And for the past 4 days Michigan has been HAMMERED with severe storm after severe storm.  I don't remember the last time so much severe weather was present.  And, by the way, I had hydroseed put down 4 and a half days ago (Wednesday afternoon for those having difficulty counting).  Hydroseed is this green mixture of recyled paper, seed, and other materials that is sprayed onto dirt wet, and as it drys forms a sticky bond to the dirt.  This is intended to help the seed stay in place during wind, and *light* rain.  What happens to the seed when the dirt it is stuck to washes away?  The answer: It ends up in my neighbors yard.  The other nifty thing about my new house, is that it sits on a hill to create a walkout basement.  Rain.  Dirt.  Hill.  Not a good combination when trying to start a lawn.  Compound that with HEAVY rain (Forest Gump's voice is echoing in my head here) and you have a situation not suited to breeding a new lawn.  Oh yeah, the rain has been sooooo heavy that the dirt is starting to wash away from UNDER by side walks.  It would take quite a bit to explain the layout here, but the short of it is, next to my front door is a small (maybe 80 sq ft) area of dirt that we will eventually plant stuff in.  Two sides of this area are bordered by the house.  The other two are bordered by the porch and sidewalk.  In that little area I also have a downspout from my gutters.  Yep, sooo much water has flowed out of that gutter that it has tunneled UNDER the sidewalk.  Ahhh...the joys of home ownership.  But as bad as I have it, it cannot compare to people who have been hit with tornadoes, and damaging storms.  Some of those people lost their homes, not just some dirt from under their sidewalk.  My heart goes out to those people who find themselves houseless today.  Articles like  urlLink this  puts my little problem in perspective.  A little bit of dirt and some hard work, and my "problem" is solved.  Some have lost things that can never be regained.  Photos, family heirlooms, and other precious items ruined by mother nature's latest strike.  Sometimes, we need to be reminded that no matter how bad we think we have it, it could be worse.

      I must apologize.  I incorrectly stated that the "brilliant guy" was leaving pertinent information showing in the barcode.  I was informed that it's only a library card number.    I made a poor choice in an example.  However, I did find another  urlLink example .  My point was not intended to focus on the specific examples, but rather the incredulous act of uploading a picture of an official ID.  In the future, I promise to be more careful of my example choices.

      After overhearing a conversation between a couple of co-workers, I decided that I should give it a try.  Their conversation centered around people/idiots actually scanning and uploading their DRIVERS LICENSES to the internet.   urlLink Check it out ...pages and pages of photos.  Here's one  urlLink brilliant guy  who posted his drivers license, and two other ids on his blog!!  Granted he blurred the important numbers, but he left the barcode...doesn't take a genious to know that the important numbers ARE IN THE BARCODE!!   urlLink Another one ...and this one didn't blank out ANYTHING.  Next time I need to pick up a new alias, Google here I come!!  Morons!

      Check out this  urlLink article .   It's also a big money issue for an industry suffering through brutal price wars. A wireless directory could generate as much as $3 billion a year in fees and additional minutes by 2009, according to a study conducted by consulting firm Zelos Group Inc.  Note "fees" and "additional minutes."  Who's paying for that?  The carriers "are either going to make money by getting lots of people listed in the directory" and charging for its use, "or they they'll make money by charging people not to be in it," said Roger Entner, a wireless analyst for the Yankee Group.  Hmmm...the regular phone companies already charge you for an unlisted number.  Think they will do the opposite for wireless phones?  Critics counter that the promise of consumer choice is disingenuous because many cellphone service contracts contain clauses that give permission to publish numbers.  Did you read your cell phone contract/policy closely?   "My [phone] already has started to get deluged with spam from pornographers and get-rich-quick schemes, and this directory will only make things worse," said Bob Eagan, president of consulting firm Mobile Competency Inc.   Now Discover Card can call my cell phone AND my house AND send spam email to my phone AND spam email to my home email address multiple times a day.  Verizon and T-Mobile are "vowing" that they will keep the numbers private unless customer's opt in (althought T-Mobile will have to change their contract because it states that they will list it).  Not sure about everyone else, but I beleive them.  Sure. I. Do.  Nextel/Verizon/others subscribers, wonder how safe your direct connect/push to talk/two-way numbers are?  How nice would it be to get a nice loud over the speaker message to enlarge your penis.  In church.  At a wedding.  During a moment of silence.  Disturbing.  Very disturbing.

      I've been thinking alot the past day or so (see my previous post - I've had nothing better to do).  The issue of POWs and their treatment has struck a nerve deep inside.  Military men and women are being villified for their treatment of POWs in Abu Ghraib.  I find this unnerving.  Answer this question for me: What good is it to take a POW?  Seriously, what does anyone have to gain from it?  The geneva convention says that a POW only has to give name, rank and serial number.  Not much useful information there.  So what's the point?  People entrusted with the care of POWs are supposed to keep them clothed, fed, and otherwise in a state that they were in before capture (healthy and such).  So now, after taking prisoners, the military now has to utilize resources to keep the POWs happy and content for the duration of their stay.  So what's the point?  If the military cannot take prisoners and try to ascertain vital information that could ultimately save lives by brining an earlier end to a conflict, then why take prisoners?  Why not just shoot them where they stand?    If the military takes a prisoner, they have to treat them with respect and dignity, even though 15 minutes before, they were trying to KILL EACH OTHER.  Can't ask questions of the POW like, where are other troops located.  Or, where is your HQ.  Any self-respecting soldier is NOT going to answer that question.  And now, methods like sleep deprivation, and exchanging food for information are not allowed.  Yes, those methods are awful, but necessary for ultimate victory in any conflict.  If POWs cannot be used to garner information, then what's the point?  The point is, apparently, it's better off for the military to kill the enemy than it is to keep them alive.  Alive they are of no use (can't garner any useful information).  Dead they are no use.    At least dead they don't cost resources and more importantly MY TAX MONEY to keep them clothed, fed, and healthy.

      Well, my teeth are gone, stitches and holes where they used to be.  I'll have to admit, it wasn't as bad as I originally thought.    The IV sedation was WONDERFUL!  I did wake up toward the end however, and that was a touch on the twilight zone side.  If you have ever been under sedation, then you know what you feel like upon first waking up - confusion.  Imagine the confusion coupled with three strangers staring at you with this awful sawing/drilling noise in your ears - not a pleasant way to wake up.  I must have gone back "asleep" soon after, because I don't remember them stitching me up at all, and the next thing I remember is being lead to the recovery room.  I vaguely remember the doctor telling my wife that everything went pretty good (although I should have gotten this done around 15 years old).  From there it's pretty hazy until I got home.  Then I remember my entire FACE being pretty much numb for another half hour to an hour.  Oh yeah...and the mouth full of bloody gauze.  But, I'm not in as much pain as I thought I would be, and have actually been able to eat some soft foods (like scrambled eggs) - but only after taking some vicodin (good stuff that vicodin).

      I'm 25 years old (almost 26).  I've not had my wisdom teeth extracted yet.  That comes tomorrow.  About 8 years after most people get them done.    They've never bothered me.  They don't hurt.  I never even noticed them.  I certainly don't feel any wiser with my wisdom teeth, nor do I feel I'll lose any wisdom after having them extracted.  But, the dentist, in all his wisdom, feels I need to have all four of them removed.  The extraction reccomendation stems from an x-ray (actually 3 years of x-rays) which shows ONE wisdom tooth growing sideways toward the front of my mouth.  Fine!  Go ahead and chisel that one out (oops, sorry, extract that one - wouldn't want to be to blunt about the subject).  But what's his logic for removing the three other teeth that even HE says are "in no danger?"  "Might as well, we're going in anyway."  I guess that makes sense.  Hell I've got what 28 more?  What's four teeth?  Hey!  I have an idea, why not extract all my teeth?  I mean, my Grandparents have false teeth as do many over 60.  If I'm gonna lose them anyway, "might as well, we're going in anyway."  I'll be under general anesthetic, call in the doctor to remove my appendix, I don't need it (apparently) anyway.  Might as well get a head start on my organ donation too, and take a kidney (only need one).    Three teeth, co-existing with the other teeth in perfect harmony are now at the mercy of the greatest in all medical opinions - "Might as well, we're going in anyway."  Oh well, at least I get some good drugs!

      Ask Nick Berg if he gives a fuck about naked, demoralized Iraqi POWs.  Ask (former) Iraqi olympians, beaten and killed by one of the Hussein sons, if they give a fuck about naked, demoralized Iraqi POWs.  Ask American GI's with bullets sizzling through the air inches from their head if they give a fuck about naked, demoralized Iraqi POWs.   urlLink Ask Senator James Inhofe (R Oklahoma)  if he gives a ... wait, read the article and you get your answer.    They're murderers, they're terrorists, they're insurgents. Many of them probably have American blood on their hands. And here we're so concerned about the treatment of those individuals.   ...it shows the kind of people we're dealing with and why we have to get information from these cellblock people.  I, for one, am glad that  someone  has the testicular fortitude to say it.  Publicly.  Well said Senator.

      I thought I would give this "blogging" thing a try. Maybe it will help with my sanity, and make me a happier overall person.  Maybe it's healthy to get some of the things off my mind and into cyberspace.  Maybe, our society is so screwed up that I need a place to vent.  In any case, thanks for being bored enough to read my opinionated drivel.

      It's been a while since I last posted.  A head cold/infection of something or another has taken alot out of me over the past week.  While I was down and nearly out, I read a book, "Dark Rivers of the Heart" by Dean Koontz.  Actually I re-read the book.  It was originally published in 1995, which is when I originally read it (I was 16/17 at the time).  At that time, I didn't fully comprehend the seriousness of the plot.  At that time, it was a wildly imaginative, government-run-a-muck adventure story.  Re-reading it this past week, after much more social and political awareness, I am astounded at the profoundness of the novel.  It's a fictional story of two individuals on the run from a government agency intent on bringing them down.  The central theme of the book revolves around the slow erosion of the Bill of Rights and how the government and its agencies are using their new "power" to control the country.    One of the side plots points out the forfeiture laws made popular by the War on Drugs.  In case you aren't aware, this law allows the police/FBI/ATF/DEA or any other law enforcement agency to seize property at a whim.  No conviction necessary.  No warrant necessary.  No charges even need to be filed.  And no "innocent until proven guilty."  Just take it and run.  You could even be found "not guilty" and STILL NOT get your stuff back after it has been seized.  Reading this novel at 16/17 years old, it didn't have quite the meaning it has today.  Then, my main concern was if I was going to the prom, and whom I would ask (for the record, I didn't end up going).  Reading it now, got me thinking (again) at how screwed up our society has become.  It's screwed up enough to allow human beings (to my knowledge that is the species that make up every law enforcement agency) with all our flaws, to seize private property (houses, bank accounts, jewelry, etc) and there's nothing the "victim" can do about it.  To make matters worse, the government actually encourages more of this action by cutting budgets from these law enforcement agencies and telling them to seize more property (of which the seizing authority gets to keep a percentage if not all of the money garnered from the assets).  This is a multi-million dollar industry!  So when the police department needs a little extra cash, then can run to their neighborhood, seize some property, and then say "oops, sorry we made a mistake."  At which point it is up to the citizen to sue the department and prove his/her innocence to get their property back (or cash equivalent).  Meanwhile the house has been sold at auction and the money appropriated.  It could take years to get anything back for that citizen.  Plus, even if that citizen is found not guilty, thier STUFF could still be legally held because IT (the stuff) may be guilty of a crime (for example, if I have a party and someone brings drugs to my house, they could seize my house and not give it back even if I had nothing to do with it, because my house could be viewed as a "distribution" point).  Fortunately, some of the states have been peeling back the teeth of this portion of the war on drugs.  Some, but not all.  Back to the book.  It is a really well written book, and highly entertaining.  I would recommend checking it out if your up for a good read.

      My wife and I went to Maui for our honeymoon 3 years ago.&nbsp; During that trip, we visited a winery where we sampled some fantastic wine.&nbsp; Our favorite was&nbsp;a wine made from pineapple instead of grapes.&nbsp; We ended up bringing two bottles home with us.  I have been searching for this wine ever since.&nbsp; You can find places on the internet that have it available, and for a decent price too.&nbsp; The only issue is: some pompous assclown with a law degree has determined that wine cannot be shipped to Michigan residents.  Well at least we don't have lawyers telling us what drugs&nbsp;our doctors can and cannot prescribe...er..um..nevermind.

      The local news had a segment on tasers (you can read the summary  urlLink here ).&nbsp; The part that got my feathers ruffled was:    A New York Times report suggests that up to 50 people have died after police used tasers during arrests. Amnesty International is calling for an outright ban of the weapons.  Would they rather the police shoot the suspect?&nbsp; Just another example of our society heading the way of "The Demolition Man" where the police use "glow rods" and are really a bunch of pussies.   Kinda on this subject...why is it illegal for me to own a taser in Michigan?&nbsp; Or more specifically, why is it a FELONY?&nbsp; Police can have them, why can't I?&nbsp; They walk the same streets I do.   "Be well"

      Read  urlLink this  if you can.   In summary, it's&nbsp;a report by the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, Inc. that suggest African Americans bear much more of the burden of global warming than do whites.&nbsp; From the Executive Summary:     African Americans are already disproportionately burdened by the health effects of climate change, including deaths during heat waves and from worsened air pollution. Similarly, unemployment and economic hardship associated with climate change will fall most heavily on the African American community.  African Americans are less responsible for climate change than other Americans.  Both historically and at present, African Americans emit less greenhouse gas.    Policies intended to mitigate climate change can generate large health and economic benefits or costs for African Americans, depending on how they are structured.      The basic underlying principle is that because the majority of African Americans live in the inner cities and low income places, they are bearing a bigger burden than any other American.&nbsp; Judging by this logic, all us white people should ban together and make the government shovel our driveways, because&nbsp;whites are probably more likely to&nbsp;die shoveling their driveways than blacks.&nbsp; This is due to the concentration of different people in different regions of the country.&nbsp; You could make nearly any argument you wanted if you twisted the facts enough.  Maybe the Congressional White Caucus Foundation, Inc. should put out a study on the unequal burden of footing the welfare bill.&nbsp; Oh wait...that wouldn't be very PC of me to say...better forget I said that.  I can't tell you how much this raised my blood pressure.

      I live in Michigan.&nbsp; Michigan has two seasons (not four like most people think).&nbsp; We have Winter and Construction.   Construction is a way of life around these parts for 8-9 months out of the year.&nbsp; For the most part I can live with the necessary annoyances to make our roads ultimately better.&nbsp; BUT, morons with drivers licenses really test my patience.   There's a 11 mile stretch of highway currently under construction that I travel every day to and from work.&nbsp; This highway is down to one lane in each direction with the north bound traffic shifting to the southbound side of the highway (and a cement divider to keep the two lanes separate).&nbsp; The speed limit through the zone is 60.&nbsp; Most days I'm happy if we just do 40.   Why do morons find it necessary to slow down (sometimes STOP COMPLETELY) to watch the construction?&nbsp; I can understand slowing for construction workers if they are working within 20 feet of where we are driving, but there are at least 150 feet between the workers and the traffic - separated by a big median of grass!!&nbsp; What, have you never seen construction before?   Also, the entering traffic has to yield for us.&nbsp; This does not mean slam on your brakes to let in a car who is already completely stopped on the on ramp.&nbsp; Cause then we play the "you" - "no you" game for about an hour.&nbsp; And if you are entering the highway DON'T STOP!!!&nbsp; I can't stand when people will get to the very beginning of the point where the on ramp touches the highway and stop.&nbsp; THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM TO MERGE (in the cases of this particular construction zone).&nbsp; Keep driving, someone will let you in, otherwise the idiot mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph will come to&nbsp;a screetching halt to let your no-driving dumbass in.

      First I will start with the big pile of steaming monkey shit known as welfare.&nbsp; Worst fucking implementation of a more or less "decent" idea.&nbsp; I'm all for helping out those that are physically unable to work.&nbsp; I mean those that have lost both arms and both legs, really, totally, physically unable to work.&nbsp; Not the "I hurt my back so I can't be a mechanic anymore" people.&nbsp; Fuck you, get a desk job.   Now, I'm resigned to the fact that welfare isn't going to go away anytime soon.&nbsp; But, if we institute some changes, the appeal of government handouts will lessen and people would actually begin to be contributing members of society again.   Actually, I'm only proposing one change.&nbsp; Instead of handing out money in whatever form for them to spend on housing (read stereo equipment), car payments (for the new Caddy), groceries (steak and Pepsi), etc, hand out the groceries.&nbsp; I'm tired of seeing people in front of me at the grocery store with food stamps in hand and a cart full of Coke, shrimp, steak, brand name cereals.&nbsp; That shit ends with my plan.   You need government help to get groceries, fine.&nbsp; Here you go - here's&nbsp;a few&nbsp;bags of groceries all the essentials you will need for the next week (better make it last cause I'm not coming back till next week).&nbsp; There's no steak, or soda.&nbsp; Milk, bread, oats, eggs, flour, off-brand stuff, etc.&nbsp; That's what's in them grocery bags - no more steak.&nbsp; You want steak - get a job.   Oh, you need help paying some utility bills - No more sending a check to you, that check goes right to the utilities company.&nbsp; You need a car you say?&nbsp; No Caddy for you, you get a 1970's Pinto - it may not look pretty but it runs well enough to get you from point A to B and back again.&nbsp; You need clothes?&nbsp; What size do you wear?   Bottom line, why are we allowing the excess in our welfare system?&nbsp; All we need to do is revise the plan so there is no excess.&nbsp; ZERO extra dollars for anything.&nbsp; Here you go, here's what you need to live.&nbsp;   True story.&nbsp; My brother is married with two kids and is the sole income provider for the house.&nbsp; He has an okay job with a little health benefit (not much).&nbsp; His daughter (less than a year old) had to go to the hospital due to an illness.&nbsp; His insurance covered all but&nbsp;a nice $3000 chunk of the bill.&nbsp; After receiving a 2nd notice about payment, he went to see if he could get any help from the government.   He pulled in behind a guy in a&nbsp;newer Cadillac Escalade (my brother is driving an early 90's Buick he bought used).&nbsp; He got in line behind the driver of the Escalade.&nbsp; The driver left, apparently receiving the assistance he needed.&nbsp; My brother gets denied.&nbsp; You see, my brother is working and making just over the amount that someone has deemed the maximum for any assistance.&nbsp; Does the driver of the Escalade REALLY need help?&nbsp; If he does, then he should sell the damned Escalade.   How do you expect people to WANT to become contributing members of society again if you continually give out all the handouts?&nbsp; And then, if you are fortunate enough to have a job, but make somewhere between what it takes to make a decent living and poverty, you get nothing.

      I a recent  urlLink news story , Governor Schwarzenegger is quoted as calling a group of Democrats "girlie men" for giving&nbsp;in too easily to lobbiests. &nbsp;That phrase was taken from a Saturday Night Live sketch in which two Schwarzenegger-worshiping body builders referred to ANYONE who was weak as a "girlie man."  &nbsp; This comment has democrats fuming claiming that Schwarzenegger is resorting to "blatant homophobia."&nbsp; And that the term is derogatory to women.&nbsp; Okay...sooooo...where was the problem when Hans and Frans were using it on SNL?&nbsp; Hmmm....hit a little close to home did we Mr. Democrat?

      If the powers that be have there way our society will become a collective of one consciousness.&nbsp; One size fits all.&nbsp; Everybody is equal.&nbsp; No distinctions.  &nbsp;  True equality between the races and the sexes (and any other group that is currently "distinguished")&nbsp;would ultimately ruin this country and potentially the world.&nbsp; PEOPLE ARE DIFFERENT.&nbsp; Not only are white people different from black people and latinos and asians, but EVERY white person is different from EVERY OTHER white person.&nbsp; The same for blacks, latinos, asians, etc.  &nbsp;  The notion of equality is a noble idea, but is not practical at all.&nbsp; Everyone is unique.&nbsp; I am a near genius when it comes to writing a software program (not to pat myself on the back or anything), but I don't know shit about cars, other than how to change the oil.&nbsp; If you told me that my muffler flange needed to be replaced I would believe you, because I do not have the knowledge to know any better.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The mechanic down the street may not know jack about computers, but would know that there is NO SUCH THING as a muffler flange.&nbsp; It is obvious that we are very different.&nbsp; We probably would even have very different social lives and tendencies.&nbsp; Now, what right would I have in demanding that I receive the same treatment from employers seeking to hire a mechanic?&nbsp; What if I were black looking into hiring into a government mechanic shop with 7 white mechanics?  &nbsp;  The very mention of the word "black" seemingly has everyone's panties in a bunch, as if I cannot make a distinction between a black man and a white man (just ask Rush Limbaugh and ESPN).&nbsp; Same holds true for any sort of distinction.&nbsp; The next time you tell a story, instead of using a man or a woman, throw in the race (heck, even the mention of "woman" will sometimes get you into trouble in certain circumstances).&nbsp; Next time you listen to the radio, listen to some of the hoops they have to jump through.&nbsp; We're not supposed to make a distinction any more.  &nbsp;  People outcried at the questioning of Arab members of the community in post 9/11 America.&nbsp; They called it racial profiling.&nbsp; I call it good police work.&nbsp; If the prime suspect(s) of a crime fit a certain race or sex, why would you question anyone outside their category?&nbsp; If a suspect is estimated at 6'3" tall, would you call it "tall people" profiling if the police questioned only people over 6 foot tall?  &nbsp;  This de-identification of our country has already taken place in our commercial products.&nbsp; Everyday items that began as brand names have, through convenience, become the product household words.&nbsp; The biggest one that pops into my head is Jell-O.&nbsp; Jell-O is a BRAND NAME, not the product.&nbsp; The product is "gelatin."&nbsp; There is no such thing as Meijer Brand Jell-O (Meijer is a regional grocery/everything else store in the midwest).&nbsp; Same for Kleenex.&nbsp; Puffs does not make Kleenex, they make "facial tissue."&nbsp; Many other brands have become household words including aspirin, cellophane, nylon, thermos, and escalator.&nbsp; EACH of those started as a trademark, but through public use has become the generic name.  &nbsp;  The same public use of those terms, will be the same public LACK of use of distinguishing terms (black, white, asian, male, female) that will ultimately deter these types of distinctions.&nbsp; Try and describe the person who robbed your store without uttering any of the following words: white, black, asian, african, american, italian, latino, mexican, male, female, etc.&nbsp; That is what the powers that be would have you do.&nbsp; THAT would be true equality - making NO distinction.  &nbsp;  Before I get lambasted, I will state that I am all for TREATING people with the same respect and dignity that I would like in return.&nbsp; You can TREAT people as equal, but they will never truly BE equal.

      There has been much said, and will be even more said, about who to elect (or not elect) in the upcoming Presidential election.  Everyone has an opinion.  I've heard PLENTY of them.  Most are surrounding an issue or two.  NONE of them are valid.  NONE of them will tell the true character of a President.  Issues aren't important.  I shouldn't have to care if G.W. is for or against Gay Marriage.  I shouldn't have to care if Kerry is for or against Gun Control.  I shouldn't have to care if Bush thinks porno should be on the internet or not.  I shouldn't have to care what Kerry thinks of abortion.  Issues SHOULD NOT MATTER AT ALL.  This is where our country has fallen apart in the last 100 years.  The public has been handing over control of this country to politicians one silver spoonful after one silver spoonful.  By the people, for the people.  That was a belief once.  We shouldn't need a politician to tell us if we can get an abortion, buy a handgun, watch an x-rated movie, listen to obscene lyrics, or anything else.  It is not the job of the government to tell me what I can do.  Just because you believe that abortion is wrong, DOES NOT MEAN IT NEEDS TO BE LAW!!!  If we are to legislate on beliefs and our own ideals, then I move we outlaw all infants.  They're messy.  They can be a drain on society.  They provide little positive input to society.  They are not self-sustaining.  We are close enough that cloning could become our primary source of reproduction.  Sounds silly doesn't it?  Why?  Cause you like infants?  Cause that's the way it's always been?  I have news for you, wasn't but 120 years ago that EVERYONE carried a gun 24/7.  Now, you have to jump through 7 million hoops, pay several "fees," and be a damn near perfect citizen.  Let's look at abortion.  Everyone has a stance:  Pro Life, or Pro Choice?  Which are you?  I cannot fathom a scenario where I would want my wife or any woman I know to get an abortion.  Abortion is against my ideals.  The idea of it is not pleasant.  I don't have any altruistic reasoning for my belief.  It falls on a scale of not wanting to vomit after I drink a few too many - it's not going to kill me, but is still an unpleasant thought.  With that being said, just because I think it's wrong, DOESN'T MEAN IT SHOULD BE LAW.  Bob down the street might NOT think it's wrong and he should have every right to seek out an abortion from a like minded doctor.  Same for everything.  Guns - don't like them, DON'T BUY ONE.  "Vulgar" talkshows and tv - don't like it, CHANGE THE FUCKING STATION.  Porn - don't like it, DON'T WATCH.    Bottom line, don't tell me I can't do something because you don't like to do it.  With that said, you may be wondering, how do I decide whom to vote for?  Vote the character of the man.  Vote for a man (or woman I suppose) who stands by his decisions.  Vote for the man who can learn from his mistakes (with the exception of your's truly, I'm pretty sure EVERYONE has made one or two of those).  Vote for a man you would be proud to introduce as your father/husband/son/brother.  Don't let one issue decide the vote (hell, don't let just a handful of issues decide).  I do not share the same beliefs of nearly ANYONE on the planet.  In fact, most of my friends have VERY different beliefs than I do, yet I would trust them with my life.  I'm certain all of us have friends and family who believe very differently than we do.  What is it that makes them our friend and garners our respect?  It's the character of the man (or woman).

      After a topsy-turvey couple of weeks (okay, a little over a month), I'm back &lt;sarcasm&gt;hurray&lt;/sarcasm&gt;.  I've had ALOT going on the past month or so.  My new (well, not so new anymore, but new in the sense that not everything is complete) has been taking alot of my spare time.  My wife, Crystal, and I are trying to get a lawn grown, as well as some nice landscaping.  Many of my free moments are spent putting landscaping brick down (built two retaining walls and two flower beds using retaining wall brick), and spreading dirt and grass seed.  Not to mention little things here and there (like a flag pole, planting a new plant, etc).  We attempted to go on vacation in the middle of June, which was cut short due to the passing of my grandmother.  We arrived in Los Angeles on Saturday morning, received the news via a phone call Sunday morning, and flew out Monday (spent ALL day Monday in airports and airplanes due to delays).  We are going to head back out there to visit my sisters the first week of August.  I've also become increasingly busy at work.  I've somehow managed to manage two projects, develop a third, support 4 others, and pitch in with support for yet another one.  For all the geeks: please note that UPDATE statements generally require a WHERE clause - learned that lesson the hard way today.  So there's my not-much-of-an-excuse.  I will try to be a little more up to date in the future.
