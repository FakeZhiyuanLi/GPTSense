      Today has been busy.  Visiting with my little brother.  Shopping.  Catching up on menial tasks I have been putting off.  Having a good debate about the purpose of life's tragedies and God's role in those tragedies with a priest-friend.   Enlightened, confused.  I'm stuck somewhere in between right now.

      Wow.  I haven't done a 6 hour shopping spree in a while.  Although my Christmas shopping was done last weekend (I make it a rule to try and avoid shopping at all costs in December mainly because of the crowds) I noticed that my semi-dressy clothes collection has been severely depleted, so I bought a couple of new things today to spice up my wardrobe a bit.   Got new clip-on glasses for my new glasses today.  They're hard to clip on but I need some practice and I'm sure I'll be a pro in no time.  It's nice to have new glasses that look stylish for a change.     More to come in the following days...

      I guess this is where I have to give the obligatory facts and figures regarding me.  I'm 26 (if I were about 20 years younger I'd say I was almost 26 and a half!), I'm a grad student on leave from school, and I'm trying to figure out exactly what to do with my life as I get nearer and nearer to finishing up my higher education.    I like to think of myself as somewhat intelligent, goal-oriented, funny and strong.  Sometimes I don't think of myself in those terms but we can't all be consistent all the time, can we?    Without school, my life is pretty quiet these days.  Lots of television and too much Internet.  Too much online euchre.  I guess I haven't had a break from school in 22 years so this is probably a good time to decompress, though I wish it were for better reasons.    I've had a rough summer.  I went blind on five occasions after complications from what should have been a very simple eye surgery.  I'm still recovering my sight but things are markedly improved from what they were.   I guess that's enough for now.  More to come!

      Well, good day and welcome to LAMLand, the place where you will find out what is new in the world of Lindsay.  While it's usually a decent place to hang out, sometimes it can be a little scary, but I know we'll have a great time so just sit back and enjoy.

      Great visit with friends from Montreal today.  They are such a wonderful couple.  We did some shopping, had lunch and had a lot of fun.  It's always a pleasure to see them.  Bought a miniature Christmas tree and 50 miniature ornaments for my apartment for next December.  Still hunting for miniature Christmas lights, though.  Perhaps in the days to come I shall luck out.

      This has been a bit of an odd day.  People seem a little touchy, though perhaps it's just my interpretation of their mind set this time of year.   I met with a friend for a coffee and caught up on all the details of her life.  This week will be very much along those lines.  Catching up with many friends and individuals during this post-Christmas, pre-return to work time of year.  More to come...

      Very tired tonight.  We went to Peterborough today and visited my mom's relatives, had a nice lunch, and it seemed no sooner had we got there did we turn around and come back home.  It was nice while it lasted!  We also made it back just in time for 5pm Mass and now we're all just about half past dead.   It's the mildest December I remember, and apparently today is the warmest Dec. 27th since 1949.  Craziness.  More to come...

      Happy Boxing Day!  Today's the day when it used to be illegal for Canadian businesses to open and offer their merchandise at highly discounted prices.  Dec. 27 was our legal shopping day (unless it was a Sunday, going back even further....)  This year, almost every store is open offering huge savings on particular items.  I don't know whether to lament the fact we're becoming more Americanized by ignoring the Boxing Day statutory holiday or to celebrate our Americanization with all the shopping perks that entails.  I'll have to get back to you on that.  More to come...

      Today has been a nice, quiet Christmas.  Santa brought me the complete series of "The Vicar of Dibley" on DVD and a wood-set of board games (chess, Chinese checkers, solitaire, etc.)  Lots of fun.  Also saw "Freaky Friday" on DVD and "Something's Gotta Give" at the theatre.  I love a nice, quiet, peaceful Christmas.  More to come...

      Not a very good day yesterday in California.  I pray that things get back to normal quickly and there are no more devastating earthquakes there.   A quiet, blessed Christmas would be nice for everyone for a change.  Just read in People Magazine's Year End Review that to date, 457 American soldiers have been killed in the war in Iraq.  Most of these kids -- yes, kids -- are 18, 19, 20, 21 years old.  They're just babies.  They haven't lived.  Most don't know what war or death is.  That's not including the count of Iraqis killed so far.  What a terrible, wasteful thing, war.  More to come...

      Nothing too spectacularly new in the world today.   That is usually a relief more than anything else.  The US has declared that they are increasing security for fears of another terrorist attack during the holidays.  I hope that the increased security prevents any major disasters from occurring again.  More to come...

      4 days until Christmas.  Remarkable.  Anyone who knows me know I've been ready for ages but it's still ridiculous.  It doesn't feel like Christmas.  It doesn't look like Christmas.  And before you know it, it won't be Christmas anymore.  Last year we had a big blizzard on Christmas and spent much of the day shoveling.  This year it's still green and quite mild.  I don't mind not shoveling but it does detract a bit from the spirit of the season to see so much green grass.  More to come...

      Today has probably been the most even-keeled day I have had all week, after a week of a seeming parade of nightmares.  I've been enjoying a quiet day with lots of movies, particularly "Seabiscuit", "The Wonder Boys" and "A Christmas Story".  The malls were insane even at 7:00am this morning.  Must be that 4-shopping days left 'til Christmas issue.  Glad I finished by the first of November. :-)  More to come...

      Had a great visit with a young priest-friend last night.  We ended up at the Dairy Queen but hey, it was the only place not busy in December (I wonder why!) :-)  Perhaps things are going to settle down now.  I can't imagine that much else could go wrong this week.    Christmas is coming so quickly.  Hard to believe that one week from now, it will all be over for another year.

      I just got home from the funeral for my friend Fr. Pat.  The funeral was beautiful and it was probably one of the biggest turn-outs they have ever seen.   Many of the other priests who I know and who cared for Fr. Pat were there.  Many more lay people, mostly older, but also some of the students, and a few families who Fr. Pat used to be friends with were there also.  The homilist talked about Fr. Pat's extreme holiness.  He didn't mention Fr. Pat's prayer and that surprised me - he always said goodbye by saying "May Our Lady cover you with the blue mantle of her love."  Despite my inability to understand him hardly at all on Dec. 4, I sure understood that when he blessed me as I was leaving him for the last time.  He extended his hand just a little and mumbled "blue mantle of love".   This homilist joked that he once said to a fellow priest, "I hope that I'm just a tenth as holy as Fr. Pat is."  His friend reassured him, "You are." (lol)   It was really nice but I'm not very good at funerals. :-(  More to come...

      The US claims to have captured Saddam Hussein today.  Since we know there are at least 5 surgically altered and specially trained decoy Saddams running around, how do they know it's the right one?  The Canadian media have been airing this story continuously for over 1 h 30 mins so far.  Isn't it convenient that it would not be released until 8am EST when the capture supposedly took place at 2pm EST the previous day?  Too bad it isn't sweeps.  More to come...

      I've been doing some serious thinking today.  If you were given 24 hours left to live on earth, and you were healthy, what would you do?  (I add the healthy part because I'm not thinking of someone confined to a hospital bed or hospice who has little choice over what they would do with their last 24 hours.)  I'm referring to someone who is healthy and receives a divine vision that in 24 hours, their life will be cut short by a bus running them over.  What would you do with those last 24 hours?  Really, not just the sanitized version?  I did manage to squeeze in some paperwork for my dissertation.  I took care of some long overdue correspondence and revised my proposal so I'm ready to go in January.  I wish I had access to more than just the Internet for research though, and I'd try to get some other work done between now and then.  Alas, they won't let me in the libraries until January so my options are fairly limited.  Ah well, they're not paying me to work anyway.  More to come...

      Quiet today.  No bad news, no good news.  That's my kind of day, really.  I like things to be kept as even and balanced as possible.  I got a new cell phone last night to replace my old Motorola 120c.  Finally settled on an Audiovox 8600.  I'm having fun using this cute little thing so far.  The user's manual is embarrassing for the company, though.  Horrible typos everywhere, no information that I can find on how to voicedial.  I had to use a Samsung manual to figure that feature out.  Audiovox, if you're listening, get it together and at the very least, spell check your manuals!  I won't even get into the ill-fitting leather phone protector right now...  Other than that, it's a sweet little phone.  I got red, which just seems so much cooler than silver.  I like the stopwatch and calendar features as well as the world clock.

      I'm still coming to terms with the news that my friend is dying.   86 years is certainly not a life cut short by any means but I wish I could have known him longer and not been forced to be away so long over the summer with my eye troubles.   I've had nothing but the greatest respect for this priest.  He helped me (without really realizing it, or maybe he did?) to find my niche and a group of friends when I was particularly floundering upon first arriving at university.  How we met at all is a rather awkward story but suffice it to say that I think, although he insisted that he needed me as a volunteer and conversation partner over the last academic year, I needed his friendship too.  He had an uncanny way of knowing when I was worried about something even though I'd go to extraordinary lengths at pretending all was just fine.  I'd never tell him what was wrong (except this summer with my eye difficulties, so he remained updated on why I couldn't come back to visit him) but he would inevitably want to say a prayer for my intentions and that was a comfort, whatever happened to be weighing heavily on my mind.   I'm going to miss him.  More to come...

      I've been mulling over the question of Evil and suffering in this flawed world of ours and God's apparent inability to do anything to stop these things.  Why doesn't God step in where a young child is being physically or sexually abused?  Why doesn't he cure that 22-year-old woman's terminal breast cancer, or help the young man who is suffering from MS?    Some very kind theologians and philosophers have reminded me of the principle of Free Will, a gift to us that allows us to be the captains in our own lives.  Our lives are not predestined.  We can choose when and what we do, how we do it, why we do it.  We can actively, intellectually turns towards God (our Creator or however you recognize this entity in your own life), or we can rely on our own talents and resources to propel us along life's paths.  Because of the gift of freedom that we have, the young child who is abused is at the mercy of his parent's bad use of Free Will.  The diagnosis of serious diseases is a result of the existence of evil in our world, and human sin is the cause of the presence of this evil.    So, God can do anything but doesn't because he loves us enough to make our own choices about things.  Seems complicated but as mortals, there's only so much we can see of the big picture.  Hopefully all will be made clear on the other side.  Until then, we have to bear our trials as best as we can and offer them up.  Someone told me that there's no greater prayer than that of a suffering servant.  Let's hope that is true.  Gottfried Wagner's talk yesterday was interesting.  Part two is this afternoon.  It seems incredible to me that he and his family have such differing, splintering opinions on their family's dynasty.  He completely disagrees with the sanitization of their family name, believing that covering up the past is almost as bad as the family's involvement in the Third Reich in the first place.  Family reunions must be particularly interesting.  More to come...

      New today, I added a link to email me.  If anyone is actually reading this drivel and feels inspired to do so, please drop me a line.  I'd love to hear from you.  Today I have the opportunity to listen to the infamous Richard Wagner's great-grandson, Gottfried, talk about his family.  He's a musicologist so this ought to be enlightening to everyone from fellow musicologists to historians to music aficionados to opera devotees.  Hopefully it is enlightening, anyway, and worth my trip to Toronto.    I'm off to a meeting to become registered as a person with a sensory disability at university.  This means they will give me certain accommodations when taking tests.  I don't know what else they can help with if anything but hopefully this will enlighten me.    Sounds like today might be a day of enlightenment.  That is the goal, anyhow.  More to come...

      Sad day today.  A friend of mine is dying.  I knew this day would come but it's still much harder for me to accept that I thought it would be.  I visited him this morning and was shocked by how much he had deteriorated.  The nurses are making sure he is comfortable but it has to be frustrating for someone who was so active into his old age to find communication so difficult and to be 100% dependent on others.  For a person with a blog, I'm really not feeling like talking about it right now.    More to come...

      Good day today.  Had an eye checkup that went really well.  My glaucoma is under control now (but it begs the question I saw on some other blogger's page... If I've got glaucoma at age 26 what's next?  Menopause at 31?) and I'm seeing a lot better than I have been in six months.  I could actually see the doctor's face for the very first time.  I was convinced he was simply a blurry face with a little bit of hair on top until the last visit in September.   Next appointment in July.  Another with a glaucoma specialist in March.  But, all's well so far and I'm going back to school full-time in January.  More time to be academic and try to figure out what the hell I want to do with my life.   More to come...

      It's been ages since I posted.  Just not feeling terribly inspired.  My move has turned out to be a very good thing.  My new roommates are fabulous and we're getting along very well.  Quiet and clean; my type of gals.  I have been doing a lot of reading of Robertson Davies' novels for work lately.  They are thoroughly enjoyable and I wish I could spend more time with them rather than skimming through for vague references to Wagner.  Big snow storm in this area today.  We are expected to get a total of 30cm of snow by tomorrow evening, and maybe some ice pellets in the morning which should make travel miserable.  I have been volunteering at a new place now.

      So I'm not very talkative these days.  Just did a big move today and I'm pretty tired.  School is already stressing me out and I haven't even started yet.  Here's a joke to tide you over while I recover.  Here's a goodie I shared with my priest-friend before he died last month:   The new priest is nervous about hearing confessions, so he asks the older priest to sit in on his sessions. The new priest hears a couple confessions, then the old priest asks him to step out of the confessional for a few suggestions.   The old priest suggests, "Cross your arms over your chest, and rub your chin with one hand." The new priest tries this.   The old priest suggests, "Try saying things like, 'I see, yes, go on,' and 'I understand. How did you feel about that?'" The new priest says those things.   The old priest says, "Now, don't you think that's a little better than slapping your knee and saying 'You're pulling my leg, right?!? What happened next?'"  More to come...

      A New Year's Thought - adapted from Jerry Ham's poem  We've seen the passing of another year. For many it's been filled with pain and tears. We've seen our loved ones in their decline. We've had to accept that they won't be fine. Some of us had to say good bye, To a long time loved one, and we've all cried. But there have been times in this past year, That certain events have brought us cheer. If it were possible that a wish could come true, Then this is my New Year's wish for you. May the coming year be full of hope, And may we be given the strength to cope. And now at the close of another year, My friends, I wish you a Happy New Year!

      Nice day today!  9C and mostly sunny.  Tomorrow is supposed to remain very warm but it is expected to rain.   I had a quiet morning.  My parents came by with a lighter winter coat for me and some gauze to do my eye scrubs.  I bought some salt yesterday.  My eye is already beginning to feel better but the vision is fairly poor.  Grading is done.  I need to drop them off by about 10am tomorrow but the instructor is being quite lenient so if I sleep in, I will not be concerned.    Finished reading/skimming six Robertson Davies plays.  No references but they were enjoyable.  I picked up his complete first trilogy for perusal this week.  Apparently  A Mixture of Frailities  will be the one that will be most useful.  Going to rest and watch TV this afternoon.  I'm very tired.  More to come...

      Amusing (?) day yesterday.  I went to the doctor.  Instead of doing much for my ongoing nausea, he diagnosed me with (1) labyrinthitis (inner ear inflammation that will go away on its own in time), (2) blepharitis (infection of the eyelids) and (3) suspicion of hyperthyroidism.  That would explain  so  much about me and I don't know why I was always getting my symptoms treated but doctors were oblivious to the big picture.  I'm speaking too soon.  I won't know if I have it until I hear if my blood test comes back irregular.  As for the blepharitis, I already knew I had that but didn't think a GP could do anything about it.  I'm on Fucithalmic viscous eye drops for it and have to use hot compresses.  Maybe my eyeball won't hurt so much soon... :-)   And to think I was going to cancel that appointment!   MGSA conference today, Mom's birthday lunch at 12.  Bought a second birthday card to bring so I don't show up empty-handed at the restaurant.  Got it home and realized that it said " To the Man I love so much " rather than " To the Mom I love so much ".  Crap.  I don't even have anybody to give that card to. :-(  Went back to pick up my Rx and got a little potted flower instead.  Didn't want to risk another bad card!  More to come...

      Found a website on what an  urlLink ISFJ's blog looks like ... there really is a page about everything.  Marking today and this weekend.  Mid-term time in university.  I certainly don't miss doing those.   Keep reconsidering my career and weighing other counselling options.  Keep coming back to and being excited about guidance counselling.  I did that with Divinity some time ago... I wish the proverbial lightbulb would switch on over my head.  More to come...

      My career appointment was not quite what I had expected... I met with the same fellow who ran both of the career seminars I took over the past month instead of the woman who I met with in late January.  That just caught me a bit off guard having to explain everything again.  The results were:  (1) He pointed out that along the counselling interests I had identified, I only selected one counselling type of job -- the chaplain role.  Why hadn't I considered addictions counsellor or career counsellor or corporate trainer (I have no idea what this is yet) or social worker or things in the medical arena -- speech-language pathology or occupational therapy or etc. etc. etc.?  Good point.  (2) He also pointed out that my training options were university-centric and I needed to explore options at colleges as well.    (3) Another point was that the same degree might lead to different choices -- for instance, one of the career counsellors in the Career Centre has an MDiv and isn't a chaplain, so I should be alert to different ways of getting places.    (4) Finally, he pointed out that my ability to make decisions is not strong (duh...flipping a coin didn't impress him, lol) so I need to pare down my choices by using my values (ranked in order of importance,) etc. to come up with the best options.  In the Quaker community, decisions are run past a board of advisors.  In this scenario, I would say to people I trust, "This is what I'm going to do" and they are not allowed to comment or make suggestions.  Instead, they may only ask provocative questions to help me figure out what I am still being blind to and ultimately make the right choice.  I was also accepted for the internship.  I will find out by April 23 if they could find a placement for me or not.

      Getting tired of thinking about a career change.  Friend E. posted a link on her blog about determining your  urlLink soul type .    I'm Artistic.   "You are naturally born with a gift, whether it be poetry, writing or song. You love beauty and creativity, and usually are highly intelligent. Others view you as mysterious and dreamy, yet also bold since you hold firm in your beliefs."   Feel like I learned more about myself from that than I did from 3 hour career seminar...

      The Career Seminar which confirmed my ISFJ status 100% was mildly interesting.  Among my best job choices are inn keeping or farming.  Better than airline hostess... I got that answer too many times on high school career aptitude quizzes.   More seriously, I am suited to high school guidance counseling which is a recent interest, religious counseling and education, personal counseling and elementary school teaching.  Interestingly, professor wasn't on the list.  I have a meeting with the Career Counselor tomorrow to go over the results.

      Going to find out today which careers fit my personality as a  urlLink ISFJ .  Oops, I'm not supposed to know that's what I am yet.  They want the Myers-Briggs people to tell me that.  Well, I guess I ruined the surprise for myself.    I called Health Services for an appointment to see if my nausea is related to an inner ear infection.  Earliest appointment?  Friday morning.  I'll either be puking or better by then.  More to come...

      Thinking about Lent today.  I can't believe it starts this Wednesday, for one thing.  I'm trying to figure out how to make this one really count as well.  There are the obvious sacrifices (no meat on Fridays, full fasting on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday, almsgiving and a trip to the confessional - my, how I need that one!) but I like to do something else on a daily basis to remember why we're celebrating this season.    When you're a kid, you give things up in a competitive way.  One year I gave up chips and I almost died.  Another year was chocolate.  They recommend as an adult to do something extra rather than take things away, like pray more or be more charitable.  I tried charity one year and I was so bad by the end of Ash Wednesday I more or less gave it up right then and there.  I bought a  urlLink Little Black Book  from the  urlLink Diocese of Saginaw  that I find very helpful.    urlLink Fr. Pat  always gave me his copy since he couldn't read it, with the promise that I would share with him everything that I found really helpful or interesting.   urlLink The Basilians  order one for each Father -- a Little Black Book for Lent, a Little White Book for the Easter Season and a Little Blue Book for Advent.    I also like the Development and Peace Lenten Calendars because the daily monetary donations add up to a nice gift for the 4th Sunday Share Lent collection.  The new  urlLink interactive  one is pretty cool.  This year's focus is on sharing water resources and equality.  Some other ideas I'm tossing around:  urlLink Simple Life 's Calendar online  urlLink Disciples Now  Calendar (if they update it to 2004!) The  urlLink Hunger Site  Online (one click a day = a cup of food!) An  urlLink Online Retreat , since I won't be able to take a real retreat this spring.  I recall last year doing the  urlLink Stations of the Cross  each Friday.  That would be a nice thing to do again.    Lots of options!  I'll have to give this some thought before Wednesday.  I almost always let Lent creep up on me unnoticed and then make a quick, often ill-considered choice on Ash Wednesday.  Not this year.   More to come...

      Finished a rough draft of my Letter of Intent this morning.  Why are those things so difficult to write?  I suppose it is because they are so personal in nature.  No one likes examining themselves in that light.  Sort of like a job interview on paper.  I'm going to do some chores this afternoon, cleaning, sorting of recycling for tomorrow's city collection and so on.   "Normal" stuff for a change.  I can't believe my break is almost over, though.  Very depressing.  Poor Nova Scotia got hit with a major snowfall.  Had to declare a state of emergency.  Fingers crossed that what's coming our way tonight and tomorrow won't amount to much.

A priest-friend just recommended I look at  Gaudium et Spes  and  Lumen Gentium .  I feel like I'm entering the twilight zone that I'm looking at such texts of my own volition...

Waited 40 minutes with my mom to get her health card ID renewed, we waited FOUR AND A HALF HOURS at the Passport Office to get our passports renewed.   What a torture chamber that place is.  Oh well, it's done and they have been accepted.  I hope tomorrow is less eventful...  More to come...

      Friday the 13th.  It's an exciting day for bikers in  urlLink Port Dover, Ontario .     Valentine's Day tomorrow.  Just another day to remember how terribly perpetually single I am.  364 or 365 days of the year (365 this year) I don't mind being single at all.  Just one of those days bugs me, and tomorrow is it.   I hate the commercialization of Valentine's Day, and this pathetic belief that you must do something nice for somebody you love on that day.  The other days of the year don't seem to matter.  Just make sure you buy the girl in your life a bigger bouquet of flowers (i.e. no individual thought at all into the gift -- just doing what the marketing industry tells you to do!) than all her friends, and you won't have to lift a finger for the rest of the year.    This essayist is right on the mark about the  urlLink whole torrid transparent day .  Probably the only time of year when I agree with anything  urlLink Jewel  has to say.

      I have been very unmotivated today, and just mulling over the fact that nobody really cares to read in such an online diary whether or not you did your laundry today, what groceries you had to pick up, and what other menial tasks consumed your waking hours.  Some days, like today, there are no outstanding incidents to recount, and that seems very depressing perhaps to the reader more than to the writer.    I did chat for some time to my friend on the west coast who became interrupted by a virus attack on her computer (wave out to E. who is probably the only person who reads these mundane pages -- if I'm wrong, please correct me and send me an email!).  It is so nice that technology enables us to keep in touch with such ease and cost efficiency.  Reading about Viktor Frankl.  Need to pick up his book when I return to school after Reading Break.  Did somebody say Reading Break?  Yay...  More to come...

I explained my system of lists with realistic goals to her, and she was so amazed by the simplicity of it and the thought I put into it.  She kept saying I should write a book on it and give seminars.  Maybe I should... so many people ask me about my secret to success in motivation and organization.  More to come...

      Got a sad letter from a friend last night.  She fought breast cancer 5-6 years ago and won the battle, and she found out in January that the cancer is back.  It has spread to her liver and upper arm, and has affected her spine, skull, pelvis and rib cage.  Cancer is so awful.  It has taken too many lives already.  I don't want her to be another statistic.  She is undergoing chemo and indicates that she lives in Hope.  For her sake, I will too.  More to come...

      In the days when you couldn't count on a public facility to have indoor plumbing, an English woman was planning a trip to Germany.  She was registered to stay in a small guesthouse owned by the local schoolmaster. She was concerned as to whether the guesthouse contained a WC. In England, a bathroom is commonly called a WC which stands for water closet. She wrote the schoolmaster inquiring into the location of the nearest WC.   The school master, not fluent in English, asked the local priest if he knew the meaning of WC. Together they pondered possible meanings of the letters and concluded that the lady wanted to know if there was a "Wayside Chapel" near the house . . . a bathroom never entered their minds. So the schoolmaster wrote the following reply:   "Dear Madam, I take great pleasure in informing you that the WC is located 9 miles from the house. It is located in the middle of a grove of pine trees, surrounded by lovely grounds. It is capable of holding 229 people and is open on Sundays and Thursdays. As there are many people expected in the summer months, I suggest you arrive early. There is, however, plenty of standing room. This is an unfortunate situation especially if you are in the habit of going regularly.   It may be of some interest to you that my daughter was married in the WC as it was there that she met her husband. It was a wonderful event. There were 10 people in every seat. It was wonderful to see the expressions on their faces. My wife, sadly, has been ill and unable to go recently. It has been almost a year since she went last, which pains her greatly.   You will be pleased to know that many people bring their lunch and make a day of it. Others prefer to wait till the last minute and arrive just in time! I would recommend your ladyship plan to go on a Thursday as there is an organ accompaniment. The acoustics are excellent and even the most delicate sounds can be heard everywhere.   The newest addition is a bell which rings every time a person enters. We are holding a bazaar to provide plush seats for all since many feel it is long needed. I look forward to escorting you there myself and seating you in a place where you can be seen by all. With deepest regards, The Schoolmaster"

      This one cracked me up too :-)   A pastor went out one Saturday to visit his church members. At one house it was obvious that someone was home, but nobody came to the door even though the pastor had knocked several times. Finally, the pastor took out his card and wrote "Revelations 3:20" on the back of it, and stuck it in the door.    "Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him and him with me."   The next day, the card turned up in the collection plate. Below the pastor's message was the notation "Genesis 3:10".    "I heard your voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked; and I hid myself."

      Today is another winter "storm" (I use the term loosely) in the Golden Horseshoe.  Basically, it snowed a little overnight, then it froze rain for a while, and now it's raining like mad and +5C.  Not quite the blizzard they told us to brace for, but what the heck.  It's February.  Might as well have some fun with the silly ol' Canucks.  I am doing nothing today.  Well, that's not quite true.  I did a load of laundry (big woo-hoo) and I'm watching the series "The Thin Blue Line" with Rowan Atkinson from 1996-7.  I taped it off PBS then and still have it, pledge drives and all intact.  Good day to stay inside.  Got the grading done yesterday and ran out of room for any more work in my bag so that's all I have to do until Sunday.  I can deal with that.

      Grading, grading, grading.  And I haven't even started yet.  I did make it to volunteer this morning.  The turnout by both the volunteers and the hungry was actually pretty pathetic.  There were tons more people last week and the uni. was on the verge of closing.  Oh well.  It is hard to explain what it was doing out there this afternoon.  The best description I could come up with was it was raining little snowballs.  Such a mix that you ended up soaked right through your clothes, but it wasn't unpleasant.  The temperature and the precipitation.  Usually I find soaking clothes unpleasant as a rule.  Time for another trip home.  Must pack and do something useful before I leave.

      Reading, reading, reading.  On Feb. 7, less than a week from now, it will be six months to the day that I had my vitrectomy and everything I had been working towards and everything that I had been expecting to happen ground to a halt.  At that moment I had nothing to work towards, no expectations, no hope because I didn't know what the situation would be.  Nobody did for about a month after that.  I never could have thought then that I would be back doing the same thing, reading, reading and reading some more with my apparently fragile eyes.    My eye is stronger than I thought.  I can read for much longer periods of time, although I still prefer to look at something on a computer rather than stare at a sheet of paper.  I can't explain why that is really, except that I think it might have something to do with the knowledge that I can enlarge it at will if I can't see it (not always possible with printed text.)  I paced myself so much for a long time that I thought I was only capable of reading a few pages every hour.  Now I'm devouring half a book a day.    Been reading Northrop Frye and Robertson Davies.  Might as well pick up some Canadian literature and heritage along the winding road that is my dissertation.  Frye is quite cynical whereas Davies is amusing in a tongue-in-cheek kind of way.  I much prefer Davies' works but I have to venture broader.    Wiarton Willie saw his shadow today.  Six more weeks of cold and snow.  I don't know what his prediction was last year but I recall the snow and ice carried on at least until April 4.  Not fun.  Well, we know things will be wrapping up within the next 12 weeks.  I don't know about six!  Speaking of winter, we're anticipating another significant snow event overnight and into tomorrow.  Why does that always happen on the days I have to walk 20-25 minutes to volunteer?  The first two weeks were arcticly cold -30C, last week was a significant snow day (actually closed the university Monday & Tuesday night) and tomorrow is supposed to be the same.  I'm getting tired of working so hard to get there!   Oh ye winter freezes and gentle snowfalls, piss off already.  More to come...

      Sooooo tired.  Feel like I haven't slept in a week.  Well, maybe 28 or 29 hours in the last week, so perhaps my exhaustion is not incomprehensible.  The final OOTC was very good.  The turn out wasn't great, but my old friend was there.  He was so pleased I noticed that he was absent the week before.  I guess he realized someone does care.  The food was crazy!  In addition to our typical sandwich and soup fare, we had 144 hot dogs, lasagna, bread pudding, apples and a big slab cake with "Thanks for the goat times" on it.  That got some raised eyebrows but I hear it was good stuff.  I was run off my feet but enjoyed it.  Time flew.  I'm going to miss it.   Of course, there's aspects to every activity we don't like and so there were a few things I would have liked to see done differently, but it was a good experience overall and I'm so pleased that the student volunteers allowed me to help out in the second term.  Came back here, did a load of laundry, called Fr. D. for an appointment after Easter.  Still waiting for a response.  Going home tomorrow.  E., how was rez?  More to come...

      I started this day so productively and with the best of intentions.  I went to three different libraries, returned three books, picked up six more, returned those essays, got good news about that Psych class (I'm approved, just have to try to register on April 12), and even went to Mass today so I'm not beholden to go tomorrow (all about Lent).  This afternoon was a different story.  I was tired.  I needed to eat and watch  Starting Over .  I needed milk.  How did I run out?  Usually I don't let that happen.  Then I came back to read.  Got caught surfing the net.  Found www.ratemyprofessors.com/canada and had a royal hey-day there.   Even a high school site.  Sweet, still had many teachers I knew.  Added a few of my own ratings (all good, I swear).  Laughed at those ratings that were extremely accurate for those few people I knew shouldn't be rated highly.  Looked at my watch.  4:50 and I did nothing with my afternoon. Oh well, I suppose there's tomorrow after the final OOTC.     I'm becoming more and more convinced that the way that I am feeling right now, emotionally and psychologically, is not completely terrible.  I think it was only on March 12 at that good ophthalmologist's appointment that I realized completely and for the first time that this eye condition is chronic and potentially deteriorating.  That's hard news to sink in, even though she put a very positive spin on it.  I had been sailing along thinking that by 7 August 04 I would see perfectly, and now I understand that is just not true.  I have moved and am still in the process of moving from denial to anger to depression to acceptance.  I'm not wallowing in self-pity and crippled by this, unable to do anything.  I am facing this head on, making plans for the future, seeking help for the way I am feeling because I know I don't want to feel like this forever but I do need time to say goodbye to what is gone forever -- with the added qualification thanks to PP that it's gone for this life, not forever and ever.  Amen.  I wonder if that means we'll need eyes in heaven?  More to come...

      I've been crying tonight.  Little  urlLink Cecilia Zhang  was found dead yesterday.  What monster would do this to such a beautiful child?  My deepest, deepest sympathies go out to her family and friends tonight.  Also made the mistake of watching Life's  urlLink Little Miracles  tonight. It featured a little girl, Alyssa, born with congenital eye disease.  Her doctors attempted to reattach her retina and remove some scar tissue to give her partial sight.  It wasn't successful and she is now a happy, totally blind little girl.  Her story just killed me to watch it; I had a bad feeling as soon as they said what was wrong with her.  Her mom and dad had to wait weeks until the swelling reduced in her eye to know if the retina had been successful reattached or not; the waiting is the hardest part.

      Made a Japanese pact with someone this afternoon that we would share all of our problems with each other.  As I was receiving the translation of the pact into English, there was a pause following the phrase, "If you do not share your problems with me, you must swallow one thousand..."  I immediately blurted out, "What!?  Goldfish!?" which was received with hysterical laughter.  The pact was one thousand "needles."  Am I sick for thinking immediately of goldfish?   Where on earth did that come from?  More to come...

      Lovely day in Toronto today.  6C and overcast right now, but heading up to 10C and sun this afternoon.  13C and sun tomorrow.  Spring has sprung!  Enjoy it now.  The week appears as if it will rain every single day. (blah)   urlLink Cheese  rocks.  Great model for anyone who needs to make a change in their life, whether they embrace it or fight against it the whole way.  Going to go for a shopping walk this morning.  Heard that B2 (riboflavin) taken in 400mg doses every day for a month reduced folks' migraines from four a month to two.  Worth a shot.  Retreat this afternoon; concert tonight.  Wish I had been able to sleep more than 4 hours.  At least tomorrow should be peaceful.  TTC subway is 50 years old on Tuesday.  The  urlLink Toronto Star  did an article describing the changing art and styles of the subway stations.  A big congratulations goes to the Dundas Station on the Yonge line whose walls are tiled "in bile-green so hideous it's enough to induce nausea". (Christopher Hume, 27 Mar 2004, GTA Section.)  Got to go. The library, grocery store and Shoppers Drug Mart are calling.  More to come...

      I feel so good today.  This has been one of the toughest weeks yet, but things finally fell into place about 2:30pm yesterday and I'm back on the road to success.  (1)  Got my grading done.  As of 12:36pm, finished my dissertation work for this weekend.  I can now rest and read what I want to.  (2) Awesome, awesome, awesome Fr. D.  I don't feel so alone and misunderstood anymore.  (3) Awesome, awesome, awesome friends E. and M.  I don't feel so lonely and isolated anymore.    (4) Gonna read about the ' urlLink cheese ' and go out for a stroll in this heat wave later.  (5) Gonna go to the retreat I wanted to go to tomorrow.   urlLink Awesome speaker ; hope it will be revitalizing as we near Holy Week.  After that, to a concert to support Fr. Guy, Jamie et al.  (6) Got my laundry done this morning.  There's nothing as wonderful feeling as clean flannelette sheets.  More to come...

      Been a productive day already and it's only one minute to 10.  I got some books at the library to keep working on my dissertation and I probably got enrolled in the Psychology course for this summer.  Probably?  I won't know for sure until I get the approval of the Grad Coordinator but I think my Silver Tongue inherited from my mother did the trick.  Can't fly, so I might as well be productive, right?  I'm going to try to get basketball tickets for my brother and I from rez tomorrow morning.  Raptors versus Pacers (his favourite team).  The tickets are $15 and $20 off the normal $45 price.  Fingers crossed.  We never do anything together anymore so I'm really hoping I get these tickets.  Should be a quiet remainder of the day.  Going to rosary tonight (third last time) and want to do enough work so I don't feel guilty for the rest of the week when I'm grading until my hands fall off/eyes fall out.

      I get a lot of spam.  Somewhere around 313 a day.  Sometimes the writer wants to sell me a diploma.  lamoore, M.D. without all the stressful, unending intern hours?  I could dig that.   I get lots of spam about enlarging my penis naturally.  Hate to tell them that they're wasting their clicks on me since I'm missing that vital piece of equipment nor do I have anyone in my life whose penis I wish to see enlarged.  Most of the men I know are already dickheads (hee).  Today I noticed that 16 of the messages so far, the ones that keep getting past my spam guard (which I guess doesn't work too well since I get 313 spams a day!) are for Vicodin.  Or, the way the spammers send it, V*  IC~ O     D *I~N.   I guess if I feel like becoming a drug addict, which is increasingly appealing as a reality antidote, I know where to turn...

      Back in T.O. again.  Spring has sprung.  T.O. looks a lot more like spring than Steeltown, which is odd because it's farther north... less snow though.  Fine by me.  I'm tired of winter boots.  Busy week coming.  Last colloquium of the year on Tuesday.  Glad for that.  I like the talks but I hate the social aspect of the gathering.  Maybe it would help if I could get sloshed on wine like other folks there.  Wednesday I start grading some 50 essays.  Thursday, a chat scheduled that I'm not terribly keen on.  Saturday, a retreat if I'm far enough ahead in my work to permit myself a retreat from the real world for four hours.  Going to try to do a French manicure at home.    More to come...

      Why is it that decision-making is such a hard process?  Lately I have reverted to tossing a coin (which usually lands in the position that, in my gut, I didn't want it to) or I have been having a go at  urlLink Spike's Magic 8 Ball .  There used to be a site on the Internet that would make a decision for you if you provided the bare essential information.  Within three days, it emailed you to tell you what to do.  Can't make up my mind... hate having things up in the air... crossing my fingers for a moment of clarity...  More to come...

      Spoke to someone yesterday who said I was a very angry person.  Part of it, he said, came from still being in a stage of  urlLink grief over the loss of some of my vision .  Seems  urlLink grieving the loss of vision is just like grieving the loss of a loved one , according to the stages as laid out by  urlLink Kubler-Ross .  He seemed pretty eager to talk to me more about it further.  Not sure if I'm willing to do that or not; might just open up an emotional floodgate I've been good at suppressing so far.

      Great visit with a new glauc-doc today.  She did my fields on the spot, checked my IOP, retina, implants and optic nerve and demonstrated a great deal of patience with my list of questions.  A really excellent doctor, completely worth waiting for.  She is also going to monitor me every two months for a little bit while she experiments with taking me off some of the glaucoma medications I am on.  The first to go -- yippee! -- is the oral acetazolamide.  Her reports, by all accounts, were very good.  My eye is more stable than I thought, and while I have a blind spot as a result of the tear (the scar tissue makes it impossible for the images to be processed through my brain in the exact spot opposite to where the retina tore) and I have lost about a ring or two of peripheral vision all the way around my good eye from damage to the optic nerve, I came out of this summer's ordeal relatively well off.  So, good news and I'll see her again in May before I see my retinal guy again in July.  She found my scar from the reattachment surgery and was impressed with how well her colleague had sewn it up last August.  He'll be chuffed. :-)  More to come...

      Cool day at OOTC today.  Spent some time eating and talking with one of the older patrons who has been one of my favourites since I began this project some eight weeks ago.  He asked me if I would sit with him because it would "make him so happy" so I did, and we talked mainly about Martha Stewart and government corruption.  Enjoyed my inaugural patron chat -- usually I hang out in the window serving.  Only three weeks to go.  Came back home, answered email, listened to TV and read/skimmed two novels.  Four to go tomorrow plus a library trip and dinner with Miki.    Got to get over my phone phobia.  Important call to make tomorrow :p  More to come...

      Loved this reflection.  "Often, when a family keeps vigil around a person who is preparing for death, they may notice three interwoven activities. First, the dying person may become more prayerful and reflective than ever before, reviewing life's journey in gratitude to God, or seeking forgiveness and making amends for wrong. Second, as death approaches, the need to eat and drink is lessened until even an ice cube brushed against the lips is satisfying. Third, persons who are dying often make plans to give their possessions away, making bequests, handing treasures down, providing for favourite charities. Prayer, fasting, and almsgiving: with these three "pillars" of Lent, we rehearse our death every year in this season, and anticipate the final work we will do in this life. And every year, at the end of our journey, is the joy of Easter and the experience of the victory of Christ over death's darkness and power. Annually, we remind ourselves that the Christian experiences the same power and presence at the end of life's journey: Christ to the rescue, and the lasting joy of heaven."

      OOTC today.  Very busy!  They noticed I was missing last week when I was seriously nauseous and said they missed me.  Thought that was nice.  Did some bread cutting, went to get the meat/cheese/soup (first time... guess I 'graduated') and did serving for our biggest crowd since I started in January.  No rhyme or reason for it... after Welfare Wednesdays we have a really big crowd but it falls off towards the end of the month.  Somewhat odd.  Slept and watched TV this afternoon.

      Went to the CNIB today.  Not only am I eligible to register, but I picked up my first  urlLink hands-free magnifier .  It hangs around my neck on a cord so my hands are kept free for writing or typing while the object below me is magnified 2x.  The CNIB had magnifiers that go up to 10x but you lose space as the magnification increases and for now, I don't think I need them.  If my needs change, though, it's good to know there are many more options.   They also had lamp/magnifier combinations so you can adjust your light and magnifier according to your needs.  Very clever.  So, while I may feel like a dork for needing the device I got, I feel more confident about my ability to read my textbook for Psych.    More to come...

      Today has been action packed.  I left The Big Smoke at 9:00am and arrived in Steeltown at 9:50am.  Uneventful trip, mercifully.  While sorting through my stack of mail upon arriving home, I discovered that Fr. Nouwen's book "Can You Drink The Cup?" had arrived from Amazon, my Little White Book from the Diocese of Saginaw finally arrived and I now proudly own and wear my very own Medic-Alert necklet (which says a mouthful, I can tell you!).  Went shopping this afternoon.  Got a Panasonic digital recorder that uploads into your computer up to eight hours of continuous recording. Works for me!  I hope it works for my Psych class, too.  It's so tiny I'll have to be sure I don't lose it.  Also picked up a gift for one of my friends' birthdays.  I happened upon a CD I own and thought it would be perfect for her.   May I highly recommend Stuart Hamilton's  urlLink Vinyl Cafe ?   Very CBC, very Canadian.  You'll fall off your chair laughing.  Rounded out my trip with a little keychain flashlight to solve my dark restaurant scenario fears, and a green grading pen for Monday.  Look out 204 kiddies, I'm ready to determine if you will pass or fail in a non-psychologically damaging colour!    Other than that, quiet here.   Beautiful, un-April-like weather at 80F (26.6C).  We're not complaining!  Tomorrow is expected to be similar with a few showers thrown in for fun.  More to come...

       urlLink Rancho Relaxo  was a smoke hole.  Food was okay, but I'm not really a huge fan of Mexican, apparently.  I think it was the refried beans.  They reminded me too much of an article I'd just read online about  urlLink Viennese "poo bags" .   Lighting was absolutely awful.  I couldn't even see the words on the menu, much to the amusement/astonishment of one of my less-than-sensitive companions.  She made a good point, though.  How am I going to be able to go out on a romantic date with a hot guy in a cozy little Italian restaurant and explain that I can't read the menu?  Do I admit I have a disability right up front (way to ruin the mood!), or look like a total freak and pull out my flashlight from my purse?  (I could just picture that now: "Sorry, lighting is atrocious.  Excuse the flashlight and pass the wine list?")  Incidentally, we were right about  urlLink Rancho Relaxo and  The Simpsons  connection .  In the episode "Homer Alone", Marge has a nervous breakdown.  She watches television and catches an advertisement for "Rancho Relaxo'', Springfield's only two-star health spa and decides that's where she is going to go for a few days of peace.  Of course, in Simpsons style, all heck breaks loose.  The CBC is running a contest to allow us to decide who the Greatest Canadian is.   urlLink Cast your vote today .   I had a really hard time deciding between P.E.T., Glenn Gould, Robertson Davies and Jean Vanier.  In the end I went with  urlLink Jean Vanier  for his humanitarian efforts and worldwide impact.  Truly a living example of the preferential option for the poor.  If they had a contest for the Greatest Looking Canadian, I'd vote for P.E.T.'s number one son,  urlLink Justin .  Yummy.  Finally heard back from the mediator for the sponsorship in two weeks.  They know absolutely nothing.  That was useful. :-s  Packed and ready to depart tomorrow morning bright and early.  Just finished a used book deal with a former Psych 100 student.  Have practice tests for the past three years and both textbooks.  Tons of reading.  I really need to get on the magnifier this weekend.  Maybe I will be able to hit the CNIB tomorrow since my dad is on holidays and he can drive.   urlLink Richard Bradshaw  tonight.  He was an intelligent and humorous speaker at Why Wagner? so I'm quite looking forward to hearing this tonight.  I just hope he mentions  Parsifal  or this will be a waste of time.  Seeing my spiritual director Marilyn on Wednesday morning.  Maybe that will help to clarify my future a little.  If only she had a glass ball, or God used flashing neon signs to aid us in our discernment!  Reading Nattiez's  Wagner Androgyne .  Too dense for this time of the morning but I don't really want to lug it back to Steeltown tomorrow.  More to come...

      Crawled up out of the corner, sitting in the middle of my bed cross-legged, not sure if I want my feet to hit the floor or not.  Unsure about where they'll take me next. ***** Found out a few things today.  There's a bursary offered by a couple of religious groups at St. Pete's.  Suspect it is only for St. Pete's, but I gave a brief sob story and asked if it can be used at St. Mike's and if not, if they know of similar external funding.  We'll see.  No work-study; that program was cancelled years ago. ***** Anonymously asked if TST students can live in this residence.  Got an affirmative response.  Hopefully once they find out it's me the rules won't change :-)  Good thing, because that available room from yesterday turned out not to be so available today. ***** Returned D's book and sent him an email to thank him for everything.  Wonder if he'll reply? ***** Might meet with Marilyn next week again.  She is so biased it's hard to know if I'm just caught up in her energy and hopes for me.  Told her I might drop by just to freak out. ***** Sponsor is on holidays until two days before I'm supposed to start my placement.  Called the mediators and missed their return call while I was at Mass.  (D. was celebrant -- always is on Tuesdays.)  Called them back, left voicemail.  No return call. ***** Dad's surgery rescheduled to May 7.  Glad I can be home for that. ***** Looking forward to  Rancho Relaxo .

      Reflection from Rev. Paul Bussard,  The Best Wine: A Series of Notes on Choosing the Better Part .  St. Paul: Catechetical Guild, 1943.  "From  Beauty at its Source:  If you go on as you plan, I think that as you learn to love beauty at its source, all the missing pieces will come to hand, and in the end you will have made a beautiful picture out of what was formerly only a puzzle."  " Futures:     I had rather expected that you would begin to worry.  It is encouraging because it means you have begun to look ahead.  You are examining the future, seeing its trials, its patent impossibilities, and you are experiencing them beforehand.  You are really crossing many bridges, or endeavouring to cross them, before you come to where they are.    I say it is a good sign, but you must not allow yourself to be upset by it.  I think we often make ourselves ill with needless worry.  After all we cannot change the future very much anyhow.  You need only make just a little distinction in order to have done with it all.    There is a future of whose coming you can be certain.  It is the end of your life, say forty or sixty years away.  "Ask and you shall receive" and with God's grace you will be ready when it comes.  Final perseverance is His gift, but you can be very confident that He will not refuse it.  Then there is another future which does not frighten you.  That is today and some of tomorrow -- but not much of the day after tomorrow.  You know what you are going to do today and I do not imagine you have any great fear that you will not be able to carry on till sunset.  These two futures, or aspects of the future do not worry you so much.  But all the days that come in between?  About those we know very little and can do very little.  They are full of dark streams spanned by perilous bridges, uncanny footpaths, and robbers and wild beasts and all such manner of things.  At least you think so.  But, you know, all those tomorrows are only todays coming after one another.  If with God's help you can carry on till sunset today and then until sunrise tomorrow -- why then you can go on infinitely!  Now suppose you sit down quietly and sort your worries out, the way you would pod peas or sort socks.  Put a tag on each one of them with the date written upon it.  Then go over the dates.  If you find any dated "today" or dated "the end of life" -- those you may keep.  But all the others dated in between you can pitch out the window.  They are neither edible nor usable.  Maybe that is what our Lord meant -- sufficient for the day is the evil thereof."

Thought suddenly struck me today: I won't be able to stay in this housing if I do theology.  So, not only will I be penniless, I will also be homeless (theoretically of course) ... I am so mixed up and frustrated and I can't decide if this is God telling me to give up literally everything and follow him (in other words, do theology) or if this is God telling me that I should go with my original decision, which is definitely easier, and do education.    PP was a  big  help.  Quoth he,  "The unforeseen fallout from changing majors (loss of money and housing) is not God saying anything to you by means of those things, it seems to me.  It also seems to me that you are not only discerning a vocation and career, but also mixed in with this is your need for psychological and emotional safety and security.  Indeed, it is possible that this latter need is the one driving everything else.   Your spiritual director needs to know your full story so that all the data needed for a good discernment is in place.  The recent written recommendation you showed me would seem to indicate that your references do not know as much as they perhaps should about you."     I think I'm going to swear for the first time in my blog ...  More to come...

      Do you ever wake up and just think, "I should have stayed in bed this morning?"  Today is one of those mornings.  Woke up with a migraine.  That's the worst; they never seem to go completely away when you wake up with one.   People seem a little on edge today.  Trying to get things done but nothing is happening; can't leave home, waiting for phone call, can't do anything sitting here on my butt, nobody is where I want them to be.  Almost said "nobody is where they should be" but suddenly realized that it's a "be there to answer your phone" style of selfish mentality.  Will leave here at 11am regardless of whether the phone rang or not.  I have to go to the Fac. of Theology, to confession, to Mass, and to a bank machine.    More to come...

      While attending a marriage seminar on communication, a man and his wife listened to the instructor declare: 'It is essential that husbands and wives know the things that are important to each other.  For instance, gentlemen, can you name your wife's favourite flower?'  The husband leaned over, touched his wife's arm gently and whispered, 'Robin Hood All-Purpose, isn't it?'  The rest of the story was not pleasant ...

      I'm so tired of stressing about money and what to do with my future.   Perhaps this wouldn't be so difficult if I had any faith in myself whatsoever.   I think I shall do what my mom did.  Decide on two things and flip a coin.  Heads or tails.  No other factors like loans or fear or vocation.  That easy.    ... Just did it.  It came up Theology.  I can either analyze it to death or just submit the damned application already.    ***** Having some troublesome realizations about D.

      The Googlebombers are at it again.  A search for Waffles with the "I'm feeling lucky" option on Google pulls up  urlLink an unlikely (?) page .  My favourite is still " urlLink miserable failure " with " urlLink weapons of mass destruction " coming in a close second.   " urlLink French military victories " is pretty funny too.

      Been very productive already this morning.  Read three articles in German (!) and am attempting to delve into some Nattiez.  Very heavy.  At least this one is in English.  Why is it that once I've decided not to do something, I become very interested in it?  (sigh)  Got invited to try out Gmail today.  That's the Google email that reads all your email, apparently.  It doesn't have a "delete" button; just invites you never to delete another message again in return for giving you 1000mb of storage space.  Interesting concept.  I shall see how it unfolds.  Went to Mr. Greenjeans last night.  Great food!  Rez is offering cheapie pizza night so I'll be partaking in that as well.  Can't beat two slices for $1.  Did orientation for Extern yesterday.  They assume that because your job description is "student" you packed your brains away someplace and have no intention of using them in "the real world".  Very irritating.  I have come up with about twenty questions for my sponsor but I won't know until Monday what format my placement will take.    More to come...

      I once again worried myself sick over the meeting with D.  He was just as gentle, just as amazing as he was the first visit.  He offered some advice on redemptive suffering, on the fact that I'm nowhere near that yet but that's not terrible.  I need to get through those Kübler-Ross stages first.  We also talked about God's will and not being able to understand it, and that's okay (like a trapeze artist - you're letting go of the one ring behind you, and moving towards what you hope will be a sturdy ring in front of you, but you can't see it and you're literally suspended there in mid-air, unsure of whether there's even a net underneath you, but you have to trust and reach out for that next ring or you will fall.)   We talked a little about Fr. Pat which made me laugh (Marilyn this morning gave me nice anecdotes about him tracking down Denzel Washington for her even though he had no idea who Denzel was!) and D. told me about Fr. Pat's slightly more annoying side and trips in to interrupt D. while he was showering!  He lent me another book - Henri Nouwen's "Can you drink the cup?" - and suggestions on how to read it.   He said that he will always be there, no matter what, not judging me, not thinking less of me for anything that I say, and if I want to feel stupid about needing help, that's up to me, but I shouldn't feel like I'm wasting his time or anything like that.  I gave him a big hug on the way out and I left again feeling like a huge burden has been lifted from my shoulders.  More to come...

      Attended the "Why Wagner?" COC conference today.  It was very well attended and had lots of very renowned Wagner scholars in attendance.  What did I take away that was new and fun?  Most toilets flush in the key of E-flat! :-)  Went to church after the conference.   Got a brunch to attend tomorrow so I picked up some muffins on the way home.  Also tried to get dinner out ... Went to Subway and all of the employees were in the back and despite trying to make them aware of my presence, it didn't work.  I left in a huff.  Then I went into the pizza place next door.  They were restocking the pizza and after I came in, two more people came in.  The last one in pushed her way up to the front and placed her order.  Then the guy behind the counter yelled over top, "Who's next?" and just as I went to open my mouth, the girl behind me ordered.  Standing there mouth agape and near tears for being proverbially stepped on by not one but two people, the girl behind me seemed to notice and said, "Oh sorry, go ahead" and I just said, "No, never mind" and walked out before I burst into tears.  I am such an emotional freak.  I was about to give up and just have a bowl of Cheerios but I tried one more, the burger place next door.  Finally got served in there.  More to come...

      Got some good news.  D. emailed; we're meeting on Tuesday afternoon.  Glad he just got too busy and forgot about me rather than hating me (thanks Mind over Mood)!  More good news; the   urlLink Amazing Race   is coming back with their fifth installment on July 6 at 9:30 (10:00 weeks thereafter.)  Instead of Moley Moley, we now have Alison and Donny from   urlLink Big Brother  .  Lord have mercy.  I'll watch it regardless, but they better get booted out really early on!  Just polished off that carrot cake from yesterday.  Geez, this dieting thing really isn't working well.  I don't care whether I carry my weight well or not (M).  I'm v. fat and need to fix it.  Guy across the road who always smokes on his balcony has hung out a Maple Leafs flag.  Big hockey night tonight.  As all the TTC buses say on their digital displays, "Go Leafs Go! Take the Rocket to the ACC" (well, I guess I don't really need that second part.)  Actually did some work on my diss. proposal.  I got right into reformatting my bibliography and dividing it into subject headings.  Quite the task.  Not done, but at least I really spent some good time doing it.  That's it.

      Just lost a blog for the first time in a long time.  Can I just say Grrr!  I was up really early this morning (not by choice).  I officially went to bed at about midnight after having some odd hallucinatory episode.  I think the Starnoc I took reacted in me badly and I kept blacking in and out and can’t remember what I did except try to program a TV show on my VCR and I thought the TV was talking to me and little kids were laughing at me … very, very odd.  I finally woke up at 6:10 this morning and didn’t try to get back to sleep.  I went over to UC to get a book, Annie Dillard’s “Teaching a Stone to Talk.”  It was well written and she had a few passages about Advent at her Catholic parish.  Amusing but not thigh-slappingly so.  The council meeting last night was like pulling teeth.  Very petty, too much bickering.  I almost moved a motion that everyone just shut up already.  Thankfully the president beat me to it and moved to adjourn.  There were no objections.  Fr. M. went on and on about his weight yesterday.  He tried the South Beach diet and went down to 205, then “ate the whole beach” (quoth he) and is now at 228 again. I literally had to bite the inside of my cheeks not to laugh or smile when he asked me in all seriousness, “Do you think I carry it well?”  Emailed D.  Been waiting two and a half weeks for a response.  Trying   so   hard not to mind-read why (he didn’t like me, he thinks I’m weird, he wants me to go away, etc. etc. etc.)  I did call the office at 9:30 but he wasn’t in.  Did I want to leave a voicemail?  No thanks; that’s what didn’t work last time.  I emailed with a return receipt instead so at least I will know if he opens it or not.   I explained there’s a strong chance I’m leaving May 5 so I need to know if a meeting is possible or not.  I really hope so.  It is just glorious here.  16C and sunny.  Not a single cloud in the sky.  However, even despite my walk this morning, I am totally, completely, hopelessly unmotivated.  It has been 4 months to the day since I contacted C.S. but still haven’t heard back from them.  I need to do a little work to appease my sup. but that’s not in my realm of possibilities today.  I just want to lay in bed, under the covers, and sleep or pretend to sleep.  Normally I’d walk over to St. Basil’s now, but I just can’t bring myself to do it today.  Oh well.  I need to reserve my energy for tomorrow’s crazy, hectic day.  Watching S.O. live for a change.  Susan’s long-lost birth father might be on the line … I have goosebumps.  I can only imagine what she’s feeling!  I have been filling up my listless times with reading S.O. message boards.  The posters are so funny!  I’m disappointed I won’t probably get to see the second season but I live in hope.  Anyway, the posters all seem to hate Rhonda.  I didn’t realize how intense this was!   It makes truly entertaining reading, even if they are reading into personal issues of hers that don’t necessarily exist.   You doing okay E.?   Haven’t seen you online or blogging lately.

      Fr. M. just left.  He did almost all the talking about personal details and some parish information, including a big hush-hush secret that totally makes my offer to him redundant.  He was polite enough to not say no, but said he would go away and think and pray about it.   He said that I sell myself very well; he kept flipping through the pages and re-reading them when he was here.    The food seemed to be a hit; apparently he's a cheese-aholic.  Glad that I picked some up as an afterthought.  He asked how I was doing "emotionally" and I told him about talking to Fr. D. (perhaps I shouldn't have?  He might have wondered why I didn't go to him instead... oh well.)  I also mentioned about my school decisions, and he seemed somewhat disappointed.  Well, he didn't "seem" disappointed; he said he was disappointed.  Gee, thanks  for the support ;-)     I just got back from walking him back to his car (he's the type who could easily get lost) and he gave me a lift back up the parking garage ramp so I could listen to Jesus Christ Superstar.  Go Judas.  More to come...

      Fr. M. called at 10:15 to verify that he's coming at 1 or 1:15.  I'm glad; I would have had to kill him if he reneged after all of the food and kitchenware I bought just for his visit!  When he rang, I was laying out cookies, crackers and cheese.  Got the utensils cleaned up and just have to boil the kettle and slice the carrot cake when he actually shows up.  Whew.  I hate entertaining... we'll have to see if my little proposal to him goes over well or if he laughs in my face.  I can be pretty persuasive but this is a long shot.  P.P. gave me a good opener though so fingers crossed...   Turned my laundry pink this morning.  I have never, ever done that before and I am quite peeved that I did it now.  I was sure that I had washed the hell out of my maroon table cover enough that it wouldn't bleed, but obviously I was mistaken.  So, second load is in (the pink didn't come out, btw) and will be folded in a few minutes.  Thank goodness I didn't opt to wash any of my good clothes with it - just sheets and towels.  MGSA meeting tonight at 7 followed by a social.  What a crappy time.  Don't they know it's Survivor night, American Idol results night and finale night for The Apprentice?

      Busy morning!  More stuff-for-pastor visit.  I went to The Bay (had a gift cert.) and got a mauve teapot, cream holder and sugar bowl on sale, as well as two purple 99 cent mugs.  They more or less match my iris dinnerware.  Took the subway back here, washed everything, then left for SMC.  Dropped off OOTC reflection to Fr. Terry, picked up  The Mike  for  urlLink a nice article in Memoriam on Fr. Pat , then dropped into Mass.  Celebrant was Fr. D.  OK, I still haven't heard from him.  Two weeks now.  What's the grace period on returning a phone call anyway?  Dropped into  urlLink Rabba  for lunch, milk and, as it turns out, cheese-for-pastor.  This is getting expensive!  I think I have everything now.  Roommate M. is lending me some sugar so at least I don't have to go buy a pound of sugar I will use a teaspoon of.   Only forgot to look for a pot holder.  I will be creative and improvise with a newspaper or socks or something... :-)  M. called.  She is under the weather so no  urlLink Mr. Greenjeans  for us tonight.  No A.I. either; Pres. Bush is going to be yammering on about something.  Came home, ate, watched S.O.  Stupid today.  Glad Amy fixed her roots, though! :-)    Can't register for Psych until April 20.  Hope there's still space by then.  I will try at 6am and then let the secretary know if I got in or not.     So don't feel like working on my diss. proposal.

It was the best of both worlds for us; the Pacers (top team in the league) won so the Raptors are knocked out of the playoffs, and the Raptors scored 90 points so we all get a free slice of pizza! :-)  (In the first quarter, a fan is selected to spin a wheel deciding the number of points the Raptors must get for us to get free pizza - it was 90.)

      Everyone in the audience seemed to be filled with anticipation of THE event in opera history in Toronto this afternoon – the premiere of  Die Walküre , the Canadian Opera Company’s first production of this work since 1976.  Incest, murder, adultery, suicidal gestures – the story alone would keep us entertained.  Many marveled at the size of the orchestra; my old horn teacher was playing 8th horn so I was pleased about that.  As the house lights dimmed, we were asked to rise for the arrival of the Governor General, Adrienne Clarkson.  I was mildly amused that mostly everyone applauded for her, and although I couldn’t see her from my seat perched high above the orchestra level seating, I was later told she entered just like the Queen would have done – graceful, with a flip of her hand and with a large entourage.   The orchestra quickly plunged into  O Canada  and to my surprise again, mostly everyone began to sing so I joined in.  Afterwards, without hesitation Richard Bradshaw jumped into the overture and the opera was underway.  I was nervous about Acts II and III after seeing Act I.  As the opera opened, the lighting was dark, desolate.  The characters moved only slightly while singing their lines.   The tree in which Nothung is placed was broken off at the stump in three parts, lying in the centre of the stage, surrounded by dirt.  They did use a ‘real’ fire in Hunding’s house which was impressive, but that was the only visual highlight.   During all the dialogue, several people around me were drifting off to sleep, and I will admit I was one of them.  At least two people around me were snoring loudly.  Not a great way to start.   By the end of the act, though, there were some promising signs; the lighting brightened up and most of us who were nodding (literally) off to sleep became interested again.  Many people who were not familiar with the story were commenting during the first intermission about finding the incestuous relationship between Sieglinde and Siegmund very creepy.   I wonder if they didn’t have surtitles banging away the story if they would even realize what was going on?  Act II was a major improvement.  Even though the Fricka/Wotan confrontation is purported to be one of the driest sections of the Ring cycle, there were so many visual aspects to keep the audience’s interest that the sleeping problem in the first act was resolved for most of the audience.  The scene looked like a dance studio or acting studio with big square ceramic tiles, many of which were heaved up and in disarray around the centre of the stage.  There was dirt where the tiles should have been and Wotan was digging a grave here while Fricka, yapping away, ordered him to kill his son.  There were also roughly sixteen corpses wrapped in white shrouds laying all around the stage.   Along the top and sides of the scene, there were catwalks falling down (used by the Valkyries to cart in corpses) and big, working track lighting with spotlights on them, which appeared as if they had fallen from the ceiling. (These spotlights were dimmed and raised depending on the scene throughout the rest of the opera).   So, Fricka yells, Wotan digs.  The audience suddenly becomes aware of the corpse in front of him who blends in so well with the dirt and who is not covered in a shroud; this man is in a fetal position with both of his hands covering his eyes as if he died from fear, covering his eyes from something horrible.  (All the designer, Michael Levine, would reveal is that this is an Industrial Age set and something terrible has happened, but the audience won’t know exactly what happened until  Götterdämmerung  in 2006.)  The scene changes to the forest (just dimmed lighting with that big tree that never goes away) where Sieglinde tells Siegmund her premonition – he must die.  Enter Brünnhilde, carrying a white shroud for Siegmund.  This was a deliciously morbid moment when you realize why she’s carrying the shroud; it’s the same type as the other corpses are wrapped in.  Finally she unrolls the shroud and stands on the tree trunk and a flickering fire image (thanks to the stage design crew at the back of the auditorium) is emblazoned on the sheet (used like a screen projector).  VERY cool (except the flame image got stuck a couple of times, which was a bit disconcerting, but I’m sure they’ll fix it sooner or later.)  Brünnhilde holds this sheet up the whole time that she tells Siegmund he has to come to Valhalla until he refuses and rips the sheet out of her hand.  Of course, the scene ends with Wotan having to kill Siegmund and being mighty ticked off about it.   Finally, Act III was fabulous.  Everyone was anticipating the Ride of the Valkyries.  The Valkyries, as was previewed in the second act, now had at least 50 shrouded corpses and many more shrouded corpses were carried in along the catwalk and some dropped down from the ceiling on ropes while Valkyries below got them down and sorted them into piles.  Again, there’s no other way to say it except it was deliciously morbid.  A few kinks need to be worked out though; two Valkyries dropped one of the corpses who came from the ceiling on its head and couldn’t get the rope off from around its neck, and kept smashing its head onto the floor trying to free it from the rope.  (Fortunately the corpses were dummies and not real people…)  On the far right of the stage, one of the corpses was dropped and its head rolled off.  My guess is he won’t make the best guard ever for Valhalla without his head… Otherwise, a unique and interesting take on the infamous Ride scene.  They used some pyrotechnics at the end (fortunately not a cop out like Jürgen Flimm’s production in Bayreuth with the human microwave instead of fire…); the Valkyries each carried out two torches and placed them in the floor in a circle around Brünnhilde.  The direction by Atom Egoyan for Wotan during the fire scene was fabulous; he took off his outer coat and placed it over the sleeping Brünnhilde, and after he tenderly kissed away her godliness, he took off his under coat (leaving him in just a muscle shirt – I wasn’t too sure about that) and placed it under her head as a pillow.  Just a beautiful, touching scene with a father who is so reluctant to have to punish his beloved daughter like this.  Too many directors leave Wotan mad at her and have him storm off angrily, but this version made him more ‘human’, emotional and accessible.    The orchestra was in good shape.  One of the cornets was having some consistent difficulty hitting the right notes and the principal horn, trombone and clarinet each had some pitch/note problems at various solo entries, but overall they were powerful, accurate and endured throughout the whole four and a half hours quite well.  The singers were overall good.  It was nice to have some Canadian talent up there, especially Frances Ginzer as Brünnhilde.  She was so beautiful and had such a powerful voice the orchestra couldn’t cover her voice even in the low register.  The same can’t be said for Wotan and Fricka, whose performances I found disappointing.  Wotan did not look like a demi-god and that somewhat detracted from his performance; he looked more like a cross between John Malkovich and Randy “Macho Man” Savage (from WWE Wrestling) instead of a powerful, dignified god. Sieglinde and Siegmund were decent, as were the Valkyries.  Nice costuming as well (except that muscle shirt…)  I shall be interested to see what the inevitable review in the Toronto Star will say tomorrow, but in my humble and somewhat biased opinion, despite a few minor issues to work out, the production staff, cast and crew ought to be very proud of themselves for a job very well done.  They took on a Herculean task, did not back down, and left the audience eagerly awaiting the next installment one year from now.  Bravissimo.

       You're an hour late!   (Unless you remembered to change your clock last night...)  So the  urlLink $30 million man  has fled.   He'll only redeem himself in my eyes if he gives his kids a decent portion of his winnings.   I won't comment on the three ex-wives...  As the Toronto Star said today, we're reveling this seventh day in  urlLink music history  happening in Toronto.   Renée Fleming is at Roy Thomson Hall, Isabel Bayrakdarian is appearing with the TSO, and at our very own barn the Canadian Opera Company will premiere Richard Wagner's  Ring  cycle with the opening of  Die Walküre , directed by Atom Egoyan and designed by Michael Levine.   I have a ticket, of course, to the latter, which I am clutching as if it were gold.  The tickets have sold out to most of the six performances.   You go,  urlLink Richard .  So, in anticipation of this four-and-a-half hour spectacle, which I have never seen in a stand-alone production, I shall be packing my purse full of inconspicuous goodies and preparing for the musical event of the year in Toronto.   I couldn't sleep last night but I won't let that hinder the excitement...  More to come...

      Not much to report.  I went to early Mass to say happy retirement to the sacristan and his wife who have served at my old parish for 35 years.

      Saw my glauc-doc this morning.  Really sweet lady; she let me ask all of my questions up front and took the time to answer them carefully.   We're eliminating the Xalatan on a trial basis because she discovered some inflammation in my iris that wasn't there before (perhaps an allergic reaction to the Xalatan or Alphagan, but historically, Xalatan is harder on patients so we're going to get rid of it first.)  The inflammation might explain why things have been so painful recently.  She's going to do a letter for a Canada Study Grant for high-need individuals with permanent disabilities and she's going to send in the CNIB registration form so they can help me with visual aids.  My vision hasn't changed since the last visit so we're both glad about that, and the pressure was good today (13 O.S., 16 O.D.).    urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink     I got an email from my course advisor at USMC and we're going to meet early next week to select my courses. I'm hoping for 2 philosophies and 3 theologies per term.  I also have my eye on a history of Church music course (for upper-years, unfortunately) that, I think, would be a nice respite for me.

      So, it's time to think about voting for our federal government again.  The politicians have been ripping each other apart for weeks now amidst scandals and embarrassments.  So, who will it be?   urlLink Paul Martin and the Liberals  for a fourth straight majority government?  How about  urlLink Stephen Harper and the Conservatives ?  He shares the same birthday with Hitler, by the way.  Or perhaps  urlLink Jack Layton with the NDP ?  Personally, I'm so disillusioned right now I would vote  urlLink Bloc Quebecois  if I was allowed to.  I could always write that in on the ballot, or cast a vote for the  urlLink Marijuana Party  as a protest vote.  I have to vote by advance poll, so I think June 19 looks like my date.

      Not as busy today as yesterday (thank goodness!)  I got up at the usual time, headed over to Accessibility Services and registered for my Psych. tests.  I also booked an appointment with my Disability Advisor to renew my accommodations for next year.   After I returned home, I did some work and then headed over to noon Mass.  D. is always the celebrant on Tuesdays.  A movie was being shot somewhere on or near SMC campus so there were movie production trailers blocking most of the street I walk down to get to church.  Consequently, I took a more winding route through the campus and as I was heading up to the church, I heard, "Why, hi there!" from behind me.  It was D!  We exchanged pleasantries and he remarked that it was Tuesday and that was a good thing (actually, I couldn't remember so that was helpful :-))  Before he headed into the office and I headed into the church, I mentioned that after 15 weeks of waiting, I was finally going to CALSS today. He was pleased and wished me luck, calling it a step forward.     urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink     Heading over there now.  Yikes.  More to come...

      Psychology had an interesting start this evening.  The lecturer seems very good and obviously interested in the topic, which is helpful.  We covered the history of psychology and a few preliminary definitions tonight after a 51-minute discussion of how to do well in the course.  It's intimidating but I'm sure it will be okay.  Hey, if not, I can drop it after the first or second test once I know about the other path on the horizon.  More to come...

      The long-awaited, long-contested Psychology course starts today.  Our first test is three weeks from tonight.  How insane is that?  Three weeks after that is our mid-term.  They should throw the word "intensive" into all summer course titles I think.  When I took Beginner's Intensive German a few summers ago, I thoroughly appreciated the "intensive" part so I knew what was coming.  We have to be subjects in four experiments for this course as our participation mark.  I wonder what mental probing they will do to us.  It's going to be a busy summer.  I watched a comedian on  Comedy Now!  last night.  Her name was  urlLink Nikki Payne , and she told the tale of growing up in the Maritimes in a trailer park with a lisp.  Talk about a triple whammy. :-)  Well, Nikki did this bit about wanting to lose some weight.  She said she went to her doctor and got some diet pills, but she noticed on the label that one of the side effects was "anal leakage."  At this point she starts to giggle nervously and announces to the room, "I look great but I smell like shit!"  I laughed so hard I almost fell out of bed.   urlLink    Nikki Payne&nbsp; urlLink     More to come...

      Papa lay dying and his sons and daughters were gathered around him in the family bedroom. The eldest son moved forward and respectfully asked, "Papa, is there anything you want?"   The old man whispered, "Yes, one last wish. I smell something familiar and delicious. It smells like your mother's apple strudel. Bring me a piece of your mother's strudel. There is none better."   The son was gone to the kitchen longer than expected. When he returned empty handed, the dying father asked, "What took you so long? And why no apple strudel?"   The son looked with a sad face and said, "Papa, you know how mama is. Always so practical and so strict. She says the strudel is for after the funeral."

      Yesterday marked the nine month anniversary of Blackout 2003.  It is commonly believed that the number of conceptions increases during natural disasters or crises. Nine months after such events reports about "baby booms" in local hospitals invariably appear in the media.    In our case, these reports appeared in August 2003, in the hours and days after the power came back on.  I saw a report on our local news channel last night, however, indicating that the media had contacted various local hospitals and discovered that the number of babies being born in the maternity ward right now are actually less than is normally expected for this time of year.   urlLink Snopes  has a good article refuting this common myth as well.    urlLink    Photo of the Toronto skyline during Blackout 2003 by Mike Nowland   &nbsp; urlLink     More to come...

      Reflecting on blindness today.  I did a search for blogs on blindness and surprisingly, I didn't turn up any.  I did find one girl in Holland who is 17 and has congenital glaucoma and 8% vision left, but nothing else.  (If any readers can recommend some to me, I'd be grateful to know of them!)   What makes us so afraid of blindness?  Sambo poses the question in his  urlLink blog  whether blindness or death would be preferable.  Happily he chose blindness.    I think we're all blind in some way.  We're blind to the people around us who need us.  We're blind to our own issues and our own faults.  We're blind to the obvious.  We're blind to future and sometimes we're blind to the past as well.     Likewise, blindness has a distinct way of making other things more visible to us.  The subtle inflections in another's voice.  The wind rustling the leaves in the tree.  An acuity of direction.  A visual disability doesn't mean the end of life.  While I don't think anybody would choose blindness over sight, there's a whole host of opportunities and new types of sight that can be gained if only we are open to them.   urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink     More to come...

      A new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly speak.  After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done.  The monsignor replied, "When I am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water glass.  If I start to get nervous, I take a sip."   So the following Sunday the new priest took the monsignor's advice. At the beginning of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink. He proceeded to talk up a storm.  Upon his return to his office after mass, he found the following note taped to the door:   1. Sip the Vodka, don't gulp.  2. There are 10 commandments, not 12.  3. There are 12 disciples, not 10.  4. Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.  5. Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass.  6. We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J. C.  7. The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not referred to as Daddy, Junior and the Spook.  8. David slew Goliath, he did not kick the shit out of him.  9. When David was hit by a rock and was knocked off his donkey, don't say he was stoned off his ass.  10. We do not refer to the cross as the "Big T."  11. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he said, "Take this and eat it for it is my body." He did not say "Eat me"  12. The Virgin Mary is not called "Mary with the Cherry,"  13. The recommended grace before a meal is not "Rub-A-Dub-Dub thanks for the grub, yay God!"  14.

      Four Catholic women were having coffee one morning and bragging about their sons.  The first Catholic woman says, "My son is a priest, when he walks in a room, everyone says 'Hello, Father'".   The second Catholic woman says, "My son is a Bishop. When he walks in a room, everyone says to him, 'Hello, Your Grace'".   The third Catholic woman says, "My son is a Cardinal. When he walks into a room, everyone greets him 'Your Eminence'".   Then all three turn to the fourth woman and give her a subtle "Well?" expression.   She finally sips her coffee then says, "My son is 6'4", terribly handsome, broad shoulders, dresses in the finest clothes.  When he enters a room, the women all say, 'Oh, my God' . . ."

      I invigilated an exam today.  This is perhaps the only job on the planet where you are paid $32/hr to do nothing except watch other people write things down, and occasionally to walk a 20-year-old to the bathroom and back.  Glorified kindergarten.  It wasn't all boring, though.  I had to laugh as I scanned the room and I spotted a young man sitting in the very centre of theatre, wearing a bright red T-shirt, who had long hair and a beard and frankly, he looked like Jesus. The fact that he stood out wasn't a problem.  It became a problem when I was scanning the room and I noticed that instead of writing, he was staring up at the front most of the exam, and we continually met eyes.  After this happened a few times, he started smiling at me.  As hard as I tried not to look at him, I couldn't keep that up for very long.  Eventually I would glance at him and see him with a big, broad smile on his face.  When the other TA and I passed each other, I whispered, "Jesus keeps smiling at me."  Knowing exactly which student I was talking about, she started to laugh and replied, "Jesus loves you."  I retorted, "Jesus is giving me the creeps."  Maybe you had to be there but it was my highlight of an otherwise boring afternoon.   More to come...

      Came back to school today on the most packed bus I have ever seen for that frequent route between Steeltown and Hogtown.  Glad I got a seat, anyway...  Trip was uneventful.  When I got back to my flat, I found the old roommate was gone and a new roommate coming tomorrow.  Maintenance was here cleaning up for her arrival.  I shifted my stuff in the kitchen so that I get my allowable cupboard space.  It's only fair.  Fridge too.  I'm tired of being the lowest guy on the totem pole.  Going to  urlLink Milestone's  for spinach and artichoke dip tonight.  So good; haven't indulged in it since early 2002.  N. is coming in from her small out-of-the-way town to Hogtown for a visit.    This is going to be a strangely busy week.  J. from Calgary is visiting tomorrow so we're having breakfast.  I'm invigilating an exam all afternoon, then have Rosary group at 7 (if I have enough time and I'm not half-past dead).  Tuesday is worse -- from 9am until a time undetermined I'm doing a joint grading session with the three other TAs and the instructor.  This could be painful; I think having them all there talking will be distracting when I just want to grade and go.  Have to track down my sponsor this week and find out when I'm working next week as well.  Wednesday, I meet Marilyn for a last minute, reassuring meeting (I hope!) and then it's back to Steeltown for my dad's surgery.  No rest for the wicked.  Time to figure out what to wear and when I have to leave to get to Union Station.  More to come...

      This weekend is Good Shepherd Sunday.  Our pastor got up and compared us to lambs, running around directionless until we allow ourselves to be tended to by Jesus, the Good Shepherd.  He said, "God doesn't want to turn us into pork chops!  He loves us!"  Without missing a beat, the woman behind me said fairly loudly, "That really WOULD be a miracle if God turned us from lambs into PORK chops!" :-D

      I was staring at my feet today and noticed my sandals are beginning to disintegrate.  I bought my pair of  urlLink Rohdes  (they look most like the last pair on that page) in 1994 at a specialty shoe store in Steeltown.    Since then, they have adorned my feet on countless journeys.  Closer to home, they have walked in many cities, towns and countryside between Peterborough and Sarnia, Ontario.  They have walked in the water of Lake Ontario, Lake Huron, Lake Erie and the Atlantic Ocean.  They walked in the Pacific Ocean off the Strait of Juan de Fuca.  Ten years ago, they walked over the grave of G.F. Handel in Westminster Abbey.  Shortly after that, they walked through the Tower of London where St. Thomas More and many others spent their last days.  They toured around the Coliseum, through the Vatican and St. Peter's, up the Eiffel Tower, through Innsbruck and Munich and Koeln and Lucerne and Firenze.  They rode in a gondola in Venice and on a canal boat in Amsterdam.  They trekked along the white sandy shores of Florida, overlooked the Canadian and American versions of Niagara Falls, and they returned to Europe in 2001.  They walked through the house of Richard Wagner, walked up Green Hill in the footsteps of so many famous individuals including G.B. Shaw, Robertson Davies and Adolf Hitler.  They stopped into the home of J.P. Richter and the home where Franz Liszt breathed his last.  They tread lightly on the sacred ground that is the birth home of Robert Schumann in Zwickau.  They paused with reverence at the Grabkapelle of Franz Liszt in the Stadtfriedhof and with amusement at the signs around Bavaria, in particular at Kronach, that indicated that "Goethe slept here __1__ night(s)."   With all of this history under their feet, so to speak, I hate to throw out these now wilting soles of history.  More to come...

       Update from the last entry : I picked up my actual test booklet about 30 minutes ago.  I did indeed get 94% on the m/c.   Yesterday's fiasco :  I arrived 20 minutes early at the test centre to write my exam and was informed that I had been given the wrong location, and I was to report to a library about 10 minutes away.  Slightly ruffled but having not completely lost it (yet), I ran like hell and found the library to check in to write my test.  Upon reviewing my accommodations, the most critical of which are enlarged print and halogen lighting, Invigilator A informed me that this location was not equipped with extra lighting and therefore I would have to make due with a dark cubby hole with a single flickering fluorescent light, and, oh by the way, my exam was not available in large-print.  (This latter detail was just a repeat of what happened three weeks earlier so I had been expecting that.)  However, already stressed to the max and irritable from the series of mix ups, I angrily informed them that I wanted to lodge a protest and explained that the only reason I write with them is because I am partially-sighted and require these two things or I cannot write the test. Invigilator A called the supervisor who ordered Invigilator B to come to retrieve a halogen lamp (NB: from the location I checked into erroneously to begin with!) and while there, Invigilator B enlarged my test to 11x17 paper.  While I calmed down and waited over half an hour for this entire process to happen, Invigilator A informed me that I am exceptional where their service is concerned.  90% of the students who use the Test Writing Centre are there because of learning disabilities and only require extra time and therefore, the supervisor tends to be extremely sloppy with physical and sensory disabilities and regularly makes mistakes, omits accommodations, and so on.  Invigilator A mentioned that every single time she had been proctoring a large-print exam, only a small-print version had been provided so she had to leave the other students who were writing unattended, enlarge the exam and then return with it so the visually impaired student could begin writing.  Finally, she gently suggested I write a complaint in the hopes that this wouldn't happen at my next test on July 21.  After a long wait, my halogen lamp and large-print exam showed up and I was able to start.  You already read the results (at least of the first section; the second section will be known in approximately two weeks) above.   Update on yesterday's fiasco:   Last night I wrote the letter of complaint, quite polite given my mood, detailing what had happened and asking that my file be marked in some way for future reference that I need special equipment or else I cannot write.  I received the following response from the program supervisor this morning: "I am would like   to apologize for the problems that occurred during your exams and thank you for emailing me to let me know.  I will make a note of this, and will be sure that this doesn't happen again!   Again, thank you for letting me know and we will be sure that this is filed.  I hope that once everything was cleared up and you got writing that everything went smoother.  I can understand how frustrating this was for you and we do apologize.  Best wishes, and thank you for this email!"  We'll see if she really means it or not in three weeks.   The moral of this story:  I suppose the moral would be to follow up everything in minute detail and assume that everyone else on the planet is incompetent.  It never ceases to amaze me that the professor and the department are so helpful and flexible where my special needs are concerned, yet the people who are supposed to be attuned to the needs of those with disabilities, the Accommodations Service, are the least accommodating folks on campus.

      I have been very busy today.  I did spring cleaning (well, yes, technically summer cleaning, but I'm perpetually late in these matters) in my residence room today and dumped a ton of stuff I don't need.  The place is now sparkling.  After that, I went to Mass (good old D. was there again) and returned home to start my Psych reading for the third quarter of the course.   At 3pm, I went over to pick up my exam booklet.  Accessibility still hadn't delivered it so I got a blank copy and checked my answers from memory against the answers on the website.  I got 94% on the multiple choice!  Now, the short answer (at least the last one) wasn't so pretty, so I imagine I will end up with a grade in the neighbourhood of 85-87 again this time, which suits me just fine.  The Psych coordinator just wrote to say my own booklet arrived so I should go get it.    More to come...

      Well, today's the big day in Canada.  The national newspapers have proclaimed that we will definitely be under a minority rule after today's election, but they can't predict whose rule since it is much too close to call.  I have my money on the Liberals, but who knows.  Don't forget to vote.  This is perhaps the most exciting election in our lifetimes.  On a more personal note, today is my midterm in Psychology.  I think I have prepared as well as I possibly can, and I know it's too late to acquire any more new knowledge at this juncture.  I did my final practice test (second-time through) this morning and scored 96% on it (woo-hoo!).  If only the actual test were that straightforward!  I have time for one more review of my notes, a little bite to eat and then I must depart for testing.  Wish me luck ...  More to come...

      I returned to Hogtown today in the middle of the Pride Parade 2004.  As I mentioned before, I think it's a wonderful thing, I support it and yet there's nothing more frustrating than being stuck at Union Station carrying 20lbs worth of crap and trying to get home on overcrowded subways.  I managed to time my trip perfectly so I wouldn't coincide with the revellers coming into or out of the downtown core.  I did my fourth (out of five) practice test for the exam for tomorrow.  Scored 94%.  I can dig it.  I hope tomorrow's is as palatable.  Off to get some grub.  More to come...

      I went to see Michael Moore's  Fahrenheit 9/11  this afternoon.  What a compelling movie.  Many of the conspiracy theories are already floating around out there on the Internet, but Moore has a way of telling the story in a humourous, horrifying, sorrowful and intriguing way.  I cannot recommend it highly enough; I'm also awfully proud of  urlLink Jean Chretien  for his lack of contribution in Iraq.    Spoke to M.D. tonight.  Embarrassed him in front of his cronies by asking him politely but with a touch of disappointment in my voice why he hadn't returned my important phone call in over three weeks.  He said he hadn't had time to consider my proposal (of March 13, 2004) yet and didn't know what to say.  I informed him (less than gently) that the proposal didn't matter; I had been accepted to theology in Hogtown on a full-time basis in September, and that's why I wanted to speak to him.  The others looked at him and he said sadly, "I didn't get your message."  Total lie.  He and the others congratulated me profusely.    More to come...

       urlLink Mattie Stepanuk  died yesterday.  He was 13 years old and suffered from  urlLink dysautonomic mitochondrial myopathy , a complex form of muscular dystrophy.      I first saw  urlLink Mattie on Oprah  a few years ago and was deeply touched by his poetry and his positive attitude.  He is the author of five books, all bearing the title "Heartsongs" in some form.  His website lists his motto as: "Think gently, speak gently, live gently."  Doesn't that ring true in our dealings not only with others but also with ourselves.  What a truly inspiring young man and a portrait of courage even while enduring difficult health problems.     Sleep gently, Mattie.  More to come...

      Today has been what can only be described as bumpy.  I went to one of the libraries on campus and spent thirty minutes searching for three sources to no avail.  They didn't own the Canadiana sources (wish they had told me that yesterday!) nor was the book I wanted on the shelf.  I headed down to the shopping centre and went to the Gap where they were holding two pairs of 12-long flare jeans for me.  The dark rinse fit like a glove; the sandblast rinse, not at all.  Frustrated, I bought the dark pair and then taking the advice of the extremely helpful and attentive young man with the headset in the change room, I went down the street a little to another Gap.  They had a pair of sandblast that did fit, so I bought those too (also from a very attentive young man with a headset).  Pleased with myself, I returned to the mall, picked up a thank you card and I returned home to remove the tags and waltz over to Mass and ... discovered that the Gap in the shopping centre left the security tag on my jeans!!  Now, the centre is a good 35-40 minutes away by subway, so I didn't want to go all the way back there.  I checked online and found a Gap much closer to me and went there instead (with receipt as proof!) and they kindly removed the security tag.    Eventually I made it over to 12:10pm Mass.  D. was the celebrant (probably the main reason I go at all every Tuesday!) and I read a fantastic bit of news in the bulletin.  It's moving season for the priests and I was extremely concerned that D. would be leaving the parish.  Well, he is ... but he's only moving to be the chaplain of the university, of which now I am officially a member!  Sweet!  He'll be a lot more accessible just generally speaking, and if he's half as sweet to the other students as he is to me, he'll be perfect for the role.  The current chaplain will become pastor of the parish, which is also a good move as far as I am concerned.  Of course, selfishly, I'm just glad D. will still be in the city at least another year and probably another two.  I forgot to mention yesterday's good news.  The SSNDs (nuns in Waterdown) gave me a $2000 bursary contribution towards my theology degree.  I'm so grateful to them; the thank you card is for them.  Time to study; I've been putting it off all week.  More to come...

      We had a planned substitute in class tonight.  He did a wonderful job of making very difficult subject matter bearable.    I had to laugh though.  He is recently emeritus, so his age isn't terribly difficult to ascertain.  Instead of proceeding into class as usual, we had to wait for a seminar before us to wrap up.  Growing more impatient as the minutes before our class dwindled, he decided he'd go in and hint to the seminar folks that their time was up.  I wasn't so keen to interrupt them, so I stood waiting in the hall and he brushed past me to get into the room. As he walked past me, he caught my eye and gave me a little wink as he walked into the classroom.  I smiled back at him (internally thinking things different to my external reaction!) and had to prevent myself from doubling over with laughter when he in his ueber-coolness, carrying his computer on one shoulder and a coffee in the opposite hand, got stuck in the heavy door and dropped everything to the floor except his coffee cup.  Walk on, cool man.  More to come...

      This afternoon I was in the kitchen preparing my future baked chicken for dinner when the fire alarm went off in the building.   Usually there is a system test around this time each month, so that's what I assumed was going on.  Unfortunately, it didn't turn off after 30 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes ...  I think my roommates and I stayed in our suite for a good 3-4 minutes before realizing it wasn't a drill.  Eventually we grabbed our keys and shoes and left the building.  Six fire trucks showed up but there was no fire to fight; it was just somebody cooking in another suite whose smoke detector went off and wouldn't stop.  When that happens long enough, the main alarm throughout the whole building goes off.  How embarrassing for that chef!   Even more embarrassing was my new roommate, who about 15 seconds into the alarm popped her head into the kitchen and asked me if we should leave the building.  I assured her that it was just a drill and she could go back to bed.  (Bed at 1:30?  Yes, grad students nap ... a lot.)  At least when I changed my mind about leaving a few minutes later, I did knock hard on her door and made sure she came with us to leave the building!  On another topic, today is the start of Pride Week in Toronto which will culminate with the giant Pride Parade on Sunday the 27th.  I'm fairly certain that this is the first or second largest GLBT parade in North America (I say second because I imagine that San Francisco has the edge on us.)  This year's theme, as I noted from  urlLink their website , is "Bursting with Fruit Flavours!" so most of the floats and costumes will reflect that.  There's some signage up around our residence that invites all interested students to come and march in the parade on Sunday.  I wouldn't mind doing that to show my support for the GLBT community as a straight woman, but unfortunately, even in this day and age, I'd be afraid of who would see me and what inferences they would draw about my participation.

      Our regular pastor was away tonight so a retired priest stepped in for Mass.  The organist chose  urlLink Marty Haugen's "Gather Us In"  for the opening hymn, which the parishioners do not know.  There were perhaps three people singing in the entire church excluding myself and the organist.  It's just an incredibly chromatic, fast, jumping kind of piece and it isn't very user-friendly.  Despite hearing a verse or two, it's not an easy thing to pick up and so people were not singing, including the priest.  After we had finished the third verse and the organist threw in a big ritardando to bring the "singing" to a halt, there was a very telling, extended pause before the visiting priest said, "Well... okay... then.  Let's start this thing.  In the name of the Father etc."  I chuckled as I blessed myself -- it was as if the music so badly interrupted his thoughts he was just speechless.   At the end, he lost his list of announcements but did remember to mention that the ushers were handing out cigars for all the fathers after Mass.  He then shook his finger sternly and admonished, "But ONLY for the fathers, okay kids?"  We all laughed.   urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink     More to come...

      I had my CNIB intake interview this morning.  The interviewer was very nice and understanding about why I wanted their help even though I'm not legally blind ("and that's a good thing!", as I keep saying.)  She offered many suggestions that I had never thought of since this situation is relatively new.  As I have a bad habit of falling off curbs at night because I can't see where the sidewalk ends, one suggestion that I balked at was using a white cane only at night to help me assess depth perception.  She thought my reaction was completely normal for someone my age and suggested a big golfing umbrella might help also and no one had to know what I was using it for.    She's going to refer me to a Visual Rehabilitation Worker who will help me go through all of the various options for reading (magnifiers, lighting, etc.) in the beginning of August or so.  She is also going to look into whether or not I am eligible for ODSP (the Ontario Disability Support Program), which could help a lot since I will have no income (only lovely student loan debts) as of September.  She also was very pleased I applied to the Canada Study Grant program and she's sure I will get that funding.   She suggested I consider getting either a laptop with large-print magnification on it for school with my funding, or a large monitor to replace my itty-bitty 15 inch monitor in residence.  Both are very appealing ideas.  Lots of helpful services should I decide I don't feel safe enough returning to driving and if I lose more of my vision and become legally blind.  Speaking of driving, I was intrigued to learn that the doctor will pull your license at 20/40.  I'm 20/35 so I'm still legal (wiping brow).  She said they would probably be reluctant to pull a young person's license anyway since most young people want to use their license for I.D. purposes whether or not they get behind the wheel.  I said I know my limits and if the lighting is too bright or it is nighttime, I would never, ever drive.    Even when I finish school there are lots of employment benefits like Workopolis which would allow me to post my resume and employers who are looking for equity requirements, she said, would LOVE me with three degrees and such an adaptive disability.  I am not eligible for many of CNIB's services since I am not legally blind, but many more I am eligible for now.  So, lots of good news!   More to come...

      A Calgarian friend sent this link to me this morning:   urlLink Election 2004 Quiz   Basically, it asks you 15 questions about your feelings on various election issues and then selects, based on your answers, with which of the four major parties your views are most in alignment.    I've known who I was going to vote for since before the election was even called.  That was painfully obvious.  What surprised me was the accuracy with which this little quiz confirmed my choice.  I dutifully selected my answers and discovered that with 100% accuracy, the leader I am voting for and I share the same views.  That's a nice bit of rare validation.    Many websites I have seen have called this coming election the most important in the history of Canada.   urlLink Real Women  explains, "This is due to the fact that the definition of marriage and family, which is the very cornerstone of society, will be determined by the next government."  I haven't been able to find the flip-side here, but I know places like planetout.com are toting a similar line, but for much different reasons.   urlLink Paul Martin himself  thinks it is the most important ever saying it is "offering Canadians a choice between U.S.-style tax cuts and a caring society."    I personally like the comments by  urlLink Matthew Fletcher , "Is the Prime Minister so engrossed with himself that he really believes this? Or is he so naive as to think that his own MP's and even other Canadians will be inspired by more of his empty rhetoric. Yes, this is a time when destiny is ours to hold. I think the Canadian electorate will make this a very historically significant election; significant in the personal career of Paul Martin Jr. anyway."    More to come...

      Just back from my third and final experiment.  The stupid experimenter didn't show!  I waited for 45 minutes in total and extremely pissed off, left and went up to report the incident to the course assistant, who of course, wasn't there yet.  So, I came home, fired off a polite but obviously perturbed email and had to sign up for another experiment - Cognitive again, crap! - on Monday.  The website says: "We consider it a grievous discourtesy to fail to keep an appointment."  SO DO I!  But will I get any credit for it?  Of course not.  I just better as hell not be penalized for it.

      Yesterday was busy.  Today promises to be busier.  I did my first psych experiment yesterday.  It was visual-perception and involved staring at a dot on the screen and deciding if the 'right' diagonal lines disappeared; of course, it was more difficult than it sounded and required a whole lot of concentration.  Unfortunately, with the lights out, staring at a black computer screen and little white lines, when the white lines disappeared sometimes my retina still processed them as being there (although slightly faded) so I made a number of mistakes.  Often I would "mess up" many times in a row before getting back into the rhythm.  Oh well.  I got my credit.  Another one this afternoon and one more at 9am tomorrow.  These are both social so hopefully will not involve too much computer/eye work.  The day was further complicated by the fact that the network connection went dead in my suite.  So, no Internet.  This was extremely frustrating for all of us and I started to get withdrawal shakes.  I did manage to go to the library and find a vacant computer four times during the day, though.  My habit is strong!   Met a friend in PSY last night.  Maureen.  She just sat right next to me and started talking.  Works for me.  I haven't met anyone else in the four weeks of class so far.  When I got home I rattled out my OSAP application so that is taken care of for the fall.  I went grocery shopping this morning and took care of some backlogged emails this morning, then did some dissertation work through ProQuest.  I downloaded a couple of dissertations and to my amusement, found my thesis online as well.  I read the acknowledgments and dedication pages and had to laugh; I haven't seen them in over two years and some of the people I thanked for their friendship from afar definitely wouldn't be on that list today.    Appointment at 2, 4, and 5 this afternoon.  Out for dinner to a buffet-style restaurant right downtown tonight with M., so that should be good.  (Makes me wonder why I bothered going for groceries this morning though...)    That's about it.  Starting to study for the Psych midterm now.  Hard to believe it's less than two weeks away.  Leaders Debate in English tonight as well.  I find those utterly boring but I will turn it on for a little bit when I get home from dinner and see who is kicking butt.  I seriously doubt it will change who I intend to cast my vote for on Friday at the advanced polls, though!  In this riding, I actually saw two Liberal signs this morning.  First time.  There are probably 100 Olivia Chow signs in this street block alone, though.    More to come...

      Well, I sat on it for a month (not literally) but my cactus has now been with me for 31 days and I think it's time to decide on a name for him.  The name of my new cactus is ... (drum roll, please!)    Ignatius Theophilus  .  Why would I give a 10cm high cactus such a lofty name?  He has a beautiful fire-coloured orange and red flower, and  Ignatius  comes from the Latin meaning "firey one".   Theophilus , which is perhaps my favourite Biblical name to pronounce, comes from Greek meaning "friend of God".  Given my new line of work, I thought the two sounded very appropriate and manly for my little guy.  He shall be called Iggy for short.

      This week is going to be mental.  I'm still in Steeltown because I have a dental appointment at 8am tomorrow, after which I will catch a bus back to the Big Smoke and begin my week of insanity.  I have an experiment to do for Psych100 every day (Mon-Wed), for which I will get 3% in the course.  Seems like it's worth 3 hours of my time, doesn't it?  What we will do for an A, I tell you.   Not to mention what wacko things this might do to my head, and God forbid, my eyes.  I have class Monday and Wednesday night, dinner out at a buffet style restaurant on Tuesday with M., lunch with L. on Wednesday, and in there I have to squeeze in three trips to two different libraries.  Thursday is Father's Day/Birthday here, Friday is CNIB at 9am and voting at noon.  Saturday is housesitting and cat-sitting again.    So, if the Blog falls a little quiet this week, my faithful readers know why.   Monday is the anniversary of the trip to St. Joe's ER with an IOP of 57.  Everything was completely white.  They said, "Can you see the top letter on that eye chart?"  I replied, "What eye chart?"   No wonder I have almost no peripheral vision now.

      Today marks 366 days since I had my lens implants done.  The next seven months were a rollercoaster of torment and fear, two more surgeries and seven months of severe or complete visual impairment.    It didn't turn out bad given all I went through, but I never want to go through it again.    More to come... (but not where my eyes are concerned, I hope!)

      I think I've gone a bit senile in my old age.  I scribbled down to leave my apartment at 10am this morning.  I meant to leave at 10am, not leave the city on a bus westbound at 10am, but sure enough, I got into that bus forgetting that I was supposed to meet my ride at 12pm, not 11am.  Somewhere around 35 minutes into the ride my mouth dropped open and I gasped, "Oh no!"  My mistake suddenly hit me.  I'd have to let my ride know not to bother to pick me up, or I'd have to wait at the bus station for an extra hour.  What a twit.  Feeling very uninspired today.  Maybe a little diss. work and leave the Psych until tomorrow.  More to come...

      I'm 27 today.  No longer "mid-20s".  I feel no different but the number immediately suggests "old" to me.  I can't say that I'm sad to see 26 come and gone.  It was a rough year.  Sure, there were ups, but there were far too many downs.  Some of those downs gave me pause to really think about life and where I'm heading, so they were not always pleasant but not always fruitless either.   I can't help but reflect on people who were with me a year ago and who are not here today.   urlLink Fr. Pat  is first and foremost in my mind.  S. Jeannette is there also.  I'm sad that I'll never again hear  urlLink Fr. Ed  "forget" my name but remember to call me "Miss Musicology" in his gravelly Indiana drawl.  I'm grateful for the friendships that I made this year and for those that were forged even more deeply.  I'm particularly thankful for the friends and family who stood by me in the rough times, and there were many of those this year.  So, knowing that I have a wonderful family and so many supportive friends behind me, I face this year with little trepidation and considerable excitement for what lies ahead, though I can see it not clearly from where I stand.  Happy Birthday wishes to others: Gloria Reuben is 40 today. Johnny Depp is 41.  Michael J. Fox is 43.  Blair Caddel is 27.  More to come...

      Well, I guess I'm sticking with Psych for now.  I got a grade of 88% on my multiple choice section, and I am guessing about an 80% or higher on the short-answer section.  The revised grades will be posted in 7-10 days.  I love the prof; I think without her this would be much more difficult than it needs to be.  I even got my own,  massive  question booklet back.  (They blew it up to 11x17 paper so I can see it better.  Looks like wallpaper.)    Went to 12:10 Mass.  D. was celebrant.  Unsure why he never replied to my email but I guess he's busy or couldn't care less.    Visited CALSS today.  Threw the guy off a bit by changing gears but I was happier with the outcome.  I feel like chicken tonight...  More to come...

      I just finished writing my Psych test and I can finally return to a sense of normalcy.  I feel like my resources have been completely depleted because I was so anxious about this test, but it went better than I could have guessed.  I only had to pause and really think about a few of the multiple choice questions, and there were maybe only two I didn't know the answers to.  I should know my grade on the m/c part by Wednesday if I am able to obtain my copy of the question booklet by then.  Shouldn't be a problem, but I'm curious to know how I did.  Obviously. :-)  Now I might be able to return to life as normal for a couple of weeks before the mass cramming starts again for the midterm on June 28! :-)  More to come... maybe more frequent blogging to come, too...

      Today has been an absolutely fantastic day. I met with my course advisor at USMC this morning.  My course schedule is as follows:  Fall Term: Intro to N.T. (nicknamed "Baby Bible" by the students - very intense!), Intro to Ministry, Intro to Theology, Ethics I, Choir, and Intro to Metaphysics.  Winter Term: Intro to Ethics, Intro to O.T., Early Church History 0-843AD, Ethics II and a continuation of Choir.  As I joked with the advisor, if I live through the first term, I should have no problem finishing up the degree!  I will take a philosophy credit in the Summer and another next Fall.  My course advisor was the sweetest man, though much younger than I would have guessed.  I feel so much more at ease about my future now that I've got my courses in place, had a tour of the Faculty and classrooms, and met a few of the professors.  I felt like I fit in there.  It felt  right .  Everyone was spectacularly friendly and offered to help in any way that they could.      At one point of my visit (I was there for 1.5 hours!), I was sitting in one of the student lounges alone (my advisor had another meeting scheduled for 10am but wanted to give me a tour of the Faculty so I waited in the lounge.)  Sitting doing absolutely nothing, I spent my time glancing around the room.  Eventually I noticed an absolutely massive painting of a sad looking young woman on the back wall.  It was in desperate need of restoration so I didn't spend too long looking at it.  The only thing that struck me was this woman.  I ruminated over her drawn, sad face and thought that it was a sort of strange picture to have in a Faculty of Theology.  Shouldn't it be the painting of the Last Supper or Mary holding the Baby Jesus or even the  urlLink Return of the Prodigal Son by Rembrandt ?  Regardless, I mused to myself, "You look how I feel, lady."  I resumed my glancing around the room again, but eventually my eye found its way back to that painting.  I noticed something that I didn't see before.  In the far left corner of the painting, a hand is reaching out to the girl with a rose.  All of a sudden, I felt my heart melt and I saw this as a sign.  Yesterday I began praying  urlLink the novena to St. Therese of Lisieux , which promises to send you a rose to signify that what you have been praying for will be granted.  The rose can be a real rose, but more likely, it will come in the form of the scent of roses, a picture of a rose, or even a vision of a rose.   I was praying the novena this time for a sign that this move to Theology is the right thing to do.  It's possible that I'm reading too much into it, but to see this woman, who I likened to myself, being handed a rose from an unseen source (presumably God) in the Faculty of Theology ... I was startled and rejoicing at the same time.   Sound crazy?  Maybe.  But I sure feel a lot more faith-filled, excited and at ease about this life choice.     So, I find myself now in somewhat of a manic state.  I'm not used to this -- I've been operating on just-above-depressive lately -- but I feel rather free and excited and unusually happy today, certainly as affected by the circumstances of the day.

      A fellow blogger and seminarian,  urlLink Ben Brown , points out that today is St. Ignatius' feast.  St. Iggy wrote:   If God causes you to suffer much, it is a sign that He has great designs for you, and that He certainly intends to make you a saint. And if you wish to become a great saint, entreat Him yourself to give you much opportunity for suffering; for there is no wood better to kindle the fire of holy love than the wood of the cross, which Christ used for His own great sacrifice of boundless charity.   -- Saint Ignatius Loyola  I certainly hope there is truth in that.

      Things turned out rather well this morning considering the alternatives.   The verdict was a vitreous detachment.  This means that the gel inside my eye pulled away from the retina (it usually happens in 50- to 70-year olds ... gee, I have "old" eyeballs) and I will have a permanent blind spot along the periphery of my vision.  At least I wasn't using it that much :-)  There is no treatment.  I must also remain on "high alert" (now I sound like an American ;-)) for 6 weeks because there is an increased chance of retinal detachment during this period.  I'm just glad it wasn't anything more serious, and I will be checked out in 2 weeks to make sure my retina isn't weakening anywhere.  The doctor said I'd be fine to resume all normal activities and although she couldn't explain the sharp intraocular pain, she said Tylenol and ice would help.   I've continued to lay off the reading today instead opting to run around campus like a fool delivering various letters to various departments and do some much needed desk management.  The reading will start tomorrow.    More to come...

      I picked up my test booklet today.&nbsp; Got 98%.&nbsp; The only question I missed was about babies and when they respond to biologically significant stimuli.&nbsp; As I had just read that babies can only see approximately 20/400&nbsp;when they are first born, and I happen to be the proud owner of one 20/400 eyeball, I thought that there is no way an infant could respond visually to anything at that point in their lives.&nbsp; Apparently I was wrong.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; It would be nice if I could stop kicking myself over "the one that got away"...

      I finished reading Stephen Kuusisto's "Planet of the Blind" this afternoon.  Most valuable for those coping with vision loss in one form or another, I think, but it contains many lessons for the fully sighted as well.  I was most taken aback by the reactions of the sighted towards the blind and the injustice that still exists.  His reluctance to use a cane, no doubt imbedded in him by the hatred of his mother towards the blind world, and his ability to overcome that and acquire Corky were inspiring.  I loved the line about wondering whether inflicting opera on a guide dog was a form of cruelty to animals.  Wagner, perhaps!   My favourite part was Kuusisto's vision of the planet of the blind on page 148:   On the planet of the blind,  no one needs to be cured .   Blindness is another form of music , like the solo clarinet in the mind of Bartók.     On the planet of the blind, the citizens live in the susurrus of cricket wings tinkling in inner space.   You can hear the stars on the windless nights of June.  On the planet of the blind, people talk about what they do not see, like Wallace Stevens, who freely chased tigers in red weather.  Here, mistaken identities are not the stuff of farce.  Instead, unvexed, the mistaken discover new and friendly adjacent arms to touch.  On this particular planet, the greyhounds get to snooze at last in the tall grass.  The sighted are beloved visitors, their fears of blindness assuaged with fragrant reeds.  On the planet of the blind, everyone is free to touch faces, paintings, gardens – even the priests who have come here to retire.  There is no hunger in the belly or in the eyes.  And the furniture is always soft.  Chairs and tables are never in the way.  On the planet of the blind, the winds of will are fresh as a Norwegian summer.   And the sky is always between moonshine and morning star .   God is edible.   On the planet of the blind self-contempt is a museum .   (Bolding is by the author of the blog.)

      So, a 50+ year-old retired man is attempting to befriend me.  We met at a volunteer opportunity and started to email first sporadically and now daily.  His first request, which I complied with somewhat hesitantly, was that he wanted to spend a day reading to me.  Now has invited me for a short vacation (all expenses paid) after my course is over.  I wasn't sure if the feelings of discomfort I experienced were due to me being hypersensitive to intentions and the desire to avoid being hurt in some unforeseen way, or if this was indeed slightly odd.  Ever-so-helpful PP chimed in.   "You do not have what might be called accessible relationship skills and thus are often uncomfortable in many relationships.  That is always a major feature for you.  It is a part of the cachet you have developed over the years.  But I also think that this man's overtures to you are unusual, and I can see why you would be somewhat uncomfortable... See what transpires."   Though I realize I have revealed very little of the whole situation here, I am still interested on any comments about whether or not this is simply odd or merely due to my hypersensitivity.

      Class was intriguing last night.  We talked about emotions and the evolutionary theory of sexual behaviour (that is, basically, men are pigs because they are hardwired that way.)  Fascinating stuff.  We talk about play therapy next.  After talking to a colleague over lunch last week, we realized that academia is an inherently cruel world.  We are encouraged to submit our fledgling academic efforts for publication at the highest calibre journals, and then are effectively crushed when we are insulted line after line in the reviews.  "This is a fascinating topic and the world desperately needs a study in this field.  Unfortunately, this paper isn't it."  The knife turns.  These people seem to forget that they were the ones submitting the paper but a few years ago.  How did they become so cruel?  Likewise, it is ironic how this cruel world can produce such a juxtaposition of touching personal remembrances and tributes at the  urlLink website for the late John Daverio  of  urlLink Boston University .  As much as an aspiring scholar can have an academic hero, Daverio was mine.  I hope that he has found peace.   More to come...

      I went to see my retina surgeon this afternoon.  All was well (though my eyes are still unthawing!).  IOPs were good (15 and 14), the retinas are both attached and looking okay, and there was no other obvious defects to be concerned with.  He'll follow up with me again in six months and mildly chastized me for failing to call when I saw that massive amoeba-like floater that covered up to 50% of my eye a couple of weeks ago.  Seems that's significant, so at least I know that for the future.  I've been quiet lately because I have a ton of studying to do for my next term test (July 21); once I have that under control I'll say a little more.  More to come ...

      As sort of a follow-up to my revelation that dawned on me yesterday, about being stuck between two worlds, someone just recommended the following book to me.   Stephen Kuusisto,  The Planet of the Blind     urlLink    &nbsp; urlLink     From the publisher:   "The world is a surreal pageant," writes Stephen Kuusisto. "Ahead of me the shapes and colors suggest the sails of Tristan's ship or an elephant's ear floating in air, though in reality it is a middle-aged man in a London Fog rain coat which billows behind him in the April wind."   So begins Kuusisto's memoir, Planet of the Blind, a journey through the kaleidoscope geography of the partially-sighted, where everyday encounters become revelations, struggles, or simple triumphs. Not fully blind, not fully sighted, the author lives in what he describes as "the customs-house of the blind", a midway point between vision and blindness that makes possible his unique perception of the world. In this singular memoir, Kuusisto charts the years of a childhood spent behind bottle-lens glasses trying to pass as a normal boy, the depression that brought him from obesity to anorexia, the struggle through high school, college, first love, and sex. Ridiculed by his classmates, his parents in denial, here is the story of a man caught in a perilous world with no one to trust--until a devastating accident forces him to accept his own disability and place his confidence in the one relationship that can reconnect him to the world--the relationship with his guide dog, a golden Labrador retriever named Corky. With Corky at his side, Kuusisto is again awakened to his abilities, his voice as a writer and his own particular place in the world around him.   Written with all the emotional precision of poetry, Kuusisto's evocative memoir explores the painful irony of a visually sensitive individual--in love with reading, painting, and the everyday images of the natural world--faced with his gradual descent into blindness. Folded into his own experience is the rich folklore the phenomenon of blindness has inspired throughout history and legend.    Of course I can't recommend it having yet to read it, but I will pick it up on Sunday (HV1792.K88A3).    More to come...

      I had an insight on the bus trip home yesterday.  I'm stuck between two worlds and I don't fit into either.  I'm neither a true and whole member of the sighted community nor am I "bad" enough to be a fully-fledged member of the blind community.  I don't know where to park myself, so to speak.  I think that is a key part of this recent identity crisis.   My grades from the second term test were posted today.  89% total.  Better than I thought given my predilection of massacring one of the questions.  If I do about the same on the third test July 21, I will only need 50% on the final exam in order to pass the course.  That sort of average serves to calm me down.   Good visit with a different neurologist yesterday.  He has me on $500 worth of drugs (that's the cost for just a month! thank goodness for insurance) to see if that will help.  More to come...

      Busy day but quite enjoyable given the calibre of my recent days.  I was up at about 6:45 (naturally; that’s the best kind of early morning) and began my reading nice and early.  I finished in time for SO and watched half of that before heading over to church.  I was somewhat surprised D. was celebrant given he’s only a half-timer now; thought he’d hang out at the chaplaincy more.  Saw T. in his new role and he gave me a cute little wave before he went over to his box for the first time.  Had to be the first time; he got stuck in the door, got twisted up in the curtain and otherwise looked pretty damned funny!  The episode only lasted but a split second before he laughed, unfurled himself and motioned for the first penitent to come inside.   I’m terrified to go to him in that role; I think I shall hold out for one of the other three.  Woke up to obscene emails from pp from last night.  Glad I didn’t see those before I went to sleep or I would have had horrible nightmares.  Later, CALSS; talked mainly about my eyes and “who am I?”  Basically, how I’m defining myself now and giving the disability too much weight.  As part of my homework, I went back through all of my blog entries and found the number of times I have mentioned my disability since November.  80% of the July entries include it (probably 90% with today’s!), and low months of February and May.  Other months are about 20-30%.  Stopped at Harbord Bakery for some bread for a spontaneous lunch tomorrow; I’m going to be the recipient of some homemade strawberry jam so I thought I’d bring something to show my appreciation.  Had a sub for dinner; didn’t feel like cooking.  Don’t feel like doing much, actually.  Just got an email from Germany that my Robert Schumann biography page translated into German by Google is horrible.  Well, gee, since I didn’t translate it, I can’t take responsibility for their automatic computer programmed translator.  Just be grateful that there is a translation facility available at all, smart ass.  Back to work now; I want to be finished for The Amazing Race 5 at 9:30pm!  Woo hoo!  More to come…

      Today has been a whirlwind.  I got about 4 hours of sleep last night but got up on time (despite my unusual grogginess) and was out the door by 8:45.  I hit Dominion for some cereal and salad (I promise not to eat them at the same time), and then bolted down to the Faculty where I exchanged one book for five.  Seems like a fair trade to me.  Next I waited for 20 minutes at the ASSU only to be told that my particular course doesn't release their previous exams so I'm out of luck.  That really sucks; I rely quite heavily on those things for studying.  It's muggy here today with only a slight breeze to make it any better.  Drops of rain fall down sporadically, making the use of an umbrella not quite essential but not quite unnecessary.  Now home and cooled down, it's time to start reading for my psych course before I have to go to get a signature on my disability documentation.  It never stops.  More to come...

      Happy Independence Day to all the US readers out there (the legions of them :-))  This week should be fairly quiet.  I did a lot of work on my dissertation today after my return to Hogtown and so some visits to three libraries are warranted in the days to come.  Also a trip to Dominion, to the ASSU who apparently have final exams from previous years that might be extremely useful, and also I have a very short meeting with my disability advisor to sign a form for OSAP that declares I am permanently disabled.   Two more chapters to read for my next Psych test before I start to study as well.  This is the kind of week I look forward to, one with no major events and that should be fairly gentle.

      Today marks the anniversary of my trabeculectomy.  It marked the end of my daily trips to TO at 6:45am and the constant pain and nausea that accompanied high intraocular pressure.  Unfortunately, it also marked the return of the severe pain that accompanied the tearing of my retina and the month of uncertainty as I was unable to see with such a low IOP (c. zero to seven).    Been busy reading Psych today.  So far so good; I have covered romantic and companionate love, parenting, aggression and altruism.  I'm heading into emotions but might have to leave that until tomorrow.  More to come...

      In a few short weeks my father will be going to Poland for work.  He will be touring a steel plant in Krakow, birthplace of Pope John Paul II and he will also have a three-hour tour of Auschwitz.  For some reason I have been protected from and shielded myself from hearing much about the concentration camps and from viewing most of these images, but the following is my exploration of some of the photographic information available on the web about these horrors.   The official website of the Auschwitz "museum" is available  urlLink online .  Until today, I was completely unaware of the existence of " urlLink Kanada " at Birkenau.  Stuart Nichols has a website called "On Every Day Since... A Christian at Auschwitz", so named because of the self-composed quotation that appears on his website, "On every day since I first saw Auschwitz, I have wept."  On his site, he documents with commentary and photographs his tours of Auschwitz and Birkenau.   urlLink Part Four  details his findings at Auschwitz; he also includes a  urlLink layout of Auschwitz .  Those interested only in his photos from the various places can find them  urlLink here  (which oddly enough were less painful for me to read than his descriptive and knowledgable commentary).   urlLink Alan Jacobs  has a similar photo site in colour.  This page is an  urlLink Auschwitz Alphabet  and details some of the medical experimentation and key words at Auschwitz/Birkenau.  Though I am sure there are other comprehensive sites, after I read some of the details at  urlLink The Nizkor Project , citing that between 1.1 million and 1.5 million died at Auschwitz (a fact confirmed by the  urlLink Auschwitz/Birkenau Museum website ), I was completely numb and had to turn off my search engine.    How anyone could do this to another living person is simply beyond me.  More to come...   urlLink    Gate that leads into Auschwitz&nbsp; urlLink

      I'm en route to Steeltown to celebrate our national holiday.  In the meantime, let me leave my loyal readers with the following joke that crossed my desk this morning. Enjoy.  As always,  More to come...  Bubba was from Alabama and was a hard-shell Southern Baptist. He loved to sneak away to the race track.   One day he was there betting on the ponies and losing his shirt when he noticed a priest step out onto the track and bless the forehead of one of the horses lining up for the 4th race.   Lo and behold, this horse -- a very long shot -- won the race. Bubba was most interested to see what the priest did in the next race. Sure enough, he watched the priest step out onto the track as the horses for the fifth race lined up, and placed a blessing on the forehead of one of the horses.   Bubba made a beeline for the window and placed a small bet on the horse. Again, even though another long shot, the horse the priest had blessed won the race.   Bubba collected his winning and anxiously waited to see which horse the priest bestowed his blessing on for the 6th race. The priest showed, blessed a horse, Bubba bet on it, and it won!  Bubba was elated!   As the day went on, the priest continued blessing one of the horses, and it always came in first.   Bubba began to pull in some serious money, and by the last race, he knew his wildest dreams were going to come true.  He made a quick stop at the ATM, withdrew big money and awaited the priest's blessing that would tell him which horse to bet on.   True to his pattern, the priest stepped out onto the track before the last race and blessed the forehead, eyes, ears and hooves of one of the horses. Bubba bet every cent, and watched the horse come in dead last.   He was dumbfounded.   He made his way to the track and when he found the priest. He demanded, "What happened, Father? All day you blessed horses and they won. The last race, you blessed a horse and he lost. Now I've lost my savings, thanks to you!"   The priest nodded wisely and said, "That's the problem with you Protestants, you can't tell the difference between a simple blessing and the Last Rites."

      So, it's a lovely day here and I'm off on the potential date from hell (all day long, which I didn't consent to except by my silence, I suppose) with a man 31 years my senior.  I know I am focusing too much only on his age.  He's a nice guy.  He's loaded.  He likes the fine life of good wine and good opera.  But the age would be a barrier regardless.  How do I get myself into these situations?  AC1 touched down in Tokyo overnight.  I hope that M. had a good trip and if she is reading this, welcome! :-)   How is Kinta?   Box said he likes the new view but he misses you.  OK, I guess I have to go.  I'm like Maggie Simpson today, hanging onto the doorframe and internally screaming "NOOOOOOO!"

      Today is the last anniversary I have to think of -- the first anniversary of my vitrectomy. It was all downhill from here.   Thanks, Dr. B.!  It certainly was not the end of the road by any means.  Actually, today marks the end when I think of it.  It is a year to the day of the surgery and I was told that after a year, my retina would be as fully healed as it ever will be.  I can safely do air travel again.   The wrinkles are ironed out for the most part.  That doesn't mean that the road ahead won't have bumps but hopefully, they will be just tiny potholes like this vitreous detachment.  My two closest friends (unfortunately, I don't mean that from a geographical point of view!) are moving and beginning the first day of the rest of their lives today. I wish both E. and M. the very best and I hope that they find every happiness in their new lives.  More to come...

      One year ago today, I arrived at my former ophthalmologist’s office at 7:30am expecting to undergo laser surgery to clean up the debris in my eye left over from the portion of the calcified cataract that he removed from my iris on June 12. I had been there the day before and told that my pressure was too low to safely operate, and I returned home. For at least two days I had been complaining of an increasingly large black spot at the bottom of my eye; he said it was just a floater. After two trips into his office with no decision made yet about my readiness for surgery, I returned to the waiting room to wait a little longer with the hopes that my pupils would dilate so a closer inspection could be done. They did not, but the former ophthalmologist finally brought me into his office for a third time and saw what the problem was. My mom told me that a look of nausea crossed his face as he muttered that my retina had detached. While we returned to the waiting room for a fourth time, I knew what was happening wasn’t good but I wasn’t sure of the extent of the problem yet. I heard him tell the secretaries to call a particular surgeon “now” and to say he was sending an emergency patient. I asked the office staff if this new guy was any good. They assured me he was the best in the city. After getting an emergency appointment, we were on our way from Humber to SMH via cab.  One year ago today, we took a very quick cab ride from Downsview to downtown. We stopped for lunch at my favourite eatery, Mr. Greenjeans. I couldn’t see the menu. I was nervous but not completely comprehending the severity of the situation. I was convinced that I would be on my way home that evening after undergoing a laser surgery to correct the detachment. I was very naïve.  One year ago today, to the hour, I was admitted for an emergency vitrectomy to SMH. I was terrified when I was told that my odds of seeing again were only 70% -- I couldn't stop focusing on that 30% chance of total blindness. The office staff was great. One in particular, Mary, was very kind and gentle with me in my fragility after my consultation. The doctor, though he had already seen me and answered my questions, left a meeting to talk to me again when I said I had another question about the likelihood of him removing my new lens. I recall sitting in the waiting room, awaiting information about my hospital admission, and turning to stare at my mom. She asked me what was wrong. I vaguely remember explaining that I was trying to memorize what I could see of her face in case I didn’t have that chance again.  One year ago today, my mom guided me across the street to SMH and we visited the Ophthalmology clinic. A resident who was going to assist in the surgery saw me and ran a few tests. As several hours had passed since lunch, I insisted on getting something to eat before formally checking myself into the hospital. We ate at the 6th floor cafeteria. I can’t remember much except feeling very numb and frightened, and talking about what I would do with my life if I couldn’t see again; academia seemed out of the question. After dinner, I went to be checked into the hospital formally and checked into my semi-private room. The following afternoon during my surgery, I would be moved to a ward and my clothes would be stolen from my room. My parents didn’t notice anything was missing until it was time for me to go home the day following the surgery.  One year ago today, I had nothing prepared for a hospital stay; the surgery I had been expecting was an outpatient one. I had no pyjamas or slippers or a toothbrush. My father, who was badly injured at the time, called his sister to drive him to Humber. They passed through a heavy thunderstorm on the way and almost had to pull off the road because of a lack of visibility. They made it safely and he picked up the SUV and drove it despite his broken jaw and battered face to SMH, bringing with him a few things for my mom to stay at a nearby hotel. They finally opted to return home overnight so I kept the overnight necessities – pajamas and slippers, and the hospital gave me a disposable toothbrush.  One year ago today, after visiting hours, I called Fr. Pat and told him what had happened. He told me that Fr. Ed had drowned in a swimming accident after suffering an epileptic seizure the day before. His funeral was to be Friday.  One year ago today, I spent a very long night alone.  One year ago today, I cried inconsolably. In the hospital, the chaplain, Toni, came to visit me the following day and tried to calm me down. I imagine I was disturbing my roommate. I kept apologizing but I couldn’t stop crying. She called the priest who was saying daily Mass for them and he gave me the Sacrament of the Sick the shortly before my surgery. I finally felt some peace after that. I finally stopped crying.  One year ago today, I met the doctor who gave me back my sight, something that I had been more or less missing for just under two months up to that point. I am so grateful to him for putting me back on the road to vision.  More to come...   (Amusingly, the spell checker just asked me if I wanted to replace “vitrectomy” with “vasectomy”. Hmm… No. That would have changed the story dramatically, though…)

      This cracked me up...  From the Associated Press, Thu 5 August 2004   Bush insists his administration seeking 'new ways to harm our country'   WASHINGTON (AP) - President George W. Bush offered up a new entry for his catalogue of "Bushisms" on Thursday, declaring that his administration will "never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people."   Bush misspoke as he delivered a speech at the signing ceremony for a $417-billion defence spending bill.  "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we," Bush said, "They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we."

      Today was a day of unexpected surprises.  I met with M. for lunch on a rooftop patio nearby.  During the lunch, I more or less invited myself to join her on a shopping trip for business attire for her new job in Tokyo.  We had a great time; I was her "personal shopper" and as she tried on the clothes, I ran around the store picking out other items that I thought would be appropriate for her.   Many of them were.  When asked by the checkout girl which sales associate had helped her, M. responded, "My friend, L.!"  I asked for the commission on the spot. :-)  We ended up wrapping up the trip a mere 3 hours later.  I returned back to rez to find a letter from SMC.  They're giving me $3100 towards my tuition.  I'm a little surprised, to be honest.  I had been told it would cover my whole tuition but obviously we're just over 60% of the way there.  On further reflection, with this and the SSND bursary I have all but $98 covered.  OSAP will therefore deduct $5100 from my loan.  Tonight, I did some calculations; those generous folks gave me $200 for my food for eight months.   I am now reconsidering whether to apply to the other bursaries or not, though; I will only be eligible for the BSWD if I have OSAP.  The BSWD will cover 100% of my disability related equipment expenses.  If I don't have OSAP, I will need to apply to the ADP and they will cover only 75% of the expenses.  I sure as heck can't afford to pay 25% of those costs, so I might as well stop worrying about the other bursaries.  I'll do some more math with a fresh head tomorrow.  One more surprise: the CNIB called and want to set a date for my low vision assessment.  This is great; if it happens in August I will be much more enabled to tackle school in September.  Well, things move slowly; I might not have my equipment yet but at least the ball will be rolling.  More to come...

      I'm finally starting to feel relatively normal again where my ocular orifice is concerned. The black spot is still there, of course, the flashing is still there in certain lighting conditions, but I read a lot today and don't have any intraocular pain. I hope it stays that way. I'm cautiously optimistic.  It's been a productive day. I was awake at 5:55am to sign up for my courses on the university's system. It wasn't slow at all, which surprised me to no end; when I signed up for my summer course I was competing with hundreds of others and I expected that to be the case today also. To my surprise, though, it wasn't slow even though all of the first year undergrads were eligible to begin course selection at 6:00am along with me.  Ah, they will learn that the early bird gets the worm (or, in this case, the course) soon enough.  I was the first person in the Faculty to sign up and got all of my desired sections so I'm chuffed about that. The only surprise was that they changed the time of the choir from 4-5pm to 12-1pm Tuesdays. That totally screws up my participation in Out of the Cold in both semesters. I'll have to make sure that's not an error before I drop out of that commitment.  By 6:10am I registered and had a choice -- plough on with the day or go back to bed. I opted for the former. I answered various lengthy emails that had come in during the night, I took care of some banking, I went to the grocery store and picked up this week's necessities, I showered, cleaned the kitchen and living room, prepared some baked chicken for dinner, sorted the recycling bin and by 9:00am, I was working on my Psychology review for the final exam. At 11:30, I headed over to Mass hoping Fr. D. would be the celebrant. No such luck two weeks in a row. He's either on holidays or shifted his Mass schedule. I returned by 1:00pm, went to CALSS, learned that I have a seriously damaged modus operandi in most of relationships in my life and bought a couple of new notepads for all of this revision I'm doing over the next 14 days.  Upon returning home I popped my chicken in the oven and did a little more Psych review. I also created an elaborate schedule detailing what I need to do each day to keep on schedule for studying. It's not easy relearning 751 pages of material.  Speaking of Psych, the third term test marks were posted on Sunday. The class mean was up four percent to 71%.   I scored 96% with my multiple choice grade (98%) and my short answer grade (90%) combined. The shocker was the highest mark on the test ... 96%. Yes, I actually got the highest mark in the class on this test! I was shocked, stunned and in total disbelief. I must have checked it three times over the next two days to make sure I wasn't dreaming. Apparently I know my social psychology very well :-) ... I keep reciting facts and figures in normal conversation (much to the annoyance of others, I'm sure) so it's clear that I understand this stuff.  This week is fairly quiet. I will probably go to Mass again tomorrow provided it isn't pissing rain; I also have to complete the revision of two more chapters of notes (as a minimum; I'd like to get ahead so I might be able to take a day off somewhere down the line in this schedule.) M. and I are having our last lunch together on Thursday. I have extremely mixed emotions; while I'm obviously looking forward to seeing her, I'm also dreading saying goodbye.  Although she assures me it is not 'goodbye' but 'see you later', I don't like saying either one of them.  To be frank, I'm not convinced that she'll return to Canada in a year as she says. After all, Canada comes with separation from family, friends, loss of a job and renewed culture shock.  So, we'll see how that goes but I am not looking forward to it for the most part.   I am free on Friday and Saturday except for a load of laundry, and then Sunday is Cottage-D. day. I'm looking forward to seeing him but mostly I feel only trepidation about the reunion. I don't like expensive restaurants for one. I always feel out of my league. I'm also unsure, maybe unconvinced, that C-D's intentions are merely friendly. In Hamlet (III, ii, 239) Queen Gertrude says to Hamlet, "The lady doth protest too much, methinks." In this case, methinks  he  doth protest too much. He keeps extolling friendly love and he has said more than once that he has turned down the romantic love offered to him by two older women whom he considered platonic friends. He has also said at least twice that relationships with a significant age gap are very difficult to navigate because of the different goals of each of the parties. Perhaps he is trying to convince himself.  Onwards.  More to come...

        Priest and nun caught having sex  A Catholic priest and nun have been caught having sex in a car at an airport car park in Malawi (alongside Mozambique in Southern Africa).  The 43-year-old priest and 26-year-old nun were caught "in the act" in a tinted saloon car parked at Lilongwe International Airport.     The pair were brought before magistrates where they received a suspended six-month jail sentence with hard labour.   "It was a bizarre spectacle, the public alerted airport police after noticing the car shaking in a funny way," police spokesman Kelvin Maigwa told the  urlLink BBC .  In a packed and giggling court-room, both the priest and the nun pleaded guilty to the charge of indecent behaviour in a public place and disorderly conduct.  The nun told the magistrate she regretted her brief lapse in judgement, while the priest said that as a man of God he accepted Satan had tempted him.  Magistrate Arthur Mtalimanja accepted their pleas in mitigation, but admonished them saying that as servants of God they were the last to be expected to  misbehave in public.   "I therefore sentence you to six months imprisonment with hard labour, but I will suspend it... because you have shown remorse," he said. If the couple repeat the offence in the next 18 months they will go to jail, the magistrate said.   (30 July 2004)   My favourite was the line by  urlLink Jay Leno  who said that this was the best news the Catholic Church had received in years.  "Right on, Father!" said the Vatican.  :-)   More to come...

      I took it easy on my eyeballs yesterday and avoided the computer.  Just one hour of computer work on Saturday caused some severe pain so I'm going to try very hard not to overdo it.  Went to a closing out sale for perennials at a temporary garden centre with my mom and got 12 plants for $12.   Toronto's mental today.  Yonge Street is closed north of Wellesley for some type of street event and Toronto Island is hosting Caribana.  The trip back wasn't too bad except for a jackknifed truck on the QEW near the 403 turn off.  That, of course, backed up traffic in both directions because of rubber-neckers.  Idiots.  It would be great if this country could make up its mind about what to call today.  Almost all of the country has a holiday today (except Quebec, Yukon and Newfoundland and Labrador.)  In BC, it is called "BC Day".  In most of Ontario, today is the "Civic Holiday".  In Toronto, it is "Simcoe Day".  God help us.  I haven't done much today.   Haven't started to study for my final yet but if that doesn't happen today, it will certainly happen tomorrow.  I did get my course codes ready for entry into the computer tomorrow morning at 6am when my registration times open up.   My friend Joey died 11 years ago today.  That's very hard to believe.  PP is still behaving himself; having some back trouble so when he's in pain, he is usually pretty morally centred.  I was thinking of going over to Rosary group tonight but I'm not sure that it is happening nor am I sure I feel up to it.  I might as well just wait until September to rejoin them.  More to come...

      Today is the one year anniversary of my retina ripping.  As I'm still having some at times severe intraocular pain that is unexplained, I'm going to avoid reading and computer work all day to try to get my eye feeling better.  More to come...
