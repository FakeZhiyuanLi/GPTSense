      GONNA TAKE MY LICENSE TEST TODAY!!! oh boy oh boy  so I made it possible for anyone to post comments in here IF THEY SO DESIRE, not just members (matt this is for you cuz you tried and couldn't) so.....make me happy and do it. Alrighty, I'm gonna go now and announce the test results when I return. Byes!  Yes, so the ppl in Anoka are mean and evil. Especially the streets. And from those two comments you may think that streets are people too....well they're not, its just that the people that made the streets in Anoka are dumb. So I decided to not pass the test today just to teach them a lesson and so that other drivers out there can have a few more days to prepare for the honor and extreme goodness(yes goodness) of having me be a fellow driver. And the person who cut me off coming home and tried to kill me.....he should be punished and made to go cry in a corner. It was scurry. SCURRY.   Sinziana

      Sup sup!?! Today is Moseley's birthday, HAPPY HAPPY BIRTHDAY to him. Wow, 18...he can vote.  One more day till I get my license, EXCITING!!! Yes and only two more days (hehehe) of practice in the morning this week, cuz thursday we're going to Noah's Ark, which shall be fun indeedy. So had a near death experience today. I was sitting and eating Dorito's when all of a sudden i went to swallow one and things started going in wrong directions. Of course I just froze and got all teary eyed and stopped breathing, while thinking 'OH SHIT' and then coughed and everything was ok. Scurry.   "As soon as you step through my door i saw you for the first time all over again..."  That's all for now.....people....you are more than welcome to leave comments.

      Yay for blogs!!! Finally have an FTP that works so I can post my website, however I've been told by two people now that they cannot see my site yet...GRRRR. Anton, my brother's friend, has AC/DC blasting right next to me and um...I'm not sure if I like it or not. I need a job, really really need one. Two more days and then hopefully I'll have my license and then HOPEFULLY get a car soon, so I can go out and get a silly job. Its sunny outside, so I'ma go tanning soon. But first I must post the song lyrics for today.  Godsmack "Running Blind"  Can’t find the answers I’ve been crawling on my knees Looking for anything To keep me from drowning Promises have been turned to lies Can’t even be honest inside Now I’m running backward Watching my life wave me goodbye  Running blind I’m running blind Somebody help me see I’m running blind  Searching for nothing Wondering if I’ll change I’m trying everything But everything still stays the same I thought if I showed you I could fly Wouldn’t need anyone by my side Now I’m running backward With broken wings I know I’ll die  Running blind I’m running blind Somebody help me see I’m running blind Running blind Running blind Running blind  I can’t find the answers I’ve been crawling on my knees Looking for anything To keep me from drowning I’m running blind Running blind  K, that is all. Have a lovely day and do something worthwhile.

      Its so nice out right now. I should prolly be outside, tanning or something, but nah. I'd rather be burning cd's to my ipod. Yanni is playing right now, and I like it. Yes, I like Yanni, its good stuff. Morning practice was interesting today. It was warm and easy and that was good, but people were all ganging up on me. Vince decided to dive OUT of the pool and onto the deck after a fin and in the process jacked me in the nose with his foot. So I sorta play punched his leg from really close to his leg, altho he deserved much more, and then went and swam two laps. When I came back the coach was like "Ok people, do a 200 easy WITHOUT punching anyone." Of course my jaw dropped and I was like "Oh no no no Drew. That was not a punch. That was a little tap on his leg cuz he hit me in the nose." And Drew laughed at me and told me that the person to start the fight is never seen, lol, psshhh. And then the people in my lane started saying that I punched Vince in the face. I WOULD NEVER PUNCH POOR DEFENSELESS VINCE IN THE FACE. And they were splashing me and being evil. But I had fun, good ol' swimming. Only one more day left really, unless I decide to go on thursday, which I might cuz practices are getting really easy and its going to be warm outside. I got a sweet pink skirt at Charlotte Russe yesterday and its very pretty. I was gonna go into Express, but the stupid people decided that NOW was a good time to renovate. UGH. OMG, I just remembered. At the pool this morning, there was a momma ducky with 4 baby chicks, and they were wandering around the deck, and even got in the gutter. One of the chicks, lol, got into the actual lane and was swimming around and trying to get back out and doing silly things. We were laughing and the coach told me the ducks were mad because  we  were in  their  lane. And then some other guy swimmer was talking and said that they better not poop in the pool. All good fun. *sigh* enuff for today.

      Had a fun weekend! Lemme see, Saturday I slept in till 11 and then chilled, afterwhich I spent the day at Mall of America with my family. Got a pair of shorts from AE. Then we went to Mervin's and I got a sweet skirt. Then today I hung out with Matthew, who's leaving me for a week *tear*, and then went to a family friend's house for swimming, eating, and socializing. I'm tired tho after all this excitment. Yay I get to sleep in tomorrow. Must check out the U of M website to see if they have applications, and I need senior pics....yarg. Can't wait till we go to Romania! It's gonna be the shit. For sure. I've decided, I want a puppy. Yesh, right now. So apparently, Eric wants Cassie to have sex with him.... :::darkhedgehog4777: tell cassie to have sex with me! :::DeprivedSociety: done :::darkhedgehog4777: good :::darkhedgehog4777: hmm :::darkhedgehog4777: that might've sounded wrong :::DeprivedSociety: lol :::darkhedgehog4777: for clarification... its just meant to be a way to get her unbored and unhorny :::DeprivedSociety: oh...i see, then that makes it so much better  Those kids are dirty...DIRTY. Watching hyper cute little puppy dawgs run in circles at high speeds is highly entertaining, gives me the giggles. kk, nighty!

      Oh my goodness, today was so much fun. Matthew, Iustin, and I went with our swim team to Noah's Ark, "America's Biggest Waterpark", in Wisconsin Dells. We went on rides, ate good food, beat each other up, and had a good time in general. We also watched about four movies on the rides to and from there, because it was about a 6 hour round trip. Harry Dixon managed stopping the wave pool when he made a lifeguard think he was drowning, matt smashed a pop can against his forhead FINALLY, lol, two of my lovely friends flirted the whole time (dunno who *shifty eyes*), matt also managed stepping in freshly chewed gum, and lotsa other good times occured. Tomorrow I'm most likely gonna go to Eagan and see if I can sneak in an appointment to get my license.   Dippin' Dots are the shizzit, if I was a celebrity, I would demand a constant supply of 'em.   Sorry Ben about not telling you I had a blog, I've only had it for like 4 days and I thought that whoever decided to look at my site would see my blog. Plus I haven't really talked with you lately....so don't yell at me!!! Thanks a bunch for posting a comment tho. Meant a lot.   Luv y'all tons! ~Sinziana

      Wow, I haven't written in a really long time, since like, before we went to Romania. The trip was fun, really nice to see family again, and all the places we went to and things we saw were awesome. But I'm glad to be home. Nothing like air conditioning, indoor plumbing, and non-lethal water. And now that I'm back I get to be overwhelmed by everything that has to be done since I am now a senior. Like for example, the essays and college applications I have to fill out. Not looking forward to that really. And I have to study my butt off for the SAT II's so that I can get disgustingly good scores on the tests. I'm sorta excited tho, 'cept its not good that I already feel overwhelmed and school hasn't even started yet. In other news, I'm doing very well in online pool and am very happy about that. And the book "Cryptonomicon" is insanely long and very well written. That is all. Oh, and note to self: somehow get the Switchfoot and Killswitch Engage cds!!!
