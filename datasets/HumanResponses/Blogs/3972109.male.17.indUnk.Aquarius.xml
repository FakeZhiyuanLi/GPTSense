       Let's get a few things out of the way.  urlLink www.stormfront.org  has an awesome forum, check it out sometime. I'm a racist, but don't take that the wrong way, I don't hate individuals for their race, I hate races for their individuals. I've got plenty of non-white friends, and they know that I'm proud to be white, and they're fine with that. Many of them even acknowledge the fact that their races do have severe problems. However, I've never met a Jew that I could get along with or trust in any way whatsoever. I've thought about becoming a skinhead before, and it's something I still consider, but I think I would prefer a more low-profile activism. I often hang out on IRC, sometimes on stormfront's channel, but I'm almost always to be found on irc.aniverse.com's channel #catgirls, many people do not realize this, as I tend to have to leave the channel for extended periods of time, due to trouble with school, my parents, or the computer, but I presented the idea for the channel to Cyber_Akuma, so he and I were the very first people in the channel, and I have always been an op. The #catgirls' website can be found at  urlLink http://catgirls.angel-feathers.com .   My favorite bands currently are: Metallica, Einherjer, Ensiferum, and some Megadeth. I also listen to Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, and stuff like that. Right now I'm listening to Eternal Wait by Ensiferum.  urlLink http://www.metalstorm.ee/index.php  is a great place to find info about metal bands. My favorite movies as of now are A Clockwork Orange, Fight Club, Master and Commander, Count of Monte Cristo, and stuff like that.   urlLink http://www.digitalronin.f2s.com/politicalcompass/index.html  is pretty interesting, but it's kind of annoying how the test is a little biased into making people think they are more left than they are, even though I turned out pretty far right and into authoritarian (as I assumed I would) a lot of people have complained about it making people out to be more left than they think they should be. My results were:  Economic Left/Right: 3.62   Social Libertarian/Authoritarian: 2.51  I consider myself National Socialist, and although their assessment of where Hitler stood politically might be correct, don't confuse that with National Socialism. Hitler was more left economically than most NS would consider themselves. In a perfect world, I would be Libertarian, but I think our world is too corrupt and evil to be left completely to ourselves, hence the Authoritarian leanings. Hitler and Stalin both proved that the Zionists thrive best in free society, although the Zionists built the Soviet Union, and all of the prinicples it was built on, Stalin eventually turned against them. Anyway, enough ranting for today I think.   urlLink
