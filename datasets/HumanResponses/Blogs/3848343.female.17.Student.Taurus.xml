I will give a lil recap of yesterdays events    Monday 26th July    nothing much happened really...met the girls for our usual walk to school, got to school didnt do much really and i actually did work in classes but all i seemed to learn throughout the whole day is "u dont make friends with salad..." or chris, tim and zac for that matter hahaha...thanks to chris i had it stuck in my head and stupidly enough started singing the little tune around my baby sis...thanks to u guys i got woken up this morning (tuesday) to her singing it.. ARRGGHH!!!!. wat a great way to start the day aye lol..anyway back to yesterday, i dont really remember much of it except for the eating of the crushed up oreos at break  HAHAHAHA  and our walk around alllll the way to the back of our school grounds, its quite a hike, where we met the smokers and an asian that likes to grop people *cough*  FHIL  *cough* (btw im not blonde he just tells me to spell fhil that way)...anyway the day continued on with design and tech being the last and longest period of the day....i walked alll the way home with jenny cause her mum was too tired to pick jenny up....lol..jenny had a lil whinge hahha silly girl...i went home and sat on my computer for i duno how long discussing the geography assignemnt my group was doing but not actually starting my part of it till about 11.40 hehehe.....oh well ...and yes i watched the big brother eviction..even tho it really wasnt an eviction because they were taken out of the house and then told who won...so that kinda defeated the purpose lol..but good on ya Big Trev,..u deserved it!!!....i finally ended that day by going to bed at about 12.30ish which was kinda the next day but yeh thats beside the point.  So that leads me to where i am now...in today hahaha...i got rudely woken up by my sister singing that stupid lil song (thanks chris) and got a lift to school with jenny...suprise suprise while is at there alone as she was in an SRC meeting i actually did some work on my SGP and D&T design  *shock horror*  i can actually do work!!! ....once again when peopel started arriving i was reminded that u dont make friends with salad and then i headed off to first period to a teacher who think im lauren severino and i have problems and ...lauren is Erin Wood with major issues, including a heart condition...i think he is a hippy and needs to be fixed... QUICKLY ....the rest of the day was just as boring excpet when i got attacked by hassan on the way to class.... that was horrifying lol...that arvo we finished at 1pm and we went to hurstville and did our hanging thing but this time we only had beau and no chandu and we had to hear again all about their fight which is just sooooo stupid it isnt funny...but yeh they will get over it sooner or later...btw have safe travels in New Zealand bobo and watch out for the mutton dressed as lamb..haha u get it casue they have lots of sheep...ok well im amused lol...after hurstville i had to go to work where it was soooo busy....i finally finished at 11 after this islander group came in and bought like the entire store...i reckon they had the munchis personally casue they were talk about if fish fly do they become chickens....like WTF hehehe yeh well that ended and i came home to here...where i am sitting now all hypo eating icecream, oreos, mnm's and chocolate fudge...i wont be sleeping for a while..thats for sure!..thats it for now..im watching the OC on my computer&nbsp; lo...thanks sooo much Ralph mwa...

       ....cause im turned on!!...hahaha jksjks that just came to me then. HEYA everybody well today was a good day i think....(btw this blog is gonna be very short).&nbsp; I was gonna come late and miss out on DT casue my teacher is fucked and well i didnt want to go, BUT i was to loazy to get up late and get myself to school, if that makes any sense so instead i was kinda ready earlier and met kate and walked to school with her...  WE BEAT JESS TO THE CORNER , by like 5mins.... SO PROUD!!!.... we walked into school and joined our group which was very small to start with because the peaky girls took our guys back *gasp* lets go off and get pissed about it aye girls hahah...nah they came back quickly then all of a sudden our group was all so packed and close minus or plus a few ppl aye bridey hahaha. The day was kinda long i think until i got to Modern with Sarah and Sanja, we always have fun aye girls!.....todays lesson was different....i will give u a little run down,  SOPHIE  was chosen to explain something anyway she did and then gabby asks from across the class room and goes "can u repeat it louder" and sophie looks and goes " NO  i said u should have been listening i said it loud enough!!!" (bitchy tone) the whole class is like * gasp* , but not shocked casue well sophie always says shit liek that so i said to soph "just say it again that was really rude" she turns back around and goes "who asked me to say it again" we all go "gabby" and she goes "oh sorry i thoguht it was erin!!"(bitchy tone) at this stage i was like  *GGRRRRR*  and i said "thats it!!!, lets take it outside the room now everyone was laughing but sophie and she said "ok after class",....so of course i waited for her...she finally strolls out and im like "com' on sophie&nbsp; - are u trying to start me and"..and after he stating nothign when i asked what have i ever doen toher she is like "ok sure" *drops her folder ready for a fight*) ..at that stage i walk away pissed off and dumb found because  SOPHIE  was gonna take me on....LOL...the highlight of the whole thing was when Mahmoud runs back and goes " OMG PLEASE DO IT!!!... i want to see, i want to buy u lunch" - to me...hahaha...anyway im gonna forget about that moment in time untill sophie really does piss me off enough that we actually fight...evn tho it wont be fair cause i could snap her legs in half says kate hahaha.. Anyway we then had lunch which was kinda long and then i last period with ms nolan, where i did my textiles folder and took my textiels folder to the teacher, funny thing is i dont do textiles. hahah....if u had walked past our class u wouldnt have known what was happeneing, the guys playing games, girls on their phones, kim and abd singing (if u can call it that) sev, me and rowan eating and playing cards..ahaha and it was a maths lesson!...We then all met up and started our walk back to morty after school where adrian decides to tell us to not be mean to mary becasue she has feelings too etc (kinda wring coming from him cause he used to be the main guy bagging her out and also got suspended cause of her)..anyway what he said didnt stop us  'KATE, THAT WAS SO BAD'  -  'JENNY, IM SERIOUSLY PISSED OFF' , im sure she heard that but ignored us but then she was in the distance and jenny shouted  "AUSTRALIAN IDOL"  and she turned around and glared, she turned back and i laughed some loud laugh and she turned back around for some more glaring time...hahaha it was hilarious...i know ur all thinking omg ur so slack how can u bag someone out for trying, well the answer is easy, not only did she suck big time but she is a bitch and deserves everything she gets back!!!...That night me, kate, alana, and bridey all went to poulos's for movies and pizza..it was great...we watched the eviction of Big Bro first (and then ralph came and we made him unravel his lobster had ahaha to see his burns, poor kid but thats what he gets for lighting his kitchen on fire aye hahah...jksjks mwa) ( OMG I HAD TO EDIT MY BLOG TO PUT THIS IN HERE .....i got ralphs year 7 peaky ID card.....OMG FUNNY STUFF...he looked sooooooo differnt hahahaha..) and then put on Spiderman2...all i can say is i&nbsp;love spiderman1 but that movie sucked  BIGTIME , it was very boring (we all agree excpet bridey) and all i can say is the only reason i stayed watching it ws because its called spiderman2 hahah i just hope the 3rd one is better!....The pizza was good but lol.&nbsp; Katies dad then gave us all a lift home and here i am now sitting here listeing to praise chorus - Jimmy eat world and looking at msn.     [+]decisions i need to make       school work -   should i actually start doing my assignments haha...i think i know the answer to that but i really need to pull my finger out and actually do it hahaha. and should i have dropped Extension English, once again it was a question of effort, i could have done the course but i really couldnt be bothered.&nbsp; Btw ms finigan told our class that we should be doing an absolute minimum of 2 hours of study a night and should be working towards fitting 4 hours in....*shock horror* i havent done that much study this whole year combined hahaha...ooops..."whos gonna fail their HSC" ====>ME      work -  &nbsp; i have worked at maccas and then dominos and now maccas again but i really cant stand it, i need to go and get another job, NOT one that involves fast food of any kind!!!     something else - &nbsp; i duno what name to give it cause well its way to complicated. i wrote about it in yesterdays blog but yeh i still dont know what to do. Im still pissed off and cut, and i should just get over it and wel i dont want to be pissed at this thing again so i duno what to do, get over it and try or just block it out till i can totally forget about it hahah..i think i know what i should do but i dont want to be pissed off again      Design and Tech -   what the fuck should i do for my design and tech model. IF anyone has ANY ideas to improve our school cafeteria please please please let me know because basically im in shit HAHAHAH!      Netball -   We have to verse hurstville girls, we need to decide whether we actually try or just throw in the towel tomorrow cause all thats gonna happen is i will end up pissed off (remember last time we played hurstville - me and nicole)..oh well hahahah  well anyway i will leave u with some quotes      "....On my life I'll try today, there’s so much I've felt I should say, but.

       i dont even know where to start....i woke up soooo tired this morning, im putting that down to the fact that i stayed up till 11 just watching mary on idol over and over and over again...nothing can ever give that girl back her dignity, stupid bitch!!!....."were stuck on u"...lol...well the day was good, walked to school with the girls and watched marys audition on camera i duno how many times lol...had modern and then maths which i got out fo 40mins of cause i had ms ross...walked out walked back in got the camera and walked back out...stupid michael the goof took it and used the film to record ms webbs ass and up poor sarahs school...stupid lanky dickhead lol =>! i then had ancient and geography but inbetween was lunch where someone decided to tell me i looked like caroline, fair enouhg but it wasnt only one person...more like a whole table!!! and then zac, tim and chris decided to burp and fart in mine and sarahs direction... CONTINUASLY ...u stupid kids lol..love yas....also my stupid leb friend or should i say stupid  *filthy rich*  leb friend is gonna try and get me a phone...got to love ya...=). In the arvo me kate and jen went to hurstville (birdey was missed due to her being sick but im sure there will be other times..hahahah..certain of it)...where we met alana...dead set we ate so much hahaha...kate made herself feel sick lol...not suprised...we went to get rolls and well th aisan man serving had this severe problem or a twitch in his eye.... kate and i were a lil freaked out! Once kate left alana me and jen went to get a few supplies from coles...who ever knew there were sooo many different ham varietys....jenny needed ham but didnt know which ham type or how much so yeh good guessing on our behalf lol...when alana left us jen and i ventured up to the library (another one of our many homes)..it was great..saw alil eye candy (not my tpe of candy - more so of the asian lolly variety)...we talked with chandu for like an hour and then went to catch the bus which came  FREAKIN EARLY ...we missed it by 2 seconds....which was my fault...apparently...and then waited half an hour for the next which was then late....so we had to ask ourselves  "WHAT IS THIS, BUSH WEEK??"  - it is i swear - never ending!!! finally got home even though i had to walk home with rick, that asian kills me!!!...so basically at home i have done nothing once again accept watch tv, think about  ALL  the work i should be doing and not doing it hahaha.....its a great like hahaha....btw jen and my tape is almost finished so any last things u want to put on it let us know ok!?!   Got two shout outs one to adam...HAPPY BDAY FOR YESTERDAY ADMAN....and the other HAPPY BDAY FOR TOMORROW SEAMUS!...hope u guys had/have the best days out! i cant think of things to write about as my lil special thoguht of the night and this is all i could come up with while looking at song lyrics...    [+] things im i can control/incharge of      my life   -   well most of the time excpet when intoxicated hahaha but i suppose i make the desicion to do that so my choice, my life....just remeber u have choices and what u do should be done becasue u want it to not becasue anyone else wants u to do or be something.     my money  - &nbsp;not that there is much of it at all, but then again thats my fault hahaha   my future  -  thats right i decide what i will be doing, know one else woohoo how mad is that kinda scary but no one to blame when i do shit hahahah   my jenny  -  thats right u - i own ya lol...hahahaha im the one that can MAKE HER LATE, all my fault hahaha and can tell her what to do - even tho i think she controls my life more then i so hers = S hahaha...     [+] things on my mind      nothing  -  i think thats a problem, i cant think of anything to write about or of anything actually going thru my head haha...scary lol   ppl being involved instuff that they shouldnt   -   &nbsp;  i guess i can think of something. i hate it when certain people are involved in part of my life that i wish they werent....not that i hate them or anything but i just wish they didnt get involed in stuff....cant help it tho haha   what to do  -  do i try or not, too hard to think...let me ask u...u have two options one where u know that if u do it u might regret it further down the track but it will make life so much simpler for now or even for a while....the other is the second choice where u can do soemthing that will cause u to feel stressed and possibly have to go through the whole situation again and agian and again which just gets draining...what would u do?...let me know     the past  -  if things had been different a while back and i mean liek a year ago, where would u be today...often gos through my head but then i think WAT THE HELL AM I DOIN??...u cant change the past, its not possible..i actually dont see why people think about it sooo much because its gone and nothign can change it lol...kinda funny really..we dwell on stuff we cant change, maybe thats just so we dont ahve to face the things we can lol (how profound hahahah).. well anyway i think thats enough for tonight guys....heres a quote again     "....You'll change your mind come monday and turn your back on me. You'll take your steps away with hesitance. Take your steps away from me. I'm making my peace, making it with distance. Maybe that's a big mistake....."

HOT STUFF ...apparetnly she didnt even know it was blue till we told her lol.&nbsp;As we walked to school i thought we cant all walk into school together as we all have dark almost balck hair now hahah...I aint a goth...i duno about the other two tho....i did here about some kinda of goat sacrafice that they perfomed last week but i duno...dunt ask, they might put a hex on you!..lol.jksjks girls...To start school off i went and dropped extension english (im sorry Sanja and Lala, i just aint that bright...We will always have the chicken tho.....BBEECCKKKEERRKK  {thats a chicken sound} ...bloody dickheads)...Well the rest of the School day&nbsp;was GREAT.... HARDLY ....the day went suprisingly quickly for me, except forin maths with kim where we did nothing, and in Modern with Sanja and Sarah where we did nothing and in Design and Tech where i helped jess pretend to do something lol....Last period was tutorial where we learnet about Alcohol and the effects on ur body -  A LIL LATE!!!  did u know that once drinking you find the opposite sex another 25% more attractive then usual....that answered alot of questions for people...hahah aye girls lol...another conclusion i came too, if ur a girl with high standards just be permanantly drunk and then im sure you will find someone that wets ur whistle lol....so to speak!&nbsp; Over all the day was good cause i got to see people i had missed all holidays and well others i hadnt missed..nahnha i love you all!....i reckon the highlight of the day tho was when jenny got her book 'Black Africa" and smashed it over charles head (so maybe u will here of us terrorising asains in todays blog hahah)!!!! -  HILARIOUS ... yeh so once school was over i walked home to mums, on the way i got credit but, wOoHoO...since then&nbsp;i have been sitting around lol doing umm...i duno what...but yeh time is still passing by and running out lol  [+] things im counting down till     my birthday  - 283 days till i turn 18...woohoo then me and beldon are going to Oatley pub to get pissed at lunch..= )    till year 12's leave  - thats less then 50 days     till im in year 12 -  just over 84 days, then there is no more mucking around we finally have to do what the teachers have been "preparing" us for for the last 12 years hahaha.    till the end of school -  just over 4 terms left till we have no more school, how nerve racking, how exciting but    im not sure what else im counting down till but im sure there is heaps more stuff!!!

       Today was a rrrreeeaalllyyy long day i think...well for me anyway. Once again on a mornign when i was looking forward to sleeping in i get woekn up my my 2nd youngest sister yelling/asking me where her scungies for netball were...i was just liek  FUCK OFF ....but after being woken up like 6 times, so i got up in a pissed off mood but quickly snapped out of it...i dont remeber why i think it had to do with the fact that my sister and mum left and i was lying infront of a warm heater ...i wish i was back there now... i lazed around a little more and then got up and went on msn where i made a new hotmail&nbsp;account  urlLink  trexsdinoworld@hotmail.com   so incase u didnt know thats me&nbsp; as well as my  urlLink  t_rex_bites@hotmail.com   one lol... i will still be using them both.&nbsp; Eventually i got ready to go to netball and had to like an hour and half earlier and go to hurstville.&nbsp;&nbsp; i only found out why wen we got there...was to go bra shopping for my sister....and as all my girl &nbsp;friends would know that would be a  "  BIG"  job especally for her...it was hahaha...lol...anyway we then ate lunch where i got the best roll ever ...YUM and i saw jen and my cleaner friend, bryan...and its a first  HE WAS ACTUALLY CLEANING ...i know it seams weird he is a cleaner but that was the first time we have ever actually seen him clean anything!...bloody asian bludger haha jksjks...well after lunch i went to get jenny from work but she had already left so i went round trying to find her but ended up meeting her at our usual spot casue she is sneaky and got out of work really quickly...i swear watch those asians they are like flys...hang around wen u dont want them but wen u do they cant be found!&nbsp; We drove to netball and then had to get changed...it was  FUCKEN FREEZING .....soooo cold...and btw winds and netball skirts dont mix really well.&nbsp; the game was funny...out of control really..there was a chick on the other team who i think had a secret..kinda like a miriam style secret but yeh anyway she was really rough and kept swiping at ppl and she tried to do it at me and i full shouted at her " YEAH RIGHT " and well evryone was like WTF...haha jenny and i started crying with laughter....poor jenny had her as her partner tho and well everytime jenny touched the ball she would get hurt..in the end jen was scared and would serisouly flinch everytime she had the ball....stupid fucken bitch, try and hurt my friends....but it was ok...we won 26 - 13...YEAH thats right.... "OATLEY # 1 ".... far from it really..but i can dream hahaha. After netball we drove jenny home and then mum and i went to hurzy..AGAIN to go food shopping..i scored wat i wanted but so it was ok....my mum was even trying to buy me alcohol and asking me what spirits i drank even though she thinks i have only drunk once....confusing...the conversation proceeded with her telling me about how she so wanted some guy the other day...and im like wellll okkk then..the convo can stop right here lol..nah it was pretty funny i think...if hse gets a boyfriend at least she will leave me alone! plus she kept going on about that stupid santa joke again and clearly it wasnt that funny......if at all!... tonight i was supposed to go out with friends but we couldnt make up our minds so yeh we went nowhere....how shit is that...that has inspired me to right about   [+] things that bug me  &nbsp;  friends -  as much as i love you all so much,&nbsp; sometimes u get on my nerves....its not ur faults just trying to organise stuff but there is always something wrong or confusing and its not simple anymore...i guess people just change...see what oatley has done...Also other friends that dog others and expect us to be fine with it, even thouhg we will always be there for when something goes wrong but it is made hard when we feel like we are just second best....but hey thats only one moment in time..for every 1 time somehting is wrong there is 100more tiems that u make my life sooo much better.   people obbsesing over parties -  as much as they can be fun why do people only feel like they can have the most fun when they are pissed off their brains.&nbsp; like i will admit wen i do drink its fun and i have a mad time but its not the only thing to do like things can be so much better wen we are all just together in our usual hypo moods terrorising the streets hahaha   the truth -  not knowing the truth really. HAving to be unceratain about people and if they are trustworthy or not or if they are telling you the whole truth.&nbsp; Sometimes it is best not to know the truth but if its gonna come out sometime, there is no time like the present.   not knowing the reason for thigns -  like not just simple things like why chewing gum always seems to get stuck to shoes hahah but things like why are certain people here and others arent, why can people see things that others can't, is there a reason why some people have to see things they wish they didnt becasue it will stick with them for life....sorry just rambeling on..i dont think anyone else gets what i mean but yeh....my twisted head lol.   [+] Guys on my mind    Marcel -  you are just so hot lol i cant get u off my brain...nah nah jksjks....u are da bomb "this is too primary school for me" hahaha...marcel is the coolest, known him since i was 7...gees thats a long time ...lol..woohoo....love ya..mwa   Matty -  he is probably the shortest guy my age that i know, but hes still coo and is such a mad b-boy lol...(is that even what i should call ya...hahahi woudlnt know)..&nbsp;u wanted to be mentioned and all i can think about is how when we are together its like that add for tooheys "what mates do" casue well think of it this way...matt comes up to my tits and well he is always wanting hugs....should i be concerned....doesnt matter if he starts to annoy me too much i can always suffocate u...hahah...nah i still love ya matsta =>   Guys in general -  all so confusing, but couldnt live without u all hahaha...its like a curse i swear...soppp unfair   Ralph -  thinking how mad it is that i have ur phone at the moment casue i can actually see the whole screen, even tho i have no credit to write msgs at the moment, its still cool but.......= )thanks ....MWA   Nathaniel -  HAPPY BIRTHDAY BOY!!!!!....ur 17 now woohoo time to get ur P's, u can drive me places hahaha YAY lol....hope u had a great day...love ya kid...mwa  ANYWAY....i got to have the chinese i wanted for dinner tonight...it was soooo YUMMY.... oh yeh also i was listening to the u2 song "with or without u" in car today and i have heard it sooo many tiems but yeh i just realised how much i love it..its hte best...hahaha... i think this is the end of my blog for tongiht..im sure there is alot i have forgotten about during the day but if its important i can always write another one hahaha  i thought i would end with a quote...tongiths is from Shannon Nolls learn to fly hahaha (only cause it was aon the radio and make sense     "....When you feel the dream is over,Feel the world is on your shoulders,and you've lost the strength to carry on.Even though the walls may crumble,And you find you always stumble through,Remember never to surrender to the dark.Cos if you turn another page,You will see that's not the way, The story has to end......."

We went into coles to buy..um supplies..nah just food and saw this guy that once said stuf bout rachel so of course we ripped out the camera and recorded him as jenny went down ALL the aisles shouting "YUCK YUCK YUCK" lol....At pouloses house...wen we finally walked there and the girls arrived we spent waiting and dreading jess's arival due to the fact that people still hadnt arrived so they could stuff it for us ....BUT NEVER MIND...jess's saab pulled up and  we all stood at the dorr on the ready...she opens the door and see the camera and i was WAITING for the rest of them to jump out..it was kinda like 1,2,3,GO, GO,   GO....and then finally they did (suprise her) the rest of the day was spent reminissing, catching up and luaghing alot...untill marcel, drew and adrian and then we laughed a whoolllee lot more...we all left at around about 5.30 which the started the daunting task on msn of tryign to work out WAT THE FUCK we were gonna do that night....well we finally decided we would go and hang at marcels..so sum how i conned my bro into driving me jenny and jess there while on the way picking me and jen up some "SUPPLIES"...he can be a good boy sometimes...anyway, at marcels, jess, me , jenny, kate, alana and bridey along with marcel walked to maccas and bought some food...we WERE going to get ice creams...but if u looked at the sundae machine i think a camels riders' undies would have been healthier and cleaner hahahah...drew and adrian met us up there and after going into franklins we went back to marcels where.  Adrian took jenny down on the pegs of his bike...porr jen..lucky to still be alive hahaha....oh and us girls excluding jess took (ok really it was me who took it) chris - the faggats P-Plate and wrote Poof on it..love erin hahaha...casue its true and everyone shoudl know hahaah...too bad i couldnt put it on hi car...had to just stick it in his letter box...sorry i will apoligise to his grandma now..but really i dont care hahaha...back at marcels jenny and i got into the "supplies" .....finished a whole bottle between us 2....sooo proud...i remember up till about 11ish...hahaha or a lil b4 hand...yeh really quite funny...all i can say is MARCEL IS A PORN STAR and jenny u loved it....msn was funny not that i know what or who people were talking to but ohwell...yeh if u guys and girls that were there last night, or u are someone i was talking to i would reallllly appreciate if u could tell me somehow what exaclty i was doing lol...Jen i asked my bro if we were smashed and he goes "nah u werent totally gone, u were just as bad as each other"...so we couldnt havebeen TOO abd cause my bro thinks being smashed is like our "a bit drunk" stage hahaha...well that ends my blog about yesterday...so to move on i was just talking to kate about chinese and i thoguht i would all share it with u....U know that smell when u first open a chinese takeaway container...i dont care wat food it it....it always stinks..hahah i hate that smell!!! and another thing i hate is being woken up in the morning by a lil shit oing "WAKE UP ERIN WAKE UP"....the lil shit being my sister...suprisingly her voice vibrates thru ur head wen u wake up from a nigth of drinking b4 hand.... today wil be good..im off to do i duno what yet but no doubt u will here about it later on hahaha....ssooo Checkyas laters...MWA

       TAKE A MOMENT   Ur gonna grow old strong and free  Don’t even think Ur gonna leave me  Just take a moment start to here  what life would be like without u near:   Our hearts would break our eyes would cry  a thousand thoughts of just why  you think u had to go  when u were a person we loved to know   Just imagine us all sitting here, with u looking on  why are words hard to use, with such a precious life gone  You weren’t with us for many years  But Ur still the cause of all our tears   Those days u were with us, u felt in strife  Your obituary was so short but then so was Ur life.  Is that how u want to leave  Abandoning us here only to grieve   Ur gone prematurely even though u shouldn’t  Leaving us to deal with what u couldn’t  Too much strain now, my shell starts to crack  With out you here life begins to lack   Did u ever think how we would feel?  Without u around us nothing can heal  What we are having to go through,  Having to live hear without you   Let these thoughts go through your head  Think of this next time when you wish to be dead  and if after all that, if your thoughts continue to mount  Just remember we love you, tell me that has to count.   another one just letting people know that they are special...

       SILENT FAREWELLS   Someone took your life that moonlit night,  The stars were dull no one insight.  It came for you waiting your fall,  Your named it whispered as its call.  It was to get me to, unbeknown to you.  What was tearing me up, you had no clue.   You walked in the town late that night,  The streets lit dimly with little light.  The road was narrow dark and bleak,  Your pace quickened as the wind begun to sneak.  Houses lined the street ever so tall,  Staring down on you, waiting your fall.   You turned to look at where my house should be,  Instead an ugly grey structure to which you hold the key.  Seemed to be in place of my loving home,  “Watch out” it almost seems to moan.  You open the gate and the door to follow,  You shouted my name into the hollow.  No response was heard, not even a creak  You thought, “Why is it she wont speak”   20foot tall the walls grew  Holding their breath as they new  What was after you was going to take me  No chance at all for you to flee.  You tried flicking the switch but the light stayed dull  No sounds, no noise, not even a lull.  You started to wonder what was going on  Where was I, what happened, what went wrong  Before you even had time to think  It came and took you in a wink   You never fussed, you just stayed calm  When this dark creature pulled out her gun.  With one quick shot your lights went out  As dark as the rest in the house.  I looked into you eyes, what have I done  My insanity had over come  I had just sent the one I love  Into the heavens of above.   My jealousy of you all these years  Had finally come out with many tears.  You trusted, listened and guided me,  Im sorry I couldn’t help it, I went crazy.  It’s just not fair, for me to be here  I took the life of the one I held so dear.  I cant live with myself its just too tough  Load the gun, pull the trigger, I’ve had enough.   This one was written for school haha.....pretty funny lol...

       UNHEARD EMOTIONS   A shell is something you use to hide  All the emotions you feel inside  It fills up slowly bit-by-bit  Finally the pressure begins to hit  The shell pushes you deeper in the ground  Soon you will be so far gone you cant be found  I reach in to try pull you out  But your thoughts pile on and continue to mount  It becomes so heavy it’s hard to breath  I’d let you go but you’d still recede  You tried to convince me you had it made  But slowly your smile began to fade  You don’t know who to tell or what to do  Instead you cave with the fear of you   I came to visit you one day  I walk up the stairs the usual way  The walls seem to speak with a silent breath  They whisper amongst them the sounds of death  I walk down the hall and open your door  My heart stops its beating at its hits the floor  You eyes are open with the fear of despair  I don’t know how to react with you hanging there  I move quickly with the thoughts of why  How could I have not heard your cries?  I pulled you down to help you cope  I’m holding you with the thought of hope  You lay there helpless in my arms  How was I supposed to guess your harms?   As I sit there and begin to weep  You awake from you frightful sleep  Almost disappointed to see my eyes  This is the last time I will fall for your lies  You turn to me your body so weak  Softly I begin to hear you speak  “You don’t understand how hard it is  Trying to be here when you don’t want to live”  I don’t get how this has come about  Speak to me, let it all out  Please help me understand what your going through  I cant do anything without the help of you  You need to understand how much I care  Don’t you know what you have to share?  I cant figure out how you got this way  You never told me what you needed to say  Now its your turn to listen and my turn to share  You can pretend not to believe, but I know you care   Life goes on even though its hell  You’re so loved, but you just can’t tell  Your life is so precious and dear to me  I still don’t get why you tried to flee  I’m so glad that I wasn’t too late  Open you eyes just listen watch and wait  As I look into your eyes they begin to pour  All the emotions unseen to me before  The life you live is what you own  And I will always be here when you’re alone  Never be worried that I don’t have a clue  Just remember one important thing -  I LOVE YOU    This poem means the most to me out of all of them...i guess its just something in the words that just lets everyone know that they are always thought of and with out them life wouldbe totally different

      Well guys i have been kinda bored and was wondering how i could make them more interesting...so i decided i would share some of the poems i have written in the past...each has their own special meanign to me and well i hope others might be able to see something in them...so here we go   MY FINAL GOODBYE  I had dreams we would all live as friends, But what are dreams when reality bends. Always being blamed, always copping shit, I’m done, it’s over, I’m sick of it. It will be final, life will end. You will carry on all as friends. Never will I see it from your eyes, Never will you have to hear my cries.  It seemed to me that we were friends, It could have been forever, till the very end. Those times have changed, we had to move on. You can leave your time has gone I will look from afar and see what may have been, Wonder and wish but never have seen We have to stop, forget and forgive. But how can we do that, it’s too hard to live.  Is it the answer, is it the way Or do I say goodbye another day. You may have happiness and love in your eyes, But mine are blank and its up to me to say our goodbyes  My final goodbye, the time has come. My journey, my trip, my life is done. U tried to help, but it didn’t work. It wasn’t you but I was hurt. Cya sometime, another day But until then all I have to say. This is it, the end My final goodbye goodbye  this is the first one ...more to come

      Today was a day filled with alot of laughs and wierd people lol so i will run through it for you.... it starts when i rocked up at jennys at like 8.45 and by 9am i was already buggard from her overpowering "energy shall we call it. We went to the station where we got on a train and well to show that our day was already gona be weird the trains were going o the opposite platforms compared to usual and well that was confusing... just before the train pulled away we saw tim....*absolute losty* on the station...he was going to kirawee and yes tim we know u like that chick...dun worry ur secrets safe with me and jenny *cough cough*. we met antionette at hurstville station where we caught a train to redfern and i dont care whether u think it was peak hour or not girls....the train was still packed like an asian household in china!!!...we changed trains and went to burwood where we started our long walk around looking at clothes and accesories.... ant was a lil dissapointed with buroowd but jenny still managed to pick up a bargin...it got a lil boring so we decided to catch a train back to good ole hurzy...well this train triphad its share of weirdos too!...apparentyl (cause i ddint see anything but ant and jen spot it) was a man with a phone camera...SORRY have to edit that....it was a full on digital camera...no a phone..wat a freak (HOW DID I MISS THIS) who moved near us and took pictures and then pulled out a video camera....ONCE AGAIN - how i missed it i duno but jenny very subtly made us move 2 carriages down without me totally going why do we have to move for lol?!?!"...back at hurstville we were in our natural environemnt....antionette got called into work and so after we had our tucker she left us and went to her delicatessan. We met Charles, Phil, Daniel and their friend Gab (who looks like hs is about 10 but anyway) and boy do those boys like to shop....they bought more then us girls lol...so basically the rest of the day til about 5ish was spent hanging round hurzy with the guys..we were gonna get phil to try on girls clothes for us but after his detail description of what his "man hairs" would look like in a skirt..we decided STRONGLY AGAINST IT!!! jen and i left at about 5ish and well the day was over..very long and tiresom due to all the walking lol... even though bushweek was over we still saw alot of familiar faces around the place...michael peck, chris peck, sophie, chealsea, etc etc...boys were amazed that all we did was shout out to people constantly wen we saw them lol...even tho there is no need to shout to antionette.she hears my woof whistle and comes running hahaha (she knows shes wanted =P) Since i have been home i cant handle it....my sister the 2nd youngest one has been an absolute bitch!!!....blamming me for everythin that has gone wrong..i had to lock her otu and me into the office out the back to save me from hitting her...the lil shit really doesnt know when to stop....she thins she is always right and well really doesnt know how to be a smart ass or use sarcasim in a fight....gives me the shits more..PHHEWWFF....needed to let that out. oh and just before i finish this lil blog i have to say last night jenny sent me a lil video clip thing and told me to watch it....not onyl was i watchign it and thinking WTF casue it wasnt working properly on my computer but it was in KOREAN..i coudltn stop thinking "I duno about u jen but i dont get this asian bullshit"...it wa something about some girl going blind and the man that loves her giving her eyes to him....i guess that k

      i want to be the one to pull the plug!!! lol...hahaha that was inspired by jenny. Well there are many things making me mind tick away today....considering i woke up at 11.30 (for me thats the longest sleep in ever)there really isnt much of a day so my brain is fitting in all this stuff into half a day lol  *-*Things making my brain tick -     him  - sooo much i could say, but there is sooo much that i have already said that i dont know where to begin. so here i go...im still gonna be ur friend, im still gonna be here for u, i just dont want to hear any more apoligising, taking back of things once said, bringing up the past, talking about me just being ahppy with some other person who doesnt exist casue well thats just stupid etc....if u want to move on, then shift ur butt into gear and MOVE FORWARD not into reverse...and can i just say i dont like it wen people try to speak for me or group me into how they are feeling, something that annoys me...thats all i have to say really on the whole situtaion....lets just move forward...so next time we speak....remeber what i have just said here and we will be fine ok....thanks  Fairy tale worlds and movies -  i saw "the prince and me" yesterday with jenny, poulos and bridey and well truthfully to me it really didnt cut it as far as a fairy tale story should go....it was kinda weird...excpet for when the prince proposes with a butterfly over this absolutly gorgeous ring...one of the most romantic thigns ever *sighs*....i think every girls dream at some stage is to be a princess...its just how it is, theres something magical about all those dresses and jewellery lol. i sat there talking to someone on msn yesterday about why some guys just have to hurt u on purpose and we decided that in our fairytale world, all guys are to be seperated from each other untill 21...that way they can all be like nice princes and u can see who they truely are with out the assholes they hang around with and are trying to impress....isnt that right poulos.  The line from the movie yesterday  - it was so true...it was something about love and was from romeo and juliet....somethign along the lines of "suns light can be clouded to stop somethign to do with heaven" truthfully i dont rememeber what it was but it made alot of sense....it basically ment that love makes u blind..being inlove means seeing only the good things and not being able to see the bad because u are blinded by ur love...so basically that has been going throughmy head as well....lol i just confused myself....if anyone knows the quote im talking about please let me no   A quote from another movie -  i was watching now and then today and the man known as 'crazy pete' said "many thing happen in your life which u cant stop or change, but they are no reason to shut out the rest of the world"...i think that peice of advice which everyone can take into account in some way or another...whether it be because of soemthing so large like a loss of a life or something small like coming last in something....just think about it...life will go on and there are always people around u even though u may not realise it that will make it better.  FRIENDS -  no matter what happens they are always there...u dont always think about it till there is something wrong or when u feel like u really need them....but just letting u all know..no matter what happens...u guys are all the best and i wouldnt replace any of u...i love u all  The end of Bush week -   all though u might not all realise it...today is the last day of bush week for th year 2004...i hope u all enjoyed it and we all anxiously await its return next year....and just remeber when something happens that is out of the ordinary u have to say "what is this bush week" because thats wat bush week is all about...expecting the unexpected They are a few of the things running through my head today...very random and often very confusing i know but they make sense to me lol....oh and this is a little note for jenny...i hope she can catch on "im the one who put u on the top of my "to do" list" LOLOLOL hahaha....catch my drift lol... checkyas laters...MWA

      welll i will re cap my last 24hours for u and then tell u how im feeling today yeh...  Friday, 9th July  the day was spent with the girls (well some of them), bridey, kate, alana, jess and jenny wacthing DVD's at my house.  The hardest part was deciding what we wanted to watch but before that could be done we all had to go and get food from across the road. Bridey said the words "pepperoni Pizza" about 50 times so there was no doubting what she wanted.  So we got that for 5 bucks....last time i get cheap pizza without coupons considering i dont work there anymore...wooohooo....lol the rest went across the 7/11 trying to decide wat to buy, once they did they came back to domnios were bridey decided it  would be a good idea to moon the managers on the inside LOL...well back to the movies and we decided after much debate that we would watch "10 things i hate about you", which was a great choice except for when kate and jess decided to recite everyword to the whole entire freaking movie and jenny offering pplpopcorn every 2 seconds!!! Once that was over the time was spent lazying about my house on the computers, sleepign or PLAYING IQIIQgames?!?!...who knew my friends were all nerds. well after all this we decided to head of to hurzy where we ate, chatted and officaly decided that the first holidays in the july holidays is "BUSH WEEK" thats right girls....it is bush week! me mosied on around for i duno how long and then jenny and i caught the bus home and the oters were still there. i then switched houses for the week so im back in Beverly Hills.  Then came the daunting task of deciding what we were goign to do tonight...it finally came to the desicion that bridey, akte alana and me were going to Kyams for fun with the girls, therese, layla, leigh, monte(who decided throwing meat pies would be fun..untill i got him back), lil will, big will, tom, Kyam, matt, jessy, aaron, edward etc etc.  i had a mad time, runnign around, marrying big will and doing whatever and then at 12.30 we had to deicde whether we were goign to the reseraunt in Oatley or home...after much callign and thought of mine (and stressing alana out greatly) we decided to go to the resteraunt. so well all started our trek to riverwood station where we met up with the stoners who well didnt get there weed in the end so they were pretty pissed...and not in a good way. can i say the highlight of the walk was FINALLY getting to take one of those security stickers that says "WARNING P.M.S"...thats right girls i fianlly got it!!! we caught the train to sydnham and on the way i ralsied that the other top i had one was missing (i only took it off cause it was too wet from the rain)...it was the top my mum bought me, first time i wore it and it was gone. i swear i put it in toms bag but who knows it may still be at kyams...well thats what im hoping...so i got really bumbed by that...at this time itwas 2.30 and i decided to save the resteraunt for another time and i went to morty station where i caught a taxi home. i got int he door at 3am and everyone was asleep...but this morning my dad some how new i came home at 3am AND HE DIDNT MIND. i was just like wtf? haha....So that was my last night adventure...had the maddest tiem untill my top went missing...makes u think how thigns could be different if u didnt make certain desicions...but thats a whollleee other story all together.  BACK TO TODAY  i woke up to the sounds of my noisey family at 11o clock including my bakar(grandma) that was over. i came on msn as i always do and well had a discussion with a "him"...omg i could have blown up...he decides to tell me how he "really feels" even tho he has supposedly told me how he really feels like 20times...but it changes everytime...todays themes was how angry and pissed off i make him.....im like oohh kkkk lets not open this can of worms becasue u wont be able to close it...be proud of me jenny i didnt say anythign mean back or anything....i was holding it in..if i said how i really felt i duno what could of happened.  Well that was another lil whing session. So Anwyay.....these are just tiems when u have to look at the positives in situations and think abotu all the fun and friends you ahve with u....I love u all guys.... checkyas laters....MWA

      well once again I got woken up early today so im sitting here really bored, so I am going to blog about what it was I actually did yesterday...which when I think about it was umm nothing...so here we go...To start the day off nice and early (when I say early I mean it)someone called me at 3.12am....like who does that?! but because I cant see most of my phone screen cause its fucked I couldnt see who it was and I accidentally hung up. but yeh then I couldnt sleep but eventually I did and woke up at 7.10!! like what is this..I dont even get up that early wen I have school on. anyway I got up and sat listening to the radio and stuff for ages and on the computer...let me just say that was..V E R Y  B O R I N G.  Jenny then called me and I was teller her about the fucker ho called me in the wee hours of the morning only to find out it was her by accident cause she didnt lock her phone properly and well it went to msg bank so she wasted her credit...poor kid LOL. That conversation went for over and hour and half because STUPID ME taught the lil girl (jen) that if she calls me, even if I hang up, she will still be on the phone so if I go and pick up the phone she will still be there....THE WORST thing I ever taught her because she sticks around like chewing gum on the bottom of ur shoe!  We got off the phone and she was trying to make me do some home work so I looked at it, thought for a while and then realised that was enough work done for one day so I watched tv and my sister made me some popcorn. well the rest of the day was spent chatting online untill I had to walk over to my dads to mind my lil sister (who will later be referred to as 'lil SHIT') anyway on the way I met lewis and continued my walk....I made dinner and went back online and then my sister came home and I had to take care of her but the lil shit doesn't stop running around..shes like the energizer bunny I swear!  Well yeh while she was being all energetic I was trying to organise the movies for tomorrow night but that feel through so I decided I would just work again...im sure I will still have fun...I get to work with VELVET :>....And my other sis but she just does what I say hahahaha...well to keep the story rolling, I put my sister to bed after watching an episode of gummy bears and reading her a book then I went and watched ORIGIN!!....it was the maddest....Charles tried to tell me that QLD would come back after half time and that NSW could eat shit....but the only dung beetles I saw around were the queenslanders as at full time it was 36 - 14...thats right Charles EAT SHIT QUEENSLAND! anyway I was in a good mood after that win so yeh I talked more on the net and then thought I would hit the sack b4 my mood was ruined hahaha so I went to bed...thats where yesterday ended and today began....so basically as u can tell it was a whole pile of nothing....so now im back at my mums house listening to radio LOL and yeh well that concludes my blog for now....im sure there will be plenty more to come LOL... checkyas laters...MWA

I feel like we go in circles round and round and round if ya get me hahaha....sooooo much effort....like im sorry for hurting u and all...i really am but i cant do anythign anymore but move on and while u cant it makes it hard ofr our friendship to try and work...so what can i do....nothing....the longer it goes like this...the more cut he gets and the more pissed off i get...so yeh thats why i am being drained by that him....{would u i care more if u cared less...the answer is yes} - = 2nd him = - well this him makes me want to go C R A Z Y haha lol....la di da di da hahaha.... u make me sooo happy but man i cant figure you out...probably why u interest me soo much...not much more i can say really about this him but as any girl who has ever liked a guy b4 (which is all of us) u all get what im saying...btw i dont want any guy telling me girls are harder to read cause the truth is at least we say how we feel and dont hide stuff...usually...but yeh....anyway haha enough about the hims..i thoguht i would put a poem in here that i wrote...kinda corney and doesnt have a title yet but yeh here it is:  Your looking at me looking at you… I’m starring at you, your eyes so true I’m looking at you looking at me… What are you wishing we could be? Is there a future for us to share? Or is a friendship all our hearts can bare. Lets take a chance and start to live, We have love only we can give. When I’m with you I’m on a cloud so high, Looking down on others, letting time pass by. It seems so easy to be with you, Like my most favourite dream, finally come true.  You’re the only one on my mind Its like our love is one of a kind.  You make me want to open my heart to see whats inside I though it locked away for good but form you I just can’t hide You’re the reason I wake up the reason I dream so true The reason why I smile each day I cant help but love you  checkyas laters ....mwa

I'm up preparing for my driving lesson this morning it should be good, as long as i dont get behind the wheel..that could be a problem LOL. I have promised myself and a few of you that i will get my P's by next holidays...and i will...never break a promise. then i can go cruising around...well as long as i have money for petrol. me beaing broke and all. I start back a Mickey D's this week. at least its something i can do and well they FRICKEN GIVE ME SHIFTS.. thanks dominos..it was good while it lasted haha.. So how has everyones holidays been. So far mine have been pretty top stuff.  First night was that party in Oatley.. saw soo mnay people..ones that i hadn't seen for ages...i didnt drink but my friends did. Ralph and lewy u drunk boys...carrying u down to oatley station, one under each arm was a great way to start the holidays lol..nah it was fun...one thing could have made it better but i will keep it too myself..wOoHoO. Saturday day i slpet for most of it but then i got my hair cut and lisa straightened it for free THANKS HUN! and then that night i went and saw mean girls...pretty funny stuff..Lindsay Lohan is soooo gorgeous and well those "mean girls" were um shall we say mean and only one of them was actually pretty so i dun get it really. After that i went home to bed and woke up at 6am the next morning GOD ONLY KNOWS WHY and that day mummy (good old gal) took me shopping and bought me 2 tops and i didnt have to ask...wOoHoO.  That night i begged mum to let me out and yeh i went to Laylas and watched movies with some people...let me just say, teash sometimes u are soo lost, If u ever need someone kicked out of ur house call Kathryn ( dont take it personaly bonzo HAHAHA suck shit), Layla u are so cute, Monte u crack me up but stop putting on rubber gloves AND to lil ralph (who burnt his hand and foot in a house fire) dont ever tell me u are a good cook and i aint letting u burn my kitchen down hahaha...and having to carry u out to the guy was pretty funny...i wish jen was there but...lol...MWA. Then on monday our OFFICIAL first day on the holidays i went home and then went to Miranda with jenny where we shopped around but that got boring so we left and went to Hurstville and there were sooo many people there...so many ppl that are great to see but then there are few of u that we saw that well can go and jump for all i care....not litterally jump but yeh u get me piss off lol...haha jen and i were soo buggard by the end of the day we casught the bus home and i swear the bus driver had a humor problem..i really dont think he knows what is funny or not but yeh he almost killed us too...lol we survived so thats ok...i came home and thats where i have been since just bludging and talking on msn..which was fun at times and at other times very boring lol...i dont get it...why is it on msn i type but pretty much everyword i screw up somehow with my typing skills lol..but i am typing exactly the same now and well the words are all coming out right...weird aye?! lol...Jenny and i started a diet this holidays..i lasted 4 days, she last 1 hahaha....WHICH IS GOOD casue she didnt need to go on one in the first place.
