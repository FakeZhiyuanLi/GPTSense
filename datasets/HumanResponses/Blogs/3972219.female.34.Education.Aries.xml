						   From Roger:  I was, as you know, close to George and have spent much more time with him than any of my other siblings. &nbsp;We spent some 26 years either working together or in close contact when we were not working together.&nbsp; I can't begin to tell you how much I miss him. &nbsp;We talk about him everyday, still using his lines and clichés.

						   I have many memories of my best friend's father. He would sit and listen to stories that Karen and I would tell him even if they lasted hours. I will miss his delicious salads he would make for us on the weekends. I miss his smile...it was the greatest! He was one of the most well loved people that I will ever know. He always treated me like one of his own daughters in his home. I am very lucky to have known George and he will be truly missed by his friends and family.  Patsy

						   Thanks to all of you who have posted so far, keep them coming!&nbsp; It's been a hard weekend and a rough beginning to the week.&nbsp; After being attacked by divisive words it's easy to think that Satan's had his day, but then you hear the kind words like those Rose shared and you know that Love has the victory!

						   I met George in Philadelphia in the early 90's through an ad selling airlines tickets. I had no idea that our friendship would endure time and distance. He always treated me with the greatest respect and affection and I thank him for his company and conversation. For some reason we meet people that change the course of our lives. You can never pinpoint the time or place it happens, but it happens. I feel that my friendship with George was just that kind of meeting. We became friends when I was just beginning to find my own direction in life. He advised me and gave me the confidence to be an independent woman and strong in a world far away from my family in Texas. He was like a father to me in many ways. I sought his approval in many things - including boyfriends. The day he and Dave (my husband) met, they immedietly approved of one another! George is one of the most important people in my life. When I think of George I think of sushi (lots of it), good wine, really great fattening salads, 2 hr lunches escaping to Chinatown for dim-sum, martinis, sitting in bars in Philly and wonderful conversations walking around Old City. He helped me dig my car out of the mounds of snow in NJ and worried about my welfare when I thought I had completely failed in life. I think that George knew how much I loved him. I do regret that he didn't meet Olivia (my daughter) in person. He used to say Grandpa George when I talked to him about her. My own family circumstances kept me from visiting anyone but my father in El Paso up until his death this past November. I feel that George will always be a part of the lives that he touched. I'm fortunate to be one of those people and I will honor his memory by keeping him in my heart forever. I feel like he's escaped into the life of one of the characters in his novels and will live forever in the world he created (for us).  Love,Rose Gardea de Holston(Dave and Olivia)

						   Before George learned to fly, I took him up flying one day.&nbsp; He said he had read a book about flying and thought he could do it.&nbsp; I turned the controls over to him and after flying all over the sky, he said "There may be a little bit more to this than I thought".&nbsp; He did learn to fly.&nbsp; He could always master anything he set him mind to do.&nbsp; He was a wonderful brother-in-law and was always checking on my health because of my cancer.&nbsp; How could I guess that he would be gone before me.

						   &nbsp;I have many memories of my brother.&nbsp; He taught me so much and always challenged me to be more and do more than I thought possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember the sound of rain pounding on the tin roof of our farmhouse that signaled a day off from chores.&nbsp; On those days,&nbsp; George taught me about some of the classics through the game of "Authors" or we would read and make popcorn or cracker snacks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember his 1st chemistry set and how he practiced what he learned on me and I remember how he loved card tricks and was always saying "pick a card".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I remember he always called me on my birthday even if he had to track me down in St. Louis or Casper, WY.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will write more memories of George for his children and grandchildren&nbsp; when I am less sad.&nbsp; I thank God every day for his life and the love we shared.&nbsp; I miss him so much.

						   What can I say about my daddy. He is and was the smartest, funnist and most respected man I ever knew. I will miss calling him at all hours asking him to clarify something that my friends and I are in disagreement on. I will miss calling him everyday to see how his day is and telling him about mine -ultimately to get advise. My first and fondest memory is of me standing in the backyard of our home in Drayton and daddy asking, 'Who loves daddy?' and I would raise my hand and say, 'I do!' Now I do that with my son and it is the greatest joy. I can't tell you all how much little George looks like Daddy and it brings such joy to me to know that his name will live on - and hopefully his brains too!! Thank you Alicia and Deb for putting this together it means a lot to see how dad touched others lives so that we can pass it on to our children.  Love to all. K', Paul and Litte George.

						   Hello all. I’ve been digging around in my mind for memories of my Dad, and to me he is still very much alive and present. I’ve always felt like a chunk off the old block, so I guess I’ll always feel his presence. When I think about him, I think of him laughing, making jokes, playing jokes on people, teaching me things, and reassuring me. I think about how he would take on a challenge and own it, like learning to speak Japanese or building furniture. I think about what a comfort it was to have two parents who got along so well, and always made me feel I had a safe environment to prosper in. I think about the encouragement he gave me all of my life, which blew my head way out of proportion probably. He would always tell me I had “the world by the tail on a downhill run.” Dad was never one to sit back and relax for too long. He was always busy, busy, busy living. He would instant message me and be gone before I often had a chance to say hello and goodbye. There is so much I admire about my dad that I could write, but I am sure this website publisher would inform me I was out of space before I finished. I guess I am one of the luckiest people in the world, because I had him for a father. I guess the thing I miss the most is being able to go to him with questions. I guess I have to find the answers myself now, so I can answer the questions for Abby. I hope I can do as good a job. Thanks to everyone who is posting. I love the stories.

						   Uncle George loved me unconditionally and I will always be thankful for the encouragement that he gave me, He made me feel valued and special. As a child I admired him because he knew so much about everything. As a young adult, the time I spent with him helped me to grow and mature. I remember him asking me if I thought Jackie was too young for him, and I said no, because I knew he already loved her.I am so blessed to have had him for my Uncle. Tina

						   I have so many wonderful memories of Uncle George I don't know where to begin. I'm Catherine, George's niece by marriage to Jackie, Freddie's little girl most would say. What I loved most about Uncle George was how he seemed comfortable no matter where he was or what he was doing. Whether he was ordering us a table at the finest restaurant in town, or picking beans in grandma's garden. And he always shared with me whatever he was doing, and if I couldn't help, well he always let me help. And his laugh, how I'll miss his stories and his laugh. He always made me feel important and that anything was possible if I put my mind to it. When you first met George he seemed like a hand shake kind of guy, but he gave me the best hugs. Hugs and Kisses to you all!

						   Michelle and I would meet Uncle George in Philly for fine Italian dining. We would return to his quaint apartment for a relaxing glass of wine. He liked for me to call him "Uncle George". Kip

						   Hello All I'm adding your comments to the posts so everyone can read them more easily.&nbsp;  Deb &nbsp; July 19, 2004 I never had the good fortune of meeting George, but enjoyed knowing him through email and through reading his books. It was truly my pleasure to build his website at http://www.rdavidhunter.com. He was always kind enough to surprise me with signed copies of his books which I enjoyed very much and will treasure. I know your family has suffered a tremendous loss from his passing. I wish only the best for you. Sandy Meier

						   Innaugural Post....just days away from George's birthday July24th.&nbsp; I thought all of his friends and family could post some memories and stories of George to pass on to his future generations aka Abby, George, Marrisa, Megan, Maria, and Shawn.&nbsp;  My first memory of him was meeting him at Alicia's townhouse in Denver and thinking he didn't look nearly his age.
