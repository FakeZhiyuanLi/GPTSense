      I'm in a funk today -- well, I have been for the past week.  I'm kind of down and out -- and feeling very isolated and alone -- and normally I am quite content to be alone. I am a happy loner.  It's funny, I just called my mom and talked to her -- and  she told me she was feeling the same way. She described  my exact feelings   when she described how she felt -- better than I ever could.   It's strange.   We are born one day apart plus 27 years --  so astrologically, you have to wonder *is it in the stars* LOL.  I am not into astrology per say, but I do find that when I am down -- it gives me hope. It's something to read and look forward to.  Will tomorrow be a better day?     I hope so!  Well, ummm...it's house-cleaning day -- certainly not my favorite day of the week, but we'll see.

      Okay, so c'mon... fess up and tell me your preconceived notions about  housewives !  What does the word   housewife   conjure up in your mind? I want to hear it ALL.  Well, I don't want here any x-rated stuff, so you can  can  that...but anything else, feel free -- spill it and comment! Overall, I think the term has taken on a huge negative connotation in our society.  Yes, I am a  housewife .  That is no lie.  That is what  I choose to do .  I think most people automatically assume I am lazy, fat and sit around on my bum because I don't want to work.  Hey, that's your right but you couldn't be further from the truth.  It actually takes a strong woman today without children to stay home and take care of a house precisely because everyone does pass a  strong judgment  on her.  I watched a friend who envied me give it a try and she crumbled.  She couldn't handle what other people thought about her -- and she even had a child and the pressure was still to great.  Mind you, she didn't want to work and didn't -- even when she stayed at home LOL -- so that may have something to do with it LOL.  The mind is an amazingly powerful organ!  My week is actually quite busy because I do try to be a very  good  housewife for my husband and I do take my job seriously.  Youser!  That makes me sound like a strong devout Christian.    Pulhease!!!!! !!!!   That's not me.  I am not a timid wife -- no, Sir-ee!  My husband will tell you, he depends on me to fight for our rights when it comes to problems!    Anyway, my job entails as  I  have defined it:  mowing the lawn, grocery shopping, paying and managing the bills/taxes, running errands, cooking dinner every night from scratch, gardening and decorating.  With that, on an average week, I have about one and a half days off completely to myself (excluding weekends) which I can spend cleaning -- but you know, I do start to loose myself if all I do is clean! I do need my own idenity so I do take time for myself.  That is the hardest part of being a housewife.  At times, you start to wonder about who you are.  You start to wonder if you exist because you focus a lot of time on your spouse and caring for his needs.  The silly man I married has now kindly asked if I could pick out his work outfits the day before so he doesn't have to think in the morning.  I just laughed because he is inept at matching -- and took on this teeny side job LOL!  My husband and I agreed that more money wouldn't make our lives richer in spirit but rather the time it would take to make it would detract from the quality of our lives -- and so we made this decision jointly.  With my job focusing on our homelife -- when my husband quits working on Friday afternoons, we have 2 full days to do whatever our heart desires.  We can play until the sun comes down because come Monday morning, I'm here to pick up all the pieces.  We couldn't be a better team and all the happier for it.  I really feel sorry for the women who have to work full-time and run a house -- then add on the kids.  Yikes!! I mean if you are the type of women who is high energy and thrives on it --  I say go for it .  I'm all for happiness -- whatever makes you happy.  But if you are not, life must be a complete blur.  A blur I can't imagine...  Well, I kind of can imagine it.  I have met these women who are unhappy (I don't meet the happy ones for some reason) and they have come to my house and it doesn't take long for them to want to get up out of here and run --  and never come back .  Their husbands often comment on the gourmet meals I serve, and how clean the house is -- putting immense pressure on their wives -- who in turn hate me.  Frankly,  I can understand  why they don't want to come back again -- but you know what?    I am lonely for it.    I can't help it that my home life is a quality one, that my husband and I are happy, that we have free time and enjoy life.   Those are the choices we've made  for us  so don't hate me for it!!  I guess I am tired of it. It's wearing on me.  If you don't like where you are at, and you aren't happy -- make changes!  Change your life.  You and only YOU have the power to do so.  As former President Clinton said so eloquently last week, "Once you reach the age of accountability, there are no excuses."  PERIOD!

      On Friday night, if you were home and had nothing to do, you might have tuned into ABC's special on Guantanamo Bay.  It was down right gut-wrenching if you have even half a heart.  To see what the Bush administration is doing to human beings, it is a down right criminal act.  Thankfully today, the Supreme Court justices see that our president is bordering on the mental thinking of Hitler and they have finally acted appropriately against the Bush administration.  There is hope!   urlLink MSNBC.com Article

       urlLink    My Sweet Pea   I adore her with all my heart and would do anything for her.  She is my best friend and soul mate, and thankfully my husband allows me to give her endless affection without any jealousy.  Quite often, I blow a kiss in her general direction - - and my husband unknowingly blows me back a kiss -- and then realizes my kiss was intended for the dog LOL!  I love them both, and by the heavenly blessings, my husband understands that!  I couldn't handle an arrogant ass who couldn't respect that -- and god know there are a lot of them out there.  My husband and I were out to eat the other night and during dinner I saw one such ass hole.  I was quitely eating my deep-fried Borsin stuff mushrooms all coated in a nice breading when I heard him talk from two tables behind me.  He had just arrived at the restauarnt and wanted the world to know he was there.  Why of course, he was someone special -- he just had make sure you knew it!  My ears curled around to hone in on such an arrogant and ignorant voice.  At that time, I couldn't help but peek a glance around my chair looking diagnally behind me.  From what I saw, it appeared that Grandma had taken her grandson out to dinner for Father's Day so he could treat his dad -- obviously a divorce situation which grandma is trying to keep half a family together.  Good for grandma -- just too bad her son is a worthless piece of shit - no wonder the boy's mother was no where in sight -- who could blame her!  Dad arrived at the dinner table and that is when I heard him say to his innocent looking, if not fear-instilled son --  "Who bought you that shirt, son?!    Who  bought you that shirt??!!!  "  The little ten-year-old son didn't hestitate one second to repeat the words he knew his dad demanded of him.  Under his breath, but loud enough for daddy to hear, he said, " Daddy did ."    "That's right son and don't you forget it!" said the middle-aged bastard.  He looked like that famous guy whose name I don't even know in the radio shack commmerical -- the one who plays a role next to Vanesa Williams.  He had a crew cut, and looked like he was very anally dressed.  Its these half-wit, under-developed and mentally challenged men -- if only mentally under-developed -- who I could live without in life.  God damn, if I was ruler of the world, they'd all be required to back to get a civilized remedial education because somewhere along the line they never matured past five!

      Hey -- Since I live rural, I am looking for some good online forums -- which have some local connections!  I'm interested in forums:   - for women without children  - for women who chose to be a homemaker!  If you know a forum that has all of these  -- please post a comment and give me the details!  Yes, I choose to forgo my career (I'm educated with a Master's degree) to take care of the house and my husband.  You might call me traditional and while I don't call myself traditional -- this is one traditional value that has a great reward. By staying home and tending to our house, my husband and I have incredible quality time to spend together.  I get the house-cleaned, laundry done, shopping and errands complete, as well as tend to the lawn and bills each week before he gets home or is off for the weekend.  And you know?  We live a  great life  because of it.  Screw the theory that you must do it all -- bahh humbug!!  We are happier because of it and we both feel like winners!  Just sadly, I have yet in all the years met a couple who is doing the same thing and enjoying it like we are!

      A week ago today, I went to get my haircut.  I go to a small shop at the edge of town that doesn't require an appointment -- you know the quick in, quick out salons in strip malls that don't charge more than a few bucks.  I don't go there because I am cheap -- instead I noticed my husband who did go there got a reliable cut so I followed behind to see if I, too, could get a good haircut -- and while I don't get anything earth shattering, I have found this guy, Jim, gives me the best haircut I could find in this town!  Jim is an owner of this salon and I have been going to him for about two years now.  Each time I go, I can't help but be social. I am a talkative person by nature and find because I spend a lot of time alone, I tend to be really chatty!  I talk about whatever is on my mind within reason -- and  I stress  within reason.  I am not the type of woman to talk about  on-the-edge  topics like rashes, menstration, how horrible my husband is (which he is  not  by the way), etc. I just tend to recall situations, reflect on life, etc.  A few times I thought I was driving good old Jim crazy and so I decided to not speak much -- and low and behold Mr. 50s hairdo kept asking me the same question:  Is anything new with you?  How are you doing?  I realized that he was missing his entertainment LOL.  Actually, no, I think he enjoys my conversation.  Not getting much out me, he finally asked me a potent question:    Are you and your husband thinking of having any children?    That was the turning point in our salon relationship.  The conversation that followed changed my perspective on the man who was cutting my hair.    I don't disrepect him, dislike him, or have any bad feelings -- however, I learned that he is quite a feeling individual -- feeling instead of thinking.  When I answered him truthfully, I wasn't prepared for his answer -- though personally it doesn't affect me one way or another.  But what he said was interesting.  After I explained that I didn't ever have a biological drive to have children and that I fairly explained this to my then boyfriend-- now husband -- Jim couldn't help but tell me if he was my boyfriend he would have said that we could date -- but no marriage.  I looked at him puzzled -- and asked him if men were just as driven to reproduce.  He quickly retorted and said he didn't necessarily believe that men had the same drive most women did to have children, but he wouldn't marry a girl who had no biological drive to have children due to the fear that he would have to deal with " issues " down the road.  He said for a woman to not want to have children, she had to have something very wrong with her.  Mind you, I am sitting under a pair of wickedly moving scissors but I could see his point.  He had a point -- but that situation did not affect me.  I was not a person with issues.  I am level-headed and really know who I am.  I explained to Jim I totally understood his point, but explained that while I may be flawed -- I was flawed genetically in that I had no drive -- but in no other way.  Furthermore, I went on to say to Jim that he was smart to consider the fact that a woman who said she doesn't want children -- may have issues -- one of which might be that she would make a horrible mother.  But you know what?  I know I would make a DAMN good mother.  I know that because I take better care of my dogs than most people do their children -- and I explained that to Jim. I am compassionate, kind and very loving with my dogs -- to the point people get offended I could love an animal that much.  Jim said that still wouldn't change his mind.  He couldn't deal with that.  That blew my mind.  My haircut ended before I had a chance to bring up another reason for me not wanting to be a mother.  The reason is that I think this world is really going down the drain, and fast.  I see America loosing much of it's power, control and wealth -- and life changing dramatically for my generation.  The monetary desparity between my educated friends and non-educated friends is HUGE!    I don't think this world is a loving place for children.  I think of 9-11, terrorist threats and potential outcomes, murders, rapes, molestations, West Nile Virus -- you name it.  It isn't pretty and you know what -- I think that having children today can be a very selfish act.  I just didn't get to tell that to Jim.

      That is a good question!    Are you?    Well, I'd like to find out.  The reason I pose this question is, at the age of 36, I have yet to find someone like myself.  When I write  like , I mean someone who thinks in a similar vein to me, and desires to do what I do in life. I am not looking for a twin or an exact replica of myself -- just someone of the same  mold  -- if you know what I mean.  I am either an odd duck or very eccentric  -- but I don't feel I am the ONLY one who thinks like I do, does what I do or lives like I do -- so I am setting out on a mission to find someone like me!  Can you help me?   By the way, I am not the only person who will tell you I am unique. There is much more to this than what I think.  Over and over again in my life, I am pulled aside to be told I am different, unique, one-of-a-kind.  People sense it immediately and some are honest enough to tell me.  It doesn't surprise me anymore.    In the past few months, my hair stylist as well as home decorator (aka sales clerk) couldn't help but tell me I am  different . My hair stylist told me in the ten years he has been cutting hair, I stand out.  And my decorator told me that I have a  unique aura  -- that my aura is unlike anyone else's she has ever met!  Go figure, I don't know... Is it because I am me??  I don't hide behind societal norms? Because I am   HONEST  ?  So, back to the mission.  I am going to use this blog to write about myself.  I am going to share who I am down to the core in hopes that there are others out there who are where I am at in life.  I am hoping people can help me find out  why  I am so different!   I am an individual thinker who does what is right for me -- and it has lead to me lead a very happy existence.  It's just been an existance that people can't relate to -- and hence I find I spend a fair amount of time alone.  Actually, I need to be honest -- while I have always been different -- I moved to ruralville (in America) seven years ago which has only compounded my social problem.  Now, not only am I different, but in rural america, I am plain and simply FOREIGN -- which scares rednecks to retreat deep into the woods LOL.    Well, I won't ramble on today.  I am looking to find an audience who is interested to get to know me, learn about me and help me find some similar thinking people!!  Comment and let me know you are on board!  Here are some facts about me:  1.  I am a  36  year old female. 2.  I live in the  Midwest . 3.  I am happily  married  for 10 years in October. 4.  I have decided to remain  childless  by choice for many reasons. 5.  I passionately  love animals , trees and nature. 6.  I  detest cement  and cities.   7.  I am  pro-choice . 8.  If I have to pick a political side, I am  strongly democratic  in my thinking. 9.  I hate BUSH. 10. I am  not religious , yet I wonder if I am an old soul. 11. If you say you are catholic, I lift an eyebrow. 12. I fully  support gay marriage . 13. I dream of being  advice columnist  one day.  I get rave reviews for my advice when people ask me.  Ask me something! 14. I am proud to be me.  I like my brain - and I am mostly happy in my skin. 15. Favorite Quote:  "I belive evil persists when good people do nothing."  16. I am very vocal and honest.  I tell people exactly what I think. 17. A long time friend defined me as someone who does NOT tolerate injustice.  18. If I am in a crowd and I see injustice, I will stand alone against it unless I fear for my personally safety. 19. I believe our society has lost touch with reality.  We have become so pushed by commericalism, we can no longer see what is important. 20.  I find great joy in photography. 21.  I detest ignorance.

       urlLink       This is on my side of the fence. These are my dead raspberries poisoned.     In America, the law really works for the criminal. You can destroy your neighbors property and get away with it. It doesn't matter   how obvious it is who did the the dirty deed  , if they deny it --and you don't have photos of them doing it -- hey -- they are free! They are free to vandalize over and over again.

      My husband and I are making black raspberry liquor. Each week, we pick a few more handfuls and add them to our brewing jar of berries. The growing season for the berries is about over.  This morning, as common on most Fridays, I was mowing the lawn. When I went past the area where my raspberries grow, I noticed they looked like they were dying. The leaves were curling. The leaves had brown patches all over. My eyebrows quickly went up.  This is the exact spot where my neighbor has been throwing the branches she trimmed  on her side of the fence  back at us, so at first I thought it was just more dead branches being crammed on top, as she loves to put them there. But upon close inspection, that was not the situation. When I pulled on the dying limbs, nothing came free. These were my raspberries on my side of the fence, dying.  Could it really be???  Weed killer???  My husband said he had just picked a handful of berries from that exact bush just six days ago and put them into our brew!!!!  Is it poisoned now?  I want to cry... how sad!  I looked closer, and you could clearly see a path of something that killed my fern, my raspberries, a branch of my maple and part of my dogwood -- all along the fence line. Mind you the fence is two inches on our side.  She doesn't have the right to touch it!  When I looked closer, I saw weeds at the base of the fence  on my side  were deader-than-a-doornail too. It went in a clear motion from the ground on her side upwards and out as it reached the top of my bushes.  My heart started to pound. I felt so violated again!   I couldn't believe it.    She decided to kill my raspberries.   It can't be, I thought. I know she is evil but did she really cross that line?? It's  mental !  I quickly ran around the yard to see if other bushes were dying in the similar vein hoping to reassure myself that this evil situation didn't happen -- that it was an act of nature. But to no avail -- every other plant in the yard was healthy, fine and free of any such appearance. All my other raspberries were healthy -- on the other side of the yard.  This woman is deranged. I got my husband and he confirmed he too believed it was pesticides. He also confirmed he did in fact pick berries from those exact bushes as we have several around the yard last Saturday. I am guessing she sprayed them on Wednesday. I'm hoping!!  (edited out boring old history)  My husband and I discussed it and we decided we had no other option but to call the police and file a complaint. She keeps escalating things and we just want our peace!!  Live on your side and we'll live on ours -- but NO, the witch can't seem to do that! So, if she wants to continue to do things, we are going to keep a public record.  The police officer showed up, listened us out and then went next door to the bitty who had a garage sale going on. We heard her raise her voice shortly after he arrived, and then we saw them on the other side of the mesh fence. We could barely see them due to all the trees I planted several years back to hide her! We sat on the porch and listened.  The police officer walked around and sternly quesitoned her. He said, "It is obvious this was killed with pesticide.  How did it happened ??"  She replied calmly and in a forced soft voice, "I have no idea. I don't know how it happened. I just don't know."    She did confess to using Weed-Be-Gone on her side however!!  She pointed out the cut-off branches and said, "Those are on my side, see."  She went on to say, "I'm friends with Mr. Police Chief of the town. Can you call him? Blah, blah, blah....(I couldn't hear it)."  I couldn't believe it what I was hearing!!!!! She was trying to pull her strings again!!  What she missed was that I called the county sherrif, not the local police where her friend works. The officer took insult to her   I'm-special   comment and said, "I don't care who he is, I am with the sheriffs office -- and if you used pesticides here, I am going to have a serious problem with you -- this is criminal behavior."  And then I heard the neighbors come clamoring to her defense. They all side with her because they have known her for years and I'm the newcomer who broke all convention by standing up for my rights. Actually, we think they are  scared to death of her . She has a long history as being the neighborhood bully!   Hey she has or had connections, so watch out.  It seems to be working for her.  I heard the one neighbor yelling..."Are you having neighbor problems again?"  The police officer came over just as that was said and told us he has no doubt that there are pesticides on the bushes, but he doesn't have proof that she did it. He took a few leaves but he doubted that the county would pay to have them tested -- and so it sits again. He said they'd consider sending an investigator out. He promised as he left, he'd do all he could -- but we knew that didn't mean much.  I hope they do, but I am not holding my breath. I am seriously considering installing some more video survey equipment. It has worked wonders in the past -- people saw it and stayed away, and I am not shy about installing more of it right down her property line!!  Before he left, I reminded him that over the years, my neighbor has not had any property damage done to her.   I am the only one who gets property damage in the whole community:  hmmm...our brand new just built-by-hand dock got covered in black-top and our tires got slashed each time after we stood up against the neighbor.  See a pattern here???  I told him to look into it -- there is a long history here of her getting away with it and it needs to stop!  Video may be my only trick.  Then there won't be a question of who.  There will be no doubt.  That would be utter joy.

      &nbsp; Yes, as an educated woman, I have a silly and crazy dream.&nbsp; My dream is to be an    advice columnist .  &nbsp; I know, it's  hilarious , but I believe it is what I was meant to do in life -- I just can't seem to get it done and I truly don't know why!!&nbsp;   I am good, and I am that confident about it but I haven't put forth the effort to convince a paper to take me on. &nbsp; &nbsp;      First off, I live in a small town and these local papers don't have the space or a desire for an advice column and the larger papers in the state tell me I need experience first.&nbsp; I have written several online columns, but newspapers aren't taking those seriously!&nbsp;   So, right now, I'd love to answer some questions.&nbsp; I thoroughly enjoy it -- and thrive on giving good advice.&nbsp; Do you have dilemma in life?&nbsp; Are you confused?&nbsp; Do you have a decision to make?&nbsp; Are you unhappy in your relationship?&nbsp; Are you thinking of making a career move?&nbsp; Is your mother driving you nuts?   Ask me your question and I'll give you honesty and grounding.&nbsp; I'll put your feet back on the ground so you can move forward.&nbsp;  &nbsp;    Give me a try!

       urlLink      I don't know what it is, but I feel like I am in a dark hole.&nbsp; Everything is bothering me, I am sensitive and just want to cry.&nbsp; Reality check?!&nbsp;  No,  I am not pregnant, but I feel so hormonal!&nbsp; I hope this passes soon.&nbsp; Yesterday, I took my dog for a 1.7 mile walk with hopes that would help.&nbsp; It was sunny out, but it didn't feel like it.&nbsp; It was surreal and gloomy to me regardless.   Lately I have been worrying a&nbsp;LOT about my life down the road -- wondering where I will be in ten or fifteen years.&nbsp; It has been on my mind a lot. It's like it hit me like a ton of bricks, if I don't have children -- what will I be doing?!&nbsp; Will I be alone?&nbsp; My parents are older, my dogs are older -- my closest relatives are older -- my whole life as I know it will die away from me.&nbsp; That makes me SO SAD!&nbsp; I can't stop thinking about it.&nbsp; I love them all so much and all I see in front of me is loss after loss.   Then I think should I have children?&nbsp;  Do I want children? &nbsp; I don't particularly find this a pretty and inviting world so for those reasons a child would not excite me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not proud of the world in which   we  &nbsp;live -- though my own personal home for a child would be quite good in comparison to most.&nbsp; I would enjoy caring for it and loving it - but there is so much more to it than that.&nbsp; Plus, my one dog won't let me have children, he'd be too intolerable and I'd risk injury -- and with that, I couldn't bring a child into this world until his natural life expires and at that time, I could be 45!&nbsp; I just   can't   make him pay the ultimate price.&nbsp; No way,  Hose !&nbsp; I am confident I would resent my child for it over the years.&nbsp; It's not a pretty situation so I might not even have that choice...   And then my vicious wacko neighbor keeps cutting more branches and shoving them into my bushes.&nbsp; Call me hot-headed but I am so sick of it, I have been digging them out and throwing them back at her.&nbsp; She only repeats and I do the same.&nbsp; I am sick of that beast.&nbsp; The other day I saw my pine tree from the lot line.&nbsp; It's a half-pine-tree.&nbsp; She has legally and within her rights, clopped off her half practically to the trunk which is near the lot line.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Ughhh...   This is so unlike me!!!!!!!!!

      Yesterday we received a wedding invitation in the mail.&nbsp; The invitation was not received with enthusiasm, but rather  anger and resentment .&nbsp; It brought my husband and I back ten years ago to our wedding, and how it broke apart his family.&nbsp; The wedding invitation is for my husband's niece, Christine.   When we got married ten years ago, we jointly decided that we didn't want an elaborate wedding.&nbsp; I personally wanted to elope but to please my mom, I agree to have a  small  wedding.&nbsp;&nbsp; My husband and I didn't want anything commercial.&nbsp; We didn't want the big bash, loud music or crowds.&nbsp; We wanted a special occasion that was  very  personal.&nbsp;   In setting out to make our wedding special, we started out with a very small guest list of only 30 people.&nbsp; We settled on a list of guests that included:&nbsp; both sets of parents, a few of our&nbsp;closest friends, our siblings and his one remaining grandma and my aunt.&nbsp;&nbsp; We specifically chose   not   to invite children because we knew it would dramatically change our affair as we'd have twice the guests -- and a sit-down dinner for such a  small  group would be  dramatically  different if children were present.&nbsp; We wanted an adult only affair.&nbsp;&nbsp;We were getting married on a school day, a&nbsp;Thursday,&nbsp;at 4:30 in the afternoon at a restaurant,&nbsp;and we were having dinner there with a solo pianist -- so we didn't think it would be a big deal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   I knew that my husband's sisters had visions of how they thought our wedding should be because they made it well known.&nbsp; Upon announcing our engagement, his one sister told me that if we were going to have an intimate affair, that meant that we would have to invite a minimum of 100 people.&nbsp; The other sister, upon our engagement annoucement, told me she couldn't wait to "polka" at our wedding with her BOSS!&nbsp;&nbsp; At the time, not knowing our plans, I just let them talk and left things be.&nbsp; I wasn't particularly close to his sisters.   Once my husband's siblings received the invitations, they didn't RSVP to us as requested.&nbsp; Instead, they each called his grandma as he was living with her at the time, and told HER why they couldn't come.&nbsp; Cindy, Christine's mom, called and told us that she couldn't possibly get a babysitter even though she worked all the time and the children had an afternoon babysitter practically everyday day, but this day she just couldn't manage!&nbsp; Cindy had three daughters.   His other sister, Rob, called his grandma and told her that since her husband was the president of their condo association, and there was meeting that night, they couldn't attend either.   And last, his brother Tony called his grandmother and told&nbsp;her that his&nbsp;son had to go to   Cub Scouts   -- so they weren't going to attend either.&nbsp;   Realizing that his family was upset, I immediately called them each up and told them that while we didn't want to have children at the affair, we would love to celebrate "Aunt Fredette and Uncle Husband's" union with the children at a level the children would enjoy, appreciate and understand.&nbsp; Extending a hand of kindness, I invited each of the children to come over for a celebration pizza/video/sleepover party after we got back from our honeymoon.&nbsp;   I was flat rejected.     While his one sister, Rob,&nbsp;did show up at the affair last minute and stayed for a little while, we never heard from Cindy and Tony again.   For ten years,  not one  of his siblings has apologized or even made an attempt.&nbsp; They have flat ignored us and we certainly haven't forgotten.&nbsp; While his one sister Rob did make attempts to smooth over it, without an apology, we showed little interest.&nbsp;   We finally saw his siblings for the first time in ten years at the funeral of my husband's grandma.&nbsp; That day, we put on a cordial face and went about our business.&nbsp; Each sibling, outside of Rob, made it very clear they had no use for us --   Cindy most notable  .&nbsp; We hadn't seen the children in ten years and they were all grown up now.   We are infuriated that they have never apologized, haven't wanted anything to do with us for TEN YEARS, didn't respect our wishes for our wedding, but then they go ahead and send us an invite to Christine's wedding!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;They have made it   damn clear   they could careless about us --after a decade&nbsp;-- and again just four months ago at the funeral!&nbsp;   While Christine is innocent, she has not once shown an interest in getting to know us.&nbsp; She has never tried to contact us -- and we were kind with Christine when we were in her life.   At this point, we want to call his sister up and let her have it.&nbsp; We want to tell her that if she doesn't want to work out the issues between us&nbsp;and prefers to ignore us and not apologize or even talk about it -- then STAY OUT OF OUR LIVES!!&nbsp;   For Pete's sake,&nbsp;it is NASTY&nbsp;to put her daughter in the middle of our problems.&nbsp; We know damn well if we went to&nbsp;the wedding, they'd all treat us as strangers and ignore us and get a kick out of it-- they made that clear at the funeral!   We aren't sure what we are going to do.&nbsp; We are very, very hurt about it all...&nbsp;     How would you feel?       7/29/04 Update    My husband and I decided to write a nice card and send it -- without a check.&nbsp; This is the second gift-giving event we have received from his nieces/nephews over the past three months -- suddenly and out of the blue after 10 years.&nbsp; His siblings saw us at the funeral and so now they want to get gifts I guess!&nbsp;   The first time we heard from them was a  graduation announcement/party invite  for my husband's brother's son.&nbsp; We honored that with a card, note&nbsp;and a monetary gift of $35 -- to never get acknowledgement that it was received or even a thank you.&nbsp; We invited the nephew to get to know us -- and we&nbsp;heard nothing back.&nbsp; So this time, we sent a congratulations card and wrote to Christine and her-to-be-husband&nbsp;that we would love to get to know them and that they&nbsp;are welcome in our home anytime, no check!&nbsp; We hope they come&nbsp;and get to know us, but I am certainly not holding my breath.&nbsp; If they come, I'd be honored to give them a wedding gift.  It finally dawned on me today, we were   only invited to the wedding  .&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is a reception which I am sure there is, we were NOT included in that.&nbsp; That pisses me off royally again because this invite feels like a big&nbsp;  $ $ CHECK&nbsp;REQUEST $ $  &nbsp; instead of something sincere!&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not changing our course of action though.&nbsp; We put the card in the mail early this morning -- even though she is not getting married for another month.&nbsp;&nbsp; We also told her we will " not attend the ceremony due to the fact that the family situation is strained and unresolved."

       urlLink   &nbsp;     Homemade Summer Sausage      I am just discovering how to make homemade cured meats and is it ever fun!&nbsp; Right now, I am marinating a&nbsp;beef&nbsp;brisket in the fridge which will be&nbsp;a  urlLink homemade corned-beef&nbsp; in five days!&nbsp; I also have in my oven as I write this  urlLink homemade summer sausage  which will come out of a warm oven nicely dried out -- sometime after dinner (see photo above taken just a few minutes ago.&nbsp; I think we made homemade meatballs instead LOL, thinner next time, thinner!).&nbsp; Cured meats are SO EASY to make it is unbelievable, and do I mean   SIMPLE  !!&nbsp;   Since the beef is cooked in the summer sausage and I am just waiting for them to dry out now, I can tell you it is   delicious  !!&nbsp; I couldn't help but sample one already -- and my husband gobbled half of one sausage over lunch before I could get it back in the oven to continue drying!&nbsp; Is it ever spicy and delicious (I used the spices for 5 pounds in only 3 pounds), and it is way better than anything you can buy from the store!&nbsp;   You just have to try it for yourselves.    Three years ago, I got quite sick and found out I was allergic to sulfites.&nbsp; Sulfites make me very, very sick and somehow and for some unknown reason my body is unable to metabolize them so when they get in my system, it's like&nbsp;I have a&nbsp;bad flu combined with a hang-over and a body rash.&nbsp;  It isn't pretty. &nbsp;   But thankfully, if I avoid  urlLink foods that contain sulfites  I am fine.&nbsp; Unfortunately, nearly every food on the market today in grocery stores   may   contain sulfites -- and the majority of them do.&nbsp; I have to read labels like crazy to avoid them -- and often times, I can't find a clean product so I have to resort to finding substitutes or making my own product from scratch.&nbsp; I am not the kind person to  live without .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only safe foods for me are pure, natural foods like meat and veggies.  When I first found out I couldn't eat sulfites anymore,&nbsp;I mourned so many foods.&nbsp; I figured I&nbsp;would have to give them up for good.&nbsp; Slowly though in time, I started doing research and I was amazed at how many thing we as people buy - - that we can&nbsp;make at home -- and make soooo sooo much better. For me, I can usually make most anything if I make it from scratch avoiding known additives.  Just this week, I looked into homemade sausages like salami, summer sausage and corn beef.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have never been able to find these foods without sulfites and I haven't been able to eat them now in years.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, now,&nbsp;thankfully that has all changed.&nbsp;   : )  &nbsp; I just had no idea how simple these foods were to make.&nbsp;   Now, even if I didn't have a sulfite problem, I would still make most of these new foods I have discovered from scratch.&nbsp; The taste difference is incredible.&nbsp; In the end, I was almost given&nbsp;a gift.

      The next morning, the group was up early and we managed to get our kayaks and my canoe into the water sometime before 9 a.m.&nbsp; We were going to paddle class I and class II rapids&nbsp;on this day-- which are easy for the someone with my experience, so I had little worry about paddling Dave down the river in my canoe in the event he was a total novice as I suspected.&nbsp;   It didn't take long for me to realize I was going to have to work for the both of us.&nbsp; Dave didn't have a clue how to paddle whitewater and you could see the fear on his face as we got deep into the rapids.&nbsp; Once we got through, you could see his adrenaline pumping.&nbsp; I always said to newcomers, it's like your on a roller coaster with the uncertainly you can and probably will go off the track at any moment.&nbsp; Usually, in&nbsp;response,&nbsp;I got head-shakes as each newcomer tries to absorb the experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;   That was the&nbsp;fun part&nbsp;of being an unofficial whitewater instructor -- taking a newcomer down the river.&nbsp; When someone on the trip couldn't handle the canoe and held up the group too much, we would split up the trouble canoe and&nbsp;I would get to put one of the paddlers in my canoe -- and I would take them down the river  in the front seat .&nbsp; Big guys seemed to think that because they were bigger than me, they would get the back seat.&nbsp; It doesn't work that way.&nbsp; The person in the back is the person who determines the course, and steers the canoe.&nbsp; If you don't know what you are doing, I am not going to let you steer.&nbsp; It's a guarantee for disaster.&nbsp; I don't want to be hanging on some extended tree branch because you were unable to navigate to the other side of the river!   Now granted, if you are a heavy weight in the front, it either means I have to work my butt off to counter-weigh your inappropriate actions to steer us where I think we need to go and not where you are trying to take us, or I need to use my god given voice.&nbsp;&nbsp;Believe me, that is why women were given a voice to counteract brute force!&nbsp;&nbsp; You don't think I'd worked harder,  do ya ?&nbsp; Heck no, I worked  smarter .&nbsp;    "Back paddle, Dave! Back paddle... DRAW !&nbsp;  N O W!!! &nbsp; Fast.&nbsp; Forward stoke, forward stoke..Draw! &nbsp; Good job..."   Poor Dave got humbled that day from lack of experience.&nbsp; I really didn't have much of an option.&nbsp; Learning to run whitewater on a river requires knowledge, skill and talent.   As we went down the river, Dave started to relax a little and got the hang of it better than most people.&nbsp; Every now and then, the group would stop to share tips, suggestions and ideas to help those who were struggling.&nbsp; We'd stop on the river's edge -- which is not easy to do in moving water -- especially for kayaks.&nbsp;&nbsp;whenever we stopped, this one guy kept grabbing my canoe to steady himself.&nbsp; He was smart because my canoe was easy to control in comparison.&nbsp;   This guy who kept hanging on my canoe had a really sweet smile.&nbsp; It was that smile that was contagious, and I'd have to smile back.&nbsp; Dave, of&nbsp;course would smile at him too.&nbsp; We were like smiling goons -- the three of us! The kayak guy looked funny because he was wearing a hotel shower cap.&nbsp; You know those clear ones made of a thin plastic&nbsp;with the string tie on them?&nbsp; Yeap, that is what was on his head.&nbsp; You see since it was September 18th, in Northern Wisconsin, it was very chilly and if we didn't take the right precautions, we faced hypothermia -- hence the funny and cheap shower-cap! Mind you, we were college students on low-budgets.&nbsp;  We couldn't afford high-tech gear  so none of us questioned such silly attire.   As the day continued, this guy in his kayak continued to hang on my canoe-- and I naturally started to wonder who he was.&nbsp; I didn't get the feeling he was flirting at all because there was a woman who was always hanging around him -- and it was obvious I was with a guy who was as new to the group as I was.&nbsp; Dave and I naturally looked like a couple...couple or not.   At the end of the day after we took the kayaks and my canoe&nbsp;out of the water and as we waited to load them up on the trailers, I saw  the smiling face  and approached him.&nbsp; He was standing next to a thin, taller woman about his age, with shoulder length sandy brown hair.&nbsp; It was the&nbsp;girl who followed him so closely&nbsp;on the river. &nbsp;I was sure it was his girlfriend.&nbsp; She stood really close and they both stood there looking at me as I approached.&nbsp;&nbsp; I introduced myself and they did the same.&nbsp; Dave came up beside me to join in the conversation.&nbsp; We started some idle chat, and then I said, "So how long have you two been dating?"&nbsp; June, the woman next to him in her late 20s, kind of looked deflated as she turned to look at him.&nbsp; He piped up, very unexpectedly, and said, "We aren't dating!".&nbsp; June wanted to run away.&nbsp; It was obvious she had a huge crush on him.&nbsp;   It was an awkward moment and I was like hmmm...that's interesting...and then I turned around and went about my business.&nbsp; I didn't expect that.&nbsp; I wasn't checking  the smiling guy  out anyway. I was just trying to converse with strangers.&nbsp; I left June with  her man .   Later that night, I got news from the program director I was going to have to take three students home -- because they hated the experience on the river that day so much they couldn't take it.&nbsp; It was chilly, but   com'on  .   Since I wasn't being paid for the trip, I didn't expect that I would be sent home.&nbsp; The director of the program however didn't want to send his favorite paid&nbsp;guys home, so I was the sacrificial lamb -- and was I mad!&nbsp; Regardless, I didn't have a choice, I had to take the three squalking women, who we had affectionately name "the geese" home early the next day.&nbsp;   Once back at the cottage that day, everyone in the group changed, and geared up for dinner.&nbsp; I guess it was decided that we were going to have spaghetti dinner as a group.&nbsp; Having talked to Dave about the plans and being very frustrated, we headed into the kitchen to eat.&nbsp; It was so dirty, old and creepy in that kitchen-- and I was in a bad mood.&nbsp; Dave and I sat down -- and being so pissy, I saw that  smiling guy  and thought I could use a dose of happiness -- so very uncharacteristic to me, I got up and quietly left poor Dave and moved two seats down to the empty seat besides "the guy".&nbsp; Normally, I couldn't have left poor, sweet Dave and I have no clue why I did it that night.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe I was tired of my shadow Dave.&nbsp; He was sweet and nice, but too quiet for me.&nbsp; I can only guess at the reasons why today...   Unusual for me, I put on a smile and started to chat with "the guy" as I sat down next to him and&nbsp;June.&nbsp; We had a nice, fun conversation.&nbsp; We both realized we loved garlic, and we were both studying for our master's degree.&nbsp; When we chatted, I didn't get the feeling like either of us were looking for someone. We weren't flirting or out to meet someone.&nbsp; It was just a natural conversation between two college students.   After dinner I got up, packed my things and prepared to turn in early.&nbsp; Before I went to sleep, I went and sat on the outskirts of the group as they frolicked and had fun.&nbsp; I was bitter that I had to go.&nbsp; I so wanted to paddle  one more day ...and I felt like a victim of discrimination!&nbsp; I sat in the corner, mad and pouting.&nbsp; Then I thought about "the guy", got up, wrote my number down and put it in my pocket.&nbsp; I thought maybe I should give him my number.   To this day, I don't know why I did that.&nbsp; It wasn't like I was attracted to him.&nbsp; I wasn't particularly interested in him anymore than I was Dave except "the guy" and I shared an interest in whitewater which was a HUGE passion of mine --and he enjoyed&nbsp;some nice conversation -- whereas&nbsp;Dave was too quiet .&nbsp;&nbsp; I think at the time, I thought he might be an interesting   friend  .&nbsp;   So after I wrote the number down, I contemplated if I should give it to him.&nbsp; I was sitting in the far corner of the room away from everyone -- pouting -- when out of the blue, he came up beside me, chatted a few minutes, commiserated about the fact that I had to go home unfairly -- and then within a few minutes of sitting down and realizing I wasn't dating Dave, he said,  "Can I have your number?"     &nbsp;  Like a total fool, I was said, "Why of course.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, I have it written down in my pocket!"&nbsp;   Oh. my. god.&nbsp; What am I a total dork?&nbsp; After I gave him my number, I was like he must think I am nuts to carry it around in my pocket.&nbsp; What a riot!&nbsp; Shortly thereafter, I retreated to bed and didn't see "the guy" again.&nbsp; I kind of felt like a fool after what I had done.   The next morning, Dave, I and the three geese departed just after dawn before anyone else was up.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the ride home, Dave asked me about "the guy".&nbsp; He asked me if I was going to see him again, and I told him I had no clue.&nbsp; I wasn't too concerned about it and tried to convey that to Dave.&nbsp; I tried to change the subject because I didn't think there was much to talk about.&nbsp; He asked if we exchanged numbers and I honestly told him that we had but again I tried to convey to Dave there was nothing going on.&nbsp;   I thought Dave was over-reacting!   Then he made the   strangest   comment.&nbsp; Mind you "the guy" and I only talked a total of maybe 20 minutes over one day -- so when Dave said to me on the drive home as he sat in the front seat of the van,   "You are going to marry this guy!"  &nbsp; I thought he was nuts, absolutely insane -- if not altogether mad!   At that moment, I wrote Dave off as a crazy nutcase.&nbsp; Unknown to me, he was quite   foretelling  !

      This October, my husband and I will be married for ten years.&nbsp;  I just can't believe it!&nbsp; T E N&nbsp; years!!&nbsp; W here did all the time go?&nbsp; It's been an amazing time in my life.&nbsp; I&nbsp;am blessed with a lovely marriage.  &nbsp;  My husband and I met in college while we were both studying for master's degrees.&nbsp; We met in what seemed like an act of fate though I was never a believer of such events.&nbsp;&nbsp; That September, I was actively involved in running whitewater canoe trips with the local community college -- and so when I returned to the university for another year, I sought out a few more opportunities to get on the water before the season came to an end.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I was passionate about whitewater canoeing and I earned the nickname "River Rat" over the previous&nbsp;few seasons.&nbsp; I was a solo whitewater canoer by choice, but I would happy take a beginner down the river with me in a tandum canoe, if it was my only chance to get on the water.&nbsp; I just had to be on the water.&nbsp; I was single, and sick of dating -- so I focused on enjoying myself and my life --  and I did just that .&nbsp;&nbsp; It was during this time, I found&nbsp;myself.  &nbsp;  It didn't take long for me to get a chance to get back on the river that Fall&nbsp;-- and so I took my first opportunity.&nbsp; I had convinced the director of the&nbsp;Outdoor Adventure program at the&nbsp;university&nbsp;to let me load a tandum whitewater canoe on the Kayak classes trailer so I could follow the class up to Northern Wisconsin for one more weekend on the water.&nbsp; You see, the kayak class was going up&nbsp;north to try out their newly&nbsp;acquired skills on real whitewater.&nbsp; So as soon as I got the permission to go as a helper,&nbsp;I quickly found the first available partner to join me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The partner I found was&nbsp;Dave.&nbsp; Dave was a junior, still living in the high rise dorms, and he had a huge  puppy-love-like-crush  on me.&nbsp; He was a really cute guy, handsome and tall, if only slightly chubby.&nbsp; He had a baby face, blue eyes and sandy brown straight hair.&nbsp; He was so innocent looking -- like a boy who had just become a man -- though he was obviously just shy of being 21.  &nbsp;  Sadly, the chemistry wasn't there for me, but I was more than happy to have his paddling companionship.&nbsp; My roommate affectionately called Dave,  Virgin Dave , as he had  that  presence about him -- and then when my future-husband came into the picture shortly thereafter, he was affectionately re-named by my roommate as&nbsp;"Virginia Davis" whenever he called to confuse anyone who might read my messages.&nbsp; I thought that was the funniest thing!&nbsp; Poor Dave, he didn't want to accept that I&nbsp;didn't have feelings for&nbsp;him -- even after I told him so.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Anyway, Dave came along on the trip with me -- and after&nbsp;a long&nbsp;drive to Northern Wisconsin, we arrived at the&nbsp;river cottages where the&nbsp;kayak class was going to&nbsp;staying.&nbsp;&nbsp; In my van, we carried&nbsp;half of the students.&nbsp; Upon arrival,&nbsp;&nbsp;Dave, myself, the outdoor program director and a trip leader all claimed a room for the night.&nbsp; We were an awkward group with little bonds between us because none of us had attended the multi-week kayak training class which was held in the university pool.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The accommodations left much to be desired, so we all just put our sleeping bags atop the mattress out of pure fear of what might lurk below and we went to sleep.&nbsp; Dave, of course, was&nbsp;sleeping next to me, in his own sleeping bag.&nbsp; At about 1 a.m., the second van arrived -- and a very rude guy came barging into our room.&nbsp; He turned on the light and started looking for his stuff.&nbsp; We all were woke-up by his stressed questions, "Has anyone seen my bag?&nbsp; It's a duffle bag....&nbsp; Someone was supposed to have packed it in the van today, but obviously forgot!&nbsp; This is what it looks like..."&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I couldn't believe&nbsp;just how rude this guy was!&nbsp; I forced my eyes open and looked at him. I think the words,  what a jerk , were going through my mind!&nbsp; When my eyes registered what I was seeing, it was like I was&nbsp;seeing  Svengali&nbsp; before me (like that guy in the 70's childhood show!).&nbsp;&nbsp;He had&nbsp;dark, dark Mediterranean hair that was shoulder length and&nbsp;full of curls .&nbsp; As he paced in our room, full of anger, we quickly assured this rude-mannered guy to go -  we didn't have his bags!!&nbsp;&nbsp;  I couldn't help but sigh when he left.&nbsp; I remember thinking I certainly didn't want to get to know him!!  &nbsp;  This rude guy is now my husband.  &nbsp;    To be continued...  &nbsp;&nbsp;

        urlLink        &nbsp;   It was a gorgeous day today&nbsp;by all standards for those who love the sun,&nbsp;boating and the water, and the crowds that came testified to it.&nbsp; You could feel the rawness, the pure desire in the open air to get wet, splash and have fun.&nbsp; In that respect, we are all the same.&nbsp; We each desire to  feel  summer, and we felt it today.&nbsp; It was a beautiful day, yet a day with a mystery.   &nbsp;  Amidst the joys and the fun, there was a surreal and strange experience that four adults witnessed which none can explain.&nbsp; After anchoring the boat for over an hour, and after a good&nbsp;swim,&nbsp;&nbsp;as we all sat in the rear of the boat, a strange and&nbsp;furious   fizzing   started beneath the boat.  &nbsp;  Chills ran down my spine as we all sprinted on to our feet to see if we sprung a leak!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  "It must be a leak...oh my&nbsp;god,"&nbsp; I said in a panicky voice as I ran around looking for it.&nbsp; Sure enough, and yet strangely,&nbsp;tiny little bubbles like you'd see in glass of&nbsp;Alka-seltzer&nbsp;came up from both&nbsp;sides of our seven foot&nbsp;wide boat!&nbsp; Both sides!&nbsp; And the noise was fairly loud --&nbsp;loud enough to&nbsp;rattle your nerves.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  T, hurry, pull the anchor...get&nbsp;to shore!&nbsp; Quickly...before we sink.  &nbsp;  You could see my mom's face run white with fear!&nbsp;  Go to my dock she said. &nbsp;&nbsp;Wide eyed, I sternly&nbsp;instilled&nbsp;some logic -- if we are going to sink -- we aren't going to dock on your pier and sink -- we are going for the boat lift and fast!&nbsp; T, hurry!!!  &nbsp;  T remained amazingly calm and I couldn't ignite a fire under his butt to save my soul.&nbsp;I couldn't say&nbsp;'go' fast enough! &nbsp;If we were going to sink, he was going to go down calmly.&nbsp; He suggested that maybe it was weeds.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  What weeds?&nbsp; Weeds&nbsp;on    Alka-selter    --&nbsp;weeds on a&nbsp;fifty pound dose?&nbsp;   C'mon!    &nbsp;  I was getting weak kneed and then it stopped.&nbsp; It stopped when two of us were in the bow of the boat.&nbsp; We sighed a moment of relief.&nbsp; We are okay.&nbsp; Maybe it is a leak higher up...&nbsp; Yeah that's it we all thought.  &nbsp;  T managed to get the anchor up in slow motion, and managed to snap the anchor back into it's housing -- and slowly started the boat and started moving --&nbsp;and as we&nbsp;started driving&nbsp;-- it started  AGAIN .&nbsp; Oh my god, what the hell! You could hear it over the sound of engine...&nbsp;it&nbsp;was that loud and powerful -- like a fifty&nbsp;pound or hundred pound of effervescence coming up off the lake bed.  &nbsp;  Within a few minutes, we were safely on shore.&nbsp; T lifted the boat out of the water and we all stood and stared underneath looking for a hole -- for&nbsp;water to drain -- and nothing came.&nbsp; We ran the bilge&nbsp;pump, we opened up the&nbsp;hull -- and there was NOTHING there.&nbsp; Absolutely nothing.&nbsp; Then we lowered the boat back into the water -- and all four of us&nbsp;gingerly got in and reclaimed our original pre-mystery positions -- and nada.&nbsp; We sat stumped.  &nbsp;  We continued to inspect the boat and then after&nbsp;20 minutes of waiting and sitting, we took her back out for a test drive -- and&nbsp;that was it.&nbsp; It&nbsp;didn't happen again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So now today, as the gray storm clouds build on the horizon blocking the copper sun that was setting, I sit and&nbsp;wonder what occurred.&nbsp; What caused this weird situation...&nbsp;

         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm back   to eating low carb for a while because I have topped off at my high weight again, gulp of 159 -- and I don't like it! When I severely limit my sodas, homemade lemonade, tea, cookies, popcorn and chips -- and stop eating bread, potatoes and rice -- logically I loose weight. I am cutting a lot of calories. However, I usually don't spare on the fat. I love eating high-fat foods and prefer the low-carb method of eating to any other when it comes to loosing weight.&nbsp;     &nbsp;       When I was a teenager, my mom always swore that I could loose weight if I ate a salad and roast beef for lunch everyday. She was on to something twenty years ago already -- too bad she didn't become famous.   If you noticed, I didn't say that I am going on the Atkins diet. While the late Dr. Atkins has really promoted and touted low-carb, I don't believe in restricting veggies, and eating fake sugar. That just doesn't appeal to me as healthy, I'm sorry. I guess if I were 100 pounds over weight, I might look at it differently -- but because I am within 10 -15 pounds of normal -- I choose to go less stringently because I can. Just sadly, I don't ever shed more than 5 pounds before slowly resorting to my old eating habits.     I am a firm believer that we all have a genetic weight that our bodies work to maintain -- and while we can effect it somewhat, we cannot make a twiggy fat or a fatman a twiggy -- without going through extremes -- and I am not a person of extremes -- at least when it comes to physical exersion. Give me mental challenges anyday...   &nbsp;    P.S.&nbsp; I took the photo above (as all photos in my blog).&nbsp; I found "yellow raspberries" growing wild in our yard.&nbsp; With all the rain we got, they grew like mad -- and now I am making these into blackberry liquor.&nbsp; I think they should call yellow raspberries "champagne raspberries" personally.&nbsp; Aren't they beautiful?

      Yep,  I have them.   I have bushes that have grown over the property line and my neighbor thinks I am  violating her space  and is she ever mad!  Mind you she has several oak trees that TOWER over my home -- but obviously those aren't trespassing.     urlLink       Early last Summer, she tried to peer through my wild woods and forcefully guilt my husband into trimming everything that hangs over our fence line on her side of the property.   I couldn't believe my ears!  She said in a nasty and vicious voice,  "Your bushes are all growing over onto my property!  You need to cut all of them back and clean it all up! I shouldn't have too!!  This is YOUR MESS! If you don't, I am going to hire a service to do it and bill you!"     I couldn't help but laugh!   Since she is a vicious old hag and has been nothing but evil since we bought her previous home (which was sold on all lies), we of course flat ignored her.  If she was a kind-heart and good soul, I'd be more than happy to make things pleasing for the both of us, but since this woman is psycho, I could give a damn about what  she  wants.    She is so psycho  , that she has since cut everything back every year six inches into my side of the fence and has crammed all the clippings, cuttings and limbs back  into my  live  bushes  -- with the hopes of  killing  them.  She has even resorted to cutting back evergreen trees that bordered the property to the point they now look lop-sided and sick.   Technically, she is trespassing!  I could get her written up for such a violation but she is too insane to deal with.  While she is nearing 80, she has the mentally of a child.  She escalates everything even though she is the one in the wrong.  In her mind, she is convinced I am truly violating her space though the law says differently.  The law says she has the right to prune on her side of the fence, and I told her so -- but she doesn't have the right to throw it back at me!    Don't worry though, I have put her in her place dozens of times since buying her home -- and if she steps out of line far enough, I will clop her again.    So I have to ask, what would  YOU  do in this situation?

       urlLink     First off, you have to laugh at the tickets I got at my local, small town theatre. They don't quite know how to spell  Fahrenheit . Did you notice? What is even funnier is that this town's demographics say that 44% of the people are of German decent.   Friday night for dinner, I happened to have my parents over for a rib feast. It was during our outdoor dining that my father said he noticed Michael Moore's movie playing downtown. We were all shocked -- you mean Ruralville is playing this controversial movie? Mind you, this is Republican Ruralville. We were all so thrilled as a family, we decided to go and support not only the local theatre but Michael Moore!   As we drove to the theatre, we each recollected the last time we saw a movie out. For my parents, they don't recall for sure, but I think it was when I was like ten or so. We saw some Disney movie where a dog got hurt by a bear -- and I cried and demanded we go home LOL! It's been at least twenty years since my parents stepped into a movie theatre.   For my husband and I, it has been about five years -- whenever  Castaway  with Tom Hanks came out. We ventured out for the first time in our small town to see a movie -- and was I ever disappointed. I swore off seeing another movie again. I am not much for Hollywood drama, sex, violence and effects.  I'm a total,  boring  realist!  Give me sustenance,  pahlease  -- and so came this documentary.   I don't know where to start about this documentary. I had many preconceived notions about this movie and I knew it would be depressing as I already see a lot of flaws in our system since the Bush administration took office. I knew this movie wouldn't  move me  to change positions or take a new stance, but I didn't expect it to  impact me as hard as it did . I did expect to get mad at all the lies, but I didn't expect to get  so upset .   The messages sent by Michael Moore were way darker than I ever anticipated. The extent of corruption, the amount of greed -- and how people's lives are being thrown away without so much as a blink of an eye made me want to throw up.  I felt really dismal.  I felt very gloomy, and almost erie...like I did after 9-11. I felt like the safe world which I know is not safe - was even worse than I ever imagined!   When you learn how the Bush family is so connected to the Saudi's, you can't get over the whole connection of it all. It is so deep, vast and unbelieveable. You see the power of money -- and how it corrupts. While I am not religious, I grew more confident that there couldn't be a God to let things get  this  ugly.   I have also lost complete trust in the media. I knew they weren't totally trustworthy, but I didn't realize to what extent we were being boonswaggled. It's disgusting, if you ask me.   I am not going to go on about my feelings. I think no matter which side of the fence you are on -- you need to go see this movie. You need to go and make your OWN opinion. For it is the wise, who gather information, and take their own stance based on research. This is a great research project to help you formulate an opinion -- any opinion -- just go and see it.    And if you swear off the movie, at least read this.    urlLink Factual Back-Up For Fahrenheit 9/11     You have a mind, don't waste it!        &nbsp;   Side Note: &nbsp;  The audience, outside of my family,&nbsp;was comprised of one couple (man and a woman), two women and a group of three other women.&nbsp; That's all, folks!

       urlLink      Last night I was awoke by my dogs alerting me that someone was nearby the house.  I wasn't too alarmed as often times it is our nearest neighbor's son coming and going.  However, this time there was more than the normal racket.  When I looked up at the clock, it was 12:23 a.m.  I got up out of curiosity and went to the window to spy on the happenings.  I saw a man who appeared short in stature with a baseball cap standing at my neighbors front door.  He stood on the stoop with black carry-on luggage, handle extended, and acted as if he had rung the doorbell. I thought it was interesting and wondered if the widow had invited some guests in from out of town who arrived  very late .  My neighbor did have on all her lights to welcome them.  I didn't think anything of it at that point and went back to bed.  I tried to quiet my barking dogs.  As I laid in bed and listened, I heard the front door open and close, I heard some footsteps and some idle unrecognizable chatter.  I turned over to get comfortable and tried to fall back asleep though I kept one ear in queue.  Then, as my husband started to lightly snore, I heard one of the guests run from the porch area towards the street.  He shouted, "Joe!".  I followed the sounds with my ears, and painted a picture in my mind's eye.  It must be one of the guests calling for another up at the road to bring something.  Maybe they left something in the car.  The guy then ran up the driveway and called again, "Joe!"  Hmmm, I thought.  Maybe something happened to Joe.  I wonder if he fell or is missing...  My interest piqued even more...  He ran and called a third time.    Weird.    He ran again, stopped and called "Doe....reeeen" -- which is my widow neighbor's name! What is she doing out on the street at nearly 80 years old -- after midnight. This is interesting! How odd...    The guy continues to run a few steps, stop and call out.  "Doe..."   Maybe I heard that wrong.  Maybe he is saying  Joe !    I laid in bed and continued to listen. The guy continued down our street saying "Doe" about every two minutes.  He said it in a weird voice.  A voice that was just strangely calling out a name, open-ended as if he almost expected a voice to answer right back, next to him.  I don't know if I can explain it. It certainly didn't sound like a guy looking for someone, or someone who was worried they lost a dog.  It was an odd calling out.  Occasionally, he would add in the ".........reeen".  It was erie hearing this voice in the still of the night, wandering around, calling out.  It was haunting to say the least.    Then the shouting stopped.  It was silent for about five minutes...and then it started again.  This time he was near the lake, and his voice echoed across it.  He was off the road and had traversed some 200 feet to the lake.  He started up again.   Doe....reeeeeen.   Now he was walking in people's backyards.  I wonder if anyone else hears him...  I got goose bumps all over.  In between a few shouts, I peered over to the neighbors and by this time, my husband was up even more curious then me.  If he is interested, I thought it must be creepy!! He agreed the guy was saying my neighbor's name.  He also agreed this was really strange!   My husband thought he saw the widow's daughter when he looked out the window at their house.  That would be odd as all her kids are out of the house now.  Why would she come home after midnight to visit?  That didn't add up.  The son did stay at his mom's house on the weekends occasionally so that would add up -- but her too?  I started to wondered if the widow's daughter came home for some reason with her man, and this guy shouting out  was him !!   Maybe he was having a mental breakdown, flipped his lid, was high on drugs -- or god knows what.  You must know, my neighbors are nutcases.  We don't have a speaking relationship.  By this point, I was in an erie place -- and I was concerned about this stranger in the night.   Was this guy hallucinating on drugs??   Oddly, the neighbors had turned off all their lights outside, paced around in the kitchen and then turned them on, went to the garage and then retreated again -- turning off all their outdoor lights again.    I thought  what the heck?   Are they ignoring their insane guest?  Do they not want to help him?  Are they embarrassed -- I mean for Pete sake if the guy needs help -- HELP HIM!  But you know what, I wasn't about to set foot out that door -- in the dark night -- with a stranger hallucinating.  I just hoped that he didn't fall in the water and drown.  The shouting continued very intermittently, every twenty minutes or so he'd yell once and then quit before I finally started to doze off.  At this point, he was on the other side of our house -- further down -- near the lake -- in people's backyards again -- or so it sounded. He hadn't yelled as he passed our house somewhere in the meantime.  I was creeped out that if this guy was on drugs, he could break in -- into my neighbor's old house -- which is where we lived now!!  If the guy flipped, he might forget she built a new house and moved next door -- and might try to come in here!  Youser!!!  My husband paced around and peered out the windows for some time...  It takes a lot to get him up and wondering.  He finally retreated to bed at 1:30.  As I let the thoughts fall out of my head, I tried to soothe myself that maybe the timing was a coincidence.  I wondered if maybe my neighbor's son came home at the same time this guy was just wondering around the lake calling for someone....someone named Joe, and I misunderstood the whole thing!!  Maybe my husband mistook the widow for her daughter.  I can only hope.  It has been quiet here this morning and there are no signs of guests at my neighbors house -- other than her son.    UPDATE:   I was in the yard pulling weeds when I saw the widow's daughter's man (whose name I don't know) -- the one I suspected could have been the guy called out "Doe....reeeen" all night.  He was sitting in the yard all alone looking pretty forelorn.  He is probably in his late 30s to early 40s.  He was sitting there when the neighbor encouraged the widow's son to offer him a drink of water or ice.   I'm like, what???   My ears bent over!!   Was it him??   Then the neighbors who still had some people over from the night before said, "We didn't need any entertainment last night.   You were the best entertainment we could get ..."  I'm not insane!!  He was wacked out -- or they joked with him because he was drunk and really played a good one on him.  Seeing him sitting there today, my heart when out to him.  It's not fun to have regrets LOL.  He has always seemed like a nice guy...Odd one, huh?

      Is it   only   where we live -- or are you too having the worst weather this summer?  I think this has got to be the worst summer weather-wise for as far back as I can remember.  In May, we got over 12 inches of rain -- and it hasn't managed to stay dry for more than three or four days in a row  yet .    When we do get the sun, we seem to be getting arctic blasts with temperatures hovering in the sixties for the daytime high (which is normally cooler than our average low!).  We can't seem to manage sun and warm together.  It's just not in the cards where I live.  The weathermen on the news were touting that Friday, Saturday and Sunday were going to be HOT, and HUMID with temps in the nineties -- but here it is Friday and I just went and put on my winter sweats and socks because I am  tired  of freezing in my shorts.    When we woke-up this morning, it hinted that we might have a nice day, but it didn't take long for the clouds to come rolling in.  And then before you knew it, the rain came.  It drenched, and poured -- soaking everything.  And now?  Now it is cold, damp and chilly with gray clouds abound.  I dream of baking in the sun, turning golden brown, and riding the jet ski in the  searing  hot heat.  I want to feel the warm water spray on my body.  I want to lie on the boat and get good and hot -- and then I want to swim in the cool lake for hours -- soothing my soul.   I want to be outside when the sun sets, I want to hear the sounds of summer... I want it to be summer!   Instead, I am locked up in the house as if it were winter -- looking at a dreary white lake -- hoping and wishing it were sky blue.

       urlLink      Just as dusk fell, a huge dark black cloud shrouded the sky with an imminent warning that rain was about to come crashing down.  There was no thunder nor lightening -- not even a dribble to warn you to run.  When it started, it drenched any poor soul who dared not heed the call.

       urlLink      Lordy, you know when your hair stands up on the back of your neck and you just don't feel right?  Well, I went out to mow the lawn.  Everything was status quo -- down to the hot humid weather. The only thing that was different than usual was a landscape crew of two working on my elderly neighbor's property.  As I started to mow by the road, I admired the changes they were making next door.  The landscape crew had added some landscape timbers and it looked like flowers were going to planted.  It was really nice.   I continued mowing -- and then as I turned, one of the two landscape guys stood about 4 feet before me watching me -- on the neighbors driveway. I figured he was just taking a breather in my general direction.  Nothing wrong with that. I didn't think anything of it.  I just smiled and said, "hi".    I went about my mowing.  Then I started thinking about this guy who I just said hello to.  I am not sure if he said hi back or not, but he had opened his mouth and I saw he only had  one tooth . He was a scruffy looking, short man with longer than average gray hair.  He had that wiry kind of hair old people get that doesn't stay in place anymore.  He had on shorts and looked like he might grunt at you rather than talk.  He didn't look particularly friendly.  As I pulled the mower backwards, I thought why wouldn't someone get missing teeth fixed?  I mean really -- it doesn't look good -- and being toothless isn't a positive experience overall.  Obviously, he is employed so he should have the money -- or so you'd think.  Right? Well, I told myself, he may have a family to support and other financial burdens.   Don't judge the guy.   In the end it doesn't matter, but I am sure it must put some people off.   Doesn't he realize this?   Next thing I look and this guy is practically peering through the white pine to stare at me.  He was carrying his tools and putting them in his truck, but this time he passed his truck and was starting to get  too close . There was nothing left between us but a white pine branch and a few tall weeds!! I got so surprised and freaked by it, I stopped my mower and said,  "Can I help you?"    I pictured this man grabbing me and putting ME into his truck!  The man, who is in great physical shape and who is in his late 50s or 60s just flat ignored me -- as if he didn't hear me.  I can't imagine he didn't hear me being only eight feet apart at this point and starring right at me. It was dead quiet when I stopped the mower.  Instead, he slowly turned, bent over and picked up a gas can, put it in his truck and continued across the yard to load things.  Okay, I started thinking, maybe it is just me.  Maybe he is fine and  I am all crazy .  I kept on mowing.  I was thinking, okay,  whatever !  Then he came back again and starred  intently .  I was getting knots in my stomach.  I then decided to consciously change my mowing pattern. Instead of putting my back to him, I was going to mow towards him, walk backwards and mow towards him. Then I'll feel better.  I wasn't going to take my eyes of HIM but it wouldn't be as obvious because I had to look that way to mow!  The new pattern I had adopted made sense to anyone who was watching.  It almost made better sense then how I typically mow...  Anyway, this guy continued to load his truck and each time he came back-- he couldn't keep his frick'n eyes off me.  It wasn't a nice eye of admiration for someone in a pair of old faded, nearly white jean short-shorts with a full bust -- it was a  sickening stare .  It was the kind of stare you get when someone is thinking of putting you in their trunk, or truck and doing god knows what with you. I started thinking about the woman that was found dead in a state park not far from here two days or so ago.  I got so creeped out that I couldn't help but stop mowing, close the garage and retreat to the house!   I am just not up for a guy standing within 10 feet of me stare like that --  it was beyond normal . My instincts were blaring at me -- screaming and yelling that this guy wasn't right!! I can appreciate a kind admirable look -- there is nothing wrong with that, but when you are a sexual pervert -- and god knows what else -- I am not going to stand there and arouse you.  So sorry!  I went down and interrupted my husband who was working and he came up and got the mail as I finished. I wanted to retrieve the mower and test this guy. The guy was still there but this time he didn't lift an eyebrow at me.  He didn't even turn his face in my general direction -- and I paraded up and down the driveway with the mower running so I could blow off the grass blades - and he didn't even turn once.    The mind is a powerful organ -- no doubt --and it can elude you, scare you -- and give you warning.  But I believe when your gut intuition tells you something, it is imperative to listen to it-- and I did just that. I feel better now.

       urlLink    Home Sweet Home  Seven years ago, I lived outside of one of the larger cities in the U.S.  I had been there since I was five years old, and the cement world that surrounded me for years was wearing  thin .  I was so tired of false pretenses, arrogance, keeping-up-with-the-Jones-attitudes, high crime, selfishness, etc -- and everything else that comes with a plastic society -- I decided to make a break from it.  I researched long and hard where I wanted to go -- and finally settled on fulfilling a dream I had entertained for many years of my life.   I decided to move on a lake.  I wanted to bring the resort to me -- instead of always having to go to the resort!  You know?   Why not!   Of course, it wasn't an easy thing to do.  As you know, resorts do not often fall in high employment areas.  No, instead they often fall in low-income areas where work for the educated family is hard to find.  My first goal before the move, of course, was to secure employment for my husband (I myself telecommuted as a consultant so I wasn't worried.  I could work anywhere).  I put on my thinking cap and worked hard to find a back door to a good company. Mind you good companies here are far and few between!  It took several months, but between my husband and I (mostly me acting as him in letters and e-mail -- as he was too busy), we managed to get him into a prestigious international medical company -- where he would continue to earn a good living.  Luckily for the both of us, they loved him on the first interview and he got hired which is not easy to do with a company like this.  It's very competitive.  Unfortunately, he had to drive an hour to work -- but he said that was a price he was willing to pay.  In the end, I almost abandoned the dream on that hour -- but he convinced me otherwise.  I still wish he didn't have to drive.  I do hate that part!    We then found a house after negotiating the job.  Finding a house we could afford that had even half-potential took a lot of time!  Lake homes are either perfect and for the rich, or they are very run down and need to be fixed up.   We got one of the latter ones!   We were kind of star struck for years after moving.  We couldn't believe how grand it was --it was way more grand than we ever anticipated.  We didn't realize the incredibleness of living on lake:  the foggy fall mornings, the starlit nights, the beauty of the boats passing by day and night, all the beautiful creatures who shared our backyard, the peace and quiet of having a private park, the excitement and ease of jumping on a boat at whim!  It was a treat, a real treat that I don't believe we have gotten used to yet.  It has become normal now, but we certainly don't take it for granted. I think we are resolved to die here - it is that beautiful.  We can't imagine life anywhere else now.  With all the good however, there has been some unexpected bad.  I had this dumb illusion that in the country, life would be kind and nice -- like on TV-- ha!  I thought I'd find Aunt Bee next door and I couldn't have been  further from the truth .   Next time you move into a neighborhood where you are 50 years younger than your neighbor -- watch out!!  They won't take kindly to your young and  independent thinking .  Instead the click-of-old-farts will  try  to squash you with brut force (don't worry they didn't succeed!).  Furthermore, I didn't realize how  bad  small town corruption could be.  Whew!  Police protection -- don't question it -- or you'll be alone -- and furthermore, the term  rednecks  has really taken on new meaning.    I joke with my family that we traded in arrogance for pure IGNORANCE!  And boy, did we.   We simplified our lives -- just as we wanted to do -- and overall I love it, we love it. We love our life.  It's like we went back to 1970 in that small town that many of us grew up in -- before it was overtaken by the city.  We don't have rush hour traffic, we don't smell car exhaust everywhere, we don't hear the highway, children can safely play outside, it is so quiet outside the wind chime is the loudest racket you will hear!  That part is pure heaven!  Being liberal minded, however, I don't blend well with this small community. Add to that that I grew up in a world-class city where I was exposed to world-class food, culture, arts and entertainment - I am a down-right foreigner here. I never anticipated being so isolated in such a wonderful place.  I didn't foresee that at all.  The people who live here have  always lived here .  They are born, raised and die here for the most part -- and most of them have never even left the state. They practically live in a time warp!  Can you imagine?   I'm not joking!  Here, they graduate from high school, marry shortly thereafter, have kids and work for the rest of their lives in factories.  By the time they are my age, they have grown kids -- and a very different lifestyle from me.  They are very Republican, devout Christians.  It makes it hard to find common ground -- let me tell you.  I've tried.  They flat out reject me! I'm too much of a culture shock because I like black people, support gays, eat something they've never heard of called "cilantro" which they just started selling at the local grocery, and I know what honour killings are!  I don't say that light-hearted.  That has been my real experiences here!!  Don't ever suggest that you want to eat at a hip restaurant in the resort town itself -- or they run screaming, "It's way too expensive."  The true interpretation:  "The food is too weird for us!"  Furthermore, it's not like there are people all over.  They are few and far between. In a resort area, much of the real estate is seasonally occupied -- and the seasonal visitors don't have time for making friends -- they want fun and they want it now!  They don't want to kabitz with you.  Who are you anyway -- a redneck?   I have reached out over the years to find a photography club, a cooking club, a writing club, a dog-lovers club -- and there is absolutely NOTHING out there.  Nothing nadda -- only the Jaycees which couldn't be any more opposite than myself! I took a morning yoga class a year ago now -- and quit that.  Why?  Well, lets just say I was youngest again by over 30 years.  It was me and 4 grandmas!    Meetup.com has nothing in my neighborhood -- no, I'd have to drive an hour to meet up with people -- which doesn't foster a good friendship.  People don't like the drive.  I know that because my old friends from my city neighborhood have stopped making the drive over the years as I have too -- the distance doesn't build good friendships -- nor do lake homes.  Evny dampens that -- painfully so.  So, here I sit, seven years into my dream -- and I love 90% of it.  I don't have any regrets.  I just don't know how to make some good quality friendships.  I have exhausted myself trying, have resolved myself to the inevitable, but sometimes, somehow, the wish -- the wish I feel I have no control over -- peeks up it's head and drives deep into my soul -- searching for a way, thinking, wondering -- just how can I meet someone.  There has got to be a way... I just can't figure out how!

       urlLink       Yesterday, I was mowing the lawn. You can guess who was at it again,  can't you?   I swear this person can't quit.  It's almost funny how   mental   she is...  It's like she is addicted to being vicious.    Poor soul.     When I approached the mailbox to mow beside it, I see my rugosa rose, which surrounds my mailbox and provides endless bloom, is all hacked up.  A big chunck is missing right in the front part -- on the street-- and under the mailbox -- and signature to my neighbor's behavior -- all the limbs are stuffed angrily back inside the bush, dying.    Sick of her crazy behavior and not knowing where it will end as we haven't bothered her whatsoever, my husband and I decide again, we have no choice but to put it on record.  What a waste of tax dollars, but what other option do we have?  More funny is we do have security equipment which I shall not discuss hooked up and the old bitty does her dirty deeds just beyond its view.  What she doesn't know is we have some covert equipment coming!  I CAN'T WAIT to install it!!  Maybe it will arrive today...  Anyway, the cop comes, writes up the complaint and goes to talk to her.  She has company in from out of town (a great alibi), perhaps old family or something -- and when the cop comes this time, she invites him in to do her "Call my friend the Police Chief" crap so I don't hear anything that goes on.    However, when the cop emerges and comes back to talk to me, he tells me that she is selling her house!!!!   Can you believe it?   I don't see a sign so I am not going to believe it until the deal is done -- until the house is in the hands of the new owners -- but the news is quite promising (Hallelujah choir singing in the background).  One can only hope.  I was so ecstatic, I asked the officer if I could hug him and he quickly backed off  -- away from my jubilant glee for obvious reasons which weren't in my mind at the moment.  Sorry officer!  What is funny is I suspect she killed my raspberries with her weed killer because she thought it looked ugly hanging on the fence -- when she is going to be selling her house!  But what the  idiot  didn't realize was that the dead canes look a hell-of-a-lot worse. Ha!    Hell if I am going to remove them!!  I think that is what pissed her off this time.  She thought I would clean up those dead canes and I'll be damned if I'll do that -- so in her rage -- she hacked my rose -- which doesn't even touch her property.  In her ignorant mind, I guess she thought it wouldn't look like her.  Hmmm...yeah, right!  Her yard looks like a toxic beast right now regardless of my dead raspberries! And if she wants the half million dollars she's asking -- she'd better clean it up!     Too bad she can't clean up my side!!!!

       urlLink      Photo by Fredette   I recently checked my e-mail and in popped a notification from BankOne.  The e-mail is notifying me that I won't be able to access my account on August 7th and 8th.    What????  I don't have an account from BankOne so I look much more closely at it.   Low and behold, it is my  e-mail  address -- clear as can be -- with a name very similar to mine.  The last name was just shortened (missing a few letters), the middle initial was my middle initial - but the first name was  Edward .  I'm certainly not  Edward .    Oh. My. God!    Is someone messing with me?  Have they taken my identity?  Are they opening up accounts and putting my e-mail address in them with a pseudo name -- just trying to cause me problems.   Wholly shit!   If they are using my e-mail -- which is REALLY STRANGE -- are they using my address or some PO box?    The more I thought, I thought this guy must be a dummy.  What -- does he WANT TO GET CAUGHT?  Hey, if this is ID theft maybe I'll get the joy of catching the dumb bastard because he is using my e-mail.    Hello!    I like catching evil people : )    I immediately pick-up the phone to call BankOne and as I did I thought about all of my enemies.  Okay, I could think of two people who might want to do this to me.  My brother's wife who still can't get over the fact I told him not to marry her - and well, you know -- my psycho and sick neighbor.  Did she put someone up to this?  An automated voice answers BankOne and forces me into a long sequence of listening to numbers.  If you want to open a new account, press one.  If you want to make a payment, press two.   I of course press the hell out of the number ZERO.  Com'on folks, I don't have information to enter in --  I AM NOT YOUR CUSTOMER !  Finally, a customer service rep comes on.  When I explain the situation, she tells me I need to speak to Credit Services.  I get forwarded on to Credit Services and she checks out the information.  She verifies there is no account under my information:  address, name, telephone number and social.  She says she is baffled as well.  We then check out Edwards name and  bingo , she finds an account.    For some reason I am mad about that--  but what did I expect?     Edward has an account!  I guess I wanted there to be nothing there, absolutely nothing because then I would feel better.  The woman informs me that I need to speak to the Security department.  I certainly want to speak to the security department too.  Before she lets me go, I ask her if Edward lives in the same state -- and she replies yes.  I ask her if he lives in the same town and she tells me she can't tell me.  I then ask her if he owes a lot of money and replies she is unable to divulge that information.   Now that's weird.  Yeah, Edward probably owes a lot of money and has a PO box!  As I am holding for the Security department, I quickly go online to the white pages and type in Edward's name.  Someone with his first initial, middle initial and last name pops-up on the screen.  He lives about 30 minutes from me!!!   This is scary.   Did someone at the Sam's club in this town where I occasionally shop do something really strange with my information?  My vicious neighbor's adopted and estranged daughter also lives in this town.  Hmmm......  Security gets on the line, and says they don't have a clue how Edward got my e-mail address and they simply think he typed his e-mail address wrong.  They don't suspect fraud because my name is not involved anywhere.    I stare at his name and I look at my e-mail address, pondering this whole thing.  It would make total sense he would want my e-mail address as it is   his last name  , but obviously when he tried to get it using the same service provider (I am guessing here folks) -- he wasn't able to because it was taken --  taken by me .   I further deduce he added another letter or number to his e-mail address but forgot to type it in to BankOne when he signed up for his account.   Note to self:  Be very careful about entering your e-mail address.  Sigh.  I'm half relieved.   I have to think about this more.   It does make sense.   It is plausible.    But can I trust that?    Before I hang up with BankOne, I say to the woman, "Let me ask you one more question.  Is this Edwards' address....blah, blah, blah."   I read it right out of the online white pages.  The customer service woman replied back, yes it is.  I then say thank you and hang up.  I think I want to do a little more investigation with a credit bureau sometime today, but I am pretty sure I am safe here.   WHEW!!  Whoa.

       urlLink    urlLink   urlLink    Last night my husband and I decided it was a good night to go out, and enjoy dinner. Since the day was hot and humid, we were ready to be indoors and to enjoy some air conditioning! Earlier, we enjoyed ourselves by floating on rafts out back as the wind whipped the waves over our sun-seared bodies. Was it ever wavy! Unfortunately, my poor husband decided he wanted to wear a speedo (for the first time since his 20s) -- and since the water kept him cool, he didn't realize he got a nasty burn. He realized it as he got out of the shower before we left to dinner. Ouch!  For some strange reason, my husband who usually avoids steak, said he had a hankering for a good steak so we went down to the touristy resort town for the best steakhouse. Considering it was Sunday night, we didn't figure we'd run into any crowds and boy were we wrong! The parking was horrendous, and when we opened the restaurant door, the crowds were standing around waiting. My husband got a pager and we sat on a bench, and people watched.   It's so funny. You can literally pick out the natives from the tourists. The tourists come from a huge metropolitan city for a weekend getaway -- and they stand out like sore thumbs. They are always dressed really trendy. This time I gathered that slick-slacks are all the rage. Every single tourist had them on -- I swear. Some were drizzled with glitter - other with rhinestones. The women wore them, the men wore them -- and the kids had them on, too. They wore them with jeans, with shorts and with skirts. Some of them were quite fancy. It was a riot to see how the marketing directly impacts city dwellers. They all look the same! I don't think they have a clue they are so immersed in the culture of buy, buy, buy.   I do try to stay trendy up here, but lately, I seem to always miss the mark -- Glamour magazine must be missing the beat too! My slip-on mules ended up looking so dated LOL. I don't want to be too-rural, too-out-there and too behind the times. I like to try to balance the best of both worlds. I don't think I'll go for the slick-slack look, but I think I can do better!   I also noticed how  F A T  America is getting. It's almost scary. Every third person who walked by was obese. They weren't just chubby, they were grossly over-weight -- and when the adults were obese, so were the children. I actually believe that genetics account for much of our weight, but you can't help wonder how our  lack of time in life  is affecting us as a culture -- and exasperating our problems. You wonder if anyone cooks carrots or peas anymore - or if anyone eats a healthy salad.  Ever?    Since this was a resort town, there were a lot of little children running around. And for some reason, last night, all the children looked like "little me-s" (i.e. their parents). It was almost funny. I think I could have lined the children up on one side and the parents on the other --and I could have matched them up without any effort. In the past few months, I have suddenly realized that parents today are YOUNGER than me. They were always older -- and that has hit me like a brick. It's strange to think I am older than new parents! I don't know when that changed, but I just noticed it!   Once we were finally seated, the waitress at the next table was serving a huge family of seven. It's rare today to see a family of seven. I can't imagine that father's dinner bill -- it must have been close to $200. You have to make a damn good living to afford that family! The waitress was the one who caught my eye though. She had a radiant beauty. She had olive tanned skin, and curly medium brown hair which she had tied up and pulled back. Her cheeks just screamed of youth and energy as they were flushed pink -- beautifully so. She was tall and thin. She looked like she should have been on MTV's Real World. She was as cute as Cameran from the San Diego show, but had a touch of  urlLink Trishelle  from the Las Vegas show and more  urlLink Mallory  from Real World Paris -- with curly hair -- if you can imagine that.  I turned to my husband and told him, if I could look like anyone -- I'd like to look like her!  He replied very gentlemenly and told me he thought I was beautiful.  Sadly, because he is my husband, I take that comment with a grain of salt.  As I ate my steak and mashed cauliflower, I couldn't help but watch another family across from me. They looked like tourists, but not the average tourist family. The mom was overweight. She had rolls protruding from her t-shirt. It wasn't pretty. Her husband had blonde hair and a crew-cut. He was stocky. They had two young children, a little girl and a little boy -- who each took after their parents respectively when it came to weight. When their appetizers arrived, I no longer questioned why they were over-weight. They ordered two appetizers: borsin-cheese stuffed deep-fried mushrooms and deep-fried buffalo wings.   When our waiter came back to the table, I couldn't help but ask him if the crowds were unusual tonight. He replied that they were very unusual. They actually hadn't seen crowds this big on a Sunday in, well, as long as he could remember. I turned to my husband and told him I bet school is starting in a few weeks and everyone  decided  this was the week  to take vacation.
