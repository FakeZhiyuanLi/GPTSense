        So today I spent sitting in front of the television.&nbsp; Sometimes it's my only solice in life.&nbsp; Everyone deserves one thing right.&nbsp; Even this was giving me no joy today seeing as everything was promoting the untimly end of even the most perfect relationship.&nbsp; Poor Brittany Murphy, Gag.&nbsp; Getting myself out of bed I thought that going to the mall to buy a new white purse for this weekends wedding would make me feel better but once again to no avail.&nbsp; I ended up turning right around to go get take out to eat, in bed.&nbsp; This is one of those days where I wish I could sleep forever.&nbsp; Something hit me the other day and ever since I have had a hard time dealing with it.&nbsp; Not that I can sleep normally anyway.&nbsp; So here I sit at 12:17 am waiting for a stupid phone call that I didn't want in the first place... There is a strong possibility that I won't even get that unwanted phone call.&nbsp; But like an idiot I'll wait and wait and not sleep.&nbsp; I want to be a person who doesn't care.&nbsp; Why should I?&nbsp; Im not deserving of a decent relationship anyway because of the kind of person I am right?&nbsp; He's the saint for being with me, hahaha.&nbsp; Whatever.&nbsp; This is exactly what I told myself I wouldn't do.&nbsp; Im so good at letting myself down, forget about you.&nbsp; This mental kahh kahh really gets to me after a while.&nbsp;     You know it's serious when leather accessories don't even help.... Viva Prada!&nbsp; I will return.

        I am allergic to mosquitos.&nbsp; Living in hot, humid, New York in the summer dosen't exactly&nbsp;promote my cause.&nbsp; I had to come home early tonight because my left ankle was so swollen from being bit twice&nbsp;that I was no longer able to walk.&nbsp; So I spent my evening soaking my wounded mosquito feeder in hot salt water while looking at the other four bright candy apple red bites on my right leg.&nbsp; This of course could not have come at a better time.&nbsp;I have a wedding to go to on Saturday which is a rare event that insists I wear something presentable.&nbsp; It is a green strappless number that of course falls only to&nbsp;the knee leaving my bitten red&nbsp;stumps bare for all to see.&nbsp; How tacky I say.&nbsp; Maybe no one will notice if they can get past my inscessant scratching and whining.&nbsp; All in all it should be a very attractive sight Im sure.&nbsp;The only things that would make me feel better right now would be going to J Crew and investing in yet another pair of cotton chinos I can hide myself in during these summer months.&nbsp;     It's now 1:53 in the morning and I wish I was asleep like everyone else.&nbsp; Instead my boyfriend is a bartender, Im an insomniac and I have nothing that requires me to wake up before noon.&nbsp; Who knew 23 would be so productive.&nbsp; I have dedicated my self to the profession of "waitress" for the past 9 months both frequently and infrequently looking for another career.&nbsp; Sometimes life is so paralizing(More so than mosquitos). I keep thinking of things I need to do or should do.&nbsp; It's funny that somehow in lifes quitest moments my brain manages to be loud loud LOUD.&nbsp; SHUT UP BRAIN!&nbsp; This is my "Q" to go lay down.&nbsp;

       Sir, I think that you might need some more variety in your life besides the contents of this bread basket.  So I have dirt under my nails and smell like lobster.  Wave your hand at me one more time and I swear I'll chew it off seeing as I missed dinner this evening to serve you yours.  Im in a room full of animals throwing french fries and I think I might scream. No sweet heart, Im not the one who has to clean up your mess.  She says it as if it would matter if I were to be the one on my hands and knees picking up this crap.  Sadly some other poor slob has that job besides myself.  I don't know which is the greater evil.     The girl is underage and still thinks she can be served alcohol. Crafty.  If you won't let me see your ID I think you answered your own question.  Next time try looking me in the eye when you order your Coors Light, perhaps I will be fooled. Perhaps.     He came in to yell per usual.  An underage employee is drinking, the place is a mess and you have no manager so either hire one or stop bitching.  You say you don't want to be botherd with anything so lets stick with that because I don't think you'll have a cook tomorrow due to your bad attitude.  If you want respect you have to give just a little in return.  Two weeks notice is sounding really good tonight.     For me the money is good tonight.  Go home, lick my wounds and tomorrow is another day.  Sometimes I wish the whole damn place would just blow up.   Pasquale is somewhere with two three pound lobsters.  What is the world coming to?

       I have always been told that I am thick headed.  I personally always viewed having opinions and ideals as a good thing but apparently I was mistaken.  Lately I have been wondering what exactly the point is.  People don't change, shit happens and people don't change.  I could spend a life time stressing over the things in my life that go wrong due to the people that I have in my life.  I think that people by nature want to fashion  things around them in a way that makes  them comfortable.  LIFE IS UNCOMFORTABLE, DEAL.  I love everyone that I have let into my life and is still in my life at this point.  There are a questionable few but for the most part I feel like I have been an OK judge of character.  I just find more and more that I don't feel like Im getting anything out of my relationships.  I find great comfort in being with myself and by myself.  I would consider myself independant on many levels.  There just has to be more, Im missing something.  Maybe I need a night job, a hobby a support group?  Im 23, tired, bored, a bit lost, a bit anxious.  Push, Push, Push.  Lately I have been listening to talk radio and feeling more at ease.  I would rather listen to that at this point than anyone else.  Im tired of being the ear that has to answer back all the time.  I don't even want someone to talk to.  Everyone is concerned with themselves.  Myself included at times.  I am the social worker with no weekly pay check.... Well almost like a real social worker with no degree.  God, I need a degree in something don't I?  Whatever will I amount to if I don't finish my degree.  I have been looking for a job for 7 months now and have almost just given up and sacraficed myself to the service industry for an indefinite amount of my life.  It pays right?  Im tired.  This was good I feel a bit better.
