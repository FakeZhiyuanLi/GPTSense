      Hm... today's events included going to In-N-Out with Jesse for a contradictory meal of a protien-style double-double and a vanilla milkshake. Good thing I dodged the carbohydrate bullet of the burger bun... and then sucked down a shake loaded with sugar. Well done.  Then we embarked on a futile quest to find something that would let Jesse play a PS2 on his computer monitor, but it turns out the fat cats at Gamespot, Radio Shack, and Fry's won't stand for that kind of rebellious choice in video screens.   I called around looking for stuff to do in Santa Cruz tomorrow. Jenny's hanging out with her boyfriend, and I couldn't get a hold of Alicia... who'd have thought? So I'll be hanging out with Jenna for the most part.  My "costume" will somehow involve my fake hand, probably sticking out of my jacket pocket. I'm not about to do anything where I can't wear my jacket- it's gonna be cold as all hell out there.   Popup blocker count: 1193  Just watched Super Troopers. Pretty funny, if cliche.

      Stupid blogger was down for maintainace last night, so I was unable to post about how bored I was. Damn you blogger, damn you to hell.   I'm downloading Supertroopers and The Way Of The Gun. I'm starting to get back into the mode where I feel like if I'm not constantly using all 150kBps of my DSL connection I'm being wasteful. Can't have that.   I went to the shoreline lake/resivior/whatever thing yesterday and walked around it. It'd be fun to rent a sailboat sometime and cruise around, but the bastards say you have to be certified to rent one, and knowing Shoreline it'd cost an arm and a leg to get certified.  I got another email from the editor of pc.IGN.com with another round of game scraps to review. He also said he thought I'd been too hard on Eric Young's Squad Assault: Westfront "simply because it is a war game," and that he was going to play it himself before posting the review. Bleh. Personally I think he'll agree with me once he plays it- it was pretty half-assed. I just sent him a reply saying that I stand by everything I wrote with the exception of ommitting the scenairo editor in the replayability score.

      Terminator 3 was pretty mediocre... it's even more surprising now that I've seen it that Arnold won the election so soon after that movie. It wasn't bad, but I'm glad I didn't pay to see it either. Hopefully Once Upon A Time In Mexico will be better.  I'm on another downloading blitz. Barenaked Ladies' new album, Everything To Everybody, is pretty damn good so far. I've been using Friendster to find people with similar musical tastes to my own and seeing what else they like. So far I've gotten Guster (good) Flaming Lips (so far so good) Badly Drawn Boy (ok) and some other stuff that was crap and I deleted it already and don't even remember what it was. I'm also getting some stuff from Ben Folds Five and The Smiths that I haven't listened to yet. So I'll have to revise my playlist again sometimes soon to incorporate some of this new stuff. I forgot to add Coldplay and Evanescence last time too.  Now if I can just figure out some reason to leave the house... there's bloody nowhere to go around here.

      Alright, I am ready to announce the new additions to my playlist. Drumroll...  The White Stripes - Hotel Yorba The White Stripes - We're Going To Be Friends Dido - White Flag Outkast - Hey Ya Queens Of The Stoneage - No One Knows R.E.M. - Bad Day The Postal Service - Such Great Heights The Postal Service - We Will Become Silhouettes The Cardigans - Please Sister  Some of these will doubtless be whittled out the next time I pare down the playlist... Hey Ya's novelty will wear thin after a while I'm certain. Dido may or may not make it, and this Cardigans song just barely made it on the list.  I'm not wild about the new Strokes - Room on Fire album. It sounds just like the last one, which was good for a song or two, but gets old after a while. No keepers on there thus far.   I'm also downloading Terminator 3 and Once Upon A Time In Mexico, because if tomorrow is anywhere near as dull as today I will need all the entertainment I can get, and I sure as hell ain't gonna pay to see a movie with Arnold in it ever again.

      Ug... nothing... to... do...  I started reading Angelmass by Timothy Zahn the other night, but haven't really gotten into it yet, mostly because I've been picking up the book at 1:30 and only had about 15 minutes of reading in me at that point.   I made an omlette today that didn't taste like crap. Sometimes I amaze even myself.  I must have accidentally left "send me bullshit spam" checked when I made my NowhereDan screen name, because I've gotten a couple of AOL ads in the last few days. Jerks. Stupid Outlook tells me I've got new mail even when it has already deleted it as spam... must find a way around that.   Final verdict: Audio Slave = one hit wonder. If that. Like A Stone isn't  that  good a song. Got another Queens of the Stoneage song I like called No One Knows, bringing their grand total of good songs up to 2. I think Evanescence has two songs I'll keep, and The Postal Service has one or two. Maybe one off that new Cardigains album. When I finally pick them out and put them in my playlist I'll post a list of songs I keep.

      Alright, I'm starting a blog. Should be fun. I expect its primary use to be angry rants about stupid people and other useless information.   So for today I have planned... nothing. I have to pick up my dad at the airport tonight, but other than that I'm just gonna be sitting around on my ass doing nothing. Maybe more futile job searching.  I did a little research and figured out that the stupid bugs that I keep seeing in my bathroom are probably breeding in the sink drain. They're called Moth Flies, which is appropriate because I was describing them to people as a cross between a moth and a fly. A little draino should fix'em good.  My Google toolbar today blocked its 1000th popup window.  I went and played pool with Jesse, Chris Rini, and Alex Joshi last night in downtown Mountain View. I  am  The Walking Handicap.  I'm downloading some of Audio Slave's self titled album on the off chance that they've got another song worth listening to other than Like A Stone. Other recent downloads include Coldplay -  A Rush of Blood to the Head, Evanescence - Fallen, and The Postal Service - Give Up. I'll probably keep a few songs off of each album. Also I got my very first Outkast song: Hey Ya. It's amazing- all a rap group has to do to please me is do something with actual music instead of only a backbeat.  I downloaded and read the Justice League comic Kingdom Come yesterday. It was ok... like The Dark Knight Strikes Back it was about the realistic impact of "metahumans" on the world, and how they'd inevitably forget about protecting people and fight amongst themselves for territory and such. The art was particularly good. Then I downloaded some of "The Kingdom" which was supposed to be a sequel series, and so far it's pretty lame. Of course they couldn't resist bringing in the "Linear Men" and time travel garbage that ruins everything.

      The Simpsons tonight was 5x as good as last week's. Still heavily relying on insane plots and Homer screaming, but much more consistantly funny and no forced cameos.  For some reason I've been getting an absurd amount of spam lately. Most of it's getting blocked by Yahoo's filters, but it's getting to the point where I got a warning message saying I'd used up almost all my disk space online because they only empty the bulk mail folder every thirty days. That's absurd- I'm getting more than 10 megabytes of spam per month.

      I saw Timeline today, and it was much better than I thought it would be. Still not as good as it could have been, but it's by far the best movie treatment any Michael Chricton book has gotten since the first Jurrasic Park. They left out all the good time travel and parallel universes theory and glossed over the language barrier (the English did not speak what we know as English 600 years ago) and left out the earbud translators/radios that played a crucial role in figuring out who the evil guy from the present was (instead they just flat-out tell you) but it was still a pretty good movie.

       urlLink Mercury News | 11/27/2003 | Bush brother paid by Chinese chip firm   Seems Neil Bush has had some of his laundry aired during his divorce. A Chinese semiconductor firm is paying him $2 million (and, it would seem, free sex with prostitutes- this guy's got Bush "family values" coming out his ears!) over five years to "from time to time" provide financial advice and insight into the industry. Of course, Bush has no experience in the semiconductor industry- he's actually a former savings & loan banker who's been barred from the banking industry after the failure of his company cost taxpayers $1 billion in the 1980's.   Guess what? Conservatives just lost their "Clinton sold influence to the Chinese" and "Roger Clinton sold influence" aces.   And of course this comes out just as Bush makes his suprise visit to the troops in Bahgdad. Whoopdee-dee, he spends two hours in town (from what I saw of the video coverage of the visit there were about seven flash bulbs going off ever second- I nearly had a seizure) for a photo op in yet another military uniform and then takes off again before anyone even knows he was there... big brave man. And it's not like presidents didn't visit the troops in Vietnam and Korea.  Anyway, as many people may have noticed, today was Thanksgiving. In accordance with tradition, I stuffed myself silly at our anual family gathering, and then we all went to a movie. This year the choices were pretty crappy- we ended up seeing Master And Commander: The Far Side of The World. I give it a C+... Russel Crowe was pretty good, but the story took a bunch of weird tangents that totally killed the pace of the movie. And they didn't do a very good job psychologically either. Most movies like this do one of two things- they either pitt one ship's captian against the other and show both perspectives and have them meet and talk about how they're going to kill eachother, or they treat the enemy ship as the villain of the movie and never show the captian or crew. In this one they were leaning towards the second option, but then at the end they had a battle where the British boarded the enemy French ship, which wrecked that. It also seemed a lot longer than the 2 hours that it was... probably because they had THREE surgery scenes, which I can't watch. I know, I'm a pansy- I can watch people get shot or stabbed or whatever, but start opperating on them and I get all nauseous. Anyway, I don't recomend it.   Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn was a much better captian vs captian movie.

      I finally finished Knights of The Old Republic... though I think I only won because the AI messed up in the end and the bad guy stopped fighting back. Oh well, that's only fair- there were countless times when my group's AI messed up and they stopped fighting, so I figure I deserve some compensation.   Now I start over and do everything the evil way. Should be fun- killing innocents for no reason, taking people's money and then killing them, smacking people around 'till they do what I want, that kinda thing.

      Sorry, Imaginary Blog Readers, about not posting yesterday. I know your lives revolve around your daily fix of reading about all the stuff I didn't do every day.   The fact that I didn't do anything yesterday is no excuse for not posting- hell, if I was posting based on when I had something interesting to say, there'd only be two or three entries on here.   Rest assured, KOTOR did not go unplayed yesterday.  Here's something I can write about: Spam. I don't understand it.   Question 1: Why do spammers think that people who filter out the word "Viagra" are likely to buy it? Why do they spell it "Vi/\gra" or "V I A G R A" or "Vi@gr@" to dodge filters put in place specifically by people who don't want to buy Viagra? It makes no sense whatsoever.  Question 2: Untracable spam. How can spammers who mask their identities make any money? In order for some gullible idiot to actually buy pills that "enlarge your love-muscle" they have to know which direction to throw their money away in. How can they do that without having some kind of identifying information about the sender? I've seen a lot of spam that advertises specific porn sites... I don't understand why they aren't being fined or shut down for this kind of thing.   It's probably a stupid people thing.

      Well, I was a bit dissapointed in that Simpsons epsiode... it was just a mishmash of previous story ideas. The thousand dollar bill floating in through the window ws just like Boyscouts in the Hood, for example. The cameos were forced and awkward. There were a few good jokes, but there was far too large a gap between them. I hope Fox hurries up and puts out season 4 on DVD so I can relive the glory days.  Speaking of Fox... god I hate that channel. It's as bad as MTV. During the three ad breaks in The Simpsons tonight, they plugged a ton of shows, and I wasn't the least bit interested in watching any of them. Perhaps the funniest one was the ad for the American Idol Crhistmas Special, where they had a bunch of the top contestants singing Christmas songs. The amusing part was the "narrator" or whatever you call him was using the same overly dramatic voice he uses for all the other Fox shows, which sounds like he's talking about zombies coming to eat your brain.  Oh, and Old Navy has done it again. I'm pretty sure they're making ads now just to spite me, because they can't possibly think that Fran Drescher would be a good spokesperson. Much less Fran Drescher saying "Pizzel Nizzel" or whatever Snoop-Dogg MTV crap she was spewing. I've said it time and time agian, but I'm going to put it in writing: I will NEVER purchase ANYTHING from Old Navy, and it's not because I think they're exploiting child labor, or because I think they're overcharging, or even that I think their clothes are ugly. It's because their ads are so fucking annoying that I refuse to contribute even one fraction of one cent of my money towards making and airing any more of them.  If anyone needs me I'll be playing Knights of The Old Republic like a junkie.

      And today, I did a grand total of nothing. Zip. Zero. Nada. And other synonyms as well. I didn't feel like getting out of bed until about 11:30, and then I just played KOTOR all day. I did finally get to the point where I'm a Jedi, which is pretty cool. And I'll say this for the game- it has some awesome replayability. I'm already itching to go back and do EVERYTHING wrong and get a maximum body count.  Here's one thing that bugs me about the Star Wars Universe- they're basically saying that technology hasn't changed in something like 20,000 years. They've had hyperdrive, lightsabers, blasters, etc for that long... it just seems a bit on the odd side that an advanced society that spans thousands of worlds would have such a technological stagnation.  Goddamn  I'm a nerd.

Word to the wise: beware of low-flying beanie babies at Boarders.  Knights of The Old Republic is pretty good so far, though not exactly what I expected. I guess I'm just spoiled by Fallout, which in my opinion is the best damn RPG ever.

      Alright, so I've talked myself into buying Star Wars: Knights of The Old Republic. It's been a while since I played an RPG, since most of them are fantasy and I much prefer science fiction, and this one's gotten some rave reviews. Supposedly it's better than Episodes I and II (I should hope so) plot wise. So I think a Fry's run is in my near future. Unfortunately, Fry's isn't doing their nice little $40 new game deal with this one, so it's not gonna be cheap... and to pay for it I'm going to have to endure some pretty grueling computer tutoring work, with the added bonus of a slight language barrier this time. Ug. It had better be worth it.

      Well everyone, in 10 minutes Arnold Schwarzenegger becomes our new governor, all nice and legal like. And in 10 minutes, I will be officially ashamed to live in this idiotic state.   If Arnold had actually said what he was going to do, I'd be fine with people voting for him. But he didn't- he just made a bunch of general statements about how Davis was bad and he was good, spouted a bunch of catchphrases from his movies, and people bought it. Now we're stuck with a guy who's not even consistant enoguh to be called a real Republican... and it's a real indication of how far the GOP is willing to bend to win when they back a pro-choice guy with name recognition over someone who really does have the "values" they're so gung-ho about like Tom McClintock. To quote Bill Maher, "It's starting to look like Republicans will do anything to win an election except get the most votes."  Well, it's almost time- goodbye, last shred of this state's dignity.

      This is why I hate this town: Last night Jesse, Jon and I went out to go to a bar. First we went to the one and only bar in downtown Los Altos, where we were the only ones there under 35. Then we went to The Boardwalk, which was crawling with children, like 5 and up, at 11 at night. What the hell is going on? Our only local choices are a retirement home and Uncle Moe's Family Feedbag ("I expect that kind of language at Denny's, but not here!"). Reason #479 to get the hell out of this town.  My reading list backlog grows ever longer. My brother's Peace Corps girlfriend came into town yesterday and loaned me Philosphy According To The Simpsons, which I've been meaning to read ever since my junior year at Santa Cruz when there was a course taught around that book that I couldn't get in to because seniors filled it up the first day they could register... the bastards. Since it's borrowed, I may have to put it at the top of the list and read Lies and The Lying Liars Who Tell Them later.   I started my review of Curse today... gonna try to finish it by tomorrow. I got a lecture from Mom tonight about what Dr. Phil thinks I should be doing while I'm looking for work, so I have to at least pretend like I'm being productive.

      Finished Curse today. Man, was that an anti-climactic ending. Oh well, at least they tried to have a plot, which is more than I can say for most games. I think it took me around 10 hours total to beat it on regular difficulty which isn't bad... the only problem being that this kind of adventure genre game has zero replayability value. I'm thinking I'll probably give it a 7.0-.7.5 area score... now I've just gotta type up the review.

      I got Curse: The Eye Of Isis FedExed to me today. So far it's not bad- kind of a Resident Evil meets The Mummy. It's creepy, the environments are very pretty, and what voice acting there has been so far is good. It's got some nifty lighting effects too, and a neat system where you can shoot at specific body parts. Downsides so far: the camera is trying to be cinematic, so it chooses all kinds of weird angles where half the time you can't see the enemies coming at you, the character animation is a bit stiff (no skeletal animation or rag doll physics), the environment is not at all interactive, and the controls are a little bit clunky and hard to get used to. Oh, and it doesn't seem to store what your current objective is... I forgot what I'm supposed to be looking for, and it won't tell me twice. I guess I should be taking notes.  I went and got a flu shot today with my parents. Man do I hate needles... it didn't hurt going in, but it stings when they pump you full of vaccine, and I think they hit a muscle, 'cause my arm's a little sore now. I think I was the only person under 50 in line for that shot, too. It's rare you see that many old people in one place outside of a retirement home or Republican rally. But at least I ain't getting the flu now.

My popup blocker's up to 1417... man do I lead an exciting life.  Oh, I guess there was one development today. I got an email from the editor of IGN.com, with bad news and good news. The bad news is that he isn't going to post my first review because he thought it was too harsh... personally I think the scale must be out of whack if that game deserved higher than a 5 out of 10. But anyway, the good news is that they didn't learn their lesson, and they're sending me another free game to review. Suckers. Maybe I'll be nicer this time. I saw a couple of screenshots of this one, and it looks much better than the last one. Maybe I'll actually be able to give it a positive review- wouldn't that be a treat?

       urlLink Star Wars: Clone Wars | View Chapters Archive   I've seen the first three episodes of this new Clone Wars mini-cartoon thing, and so far I'm pretty unimpressed. First of all, I'm not wild about the animation style. It's done by the same guys who did Samurai Jack, which I never really got into. I find the movements to be a little bit too jerky for me- I like the smoother, more realistic animation styles like the Bruce Timm Batman/Superman/Justice League shows and even The Simpsons/Futurama style. I guess I don't like the quick switching from beauty shot to beauty shot without much between.   Second complaint is the length of the episodes- they're only like 5 minutes each, and they feel more like trailers for the show than the actual show itself. They'd have been better off doing 12 minute episodes like Invader Zim did, I think.  And finally, elite clone troopers? Does that sound contradictory to anyone else? Hell, I thought the whole point of a clone army is that they're  all the same.  Didn't make much sense to me.

      I finally finished Angelmass. It took me way too long to read... I only read about 250 pages today in I don't know how many hours. I blame school forcing me to read crap all the time and draining my enthusiasm and ability to be engrossed by a book.   It wasn't the best Timothy Zahn book I've read, but it was a decent read. He always does a good job of telling several parallel stories that end up intertwining in lots of complex ways. The characters are also pretty damn good, and his villians are rarely one-dimensional "I'm evil because evil is fun" people- they always have thier own motivations.   In this particular case there was a little bit too much technobabble, and there was a lot of what may or may not be scientifically accurate black hole theory which was hard to follow, but I think I did fairly well in understanding what was going on. The epilogue left a lot unresolved, too.  Next on my reading list is Al Franken's Lies And The Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair And Balanced Look At The Right. The first fifty pages are funny as all hell, and make Ann Coulter look like the blithering idiot that she is.  And now for something completely different.  Here's a list of songs I'm adding to my playlist:   The Eels:  Flyswatter, I Like Birds, Mr. E's Beautiful Blues, Novacaine For The Soul, Mental, Last Stop: This Town, Love Of The Loveless, That's Not Really Funny.   The Flaming Lips:  Be My Head, Turn It On, Flight Test, Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots Part 1.   Guster:  Amsterdam, Careful, Keep It Together, Medicine, Airport Song, Rocket Ship, Great Escape, Either Way, Center of Attention.   Blind Melon:  Skinned  There are more to be added soon, once I filter through a few more albums.

      So far I've spent 90% of the day reading. I haven't gotten anything done or gone anywhere.   Here's a question: Why do bands like to ruin otherwise great songs by tacking a minute of horrible, grating, distorted guitar riffs or other wacky noises on to the end of it? A perfect example is Radiohead's Karma Police- there's that awful warbling noise in the end. Thank jeebus for sound editing software... I can clip off the ends of songs like that.

      My alarm went off when it was supposed to today at nine... but I hit the snooze about eight times and ended up getting up around ten.  Today I finally fixed a really annoying computer problem I was having- my grandfather's iMac had abruptly stopped playing nice with the router, and I couldn't get it back online.   For a while I was afraid that it was because of my precious new Microsoft 802.11G router that I got so I could enjoy my laptop to the fullest. It was possible, since this iMac is the only computer on the network still running OS9.2, and I wouldn't put it past Microsoft to quit supporting it (though a DHCP server is a DHCP server, and there's no reason for that not to work). I was somewhat relieved when I switched back to the old router and it still didn't work. So then I tested the cable that runs from our house to my grandfather's house directly behind us using my laptop, and that worked fine. So it was his computer's fault, and after I tinkered with the damn thing for a while without success I just installed a clean copy of 9.2 and it started working again. I still have no idea what caused this problem, or even what underlying problem this was a symptom of was, but I'm glad the stupid thing's fixed.  Other events of the day included helping Jesse get his car towed to the shop and driving him back, and helping my Dad take a large and unnecessarily heavy rug to be cleaned. I've been doing a little reading, 'cause I'm pretty sure my library books will be overdue soon, and I'm not even halfway through Angelmass yet. Plus I've got a copy of Lies And The Lying Liars Who Tell Them to read now (thanks Bubba).   Bittorrent has been good to me today- I got me a new episode of Justice League pretty fast, and I'm getting the latest Simpsons now at a very respectable speed.   Tonight I'm turning over all my Star Wars Galaxies posessions to Jason, since I'm canceling my subscription. Surprisingly, doing the same thing over and over again for experience points has a limited appeal for me. Maybe I'll get back into it in a while if they add some good new content.  The junction of my left shoulder and neck hurts for no good reason. I dissaprove.

      I finally liberated my laptop from Kat long enough to make a post. I'm still in Santa Cruz for at least another hour or two while I mooch some food and hang out with Bubba and Ryan and Kelsey and people for a little longer.   I finally saw Kill Bill today. It was pretty damn good- very Tarentino in its non-linearity, though it surpassed even Pulp Fiction in gore and violence. I actually didn't mind that it was cut in half, because three to four hours is a little bit long for an action movie, and there was plenty of stuff happening in this half to make it worth the price of admission. The one gripe I had was that it often seemed as though Uma had superhuman strength, like when she was fighting the Crazy 88. I realize that it was kinda neccessary to have her be a super-ninja in a one-on-eighty fight, but at least in The Matrix Reloaded it was explained by the fact that Neo was Jeebus. Oh well, still a good movie.  I guess I need to catch up a little on here. Last night we all went to San Francisco to eat dinner and see a standup comedy show. We ate at the Stinking Rose, which specializes in garlic dishes. For an apetizer alone we ate enough garlic to kill a small child, or perhaps even something useful. I had the roast rabbit, since I'm working under the theory that the cuter the animal, the better it tastes. It turns out that a rabbit is almost exactly as cute as a chicken... though neither is as cute as a lamb. It was of course smothered in garlic, which I tasted clear through the movie today.  Then we went to a place called The Punchline and saw three guys do standup routines. The second guy was the best- he had some pretty solid material all the way through. My favorite joke was when he was talking about how the US was dropping food and bombs on Iraq and Afganistan, and they're dropping them in little nerf balls instead of in 500 pound crates, because apparently those landed on some people. "Imagine- you've been starving your whole life... and suddenly enough food to feed you for the rest of your life falls from the sky and crushes you."

      Sometimes, pie hurts.   After a full day of nothingness, Jesse picked me up and we went to Marie Calendar's for pie. We met up with Jon Weiner, Ricky Dunn, Joe (note to self- figure out what his last name is one of these days) and some chick from Jesse's history class who may or may not have been named Lauren. Lauren (if that IS her real name) used to work there, so we were able to order a full pie without having to pay the ridiculous $3 per-slice price you're supposed to pay when you eat it there.   I had already eaten a bread-bowl full of beef stew tonight, so I only managed to put down one monsterous slice of pie. I think Jesse ate half of that damn thing. It was "Sky high Boston cream," which was a hideous crossbreed of cake and pie. Too bad I'm watching my girlish figure these days.   I never thought I'd get driven home (or anywhere else) by Jon Weiner, the resident eco-terrorist of Los Altos. One horsemen of the Apocalypse down, three to go.  I saw an episode of Justice League today with the obligatory alternate universe Justice Lords who are all brutal and totalitarian an' stuff. A lot of them dressed much cooler too. But the thing that kind of irked me abou the episode was that they had the alternate dudes fight Doomsday, and after a medium-length fight the evil Superman beat him by lobotomizing him with his heat vision right after he said his skin could withstand a nuclear blast and while he was in the middle of saying how tough his bone was.   Kinda pissed me off for a couple reasons- first, Superman's heat vision shouldn't have been able to punch through his skin and skull and brain like that, and b) Doomsday's not supposed to talk. In the comic he just showed up out of nowhere and started laying the smack down on everything in his path, kicking the crap out of everybody, and eventually he and Superman killed each other. So it was kind of a waste of a character they could have used as part of a much larger story with the death of Superman.  And that will be just about enough comicbook fanboy talk out of ME, thank you.

      Went to bed at 4, managed to get up at about 9:30. Today I distinctly remember getting up to turn off my alarm and then going back to bed... a marked improvement over last time.   I made the mistake of downloading an episode of Enterprise to make sure I hadn't judged it too harshly... god does that show suck. It's sad that both the once-great "Star ____" franchises have been ruined by prequels that could have been so good. Well, Voyager ruined Star Trek before Enterprise did, but Enterprise is really just salt in the wound.

      Well, that was fun.   I relived some of my college years' past glory with a nice, pointless all-nighter, and got about the same amount of productive activity done as I did back then. Jesse and I watched the first two Matrix movies, starting at about midnight, then went to the theater around 4:30 AM and met up with Joe.   When we got there, only about 40 people were in front of us. There was only one group of people there other than us that didn't have sleeping bags and stuff, so I think we timed it about perfectly. Of course, by the time they let us in all the friends of the people who'd camped out had arrived, and suddenly we were behind about 150 people, several of whom were dressed in full Neo outfits. We got decent seats in the fifth row-a little closer than I would have liked, but far enough back to prevent permenant neck damage.  The movie wasn't as good as it could've been of course. I was neither dissapointed nor blown away. There were parts I liked and parts I didn't like, but all in all it was pretty visually spectacular, and I had fun watching it.   Stupid Century's theater was having speaker problems through half the movie... I could still hear everything just fine, but I don't go to a theater to hear sound that may as well be coming out of my PC speakers. So we complained, and we got free admission to another show of our choice. Pretty sweet deal- essentially I saw Revolutions for half price.  So I came home at about 9am, and took a 4 hour nap starting at 9:30. Or at least I PLANNED to take a 4 hour nap, but my goddamn alarm clock didn't go off (if it did go off I got up, turned it off, and went back to bed without remembering, which has happened before) so I ended up not waking up until 7:30pm. So now I'm ALL out of whack sleep wise. I'm going to try to take a 4 hour nap between now and 8am so that I can try to get on a normal schedule again... hopefully I'll do a little bit better this time.   In the meantime, I plan to finally get around to sorting through my recently downloaded music and filter out all the crap. So far I've picked out 8 Eels songs that are keepers out of five albums... most of thier stuff is ok, but nothing I want to listen to on a regular basis.  Oh, and Jesse got me both Family Guy DVD box sets for $25 each from the Tower returns bin. We watched some last night before and after our Matrix Marathon. God they're funny. And man have I been spending too much money lately... good thing I've now caught up with Simpsons, Futurama, and Family Guy DVDs for a good long while.

      So I'm going to see the 6am Matrix Revolutions show tomorrow. I'm not going to sleep- I'm going to go over to Jesse's and watch the first two movies at around midnight. It's going to hurt, but I can do it. I'll bring pizza and Mountain Dew- that should keep me going for a few extra hours. Good thing I didn't wake up 'till 11 today anyway. This might be a good time to shock myself back onto a real schedule, like getting up at 8 and going to bed around midnight, like a real person and stuff. Ew.   So it's now 6:17... exactly 12 hours from now I'll probably still be watching previews for other movies.

      Hurrah for democracy. I just went to vote for all kinds of fun stuff like the Foodhill/DeAnza board, the Los Altos School District board, and the Los Altos City Council, and measure D (whether to give lotsa money to El Camino Hospital for siezmic upgrades and new toys). I spent all of 30 minutes researching who to vote for. The sad part is, that's probably well above the average.  Just to mix things up, I voted for one of the two 18 year old punks running for office. I voted for Kevin M. Bella, recent MVHS graduate, who is running for a seat on the Los Altos School District board. Not solely as a novelty- he had more to say about what he wanted to do than some of his opponents. He's probably absurdly idealisticly liberal, since he said that he was inspired to run by Michael Moore, who also ran for office at 18. I also voted for a decent-sounding incumbant to balance things out.   In the end, I couldn't say no to a hospital's request for money. If anyone's going to have too much money, I think I'm most comfortable with it being a hospital or a school or something.  They had the fancy-schmancy new touch-screen voting terminals set up and running. It didn't give me any kind of paper reciept other than the sticker saying "I voted - touchscreen!" but it was sure as hell easier than the damn punchcard lunacy. Personally I think people are too paranoid about electronic voting- it's just a matter of proper sercurity to prevent tampering. I mean, this touch screen system is so easy that even a Florida retiree could handle it.

      My room is an absurd mess. And let me make myself perfectly clear- most people say "oh, my room's a mess" when they have a sock on the floor. I take my messiness far more seriously. There's stuff EVERYWHERE. Entirely too much stuff for someone who pretty much sits in front of his computer all day.   Every surface was covered with crap earlier today, but then my parents lied to me and said the cleaning people were coming today and I had to clear stuff out so that they could actually clean stuff. I think my mom sometimes tries to clean a little bit too much before they come, like she's trying to impress them or something. But anyway, my response to this was simple: I took everything from my desk and my floor and dumped it on my bed. In six hours I will dump it back onto the floor so I have somewhere to sleep.  To be fair, it's not entirely my fault my room's so messy. I have NO shelf space at all. I have my DVDs and books in boxes on the floor, and I've been living at home since June. Ok, so it's partially my fault- I COULD have shelves in here if I'd get off my ass and finish painting the moulding around the top of the walls that my mom started, because I don't want to move shelves in until that's done. So yeah, it's my damn fault.  I do dislike this room. When I moved out, my mom put in a giganto king size bed and a dresser, leaving approximately no room for anything. There's barely room for my chair between my bed and my desk. She also painted the walls, so I don't want to put up any of my posters 'cause I don't want to mark them up, and so my walls are depressingly bare. Just one more motivation for me to get a job and move the hell out of this town.  I talked to Tasha Shapiro last night for the first time since... um... I think I last talked to her when I was sitting in LAX waiting for my connecting flight back from Hawaii. Or maybe it was to Hawaii. In any case, that would have been in June. So this is the first I've heard from her in *takes way too long to do the math* five months? Lame.   Anyway, Tasha, if you're reading this, I protest being called a Los Altos Snob because I refuse to work retail. I refuse to work retail because I'm antisocial and I think that 85-90% of people have the IQ of seat cushions but aren't even useful enough to serve as floatation devices in the event of a water landing. Los Altos snobs aren't even close to my level of elitism.

      Today was pretty uneventful. Mostly taken up by chauffering my family around. I had to go get Jim from Stanford, then I had to take my uncle and his family to the airport and then take Jim back to Stanford after he'd done his laundry and visited a little.   I watched The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror XIV tonight, and I have to say I was fairly dissapointed. The first sketch had already been done by Family guy in an episode called Death Takes A Holiday (I think) where Death hurts himself going after Peter and nobody can die, so after a while Peter has to take over for him while he recovers. The Simpsons take on it was pretty much the same- Homer kills Death while Death was trying to kill Bart, and for a while no one can die. Then Homer puts on Death's robe and becomes the new Grim Reaper. It was pretty funny at parts (Homer escaping from God), but on the whole I was just irked that they couldn't have thought of a take on that story Family Guy hadn't already done.   The next act was very blah- Frinkenstein. Prof Frink brought his Indiana Jones-esque father back to life and he started stealing people's body parts to put himself back together. A couple of good jokes- Flanders had a line where he said he'd just done a Run For The Cure... for Homosexuality.  The last part was Bart and Milhouse using a magic stopwatch to freeze time... I thought they could have done better with that one, since it was the best idea for a sketch, but it was underutilized.  Anyway, then they had a rerun of the episode where Bart gets himself emancipated from Homer, and I had a pretty low moment. I was so put off by the ads and the crammed-in guest spots by Tony Hawk, Blink 182, and Jane Katzmerick that I actually turned it off halfway through. I have high hopes for the official season permier next week though... I forget what it was about, but it looked funny in the preview.  I watched Donnie Darko. Man, was that a weird movie. Good, but weird weird weird. Some really funny lines. Jake Gyllenhaal looked waaaay too much like Tobey McGuire... I can see why they had him as a backup to play Spiderman if Tobey asked for too much money. And man, was that a creepy-lookin' bunny. I don't know if I was satisfied with the ending, but it worked.   Past my bedtime now, must sleep. I've been getting up too late the last couple of days.

      Halloween was pretty fun, if sober. It's always enjoyable to walk around on Pacific and see all the wacky costumes. I got some nice pictures of some of the wackier costumes.  Lots of family in town today. We all ate at Chef Chu's, which is a damn good Chinese place and a favorite of my uncle's. The kung pow calimari was fantastic.  I single handedly incited some conservatives on a message board to the point where the moderators ended up closing down the entire political debate section. I did it almost without insulting them uncreatively... unfortunately I slipped up and called one of them stupid (he baited me with "we're not stupid, we're just not gutless"). I still consider it a moral victory over the forces of dumbass conservatives. I'd post a link to the page as a trophey of my achievement, but as I said, it no longer exists.  I've been munching on leftover Halloween candy all day. Those mini Reese's peanutbutter cup things are awesome. And somehow this morning, after having eaten a giant chunk of prime rib at the Ideal Bar & Grill yesterday, I weighed 219, which is less than I've weighed in probably two years.   I watched The Way of The Gun yesterday before I went to Santa Cruz. It was pretty good, as kidnapping movies go. It's hard to go wrong when you've got Benicio Del Toro.

      "What's all the fuss all of the sudden about Mad Cow in the US? We've had a mad cowboy in The Whitehouse for three years now!"  I have no idea where my dad heard that, but it was funny as all hell, especailly since he said it at the dinner table with my Republican aunt.   So it turns out I got up at 8 today for pretty much nothing. I showed up at the Voice office just to spend half an hour watching the current intern call the MVPD PR guy and write down some descriptions of the more interesting crimes of the week. Then I watched her type them up and corrected a few errors for her. For a news editor at the MVHS Oracle, she sure doesn't know her MLA style very well.   The rest of the day died as it lived- uneventfully. We had the cleaning people come and touch all our stuff, and then my mom came home and announced her intentions to host dinner for all our visiting family members. I got a $40 gift card to Barnes & Nobel from my aunt, which is cool- I must remember to write her a thank you email.  So then I just hung out with my cousin and tried to get him into LSN... but I think the graphics aren't Japanese enough for him, and I don't think his attention span can handle the amount of planning required per turn.  The Firefly Marathon Part II has been put off 'till next year, since everybody but me was busy today, and tomorrow is New Year's, for which I intend to be in Santa Cruz in a hot tub drinking cheap ass champaign and mimosas.

      I had my first day at the Voice today. Not too bad, despite having to go around and ask people a kind of inane question in a coffee shop. But, I guess that's going to have to be my MO for the next few months at least.   Also, the Firefly marathon began tonight. God I love that show, and curse Fox for being so bloody stupid and cancelling it.  Much as I would like to write more, I have to get up at an ungodly hour tomorrow.

      To celebrate Kelsey's birthday today, I went out to eat. When Jesse IMed me and asked me if I wanted to go to Boca De Bebbo tonight, my response was "Sure. But I don't want to gorge myself." And what did I do? Damn am I ever predictable. In case you're not familiar with Boca De Bebbo, the idea there is that they bring you gigantic servings of food which you share amongst the whole table. Well, out table of six got four dishes, which was way too much. And of course, being an Italian resturaunt, a lot of it was bread and pasta.  Also in celebration of Kelsey's birthday, I hung out with Pat Neal (whose girlfriend was visiting from Chicago), Jon Weiner, and Joe Minnesota (yeah, I keep forgetting your last name Joe). Many a dead baby joke was told, and much bashing of the South was done.  Further celebrating Kelsey's birthday, I released a cat into the wild, symbolizing freedom in a far less spectacular way than when you release a hundred white doves. But it's the thought that counts, and the owner called and said that the cat was able to get back into its house just fine (though the owner was on vacation). I think my parents were dissapointed to see it go.  Oh, and I also called Kelsey to wish her a happy birthday, but as usual her cell phone was off. I was gonna sing for her and everything...  Oh, and I learned a valuable lesson (I'm sure this was also in the spirit of celebration of Kelsey's birth): when you're narrowly ahead in points and the clock is winding down, for the love of god don't get cocky and rush your opponent- play defensive and run out the clock, or else you might do something stupid and cost yourself the win.

       urlLink Music industry piracy subpoenas illegal - (United Press International)  Haw haw... suckers!  Today there is a cat in my house. I don't think in my 18 or so years living in this house there has ever been a cat in here, but today there was one. On one or two seperate occasions there were squirrels that ran in an open door, but this is an entirely different situation. My dad saw this cat with a really loud bell jingling around in the front yard for a few hours looking cold, so he brought it inside and called the number on its tag, bu there wasn't anyone home and they have yet to call back. So my mom gave it scallops and milk.   Man, are my parents weird. They've been steadfastly against mamilian pets of any kind ever since I was four or five, when my uncle gave my brother a golden cocker spaniel named Teddy for his birthday. Teddy was cool- he liked to catch and eat flys. But he had a fatal flaw: Teddy liked to pee on Mom and Dad's bed, so he became an outside dog with a habbit of digging under the fence and running away. As the story goes, one day he'd just had a bath and wasn't wearing his collar, and he made his great escape. I was never entirely conviced that Mom and Dad didn't find a nice farm family for him.  But tonight Dad was making jokes about keeping it if its owner didn't call back, and Mom was feeding it from her plate. Dad fell asleep in the chair facing the woodburning stove with the cat on his lap. Of course, my dad would fall asleep there if there were a bowling ball on his lap, but still. Right now that cat's probably out in the living room peeing on stuff.  Tomorrow is Kelsey's birthday, which I am writing here for no reason whatsoever. Kelsey doesn't read my blog, which I know because she's never even online anymore, and the only link to my blog is in my AIM profile. And even if she were, my blog is very boring, so there'd be little point in reading it. Anyway, Outlook popped up at 11:45 and reminded me that Kelsey's birthday was in 15 minutes... gee thanks. For once I already knew someone's birthday was coming up.  I'm thinking I'm going to go to Santa Cruz Tuesday after my first day of training for my Voice internship. That'll give me some time to figure out what the hell to get for Kelsey's birthday present... I'm thinking a big ball of dryer lint, except I wouldn't want to give Kelsey the same thing for her birthday as I'm giving to Kat for her Christmas present.

      Wow, what a non-day. Most exciting moment: going to Fry's and buying 150 blank CDs for $14.50. Every so often they have a nice $4.50 per spindle sale, so I stock up. I figure these'll keep me busy for a good long while. I also burnt a CD today, and I was very pleased to see that it burnt a full disc in 4:04 rather than the 7-10 minutes it was taking before I reformatted. I was worried it was broken and that I'd have to get a new optical drive sometime soon rather than waiting for the speed to go up and the price to come down on DVD burners.   One thing I forgot about when I reformatted- I need to redo my spam filters. That should be fun- no emails containing the words penis, viagra, vicodin, hot teen sex, etc etc etc. I'm thinking I'll block out email that has a bunch of pictures of stuff pulled from websites too... that'd get rid of all the stupid spam that gets through the filters by just having pictures of words.  Oh, I got a business card sized piece of junk mail put in my mailbox last night. It didn't come with the mail, someone just stuck it in there. It was advertising an anti-spam service. So they're now giving me unsolicited junk mail to advertize service that stops unsolicited email... I hate people.

      You know, I'm actually kind of enjoying not really celebrating Christmas. I sure as hell don't buy into the whole Jesus's birthday angle, (not only because of the whole atheism bit, but also because it's believed that if he was born at all it would have been between Feburary and July) and while I enjoy being showered with material luxary goods as much as the next guy I figure I'm spoiled rotten year round anyway.   The closest thing we had to a Christmas celebration was dinner last night when my brother and his girlfriend and my aunt and uncle came. My mom had a little two foot fake tree, a bunch of those fake bright red plants, and some Christmas music playing, and that's as festive as we got. She also handed out a bunch of little gift bags full of trinkets (I got 8x binoculars for some reason) and a nice little check.   So I pretty much just killed the whole day, since everything was closed and everyone was doing family stuff, and my aunt got food poisoning at some buffet.   My reformatting went well, though I'm getting a couple of little glitches occasionally that weren't there before, like Explorer spontainiously crashing.  Oh, neat trick: If you're getting annoying random popup ads whether explorer is open or not, you're being spammed by someone exploiting Windows Messanger. Not Microsoft's IM client, but something built in to send messages over a network. So what you need to do to kill them is to go into control pannels>Admin tools>services and scroll down to messanger. Open that up and disable it. No more popups!

      Hm... I'm thinking it may be coming to that time again where I need to reformat my hard drive. I'm not looking forward to reinstalling everything again, but I've been having all kinds of problems lately, from CD burning taking 50% longer than it should to disk space magically dissapearing to random crashes. A bunch of annoying crap like that. I'm thinking I might enlarge my system partition... for some reason Windows gradually fills much more space than it should. That'll require wiping off another partition so I can allocate more space to the C drive, but that shouldn't be too hard, just annoying.  I spent most of the day watching the commentary tracks on the Firefly DVDs. Lots of insightful stuff on there... and a fair amount of Nathan Fillion talking about all the times he split his pants. There was a whole lot of depth of thought put into that show. Of course, watching those episodes again renews my anger at Fox for canceling such a great show after only half a season. Stupid bastards canceled the best thing in science fiction since Star Trek TNG... hell, it may even have been better than TNG, considering the dialogue in Firefly blows it out of the water. I'm still hoping for the movie to get made.  And of course it's Christmas Eve today. Merry commercialism to you all, and a happy fiscal new year.

      Whee, family day. We kinda celebrated Christmas today, because my brother is going to North Carolina with his girlfriend tomorrow to spend a couple of weeks with her family. My parents cut me a nice little check, which is always fun. Must... resist... blowing it all... on... hookers... and booze!  It's easy to not get anything done in a day when you don't get up until noon, but between drinking at Jesse's last night and not getting to bed until 4, and still being sore from snowboarding (tomorrow I expect to be able to raise my arms above my head again) I really didn't feel like getting up.  My fiercely republican aunt and uncle came to visit today. My uncle works as a lawyer in The Pentagon, and my aunt is a former NSA agent. Somehow I managed to get through the night only making one crack at Donald Rumsfeld's expense, but I got in trouble for it... my family has a rule about not discussing politics at gatherings, because if we did we'd all hate each other. One of my uncles is extremely liberal, and my aunt is extremely conservative, so that rule is very important.

      First and foremost, my Firefly DVDs finally showed up today. It's only the 22nd, so that's what, 13 days after it came out? Stupid Tower. I just re-read my post from the 9th because I needed to kill the AIM ads on my laptop, and I had a good laugh at myself bitching about it not being out yet.   I watched the pilot episode with the commentary on today, and damn was it good. It may have been the best director's commentary I've ever heard, with hardly any dead space where they had nothing to talk about, lots of good jokes, and lots of technical camera stuff that makes me realize I could never be a director. It makes me want to watch the Buffy/Angel DVD commentaries now... maybe I'll borrow them from Kat at some point. Hear that Kat? No, of course not- you don't read my blog, do you? So I can say anything I want about you and you'll be none the wiser. Well how about this: You're very tan!  Ok, so obviously second to Firefly comes the confirmation that I got the internship at The Voice. The editor called me this morning at about 10:30 to ask me if I could start training today, but since at that point I was still lying in bed aching from snowboarding yesterday I thought I'd put it off until next week. She said from the beginning that that was ok, since she was asking on such short notice, so I thought I'd take her up on the offer rather than limp around after the current intern up and down Castro Street trying to ask people the question of the week. But anyway, I now consider myself officially employed, which is a nice step up from the unemployed state I've been in for the past six months since graduation.  So I didn't really do anything today other than pop Advil every few hours and wait for LSN turns to come in... I suffered a few humbling defeats. Jesse threw a Monday Night Party tonight to punish his neighbors for daring to protest his playing soft jazz music at 9pm. There were too many people to list, but I saw Pat Neal for the first time in a while. I had a few beers and called it quits... I'm a cheap date, so even though I wasn't driving (Jason was my ride-bitch) I decided against drinking myself into a stupor.   Oh, and Chris Rini no longer owes me any money... I don't know what to do now that no one owes me anything. I guess I could lie and say that random people owe me money just for the hell of it and see if they fall for it. Let's try that: Bubba owes me $50! No, $100! If this works, I'll be rich.

      Snowboarding is fun, but punishing- I am going to be so unbelievably sore tomorrow morning. For what I'm pretty sure is the first time ever, I purchased a bottle of advil in anticipation of the pain.   But I did much better this time than in previous attempts- I actually made it down a few slopes without falling on my ass.  Random thought I had: In The Wizard Of Oz, the Tin Man needs a heart, and the Scarecrow needs a brain, right? Both are organs which are commonly associated with compassion/love and intelligence, respectively. But the Lion need courage, which bypasses the whole organ theme. My theory is that it was originally written that the Scarecrow needed a brain, the Tin Man needed a heart, and the lion needed  balls .

      I'm going snowboarding tomorrow for the weekend with Jason. Maybe this time (is it my third or fourth outting? I don't remember) I'll finally gain an understanding of the fine art of turning, though I'm sure I'll spend the vast majority of the time on my ass, which will become increasingly sore as time goes on. But thanks to Jesse, I won't be using a crappy rented board and crappy rented boots. I will be experiencing the strange sensation of having the board I'm riding be sold out from under me on eBay as I'm riding it. However, if I damage it I automatically become the high bidder...  Poker night was fun- I ended up down only $1.80. Not too bad at all, considering my luck.

      My interview seemed to go well. I just have to decide on a writing sample to send in, and I think I'll probably have a job in mid-January. It seems mostly like crap work, like doing the man-on-the-street questions and the police blotter, and stuff like that, but hey, it's a living. Wait, no it's not... it's like $60 per week. Well, it's experience.  Poker night at Jesse's tonight. If I break even it will be a big improvement over the last couple of times.

       urlLink 11 minute Mario 3 video a fake   Today dreams were shattered all over the internet when it was revealed that the guy who beat Super Mario Bros. 3 in 11 minutes used an emulator that saved several times per second and reloaded whenever he made a mistake. Apparently, it took 2 years to do... and I thought I had free time.   I renewed my Laser Squad Nemesis subscription today and played a few practice games. Oh, how I've missed this game. And now that it's got four sides instead of three and a bunch of handy interface tools, it's that much better.  I have my interview at 2pm tomorrow afternoon... I can't decide whether I'm excited or terrified. I'm sure I'll figure that out midway through the actual interview itself.

      A couple of quick things before I get to bed finally-  1) Return of The King rocked. A little long in ending, though... but it was ending for three movies.  2) Jamie no longer owes me $5.  3) Chris Rini now owes me $7.50. Why am I the one who always fronts cash for movie tickets? I have no job people!  4) I have lost my built-up resistance to cinammon. I ate half a box of Hot Tamales and I no longer have feeling in my tongue.  5) For all your twitching, dying rat needs, shop at Longs Drugs.

       urlLink Laser Squad Nemesis - Tactical Email Warfare   I think I'm going to make my triumphant return to Laser Squad Nemesis soon. They finally got around to adding in the Greys- I've been playing around with the hotseat mode and they're pretty bitchin'. I highly recommend trying it out, if you haven't.  I have my ticket to the 12:10am showing of Return of The King. If I have to stand out in the cold for two hours just to have Century Theaters botch the sound like they did on The Matrix Revolutions again, they will die. It's going to be another 2.5 hour movie I'm assuming, so I probably won't get home 'till close to 4am. Good thing I don't have a job!   Jamie owes me $5...  Man, I just noticed that Amazon's estimated shipping date for my Firefly DVDs is December 19th... dammit all to hell. At this rate Tower might actually have them in stock before I get them. I guess I can always cancel anytime between now and Friday, and it is a good sign that Amazon sold out- that can only be good for the chances of getting a movie made.

       urlLink MSNBC - Thurmond family confirms daughter   Kudos to the late Strom Thurmond, who proved to us all that you don't have to like black people to have sex with them, especially if you're 22 and she's your 16 year old servant. I guess we can add "statutory rapist" to his resume along with bigot. Actually, it was in the south, so it was probably nice and legal... unless there were laws against "poluting the race" back then.  In other news, Chipotle makes excelent burrito bols, and as a direct result of one of those and a small beverage, Jamie no longer owes me $7.50.   Oh, and my cousin Anne just got back from China, where she adopted her second Chinese daughter, Maria Stapleton. Aw.

      I just saw The Last Samurai. It was a lot better than I expected... and I didn't expect it to be bad. It was very similar to Glory in a lot of ways, which makes sense since they were both directed by the same guy. It also had the whole tradition vs. modernization angle going on.   But now that I look it up on IMDB I see that it was written, both story and screenplay, by John Logan, who wrote Star Trek Nemesis. If he can write like he did for Samurai, what the hell went wrong on Nemesis? That movie was a goddamn train wreck.   So in closing, The Last Samurai = good. And Jamie owes me $7.50.

      Raiders of The Lost Ark is a really, really good movie.If only George Lucas could still make'em like that.  The Boardwalk is a decent bar, but it's expensive and swarming with shrieking children. Why do parents think it's a good idea to allow their three year olds to run free around a sports bar?   I have an interview with the Mountain View Voice on Thursday, and tonight was the first time I'd ever seen a copy. It seems like a pretty decent paper- it has 26 pages of 50% articles 50% ads, and then another 22 pages of 100% ads. Hopefully they'll let me do some bitchwork for low pay...

      Never again will I trust a local store to get something in when they say they will. Three times now I've been to Tower trying to buy the Firefly DVDs (which  after  the employee discount is listed for only slightly more than Amazon's price) that they were supposed to get on the 9th, and each time I've had to turn to the sweet embrace of the Coldstone's next door for consolation.   Well, actually tonight I got some extra consolation- while browsing the DVDs I saw that Gigli, starring Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez, widely regarded as the biggest movie bomb in the last several years, had been placed in the "Box Office Blockbusters" section. I nearly cried laughing.   Of course, then I was deeply, deeply insulted when I went to Walmart and Target, and neither of them had Firefly either. I guess they felt stocking Season 1 of The Anna Nicole Show was a better investment than Firefly... frickin' morons.

      Things are finally starting to look up for me in the job-getting department, even if it is only an internship at a local newspaper that will pay next to nothing. It turns out my experience on the LAHS Talon staff will come in handy after all - the editor of the Mountain View Voice is a fellow alumni. Plus she's an old marching band buddy of my brother's... who'd have guessed  he'd  come in handy one day.  It's starting to get ass-cold around here again. This is of course wussy California cold, which seldom drops below freezing- but keep in mind that in my house we only heat one room of the house, and that's the same room where my mom likes to watch Dr. Phil. So I'm back here in my room in my big black coat. I finally broke down and got out the electric heat dish and pointed it at my chair, and I keep the door closed so eventually it becomes bareable in here.  Lousey Tower Records denied me my Firefly DVDs tonight... they were supposed to get them today, but apparently they never showed up. Oh well, soon, very soon. Such a good damn show.  Oh, if you've got AIM and you're getting those annoying audio ads, I found a way to kill them. I know it works on Windows XP, not so sure about 95/98/NT/2k. You go to your start menu>run, and type "C:\Windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts" (no quotes). Then when it says it can't open the file, tell it you want to select the program to open it with from a list, and choose Notepad and click ok. The last line of the file will say "127.0.0.1 localhost" and you're going to change it to look exactly like this: 127.0.0.1 localhost   127.0.0.1 ar.atwola.com  127.0.0.1 empiremovies.com  127.0.0.1 xlonhcld.xlontech.net  127.0.0.1 VTOT.proxy.aol.com  127.0.0.1 ads.web.aol.com  127.0.0.1 ads.aol.com  Then save it. Not save as, just save. And then you close it and you're done. You need to restart AIM, but after that you should never hear another audio ad. Up yours, AOL.

      Wow... I haven't seen a movie as bad as Daredevil in quite a while... and I can say that only having seen the first 40 minutes of it. It's already completely irredeemable.   Hell, the guy's just got superhuman hearing... and yet he's able to fall a hundred feet and stick the landing. Even Batman doesn't pull that kind of crap- he uses grappels. Why does he keep showing off? Somehow people don't figure out that he's not exactly blind in the traditional sense? And the acting is pretty awful too, which doesn't make much sense, since I've seen most of the cast act better than this. Damn, this be a dumb movie.

      Ah, Mystery Science Theater 3000... how I have missed you. They really need to bring this show back. Some massive movie/TV company should buy the rights, then have them use all the crappy movies they've made over the years. Paramount, Fox, Universal, whoever- any one of them has dozens if not hundreds of crappy, amusingly bad movies they could mock, and they'd make some more money off of movies so bad they'll never sell another copy.   Perhaps more importantly of all, they should hire me as a writer... that would solve that whole job problem too.

      If anyone has an argument against gay marriage that doesn't involve Gawd or Jeeeeeeezus being agin' it, I haven't heard it yet. What the hell do they think gives them the right to enforce  their  values on other people who don't share them? I guess I just answered my own question... It's a shame that Christians have been in power long enough to forget what it's like to be discriminated against based on their beliefs.   I heard some jackass columnist from Georgia talking about the Massachusetts gay marriage flap, and man, this guy was a prime example of that old bumper-sticker saying "Jesus loves you... but everyone else thinks you're an asshole." He was saying that it was wrong of the court to try to force recognition of a lifestyle "that most Americans disaprove of" on people. Talk about a dumb bastard- first of all, "most Americans" voted against George Bush. Second, why the hell should "most Americans" be able to tell me or anyone else how to live their lives, regardless of whether or not they approve of it? Man do I hate fundies.

      I had a nice little jaunt over to Santa Cruz today to drop off Ryan's birthday present. I hung around for a bit, but people were mostly busy working on all that end-of-the-quarter-assignmentfest/finals business so I didn't stay too long. You know, even though I can't find a decent job, about now I'm glad to be out of school.  When I got back I beat KOTOR the second time through (who says I'm not productive?). It took me a little over half the time it took me the first time, because when you're on the Dark Side you don't have to go out of your way to make people happy- you can just kill them. Much easier. Kinda nice that they really did make the Dark Side the quicker and easier path.

      Can I call them or can I call them? Well, strictly speaking I'm only batting 500, since I thought Dean would win Iowa. But in the New Hampshire primary, if Democrats were lotto numbers I'd be a wealthy man. I was a little worried when it looked like Edwards would edge out Clark, but that corrected itself.  Does it make me a bad person if I'm happy when I hear there's been a hate crime committed locally? I guess it kinda does, considering writing about it is only worth like $20 to me. But it sure beats writing about some domestic violence case or a woman trying to strangle her neighbor with a phone cord.  Oh, and it turns out that asking a question around town about the Superbowl is much easier to get responses for than a question about the state budget or Bush's ridiculous space program. Who'd have thought? Nice that people pay attention to all the wrong things.

      I spent most of the night playing poker at Jesse's place with him and Jon and Alex. Naturally I won big, since we weren't playing for real money. When we do play for money I can't get a pair to save my life.  I ate a huge amount of sugar in the form of lemon meringue cookie things from Trader Joe's. I also learned that all Irish Creams are not created equal- the generic brand at Trader Joe's isn't nearly as good as Bailey's.   Topics of the night included the diamond trade, the New Hampshire Primary (my prediction: Kerry, Dean, Clark, Edwards, Leiberman), democracy in general, hideous personal injuries, and the inevitable collapse of the US government due to corruption and general discontent.  And of course I've stayed up entirely too damn late.

      Today at work they had cookies. How am I supposed to maintain my girlish figure when they've got all this candy and cookies lying around for the taking all the damn time?  Star Wars Galaxies has reactivated all the old accounts for a week so that people who quit (like me) can try out the new stuff they've added. I reinstalled, and was immediately struck by how little I wanted to resume playing. I'd assumed that with a few months off I would want to start up again, considering how addictive it had been. But now... I dunno. It just doesn't have much appeal. And I haven't even gotten to the new features yet.  In other news, I'm helping my uncle choose a video camera to buy. He wanted one that burns directly on to DVD, but I really don't think that technology is to the point where it's practical. Once they put Blu Ray DVD technology into those cameras and they can fit more than a measly 30 minutes on a disc, then maybe it'd be worth it. But I think I've sold him on the idea of getting a D8 camera for half the price and then getting a DVD burner so that he can put more than half an hour of video on a disc and make as many copies as he wants. Now I just have to research DVD burners, which is something I've been meaning to do anyway.

      Oh, and I've been watching me some Farscape. I've watched up to episode 6 now. It's not bad- the characters are fairly interesting, the writing is ok, and the acting is ok, the effects are decent, and the puppets are cool. But really the main difference between it and Star Trek is that it doesn't take itself as seriously. Much of it is exactly the same: all of the plots so far have pretty much been done by Star Trek already. D'Argo may as well be a Klingon. A lot of the aliens are simply either bumpy foreheads or else they don't even bother and they look entirely human, maybe with colored contact lenses or skin tone.  I do like that it doesn't take itself seriously. There are a few running gags- for example, Chrichton is constantly making referrence to pop culture and slang that confuses the others, which can be funny.   But, like I said before, it's no Firefly. It doesn't have the same kind of attitude, and while Firefly wasn't entirely original, the stuff they were borrowing from hadn't been done quite as recently as with Farscape- Firefly uses Western plots, Farscape uses Star Trek plots. And while they both have crews of outlaws, Firefly makes better use of that by actually commiting crimes rather than perpetually running. The dialogue was much better too- I can't really think of any lines I found quoteable from Farscape so far, but with Firefly there were probably five or six in the pilot episode alone.  But what they have most in common is that they were both cancelled before their time (at least, from what I've read about Farscape's cancellation). Moreso in Firefly's case- I'd have loved to have had three and a half seasons of Firefly.

      I cannot believe that people are buying into this absurd spin on Howard Dean's Iowa speach. So he yelled and made a funny noise. What the hell does that have to do with how he'd run the country? Anybody who thinks less of him because of this is allowing themselves to become a pawn in George Bush's diabolical game of checkers.  Oh, another thing I hate is the south. I read a while back that their priorities in chosing a candidate are: 1) their stance on national security, and 2) what religion they are. Personally, I think Christians need to be oppressed for a while. You know, have thier churches closed down, ban the display of crosses or the ten commandments, and burning stacks of bibles in the street, just so they remember what it's like. Then they might understand how it's not such a good idea to mix politics and religion.

      Good god, the next time my editor assigns me a meeting to cover, my first question will be "Will it last four fucking hours? 'Cause if so, you're going to have to pay me a hell of a lot more than the pittance you're giving me now." That was bloody painful.  Also, the other reporter came back from her vacation today, so now I'm now even more outnumbered in the gender department. Yippee.  I've decided to start watching Farscape and see if it's anywhere near as good as I keep hearing it is. I've seen a couple of episodes so far, and it's not bad... but it's no Firefly. And I've never really liked the whole biological spaceship thing... but I do like the muppet aliens as opposed to people with bumpy foreheads. I'm going to give it a good chance.

       urlLink The Onion | Yee-Haw! My Vote Cancels Out Y'all's!  This is funny because it's true. At the same time, it's unbelievably sad because it's true. And it makes me very, very afraid because it's true.  This, combined with a (real) article I read about some idiot mouth-breathers who called in to complain that their precious reality show was interrupted by the Iowa caucus, gives me no great faith in democracy. These poeple should be rounded up and subjected to electroshock therapy until they violently lose control of their bowels whenever they see trash television or vote republican.

      Goddamn, I spent two and a half hours walking up and down Castro street today (not the one in SF for those of you imaginary readers who don't know that's the name of the main stretch of downtown Mountain View). Practically no one would answer the question about Bush's space plan. Some would answer, but then refuse to give me a name or let me take a picture, so I couldn't use it. It took me two and a half hours just to get five lousy responses.  On top of that, Howard Dean only placed third in the Iowa primary, behind John Kerry and John Edwards of all people. Thankfully he at least beat Gepheardt. Also, it should be noted that while Dean only got 18% of the vote in Iowa, in '92 Clinton only got 17%. He ain't done yet, and with Gepheardt dropping out, he should do pretty well I think.

      Week 2 of not being fired. Simply astonishing. More shocking still- they actually gave me keys to the office. I guess they figure there's not much of value in there anyway. What am I gonna do, rip off a bunch of PII 300mhz computers with 32mb of RAM each? Hell, if I were them I'd leave the door unlocked at night hoping someone would steal those clunkers and get something decent.  I watched Indiana Jones & The Temple of Doom tonight, and much as it pains me to say it (because this is, after all,an Indiana Jones movie) it sucked as much as the last time I watched it hoping it wouldn't suck as much as the time before. It just goes to prove that any time you add an adoreable little child actor to a successful movie/show you doom it to failure. Plus the writing in this one sucked- you could really hear the George Lucas dialogue. That man can create characters like no one else, but goddamn is he a piss poor writer.   I have no plans whatsoever for the weekend, other than my uncle and his family coming to visit. A Chef Chu's dinner is all but assured. Mmm... kung pow chicken.

      I covered me a real, honest-to-jeebus press conference today. It wasn't quite what I expected... there were only about ten reporters there (including myself) with two TV cameras. There was one guy I'd seen on the local TV news, but I wouldn't have recognized him if I hadn't heard his name mentioned- he's no Kent Brockman. Anyway, the conference was with the director of the Ames Research Center. He was clearly pretty excited about the whole moon/Mars thing.   I was supposed to ask questions about how this would affect Mountain View, but he said he didn't know yet, since they were waiting on Bush's budget that'll be released next month. So I asked if he thought Bush would actually fight for it when Congress goes over the budget- he said he thought he would, because of all the things Bush could have supported he chose NASA.  It'll be a shame when Bush neuters the whole thing... there's no way he'd be able to push it through Congress even if he wanted to. The space program has enough people against it that it's cash-starved even in the best of economic times, and right now we're $500 billion in the hole, and that's before even taking Iraq into account. This is nothing more than Bush taking advantage of the Mars Rover publicity and making people think he gives a rats' ass about space exploration. He'll let this die the same death by underfunding as the Office of Homeland Security and the No Child Left Behind act.

      So Bush wants to go back to the moon. Great... could there be a worse time to spend a few extra billion dollars? I mean, I'm all for space exploration, being a science fiction geek and all, but raising NASA's budget by a billion dollars in the face of a $500 billion deficit?   I suppose I shouldn't be worried- this is, after all, just an election year stunt that will probably be underfunded and forgotten about after Bush takes credit for it, just like the Office of Homeland Security and the No Child Left Behind garbage.  However, this does mean that tomorrow I'm goin' to NASA to cover a press conference thingie with the NASA senate director who's coming back from D.C. I've never done this kind of thing before, so I anticipate failing miserably.

      It's the end of an era- today my dad went to Costco and brought home a case of Costco's generic soda, up until now known as Simply Soda. Now it's been re-branded as Kirkland Signature Cola. This is a travesty! Of course, it costs tastes exactly the same, but the old can was cooler.  I was actually pretty busy at work today. I had to do the damn Voices section for the week, which sucked- the question was asking whether people thought they'd be affected by Arnold's new budget proposal, which should have been interesting. Unfortunately, if anyone actually followed politics they'd never have voted for the jackass in the first place, so no one had any idea what the buget was cutting. It took me like two hours to find six people to answer the damn question. There were a suprising number of people I asked today that didn't speak english, too, which made my life that much more difficult.  On top of that I had to scrap my editorial cartoon idea- apparently having Arnold shaking a mayor by the ankles "wasn't Mountain View enough" for the publisher guy... but I don't know how I'm supposed to do something Mountain View specific in relation to a state-wide buget.  And then my editor asked me to cover a meeting of the Mountain View school district board commitee on determining criteria for figuring out which school to close. So I went- for two and a half hours. Boring, boring, boring stuff... the article I'm going to write on it tomorrow should be equally thrilling.   And that was my day. My life is an endless thrillride, no doubt about it.

      Big Fish was a very good movie. It was a very different movie for Tim Burton. While it deffinately had his fingerprints all over it, it was about a guy coming to understand his father through his tall tales- much more of a tear-jerker thank most of Burton's dark, creepy movies. I admit, I was a little dissapointed by the special effects- maybe I've been spoiled by LOTR and The Matrix movies, but I wasn't really looking for that kind of thing in Big Fish. I was hoping for more Moulin Rouge-esqe subtle and surreal effects. There was some of that, but not as much as I'd have liked. I'm also confused now, because I don't know whether Ewan McGregor is going to look like Alec Guiness when he gets old or if he's going to look like the old guy in this movie.  And of course I got to hang out with Tasha, which is always fun. She's talking about maybe going to grad school in Denmark or somewhere equally European, and while that'd be cool an' all, I'd miss her an' stuff.  I drew and re-drew my Arnold cartoon today, and I have it almost to the point where I'd be satisfied. I just watched a few Justice League episodes to figure out how to draw enormous, freakishly buff people.  I really enjoyed seeing the 60 Minutes interview with Bush's former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neal, who called Bush "disengaged," "a blind man in a room full of deaf people," and said that Bush never asked any questions during meetings. He said Bush was surrounded by a "praetorian guard" consisting of Cheney, Rove, and Rumsfeld who kept him from hearing dissenting opinions, and was hell-bent on invading Iraq from day one of taking office, basically saying "go find me a way to do this." It'd be great to see this give Bush enough of a black eye to really give the Democrats the advantage... too bad no one reads in this country.  Then I went over to Jesse's and watched the surprisingly good Pirates of The Caribbean with him and Alex Joshi. Favorite quote: "You are without a doubt the worst pirate I've ever heard of." "Ah, but you  have  heard of me."

      I got my first pay check in the mail today (no affiliation with the Ben Afleck movie of the same name). I use the term "paid" loosely, as they actually describe my compensation as a "stipend." Suffice it to say, if I weren't living at home still I would be living in the gutter.   But nevertheless, I started working on my Arnold Schwarzenegger caricature today, and I think I've come up with something that looks enough like him that I won't be embarassed to have it printed in the paper. Hopefully when they pay me for the cartoon along with the other random tasks my pay desciption will be upgraded from "stipend" to "pitance." A guy can dream, can't he?  So today I didn't have to work- it's so sad that I'm relieved to have a couple of days off from my four hour a day job. I guess it's a good thing I started small, otherwise the shock of acutally working for a living might have put me in a coma.  Instead, today I went with Jesse to a joint birthday mini-gathering for Alex Joshi and Benn Meyers and had pizza and ice cream. They were going to go see Big Fish, but I'm seeing it tomorrow so I bailed out of that and ruined it for Jesse in the process, since he was my ride. So instead we went to hang out with Jesse's Tower buddies, who then decided we should go see a movie. No one bothered to call ahead, so when we got there we decided that there wasn't anything worth seeing within a reasonable amount of time, so we went back to Tower and hung out in the parking lot 'till everyone went home. Pretty exciting, huh?

      Made it through the week without being fired. I think I've earned a nice pat on the head... now pay up damn you!  I saw Arcia today when he came in to apply for the sports writer job at The Voice. It'd be nice to keep the Talon domination in there- as it is, only two of the writers (one of whom I haven't even met yet because she's been on vacation) weren't on the Talon staff at some point. I guess that's not counting some of the freelance people who do resturaunt reviews and stuff, but they're not important.  I might be getting some editorial cartoons printed in The Voice too- I've got to start working on my Arnold Schwarzenegger caricature.   I also finally talked to Tasha Shapiro over AIM- we're seeing a movie on Sunday. Probably Big Fish.  My mom managed to drop her cell phone at the airport while she was dropping off my aunt this week, and before someone found it and called it was apparently run over by a car. So it no longer gets reception at all. Now I'm searching eBay for a replacement... it's bloody astonishing how many cell phones are on there. People go through them like moist towlettes. Fortunately that means we'll be able to get one fairly cheap.

      Yes, I definately have a cold. I'm sniffling, my neck is stiff, I'm tired (though I haven't been sleeping well lately, so that might be part of it) and my throat is sore. It sucks.  On the bright side, I still haven't been fired. Tomoorow will make one whole work week of not being fired, which I think is quite an accomplishment.   So yeah, other than being sick and managing not to get fired, I did virtually nothing today. Thrilling, aren't I?

      Still not fired. Of course, I think I'm getting a cold... both my parents have colds, so I'm just playing catch up.   So Jesse and I watched a bunch of Sports Night episodes tonight. Damn that's a funny show. Aaron Sorkin is one of the best dialogue writers ever. Him and Joss Whedon. There's just a huge amount of fast-paced incredibly witty banter that's so good that you have to try contain your laughter just so you don't laugh too loud and miss another great line. And naturally, since it was great, it only lasted two seasons- though for once it wasn't Fox's fault.

      Well, I'm not fired yet.  I did the cop log today, which involved calling up the police information officer and trying to figure out what interesting crimes happend this week. As it turns out this was bad week for it- it was a quantity over quality in the world of crime. After that, I called the executive director of the local community access TV station and listened to him spout a bunch of meaningless numbers at me, which I have to turn into an article in another week.   Lunch with Pat Neal tomorrow... if I can get my ass out of bed in time to get down town before noon. God I'm lazy. Of course, right now I'm making that less and less likely by staying up for no reason watching Family Guy.

      Lookit me! I work! I work!  I'd never have done thunk it my own self, but I actually have a job. I worked me a solid five hour day down at yonder office. Well, a portion of that was spent wandering Castro Street asking people if they were concerned about Mad Cow Disease (a surprising number of the people I asked actually were afraid... crazy hypocondriacs) but you get the idea.   I can't believe we're not covering the Britney Spears wedding. I mean, whatever happened to journalistic responsiblity?  Jesse and I finished watching my Firefly DVDs tonight, and my anger at Fox for canceling it is freshly renewed. Goddamn are they stupid- litterally the best science fiction show I've seen in a decade, and they cancel it after 14 episodes, which they ran out of order (and three of them they didn't run at all) in a shitty timeslot and preempted for baseball half the time. Thank Jeebus Universal bought the rights and is planning to turn it into a movie. That had better get made, or I will have to kill someone/thing.

      My computer nearly gave me a heart attack today. I started it up, played around for about an hour, and then I foolishly tried to open Outlook to check my spam. For some reaons that causes a crash, and when I hit reset I couldn't boot back up. I even tried to boot off of the XP CD to try to do a repair, but it wouldn't even get into the installer. So I figured it must be a RAM problem. Sure enough, when I popped out one of my two 256MB chips and rebooted it came right up.  So I spent like four hours letting it run RAM diagnostics on first one chip, then the other, and then both. Never once did any of the tests fail. And then after all that I just tried to boot up like normal again and viola, it works fine. It could be that there was dust on the connectors or something, and pulling out the DIMMs and putting them back in cleared them off enough to fix it. Or it could have been some kind of voodoo curse... either way, I'm glad not to have to shell out more cash for more crappy budget RAM. Hopefully it won't do that too often.

      Holy oversleeping Batman! Now, I know I was up 'till 4 last night, but that is no excuse for sleeping until 2:45pm today. I woke up at 10 when my alarm went off, but I'd only had 6 hours, so I killed it and went back to sleep thinking I'd wake up at 11 or 12. What the hell was that about?  We finally made some progress watching Firefly though- we're down to the final four episodes.

      And here I thought that I was going to be able to stick to my pseudo-diet over the holidays. Oh no no no- not with family in town and New Year's gatherings and stuff like that. Chef Chu's is far to expensive for me to not eat everything in front of me, especially when I'm not paying. I would say I've set the cause of my weight loss back by at least a week, maybe more. I'm actually afraid to weigh myself, but I'm sure my morbid curiosity will overcome my vanity at some point.  At this rate I will never actually finish watching my Firefly DVDs. Tonight we were going to watch some more, but we went over to Alex's house to watch them and he hadn't seen any of it, so we had to re-watch the pilot, and after that we got caught up in a discussion about Batman and Star Wars, so we made no actual progress. Dissapointing, especially since we haven't gotten to my favorite block of episodes yet.  Oh, I picked up a nice little 6 format memory card reader from Fry's today for $16 before a $12 rebate so that I can read my camera's SD card from my laptop. It's kind of pissy that the damn thing has a funky unique USB connection between the camera and the cradle, so I can't just plug a USB cable into the bottom of the camera and use it as a reader. But for $4 I fixed that problem, so I'm not too terribly upset about it.  I saw my first published work in the Mountain View Voice today... if you count regurgitating some quotes and crime reports as published work. I also had a total of six photos from the aformentioned camera in this week's issue. Yay me.

      Ah good, Blogger's working again. They seemed to be having a bit of trouble with that pesky y2k4 bug.  New Year's was fun, though we didn't end up using the hot tub (would have been lots of fun the pouring rain). Thank Jeebus for cheap ass champaign from Safeway. Two bottles of Cook's for $7. It didn't even taste bad- probably nothing like what champaign is supposed to taste like, but hell, champaign is supposed to come from Champaign, France, and this stuff most certainly didn't make that trip. 'Twas, as always, good to see Ryan and Kelsey and Kat.  So I'm going to start showing up regluarly at the Voice next week. I went in to talk to the editor today, and she said she'd like to have me come in from 1-5 Monday through Friday. That works great for me, since I won't have to get up early or anything. I've already had two short articles assigned to me that I can write Monday/Tuesday. Oh, and the editor said that she might have use for some cartoons (if there's any money for it) since she says that currently they just have a folder full of random cartoons from some guy in Washington or something that they use as space filler.

      I went to the bars in downtown Palo Alto last night and got fairly drunk with Jesse, Jon, and Joe. We spent most of the night at Nola's, where they make a decent white Russian but are inconsistent with the cherries. Jon is a bastard- he went and bought us a round of what he said were snakebites- whiskey and lime juice or something like that- but what he actually gave us were prairie fires: a shot of tequila with tobasco sauce. Thank jeebus that the three drinks I'd had before that had numbed my mouth a bit, or that would have been excruciatingly painful.   So then we left, and Joe (who'd proclaimed himself DD after his first drink) decided that we all needed some water, so we went to the bar at the Cheesecake Factory and promptly ordered another round of drinks. After Jon broke a glass without even noticing, we tipped the bartender generously and finally got out of there at around 12:45, (they had last call at 12:15, the losers). I think I got through the night only $40 poorer.  Joe took us back to Jesse's place, and Jon and I crashed there because all our cars were still in downtown PA, and we figured it'd be easier if we all caught the same ride down there today. Alex won that privilege, and earned a free lunch for his trouble.  So today I was going to do a lot of vote tabulating... well, I've done a few of them... I need to spend a couple more hours on it tonight and maybe a couple more tomorrow morning, because there's going to be a fresh pile waiting for me when I show up at work tomorrow.  Return of The King just won all 11 Oscars it was nominated for. 'Tis an impressive achievement for the scifi/fantasy genre, though arguable the competition wasn't very stiff this year.  Oh, one more thing: on the way to a "crab-feed" that the Mountain View Rotary Club was having in a Buddhist temple of all places (I think a lot of those crabs were reincarnated republicans), I saw some people playing a game in a park that looked like a cross between badmittin and hacky sack, which I have dubbed "Badsack." So, if I make some comment about playing badsack, that's the context behind it. I'm certainly not actually playing it, and if I say it the game in question is most likely not what I'm referring to at all, I just think it sounds funny and dirty as hell.

      Remember that part where I said "sign me up" to tabulate votes? I take it back. This is painfully dull... it takes about an hour to do 12-15 of these things, and I've got about 60 to do over the weekend. The worst part is the page turning.  Grosse Point Blank is a really, really good movie.

      So tomorrow I get to go in and start tabulating "Best of Mountain View 2004" ballots we've printed in our last two issues. Our office manager has been doing it for the past week or so, but now she's sick of it so it's getting handed off to the intern (aka cheap labor). Of course, at $8 per hour it's still more than I usually make, so sign me up.  The really amusing part about these ballots is that there are a bunch of beauty salons that have been trying to rig the vote. Apparently they take whole stacks of the paper out of the boxes (it's a free paper) and ask their customers to fill it out, and then fill in their name in the best beauty salon slot. It's pretty shameless- the handwriting and often the ink is different. If you're going to cheat, at least put a little effort into it, will you?

      Sports Night DVDs showed up today... I've already started watching The West Wing though, so I think I'll hold off on watching Sports Night until I finish with West Wing.  Tomorrow I have to get up at a reasonable hour in order to cover some kindergarten (I can never get over how freaking  German  that word is... what are they, the Hitler Youth?) being sickeningly adorable. It's some Big Buddies program at Crittenden Jr. High where some fourth graders are probably going to grudgingly show them what's in store for them, and teach them a few dirty words.   Speaking of people who use the word "gay" as a derogatory, I like how Bush has now come out in favor of this ridiculous Constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. Now, ten or twenty years down the line when gay marriage has become commonplace, Bush will be looked back on as the George Wallace of our time.

      West Wing = good.  Question of the week: How do you think Ralph Nader's candidicy will affect the presidential race?  Surprisingly, most of the people I talked to didn't think it would have an impact. Personally, I think we need every last vote to get Bush out of The Whitehouse. The Democrats have strong poll numbers now, but Bush hasn't even tapped into his $150 million warchest yet, and people are painfully gullible.  The most annoying part was that I probably had to ask 10 people before I found one person that would even listen to the question. People were awfully busy today.

      I'm getting worried- my hopes are high for the new Batman movie. The cast is looking sweet- Christian Bale will probably do a respectable job as Batman, but what's got me excited is Liam Neeson as Ra's Al Ghul and Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox (ok, so that's a minor role, but it's Morgan Freeman). Christopher Nolan, who directed and co-wrote Momento, is directing and co-writing this. The problem is that also listed as co-writer is David Goyer, who has his name on the Blade movies. "Look out! Light! *dodge*" The only good thing on his IMDB resume is Dark City, and he probably just messed with the screenplay a bit. But despite him, I'm really hoping that this will revive the Batman franchise. At least it can't be as bad as the last two.

      An update for all of those people who like to buy me stuff for no reason: Come May 11, the Invader Zim DVDs are coming out. Buy them for me, dammit.   I've said it before, and I'll say it again: people that have more than three or four kids are completely insane. I was doing some computer work for this family that has like TEN CHILDREN, and the constant screaming and shrieking in that house is unbarable, so say nothing of there being a 10 year old getting in the way so often I thought he was psychic- he knew where I wanted to be before I did, and made sure he was already there. Yelling. I had trouble standing it in that house for two hours (it wouldn't have taken me half that long if they'd told a couple of details about the phone system ahead of time or had a computer that didn't suck), I have no idea how anyone could endure living there.

      Wow, a whole day with no one killing themselves within a mile of the office. The fire department did have a training thing where they closed down a street and torched a condemned building though, so I didn't go a day without seeing a bunch of emergency vehicles.  Only other thing to report was drinking and a bad horror movie called Cabin Fever at Neil's. Man was it bad... You'd think we'd have moved beyond the low-budget horror genre in this day and age, but noooo. It was pretty funny/bad.

      Howard Dean, we hardly knew ye.  It's amazing how the media just built him up in order to tear him down... for months it was all about his runaway grass-roots/internet campaign, then suddenly he places third in Iowa and makes a funny noise and it's all about Kerry and Edwards. Plus everybody kept saying he was too liberal, which is garbage. He wasn't any more liberal than John Kerry. Maybe even less so, if Kerry's big on gun control, which Dean wasn't. People are such idiot sheep.  Anyway, I actually got up at a respectable hour today, and it paid off. Our secretary was out sick, so I got called in to man the phones, which pays substantially better than my typical rate. I got about $11 bucks an hour for just sitting around and transferring calls to people's voice mail boxes. Not too shabby- should make up for a relatively light workload this week come payday. I also got assigned a full page "best of Mountain View" dealie we do every year, which will apparently pay pretty well also.  And while I was in the middle of a very dull article about Arbor Day, a bunch of police cars drove by the office window. Turns out we just had our second suicide within walking distance of the office, this one involving a train near the intersection of Castro and Central. Some lady parked her beige minivan by the tracks, waited for the train, and jumped in front of it. Apparently downtown Mountain View is a popular area to commit suicide in a public place. Of course, I still haven't gotten a name on that guy who shot himself in the park behind city hall a couple of weeks ago, because they haven't found the next of kin yet.  I talked to a Caltrain representitve who showed up at the scene who said that train conductors have a very high rate of post traumatic stress because of people killing themselves on the train tracks- the conductors see the people in the way, but the train takes half a mile to stop, so there's nothing they can do about it except blow their whistle and watch the show.   Also, these people are very inconsiderate with their timing. Both times it's been just after we've gone to press, so as a weekly, we look really slow when it happens on a Wednesday and then our issue comes out on Thursday with nothing about it, then the following Thursday our article shows up. This time I got it written in time to go on the online version of the paper, but I don't know whether I get paid for that. Oh well, it'd only be like $15 anyway. On the other hand, I just spent $24 filling up my 13 gallon gas tank.

      What lovely weather we're having. Early on it was just windy, but then it started pouring and the power went off and on at work like a strobe light. I was litterally mid-click on the save button on my article when it went out, prompting a loud  "Fuck!"  that was fortunately drowned out by the other reporters cries of dismay. Then the power came on just long enough for me to finish my article again, thankfully letting me save it to the server before dying again. But combined with the fact that we were already behind due to having yesterday off, losing electricity was a very bad thing.  By the way, if anyone wants to buy me stuff (and really, who doesn't?) I nominate the DVDs of The Critic ($35) and, come March 9, Futurama Season 3.

      I just ordered the Sports Night DVDs with a gift certificate to Barns & Noble I got for Christmas. I broke down and bought it after I couldn't find it anywhere on Direct Connect or Bittorrent. It's a sad, sad world when a show that good goes unappreciated by the pirate community.  You know, gift certificates are an ingenius idea for businesses. First of all, they get the money up front. Ain't nothing to complain about there- it's a guaruntee that it'll be spent there. But the real genius is that in order to spend the entire thing, you have to get something that costs more than the certificate is worth, or else you waste some money. So unless you manage to find something that's the exact correct price, you're either going to spend more than the certificate's worth, which is just more money for the business, or else you spend less than it's worth and you essentially overpay for what you did get. Devious, just devious. In my case, I ended up paying $14 more than my certificate was worth. And had I not had that certificate, I would have gone to Amazon.com which is selling the Sports Night DVDs for $45 instead of the $54 I paid at Barns & Noble. Oh well, if my money and I weren't soon parted they'd have to change that expression.  By the way, I SUCK at chess now. I haven't played in years, and I'm just getting massacred in like 15 moves by every little free 250K chess program I download.

      Hm... remember all that work I was going to get done today? Predictably enough, nothing got done. And I have no excuse what so ever- I was just sitting around all day being painfully bored, moreso than usual. There's just nowhere to go around here to hang out... I mean, I could go to a bar, but a) it's a Monday, so there wouldn't be many people there, and b) I can't afford to go very often. Drinks ain't cheap.   Oh well... I guess I'll just concentrate on my super-villiany. Like all true evil geniuses, complete global domination is just  phase one  of my plan.

      Went and watched Rear Window with Jesse, Alex, Chris Rini, and Liz something-or-other. I hadn't seen that movie since high school film class. Gotta love Hitchcock.   Then we went back to Jesse's place and watched some Firefly and West Wing. I've decided I need to go back and watch Sports Night and West Wing, just because Aaron Sorkin is a freaking incredible writer.   The Simpsons episode tonight was pretty decent... they had some good jokes that could have come from earlier seasons, but also a few recycled jokes and stuff.

I personally celebrated by going to Ugly's bar and drinking the night away, making this the best Valentine's Day to date.   I ran into Cathrine Salmon there, who I haven't seen since high school. Of course, I also accidentally walked into the women's bathroom after I'd had a couple... fortunately the girl that was in there was very understanding of my confusion and spared me a well-deserved pepper-spraying.

      Well isn't this nice... the 2005-2006 broadcast TV season will be reducing the number of remotely watchable shows from three to two, since they went and canceled Angel on me. The network executives seem to have a problem with their brains being missing. Yes, let's cancel one of the best written shows on TV and replace it with some reality bullshit to try to catch the tail end of this (hopefully) dying fad... brilliant strategum.

      Since I first called for the elimination of stupid people some time ago, we, as a people, have made shamefully little progress. Today,there are just as many if not more stupid people roaming our streets, attending our churches and schools (mostly the churches), and being elected to high office.   So once again I call upon all Americans to do their part in the noble crusade of eliminating stupid people, whether that be wholesale slaughter of theaters full of people who pay to see movies like Tomb Raider, or simply infecting a creationist with an antibiotic-resistant strain of TB bacteria and asking them if they believe in evolution  now . It is time for rational thinking people to stand up and kick idiocy in the groin.  Speaking of kicking people in the groin- Monday I have to go out and ask people if they think gay marraige should be legal, and I'm going to have to work very very hard not to allow myself to reflexively wound the people that say it should be illegal. These are people that simply do not understand the way America is supposed to work- the government is not supposed to be able to tell you how to live, especially when it comes to a religious institution like marraige. Hell, the government shouldn't even give a rat's ass if people consider themselves married or not. You should be able to give all the inheritance rights and insurance benefits to whoever the hell you want without having to go through a religious cerimony. But anyway, I'm unfortunately not going to have the time to lecture these idiots on the basics of a free society.  In other news, I read that the script for the upcomming Firefly movie is being rewritten as less of an epilogue to the show and more of a springboard for a potential return to the series, which would be awesome. I finished watching Farscape the other day, and it was pretty good (well, the last episode was sorta crappy) but I think Firefly ruined me for all other science fiction. I have yet to see the first 14 episodes of any show that has hooked me like Firefly did. So, just to bring this back to my starting point, I think all the Fox executives should be rounded up and given new jobs as part of this new space program. Not as astronauts, per se, but rather as cushioning to soften the landing of a particularly heavy spaceship.

      Bah. The Tower management has been told not to talk to press about the bankruptcy... maybe I can get around that.   While I was there I read a few pages of Michael Savage's "The Enemy Within," which is just another rabid conservative jackass's book where he uses the word "liberal" as if it's a dirty word. I couldn't stand reading much of that dreck, but the funniest thing I saw was him bitching about how "libs" have caused the degredation of society. As an example, he said (and I paraphrase) "I was watching The Sopranos on HBO, which is the only reason I got the channel to begin with. After it ended, I kept watching. The next show was [lists a bunch of stuff about kinky sex and stretching anuses]. I pray to God that I could go back in time and purge those images from my memory. It should be illegal for HBO to pipe that kind of thing into America's homes!"  The man is a fucking idiot. First of all, he was watching the Sopranos, which is not exactly Family Fun Hour. They have constant profanity and graphic violence, and occasional nudity. If you open the door to censorship, we don't get to watch that either, will we dumbass? Second of all, he PAID to get that. If he doesn't want it, he should either cancel his subscription or TURN THE FUCKING TV OFF, you IMBICILE. No one is forcing you to watch a goddamn thing.   Then he went on to complain about how gambling and pornography are legal now but they weren't when he was growing up and now the country's all voilent and evil and liberal. I don't know if that fool was simply not paying attention or if he's just brain dead, but making things illegal does not make them go away. See prohibition circa 1920, or marijuana for the past thirty years.   Nothing pisses me off more than seeing dipshit rabid conservative loudmouths like him in the best sellers section.

It sent itself to at least five or six people, so I had to go around sending people the removal instructions, which are  urlLink here  if you need them.  So my first article for this week will be on the Tower Records bankruptcy. Should be fun... I know people on the inside, and all. Fortunately the store is on the Mountain View side of El Camino, so they're in our territory. Of course, it's looking like it's just going to be about how nothing's going to happen for a while at least, since no one there is worried about losing any jobs right now. But oh well, I'm not going to complain about an easy article.

      Today was full of candy, pizza, and beer. You know, all the stuff I'm pretending to be avoiding these days. But hey, strict adherance to a diet is, in my rationalizing mind, dumb. One of the best things about abstaining from those things is that when you finally do break down and eat them again they taste that much better- it's more of a treat this way.  And of course I won at poker again, because there was no real money involved. I have to figure out a way to fake out my luck somehow so that someday I'll actually win some cash.

       urlLink MSNBC - Bush defends service record in NBC interview  On “Meet the Press,” Bush said, “I put in my time, proudly so.” When pressed by Russert on why news reporters who previously investigated the charge could find no records of his Alabama service, Bush said, “They’re just wrong. There may be no evidence, but I did report; otherwise, I wouldn’t have been honorably discharged. In other words, you don’t just say ‘I did something’ without there being verification. Military doesn’t work that way. I got an honorable discharge, and I did show up in Alabama.”  So let me get this straight... First he says they're wrong to say that he went AWOL from his National Guard post for at least seven months (see www.awolbush.com). Then he says there's no evidence showing that he did show up. Then he says he wouldn't say he did something unless there was verification. Then he said he did it. Sheesh, I can see we're well on our way to Vol. III of Bushisms.   I managed to screw up my very first attempt at burning a DVD today. Of course, strictly speaking it wasn't my fault- what screwed it up was I'd unplugged the camera after it finished importing because my uncle was in a hurry to leave and I was packing stuff up. For some reason the stupid burning program wouldn't have that and aborted the process, producing a nice $1 coaster. Why the hell did it need the camera attached while it was burning? Blarg.

      Family day today... not much got done. I went to pick up my brother from Stanford, and we went to an overpriced bike shop so he could buy a few spare innertubes and patches and a pump. Of course, he'd forgotten his wallet, so Jim now owes me $24. I looked around at all the bikes and marveled at how much the damn things cost. Who pays $4000 for a damn bike? This ain't the Tour De France here. I'd be willing to pay $3-400 ish, but that'd about be my limit, since there's a ton of extra stuff I'd have to buy along with it, ie helmet, lock, etc.  Right now I'm trying to burn a DVD. My family got a burner for my uncle for his birthday, and now it's my job to figure out how to make the damn thing work. Burning a data DVD would be easy, but burning a video DVD is proving more difficult. The tools they give you just aren't smart enough. Hopefully I'll be able to finish this damn thing in time to get to bed at a reasonable hour... as if it weren't already 2:20.

I could've stayed there overnight but for some reason felt like driving home. I guess I just felt like driving.   At work, I finally vanquished the evil jar of red hots that was making me eat lots of sugar. I can resist chocolate, ice cream, or whatever, but if you put cinnamon in front of me I'm a gonner. I'll eat red hots or hot tamales or whatever until I lose the ability to taste for three days. Right now my tongue is a little on the sore side.

      Amazingly enough, I didn't see any dead bodies today. Maybe that was because I showed up half an hour late and left twenty minutes early... I must have just missed today's corpse.   I didn't skimp on work for the normal reason, which is that I'm lazy. In fact, I'd showed up early yesterday to go to NASA and I had an event to cover tonight, so I'd put in plenty of extra time already.  I have been very cruel to my mouth today- I keep eating things that are entirely too hot. First there was the burrito at lunch that I microwaved just a bit too long. Then there was the chai tea that I couldn't be bothered to wait for to cool. Right now the roof of my mouth is not a happy mouth roof. Technically, shouldn't it be the ceiling of your mouth? The roof would go over the ceiling, which would be more akin to your hair... stupid misleading figure of speech.  I'm going to Santa Cruz this weekend. Not sure when or for how long... I haven't thought that far ahead. All I know is it's bound to happen at some point. I haven't been down there since New Year's... people are probably starting to forget how annoying I am. Can't have that.

      Well, wasn't today interesting. I went to NASA again and listened to them give me pretty much no new information for two hours. And for that I got up early.   I wrote an article about it anyway though. A nice short uninformative article that pretty much repeated everything I'd written last time. But that wasn't the interesting part.  The interesting part was when I was having my conversation with the police information officer getting the week's juicey cop gossip when he all of the sudden said he had to go because they'd just found a dead body in the park behind Mountain View City Hall. So I got to go down there and try to take pictures of a corpse. Turned out some poor schmoe had gone down to the park at about 3p.m. and shot himself. I'd never seen a dead body before- even the relatives of mine who've died have been cremated before I saw them. Of course, it's still hard to say I've seen one... all I could really see was his hand, which was nasty looking, but still.   And once again I got shorted on information. All they gave me was that it was probably a suicide. So I could barely write any kind of article about it, and they won't release any information, like who the guy was, until they notify the next of kin, which will most likely be after deadline tomorrow.

      I got my very first email from someone saying I'd misquoted them in an article today! Huzzah! Of course, it turned out to be something minor that, when taken incontext, wasn't a misquotation at all, and my editor decided it wasn't even worth running a correction. But I'll still treasure it always.   I'm going back to NASA tomorrow for another press conference dohicky. Should be fun. Last time was by far the most interesting thing I've covered... it sure beats listening to committee members go on and on about inconsequential details of recomendations to make to the people who actually make decisions. Tomorrow should be a pretty busy day though, since I've got two articles to write and then the whole police blotter thing to deal with.

      I put together a respectable computer for my brother today for under $300. Well, there were a few scavanged parts, but still a pretty impressive feat. I got a Athlon XP 2600+ chip, a motherboard with an nForce2 chipset, 256MB of Kingston RAM, a 40GB hard disk, and a case with a 300w power supply for under $300, anyway.  I canibalized my brother's old computer for a CD drive and floppy drive, and also moved over his old 1GB drive for the hell of it rather than just transferring it over the network and saving myself some grief. I also tried to use the old computer's graphics card, but that didn't work. It freaked me out- for some reason when that thing was plugged in I couldn't even get power to the CD drive. I thought my power source was bad or something at first. I was about to pull my GeForce4 out of my computer to test it when I remembered I still had my very first graphics card, a 16MB TNT2, lying around in a box somewhere. I dug that out and it worked fine... well, as well as could be expected for a TNT2.   The next hurdle was trying to get the old 1GB drive hooked up. I fought with it trying to get it to not try to boot Windows 95 off of that drive for a while before realizing that it did in fact have jumpers, but they were on the front of the drive rather than the back like every other damn drive I've even seen.  But in the end, I got the thing working pretty well I think. I had a curious problem with the CD audio playback. It was very stuttery and made Winamp very crashy... I choose to blame that on the CD drive, which made some funky sounding noises of its own.  In other news, I'm thinking of switching from using DeadAIM to Aimutation. It looks like it's caught up in features, plus it supports skinning AND it's free. Can't really go wrong with that. It also has real-time chat logging, so if something happens and AIM crashes halfway through a conversation you don't lose it like you do with DeadAIM. I'll give it a test run anyway, and see how I like it.  Oh, and I've finally entered the top 100 on the LSN elite league ladder. Not bad for someone just recovered from a losing streak that sent me down into the vet league.  And no, I didn't watch the Superbowl.

       urlLink Air America Radio  Al Franken's radio show started up today. Unfortnately I didn't figure out that the time on the site is for the Eastern timezone, so I only caught the last half hour of it. It wasn't bad- Michael Moore was on, and I heard Al Gore call in (though he didn't have a whole lot to say). I hear Al did a good Donald Rumsfeld impresionation that I missed. Anyway, I now have some motivation to get up by 9. For the time being the only way I have of listening to the show is a realaudio stream off of the site I linked above, but the site also says that a San Francisco AM station will be carrying the show soon, so that should improve.  South Park tonight was pretty good- they made fun of The Passion. They went a little over the top with Mel Gibson, but it was amusing none the less.  And tomorrow is April Fools' Day... I may as well unplug my internet connection, because you can't trust a damn thing online on April 1st. Who am I kidding, you can't trust anything online the other 364 days either- at least tomorrow I'll get a few decent laughs out of it.

       urlLink Amazon.com: DVD: Star Wars Trilogy (Widescreen Edition) (1977)  Amazon.com is taking pre-orders for the Original Star Wars Trilogy on DVD, to be released September 21. And they've got a damn good price on it too- $42 for three awesome movies. Hey Jim, guess what you're getting for your birthday this year. I don't care if you don't have a DVD player.  My one regret is that it's the Special Editions... I'd be fine with the SE versions of The Empire Strikes Back and Return of The Jedi, but the changes to A New Hope where Greedo shoots first and Han steps on Jabba's tail really detract from Han's character. And Jabba's for that matter. Oh well, I guess I can't complain about Star Wars on DVD for a very reasonable price.  And I need more DVDs. Jesse and I finished Futurama Season 3 tonight, which means I'm down to just Sports Night. Once I'm done with that, all I'll have left to do is go back and watch the commentary tracks on Futurama... then maybe Firefly again. And then maybe I'll rewatch the other two season of Futurama I've got... and then maybe seasons 2 and 3 of The Simpsons. Ok, so I don't really need more DVDs... but what kind of nerd would I be if I didn't preorder Star Wars on DVD at the earliest possible moment?

      I think Yahoo was having spam filter problems yesterday. I had like 50 pieces of spam get through both their filters and mine, which is a pretty obscene jump from recent months. Normally only one or two a day make it past. Today I've only gotten a couple, so either they fixed the problem or figured out how people were getting around their filters.  The question of the week: Have the rising gas prices caused you to drive less? Not a whole lot of interesting answers, as you might imagine.  I'm goin' over to Jesse's to watch True Romance, which as it turns out is a Quentin Tarentino movie I haven't seen.

      Disc 3 of Futurama down. Uno mas. This disc seemed to be not quite as good as the last... probably because there weren't any Zap Brannigan episodes. But it had its moments, such as the Space Pope and the Harlem Globetrotters coming to Earth from their home planet and challanging Earth, for no reason, to a basketball game. Oh, and "I can't sing about something I'm not- that'd be like Christina Aguliara singing in Spanish!" Still not quite as good as Disc 2's Hypno-Toad.  Also funny was watching Condaliza Rice saying that she'd really like to testify in the public 9/11 hearings, but shucks, there's no precident for a sitting national security advisor testifying. What the hell kind of argument is that? Why they're not subpeonaing that woman is beyond me. She's apparently the only member of the Bush or Clinton administration that has refused to testify. Gee, could she possibly have something to hide?  I can't figure out for the life of me why car makers even give you the option of leaving your headlights on. Especially in the case of my car, where leaving the headlights on after you turn the car off turns off the main lights and turns on the parking lights, which as far as I know are entirely useless. This makes it less noticable that you've left your lights on but still drains your battery. And if you wanted to leave the lights on for whatever reason, you can't without leaving the car running. What the hell is the thinking behind that?

      For some reason I had the strange desire to watch Epsiode II tonight. Man, I sort of regret that... Just about every line felt like I was being bludgeoned with a shovel. Sweet merciful crap is the dialogue bad. And it's not just the written dialogue, it's the delivery. Good delivery could have saved about a third of those lines, but as it was half the time it sounded like they were just whining and the other half it sounded like a high school drama production (no offense Jamie). George Lucas really, really needs to stop screenwriting and directing and stick to just making stuff up and letting other people run with it.  I also watched two epsiodes of Wonderfalls. Man is that show wierd... the three episodes so far have all been very different. I like the randomness and the sarcastic sense of humor, though I'm not big on the romantic aspect of the show which for some reason makes me think of Felicity despite never having seen an episode of that show.   The rest of my day was fairly uneventful, but considering the rest of my day began at noon that's not really saying much. Hell, I've only been up for 12 hours. I suppose the highlight of the day was the purchase of new pants. Huzzah for my pants.

      I can't bloody believe it- just when I thought I was out, they pulled me back in. The stupid Best Of crap has come back to haunt me. The real estate people weren't happy with the way their category was done (half of which was not my fault) and so I had to redo a couple of them to be printed in next week's issue. Bunch of picky bastards. Anyway, NOW I think it's over.  I applied for a job today. I know this is going to sound like a repeat, but it's an assistant editor position at PC Gamer. No, not IGN.com- this one's an honest-to-jeebus print publication with a 2.2 million monthly distribution. I really would like to get this job... working part time is nice and all, what with the ability to stay out all night and sleep 'till noon, but I ain't never going to move out making what I make. And this is one of the few chances I'm going to have at doing something I'd really enjoy the hell out of and get paid for it.  Unfortunately I managed to spot this job listing on a Friday, and didn't get it sent in until long after business hours, so the earliest I can expect to get turned down is probably the middle of next week. And more discouraging still is the facat that the job was listed a couple of weeks ago, and despite the fact that the opening is still on their website it could have been filled by now. Hell, my job is still listed as open on the Voice website... I keep answering the phone and having people ask about the Intern job. Well, there's a slight chance that those poor schmucks will be in luck soon. I'm sure as hell rooting for them.   We killed disc II of Futurama at Jesse's tonight. God bless the "play all" feature. I am of course going to have to go back and watch all these again with the commentary tracks on. Gotta get my money's worth out of these babies, you know.

      It's amazing- whenever I go to bed drunk, I wake up at 7. Of course, it's because I'm thirsty as hell, and after I've downed a couple of glasses of water I go right back to bed, but it's still amazing how consistant I am. And somehow I wasn't hung over at all.  The Best Of Mountain View thing I've been bitching and moaning about for the past few weeks finally came out today. Man is it lame. Pages and pages of what are essentially ads. And what I really don't get is, after these places get the free advertising in the form of being called the best of Mountain View, they for some reason feel compelled to buy another ad to go next to the blurb. I don't get it. I also don't understand why my parents insist on complementing me on what a good job I did. First of all, they're not exactly outstanding. And second, they're freaking  ads.   Anyway, work was a bit slow today- it seemed like all the stories I have have kind of fallen through for one reason or another, so I spent most of the day reading up on this whole censorship deal that's going on now. It seems that March is National Trample The First Amendment Month. Who knew? Congress is passing a bill that will raise the maximum fines the FCC can impose on a TV or radio station from $27,000 to $500,000 for "indecency." What exactly is indecent? Pretty much whatever the FCC says it is. From what I hear, the official definition is extremely vague.  Now, when the framers of the Constitution wrote "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;  or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press;  or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances" I think this is probably not what they had in mind for the role of the federal government. If Thomas Jefferson were alive today he'd be storming the Captiol building with his musket looking to refresh the tree of liberty on their asses.   Exactly where does Congress think it gets the authority from to decide what can and can't be said? I mean, outside of threats, hate speech and yelling "fire" in a crowded theater, Congress has no right to fine anyone. The KKK can march and Pat Robertson can say the Jews and gays are responsible for 9/11, but Howard Stern can't make dick and fart jokes and make a few tasteless remarks? This is a goddamn outrage.  The fact that people want the government to babysit them is ridiculous. Take some freaking responsibility for yourself, you mouth-breathers. If you don't like what you hear on the radio or see on the TV, change the damn channel. No one is making anyone watch or listen to anything. If no one watches or listens, advertisers won't pay to support the show and it will go away. THAT is how you show your dissatisfaction, not by wiping your ass with the Bill of Rights.   We either live in a free society or we don't. This is NOT freedom of speech, you puritanical fools. I find it horribly hypocritical that the same people that talk about American values and protecting freedom from terrorists or evil or whatever are the ones that are now doing their damnedest to take those freedoms away. But of course, hypocrissy never stopped these jackasses before, why should this time be any different?  This country is officially going all to hell.

      Drunk by 11:30 on a Wednesday, that's my motto! Let's see if I can remmember my drinks of the night- There was a watered-down Guinness, followed by a...   IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT: Never, under any circumstances should you hold a conversation with your mother after five or six drinks. It's just a bad idea, and I can't recomend it.  As I was saying, there was the watered-down Guineess, followed by the obligatory White Russian (thank you Jeff Daniels). then the Mai Thai, then a Singapore Sling, then a Whiskey Sour. I'm fairly sure there was something else in there I'm leaving out, but oh well. Suffice it to say I'm pretty satisfied in the alcohol department.  The occasion: Jon Weiner's 24th birthday. To Jon Weiner: the man who brings his own birthday cake! I actually made use of my camera to capture this historic event, which is good, because now I can sort of justify blowing all that money on this camera that I carry around all the time and barely use.  Got to see Erik Koland tonight, which is always good.Good man, that Koland, a class act. Never once killed a baby, as far as I know.  I can safely say that I didn't get a damn thing done at work today. Mostly just reading the Fark thread about the whole pledge of allegiance thing. Man, people just don't get it- they think we "liberals" (which they use as a dirty word) just want to remove religion from all aspects of public life. No, you idiots, we just want it out of GOVERNMENT. What part of that is so bloody hard to understand?  Ok, considering I managed not to get to bed until 4 last night, now would be a good time for me to call it quits tonight, since I can probably pass otu at will due to the alcohol in my bloodstream right now...

      The Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind was really quite good. It was along the same lines as Vanilla Sky, but much better executed. The only place it kind of lost points was the fact that it was sometimes difficult to tell what was happening when.   I read today that Scalia has recused himself from the Pledge case, which means that we now only need 4 Supreme Court Justices to see reason in order for the 9th Circut Court's decision to be upheld. The bad news is that apparently in recognition of the fact that they have no case, the other side has gone after the guy who's suing the school district over the pledge because he has only partial custody of his daughter and her mother has no objection to her reciting the pledge as is. This is the most idiotic thing I've ever heard- regardless of his custody rights, he's still the damn father and he still has the right to sue the government for violating the First Amendment. And second, he should be able to sue on his own behalf, since if he's younger than 60 he probably had to recite it himself in school.   Tomorrow I get to go to a school meeting on duel imersion or something like that. I've been promised that it will be interesting, because these meetings have gotten heated in the past. In any case, I'm going to have to get the article in sometime between the end of the meeting at 9:30pm tomorrow and 9am the next day. Fun.

      So Al Franken's radio show starts on March 31st. I don't know what station he's on, or even what time, but I plan to listen. Online if nowhere else.  On Wednesday the Supreme Court is going to hear the Pledge of allegiance case. I'm optimistic, because you really can't get any clearer a violation of the the First Amendment than when congress added the phrase "under god" to the pledge in 1952. On the other hand, I'm terrified that it'll be 5-4 against, and we'll be condemned to another generation of shameful intergration of church and state before it can be potentially overturned.  In the article I read about it in the Merc, the only arguments against the 9th Circuit Court's decision that ruled the phrase unconstitutional were that it recognized the influence of faith on the founding fathers when they wrote the Constitution, as evidenced by the Declaration of independence and the motto "In God We Trust" on our money. If that's all they've got, even Scalia will have to vote to uphold the ruling. I mean, any moron that points to the Declaration of independence needs a history lesson- it was written long before the Constitution and was not subject to the First Amendment. And as for "In God We Trust" being on the money, that was added around the same time as "Under God" was added to the pledge, you dumb bastards, and once we get god out of the pledge, guess what we're going after next? One violation of the separation of church and state does not justify another.   And what was with The Simpsons tonight? They just now got around to making fun of Episode I? Bleh.

      Ah, a nice unproductive day.   I watched the pilot episode of Wonderfalls, which was ok except overly experimental and quirky, and the actors didn't seem quite at home in their roles yet (understandable, since it's the pilot) but I think it'd be pretty cool once it finds it's footing... assuming Fox doesn't cancel it just as it's getting good.  Tonight I went to a party with Jon, and I think it was unique in my experience. I was probably the youngest person there, and the only girl who was both attractive and within a couple of years of my age was asking around the party to figure out the most polite way to tell some guy who was hitting on her at a grocery store that she wasn't interested in him, because she's a lesbian. So Jon and I spent much of the evening exchanging rants. I got a nice buzz going off of a couple of apple martinis, a couple of beers, and something pineapple flavored called an alien secretion which I rode for the whole night.  For tomorrow I am setting a goal of getting up earlier than I did today, which shouldn't be tricky considering that only means I have to get up before noon.

      Thank jeebus, Best Of's over and done with. Any further involvement in it on my part will be limited to the journalistic equivelent of poking it with a stick. Now I get to get back to my usual writing about local community groups celebrating their 40th anniversaries.  Which brings me to my next order of business: finding a full time job. In another week and a half I will have worked this internship for three months, which is how long I've been telling myself I would do it. So... anyone hiring?  Yesterday I got an email from a lady who said she was the sister of one of the two guys who pled no contest to beating up a guy they thought was gay. I'd written a followup article on the guy pleading guilty, so she emailed me and complained that I didn't mention every detail of the story, despite it being little more than a blurb talking about the legal status of the case. Then she asked me why her brother was charged with assault (which she spelled wrong) with a deadly weapon when the weapon in question was a guitar - "If they're deadly, why are people allowed to walk around with them?" And then she asked why someone who is not gay would be offended by someone calling them a faggot... though she didn't mention that they called him a faggot as they were beating him with his own guitar. She then suggested that they were only making a big deal out of the incident because her brother is from New York. How exactly did people get this dumb?  Oh, I'm so far going 13/22 in the office pool for March Madness. Not too bad for someone who guessed completely at random. Probably not the best $5 I'll ever spend though.  I went to the California Pizza Kitech in Palo Alto tonight, where the service is lousey and the pizza's expensive. Not bad though. Then Jesse's house, where we watched Clear And Present Danger and I thought I'd lost my cellphone until I realized I'd left it at home. I really hate when I think I've lost something... it's almost as bad as when I actually have lost something, only I feel dumber.

      It's all coming back to me now... the adrenaline rush of having some big project due in less than 12 hours, the thrill of putting it off to the last possible moment... I feel like I'm 22 again. On the bright side, one way or another this stupid best of thing will be dead and burried tomorrow at 9am.   By the week's end I expect to be up to date with The West Wing. No longer great, but still good. Kind of like The Simpsons, except they went eight years without slipping instead of four. On the other hand, Simpsons episodes are only a half hour and West Wing episodes are a full hour... Maybe there's a limit on how long a show can be truely great.  Speaking of truely great, I just read that Jon Stewart signed to do four more years of The Daily Show, which means he'll be around to cover the 2008 election. Hopefully by then I'll have a means of actually watching The Daily Show on a regular basis. I read a great line Stewart said the other day. It was about the manufactured news reports the Bush people put out to praise their medicare bill. He asked "How can a show like this compete with the federal government when it comes to making the fake news?"  In other news, mark your calendars: Wednesday is Jon Weiner's birthday and by gar there's drinkin' to be done.

      Ok, now I'm a little dissapointed by The West Wing. Aaron Sorkin left at the end of season 4 and so did the snappy dialogue. It's still got a lot of interesting stuff about government and lots of drama... but it's just lost it's spark. It's being ridiculously melodramtic. And there was one point where there was a tense negotiation, and for some reason they were using the whole shakey-cam thing. They're just sitting around talking, for crying out loud. Shakey-cam only works when there's action, you fools! It's supposed to make you feel like it's found footage where there's a person in the room holding the camera, not make it look like the Klingons are attacking again.  I'm up to to episode 8 of season 5, so I'm almost caught up. Soon I'll get to Sports Night, which has the writing I so dearly miss.

      I have a mere two statements that will cover the majority of my day today:  1) I am very much looking forward to this Best Of stuff being over and done with.  2) I still like The West Wing.  Oh, and the question of the week was about this whole idiotic flap over "indecency standards." Personally, I can't understand for the life of me why they don't just call it censorship and a big damn bitchslap in the face to the First Amendment. I mean sweet merciful crap people, you're letting puritanical assholes have a say in what you get fined for saying on TV or the radio. Saying a dirty word or showing a nekkid lady hardly presents the kind of danger to the public that you get from yelling "fire!" in a crowded theater, death threats or hate speech. Sometimes I really want to run around with a stapler and a stack of copies of the Bill of Rights, firmly attaching them to the heads of anyone who thinks it's ok for the federal government to tell me what I can and can't say.   Was I really the only one paying attention in high school civics and American history when they explained this very simple concept? Well, civics I know I was the only one paying attention, because I was the only one who corrected the idiot teacher when she said that America had never been invaded. Hello, War of 1812, British soldiers marching through the streets of Washington and burning the Whitehouse to the ground? Anyone? Anyone? Damnation people are stupid.

      Another productive day. Well, I guess I did get a bunch of West Wing episodes downloaded and finished The Sopranos Season 4, so you can't say I did  nothing  all day... just damn close to it.   There really is something to be said for desensitization. I was watching the Sopranos with Jesse tonight, and as we were watching the funny guy of the show smother and rob an old lady, we realized that it's very difficult to shock us these days. Not that that's really a bad thing... TV and movies just have to work harder for the shock now. They have to really  want  it.

      Today was quite unproductive- just the way I like'em. I do need to start getting to bed earlier though... I'm reverting back to my old noctournal ways.  I'm debating whether I should download and watch the pilot episode of Wonderfalls that aired Friday... I'm told it's good (it's being done by Tim Minear, who was one of Firefly's producers) but on the other hand it's on Fox. And it's on Friday nights. Which means that if it's any good it will be cancelled mid season. I don't know if I want to get jerked around like that again.

      I will always remember this as the night Pat Neal accidentally judo-chopped Jon Weiner's sleeping mother at 2 a.m. "Well, there's no one in this bed." *wump* "What the hell?" "Oh my god Mrs. Wiener, I'm so sorry!" Funniest. Thing. Ever.   Oh, and we ran around downtown PA drinking for a while, but really, that just pales in comparison.

      I notice no one has commented on anything yet. Honestly, I do and do and do for you kids, and what do I get in return? If only my imaginary blog readers could comment...  In other news, I finally got my pizza. 'Bout damn time, I say. Papa Murphey's thin crust (which is what my coupons were good for) ain't half bad- kind of like pizza on a cracker, but I'm usually just in it for the toppings anyway. Jesse, Alex and I shared a couple of them over a few episodes of The Sopranos tonight.  Then Jesse and I met up with Jon, Pat Neal and Ricky Dunn over at the Los Altos St. Stevens Green, where we and another group of punk kids were the only people in the joint. Pat's in town for a day or two in transit between DC and Hawaii, so we all came out to rub his head for good luck. Jon, being a dumbass, left like 10 minutes after we got there because he's doesn't seem to have very good time management skills.  This was followed by several more Sopranos episodes back at Jesse's. At this rate we'll be through the whole season by Monday.

      Well, I finished watching The West Wing epsidoes I had, which got me a little ways into the fourth season. I guess I'm going to be busy downloading the rest of them for a while. In the meantime, Jesse and I started watching The Sopranos season 4 tonight. I'd forgotten how messed up that show is. In the entire cast of characters, Tony's therapist is probably the only "good" person, and even she has her problems. Most of the rest of them are murderous cokeheads. Who in their right mind would want to watch "reality" TV when there's full fledged fiction like this?  Jesse concocted a tasty beverage that we were sipping on- I beleive it was vanilla vodka, lemonade, and gingerale.  Oh, and I talked to Jenna today for the first time since Halloween. Poor girl had mono, she tells me. That's what you get when you work around kids- they're just swimming in disease. Filthy, filthy children.

      Well, the thing at work corrected itself- if only the Supreme Court had a publisher to sit it down and straighten it out on ethics.  I picked up my 3rd season Futurama DVDs tonight. I've racked up quite a que. I need to finish watching The West Wing, then I've got The Sopranos, then I've got Sports Night, and then Futurama. By the time I'm done, maybe the 4th season Simpsons DVDs will be out... but not likely. They don't exactly rush those babies.  What else is new... not a whole hell of a lot. I still want pizza.

      I'm getting a bigger and bigger backlog of shows to watch- I'm not yet done with The West Wing, and I've just borrowed Sopranos season 4 and tomorrow Futurama season 3 comes out... Ah, the joy of DVD box sets. It's by far a better experience to be able to watch these shows when you want and without commercials. It's well worth the $30 or $40 for a year's worth of a great show.  As for work today... I probably shouldn't comment, except to say that the situation reminds me of a certain presidential election, and that I will be hereafter referring to one of our ad people as a supreme court justice.  I spent a couple of hours today wandering the streets asking people what they thought was going to happen to Martha Stewart now that her trial is over. There's a surprising amount of sympathy towards her. People seem to understand that it's something of a farce to go after her for making a measly $40,000 or whatever while Ken Lay is sitting by his pool without so much as a lowjack.  Speaking of which, I keep reading that Martha Stewart has "vowed to appeal." What, did she stand up in court after the verdict was read and actually vow? 'Cause you don't hear many people vowing these days... I think it's gone out of style or something.   And speaking of vowing, I didn't get my pizza today, but I vow that someday soon, I shall. I've got  coupons,  for crying out loud.

      You know what makes me happy? Papa Murphey's coupons. A $4 pizza sounds really, really good.  I had a realization today- it's closing in on a year that I've been living at home after graduation. There was my Canadian trip, and then my Hawaian trip, which combined was about a month. Then there was about five months of me doing aboslutely nothing. Ah, memories. Then I got this internship, which has taken up the last two months, for a grand total of eight months.  So, I am hereby declaring my intentions to move out of the house before June. Of course, that means very little in itself- I declare lots of intentions that don't actually happen. From time to time I declare my intention to clean my room or hang up some laundry or something. Occasionally I'll declare my intention to eat a bagle... I think that's one of the rare ones I've actually followed through on. Anyway, it sure would be nice to move out of the house by June.  That, of course, requires that I get me one of those "job" thingies I've heard so much about. That'd be nice too. And while I'm on Santa's knee here, I'd like a pony and a GI Joe and nunchucks.

      For all of those who stubbornly refused to mark my words... well, up yours. I went to Nola's and met up with Jesse, Jon, Neil, and a bunch of people from Foothill. I kept it to a measly two drinks- a white russian and a long island (what with the driving and all) but managed to buy four, meaning I spent more money than I should have. I'm awfully good at that. But to be fair that's partially due to the fact that I really shouldn't be spending any money at all.

      I finally vanquished the evil ballots today. Only took around 11 hours of tedious page-flipping to do it. And all the ink all over my hands was fun too. But it's over now, so I can begin concentrating on writing 30 little blurbs on each of the winners. Wheeee.  After missing out the last couple of days, I got back to the more enjoyable task of watching The West Wing today. I'm now up to episode 3x12. And as you may have guessed from my past posts on the subject, it is really quite good.  My LSN performace has taken another characteristic downturn. I'm down from #25 in the league to #49.  What else, what else... Kat has finally unblocked my AIM screen name after a week of the silent treatment for the cardinal sin of suggesting she get out and vote this November now that Bush has come out in favor of a Constitutional amendment banning gay marraige. I've promised not to mention politics to her again until the neo-con stormtroopers come to round up all the "sexual devients."   In closing, I like pie.

      Ok, Batman update- it seems Liam Neeson won't be playing Ra's Al Ghul, but rather a "mentor" of Bruce Wayne's. That would have me dissapointed, except Ken Watanabe, who played Katsumoto in The Last Samurai, is playing Ra's instead. Also Gary Oldman is going to play James Gordon. This movie has a pretty bitchin' cast coming together.

      Best news of the day- nay, the month: the Firefly movie has been officially greenlighted by Universal Pictures, under the working title Serenity. For once there is something resembling justice in the entertainment world. A great TV show that was cancelled long before its time is being brought back.  Of course, at the same time UPN has indicated that it will not be picking up Angel after the WB cancelled it last month. I guess it was foolish to expect an intelligent decision from the minds that haven't cancelled Enterprise yet. This means that Fox, the WB, and UPN... hell, make that everybody but Universal are all just frickin' jackasses who don't know quality TV when they see it.  That being said, my day today consisted of three and a half hours of ballot counting, and a further half hour of a story meeting and getting bitched at by some idiot lady who was just now complaining that the homophobic community was under-represented when I did my Voices question on whether gay marriage should be legal. First she said that there weren't any people who thought it should be illegal, which was wrong- one out of five of the people quoted said that he was a "traditionalist," and therefore believed that a marriage should be between a man and a woman. So then she insisted there should have been more "normal people" like herself (or as I call them, "normal bigots") polled. I explained to her that I'd randomly asked people on the street, and in fact I'd had to ask around more than usual to find one person who thought it should be illegal. She matter-of-factly said that she found that hard to believe, and that in the future I should ask more "smart people."  I was glad that I had the oppertunity to end the conversation there, because otherwise it would have been very difficult to resist getting confrontational and shredding her argument to the point where she'd have to hide behind her bible, at which point I would beat her over the head with the First Amendment. Who the hell do these people think they are that they have the right to enforce their own religious morality on other people who don't share their beliefs? Her atitude, and having to be nice to her despite it, had me pretty well pissed off for the rest of the day.  So what else... I went to Taxi's in downtown Palo Alto for dinner with Neil for no particular reason. We bummed around the Apple store for a bit and made faces at Jesse while he was giving a presentation to customers about some software or something. Following that, I went to Jesse's to watch Chasing Amy with Alex and Chris and a friend of his.  Oh, and I'm working on a way to allow comments on here... they don't make it as easy as some. But hopefully soon you'll be able to post comments about how bad my spelling is when I forget to run the spell check.

      Hi there Jon. I guess it turns out someone  does  read my blog after all.  Well it's official: there is now more evidence of water on Mars than there was of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.  John Edwards is out of the race. All hail President Kerry. He'd damn well better win.  Now that I think about it, I'm pretty sure that everything I voted for today lost, and everything I voted against won. Fantabulous.

      Back to NASA tomorrow. This time they're promising some new information, which will be a nice change from last time. In fact, they're making an announcement of some major discovery the Mars rovers have made. Gee, could it be evidence of water?   It will also be a welcome change from tallying votes from the Best of Mountain View thing, which, as much as I complain about it, is not  that  bad. Hear that Candice? I bitch and complain, that's just what I do. I'd probably complain just as much if I had half the work or twice the work. This is why most people wisely ignore me, and why only like three or four people actually read this blog.  As I write this I am being convinced over AIM that I need to go down to San Luis sometime in the near future. It's been a while since I've been down to harass people there. Pretty soon I'll find out if my parents are going to follow through on their evil plan to charge me for living at home, in which case I'll have approximately zero spending cash. Barring that, I'll be able to afford the gas and food for such a trip.

      Yeah, I like my job. I mean, the game I'm reviewing right now isn't exactly top-shelf material, but it's still playing a game and making good money for it. By the way, my work AIM screenname is NowhereDan, if you want to make sure I don't get any "work" done.  I drove almost exactly 100 miles today. My daily commute is about 70, plus after work I went to check out another place where I will not be living, and I got lost in the process. Yahoo is next to useless in the city, because the roads there are so incredibly messed up that it can't make heads or tails of them. Combined with my uncanny lack of a sense of direction, that comes to about 30 miles.

      So on my first day I got to go to the EA offices in Redwood City (some awesome buildings they've got there) and listened to them try to convince the editor of PC Gamer that we should put The Sims 2 on our cover. That was a hell of a thing indeed. The rest of the day was spent playing a game called Lineage II, which is the sequel to a massively multiplayer online role playing game that's big in Korea. The thing is, it's not all that good, and it's really frickin' weird in places. for example, in most 3rd person perspective games, when you zoom in all the way you're looking at the back of your character's head, or their face, depending on the angle. In this game when you zoom in all the way you're looking at your character's ass or crotch. I couldn't understand that at all until I saw the female "night elves," which are dressed in assless outfits.  Fortunately I got to take home a couple of good games to play with, like City of Heros and Hitman: Contracts. Unfortunately I don't get paid to play those, but I don't have to pay to play them either. Oh, and the commute wasn't nearly as bad as I'd feared. It takes me about 40 minutes each way.   Perhaps best of all, I found out I get to go to E3 in LA next month for a few days. I've always wanted to go to an E3. I think I'm going to enjoy the hell out of working here.  All that good stuff almost makes up for the fact that I don't think I'm going to get that room I wanted. I haven't heard back from the people, and considering they say they wanted to get it rented out by the 1st of next month, if they still needed someone I'd have thought they'd jump all over my email. Dissapointing.

      So we're now at Job-11 hours, 45 minutes. I'm enforcing an 11:00 curfew for the first time since I was like 12. My goal is to get up at 6:30-7, and get on the road at around 7:45-8, and hopefully I will be neither mired in traffic nor manage to get lost somehow.   I found an ad for a room on Craigslist tonight that looks like a great place. It'd be a room in a 4 bedroom house in the Noe Vally area of San Francisco, like 5 miles from where I'll be working. The room has two closets and its own bathroom, and there's room in the garage for me to park my car, plus they've got DSL already in there and the people in it range from 22 to 27. And on top of that, it's in my price range. It sounds almost too good to be true, so naturally it's probably already been filled, since the listing was more than a week old. Of course, that's what I said about my job when I applied for it too... let's hope Craigslist still loves me.  -Edit- Looks like Craigslist does love me- I just found a reoccurance of that same ad posted on the 25th. Now I've just got to hope it's as good as it seems.

       urlLink All Glory To The Hypnotoad!   I love that toad. Anyway, I've expanded my search beyond Daly City, as much of it seems to be a hellhole. I'm looking at places in San Francisco now too. There seem to be plenty of places, but a lot of them are on the wrong side of town, and I'd rather not have to drive all the way across the city every day. Also, a lot of them say things like "Vegetarian kitchen (fish ok)" or "No alcohol in house!" What's wrong with these people? First of all, fish are meat. Deal with it. You can say you don't eat red meat or poultry, but don't call yourself a vegetarian when you're eating animals, you lunatics. And people that don't want alcohol in the house at all... come on. You can say "no habitual drinkers," but what the hell does it matter to you if someone has a beer after work? Sheesh.

      So it turns out that if a room is reasonably priced, it's most likely a shithole. Who'd have thought? I guess it's time I gave up on the crazy fantasy that I can get away with paying less than $600 for a room around here. Right now, if I can find a place that's as good as what I had in Santa Cruz for the same money I'll be very happy. The biggest problem right now is that in order to get such a place I would need a group of people, and right now I don't know of anyone around here that's looking to move to the city area. How dare you all inconvenience me like this.

      If I remember correctly I think I drank seven beers (five Sapporos and two ciders) and three shots of Baccardi rum at Neil's birthday fiesta last night. 'Twas an excellent way to compensate for the rest of the day being almost intollerably dull, and I only suffered a little bit this morning.  It turns out one of the perks of using this here Google blog service is that you also get to be on the beta test of Gmail.

      2nd to last day at the Voice today. I did about half the writing I need to do on my last article, which is about the trash/recycling in Mountain View. Exciting stuff, isn't it? I'll probably try to do most of the rest over the weekend, and then take the 15 minute tour of the recycling facility in Sunnyvale on Monday and then finish it.  Other than that I didn't do a lot because I was tired all day from getting up at 8. The sad thing is I'm going to have to get up at 7:30ish in order to get on the road by 8 so that I can get to work by 9 on Wednesday morning. Hopefully I'll be able to force myself into a socially acceptable sleep schedule by then.   Speaking of which, it's 11:30, so I need to get to sleep. Damn that feels weird to say.

      The Voice gang took me out to dinner at Chef Chu's after work today. Damn that place has some good food. My personal favorite is the kung pao chicken, but that's not to diminish the tastiness of everything else. I also got a snazzy card with a goldfish jumping out of it's bowl into a bigger bowl that everyone had signed. Aw. I've only got two more days working there.  I've been thinking about my living situation. I'm thinking I might not want to rush in selecting a place, since I don't want to spend a ton of money on a place that sucks. So maybe I'll stay at home a little longer... but not past June. I may go up to Daly City to check out a couple of places this weekend though, just to see what's out there.

      If anyone knows any sexy female co-eds with a spare room in Daly City, give me a heads up, will you?   My search thus far has gone something like this: "$600 for a room in a 3Br 2Ba house. One roommate is a 63 year old man, the owner..." yeah, if I wanted to live with senior citizens, I'd stay at home.  "$550 for a room in our newly remodeled house. We are a young 30-something couple with a 4 year old..." Nope. They'd have to pay ME to get me to live with a kid I'm not related to.  And then there's a bunch of stuff on the wrong side of town or costs too much or they only accept women or they smoke or one of the roommates is named Boogie (I kid you not) or whatever. There are a couple of places that look acceptable from the brief descriptions, and I've emailed them to ask for more information.  On the credit card front, I went down to WaMu in Los Altos to get an application for what's called a secured Visa, but they had run out of them. So either they're really popular, or they're really UNpopular. So on my way to work I picked up one from the Mountain View WaMu (which the guy said was the last one). It looks like it'll work for my purposes... the only thing I don't like about it is that it's got a $35 anual fee, which is dissapointing since WaMu is usually good about not having fees like that. I bit the bullet and sent that application in.  One week from today I start at PC Gamer.

      The quest for housing continues. I'm leaning heavily towards getting a place in Daly City, since it's only 4 miles from where I'll be working in Brisbane and I've heard it's a pretty decent place to live. It's also near the city, so I'll be able to spend a little time there and familiarize myself with it a little bit.  I'm thinking I'm going to look for some people to move in with. Getting my own place would be a bit pricey, especially if I want to get DSL or cable internet, which I very much do. Without broadband I'd whither and die like a hothouse flower. So now I just need to find a decent place with decent people for a decent price... something tells me this isn't going to be easy.  One thing that's pretty lame about Brisbane is that it's located smack dab in the middle of two Caltrain stations, which seem to be the furthest apart on the whole northern half of the system. The result is that my place of business is three and a half miles from either station, which means I'm going to have to drive to work all the time. Well, if I can get a place in Daly City maybe I could get a bike and ride that to work, weather permitting. But I'd still need a car for when it's not so hospitable out.  Another thing I've decided I need is a credit card. My initial idea was that I'd get an American Express card, because that's pretty much all Costco takes these days, and use it for my food shopping to build up a credit rating. Unfortunately, American Express doesn't like the fact that I've never had a credit card, and it only took them about 14 seconds to screw that idea for me. So what I've decided to do is go to Washington Mutual tomorrow and set up a Visa card. They have this system where you put $300 or more in an account, and that's your spending limit. So I'll just do that until American Express decides I'm ready for the big leagues and lets me spend money I don't have.

I've started thinking about moving out, as in where I might get a place and how much I can afford to spend on it. I'm pretty much open to anywhere between here and San Francisco. Somewhere cheap, yet not crappy. So far... I have no specific ideas. But a while back I made a proclaimation that I'd be out of the house by June, a date which is fast approaching. So I've got to figure something out sometime soon.

      In what is becoming a weekend routine, we all went back to the beach in Half Moon Bay yesterday. The weather is funky- last week it was warm here and freezing there. This week it was raining here and sunny and warm there. Nature is playing with my mind and ensuring that I'm nevery properly dressed.  We tested out Jesse's new kite which, dispite being bigger than his old one, was a little dissapointing in terms of pull and manuverability, and then went back to Ally's place to drink ourselves stupid and soak in the hot tub. Eventually we passed out there and made it home this morning. I feel surprisingly good considering how much beer I drank.

      See? I didn't get a job yesterday, and there were no comments made. I'm seeing a strong coorelation there.  I saw Kill Bill Volume II tonight with Jesse, Neil, Alex, Joe, Ally, and a couple of people whose names escape me. All in all, I think I liked Volume I better. There was more spectacular fighting in that one... not to say that this one didn't have some bitchin' fight scenes, but they were scaled back. This time there was much more talking about what was going on, lots of crazy flashbacks and intentionally cheesey kung-fu movie references, and of course the very Tarantino Superman analogy.   It's back to the beach tomorrow to play with Jesse's new and bigger kite. If there's any wind at all that thing's going to drag us around like a dog that finally caught a car. I imagine there might be some beer consumed as well.

      Ah, I see. All I have to do to get people to comment on here is to get a job. If I'd known that, I'd have gotten a job earlier. Though I still don't know who "colorfulsock" is.   Eric, don't let this get your hopes up for you finding a job- I may be lazy, incompotent and have a musky odor, but you're... well, I forgot where I was going with this.  And yes, for the most part it looks like I'll be just playing games and reviewing them, plus some hardware reviews (video cards, mice, gamepads, that sort of thing) and, since I'm an assistant editor, I imagine there will be a fair amount of assisting going on.  Today I signed and faxed in a thing they sent me saying that yes, I really do want this job. Actually, they had to send it twice, because the first time the accidentally sent me one that said that the position was based in their New York office. Good thing I caught that, or I might have a plane to catch.  At work I went out and talked to some people that were handing out flyers showing how much money was being spent on the military and Iraq at the post office as people were sending in their tax returns. One of them was a very slow talker and started going off on a tangent about global warming and showed me a bunch of stickers he'd had made that said "Mend your feulish ways." It's difficult to agree with people who are so weird sometimes.

      Part II of my interview went pretty well, I think. It was mostly introducing me to the rest of the gang and letting everyone ask me questions. There were the usual ones about my background and what kind of games I like, and then they asked what kind of fast food I liked, what my favorite movies were, and if I minded a lot of swearing and obnoxiousness around the office. Then we played some Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow, which I'd never played before but I at least didn't embarass myself. Then they had me write up a little blurb about a game mod I'd mentioned earlier, and they said they'd put it in the next issue. Finally, they said they'd let me know in a day or two if I get the job. After all that, I kind of find it hard to believe they'll go with someone else.  Then I went over to Jesse's and finished off Sports Night. My final analysis: the first season was better, because it was more lighthearted and outright funny, whereas the second was more about people getting pissed off at each other. But of course it was extremely good all the way though, and ABC was idiotic to cancel it when they did.  Then we went to play frisbee golf with Chris and a bunch of his friends on the Stanford campus. As it turns out, I'm really bad at frisbee golf, so it's a good thing we neglected to keep score after a while.  Tomorrow I'm going in to the office early. I've got a bunch of stuff to catch up on from today.

      So I've been working on my shortened LSN review... it's actually very difficult to condense all the information I want to get into this thing into a mere 500 words. The game deserves so much more than that. Oh well... I'll have it done by tomorrow without much trouble.  For some reason my DVD drive has stopped showing up in Windows. It shows up in the BIOS, but the name seems to be scrabled up... I'm thinking it's either a Windows problem, in which case it's fixable by reformatting, or a loose cable. I guess I'll have to rip my computer apart tomorrow... in the meantime I guess I can watch Sports Night on my laptop. Always carry a spare, people.  I took Jason and his girlfriend Lyndsey out for a drink with Jesse and Chris at the Cheesecake Factory. Jason wasn't man enough for his mojito. Many expensive nachos were consumed. And I got up on my soap box complaining about the FCC fining Howard Stern $495,000 for talking about anal sex and why the Constitution is a good idea. That was fun.

      Holy crap, it looks like I might actually get this job. I mean, it's starting to seem like it's a very realistic possibility. Someone might actually be just crazy enough to hire me.  My interview started at 11 with talking to the lady from the human resources department. She asked me a bunch of standard interview questions, like what would my current boss say about me, what do I think my strengths are, what's my biggest weakness (I said I procrastinate sometimes, but I do it by playing video games, so that would work out well here), what I would bring to the company, and then the not-so-standard question of what my favorite games were (X-Com, LSN, Fallout, Half-Life, Homeworld).   Then they brought in the editor in chief and the hardware editor. Just about the first thing they did was to inform me that outside of the Subway down the road there's nothing to eat around there, and since most of Brisbane is build on landfill the next time an earthquake hits we'll probably be 100 feet lower when it's over. Then more interview questions, some of them repeats. Then they asked if I could handle myself in a shooter- I said I could hold my own. I think I sold myself pretty well. One funky thing about it is that the editor's name is also Dan, and he said that "there can be only one." So, if I get the job, I will be known as "D.J." A small price to pay. They also asked me to pare down my 1900 word LSN review to 500 words, which is more their typical review length. I'd sent in the same review I'd written for my IGN.com application in order to get my application in as soon as possible, and their reviews tend to be longer.  So after that they told me that they'd give me a call within a week or two and let me know if they wanted me to come back for another interview. It turns out though that "a week or two" is just a code phrase for "four hours," because as I was about to leave work today they called and asked me to show up on Monday. That's why I'm thinking I've got a pretty good shot at this job.  It turns out that in decently moving traffic, it only takes me a half hour to get to their office, which is great- I was afraid it would take twice that long. Of course, I've yet to try it during rush hour, but it could definitely be worse.  And now I'm going to go watch a movie.

      Big damn interview tomorrow. Must... not... blow... this. I've polished my shoes, picked out some clothes, and thunked up some nice things to say about myself. Hell, they owe me this job just because I shelled out $8 for the magazine I bought off the shelf yesterday. I want this job I want this job I want this job.  I managed to swap my full-screen Matrix DVD for a wide screen version. They were being all fussy about it for a while because the price had changed, since it was on sale yesterday, but it turned out it was only slightly less on sale today than yesterday, so it only ended up costing me $1.08 more. I also picked up a copy of Sneakers from Boarders, since it's entirely too good a movie to not own, and their price was like $0.80 more than Amazon.com's.

      Well balls... in my haste, I accidentally picked up a copy of The Matrix Revolutions pan n' scan rather than letterbox. And worse yet, I didn't notice until I opened it, which means that Fry's will probably be a bitch about taking it back. Hopefully they'll let me do a straight up exchange. Oh well, the music still sounds awesome.  Also while I was there I got a copy of PC Gamer. I figured it would be a good idea to familarize myself with it a little bit before I went in to interview. I was totally blown away by the fact that the news stand price is $7.99. Who on Earth pays $7.99 for a monthly magazine? Especially when the subscription cost is $2 per issue. That's a huge ripoff... it will only be worth that much after I start writing for them.  Looking over this thing, it looks like unless they have me do like 8 reviews per month it would probably be less work than I'm doing at The Voice. And half of that work would be simply playing games all day. GodDAMN I want this job.  Speaking of The Voice, I did what will hopefully be one of my last Voices questions today, which was "After the recent surge in violence in Iraq, is it a good idea for the US to pull out?" I got two yes answers and three no's. Frankly, anyone who says we should pull out now is a moron. No, we shouldn't have been there in the first place, but leaving now would be far worse than staying until the job is done.

      I am pleased. Very pleased indeed.  This morning my cell phone announced to me that while it had not rung earlier, someone had left me a voice mail. It turned out to be someone from the Human Resources department of Future Network, the company that owns PC Gamer, saying they wanted to talk to me about the job. I called back and left a message, and an hour or two later she called back and gave me a little pre-interview interview. She told me that they would get back to me within the next couple of weeks to tell me if they wanted to interview me for the job.   Since I wasn't expecting it for a week, I was pleasantly surprised to find an email awaiting me upon my return from work asking me to come in for an interview on Thursday, time to be determined. As I mentioned earlier, I am pleased. Of course, now I'm just going to panic and blow it, but I'm pleased for the next couple of days anyway.   In other news, there is nothing more irritating than outrunning your own email. I sent myself a story I'd worked on at home and then drove down to work, which takes maybe 10-15 minutes. I checked my email- nothing. I checked my Yahoo account online to see if I'd sent it there by mistake. Nothing. So I had to drive home again and send it again, this time to both my work account and my Yahoo account so I could be sure I'd get it. I drove back to work and there it was, waiting for me. I finished it up and started working on something else, and then, just to piss me off further, the original email showed up. I hate that, I really do.

      I'm back from a weekend in Santa Cruz. A good time was had by all- there was a hot tub and some alcohol, so it's hard to go wrong, really.   I also saw Hellboy. It was surprisingly good. Not great or particularly memorable, but a very fun comic book movie. I hear the creator was heavily involved in the movie, and that always seems to help movies based on other stuff not suck.  If there's one single good thing about all this Daylight Savings Time garbage, it's that now, at long last, the clock in my car is right again. Of course, it was only wrong in the first place because of the Daylight Savings Time garbage... and it only stayed wrong because I was too lazy/inept to change it... hey, do I come into the place where  you  work and slap the dick out of  your  mouth? No.

      Well, it looks like I'm going all or nothing on this whole new job thing. I did a considerate but foolish thing and told my boss I'm starting to look for something else, so that she wouldn't be taken by surprise when her intern takes off. Aren't I nice? The problem arises from the fact that now that she knows this, she needs to start looking for a replacement intern. And if she should find someone that can commit to a few months, then I'll be on my way out.  On the bright side, my chances of getting that PC Gamer job went up today. I first sent in my resume last Friday night, so I figured five business days later was a good time to follow up. I looked up the editor-in-chief's name, which was harder than you might think- nowhere on their website do they have a staff box. I sent him a note asking whether he'd gotten my resume and saying that I was still interested in the job, and that I'd like to interview for it. Now, I'd thought the part about whether he'd gotten it was rhetorical when I'd asked, but it turns out it hadn't gotten to him yet, and he asked me to send it to him directly instead of through the email address listed on the ad.  I have decided that this is a very good thing for three reasons: 1) The fact that he asked me to send my resume is a pretty good indication that the job is still open. 2) The editor now knows my name. Personal attention can't hurt. 3) All the other people who sent their resumes to the same address probably didn't get to the editor either.  So I am hopeful that I'll get an oppertunity to screw myself over in an actual interview. Wouldn't that be cool?  As for what I've been doing with myself this fine Friday evening... well, I made a dent in Sports Night. Can't say I wasn't productive.

      Next year I'm going have to put more thought into April Fool's Day. It's gotten pretty lame, with the false product announcements and news stories. Next year I'm going to plan in advance, and someone's going to suffer at my hands. Because that's what April Fool's Day is all about.  I started watching Sports Night tonight. Ah, Aaron Sorkin writing. There's nothing quite like it. I know nothing at all about sports, but fortunately that's not required. The dialogue is awesome, and I have so missed it watching the fifth season of West Wing. It's very odd- apparently the early episodes had occasional and inconsistant laugh track, and sometimes they beat you over the head with not-so-subtle music, but the writing is absurdly good.

      Oh the things I did today, my stars. What  didn't  I do today?   Come to think of it, I actually did nothing at all today. Talk about living life to its fullest. I spent some time searching Craigslist and such (that place I wanted is back on there with a different room this time. Screw them) and cleaned up my room a bit, but that hardly qualifies as something, in the grand scheme of things. Oh well, one of these days I'll learn to take advantage of these rare three day weekends.

      I had dinner with Lauren and Neil at Los Charros, and I finally worked up the courage to sample the beef tongue. Not bad, but the texture was a bit... mushy. And the idea of having tongue stuck in my teeth was a little disconcerting. But I washed it down with a Dos Equis- the name is too much fun to say not have have tried it.   The new Cake album is to be called "Pressure Chief." If nothing else, you have to appreciate the nonsensical names of their albums.

      So I've been looking around for good freeware alternatives to programs I use a lot. So far I've come up with the following:   urlLink XN View  - works like ACDSee. Only a little bit slower to load pictures, not as bloated with features I don't want or need. I did have to tweak the options a bit to make it work the way I wanted, but it seems to be pretty cool.   urlLink Zip Genius  - Seems to be a fully functional compression program that can handle .zip, .rar, and just about anything else you can throw at it. And no nag screen like on Winzip or WinRAR.    urlLink Real Alternative  - plays Realmedia files in Windows Media Player Classic without having to run Realplayer and put up with all their ads and crap.   urlLink AIMutation  - A free alternative to DeadAIM that does all the same good stuff, like ad removal, chat logging, buddy aliasing, plus it lets you skin the AIM window if you want. The only problem is it's not compatible with the newer versions of AIM yet, so you have to get AIM version  urlLink 5.2.3292 .  More as they come.

      The good news is that Cake will be coming out with a new album on Septeber 7th, so you can all race to see who gets it for me for a belated birthday present. Good to see they're keeping up their 2 year album cycle. I was kind of hoping they'd have it out by this summer, but oh well. I'm ever so excited.  The bad news is that The Day After Tomorrow sucked, and I paid to see it. It was worse than Troy, even. The whole thing was just silly... the number of times they had scientists say "What are you suggesting?" in the first 30 minutes alone was staggering. I was surprised they never had anyone say "according to my calculations."  In other news, I just reformatted my computer and am in the process of putting it back together. Man, do I know how to party or what?

      I had one of  urlLink these stupid things  fluttering around my room last night- the first of the year. For the record, they do NOT eat mosquitos. They don't eat anything at all as adults. Their sole purpose in life is to mate, annoy me, and die. They wouldn't be so annoying if they weren't frickin' huge and didn't look like they could take a chunk out of your neck as you sleep.  It is definitely time for me to reformat my Windows partition. I'm getting all kinds of obnoxious spyware on my system somehow, and it's beyond AdAware and Spybot's combined abilities to make it go away permenantly. Also my system's just running a little clunky, and it's been a while.

      Yay for Memorial Day and the heroes who fought and died fighting to give us all a day off. And yay for my employer, who closed up at 3 today to give us a head start on the weekend.  I used it to go check out a room in an apartment in the Mission district. No no no no, I don't think so. It was a pretty skanky looking neighborhood and wasn't a very big room. Yet for some reason it was priced the same as a bigger room in a better neighborhood... I don't get it. The only thing it had going for it was that it was pretty close to work, but I think it's more than a worthwhile trade off to drive five minutes longer to and from work to avoid living in a shitty neighborhood.  I also got me a free snazzy remote control for my computer. I've always wanted one of these, but never enough to actually pay for one. Well that problem solved itself when someone just dropped one on my desk since someone had given it to them but they already had one. I can use it control Winamp and DVDs from across the room like a stereo or DVD player. Pretty bitchin'.  So now I've got three days off... if only I had something to do. I guess I'll continue the ol' housing search and play Far Cry.

      Didn't do much today... I did some benchmark testing on an obscenely fast (and proportionally expensive) computer at work, which was kind of neat, and sifted through more Craigslist housing ads. Besides that, there was lots of City of Heroes and not a lot else.  I did see an article about how Al Franken's radio show is apparently outperforming Rush Limbaugh's now. Maybe this will drive Limbaugh back to the pain pills.

      Yeah, I wussed out real good. But I did some excellent rationalizing.   Reason 1: I hadn't met half the people I'd be living with, and I'm not wild about signing up to spend a year with people I haven't even had a chance to size up in person. The last time I did that I got stuck with a guy who needed to be persuaded to wear deoderant.   Reason 2: My test commute took 20-25 minutes. If I'm going to be moving out with the goal of shortening my commute, and if I'm going to be paying San Francisco rent, it's going to have to be a little bit better than that. Of course, this is partially the fault of the space monkeys that designed the streets of San Francisco.  So I'm going to hold out for something better. Sooner or later I'll find something so good even I can't turn it down.   In other news, cherries are in season. You can tell when they're in season when even the ones you get from Safeway are awesome.

      I checked out a place in the city today, and I liked what I saw. It's a pretty cool place right next to Stern Grove. It's not very far from work, and it'd cut my commute time by aroudn two thirds. I'd be sharing it with two girls and two guys, three of them students at SFSU. The room isn't huge, but it's big enough for a bed and a desk, plus it has a pretty big closet.   My only reservation is the fact that I haven't met the two guys yet. I met the two girls, and they seem nice enough, so in theory they'll have gotten some reasonable guys to live with. I told them I'd give them an answer either way within a couple of days (since they're trying to fill the place by next Tuesday), so I'm going to have to do me some quick pondering.

      I finally got my credit card today. Huzzah for consumerism! I managed to smear my signature a little too, just to be classy.   I also got a belated graduation present from my aunt and uncle, who sent me a very nice new laptop bag. It's a big step up from my current one, though that's not too difficult to do considering it's someone's schwag. But rest assured, it's a very cool bag.  My boss ok'd some vacation time for me in July for my annual Canadian excursion. Though I think this will be the first time since 1990 that I'll be there less than the usual 3 weeks. Very sad. But after I earn my first bajillion dollars at age 25 I'll retire and make up for the lost time.  My plan for this evening is to watch a few Firefly episodes with Jamie and continue Firefly's perfect track record of making everyone I show it to love it, and then hate Fox for cancelling it when they see the last episode.

      Whee, that was fun. Nothing like a jaunt over 17 in a top-heavy minivan to get the blood flowing. But it was all worth it- between hanging out with Ryan and Kelsey, seeing Shrek 2 (which was surprisingly good, by the way. I think I liked it better than the original, and the original was great) and finally recovering my Firefly DVDs, 'twas definitly time well spent.  Certainly better than the earlier half of my day, which was spent going through a chest of drawers that'd gone virtually undisturbed since I was in school and tossing a bunch of trash I've accumulated. And now as a result my bed is covered in crap that I for some reason have decided I want to keep, so I'm going to have to do something with it before I go to bed.  On the housing front, I've got a new lead. I got sick of combing the ads for rooms for rent on Craigslist and instead posted a brief but flattering description of myself and what I'm looking for. I got a bunch of replies that aren't at all what I asked for, but I got a couple that are pretty close. So I'll be checking one of them out on Tuesday. This one's not quite as close to work as would be ideal, but it might be acceptable if the traffic isn't ridiculous getting there. I know, big if.

      I know I've said this quite a few times in the last few weeks, but this time I really intend to go to Santa Cruz tonight. I ain't see those folks down there in way too long, and considering many of them will soon be graduating and going back from whence then came, now would be a good time to drop in. There's a 7ish viewing of Shrek 2 with Kelsey and possibly Ryan if he makes it back in time in the planning stages. Plus I finally get to steal back my Firefly DVDs.  But when I go over 17 I won't be driving my car. It seems that when that little oil indicator light occasionally blinks on, it doesn't mean "Hey, you're running a little low on oil, maybe you should check your dipstick," so much as it means "HOLY SHIT, YOU'VE GOT NO FUCKING OIL IN YOUR ENGINE YOU DIPSTICK!" I guess it's a testament to German engineering (circa 1991) that the thing got me to work and back these past couple of weeks.

      So I still haven't hooked up my new speakers, mostly because my desk is too much of a mess to permit my getting close enough to unplug my old ones, much less plug in five new ones. I've made a slight dent in the clutter, but it will take several more days of picking away at it to make any real progress.  I've noticed that I have a fair number of DVDs, many of which I haven't watched in a good long while. I'll have to fix that, starting with The Hut for Red October, The Shawshank Redemption, and American Beauty.   Jamie, Jesse and I went to Fry's and In-N-Out for old times' sake this afternoon. Poor Jamie had been deprived of In-N-Out for months at a time while in school in Virginia. Then we watched most of Kill Bill Vol. 1. I was trying to keep track of how many people The Bride killed/maimed while fighting the Crazy 88 (trying to determine if there actually were 88 of them) but lost track, since there were a bunch of times she might have stabbed someone or she might not have... it was all very confusing. Bare minimum it was in the 60's.   Later in the day Jesse, Alex and I went to downtown PA to get Jesse some Indian food and discussed at great lenght the subject of Batman in his various incarnations (as the animated series is finally starting to come out on DVD next month) and a few of the graphic novels I've actually read. This was followed by a viewing of Aqua Teen Hunger Force, which I had never seen a full episode of. After having seen the first four or so shows, my opinion is that it's pretty funny in a "my god, what were they smoking when they wrote this?" kind of way.

      I got a bunch of stuff today. First of all, I got a whole bunch of speakers (and a joystick) from work, because one of our sister magazines that reviews hardware was clearing out all their old stuff and put a ton of junk up for grabs. I snagged me a couple of loads full of it, though the one set of speakers I've looked at so far has been minus a power cable.   The one I got for myself has five speakers and a subwoofer. Now, who the hell it the maniac who decided we need five speakers? I'm not much of an audiophile, but the whole stereo thing has always worked for me, and I honestly don't notice in a movie theater unless they do some funky thing like play some huge bang from behind the audiance. Where the hell am I going to put all these things? Oh well, they're free.  Second, my Invader Zim DVD showed up. Volume 1: Doom, Doom, Doom. Oh sweet jeebus, I'm going to enjoy watching this again. The commentaries are going to absolutely rock. Oh, in other DVD aquisition news I got a copy of Independance Day and some bizarre William Shatner movie called Shoot Or Be Shot from work that no one else wanted.   And perhaps most significantly, my autographed Terminator memorabilia finally arrived. By that I mean my diploma. I was beginning to wonder if they'd found some way to say I didn't graduate  again - in fact, I'd sent out an email to the Santa Cruz registrar's office a few days ago... I have a sneaking suspicion they were just sitting on it and just sent it out after getting my email.   I also got a reply from Citybank about my credit card application, which they say they're considering despite the fact that they already cashed the check I sent them to set up the credit limit for me to borrow against. Hopefully that'll show up in another week or two and I can start following the grand American tradition of spending imaginary money.  So as a result of all this stuff, my room is now completely covered in boxes and crap. I really need to clean this place one of these days.

      The Angel finale was pretty good. I can't say I approve of their choice of who to kill off in the end, but I realized this was the only way to go when I thought about it the other day- it was the only character that could be resolved that way. All in all, I think they'd have been better served by making the finale arch stretch over three or four episodes rather than just the last two, since it felt a little rushed.

      I hate it when that comes to my attention- usually I prefer blissful ignorance. Ok, so you don't need to be a member of blogger to post on here, I just need to turn off that requirement. Of couse, no one posts on here anyway, so I don't see this as making a huge difference.  The news of the day is that Mr. Mauss is back in town. After work tomorrow something shall have to be done to commemorate the occasion. What that is exactly remains to be seen... if I were a rich man it would probably involve strippers. Then again, if I were a rich man, every night would likely involve strippers. This is why I've decided I need to get rich, and quick.   In other news, my odometer for the day reads 140 miles. If I ever do move to the city, I hope to avoid actually driving there as much as possible. Just getting from one section of 101 to the other is a harrowing experience, even when the reward on the other side is a trip to a LucasArts office to see what they're cooking.   And finally, tonight I watch the finale of Angel, which aired last night but I forgot to watch or download up until this point. After I watch this, there will be officially only like three shows worth watching on TV, and nowhere to go for my Joss Whedon dialogue fix... well, I could check out some new X-Men comics, but it's just not the same. I need to get down to Santa Cruz to reclaim my Firefly DVDs this weekend.

      Didn't do a whole lot today other than work. And I actually had to work today... I didn't get to play any games really. I spent most of the day fishing for mods and trying to get permission to distribute them on short notice, which was annoying. I also had to install like 10 games on my computer to test the mods on. Did you know that Unreal Tournament 2004 has FIVE install discs? Come on people, just put it on a DVD already.   Tomorrow I have 2x the commute ahead of me, since I'm going to a LucasArts place in San Rafael to play a game for a couple of hours. Seems like a long way to go, I know, but apparently it's not terribly unusual for one of us to fly to another country to see a game in development. I'm told my boss flew to Norway once to see Max Payne before it was announced. Right now someone's trying to get him to fly to some former Soviet country to see some WWII submarine game. Amusingly enough, the country is landlocked.   It has come to my attention that you need a blogger account to post comments on here... I guess that'd matter if people were posting comments a lot when there were no restrictions. Plus, the account is free- suck it up, people.

      Well, I finally heard back from the people at that house today telling me that the room has been filled. Gee, thanks. And this came only after I hinted that I'd keep pestering them until I got a reply of some kind.  Man, I had gotten my hopes up for that place. A little premature, considering I hadn't even seen it yet, but it sure sounded good. Now I get to look for another place that's near work, affordable, with parking, shared with sane, non-smoking 20-somethings and has DSL. Sure... those are a dime a dozen. I just spent a half hour or so looking on Craigslist for new prospects, but haven't come up with much that looks even remotely promising. This blows.

      I picked up my first and only physical paycheck at work today- the rest will all be direct deposited into my account. I still can't quite believe they're paying me for this job, but who am I to question? I wrote my first full review today, which I shall review and revise tomorrow before turning it in. Then I just have to take a few screenshots, and it's off to the next game- hopefully this one won't be quite so dull.  In other news, I'm annoyed that this guy at this house I'm still trying to look at still hasn't gotten back to me. I've been calling his cell phone and leaving messages for three days now with no response, and my email has gone unanswered for six days. It's a very odd situation, since you'd think by now he'd have called me back just to tell me to sod off.   I'm also annoyed that this stuipd People On Page software keeps reinstalling itself on my computer after I use AdAware to kill it. I think I've finally finished it off this time- if anyone out there has a folder in their program files folder called sysAI, go delete it. I have n o idea how that crap got on my computer in the first place (I sure as hell didn't install it) but it's been popping up ads every time I go to a web page, somehow circumventing Google's popup blocker. It'd damn well better be gone now. 'Course, I need to reformat sometime soon anyway... I did something to make Windows Media Player die on me, and given how stubborn Microsoft products are about staying alive, that can't be a good sign.

      Today was a typical Sunday... I did next to nothing. I was thinking about going to Santa Cruz, but decided against it in the (as it turns out, futile) hopes that I would get a call from the people at this house I want to look at. I tried calling the number they gave me every couple hours all day with no luck... don't people answer their cell phones these days?  So the highlight of the day was instead a trip to Costco. My new card performed admirably- they didn't kick me out. When I move out I plan to use it a lot, since I'll be living off the free samples.  And of course I watched The Simpsons. I actually braved 8 or 9 minutes of mind-numbing ads and watched it on TV, since I didn't want to bother waiting for the download to finish. It was a funny episode, bashing all the idiot blind patriotism of the post-9/11 era, but... I just miss the days when The Simpsons were basically an animated sitcom, when seldom would they do something you wouldn't see in a live action show, and when they did it was a super good joke. Now it's just a cartoon.

      I just saw Troy, and great googily-moogily did that movie suck ass. I mean, ignoring the wannabe-Gladiator writing, wooden delivery, and run-of-the-mill battles, just how many funeral pyres can we watch before it starts to get a little dull? And how many battles, involving thousands of soldiers on each side, can just completely stop when the two leaders somehow find each other in the fray, identify each other, and fight? And then there's the fact that everyone in the movie was a jerk. I understand having flawed characters, but I didn't want to root for any of these people, I just wanted them to hurry up and die already, which they usually took far too long in doing. Anyway, I'm glad I didn't pay full price to see that movie. Honestly, my student ID is so long expired now I think I could probably have gotten a student discount with a library card.

      So I googled the name of the guy who finally got back to me about that place I want to rent in the city. Turns out he's a software engineer for Electronic Arts who's worked on several of the Tiger Woods golf game series. I don't really see that as a problem though- I mean, Cheney and Scalia can go duckhunting together and Scalia doesn't have to recuse himself from cases involving Cheney, right? Plus I can't imagine they'd give me a golf game to review. Anyway, hopefully this guy will return my phone call soon so I can go check the place out this weekend.

      So, as the title would imply, I made it back in one piece. 'Twas a hell of a thing. The games that impressed me the most were F.E.A.R., which is an amazing looking super-natural shooter kinda thing, Splinter Cell 3, and Black & White 2. I actually got to meet Peter Molyneux, the lead designer of Black & White 1 and 2, along with The Movies, which looks pretty cool too. That was probably the highlight of the show for me.   Well, that and the booth babes. There were actually an unbelievable number of insanely hot women running around. A lot of them were models that were dressed in skimpy outfits, sometimes dressed up like a character from a game, sometimes in just some general theme. Others were public relations people, which would seem to be a favored profession of hot women who don't want to be models. And then there was the occasional girl who was actually looking at the games.   And then there were the parties. There is nothing deadlier than an open bar... I'm lucky to be alive after a run-in with one of those things on Wednesday night at an nVidia party in Hollywood featuring Sugar Ray... could have been a better act, but still, not a bad performance from the part of it I remember. Then on Thursday night our company threw a party on top of a hotel in downtown LA with Wanda Sykes doing standup. I could get used to this kind of treatment.

      I made it down to E3 in one piece, despite our car nearly hitting a dog and a plastic trash can on Highway 5. Now I'm just sitting back and enjoying the free wireless internet access provieded by the Millenium Biltmore hotel and waiting for some events to happen.

      ...and so have I. I'll probably decide I hate this format in a few days and go back to the old one, but a change of pace is nice. They finally built the comments thing into their system, so you can all start not using my official Blogger comments thingie.   What do you think of my picture there on the right? Sexy, no? I call this look "vaguely inquisitive."

      So tomorrow I get to get up early and get in someone's SUV for a 6 hour ride to LA for E3. I have been promised an education in rap (shudder). By the end of this trip I imagine I'll be practically begging for some nice, soothing country music.   I did get a big ol' box of business cards today, which is kinda cool. Tomorrow I'll be passing them out to game companies like a stranger with candy.   You know what's lame? These people who are renting this room I really want to check out still haven't gotten back to me, and I still haven't found anything nearly as nice sounding for the money. And now I'm going to be out of town all week. Lame lame lame.

      Huzzah, the first sunburn of the year. I went to San Gregorio Beach with the fam today, as is our Mother's Day custom. Usually it's overcast and ass-cold (I don't know why we keep going back) but this year it was sunny and warm. I kicked back a few Heinekens and walked around on the beach, saw a seal swimming around in the surf, and ate some burgers. As a result of all that sun time there are some distinct lines where the sunblock I put on ends. Mental note- be more thorough next time. Hopefully this is one of those that will be gone in the morning.  On a related note, I've decided that you're never truely old until you smell old. My parents may be advanced in years (my dad's in his 70's) but they don't have that old-people smell. Some of their friends sure do though.

      Today is a proud day for me. Only a week on the job, and the San Jose Mercury News called game magazines "editorially juvenile" and a "relentlessly negative force" while bitching and moaning about violent video games. I would have preferred to be a relentlessly evil force, but I'll save that for week two or three.  Here's something odd: that place I was all excited about in San Francisco a couple weeks ago was relisted on Craigslist this morning. It's odd because they never got back to me after I emailed them twice- I'd assumed that it'd been rented out from under me. Well, hopefully the third time's the charm.

       urlLink Firefly Episodes  As much as I recommend that you all go out and buy the Firefly DVDs, some of you are too cheap to do so, at least without knowing what you're getting into. For those of you who won't take my word for it that this is one of the very best science fiction shows of the past decade, check out an episode or two and see what you missed. Then go buy the DVDs and start waiting on the movie.

      Whew, I managed to get all my stuff done in time today, and in plenty of time to go out to a sit-down burger joint on the company dime. I also got a bunch of info on E3, with all the game demos and parties I'll be going to- nVidia's having one featuring some band their PR person wouldn't indentify beyond saying they have a hot lead singer. I also got an ID badge identifying me as "Dirk Digner." Since I got there too late to register in my own name they gave me one of the extras the company had signed up for under random names.   I haven't decided how I'm going to spend this weekend yet. Maybe I'll continue the housing search, or maybe I'll go over to Santa Cruz and bug people. Other than that... not much to say. But I have a hankering to start watching Sports Night again.

      Well, I didn't get any cards today, but on Monday I'm getting business cards, just in time to dish them out by the fistfull at E3 next week. After that, the name "DJ Stapleton" will be known far and wide in the game industry. Fortunately the card doesn't say anything about being the MMO guy.  I realized at around 5 today that it was in fact Thursday and not Wednesday as I'd somehow thought it was, which means I have a couple of things due tomorrow that aren't as close to done as I'd like. Well, I should have plenty of time to finish them as long as I don't squander all my time playing City of Heroes like I've been doing. It would be particularly bad form to screw up this early on and miss my first deadline.

      Whee, I got a free Costco card today! Yet another perk of the new job. Pretty sweet deal, huh? When I finally do move out I can start living off of the free samples.  Other than that... not a whole lot goin' on today. I guess the joke's on you, the blog reader, for loading up this page for that useless little tidbit of information.  Bonus material in honor of Cinco De Mayo: The lyrics to Mexico, by Cake.   I had a match  But she had a lighter  I had a flame  But she had a fire  I was bright  But she was much brighter  I was high  But she was the sky  Oh baby  I was bound for Mexico  Oh baby  I was bound to let you go  I don't know much about Cinco de Mayo  I'm never sure what it's all about  But I say I want you  And you don't believe me  You say you want me  But I've got my doubts  Oh baby  I was bound for Mexico  Oh baby  I was bound to let you go  I had a match  But she had a lighter  I had a flame  But she had a fire  I was bright  But she was much brighter  I was high  But she was the sky  Oh baby  I was bound for Mexico  Oh baby  I was bound to let you go  All right.

      I checked out another room in the city today. Pros: *Good people *Nice place *Affordable *DSL  Cons: *Despite being 9 miles from work, it took me 30 minutes to get there from work, compared to the 40 minutes it takes me to travel the 35 miles from here to work. *Parking is scarce, to say the least, and they didn't think highly of the local public transportation. *The room is 9x10, barely big enough for a bed, much less a desk.  But even considering all that, it's the best place I've seen so far. Sad, huh?  Oh, here's a weird thing: at work today I had a person from some game publisher's PR department to invite the EIC to an event they were having at E3, and when she was introduced to me she said "Oh, you must be the new MMO guy." That wouldn't have been so weird if she were the first person to say that. But the EIC said I don't have a "beat" yet... it's quite confusing. Plus, I don't really want to be the MMO guy, because MMO's take forever to review because you have to put countless hours into them in order to get to a point where you've seen a significant portion of the game. And right now the game I'm working on, Lineage II, is an MMO, and it sucks. It's one of those games that's kind of painful to play for more than a couple of hours. Oh well... like they said during my interview: a bad day at this job is still a better day than most people have on a good day at their jobs.

      It's official: I'm hooked on  urlLink City Of Heroes . It's a shame I'm not technically being paid to play that particular game, but since everyone in the office is playing it, they don't seem to mind when I do too. Plus the fact that they constantly shower me with sympathy over the fact that the game I  am  supposed to be reviewing is pretty crappy but still demands that I spend many, many hours on it to get anywhere.  Also, it turns out that while I'm down at E3 next week I'm going to be at a dinner with  urlLink Michelle Rodriguez  of Resident Evil, Blue Crush, S.W.A.T., and The Fast And The Furious fame, since she's been doing some voice work for some upcoming video games. Fortunately I never subjected myself to any of her movies except for Resident Evil, which was actually decent as zombie movies go, so I don't hate her- though I have a feeling that this could change if I were to watch The Fast And The Furious. I can see on her IMDB resume that she wasn't in 2 Fast 2 Furious... what do you have to do to get written out of  that  sequel? I hope for her sake that her character got killed off. Anyway, if anyone can think of any questions I should ask her, let me know.  Either tomorrow or the next day I'll be checking out another apartment in the city. It is my sincere hope that it's not another filthy hole.

      Cheers to those who showed up to Jesse's Party Against Terrorism last night, and jeers to those who didn't. A good time was had by all. I think Jesse should post a scan of the inevitable note his neighbors will leave on his door for everyone to see and laugh at.  In other news, it turns out that when I'm drunk I'm extremely gullible. I'll believe damn near anything, it seems. Also, whenever Jon Weiner shows my blog to someone, I get in trouble- or at least I think I do because I'm too gullible.

      Well, Spider-Man 2 was pretty good, but not as good as I'd hoped.   The positives: a decent story, for a comic book movie; some really bitchin' fight scenes. Oh, and it was free.  Negatives: Slow pacing when focused on Peter Parker (it was a 2 hour movie that felt like 3 hours); every five minutes when focused on Spider-Man he'd take his mask off and a bunch of people saw what he looked like. Not too good for the whole secret identity thing.  All in all, I give it an 85%. Definitely worth watching, but not all it could have been. One final gripe- they tossed in a bunch of cameos from characters that, in the comic books, become villians eventually, but they didn't introduce Eddie Brock. Very dissapointing- that means that it will be at least another couple of movies before they get to Venom, the best Spider-Man bad guy. Oh well, as long as Batman Begins is good, they can do whatever they want with Spider-Man.

      There you are. I have now done everything in my power to get anyone a job at my company... well, everything short of quitting and freeing up my job, that is.  Speaking of my job, I spent three hours today watching developers demo sports games. Football, soccer, hockey and golf. I was the only one available for this little event, and I was sent along dispite having abosolutely no experience with either sports games or the sports themselves. I guess at one time or another I've played all of those sports (if field hockey counts), just very very badly. Oh well, at least it was better than playing the crap game I'm working on now.  Tomorrow morning is Spiderman 2 time. Huzzah! I've heard nothing but good things about it, and despite the trailer ruining just about every aspect of the plot for me I think it's going to be a fun movie. I'll make sure to post my conclusions tomorrow.

      I really have nothing to post about. Oh, there's the absolutely monsterously dull game I started playing at work today... but that doesn't really fall under the category of interesting. I'm still browsing around for a place to live, but I haven't found many promising listings. Maybe I should consider expanding my search beyond Craigslist... nah, I'm entirely too lazy for that.  I guess I could rant on the fact that the Supreme Court, while delivering a minor blow to the Bush administration by ruling that detainees had the right to sue over the fact that they'd been held for years without charges, managed to sidestep the real issue of whether they're allowed to detain people for years without charging them with a crime. They seem to be developing a habit of avoiding the larger issue and delaying any actual progress until they can't avoid it through some piddling technicality in the paperwork.

      I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 this afternoon, and it was pretty damn good. Naturally it made Bush and company look like corrupt fools out to make a buck at the expense of the American taxpayer, which might be slightly exaggerated but probably not far from the mark. The only problem is that no one who was pondering voting for Bush is going to plunk down the $8+ to see it. The only real hope it has of making an impact on the election is to piss off some otherwise apathetic non-voter to the point where they'll vote against Bush this time around.  I also watched Ronin for the first time in a good long while... that movie's got a hell of a car chase, but beyond that it's a fiesta of tired back-stabbing spy movie cliches.

      Last night the Lebowski situation was finally dealt with, complete with white Russians, the way it's meant to be watched. Gotta love that movie... it's so very quoteable. "He treats objects like women, man." Great stuff.  Tonight is one of those anti-social Friday nights, methinks. Which can mean only one thing: time to watch some Simpsons.

      I get to go see Spider-Man 2 on Wednesday morning... and not only am I not paying for it, I'm actually going to be on the clock at the time. A game company is renting out a theater for their employees, and they've invited us along. Pretty sweet deal.  In other movie news, I'm going to have to go see Farenheit 9/11 at some point this weekend. Who wants in?  It's official: Jamie has dropped off the face of the Earth. This is particularly distressing, since he's taken my Firefly DVDs with him.

      Tonight after work I went to another LucasArts thing where they were showing off Star Wars: Battlefront up in the Presidio. They had about 20 people dressed in full stormtrooper armor and another 20 dressed as rebel troops lined up on either side of the walkway leading up to the computers, playstations and Xboxes they had set up out in the middle of a wooded area (which they referred to as Endor). I got a neato swag sweatshirt and a free meal out of the deal, too. And I managed to sneak another meal (they had them in boxes) past the stormtroopers on the way out, so lunch tomorrow is taken care of.  On my way home I went over to Neil's and purchased some second hand DVDs (South Park seasons 1-3) and watched some Joe Shmoe 2, the Spike TV spoof reality show. Far be it from me to condone any fashion of reality television, but this was funny as hell, and if I were to watch one this would be it. It's really more of a candid camera kind of thing than a reality show.  In other random thought news, I need a haircut. I should really get around to that at some point.

      I don't know if it's gotten worse lately or I just notice it more now that I'm in my car for about 2 hours a day, but the constant skipping is driving me nuts. It has nothing to do with going over bumps - the best coorelation I've come up with is temperature. If it's hot out (which it invariably is this time of year) it skips like crazy. I'm thinking about shelling out for a new one that'll not only not skip but also play MP3s, though I'm thinking that before I blow $200 on it I should wait and make sure that I'll be taking that car with me when I move out.  This evening's entertainment: The Big Lebowski. I've owned that movie for a few weeks now and I still haven't watched it (since buying it). This must be remedied.

This means you, Dan Stapleton the magician, Dan Stapleton the architecht, Dan Stapleton the Australian author of the strangely popular article "Gays Are Doing It For Themselves - In Caricature Development," Dan Stapleton the archer, Dan Stapleton the Canadian freelance web designer, Dan Stapleton the star of 1964 horror flick "I Eat Your Skin," and all the other pretenders to the throne.  Oh, and Simpsons Season 4 update: I've now watched Treehouse of Horror III as well.

      I fear my poor sunglasses may be nearing the end of their lifespan. They've been through a lot of abuse in the past 10 months or so since I've had them, and they've weathered it well. From the general scuffs and scratches to getting slammed in my car door and left sticking half in and half out of the car overnight, that sort of thing. Yesterday I sat on them though, and I think that might have been the ass that broke the glasses' back. They still work in that they keep the sun out of my eyes, but they no longer meet the bare minimum asthetic requirements that I try (not always successfully) to maintain. Oh well... not bad for a $20 pair. Maybe I'll get some wacky aviators or something for my next pair.  The Fam' departed this afternoon, but they were here long enough to pretty much kill the whole day for anything else. At this point I'm just loafing around doing nothing. I did post another desperate plea for housing on Craigslist though, so that's sort of like being productive.  Simpsons Season 4 DVD episodes watched so far: Kamp Crusty A Streetcar Named Marge Homer The Heretic Lisa The Beauty Queen  Itchy & Scratchy: The Movie  And they're all fucking  brilliant .

      Once again, the sun has taken me by surprise, beaten me up and stolen my lunch money. I got fried as I walked around Santa Cruz with Jenna after our lunch at the Crepe Place. Why the hell doesn't my skin learn its lesson and freaking tan already? I mean, I know that my ancestors in Ireland, France and Poland probably saw the sun for a combined total of 15 minutes over the past 500 years, but come on.   After visiting with Jenna I met up with Kelsey and gave her her one week overdue graduation gift (Buffy Season 1) and then watched Dodgeball. It was formulaic, predictable and juvenille, but it managed to be entertaining despite it all. It had quite a cast: Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Christine Taylor, Rip Torn, Alan Tudyk (Wash from Firefly), Hank Azaria, William Shatner, Chuck Norris, Lance Armstrong, and David Hasselhoff as the coach of a German team.  Then I rushed home for a meal at family favorite Chef Chu's and gorged myself on kung pao chicken. Damn tasty stuff.

      Well that was fun, but not something I'll want to do too often. I mean, I had to get up at 6:00 for chrissakes, and all I got out of the deal was a trip down to LA to play an awesome looking video game for an hour and then ride in a beer-equipped limo to lunch and then back to the airport. As it turns out, Heineken tastes better when you're moving.   I did manage to forget to take my little multi tool thing off my keychain before going through security, which didn't go too well... fortunately I was able to run back to my car and stash it and still made the plane. And on the way back the limo driver dropped me off at the International arrivals United terminal instead of domestic departures, and then they didn't bother mentioning a gate change until my flight had already started boarding seven gates away (I'd been sitting at the original gate for three hours, so they must have assumed that everyone who showed up at a reasonable time already knew), and then I was seated in the very back of the plane right next to the bathroom so I got a nosefull of bathroom air... but other than that it was an enjoyable trip.  I got most of my article written on my laptop on the plane on the way back, which finally justifies (somewhat) my spending all that money on the thing.   Oh, and I picked up Kelsey's graduation present finally. I'll be delivering it on Saturday afternoon. Hopefully I'll be able to drop in on Jenna too while I'm down in Santa Cruz.

      My Simpsons Season 4 DVDs showed up in the mail today. Sometimes that Amazon free shipping will surprise you- it just left their warehouses on Monday. This season contains several of what could be called my favorite episodes (which is hard to say, since I have so many "favorites") including Homer The Heretic, A Streetcar Named Marge, Marge Vs. The Monorail, Brother From The Same Planet, Mr. Plow, Whacking Day, and Treehouse of Horror III. Not to put down in any way the other episodes in the season, since as we all know The Simpsons never had even a mediocre episode between seasons 2 and 8. Each and every one ranks between great and genius.  Tomorrow I go down to LA. For a while there today it was looking like the trip was going to fall through, since a certain game company was being snooty about the amount of space they were getting and threatening to call the whole thing off. But in the end they folded like a card table and the trip was back on. So tomorrow I have to get up early and hop on a plane out of San Jose at 8:50 and head down to LAX won't get back to San Jose 'till around 7:15 at night. I'll probably be killing some time down there, unless they let me play the game for all 8 hours.  You know the saying "there's no such thing as a free lunch?" Well, today I got a free 5x5 from In-N-Out, and the only price was having a picture of me stuffing it in my face printed in a nationally published magazine read by around 300,000 people. On top of that, I got free pizza courtasy of Sony Online Entertainment while checking out EverQuest II. I am, after all, the MMO guy... for some reason.   After all that on top of this last weekend of gorging myself, I'm thinking it may be time to get back on the whole diet thing again.

      I'm going to be in LA from 10am to 6pm this Thursday. Mark your calendars... for some reason.   I listened to Eddie Izzard's newest routine, "Sexie," today, and I have to say I'm a bit disapointed. It seems like it's made up of all his B material, like the slow parts between his good stuff. I mean, it's not like it's UNfunny, but I feel he could do better. I've got to look into when he's coming to San Francisco next, because I'd still love to see him live. I've decided I need to see more standup comedy.  Jesse and I watched Ghostbusters tonight. It's easy to forget just how fantastic a movie that is... so many awesome lines.   In other news, my new target date for moving out of the house is August 1st. I'd say July, except that I'm going to be going to Canada for the last week in July and I'm not overeager to start out paying rent for time I'm not going to be there. So now I'm going to start looking for people who plan way ahead for this kind of thing in the hopes that something awesome will drop in my lap. That'd be nice, wouldn't it?

      What the fuck is with the goddamn Supreme Court? Overturning the Pledge ruling because of some idiot technicality that doesn't even makes sense. They say that the guy who brought the case doesn't have the right to sue because his wife has custody of their daughter and she doesn't object to the "under God" shit, but I don't see how that makes the slightest bit of difference. For one thing, at some point I imagine he probably had at least partial custody over her while she was in school, which makes the complain valid. And besides which, he himself would have had to hear that blatantly goverment endorsed religious propaganda as a student. And even beyond that, he could sue on behalf of potential future children. This whole thing is a stupid, stupid waste of everyone's time by sidestepping the issue and making people go back and change the wording just to get back to the point where Rhenquist and his conservative nutjob cronies have to admit that they'd lose if they actually had to vote on the issue. It espeically pisses me off because rational people were primed for such a victory, with Scalia recusing himself and out of the way. Dumb bastards.  I saw the trailer for Michael Moore's new film, Farenheit 9/11, and man does it look good. The last bit in the trailer is a shot of Bush on a golf course talking to reporters saying, "I call upon all the nations of the world to do everything they can to fight against these evil terrorist murderers. Now watch this drive," as he takes his shot. Almost as funny as it is scary. And then there's the part where he tries to get some congressmen to sign their kids up for the Army to go to Iraq, and where he talks to some people who say that most people in Congress never actually read the PATRIOT Act before they passed it. I want to see this movie.  At work today I was assigned to take a flight down to LA on Thursday and meet with some Electronic Arts people to play a new game, then fly home. That should be a hell of a thing... I've never done that kind of thing before.   Oh, in DVD news, my Simpsons Season 4 shipped today. Huzzah! Though just as one thing comes off my cue, another is added: Futurama Volume 4 is set for August.

      Due to circumstances beyond my control I've been too tired/lazy to post here for the last couple of days. I spent most of my weekend in Santa Cruz (or driving back and forth between here and there) watching people graduate, eating, and just hanging out. I got to see a bunch of people I ain't seen in a good long while, and probably won't see again for at least an equally long time, so it was definitely worth the effort and sunburn.  On Friday I got off work an hour early and made it down to Santa Cruz at 7, and I took Bubba, Maggie and Ryan to dinner at my favorite restaurant (at least when they have their specials on Wednesdays and Fridays) The Ideal Bar & Grill. I was slightly dissapointed that they'd raised their price for a giant chunk of prime rib from $10 to $12, but it's still a damn good deal. We were joined by Eric Fong, Newton, and his girlfriend Tammy.   After dinner we went back to the house on Northrop and had a couple of drinks and hung out until Kelsey got home, at which point she violated Bubba in the worst way imaginable. Just ask and I'll send you the video clip. At the end of the evening we drove back here for the sleeping. We managed to get to bed at about 1:30, after an episode of Invader Zim.  On Saturday morning, in a bizarre twist of events, I got up at 7, which is earlier than I've gotten up since I started working I think. Bubba and I ate some random stuff around the house, and Maggie has some kind of hideous mutant gland that allows her to live off of Starbucks' coffee. Then we hopped in the car and went back over to Santa Cruz where we walked around downtown checking out bookshops and just wandered aimlessly until we met up with Justin, Than Thuy and her boyfriend, and another set of people for Thai food. I got some crazy shrimp-kabob things sticking out of a whole onion. It wasn't quite what I'd expected, but still pretty good.  This was followed by more aimless wandering as a group, and that almost invariably leads to Camoflauge. After the rest of the group disbanded Bubba, Maggie and I went to see Justin's house, which was very nice and as it turns out was shared with (and owned by the family of) a girl I went to high school with. I never really knew her, but our dads had co-coached a little league soccer team our brothers had been on.  A bit later Eric Morgan showed up, and we all went to a couple of bars. It's really weird about Santa Cruz that no one bothers to enforce that whole no smoking in bars thing. Everywhere else around here they're pretty good about it, even in the dive bars like Ugly's. At The Red Room it seemed like everyone and their mother had a cigarette, and the "candles" on the tables are thinly disguised ash trays. I didn't drink on account o' the drivin,' and I subscribe to the philosophy of "if you're not going to get drunk, why drink at all?" We headed back here at around midnight and, after another Zim episode, got to bed.  Saturday was the big day, and somehow we all managed to get showered and out of here in time to stop for a bagel and still make it to Santa Cruz and meet up with Newton and Angelica for the 9am Crown graduation cerimony. I got to watch Kelsey, Eric Fong, Jenna, Sarah Hunter, Justin, Crystal, Victoria, Alex, and a bunch of other people I haven't seen since before I graduated (or earlier) do their little walk across the stage to collect their rolled up fake diplomas. Like I said, it was worth the sunburn. You can clearly see on my face where I neglected to put sunscreen... I'm just lucky no one wrote "wash me" in sunsceen on me. We went to the reception at Crown and then went back to the house at Northrop just to hang out for a while.   After Eric Morgan had to leave ('cause he's a wuss) we went back up to campus for Newton's graduation thing at Oakes, but Bubba and I gave up on that and came back here to get his and Maggie's stuff, since they'd neglected to think ahead and decided that they were going to sleep in Santa Cruz that night. We all just hung out and ate pizza and watched Family Guy and drank some until I had to come home 'cause of the whole working thing.   I miss Maggie already... Fatman lives down south too, but at least he's online all the time so I can berate him daily. Maggie is one of those weird people that can survive without internet access... must be that mutant gland in action again. Oh, and I owe Kelsey a graduation gift. I really should have had that handy this weekend, but by the time I started looking for it I couldn't find what I wanted in time. I'm going to have to go down there again next weekend sometime to give it to her, but that works out anyway because I told Jenna I'd hang out with her before she leaves and goes down south too. Hopefully by then my skin graft will have taken care of this sunburn.

      Tomorrow Bubba and Maggie come to town. I'm meeting them down in Santa Cruz for dinner, then we're all coming back up here to sleep so that they don't get gouged by the greedy bastard hotels down there that like to jack up their prices right around graduation time.   In the meantime, I'm actually getting a little behind in my work. I know that sounds hard to understand, since it's tricky to do so when your job invovles mostly playing games all day, but in this particular case I'm hunting all over the damn place looking for mods. In itself this isn't too difficult, but when you put a bunch of restrictions on it like saying it has to be something from a game made within the last couple of years and not for the same game as one of the mods we've covered recently and that it preferably shouldn't be a Star Wars mod (you'd be surprised how much that last one limits you), then you start to have problems. Especially when you see all these ambitious mods that are started and never finished. So that's what I was doing all day today, and likely tomorrow and Monday and Tuesday as well. And while I'm at it I need to write up a review and a preview for a couple more games. Somehow this is starting to become actual work.

      Congratulations to Kelsey, who finished her last undergrad class today. Huzzah! Now I've just got to find a graduation present for you... do you like video games?  Hey, what's that under yesterday's post? A comment! Naturally it's from some stranger who is under the misguided impression that I'm in a position to get anyone a job, but still. It's the thought that counts- you could all learn something from this girl. Sorry to dissapoint you Stephanie, but I'm on the bottom rung at the moment. Though I admire your asking for a job without even knowing where I work.  Just to follow up yesterday's comments, I was not at all dissapointed by today's Onion: "Reagan's Body Dies" and "Grieving Rush Limbaugh Hurls Self Into Reagan's Grave." And of course, "Reagan To Be Honored With $5,000-A-Head Funeral."   I also stopped at Fry's after work and picked up two of the best games ever for a song. I got their last copy of a Fallout 1 and 2 two pack for $4.99, which is especially good considering Amazon has it priced at $24.99 and eBay is similar. Now I just need to find the time to play them again. Oh, and thanks to my second trip to LucasArts in San Rafael, I picked up copies of the last two Jedi Knight games for free. Pretty sweet- I love my job.

      The problem with having a blog is the feeling that I have to actually do stuff so I have something to write about. Well, today I spat in the face of my responsibilities and did nothing at all out of the ordinary.   Thus, I have nothing to write about except for random thoughts and observations. For example, I am anxiously awaiting tomorrow's Onion update because I want to see what horrible disrespectful yet hysterical article they write about Reagan. It's gonna be great.   I also saw some pictures of Christian Bale as Batman, and I am pleased to report that he looks nothing at all like George Clooney. That's really all I ask at this point. I'm still a little weirded out by the funky Batmobile, but I'm cautiously optimistic that this movie will be decent.  I have a hankering to play Fallout 1 and 2 for some reason. Well, the reason is that they're the best RPGs ever made, but I'm not certain what brought on the urge at this particular time. I'm going to have to go by Fry's tomorrow to see if they've still got the two pack on sale for like $10.   Here's my  urlLink Amazon.com wishlist , in case anyone wants to buy me stuff for the hell of it. You know you do.

      Rather than make any kind of progress toward a decision on where when and how to move out, I've decided to watch Sports Night again. Up yours, real world.  Oh, and  urlLink here's something scary for all those who fear the collapse of the seperation of church and state . And while I'm pointing people to Snopes.com, remember: before forwarding any tear-jerking chain emails on to me or anyone else whose friendship you might want to maintain, search for it on Snopes to see if it's been floating around online for the past several years.

      Well, disregard that part about finding a place in the city. I was under the delusional impression that public transportation would be able to get me from there to Brisbane in around a half hour... silly me. It's all very disapointing, considering how nice the apartment I was looking at was and how cool the potential roommates were.   So now that I've gotten a reality check on the public transportation system, I'm questioning the whole nature of the plan to move to the city. If I were actually working there it'd be no problem, but living there and commuting out of the city just doesn't seem to be worth it. I think it'd cost me around $75 per month in public transportation just getting to and from work, and it'd take an hour each way. Paying $700 a month to double my commute time isn't what I had in mind. I mean, I could take my car there, but the idea of driving in the city is simply terrifying, and the likelyhood of it getting broken into is discouragingly high.  My alternative is to live in Pacifica, San Mateo or Hillsborough or somewhere around there, south of the city but much closer than here. If I were to take my car, I'd be paying that $75 in insurance alone, plus probably another $50 per month in gas... but the commute time would be 15-20 minutes, which defintely sounds nice compared to the 35-40 minutes I'm doing now. And then there's the simple convenience of having a car at the ready, and hopefully I'd get more for my money there. It's worth looking into anyway.

      I haven't had time to post for the last couple of days because of stuff I'll go into later when I have more time. Right now I'll just mention that I've just placed my order for  urlLink The Simpsons Season 4 DVDs , release date June 15, and that I think I may have found a place to move to in the city in July.

      My cousin and his wife came to town from Indianapolis tonight, and we all went out to this Afghani restaurant called Kabul in Sunnyvale. My Dad really liked the place when he'd eaten there before, yet he had a hell of a time finding it. It was worth it though- those Afghanis make a mean lamb dish.   Based on my love of lamb, I have come up with a theory that the cuter an animal is, the better it tastes. According to this logic, puppies and kittens must be delicious... Unfortunately, the theory does have it's problems, because if you turn it around then a chicken must be almost exactly as cute as a rabbit. Though something has just occured to me: baby chicks are adoreable. Huzzah, my theory holds water!

      So I went and checked out a place right next to the City College of San Francisco after work today. It seemed like a decent room in a decent house with a decent roommate, but he really talked himself out of a sale. He was saying how he was only staying until the lease was up in October and then he was moving to the Sunset because it wasn't worth paying the premium to be right next to CCSF if you don't go there. So I thought, hey, wait a second,  I  don't go there. And thus another place was scratched off my list of possibilities.

      This contest is over, give these guys the $10,000!   urlLink BUSHGAME.COM - THE ANTI-BUSH ONLINE ADVENTURE   All you need to play it is your web browser. It's entertaining AND educational. I can't recomend it highly enough.  I ate a burger at Burger King for lunch today. I got one of their super-premium top of the line ones, even springing for bacon and cheese, and it still tasted bland. I don't know how they manage it. I think I'll stick to In-N-Out in the future. While I was out, I also picked up a DVD of The Big Lebowski, which is entirely too good a film to not buy for $10.  When I got back to work the fire alarm went off. There was a fire drill scheduled for last week that got cancelled, so we just assumed this was it and we ignored it, but eventually the alarm got too annoying so we went outside. Then we saw a fire truck drive up. It turned out there was still no fire, but it calls to mind the inherent "boy who cried wolf" danger of fire drills.  So I've been thinking about not taking my car with me when I move out. If I live in the city, there'd be nowhere to park it, plus I'd be able to get to work on the bus for less than I'm paying in gas to commute now. Then there's the matter of insurance and whatever else might go wrong with a 12 year old car. And if I don't have a garage to park in it will almost certainly get broken in to. I'm thinking it might not be worth it.

      24 hours from now I plan to have been in the air for about 40 minutes. On account of the whole "job" thing, I'm catching a late flight and hopefully sleeping on the plane in order to get the most out of my 5 days worth of vacation time... which I technically haven't built up yet.   I intend to pack my usual three weeks worth of relaxing into one, which means I'll be very busy sailing, playing cards, and drinking plenty of Canadian beer.   I'm also leaving the packing to the last minute, because where's the excitement in going on vacation if you know you've brought everything you'll need?   I drove down to Santa Cruz tonight and picked up a bunch of my furniture I'd left down there when I moved out since I had nowhere to put it here. I still have nowhere to put it here... it's currently on the back porch covered in a tarp. If anyone needs any end tables or a couple of chairs, let me know. In theory, I might be able to use some of that stuff when I move out... but it's not a very scientifically sound theory.

      Ug... I let Jesse talk me into going to Krispy Kreme to try out their new frozen beverages tonight, one of which is actually advertized as tasting like a doughnut. I couldn't bring myself to order that, so I just had a chocolate one. Having tried it, I'm pretty sure they found a way to actually make a drink out of calories.  Today was a momentus day at work... I got to threaten to sue people's asses. People like to take our big reviews and post them on message boards, so I had to track down email addresses for the moderators and lay down the law.

      Random observation of the day: The problem is with women these days, in my experience, is that too many of them have standards.   In other news, there really is no other news. I get up, I go to work and do stuff no one but uber-nerds are the slightest bit interested in, and then I come home and do more stuff no one cares about... and yet I keep a blog for all to see. A bit self incriminating, isn't it? Take that, Fifth Amendment!  So I've taken up drinking alone. I felt my sitting around at home was lacking that certain dramatic flair. You know what the best part is? No one yells "party foul" when you spill.

      Well, I'm just about finished with my contribution to my third issue of the mag, so this week is going to be pretty easy going.   And it occurs to me that in a matter of days I'm going to Canada for nine days. Huzzah! I guess this means I'm not going to make my self-imposed deadline of moving out by August 1st... ok, new deadline: September 3rd, my 24th birthday. I do not want to turn 24 living at home, so this deadline actually has a little weight behind it unlike the previous two.   In other random news, I've been spending a few hours lately arguing politics with a  urlLink movie star  online. It's kind of irritating to know that one of the actors on one of my favorite  urlLink shows /most anticipated  urlLink movies  ever is a rabid conservative, but at the same time it's very cool that he goes online and chats with the fans.

      I think you're always best off going into a movie thinking "This is going to suck." That way, when you occasionally see something that doesn't suck, it's a pleasent surprise. Such was the case with I, Robot (or in Espanol, "Yo, Robot") which I saw with Ryan and Kelsey this evening. Some of the action scenes were a bit over the top, including a crazy motorcycle stunt reminceint of Mission Impossible II and some weird camera stuff in the finale, but the plot was much better than I thought it'd be, and it had some good lines. My favorite: "I think he wanted me to kill you." Another downside was Alan Tyduk's voice was processed a little too much, and you could barely tell it was him playing the robot, but he did a good job with the part.  Earlier we tried to go to the Boardwalk and then Mystery Spot (I don't live in Santa Cruz anymore, so it's ok for me to go to touristy places) but both places were too crowded. So we ended up just eating at Planet Fresh and then going to Coldstone's, followed by sitting around the house for a while and then the movie.  Before I left I got to loot the liquor cabinet, and I've now got the beginnings of my own little stash. Maybe I'll take up drinking alone...  I'm going to have to go back down there sometime this week to pick up some of the furniture I left, since I wasn't smart enough to remember to bring the van this time. Gotta get it before everybody moves out at the end of the month.

      Everybody's moving but me. Bubba just moved into his new apartment, Eric just moved, Kat's moving, Ryan and Kelsey are moving... I really need to get me a place.   So I managed to take some work home with me this weekend. Note to self: don't make a habit of that. Especially since I volunteered to do it... sort of. Oh well, just one more week and I'm headed back to Canada for my very first vacation.  I'm planning on heading over to Santa Cruz tomorrow to hang out with Ryan and Kelsey a little before Ryan heads back down south and they move out of the ole' Northrop house for good. 'Tis sad to see the place go, especially since I'm never going to find a place that nice to move to in the city.

      I picked up a free Palm III at work today. It's probably close to 10 years old. I have no idea whether it works or not, but I've never had a PDA and I figured I'd give it a shot. I'm sure I won't use it for much of anything productive.  You know who's cool? Thomas Jefferson. By far the coolest president ever. A few choice quotes of his on the topic of religion:  "Millions of innocent men, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined and imprisoned; yet we have not advanced one inch towards uniformity." -Thomas Jefferson, Notes on Virginia, 1782.  "History, I believe, furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people maintaining a free civil government. This marks the lowest grade of ignorance of which their civil as well as religious leaders will always avail themselves for their own purposes." -Thomas Jefferson to Alexander von Humboldt, Dec. 6, 1813.  "Christianity neither is, nor ever was a part of the common law." -Thomas Jefferson, letter to Dr. Thomas Cooper, February 10, 1814  "In every country and in every age, the priest has been hostile to liberty. He is always in alliance with the despot, abetting his abuses in return for protection to his own." -Thomas Jefferson, letter to Horatio G. Spafford, March 17, 1814

      I'm back from my international day trip. 'Twas fun, but entirely too much time spent at the airport for two two hour flights. And on the way back they swabbed my laptop for some reason... I have no idea what the rationale for that might have been, but the result of their little test was negative. And of course, as usual, they seated me as far from the good looking girls that were on each flight as possible... on the way back I got stuck next to some fat woman who had to put the arm rest between us up. *Shudder*  Vancouver is a nice town though. I only wish downtown San Francisco was that clean and nice looking. And only one guy offered to sell me pot. What a country.

      I just watched Casablanca for the first time. I like to think of myself as a movie fan, but there are a whole lot of classic movies I've never seen. It's amazing though how many scenes I recognized from parodies. Yes, mostly The Simpsons... Anyway, I thought it was a very good movie, but probably overrated in the grand scheme of things.   This afternoon I went down to the Los Altos Art & Wine Festival, which for those of you who don't know, is an event where they block off all of downtown and put up a bunch of booths hawking overpriced trinkets and artwork to rich Los Altos snobs. I walked up and down the street a few times, but left after I'd made sure there wasn't anything I could afford and saw they wanted $7 for a glass of beer.

      As it turns out, I'm going to be going to Canada twice this month. There's my usual (though abbreviated) family vacation from the 24th to August 1st which I will be spending  urlLink here  in Ontario, plus next Wednesday I will be flying to  urlLink Vancouver, British Columbia  to play a game. One of these days I should really break down and get myself a passport... it'd be easier than hauling my birth certificate around for this kind of thing.   In other news, when I opened my Batman DVDs last night, out fell a coupon for one free ticket to see  urlLink Catwoman . I find it amusing as hell that I'm still torn about whether or not to go see it... is it worth my time? Probably not. I wonder if it will be funny bad, or "I want my two hours back" bad. Maybe I'll just use the coupon for a ticket and then go into a different movie... is there anything else out I want to watch?

      My Batman TAS Season 1 DVDs were waiting for me when I got home from work today. Now I just need to finish Simpsons Season 4 so that I can start watching them. I've only got one more episode to watch (Krusty Gets Kancelled) but I've got like five or six commentaries to listen to. Oh, that reminds me- I was a bit dissapointed to learn that the Batman DVDs only have two commentary tracks out fo 28 episodes... kind of dissapointing.   I think I figured out what was making my brother's computer crash (and about time too, since he's getting back tomorrow). There was some app running in the background called Soundman.exe. I don't know how it got there, though from what I'm seeing from my Googling it, it was either a systray app for a sound card he doesn't have or part of a worm. I'll have to hook up his computer again tomorrow and check for further signs of infection. In any case, I think that's what was causing the computer to crash when playing MP3s or DVDs. I trashed it and the problem seems to have gone away for the time being.

      Today out of nowhere my boss tossed me a copy of Johnny The Homicidal Maniac autographed by Jhonen Vasquez. He'd seen my Squee! t-shirt and my Invader Zim desktop background, and apparently he knows Jhonen. Pretty snazzy. "I never drank her blood! Never! But I needed it!! You see!! It changes color when it dries! IT NEVER STAYS!! I HAVE TO KEEP THE WALL WET!!"  In other news, the housing search continues. I went and saw a place today that looked pretty nice, but was a bit farther away from work than I'd have liked- it's all the way on the other side of the city. I think I'll pass. But I've got another couple of leads that look somewhat promising, so I'm not completely discouraged.

      I realized today that I have almost $1000 worth of DVDs, at an average of $15 per movie and $30 per TV show season. So THAT'S where all my money goes. Kind of frightening. I think that after Futurama Season 4, The Star Wars Trilogy, Invader Zim Vol. 2, and Batman: The Animated Series (which shipped to me today) I'm going to have to put a hold on DVD purchases for a while. I'm thinking I'm going to go through and watch everything I own, since I've been feeling like I haven't been getting my money's worth out of them all. Maybe I'll sell off some of the ones I don't like as much, like Sleepy Holow, The World Is Not Enough, or The Mask Of Zorro. The rest are all pretty much essential.  Today Jason and I ran into Paul Ruvalo, Mike Chan, and Ognen Stojanovski (yes, I had to look up the spelling) at Los Charros today. All of the sudden I'm seeing a bunch of random people from high school... quite unsettling.   I didn't post last night because I came home drunk after going to Santa Clara with Jamie and Arcia to watch a fireworks show and then played speed quarters badly enough to ensure I drank more than my fair share of beer. 'Twas a fine celebration of the birth of our nation.

      My plans for sleeping in this morning were foiled by the menace of dehydration, which caused me to wake up at 8am and being unable to get back to sleep. The hangover itself was minor, but I was wide awake.  I spent my day hanging out with one of my younger cousins, who is very into Japanese culture for some reason. He was constantly trying to explain anime stuff to me, which has been tried before with little success. It's just too damn weird for me.   So while that was going on I tinkered with my brother's computer, trying to figure out why it had been crashing on him. I couldn't get it to reproduce the crashes he was talking about, which he says happen when he plays MP3s or watches DVDs, but I did experience something entirely new when I tried to boot up the first time. Specificly, it wouldn't boot up at all. I managed to fix that problem by reseating the RAM and ancient video card and clearing away a ton of dust, which may or may not have actually had anything to do with the problem, but after rebooting a few more times it seemed to clear up. I have no idea what's wrong with the damn thing... but that's the sort of thing you expect to run into with an uber-cheap system.  After playing "I dunno, what do  you  want to do tonight" for a while with Jesse and Jamie, we eventually settled on aimlessly wandering the streets of downtown Palo Alto. We were joined by Chris and Liz, and special guest Liz Ripatoe, who I don't think I've seen since high school. Then we went into extra innings with a late night viewing of Van Wilder, your typical crazy college party movie featuring Tara "I'll suck your dick for $1000" Reid and her very Paris Hilton-esque glazed over stare. I have to say, I was dissapointed by the "unrated" version on the DVD... I expected far more gratuitous nudity.

      I'm having difficulty typing, so you know that means I had a good time at Jesse's party. It was at his rich friend's house, and as you know rick people aren't real people like you and me, so they don't mind if we act like fools there. A good time was definitely had by all. Plenty to eat, plenty to drink, and a giant damn movie theater in the damn house. You know, before tonight I'd thought that the word casbah had been made up for that song, but as it turns out it's an actual kind of place in a rich person's huge ass house.

      I hate Highway 101. It's just amazing how much more traffic is on that road than 280. I had to drive down 101 for a mere 8 miles today to go check out a room in an apartment, and it took me like a half hour. As a result I didn't get to see the place because I missed my appointment and the guy had to leave. Oh well, I don't think I'll be moving there anyway, since that commute would suck. Sitting in traffic for 30 minutes is more aggrivating than having to drive for 40.  My brother's out of town for a week, so he left me his computer to iron out some bugs. For some reason it's been crashing a lot when he plays music or DVDs... I'm thinking there's some kind of funky audio problem going on. I'd suspect the sound card, except that it's built in to the motherboard. I'll have to do some testing on it to identify what the hell is going on... it's annoying to know that I put together a computer that crashes all the time, even if I did do it for under $300.

      Some Bush supporters are running ads featuring Viet Nam vets claiming to have served with John Kerry saying that they don't trust him as a leader and that he lied about his purple hearts. From what I've seen, they're full of crap.  For one thing, none of these idiots ever served on Kerry's boat. Of the six guys that did, five of them support him. The other guy is dead.   For another thing, these are the same group of jackasses that went after John McCain in 2000 attacking HIS war record.  McCain, being the one respectable republican I can think of,  urlLink codemned the ads , calling them "dishonest and dishonorable." He asked Bush to denouce the group, but as you'd expect Bush declined to do it. Sleazy, sleazy bastard.

      Today I brought home a copy of Doom 3, and tomorrow I'm bringing home a free ATI Radeon 9800 graphics card to play it on. I love my job.   My current card (an MSI GeForce 4 Ti4400 128MB) plays it alright, but it's over two years old now and it's really showing its age on newer stuff like Far Cry and Doom. The Radeon 9800 is a generation ahead of the GeForce 4, and at one point they were selling for around $400. Now they're a generation behind of the top of the line chip, but they're still snazzy.  I've never had an ATI graphics card before... I'd feel kind of guilty for ditching nVidia after three cards if this weren't free. I had a 16MB TNT2 when I first got my PC, which I recently dug out and put in my brother's machine, then I upgraded to a 64MB GeForce2 MX, then I sold that when I got my current one. I guess I'll probably give my current one to my brother when I get the new one, since you can't do much with a 16MB graphics card these days... not that he plays a lot of games, but still.  I've started playing Doom 3 on the veteran difficulty setting. I don't know why anyone would want to play a relatively short single player game like this on low or medium difficulty, especially if they paid for it. If I were to shell out the $50 they wanted for this thing I'd want it to last as long as possible. Of course, because of that kind of thinking I still haven't finished playing Far Cry...  In non-nerd news, I'm checking out a place in San Bruno tomorrow after work. I have only one request: that it not suck. Is that so much to ask?

      Well, back to normal in that I have nothing much to write about, anyway. I'm back on the hunt for a place, though I haven't seen much jumping out at me. I'm planning on going to Santa Cruz on Saturday afternoon to hang out with Kelsey and check out her new place and watch a movie (probably Collateral), but other than that I have no plans for the foreseeable future. I guess I'll just read or something... I need to read more.

      Ok, so here's a brief summary of my vacation: I played a whole lot of  urlLink euchre  with my family, with the traditional family stakes of the loser having to go swimming (or at least go underwater). This made things interesting for the first few days of the week, since the weather wasn't very good and the water was freezing. Unfortunately, it was during these days that I was on a horrible losing streak, and I probably went swimming an average of three times a day. My luck improved slightly by the end of the week, but I still spent a lot of time in the water.  Also on account of the weather I only got in one good sailing day. It started out windy but way too cold, and then it got sunny but calm. But at least I got to sail some... I'd have been very dissapointed otherwise.  I got to spend lots of time with my cousins and my uncle and aunt, which is always nice. There have been years when I've been out there for three weeks and not seen as much of them as I did during this one.   They're all from the midwest, so a lot of them (well, just the men, now that I think about it) are republicans, which makes it somewhat interesting. My uncle tried to bar politics as a subject of discussion, but that didn't hold up very well considering the DNC was going on, especially after my cousin Tom showed up with his Sean Hannity book entitled "Deliver Us From Evil: Defending America From Terrorism, Despotism, And Liberalism."   Man do I hate Sean Hannity. I read over it a little, and there wasn't a single page that didn't disgust me. There was one part in his book where he said "As everyone knows, Bill Clinton turned down an offer from the Sudanese government to hand over Bin Laden, a miscalculation of enormous proportion" (or something to that effect). As his source for this claim, he references  his own book . I remembered this from Lies And The Lying Liars Who Tell Them- the whole story was based on the word of some private individual who claimed to be acting as a middleman for the Sudan, and he said they would give us Bin Laden in exchange for dropping the sanctions against the Sudan that were in place because they shelter terrorists and still practice slavery, among other things. But when the US asked them about it directly they didn't make the offer. And yet Hannity faluts Clinton for not dealing with a shadey guy claiming to represent a shadey country. Moron.  But anyway, I enjoyed the hell out of my vacation, other than the fact that it was too short. I'm just glad I got to go at all, considering I've only been working three months and I was allowed to take a week off. I would have been very upset to break my streak of 23 consecutive years of going to Canada.

      Well, over my strong objections, I'm back from Canada. Lousy cushy job... oh well. I'm now about ready to collapse due to the whole time zone thing, so don't expect much out of me by way of an update just yet.
