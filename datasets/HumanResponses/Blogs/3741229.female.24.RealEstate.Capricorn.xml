      Well, this weekend "no pare la pata" like we say in spanish.  My mom calls me on Friday after work that she's coming down on Saturday to continue looking for a place.  Then, it was so hot that Redny and I went to the pool after I rode around with her for about 3 hours.  I got to see my princess Brandy. She got so happy to see me. My mom loved my place.  Damn, I'm skipping occurrences of my Saturday day. I'm that tired!    Then Sunday we rode to the Keys, again! Every single weekend we are over there! So we went to "La Playita".  It's a hidden small beach down passing Isla Morada that Monique and Javier found or something like hat and they did Bar-B-Q and we went for a while. I wanted to go to the tikki bar for a rum runner but my husband decided to go fishing.  No luck.  We then saw 2 sting rays, I mean HUGE, and apparently were fighting or mating because they were riding around in circles.  But, no fishes.  We left at 7:30 and caught some bad traffic going home.  It took us about 4 hours to get home due to a serious collision involving 6 vehicles; one being an Altima just like mine.  Man, I got nervous because just like my 2 accidents, which I'm glad to say were none of my fault, the altimas get hurt bad.  Funny! Capturing moments of my tragic frieking accidents, I remember my first one that the old lady took the red light and struck me from my right passenger and her brand new fold explorer was perfectly fine.  No dents! I think I should buy an S.U.V in the future.  But since I guess her husband told her over the phone to become a drama queen, she pretended to have pains on her knees.  But, unfortunetly, the b*tch got the ticket.  And this one of May 20, the stupid 19 year old, driving w/o a license (wtf are these kids doing in the street?) whom's friend looked just like Sonic The Hedgehog, decided to think his 20-second piece of crap Honda Civic, can make the left turn before I get there, and threw himself in front of me. I mean, Insurance adjusters, at the least the one covering for him, mind you, we both have Statefarm.  Until she received my accident report, like 2 weeks later, she wanted to declare me 40% liable.  I'm like 'B*tch!"...well, I didn't call her by that particular name that described her character but I did tell her that wtf did she want me to do other than stop because, you know, it's kind of what comes to mind when someone does something like this.  She told me I could've swerved to the left to avoid the accident.  I'm like WHAT??? Riggggghhttt!! If I would've swerved to the left, I would've hit the incoming cars, therefor, causing myself to be at fault (For Real!) and having them file a suit against me and Sonic and his other hedgehog left elsewhere.  Yeah right b*tch.  Ugh!  I get upset just thinking about it.  So we have to go under my policy, using my adjuster, which at least put the stupid kid 85% instead of 60.  I think it's still crazy because of someone is making a left turn, they need to be careful with you, not the other way around.   Damn, this sounds more like a post about opening up and bitching than the wonderful weekend. HAHAHA!  Well, somehow, I think that my posts' letters look incredibly big so time to change my settings.    Until tomorrow?  Later? whatever.

      I fell in love with my husband from the second I saw him; literally. My husband was the hardest person to have "fished". I remember, July 7, 2002, coming back from a good yet horrible 4th of July with a stupid ex.  I remember in PRC where we had to sit like in rows like we were students.  Like a week or 2 before we changed seats my cousin and I were looking at our seating arrangements and it said my husband's name next to me. And my cousin told me it's one of her husband's friends, I'm like, "Great!", a gangsta sitting next to me! Wonderful! And then, I came in that MOnday to find the finest guy with these BIG, green eyes sitting next to me. I was like WoW! And he dresses good too. I always like a man that knows how to dress.  He dresses with quality clothes; brandname.  I love Tommy, Nautica, Polo, etc. My husband has all these and more.    He had this fat, pretty, but fat girlfriend at the time. Man did I envy her.  Simply cause she had him.  But oh well.  I also had someone too, I always did say why do I want this guy so much when I am involved with someone.  WHy am I thinking like this? I'm not like this.    Well whatever, he broke up with the slut, I broke up with the pathetic loser and we started going out as friends on Valentines last year.  Finally we started as a couple in May and got engaged in August.  We moved in and got married right away.  There have been very, and I mean, very difficult times between us.  But I have learned, that when there's love, I mean real love, you work it out.  And it really does start getting better. I have talked and overheard women conversating about their relationships and it's like we all go through the same situations.  Like for example, the other day I'm walking in on a couple of girls that work here and one of them was talking about an issue about her husband, she's been married for a few years, she has a couple of kids, and she was talking to the other girl about brief problems between her and him and they were like "yeah, well, patience." I just started laughing inside because that really means that EVERYONE goes through these things, and those without the patience, are the ones that give up and end the relationship or cheat on their spouse.  Hell no. I'm going to be one of those people that lasted with their spouse till   DEATH DO US PART!  I'm going to be an old woman having been with my husband for like hopefully if we last like 50 years.  Unless, god forbid, something happens to either one of us, I'm going to be with my husband the best that I can be for the longest.   We do everyhing, together. The only one thing that we don't do together is take a shower together simply cause I like to hog up all the hot water.  But I read you bond a lot too with your spouse when you take time and take a shower together.  It's very sexual and as well loving.  It's different in lovemaking as well.  I feel I'm completely giving myself to the right person being that I'm his wife, not no little girlfriend, and we belong together. We have the same last name, share OUR home, and we're doing everything right as god wanted. It just feels right. And man, I love him so much. We share so much in common. I love my husband and I hope we get to share one more loving thing, other than our spoiled bunny; beautiful kids.

      A Matter Of Language "The basic tool for the manipulation of reality is the manipulation of words. If you can control the meaning of words, you can control the people who must use the words." - Philip Dick  Yesterday, a friend said to me, "I don't know why I feel so sad - after all, my doctor said it was just a chemical pregnancy."  Whoa. Hold on a second. You know what a "chemical pregnancy" is? It's a miscarriage. It's just a stupid term for "a miscarriage you're not supposed to feel bad about." Doctors use that expression to minimize your loss, to diminish your grief, to imply that, oh, cripes, don't start crying now - come on, the pregnancy wasn't even real, it just consisted of, you know, chemicals.  The next time some officious white coat tells you that it was "just" a chemical pregnancy, I want you to look him right in the eye and ask: and what, pray tell, was making all those chemicals? Exactly. An embryo. So shut the hell up, white coat. Do they make you wear a white coat because you're a lily-livered coward when it comes to witnessing your patients' grief?  You want to know what a true "chemical pregnancy" is, in the way that the white coats use the term? It's a shot of hCG in the ass. No egg has been fertilized, no embryo has been created, there's no chance of a baby nine months down the line. Nope, it's just a chemical - a real, honest-to-goodness chemical - floating around in your blood. But when an embryo is lost, that's a miscarriage. Not a "chemical pregnancy." A miscarriage.  I'm not making that up, by the way. INCIID states that a "chemical pregnancy" is an "early miscarriage." The website emedicine agrees, classifying "chemical pregnancy" as a type of early pregnancy loss. A brief web search will reveal that the scientific term "chemical pregnancy" refers to a pregnancy that is real, that has been documented by blood or urine tests, but that has miscarried prior to the gestational sac becoming visible upon transvaginal ultrasound, which typically occurs around five to six weeks (at that point, the pregnancy is termed a "clinical pregnancy"). So the adjective "chemical" simply refers to a period of gestational time. That's all. It does not lessen the pregnancy's genuineness. It does not mean that you had some sort of extra-small teeny-weeny mini-me miscarriage that they need a new word for because it wasn't really a miscarriage. The adjective simply refers to their ability to see the pregnancy on ultrasound - not it's actual presence in your body. Can you see how messed up it is that they quantify the degree of grief you're supposed to feel based upon whether or not they can see the pregnancy, instead of whether or not you can feel it, sense your body changing in response to it? Since when is reality defined by what the white coats can see?  So don't you ever let any emotion-phobic doctor insinuate that you shouldn't be upset because it was "only a chemical pregnancy." Don't you ever let some white coat make you feel ashamed of your grief. Don't you ever let the idiosyncrasies of someone else's word choice dictate your emotional responses. Your grief is real, and reasonable, and normal. It's their language that's the problem. Not your grief - their language.   And you'll be the one to decide how you feel about your miscarriage. Not them, and not the ultrasound monitor. You.   Because it would have been your child.  Great writting.  Will share with hubby.

      I thought it would never arrive.  Last night, I went to Homestead with Redny to get my calorad.  I finally started it!  Eating dinner at around 6:30-7 and having an empty stomache until like 11 is not easy.  But hey,it will work.  And I should be getting back to my exercises soon too. Yupee! I feel good. I woke up this morning feeling good. Kissed my bunny goodbye, went to buy me my cafe con leche, and here I am.  Tomorrow I have to do major cleaning to the house.  Probably will hit the gym for a little bit until REdny gets out of work, and then maybe go to the beach for a little bit; unless the suegros are doing something.  I've been thinking of baking a rum cake or something for when we go to the beach or something on the weekends with the family.  We're really thinking about buying a jet ski. After all, we're always at the beach and we love to rent them. Frieking-A, people are going crazy with prices.  We decided to rent them for half an hour only because it was already $45 + tax.  We're thinking about buying a small boat or a jet ski. I'm undecided because I like the jet ski for when we want to speed in water, and we also love boats for when we decide to go fishing in a group, or even just us alone.  Basically, I want an object that can float on water big enough for me and my husband.    Working in a real estate company, I see from time to time is hard to look at houses and say, shit, at this moment, I can't afford one. I wish I could've kept the other one. I wish my mom wouldn't have made the stupid mistake she did by leaving to Germany. I sold my house! I sold my house that I burried my little dog of 15 years in. I miss her so much. I think back sometimes and ask myself if I did the right thing by putting her to sleep. If maybe I could've spent more money. She was worth it anytime. She was my princess. But then I think about all her sleepless nights, where she couldn't sleep because she was so bloated. And it's soothing to know at least she finally rested. Man, I miss my dog.  So back to my house subject, I can't wait to get one. Maybe in a year or so. Maybe when our lease ends in February next year. After all, my mom is planning for Brandy to have some puppies and I have to have one of my princess's puppies. Fo shizzle! Brandy is a beautiful dog. She's got beautiful colors. But damn, she can bark.   I have got to change my template; I look like I'm writing on a FedEx journal. LOL.  I totally did not want to wake up this morning. Redny kissed me goodbye, from there I was already twisting and turning and here I am. Fluffy got on the bed and let me know he was hungry. He gets on top of me and starts sniffing my face. I open one eye and its so funny cause he looks like a little rat so close to me. Then all I see is his little mouth and those big eyes. He then decides to walk all over me until I get up. He still does his usual; waits for me in front of the bathroom so I can finish peeing, and then follows me to the kitchen and watches me put his little food in his plate. Then he quickly follows me to his cage running in circles around my feet all excited that he is going to eat. That's my fluffy.  Well, I guess I'll back to my crappy writing later.

      Well, I go home in about 45 minutes. I frieking can't wait.  Redny wants to go for a walk in the Grove or something.  We really can't do much because we have to save up for the 4th of July weekend.  So this weekend will probably just be "chillen" . We'll probably just go to the beach and get more tanned than we already are.  We went to the keys in a mustang I rented 2 weeks ago and I put tanning oil all oveer me and laid back while he drove and just with the drive to the keys, I had the only tan.  I was dumb and didn't take sun block for my face so the next day I couldn't even touch my face or even move my nose!  Sigh, I can't wait to do my real estate course already.  I need to get my career started.  My life has been: Mon-Fri: Wake up, take a shower, brush my teeth, go to work 9-6, go home, cook if Redny doesn't, clean up a bit, take another shower, go to bed and that's 5 days a week. Then Sat and Sun it's relax.  I can't imagine with kids. Oh kids, I love them.  Right now, Fluffy is my kid, and 300 miles away I have my princess with my mom.  Fluffy has to be neutered.  He got horny with our arms last night.  LOL. It was so funny. Redny got mad and slept the rest of the morning in the sofa because he got so upset. Talk about doing "it like rabbits".  They're quick.    I want to start kids soon. When I found out I was pregnant, I was so, but so happy.  It's like, I couldn't believe it. I actually got pregnant and I didn't even try.  Sometimes I blame my miscarriage on my working out so hard within that time.  I think I was doing really heavy sit-ups and I was going up and down those stairs very fast.  But then, since it was considered a "chemical pregnancy", I kind of, on the other hand, don't think it was due to that.  But that gave me a motivation to start soon again. Redny is doing really good in the bank, plans to stay in that field. Who knew my husband was going to go into banking?  I will never throw away my positive pregnancy test .  It is 1) a reminder that I have good eggs (LOL) 2)that I am fertile and shouldn't worry, at least for now,3)a sign to ME indicating to starting thinking of MY own kids.   This is the cutest picture of me and my little cousin Gabriela:  Ok so damn, can't copy and paste here and I sure hell ain't downloading anything on my work computer.  Fo shizzle!  Well, I will end my day here with my journal, let's see if I keep this one up, I never do.  5:31-yay, 29 more minutes to go!

      Is usually boring, nevertheless worthless until I can think about something to write in it about.  I guess I can write crap.  Yeah, why don't I just title my diary "crap".  After all, unless I'm pissed off, mostly bored, or work is slow, that's pretty much the information that I will write in here.  So what "crap" should I start writing about? Hmmm...I guess since I drank too much water, and I need to hurry my ass to the bathroom, my brain can't think right now, so I'll be right back to start the crap writing...

      Abuela,  I miss you so much. Abuela if you only knew how much you are missed and how much we love you. I have been telling everyone you are the root of this family.  YOu created us all. You lived your years and I look forward to seeing you again.  The last few times I saw you, you barely remembered me.  You lived to be 94 years old.    You were mom of 6, one passed away. Grandmother of 13, and great grandchildren, so many of us I can't even remember. As I heard the news, I couldn't believe it. You were the best to us.  I remember when I used to come home from school from Ruben Dario and everyday you asked me if I wanted rice with fried eggs and platanito.  And then the ice cream man would come and you'd seek all your change to buy me my chocolate eclair.Oh how I loved to watch Cristina with you while you made fun at the people from her show. Ay abuelita, how I miss you.  As I saw you lay in that coffin, I repeatedly asked myself if I was dreaming, or if that was really you.  Maybe it's someone else, I asked myself and they mistook that person for you.  You couldn't have gone, you're a guajira, you will last forever. But it was you.  Those were the hands that I was massaging in Baptist hospital when you told me they were numb. And at the same time were those that cracked the eggs that I would see you make for me when you used to take care of me. That was the same smile I had been seeing for so many years. And your blue dress.  YOur favorite blue dress that you wore to Michelle and Jennifer's weddings, and to all the important getogethers.  Ay abuela, I miss you.  I just can't get over it. I can't get it through my head that I won't be able to see you until only god knows when.  But now I know you're ok. God took you in the middle of a prayer.  As you spoke with him, you took your last breathe. I bet you didn't know that you were not going to see us anymore.  I wish I can ask you, how did you know?  How did you know it was your last day?  How were you able to tell that lady that it was your last day on earth?  And why were you afraid? You knew how close of a relationship you have with God.   Abuela, I want you to know that at least I can visit you at your grave.  Until the day I see you, that's the closest I can be to your body. It hurts I can touch you.  That I can no longer massage your hands when you tell me they hurt. It hurts that I can not longer see your smile, that I can no longer hear your praises to Jehova and that you can no longer spend the time with me that you used to when I was small.  Abuela, I'm glad I spent all the time I did with you.  I'm happy to know that I feel special for all the times that you were able to take care of me when I was a little girl.  We are all special to you in a way but I'm glad I will always be one of your great-grandaughters.  I will close my letter to you now as I can not fight the tears from my eyes as I sit here at work. I love you abuela.
