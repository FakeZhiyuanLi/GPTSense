      Hiya ... i'll post my 'likely' subject choices 4 next yr.... ahhhhhh lil johnny's growin up soooooooooo fast.  yr 11:  3 Maths  2 Economics  2 Physics  2 Chemistry or Business (chem prolly)  2 English + 1 ext english (or Jap) ..... english sux... boring as but jap used 2 b worse. i wasn't gonna do it but den im  a lot  better at eng den jap (my rank in eng(grade) was same as jap(class) =8. no fob 4 me ^-^) but i h8 it how teachers go on about all dis meaningful crap dats supposedly tryin 2 b told by the author. n then while harry was torkin 2 teacher bout 3 Unit next yr she's like "you're gonna do ext eng next yr rite..... Jonathan" n them im like damnnnnn. "yeah errr... welllll ummmm.... most prolly". Dang those piercing eyes cut me deep, sweat poured down my back, i felt my face slowly changin hue I just couldn't say no.... ahhh the pressure. so i guess now im stuck wif 3 U, if i'd said no... english marks = DOWN. O wellz i can drop it in yr 12 n pik up 4 U maths (no im not a nerd, im simply azn). and js rndmly "friends...NOT boy/girl-friend" oooooo andy's got a bf..... keke *cough*  andy unsure of his sexual preference  *cough*.. ahhh we knew it all along. and yes andy i kno wat u mean but it still sounds funny. :P

      WARNING: author is pissed and will ramble and rant. ok. im pissed. mum chucked a psycho when she found out about me organising fundraising for our formal -.-;; that just sux. she demanded that i withdraw from organising it altogether, and im only allowed to sell 2 boxes now. far out. but that was sortta ok. and then she went on about how i go online too much and how i don't tell her when I go online ie. sneaking on without telling her. she said that she had had enough and the punishment would be that i won't allowed to go to the formal! aRgH! i'm sorry shues >. RANT #1 ||| wtf cant parents (esp mine) lay off a bit? they have to follow you around and keep track of what you do, when where and why. what they don't understand is the fact that maybe if they lay off a bit, it would work out fine, maybe even better! take for example, reports. if they would let you do anything, ie. go online whenever, sleep whenever, watch TV whenever, go out whenever, etc. whose to say that one's report won't remain at a high standard. ok, maybe i exaggerated it a bit - obviously parents have to impose SOME restrictions. but can't they loosen up a bit and stop being so uptight? they aren't even willing to try and let us go wild. cant they try it once and see just how effective it is to let us have more freedom? and it's not like my results were that crap *ignores all the techs at school*. far out. its not like i have to top the class in every subject!! so why cnt parents just loosen up a bit and let us be? RANT #2 ||| why do parents, azn ones in particular have such a big problem with us mingling with the opposite sex? don't they understand, as shues pointed out, that we cannot get outta uni and find a wife/husband settle down and have kids in a flash? we need time to gradually get to that goal -- and that time is usually high school. we need to have the opportunity to communicate and understand the opposite sex. understand them as FRIENDS will be sufficient. but even talking to them as FRIENDS cannot happen because one's parents don't trust you, they don't want to risk the 0.000001% (as zbaras said, 98% of statistics are false ^__^) chance of you: a) for a guy to impregnate a girlfriend or b) for a girl to get impregnated by a guy far out! and they say WE watch too much TV...obviously they watch too much of those stupid today tonight reporters interviewing that small percentage (in comparison to the rest of em) of pregnant teens and their bfs. and also the fact that due to our absolutely obsessive love for our partners that we will fail academically. because of these factor, they believe that we should avoid the opposite sex until we get into uni -___-'' ok. let's just say (sounds like an 'even if' debate) that there is a remote chance of this happening. but even so, is it bad enough that they have to stop us from being FRIENDS with the opposite sex? KEY WORD: friends...NOT boy/girl-friend. if anyone can answer this question, please do. i'm eager to find out the answer. RANT #3 ||| this really isn't that big of a rant but i think it concerns a large majority of us. in regards to the formal, DO NOT stress. it is FOUR WHOLE months away! well i suppose for the girls...they're dresses will take forever to find so you should have started. besides that, you can all wait for a while longer to find bloody dates. calm down pplz! don’t fight over ppl either. LMAO -.-" so anyway, if you skimmed through that and didn't get the most important thing about this blog, then here it is again: I AM NOT ALLOWED TO GO TO THE FORMAL NOW *damn* SO LADIES, NO NEED TO RUSH TO ASK ME AS YOUR DATE ^__^ keke. ok, maybe the last bit wasn't necessary. hehe  anyone else not going to the formal? i would like to know, maybe we can organise something ^__^  until next time --- bye!

      I personally think that 12 for Prelim n 10 for HSC is not enuf.. cos it's just too narrow n risky...  ... IF Software Design goes well THEN     do 12 units for prelim     do 10 units for HSC ELSE     do 14 units for prelim     do 12 units for HSC ENDIF ...  ... get it?  Anyways... i'll probably do:  2 english (Fobbish me) 4 maths (though i'm not dat gud... = 45th) 2 commerce subject 2 musik 2 physics (2 not decided yet...)  = 14...

      Well me and my dad had a talk yesterday about subject selections for next year, and I was just interested in what everyone else was planning to do as well. So yeah, if you could post it up if you're a member, or leave it in the comments section that would be great. (Something serious on this blog for once... haha). Well anyway, at the moment I'm hoping to do:                    3 English                       2 Economics                   3 Maths                         2 Legal Studies                   2 Ancient History  Hmm... that's providing that I get a better rank for Maths in second semester. Now that doesn't sound too promising does it?

      Once again, it is only I who on this group blog that actually uses proper English, and spelling. I can safely say that all those below and above me will most probably be using horrible truncations and acronyms that should safely stay within the boundaries of a chat program window, and never more. I do not care how absolutely cool it may be in writing in inane and mindless gibbers, as that would really show how education is being wasted. Also the only way I could become cool would be by living inside a fridge for three months.  If one observed the frequencies of my posts on this blog, then one would be able to find out that this is only the second post so far. It is mainly because of my general style of blogging that I believe would make it stand out too much from the average blogger crowd. That is why I mainly post in my own blog, which is untainted by grammatical mutilations and second-rate spelling.  So, if anybody wants to see some real fevered ranting using correct English and suchlike, then www.wellerzheng.blogspot.com is where most of it can be found.    This post was not shameless self-promotion disguised in any form. Nor does it contain any blatant subliminal messages, although you may get an urge to join the Navy. Only sick twisted conspiracy artists, such as those claiming that table tennis is not a sport and NSB is lesser than James Ruse, would spread such profane rumours. golb ym daer golb ym daer golb ym daer golb ym daer golb ym daer golb ym daer golb ym daer golb ym daer golb ym daer.

      Sport is da shining light in an othawise crappy week of skool. But dat light often gets dimmed by constant losing...  3rd Grade Soccer - Lost 2-1 to Epping 3rds Solo goal to Alex. Fairly decent performance  2nd Table Tennis - Lost to Epping 2nds Supposedly murdered. (Thnx Benlee)  15s Hockey - Lost 7-1 to Epping 15's THRASHED, OBLITERATED, etc.  So as one can see, our skool is quite crap at sport. I think da word "victory" got ripped out wen dey were handing free, yes dats da only ones we can afford, dictionaries to da skool.  N yes, we get our reports 2moro...WATCH THIS SPACE!!!

      yes...we won debating against chatswood high!!! not by much unfortunately...but all the same we won. technically...the debate was pathetic --- both teams defined the topic as totally different things --- they defined it too truistically though ^___^ the topic was about 'that jobs are more important than future trees". we thought it was a metaphorical debate...stupidly ignoring the environment factor in our case altogether...i spoke for like less than 3 minutes. we defined it as jobs in today's society having higher priority over family, social life and social issues (lack of environment?!?!?). they defined it truistically as developing for the future -___-'' you got to admit...it was a realli crappy debate. but now we're in the next round! yay! HAPPY BDAY JAMES! yes...a bit random. almerick...stop being a retard --- damn spamming our tagboard using alias...this applies to wannabe spammers and also james in and benlee yap *glares* and mabel...i shall 'DUH' you for the rest of eternity ^__^ keke. i modified my layout for those critical morons...ie JACK. i changed the navigation panel and also added a 'home' link as suggested by jono and jack.

      Well sure enough, I'm back, and what a bludgy week it's been. First there was the public holiday on Monday, where the Queen played no part in anybody's day off and I decided to dog Andy and buy wood (???). Then that assembly on Tuesday, where I ranted about RICE... come to think of which... COME TO RICE!!  Weekend, weekend. It's been a good one. Challenged to take God's word more seriously and spent more time reading the Bible and AWAY from the computer!!   And Andy, look seriously, your new layout's good. I mean you should see me trying to design a web page.. even Junwoo could laugh at me!! Trying to learn Photoshop myself at the moment. Oh, and check out the footer at the bottom of the page. (me!)  Hmm.. and yes. Ask me for my new email address. Don't want to put it up here just in case evil spammers are lurking on introspective...*darts eyes*  Anyway, I am sleeping too late and it's time I got some rest. So yeah maybe I'll blog during our science lesson tomorrow in class. Until then, later.

      We had da most hilarious day in chinese skool. Firstly, while we sat in our class, pretending to learn, a head teacher came along n said we were going to get kicked out by little yr 1s. And wen we moved into da hallways, where a makeshift table was used...Den i got pissed. It was fuckn cold n dim, making it a great classroom :) Afta 30 mins of pain, we eventually got to move....to a room where there was only 3 ppl. (Rove: DUUUUUHHHHHH!!!!) It took dem a goddam half n hour to find a room....where dere was only 3 ppl...Dats wen i really got pissed.   But dat was da end of da shit I had to take. During break, we dogged da teacher, went to CFN, played CS, with my team getting canned cos none of dem could get at least a 1:1 ratio (of course i could :P) n went bak with 20 mins of class to go.   Da teacher didnt even care....which was da sweet part. Den agen, were pretty "trustworthy". HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA...  Did neone see Zlatan Imbrahimozvic's goal agenst Italy??? ABSOLUTE PURE MAGIC b CHEEKINESS TO DA MAX...  GO DA EAGLES...KILL DA BUNNIES 2day.

       	Our school needs money and a lot of it. Sure, you may be casually strolling past NSB one day and notice all the construction work going on in the front and think “wow this school can afford to build a new carpark, turfed area and new tennis courts” but think about this, it took our school something like 5 years to get the permit and federal funding for that. Most of that funding came from our parents anyway leading me to think that maybe the school has just been saving all the building fund donations from parents for the past 20 years in the eventuality that despite all the governments promises, there is no way in hell that they are going to give our school money.  	In the newspapers are few months ago, we all read that NSG had a million dollars in their trust fund, which made us NSB’s realize how much better our education could possibly be if we were taught at NSG. This notion was stopped when we got to the third letter of NSG, which we understood to mean girls. Obviously this created a problem. Fortunately for us boys (and NSG’s who read this), the mind of an adolescent male supposedly thinks about sex every eight seconds, so eight seconds later we promptly forgot about that topic and found something else to think about for the next eight seconds before we got distracted again.  Recently a friend from NSG asked a group of us whether our school actually followed a curriculum. Do people think that our school’s poverty is really that bad? The answer to that would be yes (the curriculum question, not the poverty one), but one can never be too sure. This question was asked following a brief exchange of what we have learnt in school so far and a comparison of textbooks. I have noted that in the subject of Latin we have the same textbooks, but they are ahead of us in learning and their textbook pages a white and shiny while ours a stained, tattered and yellow. They have one textbook for all the math classes while we have like five different textbooks for each of the five math classes. “Can’t afford a 150 book set” is what I thought I heard. I put that in, in the vain hope that a highly recognized public school education official with connections to the government will read this and increase our school funding or drastically cut funding to the girl’s school.  In the same session I also learnt that the level of information the girl’s are learning is much higher than what we are learning. This matter was put to rest when a friend said “Their teachers get paid”, which is a fair enough comment when you think about it.  I’m pretty sure that’s why NSG always beats our school in HSC rankings (the fact that boys are lazy bludgers, who wouldn’t do work if our lives depended on it had absolutely nothing to do with the rankings). It makes sense, paid teachers are happy teachers and it’s quite obvious that our teachers aren’t happy. For instance, today one of the geography classes had a substitute teacher. As I was leaving the school for sport, I saw the real teacher drive into the school and park his car. This prompted me to wonder whether our school is really bad enough to cause the teachers to jig. Of course the teacher in question could have been in an important meeting outside of school, but for the sake of the argument I’m going to assume that he wasn’t. So in the hope that someone important will read this I offer this ultimatum. Give us money or give us some of NSG’s money. It’s quite obvious that they don’t need it, girls are supposed to be resilient and I’m sure they’ll find a way to get more somehow. Failure to do so could result in hostile action. I mean we’ve already turned the school into a terrorist training camp with “Storm the Castle” and pretty soon you’ll have a bunch of semi-intelligent terrorists running around. Now you wouldn’t want that would you?

Yeah it was funnish but no offence prefects but organisation sucked. ppl cheated (i was innocent of course, until i stumbled onto a stash of weapons^-^). Dere were all dese rndm cadets in our skool, quite funny really just walking past wen they're all srs n stuff, wif dere funny hats (no offence wayne, ben and co). I got wasted so i gave up and just got absolutely soaked, n it was freezin, shuda thought b4 goin wif singlet n shorts from socca trainin, but i couldn't go home :( neway our group sucked and bloody curry group wif nearly double as many ppl won. Socca 2day guess wat? they forfeit again, u kno in da 6 wks dat i've joined 3rds socca we're undefeated,not to mention the um 3 forfeits, strike, bye etc dat we had hehe. and b4 dat dey lost every game.

       Harry Potter #3  was not as good as i thought it would and should be. not that i will spoil it for everyone but it was weird. it ended a bit early i thought, as most movies do and the "lets get harry, ron and hermione together" was a bit awkward. there were both funny and freeky bits in it so overall it was maybe a 3-4/5. saw it with james, zebs, yap, almo and his lil cusin steph. stupid 12 o'clok session sold out so i couldn't take my lil cousin --- o well. we went to timezone and shared 12 games between us for 5 bucks ^___^ played daytona 2 --- automatic car...winning the race...ends up coming last >.< *sigh* time crisis 3 was good and air hockey against yap was...err...not very long lasting. lolz. oh and also played this random hammering game...hehe *FUN* missed out on DDR wid almerick...too many ppl playin. overall it was a fairly eventful day --- not as i hoped but when half your friends have something on...it was pretty fun. *glances at adro and co.* hehe. ciao///

      Haven't blogged in a while (4 days by my count) and i am so very bored. Nothing to do at all. Sorry Andy for doggin you. I've been stuck at home all day playing around with HTML instead of catching up on homework which i should be doing. Stupid Bennet (I've noticed i bitch about him a lot) has finally set us a date to hand in the willmill assignment and it's this friday which is crap because that means i'm actually going to have to do some work in DT *sigh* School this week will be a bludge. Storm the Castle tomorrow. Don't know why everyone's bagging it. Put it this way, the less people turn up the more TV's, MP3's (in desperate need of one since i accidentally smashed the remote of my old one) and Hi Fi systems (broke that one trying to fix the cd drive) for me. So very bored.

      Greetings to the whole world in general, excluding any members of American congress, P.E teachers and 143 bus drivers, in which case may they be thrown back from whence the slimy pit they crawled from.  I, Weller Zheng have joined this group blog, the poor buggers. They must really be the fools they are, for they have summoned their downfall as a respectable blog.  For you see, contarary to the disclaimer that this blog has, I probably do not have much of a life out side of blogging, whether it be for this blog or my own. However I am not yet a complete and downright loser as I do not have any associations to Star Trek conventions, math teachers and Stephen Hawking.  I will not post too much egregarios loads of bullshit on this site. Instead such material can be found at my own blog at "www.wellerzheng.blogspot.com". I warn those that go that is a damned effcient waste of time and about as coherent as eating a pair of boots when agitated.  That is all. Yours, Weller.

      Hmm, its been a very boring week. Nothing much happening, in life or on this blog. Im not going to put my results here, because they're too bad to mention. My friends will know what im talking about. So I'm grounding myself to study.  RICE!! The food, the event! RICE 2004 is happening on the 10th July 2004 at Willoughby Town Hall and its going to be bigger and better than last year! A night packed with singing, skits, talk, testimonies, fun and socialising. A time to learn more and get to know God!   It starts at 7 p.m. on the second Saturday of the school holidays, next to Willoughby library. Visit the site  urlLink   for more info, ask me, Doug or Ben at school or talk to me on MSN.  I'll be back. See you soon

      hmm...wow, haven't blogged for a while. Went to dinner right after chem last night so didn't go on the internet. chem as usual was amusing. michael caristo is much better at teaching but as kiz pointed out, scary because he picks people to answer questions. the most amusing thing at chem this week was the prediction that zbaras would say "ill go if you pay for me" in the context of the  yr 10 formal . kiz asked him and he said exactly that...tsk tsk, zebs you cheaparse. *sigh* besides that, chem was a bore for we did not mention the word  wig . >. today has been extremely boring. woke up at 10 --- the  latest  in a long time. spent whole day doing my jap powerpoint when i figured out my completed copy was left at school yesterday --- i  forget  to take out my floppy disk! ARGH!! besides that...the usual boring stuff. my ankle is better now which is good. and we are still very much stumped for what to do on monday. cant go to adro's or stevie's house. jt's house=music day=NO! and so we are stumped. damn shrek isnt out till thursday. *sigh* AGAIN

I didn't want to slip and stuff like i did at the school's Athletics Carnival, so i took it slow and safe =) 400m, had to compete against scary, drugged running freaks ~RESULTS: FAILED! haha~ not gonna say much more than that, coz it's quite depressing.. =( oh well, not like im a serious runner/ jumper or anything ^^ The only thing i got out of today was the knowledge of how to use a starting block! oooh, sooo pro ^^V!  that's it about the zone [notice that i didnt mention my exact results] =p  seeyaz.. on Tuesday~!

      most of my test results have returned to me and surprisingly there not as bad as i thought. Maths was good and english was good (even though i bull shited two and a half pages). Geo was better than expected. I seriously thought that i was going to fail that one, but i tied with Ben which must be a good thing. My history result wasn't as good as expected so i guess i probably shouldn't have spent the last twenty minutes of the test sleeping. I know i have failed jap but it's not like jap is important (hope Yi Long is not reading this). Tried to decided what to do during Queen's b'day and haven't managed to organize anything yet. It was down to Adro's house, JT's house or a movie. Stupid Andy won't tell me what majong and Jason said something like "what do you mean you don't know what it means" (in shang of course). Came 27th in the grade for maths so i end this blog on a happy note. g'nite pplz

      Stupid english open book essay tomorrow. Fortunately it's last period so cram, cram, cram at lunch and during DT. Unfortunately, i know what the topic is which i reckon is worse than not knowing because now you have no reason to screw it up. And to follow that up, on Friday i have an english speech assessment task on mental illness. YAY!! Researching topic on social attitudes towards mental health. Managed to get a 113 page analysis of social attitudes in Britain. Teacher wants all written references so she can mark them. This is seriously going to screw my printing bill at school. Anyway today was a pretty average day. Nothing happened in school. More stuff happened outside of school. For example on the way to sport, i learnt about ilia's attitudes towards Russians, Jews, Cossacks, Czechens, Hindus, Asians, Americans and basically every other race on the planet. I won't write it here coz it might offend some people, but if you want to find out go talk to ilia about his list of hated people and what he plans to do to them. Also got dropped 5m during rockclimbing because Rajiv is retarded and can't belay for nuts. Muscles still aching in body but not as bad as before. At least now i can sneeze, laugh and cough without to much pain. Ben hasn't been to school in the last two days and that means there is something seriously wrong with him. Hopes he gets better soon! While reading the paper i learnt about the magic mathematical ratio of "phi". This ratio is 1:1.618. Why am i rambling about maths? Because those who possess this divine ratio are beautiful. Not just average good looking but like really good looking. [Orly must have it (glances at Fel)]. So how do you find out if you have "phi"? Go to www.beautyanalysis.com, download a phi mask and stick it over a picture of your self. I haven't done it yet so go do it and post a comment on this blog (don't have to mention whether your beautiful or not). Just to make all the ugly people (glances at andy) feel better, if you don't possess phi it doesn't mean your ugly, just average looking, which is ok, so don't stress. So go to the site, play around with it and leave a comment! Have fun pplz!

      ok...this is pathetic. blogging at  1:15  when i'm meant to be at sport. *sigh* i am currently at my  uncles office ...waiting for my mum to get back from the doctor --- bored and  ankle  is no longer hurting. but i still can't walk properly. hmm...i might not blog tonight but nothing interestings happened since the last time i  blogged . hmm...well i found out that the  mrmen  bloggers have demolished their site...panaust refuses to pay me $2 and yeah...stuffed up my geo test  real bad . ionno whether i said this in my previous blogs but lora and annie's  new layouts  are really good! they clash a bit though...lolz, portrays annie as angelic and good (white) and lora as evil and bad (black). hehe. so anyway...once again, congrats to shues, kiri and sammy...and i'm glad to know that both sides have apologised to each other over the group blog argument. haha. invited more people to join this group blog...and to JT --- blog more than half a line next time...and don't direct it at me. *sigh

      aiitez, as usual, didn't blog for monday because of stupid hill debating. its finally over! *sigh of relief* so anyway, to start off yesterday i shall begin with my total surprise at my speed on the race track --- i tied for first with eddie in the 16yrs 100m!! ok...sounded arrogant there but srsli.. i haven't sprinted like that since yr4. yipee! ok...now the bad news. someone convinced me to go into the 200m which i realli suck at cos i'm crap at endurance *once i remember who it was that convinced me, they shall die* and i came fourth in it. when i reached the finish line i stopped...took a breath and sprained my ankle for some reason cos my right leg gave way and twisted itself :/ WTH!!!?!?! FAR OUT! *sigh* so then i had to withdraw from the bloody finals and the relay and today i skipped three periods of school and had to go to a physiotherapist at 5:30 >. and that other guy in hinder. but i deserve sympathy too *glares at wayne* so yes...bad first part of monday. after we got back to school, waited for like one hour for debating coaching to start and found out that the crappy team *us* had been kicked outta the comp all together so i joined shuyan/kiri/sammy's team. i'd like to thank them for giving me the opportunity to be involved in their debating prep and also the fact that i got TOTALLY freeked out when sammy wasn't there which meant i had to replace her as first speaker. thnk you very much kiri and shues. LMAO. prep was extremely stressful -.-;; i don't think i've ever been happier at seeing sammy...she saved me from displaying my crappy debating skills in front of the two good teams...*relieved* so yeh...although we went in with no case and two palm cards, we...or rather, they won the debate against the yr 11 team. shues, kiri and sammy need a confidence boost...*looks to their friends for support* so yes...a happy end to monday ^__^ congrats you guyz!!   now for today. got to school at fourth period for english cos my mum wanted me to go to physiotherapist in the morning --- they were fully booked but missing out on commerce is always a good thing ^__^ the rest of the day was extremely tiring as i experienced just how big a struggle walking down stairs with a sprained ankle is. ARGH! physio guy was nice -- thought i didn't know how to speak canto...and he put suction pad thingos on my legs...*tingly* afterwards, found out david jones had a half-yr clearance, met almericks sister and bought a $99 winter coat...$400 discount!! ^__^ so now i am...supposedly doing my japanese work...hehe. gnite pplz! yes i noe this blog is long..but at least i didn't split it into three! *glares at wayne..AGAIN*

      I know this is my third blog today, but i need to get some stuff off people to help me with DT. If you're is in my DT class (you know who you are) could you please fax or give me a copy of the windmill task. Bennet is being tight and won't give me a sheet unless i show him some game site i was supposedly at (apparently he liked one of the games i was supposedly playing). So if you have a copy could you please send it to me or give it to me at school. thnx  To finish this off i'll recount my day 5th period onwards. During 6th period Stevie experienced what can only be described as "groin cramps". He was in considerable pain and because it was funny watching him rolling his head around on the table i started laughing as well. And because my muscles were completely wasted from the athletics carnival laughing caused me pain. Because i was in pain he started laughing at me and because his muscles were in the same condition it caused him even more pain. So both of us were rolling around in fits of muffled laughter and pain. FUN!! FUN!! FUN!! Later at Gordon station waiting for the bus James and Ben had the brilliant idea to play charades. Imagine 7 people playing charades at a bus stop. Repertoire included Scorpion King, Catch Me If You Can, Cats, Cool Runnings, Princess Diaries and an amusing Titanic (won't mention who did what though). Probably won't here from me in the next coupla days, but if you do then i'm probably not as busy as i thought was.  g'nite pplz

      Well as i said before i am now blogging during commerce. A list of things that have happened since my last blog - 1. Andy turned up  2. Andy got gum stuck to his shoe and said "This is not funny" as he tried to remove it by scraping it on the ground.  As you can see nothing much has happened (coz u kno andy counts for nothing) and i'm just doing this because i'm supposed to be finding out about the Greens and i can't be bothered to do so.   Also just to piss off Rajiv who is sitting next to me at the moment: Rajiv is a stupid, good-for-nothing, ugly, layabout who sucks at everything he does. If you have something to add to this or agree with this please post a comment.

      Waking up after an athletics carnival is a complete BIATCH! Every single muscle in your body is aching and walking becomes the worst thing in the world. You can't laugh or sneeze and to top it off, you have go to school. (Glares at Ben and Andy). Ok Ben i can understand, he realli pushed himself beyond the limits on the 800 and he didn't look to good afterwards, but Andy just because you were clumsy enough to stumble and screw up your ankle after the 200 doesn't give you the excuse not to turn up to school the next day. Everybody who ran and turned up today was completely wasted i.e Stevie, Almo, me etc. I'm writing this during DT (probably why i was banned last time by evil lost DT teacher). Speaking of DT teacher, he won't get off my back for some site he claims i went to during the last DT lesson, which is impossible because i was stuck in B8 all lesson. Anyway, I'm writing this during DT because i have nothing else to do. I might blog during commerce if anything happens between now and 5th period.

      hello all. well...sunday is never a favoured day for me. chinese school is so boring and pathetic. when i come to think of it, even my  cskool teacher  is a bit like kowalski -.- *gasps* well anyway, cskool, was really borin as usual. we had to redo our essay because we had all done really badly in our previous attemps --- apparently. the topic was like 'how to make friends'...and yes i do have friends but since when is there a method to making friends except  bribery ? lolz. besides that, all i did was look over my latin and listen to random songs on darren's ipod.  namie amuro  is pretty good. lee hom actually has some alright songs. and edison is clearly the worst singer i have heard. but some of his songs/raps are really funny. after cskool, went back home and started to study again. i am srsli not liking this latin stuff. *sigh* i also found out that the year 11's also have a group blog --- well almost a 'group' considering half their group is missing. and the blog itself is pretty weird too. trust  brownie  to come up with ' mrmen ' as the title. LMAO. when you go to the site you can see the lil miss *** and lil mr *** people all over the place. -___-;; i've also signed up for a photo hosting thingo so we'll have photos galore on this site in the very near future. i was trying to do my  hyperbola  homework too...failing miserably...the hyperbola's are so hard to draw! *yes i am unskilled aDr0~* far out...now i am trying to do my english feature article and find a topic to do for my japanese research.  sugimoto  restricted to being within tokyo which is really annoying since there is nothing, that i can find, which operates in tokyo and is interesting. so yeah...what should the shortened url of this blog be? hmm...now i should go to sleep ---  athletics carnival  tomorrow...need my rest to beat lanky ^__^ goodluck to  ipt people ...you should all quit. and as a last word, if you plan on choosing latin as a subject...be warned, there are serious  repercussions  >.<

      Greetings all. And first of all thanks for visiting our site.  Readers of this blog must understand that we all have lives outside of this blog, so do no expect everone to post everyday. As long as everyone posts occasionally, there should always be something new to see. (The benefits of a group blog...:P)  So just a word of thanks to:  Contributors: Without you guys none of this would have happened. Blog on!  Andy: For co-ordinating and the beautiful banner at the top! :P.   Readers of Introspective: Thanks for coming! Keep telling your friends about it, keep tagging and commenting!!!  I will try to register a shorter URL soon for the sake of our visitors.  Sorry about the formality of this post, but it had to be said. (Where would a blog be without an annoying disclaimer??)  Thanks again and I'll see you all soon!

      Indek over. Gondek start. Crap. Oh well at least all half yearlies are over. Friday was crap. Wasted my first two periods and failed genetics test. First period was supposed to be spent studying mental illness. The library has only two books on mental illness and both of them were missing. Wasted first period. Then in second period stupid Bennet (DT teacher) wouldn't let me in the computer room for "research" because i was on msn groups last DT lesson. Stupid Jason was sitting next to me the previous lesson doing the exact same thing and he got to go in. Again stupid Bennet. Spent the whole period in B8 doing shat all. Wasted second period. Stupid genetics test. Opened the paper to short answer and the question was "define the following terms- gene". WAP! Dammit, what the hell is a GENE. James Kim showed me a cool site. www.tekzoned.com Go there and do all the fun things on the site. So failed that one.

      well then...a recap on YESTERDAYS events. pathetic really. had our  organic chemistry  test fifth period so me and adro decided to skip lunch to study. pointless in my opinion. i failed the test all the same. since when did we learn the structure of PVC?!? and then i was really hungry for 6th period *sigh* after school we waited till 4 for chem to start.  highly amusing. stevie got  upper-cutted  by almerick and lawrence took a photo with his camera phone of stevie rolling around on the grass half moaning and half laughing. LMAO. then phoebe and kiz came over and we discussed jason's  wig  ^__^ being pretty much the same with or without gel. haha.  rajiv decided to crack open some nut thingo which contained two seeds...big ones mind you. no sexual connotations there of course. chem, like last wk was laughable. amongst 'wig' discussions, kiz decided to check out the guyz in the class, we ate phoebe's crackers, looked up  wig  in my english-jap dictionary ---  katsura , and attempted to understand what shyam was teaching us.  oh...and i saw tim wong yesterday too ^__^ he looks like a gangster HAHA --- apparently a  nice  one? today, won't even bother talking about. went to library and that's it. going to jap restaurant tonight. so yeh.  studying  latin atm.

      well then. how does this template look? yes i know, i should make a lyout for it and recode it but its actaully really complicated. you need to know XML! so until then, this will be the way our group blog looks. i'm really tired so i won't write much. i'll try to get a tagboard up if i can. all of the gang have been notified by email to join the blog. if i've forgotten anyone, drop me a line ^__^ i'll customise the site more tomorrow. the url is random --- just typed it after i saw ben's book that he lent me. it can and will be changed in the near future. anyone got suggestions for what the url so be? it can remain as 'introspective' or be changed to something else. ideas please! anyway, i am going to go now...i'll fix this up tomorrow...promise. meanwhile, whoever reaches this site before me should start blogging ^__^ you can give friends the url if you want but be prepared to tell them that it has changed in the near future. g'nite pplz!!

      Dammit SIAC really really sux. They didn't have any hot water so i had to come home for a shower, evil evil evil. I blame this on the government, they should put more money into the olympic park venues, yeah i kno they're pretty much redundant but i don't care. They should at least keep hot showers going for people who go there regularly like me. I'm stressing over the amount of homeword, assessment task and test that i have managed to rack up over the past 2 weeks. Somehow, by no fault of my own,  i find myself trying to complete them all this weekend as they're due next week.

       been busy these last couple of days preparing for debate. went to   macquarie cu  p   yesterday and spent the  whole day  debating, eating and debating. LoLz. i've posted results up on my website but yeah. as everyone should have guessed our team NSB B lost. surprisingly, it wasn't by much. we should have won the first round if it wasn't because of the adjudicator, we won the second and only just lost the third round to scots (it was my fault because i hadn't gotten used to the 1st speaker yet, and i hated the topic). We weren't really provided enough food...but yeah. I met di yu - haven't seen her in ages. she goes to PLC now. and they got into the finals! they were versing scots college b and lost. i do not agree with the result, because clearly they had a much better case and better speakers. dude... scots ppl talk so slowly  and still get really short times! >.   australs   --- i learnt a lot though. mac uni are like uts try hards LoLz, they had a fatter version of felicity, they got katie from uts to adjudicate. haha...but they lacked the technology of UTS ^___^    i was  really tired  afterwards, i had  woken up at 5  in the morning to prepare for the days debates and i went to sleep at 9:30. woke up at like 10 this morning LMAO   and ppl kept ringing me during debates *glares at jeff, mabel and tash* so yes...i have nothing more to say. my nickname tells all.

         hmm... the following blog after this first section does not relate to the title. LoLz. i'd just like to mention that in some cases, you make a mistake and it turns your life upside-down and there's no turning back. that is all. on a more  normal  note. subject selections handed in. had to get to school at 8 this morning for macquarie cup meeting. turns out that we are going to the same place on friday as we did last week for jap. meeting was interesting, podmore can actually express herself to a point where she is easily understood unlike that guy who was supposedly coaching us for hill debating. it sucks how podmore changed the debating teams though - now jack, bibhu and weller are split up. jack isn't in a team anymore and has to chair, bibhu is with edward davison and michael koziol and weller is with year 9's! (i think it may have changed during the day) first period was * no talking * maths. i'm actually doing work in maths now thnx to someone ^___^ but seriously, indices is getting annoying. when are we doing logs?! hmm...latin was the usual boring unknown stuff. the latin vocab we learnt today was a tinsey bit sexually inclined (>. jason's mobile .  badminton was good - sort of. didn't play kiong of the hill but me and york beat jeff and miyoko (that's how you spell it right?) miyoko's actually really scary when she smashes the shuttlecock down, lolz. spent the rest of the time listening the ian's mp3. i don't think i'm going back there anymore,  try-outs for vball  should start next week. farewell willoughby leisure centre and buses with really weird willoughby girls high ppl. *shiver* at least they weren't on the bus today. but a random sat next to me and kept asking me where chatswood was. -.-;; we were practically there. oh, and i saw ian and his mum walking to get his L's.  go ian ! hehe...he can drive now. i have a feeling it won't be the sports car - knowing azn/honky mothers. lolz. i have no idea how i went on for so long but i shall conclude here by saying that i missed out on the chem olypiad registration date because i was at japanese excursion which means i won't do the exam. w00t! =)

      ... hehe i just couldn't contain myself. We won first game of bball. 41-34&nbsp; that's what it said on the scoreboard neway*glares at ian*. and I SCORED FIRST POINTS *feels proud*. Next stop NBA grand finals... well mbe im gettin a little ahead of myself, but we're lyk the mighty ducks. District 12 - premiers. We got a winning start to new season, new name, new uniform... hehe and a new recruit a.ka. lanky. So on this theory we're gonna get to the finals and verse the best team, whom we stole a playa off... so half tsunami but then.... yeah well we're gonna have a major comeback and be one pt down with a couple of seconds to go. *Miraculous steal* *cheers from the crowd* *team&nbsp;urges on* *he dribbles down court&nbsp;with one man back to beat*&nbsp;*he fakes one way, goes the otha* *AND DUNKS IT* ....well mbe not *he goes for the shot..misses but sum1 comes up behind and&nbsp;*DUNKS IT* ...well mbe just lays it in... yes well im still full of adrenalin even tho I ....err 'forgot' yes that's the word to stretch and cramped up in the 2nd half. Many thx to will and arun 4 helpin us win, u guyz rocK.

(>.       happy birthday emma ! starting to drive yet? =)    did physics test today. it was weird. i hated the table with the 'force magnifers' and 'speed/distance magnifier' things. it was confusing. it really was loooong. next stop:  electricity . apparently its really easy? *hopefully*    we're starting to read   'to kill a mockingbird '  for english --- it doesn't look too good...*sigh* subject selection forms handed out to us today, they need em back by friday T__T *gasp* here are the finalised sub selections (unless my dad disagrees):          3 english + 3 maths + 2 chem + 2 legal + 2 jap      reserve subs: 2 biology // 2 ancient history // 2 physics  all selections are in order of preference. +_- and our blog is NOT dead --- its more alive than any other blog atm. bah!

      And with this new chapter of Judge Mabel of Tran, Fox Studios have decided to pounce on this marketing opportunity and have launched a new soapie, entitled 'CounterAttack - Feat. Grandmaster cHoWy'  GM-cHoWy aka Mr Match has been called on by Fox Studios and sent to an unknown part of the world. It actually has been TV's biggest plagiarised practical joke, bigger than the Joe Schmo show. GMC actually thinks he is up to win $100,000, when in fact he is being set up by a secret lover, Grandmistress cHoWy! Why is Fox doing this? Because the idea was copied and they can get him to do stuff unimaginable!  Find out weekly on Introspective.tk for the next installment of CounterAttack - Feat. Grandmaster cHoWy

      jonOh:   "Whats this, lyk all soapies we're back for a new season on "Mabel of Tran - the new 'court' room" (ahhhh get it).&nbsp;AND WHATS THIS a new character. Recapping bpay and tran man have crossed paths again.... in holy matrimony. GM-cHoWy aka Mr. Match raised bpay from death and helped tran man escape from a maximum security prison. He took them to a romantic tropical paradise off the coast of Timbuctoo, called Whoop Whoop. Mysterious remnants of a famous court room were found scoured around the island...   *Bpay: ahhh its such a wonderful day... my love*   *Tran Man: yes.... any day with u is wonderful, pure bliss*   *They gaze longingly into each others eyes, zooming out with a backdrop of the setting sun and the serene setting of waves melancholically crashing against the golden beach*   What heights of love will they reach on the next episode of Mabel of Tran   Benlee is not a girl, he simply lyks the show Girl TV which obviously isn't targeted at girls. He merely gives the false notion that he is, getting in touch with his feminine side which he obviously lacks, as we can see from his insecurities?!?!? did u get that???

      Okey dokey, i'm sitting in Gordon Library and talking to Ken over e-messenger. I'm using e-messenger because the library computers are so restricted it won't even let me check my e-mail. So why am i sitting in Gordon Library at 3 'o' clock in the afternoon? Well today i spent the whole day at Macquarie University for Japanese continuers day. It was pretty interesting, worth missing school over. Anyway it ended at 2 and i got a lift with Ken to Gordon station, where i'm waiting for my environmental science book to return to me. I could be home, but i'm here instead. Walking into the library at 2:30 was a bit strange. All the librarians and people were giving me weird looks that said "why the hell are you here, shouldn't you be at school?". Libraries are so empty during the day. Funny moment: when David Kim got the phone number of a Hornsby Girl he thought he knew from somewhere.

      Did anybody besides me notice that Benlee's post was the 100th post on this blog? Oh well guess we'll just have to wait for the 1000th post to celebrate.  My day was pretty normal which means i didn't do any work. careers was funny because Draper comes in halfway through the lesson, says shes busy with something else and lets us all go to sport half and hour early. SCRAM was ok, the adjudicator was really nice and there were pretty funny moments in it. Hope we get into next round.

      When one has no expectations, there is no disappointment.   So when Mr Lowe sends&nbsp;the 2nd Grade Table Tennis team&nbsp;to Ashfield to vs Epping, when instead we were suppose to go to Normanhurst to vs them, semi-final fever has no effect. The result is that we are now kicked out of the competition, never to find out the result from an otherwise disappointing season. At least failing to turn up at a venue gets a dismissal at 1:10 and skip Period 3.  "grr First Grade and John Chan with his C200 Merc Transport vehicle" The only way we probably could've made it to Normo in 5min was to fit a Rocket out the back of Starlings V6 Beast and an AMG sticker on the Merc. "Jet-powered Teleporters is the way to go" But with obvious depleted resources in a government funded school, one could only&nbsp;find a CD version of Job Guide 2004. Gone are the days with that chunky-newspaper book.   And yes lets introduce an update of 'Its a Girls Life and We like it'  In yesterdays episode, it was found out that infact, not 2, but all 4 girls had bought the same prom dress as each other! *audience wows* And they were arguing whether makeup would suit the dress, and if the seasonal shortage in rainfall was caused by El Nino (yes im serious).  Todays episode, AsianGirl tells of her sudden disbelief in astro star signs, quoting them as 'dumb' (Vocabulary is limited to using 4 letter adjectives).&nbsp;What will the girls do to convert AsianGirl back!? At the end of the episode, an ad comes up saying "Girl TV was proudly brought to you by Bratz" They even have their own plasticine doll lineup, to re-enact that "Shocking moment of Stars are DUMB!"  And Mabel...I&nbsp; just happened  to flick the TV on at 4:22.

      Having recently turned the TV on at about 4:20 Channel 7 showed an episode of Girl TV. And whaddya know - this particular act was hilarious. A 5min skit titled  &nbsp; "Its a Girls Life and We Like It - Episode E=MC²" &nbsp; watch out guys. &nbsp;cant remember all the quotes but the whole story goes along the lines of a teenage jessica simpson that has friends. And I think they intended to knock themselves &nbsp; Characters: Asian - Biddy? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The 'other' girl - Bimby? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blonde - Baby &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Red&nbsp;Curly Head&nbsp;- Well lets call her Bimbo &nbsp; *4 girls sitting at the table* *Bimbo introduces saying Girls are discussing the life-changing upcoming first prom dance* *Fight happens as they realise that 2 Biddy and Bimby have bought the same dress - the 'ultimate most divine' dress &nbsp; A few quotes from the story: &nbsp; Biddy: *says something Tech* Baby: Oh wow that was soo Wise, your like my grandfather. I never understood anything he said. Biddy: Well then how do u know it was wise Baby: Well cos I didn't understand him (note that Baby is a blonde) &nbsp; Bimby: Guess What!? You know that dress that we saw the other day? I convinced my dad to buy it! Bimbo: NO WAY! *slams table* Biddy: GET OUT! Baby: I think i'm going to cry! Bimby: Whats wrong with that? Biddy: Cos I bought the exact same dress (like in mean girls she must be thinking BIATCH!) &nbsp; having a current mental blank...i was laughing the whole way through. All this acting is paired with a lot of hilarious exaggerated acting.  &nbsp; Bimbo: Well one way to resolve this issue, whoever bought it first gets to wear it Bimby: Well ye, that'd work. But like, what if, like, u know, I wear the dress with white spunked hair and Asian girl can wear it with u know, like, like black stuff cos ur asian Baby: Oh ye that'd work too Asian Girl: No it wouldn't. Thats stupid Baby: I dont understand Asian Girl: U don't understand anything Baby: Oh ye, thats right &nbsp; Well you guys must understand the jitz of it. Note that in another episode they will resolve this issue. "So lets like, u know, like how bout we like watch it tmr afterschool&nbsp;or tape it, u know, thatd be like, really, u know like ye, real cool."

      Those of you who read the paper this morning (haha…andy doesn’t get the paper during the holidays) would’ve have seen the small article of the front page about bus drivers. You’re probably thinking “bus drivers, who cares, they are just the guys who get me to school” well this article is not just about bus drivers. It’s about giving bus drivers the power to remove students off buses for swearing, vandalism, spitting and just generally being uncooperative and unruly. The State Government drafted this law (or bill for all you commerce freaks) last night, probably out of boredom and thought this power would be useful to bus drivers.  &nbsp;  Ok, I will admit that us students can be a bit unruly at times, usually after either something really good or something really bad happens, but it’s like teenage human nature. The bus drivers and the public we travel with should know all about Generation X and how at this age our raging hormones causes random acts of unruliness and recklessness. I mean everybody goes through this faze of rebelliousness, even people as dull as bus drivers. I mean how times have your parents told you about all the crazy antics they got up to when they were young? I know my dad is always saying, “When I was your age, I had street fights everyday (yeah right) and I would always come home bruised with lots of cuts. Why aren’t you like that Wayne?” Well in this “civilized” society that governs us today, getting into street fights usually results in bruises and cuts as well as assault charges, lawsuits and probably juvenile detention. To avoid “juvey” us teenagers have to find someway to channel all that pent up energy our parents used to do crazy antics right? And what better way to do it than to be unruly on public transport?  &nbsp;  Everybody who catches the 651 in the afternoons would have at least experienced one of those times where the kids keep pressing the button and then the bus driver stops at the next stop and doesn’t move until someone gets off. Usually in these situations the kids win because after a while the bus moves without anybody gets off. Now bus drivers would think the students’ press the button to annoy him. This is true but only to a certain extent because we also push the button because we like that sound. In the society we live in we don’t here many bell sounds and the one of the bus is the only one we know of. Why can’t you bus drivers leave us bell-deprived kids alone?  &nbsp;  The State government should thank us kids as well because we are doing them a favour. We are conditioning the bus drivers. Pretty soon bus drivers on school buses just learn to block it all out, all the noise just becomes background. Because they are not listening to the noise they are more focused on their jobs, getting people from point A to point B. We are indirectly providing the government with highly focused, mentally strong bus drivers. Of course there are those who have a mental breakdown while driving a school bus, but just forget I mentioned them. The government should make it mandatory that trainee bus drivers have to do school routes for at least 6 months as part of their training.  &nbsp;  Fortunately for school students the Parent and Citizens Association does not want the bill to be passed because they say if you kick off a kid in the middle of nowhere (like Whoop Whoop for example), nowhere near other public transport services, then the child’s safety is in question. Students are stranded and unable to get home and they call their parents who get quite pissed off that they have to get to Whoop Whoop to get their kid. The PCA reckons bus drivers should not determine whether a situation is right or wrong, they should report any incidents to the school and let the school deal with it.  &nbsp;  School students do annoy bus drivers, but it’s for there own good, the same type of good that parents say you will thank them for later. Therefore bus drivers should not be able to kick off students. I rest my case.&nbsp; &nbsp;

      wah! how cold was it today? *brrr* and i had to wake up at 7 too...but it was worth it *grins* as i said, i slept over so i could go to adro's church/youth group. *fun fun* stupid train delay of like 5 mintues, made me wait in the freezing gale force wind-ed, druggie-less chatswood station for a bit too long. *shiver* got onto warm cozy train and had to get off again at gordon. darn... keke. the fact that it isnt held at a church is quite new for me. i always had a stereotypical impression of anything religious being held at church *shrug* the fact that i lacked a pen and a bible wasn't too important *wat not tell me adro?* but everyone was realli nice. met all these ppl...oops, forgotten their names already. umm...jonathan, stephen, clifford, grace, phoebe, denise, joyce, ray, and some others *oops* oh and i saw jade again! after like 3 years...the memories of chinese school when we actually had a  normal  teacher... quite an interesting morning. funny game about singing songs with the word 'love' in the lyrics. *lacking in english song knowledge* but it was fun...my group lost >. then we went on to start their term three topic: sex and relationships *surprise surprise* hehe. its very interesting how they like analyse the Bible and everything with that bklet ^__^ a bit too quick for me but maybe cos i havent read any of it yet *waits for doug on tuesday to give Bible* the topics brought up were all very interesting. hehe. shame that i cant go for the rest of the year..oh well --- maybe next year *ill do it for DOE skill too* by then hopefully i will have TRIED to read through the Bible. we finished up with a service of singing and piano playing *good wk adro ^___^* and a talk by john (??) --- the topic was "what about you" as in what do YOU think about Jesus and God. hehe...then outta the blue phoebe tells me to give an intro to the rest of the group *shock horror, those public speaking skills came in handy...maybe not* haha. so yeah, i'll have to wait awhile to go back there...aiya...cskool...dun remind me. stupid kevin..skipping cskool for 3 wks -_____-" the rest of the day is not worth mentioning...hehe...lunch, walk around, steambowl, etc.

      I am blogging here tonight on the request of andy, because we both know that nobody else would blog tonight and so i had to strain brain cells (surprise...i do have them) to think of a topic to blog about. I have chosen to blog about auto pilot.  Auto pilot is cool because it gives the impression that i'm doing something when mentally i'm not. Here's an example, for those who don't know i play the piano, and after a while my fingers know all the notes. This allows my mind to kinda wander away for the hours that i practise while letting anyone who walks by see that i'm playing properly. Another good example is swimming. During my weekly 4km swim, my mind drifts away while my arms and legs continue to stroke. Auto pilot is also good indication whether something is boring or not. I do not enjoy swimming or playing the piano because it's boring so i have autopilot. I have not yet come across any other activities that have autopilot yet but if any of you guys have an auto pilot for something tell me. I just want to see the wide range of activities that have them

      Seems like everyone these days is turning to religion in times of peril, terror and insecurity. As one has figured out, Andy has turned christian. And people are getting excited. Looks like im becoming&nbsp;the black sheep of the group...(Shouldnt be&nbsp;"Introspective" rather "Christospective") &nbsp;  You know what...Im excited too.&nbsp; Not the fact Andys a Christian (thats excitement already) but the real excitement is the fact that...wait...  &nbsp;    MANLY BEAT THE BYE AND HAVE GOT 2 VICTORIES IN A ROW  &nbsp;     &nbsp;  YESSSSSSSSSS!!! IM SO DAMN HAPPY!!! Its a been struggle for months but its eventually happened.&nbsp; JOY, DELIGHT, HAPPINESS!!! YESSSSSSSS!!!  &nbsp;  Plus, I Robot is only a week away...Its going to be an absolute blockbuster.  &nbsp; The negatives: Schools starting soon.&nbsp;Equals work. Equals pressure.

      I learnt a very important lesson today, always listen to what your optometrist says. I went to the city today to go see my optometrist and he told me he had to dilute my eyes so he could see the back of them. I was like "Sure no problemo, do what you want". He said that the drops would&nbsp;make everything glary (is that even a word?) and i would probably need to wear sunglasses on the way back home. Anyway, everything looked normal afterwards and i said i didn't need sunglasses because everything was fine (and i didn't know what glary meant). He said i should wear some sort of eye protection and i refused. The moment i stepped out of the building, sunlight reflected off&nbsp;every shiny object in the vicinity somehow magnified itself and forced itself into my eyes. So this is what glary meant. Everywhere i turned light and glare and man was it annoying, especially going over the bridge where the sunlight reflected off the harbour. So if there is one thing you learn out of this blog, it's that listen to people who know there profession really well, or you'll probably regret it. (N.B. It's nice to see that our blog is sufficiently alive though i reckon we could comment a lot more)

      You want to knock soccer...well, im on jonos side. No one knocks soccer and gets to live with it.   Simple fact 1: Stop getting so damn emotional and get over yourself. We are your friends and we are guys too. So from the head of male heterosexual - Stop having a hissy-fit and a whinge and pull your socks up.  Apart from that, Ive got to agree with you: Jonos fucking bored shit and all that BULLSHIT he made up shows he is fucking bored. But that was gay to say he had no hope and say hes not a human. Thats just too emotional and personal shit. I mean he saying you are a girl was funny, but theres no truth in that, so thats all good.   So wat am i trying to say...Well, its simply this:  GET UR SHIT TOGETHER.

      alrite. i'm okay now. more or less anyway. and i am inclined to blog to stick up for myself.   firstly, i'd like to make a correction to jono's obviously crappy hearing skills - its was MR tam not MRS tam -__-'' this realli sounds like a debate...LoLz. with the "you two are the best" bit - clearly jono lacks friends, whether they be male or female. no wonder you watch 'Friends' in such an obsessed fashion jono. i'm disappointed to hear that after watching almost every episode you have failed to understand the importance of having friends especially when you're feeling sad. "i feel" and "i have a weird feeling..." in this case does not refer to loving someone...but obviously you wouldn't know what its like to love someone now would you? *glare ^__^* i'm also questioning whether jono is human - being moody is natural when someone feels sad or depressed and it is only when it occurs in excess and to an unbearable extent can it be classified as PMS. "[feelin] regretful" is also another  human  quality which jono obviously lacks. pfft.  jono...you are clearly bored --- i don't think playing so many games of DDR, watching Mean Girls, followed by soccer training was beneficial to your brain whatsoever.  LMAO. aiya...bored malaysian jono...*sigh* you have no hope.

      "i have this weird feeling in my stomach. feel like vomiting. i feel very moody. i feel like my life's turned from realli realli good to realli realli bad in a matter of hours. i've never felt like this before. i want to turn back time and relive my life - erase all of my life's biggest mistakes. i feel regretful."  I kno this may seem lyk an english essay but I'm gonna write it neway as I'm bored (unlyk andy wen i try to express things which r hard I don't ramble on in canto ^-^, I write about it). This may hv bin influenced my the watchin of Mean Girls but here it goes. also andy feel free 2 delete this if u feel it violates ur rights in ne way or sum lawyer mumbo jumbo.   "I feel" Andy is turning into a girl "i have this weird feeling in my stomach" its called LOVE (insert a certain special sum1 here). "I fell very moody" again this highlights my earlier claims of Andy being a girl... its a sign of PMS and also js general bitchiness. The notion u get from the text is similar to that of a song with whiny lirics. It brings a sad and dreary tone to the text and highlights the changes going on in a persons life. "I've never felt like this before" this is because of the ongoing emotional changes which occur in an adolescent male or female. "life's changed and its so hard to get used to" its changed 4 every1... js slightly differently 4 Andy :P. "you two are the best" the fact that he spills and is comforted by his 'girlfriends' (not in the lovy-dovy kind of way) emphasises the inclination of Andy.   "i feel regretful." this is a common emotion in those suffering from depression and trauma during the teenage years. However this syndrome is temporary and cures when the sufferer attains a new level of maturity. This fact is recognised by the author "i'll be fine. just need some time to think about my life." Another quick but temporary fix is an "ORANGE MOCHA FRAPPUCHINO".   (>.  shows the emotional changes that go on during the teenage years. The author "Andrew Yeo" tries to express his views using personal experiece, nonsensical whining, the repetition of the word feel and peotic devices to convey his message to the lifeless readers hu visit this blog. He is turning into Annie Yeo, or mAndy as Mrs. Tam puts it :P  Well i cud go on, but i won't   This is totally untrue and is a sadistic attempt by me 2 "blog here to blog, no matter how meaninglessly boring it is" and also to improve my english skills.  note: i cud give u a psychologists view of Granmaster chowy's theory of y this has happened to Andy but I won't. This theory of mine holds true in many other cases... including myself but in slightly different ways, u hv 2 kno the person 2 apply this theory... and also hv certain otha special characteristics so I won't post it here. I believe there is another reason y Andy is suffering this sickness but I won't post it here, its quite simple tho and may surface another time.  Jono

      Ok, the title doesn't have much to do with this blog, it's just a reminder to those who blog here to blog, no matter how meaninglessly boring it is. Anyway today I went to the beach...to do some research for my geography assignment. Thanx to Yi-Long, Jack and Ken for coming. It was pretty good, we took (well Ken took) lots of photos. Most of them had nothing to do with coastal management but meh. Handed out some surveys to some residents of Collaroy. One old man, who was very friendly told us about recent developments in coastal management (Did you know there are concrete pyramids 7 feet below the sands of Collaroy? Laid down as tank traps against possible invasion during WWII) Saw Harvey, who was also doing geo assignment. Had lunch, watched a movie (mean girls) and then went home.  So remember keep the blog alive.

      Just like there are 2 sides to a coin, there are 2 sides to a story...or person. Let me present the boring but nice side and the crazily crude side.   Nice Side   I enjoy my life. Its just great to do IPT, considering the benefits we receive from it. Before, I was useless on the computer, but now I have managed to increase my proficiency. Imagine creating a DVD...it was beyond me before...How i enjoy studying IPT. Even the assignments are tasks which improve our knowledge and competency. And general school is a success. Without it, how can we learn? We would merely be pathetic flops on the street.  Manly are playing wonderfully, they have really put the problems of the past years away and will only get better. Manchester United are definitely going to set the pace this year.   Friends and family only assist in the joy of my life, with the postitive aura and flow.  Geez, life is great...   DA CRUDE SIDE   WTF is going on??? Im fucking sick of the crap dats going through my life. Ill start wit sport. GET UR BLOODY ACT together u piece of shit eagles. How hard can it b to do well. Im sure im not da only one whos sick of ur shocking, abyssmal results. Beating da Tigs by 8. HOW CRAP CAN U B??? N wat da hell r u doing Man Utd. Stop buying nobodys like Smith n actually get some gud playas!!! Ur supposed to b da best club in the world...stop acting lik Liverpool (SO DAMN CRAP).   School sux...Just ruin wateva fun in my childhood i have left. While da rest of youse only have 1 assignment, ive got 3 cos im a fuckn moron. IPT is a plague, get near it, sucks u in n swallows ur life. Vid assignment is a joke. Suppose to make a DVD but dat will prob turn out to b an atrocity. N all dat otha note taking BS. 50 hrs of my life...Yeh im pretty sure dat'll b gone once im finished. Make dat schools a joke. 80% of shit u learn is literally shit...ull neva use it agen in ur life.   Thnx to shit barber, i look lik a square brick. Wen i do get ammo n a gun, ur da first on my list. SMS.AC, u keep sending me junk, so ur second. Thnx to da dikheads who screwed my footage, ur 3rd.  Im in a pissed mood, so heres da 411. I dun believe in religion, but i think its gud for ppl dat do. If ur life is crap, religion really helps. N no one shud care dat God doesnt exist. Its really irrelevant. Bush n Howard r full of shit n someone shud take dem out like dey shot J.F.K. Waste our world and wreck our society y dun u??? Well get our revenge...Lifes really a bitch...it involves taking a lot n giving a little (but making sure u got media coverage) n destroying othas around u.  Some guy said lifes everything u wanna make it to b. Dat was b4 he massacred 20 ppl. So b smart in da head, not in da brain. Cos everyones numero uno n ull only surplus if u wish to b in someones life.   *NOTE* "DA CRUDE SIDE" is a complete and utter fallacy and was just me bored and annoyed, attempting to BS some stuff up. In real fact, my life is very fine, but certain parts are crap, hence the exaggeration of the circumstances.

      Dude, that last blog was worse than my usual lack-of-substance blogging. You must be seriously bored.  For all those who don't know it, after 2 hours of panic i have managed to find my geography sheets. Of course now my room looks like a bomb hit it (and no, my room doesn't usually look like a bomb's hit it) and i'll probably be forced to clean it up. But the important thing is that i found them. UPDATE: I am bored NOTE: Nobody blogs here cept me, andy, jack and jono. i think some deletions are in order admin..glares at andy.

      Due to a few expressions of interest to the idea of heading up to Dee Why for a day, i have come about to set a day. Because i'm a nice guy we can either go on Thursday or Friday, i don't mind which. I haven't figured out any of the details so i'll get back to you on that. So if you're interested e-mail me and tell me wat day(s) you can come and i'll get back to you within 2 days. Note: you should probably contact me before Wednesday night so get on with it.

      Famous last words. Probably originated when school was invented (who gives a shit when that was).   Its like a week evaporated into thin air. Most of us must be mulling over where that anti-climatical first week went. Some people go places, others stay home to be entertained by TV, comp etc. A very small minority do work. (What a bunch of tossers!!!) But then the realisation comes that only a week is left. Many critics may say a weeks a long time (sport generally). Others, like me, totally disagree. Especially when u havent touched 3 assignment due in successive increments. However, i still dont want to begin any of them...  Wayne, going to Dee Why (or as you would like to call it "Whoop Whoop") to gather necessary info for the geo assignment is a good idea. Gather some interested people together and ill help organise it.

      ok ok i know it's 5 past 6 and yes i did just get up...from a totally wasted afternoon sleep. You see here is how i spent my day. I woke up at 9 and got up and 9:30 which was when my parents told me that we were going to yumcha and were leaving now. This prompted me to get dressed and cleaned in something like 10 minutes (and a pretty good job i'd say). I won't go into why we were going to yumcha on Sunday because it'll take too long. Let's just say it involves my grandmother who is staying here at the moment. Due to track work in the city, we caught a bus to central (again don't ask why we were eating in central).  The first sign of trouble was when we got there and noticed quite a large crowd of people standing outside the yumcha place. This turned out to be people waiting for a table. Now we had to wait for a table and we waited...and waited...and waited and pretty soon i was quite pissed off and bored because i was hungry as i missed breakfast and i brought nothing to do. After an hour i rang andy out of pure boredom and talked to him from a payphone in the middle of this waiting crowd (note: if anybody ever wants to be a person i call out of pure boredom please leave a name plus number). By now i have a fat headache caused by loud random noise caused by annoyed people. Then i get pulled off the phone because we finally get a table. So i'm eating with a large headache still with lots of noise. Not good. When we finished we went to Chinatown etc. all the asian places asian people go in the city. I was travelling along in a kinda drugged trance due to headache. When we got home at 4 i went straight to bed and i just woke up. Anyway RICE was fun, saw lots of people, learnt some new stuff, relearnt some old, saw a HP3 (not that bad). And that was my weekend.

      hmm...this isnt cool --- our blog is dying >. on a happier note, i went to RICE last night!     米 RICE 2004 :: WHERE IS THE LOVE?     it was great! wow. there were so many people, so many that i knew ^__^ the band was great, the singers were great (the second from the left was a bit over-enthusiastic i thought), the videos were very pro, the   frankenstein play   and 'dress-up' ian powell (i don't think people clapped for ian dancing --- they were clapping for nathan -_-'') was hilarious and the ian powell talk was really meaningful. =D ionno what it was that ian said (i've heard a lot of it before) but i think it was more the way he said it that made it very emotionally moving. no, i'm not christian yet..hehe, but getting there. anyone who didnt go this year, should go next year! (nathan wong: i'll bet RICE was more interesting than SAKURA SNOW concert thingo ^__^)

      wow. i'm impressed. you pplz have actually blogged for the three days that i've been away at my aunts place! but then again....not much substance in your blogs wayne. hehe. well then, the reason why i havent been online is cos i've been at my aunt's place sleeping over so that i could conveniently wake up at 7 in the morning to get the UTS Broadway by 8:30. yes. me, adro, his brother jono, and jono chow went to UTS Australs 2004 to chair the debates. there were other ppl like koziol, kimson, etc there too....but yes. for those ppl like ben who don't know what chairing is, its keeeping the time of the debates, intro-ing the debators and serving food on the occasion, not ADJUDICATOR ^___^ yes. we didnt do much in terms of DEBATING but chairing debates between Australiasian teams (HK, Beijing, Australia, NZ, etc) was really good experience. i really cbb to outline the happening of these three days in a blog --- if anyone is bored, namely wayne, you are welcome to ring me about it. lmao. but yeh. three late nights, a lot of debates, a lot of support for honky teams, made new friends, watched random short movies and even sang Shannon Noll's 'What About Me'. that's the general jist of things...it was a worthwhile experiece...and i also became familiar with UTS Ultimo. cheerz. ill c everyone at RICE i hope ^___^

      Gus Gould said it the best: "I get a fair bit of criticism from what I view to be either immature misinformed people who get intimidated by their own insecurities or get intimidated by what they don't understand. I coach for the players, I coach for the game. What I've done over the last three years I don't want any raps for but I don't deserve the shit you've fucking given me. Not one word of it...You tell me what happened tonight. The shit you dished up to me over that, I'll remember it. A few people haven't shown their faces this week but I'll remember it. You go hard, go as hard as you like. You haven't broken me in nine years and you won't break me now."  He's not the only one that is sick of the bullshit and prentiousness that occurs in society nowadays. Every one seems to be so goddam self-conscious they wont even tell the truth in case it wrecks their own high view of themselves.   E.g. You should be more subtle about what you say...  Im not going to say something nice and disembled just to please some person. If its shit, its shit. If its good, its good. Simple, clear-cut statements. None of this "well, it is intriguing and shows you have tried your best." Face it, this means YOUR TERRIBLE. GO GET A NEW HOBBY.   The world is a worse place if there are not enough people who will just tell the truth.  GOULDY, you wont ever be forgotten.

      Thank you Jack, for bringing back into the wonderful reality of assignments. I wanted to blissfully ignore the fact i had a geography assignment for the whole holidays, but you have managed to bring my attention back to it once again. Speaking of geo assignments, does anybody want to head up to Dee Why next week for "research" for our geography project?

      Sorry guys, but this reminders to make sure we dont forget and suddenly realise were fucked on the last day of the holz.  1. Geo Assignment This ones for everyone. Some bullshit and pictures should do the trick. Refer to coastal management.  2. IPT Assignment Only a small minority of ppl. Get firewire card, jewel case, Adobe Encore and Premiere, Audacity, microphone, etc. Editing and production. If you havent grabbed footage, dont panic, still 5.5 weeks. 15% and definitely dont screw it.   3. Maths Assignment 4 ppl. Aba, Lotto, Hazza and me. Do logbook, both personal and group. Suggest changes.  This probably isnt for everyone, but it might save you from going "OH SHIT!!" on last day of holz.

      This is so seriously boring. I'm actually thinking about doing some school work to bring me out of this meaningless trance-like state I am currently residing in. So damn bored!!! Very Andy go chair debates for 3 days with Adro. think about it, how fun can it possibly be to CHAIR a debate for 3 days *sigh* (yes i'm going to the use the sigh). Anyway this holiday has been so useless. I should be doing science booklets for gondek but i'm just to lazy. Maybe if i change my work ethic, this holiday won't be so boring from now on. Nah. Not state the obvious or anything, but this blog is dying. Somebody come up with something new and exciting to make it good (don't mock my lack of vocabulary). Did i mention that:     I'm so seriously bored it's not funny     Yeah i think you got that. As you can see i'm blogging out of boredom which is probably not a good sign.  P.S Very Jack, post the short version of "beware of greeks and their corner kicks" on your blog and paste the fat version on ours

      Slightly coincidental that the day Greece prevailed in the world sport of Soccer in the European Championships of 2004 held at the country of Portugal, I also watched Troy on DVD. As one has guessed, sport plays an integral part in today's society. This is exemplified by the hordes of people gathering in their respective cultural centres for yesterday's thrilling final. Those who can not play sport or unable to successfully integrate it into their lives are miserable people. Whether soccer, tennis, basketball, rugby of all kind, etc, sport is an invocation of emotion. Take Wimbledon. Federer and Sharapova are Champions. Just see them at the end of their matches. It is an example of pure ecstasy and joy. As much as one can criticise the misdemeanours of sport, one can not criticise the goodness and positive emotion it brings to people around the world. To break this seemingly random blog, I state two things, unsurprisingly from the arena of sport.  Andy Roddick after Wimbledon final against Federer at All England Club: "I threw everything and the kitchen sink at him (Federer), but he went to the bathroom and got the tub." Andy Roddick at press conference: "Is she (Sharapova) going to wear a long skirt or a short skirt? I wish I was champion so I could go to the party...Uhhh, I guess I'll just crash it anyways."  Sport also brings a state of humour that would otherwise be unachievable in the daily drudgery of our lives. (You have to say Roddick is pretty funny). It also embellishes a side of goodwill and gracious defeat. It lets out all the "BOOHOOs" (Cristiano Ronaldo crying after the defeat of Portugal in EURO 2004 Final), while also bringing sheer adulation and delight ("King Otto" embracing his successful troops in EURO 2004 Final).  Hopefully, some anti-sportarian will read this and permanently remove his/her negative beliefs against SPORT. With the consuming media nowadays, one usually only sees the negatives of sport, e.g. drugs in athletics and cycling, etc. It is sad to view hundreds upon hundreds disgust sport, as much as one disgusts school. The time of change is upon us. No longer will we live in an age which constantly condemns sport, no longer will we be brainwashed by the despicable tactics of the media. Tonight, marks the era of change, when the underdogs will be crowned champions, when more people will participate in more sport and when people will embrace sport, not deny it from their lives.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  On a totally differrent note, does anyone want to organise something in the holidays? I was thinking Zone 3 and then we could all crash at Andy's house (like one obviously does). Getting drunk is up to you ;) (Note: I do not condone any alcohol of any kind...except 5 COUGARS THANX!!!)   If you are still reading this....well, you have plenty of spare time. Im disappointed Portugal didnt win. Im disappointed Ronaldo didnt slot that chance at goal in. Im disappointed that Manly consistently lose by something to 50. Im disappointed everyone says Spiderman 2 is bad. Im disappointed that I couldnt watch or listen to EURO 2004 Final. Im disappointed that I didnt get Shrek 2 on DVD. Disappointed seems to be the word of the day for me. Boredom also sets in terrifingly quickly. I think I will stop now...Im sure I have definitely bored and disappointed all of you.   May life be beautiful and joyous.

      	What is the purpose of the last day of school/term/year (you get the idea)? Why does this day exist? The answer to that question would be because without it school would continue on forever. Think about it, if there were never a last day of school then theoretically school would continue on without ever stopping. Now most us you would agree with me and say that whatever government department comes up with such a notion deserves to be burned down and have their ashes nuked. But for those who find never ending school a miracle then you deserve to be locked in the same government department while it is being burned and later nuked. But is this the correct answer? I am endeavoring to find the meaning of the last day, like those who endeavor to find the meaning of life…without much luck. 	The last day of school has many different perspectives depending on what school you are from. If your from say Killara where the students pretty much rule the school then the last day of school means one word “CHATSWOOD”. If your from my school where the school rules the school then it means “turn up if you want, we can accept the fact that you don’t want to come to this moneyless hole, but remember this is only one of four days in which you can do so”. If you’re from NSG where the school  rules the school with an iron fist then it means “turn up or DIE”. So from this I have gathered that if you go to NSG then there is no such thing as the last day of school effectively meaning that school will never finish for you. To this I can only say it’s your own fault for having enough money to be able to pay your teachers enough to work every day of the school term. 	My last day of school went something along the lines of this: 1st period- listen to one 5 minute English speech, invade a Yr 9 classroom so we could watch their movie and eat their chocolate. 2nd period- go online and play computer games.  3rd period- shock horror, I actually have to use a pen. Wrote half a page of notes, munched chocolate, talked about pop culture. (I notice I’ve had a lot of chocolate by now) 4th period- run between jap room and computer room to copy files for presentation. Sneak out halfway through due to lack of interest in subject. Should probably mention that the teacher was watching while I walked out for an early lunch. 5th period – played table tennis. Decided to leave at 2:30. Unfortunately there was no bus so I went back to school to watch basketball. 6th period – watched basketball. Felt depressed due to lack of happy happy endorphins. 	As you can see I would have been much better off staying at home that day. Last year on another last day, I was walking to school with the Su’s (for those of you who don’t know who they are they are extremely smart twins who dress the same. Most of us consider them to be one person instead of two hence the collective term “The Su”) and we were discussing the last day. Through this discussion I mentioned how the last day should be cancelled. The Su pointed out that doing so would just create another last day and if you continue canceling last days then a school term practically won’t exist. I said something like “So?” to which the Su replied with a withering glare. During this conversation I mentioned my plan for education in the future. I won’t tell you it here, but it involves brain transplants, microchips and one or possibly several very large computers. Basically it eliminates the need to go to school at all and it was my answer to the lack of existence of a school term.  	So from this I have concluded that the meaning of the last day is…I have absolutely no idea at all. Although, I have managed to find the reason for its existence, I somehow think that this is not the entire meaning. It’s like one piece of a 3D jigsaw puzzle recommended for people over 25.  So to recap I don’t know the meaning of the last day, but if you do feel free to tell me anytime.

      wow. haven't posted for quite a while. let's continue this lil RICEfest posting. yes, im not christian and i went. lolz. met jeff at strat station and waited for ben to come and pick us up. he took us bak to his house where we saw his maltese! joey. hehe. realli cool lil doggie. so yeh, went on a lil tour for jeff around the house, before we left for concord in charissa's car. when we got there i saw so many ppl! the line was huge and i met heidi for the first time, i saw tina and josie (wow, its been ages since ive seen em), alex zhang (ps friend who went to ruse), and all those other ppl from our skool. NSB: (yr10) me, jeff, jono, ben, almo, stanton, york, chi, nathan, joseph, jamie (with sisi). (yr 11) tommy, kelvin, phillip, (yr 12) tim....yes, that 'tim' and some other dudes i didnt know. oh and i think i saw lora wid jamie and co. at burwood station when i left? was that lora? hmm... overall, the fete was interesting. wasn't realli relevant in terms of chrisitanity lolz. it was more a huge gathering. lots of singing. there were three talks, only heard the first two. as doug said, the jumping castle brought back good memories. got my hair sprayed fluoro green...didnt turn out properly though. they had like, soy sauce drinking comps, lemon eating comps, blindfold dodge ball, blindfold wack-a-leader *grins at ben*, RICE idol and a load of other stuff. well worth our time. ^__^ yes...i know, its realli far away for north shore line ppl...but think about it, i am NON-CHRISTIAN and i live FURTHER away than all you nth shore ppl...and i WENT. so you should all go nxt yr. tina and josie wanted me to go spiderman wid them...hmm...but apparently it's not that good? hmm...so anyway. that was that. mum's bday today. going to bondi cos she needs to meet a client. hmmm.... she's getting consumed by her work - which in a way is good - cos she doesn't pick on me as much. lolz. hmmm... has anyone ever gotten that feeling where they have a lot of assignments/work and they still feel bored? i feel like that now. i should go and study for physics and maths and other stuff too...but i feel bored! dude. and then there's the three days of chairing for debates at UTS this week. wow...im pretty occupied. any idea where we're gonna eat before RICE 'where is the love' talk on saturday pplz?  and adro --- i didn't sigh AT ALL in this post! what an accomplishment. keke.

      Mai opinion on RICEfest...   I thought the RICEfest was heaps good... from our group... me, Ben, Andy, Jeff, n Jono went... n i think we all had a good time!  There were:  3 short talks... (i thought they were pretty simple, but they were to the point)   Jumping Castle!  - I thought this was the best part! so much fun... (bak in the old days...)   Heaps of food... (specially Rice!)   Prizes (tho we din't get much)   n last of all... since we're all azn,  "Good value for money" .  Anyways.. i thought that it was real good! If you've missed out on this event, well...  "better luck next year"   Seriously, now. If you've missed out on this event, then at least go to the second one...  "Where is the love?" . This event will probably be bigger n better than the RICEfest, n will be a real great night! If you still havn't been notified bout it... then go to  urlLink rice.hypox.org  to get info.   See ya there!

      Ever had that feeling where you were at school, and there was half the school there, and you wished that it was like that all the time? Probably not. But yeah that's what I'm feeling now. It's period 4 of the last day of term 2, and I'm here in A1 doing nothing. Waiting for wood to dry. So how's HOME for all those people who decided to jig? This is so boring. Going to go home in about an hour. Later.

      For those that are watching the slow and agonizing demise of this blog, may your hopes be rekindled that a glorious reincarnation of this morbid blog be of coming.  Your calls of distress and gurgled moans of blog death have finally reached my ears and I will from now on make some fevered attempts at preserving this blog with pointless posts and banter before it completely withers away and fades into oblivion. Through the judicious use of skill, tact, strategy, grace and so much cunning that you could stick a tail on it and call it a weasel, I will attempt to salvage what remains of this stricken blog. Only the small obstacle of not actually possessing any of these skills and traits and possessing the negative inversions of them may prevent such a miracle.  If I were to say post any blathering utterances onto this blog, along with that industrious Andy chap, then perhaps there is some hope. Unfortunately I heavily doubt that my wasted frame posses any such stores of either effort or will power to be consistent in such a thing. However, I have identified this particular deficiency in my nature and compensated many fold by an ingenious plan which I will now shortly divulge.  For you see, I say that we could hook up numerous autistic monkeys freshly smuggled in through the most dubious of trench coats and stuffy boxes from third world countries that have only the sole purpose of exporting autistic monkeys to supplement as writers of this blog. I’m sure that some of these confounded animals won't nearly cut the grade at all in their ability to produce coherent matter no matter how long they bang away, but I say give them enough time and idealistic imagination on the readers behalf, they may well be half as bad as I am. Besides, when compared to the rest of the Internet, their work would positively shine like a dim half a watt home brand light bulb on a sea of steaming black animal feaces.  Enough of my convoluted crass talk. I will promptly stop myself before the sane and the impressionable are afflicted. Then again I am not the type that would bugger a lark for what consequences I produce, so you may well expect further exercises of hard, confusing reading in the future, although don't be surprised if its by a monkey of some type.  Yours,  Weller, the fashionably deranged.

Not necessarily looks but test scores or computer techiness or their perception by other ppl. To be labelled sumthing which defines you is not necessarily a bad thing, if u rn't then its another story. Sum1's a lil unhappy abt himself *tear* "I hate myself at the moment" and that is the reason y u don't lyk being called a metro. I 2 hv been 'jokingly called  a metro' for ..... various reasons :P hehe we can b metro buddies but I don't mind. If i'm a metro im a metro (not that i necessarily am).  on another note, not blogging/using your computer and chatting isn't going to change nething, ull js ahve more spare wated time, and that's not a gud thing. The real cause of the problem, is much .... deeper hehe INNER JOURNEY - english.  newayz, since every1's deserting me I kno no1'll come bak to read my blogs *sigh* so if i don't post here again its good bai from grandmaster cHoWy ~a.k.a Mr. Match    ~ grandmaster cHoWy

      I reckon Andys right. Were wasting our lives on this blog crap. Lets stop spending time on the comp and do more stuff we can look back at and be proud. Yeh, Im sounding hella weird, but I never blog anyways and no one but Andy blogs. Reasons for Shutdown?  1. No one but Andy blogs. If he doesnt blog = Dustbowl. 2. Our privacys out the window. 3. No one gives a shit about our blog. 4. Its a fad. Lets get over it. 5. Sitting our your ass doesnt help you. 6. Prevents us doing work. 7. We go to a "good" school. Lets pretend that we are students of such a school.  I cant think of anymore but theres tonnes of reasons. What do you guys think???  Alright, now to shake off that weird shit, heres some emphatic words.  MANLY AND MAN UTD - DO IT FOR UR FANS Go Rockets. Go Swans. Go Australia in anything. GO CHINA>>>KICK JAPASS.

        do you ever get that queasy feeling where you don't know where your at in life? that's what i'm feeling now. this blog is going to be long. as i've been mentioning over the past few weeks, i've made all these mistakes and my most recent one has been life changing. i wish we could go back and wipe out these mistakes. friendships have been made in the course of my life but there have been a few which have been broken. previous ones haven't ben as devastating as the recent one. then there's the exams that i don't study hard enough for because i procrastinate and then i fail them --- namely maths. it's obvious what the problem is but you can't yourself to change it. i sit in front of this computer almost everyday, spending time blogging, chatting on msn when i could be doing something productive and furthering my education and yet i can't pull myself away from the computer.

         get over it people . lmao. yes, i can only go to nsg on mufti days and only twice a term at that...that is no reason for me to celebrate when it's mufti...nsg is not really that exciting considering i talk to people on msn half the time anyway -.-;; bah. so yes...the only thing that happened at nsg this morning was finding out didi's new way of speaking since she got plates, and also about emy's sis going around the house saying ' なんだいよう ！？' --- along those lines.

          australian language competition  for japanese today. it was really bad since we had been entered into the intermediate division one year in advance --- it was hard. put simply, half the grade guessed half the questions with the exception of yi long *you freek* and jeff with his hsc jap coaching *glares* and also those people that cheated off jeff *nudge*.

      I'm saving this blog from it's continual lack-of-substancy-type blogs (i.e. all the blogs andy has written while he is bored...so practically every single one). I'm blogging during english because english is boring and i severly hate it at the moment,  so much work due. If anybody has anything Alfred Hitchcock and his filming career could you please send it to me. Anyway today was pretty boring. Sniffed about a dozen different organic chemicals, all marked with a label that said POISON. Felt kinda dizzy afterwards and everything smelt like hospital swabs for a while on the accout of the amount of alcohol that entered my nostrils during that 55 minute science period. Also did the ALC (Australian Language Certificate) for jap today. Was extremely hard and i was reduced to guessing aimlessly, good to see that almost everyone else was the same way, except for Yi Long because he's very good at jap. Said he didn't need to guess on any question.    Isn't something missing, isn't someone missing me...

      I am now immune to the administrator's wrath of threats. Then again Andy might remove this blog, frame me for not blogging and forcefully extradite me to a place unknown - tushey. Blogging, similar to ranting and raving I see as a form of whining, whinging, whimpering (excuse alliteration). Why should one live in the past and reflect on whats happened. Move on I say! I shall stop now.

        maths test  was crappy. yes i know it was easier than the other ones...but i screwed up so badly --- at least i think i did. after maths test was geo where i took josh leong's billet, shiho ootake, to geo even though he's in my class. she was really friendly actually. english was ok. we read to kill a mockingbird again. cracked up when i heard almerick's canto  pronunciation  and his face. don't ask me why. he was being annoying. but now everytime i look at his face i will crack up. as this blog is read by people of all ages, i will refrain from talking about the slightly more disgusting aspects that materialised onto almo's face =)  vball try-outs  was boring. pointless. stuffed up. why do we have to have rixon as our teacher now?! *sigh* the jap billets joined in the game near the end and they were surprisingly good. and now i am home alone once again...being bored and typing a blog. i am really  pissed  at my maths performance and i will ... before the end of this year, dramatically improve...i hope. i will now proceed to go cook dinner, read to kill a mockingbird, do my english, do my history, read stuff on euthanasia for premiers cup debate, and feel regretful...        random:  一拍兩散  by joey is a good song. having your life turned upside down sucks. having parents that log your internet usage is funny *wayne*. legal age for learners is 16 and will not change in the near future according to the RTA. results of yesterday's debate is up on  urlLink hidden      "its hard to forget those happy times..."

        i think  i will start this month with random yet meaningful titles which do not in anyway reflect the contents of my blog...   the only reason i am online and blogging is because i need to take a rest from maths and also to try to maintain consistent blogging. i spent  3 hours  doing maths --- the longest amount of time since like...never?! so here i am taking a rest and expressing my thoughts. no. 1 the fact that no one on this blog actually blogs half the time -_-;;   i am the only one that blogs almost everyday, followed by wayne and jono. ken, jack, weller, yap, and doug have virtually disappeared and my fellow admin - adr0 has also vanished.  outrageous  i say! i'm considering kicking off half the list really...      anyway. today was school-free day because of *yes tash...that again...drumroll*  debating  at UTS for premiers cup. i will post results up on my site after maths test tomorrow but for now, our team won 2 out of 3 debates. it was nice going back the UTS --- the good memories of australs =) the topics were crap, the  adjudicator was monotonously boring  *he wrote less than a page of notes per debate*, we were stuck with him for all three debates, nsg entered their yr 9 team not their yr 10 team, we lost our prepared debate and won our unprepared debates, alastair rambled on for 8 minutes about porn and its detriments, the opposing second speaker said that 'pornography shows  intimacy and closeness ', our first debate was really funny, the adjudicator told us that using 'shame shame' and 'hear hear' was not acceptable, me and adr0 did not speak at all today --- we provided moral support, the yr 9's raced each other up 11 flights of stairs, i am freezing atm, i do not want to do the maths test and i shall stop now.        "having a friend who doesn't talk to you is worse than having an enemy who hates your guts..."

        weird day today . spent most of recess running around. handed in geo assign and was gonna go talk to podmore about premiers cup. i find out that we have a meeting at lunch about it -.-;;      lunch was spent entiely in B1 figuring stuff out for  premier's cup . we actually made the team! w00t! we were then told that making the team only meant that you were in team A and not team B - but everyone was gonna go anyway since nsg had pulled outta the comp. so everything was fixed. i was in a team, as was everyone else. we were about to leave when podmore gets a call from the nsg co-ordinator saying that they were still entering their team *kiz must be happy bout that* so then we had to scrap team B all together which is really slack. so now we have five people on team A + two yr 9 spectators. its really stupid cos now jono, weller and jack cant come T__T so now it has been confirmed that team A consists of:  me, bibhu, adro, koziol and alastair . the debate is tomorrow and i am grateful that i'm not in the first round --- i can spend some time doing maths... but i won't be at school tomoz...w00t!      we also had english off today cos we were gonna 'prep' for tomoz' debating. i really can't be bothered talking about it but the keywords include: edward davison, sexually connotated converstations, lack of preparation and laughter *when ed  fell off his chair  like 3 times -_-''*      i must leave this blog now as i need to do maths and then do a little bit of debating research -_+

      Damn ye social sciences, why must thou taunt me so? I am so seriously hating history and geography right now. I've just finished my geo assignment and now have to complete a 2 page essay on women's role and attitude changes during and after WWII and it's actually worth  something like 10 percent of something or other.  AAARRGGGHHH!!! Plus and english speech. DOUBLE AAARRGGGHHH!!! Thanks Yi Long for helping me with the geo, you're the best.

        i'm feeling empty  - i'm missing something. *sigh* i'm also feeling regretful for all those life changing mistakes. it's so hard to forget mistakes when they turn your life upside down. once again, i put forward the question, 'why can't we turn back time and correct our mistakes?' year 10 so far has been the most eventful year in terms of life changing mistakes. and i hate it so much... why can't everything stay the same ?   i miss the happy times... on the outside we say that we've forgiven...yet deep down we know that it will never be the same...      ok. enough of going all weird.  celebration! 2000 ppl  have visited our blog in less than a month! yipee! rite...i'll stop that now too...      haven't done much since the last time i blogged. last night we booked a table at  sushi suma  at surry hills but when we left chatswood, the harbour bridge was bloody packed?!?!?! wat the...? so we ended up driving around for ages and eventually ended up at neutral bay and went to some jap restaurant called  ponto-cho . it was really nice ^___^ i had this whole bowl of salmon roe...yum... it was ok price...i was so full afterwards...mm...      *too much h/w for cskool* doesn't the teacher realise that no one will do it?! far out...kevin -- where were you eh?!? grr...
