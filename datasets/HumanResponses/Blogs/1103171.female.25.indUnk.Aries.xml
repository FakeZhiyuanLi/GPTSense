      That crime family on the new NBC TV show Kingpin better be a Mexican family. We've not created a bad name for ourselves for nothing. Why should the Italians get all the good movies and cool shows. Throw my paisans and me a bone!

      How quickly I forgot! I was just reminded of the resolutions I made for the new year. This is supposed to be the year I leave behind my childish, irresponsible self, and become the responsible adult I'd like to be. Thus far, I've done nothing to change. I still don't have enough money to make payments on my bills; I don't have a full-time job; I'm still avoiding looking for a full-time job. Will I ever change?

      I totally skipped the Super Bowl on Sunday and, instead, watched The Forsyte Saga on PBS. Eight hours of beauty.

      For some extremely odd reason I am very much looking forward to the Super Bowl. I've never watched before. I'm not interested in football. I can't name one player from either team. The only reason I know which teams are playing is because of Condoleeza Rice. She was on 'Meet the Press' this past Sunday, and I watched as I was getting ready for work. She predicted a Super Bowl victory for the Raiders over the Bucaneers. I guess I'll be watching this Sunday-until I get bored out of my mind and go to my bedroom.

      I don't claim to know anything. Really, I don't. As far as I'm concerned, I know nothing. But I am always trying to learn. For instance, I'm desperately trying to improve my grammar. I love grammar. I ache for better grammar.   I am also learning how to maintain a site. Blogging is a journey I've ventured into blindly. I've no knowledge of this which I am hoping to do. Sigh.

      So many thoughts are gathered in my mind.   I feel guilty. Guilty that so many of my countrymen have died for me. For me. They died protecting my way of life; my freedom. They died protecting the world. My heart hurts for them and for their families-American and British. My pain will never compare to the pain their fathers, mothers, sons, and daughters are suffering, but I hope that knowing the nation mourns with them, and that we're fiercely proud of them brings them some tiny bit of comfort.   It's an odd thing. March Madness is here. The parents of those young men are watching their sons perform on the court, while parents of our troops anxiously await the safe return of their sons and daughters.

      Spring is just around the corner, but it feels like it's already arrived. We're having such a beautiful day in Fort Worth.    I got my hair cut the other day and I've made a list of the many people and characters I resemble:  MAD TV's Mrs. Swan the Jerry Lewis character with the horrbile bangs Topogigio-Europe's equivalent to Mickey Mouse Ramona Quimby

      I received an e-mail from April, my old college roommate. I was so stunned when I checked my inbox and saw her name. My jaw literally dropped.   The year we lived together was such a terrible year. At the time, I only noticed how miserable she was making my life. Her radio alarm going off before the crack of dawn, the radio blaring and not hitting snooze, coming in late at night and smashing soda cans. But the more I think of it, the more I realize that my silence must have been just as terrible for her. Imagine having a roommate who barely says one word to you.   I had her e-mail address; probably still do somewhere. I could have taken the initiative and e-mailed her first, but I didn't.   Odd, that.

      It has been a while!  I've convinced myself that I'm "tweaking" my future blog to be, when, in all honesty, there is yet no new blog. There are ideas, scores of ideas, but there is no money and no outline and no computer literacy of which to speak.  I'm actually only updating to say that I feel very foolish for wanting to watch the new season of 7th Heaven.

      I'm sicker; tremendously sicker. I think my cold reached it's peak Saturday, but today my cold was compounded by lack of sleep.   After work I just felt terrible. I was sleepy, I was in desperate need of emptying my bladder, I had an awful headache and I was hungry. But I've since used the restroom, taken a couple of Tylenol Sinus, put some food in my stomach and added some caffeine to my system. Except for a stuffy nose and and a tickle in my throat, I'm feeling better.    Saturday, despite my head cold, I took my first drive into Bedford. Yeah, Bedford. I've driven to Austin a couple of times only because I didn't have a choice. Other than that, I've managed to drive only on Fort Worth and rural roads. I'm an absolute coward when it comes to driving on busy roads, especially roads I'm not familiar with. But Sandy wanted to go to the Half-Price book store in Bedford and I acquiesced to her supplications. We left from Fort Worth at about nine in the morning and were on our way back from Bedford at about 11 A.M or so. I purchased   Harriet     the     Spy   by Louise Fitzhugh,   The     Collected     Stories     of     Eudora Welty   and   England  ,   England   by Julian Barnes.  For lunch we stopped at Tortas el Tunero which had been given a great review by FW Weekly. I had a torta de aguacte. It was very good, but it would have tasted just slightly better if it had quesro asadero. Sandy had posole. She said the meat was a bit fatty, but it was good overall.     I've stopped reading M.R. James for the time being and have picked up   The     Heart     of     a     Witch   by Judith Hawkes.

      I'm sick and getting sicker by the minute. Last night my breath felt hot-never a good sign. This morning I woke up with a semi-sore throat, a sinus headache and major sinus pressure. Before heading to work, I stopped at Albertson's and bought myself a large bottle of Rexall vitamin C, Tylenol Sinus and a chocolate muffin.   I've avoided getting a flu shot because I rarely get sick, but now that I'm working at an elementary school library, I think there'll be a better chance for illness. I'm considering getting a flu shot. Only considering.   Sandy and I are are supposed to see a performance of   Hiawatha   tomorrow, but if I feel this bad and if I'm still sniffling, we'll have to postpone our plans.

      I managed to avoid mosquito bites all summer long, but now my hands and arms are completely covered with pink bumps. It started last week when Sandy and I did some yard work. Then yesterday, as I was going through my tubs and tubs of books in the shed-yes, that's where I must keep my books, I was the recipient of about five more bites. I rubbed some alcohol on my hands and the swelling has greatly decreased.   I've been reading  The Collected Ghost Stories  of M. R. James. Will let me borrow that and  The Shipping News  by E. Annie Proulx and  Ethan   Frome  by Edith Wharton after I asked him for autumn reading recommendations.   The stories are scarier than I expected, but it's still slow-going. I hope to finish the book by the end of the week.   A few weeks ago Will asked me to choose three authors whose complete works I would take with me were I ever marooned on a deserted tropical island. After much pondering, I chose Shakespeare, James Fenimore Cooper and Dostoevksy. I considered John Steinbeck and Charles Dickens, and after making my choices I regretted not choosing A.W. Tozer. Will chose Shakespeare, Joseph Conrad and Herman Melville.

      Friday night Sandy and I had dinner at Lotus Chinese Restaurant. It was much better than I had expected. After dinner we headed to the movies to watch School of Rock. Not as funny as I thought it'd be, but funny nevertheless. My only complaint came at the end of the movie when all the kids in band had a solo, except for the bassist. What was up with that? She was awesome. She wore cool like an old pair of comfortable jeans. I'm not ashamed to confess that she, at eleven years of age, is way cooler than I was at that age, is way cooler than I am now, and much cooler than I ever will be. I'd totally hang with her.  Ira, Sandy and I went to the state fair on Saturday. I was so looking forward to eating a fried twinkie, but,  much to my chagrin, we never found a fried twinkie stand. I did, however, eat a scant bit of Ira's turkey leg, a couple of bites of Sandy's fried cheesecake (so, so good), a few bites of corn on the cob before tossing it into the closest waste basket, a tad of Ira's funnel cake, two sodas and a whole corny dog. I believe that about covers it.  On Sunday I just lolled about. I read for a small time and then watched Road to Bali with Sandy.  Yesterday Sandy and I ate at Crescent City Beignet for lunch. Both the gumbo and beignets were satisfactory. Granted, I'm no beignet connossieur, but these beignets were mere shadows compared to the fluffy goodness I tasted in New Orleans. These beignets looked like an overly tanned woman with skin like leather. The beignets in New Orleans, on the other hand, were like little children with beautiful golden, sun-kissed skin.   I'll probably lazy around some more today. I do have to make an appointment for Lily, our (I suppose I can call her ours) outdoor cat. If she's in good health, she'll be joining our small army of indoor cats. Oh, goodness. We are slowly, but surely, turning into those old women you find dead in their homes with an infestation of cats.

      Saturday night Sandy and I saw Love Actually. I used the public restroom prior to the movie. As usual, I used the stall without any toilet paper. I found this out after I did my duty and reached my hand into the toilet dispenser. Was I in a pickle! I mulled over my options. I could pull up my pants, luckily I'd only gone number one, and hobble to a stall which contained t.p- but that would defeat the whole purpose of using toilet paper; I could ask my neighbor in the stall next to me to hand over a wad of toilet paper-but that was too embarrassing; or I could use the mitten in my coat pocket and kiss the mittens (figuratively speaking) bye-bye.   Next time I'm out shopping, I must remember to buy a new pair of mittens.

      Will wants to start a book club and he's asked me to join.  He wants the club to be involved in the community; he suggested volunteering at a soup kitchen, cleaning up on Earth Day, and picketing at Republican events. Will assumes that because I'm a woman, and a woman of color at that, I'm a Democrat. Mmmmmm, 'fraid not.  Speaking of books, the Fort Worth Public Library had its annual book sale this weekend. I purchased:  When All the World Was Young- Ferrol Sams Jakob Von Gunten- Robert Walser A Confederacy of Dunce- John Kennedy Toole The Baron in the Trees- Italo Calvino Room Temperature- Nicholson Baker Notable American Women- Ben Marcus The Debt to Pleasure- John Lanchester The House on Coliseum Street- Shirley Ann Grau Follow Your Heart- Susanna Tamaro Maynard's House- Herman Raucher To Sir, With Love- E.R. Braithwaite The Confessions of Nat Turner- William Styron The Gate of Angels- Penelope Fitzgerald The Everlasting Story of Nory- Nicholson Baker Confederate Jasmine and the Fat Tuesday Tree- Ann Lewis   I finished Book 2, The Seeing Stone, in the Spiderwick Chronicles and Ex Libris by Anne Fadiman.  I'm wondering if I should make this blog an exclusively book blog?

      I'm going to talk about books, but I'm not going to italicize the titles because I'm a dunce. In my previous post, in which I wrote about books, I attempted to italicize, but I failed.  I am currently reading Shelf Life edited by Gary Paulsen. I'm still working on the Collected Ghost Stories of M.R. James.  I've several books checked out from the library: The Cheese Monkeys by Chip Kidd; Tam Lin by Pamela Dean; The Spiderwick Chronicles Book 2: The Seeing Stone; Bellocq's Women by Peter Everett; and by John Bellairs: The Treasure of Alpheus Winterborn, The Vengeance of the Witch-Finder, The Lamp from the Warlock's Tomb, The Mansion in the Mist and The Dark Secret of Weatherend.

      On the health front, I'm not completely well. I still have remnants of a cold. At night, when I lie down, my nose stuffs up making it difficult to breathe except through my mouth. My chest is ripe with phlegm, which occasionally makes its way up into my nose.    Today I bought a few books at the thrift store. At Artman's Attic on White Settlement Rd, I purchased a pair of bookends, a cute desk lamp and a musical Lucy Van Pelt mug for Sandy. Ira, Sandy and I stopped at El Tunero for lunch. The enchiladas potosinas made me a tad ill. I'm not sure what caused it, but I had a desire to vomit. I came home and napped for five hours.

      I watched  The   Ring  Sunday night and was surprised at how unbelievably not scary this movie was.   I'm the queen mother of all scaredy cats. After watching a scary movie I will look under my bed, check the closets, put away knives, scissors, compasses-anything that has the capacity to cut, slash, maim or kill. I have slept with my closet light on.   After much dillydallying-I was home alone-I decided to play the movie. All the hype about it being the scariest movie EVER had me freaked. I was setting up the dvd and my fingers were literally shaking. I must admit, however, that the first scene made me to turn off the dvd. I was, like, perhaps I'll watch it in the morning, in the company of others. But I put the kibosh on my fear long enough to resume watching.     The video itself (the video within the movie) was somewhat repugnant. Not gross, just repugnant. It made me want to vomit the way Pearl Jam's Vitalogy CD booklet made me want to vomit. The woman in the mirror, the cord pulled from the mouth, the fly.   The scene right before Noah died, now that was spin-chilling. You know, the scene in which Samara climbs out from the well and walks toward the television. Her jerky movements, more than anything, were eerie.   Let me see if I understood. Because the blonde woman made a copy of the tape, she became invulnerable to the tape's "curse." So did her falling into the well and recovering Samara's body not alter anything? Why did Tom Morgan kill himself? Tom Morgan knew that making a copy of the tape would save you, right? Why didn't Aidan tell his mom Samara was evil in the first place? She was evil, wasn't she? Who filmed the tape? If the blonde woman was safe after making a copy, why'd she cough up the cord? Was she just experiencing aftereffects?

      Earlier I was sitting at the computer eating chocolates from a Whitman's Sampler gold tin.  It was my Christmas gift from Ms. H-.   Ms. M- gave me a gift certificate to Borders.   I gave both ladies gift certificates to Panera.     I had orange peel chicken from The Big Bowl Asian Kitchen last night. It was, among other things, a gift to myself. BBAK was, I believe, voted best Thai place two years in a row. Eh. *Shrug of shoulders* The orange peel chicken wasn't great-the chicken pieces were gristly-but I really liked the fiery chicken wantons. Ira had the curry coconut chicken, which, because of the coconut, was better than China Jade's curry chicken. I wasn't too impressed. I guess I'm just not partial to curry. Shahi tells me, though, that the flavor of curry in Indian foods is better tasting.

      I went to my first official company Christmas party last night. True, each year the pharmacy has a very small (five people at most?) gathering called a Christmas party, but it's not the same.   Last night's party was held in the cafeteria and then the partyers were meeting at Billy Miner's downtown. I didn't go to Billy Miner's. Thus, no hangover of which to speak.  It was okay.   On the excitement front, I have joined a bookclub. It's a newly-formed club with only three members-myself included. Our first selection is   Persuasion   by Jane Austen.

      Wembers is doing much better.   We visited her on the 5th while she was still at the vet's (she had to stay over night). She looked terrible. Her eyes were covered in goo, her tongue was sticking out, she cowered when she saw us. We brought her home on the 6th and it was obvious she was still in a lot of pain. She's gradually getting better. She's playing in the kitchen right now. I can hear her sliding about with her new toy that resembles a plastic ring from a milk or water gallon.   We think Lily is probably pregnant. I don't think the little black kitten is, yet, but Spike was trying to mount her yesterday. She was fighting him, but he was adamant. I had to kick him out of the garage. Aie, aie, aie.    In regards to our reading group: I'd been wanting to ask Debby from K. if she wanted to join our reading group. She's always reading something. I finally worked up the courage to ask her yesterday. I saw her clock out for a break and after a few minutes I followed her into the breakroom. She was thrilled. She's very enthused. We were supposed to meet tomorrow, but since I work the evening we had to reschedule for next Tuesday. I get to select our next read.   At the library today, Cynthia sent her student, Kendra,  to get a book on Mercury. I sent Kendra back empty-handed. Cynthia had already checked out all our Mercury books. So Cynthia sent Kendra back and she said to me, "she says anything but Uranus is okay." I started to giggle when I saw how embarassed Kendra looked.   Later on a father came in with his little boy. He (the father) asked me if I had any books on pet fish-I didn't. He said he had fish, but they wouldn't reproduce and he was curious to know why they weren't.  I sure had no idea. I made the suggestion that maybe they were all male. He said, "maybe...or maybe they're gay fish." Apparently I blushed because he asked me why I was getting red. Then he said that if they didn't reproduce he'd wait until they grew at least ten inches and he'd invite me over for a fish fry. But then he decided he'd like fish soup better, and, humoring him, I said, "yeah, fish soup may be best. The flavor of the fish may stretch further in a broth." He agreed.

      Dear sweet Wemberly was spayed today. She came of age Thursday night. Naturally we didn't know what was happening to her. She wouldn't set her butt down, so we thought it was probably in pain. We assumed she'd developed crystals, and that night we called her vet to make an appointment. We considered taking her in as an emergency case, but it would have cost an extra $75.00 that we didn't have.   Ira took her in the next day and the vet told her Wembs was in heat.   I dropped her off at 7 A.M today. The veterinary technician explained the risks of anesthesia and I  had to sign several release forms.  Then I had to tell them how much I wantd them to do for Wembs in case she "started going." Obviously I wanted them to do everything in their power to save her, but Lord knows I couldn't afford the $1000.00 intervention. I felt terrible that I opted for the $150.00 intervention, but that's all I could afford. The tech gave me brief details on each intervention method. She said in the grand intervention, she'd be opened up and her heart would be massaged. This is the point at which I started to cry. I imagined unconscious little Wemberly's chest opened up and her lifeless heart in the vet's hands. The poor tech must have many pet owners react this way because before she flipped to the intervention page she said, "Now I'm not showing this to you to upset you." Bless her heart. She got teary-eyed when I started crying.

      In 2002 I used to have an online journal elsewhere. I recently came across the site and was surprised to find my entires still available.    2002-10-20 - 4:20 p.m.  Last night was amazing! Ira, Sandy and I decided to see Billy Graham preach at Texas Stadium. My main reason for going was to see Jars of Clay, but then the enormity of Billy Graham himself struck me. He is the most important evangelist of the century. I may never get the opportunity to see/hear Dr. Graham preach again. He is the greatest example of a 'man of God'.   Getting to the stadium was almost impossible. We missed the exit-twice. When we finally got in, the amount of people was overwhelming. I believe the stadium holds 70,000 or so people & it was filled to capacity. On top of that, there were 12,000 people outside the stadium watching the event from big-screen tv's. The concerts were truly truly great. Jars of Clay rocked-naturally. dcTalk was unbelievable! Kirk Franklin was phenomenal! I'd never been to a Christian concert of any kind, so it was such an awesome experience: listening to great music, surrounded by thousands of worshippers in an atmosphere of togetherness. Then Dr. Graham spoke and he was so encouraging, uplifting and humble. Traits not too common in many evangelists. Finally, the call was made to those who wanted to committ their lives to Christ. Two young boys from the area where I was seated got up to answer that call and I freely cried tears of joy. I wanted to hug them & say, "please, please go. You will never regret this." You could feel the joy and the love that permeated the stadium. You cannot question or doubt something as exhilirating as this. Currently reading: Crossing the Line-William Finnegan.  2002-11-05 - 6:28 p.m.  I've been angry with God. Mainly over childish reasons, but important enough to make me hostile towards Him. It all has to do with men and women and society and marriage and physical beauty and unfaithfulness. For the last couple of weeks or so, I've been trying to phase God out of my life. In reality, I'm trying to keep him at bay. I'm wanting to not need Him-if that makes any sense. I'm realizing it's impossible. I need Him & I honestly WANT to need him, but I'm so angry with Him. You know how it is when you're mad at someone you love. It fills you with power, control over the relationship. Things will be done on my terms! And, I have to admit, I enjoy wallowing in my self-pity. Childish, I know, I know.   And right now I truly hate men. Not physically or romantically, but mentally, emotionally, spiritually. I'm trying to remove my like for men from my life. No, this doesn't mean that I want to replace men with women-nothing of the sort. I just don't want to be emotionally attached to a man. More specifically, to one who could very well hurt me. I don't ever in my life want to be in love with another man. I want to go the rest of my life content with myself, with who I am and with my own belongings. Does this make sense? Tell me, why would I want to marry? After 10 years of marriage, my husband will find me old and used up only to toss me away for a younger, bustier, tall blonde. Where will that leave me? Alone, bitter, fat and affected by gravity. Let me just get it over with now.   2002-11-06 - 5:54 p.m.  Why am I so afraid to look for a new job? -I'm afraid I won't be good enough. -I'm afraid I'll not learn to do the job requirements; therefore, causing me to get the boot. -I'm uncomfortable meeting new people. -I'm uncomfortable around people of authority.  Why do I need a new job? -Not enough hours at my current job. -Bills, Bills, Bills, Bills. -College. -Forthcoming travel!!  I best get off my butt and away from this computer to search for potential employment in the newspaper.    2002-11-09 - 12:17 a.m.  I hurt my back a couple of nights ago. It's a real bummer. Sandy, Lou and I had gone to Half-Price- I bought a dumb old book whose title I won't even mention....ok, ok, it was BSC SS#14, I liked SS#15 so much (boy did I ever learn about London & Paris-don't you dare call me a stupid American) that I decided to buy another one; next, we stopped to get some Christmas lights and finally, we decided to stop at McDonald's. We drove through the drive-thru, paid, grabbed dinner and left. But those turds absolutely forgot to put my Big-Mac in the sack. I naturally had to turn around and get my Big-Mac. I jumped out of the car and ran towards McDonald's, throwing my back out in the process. How pathetic? I hurt my back RUNNING. RUNNING!! Good grief am I out of shape or what?   Sandy and I went to the Fort Worth Library book sale today. I'd so been looking forward to this for the last month. Fruitless. Perfectly fruitless. I left with 2 books. This was a totally fruitless entry.  2002-11-16 - 6:41 p.m.  I am the moodiest person I've ever known. Really I am. I was upset earlier because Lou asked me, at the last minute, to go with him to Austin to pick up his car. Why didn't he ask me last night? We could have left by 8 A.M. and been back in Fort Worth by 2 P.M. Instead, I spent my whole day driving to and fro. As we drove past beautiful downtown FTW, I decided it was childish of me to be upset, so I started some small talk and everything was fine. Everything was perfectly fine. When we finally arrived home no one was in and that, for some reason, upset me again. I left to pick up my pay check and a prescription from the pharmacy. When I got back Ira and Sandy had gotten home. Here's where I became angry. Why? Was it because they'd gotten themselves something to eat and had forgotten about me? Was it because I was the one sent to Austin with Lou? I honestly don't know. As soon as I turned on the computer and began typing my anger subsided completely. Now I just feel foolish. Weird.   Yesterday, Sandy, Lou and I saw Harry Potter. I enjoyed it. I absolutely enjoyed it. I'm going to see it again on Tuesday with B.B. and Angie-O.    I wish I were British. I wish I attended fine English schools. I wish I had a British accent. Funny how even an imbecile with a British accent sounds refined and educated.  2002-11-26 - 5:28 p.m.  Last Tuesday Angie-O, B.B., and I went to Black-Eyed Pea for lunch (this suited me perfectly since I was short on cash and a bowl of brocoli-cheese soup at the Pea costs $3.19). We were eating our complimentary bread and butter when Angie-O suddenly gasped in horror and pointed at her plate. Lying on her plate was the tiniest metal nut (or bolt). Realizing a small commotion was about to ensue, I tried calming her down. "Oh, it's so little. It couldn't have hurt you. It's fortunate you found it when you did." I looked to B. for some support, but he merely raised an eyebrow and continued eating his bread. Angie-O hailed the waiter and asked to speak to his manager.    Manager-What can I do for you?  Angie-O-Let me see your hand.  The bewildered manager slowly stretched out his hand palm-side up.  Angie-O-This. Was. In. My. Bread.  Manager-It looks like it might be from a pair of glasses.  Angie-O's hand shot up towards her glasses.  Angie-O-Not mine!!  Manager- I'm sorry about this. I'll tell the kitchen staff to be more careful.  Minutes later Angie-O and I were talking and eating when the left lens from her glasses fell onto her plate. Aye, aye, aye.   2002-11-29 - 9:20 p.m.  Another Thanksgiving has come and gone. We've arrived upon that time of year when people lose all respect, courtesy, and compassion for their fellow man. Parking spots. Parking spots. Parking spots. Tut. Tut. Tut.   It seems that with each passing year, Thanksgiving loses a bit of its luster. It's not as exciting or fun as it used to be. I'm sure it has to do with my family being separated (geographically). Before, during this time of year, my home used to be crammed full of noisy brothers, sisters, nephews and nieces. Mart, hubby, and their three kids (five now)lived across the street. O, his wife, and three daughters lived a few minutes away, in the same town. MYTMike, his wife and two children lived in a town ten minutes away. Esth and her two kids lived thirty minutes away, but always returned home for Thanksgiving. Good times. Goodt times.   Now it's just the four of us younger, single siblings down here by our lonesome.  2002-12-03 - 6:12 p.m.  I'm having trouble sleeping. Mostly, I do a lot of worrying when I go to bed. I lie in bed thinking about the bills that are piling up; the calls from companies, wanting some form of payment, that I avoid; and my credit history.    When I've finally fallen asleep I'm disturbed by nightmares. I've been having frequent dreams in which tiny, black creatures enter my bedroom. They're curious to see what I look like, so they approach my bed and stare at me. They desire to hurt me, but they can't-they're not allowed. These creatures peer at me, and occasionally, they'll pull back the cover that's shielding my face. The most frightening part is not knowing if the creature has left or if it's still standing at my bedside. So, I slowly open my eyes, but instead of seeing darkness and emptiness, I see a small creature inches from my face, staring back at me. I can't describe how real the fear I feel is. Two nights ago, while having one of these dreams, I was awakened by my screams. I recall seeing the creature open my window and slide into my room. I couldn't contain my fear as it slowly approached my bed and I screamed.    I'm curious to know what these dreams symbolize. I'm not a mystic, nor am I a New-Ager, but I do believe dreams hold some sort of meaning. I'm certain that the dreams and my stress are connected.   I'm trying to stay up as late as I can to either 1)avoid sleeping altogether or 2)get so sleepy that I fall asleep as soon as I hit the pillow. So I've been doing a bit of reading and much T.V viewing. I've discovered that I love British comedy.  2002-12-10 - 7:43 p.m.  I'm finally able to sleep in peace. No more black creatures invading my slumber.    I gave away my burden. Someone once said God wants us to give Him our anxieties, our burdens, our worries. He wants nothing else but to carry them for us. So, I handed them to Him and He took them from me.   Psalm 3:5 I lie down and sleep; I wake again, because the Lord sustains me

      Ira is now talking to Sandy, but she's still not talking to me. I confess, however, that I'm rather enjoying her silence. It's growing on me. And if her not speaking to me means she won't yell at me, I'm okay with that.

      I bought a bookshelf today. I enjoy the finer things in life, so, naturally, I purchased a Wal-Mart shelf. Ikea? Pfft.  Sandy and I put the contraption together. Once we were able to distinguish shelf C from shelf G, from shelf F, putting it together was a breeze.  My books, most of them, finally have a home. I just pray that the silly thing not tip over.

      Ira and I are not speaking to each other.&nbsp;   Ira and&nbsp;Rubius&nbsp;&nbsp;are not a couple. They're not dating; they're friends.&nbsp;Rubius wants to be more than friends, but Ira doesn't really know what she wants. She hasn't figured it out yet. There have been several times when she's come home and exclaimed that Rubius is not for her. I've met him a couple of times and I don't feel comfortable around him. I'm not entirely convinced that dating him is a good idea either. She's asked me how I feel about him, and I've been truthful. One of our first fights&nbsp;about Rubius had to&nbsp;do with my discomfort. She became angry and accused me of hating him. At the time,&nbsp;I didn't know him enough to feel anything but discomfort. We've gotten into several fights since then-each fight about him. I told her a couple of weeks ago that, in the end, what I think really doesn't matter. She should do what she wants to do regardless of my feelings for him.   Every year Sandy and I take her out to dinner for her birthday. This Tuesday, on our way to work, she asked me if she could invite him to dinner. I told her I'd feel uncomfortable. She became angry and she hasn't spoken to me since.   She's gone out with him tonight.   I've had five days to think about my feelings for&nbsp;Rubius and I can honestly say that now I definitely don't like him. He's being childish. Every fight we've had in the past year has been about him. She gets angry at me for being honest. Rubius&nbsp;tells Ira that Sandy and I both hate him. Fine, say that about me, but how can he possibly say that about Sandy. Sandy has been nothing but nice to him. The man is a baby.

      Tonight was a good night. Driving home, I felt so alive and so content and so very, very tiny. Why is life just a small flicker?  -We had our book meeting tonight. We met at Sardine's. Ira didn't show-that's a long story, which I'll expound on later. We ate calamari and garlic bread. We talked about  Persuasion ,  The   Thief   Lord , and  The   Secret   Garden . Debby chose this month's book. We're going to read Rohinton Mistry's  A    Fine   Balance . I don't like that it's an Oprah book, but I must read it. We left Sardine's at seven and Debby and I went to Starbucks to chat for two hours.    -I'm currently reading  The   Tale   of   Desperaux  by Kate DiCamillo. It's, so far, an absolutely adorable book. I began reading it last night and I had to wake up Sandy to tell her how much I loved it.

      I'm having problems of the stomachal kind. Perhaps it's the wine I've been drinking. Maybe it's the two fudgesicles I ate last night. I don't know, but my belly has been churning and gurgling. Yes, gurgling. I won't go into details.  Valentine's night. Woe is me. Must I recount the very sad and lonely manner in which I spent the most holy of nights? Actually I was surprisingly satisfied with my evening. I don't think I've ever been dissatisfied with any of my Valentine's days because I don't give all that much importance to them. I mean if I had someone to spend the day with, then, yes, I'd be gung-ho about it, but I don't and it doesn't bother me. It honestly doesn't bother me.  We had a beautiful snowfall over night, which made the morning very wonderful. Unfortunately I had to work, so I enjoyed the small bit of winter for a couple of hours and then headed to work. Work was rather pleasant. Shahida and I had really great conversation. I told her about eating at Asia Bowl & Grill-not to be confused with Big Bowl. (We ate at Asia Bowl Friday night and it was very good. I had the tom yum soup. I didn't find it as delicious as Bangkok City's tom yum soup, but it was still immensely delightful. Shahida decided she and her hubby would go there for Valentine's night.) By the time I got home most of the snow had melted and what remained had been trampled on by the neighborhood children. That night we watched a couple of movies and drank some wine. Shahida suggested I buy a bottle of her favorite wine-an inexpensive peach Chardonnay. I did and I enjoyed it thoroughly. Shahida called me Sunday morning to tell me she and the hubby really liked Asia Bowl and will definitely go back.   There's a chilled bottle of peach Chardonnay in the fridge with my name on it. I'm going to pour myself a bit and settle down to watch Diane Sawyer and Mel Gibson.

      I finished the book a couple of nights ago.  I was intrigued by the end of the first chapter, which wasn't very long. The story was very satisfying. My thought, after finishing the book, was this is what a book should be like.  Bye Prop and Bo.  I'm currently reading  From   the   Dust   Returned  by Ray Bradbury.

      I am a champion procrastinator, I'll have you know.  I considered updating several times, but several times I felt not quite up to it.  -Ira, Sandy and I tried Celaborelle a few weeks ago. I was surprised by how wonderful the food was. I really enjoyed the Farejh-baked chicken. It's been so long since I've been that I don't remember the correct spelling of the word. Unfortunately the building was freezing, so, as much as I liked the food, I couldn't entirely enjoy it because of the chattering of my teeth and chill in my bones.  -I've been to Merryland about five times within the last two months. The first time I tried their food, several months ago, I was disappointed. The FWWeekly had given it such a great review. In all fairness it was late in the evening, so I can understand that the food wasn't at fresh as it could have been. But since then, all visits have been pleasant. I'm a fan of the veggie lo mein.  -Cynthia and I went to Applebee's Thursday night and I had the honey bbq boneless bufallo wings and the apple chimicheesecake. Both heavenly.   -The father I spoke of in my last post, the man who invited me to his house for fish soup, asked me to be his girlfriend. He disguised the question as a joke, but I know he was serious. I've been trying to avoid him. He's a married man, by the way.  -I finally saw  The   Return   of    the   King . Throughout the movie someone behind us farted continuously-a total of five times.  The third one was especially rancid. The smell wafted over to our area and just lingered in the air like a hovering aircraft. Ok, I can completely understand accidentally allowing one to slip, that's permissable, but a whole machine gun full?!? That's just being plain rude and disgusting.  -Our reading group met for the second time at Los Vaqueros. Ira was absent, but Debby attended. I chose  The   Secret   Garden  and  The   Thief   Lord . We'll discuss those along with  Persuasion  on the 19th of this month. I think we'll be meeting at Sardine's on University.

      We had our book group meeting on Thursday at the 7th Street Cafe. This time Anna G. joined us. She is so much fun and so very funny. Our meeting lasted about three hours and we talked about our book,  A   Fine   Balance ,  for a total of about ten minutes. We talked of work, books, husbands & wives, Asian relatives, cats, England, and the Philippines. Our book for the month of April, or would it be the month of March, is  Frankenstein  by Mary Shelley.  I read  Confederate   Jasmine   and   the   Fat   Tuesday   Tree  by Ann Lewis and love, love, loved it. That put me in the mood for some southern fiction, so I checked out  Absalom,   Absalom!  from the library. I haven't gotten around to reading it because later I checked out  Midnight   Bayou  by Nora Roberts and read that. I ought to be ashamed, but I'm not, really. The members at chicklit made me realize it's okay to enjoy this kind of book. I accept it. I haven't read romance since I was in high school. I think I owe myself a bit of escapist lit.

      Little Satch passed away yesterday.  Sandy found him lying in the middle of his cage, cold.   We buried him under the blossoming pear tree. Before we covered his grave, I placed a pear blossom on his cardboard casket.

      I just finished reading  First   Love   and   Other   Sorrows  by Harold Brodkey. It's a book of short stories. I loved the first three stories and fell in love with the boy character. I thought that if I ever found out his name, I'd name my son after him, but we're never told his name. However, in another story there's a grown man by the name of Elgin Smith, who sounds like he could be the little boy in the previous stories. I'm hoping that it's not him and that his name is not Elgin. Elgin? It reminds me of the Chicago suburb: dingy, drab, and dirty.  I attempted to read  A   Room   With   a   View , but I gave up. I was on chapter four when I called it quits. So I set that aside and picked up  Mantissa  by John Fowles. I don't know that I enjoyed the story much, but I really like his writing style. It's simple, but it's engrossing.

      The little boy I fell utterly in love with in kindergarten turns twenty-five today. I loved him well into my senior year in high school. This was long after he'd moved away our sixth grade year. This was long after I'd moved away my sophmore year in high school. Once in a while, when I remember him, I wonder what's become of him.

      I finished reading Alice Hoffman's  Here   on   Earth . This brings the number of Oprah books I've read to two. Actually, I've read three. I read  Cry,   the   Beloved   Country  about three or four years ago, long before it was an Oprah book.   I was surprised by how mediocre a book it was. Compared to  A   Fine   Balance ,  Here   on   Earth  was dull. Maybe I shouldn't compare the two, though.   I thought the characters were completely unsympathetic. I found myself hoping March would get her comeuppance. I didn't realize this was a story about domestic abuse until signs of abuse began occurring. But even then I didn't feel empathy, or sympathy, for March.

       &#8226; Ms. Roberts from work, who apparently knows a thing or two about cars, says she can fix the problem with my car door. She says she just has to remove the paneling (panel?) from inside the door and pull on the lock wire. I'm paraphrasing.   &#8226; Ms. M is having an author visit at school tomorrow. He's author Joe Hays from New Mexico. I'd like to be there to get autographed copies of a couple of his books, but since there isn't any money to spare, I guess I'll manage.   &#8226; I'm really enjoying my Thursday night outings with Cynthia.    &#8226; I finished  A   Fine   Balance  yesterday morning. I wanted to throw my arms up in frustration when I realized there was going to be, not one, but two more tragic incidents in the lives of the Darjhis before the end. I'm excited to talk about this at our next book group meeting.

      I saw  The   Passion  Thursday night.  It was a very bloody movie, but not any bloodier or more violent than other movies. The nurse at school said, "people may say they're upset about the violence, but it's not the violence that upsets them, it's the message."   I did cry. I cried to see people's faithfulness. I cried when the man helped Jesus carry the cross. Initially he was hesitant to help, but after a while, he carried the cross himself. The cross rested fully on his back. I cried when the woman attempted to give Jesus water. The adulteress, especially, made me cry. I admit, I had always judged her. I felt she'd gotten off easy when Jesus rescued her from her accusers. I felt very ashamed. How often have I abandoned God only to call to Him in my times of trouble. She, on the other hand, was always there. I thought the overhead shot of  Jesus's crucifixion was extraordinary. God's view. And the one lone rain/tear drop.  Friday night I saw  Starsky   and   Hutch . It really wasn't a great movie, but it was a funny movie. Owen Wilson exasperates me, but I can't help but love him.    My car has gone positively mad. The lock on the driver's side door is stuck. It's locked and I can't get it unlocked. I have to enter my car through the passenger side. It takes a bit of agility and some confidence-especially in a movie theater parking lot after a movie has ended.

      I suppose Ira is speaking to me now. We went out to eat last night and there was conversation. Slightly tense conversation, but conversation no less. My fortune cookie said I was "honest and straightforward." Ira said, "yes you are." I kept my comments to myself, but I wanted to say to her, "if I were truly honest, you'd know how often I tend to dislike you." Oh, siblings.

      Saturday morning, Sandy, Lou and I headed to Dallas to conquer the Half-Price book warehouse. According to Sandy, a friend of hers once left the warehouse with nine-hundred free books. Nine-hundred! We were really looking forward to free books. We packed three large garbage bags and three tote bags-to carry the ridiculous amount of free books we were to part with. Visions of towering shelves and long aisles danced through my head. We arrived and entered into a small room about the size of a bedroom. The room contained books, but I thought surely this was just a taste of things to come. A friendly woman asked us what sort of literature we were looking for. I said children's lit and fiction. She pointed me to a corner. "There's our children's section, but I'm afraid most of those books have been taken." Two shelves. Their children's section consisted of two shelves, each shelf about two feet in length. Then we rounded a corner and we entered the fiction "area" of the warehouse. Although definitely bigger than the children's section, the fiction section was the size of a walk-in closet. I left the warehouse with eleven books that fit snugly in my arms. I suppose beggars can't be choosers.  As a consolation, we stopped at the Half-Price store in Bedford. Oh my gosh! I go there so rarely that I completely forgot how amazing their clearance section is. I was dizzy with glee. I had about twenty books in my arms and hadn't yet looked through all the clearance shelves. I deposited the books in a basket and went to look for Sandy. I left my basket with Sandy and was on my way back to the clearance section when I saw him. A young man, walking in front of me, holding a couple of books in his hand, which he held at his side. He turned his head ever so slightly as I walked up behind him. Our eyes met for the briefest of moments and he smiled the sweetest, warmest, kindest  smile in all of time. He doesn't know it, but with that smile he gave to me, I gave to him a small but aching bit of my soul. I can't believe how much it hurts.

      Yesterday Cynthia walked into the library with her class and sang 'Happy Belated Birthday.' They gave me two homemade birthday cards, which were terribly sweet. Marcos's birthday message said, 'Happy Birthday Miss Rosas You are the best libarian in the word Miss Rosas.' Shawn's message, on the other hand, was a bit cryptic; it said, 'hi are you syco.' Mmm.  At DHE today Ana C. and I had a wee conversation. That child is labeled Special Ed., and as far as learning is concerned she may be, but she is a quick witted child.  Ana- Miss Rosas, I don't know what I'm going to do.  Me- What you're going to do about what?  (Silence)  Me- About Summer?  Ana- Yes. What am I going to do all Summer?  Me- You can read. Reading is lots of fun.  Ana- [In a horror-stricken voice] Reeeadinnng?!? There ain't nothing better to do come Summer than swimming. And turning on the air conditioner.  Her vocabulary leaves much to be desired, but she makes me laugh. This is the same child who walked into my car. She walked into my car!

      I was so close, so unbelievably close, to purchasing a camera today. I had it all. I had the desire, the willpower, the cash. Unfortunately the model I coveted was completely sold out. I searched at Ridgmar, Hulen, East Chase, North Richland Hills, but there was not a camera to be had.  I left the electronics store with a heavy heart and a downcast demeanor.

      I finished reading  The   Feast   of   All   Saints  a couple of days ago. I don't know how it could have possibly taken me just about two weeks to read it, but it did. I've read two other Anne Rice books, and this one was, surprisingly, unlike them.  Mike and the kids leave tomorrow. Their week, and mine, went a little like this:  Saturday 10th- They arrived in the evening. It took less than a small amount of coercion to convince Mike he wanted Taco Bueno. He loves his Chilada platter.  Sunday 11th- We headed for Waxahachie and Scarborough Faire at 2 P.M. It was a cold, rainy, miserable day. Not a very big crowd. Mike was asked to volunteer twice for two different acts. He had knives thrown at him (along with Sandy) and he yelled "wooga, wooga" at a toy turtle. The award for 'Best Euphemism of the Scarborough Season' went to the man at the camel ride who said to me, "don't you like camels? There's nothing like a warm fuzzy hump on a cold Easter Sunday." Yes. Later that night we were entertained by the Great Zekeini and his assistant Jordin.  Monday 12th- My birthday. I wasn't able to take the day off from work, so Lou was left in charge of tourism duties. He took the family downtown to watch  The   Passion  at The Palace. Mike bought me a cookie cake (my favorite) and tried teaching me Texas Hold 'em. All the different hand combinations confused and frustrated me.  Tuesday 13th- I took the day off from work and went with  Mike and the kids to The Cowgirl Museum. I'd never been and I was afraid they'd find it boring, but they had fun. Zeke and Jordin rode the "bronc" several times. The videos of their rides are on the internet and they had a lot of fun posing for the western movie posters.  I learned that Zeke and Jordin are exceptional actors and they're quite the characters. Then we saw the Dolphins film at the IMAX. We had dinner at Taco Bueno where Mike told us stories about his time as a Taco Bueno employee and resident "hottie"/chick magnet.  Wednesday 14th- Sandy accompanied us to the Stockyards. We were only there a couple of hours before Mike was ready to go. We spent a bit of time at Trinity Park and then I had to leave to meet Debby at Starbucks. She came back from England on the 9th and she had a few souveniors for me-including bookmarks. Sandy and Jordin came along.    Thursday 15th- Since I wasn't allowed any more days off from work and Sandy had to go back to school, Lou, once again, had the responsibility of taking Mike and the kids around. He didn't. When Sandy and I got home we took Zeke and Jordin downtown to the Main St. Arts Festival. We dropped in at the library before closing time. Needless to say Jordin was quite impressed. We then walked around for a while, listening to the music, seeing the different works of art, smelling the scents from the food stalls, before heading for Barnes & Nobles. Zeke left with three books by an author named Andy Griffiths, and Jordin bought a book titled  Zenda  and another book by the author of  Ella   Enchanted .  Friday 16th- Ira took them to Six Flags.

      Mom arrived late last night for a short stay. Mike is coming from Illinois in a few days; he's bringing Zeke and Jordin from North Carolina. I'm responsible for creating an itinerary for their visit. How do you entertain a teen and a pre-teen?    The house is a bit crowded with one extra body. Three additional bodies will be a nightmare to accommodate. But I think it'll be a lot of fun.

      Would it be terribly wrong of me to attend church services at a church I'm not a member of, only to see an extremely handsome man I've never met, whose picture I saw in a newspaper?   I was flipping through my local newspaper when his black and white caught my eye. I was positively mesmerized. I couldn't take my eyes off him. A local church was announcing his appearance and presentation at their location.

       One of Ira's library science classes requires her to read every Newbery Medal Winner. The Medal, as well as Honors, has been awarded every year since 1922. This means Ira will have to read eighty-two books within the next five weeks. I've offered her my services. This isn't, however, a completely selfless gesture. I will really enjoy reading many of those books. I've only read ten of them and I'm looking forward to reading:     Caddie   Woodlawn -Carol Ryrie Brink  Strawberry   Girl -Lois Lenski  Ginger   Pye -Eleanor Estes  The   Midwife's   Apprentice -Karen Cushman  Holes -Louis Sachar   Ok. So Ira doesn't have to read every single Newbery Medal winner, but she does have to read twenty of them. Talk about raining on my parade. I was super psyched. I was gearing up for the challenge. Well, since I will be of no use to her, I've decided to go ahead and attempt to read all 82 books-for my own peace of mind. Yeah, I know, 82 books? What sort of challenge is that? Any feeble-minded dolt can read 82 books. But it's not about speed or time. It's about comprehension and enjoyment. It's about accomplishment.

      We took "Vashti's" kittens to the SPCA yesterday. Three of the kittens hadn't yet reached the required weight, but since they were only a few ounces short they decided to keep them.   I know they're better off there than on the street, but I can't help but wonder what kind of families those kittens will be adopted to.

      We had our book group meeting today and it didn't turn out to be the disaster I'd expected.  Will wasn't able to make it, Ira had to stay late at work, and Julie didn't attend. That left me and Debby. I invited Olga, a counselor from work, to join the group, but I didn't think she'd remember. Well, remember she did. Sandy, although not an official member, joined us for dinner and discussion at King Tut's.  It turns out Debby was reading the wrong book. She read  Tom   Sawyer  instead of  Huck   Finn . And neither Olga nor I finished the book. (I have five chapters to go.)   We did have a great dinner, though, and good conversation.   Our book selection for the month of June is  100   Years   of   Solitude , or as Ira called it  100   Days   of   Cholera . Except for Will, we are such a pathetic book group.

       Colonial   House  ended last night and I have a few more things to say before I drop the subject.  After a group of Native Americans visited the colony, Carolyn Heinz made a comment or two that really bothered me.   (I'm not speaking for any other culture except my own, mind you.)  Paul Hunt, one of the two English cast members, said the tribe's leader kept pointing at him when she spoke about England and their destruction of the Native American tribes. He thought it was unfair that she was trying to make him feel guilty for something he had no part in. Carolyn Heinz then said she thought [white] people needed to feel guilty.   Why? Why should white people feel guilty for things their ancestors did? What does guilt solve? How will guilt improve this world? It won't. Guilt, as proven by Paul, only makes its recipient angry. When will one generation apologizing to another be enough? It never will. This generation wants an apology, so will the one after that, and the one after that and so on. There aren't enough 'I'm sorries' to right wrongs of this magnitude. It will never be enough. So, the best anyone can do is honor those who came before; honor those who lived, fought and died so their people would be free. Honor them and educate people and teach their history. And learn to forgive.  Am I expected to live my life angry and bitter towards the Spaniards who invaded my homeland, raped, pillaged and destroyed? Am I expected to live my life angry at white Americans who invaded my homeland, fought my people against their will and then claimed the land as theirs?   Why? Tell me, what does that solve? It's clearly pointless.   So, white America, this is a message from one of your non-white fellow Americans. It's not necessary for you to feel guilt over past events. Learn from them and that will be enough.

      I was reading yesterday that the children's book  Because   of   Winn   Dixie  by Kate DiCamillo has been made into a movie. The movie, scheduled for a January 14, 2005 theatrical release, stars Jeff Daniels, Cecily Tyson and Dave Matthews. Dave Matthews also worked on a production of  Where   the   Red   Fern   Grows  (another children's book) by Wilson Rawls, but nothing became of that movie due to lack of funds.   Sandy and I were supposed to see a taping of  Life   Today  with guest Kirk Cameron. Sandy was looking forward to it-the whole thing was her idea-but I just didn't feel up to it. I feel bad, but  Colonial   House  takes precedence over Kirk. Give me TiVo and we can avoid this type of situation in the future.  Speaking of   Colonial   House ......I hated to see the Wyers go, but I think it was for the best. Danny Tisdale's departure was, I thought, such a loss for the colony. Besides Jeff, Danny, Mr. Verdecia and John Voorhees were the only responsible men on the colony. Luckily, oh luckily, Mr. Lecza has come along to straighten out the community. And Jonathon Allen, what a talent! I was disappointed that we didn't get to see the entire play.

      I knew that if I stayed in Texas long enough my allergies, which currently only flair up with dust and cat dander, would eventually become a daily occurrence. I think it's been long enough.   I've been sneezing all day and now I have a dull ache on the left side of my abdomen. My nose is runny and my nasal passages are sore from extreme inhaling. My eyes feel agonizingly tired; I'm really tempted to pluck my eyeballs out with my fingers.   These allergy symptoms are a menace to my sanity.

       Colonial   House  hasn't disappointed. I wasn't sure how entertaining it was going to be, but I was hoping I'd enjoy it and I am.   That Voorhees woman, however, is annoying the holy crap out of me. I'm, like, woman, shut your piehole! I'm sick and tired of your flapping gums!   Bethany Wyers is the epitome of 'cute as a button.' She's precious. I'm surprised she returned after her fiance's death.   The one thing I like about the   House  series is that the cast are always an intelligent group of people.

      My computer was acting screwy. That's all I can say. Really, that's all I know. Being the infinitely computer illiterate person that I am, I only know that the computer lost all its memory. How did this occur? Search me. How was the problem fixed? Heck if I know. All I know is that things are up and running.   The following is a list of thoughts I had and things I did while away from the comp:  Greyhound bus stations are designed in such a way that make you want to kill yourself. They are the most depressing, drab and gloomy places-ever. I really believe that the designers had one purpose in mind. They wanted to make their customers feel really bad about themselves. I was sitting in the waiting area-dim vending machines, gray bathrooms, dirty lockers, homeless folk-waiting for my brother's bus to arrive from Illinois, and I'm thinking, 'oh my gosh, I'm worthless! I can't afford a plane ticket. I'm America's lowest of the low. I deserve to die.' Am I just a kook?  Debby and I went to the Kimball to see "Turner and Venice." It was really quite nice. Then we went to the Herb Festival at the Botanic Garden. Debby and I have known each other for a couple of years, but until a few months ago we'd never exchanged words. I'm surprised by how at ease I feel with her. Warming up to people quickly is very unlike me.   After my outing with Debby, Ira and I went to Dallas to take Lily and her kittens to the SPCA. That was so unbelievably hard to do. I was crying even before we left. I was so desperate to give Lily and her kittens a home that I wrote to Ellen DeGeneres to ask her for help. I am a kook! We also took "Vashti's" kittens, but we were told they were too little to be taken care of by the SPCA. We were told that if we didn't take them home with us for at least a couple of weeks, they'd be euthanized. In addition to our small army of cats-four, we have five kittens living in a spare room. Next weekend we'll be delivering them to the SPCA.  Last night, Lou, Sandy and I went to Rave and saw 'Shrek 2'. It is, I think, better than the first. Part 2 has a lot more blatant humor. And, oh my gosh, Puss-n-boots stole the show. The audience-parents, children, teens, young adults-were smitten. Those eyes, those such cat-like eyes! The second time he looked up with those eyes, everyone applauded.

      Well, hello, Blogger! Aren't you a new site. Blogger is a whole new world. It's so easy, thus far, that even an inexperienced blogger such as myself can change her template with a press of a button.   I am a tad upset. I've been looking forward to this day for the last several months. I was under the impression that  Colonial   House  was premiering tonight. I was super hyped, I was pumped, I was excited. I checked my local listings only to discover that it doesn't air tonight, but on the 17th. It's okay, I suppose. At least I get a chance to watch  Office   Space .  Speaking of tonight, the Preservation Hall Jazz Band is performing at the Bass tonight. I wish I could be there, but instead I'm home waiting for a television show that isn't even going to be on. Again, it's okay. This gives me another reason to go to New Orleans this Summer-to watch the Preservation Hall Jazz Band perform at Preservation Hall.  I found a new blog that I enjoy; Lopie's Journal. I found it via Loobylu. And once I figure out how to link to these sites, I'll do it. What makes one site enjoyable and another one not?

      We went out looking for a Vietnamese restaurant on Alta Mesa that I'd read about in FWWeekly. We didn't find it, so we thought of going to a Thai place Shahi had told me about. I tried calling her, but couldn't reach her and we ended up at a Chinese restaurant called Hunan something or other off of 820. Ick! I don't trust Chinese buffets much; they're questionable.  After lunch, we stopped at a shop and I bought myself a pair of sandals and a t-shirt. The t-shirt is to help me jumpstart my workout at Trinity Park. The sandals were too comfortable and too casual (my preference) to pass up. My big cartoon toes will undoubtedly scare the masses, but hey, if my feet are cool, what do I care. Turn away, people, merely turn away.

      I was working 12-hour days last week, so I had very little time to do anything. I did manage, however, to buy the items I needed for Cynthia's "I appreciate you' basket. I bought a white ceramic bowl with the word 'popcorn' on it. At Hobby Lobby I bought cellophane, ribbon, and movie theater themed stickers. On Thursday night I went to Wal-Mart once to buy a gift tag, then I went back to buy the candy and tissue paper I forgot to buy the first time. The basket turned out pretty well. The cellophane ended up a bit wrinkled, but Cynthia really liked it.   Last night Sandy, Ira and I were supposed to go out to dinner, but Ira forgot she had a date with Kim, so she cancelled on us. Sandy and I went out anyway. We had thought of trying a Vietnamese place on Alta Mesa, but chose Pei Wei, instead. We started off with spring rolls and crab wantons. The dipping sauce for both was wonderfully spicy. After the spiciness of the sauces, I found my pad thai bland.  We stopped at a bookstore and then went to Coneheads, which is owned by a former manager of mine. We went through the drive thru window, and while our order was being prepared, I decided to straighten out my car. And as I was reversing, I hit a post. Who in their right mind would put a post in a drive thru lane? Luckily the rubber bumper cushioned the hit.   We ended the night with a movie at Rave.

      Today Cynthia and I went to the home of a co-worker who'd invited the entire faculty and staff over for a  cookout. I expected very few people to attend because of the cold front that moved in over night. I'd say there were probably thirty people total; not bad at all. Had it been just five degrees warmer, it would have been great. But the food was awesome. I took cheesecake and Cynthia took a bouquet of flowers.    After the cookout we stopped by Albertson's and rented  Seabiscuit  and that Diane Keaton-Jack Nicholson movie.

      -I have matches on  urlLink eharmony . Pretty scary. I've "communicated" with Brian from Irving.  -We unintentionally had something of a 'Harrison Ford Marathon.' We watched the  Indiana Jones  and  Star Wars  trilogies.   This brings me to the 'most stupid comment' award. We were watching  A New Hope  and I remembered that as a kid I watched a movie with little teddy bear like creatures called Ewoks. I was thinking about the movie, and I thought that I'd like to watch it again. I said aloud, "do y'all remember a movie about Ewoks? Was it called Ewoks?" Sandy and Lou just stared at me like I was the biggest fool in the state of Texas.   -My book group meets this Thursday, and I'm still only on page 150. I'm not really liking  100 Years of Solitude.  I probably won't finish it by Thursday, but I don't feel guilty. I mean, until this month, Will and I had been the only members to read all the selections. I feel I'm entitled to a month of slacking.  -Cynthia's invited me to go for a swim at her place after work tomorrow. Ugh. Do I have to? I am so not in the mood to purchase a bathing suit.   -My sleep pattern is completely twisted. I'm falling asleep at 3 AM and rising at 1 PM. This is unacceptable.

      Occasionally I'll do something before thinking it over. I just did something that might turn out to be really stupid. I joined  urlLink eharmony . This was really stupid of me, because I'm not looking for a relationship. I really am not. I'm not in the least interested in finding a life partner. I'm too young. I'm too free. I'm too immature. And I'm obviously too hasty and stupid.

      One of the disadvantages of not living in New York City is the lack of late night eateries. Yeah, we have IHOP and  urlLink The Ol' South Pancake House , but a person can have only so many pancakes.   Friday night, after I got off work, Cynthia and I decided to go out for coffee and dinner. I wanted to try the Coffee House Gallery on South Jennings, but it was almost 11 PM when we finally found it. The place was closing: stools and chairs were propped up on the bar and tables and most of the lights were off. So we went off to find dinner. I suggested  urlLink Pei Wei , but it was also closed when we arrived. We drove down Bryant Irvin and ended up at Razzoo's, whose parking lot was by no means empty. The majority of people at Razzoo's, at 11 PM on a Friday night, are teens. Its patronage is made up of scantily clad girls with boyfriends who drive fast Mustangs. This description also applies to the waitstaff.  On Saturday, once I finally located her apartment, Debby and I headed to  urlLink Celaborelle . Unfortunately we took my car.   My car doesn't have a working a-c. When it rains, and especially if it's muggy, my car has the tendency to fog up. Well, as soon as I merged onto I-30 it began to pour, and it was muggy. The windows fogged up immediately and I couldn't see a thing. So I had to drive with my window rolled down to allow a little bit of cool air in to defog the window. Two things made me realize it was pointless to keep my window rolled down: I was doing most of the defogging with my free hand; a car passed me up and literally splashed a bucket's worth of water in my face as it drove away.   We finally made it to Celaborelle, but it was closed. It was noon and the place didn't open until 5 PM. The horror! So we climbed back in the car-cold, humid and wet-and stopped at Esperanza's.   Stuffed, Heartburnish, and dry, we ended our outing with a stop at the  urlLink Amon Carter  to see the  urlLink Cherished Possessions  exhibit.

      I awoke five hours earlier than usual today. I actually went out for a brisk walk. Miracles shall never cease!  I went to some rather pleasant park in the Hulen area. I would have liked to walk more than I did, but my companion-being forty years older-couldn't handle much more.   It's a start.  Tomorrow I'm going to Trinity Park by my lonesome. I'm a bit afraid of the homeless folk, but I'll keep an eye open for suspicious behavior. Not that because one is homeless one will be of shady nature. I'm by no means generalizing or being stereotypical.

      My dreams of riches have been dashed. Woe is me. Ten stinking tickets and not a one the winner.   I was in the bathroom, trying to console my much upset stomach, and I knew I wasn't one of life's winners. I heard only silence. No cheers or shouts of joy erupted from the family as they watched the local news in the living room.  My stomach, bombarded with two dinners, fortunately did not grow any more upset as I saw the long and desolate road of poverty stretch beyond toward the horizon.  Two dinners. Talk about poverty. I swear I didn't want to. I had a shrimp po' boy for lunch and that was quite enough. I had dinner with the family not because I was hungry, but because Sandy had spent the whole afternoon making mom's beef soup. Then Debby came over a couple of hours later and wanted to go out to dinner. Ugh. Chef Chen is an awful awful place.

      I'm considering buying a few lotto tickets. 140 million wouldn't be so shabby. But I'm feeling so listless today and I'm thinking that not even the prospect of 140 million will get me out the door tonight.  But all the things I'd do with that money. I'd buy myself a house in New Orleans.  I'd buy a brand new car. A car with air-conditioned seats and a functioning driver side door. A car without a hole on the floor of the trunk and without a crack on the windshield. Sweet.   I could go to school anywhere I pleased. Harvard would have no choice but to accept me.   I'd live abroad for a year like I've always wanted.  But money only goes so far and if I'm not careful I could lose it all within a matter of years.  What am I saying? I haven't any money. I'm sleep deprived. I'm terribly tired and I just want to curl up in bed and close my eyes. Screw the lottery! But, Lord, please let me choose the winning numbers.   I'm kidding. I'm so kidding.

      I met with a Dean from Texas Wesleyan today.   One thing I've learned about life is that things are usually not as unpleasant as we expect them to be. This meeting, for example, is something I was dreading. I was stressing out because I just knew the Dean was going to turn out to be an arrogant and unlikeable fellow. Not in the least. He was nice, warm, and helpful. How about that?  The incessant rain, on the other hand, was not kind to my hair. I'll have to run a flat iron through it before going to work.

      I saw  Troy  last night with Cynthia. She is a movie-talker. The following is a list of the things she said during the movie-comment's recipient noted: "Do you like swimming?" (To me.) "Trojan was the first 'bad' word I learned." (To me.) "Chihuahua!" (The screen.) "Ahora si!" (The screen.) "It's true. Women do cause a lot of problems." (To me.) At which point I slid down into my seat.  The movie, I think, really was a disappointment, considering it's an "epic."    Am I the only girl who doesn't get the whole Brad Pitt thing? He's never done anything for me. I just don't find him attractive.   He might have worked as a boy toy in  Thelma and Louise , but he was absolutely disastrous as Achilles. For the love of Pete, man, buy yourself some acting lessons! It takes much more than a beautifully sculpted, fine fine, stunningly fine, ilium and ischium to impress me.    I went to Pei Wei today and had the coconut curry beef. This was much better than the pad thai.   While at Pei Wei, I saw a couple of guys from my Birchman Baptist days. I know Stewart didn't recognize me, but I think Matt might have thought me familiar. He glanced at me a couple of times and gave me that look that one gives someone they've seen before, but can't quite place him or her.  I went to the library with Sandy and then later with Debby. Libraries really need to do something about their romance sections. Why must they make them so conspicuous? Not only are they at the front of the library, but they also have a large sign that screams ROMANCE! Geesh. The last thing I want is to be noticed browsing the ROMANCE! section.

      Grocery store. Aisle 12. Sniffing shampoo. Corner of my eye. A figure. I turn my head. Boy. Boy!?! Green cap, white t-shirt, khaki shorts, flip flops. He's sniffing shampoos. Unexplained terror. Chest tightening. Throat constricting. Knees wobbling. Feeling faint? I dart off.  (I darted! Good grief, I darted! Who darts, anyway? Squirrels, deer, cats. Not sensible young adults.)  From a safe distance, breathing normally, I watch as the boy wearing a green cap, white t-shirt, khaki shorts and flip flops exits the store.

      I picked up  The Boy Next Door  by Meg(gin) Cabot at Half-Price Books for a dollar. What's a dollar? I figured, if I didn't like it, I'd give it away via  urlLink bookcrossing.    By no means is this a deep book. It's not even a serious book, really. I did, though, find it somewhat entertaining. Initially, I was skeptical about the book's e-mail format. I mean, would I learn enough about the characters to make them seem like much more than characters in a book? No.   One of the characters, Dolly, seemed way over the top. Granted, I've never been to New York City, so I may not be familiar with citified ways of modern, young, liberated women such as Dolly. Is  Sex and the City  a true portrayal of the life some women (and men) lead?  Bev Fuller, Melissa's unsophisticated Mom from the Midwest, was a complete stereotype. I grew up in a small Midwestern town, and unless one's occupation was a farmer, no business had the word 'Barn' in its name. Especially not the "Beauty Barn." The "Hair Affair", yes, but the "Beauty Barn", never.   Here is an actual quote from the book:            And I don't want you to think we aren't           cosmopolitan, because you know just the           other day they opened up a Wal-Mart! Can           you believe that? A Wal-Mart, right here           in Lansing.  Although the Wal-Mart Super Center in Princeton, Illinois is a novelty, believe me, we Midwesterners know better than to classify Wal-Mart as cosmopolitan. Hmmmph!

      Although it had been temporarily "fixed", my car door has once again locked and refuses to open. I cannot stress enough how much of an embarrassment it is to enter and exit a car through the passenger side door. I've considered sliding in and out of my window, which would be many times cooler than hitting my butt against the parking brake, but it's so 70's.  The brakes are malfunctioning, I'm pretty sure. Every once in a while, when I brake, the underside of my car emits a noise that sounds a bit like metal grinding against concrete. This....is not good.  I just have to remember: there may be better days with greater cars, but today is a good day with a reliable car. There may be better days with greater cars, but today is a good day with a reliable car. There may be better days..........

      Ms. Roberts is a fifty-year old black woman who befriended me last year at MES. She's a lovely woman, but sometimes she says things that leave my mouth open and my eyes wide.   Once, we talked about chicken in general and wings in particular. I told Ms. Roberts I didn't like wings, but that I did like boneless buffalo wings. She replied, "Them ain't wangs. Them ain't no chicken wangs. What'chu eating is just meat. You got to have bones in your wangs; otherwise, them ain't chicken wangs." I told Ms. Roberts I only ate breast. She said, "Child, I'm black! I like me some dark meat. I ain't about eating no white meat. Black people eat dark meat and white people eat white meat." This left me thinking. If&nbsp;one's skin color determines&nbsp;one's meat preference, I can eat neither white nor dark. I-I must eat skin. Rotisserie chicken skin. Naturally, I didn't voice this to Ms. Roberts. Ms. Roberts would have put my smart mouth in its place.   Another time Ms. Roberts asked me if I had&nbsp; a man. No, I said. She asked, "Why ain'tchu got a man? Don'tchu want a man?" I explained to her that I didn't want to deal with the emotional aspect of having a boyfriend. She said, "I know what'chu mean. Men, they always just want to be wit'chu. I want my space. They're confining! See, I got me a man, but he know I don't want to spend all my time with him. I see him on the weekends sometimes, and sometimes I bed him on Friday. That's all I need."   Holy moly, Ms. Roberts! Whatever floats your boat.   Ms. Roberts has invited me to Shreveport. She wants a gambling buddy. I agreed to it, but I'm broke. Totally and completely penniless. This will be my first time at the casinos, and I'll only get to spend twenty dollars. Who goes to the casinos with twenty bucks in their pocket? It'll be a fun outing nonetheless, I think. I lost my driver's license a couple of months ago (yeah, I've been driving without my d.l), so I&nbsp;get to go to the happiest of all places-the DMV. DMV employees are always such rays of sunshine. I  probably  won't get carded-I no longer&nbsp;am mistaken for eighteen-but you never know.

      I've come to the conclusion that cute guys, grocery stores and I just do not mix. First there was the debacle in the shampoo aisle a couple of months ago, and now this.   I went to the grocery store a few nights ago. I was minding my own business, running the list of items to buy through my head. I walked in and saw quite a beautiful head sticking out from behind the cleaner aisle. I managed to get just a slight view of his profile. Not that I was straining my neck to gawk. I wasn't. His innocent head just happened to be tilted in such a way that I could see part of his face. I saw that he had just a slight, but satisfying,&nbsp;sprinkling of facial hair. So, being the person of even-temperament that I am, I walked away.   I was in the cereal aisle, debating. Should I go with the Honey Bunches of Oats with strawberries or the Fruity Pebbles? Hmmmm.&nbsp; When from around the corner, into the cereal aisle, came the beautiful head attached to an equally beautiful body. Full frontal. I didn't stare, though. I'm not a guy, after all. I looked as he turned the corner and then I turned back to my cereal conundrum. But he was right there, in the cereal aisle, near me!! My heart was just a-flipping-and-a-flopping. The wobbly knees made their entrance. Oh, wobbly knees, go away! I couldn't think straight. I didn't have time to make a choice. As soon as I turned my face to the cereals, I grabbed the nearest box, and zipped away. What a schmuck. Can a person be so irrational? What is my fear?   I was in the dairy section before I looked down at the item in my hand. 100% Bran. No strawberries, no Fruity Pebbles.

        Cynthia, Sandy, and I spent yesterday evening at Grapevine Mills. We had planned to see  The   Notebook , but Cynthia had seen it the previous night, so we ended up&nbsp;watching  King Arthur . There's something about Clive Owen that makes me say, "there's something about Clive Owen." What that might be is beyond me. Perhaps it's his eyes-a clear blue with a hint of hazel. Maybe it's the dark hairs on his chest visible through the v-neck collar of his shirt. Hmmm.  &nbsp;  The movie itself? I'm such a bad movie critic.&nbsp;A movie that entertains does not a good movie make. This movie did entertain, but it wasn't really......great. I had an issue with the Saxon leader. He was immensely annoying. The actor himself wasn't bad; none of the actors were bad, really. I don't know a thing about films and their creation, but I think the directing was bad. The Saxon leader was like a really awful long-haired Clint Eastwood. And his son! Oy. That man needed a spanking. He was in desperate need of a time-out.  &nbsp;  The fight scene on ice was exhilarating, though. I was ready to jump out of my seat and run toward the screen.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  After the movie, we made our way to Virgin and bought some music. I had Ronnie Earl's disc,  Now My Soul , in hand ready to purchase, when I stumbled upon  Hank Williams: The Ultimate   Collection  and couldn't pass it up.  &nbsp;  We stopped at a kiosk and Sandy bought a ring. The Indian man at the counter, as he handed the ring to Sandy, said, "It is the bling bling, yes?" We cracked up.  &nbsp;    &nbsp;

      Lou, I think, is trying to discover my top-secret blog. Good grief! I don't want my blog to turn into a familial thing. Sure, it's on the net. Sure, you can type my name on  urlLink Google  and find my blog, but I'm not coming right out and telling people about it. This is a somewhat private endeavor.   It's one thing if a perfect stranger stumbles upon my blog; they don't know me, but if a friend or family member finds my blog, they'll know my deepest most sacred thoughts. I can't have people who know me, knowing my deepest most sacred thoughts. It's not going to happen.   So, Lou, if you find this, stay away!

      Debby and I finally made it to Celaborelle on Saturday night. The food was good, the waitstaff were efficient and the patrons were entertaining. Two couples came in together and sat near our table. They were talking politics, and I was trying to eavesdrop as best I could, but Debby continued talking, so, being the good friend that I am, I reluctantly turned my head and gave all my attention to her.   While Debby talked, I tried to determine the political affiliation of the Celaborelle patrons based on their physical appearance. The two couples to my right, one Hispanic the other African-American, I assumed, were Democrats. Debby, I'm certain is Democrat. The Anglo couple across the room, wearing matching panama shirts, I determined were Dems. The table next to them, a group of young kids, was a tossup. At the table next to them was a group of middle-aged, white, middle class-looking people. I went ahead and labeled them Republicans, only because, I imagine, they're Texans. According to my study, among the Celaborelle patrons there were five Republicans and seven Democrats.  &nbsp; Is my study reliable enough to determine the outcome of this election? Let us wait and see. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      The book group met last Thursday at Pei Wei. I think that, despite the fact that only Will read the assigned book, it was the most successful of all our meetings. It really helped that every single member showed up. (In the past, we've only had three members at most show up.) Well, Olga, who still isn't a true member-even though she did show up for our meeting at King Tut-wasn't able to attend.  I had the Pei Wei Spicy Beef. Totally awesome. (I'm determined to try everything on the menu. So far, I've tried four appetizers, two teas and three entrees.) And everyone else enjoyed their food.   Our reading selection for this month is  The Heart is a Lonely Hunter  by Carson McCullers. Our meeting is scheduled for July 29th at Esperanza's.  I read  The Heart is a Lonely Hunter  about a year ago. I'm going to read it again, though, so that I have the book fresh in my memory.   I'm seeing a trend in our book selections. Three of the books have been 'Oprah books.' I hoped that we'd be able to move away from the orange  O .

      So this  urlLink eharmony  thing just isn't going to work out. I thought it might be a fun thing to do; you know, meet some people, exchange emails, and eventually meet in person. No, I can't do it. I'm already experiencing minor panic attacks. Why am I putting myself through this.  Besides, the one guy I was interested in closed communication. Talk about a blow to the ego. I think he might have thought I wasn't interested.   He initiated communication. He wanted me to answer five questions, which I thought I'd done. This was, what, three nights ago, I think. Well, it turns out my answers weren't sent to him, because I hadn't submitted my credit card information. When it said 7-day free trial, I didn't realize it meant  after  I'd registered with a credit card. Ah. So I logged on this afternoon to register with my credit card, and I see he's closed communication with me.   I still have ten other matches to sift through, but I'm not interested in those other ten. I liked Brian.  Who uses online dating services, anyway? Losers. Yeah, losers. I may be a coward, but I'm no loser.

      So I ended up  not  getting my driver's license before heading to Shreveport.  Isle of Capri really needs to get itself a face lift. How much money does the casino make for the love! Surely it can afford a revamping. Surely it can afford new uniforms for its employees. The only nice, clean spot in all of the Isle of Capri is the gift shop. You walk into the gift shop, and for a minute, just for a minute, you think you're in a classy establishment. You reach into your pocket to pay for the $50.00 bracelet on the counter, and then you slowly retreat from the delusion. "What? You're charging me what for the bracelet? Pshaw! This is the Isle of Capri. Sweep up the paint flakes from the corridor and then maybe I'll buy your stinking bracelet." I'm not bitter.  The two guys at the entrance to the casino mulled over my I.D. (A legal government issued I.D.) "Is it legit?" "Yeah, I think it's legit." "Ok, go on in."  Ms. Roberts gambled and lost $80.00 in less than half an hour. I'd brought $100.00 and wasn't prepared to lose it that quickly. I watched her for a bit longer, then sat at a quarter machine. I gambled 5 and won 14. Woo hoo! I then gambled those 14 and another 15, and lost it all. We left the casino and had lunch-extremely horrid food it was. We walked back to the casino and I had to show my I.D. again. Two new people manned the entrance. "Nope, sorry, we can't accept that as a form of I.D." "What? Why? The two guys who were here earlier let me in." "We can't accept that. No." I felt so sad. Not sad because I couldn't gamble, but because I'd been rejected. Rejection, even from the Isle of Capri, is always a bitter pill to swallow.  Ms. Roberts and I exited the building and hopped on a shuttle toward Hollywood Casino. Ms. Roberts insisted that I try again elsewhere, but I'd lost all fight. I didn't want to be rejected by another casino. I presented my I.D. at Hollywood and the girls there said the same thing. My I.D. was no good. We went to the foyer/lobby and waited. "Well, I'll go in just to make some change for the shuttle." Ms. Roberts left me and she was sure gone a long time, making change. I looked towards the entrance to the casino, and noticed the girls talking with a man. They looked my way, and I panicked. I was certain they were going to arrest me for "attempting to enter without a legal form of identification", per the sign at the entrance. I turned away and started whistling in a nonchalant sort of way-that's never really nonchalant. The man came and sat next to me. "You wanted to get in the casino?" "Yes, but I was told my I.D. wasn't acceptable and I completely understand. I'm just sitting here, waiting for my friend, who'll be out shortly." "Let me see your I.D." "Really, it's not a problem." I handed him my I.D. "No, this is an acceptable form of I.D. You can go on in. I'll escort you and tell the girls you're good." Well. The girls were extremely apologetic. I kept telling them, "It's okay. It's okay." I felt quite respected, but then I realized they only wanted my money. I found Ms. Roberts going crazy at a quarter machine. Her hands were swiftly depositing quarters and pulling knobs. She lost all her money, except two dollars for the shuttle. I lost another ten. I practiced quite a bit of restraint, I think. I only lost $44.00. Do people actually think they're going to win at these places? I met several people who literally saved up all year long to come to Shreveport and gamble those savings away. Hundreds, if not thousands, gone. Some people spend money on shoes, I spend money on books. Gambling, shoes, books; who am I to say what is and isn't frivolous? But there's a certain sadness to gambling, to hardcore gamblers. I looked around at the people in the casinos, and I couldn't help but feel sad. I hoped that all those people know life consists of more than just a few glimpses of temporary happiness.  The moral to this story is: don't go into a casino to make change for the bus. Absolutely no way!
