      It seems i have lots of thing to blow out.Both i have been so busy and the busy weekend is gonna come.The Thamasard University open house is on this Sunday then where will we go first Medical or Engineering.Another trip is Wat Phakaew(temple) where is opposite to the university(millions of farang)that makes me think of Takky.She'd love to.She is crazy in Farang.For us,Nok Ploy Tai Note Pa,it's a good chance to กิน students of university again lol.if they are cuter than Eng.students of Chula.(see you at lan gear) i missed really all matches in Australian open.i'm so pround of Paradorn the intelligent thai tennis player but i'm so afraid,too,that all foreigners would think all thai people look like him who is lao,black,evolving from monkey then why Tai likes him so much.Every time i shout "Paradorn dum"(Black Paradorn) Tai who is already blind says he's cute with just a little black.A guy like paradorn is called cute?

      what do you think when government will change the price of transportation? 3.50 bath will be 4.00 next month. so boring that everyone seems to avoid to eat chicken.I ate it today don't care what people are saying.Premier will kill all chicken in the centre of Thailand.That's so scary.They bury them alive. น้องภาเบื่ออีกแล้วละ งานฟิสิกส์ดูไม่ค่อยจะเคลือบหน้าเลยจริงๆ น้องนกก็ไม่รู้ไปติดไข้หวัดนกอยู่ที่ไหน ไม่ค่อยจะมาช่วยเลยจริงๆ น้องดายังดีนะเนี่ยที่พอจะโทรมาถามสรทุกข์ สุกดิบกันบ้าง งานที่จะทำก็อยากจะบอกว่าเอาสมองส่วนไหนคิดละ ถึงได้ปัญญาอ่อนกันขนาดนี้ ไม่อยากจะเชื่อเขาเลย แต่ก็ดีดีใจนะที่เพื่อนๆๆช่วยกันดี

      Sunday then Monday that the day we have to hand in maths sheets.Anyone finished it?i didn't touch it lol.In English class,fucking Dexter seemed to be prepared for his project.He bought the circuits for "Stimulating Muscle".What about our project? dunnu have not seen it yet.I realrised that I have been too lazy.Is any language ever wondering what science students do?They learn just English and another one language as they chose.I'm so bored with this curriculum.I should stop before people find out how lazy i am For news today,I'm so sorry of the news that one guy broke into the temple and shot monks.I was scared of this news.Can we find peace in the south of Th?I try not to think it's the conflict of religion and it's because the government sent the soldiers to Iraq.The temple used to be the most important place even I hardly go still feel it's great.I just want to warn all christians because it's possible that the next turn will be yours(kidding).[ urlLink Bangkok post ]The school was shut but they still found the way to attack.Actually,we all are under the same constitution.It shouldn't have ad a news like this.It was too much and the government should do more than making the understanding to Islamic group.This problem wouldn't occur if Thai sold this land to British or let them colonize lol.It would be the islamic land of Malaysia.Anyway,this holiday I still want to travell in the south. One news in my interest is not really terrorist mission.Mission on mar that I'm keeping up.It's a good sign for Thai to start something with aerospace.If we are looking to see what other countries are doing with it. you'll see they are proceeding! The barrier is not the money. We could start with studying the past missions,founding the aerospace centre,researching.I'm not dreaming.We should do. [ urlLink US , urlLink Russian , urlLink Canadian ]well where is Thai?  The other I'm scared of is bird flu[ urlLink CNN , urlLink BBC ] Any one can read all above?At least Suluck can read.news contest tomorrow

      i'm sorry i have not posted anything.it was the problem of my com.i'll give you a short of the past . not much really my life is so simple that i can not find the excitement to post. i kept myself with the pile of chem books but it couldn't help me in chem test.i coundn't do even half of itin 2 hours. the compute chem was too hard. the boy who sat on my right sleeping almost all the time in test lol.Luckily,i was awaken. i'll let you know my result tomorrow that i hope it's not too bad as zero.in the test one problem is what products when we oxidize cocaine. who knows?if it's not 50,000 baht of prize i won't take part in.i feel like HCl is digesting my tissue.i'm hungry(hydrochloric acid)   writting on net is so fun even though no one reads it. A few people open this page. i'm free to write   talking to people on net is much better than talking one on one . i can talk all the things in the thing i won't talk face to face.type then halt then talk again but i never know them exactly. never know their thoughts exactly.never see their eyes. can have just good feelings to each other,or not   i updated my album.it's large size so takes long time to load.

      10 Jan 2547 today is today nothing that much in this day. got up at  8.30 am. with the feeling of what to do then. showered then went downstairs to read Harry Potter. can't believe that i could read just 30 pages. This is Jan PA PA PA this is Jan you should read just your books that are all around your room.not Harry Potter that the reason why i could read just 30 pages.maybe i'm too old to go out in children day but still had to go out to take 4 Hrs course of maths.      permutation is not that boring as i thought at first. i sat next to this gay guy again. so annoying) He came and said where is your seat Adipa i will sit next you so i pointed at my seat then he moved all his books to sit next to me( why! why!) the lecturer  is pee Tae who is a big fan of Rakanok online game and Harry potter why one old engineer can be like this! he watch JU ON movie with nightmare afterwards.he made funny joke in class.     came home and went out to eat with my father's friend. he suggested me to study in LAW (his father's friend). Italian food is totally FAT. i don't like this meal      came home again ironed my heaps of clothes so tires turned on my TV at 23.00 pm. getting bored with English Lang movie DON"T UNDERSTAND lol       turned it off   online is morn fun even it has less friends at this time

      Warut: A boy who can sit with computer 24 hrs per day      : ruling computer and saying hand off to anyone who want to touch computer      : has it own illegal ragnarok server  what do you think about this?   urlLink "Liverpool" . i prefer Newcastle especially Robert of Newcastle.Sometimes i feel like i have crazy primier who thinks himself can buy anything.I have been waiting for this possibility and do hope one day we can cheer our own league.What would i do for today then? I don't have time that much on net because of Warut.Maybe Harrow doesn't have computer so he has to play out on PC here.Can it be computerism in the future like it has infirmary to treat people who can not seperate from computer.i will send Rut to.   urlLink if you are the one who under 18 . is it right to have this law? what happens in Thailand? it doesn't matter to me cos i'm not a girl who hang around at night. i did ever go with family not with friends but from this 29th march we can not go out between 22.00-04.00 except for going with family.i don't think it can reduce a crime. some countries teenager can go to tax pub with the age younger than us. well... this is 2004

      yes! yes! The first of exam has just passed.Even i can not all do math problems in exam, I still feel so good. 1.30 hrs with 30 problems in math, i no doubt could not finish it on time. i'm gonna discuss stupid lessens.Dexter ,the best in math,could not finish it too.i want to know what's in my teacher's head.Maybe I'm stupid or maybe I'm idiot so i can not do it. i had about 10 problems left without reading of them. I think it's not fair that sci students have to learn English as the others do ,and further more we have to learn Thai as others do.Think! the war between Thailand and Burma ,Why we have to learn so much like the war between Thai and Burma they made it to be lengthy poetry with the word about 100 years ago. They always composed without knowing that the children in the future will have to learn them.The last day of exam will be physics which i confuse to pick on formulae,english which we have to learn as other field students do so is it fair for us,economics which i can not remember all things.After the last day in exam i promise i will have my hair cut.    well I miss all buddies,Pa

      woke up with cold weather in the morning.what happens with the weather.in the winter,it has rain,cold or ever hot.it was pretty cold so i had to folded my arms all the way to school.i love the time when it's nearly holiday.we do the lab or not.no one cares.all lessons were taught.it had just Tai stirring the mixture of polymer in the lab,shouting HEY! you girls! it turns cold HEY! it turns hot WOW! it vaporizes finally, i got polymer.Ploy who first watched into the glass got the vapors into her eyes. lol she couldn't open her eyes for a while.the process of production in plastic is so easy as i'll risk to do it myself at home but i don't have any matrix to form it.From Buddist camp on,i have felt like sometimes want to go back to meditate and learn more.the taughts are worthwhile.i had never felt like this before.in depth of taught is about normal of life which we never think about.the temple i went for camp was so hi-tech.i mean the presentation that monks presented to us,the watersupply system,the branches of meditation around the world even in USA.am i too deep? everthing that has a beginning has an end.one day.i'll forget this feeling all.i'm still a girl who hardly go to temple as usual except for travelling. my kiwi cake both look good and taste good.i like making cake even if Tai who kept calling GAY-wi cake.does she like gay? she extraordinarily likes guys such as Paradorn.what part of world she lives in.she doesn't know how to pronouce it.i bet she lives in NZ.(sorry Tai i know you are reading i don't want to humiliate you but you are frankly humorous) i have been doing my report of project which concerns Electrochemistry.it's a physics project,though it mostly concerns chemistry. "Plating" we plate copper,zinc.silver(still do not have enough money to get the compound of gold) luckily,physics teacher approved us to do this work if not we would have to do intangible motor

      i finished Harry Potter! Umbridge is all around bitch(sorry if her name is incorrect)i read in Thai version.i wonder why bird flu can spread so quickly.it's possibly there's someone behind this incident?the scientists can do everything.  i saw Pantongtaa(prime minister's son)is going to do the contract between him and jackie chan.i never go to take a photo at his studio.Is there someone ever go to?i passed his studio many times at Siam but never got in.the time is precious.we have just 1 year before off this school.feel like want to drop all science subjects but can not step back,have to gallop full speed into the future even realrise i did choose wrong route.life is a circle.just simply step forwards and don't look back.i look forward to final exams that are just around the last week of this month.i anticipate to do the highest average grade to be holiday present for myself.Ben,a girl who sits next to me got sick.it's obviously easy known by her voice.i received telephone from Ploy early evening that all students of M.5 room 1 won't go to school tomorrow all class.it will be a history (i wish) we do not do protest.just have less e-go and conscience.Ploy will go to temple when she does not have to go to school.i worry about my friends as they seem to go to temple so often.maybe the complicated world,tension.stress can change my friends to be nuns.i met one post on net.one guy have posted the question how to know girl whether she is virgin or not  urlLink [post] guys want just virgin women to be their wives without responsibilities what they lost someone's before.

      woke up at 6.00 and as a daily pa'life--absorbing British English accent by 107 FM in the morning. BBC news service presented the first work-training day of prime minister's daughter at siam square. Good day when i set off to wait for bus at bus stop for a half hour then stuck on the road because of fucking triffic. I was sorry of my late. walked around three halls of Book fair with my aunt. Everything was so cheap that i wanted to buy all books. I got the world map for my bedroom wall and A-Z mathematics handbook.Hey do Thai people ever have  the pride of Bangkok city.it looks so great when overseeing from ledge of BTS. Swansen's along again with chocolate tower {T_T}

      "เช้งเม้ง" I have to go next Sunday again . It's a special for grandpa who died last year. HEY GUYS!!!!I have to decide one future of mine. What will I be in a future. The answer is not an astronaut. I mean it really. I just decide it suddenly when I have to fill the university form out. My parents have long asked me for ages but I don't know really. P'Kim and P' koon are about "ENGINEER: vitsava ja dee sud sud leaw" I know It will be good for me because of lots of guys there. That's a good opportunity. N'num is about "Economics". My parents are about "Law or Economics"  Ok don't want to think about. Let it go as it should go

      chemistry class was very good. We did not talk about chemical equation anymore just why does Titanic remain the same forever. ok still the equation but it was not complexity. After the class is Brioche-tesco lotus-McDonald's so what would i do next i was eating ice-cream at Mc and felt so cold. yes Bangkapi market was the next. It was like walking in the pan   HOT! HOT!  I got the flowers that can go so well with the wine bottle. The friuts are very cheap at market these days  -----  oh well I found someone to go with in book fair.   The book named สาระเลวออนไลน์ is very funny . It concerns the methode of post on http://www.pantip.com and how to find true love on Pirch.   Very good idea. I'm thinking of how to find chit love on MSN,ICQ,Yahoo,QQ .

      woke up with my new voice. It's getting sexier or not, I can't say exactly just the onlyone is absolutelydizzy. Sore throat,running nose hardly happen in my life so i feel like they have already knocked me out. Hope that I will get over in a few days Bangkok International Book Fair 2004(26 March-6 April) which is held anually at Queen Sirikit National Conferrence Center.There are few english book shops here. I can perceive just Clula book shop and Asian Book with Chula's small zone of English books.I'd like to go but who with?

      need treatment again for my hair. I want to know is there any time I can have nice hair without heat which damages my hair terribly. The modern hair-dresser would think about. thanks for makeup and preppy clothes from my mom. The wedding today was very good just one thing I keep wondering is why the groom and the bride are about 40 years different. The groom is very rich with the beautiful bride who carries master degree from NIDA.  That makes sense. Maybe I will find an old-rich groom in the future lol . Thai wedding is a bit boring really. I preferably have just small wedding to the big one. Can i say that just for free if I have loved someone no need to give so much money to bride's family so what would my father think?

      I'm so grateful that Mr. งืมๆ came to give comment so many every day but it can make someone misunderstand especially None-Bum and Nong-Sanantip. Mr. งืมๆ I do want you to reveal yourself as soon as possible and you must make this clear cos Bum told me that you talk to her every day. What does it mean really? What about me?........ I would like you thought it thoroughly before making a decision. the request which you want me to translate English into Thai I'm afraid that I can not do so

      I've been reading less than I should read. Making schedule for life at this time should have been done. I live with indulgence so how I have a success in the future so what constructive ideas I will write out when I'm not in mood really to be on strict table.&nbsp; here please let it be done       learning intently for chemistry class. I will try to make it out and comprehend it deeply no matter how hard lesson it is. However the guy sitting next to me is so haughty, he always glances at my book to check whether I do the practice wrong or not. I'll be more patient and be reasonable with the nature of Sci student that have to be competitive and  selfish. Anyway, how dare him tell me to change the seats today     I will be present every hour of English class. I will not skip it, I promise even the class gathering mostly girls like I can't find any human in class called boy. The students that attended English class are not just girls but also pretty. I keep wondering if Sci students can improve the beauty as well     Be healthy. This is the important objective which I had better do the first. I will eat breakfast. I will eat at least 2 meals a day. No more tea it will be just milk that I will drink it 1 liter a day or at least every other day. I will get over imbalance hormone.     Be relaxed. I will find any chance for going to have fun not like this       Michael: soon i will be in Thailand again!for Songran  Pa: wow  Pa: good  Pa: you will have so fun  Michael: yes very good  Pa: i love that too  Michael: i love Songran !  Michael: i was there also the last 7 years ( every year )  Pa: so cool  Pa: your daughter likes it i think  Pa: get wet   Pa: in the hot weather  Michael: yes all my family like very much  Pa: there are so many people on the road  Michael :D yes  Pa: splash water to each other  Michael: so Songkran stay home ?  Pa: yes  Pa: don't want to get wet  Michael: ooh really   Michael: it is warm so ?! easy to dry again - lol  Pa: yes   Someone will fly here for just Songkran but a little girl like me just wants to be at home so it's time for  revolution. I will find someone to absorb the atmospheres of Songkran this year, still waiting for someone.       The revision of all subjects which right now I can not see any progress should be the one I will think over

      was awoken up by cell phone went out at 8.30 am. My lovely auntie asked me to go out to have lunch at Royal Orchid Hotel on this Sunday. I was so grateful of her invitation.after got fresh in the morning and got full of the breakfast,It was the time of the same circumstance that i had to be in slogan of Thai student " Tutor forever" but soon in English class Suluck called me to ask me to skip the class for going to sizzler. are you guessing what was my answer? Tha answer was i said yes. I feel sorry for this conduct. My dad sent me to this class but his daughter skipped it out .I will never let him know what i was doing today. It's so fun having the lunch with Suluck. 3 Hours at sizzler,talking besides eating,so many topics on the table.

        urlLink for every comments about my country I don't know what to say about this. May be some are true,we are so lazy as you can see from the slow development of our country and the whores around Patpong begging the money called Dollar or Euro on the street.It's a shame that Thai women can exchange their bodies to a stupid western money by they think it's high. so cool  Philip Williams! I can remember one time i was sitting in the coffee shop on Khao San Rd with cousins then one western guy suddenly watched at me with lifting his drinking in his hand like trying to ask if i'm whore so we can not judge all Thai women that they are whore.I'm getting to like this Web i don't know why cos it reveals all aspects in Thailand not in just the positive images which we are building to be a deceit. So well where is Philip teaching? cos i need new English teacher really

      do you ever hold your cell phone in fear? After the bombing cell phone cases on TV,I haven't been like holding my phone firmly, talking far from phone about 20 CM so i can throw it away in case it's gonna be as explosive.Can it explode on my face even i have genuine accessories? every piece of it is from Finnland cos i can see on cover of battery. I wouldn't use it till wear out of course but on TV even new battery can short out. I have read Battery Information in user's guide as a result i want to warn someone who opens this page(in parenthes is mine) :Do not short-circuit the battery.Accidental short-circuiting can occur when a metallic causes direct connection of the + and -terminals of battery :Leaving the battery in hot or cold places,such as in a closed car in summer or winter conditions,will reduce the capacity and lifetime of battery.Always try to keep the battery between 15 c and 25 c.A pkone with hot or cold battery may temporarilt not work,even when the battery is fully charged ( how can i keep battery in that temp in ,Thailand is about 35 c now) :Do not dispose of batteries in fire     good luck with you newly high-tech communication

      I woke up around midnight GMT then struggled to turn on my radio which I could just reach out my hand,listening to  BBC correspondence in Bangkok discussing the human right in Thailand.It was disturbing a lot. Why didn't they discuss burning schools,killing monks,causing explosions. I had to get my strength to walk out the bed.I was so late in Physics class,also Mink that we got on the same bus.We talked how clever Tol is that he got  police school.I believe that one day he will be titled or influance person in this country.The prime minister used to study in police school also.Tol will get adventage in learning because everytime he shoot out he can calculate as pojectile movement lol(If he can apply physics) so during his calulation the thief has already killed him. I met Ton too(He is cuter and whiter than me) We all went to Visuth Thanee for physic classes. On the air bus number 15(2 hours),I was so interested of new in construction building just around Central World Plaza.Finally,I reached to Satorn where we had such a big sea food meal.We had talks so many.I spent 4 hours there to live together that can take my weary away from long way journey. I set off at 16.00 but reach home at 19.00,taking many kinds of vehicle Air buses,Ferry,Tuk-Tuk,Taxi   oh I love Bangkok My grand worries about me so much that I go everywhere by myself so often but keep calling all the time is worse because I don't want to pick my phone when I'm in busy transportation. Suluck came my home so pity that I was out

      woke up in the morning with the noise that everyone telling what happened at dawn in the south of Thailand.I don't know to see the government defuse this incident or where is the refuge of insurgents right now. I said just 107 deaths.Oh such a shame I believe that Thai security is strong to kill more than that. I am sorry to hear that 3 Thai police were killed in this severe battle which made me feel so excited as watching US and British troops in iraq war or the terrible pictures of children in Arab channel. Maybe Thai soldiers are not cute as US and British if so I would feel more excited lol. My sister(Ya) has gone to Singapore today so I can see just silence in this house. This was a rainy day eventually it stopped after raining for more than 6 hours. I met physics teacher(Archan Penphapa) by chance as she will not teach room 1 any more in this coming term. Pa: hello (Sawasdee and wai) Te:nice to meet you. Are you getting more beautiful? I mean your complexion as I can feel that you get ready to go to university. So what have you done with your skin? why is your skin so clear?  Pa:I don't know. Maybe i got fat. (in pa's mind-- I have exposed my skin under strong sun more than 10 hours this Songkran so how can it be clear)  Te:How is your revision this time? Pa:very good(I have lied) Te:good i have expected you so high.And your physics is 4 that i can remember.What will you study in university? Pa:Just like your son Engineering of Kasertsat university(Her son is very cute that's his reputation) Te:Oh i must go with a bit glance

      In physics class,I could do correctly just 60% of practice. I don't want to do it seriously but now and then I am so very lazy to revise as I should do. Hey,I went to the mall to watch movie,standing in front of the showing list,making decision on what movie I would watch--Dawn of dead or THe passion of The Christ. I set my mind and walked into the slot queue,booking the ticket of Lline where is very near screen,obviously isolating. I made sure no one booked on that line and it is far from the first of part. I managed that I had enough Golden Thread(Thai dessert) and water in 10 minutes before it would be on.Maybe Golden Thread is much sweeter than chocolate.So relaxing,sitting alone in the line besides eating my sweet dessert. Suddenly,there were one couple appeared and just sat next to me. I repeat "just sat next to me a tennage couple". About this movie,I do say that it's violence,not suit children under 10 years old because they would cry. Just maybe we can do such that painful punishment to severe sin.(Politician's son who had accusation as murdered officer but still not quilty--not sacrifice but deserves) I want to watch Harry Potter--Rupert is getting cuter

      This is Sunday which I can get rest or get up as late as i want to.My dad and mom went to temple in early morning,I decided not to go there because i was too lazy to go anywhere,my sister just kept sleeping. So strange that my dad invited all of us yesterday to go to temple today.My grand(mother's dad) came here around just when we had closed the shop then we had such a warm meal at MK restaurant.She has been back from China and got so many strange fruits as it was dried as raisins for me. She thinks it tastes good but no not for me at all.She offered me by handing in my hand so I cound observe it thoroughly how it was, light yellow,terrible smell. I just stopped breathing then ate. It was not that so bad at least I did not throw up.I just do not understand sometimes why Thai children need to lie as i did when i said the resin was so great I love it thanks my grand..... I wondered of pictures that showes how civilized of China,I can see so beautiful skyscraper at Shanghai.  So great but anyway i think,Bangkok has beautiful skyscraper as it has too.

      woke up a bit late today and iprobably say i was idle all this morning. I was making strength to carry out the class of physics and so i've done so well with fulfilling confusion. The classteaching went so fast.By thw ways of comparing,other classes i ever took.Basic mechanics is still nice to me though. i just want to bounce it.After class so where i can hang out in Bangkapi,I can see just the mall bangkapi or you have any suitable places to go by near distance and all of convenience.I had been waiting quite so long at se-ed book shop till someone hit my shoulder with German book then i turned knowing ly to Suluck(yes it was her). At Suluck's request,we headed to The pizza company.oh well sitting there seemingly 2 hours. The middle size plate of pizza was swallowed by 2 girls(greedy girls) still excluded 8 pieces of chicken cause we could't put them. I love talking on table with friend really. I didn't care should our bellies swelled or not(very offensive to us). I watched MTV phillippines on the time they replayed MTV asia award 2004.TaTa,kissing Gareth Gates and all members of Blue(one love) from Uk is very passionate to me

      The world is getting hotter than it is ever is what i agree this time.I went out for getting stuff and felt like burning is going to happen to me.Oh..I'd like to learn English with teacher Vitchit. He's a customer of my shop,always ordering kind of practice copy or binding books for his class-- urlLink this is his site . He teaches just for Master degree student or just students prospect abroad education. I want to learn but the problem is his refusal. He insists on i'd play than learn because of my youngness and improper knowledge of English. I know i ever skipped English class but i don't think i'll do it in his class--real intensive English. He has Brit accent:) MBA from USA but still has Brit accent cos he lived there when he was young. No matter how much i ask he seems the same. Ok..I have gave in this idea. I have bothered asking so long. What if i will do a survey for what is the worst of physics group 1Mechanics  2Electric  3.Wave  4.Nuclear  5.Solid fluid Gas please leave the vote in comment naja. i haven't learn engineering fundamental so far. can P'kim and P'koon help me!!!!!!!!

I'm thinking about will i go swimming. will i get dark or black. ok i won't care about that just have fun. Just Black Just Black who's care? why i have to be scared of it.  I have just eaten the Chinese food--dim-som. I don't like Chinese food at all if it was not the request of my grandma i wouldn't go to. is it wrong if i steal the bible in the room?   maybe will come online tonight again on MSN.

      What i did today is not much really. I have finished Electrostatics so the next is electrical. I hate electric group as well as wave. I want to finish it fast so i will have time to revise Base-Acid. Base-Acid is real hard when you can see log in chemistry. ok thanks Ple&Takky for your comments but sometimes Adisai can not understand all our desire. He's a great guy who i pay him my respect. Thais are not English so we can not do as they do unless we stay in English spoken country. I don't have that good English and always make mistake just come closer so you can notice.Japanese are worse than us if you don't believe just testify high school students there. Who cares? if you ask Tai about this she will about"ก็เราไม่ได้เป็นเมืองขึ้นมันนิ" It's still a reasonable excuse for us lol.For a better choice why don't you find Farang to be your boyfriend so you can save amount of money to pay to teacher lol.  I have been living with balance hormone for 5 months and i don't want to stop it for good. I love to talk to women just like me around the world  urlLink here. I love to have nice skin,hair as I am now without maintenance.Can i tell doctor to feed me hormone all my life.I am getting so firm with new weight.Anyway, Suluck you should not eat it even it's a modern hormone.So boring when doctor asks about Entrance Exam relating to stress or what will i be in the future? or what i eat or what i like to eat. he likes to interfere my life. I'm so worried about Warut. He has kik names N'Goft who is a friend of N'Num.(at Dulwich,Phuket)They have known about 7 months or more.never meet just on Ragnarok and MSN and Phone. How it can be? I was so shocked when she called my cousin to say Goodnight around midnight.so sweet with his 13. He beats us all.Warut is so cool. finally,Thanks for bill and Mr. stuart for your permission

      hi! what's up I'm not Bangkapi by now just living at Satorn a week for this songkran.Jogging in the morning is a very good idea but most of people don't have so much time to do so.I should put aside some time to do. Too much jogging at start is a weary which is very painful. What would i do when my cousin will come back in soon then rule this com as his online life should be. TV or revision/ revision or TV   ok...Think carefully  I would choose the right thing to do.

       The cemestery at Chon Buri   got up at 4.30.It was a good morning with a little cold weather that everyone had to shrink themselves  in the car. Chon Buri province was the destination which is in the east of Thailand. We could reach there in 2 hours and did not spend much time to be a waste. The chineses style of cemestery is about the big gravestone with the grassy small mountain behind it. It made me feel the first time of a need to have digital camara. We go to this place every year,still no one wants to keep the nice picture of the good view here. we were in the hill surrounding the big mountains and fog but after soon when the sunrise came then the weather got so hot that we had to move rapidly. We burned a lot of papers in which it was made to be the facilities like Car ,Clothes,Visa,Notes that have various currencies including Dollar. The Chinese like to do something that is so nonsense. They believe that the dead people will receive all those in their new lives so we had to burn a lot of papers which carry lead (Pb) and produce tons of carbondioxide  (CO 2 ). The worst is carbonmonoxide( CO) that affects a lot to everyone and profuses to ruin oxone(O 3 ). how much toxis gas of burning paper was produced per year by chinese around the world?  Bang Saen Beach  We got a big rest on Bang Saen Beach. There were hundred of people today because of Sunday. I could revise the periodic table and the radiation here. Although It was a big hot we sat about totally 3 hours. We did worship the gods there too before leaving  An accident  Hey you should at least drive on motor way 120 kmph!!!! not today.....I don't want to talk about the accident on motor way that how it is badly damaged when every car got their high speed. The traffic jam on motor way with which my dad drove 20 kmph for 50 minutes before authorities moved the damaged cars out of the way. Actually,we got real own a little accident...don't worry...It's just a lovely mark on my dad's car.  Dentist  Back home at 19.00 and rushed to dentist's to get my bracese. the light green for this month you guyssss  Grievous online  I'm online so... yes.... just online and checking mails. I will being away a fortnight from now on MSN.  see you after Songkran  oh such a terrible feeling. I have deleted MSN so free time tonight is my benefit

      I haven't written anything on this blog nearly a week. It's not there nothing in my life few days ago but I haven't had time to do so. The first week of pre-university year will end today by the new feeling that it consists of tension. This year is tough. Everyone is so keen to learn with no fussy teachers to tell.  overviews this term -The senior is very old wherever you go,you will realize that you are the oldest in this school -Work, just first week but all teachers assign all work to do for this term then they just keep teach  -Fun, last year of school so I am trying to have exceeding fun -Intellectuality, now what we learn in last 3 years will gather in this year -Time, extension of time in this term makes I get home late -Friends, we still help each other and collaborate,only last year before separation  HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO AUNTIE "KIM"    Tomorrow, I have to venture in BKK again. Sometimes, I need someone to make me fresh but who? I will be 18 years old girl in next 3 months. How much I have lost in my 17,I don't know but I spent it as much as I can. A year goes so fast that I can not accept. Older and Older but there's nothing new and intelligent.   I have known myself exactly now what I will be in the future,I have an aim.oh Time to get a move on into the future that I am looking forward to. It all depends on me so build it girl.....

      After the shocking picture below.--Sorry Friend if I scared you--    My life today is so productive with 5 hours of Maths class(13.30-18.30). It was peculiar when this lecturer just added the lesson all the time and there was no joke   Last week of 5 hours  Joke = 2 hours Lesson= 3 hours   This week of 5 hours  Joke = 15 minutes lesson = 4.45 hours ( a huge pressure )  I have a seat on the first line in the class,just imagine when my father called me on the last minute of the class by my ring tone(Sexy Naughty Bitchy,Ta Ta Young). There was a little joke about me before the class was over. I couldn't stop laugh out even it was a joke about me.  What can I do to make my life is just much more better, not just learn learn,read read,online life,school. There is no inspiration or motivation in my life to do something just make all atmoshpere better. Life is about the same all the time or human being can do just this in their lives. No excitement,New,Experience  just the same all the time  Ethics-- The one substance we have been taught since so young till by now. Weird that we never reach to it.  And why we have to reach to.

I love this slogan from my friend urlLink "Suluck" . It's the reality.  Warut&Goft finally decided to be just friends after one year of online relationship. Warut was the first who speak to end up. How nice of my brother! Never met but Can be as an EX. How can it be done? --One year-- continually calls--chats. so pity I have deleted long conversations in logs all. Forgot to open it at Sathorn.  I watched "Troy" with my aunt at tesco. How sexy of Brad Pitt!!!, also Olando Bloom!!!. I'm so tired. Type Type and feel so tired.......  What can I do about saen-saap canal to be as a environmental project? maybe find DO or BOD of it, but I don't have a lab to do so. Em....... Idea goes!

      how jaded of me after long way from Bangkapi(Suburb) to Sathorn Road(the center of city).I went to Buffet restaurant--" urlLink Oishi "--Chinese Japanese and seafood restaurant.Express Lunch--Just 299 baht then you can eat all in 1.45 hours.My belly is going to blow up.[T_T] I can not eat anything after this meal...oh oh help me My belly is gonna explode.  I will come back to Bangkapi tomorrow or I should live here longer. I love my Grand and I don't think I can love anything else in this planet as much as I love her.There are not many years left for her life.I just want to spend this precious time to make her happy as much as i can power.   All bad things I always do to her   1. Get my face so bored when she is telling about World War II or how cruel of Japanese soldiers or how she came to Thailand of the relatives were tortured by communist  2. Change a channel in her room to be English channel. She would never understand or laugh with me  3. Shut myself in computer room so long and don't come down to see how worry of her  4. Leave her alone in her room because I don't want to watch the same channel with even there are just two of us in the house      Grand: Hui! Be with me...I have changed to channel you want to watch Pa:    Thanks but just leave me alone here.you can not understand it. Grand: I don't want to watch any more Pa:    No thanks ..Grand...  Actually,I did more than that but cannot remember all. So soon she will have a change in her life again,New house,She got through all tough in her life. War,Immigration,Bankrupt,Loss,Silly Pa. Her life could be a book if someone wrote it down.   P.S. Mr. Adisai...can you send me to Iraq instead of Entrance Exams? I don't want to read any more.....

I hope it will be ok     oh Thanks for the webmaster of www.kapook.com that they have banned the VDO of one american cut his head off about 5 minites ago.I would never watch. TOO VIOLENT I think if they did nothing about this page I would tell the US Embassy(kidding).  We have stepped gradually far from pacifying.I could see just hatred.We all now time for adaptation. KILLING,BOMP,NO FORGIVENESS,UNFINISHED WAR. These are so far in the world.

      Hey-I ate 3 meals... Som-Tum is my supper. My dad said if I always eat 2 meals per day like this I will be averse food like somebody in TV.  I read so much in Maths but soon I realized that I no way understand it so I came from upstairs to play Barbie with my sister. I found that how fun when I taught my sister slam another Barbie by palm dolls. Yes my sister laughed out a lot and she eventually played like that in front of my parents. Fortunately,my parents just laughed out too and said "Do not do that to your dolls ...Ya!" Ya did not say that Pa taught her  lol

      I went to hospital--6 disks of hormone. I have been so happy that I will not be seeing doctor during 6 months. Hormone replacement therary for a year and now I'm in the middle way of treating( 6 months since December last year).  So strange that it did not rain. Oh yeah that the way I like. I want to eat Som-Tum with crab by now. My sister is eating that but I omitted the supper. Very bad feeling that I have to be more patient. I would invite my friends in the group to eat Isaan food aroud the flat this term Ok? I'm lovin' it

      I went for getting new books for the last year of my schooling. 16 books for this year which I am the first who got. As usual, science books all are thick, the most expensive and the heaviest of other field studies. My eye sight is very bad by now as I had to stare to everybody who walked towards me.I see just short distance at my home but when I'm at school.I can see in very far sight so I notice that it's getting worse. I need new glasses

      I have one problem of Physics for making fun. try it out guyzzz  One day when Pa is jogging in the morning then she found someone looked like Suluck far away from Pa 25 meters. For making sure if that girl was Suluck or not,she threw the stone with 50 m/s of velocity and  60 0  of angle between the floor and the direction she threw.(no friction) The question is How long did pa stop that girl by stone  I was so bored so for killing this mood I had to come online at night so how many I found.Nearly no one left. Gmail is a good service. I'm lovin' it and more I like its new options which I can find in nowhere else. Google is getting bigger but I know they need more money to develop this big project. I have used it with the biggest storage I ever had(1 Gigabite). One expertise has found out all Gmail( just take a look on Stuart's web).   Anyone wants to go to Black Eyed Peas Live In Bangkok? I like UK band. I like "Where is the love" by Black eyed peas(From LA) very much,sounding like my life.I still remember how eager of Suluck wanted to see Coldplay concert last year. I want to go this concert but no one could go with me. So bad...   The key:     Horizontal of Projectile S=Vt 25 =50cos60 0 t 25 =50(0.5)t t    = 1 second  : Pa spent 1 second to stop that girl

      I am having a break.I'm fed up with high piles of book in my room really but what I can do.I'm a human who never gives up or gives in even how hard I have to face. Fight it!(English) Ban Zai!(Japanese) Sue Sue!(Thai) I want to scream to everyone around the world "CONGRATULATIONS TO P'Koon" --The frist year of Engineering at Chulalongkorn university. I'm also proud  of Bangkapi students of this year too.  P'Tal(6/2) --Technical medical(Chula) P'Pite       -- Engineering(Kasertsat) P'Akavan  -- Pharmacology(Mahidon)   There are so much more than this the students who passed the entrance exam. I will be the same.I have promised[T_T]. P'koon, can I ask you out? when you receive the shop shirt,can you walk around siam with me.It will be like I have a guy from Eng,Chula lol.The Thai stock market these times is dramatically decreasing--violence in the south and low-tech terrorists affected a lot including the enlargement of new ten members of Eu which will have impact to Thai economy.Sometimes,this group is too much big.(envy them)The main strong impact would be the break of hot chinese economic growth.Ok I shouldn't discuss serious events on my blog.  P.S. If anyone knows what university did Bank( A boy from Bangkok Christian for boys school) get in,please inform me immediately. I'd like to say even how clever he is,I never admire him as many teenagers in Thailand do.

      When the time of school comes to the last year,the senior has to have one junior to take care and help to teach.I got one now.Her name is "Nat" from year5 room 1.It's amazing that we both from room 1. I don't know what is the feeling for being TA(teaching assistant) It would be hard and tough when standing in front of the room and teach the juniors which lesson they learn is not tough at all.   Count down to Entrance 2004 (just 3 month)   sometimes,I can not even to speak or laugh.It's so typical for students who are in this stage all. All responsibilities seem to be on my back which I have to carry out. All to do is just thinking about my parents and my future.  This weekend I went to KU at Bangkane to take UCE test. The test was a bit tough but I got through.I also notice that I have some weaks in English test which I have to improve it. I saw the orientation of the first year at Human faculty.  Pity for the first year who had all to knee in the floor and were being wet ,covered with powder,colours. It's a tradition that university of Thailand doing this for a long time however it was a bit barbarian,don't you think? I don't want to talk about Engineering faculty where this tradition is very cruel. so scary! KU is very big when I came first I needed to get on motorbike to go to building and when I wanted to go out from KU.  Entrance exams,England and Germany are out from EURO 2004. Kose,in this EURO was so down like Beckham so my life has nothing to laugh.Maybe it's good for me to read more.I love Rooney(aged 18,England)

I have also written to 2 swiss exchange students who will come to Thailand this September--my new victims.I will try to write to them all in the group and send some pictures of school.oh well,I can stand to see myself at this time to watch football.Maybe I should go to sleep not to type at the half of game.  Among females the primary reason for supporting a team seems to be how handsome they think the players are,still the one I think I do.It's not wrong to see the players instead of game sometimes,don't you think?

The First of my class last year is Tai and I was the second.If I hadn't got B*s in Maths and Health studies.How can I be clever like P'Kim and P'Koon.I am stupid by now with occupied space in my brain for each subject.  Science student today is about Maths--fool Physics--dull Chemistry--blunt Biology--What the hell of hormone list that I have to remember English--Can we fight with student from Act?  so life goes on..............for Bill(my friend) who is the first of this term in his University. You are insane!!!!  4.00/4.00/4.00/4.00   Am I too abitious for this term? dreaming I think but I will do my best. no,this is the last chance to do.......

Did you make your pant deliberately to be like that? It looks like ragged patches on the pants,isn't it? where did you buy it? how much? Class: A big laughter behind me Pa: At central and I lied him about its price  5 hours in math class and this joke was still all the time as we all know that the maths lecturers are about insanse.I have survived so long till this week.There was no teacher talked to me before. Next week,it will be more than this when I have to do a business at kasatsat university and will come in class with uniform. What will E'Sai say?  My family is out to Stake Lao in Sammagorn village meanwhile I am sufing a bit before off to my desk.

      online morning! Where is movement on MSN? heaven when I have just one whom I never chat to in my online contact list this morning. Life for this time is increditble since I have so much burden to do. I am so responsible,aren't I. My senior got the scholarship to stdy in France in human source studies by the lottary fund. very interesting that Mr.Taksin gives a chance to medium class to study aboard however it's risky that the quality of student can not be as เด็กทุน ก.พ. but it can show that all more than 100 students in this program will come back to this medium class or low to develop.The scholarship won't send student to USA and UK that's what I so pleased with.We have too much student from both countries without helping so much from that both counties in the other hand the education in Asia is going well,China.Japan.and former two countries seem very friendly to us This scholarship will take place around December of year.Last year is the first of this program which will receive the student from poor family but clever because the GPA must be very high(I can not remember how high maybe 3.50)and for sure perfect in English. Nam,the first year of Mahidol--I am so happy after read you diary,my dear I love you  Euro 2004,I have missed many matches! but it's good for me because they play so late at night  Yahoo(2Giga)VSGmail(1Giga) Which will I choose for my main e-mail service? very bloody in this business

      School Where can I go day except school...?Dancing class,I had Jadsada danced with me.Every step was good because we did not step on any toe.Jadsada's height is 180 cm (72 inches) therefor it was not a problem if he wanted to whirl me. Dancing is my new activity for this term. Holding guy's hands and dance and dance that's all. I CAN PERFORM ! My partner is so high(very and very high!)  My group still can not stop discussing Harry Potter.It was not exect story.I don't want to criticize but it was added something and cut something according to the book.All actors are getting cuter and cuter.I have seen nearly all Wesleys except Charlie and Bill.you know whom? I want to see Wood once again just hope he will appear in next movie of Harry Potter.They cut too much   England VS France   คือน้องภาก็ไม่ได้บ้าบอล แต่ก็มีทีมโปรดอะนะ คืออังกฤษ แต่ทีมนี้ก็แสดงให้น้องภาผิดหวังอย่างรุนแรงด้วยการปล่อยให้ฝรั่งเศษยิงเข้าประตู2ครั้งใน3นาทีทดเวลาเจ็บ คือน้องภารับไม่ค่อยได้เลย England is weak แล้วไงละวันนั้นนะอีภาแบบ English Blooded Paอย่างแรงแต่แม่งเน่าเลยวะ วัยรุ่นเซ็ง หรือมันอาจเกี่ยวกับที่เราไปเชียร์ป่าววะเนี่ย คือถ้าไม่เชียร์ทีมเขาอาจจะเจริญมากกว่านี้อะนะ นัดหยุดโลกจริงๆเลยงานนี้   Is science student clever?--Overall knowledge of Pa คืองานนี้น้องภาเซ็ง แล้วก็เป็นสิ่งเดียวที่ยังพอเป็นกำลังใจในชีวิต คือเราอาจจะยังฉลาดน่า คือแบบคนอื่นจะปลอบใจว่าแหม ได้น่า ได้อยู่แล้ว ฉลาดอยู่แล้ว อย่างน้อยก็ฉลาดไง ได้อยู่สายวิทย์ แต่  Thai-- I can not trace all letters in Thai ก ข ค ง จ ช ว ร ช่างเถอะวะ or distinguish the high sound letters or low sound Social-- Em...Thai history....Em...

       Do we learn too much in last year of high school? I never exactly realize till my friend,ploy,talked to me like this  Ploy: I have chemical equation which I want to inquire you  what's its product   2Ba + Na ------> ?   Pa: you must be crazy to do this "Sodium and Barium" Don't you see  haha Ploy: No,try again    use you brain,silly pa Pa: Bah, ok I don't want to have my name in science history,A girl who can compound Sodium and Barium Ploy: It's definitely   Ba + 2Na ------> Banana  and if you do this reaction which it is stimulated by light,It will be Banana Sundae  Pa: Shocked and Shocked :O What is happening to Ploy?  Not only Ploy but also Tai,she has an idea to study in food science so today she imagined about Padthai can and so on all chemistry class which the chem teacher got sick. I suspiciously talked to my friends in chem class while Vasarat seemed very indecent.   hey...guys sorry that I did not announce this news. I have participated in  urlLink science-maths Olympic  the test for finding the ingenious to be delegate of Thailand. I never hope to be haha. I just hope to do more than 30% of papers correctly.I will take Chemistry,Physics,Computer. Chemistry is ok to me and a bit also of Physics but my knowledge of Computer is naught  what is embedded? What is C+ language? All I know is about logistics  T ^ T= T T ^ F= F F ^ T= F  F ^ F= F   T or T = T T or F = T F or T = T F or F = F   T --&gt;T= T T --&gt;F= F F --&gt;T= T F --&gt;F= T     T &lt;--&gt;T= T T &lt;--&gt;F= F F &lt;--&gt;T= F F &lt;--&gt;F= T   haha what the hell above? It took me just 10 minutes to do it above,It's manifest how I am clever haha(&#3627;&#3621;&#3591;&#3605;&#3633;&#3623;&#3648;&#3629;&#3591;&#3623;&#3632;) only kidding guys..... I tremendously hope that it is correct all above.   My family had Pizza for free to day as a result My family went to Pizza Hut yesterday except me because I am on diet. My family had been waiting at the shop about 20 minutes at the mall before there was a vacant table to sit,still my dad had to wait at the table so long but there was on waiter to take the order. My dad called one waiter. The waiter told that he has so many customers so my dad have to wait longer or better change the shop. Of course, My family walked out. My dad soon called to the headquarter of Pizza Hut just wanted to complain politely. We did not expect to treat like this.   Around 16.00,There was the manager of Pizza Hut went to my home to say sorry with the biggest pizza. haha  I love that

       urlLink    finally,my gmail is rising up to 1% hehe  today is about the same as usual. 5 hours in maths class then the mall to eat an ice-cream before ending up at home alone.I was standing in front of the flower shop so long,making a decision if I would buy a flower to walk 3 rounds in the temple(one ceremony which we Buddhist do on this day). Not at last.I was a bit bored to do anything. I haven't done this since I was 10. hehe   chat and chat oh well Can I top this? I have chatted for 3 hours. I hope that I can spend so long time like this on revision.

      This is a good day not because the birthday of Buddha but because it is holiday. Oh yeah... I love this after all.  Dad and mum will go temple Nearly all my friends in the class will go to Watphykaew Pa will stay at home lol  Things to do,everybody -Purify your mind -Do not commit killing -Do good stuff  hope that one day,the world will be filled with those above. I feel so bored with the violence in the south-burning schools,killing monks,killing people,destroy chinese temple,attacking police,trying to involve religion,seperating to be independent Pattani and go on. The betrayal like this should be curified,burt alive etc. Hope that they will not go to kill buddhists today.  Have fun my friends at Wat--Pa will stay here --

      Blog? What is it? It's like a new one for Thai people because we all know as online diary which we have had it so long. It has been so long for me to encourage my friends to write their stories online or put something useful to read online. I will do&nbsp; specific blog next year,my topic depending on&nbsp;my team and what I&nbsp;choose to study.   Blog (n.) Short for Web log, a blog is a Web page that serves as a publicly accessible personal journal for an individual. Typically updated daily, blogs often reflect the personality of the author.&nbsp; (&nbsp;Oxford English Dictionary&nbsp; added it already)     &nbsp;   Blogging!  &nbsp; There are some hosts for Thais****     urlLink Story Thai&nbsp;    urlLink Diary Hub    urlLink Exteen    urlLink Kapook's Blog    &nbsp;   urlLink  &nbsp;

      Library!Monday is like nonsense for me.I don't think we have to do school on Monday.Dancing and Free time.Just really 2 subjects to do,Maths and Biology.   I got Ploy so mad.I am sorry but I don't want to pray again for contest.Why I have to do this when we did it so many times.I am online and finished 2 books in library.I am so sorry all the words when she called me on the line to go down and practice. oh yeah! We might win in praying contest! It's not my style really for this racing.I ever do contests but not someting concerning religion.Whose idea?  Another thing to think is my family set off to go to  urlLink Chumporn  with loads of my father's friends.It's a communal meeting in long weekend.Well I will stay at home for some reasons. so sad!

      &nbsp;I got SMS from Ploy at 3.30 am.She is reading and trying to wake us up for reading as well. No,Pa can not do that even by now she is online with zero online account on MSN.I miss them!&nbsp; I miss&nbsp; every single&nbsp; on MSN . haha&nbsp; Do you feel the same? or am I only dreaming?&nbsp; haha&nbsp; Nam and My aunt invited me to JJ market just I refused them.I want to do shopping .Can I throw all the classes this weekend.     Pre-Olympic    No one at our school pass the 1st round so don't dowload it. I have checked the result     Entrance Table for this October&nbsp;     9 Oct 04  8.30-10.30 Architecture  -------------------------------------------------------------------  12 Oct.04  8.30-10.30 Teaching  12.00-14.00 Engineering  15.00-17.00 French and others  -------------------------------------------------------------------  13 Oct. 04  8.30-10.30 Thai  12.00-14.00 English  15.00-17.00 Social  -------------------------------------------------------------------  14 Oct. 04  8.30-10.30 Physic  12.00-14.00 Maths (2)  15.00-17.00 Physical science  -------------------------------------------------------------------  15Oct. 04  8.30-10.30 Maths (1)  12.00-14.00 Biology  15.00-17.00 Chemistry   so why the first subject is Engineering for me?I just want to&nbsp;cry.It would break&nbsp; my confidence in Exams.Ok,I think I should get P'Koon to teach me in this subject.Everytime I ask,he just says do the old papers more.I wonder how high I can get.I get bored with P'koon and also jealous.He doesn't teach me at all.I do not take any adventage from having a brother in 1st year.   &nbsp;Chock dee!

      Sorry that I have disappeared on online communication.Maybe I would find time to come online about the suit time at night as usual but anyway I will have been like this about 2 months.I miss my online friends [T_T] very hard part to abandon the computer.I came just for checking things not chat.I will send my close friends to update my blog.&nbsp;  The news of Entrance Exams:  urlLink Scheme &nbsp;I know that most of my friends don't know about this.There are so many camps about Edu to take part in for this October. If anyone wants to be dentist,engineer etc. please hurry,I hope you can get the permission to go in the camp.For me I won't go to any camps just keep reading in October.   Hey! Quota as well,don't forget to check it out once a week. They are releasing quota.I feel great that after school I can see some of my friends discussing lesson on the benches.I know everyone tend to be concentrated however there are 40% of students pass.&nbsp;preparation for exams is tough&nbsp;and we bend backwards so don't be sad.I have drunk 40 mg of caffeine per day.It's fresh&nbsp;but not good for health.Can't help doing that,I will go to sleep so early without caffeine.I go to bed around 21.00 all this week.Biology is like a sleep pill even the caffeine is in your blood.    Gmail   If you want it just mail me :adipar at gmail dot com.I will invite you&nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;

He&nbsp;is growing a lot.Just 14 but seems far taller than me.  &nbsp;  We reached the Impact Arena around&nbsp;19.30 pm just before the concert 30 minutes with storming rain.I love her voice just like from the radio. Perfect!&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end of concert,I stood up and clapped my hands,shouting Whitney! whitney! till she came one again for her fans in Thailand.I danced so much for the last song.Just 2 girl danced in all line of seats(me and Nam).It was much fun last night.The Chula student just in front of me&nbsp;is so cute till the first song came out.I realized that what is he being.he deserves for boys not girl,haha.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  After all,we walked around Beer Garden.&nbsp;Almost Farangs and hot&nbsp;Thai &nbsp;girls. Including me?having fun there,taking&nbsp;a photo.&nbsp; Home around midnight  &nbsp;

      Thanks for Super Subs.You are the only one who made me laugh last night.Thank again but what the hell below? whatever!   I did not sleep all last night so that I could watch "Good Morning Thailand" at 5.30.Andrew Bigs teaching English in the morning is fun.I love that and I will love more if he is cute.And also I listened to Mr.Taksin's speech in AIDS conference.There is a boo,haha.  Will I go to Shumporn(in the south) in long holiday of next fortnight.I want to read more books and rest but I want to practice English with Mr.Steve and rest on the beach.That's a dilemma.I want a communal meeting between my father friends but I have got so many books to read.  I am waiting for this Wednesday which day we will have a good celebration for Suluck.Maybe I should let my friends design what I will wear for Whithey concert.I thought just small shirt and short skirt with high heeled shoes. yep that's my concept like I can play on TaTa's music VDO.Makeup as well,I am learning.

      Good News,I got through the final round of contest.Yesterday was very tough for me.Writing plan of experiment in the 1st round about plant's hormone.During we waited for the result my team(Supasert,Uschara,Me)were talking about university and sex in university and more and more. There were 7 schools in the final round which I haven't known the result yet.  1.Badindacha1 2.Badindacha2 3.Triamudom-pattanagarn 4.Triamudom-nomgaew 5.Satreevit2 6.Howang 7.Bangkapi  I hope that we chose the correct chemical equation to do.NaOH in the lab nearly burned my hand.The teacher from university in this contest was so unkind.We had to work with Pb(lead) [T_T]  I am skipping Thai class because it's raining and my group can not walk to another building.I haven't been touching any computers in Library so long.Hey It works well

      I have one contest to combat this morning,you guys........They will give me one problem then we have to design the experiment to show case.Carrying the name of Bangkapi School is one of the burdens that is hardest for me.I promise that I will exert all my powers and strength in my empty brain for this battle.  Mr.Taksin has gone to Aus and NZ to open the first free-trade between developed country and (slowly) developing country.Even Thailand has disadventage in this case but we are exceeding. everything has pros and cons.  Football for this season,we surely have Wayne Rooney wearing shirt with Beer Chang logo on.Even Mr. taksin scrapped the idea of shopping at Eigland but his idea has inspired all millionaires in Thailand to own football team like  urlLink Gmm (Grammy-the biggest song company), urlLink Beer Chang (having success in sponsoring Everton).I never thought we would have Thai products in international sport like this.At any rate, urlLink Red Bull  should join them,don't you think?

      I did Physics and Computer pre-olympic tests today. They were so hard. I could do 6 problems of physics out of 20 problems in 3 hours,still doing it in my free time today.It seemed there are too many problems in Electrical espcially AC [T_T]  Thanks for Kaew's Mobile:The time of  6/1    urlLink    My Group:Me, Chalida(sitting next to me),Nok(opposite me),Ploy(across me),Tai(behind me)  urlLink    What is they lay for?  urlLink    Dose he really concentrate?  urlLink    Actually,we are pretending to be studious  urlLink    Again!  urlLink    Kittipong and his English book(fave subject for science student!!)  urlLink    Poor Oat

      5.30: woke up 5.45: reading 5 chapters of chemistry 7.30: online & eating pizza  Pre-olympic of chemistry today at Badindacha1 School.I will go with Nok and Tai.It is so obvious that we can not even get through 1st round. haha   Short Hair  I did not want to make it surprise but I did,having my hair cut,just as short as my shoulders. The hairdresser was asking me about 4 times how short exactly I wanted to.Sometimes,short hair for girls is not beautiful for them anyway it is OK on me. Cooler,more comfortable,no need to brush you hair so much in the morning or even can get you smarter.    urlLink Mk's blog    I now and then visit his blog.His blog is about his own life style and technology(4th year of Engineering at KU)I like the way he criticizes movies like shake2 Kill Bill V.2 and more.We cannot deny that he is clever (Eng,KU) I hope I can pass Entrance Exams in the good faculty like him.My maths is so down. haha Maybe I can not survive like him through 4th.

      Thaksin  Shinawatra,Our Prime Minister I spent some time on searching and a lot results concerning him.In my view, He is the multiple man.Still the best PM that we ever have     urlLink Thaksinomics   Strong quotes which I like   English:   "Please don't intervene. Please leave us alone. It is my job and we can cope with this matter. We are trying to explain this to foreigners. But if they do not understand or ignore our explanation, I don't care because we are not begging them for food." - 1 May 2004, in a radio address concerning crackdowns on Islamic militants.

      For now I just want to change my Blog style from English to Thai. It must be deeper than English Blog. I mean I can express my feeling more but when I type in Thai then it seems to be incorrect writting as there are many wrong spellings.This is no longer my private Blog since there is my link around. My Blog traffic does not show me its popularity.There are still some but not much. Life is for Entrance really..........  New Website which I think it's fun     ::: Googig.com:::     where you can find new Gig(Gig=very close friend :in my view) from MSN ICQ Yahoo RIC AIM QQ BLOG Diary.  _ I have not checked on this site yet so I have no idea. Just the webmaster mailed me to promote this site. Google has become Googig_

      First os all,pa loves Chalida.Today is my friend's birhtday. have been for 6 years of this friendship.  Just few days ago,I felt so down.The only one I did call to was my aunt.She listened and this was her react "Hey Sizzler tomorow at the mall,ok?" I know how far from the central of Bangkok to Bangkapi.How I can find someone to substitute her.I sat with loneliness.It was gonna kill me somehow.Anyway,very nice to had my aunt at Sizzler as the previous post describes.It was the worse feeling ever.Like broken heart maybe.  Just give me a call if you are lonely,Suluck  Your farewell! Hey,don't forget to bring some to Germany.Ploy enlarged all the pictures and brought them to school.So many critics we have got.I have no idea how ploy could act like this in this picture(pink shirt on the right) like from front-page of Cosmo.     urlLink      I feel the same in the way of M.6 students have.So boring! The result of YES was out. urlLink Am I the 6th???
