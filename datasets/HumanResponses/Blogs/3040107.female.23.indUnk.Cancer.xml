      One of the biggest dilemmas of living in the Philippines and actually going around to discover it is deciding where to go. You have mountainous terrain, forests, fields, waters... If you choose one of them, say, waters --- then you'd have to decide which beach, lake, river, etc. If you decide on going to the beach, you'd have to choose which island or coastline. 7,107 islands: Where do you go?   So I decided to act almost on an impulse. The day after buying sunblock and a sarong, I hopped into a bus and headed for Batangas. No, it couldn't be Anilao. Most people draw a huge misconception that leaves them disappointed: Anilao is not a beach. It's a fantastic dive site instead.  Besides, if I can't swim, how can I enjoy scuba diving? I'd rather walk "IN" water, instead. =)  An hour later I'm across Anilao in the island of Maricaban showing up unannounced, as usual, in my friend's distant relative's house. (I still cannot trace the blood relationships between them though I did exactly the same thing last year!) As friendly island folk are wont to do, they welcomed me into their home. After almost an hour's hike across the island, voilà la plage!   I had a refreshing time. Still, I wish some of you were there.

      What is this but (a) yet another attempt to record occurrences that, though hilarious to me, have no grand impact on my life; (b) musings and crazy settings created with my face just a mere 3 inches away from someone's sweaty but Safeguard soap-smelling back and with my right hand tightly gripping the handrails of MetroStar Express --- You have to give credit to my morning rush hour intake of carbon monoxide and carcinogens in Cubao, they do stimulate the otherwise sleep-deprived brain cells.--- So if you were that person who shoved your way into that fast-moving can of sardines along EDSA this morning and managed to occupy a space next to me, be flattered that you were thought of, at least, and relish the thought that by the time I get off at Buendía, there'd now be a crazy BUT wholesome story starring you, and lastly, (c) fantasies, invitations to travel the world with me and write-ups about past travels.   I won't try to be philosophical about anything. After all, my philo notebook has more unphilosophical comments and drawings by me and my bestfriend Zageek than anything Teillard de Chardin said. I can't promise entertainment nor will there be chain letters, etc. for you to post on your own blogs or forward by email. he he.   Besos y abrazos!

      It's difficult waking up in the morning and going through the motions of the day: taking a Tabo-bath since the shower's broken), squeezing your carcass into that packed metro, etc.   Facing the day requires even more energy when you have to anticipate a board meeting of Frenchmen who, they seem to you, never listen to one another; who just talk and argue, and argue and talk, and complain. You wonder whether in the long discussions in French too rapid for you to comprehend, they actually accomplish and agree on something.   It's even harder when the first thing that dawns on you is a LIE. As I pushed the snooze button this morning, my first thought was, "Today is a Saturday."  Written on a Tuesday in Manila --- a day when the temperatures hit a high of 37 degrees C.

      I am a Charmed One. Unlike Phoebe, Piper, and Paige, however, I cannot vanquish demons, cast spells, mix potions, or call anyone from the dead. But like them, I do have this uncanny ability to attract unwholesome characters that can make your skin crawl with their daring. Now, if only I can blast them away with a potion, or if I could levitate myself out of this or that particular situation, everything would be just fine.   My total current readership of two may protest that I am using the wrong modifiers here. Let me excuse myself by saying that there is hesitance on my part to call myself a “charming” one, instead of Charmed One. I can surmise that the reason for this recalls a childhood memory revolving around that word and my determination not to be associated with it. When I was around 7 or 8 years old and Aiza Seguerra (a former child star turned gay acoustic singer) was successfully beating little Snooky Sernas (translation: Caucasian mestizas) in the Little Miss Philippines beauty tilt, my mother said that she isn’t “guapa” to Filipino eyes, but she is charming. Looking back and considering the present Aiza… well, I might just have been clairvoyant then.    Charm. I cannot honestly say that it is not helpful to have packets of it at hand. However, trouble brews when, like your imperfect locomotor skills, your charms are also off-target.   What has my particular brand of charms gotten me (into) during the past couple of years?   1. Stalkers and admirers. The problem with this is that the people I’d consider sane, normal, and even just a bit acceptable are not the ones who'd offer to buy me coffee. Try being a Filipina on vacation in a foreign country where your grasp of the language extends only to making certain you know what’s there on the menu, and you’ll know what I mean. With the mongrel looks of a typical Filipina it only takes a few hours of sightseeing before someone blocks your exit out of a telephone booth to ask if you’re Algerian. Then it’d take several more “Pardon, Monsieur(s)?” to finally realize that this smelly North African with bloodshot eyes wanted more from you than that you tell him the time. After several more “sightings” and “close encounters” with the same person, you panic and concede that perhaps, you did inherit your mother’s acute paranoia.   Oh, don’t worry. The serious “apparitions” are just a handful of times a year but the variety has a wide range. If you’re game, you have a lot to choose from: impoverished sidewalk painters plying on tourists’ “needs” for souvenirs, but who’d willingly leave their trade just to wait for you at the exit of a museum; wealthy middle-aged CEOs who are probably married; confused atheists who look like Justin Timberlake; North African (Algerian, of course, and Moroccan and Tunisians, too) immigrants who mistake you for their own women; good-looking Latino missionaries who freak out your friends when they start preaching--- could be the same Latino missionary who’d invite you to join him for a romantic tryst in the.. TA…DAA… toilet. Throw in a lonely old man tossing a frisbee to keep his dog happy while he chats you up; or idiots who still wonder where you got the Latin exuberance and rhythm; and oh yeah, don’t forget that creep who starts planning the vacations you’ll be taking together two hours after you met him. The list goes on… So, to anyone who shares the same plight as me but who gets a high knowing that someone’s stalking her, “Ride the UN Carousel, girl!”  A piece of advice:  Thanks to 3 centuries in the Spanish convent, half a century of Hollywood, and more than a millennium of Sino-Malay interaction, the Filipino is a mongrel --- though one that’s unusually good-looking, intelligent, and with a good singing voice. So, if you’re a Filipina who craves this kind of attention, I recommend Europe. “Diyosa labas mo, ‘Day!” The place is crawling with people who absolutely gawk at our naturally bronzed looks and for some, slanted eyes. Little do they know that minus my roommate and I, this country is probably the biggest market for skin whitening products. (Heck, even our office messenger who’s male, by the way, came in one day looking like lechon ---- roasted pig ---- after applying Maxi-Peel, when he knows his job requires being under the sun for hours!)   Continuing on the agonies of a Charmed One… let me quote from Albert Camus who said, “Charm is getting the answer yes without asking a clear question.” It should apply here.  2. Alternative careers. Interesting job opportunities land on my lap after meeting the top guys in exhibits, etc. These should have paved my path to wealth and greatness; unfortunately, they’re never quite what I envisioned I’d be when I grow up. =)  Sales. People I met banked on what they perceived as my asset, so much that I’d actually gotten job offers to sell (drumroll, please…) VIAGRA! Not ordinary Viagra but Female Viagra. This particular CEO probably thought that this charm could actually convince Filipinas to openly admit dissatisfaction in their bedroom activity and turn to Viagra. Imagine? Sell Female Viagra in a country where in a lot of places, it is still taboo to talk about sex?  Global Yaya. Kids take a liking to me almost instantly. When I visited a distant relative’s Fil-Am kids, it was as if I were one of their playmates back home. Or worse, the five year old asked in a loud voice, “WERE YOU SENT HERE TO ENTERTAIN US?”  Entertainer. Need I say more?  Kidnapper. If I’d ever consider this career path, I’d be a success if the target market is composed of two-to-seven year old kids. In France, parents were actually very surprised when their toddlers either ran into my arms to be carried or unnoticed by them, five-year olds actually made pa-cute and posed as I aimed the camera at them. Since I took so many photos of kids, my companions were beginning to suspect I was a pedophile.   Tour Guide for Senior Citizens. Bottom line is that I’m not only a hit with toddlers but also with the elderly. On their last day at the hotel, two old American ladies gave me hugs in the dining room. Reason: It was so sweet of me to relay to the French kitchen staff that they need table napkins. What can I do? My grandmother raised me!  It’s not all bad. Charms can work to your benefit at times. The thrill is certainly there because you’ll find yourself in interesting situations. Demons and the rest of them can make life out of the ordinary. And if you have the kind of humor that I have, you’d certainly enjoy captivating everyone around.   Just keep that potion at hand.   Have a nice day FIONA and CARINE!

      Somebody posted this survey in friendster bulletin. I thought it would make an interesting blog.      if you had more time alone, you would... Add some more cash to this proposition and I would be at an isolated beach by myself --- contemplating why I’m alone and happy being such in this lovely cove/beach!   if you could change anything about the  world... Make it untouchable and quickly renewable so that Man with all his free will cannot easily conquer it.   if you had a plane ticket to anywhere in the  world, you would visit... any of the following:    New Zealand, to learn the HaKa   Prague or Kiev   Alaska, to take lots of pictures   Corsica or Sicily, for a feel of “old danger”   An oasis somewhere…    However, I would also like to see more of my country so I’d probably insist that that int’l trip be converted into domestic flights to the following destinations, in no particular order: ·	Palawan (Coron, El Nido, Busuanga) ·	Camiguin (This little island has virtually everything: rivers, hot springs, cold springs, white sand beaches, active volcanoes, waterfalls… What more could one ask?) ·	Batanes (The primitive, the unspoiled, the untouched beckons…) ·	Old Vigan including a side trip along the rugged Ilocos coastline and the beaches of Pagudpud.  ·	Davao (to see Mt. Apo and be immersed in the thriving indigenous cultures that call it home).   if you could live anywhere in the world, you  would live in... a very private beachfront property somewhere in my own country.   if you could ask God one question, it would  be... How can you be so patient?  And if I could tell Him/Her anything other than the usual heartfelt THANK YOU, it would be… Thank goodness I’m not you.    if you could, you would spend time with this  famous person... George W. Bush, so I could tell him he’s delusional   if you could be famous, you would like to be  famous for... single-handedly turning the Phil. economy around.   if you could magically change one thing in  your physical appearance, it would be... to get rid of these adipose deposits that make me shake in all places.   if you were stranded on a deserted island, you  would want these three people with you...    I can only think of two:  My bestfriend Zagu because it wouldn’t be boring at all. Even if it’d take ages for a rescue team to arrive, we’d have fun sketching on barks and leaves, weaving stories with silly plots and etc.   Atchi Karen --- she’s HANDY to have around (LOL). She’d make sure the bayawak is cooked gourmet-style, and that I eat it, too. Also, she would never permit me to succumb to uncivilized / barbaric tendencies such as, cook my fish without any wild herb to flavor it.  She’d also probably be the only one who would know what to do.    the first thing you would do on a deserted  island... Get some sleep then find some food.   if you were in prison, you would spend  time... practicing the dance steps and songs from “Chicago” especially “Cell Block Tango.” No, honestly, I’d call on zagu and chiqui to rescue me.    if you could erase one memory... I would erase that episode when I had to choose between two people I cared about and its negative consequences on one of them.   if you could choose your age of  death... can’t answer this at all, at all.    if you could bring back one person from the  dead --- Jose Rizal. May I just say that I blush when I study or read his love letters to his many girls? How come nobody writes like him anymore?   if you were a beverage or cocktail, you  would be... a mujito.

      1. Attended a friend's birthday party in white Moroccan garb with golden embroidery around the neck. This particular outfit has virtually no sleeves and no sides, either. It was like wearing a tablecloth! Brrr...  2. Watched a classical guitar performance by the Duo Astor.  3. Fête de la Musique. Good thing my officemate and I were there early. We managed to witness the performance of the bands that mattered before a sudden thunderstorm called a halt to the whole thing. The stage was a crumpled heap by 11pm.  4. Attended the opening of the French Film fest and stood next to Gardo Versoza. Apparently, he's in the film entitled, "Au Bout du Rouleau," shot in the Philippines, produced and directed by a French group. The cast's composed of Pinoys, too.  7. In the same opening night, I also saw this veteran movie/stage actor I was supposed to kiss in a botched college prod.   8. Finally got to watch Harry Potter 3 last Sunday and enjoyed it immensely. Last night, I watched Harry Potter 2 on HBO.  9. Broke my record of posting 1 blog per month. This one will make 3 for this week! WOW! Sometimes, I do amaze myself.  10. Has been keeping up correspondence with an Italian-Australian guy via friendster. He is soooo in love with his Pinay girlfriend. I tried writing a line or two in Italian. Now, he's writing to me IN Italian. Does babelfish still work? He he.   11. Been house-sitting for my Grandfather's apartment for almost two weeks now. It's been great. I've also been out almost every night, though.   12. Under much pressure, I tried my hand at designing covers for membership cards using Adobe Photoshop. Was able to come up with 6.  13. Handed in my resignation letter and I've been officially unemployed since June 16. However, I'm still here finishing up some projects and getting paid on a daily basis.  14. Applied to just one job yet.  15. Been wondering about my telos.  16. Met two french guys, T and M, in the MRT. With the right side of my face 2 inches away from M's armpit, I managed to strike up a conversation in French.  Bah, oui! Ça va, ça va...  Turns out that the other guy with them, N, is Atenean! Small world.  17. A Girls' Night Out could be translated into an all-night dancing. Last night, some friends and I went to Sanctum, a great indie bar carved right into the walls of Intramuros. Samba/Salsa/Bossa nova fanatics that we are, we wanted to witness the last performace of Guarana at Sanctum before the bar officially folds up in July. Needless to say, the dancing was great, especially when the singer started teaching us basic samba steps.   18. Had the flu soon after.

      I grew up with both sets of parents under the same roof but it was Lola (grandmother) who raised me up. It was she who exposed me to all the good smells and flavors of the kitchen. The results?  1. I have a sharp tongue, mataray, and a helplessly critical about, um, food! I find unpalatable food served before me in restaurants an insult to my taste and often, couldn't help but voice it out.  2. I still feel guilty when the pots and pans aren't sleek, shiny, and scrubbed to its last millimeter of steel or copper, as if Lola was behind me with her  binugha  (firewood). Even with her petite frame, she was tyranny personified. In fact, she was a Marcos loyalist. 'Nuff said.  Perhaps, she was also a witch. I like thinking about her this way because it lends so much color to the 16 years I spent with her. Lola's legacy (my inheritance from her) was more valuable than the ring, which I lost 5 months after she died. Part of this are the small nuggets of wisdom, charms and spells, that I'm sure, I'll pass on to my children.  1.  Spider webs as wound treatment.    Once upon a time when I was five and bored, I decided to see what would happen if I stuck my finger between the electric fan blades. The thing was turned on, of course, and consequently, the Sunday morning hum-drum was chased away by gushing blood and wails of terror. Care to guess the treatment? a. Clean wound with soap and water. b. Scour ceilings and corners for spider webs. Wrap web around finger (over any wound, as the case may be).  It healed quite quickly after that.  2.  Matters related to teeth.    Straight teeth.  Several months ago, my dentist asked me if I had worn braces before. To his amazement, I proceeded to tell him what my grandmother did. When I was very young, she massaged my gums and teeth regularly with her fingers. Perhaps not very witch-like but they did make braces or retainers unnecessary.  Strong choppers. Insert the first tooth extracted from a kid into a crack in the house's main pillar. This will ensure teeth as strong as the pillar itself. Sometimes, I doubt the efficacy of this one ---my dentist told me I still have 6 more cavities to be filled.  Then I'd remember that, a. I have not been very diligent in my teeth duties; b. I've never had any cause to be afraid of the dentist (a root canal, for instance.) Needless to say, I concede that perhaps, the ritual helped.   3.  Menstruation  This rite of passage actually involves a long list of rituals! Like several of my cousins from my Father's side, I had my period early at age 9. To prevent endless teasing on  pagdadalaga  ahead of time, this was kept a secret. On that first day, nevertheless, the cousins and neighbors playing outside our house were perhaps to engrossed to notice that:  a. I had been running around the house's perimeter and up the stairs 3 times. This was supposed to counter the lethargy of "Meron ako" days. The "3" times probably refers to the usual 3 days of heavy flow.  b. I jumped the 3 steps. Same reason as above.  c. The following were rubbed on my face:    - a ball of cotton    - the petals of a red gumamela    -  the  undies with the first specter of blood    Reason: These are supposed to ensure a blemish-free, rosy-cheek complexion.   d. I was told to eat nothing sour or acidic for the duration of the period. It would chase the period away and give me an ache in the  puson  (abdomen).  e. I was lectured to stay out of the rain when until the period's over. Could it be because of the "acid" rain? He he.   4. More on good skin. (Have I mentioned that my grandmother was rather vain and proud of her white  kili-kili  or armpits?)  To prevent deep noticeable scarring (keloids or those of lesser degree), the baby must, during his/her first bath, be rubbed all over with a glass bottle to the following incantation:   Manundog ka sa botilya, hamis, way bu-ak    Be like the glass bottle, without scars, without cracks, smooth...) This is recited over and over again.  Efficacy:  Proven . I recommend this especially if you think your kid will be accident-prone like me, or if you were sure you'd be passing on "pimple-generating" genes to your kid.   5. Payment for life extensions.  Perhaps it is a pagan Visayan custom because a lot of people could relate to this one. Not a birthday would pass by without Lola killing a live chicken right in our kitchen. She would then take a bit of the chicken blood and rub it on my forehead, forming the cross sign as she did so. The chicken was supposed to have been sacrificed for that particular new year in my life. Talk about inculturation!  Of course, everyone would notice the bloody cross on my forehead and greet me happy birthday without any questions.  6. Active minds and charmingly talkative, agressive kindergarteners  My cousins and I did not experience any separation anxiety on our first day of school. Same thing went for the other neighborhood kids who were also in my age group.  On the first day of kindergarten, Lola roasted corn kernels in a stovetop pan. On our way down the stairs out of the house, she showered us (cousins and neighbors included) with the corn kernels, saying over and over,   Manundog kamo sa mais. Magpiti-piti inyong bâbâ!   (Something like: Let your mouths be like the crunchy corn kernels. Noisy.)  In other words, it was a prayer and a send-off to be agressive, active participants in class. It may have worked. I think two of my cousins were often cited for being too talkative. Nobody bullied any of us, either.   7. Kontra Biyahilo (Anti-motion sickness) I was travelling to Tacloban with my coach to attend a Regional Quiz Bee. Thinking that the zigzagging mountain roads might enduce me to get sick on the way, she made me place a matchstick near my belly. Perhaps, it was inside a small plastic bag (used for ice candy) and pinned to the waistline of my school uniform.   I could not remember the reason for this. I could not even vouch for its efficacy, either, since I have never really been prone to motion sickness. The "game" but perpetually woozy ones among you can try it, though.   These are just a few of local customs and rituals handed down to me from my beloved lola peling. For sure, there'll be a Lola Series #2.

      More than a week before the actual Venus in Transit phenomenon, I panicked. It was already 1:45pm and I thought I had missed it. I kept peering outside my boss' window hoping I could still catch a glimpse of it. To my utter disappointment, there seemed to be nothing special going on in the heavens.  The following day, the newspapers told me that I was 9 days ahead in my watch. Whew! This time, I set an alarm in my cellphone. It would go off ten minutes before 1:12PM, 8 June 2004, so that I would have time to get myself to the roofdeck.   8 June 2004 (12:30nn)  Armed with film negatives, my officemates and I climbed up to the roofdeck. There was supposedly a typhoon that morning so it was not sure whether we'd get to see it at all. Eagerly, we checked the noontime skies for any sign of this once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon. Pretty soon, we were letting out incomprehensible shrieks of delight! Great! We were actually a part of history!   June 9, 2004, Philippine Daily Inquirer:    What dot moving across the sun? Did anyone see a dot?     Putsa.

      The north wind calls, its beckoning gaining force.  Impatient now, ruby slippers go clickety-clack, leading me to every direction.   How do I heed the call of both wind and footwear with only a few hundred pesos?   Ce n'est pas tout d'avoir une imagination fertile, il faut le faire.
