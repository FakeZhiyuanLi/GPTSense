      Today was a cool day because my family and I went to the beach and had a lot of fun.  We went boogie board for most of the day and then my step brother and I just swam in the water which I might add was really cold.  We were all sandy when we got in the car but my parents did not care.  Now Im worried that my dad know that im talking to the friend that I supposidly broke up with cause I was switching between windows and I think he saw the e mail but I know that I should not stress over it. Its my life and Ill deal with it how I want.

      Wow. Today was a very hard day for me because I had to stop being friends with one of my best friends because it was an unhealthy friendship. But I'm glad that I did it. It took me a long time to realize that it was an unhealthy friendship because I was in denial.  But even my friends and family kept telling me that I need to break it off because it was affecting me in such a radical way. I will always remember him.

      UURRRGGG!!! I'm sooo sad. My mom said that we could possibly get a dog we saw on an adoption website. Then today when we were going to go see the puppy, she said that we didn't have enough money because Im getting braces soon. I wonder if Im being too selfish... hmmmm... My friend slept over last night and one thing that I realized about him is that he smells like a wet dirty dog EEEWWW. So many people want me to go to their houses for a fourth of July party. I cant decide which persons house to go to cause I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings. Decisions decisons.....

      Ahhh... This is my first time writing a blog and I am happy that i am. What an interesting name. BLOG. I spent the night at my friends house and we had a lot of fun playing Counter- Strike. He's so happy that Im getting him an airsoft gun for his birthday.  I cant wait for my friend Mike to come back from piano camp.  I also cant believe that he got wasted up there in Stockton, CA. I need to do more exploring on this website.
