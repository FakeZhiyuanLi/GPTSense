         Week 1      Nebraska   reneged  on his promise to submit  fresh writing . He didn't mean to. He fully intended to bring something new, untried for him. But one thing led to another and the next thing he knew Thursday had arrived and he had nothing interesting to bring to the table.   While it frustrated his literary journal mates, their annoyance with him was nothing compared to Nebraska's annoyance with himself. And he was sure that they talked about him after he left the meeting that night, uttering all sorts of denigrating, superior comments behind his back, because none of them was brave enough to say anything to his face.   Thing was, Nebraska was as big and solid and friendly as his namesake state and people constantly misread him. His open, placid face and linebacker body hid a love for and facility for the written word. It was a talent he didn't even know he possessed until a knee injury at Ohio State ruined his chances of ever playing pro football.   Not that he minded. He'd played football all of his life because, as a boy that grew big and strong and burly much earlier than any of his classmates, that's what he was expected to do. And he was a very good linebacker. But he didn't enjoy it. Not the way he enjoyed reading.   That didn't matter to his dad, though. An old alumni of Nebraska State and second string running back, he was determined that his son have the sports career he wasn't talented enough to have. Nebraska's knee injury seemed like a personal affront to the old man. And maybe it was. As painful as the cracked kneecap and torn ligaments were, the young linebacker thought his now valid excuse for leaving the gridiron was a godsend.     Week 2    So maybe, when the fullbacks were headed straight for him, he didn't try as hard as he could have to get out of their way. His usual agility and  finesse , rather uncommon for someone his size, seemed to desert him for a split second. And that split second was all that was needed to find him under a dogpile of young men his size or bigger. The football popped from his strong hands and landed outside the bruised battery of players that blocked the gray November sky from his view. As the referee blew his whistle the pigskin wobbled uncertainly, almost seeming confused by its sudden abandonment.   Nebraska's father let him know - in no uncertain terms - that he noticed the boy's hesitation in the face of the opposing defense. As he shouted at his son for what he saw as the kid's cowardice Nebraska's mother walked in the hospital room. For the first time that he could remember, the tiny quiet woman esesentially shut the old man up with a fire neither of them had ever seen. His father never brought up Nebraska's perceived cowardice again. But he still treated the injured player with barely concealed disappointment.

         Week&nbsp;3     His parents' marriage, never the easiest of unions, took on an additional tension after his injury. He felt bad for the renewed, if unspoken,  acrimony  that darted between his mother and father, but he honestly couldn't regret that barely conscious hesitation. Besides, the old man now looked at his wife with a tentative respect that had never been there before. How could Nebraska ever regret anything that caused such a miracle?   After he had healed enough to go back to classes he realized that he had to find something to replace the credits lost due to no football. Lucky for him it was close enough to the end of term that he could start up with a new subject with no lost time during the next term. During the break he poured over the catalog, searching for something to take the place of football. He wanted something creative, for once.   Art? No. Film? Not interested. Acting? No way in hell.   Then he saw the description of the creative writing course. It appealed to him in a way that little else in school ever had. He loved to read, had actually started when he was three, which pleased his librarian mother, even if his father had barely taken an interest, reminding them not to let the books get in the way of his athletic duties.   Nebraska had never told anyone, not even his mother, that whenever he had a moment of down-time he liked to jot down ideas. All sorts of ideas. Story ideas, character ideas, snippets of dialogue. Sometimes even lines that he heard as music in his head, so he called them songs. He had always been afraid to tell anyone about these ideas or the 500 word essays and fiction he sometimes dashed off between classes or under his blanket in his dorm room. He was sure everyone would make fun of the big dumb jock with the John Irving complex and if there was one thing Nebraska had learned to hate over the years it was being laughed at by people who assumed they knew who he was just by looking at him. As a consequence his hundreds of notebooks, filled over the course of fifteen years, sat unseen in boxes under his bed and in the attic where no one ever went except for him.

         Week&nbsp;4     Those thoughts ran through his mind again, the old  nightmares  threatening to stop him, but he remembered how satisfying his minute moment of rebellion had felt, how proud he was of his mother's bravery in the face of his father's unreasonableness, and he felt he owed it to both of them to put aside his fears, to at least give writing a serious attempt. If his peers laughed at him - or worse, he wasn't any good - well, he wouldn't die from mortification. At least, he didn't think he would.    First thing's first,  he thought. He would show some of his writing to his mother. True, her first instinct would be to protect her baby boy from any unkindness - even from herself - but, though she tended to be timid, Nebraska knew she would be gently honest with him. Her love of the English language was second only to her love for her son and both would ensure that she wouldn't let him live with illusions that might ultimately cause him disappointment.   When he told her his secret a combination of pride and hurt flashed across her face, but the pride won out. She required no explanation for his need of secrecy, understanding his reticence even with her. She was happy that her son had at last confided in her.
