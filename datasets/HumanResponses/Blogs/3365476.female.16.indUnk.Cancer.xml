         Sometimes...its really hard to know how some one is thinking...dun understand why do ppl not forgive one another...well...its not as if they themselves din provoke others rite...i believe that they themselves would desperately pray for the other party's forgiveness...however if they themselves are not willing to forgive others...how would others forgive them then...?     Human nature...people resort to despicable means in order to get wad they desire...though they claim to let it go...but why do they still persist behind the scene again? Its realli strange...strange till i begin to doubt my surroundings...sayings can be one...while what they do could be exactly the opp...why it is like tat? Perhaps...thats so called human nature ba...     Today is feeling so pissed...getting my bad results is one thing...then...ppl juz hav to be so sarcastic abt their results...worse thing is that they recite non stop....haiz...so irritated that i threw my pen on the table and walked out of class...luckily no teacher around...haiz...the day is realli bad...once again...

         First time posting here...in fact juz registered in here...well...i decided to record down all my thoughts and feelings...so that if one day i should have my memories erased off...i still have this left...       Life's getting tough...i have to admit that...everything is getting out of hand...mid yr exam results really brings me so much disappointment...but still i tried to keep myself happy so as not to bring down my frens mood...however...once i got home...conflicts juz keep arising btw friends...one after another...smt...i really wish that they put themselves in my shoes...but no one did...even my closest friend din...kinda disappointed with her...well...its really a bad day today...     Love? well...kinda immune by this word...its getting tiring and tiring...to hang on and stuff like tat...maybe i boarded the wrong bus in the beginning...now hopefully this bus would turn its direction and bring me to the destination i want...its kinda impossible to ask me to get down from the bus now...cuz its juz so impossible...well..i realli can't afford and bear to part with this bus...realli cant...

         Netball camp juz ended today...kinda fun hanging out with my team players...kept on toking and crapping around...though its a netball camp...but we din realli participated in those games...not bcuz those games were boring...but its that we arent realli happy with those organizing the camp...haiz...tout the seniors were there to be intructors...ended up being normal members...first time encounter this kinda thing...well...we stayed in a class...some did their hw...not me of cuz...and the others listening to songs...chatting away...then came ms chua...and kinda giv us a lecture that we didnt join in the rest...its hard to explain...so no one did...but kept in silence...for wad we sae might offend her...haiz...     The night was fun...though we went to mop and scrub the hall after the flour fight...kinda disappointed in the juniors though...thought they would volunteer to clean up but everyone end up sittin on the stairs and watching us seniors clean...worst thing is they think that all these shld be our job...haiz...anyway it was fun to walk in bare foots ard the sch, hunting for cloths to wipe the floor...haha...and we went thru dark passengeway...with everyone trying to scare themselves for nothin...including me of cuz...well...we 'stole' stall one cloth...that they hung on those window grills...thw white cloth became grey...after he clean up...haha...though we feel guilty...but wads done is done...     okie...believe in fortune telling? haha..no harm giving it a try...a junior helped me in that...haiz...quite bad though...but doesnt seem to hav any impact on mi anymore...perhaps the heart has becum numb already....     Wanted to have some star gazing session...but too bad there wasnt a single star in the sky...such a disappointment...hence we hav to walk back frm the bb court back to the hall...haiz...camp breaks at 8am...which is a funny thing to mi...thought it will oni end in the afternoon...haha...so went hme to slp after that...     Today's my bdae...but dun realli hav the mood to celebrate...its the first time i felt this wae..in the past...i always enjoyed this occasion of mine...haiz...received many calls..msgs...greetings...realli touched to know that those silly friends of mine waited till twelve and rmb to send me greetings...touched by wad some of them says...nearly cant controlled my tears...and how i wish they were right beside me...felt like givin them a hug...well...aprt frm that..i waited and waited...until now...didnt want to slp...however...despite all these hrs...juz didnt get to receive a greeting frm him...well...its ok though...didnt expected to...but duno y juz couldnt bring myself to slp...     Tml eating out with friends at marina bay in the evening...hopefully i can bring myself to smile and stay cheerful...haiz...
