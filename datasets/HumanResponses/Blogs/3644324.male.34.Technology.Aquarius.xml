      I saw Micheal Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 on the weekend. Before I go any further I will make confess the following biases:   I am Canadian I perceive the American Presidency to be an awesome responsibility that must exceed even the most brilliant and moral person's capabilities. If the U.S. were to offer me the opportunity to vote I would spend a great deal of time assuring myself I understood which chad lined up with which candidate and then I would punch out the one beside whoever was most likely to garner more votes than George W. Bush. I have a difficult time believing in huge conspiracty theories as I am inclined to agree with a quote attributed to Abraham Lincoln that says "You can fool some of the people some of the time and all of the people some of the time, but you can't fool all of the people all of the time." I believe that while politicians, in North America at least, are generally well intentioned people, they are susceptible to being misguided.  So, that said, I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it to anyone interested in the subject matter, though I would caution you that it contains many graphic and disturbing images that no child should be exposed to under any circumstances - images that are still bouncing around, causing trouble, inside my skull.  Mr Moore's film suggests the following, actually it suggests many more things but I'll limit my discussion to:  George W. Bush and his administration were responsible for Sept 11 due to their laziness and incompetence in the summer before the attacks occured. George W. Bush is not intelligent. The Saudi royal family is evil. The BinLaden family is evil and supporting Osama The Bush family is in the pocket of the Saudi royal family. George W. Bush is waging the war in Iraq to benefit defence contractors that his family, friends and the House of Saud have investments in and oil companies. The Iraqi people are not better off after their "liberation". The troops in Iraq are in a horrible situation because they believe they are there to help but the Iraqis don't see it that way   I don't think that the film manages to overwhealmingly prove most of its assertions but it definitely provides disturbing information and makes you question the administration's methods and intentions. This is a political film but putting that aside it still captures the viewer and holds your attention throughout. Well done.

       Swarmy Swarmers!    After I finished toweling off I reached down and dug my wallet out of my bag. I found the twenties and handed them to the waiting hand across the bed. I thought with pleasure about all we'd done today and the other four times I'd been here.    "Well, Kevin, thanks a lot. I feel so much better now.", I said as I got up to leave.    "No problem Glenn. I guess I'll see you...." Kevin paused expectantly.   "I'm sure it won't be very long before I'll need you again." I said with a chuckle.    "Remember what I said about tomorrow night!" were the last words I heard as I walked out the door.    And exactly what were those words?    I should go to the Ultimate field tonight, put on my cleats, warm up with the team, and then when they go out to play, I should practice running and stopping, running backwards, jumping, and moving side to side to get my calf used to doing all the things I'd be doing in a game situation. Kevin really is a good physiotherapist, I highly recommend him and all the folks at the Metrotown Orthopedic Sport Physiotherapy Clinic. So, I probably won't be playing too much tonight. I may jump on for a point or two if things feel really good.    So since this is almost certainly the last week I won't be participating full-time, I suggest that we go out there tonight and unleash a devastating torrent of Ultimate whoop-ass on the team that is scheduled to beat us tonight. I say we show them the Swarm like they've never imagined. I want them to have nightmare's where all they see is Pete catching hucks in the endzone with the soundtrack of us shrieking "Cindy to Cindy to Cindy to Verlane to Cindy to Paul to Cindy to Lindsay to Lisa to Cindy to Pete" as we march down the field. I want them to remember the smell of their Loserdom, or maybe their Loserhood, or possibly Loseritude.    Okay, I really just want to know where we're going afterwords, that other stuff was just me talking big for no reason.    See you tonight.    Scorned Peon

      This morning I got out of bed annoyed The weekend gone and fading fast away My zest for life sure needed to be buoyed Instead of joy I felt only dismay  My morning inspiration burned my lip Not sipped on banks of Seine or Bosporus shore But guzzled down before my workbound trip Less soaring hawk than prisoner of war  Once out of doors and on my way I found That life today had other plans for me Friend sun in azure sky shone all around Bouquets on darling wind my liberty  The clouds within my head I let them go And with the sunny breeze today I'll row     a sonnet for a change of pace

      So I was walking out of Safeway....oh wait, that was last week when that didn't happen to me.   So, I was sitting in a comfy chair on a hot soon-to-be-summer evening a little after 6pm. All around me people were running and falling and getting up and standing and sweating and drinking water and griping and running some more and throwing and catching and occasionally not catching. It all seemed rather complicated and no one could really explain the reasoning behind it to my satisfaction. After a while I just gave up trying to comprehend it and settled on talking to the cute girls that would wander over and sit beside me for a while. Then after a few hours half the people got up and walked to the other side of the field and started doing the same sorts of things but with a lot more yelling, and still more yelling, then a little bit of pushing and then everyone seemed to lose interest. Oh well, I enjoyed the sitting in the sun. Maybe next week I'll try some of that running and yelling and stuff.   And in conclusion, let's have some compliments, I've got some for each of you.   Cindy Chan:  you're game last night could be summed up by your signature line "throw me the disk bitch!" - nice job expecting the disk and then getting it, and then throwing it and then getting it again and then throwing it and... with your current rate of improved play you'll be playing in the Worlds by September.   Cindy Ong: you were exploiting the Cindy-Cindy connection last night. If we could get a third Cindy the three of you could play offence without the need for anyone else. Brilliant!!!   Lindsay: stellar cuts (even when egregiously looked off) plus wonderfully wanton display of schoolyard scorn - my hero   Lisa:  that play where you ran back into our endzone....and smacked the disk away....from that guy....in the first game....you know the guy who was trying to catch it....masterful   Mel:  is she a charismatic, up and coming, recording artist? Is she a scorned chauffeur? Is she a gazelle on the Ultimate field? Don't hurt yourself thinking about it, the answer to all three is a resounding YES!   Verlane: the back-to-back huge "D"'s in the first game, extraordiary - not bitch slapping the arrogant morons in the second game, priceless   Geoffrey Crofton: once again with the "A" game. Will the accolades and adoration of your team mates be enough to keep you here or will your desire to "get paid" lead you to sign the big contract elsewhere.   Geoffrey Loomer: highly under rated performance. Virtually error free Ultimate: no dropped disks, your check never scored, no disks thrown away, best plus-minus of all the men, you didn't even break a sweat. Possibly the best division 1 performance by any male Swarmer to date.   King: the gentlemen all greatly appreciated you sloppy seconds last night - that huck to Peter in the endzone almost made me cry....so beatiful, sniff, sniff   Paul: masterful throws up the sideline - genius. the play where you wiped out Peter and the two a__holes in the second game will live on in Swarm lore for days   Peter: catch in the endzone + another catch in the endzone + (well you get the point) + that one flick in a game situation - you got game now baby!!!   Roger: you are really starting to get the hang of this game, if only you'd learn to stick up for yourself... Brilliant game as always.

       Lying in bed. Warm, asleep, comfortable, dreaming, it's all good. WHAM! WHAM! "What the fuck!" WHAM! Now sitting bolt upright in bed, confused, scared, disoriented, mostly stupid. And... "What the fuck was that!" It sounded like someone was attempting to punch through the sliding glass doors in our bedroom. Not exactly a thought that is easily processed at 5:27am. In fact my brain easily processes no thought before 8am unless I've been awake for half an hour or have consumed a liter of coffee. I've been awake for 3 seconds; there's no coffee.   I nudge the hamster in my head out of his stupor and begin to come up with plausible explanations for this rude awakening. I look towards the window (genius! thousands of years of evolution are definitely kicking in with this survival level stuff) and in the dim pre-dawn light, through the somewhat translucent blinds, I can't see anyone standing at the window. Well that's good, I guess. I look some more and I continue to see no one. Okay then. The hamster is getting up to 1/4 speed and has come up with "Maybe you imagined it", the hamster is lazy and really just looking for a way to explain the situation that allows him to go back to sleep but I have to admit that I like the idea. The only problem is that I notice my wife has also awoken and is looking at me with a "deer lying on the road after getting clipped by a Toyota and staring into the headlights of the big rig that is about to finish it off" (read: scared, sleepy and confused) look that convinces the hamster that something did happen. Damn.   Well, 10 seconds have elapsed at this point and as there currently appears to be no masked assailant killing me the scared has mostly receded. Confusion is still pretty prevalent and stupid is a definite overriding theme but it is still before 5:30 so I'll give myself a break. I turn to my wife and say...wait for it "What the fuck was that?" hoping that her comprehension of events has somehow surpassed mine and we can rap up the investigation and go back to sleep. Unfortunately her response was "Hunh? I dunno." Damn.   The hamster, having resigned himself to being awake at this godforsaken hour, decides to rouse the rest of my body and comes up with "You should get up and take a look!". This, unfortunately, seems reasonable so I slip my naked 6'6" 230lb body out of bed with the grace and finesse of a drunken walrus, whip the blinds aside, and peer outside. The trellis and it's encircling clematis are horrified by the sudden appearance of my naked body gleaming pasty white (give me a break, there's no natural way to get a tan in Vancouver in March) in the window as the sun struggled over the horizon. Besides the traumatized trellis there's nothing unusual - not that I'm an expert on what is usual for this hour of the day but extrapolating based on what the backyard looks like at other hours - it seemed okay. Hmm. There was a noise...there's nothing outside...but there was a noise. "Maybe you imagined it" the hamster can be obstinate. No, we've already decided that two people (especially two night-owl, heavy sleeping, morning haters like us) don't wake up this early for no reason. Double damn. "Maybe whoever/whatever made the noise is trying to break into some other window or door", I have to admit that I like the imagined it idea better than this new one but I guess I'd better check it out. I mumble to my wife that I'm going to take a look around and she mumbles back something affirmative. A quick look around produces more traumatized plants and garden fixtures but no explanation for the noise.   Having exhausted all avenues of enquiry I decide that whatever woke me up has vacated the premises and it's time to go back to sleep. I stumble back to bed, flop in, answer my wife's question, with "I dunno, there's nothing out there" and close my eyes in anticipation of renewing my recent acquaintance with the sandman.   Warm, asleep, comfortable, dreaming, it's all good. WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! "Seriously, what is going on here!" This time everything happens a bit faster. The look to the window, the glance at my wife, the hopping out of bed, still nothing. The clock now reads 5:51am. Again the house walkabout. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. It occurs to me that this is ridiculous but I'm tired and tired wins over pondering the ridiculous. Back to sleep. Or almost, because three minutes later WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! I bound out of bed and the blinds fly aside and I find myself eye to eye with...nothing. That's it, I've had it! I rummage around on the floor and find some discarded clothes from the night before. I unlock the sliding door and venture out. The birds are chirping, the cement on the patio is cold. The clematis on the trellis is, well, fragrant and beautiful at this hour of the day. Off in the distance I can hear the morning commuter train blowing its whistle. None of these things explains why I'm standing in my backyard with increasingly cold feet. I wander around the house looking for any explanation. No footprints, no rocks or other projectiles laying under the window, nada, zip, diddly. So, I'm standing half naked in the backyard at 6am with cold wet feet investigating what now can only be described as a paranormal phenomenon. Where are Mulder and Scully when you need them? (Actually probably only 30km west as filming for the X-Files hadn't wrapped for the season at this point, but I suppose Mr. Duchovny and Ms. Anderson wouldn't appreciate the wakeup call for the case of the mysterious suburban window banging incident). I decide to give the area the all purpose, fierce Viking stare that my ancestors perfected a thousands years ago, unfortunately to no avail. Bugger.   My wife and I discuss the mystery in monosyllabic grunts for a few minutes and then decide that since there's nothing to do, we'll do nothing and return to our previous default unconscious condition. Sleep is harder to attain this time as the hamster has finally gotten up to cruising speed and having been fooled two times before isn't about to let its guard down without a fight. At 7:30 I'm still lying awake but there've been more "events" and I finally drift back to sleep, only to be awakened ten minutes later by my wife's alarm clock. Bugger. Bugger. Bugger.   That day there were no other paranormal activities and I had a mystery to share with my cohorts at work. Not a very interesting story but then you already knew that having reached this point in my narrative. I went to bed that night having mostly forgotten the whole affair.  Warm, asleep, comfortable, dreaming, it's all good. WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! Pause. WHAM! Pause. Pause. WHAM! WHAM!   "Something is not right!!" All of you who've read, or had read to you, Ludwig Bemelman's Madeline will recognize the very astute words of Miss Clavel.   Okay, I'm awake, not alert, definitely alive (if my pounding heart is any indication), and whole heartedly unenthusiastic about the resumption of the early morning window bombardment, local time 5:24am. Blinds flung open, nothing obvious. A quick reconnoiter for available garb and then directly out into the beautiful pre-dawn light. Stupid early morning happy birds are chirping their fool heads off but beside that...nothing. No explanation to be found. Just to be thorough another quick jaunt around the house to verify that there is indeed, no rational explanation for the WHAM! WHAM! Damn!!   Now I'm a reasonable man (or so I like to think and if you disagree well then you can go and ... I digress) but after two consecutive mornings of being awakened by a mysterious force from another dimension I was beyond bemused...teetering on the edge of befuddlement. I was also tired. I really enjoy sleeping, I most especially enjoy the sleep that occurs between the hours of 3am and 7am. I'm willing to sacrifice the hours up until 3 for any of a variety of reasons, a good book, any social gathering, a stupid B movie that catches my attention at midnight, idle thoughts and musings. The hours after 7am are pretty much just a bonus, but that crucial 3-7....that's the stuff. I can go weeks with less that 6 hours per day so long as I get those hours. So, this FRICKEN-FRACKEN NOISE was cutting into my sleep. Ahhh!!!  Back to the events at hand. I'm outside in the backyard with cold, wet, dirty feet wearing yesterday's underwear (athletic style boxers if you have to know). So, I head back in, stubbing my toe on the way. I close the door and sit on the bed staring at the window. I wait, and wait, thinking that I'll catch the culprit/ghoul/whatever red handed. I wait. It's only 5:45am. I wait. By 5:50am I'm thinking that it's more important to sleep than to catch the noise maker. By 5:55am I'm snuggled back down, occasionally peeking at the window. WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! I move as fast as I've ever moved before 6:00am before. I cross the 4 feet to the window in under a second (that's 2.7 miles/hour!!) and saw a big giant nothing. Birds chirping, sun rising, trees, trellis, clematis, yada, yada. UNBELIEVABLE! I know because my wife and I discussed it and agreed that it was unbelievable and since we were the only ones there, we had to be correct. At this point a new plan was required. Daring, unconventional, bold. I opened the blinds, and left them open. (You didn't see that coming did you.) Then, I lay back down in bed and watched the, now completely visible, window. And watched, and watched, and waited, and waited, and waited and then it was 6:45am and still nothing. Now I've only got 55 more minutes to sleep before the alarm and I give up and close my eyes and go back to sleep. Fitful, unhappy, tense, non-restorative sleep until WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! By the time I groggily opened my eyes there was, of course, nothing to see. Then the alarm went.   My story at work that day was delivered with far less enthusiasm than the day before. "Once is funny" and all that. That evening my wife and I collapsed into bed early. We left the blinds open so that either the phantasm would be able to satisfy its voyeuristic tendencies without bothering to wake us up, or so that we'd have a better chance of catching the blighter in the act...opinions vary. Either way, the blinds were open. We hunkered down for sleep hoping that we'd wake the next morning at 7:40am.  But it never happened again. The end.  No, I wouldn't drag you this far into a story and then leave you hanging like that. Rather it was, 5:20am with the sleeping and dreaming and the what-have-you, then the WHAM! and the WHAM! and still more WHAM! My eyelids opened and I thought I briefly saw something at the window. I sprang out of bed but after that brief glimpse it was gone. A dark shape about the size of a volleyball (or that was the hamster's assessment anyway). I told my wife this and she didn't seem as impressed with my manly "seeing something" as I thought she should be. In her defense it was kind of difficult to explain why a volleyball would be attacking our window. But, now having seen something I was bound and determined to figure out what that something was. And, as luck would have it, as I was staring at the window a robin landed on the trellis and then swooped beak first into the window, hovered there and repeatedly smashed its face into the glass and then about faced and flew back into a nearby tree. Moments later that same robin begin singing a most energetic song.   A robin?? We'd been woken up early three days running by a robin? Little robin redbreast? No, I don't think so. But then a few minutes later there he was again bashing his fool skull into our window. Many thoughts occurred to me at this point. One was how was the damned thing surviving these multiple cranial impacts, these weren't love taps, he was whacking the glass with gusto. The Big Horned Sheep and Woodpecker union reps would have been most displeased to see Mr. Robin horning in on their areas of expertise. My second thought was why the hell had the robin chosen our window. I know that my wife and I are fine people and our house was esthetically pleasing but to be honest there were several more picturesque places the robin could have chosen. Third I pondered whether our little friend was developmentally challenged and just didn't understand that if he wanted to go north from where he was, he just needed to make a slight west or east diversion on his flight path, or adjust his altitude from 4 to say, 34 feet.   So, now the mystery was solved, sort of, but I felt that I needed to try and dissuade our little robin visitor from killing himself against our window. This wasn't exactly an altruistic endeavor as I mostly just wanted to be able to sleep. So, I went outside, completely naked this time - I figured that if robin dude wanted to see the goods I'd satisfy his curiosity and maybe he could move to the next thing on his "30 things to do before I visit the big nest in the sky" list. I'm outside. The robin is up in a tree, still singing what appears to be a merry little tune - nice for listening to but nothing you could dance to. I look at him, he remains aloof. I realize that there really isn't really anything that I can say to convince the robin to modify his behavior...but even robins must fear the intensity of the fierce Viking stare. I affixed the aforementioned expression to my face and waited for it to take effect. The effect was that the robin sang a slightly less merry tune and looks slightly chagrined (or at least I choose to think he looks as chagrined as a robin can look). Anyway, things are getting cold so I head back in.   That oughta do it. I figure that no robin can smash his face into my window after that.   Eyes closed, attempting to sleep. Of course, WHAM! WHAM! Flutter, flutter. WHAM!  FRICKEN-FRACKEN RETARD ROBIN!! What is up with this bird? I jump up and outside again and apply the third degree Viking death stare (pretty much the worst stare that anyone give). All I get in return is a dismissive "tweat" from the beaked basher.   My wife and I attempted sleep for the rest of the morning, trying our best to ignore the reverberating window.   Three days of interrupted sleep. My conversations at work concerning my feathered, flying alarm clock were much appreciated by co-workers. I was having a harder time seeing the humor. Someone suggested that small birds are scared of owls and that I should get an owl decoy to scare the robin away. Genius!! That evening on my way home I stopped off at Canadian Tire (because if anyone is going to have an owl decoy it would obviously be Crappy Tire.) Low and behold the tire store did have a two-foot tall, hollow, plastic owl, only $14.95! To be honest I would have paid 10 times as much for some uninterrupted sleep. I brought my wise, new, plastic friend home and set about finding a perch for him. I rummaged around in the garage and found a hockey stick with a broken blade that was the perfect size. I jammed the hockey stick in the garden outside the window and impaled the owl on the stick. The window was now guarded, our undisturbed sleep ensured, the sun was shining, and a beer was consumed in recognition of the great victory. In the battle of man versus nature score one for man.  I was rudely awakened at 5:18am the next morning by what I believe was the robin tapping out "score one for nature" in Morse code.  I looked out and saw the robin flying from the trellis, to the head of the owl, and then on to deliver a particularly harsh beak bash to the window, then the infernal creature alighted on the head of the owl, gathered his breath and renewed the attack. Nice. Apparently robins aren't the least bit afraid of plastic owls from Canadian Tire. I smacked my hand against the window and scared the damn bird away, I also managed to scare the crap out of my wife in the process - in war it's always the innocents who suffer. And, the war was now on. No 8-ounce creature was going to make a fool of me and my owl! Stupid useless owl. The morning went much like all the previous with the robin attacking at random intervals and us waking up to scream invective.   Four days running, not enough sleep. (In reality this was excellent training for being the parents of a newborn but that was still years off and you often don't really appreciate lessons while you're receiving them.) Thus far doing nothing had failed to stop the robin. The owl was a dismal failure - in fact it made the problem worse as it gave the little tweeter a place to rest and allowed for more frequent and vehement attacks. What next? And still the more puzzling question was why the robin insisted in beating his face against our house. At this point we were convinced that he was utterly retarded, possibly from brain damage sustained while smashing his head against other immovable objects. I decided that hanging stuff in front of the window might prevent him from flying in, sort of the same theory as the barrage balloons that Allied ships towed during the WWII Normandy invasion. As barrage balloons are in short supply these days I settled on a rake, a shovel, a hoe and the hockey stick - after removing it from the anus of the plastic owl. I hung them from the trellis setting up quite an obstacle course for Mr Smashy Face, carefully not creating a perch along the way.   We were positively bleary eyed and grumpy when we rolled into bed with a few grunts hoping that the solution had been found and that the score would be leveled at Man 1 Nature 1, after all a tie isn't a loss. The night went well and then with the rising of the sun, robin swoops in, he deaks right, he deaks left, he SCORES! WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! And the score stands at Nature 2 Man 0.  There may have been some crying at this point. I then stumbled outside and, okay not a proud day in my life in terms of rationality, unleashed a torrent of verbal abuse at the robin. I'm sure many of my neighbors were awakened by this childish outburst and I would have apologized if called on it but at the time is seemed like a reasonable thing to do. My wife disagreed on principal but I think she got some vicarious satisfaction out of it. In the moment of post eruption quiet, when all of the plants in the garden were feeling slightly embarrassed for me, I had an epiphany. Okay epiphany is probably too strong a word; I had a thought. "You can't hit what you can't see" (Something my father told my in the context of baseball after noticing I tended to squeeze my eyes shut just before the bat should have contacted the bat. You'll note "the should have contacted the ball" as my eyes closing generally had a deleterious effect on my batting average, go figure.) Anyway, if I could just get the bird to close its eyes then it couldn't very well make contact with my house. Maybe I could get the bird to wear those welding goggles. Or, sort of in the realm of the possible, how about I cover up the window with something. I pondered this for a moment and remembered that I live in B.C. and like to camp, which means that I must own a big blue tarp that measures 40' x 30'. (How do you know it's a long weekend in B.C.? You're getting soaked camping in the rain.) So, I headed down into the crawlspace and dragged the camping gear out a few months early. Then I grabbed some nails and a hammer and affixed a 1200 square foot tarp to an 80 square foot sliding glass door. Needless to say the neighbors that didn't wake up for me screaming at the bird woke up either when I started hammering nails into the side of the house or when I attempted to flatten my thumb. Mission accomplished, the back of the house was now a tragic eyesore, the garden and the window completely obscured by a tarp that was threatening to become "The Tarp That Ate Vancouver". I dragged my sorry ass back inside, threw the hammer in the bathroom (yeah, I don't know why either) and the flopped back into bed. The room glowed an eerie blue but it was still before 6am so I didn't give a crap. Nighty, night.   I woke up at 7:40 when the alarm went off. The next day I also woke up at 7:40. The day after, you guessed it 7:40am. After a few weeks of explaining the big ass tarp to visitors and neighbors alike, I removed it, not without some trepidation. But, our little feathered friend had either moved on, given up, or finally succeeded in braining himself and didn't return to ruin any more early mornings.   Sadly, the saga continues. Flash forward 360 days, more or less. Lying in bed. Warm, asleep, comfortable, dreaming, it's all good. WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! "Hunh!" The hamster was much quicker to figure it out this year, "OH NO! Not again!" Then it took him a few moments to remember the solution...something about an owl? No, the owl was now at work busily serving as a mascot for a doomed project. Something about a stick? Nope. Tarp! Tarp, yes, get the tarp. So, I got up and re-affixed the tarp, luckily I'd had the foresight to leave the nails in place last spring so it was ready to hang. Then, back to bed.   A few years later I was retelling this story to a friend at a new job, after the doomed project finally ran its course and cost us all our jobs. I happened to have Google open in front of me so I punched in "spring robin window" and discovered that I'm not the only person to have had this experience. Apparently robins all over North America are pulling off this stunt and the only way to stop it is, as I discovered by trial and error, to cover up the window. I thought the best way to explain this phenomenon would be from the point of view of the robin so here goes.   The Spring world according to male robins:  It's spring. I need a female (we'll call them robinettes). Robinettes only like robins that have big territories. I have a big territory. I'll just sing for a bit and let all the females know where I am. What a stud I am. Tweet, tweet. Come here you saucy robinettes, I am the robin for you. Tweet, tweet. Now I'll just fly around a little and show them my stuff. Oh yeah, I am an inferno of robin loving. Hey, what's that? Over by that house, another male robin? What is he doing in my territory? Is he stupid? Can he not hear my manly robin song? Why has he not flown off to his own territory? This is vexing. I will now strut around aggressively so he can see I am not to be trifled with. What is this? He is also strutting around. I will now sing the "go away you twit" song. Oh my, he is also singing! I must deal with this impertinent interloper. I will fly at him and drive him away. I'm flying at him and the imbecile is flying at me! I will swerve right. He is also swerving right, the cad! Now I will dive right into his face and he will surely fly away and leave me to mate with all the honeys. WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! Ouch! Damn! The jerk flew right into my head! Ow! I'm going to go back and sing some more and see if he'll go away. He won't go away! How am I going to be able to make sweet, sweet love with all the robinettes if he won't go away? I must attack again...Ow! And again...Ouch, ouch, OW!  And now back to our story.  So, it turns out the robin wasn't the complete moron that I thought he was, he just didn't realize that the robin in the window/mirror was him. Okay, that is kind of stupid but robins have been evolving for many thousands of years and windows are a relatively recent invention. And really it was stupidity caused by horniness and who can't relate to that.   The next spring I made a pre-emptive strike and covered the window the first of March.

      Oh bean.  When you're roasted and ground and drenched  in hot water what joy you bring.  Delicious bean.  When I'm tired you wake me up. When the meeting  drags on you open my eyes.  Oh helpful bean.  When I'm tense you make me frantic. You make me pee. If I partake of your muddy glory in  the evening you keep me up all night long.  Oh bean, naughty bean.  When we're apart for a day you send your goons  to sledgehammer my skull.  Jealous bean.  If not for you, oh bean, I couldn't make it  through the day.

         Another week another injury update from the Scorned Peon. I think my physiotherapist is just milking this gravy train but he says that my ability to climb the stairs without crying doesn't mean I'm sufficiently healed to play this week. Hopefully another week will see me back in the fold and proudly wearing the manly lavender blouses of SWARM: The only team in Thursday Div. 1 with an unblemished record.    &nbsp;   In other news, after last week's debacle I drove out to Abbotsford&nbsp;and found a&nbsp;farm where they had some, as yet, un-euthenized chickens. I purchased some non-dead (not undead) poultry and visited my&nbsp;cousin's Haitian friend's aunt's mambo and after a fairly confusing ceremony involving the chicken (sadly now deceased) several ceiling fans and a brief appearance by Lisa Bonet the crapulent cloud seems to have dispersed.   &nbsp;   Oddly, before I got home and managed to wash off the entrails and white mud&nbsp;my mind&nbsp;was briefly overtaken by the spirit of an eighteenth century Japanese girl who apparently had some unfinished haiku's she wanted to share. We came to an agreement where she agreed to desist in her unininvited&nbsp;inhabitation of the corporeal realm and I agreed to write more haiku's.    &nbsp;     Lavender clad bugs   With cleated feat and short pants -    Stay upwind of Swarm   &nbsp;    The disk thrown with skill   To bugs swarming in the sun -   Victory is near.   &nbsp;   Weekly combatents&nbsp;-   On nights both wet and sultry   The VUL must go on   &nbsp;   Disk bouncing off chest -    The agony of the miss   When rain clouds your eye   &nbsp;   When a good "D" means   You're too lazy to say drink -    You belong with Swarm

         So I'm walking out of Safeway this evening and this old, aged, ancient woman wearing a black, hooded shawl and forty-seven beaded necklaces, is standing in the doorway muttering to someone named Dimitri who I can only assume died in 1964 or at least isn't anywhere in the vicinity of this particular grocery store exit. I paused in my hobbling toward the door in hopes that she would win her imagined argument and vacate. No such luck, in fact the dispute became more animated as the seemingly irrational, yet also phantasmal, Isabella joined the fray. After a few minutes of enduring this altercation I got fed up and attempted to step around her and out the door. Bad move. I suddenly became the embodiment of the aforementioned Dimitri and she began swearing and swinging her gargantuan purse at me. I was taken aback by this gratuitous display of insanity and tried to lurch out the door and out of range of her surprisingly feisty onslaught. Sadly due to my left leg  lameness I wasn't able to outdistance her and she continued to rain blow after blow into my head and neck.       There is very little that is more humiliating for a 6'6" 230lb man then getting his ass walloped by a 94 year old, 94 pound, wizened old woman. Especially so when it happens at the corner of 4th and Vine in Vancouver in the presence of at least thirty of the beautiful women that Kits is famous for.      When I finally managed to elude this tiny hellcat from the land of Crazy she began spitting and yelled a curse at me. Something along the lines of "Curse you Dimitri, I curse you. May a dark cloud of crapulence follow you everywhere!!" I considered myself lucky to escape even with my pride so completely demolished.       Then I headed back to the Ultimate field to discover that, miraculously, Swarm was leading 5-1. I sat down to watch the inevitable first victory of the Division 1 Swarm. But somehow a dark cloud of crapulence descended and we went on to lose 10-6. Then we continued on to the second game and somehow a darker cloud of crapulence descended and decided to drop water upon our heads, and further, caused our fair-weather-only team to lose the second game as well.       So, I apologize. I should never have brought my curse down upon Swarm's fair head. Great effort! Everyone played spectacularly but, as mentioned, the curse doomed you to lose. I apologize again. I have to go now as all the plants in our home appear to have spontaneously died and begun decomposing pungently, drawing all the neighbourhood rodents.       Score Peon Out.

       Hello Swarm Nation!!   After visiting the doctor I have been assured that the injury to my left leg will in no way prevent me from sitting on the couch and consuming all manner of fine foods and beverages delivered by the lovely and talented Ms Sauer. I've also been given the green light to walk gingerly on virtually any flat surface, and to partake of any sport so long as it doesn't involve movement or changes in speed or direction. Seemingly this could be interpreted to mean that Ulitmate is a go for me - given my talent for just standing around and yelling at everyone else - but the doctor used the words "leg could just fall right off below the knee" &nbsp;to describe the possible ramifications so I think I'll sit this week out.   Sadly this will leave swarm without 2/3 of its Speed Challenged&nbsp;Anti-Thin Men (SCATM)on Thursday as both Roger and I will be unavailable. And although I'm sure Peter (no offense)&nbsp;is up to the task of carrying the SCATM Flashlight (we used to have a Torch to carry but forgot it at Kentuck Fried Chicken one day) by himself, we may want to enlist some male help this week. I suggest finding someone old, slow, talentless, ugly and really annoying so that getting Roger and I back next week will seem like a good thing ;-)   Please weigh in with your opinion on a replacement bug or to tell me, for the love of god, to stop sending email to your work acccounts.    Buzz, buzz, and other swarmy sound,   Glenn "Score Peon!" Karlsen

       If only the field wasn't so lumpy I wouldn't have tweaked my ankle on the second point of the game, thereby reducing my speed from deceptive slowness to glacial futility.   &nbsp;   If only I wasn't a complete klutz I wouldn't have fallen flat on my positively ponderous posterior for no apparent reason, foregoing an easy point - and I think demoralizing the other team to the extent that they would have conceded.   &nbsp;   If only I wasn't made of matchsticks and plasticine my achilles\calf wouldn't have exploded early in the first game and I could have contributed in a more meaningful way than keeping my lawn chair securely rooted to the ground. Though keeping the chair from running onto&nbsp;the field was integral to at least three of our points.   &nbsp;   If only we could all be more like Peter we'd have scored on 26 exciting hucks into the endzone.    &nbsp;   If only "I totally contest" was a valid argument.   &nbsp;   If only The Main served Johnny Cakes then all would not have been for naught.   &nbsp;   If only we'd had a ninja of our own...then we would have been Kung fu fighting....those cats were fast as lightening...in fact it was a little bit frightening...   &nbsp;   And in conclusion...that was a great effort by everyone last night. Not to toot our horn too much (carpal horn syndrome you know)&nbsp;but I think we could have won either or both of those games last night with a little luck. We are completely deserving of our "Kings of Ultimate" moniker and I foresee many glorious victories in Division 1 for us. Well done all of you!! Huzzah!    &nbsp;   Carry on.   &nbsp;   Glenn "Limping Gimp" Karlsen

          Greetings insects, arachnids, various and sundry other buggers.   &nbsp;   As you are all aware and delighted\dismayed by,&nbsp;our team of:      swill throwing,   clog happy,   insult dispensing,   lazy D-ing,   disk dropping,   crotchety old,   falling down for no apparent reason,     dudes and dudettes has been elevated to the status of "Kings of Ultimate" (okay King already had this status but that was a gift from his parents, this honor is a gift of the VUL). At least I'm interpreting the decision to put us in Div 1 as an acknowledgement of our most regal and hallowed standing.    I anticipate that our upcoming competition will have been forewarned of our unique offence "the Swarmation" and will be busily formulating a counter - possibly along the lines of trying desperately not to giggle as we run willy-nilly back and forth across the field whilst never making eye contact with the possesor of the disk. You can also rest assured that our much vaunted "cup yells indignantly at the mids - mids tell the cup to shut up" defence has been the subject of some consternation amongst the Thursday night elite.    I look forward to seeing you all at Slocan C on Thursday. I especially look forward to seeing you all at the drinking establishment of our choice afterward when we can re-live the halcion days of Div 2: remember when we had 3 Lisa's and 2 Geoffrey's on the field at once, remember when Roger made that throw and then he ran and then he stopped and then he ran some more, remember that red-headed girl with the smiley crotch, remember when Paul did that thing and we all laughed, remember the dog that poo'ed on the field?????.   Fair thee well until then,   Glenn   P.S. Go Swarm! No, no, go longer, ....., longer, ....., wait for it...., oops sorry, turnover.    P.P.S. Lindsay, I found that oil\grease remover, sorry I forgot to bring it to practice on the weekend like you asked, I'll have it there on Thursday.

      I was sitting at my desk, minding my own business (or rather minding my company's business) when I was suddenly presented with a need. Perhaps you are familiar, it goes something like this.    Dear Brain,   Thank you very much for having the forethought to see to our nutritional needs today. You did an excellent job of procuring --insert whatever you've eaten in the last 12 hours here-- and it was both delicious and contained a remarkable variety of each of the 5 food groups. After due consideration and careful processing by all of us here we have determined that --insert whatever you've eaten in the last 12 hours here-- has been relieved of all its beneficial components and is no longer required. We would like to take this opportunity to wish the aforementioned a fond farewell and ask that you, dear brain, see to its removal at your earliest possible convenience. If you are otherwise occupied at this time we completely understand and will forceably evict it ourselves in approximately 3 minutes.   Thanks again and we look forward to working with you in future.   Sincerely,   Department of Digestion    So, when presented so politely with this 3 minute deadline I felt that compliance was the best way to achieve a win-win situation for all parties and I'm all about the win-win. I abandoned my post and headed for a location more appropriate for my inteneded task. In my 3 storey workplace there are 7 different destinations that a man such as myself could head in order to carry out this task.   You may be questioning why I'm walking you through the story of my intestinal tract. It's related to the following.    Theories:      Everyone is at least somewhat crazy.    hopefully no one contests this one    A person's overall craziness is really a combination of a bunch of little bits of crazy.  Each "little bit of crazy" has a specific definition. Thus, little bit of crazy X would have the same symptoms in person A and in person B, if they both suffered from X.   So, I'm a person ergo I'm crazy. One of the aspects of my craziness is that I feel an irrational irritation when I have to perform an intestinal eviction when there are other folks in the same room or where other folks could detect the auditory or aromatic evidence of my activities. So, since I'm assuming that you are a person to, there is a good chance that some of you out there feel the same way. And, for those of you who don't share this particular craziness, you may get some insight into the craziness of others.   So, back to the story of my search for a place to satisfy my need.   Each of the 7 aforementioned locations has its pros and cons in terms of not aggravating my craziness, which is the most important consideration, that is, right up until the point where an unscheduled forceable eviction becomes an issue.       Bathroom Ratings        Location #   Occupancy  Distance  Traffic     1   Single  Same Floor  High     2   Multi  Same Floor  High     3   Single  1 Floor Down  High     4   Multi  1 Floor Down  High     5   Multi  2 Floors Down  Low     6   Single  2 Floors Down  Low     7   Single  2 Floors Down  Low     My search progressed as follows:     Location 1  Rebuffed by a locked door  Location 2  Closed for cleaning  Location 3  Closed for Maintenance  Location 4  Fully occupied     Things are getting a bit more urgent, no emergency yet, but a storm is definitely brewing     Location 5  First Stall in desperate need of some attention from the maintenance crew. Actually my initial thoughts were: Who the hell let a rhinocerous into the men's washroom? How did the rhinocerous make it past the security guards at the front gate and the receptionist at the door? What the hell were they serving in the cafeteria today?!  Location 5  Second stall...acceptable and available   I finally found a place to look after business (my business not my company's business). As I had some time on my hands I pondered bathrooms and the many unspoken rules that accompany them. I started several mental lists (note these are all rules to do with men in washrooms, I have no idea what goes on in a woman's washroom and I shudder to think of the myriad rules that a woman must learn w.r.t. using such facilities):    About talking:     If you are talking to someone and you both walk into a washroom then you may continue speaking. Just pretend that you aren't in a washroom. Ignore the surroundings. Everything is fine  You can never speak to someone when you\or they are sitting on a toilet unless it is someone you share 50% of your DNA with.  You should never strike up a conversation in the washroom unless both parties are at the sink or are headed for the door.   About eye contact:     NEVER MAKE EYE CONTACT AT THE URINAL!  The only thing worse than eye contact is eye contact after glancing down and to the left and realizing that the other guy noticed. Yes, you know you've done it...   The Most Egregious Violations:     Attempting to start a conversation with a stranger as they enter a stall.  Any physical contact with anyone using a urinal.  Any attempted hand contact from the time you finish to the time you get to the sink.  Following someone into the washroom in order to continue a conversation when you don't need to use the facilities    The Punishment:       In my opionion the only reasonable punishment for any bathroom transgression is, of course, revoking all indoor bathroom priveledges and relegating the offender to using the Port-o-John in the parking lot.     By the time I'd worked this all out&nbsp;I'd finished up and decided I should probably head back upstairs and get on with business (the company's ...)&nbsp;- quickly slipping out of the facility hoping&nbsp;I wouldn't pass anyone coming in who may get the mistaken impression that I was the one responsible for the horrendous physical state of stall number one or get the unfortunately correct impression that I was the culprit for the prevailing malodorous&nbsp;air.   I escaped undetected.

      Hello from rainy day Inverness.   I decided to stay here for a second day. Not neccessarily because it is such a wonderful place - though it is somewhat picturesque. Mostly I'm just a bit worn out from my long days and thought that today would be a good recuperation day and the place I'm staying is run by a ridiculously nice couple - the man did a little dance when I asked if I could stay a second day (okay the dance was because my staying meant he could put up the "No Vacancy" sign and relax today without worrying about an empty room but I still got a huge kick out of it).   Today I'm taking it easy by walking to Loch Ness and poking around in the Inverness Highland Museum. Then I plan to grab a coffee and sit and write in a coffee shop for four hours. Unfortunately, unlike your experiences in Vancouver,&nbsp;I suspect that there will be nary a single nubile young thing in a bicini to distract me. At best I suspect I'll be bothered by some Italian bitch (strong word but I've run into Italians everywhere on this trip and they have surpassed Americans for being the most annoying peoples on the planet) attempting to walk through me - they&nbsp;seem to think that everyone else will just get out of their way. (that sounds a lot more bitter than I actually feel - I'm just fascinated by the way they seem to interact with the world - so not Canadian - yet most Italians in Canada are the nicest people - double fascinating - do the nice ones flee Italy in disgust at all the rude idiots - I'll have to investigate when I get home)   That's my entire day plan.   Tomorrow I'm heading to Fort William and if I'm feeling spry I'll climb to the highest point in Britian (along with the 70,000 other folks who do it every year) and then climb something else.   Monday I plan to head back south to Stirling and see the William Wallace monument and bop through Stirling castle.   Tuesday I'm heading back to Glasgow to see if I like it better when not jetlagged and suffering from an anxiety disorder.   Wednesday I'm winging home to the people I love.&nbsp;   I considered having a Frappacino here but I did some math and realized that it would probably be cheaper to fly to Vancouver, order it there, then fly back to Scotland with it than to order it here. How the hell to people live here when a Frap costs $8. It isn't civil. I think that maybe that whole "Emptying the Highlands" by the government and rich land-owner's story is over-sold and the reason all the Scots left is because they heard about cheap frozen coffee in Canada.   Glad to hear that the weather is nice at home. I had to put on the visor a few times here to keep from further burning my face - which also has the added bonus of making me look like a bigger freak. It would appear that I am the only person in the entire country to ever wear one by the looks I've been getting when I have it on. That and the elderly Scottish folk, of which there are many, many, many, are all about 4'9", and can't resist commenting to their friends on my immense size (they do it discreetly though, in booming whispers to their hard-of-hearing companions - audible to anyone within a 30 foot radius).

      I arrived in Inverness and discovered that it isn't Edinburgh, which isn't fair to Inverness I guess. It is packed with tourists speaking Italian, German and Norwegian (or something Scandinavian).   I went and saw the dolphins this afternoon. They were awesome. I felt like a bit of an ass being on a boat out bothering them in their natural habitat but I really wanted to see them and seeing them won out.&nbsp; They look unbelievably beautiful, graceful, and&nbsp;sort of Mona Lisa'ish with their "I know something you don't know" smile. I wonder what they think about the big boat full off idiots with camera who come by every two hours to look at them.   I haven't run into Tiger Woods here yet as he's at Troon about a 4 hour drive away but somebody in some goofy union jack pants is on the cover of all the papers. Golf...  The breakfast's here have been good but they keep sticking beans on my plate and I keep on not eating them.&nbsp;Coffee is always good, especially so in Europe but...Starbucks here is ridiculously expensive (£1.60 for a regular) so I've been getting my fix elsewhere. I've only been having 1 a day with breakfast except for the days when exhaustion has overcome me and then I have a cup.  I haven't met anyone here. What's up with that? I guess I haven't been trying to meet anyone - bopping around like a mad person and then sitting and writing when I stop or collapsing in my room. But, in everyone else in the country's defence, I realize that I'm haven't been talking to anyone and I think I'll have to try harder to engage someone in conversation soon.&nbsp;

      I hit the road at 8:30am and headed for the other castle in Edinburgh - Craigmillar Castle. The lady that runs the guest house had heard of it (it's like a mile from her place) but didn't know exactly how to get there, but the lady that cooks and cleans gave me good directions. The castle was very cool - there were only about 10 other people there (15 year old Canadian boy from Sarnia who wanted to tell me about how her mom used to work with Bertuzzi's mom and yada, yada. Then his aunt decided to repeat their Bertuzzi connection. I should have know better than to wear the Canuck shirt). Back to the castle. It was really cool, an abandoned "real" castle that you could wander all through, it had real fortifications and living quarters and kitchens - I was bedazzled - it was also somewhat fallen apart&nbsp; - it was multi-floored but in most places the roofs and floors were gone.&nbsp; The steward there suggested a nice walk back to the city - a nice 3 mile walk but it was lovely.   Then I headed back to the Royal Scottish Museum - yesterday I went through the history of Scotland and today I went through the general section which I'm guessing would have bored the living crap out of you. I spent 3 hours going through the history of life evolving on earth, the minerals on earth and especially in Scotland, a whole lot of stuffed animals, some dinosaur bones, a big section of Egyptian artifacts (how does every museum on earth have these? Are there any left in Egypt?)&nbsp;   Then I walked 2 miles across town to building #1 of the Scottish National Gallery. It blew, only this one crappy artists work. Then I went across the street to Building #2, it had some great stuff - a selection of Edvard Munch work that I was really taken by. He has never been my cup of tea before but I think I'll look up more of his stuff when I get home - maybe it's my Norwegianity showing...   Then I walked 1.5 miles back across town to building #3 and saw the really good stuff - some nice Impressionist stuff and even a few cool Scottish bits. Looking back I can't believe how lucky those Musee D'Orsee and Louvre folks are to have so many fantastic paintings.   I saw building #4 yesterday, total crap, and unfortunately 7pm has passed so I won't be making it to building #5. Oh well, I took in enough culture today.   Yesterday I decided that Edinburgh was too nice not to spend a 3rd day but not quite nice enough for&nbsp;a 4th so I booked a bus ticket to Inverness (Loch Ness and bottlenose dolphins and Highlands) online last evening - 6£. If you book it at the station it costs 18£. What a ridiculous system where you get 33% off like that... Then today while I was taking a rest at the Museum it occured to me that it would be an excellent idea to phone ahead and reserve a place to sleep in Inverness, since I had a phone and a book with phone numbers. I called and managed to get a really cheap (but reputedly excellent) b&b on my first try. Magic!   Now I'm back at the computer and I'm fricken exhausted again. But good exhausted. In a couple of minutes I have to go outside and take a picture of the castle with the sun setting light. Sun doesn't really go down until around 10 here but the "good light" shows up around 8 or so.   What else? Not much. I have discovered (or rather verified) that travelling alone is good because you can see all the stuff that only you want to see and you don't bore the crap out of anyone else and they don't bore the crap out of you. BUT...travelling on your own isn't as much fun as travelling with someone else. Talking to museum security guards just isn't as much fun as talking to you. And, I may be the only person travelling by myself in the whole city. Everywhere I've been there are couples strolling hand-in-hand or families with rambunction kids and I keep thinking that it would be more fun if I had a rambunctuous kid and someone to hold my hand...   I'll email again after I get to Inverness (if they have the Internet that far north) and let you know how the 4 hour bus trip goes. I'll have a chance to catch up on my writing - yes I've managed to sneak in the odd hour of writing here and there amongst my activities, mostly during meals. I ate at a pub last night - The World's End - fish and chips and two glasses of great ale. Then I headed out to walk and discovered that dehydration and not much food and alcohol make for a light-headed walk. I'm fine and the guy I accidentally bumped into will recover eventually.&nbsp;

      Sunday evening after you drove off I briefly considered hailing a cab and seeing if I could beat you home and then acting like you'd imagined the whole thing. I would have done it too if not for the mocking I'd have taken...   The flight left mostly on time and I had unlimited legroom. Did you hear that? Unlimited legroom... I also had a seat that was very nearly as wide as my ass so, while I could stretch out as much as I wanted, I couldn't plug in the headset for the movies and be comfortable at the same time. So, I started watching the first movie and then decided that I really wanted to sleep (what with the exhaustion of having slept only 3 or 4 hours of the previous nights) so I took that pill you gave me. With the aid of the pill I was drowsier for the next few hours and very nearly fell asleep but didn't quite manage it. I did suffer some memory loss&nbsp;- as warned by the package - because I can't for the life of me remember the first two movies that were on, I only remember Somethings Gotta Give - movie #3 - and only from about 1/4 of the way on. Weird. I ended up sitting next to a massive, kilt wearing, rugby coaching Scotsman who was very nice. On the other side was the aisle which meant I got drilled in the shoulder whenever a fat Briton would walk by.   We arrived in Manchester to some confusion as to what those of us going to Glasgow should do. They eventually decided that we should get off the plane and go into the terminal. We got off and wandered the Transfer corridor for about 15 minutes until we got to a door where they handed us these blue plastic Air Transat boarding passes. That was it. No word on what to do or where to go.   I wandered back to where I could see the plane and found a departure screen with flight 705 to Glasgow/Vancouver and was eventually assured that I was in the correct location. Eventually everyone else from the flight showed up bitching and whining about the crappy lack of explanation.   We then sat and rotted for 90 minutes because of some catering problem on the plane and then departed and arrived in Glasgow an hour late. I grabbed the bus into Glasgow and then managed to successfully walk to my hotel using the Lonely Planet map, getting there at 9:40pm. The hotel was pretty lame and my room was tiny but I didn't care, the person at the desk guessed my name as I walked in and handed me a key before I'd opened my mouth. Exhausted I fell into bed. Nothing. Then panic because I didn't know what to do the next day. Then an overwhelming desire to head back to the airport and fly home. Then I calmed my ass down and gave myself a&nbsp;pretty serious talking to. I decided to stop being a scared little boy and tried being a self-confidant 34 year old man-child. That worked much better. I fell asleep and didn't wake up until 3 a.m., body clock misfiring.   Upon waking I realized I was horrifically dehydrated, probably contributed to the body clock and waking thing. I guzzled the water I had and then tried to sleep. I then realized that I wouldn't be able to find any place to stay in Scotland, the country was completely booked. I then discovered that I'd end up spending $300 each night to sleep in this country with no rooms available. I further realized that Scotland sucked. I also figured out that I was just going to be sad and miserable the entire time. It is truly amazing what you can learn about a country while lying in the dark of your hotel room, not sleeping. Around 5 a.m. I cranked out the LP and tried to figure out what I'd do the next day, while delirious from lack of sleep and water.   By 6 a.m. I had decided on Edinburgh because I wanted to see a castle as soon as possible. I collapsed (if it is possible to collapse while lying down) and tried to sleep again. No luck. I read all about Glasgow and decided that at least Glasgow sucked (since I wasn't interested in any nightlife). At 7:30 I got up and put some clothes on, had a bit of a weepfest (holy crap I can be a loser) and then went down for breakfast. Turns out I was starving, still dehydrated, and also coffee starved. I came back to the room, got my things together and actually started feeling human again. Then I asked directions to the bus station and headed out to catch the bus to Edinburgh.   The bus ride wasn't interesting but pulling into Edinburgh was spectacular. Wonderful. The bus station is located in the heart of the city and is overlooked by the castle and a whole load of the other sights and sounds of Edinburgh.   I headed over to the Tourist Information center, found a room in a very nice guest house after only 4 attempts 10 pounds/night cheaper than my Glasgow hotel, and then walked the 1.5 miles to it. I caught the bus back (what a huge improvement in rooms and the ladies there couldn't have been nicer) and walked up to the castle. I liked it a lot. I then wandered down the Royal Mile all the way to Holyrood Castle and the construction sight of the new Scottish Parliament building. I then wandered through a park and started climbing the spectacular&nbsp;Salisbury Crags (this beautiful park with blowing grass, heather, a little lake, rocky outcroppings, more blowing grass, these little trees) I was about exhausted after my city touring but the more I walked up the hills the more energy I got. I had only intended a short walk (the exhaustion and all) but I kept climbing and getting more energy and more happy and more enthusiastic. Once I reached the summit of Arthur's Seat, I sat and wrote for an hour. The wind was howling so I had to move until I got somewhere out of the wind&nbsp;- I was freezing - but it was great. I then wandered back down (remind me to tell you my peeing story) and into town. At this point I was starving - having not really eaten after breakfast and having eaten all your cookies (thanks!) I found a cute place to get some food and coffee and wrote for another half hour or so. Then I wandered back to the guesthouse, exhausted at 9:30 and fell asleep after a nice shower, waking up at 1:30 - dehydrated again. I drank almost 2 liters (it was a 2 liter bottle) and fell back asleep waking up at 7:30, finally refreshed.   It was&nbsp;a good day.   This morning I signed on for another day at the guesthouse (Alexander's Guest House) and had a nice breakfast there and now I'm back in the center of town about to attack the things I didn't see yesterday.   The weather is a bit Vancouverish. Really hot during the moments the sun is out but cool otherwise. I managed to burn my face yesterday in those sporadic sun moments but today is a bit thicker cloud so I should be okay.   I'm trying to decide where to go next...I'm leaning towards Inverness to see Loch Ness and go on a dolphin hunting cruise - I love dolphins. From there I'll head to somewhere I can climb in the hills some more.

      Ever have one of those days when you just don't know what the... what the... anything?  No? Well then you should skip the rest of this because it won't make any sense to you.  To those of you choosing to continue on I offer the following observation.  "  Sometimes I wish I'd been given the manual  ."  Manuals, if done correctly at least, let you know:   what things are for,   what they can do,   how they do the things they do,   what happens if you push button X or Y,  what to do if things aren't doing what they're supposed to  the phone number and email address of the omniscient guru who can solve every problem  Very useful information. Unfortunately I didn't get a manual with me. So:    I'm not entirely sure what I'm here for,    I have a pretty good idea of what I can do but only in as much as I know what I've done and based on that I can surmise what other things I am able to do but I suspect there are a myriad of other things out there that I could be doing that I'm just not aware of   I have only a general understanding of how it is I manage to do things, or rather, it still seems somewhat magical that my body works and the inner workings of my brain are a complete mystery   I think I know what will happen when my buttons get pushed but I'm often surprised by what does and what doesn't sets me off   If I'm not working correctly I have a few solutions: sleep, water, food, exercise, seeking medical treatment, seeking psychological advice, ignoring the problem until it goes away - and though usually a combination of these will work, it's trial and error at best   Damned if I can find a guru who can solve even some of the problems    So here's the place where you'd hope I'd come up with some solution for not having the manual. Sorry. Plenty of folks have tried and the results have been mixed at best; I'm not sure that the world is ready for Fundamentalist Karlsenism.

      Deswarmination  Screenplay by Glenn Karlsen    Cast of Characters:  Disclaimer: Any similarity between people and events in this work of fiction and actual people and events is purely coincidental and if you disagree then you probably suffer from some staggering egotism issues. I mean honestly, everything isn’t always about you.  The Ladies of Swarm:  Cindy Chan “TMTDB”: When Cindy says “Throw me the disk, bitch!”, bitches throw her the disk. Cindy is a levelheaded, sweet woman off the field but on the field she’s a hellcat who refuses to be looked off. There is nary a Swarmer who hasn’t felt the searing heat of the “C. Chan Scowl”.  Cindy Ong “Slash”: Is her nickname because her cuts have been studied by F1 engineers in hopes of improving the performance of their racing machines or is it because there is widespread speculation concerning why she always declines to accompany the Swarm on their post-game drinking binges on nights with a full moon. Is she a mild mannered Swarmer or is she a bloodthirsty werewolf?  Lindsay “The Schoolmistress”: Beneath the façade of her pleasant disposition lays the smoldering heart of a genuinely benevolent soul. But just to the left and down a little of from that heart lays the spleen of a petulant six year old. Fortunately for all, the spleen is a very low ranking organ and is only allowed to call the shots (at least the verbal shots) while behind the wheel of a two thousand pound automobile and of course that other time, but we have all decided to forget about that.  Lisa Personality #1: “The Barbarian”: Having played Ultimate for nigh on four hundred years there is nothing that Lisa doesn’t know about the game and nothing she won’t do to win. She rails against those less competitive than herself and those who fail to appreciate her balls-tothe-wall playing style.  Personality #2: “Oprah”: Lisa wants everyone to enjoy the game and will do whatever she can to ensure harmony and contentment on the field. Always quick with a complement, Lisa wants you to be the best Ultimate player you can be.  Mel “The Siren”: Sings like an angel, runs like a gazelle. Mel is able to run at full speed, circling the handler for hours on end without tiring, all the time playing the guitar and belting out “I said I” and “Five minutes after the call”,available for sale at:  urlLink http://www.melaniedekker.com/   Verlane “Cap’n Smiley Crotch”: Don’t let her curly, red hair fool you, this girl is no Shirley Temple, she’s a Strawberry Daiquiri and make that a double. When she’s patrolling the field she’ll take no guff from anyone. If you’ve got guff, you’d best keep it to yourself or dispose of it elsewhere.  The Gentlemen of Swarm: Alfred “The mercenary”: Exhausted from a full day of Ultimate-for-hire he showed up to bolster the depleted Swarm line-up after some undisclosed “persuasion” from Verlane.  Geoffrey C “A-game, S-game”: Bemused savant with devastating good-looks (see: http://www3.telus.net/nutmilk/Swarm 2004/GPC2.jpg) who, when he brings his stellar Ultimate A-game is the ultimate in unstoppable Ultimate forces but when he brings his S-game………Ultimately, which game will he bring today?  Geoffrey L “Lifestyle guy”: Granola Hemp Hippy turned Tri-athlete Tax Lawyer soon to be turned Snooty, Riche Pants, Oxford Master of Laws. His body sacrificing layout-or-die defense is surpassed only by his ability to fire off writs and torts and argue the minutia of the penal code while delivering “Loomer Laser” passes to the dump.  Glenn “Grumpdaddy”: Among Glenn’s weekly contribution to the team is bringing two very comfy chairs. His best four weeks were when he managed to occupy one of the chairs for the entire duration of each and every game. When Glenn isn’t grumping it up on the field or the sidelines he’s usually at work writing long, incomprehensible, unsolicited email in order to help fill his fellow Swarmer’s trash bins.  King: “New Guy”: King is a long time Ultimater, first time Swarmer. King’s unconventional how-about-we-try-and-win attitude and his propensity both for catching disks thrown to him and throwing disks where other Swarmers could catch them have been labeled “Unswarmish”, a stigma he’s still learning to deal with.  Paul: “DVD”: If you met him on the field you’d think he’s called DVD for his Defense, Vitality & Determination. Actually it’s for his stellar string of straight to DVD blockbusters such as Mindstorm, The Operative, Escape Velocity and the upcoming Crash Landing (see http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0083590). When Paul isn’t tearing up the field in his patented “no traction” cleats he’s in front of his computer “making marvelous movie magic, man!”  Peter “The Rookie”: International melon magnate on the run from the Brazilian mango mob Peter has a highly refined strategic mind and a set of hands that would make an NFL receiver turn green with envy. His adept brain is always three steps ahead; his burly body is oft playing catch up.  The Capricious Gods:  Wendell “God of Loose Connections”: The god who is to blame when wires don’t quite meet, when connectors aren’t snug and when the plug doesn’t exactly fit into the socket. Wendell is a spiteful dweeb who can only be appeased through ritual sacrifice, please see page #42728 of “How to Placate the Modern Techno Gods” revised 2003.  Susie “God of Servers Being Down”: Part malevolent destroyer, part random menace, part creator of free time, this god is a big ol’ hunk of cheese in the office’s intestinal tract. Susie is more an arbiter of pleadings & prayer than a receiver of sacrifice. For more details see Chapter 72 of “Oh please! Oh Please! Groveling for Techno Success in the 21st Century”.  Angus Longshaft “God of Cable Loss”: God to blame when the cable you absolutely, positively must have just isn’t to be found. Angus is a very ancient god and isn’t exactly the brightest light in the pantheon. All supplications to Angus involve a fair bit of prostration, a kilt, and a skillfully placed haggis (sort of explains the popularity of wireless technology, no?), see Chapter 162 of “Oh please! Oh Please! Groveling for Techno Success in the 21st Century”.  The Folks Watching it on TV:  Stan &amp; Nancy Vul “Stan & Nancy or The Vuls”: A nice middle-aged couple watching TV, you probably know someone just like them.  ANGUS LONGSHAFT BACK STORY: The year was 1127 the place was somewhere north of Glasgow and somewhere south of the Norwegian Sea, more specifically a small town in the highlands called Glennglennic. In this town lived a man, a large man, a towering behemoth of a man. This man’s name was Angus Longshaft and what Angus could do better than anyone else in the history of history was throw a 20ft toothpick for distance. So dominant was Angus’ caber tossing ability that he had never, in his short but distinguished history, been beaten.  On a fine day in June it was time, once again, for the Huge Highland Games. The event kicked off with the usual pretty girls dancing around swords for reasons that were a bit sketchy even then. Next followed a few lads smacking each other about the head and neck with claymores followed by a round or two of the ever-popular Highland Leapfrog. With all of the preliminaries events out of the way it was time for the main event, the crowd pleaser, the Caber Toss.  Angus, being the reigning champion, was scheduled to throw last so he sat back comfortably, scratched, drank mead, and pursued his other avenue of interest - chatting up the bonnie lasses. There were many fine competitors on this day but none came close to reaching Angus’ previous years record of two spins, and 35ft. In the final round it came down to two competitors: Angus and Rogered Patterson (so named for an unfortunate incident during a hotly contested game of Highland Leapfrog – but that’s an entirely different story). Angus threw his final caber and achieved a remarkable throw of 2.25 revolutions, 41ft. Rogered knew he was going to lose and started to sweat (he’d wagered a cask of his best whiskey that he’d win) and sweat. In fact folks were heard to say “Wow, sweaty Rogered Patterson sure is sweaty, even for him.”  Rogered waddled up to the line with his caber balanced precariously on his shoulder and his unfortunately slick palms. Off to the left Angus was putting the moves on the young lass who, though she didn’t win, had bounced her way through the sword dance competition in the most delightful way. Rogered reared back and tossed the caber like he’d never tossed a caber before – exceptionally poorly. In fact the caber slid off Rogered’s perspiration soaked mitts and careened up and to the left, up and to the left, landing directly on the back of Angus’ head. The force of the impact drove Angus face-first onto the anvil he’d been leaning against and then spilled the contents of his cranium onto the skirt of the aforementioned lass.  Now really this was a grave injustice. No champion should go out this way. It was uncool. Kenny “The God of the Despicable Demise” noticed this abomination and decided to do what he could to rectify it. He went before the Council for the Creation of New Gods and Lipstick Colours and argued that Angus represented the epitome of Caber Tossing prowess and as the Caber was growing in popularity as something to toss – having recently passed both the boulder and the cat in the latest poll by “Things to Toss Quarterly” magazine. The Council pondered this argument and then the Chairwoman asked “So, Angus Longshaft…? How long?”  Long years passed with Angus reigning supreme in all things Caber Toss related.  Even longer years passed and at a certain point the number of people tossing the Caber began to slowly decline. It wasn’t as if people suddenly one day said “I shan’t pick up that 150lb stick anymore” it was more that the young folk weren’t as likely to fling the broom (as everyone knows, the first step on the road to caber toss) and there were a lot more bridges around so the need to chuck a log across a stream just didn’t come up as much.  Frankly Angus didn’t really notice the waning of his godly area of influence, he wasn’t that big on noticing what was going on anywhere. Angus had only two interests: Caber Toss and enjoying the bonny lasses; he was spectacularily talented at both endeavors. In fact all the goddesses, from time to time, would pay a call on Angus to “get things sorted” and because of this, among the gods, he earned a reputation (completely unjustifiably I might add, but you know how it is when you hear people repeating the same thing for six or seven centuries, eventually you just assume that its true) as someone who could sort things out. Apparently the gods don’t understand what a euphemism is.  The year is now 2004 and Caber Toss is suffering yet another year in what has been centuries of decline. The Godly Director of Observances, Supplications, Prayers, Pleadings & Sacrifice is doing her quarterly tabulation of the books and discovers that Caber Toss is no longer viable. Normally this would mean that Angus (as the deity in this area) would be cast out of Godland to be eaten by the crows and other angry forest creatures in the Forest of Angry Forest Creatures that surrounds Godland. But, Deloris thought back to all the evenings that Angus had helped her get things sorted and decided that Angus was just too valuable to let go. Instead she wrote out a pink slip for Angus and made an appointment for him to speak with the employment counselor and handed it to Mercury. After Angus finished his morning two-hour Caber practice Mercury handed him the pink slip.  Angus asked him, “So, what the hell is this then?”.  Mercury replied, “It’s a pink slip dude…you’ve been laid off.”  Angus looked at him, the light of comprehension decidedly absent from his eye. “So Deloris is handing out pink slips afterwards now is she? I mean I admit our last time wasn’t my best performance but…but I’m not sure what I’m supposed to do with this” eyeing the note suspiciously.  “No Angus. The note is informing you that you are no longer the God of Caber Toss. You’ve been sacked.” Mercury informed him. “You have to go and talk to Simon over at the Employment Center.” With that Mercury decided that he was needed elsewhere and flew off before the confused Scottish god with the big stick decided to take out his frustrations on a certain winged, bearer of bad news.  Angus still had no idea what Mercury had been on about but he thought that maybe that new fellow Simon could explain it to him – Angus had been meaning to get over and talk to him to see if he’d be interested in tossing the Caber about.  Angus walked into the Employment Center and found Simon’s office. Simon looked up and asked what he could do for him. Angus said that he’d had a visit from Mercury, some kind of pink paper from Deloris and he thought he’d come by and chat with Simon about it. Simon asked if he could see the paper and after examining it started to flip through his gigantic ledger (because gods only ever read from giant books) and found the available position section. He then asked Angus what his interests were, he said “So Angus, what are your interests, what are you good at?”.  Angus realized that he’d finally found someone he could talk to and belted out in his proudest, thickest Scottish brogue “Well Simon, I like f#%&amp;ing and Caber Toss”.  Simon, being a simple god, was so taken aback by Angus’ reply that he blushed bright pink and didn’t take the time to get Angus to repeat the last bit that he’d only half heard. He eventually managed to say, “Well I believe that Aphrodite and Eros have got that one area covered…so, lets see about the other.”  Angus wondered if that meant that Simon was interested in a bit o’ the toss. He sat expectantly and waited while Simon flipped through his big book.  Eventually Simon stopped flipping, believing he had found something appropriate, in fact it seemed to be the exact thing that Angus wanted “God of Cable Loss” by all accounts it seemed to even be in an area of serious growth. Simon looked up and said, “Well Angus, I think I’ve found just the thing for you…Cable Loss”  Angus realized at that moment that Simon was probably a bit of an idiot but at least he was into the toss, even if he pronounced it a bit oddly. He responded with “Yeah, Caber Toss, care to go fling a few?”  Simon, confirming his previous assumption that Angus was a dolt-in-gods-clothing, smiled, nodded at the man and said “Sure, maybe later. Here’s your Techno God Guild card, your new Tome of Responsibilities and Privileges (colloquially known as the TORAP, think of it as the Idiot’s Guide to being the God of X, where in this case, unbeknownst to Angus, X is Cable Loss), and the keys to your new place in the new Techno neighbourhood. Menial and Tedious will look after moving your things for you. Best of luck to you!” then he extended his hand in hopes of accelerating Angus’ progress towards the door.  Angus was nonplussed (he didn’t know the he was nonplussed, he was under the mistaken impression that his condition could be most accurately described as flummoxed but I’m telling you that he was definitely nonplussed). His day had started normally but had gone strangely since then. But, on the upside, he was holding the keys to a new house and that was good because the old place was getting a bit beaten up - what with the occasional Caber-through-the-wall accident and all. Angus gathered his thoughts, an action of scant milliseconds, and uttered, “Well nice to meet you Simon, thanks for the house, we’ll get together for that toss and maybe grab some pie as well”, because he found that people always felt better at the mere mention of pie, and he set off to find this new house of his.  GETTING CLOSER TO THE SWARM-RELATED BIT OF THE STORY:  Angus found his house, across the street from the houses of Wendell – God of Loose Connections and Susie – Goddess of Servers Being Down, who were newly anointed gods and were also moving in. The three gods introduced themselves and the two newbies were excited to learn how long Angus had been reigning in Godland. They assumed, a mistake that would taint the first three or four decades of their reigns but we’ll get to that later, that Angus would be an excellent source of information on all things godly and god related. They chatted for a while and then Wendell said that he had to go home and start reading his TORAP.  “TORAP? Nooooo, you two must come on over and we’ll lift a few pints. There’s plenty of time for reading tomorrow, or next week, maybe next month, next year, in a hundred years…”, Angus said as he tried to coax his new friends back to the full service bar in his new home (all god homes have a full service bar – the god’s architect got mentally blocked in 1970’s American suburbia.)  Wendell and Susie spent the next four hours listening to Angus tell them Caber Toss stories. Luckily they were still so starry eyed at having become gods that they didn’t realize that Angus was boring the living snot out of them. Eventually Angus got tired of talking and realizing that it was time for his afternoon practice. He tried to convince his new friends to come with him for some log lobbing but they both declined saying that they had to settle into their new places.  Over the next few days Susie and Wendell met more of their fellow gods and heard, repeatedly, how lucky they were to have someone as good at getting things sorted as Angus for a neighbour - though Susie still hadn’t figured out why the other goddesses always said it with a wink and a nod. Susie also discovered, much to her chagrin, that Wendell appeared to be a morning person who was prone to start collecting his ritual offerings (a process that is much too disgusting to describe here but if you’ve ever seen a grown man run for the phone and stub his toe on the coffee table causing him to hop in pain, loose his balance on the hardwood floor, and then carom crotch first into the banister then you at least have some idea what it sounds like, only imagine it about forty-three times louder) at six in the morning. Susie, on the other hand, enjoyed staying up late into the night blasting the prayers and pleadings of her devotees on her zillion watt stereo not heading to bed until Apollo had stumbled out of the shower and had his morning coffee – of course Apollo was at his own home across town in the old Greek neighbourhood (imagine street after street of the Parthenon only no rubble) but you know what I’m getting at.  This clash of sleeping habits led to a bit of enmity between the Goddess of Servers Being Down and the God of Loose Connections. Relations across the picket fence became frosty. When Susie needed eggs one day, Wendell claimed to be fresh out. When Wendell popped over in hopes of replenishing his depleted salsa stocks during the Superbowl (yes, even the gods watch sports on TV), Susie said she couldn’t spare any. If you’re wondering why gods and goddesses are running out of groceries its because neither of them had got around to reading their TORAP yet (Angus’ illiterate influence, plus they really are intimidatingly large books) and they weren’t aware that a river of salsa was only a finger snap away. Anyway, as sleeplessness continued to take its toll Wendell began to describe his neighbour as “the shrew next door” and Susie spitefully referred to Wendell as “that screaming ass”.  One Wednesday morning as Angus was about to head out to practice Wendell intercepted him and described his problem with the goddess next door in hopes that he could benefit from Angus’ renowned talent for sorting things out.  Angus was, of course, oblivious to this build-up of tension in the neighbourhood but he pondered the problem for a minute and then said, “what always works for me when dealing with an unhappy goddess is to invite her over, give her a glass or two of wine, play some sexy bagpipe music on the stereo, dim the lights, rub her shoulders for a while, and then…well…you know.” Wendell was disgusted by the very idea.  Angus then suggested that Wendell could come with him to give the caber a bit of a go and they could come up with a solution. Wendell managed to wriggle out of having to try and heave a tree across a field but still got Angus to commit to coming up with a solution to his goddess problem. Angus trotted off and promptly forgot all about poor Wendell.  On Angus’ return from practice Susie stopped him and told him about all the problems she was having with Wendell. Angus immediately proposed his wine, bagpipes, shoulder rub solution but Susie rejected it even faster than Wendell had. Angus then advocated a Caber Toss – the loser of which would have to move into Angus’ old house (as Angus dimly recalled hearing through the goddess grapevine – they always wanted to talk afterward… - that his old house was still unoccupied due to all the caber damage). Susie wasn’t crazy about the caber aspect but did relish the idea of crushing Wendell in a competition and being rid of him. Susie then said, and if she’d only known then what she knows now she never would have, “Well Angus, I don’t have any idea how gods handle this sort of thing but I’ll go for any sort of godlike, goddish, godly contest to decide this thing. I’ll leave it in your capable hands to sort out.” Susie then gave Angus her best smile and sashayed on home. Angus watched her walk away and had several thoughts, none of which had anything to do with caber toss.  It occurred to Angus that he’d heard countless times that he knew how to sort things out and that this was an occasion where being able to sort things out would definitely be an asset. So, he just needed to sort this out. Angus went inside and sat down in his favourite chair. He then kicked his feet up on his favourite wooly footstool and began to think. His first idea was that Wendell and Susie should just…but no, neither of them was willing to give that a try. His next idea…no Susie said no caber.  His third idea was to turn on the TV and see if the Highland Games were on. After flipping through 900 channels he finally found one showing the 1983 games from Inverness and he settled back in his chair to think. Eleven hours later Angus hadn’t moved from his chair (gods don’t pee) but he was still waiting for idea number four. Finally at 3am he gave up attempting to come up with an idea on his own and decided that he’d ask someone. So, having solved how he would solve the problem he went to bed.  Thursday morning he got up and, as per his routine for the past nine hundred years, he had some porridge and headed off to practice. And, as had been his routine since yesterday, an exhausted Wendell accosted him. “Aye, Wendell, I’ve got a solution for you. I just need to work out a few kinks and I’ll have it for you tomorrow. Just leave me to sort it all out.” Wendell was so ecstatic that Angus was going to tame the wicked wench for him that he almost forgot himself and agreed to throw the twig with him. Instead he scurried back inside and performed an stunning rendition of the Myposian dance of joy.  After practice Angus ran into Diana who’d had a frustrating morning – only scratches and sweat to show for three hours chasing an elusive hind through the forest. A few hours later Angus was laying on a bearskin rug, basking in the afterglow, half-listening to Diana describe, in excruciating detail, a dispute she’d had with Fanny - Goddess of the Henhouse. As Angus contemplated attempting another go, something in what Diana said coaxed another thought to the surface.  “So, you settled your problem using mortals?” was the thought that Angus managed to express.  “Of course, it’s Rule #3 in every TORAP ‘All disputes between the good gods and goddesses of Godland shall be decided by contest between mortals.’ ” Diana said and then after a strategic glance nether-wards realized that Angus wasn’t using his big brain currently and there really were more pressing issues than talking about the TORAP.  After sorting the pressing issues and a bit more basking Angus headed home to solve Wendell and Susie’s problem once and for all. He settled into his chair and thought “Mortal competition…mortal competition” over and over. It then occurred to him that beside caber toss he had no idea what mortals were up to these days. In fact, he hadn’t had any contact with the mortal world at all besides watching Highland games on TV and that one fellow who’d prayed to him two years ago. “What was the fellows name again? Stamp, Stain, Dido, no…Stan, that was it.” Angus fondly remembered Stan, who’d taken his wife – Nancy if memory served – on a trip to Scotland and had decided that when in Scotland you must toss a caber. Angus briefly forgot about everything as he relived the moment when Stan had held the caber wobbling up off the ground and had started praying with a vengeance “Oh god don’t let this oversized chopstick crush me into the ground, oh please, don’t let my back give out, oh let me just get this one toss so I can tell the grandkids I did it!” Fortunately for Stan, Angus had heard his prayers and had helped Stan’s back hold out. And, in a further bit of good luck Scotland has an excellent medical system and your pinky toe really isn’t as important as everyone makes it out to be. Additionally, the cast had impressed the grandchildren even more than the piece of paper with, “This certifies that on the 3rd of July, 2002 Stan Vul of Quallicum Beach threw the Caber a total of 0 revolutions, 3 inches distance.” written on it.  Angus took a moment to gather his thought and then decided that he’d just take a peek and see what Stan was up to and maybe that would give him a clue as to what kind of mortal competition was going on these days.  STAN AND NANCY VUL: Stan and Nancy live in Quallicum Beach, which, as the name may lead you to believe, is situated right where the majestic, temperate rainforest meets the cool waters of the Juan de Fuca Straight. Quallicum Beach is the kind of place you pass through and think that it might be nice to come back and visit when you needed to get away from it all. It’s the kind of place where you imagine you wouldn’t be hassled by having to ‘do things’ or worry about anything ‘happening’. It’s the kind of place where everyone has a satellite dish that pipes pseudo-life into their homes via the 5700-channel television universe.  The Vuls have set aside this particular evening to watch ESPN 17’s Thursday Night Ultimate Doubleheader. Many of Stan and Nancy’s neighbours think that they are nutty for watching Thursday Ultimate when it is generally acknowledged that it is the weakest night but Stan and Nancy swear by the entertainment value to be found on Thursday. And tonight was doubly good because both of their favourite teams were playing – not each other, but that would be next week.  Stan’s favourite team is the Swarm, a rag-tag group who’s season thus far has consisted of a five game winning streak that saw them boosted into the First Division, followed by a nine game losing streak that saw them relegated back to Second Division. One of the things that Stan liked best about them was that on any given week there’s no telling which team will show up, the dominating force or the godforsaken nightmare, they always kept you on the edge of your seat. Stan also liked that it was fun to try and figure out how different members of the team were connected to each other, it was like playing that Kevin Bacon game, with all of the Swarm being connected somehow – school, work, other sports, relationships, but the overall connection was pretty loose. The final thing about the Swarm that Stan appreciated was that they weren’t a team that got all caught up in the whole “Spirit of the Game” non-sense, in fact they’d almost come to blows in one game which had had Stan up cheering until the game had been called on account of hard feelings.  Nancy, on the other hand, like a team called Wham-O. They weren’t as spectacular as the Swarm could be at it’s best but they were solid and courteous and those were the things that Nancy appreciated. She also liked that all the players on Wham-O were waiters and waitresses, people who had jobs she could understand, not like those Swarm with their Melon magnates, show business folk, and high-tech phone weirdoes. Nancy was born in Quallicum Beach and aside from that disastrous trip to Scotland hadn’t left.  As the first game got underway Nancy began her usual torrent of mockery for Stan’s beloved Swarm. “So, I see your big fellow is doing his job keeping that chair from blowing away in the wind.”  “Yes Nancy, he’s still on the DL but the doctor’s say he’ll be ready to play next week. All right!! Did you see Pete catch that one in the endzone? We’re up! BZZZZ! Go Swarm!!” Stan replied as he leapt to his feet in celebration.  The game was a seesaw battle back and forth with the Swarm getting to the dreaded eight-point-wall first.  AND THIS IS WHERE ANGUS STARTS PEEKING IN:  “My team of loose connections is kicking some serious Ultimate butt now Nancy. Swarm rules! Yeah Swarm! Oh…domination!”  Angus heard this and couldn’t believe his good fortune – but then he thought about it and realized that Stephanie (Goddess of Unexpected Good Fortune) really did owe him one after last Saturday. Here he’d been looking for a mortal competition and Stan and Nancy had provided one – granted it looked like a bunch of people running around a field with a broken fly-swatter but if that’s what the mortals were into these days then that was fine with him. And double bonus, Wendell God of Loose Connections already had a team here, the Swarm! Angus decided to revel in his success for a few minutes and in doing so he completely missed the end of the game, but no matter, all he had to do now was find a team for Susie and he was set.  By this time the second game was underway and Stan had taken over the mocking duties. On one play the handler for Wham-O ran for a disk and somehow managed to trip himself and sprawled onto the grass as the disk flew through the space where his hands had been only milliseconds before. Stan burst out “We’ve got a waiter down! Waiter down, Nancy!” with a giggle.  Nancy indignantly replied, “They’re called servers now Stanly, Martha says that you have to call them servers”.  Stan laughed all the louder as he yelled out “Server down! Nancy, we’ve got a server down!” in his best Scottish accent. This time Angus took having the solution to his problem handed to him in stride – after all he wasn’t well know as a man who could sort things out for nothing – and wrote “Wham-O for Susie” in his mental notebook. Now the only problem was arranging for Swarm to play Wham-O.  Now, one of the real treats in being a god is that arranging things for mortals is right up their alley, it’s kind of what they do. That is, gods who’ve read the TORAP, which, as I’m sure you’ve realized by now, Angus has not done.  So, Angus tried to figure out a way that he could get the two teams to play each other…nothing came to mind. Then he had a brainstorm, maybe he could get someone else to arrange it for him, it seemed like all his goddess friends were always on about how they had to arrange this or that thing all the time. Just as he was about to stop peeking and start looking for help he heard the announcer rap up the broadcast by saying “And tune in next Thursday when you’ll see Swarm vs. Wham-O and the Belligerent Buddha’s vs. the Dawdling Sherpas.”  At that point he stopped his peeking in on the Vuls and headed over to tell Wendell and Susie that he’d arranged for their competition next Thursday night.  He stood out on the sidewalk and bellowed for his neighbors to come out and hear the exciting news. Wendell and Susie wandered outside expending great energy to give the impression that they were effortlessly ignoring each other. Angus explained, “There’s going to be an Ultimate game next Thursday to decide this problem the two of you are having.” Angus would have gone into greater detail on the problem but he’d completely forgotten what the problem was, what with all the thinking he’d had to do to solve it – there’s only so much room in a man’s brain.  Angus continued, “Susie, you’re team is Wham-O and Wendell the Swarm will play for you. Whoever’s team loses has to move to my old house on… well… over that-a-way,” he said with a vague wave nowhere near the direction of his former domicile. “So, now that that’s settled, who’s up for a…” but before he could get his chronic question out, Wendell and Susie both erupted with questions of their own, questions such as, “What are the rules? Who is Swarm? When on Thursday? Where is the game? What is Ultimate?”  Angus replied with, “The rules…whoever wins, wins. Swarm is Wendell’s team, weren’t you listening? The game is on TV. It’s a mortal game where they run around, count to ten, stand around a lot, and try to hit each other in the head with a flying plate.”  With that Susie and Wendell threw petulant scowls across the fence at each other for a few seconds and then withdrew to ponder their upcoming competition. Angus stood for a few minutes thinking that maybe he should try working on getting a reputation as a ladies-man and leave this “sorting things out” to someone else. He glanced down at his CaberMan Timex and judged that it was probably a good time to get in some practice and headed off to, well, you know.  AT SUSIE’S: Susie walked back inside seething from having that screaming ass scowl at her. She wound up and booted the first thing she saw in her foyer and her TORAP moved a good three inches and flopped open. (Like I said, gods only do big books.) After unleashing a torrent of scorn upon the offending tome she bent down and looked at what the open page said, “Messing with Mortals for Fun & Profit” was the title of the chapter. Susie sat down, flipped to the front of the book and began to read.  All through the night and well into the next afternoon exclamations such as, “You’re kidding me! That’s all I had to do?! Oh my me!” could be heard emanating from her foyer.  AT WENDEL’S: Wendell walked back inside seething from having that shrew scowl at him. He wound up and booted the first thing he saw in his foyer and his TORAP moved a good three inches and flopped open. (Like I said, gods only do big books.) After unleashing a torrent of scorn upon the offending tome he wound up and booted it again, and again, and again until it ended up in the closet. He then limped up the stairs and cracked open a bottle of Zima to help settle his nerves. After two more bottles Wendell’s anger was mostly forgotten, he flipped on the TV and spent the evening watching a “Monster Garage” marathon.  GAME NIGHT: It was a dark and stormy night. Lightening flashed, thunder thundered, wind howled, rain slashed down pelting everything and everyone foolish enough to expose themselves to the tempestuous onslaught.  On the southern edge of the Ultimate field the seven men and six women of Swarm gathered together like muskox in a blizzard hoping to somehow ward off the rain and maintain body heat before the game began. Across the muddy morass the players of Wham-O appeared to be lounging in an inexplicable shaft of brilliant warmth &amp; sunshine as they gathered to sing “O Canada” on this balmy July 1st evening.  The game began and Wham-O jumped out to an early lead. Discs that appeared poorly thrown would somehow find their way directly into the hands of it’s intended Wham-O target, often bouncing off a Swarm’s skull or left buttock en route. Large puddles would open up and swamp a Swarm player but then mysteriously dry up and disappear entirely when a Wham-O player ran by.  Even impartial observers would have had to admit that something was fishy. Unfortunately there were no impartial observers watching anywhere.  AT STAN &amp; NANCY’S: Stan was screaming “B_llshit! This is total BS!” but we’ve already established that Stan was far from impartial.  Nancy was giggling with glee as her team unleashed a Costco sized can of whoopass on the nasty Swarm. “Oh precious, yes, beat the nasty Swarm, yes, we hates them, we kills them, yes!”  AT WENDELL’S: Wendell sat on his couch, completely dumbfounded. He could see what was going on but was completely impotent to counteract it. He tried holding his breath, flailing his arms and thinking really hard but that didn’t do any good. He tried throwing things and cursing, which did make him feel a little better, but it didn’t effect what was happening on the field. He then decided to go next door and snap the shrew in half.  He ran out his door and attempted to jump over the white picket fence but at the apex of his jump he ran headfirst into some disconcertingly dense air. In fact the air didn’t possess the most important properties of air – like being breathable and permeable. Upon further examination Wendell discovered that his entire home appeared to be surrounded by this oddly un-airy air. Wendell did what anyone would do in his situation and tried repeatedly to smash through the invisible barrier with his face but after he regained consciousness the second time he gave up and trudged back inside to watch the conclusion of the game and start packing up his stuff.  AT SUSIE’S: “Don’t stop thinking about tomorrow. Don’t stop, it’ll soon be here. It’ll be here, better than before. Yesterday’s gone, yesterday’s gone.” Susie danced around her living room in a somewhat embarrassing manner, lip-syncing along to the words. Fireworks appeared over her head and she leaped onto the back of her unicorn and flew around her suddenly colossal living room. (Isn’t it amazing what a goddess can do when she finally sits down and reads the manual?!)  AT ANGUS’: Angus rolled off the bed and headed for the kitchen. He grabbed two glasses of water and then headed back into the bedroom. “Here you go lass, now since we’ve got a few minutes before my wee caber’s ready for another go, I’ll tell you the story of how…” In the back of his mind he had a vague recollection that something important was going on tonight but that thought quickly slipped away as he recounted one of his favorite Caber Toss stories to a disinterested but attentive goddess.  AFTER THE GAME: The disconsolate Swarm sat in the mud and tried to understand what had happened. Even with their best effort they had had their butts handed to them…again. To add insult to defeat, about two minutes after the game ended the mud dried up, the clouds parted and the temperature rose fifteen degrees. The team couldn’t help feeling frustrated that even though they were obviously all absolutely faultless in all of their losses, the universe was continuing to conspire against them. The team considered ways to overcome these hexes, spells and malicious deities but all their only ideas were: everyone abstaining from sex or everyone engaging in a Matrix’esque orgy. Both solutions seemed worse than the problem they were attempting to fix so it was agreed that nothing would be done and no one would speak of it again.  After that the Swarm went out and succeeded in losing their next game as well. No scapegoat was readily available for this loss.  CONCLUSION: Wendell spent the next few months repairing log-sized holes in the walls of his new house.  Angus continued to be Angus but he gradually gained a reputation as a really dumb guy who was very popular with the ladies.  Susie was integral to Angus’ “transformation”.  Swarm went on to win some, and lose some, but through it all their Spirit rating remained reassuringly low.  Everyone continued to enjoy pie.
