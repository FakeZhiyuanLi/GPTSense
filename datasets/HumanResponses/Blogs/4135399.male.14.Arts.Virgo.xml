       So this 'training' for my job at the fair... oh good heavens I don't even know where to begin. Okay, so this guy David who's gonna be my boss tells me to go to this training at 9:15 AM on August 18, so okay, I plan to get up and go in to MPR early with my dad. So I do. Mind you, I have to wake up at 3:00 AM for this! that is  6 HOURS BEFORE THE TRAINING.  hmph. So I get there at about 4:00, and my dad has some stuff he wants me to help him with. I know a lot about Pro Tools, the audio editing software there, so I can help him with this stuff. So I'm working on his stuff til about... oh i dunno... 5:30 maybe? He's got some more stuff then, so I work on his stuff till about 7:00. Then I get bored. I go sit in the studio for a while... that's old news. I sit in the studio and watch whenever I go. So then I go over to the Starbucks in the lobby of Marshall Fields (across the street) and get a Decaf Coffee Light Frappucino. That's good (until about 1 PM when I get a stomach ache and headache from it) After my dad's show finished at 9:00, I walked down to the board room in the basement for training at about 9:10, only to discover that it had started at  9:00, NOT 9:15, NO, ITS AT 9:00!!!!  So I have to embarrass myself by walking into a room of formally dressed office people (all women, i might add) dressed in a Hawaiian Shirt and Khakis,  12 MINUTES LATE . And as I sit down and start listening, I realize that Kim (the lady doing the talking) is NOT talking about the commerce part of the fair (selling merchandise), No David has sent to a  MEMBERSHIP MARKETING  training session. I couldn't care LESS about stupid Membership Marketing (getting people to join MPR and that stuff). Okay, I look at the agenda, and maybe it's not the wrong one, it says at the very bottom: Commerce Training. Oh good, so I sit through 45 minutes of Membership Marketing, then I get to learn stuff. Kim says David is coming at 9:45 to do that part of it. At 9:45... no David. 9:50...no David. 10:00... NO DAVID! And of course he has no cell phone so we can't call him. So I leave the meeting/training with a packet of information that I have NO USE FOR.      I just wasted  7 HOURS  on NOTHING. (If you count from when I had to get up.) I'm really mad...

      If you READ the website I sent, it says that my condition is HARMLESS (I  think) and will resolve itself over time. I think... Heh heh heh.  So, yes. I am here at 4 O'FLIPPIN CLOCK in the MORNING! ARGHGHGHGHGHGH. Moo.  Bah (the humbug kind, sorry Jazzy!) So I'm blah blah-blah heehee I won't do  that to you. I have training at 9:15, so as long as I have to be here, my  dad figured I could work on a project for him. Why not? I've got nothing  else to do for the next, oh, let's see, 5 HOURS. Humph.  I am trying the post by e-mail thing, so if this post looks different than  all the others, that is why.  (PS Naomi- D-I-S-E-A-S-E) Heh heh heh, sorry I'm being so MEAN Naomi, but  it's early and I have NOT had my caffeine yet. That frappucino from  yesterday is not affecting me anymore.... Need coffee.......

       I have Osgood Schlatter Condition.  I know, I don't get it either. If you wanna read about it:   urlLink http://my.webmd.com/hw/health_guide_atoz/nord700.asp?lastselectedguid={5FE84E90-BC77-4056-A91C-9531713CA348 }   I'm not gonna explain it, it would take too long. Heh heh heh. Yeah, I just got back from the doctor, and that is what he said. Now I am going to go have lunch. I have an interesting life, don't I?

       Jonathan is gone. He went back to his house with his Grandma today. So... yesterday we went to the Renaissance Festival with him. He liked it... he got to ride an elephant. Fun... (I didn't ride the elephant). He accused some random lady of trying to kill him ("I looked at her and I think she has poison.") And this is from a 5-year-old! So now I have a busy week ahead:     TOMORROW -  Doctor's appointment (for my knee), AND volunteering at the library in the morning.    WEDNESDAY  - Library again.    THURSDAY -  High School picture day.    FRIDAY -  Going up north to Lyn and Rik's (Jonathan's Grandparents) cabin, and MAYBE training for state fair.       WHEW!   I know it doesn't sound like a lot... BUT...      Oh hmph. Maybe I kinda miss having Jonathan here. He was a whole lotta work, but there was never a dull moment... heh heh heh.      We got a new dishwaher at Sears today. It's gettin delivered this week sometime. It's one of those that you don't have to pre-rinse the dishes before you put them in. Yey! I hate pre-rinsing dishes! Yee-ha!      Okay all done now. Bye bye.

       Jonathan is here... he's really hyper and wild and stuff. I went to Eagle's Nest (indoor playground) and had to crawl around in there with him for 40 minutes. My knees are dead.... waahh! He's in the potty now, it's the only chance I have to get a break. He's even sleeping in my room! He's too scared to sleep in the guest room by himself. Oh I gotta go, he'll be out of the potty soon... oh I can hear it flushing.... SAVE ME!

       I haven't written in a couple days... it feels like so long. Heh heh.      Jonathon gets here in a couple hours... whee... the kid is hyperactive, so yeah. We're taking him to the Eagle's Nest (an indoor playground) right away, probably. I probably won't be able to update for the next couple days cuz I'll be taking care of Jonathon. Heh heh heh. That's my new favorite thing to say: heh heh heh. So... yeah. I went to the library today and that was fun... Summer's almost over, WAH. Blah. Moo.

Heh heh heh that is SO ANNOYING. ARGH what was I gonna say? Umm........... K I'll just sit here and think about it until I remember. Hum the Jeopardy song to get the feeling of how long this takes. Heh heh heh. Ah forget it. Although I can't believe it's already lunch time... I feel like I just ate breakfast! I s'pose I should be feeling hungry right about now. Heh heh heh.

       OMG I miss that play so much... *tear*  So... yes, my day was planning and cleaning. Planning for Jonathan to come on Thursday, he'll stay for 2 nights while his mom is recovering from surgery, and Cleaning the house cuz my mom is obsessive about the house looking nice when people come over. My mom thinks summer is over. Cuz it was all cold today, and her friend from school (my mom works at an elem. school) called to whine about having to go back in september, and we went to office depot and they had school supplies, and my dad went back to work after having a week off... so she's all grumpy. We had dinner at Don Pablos (Why have we been eating out so much lately? Well last week my dad took off work so we could do all sorts of stuff and I THOUGHT today we'd get back to a normal routine but apparently not...) I'm gonna get yelled at to come upstairs and go to bed soon... heh heh heh.  WHOA! Alyssa just told me she might audition for a movie. Cooolllll..... Fun.... I'm REALLY hyper....

       No word yet on whether or not I'll be going up north. We may know within the hour though. Ha. Like anyone cares, oh and if anyone wants to know what Alyssa said, too bad that's for me to know and you to find out.    ::edit:: No I do not have to go up north.

       Oohhh... i really HATE making up titles. I'm no good at it. I'll never write headlines for a newspaper. Not that I wanted to anyway but, neh.       Went to IKEA today. It was so full! There was like no room to move. We had to return something, and then my dad wanted to buy these shoe rack things for our garage that we saw last time we were there. So we push our way all through the 2nd floor until we come to them, write down where in the warehouse they are, then push our way down to the warehouse to discover that they are out of stock. Hmph. Probably just as well... the checkout lines were ridiculously long. I'm perfectly happy to buy the shoe racks online or something. Then we went over the the mall and had an early dinner at Kokomo's Island Cafe which was not great. The server kept taking away plates before we were done with them. That was kind of annoying. I got my hours for the fair... so I sent them to all the SCM people I have e-mail addresses for. I also sent them to my friend Sara. Soo.... yeah. I might have to leave to go up north to be with Jonathon and his grandma Lyn. It's his birthday tomorrow and he probably won't get to see his mom or dad cuz his mom is in the hospital and his dad is there with her. So he will be up north and my mom and I will probably go up there to help take care of him. I don't know if I'll be able to post or anything, I'll try... So, yeah.

       ARGH! This is why you should ask people out in person! But unfortunately that is not an option for me right now. Some screwy computer glitch made it so Alyssa didn't get my e-mail! *tear*  So... what did I do today...  Had leftovers from PF Changs for lunch, had a blueberry turnover from Jellies &amp; Beans for dessert... went birthday shopping for Jonathon (the kid from a couple posts ago), he's turning 5 on monday. My mom has a high school reunion, so me and my dad had dinner at Wagner's Drive-In in St. Louis Park (kinda by Jazzy's house! HI JAZZY!) and yeah they had really good hamburgers BETTER THAN AT THE SAMPLE ROOM AHEM THEO AHEM. Heehee. And then we saw I, Robot, which was good but also kind of creepy. And then we came home. Isn't my life INTERESTING? Heehee I know y'all think so.  Oh and in case anyone didn't get my last post:  YES, I DRANK LOTION . And it was DISGUSTING, I do not recommend it. *shudders*

       I did the stupidest thing of my life last night. I'm NOT talking about asking Alyssa out, this thing happened overnight:      Okay so I wake up at about.... neh, I dunno.... 3-ish, and I'm thristy. So, logically, I reach for the bottle of water on my bedside table (nightstand, w/e you wanna call it), and I can't get the cap off. Now this is normal cuz we I have several water bottlesm some of which have very stubborn caps, and I couldn't remember which one I put in my room yesterday, and being dark, I can't see it. I pull and pull and I still can not get this cap off. ARGH! So bend over and kinda use my teeth to pull it off, and after a little jostling it comes, so now I'm holding the cap in my hand and I bend over to get a drink of water and OH MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS ME this is DISGUSTING WATER! I get up and run to the bathroom to wash out my mouth, and while I'm in there I set the cap down on the counter next to the sink. So I go back to my bedroom and think, ok I must have been imagining that it was disgusting, maybe I licked the side of my face where I used a Stridex pad last night. Yes that must be it. So I get another drink, CAREFUL NOT TO LICK MY FACE. And GOOD GOD this is still disgusting! So I go wash my mouth out again, and go back to bed. I must be dreaming. (Remember this entire thing happened in the dark!!) So I get up this morning, not remembering what happened last night, but when I go into my bathroom, it all comes back to me. The pump from my bottle of lotion is sitting on the counter, right next to the sink.

       I did it! I asked Alyssa out! Alyssa, if you're reading this check your e-mail! :) K nuff said about that...  So... I went to see Napoleon Dynamite. Theo, it was good, you'd like it. Especially the nerdy skinny white guy turned ghetto by his online romantic partner. It was funny! Then we had dinner at PF Changs (GOOD FOOD). And then came home... electrician is coming tomorrow to do work in my mom's office... blah blah blah. You remember the time I had to babysit the 4 year old up north? Well his mom is in the hospital (again) so he might be coming to my house for a couple nights next week... which would be uncool (if he has to come, it means his mom is not improving and can't be released from the hospital) but it would be cool too (he's a fun guy to have around, and monday is his birthday... so he'd be happy bout that). Or, if she's out of the hospital, I might get to go up north to take care of him up THERE, which would be cooler cuz they have a lake. So... yeah.

       So.... yesterday.. what did I do yesterday? Oh yeah, woke up with a TERRIBLE HORRIBLE NO GOOD VERY COLD! But I already told y'all that. I went out to breakfast at Byerly's (sp?) and then went... oh no... SHOPPING! AHhHhHhHhH.... at Pier 1, and uhh... where else.... oh ya Target, and then we came home. And then after my mom took a nap, we went out again, this time to Walgreens (my SCM pics are back YAY!) and Petco and Hom Furniture and Home Depot and then we had dinner at the Sample Room in NE Minneapolis. Good burgers... And then we watched Big Fish (GREAT MOVIE) and then I went to bed and now I'm awake again... the same vicious cycle keeps repeating itself...

       So i woke up this morning with a  HORRIBLE COLD.  That's right, a  TERRIBLE HORRIBLE NO GOOD VERY BAD COLD.  Humph. Or as Jazzy would say, Bah (the humbug kind). I was GOING to go to the library, but NOOOOOO. I was GOING to do lots of fun things, but NOT ANYMORE. Cuz of a stoopid cold. Argh. Humph. Moo. Moo moo moo. Hey, mooing is fun! So... we eventually did go see the Bourne Supremacy yesterday. It was good. I won't say any more, for fear of spoiling it. And... OMG $5.65 for a large popcorn?? $4.20 for a medium?? We spent as much on concessions as we did on tickets. So people... stay away from Carmike theater in Mounds View, they charge a BUTTLOAD OF CASH for concessions. Jeez. But if you aren't having concessions, it's a pretty nice theater.  And to whoever YEEAAHHH is... I'll whine if I want to. Hmph.

       So... as you may have deduced... I'm bored at the moment. But then, I'm usually bored, cuz the PLAY IS ALL DONE!!! *sniff* *sniff* WAAAhHHHHH...i know i did this last time but I MISS EVERYONE... i love you all to death! So... yeah. We were gonna go to Mill City Museum and then go see Bourne Supremacy but about a mile away from home my mom said that her neck hurt really bad and we had to go home. She's had a neck problem for a few days now... so now she is asleep in front of the TV and I'm stuck doing nothing but writing. And talking to Naomi. Which is fun.   So... yeah.

       Yeah I saw that Jazmin had one of these and it looked like fun... so I got one of my one. Aren't I special? Oh yes... I MISS ALL THE PEOPLE FROM THE PLAY! WWAAAAHHH I am so BORED. I don't know what I am going to do with myself for a whole MONTH. I am working at the state fair... but that isn't until the 26th. So... I'm stuck cooped up at home forEVER! (Or at least it seems like forever.)    ::edit:: Patrick has a blog too: funformillions.blogspot.com here's jazzys: teapot4life.blogspot.com
