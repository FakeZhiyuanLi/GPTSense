      Nothing much going on.  Dyed my hair last night.  DISASTER in the form of leaving the highlighting chemicals in for 11 minutes too long, resulting in blond-ish orange stripes.  Fun stuff.

             Cor blimey, I taste like  Tea .   I am a subtle flavour, quiet and polite, gentle, almost ambient. My presence in crowds will often go unnoticed. Best not to spill me on your clothes though, I can leave a nasty stain.  What Flavour Are You?

      I'm very exicted.  Brookshire's, based in Tyler, TX, is hiring a corporate attorney.  Clint is applying for it.  I think we really might have a chance with this one - first, because they are wanting a fairly new attorney (probably someone they can mold to what they want), and also not in small part because my grandparents have been friends with the Brookshire family for years.  In fact, I used to play with their grandson, Trent, when I visited over the summer.  I don't know, I have a good feeling about this one, but maybe I am just hoping.  Tyler is a nice town, it would not be a bad place to live...and living withing minutes of my grandparents would be fun, even though I would have to transform into Susie Q. Housekeeper if my grandmother could drop by at random times.  Ah well, I suppose that would be good for me.  Keep your fingers crossed for us!

      This morning, my husband went to get Patrick out of bed, and found that he had rolled from his back to his side!  We were so excited!  :)  He is working on rolling all the way over, but he gets frustrated because his arms get in the way.  What a peanut!  :)  YYYYYAAAAAAYYYYYYYY!

      I just got a perfect score on a 110-question Harry Potter quiz online.  What in heaven's name does that say about me?  I'm a weird combination of proud and appalled.

      A couple of friends of mine delivered severely premature twins a couple of weeks before Patrick was born.  The boy, Alex, died when he was three days old of a brain bleed.  Their little girl, however, has survived, and while she is still in NICU, she has improved dramatically - she weighs 3 lbs, 10 oz and can breathe on her own!  It just made me think about all the blessings in all of our lives...  Not only does seeing a small preemie like that make me appreciate the fact that I have a healthy, BIG boy all the more, but it also makes me think about how Brad and Kelly have been blessed.  Their daughter is going to make it, against all odds, and they think she will be able to go home in about a month.  What a little fighter she is!  They say she smiles a lot now, too.  Her parents have been so wonderful through this entire process.  So she is blessed, too.  As my priest likes to say at the end of every Mass:  God is great, all the time.  All the time, God is great.  I'm feeling very good this morning.  :)

      Let's take stock of the situation:  it is 10:10 p.m. (or something like that, my computer clock is not the most reliable).  I have just eaten a very hurried TV dinner (Lean Cuisine Chicken Alfredo - semi-yummy).  I have not bathed today, so I feel sticky and gross with the humid weather we have been having.  We did have a nice storm this afternoon, but now we are back to just being sticky.  Feeling sorry for myself?  No, not really.  Just kind of tired.  Patrick is being very momma-tropic this evening, meaning that for the most part, he wants me and cries when he is with Clint.  Right now we are taking a break from that, which is nice.  I may go take a bath, but as soon as I get in, he is sure to start wailing again, and then I won't be anything but wet, sticky, and smelly.  I think I will wait until he goes down for the night...even though then I am in danger of falling asleep in the tub.  Not really, though.  Being a parent is the most rewarding thing I have ever done, but it is also the hardest.  It is the end of the month, and we have no money left for diapers, or anything else for that matter.  The 10 days before Clint's next check seem interminable, and we are dining on such delicacies as macaroni and cheese (Kroger brand, 3 for a dollar) and hamburger helper (with veggie crumbles instead of ground beef).  That's all fine and good - at least it makes dinner-making a snap!  But it is frustrating to wait for my job to start.  My dad keeps promising that he will get me trained and I will start soon, but it keeps getting pushed back, and the finances are starting to be pretty sketchy.  It will be OK though.  It always is...and on the bright side, we have really learned how to watch our money, and we fully intend to stick to that once we have a little more wiggle room.  Until then...we just pinch the pennies until they scream, and hope we don't run out of diapers before the end of the month.

      Instead of "Nothing Important Happened Today", the title of this blog should be NOTHING happened today.  Patrick has been fussy most of the day, and I have a lot to get done because we are going to Fort Worth this weekend.  Laundry, dishes, housework - sometimes being a housewife is more taxing than any other job I have ever had.  Stupid, right?  But definitely true.  You would think for a dedicated, reasonalbly intelligent person like myself, keeping a house and a baby would be ridiculously easy, but I guess I am not as domestically inclined as I had hoped.  So why then am I sitting at my computer writing this blog?  I guess it's just because I'm feeling a little overwhelmed, and I know that there is no way on God's green earth that I am going to get everything done before we leave.  However, if I want to get anything done, I suppose that I had better get started.  Cheers.

      Two things today.  First of all, prayers are out to the families and friends of those who  urlLink drowned  at the Fort Worth Water Gardens last night.  I can't even imagine...that has always been a place I have enjoyed when in downtown Fort Worth.  It's hard to imagine something like this happening there.  Second of all, it was on the news this morning that the United States has been  urlLink detaining  a man for seven months in Baghdad without taking the measures appropriate for prisoners-of-war.  Up to this point, I don't comment much on the goings-on in Iraq, because although I am suspiscious of much, I realize that I don't have all the facts and am not any kind of politician or military strategist.  But for the United States to blatantly violate the Geneva Convention, and then to have the nerve to try and defend that decision by saying that the terrorists don't follow it either, horrifies me.  I thought we were supposed to be the good guys.  I thought we were supposed to be better than that.

      Patrick and I are working today!  It feels good to bring in a little money, insignificant though my financial contributions may be.  Usually I dedicate my workday to some purchase we wanted to make but couldn't on our regular income.  Today I am working for Clint's first Father's Day present.  Yay!  I will be able to do something special for him, and that feels good.  All around, in a good mood today.  Patrick is hanging out in his swing looking at the office (he is getting so alert lately!), and I am just sitting waiting for customers.  This is about the easiest job I have ever had, and she only calls me about once every three weeks, so I get to still be mainly a stay-at-home momma, like I like to do.  Mr. Fussypants requires my attention now.  Have a great day!

      Today has been a pretty normal day.  Patrick has been very happy - Clint and I had a great time playing with him when Clint came home for lunch.  On the job search:  SMU was a no-go, but we still have applications out for City of Arlington, University of Houston, University of North Texas, Texas A&M, and Johnson County DA's Office.  Hopefully one of them will come through - I hate seeing Clint stay here now.  It is such a waste of his education and talent, and they won't let him use the skills he has...in fact, truth be told, I think that ever since he passed the Bar, his boss has been a bit threatened by him, or at least that is what the behavior would suggest.  I think I am going to go on Monster.com and look to see what's out there.  Who knows?  I am also going to try to get a web site up for the family sometime soon...goals, goals, goals...so many goals, so much time.

      I'm tired.&nbsp; I wonder what time Patrick will wake up tonight - 1:00, 2:00, even as late as 4:00 (which I would consider a full night's sleep)?  I made a depressing observation today.&nbsp; Clint and I are planning on having 4 children, approximately 2 years apart.  That means that I probably won't get one good night's sleep in at least eight years, maybe more.  I'm tired.

      We watched two good movies tonight:&nbsp;  In America  and  Butterfly Effect .&nbsp; I may watch  In America  again someday.&nbsp; But I will NEVER watch the other again.&nbsp; Actually, God willing, I won't ever think about the other again.    Butterfly Effect  messed with my head like no other movie ever has, and I have seen lots of creepy movies.&nbsp; I am still shaking, and don't know if I will be able to sleep.&nbsp; I just want to hold and kiss my baby.&nbsp; There are images that I hope I can forget.&nbsp; I wish I had never rented it.   I guess the fact that it effected me this way makes it a good movie, or I would be able to separate it from reality.&nbsp; In my mind I can.&nbsp; So why am I still freaked out by it?   If you are a parent, especially a mother, I would not recommend this movie.&nbsp; If you are not, you might like it - but you would be inhuman if you did not find it disturbing.   I wish I had never seen this movie.&nbsp; I hope I can forget it soon.

      It has come to my attention through an anonymous comment (remind me to fix it so people can't comment anonymously...it's kind of annoying, not knowing who wrote you back!) that the article I posted about the Iraq photo is not entirely accurate, and that the sculptor only made the statue because he was well paid.  That may be true, and it would certainly be understandable if it is.  However, that is not really what I was posting about anyway.  We need to stop blaming the soldiers for doing their jobs.  Most of the guys over there right now are guys that honestly want to do the right thing.  Some are in it because they need money for college, or because they didn't go to college and that was their best opportunity.  Some are in it because they have a military family history.  And, yes, some are in it because they think it is the right thing to do.  But what they all have in common is that right now, they are over there, following orders and trying to do the right thing, whatever that may be.  So let's lay off the military.  You know, right now, this is not about Bush or Kerry.  Frankly, I haven't decided yet who will get my vote, and when I do, that knowledge will be kept to myself.  You know what I'm sick of?  Everyone's negativity.  No one wants to hear about anything that is not negative, and if there is something out that is not negative, everyone gets in a hurry to disprove it.  All Bush and Kerry want to do is slam each other.  And that seems to be all America is interested in right now, as well.  Get a grip, people.  Decide in your own mind who you like for President, and who you think is good and who you think is evil.  Discuss among friends.  But I guarentee that neither of these guys are the devil.  So stop acting like you're out there fighting for your own life, and slamming those who have opinions different than yours.  That's what America is all about...and that is why ballots are supposed to be secret.

      Now that we're looking for jobs, things seem to be finally happening, and it is a little scary, because we are going to have to make some risky decisions...  If we get offered our second-choice job, do we refuse it in favor of waiting on our first choice job, even though it is more of a long shot?  A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, so they say...  Or do we seize upon what we have, and the rest be damned?  There's just no knowing...I wish that we had some kind of crystal ball to see what we should do.

       urlLink     This statue currently stands outside the Iraqi palace,  now home to the 4th Infantry division. It will eventually be shipped home and put in the memorial museum in Fort Hood, Texas.   The statue was created by an Iraqi artist named Kalat, who for years was forced by Saddam Hussein to make the many hundreds of bronze busts of Saddam that dotted Baghdad.   Kalat  was so grateful for the Americans liberation of his country; he melted 3 of the heads of the  fallen Saddam and made the  statue as a memorial to the American soldiers and their fallen warriors.  Kalat worked on this memorial night and day for several months.   To the left of the kneeling soldier is a small Iraqi girl giving the soldier comfort as he mourns the loss of his comrade in arms.   Do you know why we don't hear about this in the news?  Because it is heart warming and praise worthy.  The media avoids it because it does not have the shock effect that a flashed breast or controversy of politics does.   So much for the unbiased press.  And thank you to all the soldiers in Iraq and elsewhere...whatever our politics may be, we are thankful for what you have done.

      Found out yesterday that an old high school friend of mine died on Sunday, June 27.  She apparently committed suicide via a drug overdose.  She left behind a baby girl not even a year old.  What could have happened to her that would make her want to leave her child???  This is the worst kind of news.  Devon Palmer, I will miss you.  For the rest of you out there, never let it get that bad.  For yourselves or your loved ones.

      Yes, again, I have let my house get ridiculously messy (mind you, I said "messy" not "dirty" - there is a difference).  And once again, we are going out of town.  Since I hate coming home to a messy house when I am tired from traveling, I am working on cleaning it (right now, just taking a break.)  Have you ever noticed how once your place gets messy, it just keeps getting messier?  A little bit of clutter translates into "the house is already messy, so I don't need to put my clothes in the hamper, or my dishes in the sink, or the peanut butter back in the cabinet."  At least, it seems to be that way to my husband, and sometimes, me too.  ACK!  So then when you finally get around to cleaning, it is much more work than necessary.  And it doesn't help when your baby, usually inclined to nap for at least two hours every afternoon, decides that today would be a grand day to stay awake all day.  I think Patrick must be psychic.  On another note, UNT did not work out.  I think Clint is pretty bummed about it.  Please, let something work for him.  Get him out of this place where they won't let him use his skills and seem to try to keep him down as much as possible.  It is really starting to affect him and I think even the way he thinks of himself.  People always say, if you don't like your situation, change it, don't whine about it.  Well, we are   trying   to change it.  First we tried to change it by changing what he does here, by trying to get him some experience in his skill set.  Now we are trying to change it externally.  God, why isn't anything working?  I know it takes patience, but patience is running thin.  I am fine where I am.  I can be a stay-at-home mother anywhere.  But I don't like Clint to be unhappy, and frustrated.  God, please get him out of here.  On yet another note, is anyone out there?  Does anyone even read this blog, or do I need to go back to LiveJournal so that I at least get some of my friends reading it?  I still read all of   your   blogs, even though they are scattered all over cyberspace.  Are you reading mine??

      Life is good.  Life is  normal .  I like it that way.  Today is a busy day.  We are going out of town for the weekend, and there is always lots to do.  I didn't even realize until now how much extra baggage goes along with a baby who is weaned, on food, and has discovered toys.  Good grief!!!  Patrick has learned to roll over both ways, and now we have had to put a big blanket on the floor for him to play on.  He rolls all over the place, and any toy he comes across goes straight into his little teething mouth.  I can't believe how fast he learns!  And he has started to watch his "Baby Einstein" video for about 10 minutes or so at a time, which is a big improvement on his attention span.  It seems so hard to believe that just four and a half months ago, I brought my tiny little bundle home from the hospital...just a little red guy who slept most of the time, only moved spastically, and had to be coaxed to eat!  Now he is a 16.5 lb, 26.5 inch little punkin who rolls and laughs, smiles, "talks," and eats like a little horse!  He can eat rice cereal, apples, pears, green beans, and carrots so far.  We introduce a new food every three days so that we can tell if he is going to have a reaction to it.  He has also begun to like his paci, and I expect to see a little tooth any day now!!!  Being a mom is the best thing in the world.  I love it.  Yes, I miss the challenge of the workplace from time to time, and miss seeing lots of people every day, but I still wouldn't trade all of that an a million dollars to miss my son's day-to-day life.  I am privileged to be able to work at home.  I don't know if we could hack it with no income from me...it's a two-income world out there!!!  I like my job, and it fits into the corners of my life very nicely.  And of course, the money is appreciated, as is the intellectual stimulation.  I kind of like this computer and engineering stuff.  Who woulda thunk it?  Well, I'm out to continue prepping for our trip.  Peace out, brothas and sistas!

      I went to a reception on Saturday for a good friend of mine, Erin Oates Grant (new name!).  She got married on July 3.  She seems so happy, and I know she will make a great PREACHER'S WIFE!!!  It's funny how sometimes you see people that you haven't seen in awhile, and you feel good about it.  Yep, great to see you again, yada yada yada.  Then you don't really think about them for awhile.  Then there are those people, like Erin for me (and a bunch of my other friends, but this post is dedicated to Erin), that seeing them just makes you realize how much you miss them.  I am so happy for Erin, but now she has married a future preacher from Georgia, so I know that the inevitable will happen.  Actually, it probably already has, if I am being honest with myself.  Our life paths are similar.  But geography is a formidable foe.  Someday soon we will be just Christmas Card friends.  But, hey, that's life!  And I am thankful that hers has turned out so well.
