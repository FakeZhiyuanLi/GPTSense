      so here i am with my stupid broken ankle.  it's been, like 9 weeks and still i'm in the stupid bootie the doc gave me and i'm still unable to walk without crutches. what a total pain in the ass.  i'm begining to get really cranky and depressed from all this already. i have a doc appt. on monday, so maybe the guy will set me free!  God, i hope so. this has been very debilitating.  i hate having to ask for everything from everyone.  i'm used to being pretty self sufficient. at least i've been able to drive for the last few weeks.  i drive with the bootie foot and brake with my left foot.  so far, no problems.  today, i actually went to brake with the bootie and i must say that i got confused for a second.  i got it right pretty quickly, but for a second, i was real nervous.  that was my biggest fear when i started driving with this ankle. geez!  i've been driving for more than 25 years, so i figured i could hande it. sooo, here i sit on the couch, watching tv.  i think i could become a tv producer already with all the watching i've been doing.  i should at least be made one of those neilsen raters, anyway.  i've watched it all...the good, the bad!  the in between!!!!

      hi dana here!  i have waited all my life to have my very own place with which to tell my very own story. here it is folks!  the story of a nice jewish girl growing up on the mean streets of long island, ny.  i know, you're saying to yourselves...mean streets??? is this woman out of her mind?  actually, probably, yes.  i won't argue with anyone that thinks i'm a little nuts.  everyone has the freedom to say what they feel...lol  anyway, since i just set this up, let me say that i don't live on long island anymore.  i haven't lived there in about 25 years.  in fact, i live in south florida right now.  i've been here for about 13 years.  but i'm getting ahead of myself.  right now i'm going to set this up so it looks the way i want and i will then post more of my random thoughts.  i think after i get into the meat of my story, you will be captivated and will want to stay tuned for the ever changing saga that is my life.  and, oh is it a saga!  ok, signing off for now and wishing you well.

      hi... worked my ass of today.  i'm actually glad i was busy.  more money to pay all the late bills.  rick came home last nite and gave me his paycheck...amazing.  i almost shit myself whe he handed it to me. i put it in the bank and hopefully i'll be able to get the late mortgage payment in this week.  i hate being late for bills...especially when the account is in my name! it's been so hard since i broke my ankle.  it's been hard for months really.  before i broke my ankle, i was working full time and rick wasn't.  he stopped working in november and hasn't worked since.  he always manages to get fired right before christmas.  it's been like 3 yeard running that he's lost is job about a week before the holidays. so...dana gets all this money for christmas gifts from my clients and i spend it all on him for christmas and guess what i get???  not much! then i keep working and he lays around and gets fat.  arghhh!  we have about 6 unfinished "projects" in this house.  why can't he finish one thing before he starts another?  it makes me crazy.  i have one bathroom torn up, the floor in the living room isn't finished.  the baseboard in the kitchen isn't finished.  this house once looked so beautiful!  we re-did the house totally when we first got married.  we ripped out walls, floors and ceilings.  we bought all new furniture and carpeting.  we had new kitchen cabinets put in, too.  it was so pretty. then one by one, things went to shit. well, now that he's back to work, we can start to get this jint fixed up.  if he loses his job again, or quits...i'm leaving.  that's that.  no discussion...  anyway, it was scorchingly hot here today.  it rained for a minute, but we need about 5 days of good solid rain.  we are about 5" below the rainfall level for the year.  it doesn't look like it's going to get any better soon, either. my poor plants...they are just wilting terribly... i just read the new people magazine today and there was an article in it about a guy in iraq that's in the army, i think, and he's been blogging about his journey in there.  it was pretty heavy to read.  he has a brother and a sister in the marines and navy if i'm not mistaken.  wow!  the way this boy wrote was amazing.  he needs to become a writer. when i read other people's writing, i feel so inferior.  i hate my vocabulary.  i am really a very bright woman, but i suppose that i'm not as bright as i thought. i'm going to try to expand my writing and see what i am actually capable of.  i tend to write as though i was speaking and not writing as a writer.  doea that make any sense to me?  yeah, it does. i took a sleeping pill and i'm getting tired.  i think it's time to get in the bed and turn off my computer.  i've been sitting on front of it since i got home. oh, i just wanted to say that i just finished the book, five people you meet in heaven.  what a fabulous book.  it was a life lesson, spiritual, thought provoking book that i think i will never forget.  i borrowed it from a friend and before i return it to her, i'm going to scan a few pages of it.  it was written by the man that wrote, tuesdays with morrie.  i have to read that.  mitch ablom is some kind of writer.  he reminds me of the celestine prophecy, a book i read many years ago.  it gets into the nothing happens by accident thinking.  it also speaks of how there are people in your life that affect you life and you don't even have to have ever met them.  vety heavy and really makes oyu think...  okay...off to bed.  i'm beat and it's time. talk to myself tomorrow. ha ha

      the past 2 days, here in palm beach county florida, there has been a news playing out on tv.  a man in our area has a wildlife reuge and cares for several big cats, most of whom are endangered.  one of his tigers, bobo, somehow was able to get out of his compound and the fish and wildlife wardens, as well as the palm beach county sheriff's office, was searching for him.  it was a very difficult search, as threae are bobo was in covered with very heavy brush.  there were many places for bobo to hide and stay cool in our 90 degree heat.  they searched overnite and were unable to locate poor bobo. bobo was a 6 year old tiger that weighed 750 lbs. that had spent his entire life in captivity in this man's compound. the plan was to tranquilize bobo and carry him back to his compound.  not to hurt bobo at all.  well, when a fish and game warden came upon bobo, he claims that bobo turned 180 degrees and was about to attack him, so he shot poor bobo 5 times with a shotgun. WHAT!?!?!? so much for tranquilizing bobo.  so much for trying to rescue him and return him to his compound. nope, he was shot.  how horrible and how sad.  the people in bobo's neighborhood are so sad over this shooting, as am i.  i have 6 cats, and although not BIG cats, they are cats, just the same. this guy was a fish and game warden?????  how the fuck did he get his job???  has he ever been properly trained????  oh my God!!  he had already alerted the other officers that he found bobo, and was waiting for them to arrive with the tranquilizer gun.  he claims that bobo turned on him and he felt threatened.  i'm not buying it.  not at all.  so today...palm beach county florida is is mourning for bobo.... poor bobo...

      sitting here watching the early show, drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes.  ahhhh...the breakfast of champions... i'm traveling on a cruise next september and haven't heard from my roomate all weekend.  hmmm...i really don't know the woman, we met on our cruise line message board and just got along well.  she's a really neat lady and i think this cruise will be a blast. i won't be going with the husband because he doesn't want to go on another cruise for awhile.  whatever...he almost ruined the last one we took in april.  we went on a 10 day cruise through the panama canal.  i had met a group of people from all over the country that were sailng with us and we were very excited to finally be meeting, as we'd been messaging for months.  they were a really nice group of people and we'd never been on a 10 day cruise, so at least I was excited. rick stayed in the cabin the entire trip.  he came out of his hole to eat and went right back to the cabin.  hey, that's not why i go on vacation... he did come out to go ashore, but when we got back to the ship...right into his hole he went!  shit i was soooo pissed.  we even went on a snorkle tour in grand cayman and had to take a small boat out to the snorkle sites.  we were with about 20 other people from our group and when we got on the boat, he pulled a book out of his bag and sat there reading!!!  they were looking at him like he was nuts...which i'm not too sure he isn't. anyway, the last nite we went to the champagne bar and wound up at the piano bar, drinking chocolate martinis.  love those things!  he said he was going down to the casino and we wound up going up to the disco to do some dancing.  we wound up getting pretty smashed and dancing until around 3am.  i was with 3 other couples and had to dance with their husbands because mine was a no show...again! anyway, it was just not the vacation i had expected.  i was very disappointed because i was alone most of the time and it was lonely.  thank God i had my buddies to hang with. anyway, i had this chance to go on this cruise next september and since he doesn't want to go, i'm going without him.  i bet it's my best vacation... so i've been taklking to my new group and staying in touch with my old group.  unfortunately, my old group and i are at odds.  i wanted to coordinate the next cruise in 2006 with a tour company i've worked with recently and one of the guys in the group has a control issue, so he fired off some pretty nasty emails.  i feel so bad.  i will not be posting with them anymore.  i didn't make that suggestion to get in a pissing contest.  i did it so we could all save some money.  whatever!  what a jerk he turned out to be... i'm going to try doing the group cruise without him.  fuck it, i was a travel agent for about 5 years and i think it'll be fun to coordinate this. rick said he'd even go.  amazing! so guess i have to get ready for work.  i have nothing on my book today, so i don't know why i'm going in, but i have got to try and make some money.  i'll go in for a few hours anyway... it's off season here so my business is slow.  it picks back up in a few months.  can't wait for that.  i hate being so slow. off to make the donuts....no, that's not what i do for a living..  har dee har

      good afternoon. i'm still here.  i guess i stayed away for so long that now coming back has given me the bogger bug. i ranted on my latest blog, and now i'd like to just chatter. i am married to a man that i've known for almost 13 years.  actually it's longer than that.  i met him in august of 1993, shortly after i was released from the hospital.  i managed to really do a number to myself in a car accident in '92 and it took a year for me to be able to walk again. anyway, i digress... when we met, i was totally not interested in him.  i wanted his friend.  it was that old story of the woman becoming friends with a guy to get his friend.  well, it turned on me and i wound up falling for the guy i was friends with. we spent the next 6 years going back and forth, back and forth.  we went out, broke up, went back and broke up again.  i lived with him twice and both times there was another woman in the picture and he threw me out.  weird relationship.  anyway, he met some woman and they got married.  it was a totally covert move and no one knew about it until it was done.  needless to say, i was devastated by it.  it tore me up to see them together. i moved on and so, i guess did the woman...actually he wound up throwing her out when she came home one night without her panties.  she'd misplaced them! she called me, drunk. to tell me that she was going to shoot him, and against my better judgment, i called him to tell him.  well...one thing led to another and we wound up back together again.  he finally got his divorce and we settled in for a relationship.  yeah, right. i settled in for the relationship, he just continued to sleep with everything that crossed his path. he met another woman, needless to say, and we broke it off again. it took me sometime to get over that, but i eventually moved on.  i met a great guy, we fell in love and we were married about a year into our relationship.  craig was a great guy...still is.  about 4 months into the marriage, craig started drinking and disappearing.  he wasn't with other women, he was with his drinking buddies.  i spent an additional 6 months or so dealing with that crap, until i finally threw him out. i got a divorce about 1 1/2 yrs. after we were married.  that was in 1997. nw, while i was getting my divorce, my husband started to come around again.  he was still seeing the same woman he met when we broke up. i fell right back into the lies and intrigue of a relationship with him.  why?  good question.  i guess i'd have to chalk it up to lack of self-esteem.  i was willing to take whatever i got. well, we went on that way for another couple of years.  stupid me! around october of 1999, i decided i'd finally had enough!  i was through with him and the bulls**t that came with him and i told him so.  he didn't believe me and i can't say i'd have blamed him.  i kept falling back into his crap. i decided to start fresh...move on...build a life for myself that did not include him! i dated a few men.  they were ok.  i met a man on the internet that was just great, except he lived 3 hours away.  we met a few times and he was just fabulous!  i was crazy about him. during this time, rick and i had minimal contact.  he knew i'd met a great guy from out of the area, and it was driving him crazy.  tough sh**!  i was finished with him... well, to make a long story endless...rick asked me to marry him and to let him spend the rest of our lives making up for all the bad crap he'd thrown at me for 6 years. i said yes.  WHAT WAS I THINKING????? we were married in november of 1999.  he has been great!  totally NOT the jerk i was fooling around with for so long.  he was faithful, honest, caring and loving.  wow!  talk about a leopard changing his spots!  he was a new man!  it was great!!! so here i sit almost 5 years later and i have to say, i really don't like him.  it's a fact.  he's been faithful and all that, but we have grown in 2 completely different directions. i've always known that i was smarter and better educated than he was, but the difference i now glaringly apparent.  i stay current on the world news and things going on in the world around us in general.  this man lives in some time warp.  a stupid time warp.  he will not watch tv unless it's a re-run of some jean claude vandamme movie or worse, steven segal horror.  he has gotten so fat even he is uncomfortable from it.  he has become a pig.  not just a leaving the socks on the floor pig...he's become a pig as far as his personal hygiene is concerned. conversations with him are nearly impossible.  he's become a moron.  i hate to say this, but i have to say that it is 100% the truth.  i knew this might be a problem when we got married, but i never imagined just how much it would effect how i think of him.  we have absolutely nothing in common anymore.  it's making me crazy. i like to speak with people that are on my intelligence level and can have a challenging conversation with me.  i love to learn new things from the people around me.  rick has nothing to teach me, nor can he challenge me in a conversation in any way. it's all too bizarre, really.  i'm lonely and there are 2 people in this house. i feel like i'm alone when we're together.  most of the time, i just don't really even want to talk to him. so...here i am...i have to make some very heavy decisions.  do i stay...do i go? if i go...how do i make that first move? oh god!  i sound like an oprah segment!  it sounds like i need dr phil.  how did this become my life?? lots of questions to ponder and lots of directions i could take. i really needed to see this in black and white.  it becomes more real for me this way.  i feel as though i really need to get off the proverbial pot when i'm faced with my feelings in a hard copy. my horoscope told me to go to people that were older and wiser for council, not that i buy horoscopes much. but this one did have a point. ok, off to ponder the incredible...

      i guess i've been really slack, as it's taken me almost a month to get back to this blog.  sorry, i'll try to do better. i finally got the bootie off of my ankle and now i hobble around like an 80 yr. old.  it sucks.  i spent a year in the hosptal back in '92-'93 and i have a slight limp because of the hip i shattered in a car accident.  i guess i'm supposed to be grateful that i can walk at all after what happened, but my gratitude has gotten a gut punch.  i still have the limp on my left side, and since i broke my right ankle, now i don't know which way to limp!  my left ankle is crappy to begin with and now, i've added the right ankle to the mix!  arghhh!  it's no one's fault.  they were both accidents so i can't pint a finger at anyone or anything. it's a tad depressing really.  it's not like i was some outdoor freak or anything, it's just that i like to dance and i LOVE high heels.  those are both out of the question for now.  hopefully they'll come back. in the meantime, i sit alot and my ankle hurts like hell.  i have a dr. appt. next week, so maybe we'll find something we can doo to remedy the situation.  on to better things... yesterday, i went to see farenheit 9/11.  now, let me start by saying that george w. bush is one of my least favorite people in the world. in fact, i can not stand the man! so, going into the film i am already biased, and i am already aware of a lot of the facts that moore presents.  i was, however, not prepared to receive the gut punch i experienced watching this film.  there was one point in the film, that he was showing the planes hit the towers of the world trade center.  i'm not sure if the bulb in the projector wasn't working correctly, or if the theater manager decided to censure the film, but during that moment in the film, the screen went dark and all we had was the sounds of the attack.  was it supposed to be that way?  i have no idea.  i didn't think, and i still don't think, i could sit through watching that again.  just listening to it made me cry.  i'm not sure how i'd have handled watching that again.  having grown up in ny and spent a long time liveing in nyc, it was a terrible time in my life to have to watch my beautiful city and the people that live there decimated in such a horrific manner.  it still tears at me 3 years after the fact. well, now getting back to the movie...there i sat rivited by the fact that after the entire united states was shut down for all air traffic, the 100 something members of the bin laden family were shuttled out of the country.  i guess a few billion dollars worth of frequent flier miles helps, eh?  the billions of dollars worth of ties to that family by the bush family are unbelieveable. i've been angry when i think about our current administration and now i fuming!  to what lengths are they going to go to hide the truth?  how many more have to sacrifice their lives for this family and this administration? unfortunately, i am married to a republican that has no idea.  no concept of what has been done to this country in the hands of the bush clan.  he doesn't look at the cost of living, the lower income we both are able to bring in, the health care we cannot afford.  he sticks his head in the sand and asks,"what can mr. kerry do?"  he doesn't realize the republicans are about feeding the rich and who cares about the lesser few?  he has no conception that there is no longer a middle class.  i grew up middle class...i work my tail off, as does he and we are still not able to maintain a level of security financially to be considered middle class.  the democrats are mostly blue collar and middle income people.  folks like you and me. i refuse to discuss politics at home.  i get so angry i'd beat him if he wasn't so big...(laughing at that one!) anyway, i felt a great desire to vent.  what better place to do that than here??  no one can argue with my feelings...i love that! i have to imagine that this blog is probably going to attract some unwanted attention.  i'll probably have the cia knocking at my door tomorrow because i mentioned bin laden and the bush names in one place!  so much for the patriot act! ok, it's time to refresh my coffee and get on with the chores i have today. bye for now...
