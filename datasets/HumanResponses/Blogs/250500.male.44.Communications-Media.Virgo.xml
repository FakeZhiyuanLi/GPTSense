      Making waves already. Thanks to the good offices of Captain Cadbury, we're now Number 1 on Google.co.uk for  urlLink young leith team YLT . Maybe soon we'll get a reputation for Mozart's later quartets.  The Leither Dot Net is now read in the USA, Netherlands, Canada, Germany, France, Australia, Ireland, Japan and Spain. A local blog for all the people.  Very well done to all contributors! Bonus cheques on their way.   Comment Policy.  I was hoping not to have one, but lately there's been a bunch of CAPITALISED (MEANS SHOUTING) OFFERINGS, containing obscenities and little else.   Most of these have been removed. Because I can. Said writer is not yet banned though, to allow him time to consider his ways. Three and four in the morning are not generally good times for comments.   In brief...   Comments are of course very welcome. All we ask is that you behave as you normally would when visiting someone. Don't swear. DON'T SHOUT. Do be interesting and do relate to the topic.   Thank you. I can see we'll get on just fine.

      As our Beloved Editor quite rightly states, Leith is beset with flying insects, which get right up yer nose. These little Bastards are actually Flying Ants, which congregate in Mid-Air Swarms, for the principal reason of Shagging, purely and simply because they can.  OK, they're a bloody pest when you're minding your own business and quietly getting on with eating a Pierinos Potato.But try to remember, these beasties only get one chance of a decent shag in their lives!   Not only that, the Males, once replete, merely fly off to oblivion and die quietly and happily, which pleases the Females enormously, as they get a year of peace to themselves, to have babies, sleep late and nae doot go to the bingo!   Next year, assuming the Sun is splittin' the trees, the bairns are kickin' their height, and one of them spot Peter havin' a scran, or sittin' outside the Malt and Hops, then the whole process begins all over again, thereby giving our much-loved Lord and Master something to write about in his Blog.  So there! Now ye know! Let them get on wi' it in peace!

      Once more, a routine (and compulsory) visit to the Port O' Leith has ended back at the keyboard. Several previous invitations have resulted in me losing patience trying to select a username sufficiently weird for nobody else on the planet to have thought of it.  So, here's me. I have lived in Leith, just up the lane from the previously mentioned establishment, on and (more often) off for 18 years. Don't know if I qualify as a Leither yet - depends who you talk to. More often off because I spend most of my time cruising the world's oceans in unashamed luxury on board ship. The Island Princess? The QE2? No such tat for me. Large containerships. Basically a big box full of little boxes, a point on the front and a BIG engine at the back, all shoved through the water by "thae big brass fans", as one Captain once described the props. I am an engineer, and will go no further down that path, as it bores the crap out of most people (even worse than golf or cricket.  Leith, then. Huge changes from the early days. Property prices have gone berserk - much to my advantage - and I am probably in one of the oldest 'conversions' in Leith. Visited by me in 1986 during a rainstorm. I arrived dripping wet (motorbike, you see), had a quick sketch round the show flats, and was about to leave, unimpressed. "Have you seen the garage?" a voice said from the darkened Barratt office in a corner. Twenty minutes later, I arrived back home and announced to my mother that I had bought a flat in Leith. I think she fainted.  I am still here. Must be doing something right...

      Leith is covered with horrible black flies at the moment. Not those tiny harvest flies, so small that you wonder how they pack all the organs in, but substantial creations, about half an inch long.  Mostly they're on the pavements, scurrying about aimlessly, but the braver ones go on your clothes or even in your hair. Quite ghastly. Constitution, Bernard and The Shore were crawling, so I couldn't even sit on the dockside steps outside Malmaison to eat a Pierino baked tattie.   Alastair from  urlLink The Village  was 45 yesterday. He'd mentioned it to me the previous day, but drunk as I was, it completely slipped. Marge and Norrie from Malt and Hops had got him a game called Drinking Chess. "Pawn cocktail" I quipped, but no-one noticed.  Happy Birthday Ally, from all at Leither Dot Net.

      Well, it's finally happened.  urlLink The Village  has given in to popular demand, and is now covered in  YLT  logos. For those genteel souls amongst us, not resident in Leith,the initials YLT stand for  Young Leith Team . These are the resident gang, who through the years, have not as such metamorphosed, rather than mutated through generations of Mods, Bovver Boys, Casuals etc.  My personal opinion has always been, that rather than send American Special Forces and SAS to the mountains of Afghanistan in the hunt for Osama, the YLT, if invited, would have steamed in, found him, fucked him and been Hame again to sell the guns, in time for the Christmas rush in Glasgow.    Onyways, Ally and Dolly have commissioned a rather tasteful Muriel for the Frontage of the Pub and very cunningly included the Gang Signature in the designwork. This ensures not only will the team leave the pub alone in future, but will guarantee anyone interfering with "Their Boozer" will suffer immediate and painful retribution! If this in time drives the insurance premiums down, well, what a bastard that'll be!  Mind you, Nae Doot the "Environmental Art", finished in time for the Festival, will be well publicised in all sections of "the Meedja" and also shown on worldwide telly.  The only downside is, that every time an American Tourist gets "Done Over" in Leith, he'll be able to boast of a passing, but telling, acquaintance with the Leith Team. Ach Weel, it's a' publicity, and with the price of a glass of wine, falling with the Insurance Premium, it'll be worthwhile. (Are you listening Ali?)

       The most expensive bathroom shop in Leith has gone bust.&nbsp; You know the one, by the Scottish Office with that&nbsp;teak bath in the window.&nbsp; And the kitchen shop just along the block. David James.   Fascinating to see that even liquidation sales have now gone high-tech.&nbsp; You can&nbsp;tender for&nbsp;the whole lot online at  urlLink www.sweeney-kincaid.com .&nbsp; They've photographed every item, stuck a lot number on it and plonked it on the web, e-bay style.&nbsp; I'm going to bid for the 16.5" waterproof LCD bathroom TV (with heated screen).&nbsp; Oh, and a bath, we don't have one in our house yet (but not the&nbsp;teak one - we've got woodworm).   I wonder why they went out of business?&nbsp; If you think about it, there are very few successful 'up-market' shops in Leith.&nbsp; I reckon that property prices are so high you have no choice but to live with the shite bathroom and kitchen the developer puts in.&nbsp; Perhaps Harvey Nicks did the right thing when they shunned Ocean Terminal.   We had lunch in the 'eat yourself stupid for a fiver' Chinese just along the road in Commercial Street.&nbsp; Alice and I were the only ones in there.&nbsp; The owner sat glumly in the window with his chin in his hands while the tons of uneaten buffet baked under the lamps.&nbsp; Do I sense another business going down the pan?   ...and later...   to the Port O'Leith Bar, where a lovely 22 year old Polish girl came in and asked for a job.&nbsp; Mary took her phone number and CV then, after she'd left, she took down a couple of those picture frames full of foreign bank notes (regulars will know what I mean) and proceeded to remove some of the strange notes.&nbsp; Dave and I reckon they were the Polish Zlotych notes to pay her for her first shift.&nbsp; She doesn't miss a trick, our Mary.

                                Best no' bother Son.   It is agreed by many, that the only thing sensible about the Super-lush George Best was his excellent decision to come and play for Hibs in the Eighties. ( Jambos eat your heart out! ) While I heartily concur with this Sentiment, it angers me greatly to read now, that the Great Man is now being credited with the marked decline in the "Great Liver Donor-Missing Numbers Scandal" Bollocks. As the figures show, only 10% of recipients of new Liver Operations are alcoholics, this Mass Hysteria is groundless.     Well Fuck the PC. Prats and Holy Willies. I have a Cunning Retaliatory Plan!      As a Weel-Kent Lush in my time, (although never aspiring to Besties Standards), I made a decision to donate my liver for transplant upon the occasion of my demise. However, I made the stipulation that the Organ was to go only in the direction of a deserving Alcoholic.  Well fuck me. The furore this caused was incredible! If I'd said "Whites only" I could understand it, but it seemed the whole Medical World was up in arms over what I considered a rather sensible idea, and, at the same time, hitting back at the "Alcoholics are Bad Men" paranoia. Now the powers that be, while happy to accept my Liver, (They havenae seen it yet!) have declined the proviso, while assuring me that NO conditions are acceptable.   Where does this leave me? Hitherto to now Gentle Reader?   Sensible comments in Chav Gavs comment box please!                                                          Cheers!                                                                   Captain Cadbury.

      Hiya! Lots going on pubwise at the moment. (That's  atm  for those of you who ken these things!)   First off - checked out the  Waterline On The Shore  on the first day of its non-smoking policy.  Was OK.  But you got to sit in the dingy back bar to escape from vile tobacco. All the rest you can smoke your head off. I even saw packs of Golden Virginia on the bar tables. How common is that?    Next I learned that  the Village  is about to expand its horizons - by quite a few miles, in fact. No names - no pack drill. Torture itself couldn't drag those matters out of me.  And finally...   "Kevin Hay is my manager," said Steven of  Bar Java ... gloating, in the way only queens can do when they've got an alpha straight guy between their knees. Bar Java has acquired  the Commplex  in Commercial Street.  All we need now is Marks and Spencer and Philip Green! It's  that  exciting. Not.    My spies tell me that Tony the Hat knows a lady of substance who wants to invest in  Leith FM . But she wants audience figures. Apparently there aren't any.  Funny old world. Babs says it's all old boys' network.  Big Robert was intrigued by that also.  (The key impression in the Port was that the money shouldn't go to style bras for "you know who".) Enough. Nae mair.    The (paper) Leither came out today, with a blistering attack on  Britannia Spice  restaurant, Commercial Street. "Do they advertise?" asked Ally from the Village, who  does  advertise with that monthly rag.  "Seems not - " I replied, " - so what a fabulous twist on  protection money!  Advertise with us or we'll rip yer fucking business to shreds!!"  Remember  Leither Dot Net  accepts no advertising shilling whatever. Our valued reviews are beyond purchase. (And yes - we agree that Britannia Spice is a load of over-priced tat.  Avoid it at all costs. )  See ya - probably ra'morra! Two great stories just below this. Free.

      Last week saw my first visit to the shiny new Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.   I sat in the small screened cubicle waiting for my x-rays to arrive.  I'd been questioned, prodded, tapped, sounded, and squeezed.  The doctor had mentioned, and then consulted, a surgeon.  I don't mind admitting that if my condition wasn't related to my digestive system, I'd be shitting myself.  She returned and consulted the slides, made several "hmmmm" noises then delivered her verdict.  The crown I'd swallowed, all half inch of ceramic and half inch of metal spike, had passed naturally through my system and the pain I was experiencing was it's legacy, which would heal itself, no surgeon required.  Relief flooded through me but it was quickly tempered when she delivered a caveat, the surgeon had told her to check that I wasn't passing blood.  Yike! I'd never given a stool sample before, how did that work? Did it involve fishing in the bowl with a long spatula or would I have to try and squeeze out a really thin one? Would I be given a funnel?  But it was worse. She was going to administer the check via the medium of rubber glove and lubricant.  Double Yikes!! In the 36 years since it's creation my anus had adhered to a strict NO ENTRY policy, a rule that had never once been violated. Ever. I started to blush.  I tried to talk her out of it but "I'm feeling much better now" and "Thanks but that won't be necessary" cut no ice. She meant it and I wasn't getting out unless I complied.  So I dropped my keks, lay on my side and let her pop my cherry. How fucking uncomfortable. I felt like I'd just discovered what they do with all the unwanted fruit that visitors bring in.  I got dressed with as much dignity as I could muster as she applied my shit to some litmus type paper. My face was burning with embarrassment.  The test was negative so I was free to go, but not before I opened my mouth and took my shame to a new level.  "Thanks for all your help, it was nice meeting you."  She exploded into laughter as I scurried out the door.  Time was when the loss of a tooth meant monetary reward in the form of a few shiny coins that magically appeared under my pillow, not a fisting from a short, fat Aussie bint.  Toothfairy my arse, I want my Mum.

      It did mah wee hert proud, over the course o' the weekend, to see that the owners of Fibber Magees, an Irish pub in Belfast, I think,(Sub please check) have decided that in the face of drastically reduced profits to call time on NON smokers!  Gosh! What a To Do! OOH! I Say! Not only sticking it up the PC. Prats, but the Government as well!      How they get on, remains to be seen, but they say if they're  Getting Fucked, they're they're going down, (or is that up?) in a cloud of smoke. Hats off Gentlemen, and power tae yer elbix.   Incidentally, has anyone noticed how ex-smokers swiftly jump on a soapbox, about the "Filthy Habit" they left behind? Also they seem to develop a selfish streak where none was apparent previously. For instance, I give you our very own Illustrious Editor and Leader-Off, Peter. Now I know he struggled manfully with Willpower, Cold Turkey and the dreaded Patches, while attempting to deny the Evil Weed, However, after years of stopping and starting, he finally achieved Superstardom in "The Bingo"  (Oops, wrong story!)and stopped forever. However, when I asked him to lend me the instrument of his victory, the Alan Carr Stop Smoking Diet Book, he told me in that personable way of his to "Fuck Off and buy it yourself!"  Now after listening to Peter Grump and Groan about smokers for long enough, on the very cusp of almost breaking my resolve, he resorts to his new brethrens ideals and says a lofty "No"  Well, See me? I'm going to stop smoking, using willpower only, and not only that, I'm going to do it first time. So There!!      In the meantime, " Gie's a Fag Gav, m'chokin' here! "  Written by Captain Cadbury.

      The Waterline on the Shore are busy promoting what they call "Leith's only non smoking bar" at the moment.  Due to open on Monday 19th July, they say it will offer "a designated bar where you can eat and drink in a totally smoke-free atmosphere".    It's certainly a bold move to make - being the first ones in the area to actively ban cigarettes in part of their pub - especially as other publicans are so nervous about offending smokers and losing business.  Personally, I welcome the idea - if for no other reason than it gives punters a choice over whether to be smoke-free or not - but I guess only time will tell how successful it might be.

      Always a pleasure to receive a letter from old mucker  urlLink (Marky) Mark Lazarowicz,  our intrepid Leith MP. I'm sure Mark won't mind The Leither Dot Net reproducing his letter here.   Dear Leither Dot Net  I am writing to you because I know you are interested in the community in Leith.  As you may know, Edinburgh Leisure is considering the possible closure of Leith Waterworld in order to save costs.  I know that many local people are extremely unhappy about this  urlLink possible closure.  I have therefore launched a petition against this closure. This petition is supported by Malcolm Chisholm MSP, and Councillor Phil Attridge.  I hope that we can get sufficient signatures to persuade Edinburgh Leisure to keep Leith Waterworld open.  Yours sincerely, Mark Lazarowicz   (You can get your own copy of the petition from the Constituency Office, 86 - 88 Brunswick Street, Edinburgh. 0131 557 0577)    Leither Dot Net says: wasn't this facility built with public money, and if so why doesn't the public still own it?   Leither Dot Net also knows of a local concern keen to buy the premises should they become available.   Leither Dot Net.  First with all the local news.

      Some of you may have been lucky enough to have heard Scotland's premier radio station, Leith FM, when it was on-air recently during the Leith Festival.  In fact some of you were lucky enough to have been on it!  We really want to make Leith FM a permanent feature by winning one of the new community radio licences so we're planning another 28 days on-air in November.  It doesn't come cheap though, even for community stations (the licences alone cost around £4,000 for 28 days).  So, Leith Community Mediaworks (the organisation behind Leith FM and the planned Leith TV) are having a fund raising night!   When:  Thursday 29th July 7.30 pm to 1.00am .  Where:  The Lighthouse on The Shore, Leith .  What: A fun packed evening with non-stop entertainment, drinks promotions and more.  Already confirmed are comedienne Susan Morrison, live local bands and top DJ Lennie Love from 11.15pm to round off the night.  How much:  £5 for LCM members & guests, £7 for non-members .  Help make Leith FM a reality - spread the word.  For tickets telephone  0131 554 5304  or e-mail   urlLink danielle@leithmediaworks.co.uk    If you can't make the fund-raising night but want to be involved with Leith FM, there are two open days on  Saturday 24th and Sunday 25th July from 1pm to 4pm  at our offices at 19 Broad Wynd (just off the Shore by the Malt & Hops). Meet some of those already involved in things, get an overview of operations, find out how you can get involved!!   Though already in a buzz of production (short films, local history, music videos, current affairs and local interest programmes are all in the pipeline) we are EXTREMELY interested in new ideas/projects and EXTREMELY keen to enlist any available technical/ practical help where necessary.  Leith FM - make it happen!

      Ever get those great titles in your head, and then you've got to write the story to go with it? This is one of them. Well - so am I, some people say, but that's a whole other tale indeed.  Claire (Princess Test Tube) and Fiona (Fifi la Wok) were post mortem-ing  urlLink T in the Park  yesterday in  urlLink The Village .  "The Darkness weren't up to much," Fiona declared, as she tried to hold her double gin steady. (Post-festival shakes. Ye'll have had them yersel') "I only stayed for two numbers. But Basement Jaxx were brilliant."  "And Scissor Sisters too," Claire chirped. "The very best."  "How did you get into them?" Fiona demanded. "Lucky bitch!"  "We crawled under the tent," Claire laughed. "My friend got captured, but while they were dealing with her, I just got in. They stripped off bollock naked in the end."  "It's a pity that lead singer's gay," Fiona said. "And weren't those toilets boggin?"  "You could smell them from a hundred yards," Claire agreed.  "Honestly, Peter," Fiona said to me. "You just had to squat down and pee where you were. Mebbe get somebody to stand in front of you."  She left then, for her shift in one of Leith's most glamorous restaurants. "Ah'm no touchin' knives today," she swore. "Too shaky."

      I can understand, just, that the law frowns upon the pastime of "Chasing the Dragon". However my comprehension begins to waver when I hear that the act itself is deemed to be fine, but the possession of the Dragon is the sticking point. (I kept a dragon once. Ate me out of house and home, then left me to go to Boston.)  All fine and well so far, but where does it leave me when I find out that the highest-ish court in the land got together this week in "The Port", to thrash out (sic) the future of Parental Child Chastisement by Clout.   Fuck me!   When I was a bairn my Ma would skelp me with great glee if I so much as called her a Withered old Bag. Never did me any harm etc. etc.   What's going wrong here? Are they all Fucking Potty, or is it just me?  Our Lord and Master is massacreing Iraqi brats by the dozen,(Collateral Damage?) but you try walloping your snivelling little darling with the back o' yer hand, and the P.C. Prats have a warrant in their hippers, an' it's nae pub for you the 'night gadge!   The Social will run riot - new blood and the Aphrodisiac of Power surging through their veins - Viagra sales will plummet, the boozers will empty and no-one will be available to sign on 'cos they've all been banged up!   Hibs will be playing to an even emptier ground. (The Jambos will be ok, cos they eat their young.) And the whole Leith economy will grind to a halt. You couldn't make it up. (I just did!)

      There's a camaraderie exists in the smoke hut in my work.  As modern day pariahs we defiantly band together in the furthest corner of the car park, huddled together in our 16ft x 8ft glass and metal commune.  Our addiction recognises no social boundaries and this shack is home to a broad cross-section of workers from Director to Toilet Cleaner, where all are equal and everyone is welcome.  Hey, it doesn't even have a door, just walk right in and tell them Allen Carr sent you.  Meeting each other here several times a day, we inevitably gain an insight into each other's lives and five-minute friendships are formed. I may not know which department the person I'm talking to actually works in, but I know their name, marital status, the area that they live, what they did at the weekend, taste in music, etc.  Who says we're unsociable?  Take this morning for example. I arrive to find only Billy present.  As we're chatting I start to get distracted; there's something different about him.  I run through a checklist: Haircut - no. New glasses - no. Sex change - no.  Then I spot it.   Normally I'd point out his gaffe and scream with laughter whilst calling anyone that could hear me to come and witness his mistake. But I stop myself. This is Billy. A kindred soul. A fellow outcast. One of US.  I've got to tell him tactfully and with a straight face.  "Billy, you're wearing your polo shirt inside out."  "What? Aww shit, what a fucking arsehole. Thanks CG."  "No problem Comrade."  I even waited until he was out of earshot before laughing.

      I've been standing at the bus stop for twenty minutes. The bus shelter isn't fulfilling its job description and the rain is being driven in by a cold, hard wind. Finally, my bus appears in the distance. Just as I step forward a car pulls into the bus stop and its passenger window is wound down. Bollock's, they look like tourists and that means only one thing, they're going to ask me directions.  Dilemma. Do I: a) Try to ignore them b) Pretend to help but quickly deny I've heard of their destination c) Do the right thing and help them if I can.  Well a) is out of the question as I'm the only one at the stop, and b) isn't really in my nature having been raised as an honest Leith laddie (cough) so it's c) by default. But quickly.  Me: "Where ye goin' tae pal?"  Tourist: "Eh, we eh, go breanya."  Me: "Sorry mate, ah dinnae ken whit yer sayin."  Tourist: "Eh, breanya. Eh, Leet doc."  Language barrier. I don't speak Italian and they don't speak Leith. I quickly consult my mental Leith/Italian phrase book. Sussed it. They want to go to Britannia at Leith Docks. Easy.  I look up to see that my bus is only 500 yards away but there's another stop before it gets to me and people are waiting there. I deliver the directions in one breath.  "Ye go straight up this road tae the big roondaboot, take the last exit oan the right, when ye reach the second crossroads turn left then straight oan and yer there."  The guy looks completely puzzled. I could be talking in Klingon for all he knows so I repeat the instructions, in English, forcing myself to speak slower.  He gets it this time, smiles, thanks me and WHOOOOSH, my bus goes speeding by.  "AW FUCK OFF," I shout at the rapidly disappearing bus. The tourists assume this is directed at them and do just that. At speed.  So I return to the 'shelter' to sulk. Then two realisations dawn on me.  Firstly, the route I've just given them, so easily recalled, goes right past my front door. Shit, if I'd been thinking I could've got a lift. It's worked before.  Secondly, an obscure memory from my teenage years emerges. Everyone who lives in this city is routinely asked directions by a tourist. Everyone. So my mates and I had devised our own witty response which we always employed, it went:  Tourist: "Can you tell me how to get to the Castle?"  Us: "Yeah, do you know where the Western General Hospital is?"  Tourist: "No."  Us: "Good, because the Castle’s nowhere near there. To get to the Castle you go straight down this road..."  Hilarious huh? We thought so.  Not so funny now though. Not when you consider where I'm standing, right now, at this particular bus stop. Can you guess where it's located? Go on, guess.  Yup, I'm standing right outside the fucking Western General Hospital. In the pissing rain. With no bus in sight.  Karma sucks.  Whoops

      "They're certainly ruining all of this," my friend Stuart said yesterday. He's here on a short holiday from Auchtermuchtie. "Soon ye'll no be able tae see Fife at all!"   We were sitting on the balcony of the Ocean Bar, looking out over the building site that has replaced what once was a lovely view of the river and the hills.   "That's nothing though, Stuart," I said to him. "You should see the monstrosity they've built outside Malmaison Hotel... totally blocks the sea view from the entire Shore area."  We sipped our Guinnesses. "And of course where now there's Rennie's Isle there once was a great view also," he reminisced. "And what the hell's that farce they've thrown up in Coburg Street?"  "You mean the white, blue and yellow abortion behind the church?" I asked. "That's the one they're calling Benidorm already."  And then our conversation moved on. But it's true. I blame Morrison Homes, Gregor Shore, Forth Ports Authority and Edinburgh City Council. They and others have  ruined  our town. And they're not finished yet. Oh no. Still lots of dosh in the puggies. Time for a few in-depth audits, if you ask me.  New York, New York - indeed.

      I just took my six year old daughter, Alice, to bank her cash.  Last week she bought herself a set of roller blades for £24.99.  She occasionally chums me to the local bars, namely the Compass, the Malt & Hops, Bar Java and the Port O'Leith, where she now announces herself as 'Alice the walking swearbox'.  Strangers beware.  This child knows what she is doing.  Behind that cute smile is a ruthless business kid.  You're allowed one swear word for 10p, 3 for 50p or 5 for a pound.  Payment in advance 'on account' is encouraged.  This week she bumped into Donnacha, our local Dubliner, who can regularly be seen wandering around Leith with a Thai girl on each arm.  Within 15 seconds she gave him her usual smile and demanded her money for the offending expletive.  "Fook off you little turd, oi'm Oirish, oi fookin' swear, roit.  If oi start payin' you you'll fookin' bankrupt me!".  Unpeturbed, she smiled sweetly and roller bladed down the bar to hang around the most unsavoury looking bunch - more likely to swear, you see.  You have to learn to take the knocks in Leith.

      It’s a joy to celebrate the V first of this inaugural launch with a few healthy tit-bits from the world of celebrity. I kid you not.  But, we will start with a slightly lesser known starlet - although never the less, larger than life.  I was cruising through the aisles of “Un Natural” today - you know the shop - right opposite Marks & Spastics in the Ocean Termination. When who did I cop a feel of but, the great and mighty “Granny La-bagh”! Just down for a donder from the Metropolis Muchty.   He was tossing up between an earthenware Buddha and plaster of Paris Jesus.  “Who needs to be good when you can buy religion for 1.99? Life’s a breeze, doll!”  Granny will be carving out your future on Thursday 8th July at 5.00pm. Reading tarots in the lounge of  urlLink The Village.   But back to the real Celebrities. The Stereophonics, The Darkness, & Westlife are all staying at The Glasshouse at the top of the Walk, this very weekend for  urlLink T in the Park . Happy stalking, Girls.  Posted by I. C. Deadpeople.

      When I first visited Edinburgh in the late-80s, I'm not sure I would have dared set foot in Leith.  Back then, other genteel Edinburgh folk would recount horrifying stories about the area, likening it to a seedy and violent wilderness - the home of prostitutes, salty sea dogs, and many of society's neredowells.  But of course those stories aren't true today.  Leith may have a predominently working-class background, but I have always found the people in this part of the city to be both warm and friendly.  A few working girls are still to be found in the area (or so I'm told), but Leith certainly doesn't live up to its reputation.  Of course, there have been a lot of changes in the area over the last few years.  New luxury housing developments are springing up on an almost daily basis, transforming disused brown-field sites, which in itself attracts ever more investment into the area in the form of trendy new restaurants, bars, shops, and hotels.  There's also a vibrant and ever-growing business community of IT, media, and design companies concentrated in the area.  The transformation of the area has been so great, that Leith is now at the top of many people's list of places to live and work.

      Pretty shitty weather these last couple of weeks, doncha think? I was checking through my records last night, and noting that last July it was in the mid twenties for a lot of the month.  Bring on the sun, The Leither says! We can handle it.  And that's enough from me, your Editor, for now. The next voice you hear will be from one of our feisty reporters!   Kirsty Wark, eat yer heart oot, hen!

      This is very exciting! The first ever community weblog  for  Leith people,  by  Leith people!  Here you will find the cream of local reporting talent, lifting the flotsam and watching the beetles scuttle into the sand where they belong.  The Leither dot net is  fearless.   The Leither dot net is  independent.   The Leither dot net  takes no money  from advertisers, so can expose shoddy goods and services without fear or favour.  What other local publication can say  that,  eh?  And of course, we want to hear from YOU. Not by letter. Not by email. But instantly, here in the comment box. (Once the comment feature is activated.)  More Questions and Answers tomorrow. But for now, it's good night Leithers, everywhere.

      You've definitely read a pub or restaurant review in your time. Probably well upwards of a dozen. They are the very stuff of local press, and utterly, totally, incorrigibly corrupt.  One leading Edinburgh hackette is reputed to be so large now she can barely fit through standard doorways, so many freebie  plats du jour  have slipped down her throat.    The writing is bland, bland, bland. "For starter I plumped for black pudding on tattie scone, while Himself chose the smoked wild salmon." Even as you read it, you know you never ever want to go there, in case there's the slightest chance you end up seated near her and Himself. (The more advanced foodie can weave a little drama into it, often with bits of direct speech, eg. "Darling, don't they look  just  like the Beckhams!" I hissed at him, my three-meat bruschetta poised halfway to my lips.) Or - more typically... "While the handsome, dusky waiter was clearing the first course, my companion launched into a blow by blow account of the secretary she was convinced her husband was banging." (You see - a soap  and  a snack!) But, as I say, not all can rise to these giddy heights. ( Hint:  I always can - if anyone's got a newspaper and a contract...)    However, this one, about the  urlLink Port o Leith Bar , from last week's Sunday Herald, is in a class of its own. Eschewing all such lit-crit tricks, it screams  DRINK HERE  at you, right off the page.  Reproduced without permission...  EDINBURGH FESTIVAL SPECIAL - SOCIALISING: PORT O' LEITH  Hell-red cartoon booze-room, pumped full of character to the point of implosion, the atmosphere pitched fluidly between dream and nightmare. A teeming cross-section of Leith-flavoured humanity piles in here through the days and nights of the week - men's men, pretty girls, families with kiddies, old loners, amateur local historians, trouble-seekers, uglies, jokers, liars and charmers - to drink cheap, excellent beers, noise up the cranky landlady, dance around the eclectic jukebox and shout aggressively friendly banter into each others faces.  Sunday Herald, 25.07.04  And  that  is where almost all of us met. Without the Port there  would be  no Leither Dot Net.

      As my colleague, compadre and Fellow Hibbie Chav Gav will readily agree, supporting Hibs and Scotland is more of an affliction, than a strangely inordinate fondness. However, it is vastly preferable to having anything to do with the English FA, who seem to have got themselves into some strange positions regarding their executive staff. (Sic)   I thank the Lord for our dear old Manager, Broon, as when  he  got himself a bit dollybuurd, he treated her with some respect, therefore gaining Credibility with not only the Scottish FA, but the Players, the Fans and the General Public alike.   How refreshing it is to look down upon our Southern Cousins, with not only our usual Disdain, but certain Moralistic Smugness as well!    However, to return to the subject in hand. I am incredulous to note, that the General Furore is over which Bossman should resign, (or both) whilst totally ignoring the crutch of the matter, i.e. a little Middle-Class-Vaguely-Black-Buurd, who, depending on your Personal Morality, could be described as "A Wee Slag", or (PC Prats), a "Heroine of her Gender Coz she Shagged them Baith."   Pally-os has resigned, Sven talks like The Svedish Chef in "The Muppets", (says it all) and the English Team is Shite.   Gie the Buurd the job!   The team'll all be knocking lumps oot each other for the pleasure of her favours, the Fans will hope she'll lead them onto the park, (topless?) and we'll get the best laugh ever!  Tits oot fur the boys'n' c'moan Scotland!

      The absolute "must-see" event of this year's festival is  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest  playing most of August in the Assembly Rooms.   Por qua?  Because  urlLink Christian Slater's  in it. Yes, that drug-addled, ex-con icon of the nineties is treading the boards here in Auld Reekie.  I wasted no time in telling Mary of the  urlLink Port o Leith Bar  about this. "He'll be here in yer pub soon, Mary!" I gushed at her over my Guinness. "Christian Slater. Bound tae be. Ah mean  look  at the gadgie... druggie, jailbird... where else would he drink?"  "I really don't know him," Mary confessed.   "Put a sign outside the bar!" I suggested. PORT O LEITH WELCOMES CHRISTIAN SLATER! "It'll have them queueing down Constitution Street!" Her eyes lit up at that of course, so she gave me a bit paper and pen. When I'd written it she showed it to Lindsay the barmaid.   PS:  Naturally any and all Slater-sightings will be reported here, on-screen, first. Avoid periodical paper imitations.

      It's a very great joy to receive letters from happy readers. (We should check out how to get letters sent direct to The Leither Dot Net, btw.)  But this offering yesterday from overnight commenter  Bluff Auld Traditionalist  was less than gushing in its praise. "This is not your site this is supposed to be a site for the people of Leith or people who are interested in Leith." And... "Resign and give someone with a bit of imagination a chance." See how I suffer for your art?  Is Bluff Auld Traditionalist (usually capitalised) correct in his demands? Have I trampled all over the contributors, wrecking their work by squeezing the "Leithness" out of it? Should I hand over the reins perhaps to the Queen of Leith herself, Dame Mary of Moriarty?  I've relaxed Bluff Auld Traditionalist's recent comment ban so that he can develop his points. Over to youse. I've heard the Guardian are interested.

      Anybody wandering or stumbling along the Shore cannot miss The Floaty Boat. She's battleship grey and looking a bit down on her luck.  What to do with it?  A brief history: Originally a steam yacht owned by the Guinness family (no, really) she was used during the war (second, I think) as a minesweeper round the coast of Blighty. Then she was laid up on the canal linking Loch Ness with the west coast for a long time before arriving in Sunny Leith  under her own power  in 1986. Since then a restaurant business has seen many incarnations, some good, some awful. Laterally, under the guidance of the Fat Controller, there was some considerable success as a party venue, as there is a lot of space inside. During the Tall Ships visit, two youthful pissheads jumped off the Boat to cool off - or somesuch - and of course all on board (and there were several hundred) rushed to the rail to enjoy the spectacle, throw beercans and stuff. This caused the Boat to shift on it's bed of Vauxhall Vivas, shopping trolleys and empties to the point that water arrived through the open porthole (OK, broken porthole) in the Gents, no doubt spoiling one of those perfect moments one has in the Gents for anybody there at the time. A shout from deck - "God Save The Queens!" Not sure who that refered to.  So, the Boat is indeed afloat, if only just. However, large pumps are constantly pumping the Water of Leith back into itself.  From a quite pleasing black hull, white superstructure, a repaint gave us violent canary yellow. This displeased the local residents, some of whom were on tranquillisers after looking out the window each morning. The fat Controller, possessed of a wry sense of humour, painted it again - battleship grey. (£1.89 a tiny tin from good model shops)  Closed for a few years now, something must be done. Problem: The hull is in very poor condition. Solutions: Fill it with concrete, or repair the hull. Aggro: Repairing the hull requires drydock - not possible (bridge in the way) - or lift the Boat out of the water - not possible as it weighs 400 tons. Aggro 2: Filling it with concrete would require setting the boat on the bottom permanently. This would then attract the council, looking for rates. Yes, at the moment the Boat does not pay rates or harbour dues (the bridge again, which was constructed after the Boat arrived - very inconvenient.)  Little known fact: There is a perfect triple expansion steam engine, Scotch boiler and all the gubbins still installed below decks.  Any ideas?
