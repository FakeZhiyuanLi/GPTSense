      A flashback to my early, formative years in Cherry Hill, NJ... my new step-mother, a Jewish new-age yenta, felt that a sure-fire cure for my and my brothers' hyperactivity was to take EST training in the early 70's.  We had to contemplate our belly buttons, then practice saying empowering statements to each other:  "You will NOT use that toothbrush on that DOG ever again!"  G-d knows how this might empower me as a 10-year-old.  Or why this is even relevant now.  I still have nightmares about dogs foaming at the muzzle (albeit with minty-fresh breath).

      THE WORLD ACCORDING TO BLONDES  Flight #642, Chicago to Fort Lauderdale  WendyCity:  "Excuse me... did the pilot just announce that it was okay to get up?  I really have to pee!"  Amy the Flight Attendant:  "Ummm, I'm not sure... I never listen to those announcements (giggle!)"  WendyCity:  "Well, perhaps now would be a good time to start."

      MY NEW BOYFRIEND  "A green hunting cap squeezed the top of the fleshy balloon of a head. The green earflaps, full of large ears and uncut hair and the fine bristles that grew in the ears themselves, stuck out on either side like turn signals indicating two directions at once. Full, pursed lips protruded beneath the bushy black moustache and, at their corners, sank into little folds filled with disapproval and potato chip crumbs."   - A Confederacy of Dunces

       "SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE" SKETCH W/CHRISTOPER WALKEN   (A reasonable facsimile of the script - yes, I appreciate scatalogical humor!)  [SCENE:  Gentile ladies of the Confederate Era sitting on the stoop of their plantation mansion, a mother, daughter and father, awaiting the arrival of a colonel, just returned from battle.]   Mother:  Could it really be?  Could it really be Colonel Angus?   Father:  Colonel Angus is an acquired taste.   Daughter:  I don't know anything about Colonel Angus!   Mother:  If I remember correctly, Colonel Angus can be messy.   [Colonel arrives.]   Father:  Colonel Angus, you old carpet bagger!  We're always happy to see your shining face.  What brings you to these parts?   Colonel:  I'm heading down south.  I prefer the deep south - I prefer the humidity.  Who it this little rose bud?   Mother:  This is our daughter.   Colonel:  Well, Colonel Angus might be rough, Colonel Angus might not smell like a bed of roses but deep down... if overstay my welcome, just tap me on the head.   Mother:  I always dreamed of the day that Colonel Angus would rest his head at Shady Thicket!   Father:  Colonel Angus, I hear rumors about the incident at Big Beaver.   Colonel:  They're true, I'm afraid.  Ten men were lost and I suffered a great injury to my jaw.  There'll be no more Colonel Angus.  Call me by my real name, Anal Angus.   Mother:  Oh, I'll so miss Colonel Angus but I'm willing to give him a try.  We'll call you when it's time to eat, Anal.   Daughter:  Well, I think Colonel Angus is delightful.   Father:  Well, you won't after five minutes.   Mother:  Yes, you can only take so much Colonel Angus.  (* Please direct your comments about this BLOG to:  lax2ord1995@yahoo.com)

      ALL IN A DAY'S WORK?  You can't believe what's happening here in Chicago.  Dumbasses protesting on Lake Shore Drive (there goes the neighborhood!).  I'm certain that only 25% of the "protesters" are actually protesting.  The rest of the mob are lookie-loos, getting in the way of the police (and their billy clubs and requisite tear gas).  I happened upon a male officer and his female partner, stationed outside of the office tower I was visiting today for an interview.  They both wore matching bulletproof flak vests and held pretty, powder blue helmets in their hands.  They told me about last night's unexpected protest and how they were understaffed.  WendyCity:  "So... looking for action??"  Cute Chicago Cop:  "I wish these people would get a job!"  WendyCity:  "But then you wouldn't have anything to do."  CCC:  "Believe me, there's plenty of paperwork waiting for us back at the station."  Lady Cop:  (nods silently in agreement, rolling eyes).

      A ONE-DIVA TOWN  In the subway station, on my way to a second job interview this afternoon, I attempted unsuccessfully to load $4 onto my CTA fare card.  I threw my hands up in annoyance and went up to the transit employee in her barred cage.  Oversized Surly Mama:  “We’re not gonna be havin’ a ‘discussion’, are we?”  WendyCity:  “Who, me?”  OSM:  “Hmmfff!  Just makin’ sure.”  WendyCity:  “Yes.  Well.  Have a nice day!”  OSM:  n/a  I guess my body language must have communicated some sort of attitude that put her on the defensive.  Could it have been my business suited-up, M.A.C. lipgloss-wearing, Jappy Whiteness?  Was she threatened by my fabulousness, worried that there are now TWO divas living in the City of Chicago?

      NOCHE DE FLAMENCO  Had an interesting evening... went with a friend to see a dance troupe from Spain perform various Flamenco dances.  There was a 5-piece Flamenco guitar group accompanying them, and a vocalist.  My friend, David Torres, translated the lyrics for me.  Wonderful dancers, great energy, lots of foot-stamping and clapping, beautiful, bright dresses.  ... and, of course, those dark, swarthy male Spaniards with the tight pants.  (Ole!!)  I feel so cultured!!  (p.s. - I think my space bar's working again.  Whoo hooooo!!!!!)

      SHOULD IT STAY OR SHOULD IT GO?  This is just a test. Steve (aka Mr. HelpDesk) told me to press down on my spacebar very hard and “jiggle” it like a toilet handle and I should be able tofix this problem.  It’s sort of working, but not really.  Perhaps I should still send this back toDell for replacement.       There'sa war on in Iraq but I'm fighting my own personal battle.  (Oh, sure... NOW it's working!)

      WAR... WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR??  Just now, the news cut in with news about the war.  Explosions are occurring in Bagdhad and ironically, it just began lightening and thundering here in Chicago.  Some so-called diplomatic rhetoric being used on CNN:  "the opening stages of the disarmament of Iraq" "...striking a target of opportunity" "this was a 'leadership' target" "this is a decapitation strike" (not very diplomatic, is it?) "...troops crossing the line of departure, awaiting the order to slip the leashes" "...not out to kill or maim any Iraqis"  No matter how they phrase it, it's WAR, baybee.  We're Rockin' the Casbah!!  (Now, back to Christian Amanpour, the War Babe journalist.)

      STOP!!!  If I turn on the news one more time, and hear one more story about one more little league coach assaulting one more 12 year old, I swear, I'll stop watching the news altogether.  Almost every week on our local news, without fail, there's some sad story about children being abducted, assaulted or abandoned.  What the hell????!!!!!!!!   The war is here, at home.

      SHIRLEY YOU MUST BE JOKING!  On an application for an employment agency, the first four questions nearly had me pee in my pants when I read them:  1.  Age  2.  Date of Birth 3.  Married/Single/Separated 4  Children (Y/N)  I told the recruiter that to the best of my knowledge, these questions were illegal to ask.    Recruiter: "Actually, we're allowed to ask them." WendyCity:  "Really?  When did that law change?" Recruiter:  "Oh, a few years ago." 60-year-old female applicant sitting next to me:  "Oh, BULLSHIT!!"  Do I really want to work with this agency?

      TO:  JDATE.COM PROSPECTS RE:  MY PERFECT MATCH  I'd love to meet: someone flexible, adventurous, athletic, inquisitive, and able to get my weird sense of humor (but not necessarily in that order)!    The type of person I definitely *wouldn't* like to meet: If you immediately begin making cheesy sexual innuendos even before ever meeting me (thinking you're being cute), don't expect to speak with me again.  I don't need to know that you "get horny late at night, LOL!", and no I *wouldn't* like you to offer to buy me "a belly-baring babydoll tee from the Tom Petty concert, LOL!" (Yes, I actually DID receive these comments from a couple of you Jdate fellas).  I'm open-minded and fairly liberal but still a lady.  Please be a gentleman!!

      YOU'RE MY FAVORITE MISTAKE  So anyway, last night after watching Saturday Night Live, I decided to sign back up on Jdate to see what I've been missing.   Apparently, not much.   Jdate, for those goyim out there who might not know, is an internet dating site for Jewish singles. The service has a new Instant Messenger feature that is very intrusive - these windows pop up, sometimes two or 4 at a time with messages from men. (More than 4 means that you are very, very desireable and will soon meet your future mate).   With the brilliance that only comes after drinking 4 glasses of cheap merlot, I decided to converse with the first man who IM'd me. Fine. What else did I have going on at 2 a.m. besides joining in on St. Patrick's Day revelry at a local dive with incoherent undergraduates on Spring Break? My new Jdate friend seemed relatively normal and harmless until he (out of the blue and with no instigation from moi) stated that he gets "really horny this time of night". I gave him the benefit of the doubt, once, and asked him to please not go there. He apologized, the chat continued and he wrote that shit again and added, "I'm sorry, I'm just being honest, ha ha!"   CLICK! Adios, douchebag (douchebag is my new favorite noun, by the way). Henceforth, I shall refer to him as D.B.   D.B.'s IM window kept popping up and I kept closing it. "Where are you? Call me, call me, call me!!!!!" Frankly, it was getting a bit scary to know that D.B.  was sitting at a computer in fucking *DesPlaines, Illinois* at 2am, stalking me.   I checked my email this morning and received the following query (and an absolutely lovely photograph taken on a webcam).   "Hey,that was rude to ditch me like that... My cell # is ********* and if u want to call me and explain why u ditched me; that's cool."   D.B., you're quite a catch!! I love men who type "u" instead of "you" - it's so cute! Obviously, I've have made a huge mistake - of COURSE I'll have Instant Messenger sex with you. Please write back soon... on second thought, "soon" is much too long to wait. I need to hear your voice. Please phone me. Here are my numbers at work, home, my cell, even my girlfriend Leslie's work, home and cell numbers. Although she lives in Fairbanks, Alaska, she can get in touch with me if you are unable to.   Missing you,  Wendy (a.k.a., BrunettesRMoreFun)

       HOLY CRAP!   Usually I make it a point not to engage in discussions about politics (or religion), particularly since so many people out there are posting their opinions to their blogs about Iraq.  However...  however!   When I read this in the "Chicago Tribune", I felt compelled to comment on both politics AND religion:   1) Politics:   We are dealing with madmen.  (Yes, I know... how observant of me.)    Iraqi Suicide Bomber Kills 4 U.S. Troops  By DAVID CRARY Associated Press Writer Published March 29, 2003, 11:17 AM CST    A suicide bomber identified as an Iraqi army officer killed four American soldiers Saturday, and Iraq threatened more such attacks. Coalition forces pounded Republican Guard positions in preparation for an all-out push toward Baghdad.   "This is just the beginning," said Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan, after the suicide bombing at a checkpoint in south-central Iraq. He said such attacks would become "routine military policy."   "We will use any means to kill our enemy in our land and we will follow the enemy into its land," Ramadan said.    2) Religion:   That last sentence scares the bejesus out of me.  I also find it ironic that the Iraqi Vice President's last name is  urlLink Ramadan , described as  "a time of worship and contemplation. A time to strengthen family and community ties."     Holy Crap!   LinktoComments(' ')    urlLink  ">Comment

       NEIGHBORHOODS WITHIN NEIGHBORHOODS          I was at an interview this afternoon and while waiting in the reception area, began reading the following book which was on the coffee table:   urlLink "Neighborhoods Within Neighborhoods" , published by the Rogers Park/West Ridge Historical Society.  I found it fascinating, having lived in that area from 1995-1998.  Having lived in Chicago since 1995, my outsider’s view is it’s the most segregated city I’ve ever experienced.  Roger’s Park, however, is an eclectic mix of races, political stances and tolerance – more so than almost any town in the United States.  During my “tenure” there, I met a jazz guitarist signed to Blue Note Records, a recovering alcoholic thrilled with his new life as a highly-trained pipefitter, another recovering alcoholic who worked as a bartender (of all things!), an aspiring Alderman, a female folk singer, a lesbian couple, a café owner once arrested during the 1968 Chicago Democratic Convention riots, a publicist for Alligator Records (an esteemed Chicago Blues label), as well as artists, Dead Heads, and students from Loyola University.  (Even  Shecky Green  grew up here!)  I didn’t realized how diverse the area was until I moved away.            One of the annual highlights I enjoyed is Rogers Park's “Artists of the Wall” competition; wall-painting on a lakefront retaining wall.           It seems that Rogers Park was once a staid, conservative "Leave It To Beaver" community which has gentrified into a counter-cultural community.  I guess I'd always sensed that but the pictures in this book were amazing... charting the progression from 1940's life (high school kids at the prom, WWII drives) into photos of recent activism in the community.  Upon my departure from Rogers Park to the Gold Coast, I'd experienced first hand the changes that Section 8 housing had on my block and was ready to leave.  I now feel somewhat remorseful for not paying more attention to the uniqueness of the diversified population that surrounded me while I lived there.   To be honest, living in the Gold Coast, while it's convenient and offers me many amenities, lacks the cultural  urlLink diversity  that I enjoyed in Rogers Park.  It's so sterile here that I almost want to puke sometimes!  The only real "flava" here is Mary Charming Crazy Woman who is usually found sprawled on the sidewalk outside the Walgreen's, shouting "C*NT!" to each woman who passes by, and the entertainment afforded by the "Streetwise" newspaper vendor stationed outside of each establishment in the area.

       DO YOU DARE PAY THE FARE?          I was waiting for the bus to arrive and take me to my second job interview at The Unsuspecting Company  (unsuspecting of the fact that I plan to pimp them as Stage 1 of my Master Plan - to be outlined in a future post) .     20 minutes and the #22 still hadn’t arrived.  A cab happened along and the driver tooted his horn, inquiring if I needed a lift.  He rolled down the passenger-side window and I stepped off the curb and approached him.  The driver was a 30-something year-old man of Nigerian decent, with a diamond earring in his lobe.  WendyCity:   I’m going to the corner of Clark and Wacker but I only have $7.  Will that be enough?   Cabbie:  (Gestures for me to hop in).   What’s that address again?   WendyCity:   Corner of Clark and Wacker.  I’m late for a job interview.   Cabbie:   Okay, I’ll take you there and then I’ll marry you.   WendyCity:   Well, that sounds tempting… but don’t you want to wait and see if I actually get the job so I can support you?  Wouldn’t you like to be a kept man?  Meet me on the corner at 2:00pm and we’ll discuss it.   Cabbie:   A-hahahahaha!!!  I run too fast for you to catch me!

       HAPPY FUN BALL!          Anyone out there who knows me well, well knows that I am a big fan of "Saturday Night Live".  Not the current cast, which has its moments but some of the classic episodes.  Here's a transcript of one of my favorite "fake" commercials (I wish I'd written this!):   Happy Fun Ball              [ open on three kids playing with their Happy Fun Ball ]               Kid 1: It's happy!              Kid 2: It's fun!              All Three Kids: It's Happy Fun Ball!               Announcer: Yes, it's Happy Fun Ball! The toy sensation that's sweeping the nation! Only $14.95 at participating stores! Get one              today!               Warning: Pregnant women, the elderly, and children under 10 should avoid prolonged exposure to Happy Fun Ball.

       IT'S NOT EASY BEING GREEN   I knew it!!  I  am  too pretty!  I didn't get that job at Conservative Company, Inc. because I am attractive, intelligent and have what's described as a "strong personality".  Well, I just happen to know a recruiter who is friendly with the woman who interviewed me.  It's not that I didn't type fast enough on the computer test, it's that there is another secretary at this firm who also has a strong personality and fancies herself the Queen Bee.    (And yes, she also happens to also be a blonde.)  In fact, the Queen and her Drones were so ruthless that the previous assistant quit after enduring their psychological warfare for almost two years.  I think the rejection is a blessing in disguise.  I already went through that kind of crap in my last job.  If I was faced with it again in a new position, I'd take no prisoners.  I absolutely  abhor  working with women.  It's not easy being me.  It's not easy being green.  Guess I'll have to kiss a lot of frogs 'til I find the right gig!     S.W.A.K.!

       PRETTY IS AS PRETTY DOES   From: gladys.s@ConservativeCompany.com Sent: Monday, March 24, 2003 5:31 PM Subject: EA Position   Hi Wendy - I wanted to let you know that we filled the position of Executive Assistant this afternoon.  This was a very difficult decision for us to make, as all of the candidates presented were outstanding.  Our choice of candidates was based on the advanced skills shown with tables in Word.  Thank you again for your time and good luck in your search.  We will keep your resume in the active files for a period of six months.  - Gladys  So I didn't get that job I interviewed three times for.  I know it's not because I took longer than 10 minutes to create a table in Word (I'm a frickin’ PRODUCTION SPECIALIST, by the way; the test was on Windows XP which I'm still learning how to navigate... and still, they asked me back!)  I'm sure it's because I'm  too pretty  and the other (blonde) secretaries would be jealous.  I'm sure it's because I'm a  brunette .  My friend L has the same problem.  She's a marine biologist and the only life forms that she gets along with have fins.   Wow.  That reads well.  I think I'll post it on my BLOG.  From: L Sent: Monday, March 24, 2003 6:18 PM   Don't worry!! You WILL get another job.   Unfortunately, yes, it's possible that you are too pretty. Sucks to be us, doesn't it? You think you've got it bad? Try being taken seriously as a SCIENTIST when you're pretty - if you don't wear Birkenstocks and grow your pit hair, or if God forbid you dress like a woman and wear makeup, they think you must not be smart enough...

       FROM "USA TODAY", TODAY    Web logs convey 'raw stuff' of war   He calls himself Salam Pax and says he's a 29-year-old architect living in Baghdad. Nobody seems to know his true name, and some  wonder whether he's a real person. But thousands have been reading his Web log on the Internet since war approached.                      ''Last night was very quiet in Baghdad,'' he wrote on Friday as bombers approached. ''The streets are empty, only bakeries are open             and some grocery shops charging 4 times the normal prices.''  And later: ''On BBC we are watching scenes of Iraqis surrendering.               My youngest cousin was muttering 'what shame' to himself. Yes, it is better for them to do that, but still, seeing them carrying that             white flag makes something deep inside you cringe.''  Readers keep coming back to Pax because, after following his journal (dear_raed.blogspot.com), they have come to care about him.  Pax is among the vast numbers of self-styled chroniclers who keep Web logs -- known on the Net as ''blogs.'' A blog can be written by one person or many, but the common denominator is their diary style, and the fact that when they're updated (sometimes several times a day) the newest entries appear at the top. This gives blogs a feeling of being both personal and immediate.  It is impossible to say precisely how many active blogs are on the Net, but it's probably hundreds of thousands, says Michael             Gartenberg, research director with Jupiter Research in New York.  Born in the geeky corners of the Internet in the late '90s, blogs             are coming of age, becoming an integral part of the Internet landscape. That is especially true now, during wartime.  ''Reporters have an unparalleled ability to gather information,'' but blogs have the ability to convey unedited, raw personal drama as the war unfolds, says Diane, a New York blogger (gotham.realwomenonline.com) who has developed an e-mail friendship with Pax and is convinced he's real. (Like many bloggers, she does not use her full name.)  ''Nothing really beats this raw stuff of life: What does bread cost? Where did you go to get it?'' says Diane, who supports the war but             is worried about her friend.  ''When the whole (war) thing started, it was like fireworks far away,'' she says. But Pax's blog has changed her perspective. ''It's strange to be in favor of a bombing campaign that could kill this guy.''  Personal stories are only part of the ''blogosphere,'' as some call the universe of Web logs.  Sites such as Warblogs:cc (www.warblogs.cc) compile headlines from mainstream news sources and blogs, pointing people to stories from sources as diverse as CNN and The New York Times to Turkish newspaper Hurriyet and KurdishMedia.com.  Warblogging.com, which posts links to news stories and commentaries, reports that it was getting 3,000 to 6,000 visitors a day before the war. But when war began, it says, the site was registering tens of             thousands of visitors from all over the world, including the U.S. House of Representatives, the Department of Defense (news - web             sites), the British House of Commons and the government of Syria.  Web logger Anna Brosovic, a computer system administrator and part-time college student in Arlington, Texas, instinctively turned             to blogs when the hostilities broke out.  ''I have a lot less trust in the major media outlets in this country than I do foreign media outlets or bloggers,'' says Brosovic, 29, who writes a blog called Annatopia.  Others are turning to blogs kept by war correspondents, such as CNN correspondent Kevin Sites and several BBC reporters.  War correspondent blogs add ''a new wrinkle,'' says Rebecca Blood, a             blogger who, along with keeping her own Web log, also is author of The Weblog Handbook: Practical Advice on Creating and Maintaining Your Blog, which discusses the history and cultural appeal of blogs and offers how-to advice.                     The relationship between bloggers and journalists has become symbiotic -- especially as blogs have gone from fringe to mainstream             in the past year or so.  ''The news media is picking up on what the Web loggers are saying and vice versa,'' says Paul Grabowicz, a ournalism instructor at the University of California-Berkeley who taught a blogging course in the fall. ''It's giving people a way to, in effect, publish their own news.''  That's the reason blogging has become so popular, Blood says: ''Everybody has a story to tell. We did it around campfires way back when. We do it around water coolers. What these tools allow people to do is to put onto the Web their own story about whatever their passion is.''  Or their fear.  The last posting from Pax came early Friday morning: ''2 more hours until the B52s get to Iraq (news - web sites).''              Since then, nothing.  Says Diane: ''I pray, I really pray, that he's alive.''  [*Please send comments to: lax2ord1995@yahoo.com]

       PRETTY IN PINK, TOO!   (From Jodi's blog at http://www.jodiverse.com/):   "I'm inside, and wearing a pink Old Navy T-shirt. (I'm wearings pants, too, you perverts.) I think it's called a "little girl" T-shirt. I'm not sure. (Ordinarily I actually buy the real girls' clothing, because it's even less expensive [notice I didn't say "cheaper" and thus imply that Old Navy is a schlock shop!] and they accommodate my desire for a shorter T-shirt length by which I can display my stunningly concave stomach and shorter sleeves by which I can show off my fabulously sculpted arms.) What I am sure about is that it's just too funny to see me in pink."    My response:  Ohmigod, guess what I'm wearing right now?   Pink drawstring, cotton pajama bottoms (and matching tank top) from Old Navy!  My sculpted arms with the baby biceps have never looked better and my firm abs are beautifully displayed as the tank top is not tucked into the bottoms.  Too bad there's no one here to admire my warm form.

       A HUGE HONOR FOR A LOST FRIEND   Tonight, the Academy Award for best cinematography was awarded to a man named Conrad C. Hall.   "Connie" lived upstairs from me in my building in West Hollywood, prior to my move to Chicago.  I only knew him as the nice, older, distinguished-looking gentleman with white hair and a neatly-trimmed beard   http://us.imdb.com/EGallery?source=ss&group=0257044&photo=Ss/0257044/CN-173-15A.jpg&path=pgallery&path_key=Hall,%20Conrad%20L.   who chatted with me about our mutual love of photography.  He invited me up to his apartment once and revealed to me that he was a cinematographer, and showed me his editing equipment.  I learned then that he'd won the Academy Award for Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid in 1969.  (He worked for years at his craft... he also won for "American Beauty", which I didn't realize.  That scene with the girl and all the roses?  That was Connie's touch.  Amazing!)   I wasn't aware that he'd died several months ago until they announced that he'd won this year's award for The Road to Perdition.  I cheered when his name was announced, then was suddenly silenced, with goosebumps, when his son took the stage to emotionally accept the award in Connie's honor.     In Hollywood, 90% of the people I met are "in the industry", in one form or another.  I'm humbled to have known such a lovely man, who truly loved his craft and was eager to share his avocation with a young woman, enthusiastic to learn about other people's interests.   I'm sorry that Connie did not live to accept his honor in person.   [Please send comments to: lax2ord1995@yahoo.com]

       CORRECTION    urlLink Jodi  and  urlLink Leo  have informed me that my use of the adjective "scatalogic" in my previous post was wrong in context.  As I revisited Dictionary.com, I realized that it dealt more with the facination with excrement than dirty thoughts.

So, I looked it up in a thesarus and found that  synonyms  for the word  urlLink scatology  were more in line with what I was shooting for (in the context of my bikini picture).  I consider myself a master wordsmith  (thanks to the guidance of Miss Wilson, Grade 2, Joyce Kilmer Elementary in Cherry Hill, NJ)  but I may have overstepped the boundaries of my knowledge of my own mother tongue.

       PATHETIC AND SAD, BUT SOCIAL.   I often wonder if I’m just a glutton for punishment… after a handful of bad experiences on JDATE (a Jewish singles internet dating site), I terminated my subscription with the site one year ago and only recently re-subscribed, hoping that some new, classy gentlemen had signed up since then.  I was mistaken.

       PAPER OR PLASTIC?   Ordering a sandwich at Subway today…  Wendy:   Hi, I’d like a 6-inch roasted chicken sub with lettuce, tomatoes and peppers.   Counter Guy:  Do you want cheese?   Wendy:   No thanks.   Counter Guy begins squeezing mayonnaise on the bread.  Wendy:   Uh, no mayo.  I just want mustard… and lettuce, tomatoes and peppers.   Counter Guy:   Okay.  (Begins putting a slice of cheese on the sub)  Wendy:   No, I don’t want cheese!   Counter Guy:   You want pepper?   (Begins sprinkling black pepper on my sub)  Wendy:   No, not  that  kind of pepper… GREEN peppers.   Finally, my sub is completed to my exacting specifications.  Cashier:   You want the combo?   Wendy:   No, just the sub, thanks.   Cashier:   No chips?  Well, what about a Coke?    LinktoComments(' ')    urlLink  ">Comment

       EVERY DAY IS A WINDING ROAD!   To elaborate on my previous post…  So anyway, on Saturday afternoon, I went out to buy a new microwave oven and met the following individuals:  * At Best Buy - Two Mexican women named Regina and Lourdes.  Actually, this wasn’t that interesting.  I practiced my Spanish on both of them.  Regina was the woman who helped me pick out the microwave, Lourdes, my checkout girl.  I didn’t know the Spanish word for “microwave” but they understood me just the same.  Imagine that.  * At The Container Store (where I stopped by to pick up two laundry baskets, four plastic shoeboxes for storing my mountains of cheap makeup and a shower curtain) – a post-op trannsexual named Rebecca.    Wendy:   I’d like to pay for these, please.   Rebecca:  No problem.  By the way, I love your jeans!   (Gestures at my low-rise,  denim Joie cargo pants).    Wendy: (Notices that Rebecca is wearing the same pants in a larger size.)   	 Wendy:   Thanks!  I got them at Barney’s.   I began a conversation with Rebecca that was unrelated to our mutual jeans or my purchases.  As it happens, she (he) is an electrical engineer with 20 years of experience AND has an MBA.  No one will hire her, she/he told me, so she resorted to a retail job.  I was fascinated by this person.  To describe her here does not do her appearance justice.  She was over 6” tall, with a shock of blonde hair that looked like a wig masquerading as a bird’s nest, with the aforementioned low-rise jeans, and chipped and torn nails badly in need of a manicure.  Rebecca:  (Looking me up and down in an odd way).   My goodness, you really have a great look!      Wendy:  (Feeling strangely embarrassed)   Ha ha!  Thank you!   * Cab ride home – A Pakistani cab driver who married his first cousin.  (I always engage my cab drivers in conversation, when I can.  Most of the time, they are more educated and interesting than I am!)  This particular driver, I found out during my 10-minute ride home, was born in 1958 and came to the U.S. in 1981.  His marriage, to his first cousin (he was 23, she, 18), was arranged by their parents.  They are still very happily married and boast 5 children ranging in age from 20 down to 2 ½.  I found this very interesting and wonder if the “winners” on the t.v. show  urlLink Married By America  might still stand a chance for happiness.

       HUMOR IN THE NEWS         I’m posting a plug for my good friend Chris Pina’s website,  urlLink Humor In The News .  I’ve known Chris for 10 years since I first knocked on the door of an annoying neighbor who always played “Crocodile Rock” promptly each evening at 6pm.  Eventually, we even became roommates for a short while (but that’s another story).          Besides being the creator and writer of “Humor In The News, Chris is an accomplished actor who has starred on stage and has been credited as a featured performer in many television shows such as Beverly Hills, 90210, Hill Street Blues, General Hospital and many others.  He also works as a professional voice-over performer for motion pictures, commercials and audio tape productions.   Chris has also written sketches for television, and has provided material for such stand-up comedians as Sam Kinison, Dennis Miller, Richard Belzer, Rich Jeni and many more.  Chris regularly performs improv comedy at the World Famous "Improv" and "Comedy Store" in Hollywood.  His website is designed and maintained by his girlfriend, Lisa Coburn, who is the daughter of legendary film actor, James Coburn (who won 1998’s Best Supporting Actor Oscar for “Affliction”).  Lisa is also an accomplished jazz singer who has also sung on film soundtracks and commercials.          As a web designer, Lisa creates site for many clients including  urlLink Gene Simmons  of “Kiss”.   urlLink   www.GeneSimmons.com       I just wanted to give both of them a plug – I’m sure they’d appreciate your visiting their sites!

       TONIGHT'S DOUBLE-FEATURE   I just rented two DVDs tonight:     "Hollywood Ending", with Woody Allen.  About a "struggling director who gets a chance to revive his career by directing a new movie but when it comes time to say 'action', he finds he's lost his sight!"   (How can I resist this premise?)    "Girl, Interrupted", with Winona Ryder and Angelina Joie.  About a girl put into a mental institution after trying to commit suicide (only the box cover says, "put into a mental institution AFTER she commits suicide".  For that obvious mistake, I had to rent it!   I asked my blog readers to suggest some DVDs to rent and everyone's recommendation were movies I'd already seen, so I hope I enjoy these.  Since I'm still feeling bummed out (even after a 30-minute run and some ab work), I've decided to watch "Girl, Interrupted".  To cheer me up, see?  (I've got a big box of  urlLink Whoppers®  malted milk balls, too!  With  "30% less fat" !)      LinktoComments(' ')    urlLink  ">Comment

       THE WAR ON SELF-CENTEREDNESS     Confidential to you, the 20-something female sitting in the first handicapped seat on the #151 LaSalle Street bus this morning.  You, in your red woolen coat, Burberry cloche hat with matching scarf and Kate Spade purse, and the huge, blue and white button on your lapel which screamed, "No War!"  Were you even aware of the woman in her 80's who was standing in front of you, one hand on the railing above your head, the other on the back of the driver's seat in an attempt to steady herself as the bus accelerated and braked?  Your button identified you as pacifist, a do-gooder, a person who cares about humanity.  I watched you talk on your cell phone, read your "People" magazine, all the while listening to your shiny, new mp3 player (loaded up, no doubt, with tracks by Celine Dion).  When another senior boarded the bus, I noticed a flicker of acknowledgement in your overly-mascaraed eyes but you pretended to ignore him.  I hate your "No War" button. You button-wearing, matching Burberry-Kate Spade enthusiasts make me sick.  You're such a hypocrite!!   LinktoComments(' ')    urlLink  ">Comment

       GO AHEAD, MAKE MY DAY!   Okay, the weekend is finally upon us.  I began my new job at The Unsuspecting Company this week and what can I tell ya... the women there appear to be as catty as (most) women everywhere are.  Within two hours of employment, I learned who I shouldn't trust lest she stab me in the back, who is having bariatric surgery for obesity, who the most unhelpful female on the team is, who is being treated for sexual dysfunction, who has two children fathered out of wedlock.  My G-d!  My life seems dull in comparison to the colorful group I've found myself amongst!  I learned my lesson, though.  I'm staying out of their way and am just going to focus on my job.  The Master Plan includes a healthy paycheck.    Ironically, my first day on Monday was ominous and foreboding.  First, I got my "monthly letter"  (as the old time, fancy, Victorian ladies used to delicately put it) .  Then, I exited my building only to discover that 4" of snow had fallen and it was now raining down upon a cesspool of slush.  I arrived at my new place of business and immediately developed a burning knot in my right shoulder that's still with me as I type this.  Then, an old friend let me down and revealed their true colors, at a time when I needed this old friend's support the most (for various, sundry, and important reasons.)  So!      The Wendy City (or "Fun Wendy" as H. once called me) is offically depressed.  Thankfully, the weekend is almost here.  My strategy for getting back to my old self requires going out for a slow, 6-mile run, making a pizza, pouring myself a trough of cheap wine and renting one or two really great DVDs with which to cheer myself up.  I'd like some recommendations from my loyal blog subjects.  Criterion:    1) No stupid romantic comedies (romance is overrated). 2) Nothing with show tunes (unless it's an Indian musical - all those movies from India end up with singing and dancing!) 3) No Andie McDowell features (per  urlLink Jodi ). 4) No guy flicks (e.g., Matrix, Terminator, or anything with loud noises or car chase scenes). 5) Must have a happy ending. 6) Funny enough to make me pee my pants. 7) Creative enough to make me think. 8) No films about World War II or the Holocaust. 9) Nothing with cute animals or small children. 8) No Arnold Schwarzenneger (sp?) comedies.  Period.   (did I mention my period?)  9) Nothing with subtitles.  I stare at a computer all day. 10) John Cusak is good.  Very good.  But don't recommend any of his films to me because I've seen all of them.  Please!  Put me out of my misery!  Here:  LinktoComments(' ')    urlLink  ">Comment

       GOT DICK?    To:   urlLink Jodi   Re:    urlLink "Photo No-nos"   (People who post their baby pictures on their websites)  Ah!  Jodi must have perused  urlLink Jdate !  Each time one of those boneheads uses a baby photo as his main profile picture, I want to email him and ask him if he  really believes  he's being clever.  Does he think he's the  first person  to do this?  G-d, at least 25% of all the profiles on Jdate include baby pictures.  In order of appearance, other "original" ideas include:   2) guy & car 3) guy & motorcycle/boat/airplane 4) guy with ex-girlfriend cropped out (but leaving a well-manicured hand in the picture, around his waist) 5) guy with a pet 6) guy holding a musical instrument (typically a guitar)   I’ve got a suggestion -- why don't they post pictures of themselves holding their units?!  At least the ladies would see what we'd really be getting (rather than poseurs posing with inanimate objects (pets excluded) which they hope will entice us with how creative/athletic/successful they are.  Penis-in-hand would certainly guarantee no false advertising!  (Hand-in-pocket, however, would leave us wondering -- but possibly intrigued.)

       FEAR & LOATHING IN CHICAGO     Fear:    Of crack heads, like the emaciated female who suddenly kicked me in the leg from behind on Saturday on the street corner as I waited for the light to turn green.  Who was so incensed at some imaginary infraction of mine that she followed me, spitting and swearing, into the drugstore.  I cowered behind a (thankfully large) male customer at the checkout counter, clutching the back of his coat.  Crazy Crack Head Woman barreled in through the revolving doors and threw herself at me, her eyes bulging out of her skull, veins in her neck protruding.  (Apparently, I’d somehow prevented her from crossing the street… how  dare  I !!!)  Two employees chased her out of the store.   Burly employee #1:   “Hey!  You can’t be doing that in here!”     (No, assault is only appropriate outside of Osco Drugs - on the sidewalk, which isn’t within the chain’s jurisdiction.)  Crazy Crack Head Woman disappeared into the fading light of the afternoon, probably down into the subway, or back to her hovel at the Mark Twain hotel ½ a block away.    Loathing:    Of the apathetic and lazy teenaged girl behind the counter at the burger stand in Lincoln Park, who refused me a cup of tepid water.  I’d run three miles with three more to go when I suddenly began coughing and couldn’t stop.    Wendy City:   “I’m sorry to ask this,”  [actually, I wasn’t sorry],  “but the Park District hasn’t turned on the fountains for the spring yet - could I trouble you for some water?”   [Gazing longingly at the sink behind the counter and a stack of paper cups].  Apathetic Teen: [putting on her best fake, sympathetic face].   “Um, well we usually have a cooler outside…”   Wendy City:  “But today you don’t.”   A.T.:   “I’m sorry but I can’t do it.”     Can’t or won’t??  G-d forbid she should give me a drink of water… if she did it for me, I might post fliers all along the running path, advertising “Free Water!” at the burger stand.  “Tell your friends!”  Wendy City:  [biting back a cutting and sarcastic remark and making a fake, sad expression].   “You can’t?”   [glancing again at the sink, beginning to cough and wheeze.]   “Oh.  Too bad.”   Lord All-mighty, I so wanted to pummel that chick!  Or at least make a scene, have one of my notorious, screaming hissy fits.  I forgot to mention that her equally apathetic, slacker boyfriend was sitting at a table nearby with a blank expression on his bloated, pale face.

       A HEART ATTACK IN IRAQ      I was just about to post something funny but then I turned on the news and heard about the death today (literally just hours ago) of NBC correspondent,  urlLink David Bloom .   A consummate reporter, I’ve enjoyed so many of his dispatches over the years (and he was  so  handsome!).  He died today in Iraq from a coronary embolism.    A heart attack in Iraq (it rhymes but it’s not funny.)  He was only months away from his 40th birthday, leaving behind a beautiful wife and three children.  I have chills just thinking about how young he was, that I’m about the same age.  While a Communications major at the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Public Programs at Arizona State University, one of the careers I'd considered was that of journalist.

       "DOUCHE-BAGS R US"      To:  My Readers Re: Dan from Jdate (who originally contacted me three weeks ago)  Background:  We made plans to meet for coffee.  I had a physical therapy appointment prior to our 3:00pm "date" and was running late, so being the courteous woman that I am, I phoned to tell him I was behind schedule.  He cancelled because he had a BASKETBALL GAME with "the guys" at 4:00pm and said,  "How 'bout I call you tomorrow and we'll do it then?"   Well, I never heard back from the guy.   Dan is in "sales" (so he says) and publishes a couple of Chicago restaurant guides.  Sits at his desk all day with headsets making calls.  He actually TYPED our initial meeting into his computer calendar when we first spoke (I heard the typing!).   One week later, I sent him an email (a nice one, nicer than he deserved) and said,   From: BrunettesR Morefun  To: DanS***@rcn.com  Subject: Hi, Dan   Hey Dan,   Why didn't you call me to reschedule our coffee date?  I'm disappointed!   Wendy    No response!  I wrote back again:  From: BrunettesR Morefun  To: DanS***@rcn.com  Subject: Re: Hi Dan   Well, how LAME of you!!  I guess you have plenty of prospects.  Why did you waste my time?  Wendy      Again, no response... until yesterday:  From: DanS***@rcn.com  To: BrunettesR Morefun  Subject: Re: Hi Dan   I'm sorry that you are upset.  I didn't call because I didn't have you on my schedule to call.  You certainly could of [sic] called me if you were waiting.    Sorry, Dan   Yes, I certainly "could of" called him!  WTF??  How 'come someone as  fabulous  as me gets reamed by  losers  like Dan?  Seriously!  I'm beginning to get a complex.  He has no idea what he's missing... I know which Starbucks® he hangs out at...

       THE BOURGEOIS ROLLER COASTER   * I did my first receptionist lunch relief shift at The Unsuspecting Company, Inc.  The phone rang once but it was a wrong number.    * A messenger dropped off a parcel and he reeked of cologne.  Why do some men wear smells to the office?  It makes me want to gag.   * My co-worker showed me the support garment she wears since her tummy-tuck surgery.  All I did was mention the back brace I'm wearing for my neck problems and, oh geez... it's self-disclosure time!  She pulled down the waistband of her baggy pants and I could see the scar.  (Screech!!!!!!!)   ...and how was  your  day??   LinktoComments(' ')    urlLink  ">Comment

She has a cutting-edge sense of humor, a real grasp on who she is, is appreciative of her life, and has some perspectives that I'm sure will give us pause.  So, visit her and post a comment or two!

       APOLOGY   Several of my readers, who happen to be experienced bloggers, have pointed out that my posting of photos and profiles of people on an online dating service are in poor taste and overstep the bounds of privacy.  Henceforth, I shall cease and desist in distributing any identifying information about these people on my blog, no matter how poorly they present themselves or how much I may wish to ridicule them.  I'm ashamed that a woman of my age and so-called maturity level would be so insensitive.  What more can I say?  D, I'm sorry that I linked you to my site in reference to my recent post about that one person.  Please stop by and visit.  J, give me another chance, okay?  I'll post something more meaningful in the future - I promise!  Wendy   LinktoComments(' ')    urlLink  ">Comment

I’ll let you know how it is.    15 minutes later...    Ooooh, this is really good (so far!)    1 hour, 35 minutes later...    Very good.  I give it a 7.5 out of 10 stars.

        ECZEMA, PSORIASIS, LIVER SPOTS, WRINKLES!!    Office Culture   There is a running theme in virtually every office in Corporate America… an abundance of sugary treats, Krispy Crème Mondays, Bagel Wednesdays, leftover food from meetings (and, of course, the requisite several out-of-shape individuals who are the first ones to come back for seconds and thirds with a guilty,  “oh, I really shouldn’t!”  look on their faces.)  However, the most annoying of all office trends are those co-workers who solicit money for various charities, environmental causes or supplemental income via their home business (in my office, one lady personalizes baby books for newborns, which she prints and binds at home – she keeps a stack of them prominently displayed on her desk).    When someone posts an order form on the kitchen bulletin board selling Girl Scout Cookies for their daughter’s Brownie troop, comes around to my desk imploring me to buy a chocolate bar to support their son’s trip to a soccer playoff in some suburb far, far away, or asks for sponsors for their upcoming MS/Diabetes/Breast Cancer/Animal Shelter Walk-A-Thon, I usually humor them (more out of guilt than any real interest in saving, say, the Spotted Wood Owl in Washington State).  I admit I do love those Thin Mints (especially after putting them in the freezer!)  I thought I’d seen it all until I received this email from another office mate this afternoon:  Sent: Thursday, April 24, 2003 4:05 PM Subject: Eczema, Psoriasis, Liver Spots, WRINKLES   If you know anyone that has any of the above conditions, let me know.  I have a great new product (been on the market for less than a week!) that is very reasonably priced for my "family" (50% discount) and has drastically improved/reduced the symptoms of eczema, psoriasis & liver spots as well as bug bites (?) and acne/pimples...oh yeah - it works great for wrinkles too!   I have samples if anyone's interested!   Thanks! “Michelle” (* not her real name)   Now, if I was so unfortunate as to suffer from any of the above afflictions, I wouldn’t be much inclined to share that information with someone at work (especially a woman!)   I  could  say I’d like a sample for “a friend” but you know how women love to gossip!   Well, I'd make one exception to my rule -- I have a raging case of foot odor that seems incurable.  If Michelle's product could cure that, I'd be willing to try anything.    LinktoComments(' ')    urlLink  ">Comment

       HAPPY ADMINISTRATIVE PROFESSIONALS DAY!!*    [* Formerly known as "Secretary's Day"]   My new boss, the CEO of The Unsuspecting Company, Inc., gave me an early gift yesterday: two condescending comments (the only two full sentences he's spoken to me since I began working there three weeks ago --  normally, he just grunts.)  1. "It's not my job to know those things... that's what I hired  you  for!"   (In response to my query about his meeting schedule during an upcoming L.A. business trip; a schedule arranged by another consultant who's the "lead" on the project, unbeknownst to me.)   2. "Why would you put me in  that  hotel by the airport when it's an hour from the client's office?  You really need to  look  at these things and think them through!"  (Note: the hotel arrangements he referred to were arranged by another administrative assistant prior to my employment).   Thank you, kind sir.  I will try harder next time (grovel, grovel).    Don't think for a minute that The Wendy City didn't have a few choice words for this pig, designed to put him in his place.  This time, however, I took the high road, for one simple reason:    I'm a Paycheck Whore!   LinktoComments(' ')    urlLink  ">Comment

       GA-GA FOR GUMBALLS!      At the Irish Pub yesterday, I went to the ladies room and was unable to open the door.  At this particular pub, there happened to be a large gumball machine positioned just outside of the rest room, along with three manic children (two girls and a boy, all under the age of 7) who were literally  throwing  themselves at it in a desperate attempt to get at the brightly-colored gob-stoppers inside.  The machine was bigger than they were and they apparently felt the need to gang up on it.   These children were screaming and screeching with such a high pitch, I'm sure all of the dogs in Chicago were running under cars for shelter and cringing in fear.  One of the little girls (in her Easter dress) bounced off of her brother and flew into the bathroom door with such a thud!  She howled in anger, then picked herself back up off the floor for another assault, first on her brother and then on the gumball machine.   I wondered where the parents were during this episode?  Probably getting stinking pissed at the bar.     I firmly believe that children should never get a taste of sugar, at least not until they are 18.  It's a poor substitute for parental supervision... and what were these kids doing in a bar to  begin  with??    LinktoComments(' ')    urlLink  ">Comment

       SHE FORGOT TO FLOSS!   Office Culture – Part IV       I was on my way to the lady’s room and passed our receptionist in the hall (I’ll call her “Flossie”).  Suddenly, I did a double-take because she had a  toothbrush  shoved in her mouth and was actually  brushing her teeth  (!!!) as she walked by.  Now, I’m all for  urlLink practicing good dental hygiene  (among other kinds of hygiene but I’ll get into that in a later post).  Most Americans don’t brush or floss between meals – poor oral health is becoming something of a national epidemic.  However…  MUST  my co-workers gross me out, each and every day of my employment at The Unsuspecting Company?  Is this some kind of a conspiracy or am I an unwitting target on “Candid Camera”?  I keep looking around for a little camera hidden behind the plants or filing cabinets but I haven’t found it yet.  Later, I mentioned Flossie’s tooth-brushing antics to Michelle (while she clipped her nails into the wastebasket under her desk).   “Oh,”  Michelle said,  “she’s been talked to about that before.”     It could have been worse, though.  Flossie  could  have been sitting at the front desk, shaving her legs...   (p.s. It seems I'm not the only one with issues at work - read  urlLink Anthony's  latest post!)

       I HATE OVERTIME!   I had to work late tonight.  Until 9pm.  They have scheduled overtime at this new job at The Unsuspecting Company, and I thought I'd be okay with it.  I'm not.  The consultants there (and executive assistants) frequently work until 10pm at least 3 nights per week.  Most of the EA's here look so...  haggard!   This is supposed to be justified by time and a half salary (I could make some good money).  They also schedule overtime on weekends.  The irony is that they were going to offer me a $7 thousand dollars per year cut in my base salary, justifying the overtime as filling in the gap.  I was able to get them to offer my previous job's base salary, but still, I don't like it.  I'd packed my gym bag for a workout after work (assumed I'd get off by 7pm).  My workouts mean a lot to me, almost as much as the $4,000 a year in overtime pay.  I'm trying to keep focused on the money, as it is a way to pay for graduate school so I can finally leave being a secretary behind.  It's hard, though....   It was weird getting out of the office when it was dark out, especially since today was so beautiful. I could have done my lower body workout in 30 minutes, then gone for a nice run through Lincoln Park while it was still light out.  Ah, what am I saying?  This is only temporary!  However, my first thought as I hailed a cab at 9pm was "I shouldn't have to be doing this anymore."  I want a normal 9 to 5 job, and a family to come home to.  Some of our female consultants are over age 40, married with kids, and they put in long hours.  That's not for me.  I imagine their kids saying, "When's mommy coming home?  Will she be home in time to read me a story and tuck me into bed?"   I don't want to be a mom who works until 9pm.  At least not on a regular basis, like these gals (and guys) do.  True, they make tons of bank but at what cost???   I imagine a nice job at a small firm, then home at a reasonable hour that affords me time to go to the gym, then home for dinner and a walk through the park, then some t.v.  Sounds boring but my life has been a roller coaster ride for so long.  I long for some stabililty and something more predictable.  In the meantime, I've been sending my resume out to jobs I've seen posted on Monster.com and HotJobs.com because there are positions out there (I hope) where I can make a decent living without messing up my sleep schedule (and bosses who have a pulse, unlike the bloated, red-faced mysogynist who's my new boss.

       WHAT A WITCH!!!!     Carmen        As the coroner, I must aver I thoroughly examined her And she’s not only merely dead She’s really most sincerely dead!

I was given the daunting task of scheduling research interviews via conference calls with the managing sales directors of a major brokerage firm – 30, in all, from all over the country.  Carmen is the executive assistant to the gentleman in San Francisco whom my boss wished to speak with.  I knew that there was something a bit tense about her from our first two conversations last week; something in her tone that told me she had an overly-inflated opinion of herself and her role as a SECRETARY.   ”I am  very  protective of Mr. L’s calendar” , she told me in a lofty tone,  "and no appointments are scheduled until  I  okay it first."   This morning, she rang me and began berating me because the dial-in number and conference call password didn’t work and  “Mr. L had to come up from the trading floor only to have the call not go through!”   She continued...  Carmen:  “I would have  expected  that you’d have things sorted out  before  this call was to commence!”   Wendy:   “What number and password did I email to you?”   (She read the correct numbers back to me).   “Well, let me contact the gentleman conducting the interview and see what happened.”   Carmen:  “I think you owe Mr. L an  apology  for not doing your job!  I’m used to doing  my  job with  99.9% accuracy  and this is  unacceptable !!”   Wendy:  “Listen, you bitch, I do my job with  100%  accuracy and your  attitude  is unacceptable!  So,  f**k off !”   (I slammed down the phone).  Yes, I actually told a client’s assistant to f**k off!  In the ten years I’ve worked as a secretary, with all of the assholes I’ve had to deal with, I’ve never said that to anyone (to their face, of course).  I guess I just reached the boiling point after so many years.  Later… Carmen phoned again to tell me that Mr. L and my boss had been on the call for over an hour and the number had worked, after all.  I don’t know why she thought it hadn’t.  She didn’t apologize, only said,  ”Let’s just forget about it… and have a nice day!”   Twenty minutes later, I was called into the Human Resources Manager’s office and terminated.  YAY!!!!!!  What a  relief !  (p.s. – Ironically, I’d already scheduled a second interview with a very nice investment firm for during my lunch hour today, so I went straight from my now former employer’s, grabbed a sandwich, then interviewed my ass off.  At the conclusion, they asked me back for a third interview with a senior partner!)

       100 THINGS ABOUT ME (inspired by  urlLink Celia )   1)  My bellybutton is an “inny”. 2)  I can quote “Beowolf”. 3)  My brother and I once pretended to be deaf just to mess with a grocery store clerk. 4)  We also adopted fake Russian accents (not really knowing what a Russian accent sounded like). 5)  I like eating pretzels with mustard. 6)  I’ve never colored my hair or had a bikini wax. 7)  I never miss an episode of “Saturday Night Live” (including reruns). 8)  In high school, my friends and I did a Gilda Radner sketch for Talent Night.  We lost. 9)  I used to transcribe Pink Floyd songs into piano pieces when I was 16 and drove my parents nuts (“Dark Side of the Moon” for piano!) 10) I love the Grateful Dead but people in Chicago just don’t understand. 11) 90% of my book collection consists of Rock and Roll biographies. 12) I had a crush on Mark Hamill when I was 13.  If only I’d known that Harrison Ford was so much hotter… 13) I hate people who say “ciao!”. 14) I wouldn’t kick Sela Ward out of bed. 15) My favorite film is “Harold & Maude”. 16) I’m all for older women (being one). 17) I can’t tie a cherry stem with my tongue but I’m willing to learn. 18) I once “dated” Barry Bonds.  He bought me a hamburger at Ho-Jo’s in Tempe, Arizona. 19) I think I'm smarter than the average bear. 20) My second toe is my longest toe - it's almost freakish! 21) I used to bite my toenails when I was 7. 22) If I have a child, I often wonder, will it have my feet?    To be continued...

       SO-SOFU   I suck!  I tried Jodi's " urlLink Jofu " recipe and it came out so-so.  I drained the water from the tofu, added the oil, browned it, etc, etc, etc and after 10 minutes, the center of the tofu was still raw.  I cut the brick up into 12 pieces but I probably shouldn't have made them so thick.   Here are the results.  My dinnerware isn't nearly as nice as hers but I'm quite proud of the green and yellow bamboo placemats from Pier One (I also have red ones but they're dirty).  The chopsticks were from a recent Chinese take-out order.    So-Sofu vs. Jofu      Photo Two shows the glass of Merlot I choked my creation down with (fuck it if stir-fry requires a zippy Zinfandel or snappy Sauvignon Blanc... all I had in the apartment was the Merlot).

A piece of cork was found just above the handle in Sosa's bat Tuesday night when it shattered after he grounded out in the first inning of the Chicago Cubs' 3-2 victory. Sosa didn't deny the corked bat was his, but he said it was a batting practice model that he had grabbed by accident.

       THE PIVOT QUESTIONNAIRE ("Inside The Actor's Studio" Questions)   These 10 questions originally came from a French series, "Bouillon de Culture" hosted by Bernard Pivot.  They're better known as the questions that James Lipton asks every guest at the end of "Inside the Actor's Studio" show.   Answers them for yourself, and have fun with your friends. You'll be  amazed at how much they reveal about a person's thoughts, feelings and beliefs.     1.  What is your favorite word?    Supercalifragilistic      2.  What is your least favorite word?    Cunt     3.  What turns you on creatively, spiritually or emotionally?    Music & Matisse     4.  What turns you off?    Condescension      5.  What is your favorite curse word?

What profession other than your own would you like to attempt?    Surgeon     9.  What profession would you not like to do?    Mortician     10. If Heaven exists, what would you like to hear God say when you arrive at the Pearly Gates?    It only gets better from here, kiddo!

       THINNING OF THE HERD   Tonight, while being driven home after a night out with a friend, we witnessed the following in a ten-minute time span:  1. A man in a wheelchair, dressed in black, motoring down Sheridan Road -- against traffic. 2. A punk rocker, dressed in black, riding a skateboard down Irving Park Road -- against traffic. 3. A man, dressed in black, walking along Lake Shore Drive -- against traffic.  We laughed our asses off.  Haven't these people ever heard of  sidewalks ??  Thank God Jon’s car has halogen headlights!  Haven’t these people  any  sense of self-preservation?  Didn’t they take traffic safety in elementary school?  One of these fellows will surely make a posthumous appearance in the  urlLink Darwin Awards .

       SHINING STAR FOR YOU TO SEE... BOOGIE-WOOGIE DANCE!  A star-sighting at Walgreens    I was going to write about a weird altercation I witnessed between an inebriated customer at Osco Drugs and a Jappy princess on a cell phone.  However, 10 minutes later, I crossed the street to my local Walgreen's to purchase some items that Osco didn't carry and observed the following even weirder situation:  A tall, thin black man in his early 50's was paying for his purchases at one of the 5 checkstands and chatting with the clerk.  He was well-groomed, untastefully-appointed with gold chains, several bowling-ball sized, jewel-encrusted rings, a Tommy Hilfigar track suit, and resplendent with a lion's mane of ironed, shoulder-length pompadour.  My first reaction was "I wish I had my digital camera to snap a picture of that hair!"  But alas, I didn't have my camera with me.  I would soon come to regret my gross negligance.  I selected my Whoppers and David® Sunflower Seeds (David® is the only brand of sunflower seeds I injest -- they're salty but not overly so), and approached the checkstands.  Mr. Pompadour was still there but now he was surrounded by five clerks, who had all left their posts to swarm around him and have their photos taken with this man (with the exception of a sixth clerk who remained at her register).  The rest of us customers just had to wait while this drama unfolded.  Mr. Pompadour was flanked by two adoring clerks on either side while the fifth took their picture with a large Polaroid camera, the kind used for passport snapshots.  W:  "What, are you offering free passport photos today?"   Clerk:  (Blank look)  W:  "Who is that?"   Clerk:  "It's  urlLink Earth, Wind and Fire !!"   W:  "You mean to tell me he's the entire group?      (Upon returning home, a quick Google search allowed me to identify him as Verdine White, the band's bass player and yes, he really is as scary-looking as this photo from his website!)     How exciting!  I must not have my finger on the pulse of 70's R&B/funk bands -- I thought he  was one of Chicago's friendly neighborhood Super Freaks.  Now, some "celebrities" are rude when approached for their photographs or autographs, but not Mr. EW&F Pompadour.  After three pictures were taken, he instructed that more be taken "in case them others don't come out good."  Several minutes later when the excitement died down and he'd left the store and disappeared into his waiting stretch limo, I paid for my snacks.  Rene, the one clerk who didn't seem phased by the cult of personality told me, "Who the heck cares?  R. Kelly was in here last week.  They all be the same to me."  I like Rene!

       MYSTERY IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD   This is big news on Channel 5... and it happened in the mansion across the street from me!  It's a really creepy building, with overgrown foliage and shrouded windows and I've actually photographed it on several occasions because it is so odd-looking.  I've always assumed it was unoccupied.   (Another "creepy" mansion in my neighborhood is the former Playboy Mansion) .    I'll try to find those pictures and post them.  It's not a surprise to me that something weird was going on in there.   urlLink http://www.nbc5.com/news/2280257/detail.html

       IF YOU WANT SOMETHING DONE RIGHT, DO IT YOURSELF   ##@!! recruiters!  The one I'm currently using has arranged two job prospects for me with outstanding firms.  However, D___, the woman who is my employment consultant, can't seem to stay organized.  Each time I've seen her or spoken with her, she seems a bit frazzled.  Last week, I asked her for a copy of my test scores.  She forgot.  Two days ago, I asked her for the email addresses of the people I interviewed with (to send them thank you's).  She didn't have them so I said I would call the company directly.   "No, don't do that. Let me."   I still don't have that information.  I just phoned the company myself for the email addresses.  At first, I got somebody's voice mail, so I zero'd out and spoke to the receptionist.  It took all of five minutes.  Then I called my recruiter.  D:  "Oh!  Well, I left a message for them and didn't hear back yet."   W:  "Well, I just called them and got the addresses, D___.  I don't like to wait too long before sending thank you letters.   D:  "Um, okay."   What a dumbass! This pisses me off.  What is she getting a commission for?  Why not cut out the middleman (or woman, as the case may be) and add that fee into my salary?

       WENDY HOGS THE BLANKET!   This afternoon, I had an interview with an H.R. manager at a major newspaper (yeah, try and guess which one!) for a position in their interactive division.  She had a picture of her husband and child on her desk.  We made a bit of "chit chat" about her family.    It turns out that her husband is a Director at the consulting firm I posted about previously -- not only that but he is one of the executives I would be supporting if I'm offered the job there!  (I didn't mention this to her, of course.  She'll find out soon enough).  I can just imagine them laying in bed tomorrow night, comparing notes on my interviewing abilities!  There's a punchline in there somewhere... anyone? anyone?   urlLink Bueller ?  Bueller?

       HOW A CONSULTING FIRM PLANS TO ASSESS MY ABILITIES    Here are some examples of questions I was asked during a test at a prospective employer today (Note: I will not be asked back for an actual interview unless I  pass  this test!):   The first test consisted of spelling, grammar and reading comprehension.  I was given 40 minutes to complete this portion with a #2 pencil.  I wasn’t too concerned because these are my strongest skills.  Examples:  1.  Spurious   (a) false  (b) precise  (c) demanding  (d) covert  2.  Vitiate   (a)  corrupt  (b) infectious  (c) ineffective  (d) praise  3. Replace the  one  word in the sentence that is grammatically incorrect:  “Our research has resulted in a guarantee that all of the orders are all right.”   The second test -- a series of 50 questions which I was given 12 minutes to complete (!).  Apparently designed to test my “problem solving” abilities, it consisted of mathematical questions, as well as conceptual puzzles involving spacial relations and geometry.    Example:  1. What number does not fit in this series?  (a) ½  (b) ¼  (c) 1/8  (d) 1/9  (e) 1/16  I looked at the fine print at the bottom of the printout and saw it was published by a company called  urlLink Wonderlic, Inc .  (“Recruiting, Assessment and Retention Solutions Since 1937”) .  Their homepage states,  “Research has proven that cognitive ability is the single greatest predictor of job success. Resumes, education, references and interviews are less likely to help you make the right hiring decision.”   Frankly, this is a bunch of bullshit.  Who the fuck  cares  about my ability to ascertain that two triangles, when put together in a certain way, form a fucking SQUARE?  When will I ever have to use this cognitive skill when I’m making travel arrangements for an executive, or reconciling his expense report?  I'd like the results of the fresh-faced, 20-something H.R. coordinator who administered this test to me. Frankly, I found her demeanor and professionalism  urlLink spurious .

       TESTING MY PATIENCE   I have a 1:00 pm appointment at a consulting firm today.  Not for an interview... for a series of TESTS (spelling, grammar, math...  and  a personality test [dear God, noooo!]).    If I "pass", then I will be granted an interview.   All this for an administrative support position.  This is what the world has come to.

        250,000 PEOPLE, EATING & DRINKING.  ONLY 25 PORTA-POTTIES.   YOU  DO THE MATH .       Summertime is Festival Time in Chicago.  Currently, the city is hosting the annual  urlLink Taste of Chicago  week-long festival in Grant Park.  Restaurants from all over the city have booths offering their specialties.    Since most of these delicacies are Chicago-type food products (i.e., meat-on-a-stick: hotdogs, bratwurst, Italian Beef sandwiches, Slab 'O Ribs, pizza; anything with oil, lard and red meat and cheese), my stomach simply will not let me partake.  While it's all tasty, I get physically ill 20 minutes after ingesting most of that kind of food and believe me, you don't want to come down with immediate, explosive diarrhea and stand in a long Porta-Potty line in Grant Park!  The upside of Taste of Chicago is the wonderful bands that play there: this year, Erykah Badu, Sheryl Crow, Elvis Costello... and all for free!   However, I would forgo the free music for a  urlLink health food fair  that offers carob-fudge pie and grilled seitan.  I'd even buy extra helpings and take them home with me!

        KIDZ R US    Someday soon, I'd like to get married and have a baby or two.  I'm not particularly maternal but then again, when I see babies in strollers, I almost begin crying.  Today, I saw an Asian man with a newborn in one of those carrying packs which he wore on his chest.  The kid was SO CUTE, and sleeping.  Maybe I'm crying not because I want a baby, but because I wish I still WAS a baby!  How cool would it be to not have to worry about taking the bus when someone could just carry you around in a little pack on his/her chest?

       DEFINITION OF FRATERNITIES FOR MY OVERSEAS FRIENDS   This is a pledge paddle.  You swat someone on the ass with it and they are required to respond,  "Thank you sir, may I have another?"        urlLink londonmark  commented:    Fraternity/sorority – could you explain these for your transatlantic contingent? What are they for, why do people join and what's the obsession with the alpha beta?  Mark @ 4:51AM | 2003-06-27| permalink       urlLink fra·ter·ni·ty   ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (fr-tûrn-t) n. pl.  fra·ter·ni·ties    1. A body of people associated for a common purpose or interest, such as a guild.  2. A group of people joined by similar backgrounds, occupations, interests, or tastes:  the fraternity of bird watchers.   3. A chiefly social organization of men students at a college or university, usually designated by Greek letters.  4.   Roman Catholic Church  . A sodality.  5. The quality or condition of being brothers; brotherliness.   Mark, I'm not sure about the obsession with the Alpha Beta but I do know that it's a requirement for all new fraternity members to memorize the Greek alphabet.  There must be an English equivalent to the American Fraternity, no?  For an illustration of Fraternity Life, please refer to the 1978 film, " urlLink Animal House ", starring the beloved and now dead John Belushi.       Now, let's end this thread and begin a new discussion about the merits of John Belushi's comedic talent.  I'm a huge fan of him and all things " urlLink Saturday Night Live " (our long-running, late-night comedy t.v. show, as my U.S. blogger friends know!)

       FRATERNAL BROTHERHOOD OF "GIRLS GONE WILD"   More fraternity boy observations (and let me go on record by stating that "frat boys" are not all bad.  It's just that whenever I've had incidents between myself and males, they've tended to fit a certain demographic).  Another disturbing incident today between me and a male (former fraternity boy?) driving a Jeep Cherokee while I was finishing my daily 5-mile run:  I'm jogging in place on a street corner, along with another female runner waiting for the green "Walk" sign to flash (note: I'm one of very few pedestrians in Chicago, Illinois who actually  obeys  traffic signs!)  Light turns green.  I proceeded to jog across the street.  Directly across from me was a rust-colored Jeep which simultaneously began making a left-hand turn.  The driver hit the gas as I was less than one yard from the corner.  He screeched to a rocking halt and blasted his horn at me.  How dare I slow him down!  I raised my arms in a  "what the f*ck is your problem?"  gesture and stared directly at the driver through his open window.  Male.  Early 20's.  Requisite baseball cap and blaring hip-hop on his stereo (Eminem?  50-Cent?).  As I passed by, this IDIOT blasted his horn again, swore at me and peeled off around the corner but not before tossing an empty Coke can at me through his window.  The other woman runner behind me declared,  "Ohmigod!  What an asshole!"   (At least I have a witness that I don't make up these stories just for something to post on my blog).  What  is  it with me and these douchebags?  I'm just out for a run, minding the traffic and my own business.  Fortunately for him, he took off too fast for me to catch him, fling open his door and shove the can up his ass.   (P.S. - I was actually once a "little sister" at the Sigma Nu house in college. The collective consciousness (back in the early 80's) was focused on wearing plaid shorts, Polo shirts, drinking, smoking cigars and hosting "Caddyshack" parties. I much prefer the Preppy, "old school" fraternity boy mentality, not the current "Girls Gone Wild",  urlLink misogyny -fest (and the constant Eminem-listening!)  (P.S.S. - Tonight on "Dateline NBC": an expose on Eminem, his mother and his new baby-dangling music video.  How apropos!  I think I'll watch it... perhaps I'll gain some insight and some tolerance.)

       ABOUT THE POWERS OF OBSERVATION AND LACK OF DEDUCTIVE REASONING   Today, at Bloomingdale's, while trying on interviewing suits:  I exited my dressing room to place an item that didn't fit me on a clothes rack (in the dressing room area, not out on the sales floor).  A customer in her late 60's approached me, holding a blouse on a hanger.  Customer:   "Excuse me, can you find this top for me in a size 6?"   Wendy:  "Ummmm..."   Customer:   "Do you work here?"   Wendy: (looking down at my bra-clad chestal region, then back up at the woman).   "Ummmm... sorry... no, I don't."   Customer:  "If you don't have it in a 6, maybe you can find it in an 8?  Thanks!"

        BASEBALL ,  HOT DOGS ,  APPLE PIE  &  SASHIMI         Raw Fish: The most patriotic and American of all Independence Day delicacies!   Tonight,  urlLink Leo  and I plowed our way through this platter of sushi at  urlLink Tsunami  while he regaled me with his theory of rating people based on their attractiveness.  Those who fall in the "0-5" range should be banished to an island where they can procreate with others on the same scale without the possibility of polluting the gene pool of those ranking in a higher range.  "Points" to be awarded to those individuals ranked a "10" who breed with someone positioned much lower on the attractiveness scale, as sharing their genes with those less fortunate would be considered benevolent and charitable.  Special circumstances would be afforded to "little people" for reasons that Leo didn't quite make clear.  An interesting proposal, considering that tomorrow is the celebration of the birth of our nation and celebration of our tolerance and diversity  (yeah, right) .  I found his theory evocative of Hitler's dream of an Aryan Nation and a Supreme Race.  I let it slide because I knew it was only the entire bottle of Chardonney talking... or  was  it...?   (As we ate, I couldn't help but wonder if Leo was compromising his position as an "8.5" by sharing a meal with a "6.75".  Still, we both rank higher than a "5" so I'm assuming I was an acceptable dining partner... or a charity case.)   Thanks for dinner, Leo!

       HAPPY INDEPENDENCE DAY!   Happy 4th of July to all!  It's been a sad week in Chicago, with the  urlLink porch collapse  in Lincoln Park (Chicago) which took the lives of 13 young people.  My friends and I at my gym have been especially saddened, because one of the victims, a 23-year-old woman named Kathleen Sheriff, was a member of our gym and a good friend with several of our management staff (who are also good friends of mine).  I learned today that another female victim lived in an apartment building two doors away.  It makes me reassess so much of the crap that I tend to worry about.  I'm realizing that we only have one, short life.  Keeping this in mind, although I haven't a single plan for the holiday, I decided today to drum up some plans.  I'm going to see Sheryl Crow play for free at the Taste of Chicago on Saturday (even though I detest large crowds) and my neighbor Sonia and I are going to host a "Sex in the City" party at her apartment on Sunday (even though I haven't seen an episode in three years!).  We're inviting the gay guys from the 4th floor who have been regaling us with the crazy story of their romance each afternoon down at my pool.  So, what are YOUR plans?

       NO IFS, ANDS OR BUTTS   As a rule, I don't usually watch "reality t.v." shows but tonight I was flipping through the channels and happened upon  urlLink Paradise Hotel  on the FOX network.  The premise of this show:   Follow a group of eleven single men and women who are given the opportunity of a lifetime -- to live together in the most exclusive resort ever created. But paradise doesn't last forever… Each week, one hotel guest will be eliminated to make room for someone new. "  One of the women was interviewed and told a bit about herself:   "If I could change one thing about my body (giggle!) it would have to be my butt.  I think every girl is a bit anal about her butt (giggle!)   Okay, either she was making a brilliant  urlLink double entendre  or she really IS that stupid!

       ANOTHER DARWIN AWARD    urlLink This  happened early this morning in my neighborhood.  90% of the three story flats in the Lincon Park area have shoddy, wooden back porches.  Add a demographic of recent college grads, several beer kegs and 50 people on one wooden balcony dancing to Eminem, and you can predict the horrible outcome.   urlLink 12 Killed As Porch Collapses in Chicago    I don't mean to sound callous but these were educated, supposedly intelligent young men and women. What where they thinking?  Each summer in Chicago, a balcony collapses at a party.  On a sad note, one of the women killed, a pretty, blonde 23-year-old named Katie, belonged to my gym.  I saw her all the time (I actually learned of this while watcing the t.v. as I ran on the treadmill this morning).  She was supposed to be manning one of the floats in today's Chicago Gay Pride parade in the same neighborhood.  When he heard the news, the manager of my gym tried to reach her at home today (while I stood by, anxiously) but there was no answer.  I cried.  What a tragedy.

       This made headlines in the Chicago papers today:    urlLink Owners of Sears Tower to hand skyscraper over to lender   By the way, the so-called "temp-to-perm" job I am on this week is bogus.  The incumbent administrative assistant (who is on vacation) isn't leaving her position until September (I wasn't informed of this when I agreed to the temp-to-perm gig).  My recruiter told me that if they like me they might make me a job offer.  Turns out this is NOT the case and I've been duped again!  Had I known, I wouldn't have taken the temp job.  Now my unemployment benefits with be delayed!!  Also, the man I've been reporting to here is almost as awful as the one I worked for at that other, short-lived job I posted about in May... he hasn't thrown anything at me but he did throw something on my desk in anger this morning (his computer was working too slow and he was "acting out").  One of the assistants told me that his current secretary is often in tears by the end of the day, working for this man.  I can see why.  Glad I don't have to return here next week... it's bad enough to have to be forced to find work through temp-to-perm (more and more companies want to try before they buy).  This would never happen to a male executive -- can you imagine making a prospective CEO do temp work to prove himself?  But to have to temp and work with assholes is so demeaning and depressing  (Why me, God, why me???!!!)  All I want is a nice job working for nice people at a nice salary.  I want to get on with my life.

       RAGING AGAINST THE MACHINE Hopes he dies before he gets old   Roger Daltrey had  urlLink this  (and  urlLink this ) to say about Pete Townshend's recent troubles (Townshend, guitarist for The Who, is my favorite singer/songwriter).  With some degree of hesitation (I'm conflicted,  urlLink after this happened in my neighborhood ), I do agree with Roger on a certain level.  [Excerpt:  "What are we becoming? The fucking Taliban? Pete's an artist and may have been naive, but he did nothing wrong and told the truth from the start. But he was treated as though he was guilty of the worst crimes and crucified without a trial by people with no accountability. It's a fucking disgrace. Everything they did to him was appalling." ]  I have a feeling that this post will stir up some debate.  Discuss amongst yourselves... or comment here:

       WHY I HATE THE GENERAL PUBLIC   This attractive family traveled to last weekend’s Taste of Chicago food and music festival from the South Side of Chicago on the El train, arriving at Grant Park at approximately 9:00 am CST to stake out their spot on the grass.  Although the concert wouldn’t begin until 6:00 pm, they didn’t want to risk the chance of getting a poor spot in the lawn, which was muddied by the previous night’s rain storm.  Fortified with folding lawn chairs, blankets and coolers, they positioned themselves directly in front of one of three fences which separated the masses from the Main Stage, where Sheryl Crow and Elvis Costello would perform on consecutive evenings. (Note fake Budweiser spiked chain tatoos on the upper arms of mother and daugher.  Charming.)      My friend and I arrived at 5:30 pm and made our way as far to the front of the lawn section as we could.  There were actually two fences – one brown picket fence and a chain-link one, separated by an asphalt walkway.  The pavilion was off-limits to only Taste of Chicago corporate sponsors, so it was impossible for anyone beyond this section to view the artists on the stage (a large projection screen was erected to facilitate the view).     When we arrived, we noticed these three shopping bags filled with contraband:     I asked the daughter where she got all the samples of Guarnier Fructis shampoo and she told me her mom kept going back to the woman handing out samples until she had enough to fill a regular-sized shampoo bottle (note: the shampoo retails for $3.99 USD in most drug stores).  I didn’t realize that the three bags were actually positioned as a line of demarcation, marking the South Side Family’s “spot” on the North Side on the muddy grass until I made the mistake of stepping “over the line”.  Uh-oh…     Almost immediately, the family erupted in anger.  The mother screamed, “this is OUR spot!”  I removed my foot from the part of "their" lawn that I’d desecrated with my red Kenneth Cole sandal, chastised and remorseful.  Moments later, the music began. The family – in unison – immediately picked up their lawn chairs and moved them one foot forward, as close to the picket fence as they could, to discourage the 25,000 people in the crowd from encroaching on their space.  Unfuckingbelievable!     What a joke.  This is the view of the stage that the South Side Family fought for:     But in the end, my red Kenneth Cole sandal prevailed:

       GUESS THE MUSICAL ARTIST  Below are some song lyrics -- post the artist's name and song title into my comments box to (possibly) win a fabulous prize of questionable value! (Hint: these are songs about cars.)   1.    Here in my car / I can listen to you and it keeps me stable for days.   2.   You got a great car / Yeah whats wrong with it today / I used to have one too / maybe I'll come and have a look / I really love your hairdo yeh / I'm glad you like mine too / see where looking pretty cool / Will get ya.   3.   I got me a car, it seats about 20 / So hurry up and bring your jukebox money.   4.  Now some folks say it's too big and uses too much gas / Some folks say it's too old and that it goes too fast / But my love is bigger than a Honda, it's bigger than a Subaru / Hey man there's only one thing and one car that will do / Anyway we don't have to drive it honey, we can park it out in back.   5.  Well the girls can't stand her / 'Cause she walks looks and drives like an ace now.   6.  Hey now mama / Where'd you stay last night / Your hair's all down / Your clothes don't fit you right.   7.  Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz? / My friends all drive Porsches, I must make amends.     (Idea courtesy of  urlLink LondonMark )

I've spent my time running along the lakefront and in the gym, the result of which is my new, fabulous, tanned body (Demi, eat your heart out!).  This isn't exactly my idea of making the world safe for democracy but at least while devoting 10% of my day towards finding a job, I'm looking great.

       BOURGEOIS BAR-B-QUE   My condo building had a summer Bar-B-Que this evening.  Soon tiring of the creepy people who live among me, the coolest and most sophisticated of us retired to the Zebra Lounge (seating capacity = 15) a block away.            The piano player sucked.  He didn't even play "Piano Man"!  What's the world coming to when a cheesy piano bar player on an electric keyboard doesn't play "Piano Man"???

       SATURDAY NIGHT: I SHOULD HAVE STAYED HOME AND WATCHED T.V.   Last night, I went to a private party held for the players of next week's Baseball All Star Game in Chicago, sponsored by Maxim and Harrah's Casino.  My neighbor, Sonia, took me as her guest.  I was very excited, not because I'm a baseball fan but because I thought it would be a great opportunity to people-watch (and who knows, I might meet someone interesting!)  To be honest, I probably wouldn't have recognized Sammy Sosa.  I would, however, recognize Barry Bonds because he went to the same college as I (Arizona State University) and lived next door to me, and when we were freshmen, we were friends.  I even bought new shoes for the occasion (at Aldo, and 50% off!)     We arrived at the Park West Theatre at approximately 9:00 p.m. and discovered that this "private party" wasn't that exclusive at all.  There were thousands of people there of all types.  Yes, there were the requisite Maxim Girls resplendent in their low-rise pants and tight t-shirts, as well as wanna be models; however, the majority of those attending were average-looking overweight suburbanites with huge glasses and fraternity boy types with Docker slacks and blue button-down shirts who looked like they'd just gotten off work.  One particular woman struck my fancy with her back tat:     Here's a photo of the "exclusive" party:     Macy Gray was supposed to perform, so Sonia and I nursed watered-down gin & tonics, waiting for something to happen.  At around 10:00 p.m., we sat down at a table occupied by two men in their late 20's.  Sonia immediately struck up a dialogue with Drunk Boy and, for whatever reason, gave him her business card.  Apparently, he said something offensive and she immediately took her card back.  He must have said something redeeming so, after perusing his driver's license, she continued her conversation with him.  I guess they must have had something in common because before I knew it, he had his hand on her ass.     Well, by 11:00 p.m., we learned from a promoter that Macy Gray had cancelled her appearance several weeks ago but since the invitations had already been printed, they neglected to inform anyone.  The promoter in question took a liking to me and stuck to me like glue for the next hour.  Why oh why am I such a geek magnet?????     Finally tiring of this lame party, Sonia and I (Drunk Boy and friend in tow) decided to blow this lame event but not before a photo opportunity on the red carpet outside the venue, set up for the non-existant ball players and celebrities.  Please!  No paparazzi!     We moved on to Domaine and proceeded to anesthetize ourselves with more gin and tonics.  Domain is a Chicago scenester hangout, and I got my fill of people-watching (whilst Sonia bonded with Drunk Boy).  I went to the ladies' loo and met the Hilton Sisters.  One of the girls was wearing a top resembling a hankerchief which reminded me of J-Lo's infamous Versace dress.  "How do you keep that thing in place?" I asked.  Hilton Sister #1:   "Well, we're nurses..."   Hilton Sister #2:   "...and she used nursing tape!  Giggle!"   Wendy:   "Nursing tape?  Outstanding!  May I take a picture of the two of you?"   Hilton Sisters (in unison):   "Sure!  Are you with Chicago Magazine?"   Wendy:   "Uh, yeah."

       STRAIGHT EYE FOR THE QUEER GUY   I borrowed  urlLink this article  from  urlLink Leo's  site.  In the recent past, I've dated several men who were neater than I, dressed in Prada, and owned one or more cats.  Men who were prettier than I.  Men who got bi-weekly manicures.  I thought there was something questionable about these Dandy Warhols but now, after reading the article linked above, I "get it"... but I don't want to catch "it"!   BIG, FAT, HAIRY SPIDER!!!!      A big, fat, hairy spider just crawled on me!!!!!  I was sitting on my couch at about 11:20 p.m. watching a rerun of Will Ferrell's  urlLink "Blue Oyster Cult" cowbell sketch  on "Saturday Night Live"  (which will thrill  urlLink Jake  to no end)  when I felt something tickling my shoulder.    It was a  big, fat, hairy spider !    Probably one of Boris' offspring (Boris is a GIRL... she's obviously had BABIES!).  I threw a towel over it, went into my bathroom, shook the spider from the towel, and flushed.  Twice, just to be safe.  UGGGGHHHHHHH!!!!

       ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER TYPING TEST        Standard Speed Typing   Keeping customers happy is vital to the success of our business. In the final analysis, service is all we really have to sell, and service means good customer relations.  Customer loyalty must be earned.  It starts with the first contact and is a never-ending daily job.  The moment it ceases, business begins to deteriorate.  Ours is a people business.  We must enjoy dealing with customers.  We must make them feel comfortable and get them to have confidence in us.  Following are some ways we can do this.  Customers like attention.  No one likes to be treated as just another account number.  Mark Twain once said he could live two weeks on a compliment.  So could all of us, including our customers.  Efficient service is also essential.  Customers expect prompt, accurate handling of their business transactions.  However, they don’t want us to be tense or abrupt, rather friendly and efficient at the same time.  The telephone plays a vital part in establishing good customer relations.  A large percentage of our business with customers is conducted by telephone, and every telephone contact makes an impression: positive, negative or indifferent.  Extra care sh taken in telephone usage, in order to leave the customer wi impression.  Customers expect the telephone to be answered the first ring.  They expect a friendly nd resent being placed on hold for ery second of delay seems lik aced on hold for mor th tatus report and oft her qualifie  ves r    [SCORE: 78 wpm.

         WHAT AM I STILL DOING UP AT THIS HOUR?!??   It's 1:30 a.m. CST and I'm still awake...  urlLink Karen , her squeaky bed-mate  urlLink Pete  and  urlLink LondonMark  are probably getting ready for work, as it's 6 hours ahead in the U.K.  (Luckily for them, 6 hours closer to the weekend... as for me,  urlLink every day is like Sunday .  Trudging slowly over wet sand.)   On my mind right now as I download some Happy Mondays and Spin Doctors tunes from WinMx are my two interviews tomorrow.  Both are for administrative assistant positions.  The first is a job with the JCC (Jewish Community Center), to support two executive directors and to be the liason for the JCC's Women's Auxilliary Committee.  This post's salary is about $7K a year less than I've made in my last three positions.  The other interview is a second interview for an administrative project coordinator gig for a national recruiting firm.  They're seeking someone to support the Vice President of their diversity hiring practice.  I have no idea what kind of "practice" diversity hiring entails but I suppose I'll soon find out.  They are not in any sort of rush to retain someone and I was told that they'll keep interviewing until the right person shows up.  After these two interviews, I'm applying for a waitressing position at Tsunami, a local sushi joint (just in case).  To all of the recruiters, employment agencies and human resources managers who keep yanking my chain:  All of your interviewing has grown quite tiresome...  urlLink touch my monkey !  Love him!   (I  know  this post bores you. I know you are in agony, wishing to get out.  How I envy you.)

       OH, CRAP... I'D BETTER CALL  urlLink ORKIN !     "There are thousands of types of pests in the world, but most do not become a problem until they try to make your house their home."     [Pests = Todd and Woody]  In a misguided attempt to cheer me up, my neighbors  Todd and Woody    left me a little "gift", which they slid under my apartment door.  Perhaps inspired by my recent post about the spider infestation outside my window, I'm supposing they thought it would be funny.         Don't worry, I won't make this mistake:        "Boris"      Well, one thing was accomplished: for about three heart-stopping minutes, I didn't think about my unemployment woes.  Thanks, guys.

       ESPAÑOL DEL MERCADO   After conducting business at the unemployment office, I visited this market which was next to the bus stop.  It reminded me of all of the Hispanic grocery stores I frequented when I used to live in Los Angeles.  I only wish I'd felt as bright and cheerful as the products on their shelves...         Unidentifyable Food Products:               I bought a nectarine and some plantain chips and ate them on the bus ride home.

       LIVING ON THE DOLE More tales from the bourgeois roller coaster ride that is my life   I had to take another trip to my local unemployment office because unbeknownst to me, when I worked that one-week temp assignment two weeks ago in the Sears Tower, I made more money than my weekly unemployment benefit amount.  This resulted in my claim being cancelled and I had to physically appear at the office to re-open my claim.  Following are more tales from my 3 hour excursion.    On the #70 Division Street Bus     Fashion Don't:       Fashion Don't II (side view):       The amount of garbage strewn along the sidewalk leading to the unemployment office was appalling... it's almost as if the trash was strategically thrown about to add to the ambiance of being out of work and having to go down there!           urlLink Keep America Beautiful!  Please don't litter!        Thank God for Esmeralda and Hector, who remembered me from my previous visit and greeted me with a smile.    Esmeralda:  "Of course I remember you!" (Thinking: "It's that crazy lady with the camera again.")   Hector:  "Can I go to your site and save my picture to a disk and print it out?"  (Yes, Hector.  Just right-click on it with your mouse and save it to your computer desktop)

       MUSIC TO SHAG BY   I lost my virginity to "Magic Bus" by The Who.   (The only tape Mike Steinberg - a college Senior! -  happened to have at the moment.)   Not the most romantic of songs but one I'll never forget.  What music is on your list of Best Shagging Tunes?  Here is my list:   Roxy Music - Avalon (the entire album... and anything by Bryan Ferry)  Grateful Dead - Brown-eyed Woman; Sugar Magnolia  Beck - Tropicalia  Steely Dan - (anything by them)  Bob Marley - Songs of Freedom Depeche Mode - Just Can't Get Enough The Meters - Look A Py-Py, Hey Pocky-A Way, Funkify Your Life Jane's Addiction - Jane Says Vivaldi - Four Seasons     (Thanks to  urlLink Kate  for the post idea!)

       CONSTRUCTION ZONE   Outside my window     Construction Zone #1:    Thursday morning, 8:00 a.m.  The construction crew begins its work.       Construction Zone #2:    Thursday evening, 8:00 p.m.  The construction crew begins its work.      Is it any wonder why I can't sleep???    urlLink ARACHNOPHOBIA a·rach·no·pho·bi·a    A couple of weeks ago, I wrote about the  urlLink Big, Fat, Hairy Spider  living outside my window.  I named him  urlLink Boris .  As it turns out, Boris is a female spider and has recently given birth to hundreds of little Borises.  I am alternately disgusted and fascinated by these creatures, who are most active at night.  They truly are amazing!  I like to watch them at night as they spin their numerous webs and devour the bugs that have unwittingly met their deaths in the spiders' web of deception.  I'm just glad a pane of glass separates my habitat from theirs... and glad that the exterminator paid me a visit today.         urlLink

       FAUX-POLL    Question:   Have you ever received an email from someone (friend, co-worker) and, intending to forward it to another person with rude, inappropriate, defamatory or potentially litigious comments, accidentally hit "reply" to the original sender rather than "forward" to the third party?  I did.  Last night.  I'm absolutely mortified.  Fast forward to Steps 8, 9 and 10 (and possibly 11) of the  urlLink 12 Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous  (because these Steps can be applied to anyone who writes emails when he/she is drunk.)

       45 QUESTIONS - THE WINNERS!   Seriously, there were so many great answers that it was difficult to choose just one winner for each question (and some of the questions were admittedly lame, so I didn't include them here.)

I remember waking up in the middle of the night in my crib and looking at the brightness of the moon through my window. I also remember riding my tricycle on the sidewalk, I was maybe three years old. I have a very good memory. [Sonia] • Eating a lime popcicle [Sue B.] • Duck Duck Goose at Nursery School [Jonathan D.]  • Walking around the back yard with my German Shepherd on one side, Samoyed on the other, me holding their necks - I was about 2. [Leslie] •  Waking up from a nightmare in which aliens had taken over the world and only offered AAA batteries to the few humans left.  And then crying for my mom. [Cas]    39. DO YOU CRY AT THE MOVIES?    •  Guys never cry, but sometimes our allergies flare up. [Jake N.]  • Only if it's a funny movie! If I laugh so much that I cry I know that it was a good movie. [Sonia] • Honey, I cry during really touching car commercials. (i.e., yes) [Krystal]    40. WHEN YOU RETIRE, WHERE DO YOU WANT TO LIVE?    • The mountains.  Tennessee Pass in Colorado. [Jonathan D.]  • Tuscany [Leslie]   41. IN GENERAL, DO YOU GET ALONG WITH YOUR FAMILY?   • No, but our fights bring us very close together.  We schedule one every couple of months. [Sara] • Yep.  But I'd never share a roof with any of them again. [Jonathan D.]    43. WHAT IS THE MOST MEANINGFUL THING YOU HAVE LEARNED IN LIFE?    •  If you're still breathing then get over it and move on. [Leslie]  • The important people stick around [Krystal] • Whenever you can, do good. [Cas]   44. ARE YOU READY TO DIE, IF TODAY WAS THE DAY?   • I think there are some things left for me to do here.  Get married.  Raise some kids.  Eliminate racism.  Learn a new language. [Jonathan D.]  •  ...I am at peace and I know that beyond here lies just a different type of life. I will not get to keep the  awesome rack  that I have now but that's ok :-) [Sonia]    45. HOW LONG DO YOU THINK YOU'LL KEEP IN TOUCH WITH THE PERSON WHO SENT THIS TO YOU?   • For as long as we feed each other emotionally and have fun ! [Leslie] • Ah, the internet is such an ephemeral media format....who can know these things? [Cas]

       urlLink  GROUNDHOG DAY     "He's having the worst day of his life...over and over again."       That's what the last five months have felt like, folks.  Like the 1993 movie, " urlLink Groundhog Day " starring Bill Murray.  The only difference is, when I wake up each morning at the crack of 11:00 a.m., the clock radio doesn't play "I've Got You, Babe" by Sonny & Cher.  So... what day is today, anyway?      MONKEY MADNESS - UPDATE   The monkey has been found!  (But sadly, now a  urlLink horse  has gone missing!)       MONKEY MADNESS ON THE NORTH SIDE!!!

      Mom wrote:  "You were wearing a jumper and blouse, fishnet stockings and maryjane's.  I dressed you in the most expensive, best designed children's clothing around for that time (and your brothers too). If I could not afford to buy the clothes, then I copied the design and made them."   Fishnet stockings?  On a four-year-old?    I wonder why Mom stopped dressing me in the manner to which I'd become accustomed?

       GET THE RITALIN!  Strung out on sugar - 1968      My Aunt Helen recently discovered this picture of me, taken at her home in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania circa 1968, while going through photographs taken by my recently departed Uncle Morris.  How weird to see an image of myself at age four!  Who was responsible for that God-awful dress?  (You'll never again catch me in white tights and Mary Janes.) And what in God's name was I so exuberant about?  Could it be the new coloring book and crayons?  Did someone feed me tons of candy prior to snapping this photo?  Whatever the case, how I wish I could be as fancy foot and carefree as I obviously was, back then in nineteen sixty-eight, without a care in the world except coloring within the lines.

It does not state that you have to use your own body member; if necessary, therefore, you could borrow other people's body members to move things.  2. It means that if you understood that sentence, you get the CEO's job automatically.  3. For 'signalling' read 'swearing only using your fingers and non-verbal references to illegitimacy'.  4. You must not put all reports and minutes into the 'conditional indifferent' tense.  5. This is to stop you winking at attractive co-workers while the shredder mangles your tie/belt/hair.  6. Foot co-ordination is essential when stomping out of someone's office in a big old hissy fit.  7. Colours are important, especially when dealing with black-and-white faxes and photocopies.  8. Psychic abilities, though useful, are not a prerequisite.

       A MIND IS A TERRIBLE THING TO WASTE   My regular readers are aware that because of my unemployed status, I've been very bored.  My typical persona is that of a highly-inquisitive, hyperactive individual who needs constant mental stimulation to thrive.  In states of inactivity, I become lethargic, depressed, sarcastic and bitchy which for even my closest friends, makes me practically intolerable to be around (even for myself!)  I haven't had an original thought in many months, hence, my numerous postings about Boris the Spider who resides outside my window.    I was thinking about Boris tonight as she and her babies came out to play.  What kind of spider is she?  If she bites me, will I die a horrible death?  How did she manage to find her way up so high, to the 17th floor of my building?  Who invented liquid soap and why?  The exterminator came the other day and said she is a harmless Brown Spider and that she blew up here on the wind.  I decided to search online for more information (because I'm bored, as I said in my previous paragraph.)  Feel free to surf to another Blog Site if my current state of apathy fatigues you (I recommend  urlLink Mark's  site and his recent "The Art of..." series of posts for something completely different).  Otherwise, here is what I discovered about my Spiders in Residence:   • One female may produce as many as 3,000 eggs in a series of several sacs over a period of time. Eggs may hatch a few weeks later (three weeks or the following spring) and reach adulthood in one year.  • Females are fertilized several times during a lifetime with up to nine egg sacs, each containing 200 or more eggs. Young hatch in about eight days, staying within the sac until after the first molt. They are cannibalistic, eating one another.  • Some spiderlings sail through the air (ballooning) on wind currents. Young spiders climb to a high point and release silk strands until the drag from the wind is sufficient to support their weight. Then, they release their hold and sail away, often for considerable distances. These ballooning threads (gossamer) can fill the air on clear days as spiderlings disperse to new areas.   I learned that Boris is either of the species  Neoscona Oaxacensis  or  Theridion sp.   Here are pictures for comparison.  What do you think?   Boris      Neoscona Oaxacensis      Theridion sp.     Okay, this isn't comforting me any.

I have some great stories to tell but I don't have net  access. I'm typing this out on my phone. Tell the world our story! :-D   Here's Jake's theme song (sung to the tune of Journey's "Lights").  When his power is fully restored, perhaps I can get him to detail his story in an interpretive dance via streaming video.   When the lights go out in the City 'cause the power's out today I want it back on in the City Roll, roll, ro-oll-ing  So you think it's your block?

Rabbi Says 'Passion' Already Fueling Hatred     Hier said the bigotry had already started, and that the Simon Wiesenthal Center had received hate mail from people who had seen or heard about the movie, and who accused Jews of killing God's son, praised Adolf Hitler and made veiled threats against the center and Jews collectively.

       urlLink  ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE VOICES CONCERNS ON GIBSON'S 'PASSION'     urlLink This article  on Yahoo News caught my attention.

I have a question! by: melrocks1013    Just wondering. I have NEVER understood why there is anti-semitism in the first place. Anyone know why?   Comments???    Re: I have a question! by: the_walking_dude (666/M/everywhere)   Probably because Jews are common criminals who steal the peoples money and property.   It's abundantly clear to me that the general public are nothing more than a bunch of assholes.  Hiding behind a message board, posting comments that they wouldn't dare voice in public, face to face with a Jew.  In fact, I'll bet my bottom dollar that none of the middle-aged, overweight, male nerds who posted this   urlLink dreck   has known a Jewish person!

        THREE SATURDAY NIGHT POSTS -- THRICE AS NICE!!   A SPECIAL MESSAGE FOR SUE   My new friend left me a gift and a note in my mailbox today.  Wonderful people like Sue make up for the injustices I witness on a nearly daily basis, like the one I just wrote about (next post, below).  Sue, I will remember your kind gesture and be sure to "pay it forward" when I encounter someone going through a difficult time.  You are truly a " urlLink mensch " (and an absolute Godsend!!!!!)      INTOLERANCE IN OUR NEW POST-9/11 (SO-CALLED!) TOLERANT WORLD  "Turn the other cheek?"   A gay friend of mine went across the street to mail some letters today.  A van with four frat boys from the suburbs blared their horn at him and one of them shouted,  "You f*cking faggot!" .  I have to give my friend credit for ignoring them but he was visably upset when he returned to the pool and related the story to us.  If I'd been there, there would have been some serious ass-kicking  (figuratively, of course because I follow Ghandi's gospel of  urlLink non-violence ) !    I'm certain that if any of those four jerks happened to encounter my friend without his other three buddies, he wouldn't have been so quick to call my friend a faggot.  Methinks not.  I wonder how would I have reacted if I was walking down the street and someone shouted, "You dirty Jew!"  I'm fortunate that I've never encountered any sort of blatant anti-semitism; however, it wasn't so long ago that 6 million were persecuted and killed for their religious beliefs...    NICE RACK!   Hey T., thanks for the  urlLink Ligne Roset  cd rack.  It's way cool... I love it!  Do you happen to have the remaining 5 shelves?  They are missing...

       THIS ISN'T FUNNY ANYMORE!      I left town for a week and returned to an absolute  infestation  of spiders outside my apartment window.  They are the third generation of the original spider,  urlLink Boris  (who I posted about last month).  I can no longer open my window because the babies manage to squeeze their little bodies through the screen, so I've kept it closed and have been running my A/C 24 hours a day as it's been so hot.  I'm a conservationist and it upsets me to have to run up my electricity bill, especially when I am not at home.  Besides, I really don't mind the heat, so in normal circumstances, my air conditioning is reserved for only the hottest and most humid of days.  The management of my building told me there is nothing that can be done until the window washers arrive in October!  Because of the way my window is installed, there is absolutely no way for me to open it and direct a hose at the cobwebs.  Any suggestions??

       SHOUT OUT TO  urlLink GROVER S .   A photojournalism blogger who recently discovered my blog.         His  urlLink stuff  is great!       CONFIDENTIAL TO EMMINEM   Shut the fuck up, you schmuck.  You're ruining my  MTV Video Music Awards -watching experience.  Actually, the over-abundance of hip-hop and rap artists already have.  The only highlight so far was Dave Navarro's guitar licks during Christina Aguilera's performance (and even that was lukewarm).  Unfortunately, I tuned in late and missed this:     Also, why the fuck is the "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy" cast on this show?  What do they have to do with music?  Boys: your little comedy piece is boring and stiff (pun intended).  And Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen?  !!!!???  It's so depressing yet I'm still watching, hoping this show will eventually redeem itself...  Whatever happened to the MTV of days of yore?  The clever MTV animations?  The early 1980's when MTV V.J.'s were icons?  Those sexy Duran Duran and Robert Palmer videos?  This is what passes for "music" these days?  For shame!!!!

       GROSSER THAN GROSS!!!!!!!   My favorite health food store offers an eclectic variety of frozen vegan delicacies.  For dinner, I selected this wonderful "Dal Bahaar" entrée (with tofu!):     The box boasted  "no artificial flavors, colors or preservatives" .     Furthermore, the side panel stated that the chef, Paul Jaggi,  "learned to make great tasting food by watching his grandmother and mother meticulously prepare fresh, delicious, and nutricious meals everyday - sifting grains, soaking lentils, chopping fresh vegetables and grinding fresh herbs and spices."      Yes, Chef Jaggi has stayed true to his family's culinary traditions by adhering to their age-old recipe which, not mentioned in the ingredients listing, includes a strand of his mother's HAIR (this photo doesn't do her hair justice... it's slightly wavy and a lovely shade of auburn.)  God, I am SO F*CKING GROSSED OUT!!!!!!

       WENDY GETS A JOB OFFER!      Do you like this photograph?  It's of the planter in front of my building but I can't identify the species (are they weeds?)  I finally received a job offer last Friday, after nearly six months of registering with temp agencies, taking their stupid typing tests, numerous phone screenings and interviews that led to nothing.   The company gave me the weekend to make a decision and wanted an answer by today, so I accepted as I had nothing else in the pipeline.  My start date is September 2nd.  Doesn't it just figure that the moment I accepted the job, I received calls from three outstanding Chicago-area firms interested in meeting with me?  I'll probably interview with them  urlLink surreptitiously  (I like this word), even though I'll just be starting my first week of work at the new place.  I guess I have to adopt the attitude of doing what's best for me -- God knows that employers will fire someone at the drop of the hat and nowadays, there is no loyalty in the workplace but I suffer from Jewish Guilt.  I don't want to burn any bridges nor bite the hand that feeds me, even if what I'm being fed is low in protein and the daily essential required nutrients for a 135-lb. adult.  The offer I received was $2K more than my last job paid me, and the benefits package is good.  My biggest concern is the corporate culture of this company... I wasn't able to assess that in the two brief interviews I had.  There's also the F.F. (the "Female Factor").  My two new bosses are women, and those of you reading this that are familiar with my history know that traditionally, I do not work well with other people who possess  urlLink XX chromosomes .  My friend L. told me not to focus too much on this because such thoughts tend to become self-fulfilling prophecies.  My previous, negative experiences working with other women have mainly been clashes with other administrative assistants.  Since these women will be my bosses, perhaps the dynamics will be more positive.  I'll try to keep an open mind.  Meanwhile, it wouldn't hurt to explore those other job opportunities, would it?  What do  you  think?

       EVERYONE KNOWS IT'S WENDY   Once upon a time, back in 1969 or so, I sat in my bedroom in  urlLink Cherry Hill, NJ  and watched an episode of the long-running children's television program, “ urlLink Sesame Street ”.  I recall a scene where a Muppet monster (Grover?) was flying about wearing a cape and singing the lyrics to  urlLink The Association  song “Windy”.  For years, my nickname was “Windy”  (among other, less-flattering names rhyming with my surname and "shoe", which I steadfastly refuse to disclose) .  When I moved to Chicago (the Windy City), it seemed appropriate that I call this site The Wendy City.  Of course, my more astute readers don’t need an explanation for my play on words.  However, lest you assume what you presume to be obvious, there is more to my blog title that meets the eye.  Today, one of my friends sent me the full lyrics to the song.  The second-to-last paragraph is quite ironic, so scroll down… way down… to learn why:    Who's peekin' out from under a stairway Calling a name that's lighter than air Who's bending down to give me a rainbow Everyone knows it's Windy  Who's tripping down the streets of the city Smilin' at everybody she sees Who's reachin' out to capture a moment Everyone knows it's Windy  And Windy has stor-my eyes That flash at the sound of lies And Windy has wings to fly Above the clouds (above the clouds) Above the clouds (above the clouds)   ------ flute ------   And Windy has stor-my eyes That flash at the sound of lies And Windy has wings to fly Above the clouds (above the clouds) Above the clouds (above the clouds)   Who's tripping down the streets of the city  Smilin' at everybody she sees Who's reachin' out to capture a moment Everyone knows it's Windy  [repeat and fade]     HAHAHAHAHA!  It's very apropos that the first sentence of the last paragraph of that song was:    "Who's tripping down the streets of the city"    …because I tripped over my own feet today while running and SPRAINED MY ANKLE!!!!!!!  God, I’m such a klutz.

       ATTENTION NBC MEDIA BUYERS   I was eating my supper at 6:30 p.m. while watching "Entertainment Tonight" when your commercial for the  urlLink Femring® Estrodial Vaginal Ring  came on.  The adjective "vaginal" was used five times in your 30-second spot, much to my disgust.  Bleeding, cramps and discharge were also mentioned.  I'm pretty sure I heard the nouns "uterus" and "intercourse", too.  Frankly, I am appalled at the liberal use of female anatomical references and bodily functions during prime time t.v. viewing hours.  Who is your target audience, someone's 8-year-old child who might be watching t.v. during dinner? (My parents absolutely  forbade  television during dinner in our home, and rightly so.)   "Mommy, what's vaginal discharge?  Mommy, why are you changing the channel?"

       CONFIDENTIAL TO A MALE "FRIEND"   I was joking when I said that I was in awe of the athleticism of women in strip clubs who are adept at pole dancing and wondered aloud if I would have the skill or stamina to attempt such gravity-defying feats.  Your response,  "Well, you don't look 25 anymore... you're a bit past your prime"  was incredibly insensitive.  I am NOT considering a dancing career, as you well know.  Besides, who the fuck ASKED you for your opinion???  You've claimed to understand "how women think" but I think you're full of crap.  At 37, you're no spring chicken yourself... you're skinny, you're nerdy, your nose job is obvious, and you're losing your hair!    Besides, 40 is the new 30, according to Demi Moore, who starred as a stripper in "Strip Tease" at the ripe "old age" of 34 (and hey, I'm not 40... yet!!)

       CELEBRITIES DROPPING LIKE FLIES  Even some minor celebrities like this guy       With the passing this week of  Johnny Cash  and  John Ritter  (and the sad death of my beloved  Warren Zevon  last weekend), I suddenly realized that there have been a lot of celebrity deaths this summer.  I found a  urlLink website with a list  of famous deaths in 2003 (I know, pretty morbid of me!)    One of the names on the list was an eccentric musician/artist from Chicago named   urlLink Wesley Willis  .  Anyone from Chicago who has spent time at our many clubs and venues going to see the fabulous local bands will be familiar with the big, black fella who frequently sat, catatonic on a chair before performing, drawing pictures of people in the audience.  Wesley once came up to me at the  urlLink Double Door  and, by way of a greeting, pulled my noggin close to his and gently head-butted me.  I was not scared...     His songs were made up on the spot -  bizarre, three-chord rants about trivial everyday items, music, and people he knew, as he accompanied himself on an electric keyboard.  He was a strange and wonderful character!    Wesley Willis   Wesley Willis (1963? - August 21, 2003) was a musician from Chicago, noted for his original songs.  Wesley Willis was 6 foot 5, weighed between 300 and 350 pounds, and likedto greet people with a headbutt.  Shortly after he made his first album, he was diagnosed with chronic paranoid schizophrenia, and he claimed to have "schizophrenia demons" in his head that took him off of his "harmony joy rides" to put him on "torture hell rides".   Willis, a longtime diagnosed schizophrenic, recorded over 50 albums during his career. A 6'5", 300 pound, mentally ill black man who made rock music was a rarity when he began his recording career in 1992. Willis was a tireless self promoter who went throughout Chicago selling his albums and his drawings. His well known songs include "Rock 'n Roll McDonalds", "Cut the Mullet", "Alanis Morissette", and "I Whupped Batman's Ass".   He died of complications from a June 2, 2003 emergency surgery to correct internal bleeding due to chronic myelogenous leukemia.  Just so that you can get an idea of Willis' lyrical genius, let's take a look at the words to one of his most popular songs, "Alanis Morissette":   You are a rockin' maniac. You are a singin' hyena. You are a rock star in Jesus' name. You can really rock Sadam Hussein's ass. You are so lovable to me in the long run. ALANIS MORISSETTE! ALANIS MORISSETTE! ALANIS MORISSETTE! ALANIS MORISSETTE!

       WELL,  EXCUUUUUSE  ME!   I had an unpleasant experience half an hour ago.  I went down the block to a national drugstore chain to purchase a bottle of wine and a Power Bar (I won't mention the name of this store but I guarantee there's more than one in your town).  I had a wallet full of loose change and a five dollar bill.  The girl who checked my purchases was unsmiling and uncommunicative (as usual... very few of the people who work at this store or the others in my neighborhood are very friendly).  She couldn't even be bothered to verbalize my total amount due and just pointed at the register display.  $10.01.  I gave her approximately $10.05 (a $5 bill and a lot of quarters, dimes and nickles), and she began counting my change.   Wendy:  (pointing at pile of money on counter)  "That's ten dollars and five cents."   Surly Checker:  (rolling eyes)  "I  know  how to count!"   Wendy:   " Excuse  me?  I was just trying to be helpful."   Surly Checker:  (no response, angry expression on her face.)  I was absolutely appalled at her abrupt comment and it really upset me more than I should have let it... the thing is, I had a similar response from another surly checker at the grocery store last Friday.  (This, after she yawned loudly with her mouth gaping open like a fish out of water, stretched her arms wide above her head, complaining (to no one in particular) how tired she was and how she couldn't wait to get off work.)  She was so busy yawning, stretching and complaining, in fact, that she barely noticed me handing my money to her!  Of course, I went straight to the manager and reported this to him.  He was equally appalled and assured me that he would speak to the checker.  He also mentioned that he's had complaints about this particular woman before and she's been written up five times!!  I don't know about you, but I can no longer be complacent about rudeness anymore.  It's so common these days that most people just ignore it but I cannot.  Everytime I walk out of a store in the Clark & Division corridor, I come away with a story.  I detest having to complain to management about one of their employees... I'd much prefer to write a letter commending someone for their excellent customer service but sadly, I've not written too many of those lately.  Oh well.  Such is life, I guess.   [And so is this...  urlLink Jake  is finally "off the market".   MAZEL TOV!! ]

       HIATUS UPDATE   Referring to previous post:  1) The interviews went splendidly.  I've been invited back for a third and final interview at the publishing firm tomorrow! 2) Called my old friend to tell him that our ship has sailed.  Before even finishing my sentence, my now ex-friend said, "Okay, whatever.  Bye!" and slammed the phone in my ear.  So much for a mature dialogue.  So much for seven years... 3) Had a nice one-hour long run this afternoon.  The marathon is on 10/12... I hope I'm up for it. 4) No prospects for Rosh Hashana.  I'll probably observe it with a t.v. dinner (a Kosher one). 5) I need to learn how to play poker before I crash the dogs' game!

Before I had a BLOG or a digital camera, I used the old Olympus OM-10 35mm camera which my father gave me in 1982 as a high school graduation present.  It's sustained numerous dents and water damage through my ineptitude but somehow it's managed to survive.  I love the convenience and instant gratification that my digital Canon Powershot affords me but there's nothing like the richness of black and white Kodak film!  These were taken one spring in 2000 on a boring Saturday afternoon.  I went out for a long walk and returned with these:    Kids from Cabrini Green Projects        Bark Worse than Bite        Hubbard Street Alley        Under the El Tracks      (p.s. I'm in the process of creating a PhotoBlog soley dedicated to my photography... stay tuned!)

       AN OBSERVATION     It appears that I get the majority of my reader comments when I post about pets or food.  I'm not the only one who's noticed this, even  urlLink Krystal  noted this on her site when she recently wrote about ice cream.  With that in mind, I give you this:      (I don't eat 'em, though, not even if they're Kosher... unless they're made with tofu.)

       ROSH HASHANA FOR DUMMIES   I didn't have any plans for Rosh Hashana this year, so it was a nice surprise when my friends Todd and Woody invited me to dine with them this evening at the Old Jerusalem restaurant in Chicago's Old Town.  My wonderful new friends were so excited to share their first Jewish holiday with me, their Token Jew!  Thing is, the Old Jerusalem is not run by Jews but by a Lebanese family.       Woody had rehearsed a traditional Hebrew toast for the occasion but promptly forgot it when our food arrived.  Don't look to me for enlightenment -- I may be Jewish but I know very little Hebrew beyond saying "L'shana Tova!" (happy new year!)  Still, it was a lovely evening, we met a very nice couple seated at the next table, and I left the restaurant, tummy bulging from too much tabouli, baba ganouche and felafel.      Upon returning home, I turned on the news to learn that the Chicago Cubs have won baseball's Central Divison pennant after a long double-header tonight.  I'm a Los Angeles Dodgers fan but I live in Chicago, so this one's for the Cubs Fans:      [The only blight on the evening was when Todd went outside to smoke a cigarette, an African-American woman approached him, asked, "Are you a Jew?" (which he is not) and when Todd replied, "Why does it matter?", answered, "You people are DIRTY!"  It was very weird.  I told Todd that she was obviously mentally unbalanced and to blow it off.]

       THEY NEVER LEAVE!   Late this summer, I wrote about Boris the Spider and the  urlLink infestation of her kin outside my window .  I was told by my building's manager that nothing could be done to erradicate this problem until the window washers arrived on October 7th.  So October 7th arrived and the window washers came on schedule.  This is Luis... I scared him, braless in a tank top and Old Navy boxer shorts with messy (but adorable!) "bed head" hair as much as he surprised me, hovering outside my window in his "USA" ball cap.  He nearly fell off his scaffold when I approached the window and gestured to the mass of cobwebs and spiders.     Watching the drama unfold from the apartment window below mine was this curious cat...      I thought that Luis had removed Boris and his clan.  I felt sort of sad when I returned later after going to the gym and discovered a cobwebless, unobstructed view of the street below.  I hoped that no lives were lost during the removal process... and then I continued on with my life, forgetting about the spider family.  That is, until this evening.  I opened my blinds and...

       WHY FLOSSING IS IMPORTANT   Holy crap!  I just woke up from a horrific nightmare.  I dreamt that my teeth were loose and began falling out, one by one (beginning with my back molars and working forward to my incisors.)  I should also note that my deceased father was in the dream.  He was a dentist.  Uccch.  My heart is still pounding.  What a relief to wake up and realize that I still have my chompers!  Any armchair analysts out there care to expound on the meaning of this dream?  I've had it before.  (On a lighter note,  urlLink this post on Excursus!  had me practically peeing my pants!)

       GOVERNOR SHWARZENEGGER    I suppose, being a Californian (I moved to Chicago in 1995 and am currently making plans to move back home), I should have an opinion on this.  I don't.  I get my news from "Access Hollywood" and "Entertainment Tonight" (well, that's not exactly true but not that far from it).  I think I need some other sources to have a truly informed stance.  It is bizarre, though!

       MEN BEHAVING BADLY       At 5:00 p.m. tonight, a major blaze broke out in a downtown Chicago highrise.  It's a government building (the Cook County Administration building) so naturally, the local evening news has devoted its entire coverage to this event.  It's a 4-alarm fire.  At first, as I watched the breaking new footage with my neighbors T & W, it seemed that the fire was contained to one floor.  It's now 7:42 p.m. and after going to the grocery store (I smelled smoke in the air and noticed an ambulance rushing south on Dearborn Street), I've just turned on my television and all of the stations are still broadcasting this story.  Apparently people are missing and others have been overcome by smoke in the stairwells. Over 15 ambulances have arrived on the scene.  Oh, this is really bad.  They've just reported that our State's Attorney, Dick Devine, tried to escape the fire but got trapped in a stairwell with some of his employees.  Just moments ago, Channel 7 had a phone call from a person who apparently was in the building.  Anchorwoman:   "Casey, can you tell us what you saw?"   Casey:  "Well, I, um, I was visiting a friend at his office but he wasn't there.  There was a lot of smoke and people were, uh, running down the stairs, and (breathing heavily) I was totally scared.  I'm still freaked out by it and, um..."   Anchorwoman:   "Casey, what company does your friend work for?"   Casey:  "Uh, Bear Sterns... I mean,  HOWARD STERN ROCKS!!!!!"  *   [*Note for international readers: Howard Stern is a radio "shock jock" and a hero to immature frat boys everywhere.]   Anchorwoman:  "Yeah, that's what I thought."   She went on to chastise "Casey" for being insensitive when peoples' lives are at stake and their friends and families are watching the news to get information on their loved ones who might have been in this fire.  After-hours cleaning people who don't speak English and didn't understand the evacuation announcements!  What a fucking idiot.  Even Howard Stern would not find this funny.  This clever fellow, this hilarious prankster (and really, making a prank phone call to a news station is SO original) -- I wonder if he was at the last Cubs game, throwing beer at poor Steve Bartman?  I'll bet he was.  Yes, indeed.  I hope that Channel 7 tracks "Casey's" call and puts him on the news tomorrow.  He should be ostracized the way Bartman was!   UPATE (10:00 p.m.)  - Six people lost their lives in this fire.  I hope "Casey" feels remorse but somehow I doubt it.

       CUBS RELEASE STATEMENT ON FAN          October 16, 2003, 2:42 PM CDT  The Chicago Cubs' organization Thursday released the following statement:    "The Chicago Cubs would like to thank our fans for their tremendous outpouring of support this year. We are very grateful.  "We would also like to remind everyone that games are decided by what happens on the playing field -- not in the stands. It is inaccurate and unfair to suggest that an individual fan is responsible for the events that transpired in Game 6. He did what every fan who comes to the ballpark tries to do -- catch a foul ball in the stands. That's one of the things that makes baseball the special sport that it is.  "This was an exciting season and we're looking forward to working towards an extended run of October baseball at Wrigley Field."    [P.S. - My second thought about this incident, after my first one which was "how appalling!", was that I'll bet there'll be a t.v. movie about this.  Sure enough, on the news just moments ago, "Coming up at 10... a Hollywood film company wants to make a film about the Chicago Cubs Curse fan."]

        Please .  I don't want to hear any more about the  Chicago Cubs Curse  .    Frankly, that's a bunch of ca-ca.    Poor Steve Whateverhisnameis who caught the ball in the stands at last night's game (My God, it's not like he ran over a small child while driving drunk!)  His picture's all over the world's newspapers and the television newscrews just broadcast a live feed from outside his house (with a police car outside for protection).    Responsible journalism at its finest.

       HERE I COME TO SAVE THE DAY!      I've always rooted for the underdog.  This explains why I am currently watching the  urlLink Chicago Cubs  battle the Florida Marlins at Wrigley Field.  If the Cubs win tonight, they will advance to the World Series for the first time since the Ice Age.  (There's a t.v. commercial on right now so I'm taking a break to type this).  When I was at Arizona State University, I was one of two women's cross country "walk-ons" chosen to train with the team.  I had never run more than four miles in my life, and I'd never run in a race but still I showed up at each and every practice.  So what if I sucked?  After training with the team for four months, I ran my first marathon.  I was an Underdog.  No one thought my dyslexic friend M. would ever amount to much but today, he's a successful doctor.  M. was an Underdog.  I hope that tonight, the Cubs become the Overdog!  (Besides, there hasn't been a decent riot in Chicago since the Democratic National Convention in '68.)

       MONDAY IN THE WENDYCITY   Today was Columbus day.  I celebrated by sleeping in 'til 10:00 a.m.  Then I rushed down to my mailbox in anticipation of receiving the latest issue of "Vanity Fair", which is the only magazine I subscribe to.  I was disappointed that there was no mail delivery because of this "holiday".  What is  urlLink Columbus Day  and why is it so important that it would interrupt mail delivery?  Frankly, I don't give a damn.  All I wanted was my "Vanity Fair" magazine!  On a more serious note, I've had another disturbing dream.  I've been offered a position at a major media company (the one which happens to own the Chicago Cubs baseball team!).  I have been interviewing with this company all summer and after four meetings, they have offered the job to me but on a temp-to-perm basis for 60 days.  I'm very nervous about this because this means no benefits, no 401K savings plan, and no free Cubs tickets.  Not to mention the fact that there is no guarantee that this job will be offered to me on a permanent basis after two months.  So last night (or early this morning, as I didn't go to bed until 2:00 a.m.), I had a dream that on my first day of work, I was shown to my new cubicle and discovered that I would be sharing it with two other administrative assistants.  The horror!!!!  In my dream, these two idiots chit-chatted for most of the day, told me about their boyfriend dilemmas, discussed the latest episode of The Bachelor, and when one was away from her desk, the other made disparaging remarks about her.  Not unlike each and every job I've held previously where I was forced to work in a group of secretaries.  This dream was more frightening that the one I had about my teeth falling out several nights ago.  I have never been so thankful to wake up in the morning and realize that it was just my subconcious "acting out".  I wonder what I'll dream about tonight?

       THE BLANK GENERATION     Osco Drug Store, Chicago, Illinois - 5:30 p.m. CST    I stopped by to pick up some wine for a dinner party tonight with my neighbors T & W (turkey chili and garlic bread were on the menu, along with a DVD rental of " urlLink A Mighty Wind ".)  I took my bottle to the cashier and she rang it up, with a vacuous, disinterested look.  Cashier:  [blank stare] Wendy: [blank stare] Cashier: (mumbles unintelligibly with a blank stare) Wendy: [blank stare] Cashier: (briefly makes eye contact but says nothing) Wendy:  "How much do I owe you?"  Cashier: (points at electronic cash register display) Wendy:  "What?"  Cashier:  "Eight dollars and two cent"  (she said  "cent",  not "cents"!) Wendy: (silently handing over my cash) Cashier: (mumbling)  "Thankyouandhaveaniceday."  Wendy: [blank stare]    After consuming aforementioned bottle of wine... nice pigtails!

       CLUTZY IS AS CLUTZY DOES   Last night, climbing into bed, I lost my balance and fell onto my night table.  This  used  to be my rice-paper reading lamp (bought at Pier 1 Imports in 1996):     Ah, so sad!  That lamp has illuminated many a night-time read, most recently "The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay", "The DaVinci Code" and the lastest issue of "Vanity Fair" magazine.  I guess it's off to Pier 1 for a new $20 lamp.   GWYNETH HAS SOME EXPLAINING TO DO:

       NOT INTO HALLOWEEN BUT...   I'm not a big fan of Halloween.  I never liked all of the candy-eating, or the pressure to come up with an elaborate and creative costume.  However, I do enjoy watching others observe this throwaway "holiday".  If I was to dress up this year, I suppose I would have costumed myself as Kelly Osborne because I'm feeling kind of bloated right now.  Last night while walking home from work, I happened to notice that the proprietor of a local restaurant decided to dress up his establishment for the occasion.  It was already dark out when I happened upon Biggs Steakhouse.  I was drawn by the colorful lights that illuminated the old mansion, and the fairy lights strung on the branches of the grand old oak tree that graces the front of the property.  I stood on the corner across the street and began snapping pictures (with my digital camera which I always have with me at all times.)    Suddenly, I heard a voice say, "So, how did the picture come out?"  I turned around and standing beside me was a shaggy-haired, craggy-faced man a handful of years older than I am.  "I don't know, I haven't looked at them yet."  I was a bit annoyed because I was in one of my "moods" and didn't feel much like conversing with anyone.  I'll admit that I was rather abrupt.  The man continued to stand there while I took a few more photos, and I looked sideways at him in annoyance. I really just wanted to be alone and take my pictures.  I realized that I was being rude and asked, "Is that your restaurant?"  He said that indeed it was, and that he'd just bought Biggs last year.  "We began dressing it up today but we have more coffins arriving tomorrow in time for our Halloween party.  My name is Louis."  (Coffins?) He stuck out his hand and I shook it.     Wendy: "Pleasure to meet you, Louis."  Louis:  "Do you live in the neighborhood?"  Wendy: "Yes.  I've lived here for four years but I've never been to your restaurant."  Louis: "Well, you should really stop by some time.  We have a wonderful wine cellar in the basement, a steakhouse on the second floor, and a hip-hop club on the third.  Come by and ask for me... I'm here 24-seven."  Wendy:  "Why thank you, Louis.  I certainly will!"  Louis gave me his business card with his email address.  I sent him the pictures I took last night.  It's always nice to make contact with the proprietor of an upscale restaurant.  Who knows what "perks" I may receive!

       SAGA OF THE POINTY-TOED, SLINGBACK KITTEN-HEELED SHOES WITH A BOW   Yesterday, I wrote about my walk home from work in my fabulous but unpractical pointy-toed  urlLink Martinez Valero  shoes  (my "fancy-schmancy" shoes, as my Aunt Helen called them) .  After half an hour of slipping and sliding across the sidewalk in the rain and wind with a broken umbrella (did I mention my broken umbrella?) I finally gave up and waited for a bus (and then slipped and slided and fell on some wet leaves walking home from the market).  Guess what?  I think the second-to-last toe on my left foot is broken!  A clutzy woman lost her balance and stepped right on my foot with her equally pointy-toed spiked heel.  It didn't really hurt that bad when it happened (which is why I forgot to post about it last night) but this morning at 5:30 a.m. I awoke to an aching foot.  I just took my shoe off a moment ago because it's still throbbing... my little piggy is PURPLE and has a  urlLink HEMATOMA .  A verifiable  urlLink CONTUSION !  Someone dial 911!  Dear God, I think my poor toe is broken!  I'm going to have to wear my sneakers to work tomorrow - the horror!  They will certainly clash with my brown, suede 3/4-length skirt.  I have an image to maintain, after all.  (I was going to wear these boots...)      For those of you who wrote asking for pictures of my "cruel shoes", I give you these (taken from eight different perspectives).  Notice how RUINED the bottoms are!        Toe Jam :  I am NOT a hypochondriac -- witness for yourself my injured fourth toe middle phalanx!      [For more information on the Foot skeletal structure, go  urlLink here .]

       OCTOBER IN CHICAGO, IL  Walking home from work...     Division Street Brownstones, Division Street Pumpkins      Chicagoans in my neighborhood go all-out during the Autumn and Winter months.  I am fortunate to be residing in an area with beautiful, historic old brownstone buildings built circa the late 1800's.  The current owners of these architectural masterpieces do justice to their abodes by showcasing them during the holidays.  Just wait until Christmas for the pictures I'll have to share with you!  October in Chicago is one of the most beautiful months of the year.  An explosion of color... leaves turning lustrous shades of crimson, gold and sienna, floating downward to land softly in a pile of an amalgomated, burnished palette of color  (then turning into a sloppy mess of slime upon the first downpour of rain, conspiring to make me slip and slide and fall on my ass with three bags of heavy groceries.  You know you will, you fucking LEAVES).   Two weeks of Autumnal bliss and then it's absolute CRAP for the next eight months!

       CHEAPER THAN THERAPY      For some reason, I feel compelled to share my deepest and darkest secrets with you, my invisible friend.  (I hope you don't think I'm coming on too strong!)  I know this is only our second cyber date but... you know, I've never met anyone like you before. Usually when I meet someone new I feel awkward and shy but with you it's different. I can talk to you. You know what I'm thinking without my having to explain to you in fancy terms. We speak each other's unspoken language... fluently.  I love you.   09•  I have a huge stash of soy sauce packets in my pencil drawer from Chinese take-out lunches.   10•  On weekends, you can find me at the market eating those free samples.      One of the women I work with just got married last week.  She's Indian and I'm told her wedding was very traditional.  One of our other co-workers was one of her maids of honor and showed me the fading henna designs which were painstakingly painted on her palms.  I wonder if it tickled?   ARGUING ON THE INTERNET IS LIKE RUNNING IN THE SPECIAL OLYMPICS    urlLink This  is for all those retards who post to the Yahoo message boards at the end of news articles and deviate from the topic, getting into pissing contests and making racist remarks.

       SENSE & SENSIBILITY   The Intercontinental hotel, shot from my 19th floor office window       I was walking to work this morning with my digital camera, as always, in my pocket.  It was a sunny day today and all the fall colors jumped out at me as I strode up the sidewalk through piles of fallen leaves.  I thought to myself,  "Self, if you had to give up one sense which one would it be?"   I decided that it was a toss-up between sight and sound.  The sense of taste I can do without.  Smell, too.  But to never again hear music, that would be a loss... and to no longer be able to see, well, I don't know what I'd do.  I'm very visual (as you can see from the photos I've posted).  If I could no longer take photos, I'd lose a very important creative outlet.  So what about you?  What sense(s) would you do without?   A FEW MORE THINGS ABOUT ME...   (I wrote this in an email to a new visitor to my BLOG and thought I'd share it with you... not that you asked or even care)  01•  I live in the Gold Coast area of downtown Chicago, near Clark & Division and the old Playboy Mansion on State Street (stalkers, take note!.)  Just got a temp to perm job at the Chicago Tribune three weeks ago.  The job (as an executive assistant) is good but I long to do something more cognitive with my life.  I'm highly intelligent and am not using my brain.   02•  I moved here from L.A. in July '95 but am originally from New Jersey. My accent is more "Philadelphia" than "New Joisey".   03•  I'm Jewish but not religious (but I love my heritage and feel that I'm entitled to make a Jewish joke now and then because I can).  04•  I like to run and jump and play but I haven't done much of that lately because I'm in a funk.  05•  I love photography and bought a digital camera in March.  Most of my posts begin with my photos and a brief commentary.  06•  I like pretzels dipped in mustard, and hot-air pop corn with soy sauce sprinkled on top.  I eat tofu raw from the container and enjoy it. 07•  I'll turn 40 (!!!) in December (the month I hate the most, with all of the chocolate-eating and Christmas muzak played over store loudspeakers, but I'm routinely told that I look (and act) much younger. Archived photos of me on my blog are subject to opinion (or derision).  08•  I'm a dog person but have an affinity for all of God's creatures... except for the General Public.

      I am gagging right now... our mailroom guy stopped by and he apparently DOUSED himself with cheap cologne today.  I hate, hate, HATE when men wear cologne to the office!  Who is he trying to impress?  30 minutes later... the scent still lingers.  I'm in respiratory distress!

       A FISTFUL OF FIDGETERS   Walking to the bus stop this morning...       I asked the woman walking this dog quad if I could take their photo.  She reluctantly agreed but only if I didn't get her in the picture.  (No problem there as this eccentric gal was wearing purple tights, a knee-length black corderouy "skort" and something orange that I couldn't identify - definitely a fashion "don't"!)  The dogs were so hyper and squirmy that this is all I was able to capture.  I'd love to have a dog but I live in a small apartment.  Still, I live vicariously through the dog-owners I meet in my neighborhood (like  urlLink Jodi  does).   urlLink Cas  has taken her love for canines one step farther and actually  urlLink FOSTERS  pups at her home in Houston!  She is a real do-gooder and my hat's off to her (tomorrow, it's supposed to be freezing in Chicago so I will be wearing my first hat of the season.  I'll take it off to Cas when I get to my office.)  Your mission today: pet as many dogs (and cats!) as you can while you're out and about!   (p.s. - If you live in the Chicagoland area and are considering getting a kitty or a dog, please save a life and visit  urlLink The Anti-Cruelty Society  at 510 N. LaSalle - (312) 644-8338 - it's a "no kill" shelter)

       TUESDAY IN THE WENDY CITY: (Lots of pictures to post today!)   Today's Lunch Special:          Important fire drill at my firm this morning.  A tragic fire in a downtown highrise three weeks ago where six lives were lost has motivated the city of Chicago to review its fire codes and implement stricter evacuation practices.  Today's drill was interesting because the entire Tribune Tower was evacuated and I got to see the diverse people who are employed there.  The stairwells were narrower than I'd expected and it took a full 10 minutes to go down 22 stories to the plaza.  If there had been a fire, it would have been very scary.    It's a bird!  It's a plane!  It's... what the hell  IS  it, anyway?       I caught a blur out of the corner of my eye as something sped by me on the sidewalk... I've never seen a Segway "in person" before.   (What you don't see in this photo is the cell phone this man was cheerfully chatting on as he rolled by!)   Ah, modern technology.    If I had a patio it would look like this

       SUMMER SCENE         This is a story about  urlLink Billy Joe and Bobbie Sue  Two young lovers with nothin' better to do Than sit around the house, get high, and watch the tube   I took these photos at an outdoor Sheryl Crow concert on July 5th.  I don't know this couple but they looked like All-American Badasses (Kid Rock, anyone?  Steve McQueen?).  I just found it on my hard drive tonight and it made me think of those recently-departed, hot and muggy summer days.  It's bitterly cold here in Chicago - 42 degrees F (although for this ex-Californian, anything under 65 degrees is freezing).     Time to break out the toe socks!      If I'm a bit cranky for the next eight months, blame it on the weather, or Blame it on Rio... I wish I was there instead of here!     IGNORANCE IS BLISS  Confidential to...   • the apathetic, disinterested counter clerk at Osco who told me that my purchases totaled $10.88 and while I was counting out my money, walked away to check the photo processing machine on the other side of the store while I stood there waiting for my change…  • the clerk at Walgreen’s who was so involved in her phone conversation with her boyfriend that she didn’t notice the long line of customers seeking her attention…  • the unsanitary (and unsavory-looking) stock man at the grocery store with a cold who coughed and sneezed, wiped his nose with the back of his un-gloved hand and then touched the container of hummus I was about to put into my cart…  I’ve turned over a new leaf.  I’ve become one of the masses who are so used to this kind of ignorance and poor customer service that I’ve begun to expect it.  I give up!  You win.  It's true what "they" say... ignorance IS bliss!

       BLOG... A FOUR-LETTER WORD?  WELL BLOG  THIS !   (Whispering)  "Pssst!  I'm sitting next to  Abraham Lincoln  ... I'll post about this later on my BLOG!"        How many of you feel that others' referring to your weblog as a  BLOG  is offensive?  Would you prefer having it called a "site"?  It seems that some people have a visceral reaction to the noun "blog".  I recently was the recipient of a very hostile and vehement missive from a reader who lambasted me for using this term.  Not sure why... it's a WebBLOG, after all.  Ah, fuck it... I'm not about to censor myself, on my BLOG or in person.  If you don't like what I have to say, don't read me.

       MONEY MAKES THE WORLD GO AROUND   I'm sitting here, in utter and absolute fascination, watching the 1972 film " urlLink Cabaret " on cable t.v. (Liza Minelli, Joel Gray, Michael York).  I've never seen it in its entirety until now.    Always an admirer of all things Bob Fosse, I'm marvelling at how his directing and choreography transcends the years... the finger-snapping, the disjointed, herky-jerky, hip-thrusting...  The dance and song numbers in "Cabaret" don't seem dated at all.  Liza, to her credit, was a hot number back in '72.  Who knew she'd become the bloated, drunken, David-Guest-beating freakshow she is now?  Damn!  (One of my two other favorite Fosse-inspired films are "Sweet Charity" and " urlLink All That Jazz ", starring the outstanding Roy Scheider as Bob in this adaptation of Fosse's career.)

       A CONFEDERACY OF DUNCES    "When a true genius appears, you can know him by this sign: that all the dunces are in a confederacy against him." - Jonathan Swift    On the bus ride to work:  One (1) driver who closed the doors on my right heel as I boarded and began accelerating as I nearly fell on the steps, before I even put my $1.50 in the meter.  I guess the driver doesn't't believe in "safety first", and the heel of my favorite Kenneth Cole slide is scuffed (the horror!)  Six (6) Burberry sightings (hats, scarves, purses, umbrellas, etc.).     Three (3) men reading "The DaVinci Code".     One (1) fat guy wearing a Member's Only jacket (with a comb-over) who undiplomatically tried to push past me with his flabby belly on the crowded bus this morning.  "You're in the aisle", he growled.   (How very observant of him.) "Well, you're fat !" I retorted.  (I know... I'm so mature!)     Three (3) senior citizens forced to stand while eight (8) 20-somethings sat in the handicapped seats, comatose.  (I suggested that someone give up their seat and thankfully, a few did... but why do  I  have to be the voice of reason?)     Jogging home from the office:  One (1) middle-aged man with huge glasses behind the wheel of a late-model Toyota Corolla making a left-hand turn from the opposite side of the road, who tried to beat me through the intersection as I jogged through (on the green "Walk" light, no less), and came 6 inches from hitting me, then gave me the finger!  He won't soon forget the beating I gave the side of his door with my Saucony-clad running shoe.  Two (2) jaywalkers who chose the opportune moment to run across the road... directly in front of speeding cabs (one jaywalker dragged a small child across the street with her!)  One (1) lady of "a certain age" who was slowly walking (weaving) on the sidewalk tonight (in the dark) with an open purse dangling from one arm and a cell phone held up to her ear with the other, in a mink coat and stiletto-heeled boots.  I tried to pass her on the left, she wove to the left.  Tried to pass her on the right, she drifted to the right.  Finally, I said, "Excuse me!"  She was startled, and yelped and squealed like a stuck pig.  I guess she thought I was a mugger.  She certainly would have made a great target.  Then she yelled something in anger at me as I jogged past her.  I turned around and stated, "That's why women should always be aware of their surroundings, m'am.  You never know who might come up from behind you."  I don't think she appreciated my sage advice (and I'm certain it didn't register, either).  News bulletin: People are idiots.

       (NOTHING BUT) FLOWERS   Two months ago, this old Victorian building once stood proudly on the corner of State and Division Streets in Chicago...     But pan down....... Now it's being razed and a national drug store chain raised in its place. (*sigh*)       This is so absurd because we already have an  urlLink Osco Drugs  and a  urlLink Walgreen's  drugstore on opposing corners just one block West!!  Why does this neighborhood need a third national retail pharmacy chain??   If only things could be the opposite... demolishing all of the sterile banks and generic Starbuck's, and planting gardens and parks in their place!    There was a shopping mall Now it's all covered with flowers you've got it, you've got it  This was a Pizza Hut Now it's all covered with daisies you got it, you got it  This was a discount store, Now it's turned into a cornfield you got it, you got it   - Talking Heads, "(Nothing But) Flowers"   I went back to Ohio But my pretty countryside Had been paved down the middle By a government that had no pride The farms of Ohio Had been replaced by shopping malls And muzak filled the air    - Pretenders, "My City Was Gone"

       WHAT'S A GIRL TO DO   when she learns that her ex-boyfriend, the love of her life, is planning to propose to someone   else   on the first day of Hannuka (which is also her birthday, thereby tainting it)?  Go shopping!  Now, I'm an atypical female... I really detest shopping unless it's something I really need (like home furnishings and a new toilet seat lid).  I was (and still am) feeling so blue that I needed something to cheer me up.  I walked home from work in the bitter cold, pissed off and sad and that's when I happened upon a window display with this purse:     Now, lest you think I was being frivilous, I should mention that I purchased this red "pleather"  urlLink Matt & Nat Montreal  beauty with an American Express "points" voucher that my old boss gave me last year as a holiday gift.  I've kept it for 12 months, waiting for something interesting to buy.  I wonder how long a new purse will keep my heartache at bay... yeah, it's roomy enough to hold my wallet, hairbrush, makeup bag, daytimer, digital camera, *and* my ripped-out, bleeding heart (pleather is water and bloodstain-proof).  I feel that I've made a wise choice.

       ONLY NINE MORE SHOPPING DAYS LEFT   Until my birthday!!  Woo hoo!!  I would like a cat.  There, I said it!  That would certainly complete my image as a  (cough, spit, pa-tooey!!)  40-year-old spinster.  No, make that THREE cats... and a plastic rain bonnet, like my Grandmom used to make me wear when I was six  ("bouffant cape back keeps hairdo fresh!) , 'cause that's what all the fashionable spinsters are wearing these days.  It's so retro!     urlLink     Oh gosh, while you're at it, please include the matching Clear Bubble Umbrella to complete my ensemble.  Thanks in advance!   urlLink      SOY UN PERDEDOR... I'M A LOSER BABY, SO WHY DON'T YOU KILL ME?   At the urging of my mother and my friend S., I registered on  urlLink eHarmony , an on-line dating service which touts its Compatibility Matching System™ (using complicated algorithms and Six Sigma metrics to identify all the other standard deviants in  el todo mundo  who are supposed good matches for me.)  30 minutes of answering "true/false", "yes/no" and "on a scale of 1-10" multiple-choice questions later, the search engine generated this message:    Unable to Match You at This Time    eHarmony is based upon a complex matching system developed through extensive testing of married individuals. One of the requirements for it to work successfully is for participants to fall into our rigorously defined profiles. If we aren't able to match a user well using these profiles, the most considerate approach is to inform them early in the process.  We are so convinced of the importance of creating compatible matches to help people establish and enjoy happy, lasting relationships that we choose not to provide service rather than risk an uncertain match.  Unfortunately, we are not able to make our profiles work for you. Our matching system is not suitable for about 20% of potential users, so 1 in 5 people simply would not benefit from our service. We hope that you understand that we regret our inability to provide service for you at this time.    Wait... did I read that right?  There isn't ONE single match for me?  Ohmigod, at the rate things have been going, I'm gonna die, alone and unloved in this crappy studio apartment with 10 cats!  (Cats pending...)

       IF CALIFORNIA SHOULD FALL INTO THE OCEAN... (Homesick for Cali)   8 Years, 5 Months and 11 days       My current email address is LAX2ORD1995@yahoo.com (the airport codes for Los Angeles and O'Hare, and the year I moved to Chicago).  My email address prior to moving to Chicago was WendyWood@yahoo.com.  I want to change it back.  I miss the old days, sitting in the sand on Zuma beach, smoking a joint with my old friend  urlLink Alex M. , watching the seagulls dive for fish and watching the sun set in the West over the Pacific.  Or sneaking up to the roof of the old Art Deco apartment building I used to have in West Hollywood with my comedian friend  urlLink Chris , drinking beers, gazing at the Hollywood sign looming above us in the smog ( "It's right  there , Chris! I feel like I could reach out and touch it ... let's go sneak up there and climb onto it this weekend!" ).  Talking about Chris's making it big someday as a comedic actor, the bit he wrote and sold to Dennis Miller for his HBO show; the screenplay he'd been writing for 2 years, and would I eventually get that marketing job with Ticketmaster I'd been interviewing for?  (I did but it only lasted for six months and was overrated, despite the free front row tickets for REM, U2, Bowie and Rusted Root.)   About everything and nothing, then closing our eyes and willing ourselves to get a tan in half an hour on that unstable rooftop overlooking the Sunset Strip and the Chateau Marmont, where John Belushi overdosed in 1979.  Before I got it into my head that leaving California for Illinois would be a good move to make because I really wanted to marry a nice Jewish boy, and the Jewish boys in Hollywood were either assholes or gay (I lived in West Hollywood, after all, the largest gay community outside of Greenwich Village or San Francisco).  It's 2003 going on 2004 and I'm still unmarried but all of my ex-boyfriends are.  During the whole O.J. Simpson murder trial, my friend Julie S. used to come over to my apartment on Friday nights, bearing cheap merlot.  She lived 1/2 a block away from the murder scene and grew tired of the t.v. station news helicopters hovering above her street, the tourists who camped out in front of O.J.'s ex-wife's condo at the end of the street expecting to see the long-since removed bodies, and the LAPD motorcycle cops stationed there, asking for Julie's identification each night as she attempted to turn right onto her street and into her driveway.  I still have an old videotape I took of Julie, arriving at my apartment with an unopened but soon to be consumed wine bottle ... and I remember the night we went to see the Cirque de Soleil in Santa Monica in a big tent on the beach ... a few hours of stunning make-believe in order to remove ourselves from the reality we were living that was so unreal that no one outside of Los Angeles would ever believe it was actually occurring in our hometown, the City of Angels.  I want to go back in time, to California circa June of 1995... before Jerry Garcia died and the Grateful Dead disbanded, and I'd never again take another road trip with my Deadhead friends up to San Francisco to delight in that scene.  Before I flew to O'Hare, thinking (naively) that something better awaited me in Chicago (arriving here in the midst of an oppressive heat wave that killed nearly 300 souls, then a winter where my nostril hairs froze the moment I stepped outside).  Before I'd had one last meal at Sushi on Sunset Blvd. and savored their specialty, spicy tuna rolls as fat as the joint I wished I'd smoked with  urlLink Alex  on Zuma Beach but never did.  Jesus, I hate this cold weather and oppressive gloom!    I don't care about the seismographic  urlLink Richter Scale  (my family and I survived a  urlLink major earthquake in '94  and my grandparents, living in a small apartment in Northridge, the epicenter, managed to keep a sense of humor even though their home was demolished) or the prediction of California someday falling into the ocean... by the sea is where I want to be.  RIGHT NOW.  But ... is it true what they say, that you can never truly go home?  What *is* "home", anyhow?  Where the heart is?     ARTIST · Grateful Dead TITLE · Estimated Prophet  ALBUM · Terrapin Station (1977)     California, preaching on the burning shore California, I’ll be knocking on the golden door Like an angel, standing in a shaft of light Rising up to paradise, I know I’m gonna shine.  Don’t worry about me, no no no, don’t worry about me, no And I’m in no hurry, no no no, I know where to go.  Standin’ on the beach, the sea will part before me.

       WHAT I DID ON MY BIRTHDAY   11:00am CST: I kicked off my special day with a trip to one of my favorite places, the  urlLink Illinois Department of Economic Security .  My friends  T  and  W  accompanied me, doubling my pleasure  and  my fun!   I don't think it was what  T  expected and he pouted once we'd arrived, even more so when he ran out of cigarettes.   (T wants me to mention that we rode to the IDES in style, in W's Land Rover with seat warmers, and that if my claim is rejected, I will be declared a ward of the State of Illinois.  If all else fails, I'll just live in T's Land Rover...  urlLink Truckin', like the Doo-dah Man ...)       2:00pm CST: Had a huge and unsavory lunch at a local diner.  Terrible food but still we cleaned our plates.  Then back home for a two-hour nap.  7:45pm CST: Over to  T  and  W 's apartment to light the menorah.  Our friend  J  joined us and being the only two Jews in the room, stumbled through the obligatory prayers.   "Baruch hatah adonai, mmm mmm mmm, mmm mmm mm mmm mmmmmm... something, something, Hannuka!"      8:30pm CST: Pre-dinner margueritas at  urlLink Nacional 27 .     9:00pm CST: The waitress introduced herself.  I immediately let her know that this was my birthday dinner (hoping for a free birthday chocolate souffle or cake).  I joked that every time I've gone out for dinner on my birthday, there were always at least two other birthday girls in the house.  Suddenly, the couple at the next table began laughing...  Vickie and David , celebrating Vickie's 28th birthday.  Stealing my thunder!  (Actually, they were very cool and hung with us for awhile.)     My dates:     And finally, my birthday creme brulee!  Burp!

I think you should  I guess the winter makes you laugh a little slower, Makes you talk a little lower about the things you could not show her And it's been a long December and there's reason to believe Maybe this year will be better than the last  I can't remember all the times I tried to tell my myself To hold on to these moments as they pass And it's one more day up in the canyon And it's one more night in Hollywood  It's been so long since I've seen the ocean...

       THE LAST NIGHT OF MY 30'S   I just learned that  urlLink Brad Pitt  turned 40 today.  Now I'm really feeling old!  I'm still younger than Brad, though, so that's something... but I also learned that  urlLink Jennifer Beals  and I will both turn 40 tomorrow.  I'm pretty confident that both of us aren't too old to Flashdance.  Tomorrow, I have a  big adventure  planned at 11:00am.  Stay tuned for details!

       KISS MY GRITS AND EAT MY DUST!   After agreeing to work until Friday at the Tribune (because I need the money and they won't pay me through the end of the week), I arrived at my ex-office at 8:45am (I was fifteen minutes late but I didn't care at this point; I no longer had a job to save).  The elevator doors opened and I entered my ex-suite through the opposite entrance from where my ex-cubicle is so I could just sneak to my ex-desk and not have to pass my ex-boss’s office.   Who do I immediately see stomping (or should I say "thundering"?) down the hall but “Queen Bee” (the bossy Black lady).  Obviously QB didn't give a damn about my being terminated right before the holidays and my birthday - she is as phony as 90% of everyone I've ever met in Corporate America, esp. WOMEN.  Oh, she talked a good game (when she wasn't in a bitchy mood and barking at people, or generally being disruptive with her loud mouth), and her cubicle was a showroom of virtually every bit of inspirational Christian knick-knack, artifact, give-Satan-a-whack dreck one could possibly dream of.  Yes, a charitable woman, that QB.  She even said she’d bake me a cake!   I never did get the chance to play a joke on her, the one J. suggested, where I would sneak in early before QB arrived and turn the fifteen Angel figurines that populated her filing cabinets backward, facing the wall.  Oh, how I would have rejoiced in her loud shrieks!  (Hallelujah!)    "He was looking for you,"  she said abruptly in a warning tone.    "Oh. I'm sure he was,"  I replied with sarcasm.  (K. was actually looking for me?  That would be a first... perhaps he'd even make eye contact with me, which would have been another first.)   All of the sudden I was overcome with the urge to turn on my heel and leave.   So I did! (leaving QB eating my dust.)   I immediately went to the HR department and wrote a note to L., the sweetheart who'd been my advocate in getting a job at the Tribune.  I wrote her a note explaining that after thinking about things, I am far too uncomfortable to continue working for K., if even for three more days.  I mean, the asshole never even gave me any reason for my dismissal... he made HR do it and even  they  didn't know exactly why!  I called L. when I got home and she said,  "I don't blame you."   She said that when she called K's office to tell him, QB answered and said,  "She gone?"   L. said it wasn't the kind of tone where she sounded sorry at all.   "Yeah,"  I replied.   "She's probably just pissed because now she'll have to make all of his travel arrangements."    I hope that I'm never again in a position where I have to humble myself and work for someone who doesn't want me there, if even for a minute or a day, just because I need the income.  It was so humiliating... I would even have had to escort job candidates to K's office!

       THE ANSWER:  "IT IS DECIDEDLY SO"   An early Birthday-slash-Hannuka present:      A pink slip from my "new" employer!  I was not even given the courtesy of an explanation.  Got summoned to the Human Resources this morning at 9:30 and was told that my 60-day temp-to-perm period has now ended and I will  not  be hired as a permanent employee.  The HR lady didn't even know why!  She did inform me that my now ex-boss would meet with me following the HR meeting to discuss it.  When I returned to my desk, he avoided me.  Now he's gone for the rest of the afternoon and I've no idea what I'm supposed to do.  Since I'm a contract employee, there is no severence.  No holiday pay.  Am I to stay on until Friday?  Do I really want to celebrate my 40th birthday working at a place that doesn't want me?  So much for Hannukah.  Man, this is harsher than the bus pass that bitch gave me for Christmas last year.  Fuckers.  (P.S. I can't believe this is my life.  Where are my husband and kids?  Oh, that's right... I forgot to have a family.  Oops!)

       "SECRET SANTAS" OF DAYS OF YORE   Last year at this time, I was working as an executive assistant at a large global asset management firm.  The admin group decided to hold a Secret Santa party (for those of you not in the know, it's where you draw a name out of a hat and buy a gift of a value not to exceed more than $20 for the person whose name you selected).  I was not the most popular executive assistant at this firm, mainly because I actually  had  a brain and could think for myself... I never joined the other blondes gathered 'round the water cooler on Thursday mornings discussing the previous night's episode of "The Bachelor".  That, in and of itself (besides being the only brunette in the group), made me an instant outcast.  Well, it so happened that the Secret Santa hat was positioned on the desk of the one girl in the admin pool who hated me the most.  On several occasions, I watched the other assistants select a name from the hat, open the folded piece of paper, then put it  back  into the hat and choose another.  I wasn't stupid, I knew they'd unwittingly selected my name!  One woman, Evelyn, had been out of the office on vacation for a week.  When she returned, there were only two slips of paper left in the hat... with my name and Evelyn's.  Well Evelyn was one of those women who other women need to be wary of.  She would be nice to my face then stab me in the back when I wasn't around.  Again, I wasn't stupid... I was in the toilet stall one afternoon when she came into the loo with another woman and said disparaging things about me, unaware that I was in the bathroom.  (Until that moment, I never knew that I was such a slut!  To this day, I appreciate Evelyn's candor.  It's saved me from a life of sin, selling my body to the night.)  Back to the Secret Santa story: On December 16, 2002, the administrative group went out to lunch at a Greek restaurant and after we ate, we exchanged gifts.  The presents ranged from cute hat and glove sets and fancy picture frames to body lotion and matching martini glasses.  I was the last woman to open her gift.  Evelyn presented me with a lovely, colorful gift bag with a fancy ribbon and silver tissue paper.  I opened it with a smile in anticipation of something nice.  Everyone laughed (at me and not with me) when I dug to the bottom of the gift bag and discovered this: a  urlLink Chicago Transit Authority  bus pass!!  Damn, that was cold.      (P.S. I still have the colorful gift bag... it's great for toting my lunch.)

       THE EIGHTH & FINAL NIGHT   Thank G-d!!       Well, I've made it through Hannuka, my 40th birthday and Christmas. My friends are all out of town this week, so they didn't have to listen to my incessant whining (my gift to them!)   I just hope I can get past New Year's Eve and Valentine's Day, and then all will be well in the WendyCity.  Still, I am thankful that we caught Saddam, that Molly Ringwald finally landed the affections of popular high school boy Jake Ryan on her birthday in " urlLink Sixteen Candles ", and that I still have a pulse... at least I have a  few  things to be grateful for as this year comes to an end!

       THANK GOD IT'S FRIDAY!  This means I won't have to hear from Kelly Services for an entire weekend and thus, my blood pressure will be stabilized for at least 48 hours.   Late yesterday, a dimwit from Kelly named Jamie (who obviously wasn't aware of my unemployment eligibility dispute with her colleague Beth) called me with an interview at a consulting firm.  Temp-to-perm and $10K less than I've made at my last three jobs.  I agreed to go on the interview because I need the practice.  This morning, Jamie phoned again and in a girly-girl, high-pitched voice exclaimed,  "Hi Wendy!  Are you, like,  totally  excited about your interview next week?!"     Me (diplomatic but wishing I could reach through my phone and backhand her):  "Um, yeah.  I'm always happy to have interviews."   Jamie:  "Great!  How'd you like to have another one?!"  (Jamie speaks in exclamation! points!)  She proceeded to tell me that this other employer is seeking an office manager.  Jamie:  "You mentioned that you're looking for project management responsibilities and this job will have  (reading from job order)  'lots of office projects'!"   Wendy: "Really?  What kinds of projects?  Powerpoint presentations?  Market research?"  Jamie:  "Um... it doesn't say on the order but it's probably stuff like ordering office supplies and setting up meetings."   Wendy:  "Oh.  Well, what's the salary range?  Is it a direct, permanent hire?"   Jamie:  "Um, I think it's a lot like that other job you're interviewing for but I think they'll offer $2 thousand more on salary.  Originally they wanted to do a straight hire but I think it's temp-to-perm now, but they're REALLY SERIOUS about making a fast decision!!!!!"   Wendy:  "Well, that's still $8K less than my bottom asking price but tell me more about it.  I'll be flexible for the right opportunity.  How many people are in this office and what kind of consulting do they do?"   Jamie:  "Um, I'm not sure... my manager forgot to put that in the job description but these are all questions you can ask in the interview!"   Wendy:  "What's the address?"   Jamie:  "123 Main Street."   Wendy:  "What suite number?"   Jamie:  "Um, it doesn't say here but you can probably find that out on their website!"   Wendy:  "Okay, what's their URL?"   Jamie:  "UR-what?"   Wendy:  "The website address."   Jamie:  "Um, I'm not sure."   NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!!!!! No WAY am I going to go on an interview that my recruiter is completely unable to prepare me for!  Why should she even earn a commission when she (and her cronies) are obviously so incompetant?  I find women like Jamie particularly nauseating -- women who overcompensate for their lack of preparation or common sense by blaming someone else for not giving them the information they need to do a competent job.  She didn't even do the legwork before contacting me and that's her frigging  job !   Uccchhh.  Enough.  I'm off to mix a strong gin and tonic.  Can I get you folks anything while I'm up?

         I'm half-watching a cheesy movie on  The Movie Channel  called " urlLink Dahmer ":  Serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer hides a gruesome secret behind a quiet demeanor.   TMC's obviously hurting for quality cable programming.  This is so stupid but yet I continue to watch it, hoping to see some gratuitous dismemberment (it's either this or  urlLink 'Til Death Do Us Part: Carmen and Dave  on MTV.)  It's a tough decision, so I'm watching both simultaneously.  I think I need TiVo.  So today was the first really productive day I've had in eons.    1) I increased the weight on my bench press to 60 pounds for 12 reps and completed 8 unassisted pullups.  2) Phone interview with a real estate firm.  3) Phone interview with the unemployment office re: Kelly Services' dispute of my claim (I'm told the dispute will rule in my favor but first I must fax Unemployment my email and phone records of my job search to prove that I've actually been in pursuit of gainful employment.)  4) Phone interview with a major financial institution.  5) In-person interview with the  urlLink advertising agency  that does all of those  urlLink Corona Beer  t.v. ads  6) Picked up paycheck from Northbridge Staffing for my two weeks temping at J. Walter Thompson Advertising.  (Still not enough to cover rent.)  7) I won tickets from our local rock station, WXRT, to a  urlLink Poi Dog Pondering  concert (a local band with a Grateful Dead-like following in Chicago; they are wonderful!) I'm always winning stuff from WXRT... Paul Simon tickets (I went to his sound check and met him and was surprised at how SHORT he is!)  8) Hung out with my neighbors  urlLink Woody  and his partner  urlLink Todd  for awhile... they always make me laugh!  9) Stir-fried baked tofu and veggies for dinner and invented a wonderful marinade with equal parts low-sodium soy sauce, sesame oil, rice wine vinegar, crushed red pepper and Splenda substitute sugar.  Tons of protein, low carb.  10) I have a phone interview tomorrow morning with one of the few remaining really cool  urlLink internet consultancies  who've survived post-9/11.   urlLink Monster.com  ROCKS!  All of these opportunities have come through this job search engine.  It looks like the job market's picking up... FINALLY!   (Now don't think I'm turning over a new, positive attitude.  More bitching, moaning, sarcasm and cynicism are soon to follow in subsequent posts... but that's what keep y'all coming back, now don't it?)

       CRY ME A RIVER   Beth from Kelly Services just had the audacity to call me again and berate me for making her look bad to her client.  What the...???  When I told her last week that I'd be interested in the temp job she had an order for, I didn't realize that I was committing to it (she told me she'd submit my resume for the position - a resume for a TEMP job - and see what they said.  It was never carved in stone that I'd be selected.)  Then the client wanted me to come in on Thursday for a 1/2 day to "try me on for size".  So, when I subsequently was offered two interviews for Thursday for REAL jobs with real benefits, I told Beth that I wasn't available to temp for half the day.   "You made me look bad to my client!  Now they're going with another agency!"   Now I get it.  She's lost a (potential) commission.  Cry me a river.  If she can't handle rejection, she shouldn't be in the temporary services business.

       BE GLAD YOU'RE NOT ME RIGHT NOW, FOLKS   Beth at Kelly Services got her temp client to agree to have me work for them from noon until 5 p.m. tomorrow due to the fact that I have a REAL job interview in the morning.  Well, this morning I received a phone call from a very well-established software company (you know the one) asking if I'd be available for an interview at 3:30.  I called Beth at Kelly Services back and told her that unfortunately, I'll be unable to temp for them tomorrow.  Beth:  "Well you made a commitment to us and we told the client that you'd be there.   Obviously  you're not interested in working for Kelly Services, Wendy!"   Wendy:  "Well,  OBVIOUSLY  I'm interested in finding a full-time position with benefits, Beth!"    Beth:  "Well, I'm going to note this conversation in our system. Goodbye!"   They are hell-bent on fucking up my unemployment claim.  This is utter and complete BULLSHIT.      urlLink MENSA  CALLING...   And, as the cherry on the icing on the cake of my morning, my next phone call was stellar.  I submitted my resume to an ad on Monster and surprise! It's being handled by yet another employment agency, Paige Personnel.  I spoke to a woman named Linda (she sounded like a senior citizen, which wouldn't surprise me based on her response to my questions).  Linda:  "Thank you for returning my call... let me pull up your resume here... oh!  Can you come in for an interview?  Our office is in Naperville."  (Naperville is a suburb of BuFu Egypt.)  Wendy:  "Oh, I didn't realize that.  I don't have a car and there's no public transportation to Naperville."  Linda:  "We also have an office in Skokie."   (Skokie is over an hour away by train and bus!)  Wendy: (Prequalifying)  "Well, can you please tell me more about this job? If it's the right fit, perhaps I can arrange transportation."   Linda:  "It's an administrative assistant position."  Wendy:  "Um, yes but what type of firm is it?"   Linda: (Hesitating)  "Software and technology consulting."   Wendy:  "What would my core responsibilities be?"  Linda:  "I'm not allowed to give that information out over the phone until we get you in here for an interview."   Wendy:  "But can you tell me if it's straight administrative, like calendars and travel arrangements, or if there's a degree of project work involved?"   Linda: (Long silence, then)  "I'm sorry but that's all I can tell you.  The client has asked us not to talk about it."  Okay Linda, good luck filling that position!!  Folks, I am NOT making this shit up.  I share it with you here for the simple reason that these experiences are so bizarre that I have to type them out, then read what I've typed to actually believe that This is My Life!

        "LIGHTNESS AND AIR?"   FEH!    urlLink Kelly Services , an employment-slash-temp agency, was used by the  urlLink Chicago Tribune  to payroll me for two months while I was on a temp-to-perm job. At the end of my 60 days, the Tribune chose not to hire me on as a permanent employee after reviewing their budget for 2004.  Last week I received a notice from the  urlLink Illinois Department of Economic Security  (our state unemployment department) that Kelly Services has disputed my claim to resume my benefits because I did not check in with them every five days for new temp assignments (I did leave two messages for Tom, one of their recruiters but never heard back from him.)  This is one of the loopholes some employment agencies use to avoid having to contribute to a former employee’s unemployment payouts.  This afternoon I received a call from one of the Kelly reps:  Beth:  “We have a long-term temp assignment that could last for over six months.  I’ve submitted your resume for it and they’ve narrowed it down to three candidates of which you are one.  Each person will temp for one full day and then the client will make a decision based on performance.  Are you available to work on the 21st?”   Wendy:  “Well, actually, I have a job interview that day.”   Beth:  “I know you’ve had some issues with this recently but unfortunately, I’ll have to enter it into our system that you turned this temp job down.”   Wendy:  “But I  haven’t  turned it down!  I have a job interview that day.  Will your client be willing to let me leave for two hours and then return?”   Beth:  “Well, this assignment could go for almost a year, Wendy.”   Wendy:   “But it’s a  temporary  assignment and I’m interviewing for a permanent position on the 22nd, with full benefits.  Surely you can understand my position!”   Beth:   “I do but this is also an interview.  I’ll still have to enter it into our system that you are turning this temp opportunity down.”   Wendy:   “Like I said, I’m  not  turning it down.  I’m just informing you that I have a job interview at 10 a.m. that day.  If they are willing to be flexible, I’ll consider your one day temp interview.”   Beth:  “Well, I’ll call my client and see what they say.”    FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER… VOICE MAIL MESSAGE FROM BETH   Beth:  “I spoke to the client and they are willing to be flexible and have you come in from 12 to five p.m.”   I didn’t return Beth’s call; instead, I contacted Amy, the owner of another employment agency whom I’ve known for many years and whom I consider to be extremely professional and knowledgeable about the recruitment industry.  She told me that Kelly Services is playing hardball with me because they don’t want to pay whatever it is that employers pay for an employee’s unemployment benefits.  Amy informed me that in her experience, disputes such as this usually are in favor of the ex-employee (again, I was never really an “employee” of Kelly Services as I never voluntarily signed up with them; rather, the Chicago Tribune used Kelly Services, their contracted staffing agency, to payroll me for 60 days until they decided whether or not to bring me on board permanently.    I have a phone interview with the unemployment department on Thursday when I’ll get to state my position. What KILLS me is that I’ve already spent over 5 hours on the phone with several Kelly Services managers  and  the Chicago unemployment department hashing this out with no resolution!  All I want is my $330!  The irony here is that the $330 will be the last check of my 2003 unemployment benefit claim and I’ll have to wait another month before re-applying for a continuation.  As the tagline of my Blog header states, I am truly  Riding the Bourgeois Roller Coaster of Life!

       PUT THE #@!!!*&# LID BACK DOWN!   Despite my frustrations dealing with  urlLink employment agencies  in my quest for a new job, I've also managed to find some outstanding opportunities on my own with the assistance of some great online  urlLink job search   urlLink engines . I'm happy to report that on Friday, I received an offer from a wonderful internet design agency.  Additionally, I've had three interviews with an advertising/public relations firm.  Assuming that the ad/p.r. firm makes an offer on Monday (which I suspect they may), it will be a difficult decision.  While the internet design firm offers the opportunity to wear many different hats and take on a ton of interesting responsibilities, the advertising agency has  really cool bathrooms!         Something about those loo signs spoke to me... but what is the message, exactly?

       IT'S NOT BONE FUSION!   This evening after my spinning class, I stopped into my local grocery store to pick up a quick bite to eat (a frozen vegan Indian entree).  Of course, there's no such thing as picking up  anything  quickly at this market, even if the store's nearly empty; it's typically takes, (at minimum) a half-hour to purchase so much as a bottle of water at this place, mainly due to the apathy of the slow-moving checkers and baggers.  To combat the lack of humanity, the management recently installed six electronic self-service scanning stations.  In line in front of me at one of the scanners was a middle-aged, petite woman wearing too much makeup, an ugly fur coat and a sense of entitlement.  She probably thought she was a cute damsel in distress but failed to attract much attention or support with her subsequent temper tantrum and foot-stomping.  Background: These new-fangled supermarket scanning machines, if you make the mistake of breathing on them the wrong way, will emit an electronic voice that informs you,  "Unknown item in bagging area.  Please remove this item."   If one accidentally bumps one's knee or handbag against the so-called bagging area, the (female) voice chastises,  "The last item you scanned is incorrect.  Please remove this item from the bagging area."   There's really nothing to be done in this instance other than wait for one of the slack-jawed, drooling, apathetic, disinterested and slow-moving human beans to reset the system  (yes, the employees  are  actual beans -- inanimate, full of fiber and quite flatulant) .  Although I, being a rocket scientist, managed to figure out the nuances and idiosyncrasies of the self-service scanning station in, like, less than a nanosecond (glad I went to college!), I'm not immune to receiving these admonishments from the machine's disembodied voice for so much as looking at it the wrong way.  This evening, a petite woman in her late 40's was having a dialogue with the machine.   "Shut up!  Shut up!  I heard you already, just shut up!"   She scanned the same box of Kleenex over the scanner again and again which only caused it to blink and bleat in confusion.   "Oh, shut the f*ck  up  already, I heard you the  first  time!"   She was making quite a scene with her little hissy fit.  Her histrionics, had I not been starving and wanting to get the hell out of the market, would have been quite amusing.  To facilitate things, I began complaining in unison with the woman:  "C'mon!   C'mooooooooooon !  I'm only 21, please don't let me  die  waiting in this fucking  line !  Jeez, it's just a computerized  scanner , lady; it's not  BONE FUSION !"     (That didn't make her complete her transaction any faster but it sure was fun!)

       IT'S MONDAY AGAIN  ...and the madness continues!   Early last August, I interviewed for a position with a very well-known technology company.  (In fact, I interviewed with them  twice  that month.)  After my interviews, I never heard back from them and when I followed up, I was told they were holding off on making a decision (for some reason which was never made clear to me).    Surprise, surprise! when last week (nearly six months later) the human resources woman phoned me to ask if I was still interested in the position.  We scheduled a third interview with the hiring manager for today at 1:00 p.m.  Today, my phone rang at 12:00 p.m. just as I was about to walk out the door for the interview. It was the human resources woman calling to tell me that late last Friday, the hiring manager chose an internal candidate for the position!  She told me that they do have another open position available but it's at a much lower salary and with far less responsibility or room for advancement.  If I didn't already have four other irons in the fire, I'd consider it... but then again, I have to refrain from letting desperation guide my decision-making process.  I have a ton of experience and until I get an eviction notice from my landlady, I must hold out for a position with a firm willing to pay me what I'm worth, otherwise I'll be forced to accept something that I'm clearly over-qualified for and seriously underpaid for, and bail as soon as something better comes along.  I don't want to do that.  I guess this sort of thing happens but I can't help but note that this is the weirdest and most challenging job search I've ever experienced in all the years I've ever sought employment!

       KELLY IS A BITCH!   (I know how fascinating this ongoing diatribe about  urlLink Kelly Temporary Services  and my unemployment benefit payment problems must be to all of you, but  urlLink Mia  and  urlLink Izzy  have commented on my blog and emailed me and told me that they can relate, so this one’s for you, ladies!)  I had to make sure to be home this morning for an 11:30 a.m. phone interview (again... I already did this two weeks ago) with “Mrs. Key” at the Illinois Department of Economic Security (IDES) regarding Kelly Services’ second dispute of my unemployment benefits.  I was online until 11:25 and when I logged off my computer, I discovered I had two voice mail messages – (1) from the interviewer at IDES (she phoned 5 minutes early) and (2) from Beth at Kelly Services.  Beth’s message stated that she had another temporary assignment to present to me, and that her co-worker Jamie had left several messages for me which I had not returned (which absolutely not true… Jamie phoned last week and I told her that I was pending a job offer.)  I returned Mrs. Key's call first, and she read the dispute that Beth at Kelly Services had submitted:   On 1/20/04, the following offer of work was made to Wendy:  Start date: 1/20/04.   End date: 1/20/04.   Hours: 12:00-5:00 p.m.   Work offer was made by B. Hall.   Description of work:  Administrative Claimant refused above assignment.   Reason:  Hours not good enough.    “Hours not  good enough ?”   To recap: Beth called about a possible 6-month temp job with Boeing Corp. last month and said they wanted to see resumes before deciding.  I said, “Sure, submit mine.”  Several days later, I was fortunate enough to land two job interviews… for REAL jobs, PERMANENT jobs, jobs with BENEFITS.  Beth called me and said that Boeing liked my resume and wanted me to work half a day on January 21 to “try me on for size”.  I told her that I had two interviews that particular day.  (Read  urlLink this  for a transcript of my argument with Beth on January 19.)  I slowly and succinctly explained my situation in detail to Mrs. Key, (an inarticulate woman who could barely speak with proper grammar, muttered a lot and had a five-second delay in comprehending everything I told her).  She took over 15 minutes to write out longhand what I said, then got everything wrong when she read it back to me.  30 minutes later (and lots of irritable pacing about my apartment on the portable phone), Mrs. Key told me that she was confused about why Kelly was disputing my claim, as I obviously had two solid job interviews that day, and the ½ day assignment with Boeing to “interview” for a temp job seemed strange.  She then told me that it would take 7-10 days for a determination to be ruled, and  another  7-10 to receive my past-due $300, assuming the determination was in my favor.  I  already  went through this two weeks ago with IDES, and I had to go through it again!  Then I returned Beth’s call and informed her that I did speak to Jamie; her phone calls to me WERE returned.   "Oh,"  was all Beth said in response.  I told her that I’d accepted a full-time job that I will begin next Monday.   “I’m so  happy  for you!”  she squealed (yeah,  right , Jill!).  She told me that whenever I turned down an assignment presented to me by Kelly Services, for whatever reason, it automatically goes to IDES as a dispute.  More bullshit… “Hours not good enough” is not a generic, computer-generated comment.   I JUST WANT MY $300!!!!!!!!

       BITE ME, KELLY SERVICES!!   Hearkening back to my previous posts about my struggles with Kelly Temporary Services and their continuous  urlLink dispute about my eligibility for unemployment benefits for the first two weeks of January , I was instructed to be home last Tuesday to participate in a phone interview with the Illinois Department of Economic Security to determine if my unemployment claim would be honored.  I discussed my situation with the rep, and was instructed to fax them a history of my job search records (emails, copy of my resume, phone logs).  Yesterday, I received a letter from the IDES that stated,  "The claimant has conducted a realistic and independent search for suitable work, etc., etc., etc.  Since the claimant is able to, available for, actively seeking, and registered for work as required, the claimant is NOT ineligible for unemployment benefits."   This morning, another letter from IDES arrived in the mail:   "A question has been raised regarding your eligibility for unemployment insurance benefits for the period beginning 1/18/04.  To resolve this question, it will be necessary for you to be interviewed and supply information regarding your refusal to apply for or accept suitable work.  This interview is requested because KELLY SERVICES reports that you refused a job offer on 1/20/04."   WTF??!!!!  Bite me!  I did  NOT  refuse a job offer; in fact, all they proposed to me was a 6-month  temp assignment , an assignment which required that I temp for one day, that one day to be considered an "interview" for the temp job!  I told them I had two job interviews scheduled for that day, so they obviously recorded it as a "job refusal".  So, I called the unemployment office and apparently, despite the records I've provided, Kelly Services intends to dispute my claim for every two-week period I continue to certify for benefits!  Now I must remain at home tomorrow to be interviewed by the IDES yet again.  But that doesn't matter because  I got a job offer from a really cool e-commerce/internet design company yesterday  (I sent a resume to their ad on  urlLink Monster.com , and I accepted.)  ENOUGH of this bourgeois roller coaster ride!

       HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PROBLEM...   "I am sorry that anyone was offended by the wardrobe malfunction during the halftime performance of the Super Bowl," Timberlake said in a statement.

       TIT-ILLATING?      I'm not a prude, really I'm not.  I am not uncomfortable with nudity (except my own, particularly after eating a trough of Doritos).  I must take exception, however, to Miss Jackson's unexpected and appalling display of tittie during this evening's  urlLink Superbowl Halftime Show .  I was pleased with the performances by Janet, P Diddy, Kid Rock, etc., until Justin Timberlake made an unexpected appearance.  As if things couldn't get worse, he ended his "duet" with Janet by tearing off part of her top and revealing her right boob (scantily covered by a pastie, a la Lil' Kim at the 1999 MTV Music Awards).       I don't understand why Janet  thought this would be a fitting ending to her performance. Yes, she has lovely, surgically-enhanced breasts.  Yes, at the advanced age of 38, she still has the body of a teenager.  But this gratuitous breast reveal?  Totally unnecessary and such poor form!

       OF VALENTINE'S DAY & TAPE MIXES   Nothing says "I heart you" like a mixed tape compilation!    I've just finished my first week at my new job at the interactive firm.  I'm  exhausted .   "How did your first week go?"  you're (possibly) wondering.  Well, it was only my first week.  First weeks don't count because it's still the honeymoon phase.  (I anticipate that the emotional battery will begin within the next two fortnights.)  I have an office.  It has a door.  I can close it when I need to call my gynecologist.  Everyone seems professional and invested in their jobs there.  I've had no "red flag" experiences... no irritating coworkers, no  urlLink Queen Bee  head secretaries marking their territory by lifting their leg and peeing on my desk  (like that woman at the temp-to-perm gig at the Chicago Tribune Oct-Dec) ; no Busybody  urlLink Candy Lady  strung out on M&M's, keeping track of when I arrive and leave the office  (short-lived job at the real estate firm in September) .  Ucccchhhhh, I'm  so tired ... I've had no interest in posting anything here this week but I'll probably come up with something compelling in the next day or two.  I have to catch up on all of your Blogs, too!    Well, tomorrow's  Valentine's Day , so the relentless Zales Jewelry television commercials have reminded me.  I received a card from my mom (as usual) but don't anticipate any flowers or love letters from people not related to me.  No Big Deal, I'm used to it!  So, this post is published in the spirit of that giddy feeling of having a crush on someone (inspired by the comment  urlLink Stuart  left on my last post regarding the 2000 John Cusak movie " urlLink High Fidelity ", which was filmed here in Chicago).   (Stuart: close call on the Monroe Street Bridge photo... the scene with Cusak delivering his monologue about his girlfriend's idiosyncrasies that you referred to was actually filmed four blocks north, on the Kinzie Street Bridge.  All those bridges look the same.)     "Did I listen to pop music because I was miserable, or was I miserable because I listened to pop music?"                                  ROB              A good compilation tape, like             breaking up, is hard to do and             takes ages longer than it might             seem.  You gotta kick off with a             killer, to hold the attention.             Then you have to take it up a             notch, but not blow your wad, so             maybe cool it off a notch, and you             can't put the same artist twice on             the tape, except if some subtle             point or lesson or theme involved,             and even then not the two of them             in a row, and you can't woo somebody             with Joni Mitchell's "Big Yellow             Taxi" and then bash their head off             with something like GBH's "City             Baby Attacked by Rats," and... oh,             there are a lot of rules.  Anyway,             I worked hard at this one.

       OH, THE HUMILITY!      This is worse than  urlLink  "Mom Finds Out About Blog"  ...  I began my new job at the internet company today and shortly after arriving, the CEO shook my hand, welcomed me and said, "By the way, nice Blog!" (During my interview, I'd mentioned to the Strategy VP that I enjoy digital photography and had set up a website to post my pictures but that it was still "under construction").  I never gave them the name of my site but it turns out that they found it (Google?  How horrifying!)  Thank goodness I posted several positive things about "a cool internet firm" and being excited to work there!!  At least they didn't rescind the job offer, and I had a very nice first day of work.  Really, though, it could have been worse.  Click here:  urlLink  "How Not to Get Fired Because of Your Blog"  .

       THE COUNTDOWN BEGINS   To the start my new job as an Office Manager at an internet firm tomorrow (I just learned that I'll actually get an OFFICE with a DOOR and a WINDOW!)  It's been a rough year, with several temp-to-perm opportunities that never bore fruit and a tough job hunt, and I've suffered the slings and arrows of many an incompetent temp agency and headhunter along the way.  I hope that this job lasts for as long as I want it to, without being laid off again (which historically has been the pattern for me over the past 8 years.)  My neighbor Todd  urlLink referenced  one of my favorite independent films in his post tonight, and I laughed when I read it, for " urlLink Clockwatchers " has always been a movie that I have identified with, having logged many long and painful hours temping to make ends meet between "real" jobs.  If I only had Parker Posey's looks!  On another note, I'm in the middle of watching the 46th Annual Grammy Awards (it's a commercial break as I type this) and I must say, it's one of the best Grammys I've ever seen.  I remarked to a friend earlier that there would be no artists that I even listen to on the show but happily, I was pleased to be wrong on that account.  Prince (opening the show with Beyonce in all of his Purpleness), Beck, Sting, Yoko Ono, White Stripes, Parliament Funkadelic, Gwen Stefani, and more.  All of these musicians have a place in my CD collection.  Their performances and award presentations made Justin Timberlake's Grammy award tolerable.  I particularly enjoyed the tribute to The Beatles' 40th anniversary of their appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show.  Okay, gotta go... Earth Wind & Fire is performing "Shining Star".   THE EYES OF WENDY CITY      Oh... someone told me that the picture of me freezing a few weeks ago reminded him of this poster for the 1978 Faye Dunaway film " urlLink The Eyes of Laura Mars ".

       HIATUS MINORUS   I awoke up with a mild case of cerebral flatulence this morning.   I attribute it to the heinous fluorescent lighting in my new office with no natural light from the non-existent window.  Suffering aforementioned brain fart and lacking anything interesting to post about, I'm lost in a reverie, dreaming of summer.    Missing Boris the Spider.   urlLink (archive from July)      This fart might last forever, or only for one day.  Worst case scenario: until the annual summer spider infestation outside the window of my 17th floor flat.

(Thanks to  urlLink Chris Pina  for this one!)   HEY, PILAR!   Before I accepted this latest job offer, I had an appointment at yet another temp agency.  There was this cute young gal, Pilar, who was working their reception desk for one day (temping for the temp agency.)  How surprised was I when our receptionist called in sick today and the temp filling in for her was none other than Pilar?  So, this post's a shout-out to her.  Hi Pilar!  I hope I spelled your name correctly.  Click the "comment" link below and leave a note to acknowledge that you read this... or not if this is too embarassing!

       V.D.: DELAYED REACTION   Valentine's Day has left a bad taste in my mouth.  Frankly, I'm a bit ambivalent about it.  Great for you if you had someone to call your Valentine but for me, well, it seems I've always been in between boyfriends on February 14th.  Today, a handful of people greeted me with,  "So!  How was your Valentine's Day?"   (These were folks who don't really know me well; otherwise they wouldn't have asked.)  I dunno, it wasn't too bad... I awoke on Saturday with a hangover (don't ask), went to a gay marriage rights rally, then to an eye doctor appointment, then home for a nap.  I hung out with my friends Woody & Todd that evening (I swear, my gay friends have better romantic relationships than I), then half-watched "Saturday Night Live" until I crashed at midnight.  Pretty exciting life I lead, no?  I will admit that things could be worse... I have a new job and I think I like it.  I can't believe that there are no "red flags".  I'm actually being treated like a professional and not being micro-managed by my new employers.  It's a small group, and everyone does their own thing, coming together to get things done and looking to others to provide assistance and their expertise when needed.  (I know that someone at my company is probably reading my Blog, so of course I have nothing but  great things  to say, heh heh!)  Additionally, I don't get the sense that there are any prima donnas there.  I'm the Office Manager, dammit, and I have an OFFICE.  With a DOOR!  Life doesn't get any better than that (when I dream, I dream BIG!)  There's even the possibility that I'll make a trip to our home office in Calgary (Alberta, Canada) in the near future, and the prospect of travel excites me.  I need a change of scenery and soon!!  Oh, regarding Saturday's rally,  urlLink Todd  posted a nice, long excerpt about the event  urlLink here .  I should mention that my blog is not, and never will be, a forum for political or religious debate.  I make it a point not to comment on issues I'm not completely informed about.  I will note, however, that everyone deserves equal rights.  I don't know if gay marriage will truly ever fly in our conservative nation but I firmly agree that gay couples in long-term relationships should be entitled to the same benefits that married, heterosexual couples are.  Todd's partner Woody was interviewed by our local NBC affiliate and stated that he would like the comfort of knowing that if anything should ever happen to him that Todd would be taken care of.  These two Boyz are dear friends of mine and I will always support them and their partnership.  They taken me under their wing during very difficult times and for that, they have my undying appreciation and respect.  It's been a rough journey for these two, and enlightening for me, getting to know them and seeing the dynamics of their relationship.  Particularly for dear Woody, who suffers Todd's running commentary on the decor of the sets of television shows that they watch ("Arrested Development" on FOX:  "Oh, I just  hate  that ugly lamp!"   BBC's "Coupling" on PBS:  "Oh Woody, that's a  Miro lithograph  on the wall!"   The evening news on NBC:   "Oh Woody, I don't like when Sharon Wright wears red... it's so unflattering with her skin tone!"

        CALLING ALL BLOGGERS: ASSISTANCE NEEDED  Send me a link to your favorite blog!      Today, I received an email from one of the web designer/developers at the interactive firm I currently work for:   Hi all,  I am looking for examples of nice blogs or useful blog sites for some work on ###. If you have a favorite blog please send it my way.  It’ll be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!  F.   He’s working on a project for one of our clients (a major, luxury European automotive company) and is seeking the URL’s of some blogs that have a certain “look and feel” that we can adapt for our client’s website.  Specifically, this car company is working on a new model (still a prototype) and wishes to add a page to their site that will allow visitors to  discuss  this new concept car.  Our developer cited this blog as an example:  urlLink PBReview.com   It appears to be a portal of sorts for people involved in Paint Ball games, with links to accessories, gear and other Paint Ball resources; additionally, there are links to Paint Ball location reviews (which I believe is key in what our developer is looking for), links where site visitors can submit feedback and share information on our client's new car model.  Please note that he is not looking for “generic” template-based blogs (such as mine, built from Blogger.com.)  I don’t know if this is enough background for any of you to go on but take your best shot and forward your recommendations to me at  lax2ord1995@yahoo.com .  Muchas gracias!

       BRA-LESS   I laundered all of my exercise clothing this weekend.  Because I work out an average of 6 days per week, I’ve invested in a lot of expensive technical gear manufactured with state-of-the-art fabrics which won’t shrink, fade or lose their elasticity after numerous wearing and washings.  Which is why I was highly annoyed when I misplaced one of my favorite Pearl Izumi jog bras after doing my laundry last Friday night.  I’d intended to wear it during a spin class on Saturday morning but when I awoke and couldn’t find it in my clean pile of neatly folded clothes, I went down to the laundry room to do a bit of detective work.  Perhaps I’d left it in the washing machine, I thought.  After some investigation, my Pearl Izumi was not in the obvious place I’d suspected.  I was nearly in a panic because it’s my favorite bra: it’s white, has no seams (no chafing), thin straps that don’t show under any of my workout tops, and it cost the dear sum of $40 USD.  I’ve owned it for three years and it’s retained its elasticity through all of my sweaty activities.  On a hunch, I decided to look in the garbage can in the corner of the laundry room and lying there amongst the used, no-static drier sheets and lint, like an abandoned orphan, was my favorite jog bra, unceremoniously disposed of without so much as a note.  Needless to say, I was more than a bit pissed off.  I retrieved my bra and immediately stomped down three flights to the lobby, where I waved it in the face of Jimmy, my building’s engineer and janitor who was sitting at the front desk.  Wendy:  “Jimmy, tell me something… does there appear to be anything wrong with this?”   Jimmy:  (Looks at the bra with a blank stare, like I’d just presented him with a steaming pile of feces.)  Wendy:  “Does this bra look frayed or stained or in a general state of disrepair?”   Jimmy:   “Uh… no...”   Wendy:  “Then do you have any idea why someone might have tossed this expensive article of clothing into the laundry room’s trash can?”   Jimmy:   “Um, I found it between the driers and it looked like garbage to me…”   Wendy:   “Jimmy, I would  never  have put this into the drier.  It would have shrunk.  And why would you think it was trash?”   Jimmy:  (Silence.  Vacant stare.)  Shaking my head in disgust, I stuffed the bra into my workout bag and stomped out of the lobby.  Now I know what’s happened to all my missing socks!  They looked like TRASH, so Jimmy threw them away!  Supposedly, there’s a lost-and-found box in the office of the building but now I know that our building’s janitors are too lazy to put left-behind laundry in the crate.  Later that evening, I told my friends Woody and Todd about this incident and Woody laughed.  “I actually FOUND that bra in one of the washing machines and put it on the folding table in the laundry room!  I even asked Todd if he thought it might be yours!  It wasn’t between the driers.  Jimmy is full of crap.”   Jesus, I live in a Confederacy of Dunces!!

       BLOGGING INTERLUDE: LET'S MAKE LOTS OF MONEY    urlLink Londonmark's  post reminded me of my love affair (in the late 80's) with the  urlLink Pet Shop Boys  and the  urlLink lyrics  to my favorite song of theirs.  Sometimes it's fun to drag out those old cassettes from the shoebox under the bed and take a trip down memory lane.  The soundtrack to my life was much better in the '80s.  My fashion sense, however, was questionable (but I'm predicting a resurgence of spandex stirrup pants and shoulder-padded couture this Spring, full stop!)

       DE-LIGHT!   I arrived home from my Saturday in Los Angeles to Chicago on Sunday (I mean Monday) at 12:45 a.m. only to discover that my fridge had mysteriously turned itself off while I was gone.  (Apparently, the poltergeists that plagued me from ages 7-14 have returned with a vengeance.)  Between 1:00-1:30 a.m. CST , I was wearing rubber gloves and shoving liquified fruit and vegetables into a Hefty garbage bag, dousing my apartment with Lysol, and sponging up the remains *  of my defrosted ice box.  Monday and Tuesday were busy days (and evenings) spent at the office (I'm still amazed that I actually have a job and, even more astounding, that I actually like it!)  All I could think about when my elevator arrived on the floor of my residence tonight was curling up in a fetal position under my down comforter and sleeping for 10 hours.  As I approached my front door, I saw an envelope stuck to my doorknob (with the words,  "Hi Wendy, remember to SMILE!"  written on it).  The envelope contained this de-lightful gift:     which will come in handy if I need "to make" a trip to the bathroom in the dark. Thanks for the gift, Woods & Todd!  When I Pee, I'll Think of Thee.   *   (H2O on the Periodic Table of Elements)

       ANIMALS  As the Stomach Churns   This morning, my friend L. IMd me with a link and texted,  "Have you  seen  this?"   So I viewed the news story, images and the video from the Fallujah incident (of course "incident" is a gross understatement) in their unedited versions before the afternoon when nearly all of the news outlets either pixellated or entirely edited out the reality of what happened to those four unfortunate individuals.   Beyond  appalling!  There really is no fitting adjective to describe this.  We should not be there!  We  never  should have to begin with!  Watching an interview with Oliver North on CNN tonight, I was struck by his seemingly nonchalant attitude about what's been happening in Iraq, as though this is to be expected, bluntly stating that it will happen again.  Then I changed the channel.  I can't wait to vote GWB out of office.  His replacement will have so much damage control to deal with!  Now I'm watching "Nightline" with Ted Koppel.  Comparing/contrasting what happened in Somalia and Fallujah.  "Isn't it 'apples and oranges'?", he asks General So-and-So, a guest on the program.  "Do Americans have the stomach for the truth?"  My stomach is churning.  Sleep will be slow to come tonight.

       BABY HIT ME ONE MORE TIME!  Fear & Loathing in Chicago - Redux    Standing in line at Osco Drugs this evening, waiting to pay for my purchase of Whoppers (I had a sudden and rare craving for sweets), a woman in front of me (who had an armful of sundries and a bottle of Jack Daniels while wearing Sony headsets and muttering along to whatever she was listening to) abruptly whirled around and screamed at the top of her lungs,   "YOU F*CKING HIT ME ONE MORE TIME AND I'LL  KILL  YOU!!!"    I was standing two feet from her.  The man behind me looked at me and shrugged his shoulders.  Crazy Woman continued her rant, her eyes bulging out of her head and a vein in her forehead throbbing.  Like I said, Crazy Woman.  I'm  so  tired of this shit happening every time I step foot outside my door.  I'm tired of being threatened by the drug and alcohol-addled waste products of humanity who reside in my neighborhood who have become so agressive that when denied a handout of a dollar, will actually follow me down the street, swearing at me.  So I responded vehemently (and at a volume of equal decibels) but won't repeat what I said (because I'm a Lady), although it did include whipping out my cell phone for added emphasis, and threatening to call the police.  The crazy woman abruptly shut her pie hole and turned away with a snort and a "HMMMMFFF!"   Even more ridiculous and unforgiveable were the two soccer moms and their three teenaged daughters who laughed and said they thought the woman was listening to Brittany Spears.   "We though you two knew each other and she was singing "Hit Me One More Time" to you!"   (As per usual, the apathetic asshat cashier with bad b.o. registered no awareness of the incident and muttered my purchase total unintelligibly.)  Tonight's incident is reminiscent of an experience I had one year ago (April 7, 2003) with Crazy Crack Head Woman who assaulted me as I stood on a street corner, claiming I'd cut her off on the sidewalk. (Go  urlLink here  and scroll down to the entry titled "Fear and Loathing in Chicago".  Is it me?  I'm seriously getting a complex living in Chicago.  I'm the only person I know who seems to experience this much drama just going to the store!

       POST NO "BILLS"      After watching  urlLink "The Apprentice"finale   (Donald Trump just "hired" Bill Rancic from Chitown) and some of the NBC 10 pm news (live from Mike Ditka's in Chicago with Bill's sister... which qualifies as Big News in the Windy City, after shootings and child abandonment in the projects), I tuned into the "Howard Stern Show" where  urlLink Ereka  (accused of calling Black contestant  urlLink Omarosa  the "N Word"   (and I, Vendela, will go on the record here by calling Omarosa the  urlLink "C Word"  ) was being given a lie detector test to determine whether or not she used the "N Word"  (no, I'm  not  going to provide a link to this - if you don't know what it means or if you do and don't understand why it's considered a highly offensive term, then you shouldn't be visiting this site.)     Some of the questions:    Would you marry a Black man?  (No)    Do you get annoyed when Black people talk back to the movie screen?   (laughed but didn't answer the question)    Have you ever fantasized about having sex with a woman?  (No) (The test revealed later that she *has*)    Do you have a general mistrust towards Jews?  (No, I'm dating a Jewish guy, the first Love of my Life!)    Do you enjoy the smell of your farts?  (No!) (The test revealed that she lied)    Have you ever fantasized about Howard Stern?  (No, I just met him!)   Have you ever fantasized about having sex with Donald Trump?  (No!)    Do you own a vibrator?  (No but maybe I should get one)    Do you think Blacks cry "racism" when they want to chisel something out of someone?   (Yes)    Have you ever referred to a Black person as a n****r?  (No)    Did you call Omarosa a n****r?  (No!)    Are you a racist?  (No)    Are you sexually attracted to Robin Quivers? [Stern's sidekick]  (No!) (So this proves she's not a racist, the tester said)    If you lived in the 1800's, would you ever have owned a Black person?  (I don't know!!)   Okay, enough.  On to the next "reality" show!  I heard there's one soon to air about a guy who's set up with 10 ex-girlfriends and has to choose one for a second chance at love.  What a nightmare that will be!

        COMEDIC INTERLUDE  "Laughter is the best medicine"          The Woods  purchased a new portable DVD player today.  Here he is in the waiting room at the hospital, killing some time watching " urlLink Drop Dead Gorgeous ", which the lovely  Leah  was kind enough to loan him.  Woody, Todd's mom and I watched the movie in its entirety, cackling (and me occasionally snorting which is *always* an attractive sound coming from a refined and sophisticated woman).  People walking towards the ICU looked at us as though someone had forgotten to inform us that we were in a hospital and  not  in a laundrymat.  We're really looking forward to Todd's recovery.  Woods is collecting souveniers for his scrapbook, including a wrapper from a Sterile Penis Protector Pouch.  (Don't ask.)  It's comforting to know that Northwestern Memorial saves lives  and  protects peepees!   (P.S. Todd's "Get Well Soon" comments link is still open  urlLink over at his blog!)

On behalf of all of us who adore our Boi, thank you to those who posted "get well soon" messages on his blog:  urlLink Jodi ,  urlLink Scott , "Thereselah",  urlLink Jake & Lorraine , Leslie,  urlLink Janice ,  urlLink Sue Bergman-Steele   (who kicks ass in and *out* of the gym!) ,  urlLink Latin , and Pilar & Mike.  I will print out all of the comments from his site when he is at a point where he can fully realize how many people are rooting for him (on and off-line).  As Jodi wrote, soon he will be lounging on his couch eating Bon Bons and watching bad reality television (T's favorite is "Survivor".)  I adore you all for taking the time, so thanks again!!

       ON HIATUS   A dear friend of mine is very ill.  I won't be entering anything on my blog until his health improves.  In the meantime, please visit  urlLink his site  and post a get-well message for him to read when he gets better.  I'll be printing them out periodically and bringing them to him.     (By the way, some people may consider this post about my friend's health "inappropriate" and an invasion of privacy but I strongly disagree, particularly as I'm not elaborating on his situation.  He needs to know that people are rooting for him, in "real" life or from the Blogosphere.)

       VOCABULARY NOTICE   Someone recently sent me an email (in response to my first post about  urlLink my friend T's  illness a few weeks ago) which stated,   "Vendela:  I think this is extremely inappropriate."      Today, I heard the word "inappropriate" used (and misused) on three separate occasions  (including one person who directed it at a McDonald's cashier for neglecting to remove a pickle from her hamburger.  She meant to say "this is unacceptable" but said "inappropriate".)   That is  it , people!!  Enough misappropriation of the English Language!!!  From this point forward, I am instituting a ban on the word "inappropriate" from my vocabulary*.   This term has become overused in the General Public's vernacular and has grown tiresome and banal.  When used by an idiot of average intelligence with a limited vocabulary who uses it because they think it makes them sound important, it just comes across as condescending and pretentious.  Why, just look at all of the appropriate "inappropriate"  urlLink alternatives  at one's disposal!   (* I'm also doing away with the word "unacceptable"!)

       THINGS COULD BE WORSE...   Yesterday, an elderly Black woman was camped out on the sidewalk in the middle of the afternoon, taking off her clothes while facing the display window at my local Blockbuster Video store.  People walked by her without a glance as she took her layers off (every item of clothing she owned was on her back), put them back on, then removed them again, all the while doing a little strip tease and chanting gibberish to no one in particular.  I was on my way to the gym and called the police when I got there... at first because I felt that she was a blight on the neighborhood (which she was) but then before hanging up, I told the dispatcher, "Someone, please *help* this woman."  But I know there was no help offered; the cops probably showed up in a cruiser and made her move along.   In moments of clarity, I realize that things could be worse; I could be her.  I felt simultaneously disgusted and saddened, and guilty for having such conflicting emotions.*  [*I felt the same emotions as I watched  urlLink The Swan  on t.v. this evening.  Simultaneouly disgusted and weirdly drawn towards the heinous spectacle of this "unreality" program.  Oh, what dreck!  For shame, FOX, for  shame !]

       YES, AS A MATTER OF FACT, I  DO  OWN THE @#!&$DAMNED SIDEWALK!   So this afternoon as I was leaving the train station with my lunch (some pretty decent falafel, which I bought in the food court) I suddenly became aware of this tall, skinny black guy jogging towards me on the sidewalk.  He was jogging with this odd, stick-straight, knees-up form; pumping his arms like he was part of a marching band and bouncing  (doing! doing! doing!)  in a beeline right at me, like he was playing a game of Chicken and asserting his territory.  He glared defiantly at me as he approached, which is why I knew he was challenging me and not experiencing endorphin-related cluelessness.  Fortunately, I just happened to have my boss's gargantuan, green golf cart umbrella* with me and I pointed it at him like a sword so as to impale him if he didn't go around me.    At the last second, the Jogging Jackass veered to the right of me.  A few people who witnessed this muttered, "What an idiot!"  *  (Normally I  abhor  men who carry giant golf umbrellas on rainy days but for once I was glad that my boss is one of them!)

       ON MY MP3 PLAYER TONIGHT    So play me the song That makes it so tough Another nail for my heart        I guess those lyrics *could* be meaningful to me, given that my ex-boyfriend's now engaged to another girl (he met her online at  urlLink Jdate !), and how a lot of songs remind me of "us"  (primarily saccharin and sappy love songs about being jilted and anything by Talking Heads or David Byrne which aren't particularly sappy but about weird, nonsensical things, which pretty much sums up my relationship with R.) ; but actually, I just like "Another Nail For My Heart", so fuck my ex and his large, overly-bleached teeth.  He never liked "Squeeze" anyhow, so screw him.  Not that you even care, judging by the lack of comments to my infrequent posts.  I'll admit they haven't been very entertaining, enlighting or informative.  I've just been so busy watching "American Idol", "The Bachelor" and "The Swan" (and other reality t.v. shows) that my brain has turned to tofu, which has affected the quality of my posts (although they have remained high in protein).  I'm glad these shows are ending soon; now I can resume feeding my cerebellum with literature, current events and my eclectic collection of mp3's and compact discs (which have begun gathering dust!)  This week's highlights:  1) Four weeks to the day we took him to the hospital,  urlLink Todd  is back home!!! Visit  urlLink his blog  and post a "shout out". 2) I bought a George Foreman grill!!  Lunch tomorrow: grilled tofu and veggies.

       CALGARY = 0 / TAMPA BAY = 0   I'm watching the Stanley Cup playoffs.  One of the announcers is wearing a horrendous double-breasted, pin-striped suit and is sporting an exquisite mullet (unfortunately, not visible here in all of its glory.)       Despite that, and the fact that there's no score in the second period, I'm quite enjoying the game.  I've been a Philadelphia Flyers fan since I could walk but since they're not contenders this year, I'm rooting for the Flames for the sole fact that they have prettier uniforms than the Lightening.  And, from what I can tell from the aerial shots as they cut away to commercials, Calgary looks like a lovely city.  I'll be visiting there in two weeks and am looking forward to getting  oot and a-boot  and exploring.  Then it's off to New York the following week.  (NYC Bloggers, watch  owt !)   LOS ANGELES = 47 / MINNESOTA = 59   Forget the Stanley Cup... I forgot it's the final Western Conference game and the Lakers are in dire need of another  urlLink athletic supporter  (and I'm oh-so-stylish!)

       NOW EXPERIENCING TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES      I'm still having trouble logging into my Blogger account.  Each time I've entered my user name, I've received a "User Name Unknown" error message.  Blogger Support has sent me instructions on how to retrieve my user name and assign a new password.  It works for one single session but when I navigate away from my page and try to log in again, I'm faced with the same problem.    Blogger Support wrote,   "This appears to be a problem specific to your browser.  If you have already checked the browser settings as indicated in the previously sent article, you may want to try using a different browser to see if your problem continues."    WTF??  Does this mean I have to get a new browser?  I'm also experiencing this problem when I attempt to log in on my office computer.  If anyone out there has had a similar experience and has a suggestion, please post it here.  Otherwise, my blogging days may very well have come to an end!  Thanks!

       THE TOURIST!!       U.S.A.!  U.S.A.!!   I neglected to bring a backpack for all of my crap, so I carried my belongings in a "Roots Canada" shopping bag.  The sole American on Short Bus #3  (sans helmet) .  All the Canadians laughed and applauded  (i.e., jeered and heckled)  as I boarded the bus bound for our company's Day of Fun in the foothills of the Canadian Rockies.  (Notice my shit-eating grin.) My God, how embarrassing!   (Note: Take a good gander at the Gap jean jacket that I've got tucked in the crook of my right elbow: it's the last time you or I will ever see it.  I lost it somewhere along the journey and haven't seen it since.  I think a Rocky Mountain Sherpa adopted it.)   Upon arriving at the ranch where our activities commenced (rafting, riding, golf, and yoga for the lazy), I discovered that my beloved digital camera wasn't working. Scott tried to fix it, to no avail.     The afternoon before, I'd carelessly attempted to shove a new memory card into it and bent the pins.  Estimated repair cost = $115+.  Hopefully, I'll get it back by tomorrow in time for my next adventure: traveling to New York on Thursday to visit my dear pal Theresa!  I'll only be there for three days but there are some NYC bloggers I'd like to meet:  urlLink this person  (who inspired my blog),  urlLink this mensch  (he adopted me as his surrogate big sister,  urlLink this doll  (a woman with toast issues),  urlLink this one  (can't watch VH1 without seeing his talking head on "Best Week Ever")... and  urlLink this one  (apparently, a fellow traveler on the Bipolar/ADD comedy circuit).

WHY I WAS IN CALGARY   The interactive agency I'm employed by hosted an annual "Town Hall" meeting and "Day of Fun" summer event (white water rafting, horseback riding, golf, a rodeo that we got to participate in!). This week-long extraveganza brought together all of the employees in the U.S. and Canada who have contributed to the success of our firm and celebrated our work, our clients, and reinforced the culture of our agency. We convened in a large theater at the base of the Calgary Tower to view funny skits and videos featuring various departments and themes (and, not surprisingly, *hockey*), and received information from our executives on the State of the Company.  Then we drank troughs of Canadian beer.

       REFLECTIONS ON NEW YORK   Ah, New York City!  I hadn't been there since 1997, so my trip last weekend was long overdue.  I'd forgotten how much there is to see and do, even on a limited budget.  Being with good friends, both old and new, really makes the exhaustion of traveling again after a week in Canada (with only two days home in between) well worth it.  I truly felt creatively inspired for the first time in ages, and I took over 300 images on my digital.  Here's one:    Taken during a gallery walk in the Meat Packing District.

       KEEP YOUR FETUSES TO YOURSELF!  "Would Jesus use bloody pictures to make His point?"       This kind of thing really pisses me off!  I was leaving work the other day and was visually accosted by hundreds of  urlLink Face the Truth  Pro-Life activists propping up larger than life billboards with photographs of aborted fetuses as part of their so-called "Life Tour Blitz".  Some even went so far as to wave the U.S. flag and brought their small children to help drive home their "point".  I was appalled and disgusted, not just by the imagery but by the audacity of these religious freaks shoving their one-sided beliefs in my face.  I'm an American, and our freedom to express our opinions is what makes this country great (after all, isn't that the reason for the holiday we celebrated just last weekend?). However, I found it somewhat akin to being assaulted.  Assaulted by hypocrites who would just as soon bomb a Planned Parenthood office in the name of J. Christ.  I visited their website just now and came upon this article which is so ironic, I'm still laughing... and still shaking my head in disgust!

       MISTAKEN IDENTITY   I was sitting at a bus stop after work last Tuesday evening, contemplating my grocery list for my trip to the market on my way home when suddenly, I sensed that someone was staring at me. I looked up and directly across the street, my attention was drawn to a skinny guy in a dirty t-shirt with a greasy mullet standing beside the bed of a pickup truck parked on LaSalle Street at rush hour.    My eyes met his from across the street and he waved at me, emphatically, with a big, snaggle-toothed grin on his face.  I thought, "Ohmigod, why am I always being courted by *these* kinds of men?"  (and quickly looked back down at my grocery list) but when I pretended I hadn't noticed him, he waved frantically, winked and hooted at me.  I turned to the "zoftig" woman with Rubenesque proportions sitting beside me on the bus stop bench and said,  "Sometimes, I get so discouraged!  Where have all the gentlemen gone??"  She replied that occasionally, when she takes the train instead of the bus, she sees senior couples holding hands and wonders what it must be like to be married for so long and still be so much in love.  Then I realized that perhaps this greasy, mullet-sporting guy was wolf-whistling at the woman beside me and not your's truly!! And I hoped that was the case, because every mis-matched sock has a worn-out but still-sturdy shoe (or so I've been told by my mother).    And then I felt guilty for being so presumptuous.

       MAKING NEW FRIENDS   Is difficult.  I went to a birthday bar-b-que tonight, looking for love or at least a few new friends... I met two female dominatrixes, instead.  ("Oooh, nice corset!")

         LINGUIST LOG       &nbsp;   I thought *I* was the only one easily annoyed by the combination of inappropriate cell phone behavior coupled with poor grammer.     &nbsp;   Apparently not... there's&nbsp; urlLink a Blog   &nbsp;dedicated to the singular topic of grammatically-challenged phrases and mis-used language (and  urlLink this post  about idiots on cell phones at the gym!&nbsp; Click on "Continue reading  'Calling Samuel Beckett' ".)&nbsp;     &nbsp;   (P.S.  urlLink Jodi , I think you'll appreciate the cell phone post.)     &nbsp;   (P.S.S. Here's a link to a  urlLink Chicago Tribune article  on Language Log but you'll probably have to register to view it.)

         MR. BUCK NAKED      Date/Time: Tuesday, July 27, 2004 @ 6:45 p.m. CST  Place: Lincoln Park Jogging Path  Subject: Nude Man in Bushes     Message:  I was a quarter mile into my evening run when a large, naked man suddenly emerged from underneath a copse on my left. My eyes met his (*ahem*) large member (and a fine specimen it was, indeed, not that I was staring; it was just so... apparent!) The man began performing what could best be described as a bodybuilder's posing routine and when he turned around and bent over to stretch his hamstrings, I shuddered and picked up my pace, eyes closed.   I came upon a group of softball players and asked to borrow a cell phone from a young woman.   311 Non-Emergency call center operator:  "311, how may I help you?"    Vendela:  "Um... there's a large, naked man hiding in the bushes by the Lincoln Park softball field at North Avenue."    311 Non-Emergency call center operator:  "Okay, we'll send a squad car out there. What is he wearing?"    Vendela: "Why, his birthday suit, obviously!"

        THIS SUCKS!        I've phoned the manager of my building  twice  about my spider problem and she has yet to return my calls.&nbsp; So, if there are no further posts here from now on, you'll know that the spiders have won by capturing me in their web and consuming me by sucking out my life's blood (type O+, the Universal Donor).&nbsp; If nothing else, it will make for an interesting obituary...    (...and I still don't have comments, either!)

         MONEY FOR NOTHING        and my tunes for free?              Woo hoo! I've been selected to participate in an interesting focus group. This one's on downloading music off the internet, one of my favorite pasttimes (I'm currently trying to collect all of   urlLink  Pet Shop Boys'    bootleg "Aurally" remix tracks.) I found the ad for the focus group on   urlLink  Craigslist   . This focus group is a 2.5 hour discussion with 10 people at the Hancock Building in the evening at 7 p.m. and pays $100 (and free sandwiches!) I've got the sense that I'll be the only 40-year-old female in a group of 20-something frat boys but I'm confident that whomever the client is (  urlLink  iTunes   ?) will find my input very enlightening, particularly since I was once known as The  urlLink Napster  Queen at marchFIRST, a dot com I used to work for in 2000.    (p.s. Lest you think I'm infringing upon artists' copyrights, I occasionally pay for my mp3 downloads.)

        T O  D  D ' S   B  A  C K !        And my boi is in fine frog-hopping form! He gave Woody and me quite a scare  urlLink back in April  when he was so sick and in the hospital for a month. We weren't really certain what the future would hold... but he's home now and has resumed blogging and leaving little gifts at my doorstep (thanks for the apple, T!)  So, go over to  urlLink Todd'sSpot  and drop him a comment or two!
