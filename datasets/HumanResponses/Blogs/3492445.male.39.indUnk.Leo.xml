      Smile and tap your feet!        HOW TO STAY YOUNG      Remember, there is no way you can look as bad as that person on your drivers license.  1. Throw out nonessential numbers. This includes age, weight and height. Let the doctors worry about them. That is why you pay them.  2. Keep only cheerful friends. The grouches pull you down.  3. Keep learning. Learn more about the computer, crafts, gardening, whatever. Never let the brain idle. " An idle mind is the devil's workshop." And the devil's name is Alzheimer's.  4. Enjoy the simple things.  5. Laugh often, long and loud. Laugh until you gasp for breath.  6. The tears happen. Endure, grieve, and move on. The only person who is with us our entire life, is ourselves. Be ALIVE while you are alive.  7. Surround yourself with what you love, whether it's family, pets, keepsakes, music, plants, hobbies, whatever. Your home is your refuge.  8. Cherish your health: If it is good, preserve it. If it is unstable, improve it. If it is beyond what you can improve, get help.  9. Don't take guilt trips. Take a trip to the mall, to the next county, to a foreign country, but NOT to where the guilt is.  10. Tell the people you love that you love them, at every opportunity.  11.  Don't sweat the petty things and don't pet the sweaty things. AND ALWAYS REMEMBER: Humpty Dumpty was pushed!   If you don't send this to at least 8 people.... who gives a flip??                                         Have a Great Day!!!!  ---Despite the high cost of living, it remains very popular.    Greetings Friends,  These seem to be particularly cogent points as I approach the sheer cliff of extreme old age commonly known as "40 and over". I think all the humor is nonquestionable, but I hear that discernment in this area is one of the first things to go....   Or maybe it just comes from being on the wrong side of the world. That's even worse than getting up on the wrong side of the bed!   I would wish everyone a great day "back in the States", but we learned about an hour ago that President Ronald Reagan died today. President Reagan was my first living political hero and the first president for whom I was able to cast a vote. Everything I have read and learned since has only impressed me more with his character, intelligence, common sense, leadership abilities, his faith in God and his personal humility. His faith in the American people undeniably changed our national history for the better. His dedication to life-long learning and his philosophical soul-searching which lead him to switch from the Democrat party (which had leaped into the socialist abyss and continues deeper therein) to become the conservative leader that shaped the modern Republican party, are also worthy of admiration.  George Washington, a Founding Father and presidential precident setter, was our greatest president in character and purpose. Abraham Lincoln, greatest in the 19th century. Ronald Reagan, greatest in the 20th.   FDR lost the 20th century for violating Washington's 2 term precident (how arrogant! - probably got that from Teddy Rosevelt whom I admire except for this seeking the third term) and for pushing our republic down the socialist path. And from thence we can date the "mainstream" media's socialist bent.  Well sorry for the pedantic digression there. Another sign of approaching old age!  From the "Sandbox"....
