      Dear Journal, &nbsp; Good morning. I have another day of work ahead.&nbsp; It's amazing to me that my sleep has been so rejuvinating to me this week. I have such a positive outlook when I wake up each morning. I crave what the day has to offer to my being.  &nbsp; Breathing more deeply, have I been doing. Refreshing it is to fill myself with calming breath. I'm performing my tasks with a much greater ability. &nbsp; I had a very interesting phone conversation yesterday. I was initially greeted with such an uplifting spirit. Normally, that is not the case. But yesterday was very refreshing. Were they glad to hear from me? I think so. They must have gotten laid...that solves everything :D Of course, that is almost a distant memory to me&nbsp;:D I wish I had someone to "make precious love" to me. Someone soft, gentle, and patient enough to take time to&nbsp;experiment and share openly. Good luck, huh? :D &nbsp; Off to work, I must be. &nbsp; With love, &nbsp; BLG&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Dear Journal,  &nbsp;  Today has started off wonderfully. Restful, quick sleep; entering sunshine on my day.&nbsp; I have been invited to go out with the girls tonight from my second job. It's going to be a great day!! I am blossoming. I've also lost a couple pounds this week. I've been working hard and it feels great.  &nbsp;  Last night we had a great class. It still seems strange to me that my instructor never gives me any advice, only gently nods of approving feedback while he spends so much time with everyone else reinforcing strokes, etc. My humble confidence&nbsp;continues.&nbsp;Even stranger, someone who is close to graduating in our class has to turn to me to be able to utilize the lesson effectively. It feels great to have the "best" and the prettiest of the group turning to me for guidance and tutelage.  &nbsp;  I'm looking forward to some free time for myself and the children Sunday. I found some great books on sale at work yesterday that I'm truly looking forward to burying myself in to relax.  &nbsp;  Thank you for my peaceful heart, my grateful existence, my energy from you, my universe. Thank you for letting "him" connect with me again to renew my strength in bonding and relinquish my ties to subtle solitude.  &nbsp;  With love,  &nbsp;  BLG

      Dear Journal,  My heart guides me to continuance. Thank you for the closeness.  Today will be a great day. Off to delve into the books I go. With a new outfit, a new outlook, and a happy, giving heart.   Open to your true essence.  Love,  BLG  P.S. Class went really well last night. We practiced some openers and myofacial warming to prepare for deep tissue. I got to be the body. Our teacher is so talented. I wish he would embrace it more willingly. It's funny how he worked with everyone else last night except me. His observations were satisfying I hope. I shouldn't doubt myself. I know he was pleased.

      Dear Journal,  I started my new 2nd job yesterday. I went to college years ago to train to be a bookkeeper, but now I'm a "Book Keeper" in a literal sense of the wordage. The first thing my new supervisor asked me was, "Do you like to read?" My heart climaxed with excitement!! I crave knowledge and find it quickly in books, even though I use several avenues to broaden my erudition.   My new job is very satisfying, so the 70 hour work week in combination of all my jobs is a contributor to the satisfaction of my soul. Not to mention my education. I have been blessed with a reason to enjoy my lassitude.  One of my friends gave me a satisfying trapezius relaxation last night during our class break. Lifting all those books yesterday played a number on my postural muscles. I am excited to have such a physical job and thank heavens for the maintenance of massage.   Speaking of our break in class...we were supposed to watch a medically related video last night.  The wrong video was in the case, so while she was out making copies, instead of learning proper handwashing techniques we learned how to give a personal test. and breast exam.....why do these things seem to always happen to me?!!  I got to see "him" last night. He's had a haircut that looks very nice on him. Of course, he's ever beautiful.  His hair is so soft and thick and full of tortoise shell colors. I've missed him terribly. I have so many things to tell him. At least his eyes sent me the guesture of happiness to have me in view for just a moment.   It's amazing to be able to feel happiness, sadness, longing, and desire all within the same realm of time within my being. Today I will be content; at peace with all that has come into my presence. I still have an unsatisfied need that I must ask my heart to guide me through. Asking continuance? Asking release? Only time will tell the nature of what I can endure through this lonliness. Have patience, your breath containing compassion and joy. Find a way to release your love so not to overfill your heart. Make room for the emptiness you must maintain to be ever flowing. Can I not say, I love him? For within that is such power to let go. To become a more loving creature of the universe. Your love, may you spread wide and far to the depths of all hearts who may share in your passion.  With love,  BLG

      Dear Journal,  Tomorrow starts a new day in my forward forging life.  It signifies direction, determination, and desire to have peace that has gone too long out of my reach.  My heart feels it within my grasp when I am within the things I am most passionate about.   Take care of my heart, my head, my hands, my loved ones. Bringing me to peace...I reach for you, my star.

      Dear Journal, &nbsp; This has been an awesome day!! I got brownie points with my new boss, the Head Man!! He's new too, so he's being very strict on everyone to scare them I suppose. Authority doesn't intimidate me, I've always identified,&nbsp; felt equal. We have to share a sales story with him everyday. He printed mine out and sent me a reply letting me know he'd help me in all my ventures. I also gave him a very useful sales suggestion. He ate that up!!&nbsp; He's also very chipper in the morning. He's not single or available though.&nbsp; I need to behave myself. It feels great just to be a single lady again. My best friend has spread the word already that I'm single again. I'm not interested though. I'm going to focus on my children, my school, and my work. I'll just be a mistress on the side...:D &nbsp; Gotta run and baby myself. My Osha class is over so I'm going to relax and finish my book. &nbsp; Love, BLG

      Dear Journal,   I'm home from one job, accomplishing a few tasks before I leave for my next one.   I had a really bad day yesterday. I should have journaled this out last night, because I had nightmares all night long. I felt so disconnected from myself. My smile was so hard to find. I took time for myself that morning, but it seemed nothing went right from the time I stepped outside my home. By the time I got to work I was in a sourpuss mood.&nbsp; I know it's time for my monthly pms, but I usually have more control over it that I did yesterday. I felt like a negative magnet yesterday. I'm so glad that day is over!! My coworker pissed me off and I let her know about it, I parked in the "wrong" parking space and had to move, I forgot about our sales meeting, it took forever to get things accomplished yesterday, I kept dropping everything (thank goodness nothing was breakable), I was triply exhausted when I got home last night. Then my ex starts in how he doesn't want to go home, just let him stay. How he's so in love with the "old/new" me. He doesn't realize how he stifled who I really was for 9 years. Without him, I am able to express freely without bondage and criticism. We go through this every time he stays with the kids while I'm gone, but I just didn't feel like hearing it last night.&nbsp; I was a total bit@# at work and at home yesterday. I was really pissed because the side that my classmate worked on versus the side that my instructor worked on was very swollen. Only a couple people noticed that I was ill, so most of it was internal dialogue. I tried to be positive, but to get through the day only, was a challenge. I did make it through, and that's the important thing. Life goes on whether we sweat it out or not. It is passed and over with and no more time shall I dwell. My time is worth devoting to comforting and nurturing my positive energetic efforts.   I did go and see my hairdresser on lunch yesterday. She has opened her own salon. She's invited me to rent a room from her when I get my license. I've had several other offers here in town,but I know her establishment is where my journey needs to begin.&nbsp; It's right on Broad St., the heart of the city, plenty of parking, I've known her for 9 years and she's known for not being your typical "gossiping" cosmotologist, she's very professional and brings in the "big time" clients. What really sold me on her new place (teary eyes) was when I walked in the front door, the whole place has a beach design&nbsp;theme. My heart often tries to carry me back to the time when I had my first awe inspiring moments there. The walls are alternately done in ocean blue and sandy brown. One wall has been painted to look&nbsp;like you're under the ocean. Huge seashell spiral chimes are hung in each corner. Fishnet and starfish are on the upper ceiling.&nbsp; She showed me&nbsp;the room for rent. I'm the only one who will have a "room".&nbsp; It's quietly placed right beside the bathroom. It's a&nbsp;large room with new berber carpet that looks like sand. I would want to keep the beach theme in there&nbsp;even though I ultimately want an oriental theme when I find a permanent place of my own,more like a holistic healing theme.&nbsp; What's so strange is my deep tissue instructor's office is done with the beach theme also. It feels right and I wouldn't have to work for anyone, I could come and go as clients demand. She told me anytime I needed practice on anyone she has plenty of client volunteers. If they could only count toward my school hours. She's going to be very good for my business. I found out&nbsp;yesterday that they are no longer doing Massage Therapy at the hospital here in town anymore. They are too short handed&nbsp;in the physical therapy side, so they had to&nbsp;take that part out. Hmmm.   I'm thankful for the opportunities that have arisen in my life. I feel immense power resonating within my mortal nature. My heart slowly heals with scars that form a net for all the things&nbsp;that I shall capture to&nbsp;bring&nbsp;the expression of my true self. &nbsp;   With love,   BLG

      Dear Journal,   I've had a wonderful morning to awaken my inner self; an hour of Qigong, 30 minute soak, and reflection time. I like having at least one morning a week to go in later..not to sleep in, but to enjoy the world again on my terms. Besides, class ran late last night. I didn't leave until 22:00. My instructor was more himself last night at least. He actually taught class and caught us up to chapter 6 (even though I've practiced thru 7..he's catching up with me :D)   I got to be the body again. :D The older lady in our class got to finish my left side.."bless her heart." I love her, but I can't see her as a LMT. I know she means well, but she has no finesse. She couldn't breathe, that's a big contributor. I helped her though. I should have given her massage first. It's amazing to have her strongly wheeze with every breath and do a little deep tissue and it helps all that gunk out.&nbsp;   My focus will be to continue to let go and release my helping hands to do their duty.   With love and living,   BLG   P.S. I enjoyed the clinic yesterday. The girls at Classic Cuts are already calling me their new Massage Therapist, even though I haven't even done any there. I go in their to get my hair done and she introduces me to everyone. She so sweet.&nbsp; She wants me in their open house picture. I'll have to make up my mind about that one, and think about the legalities. I don't want to get in trouble before I start.   I also enjoyed seeing my heart's desire. It was wonderful just to be in his presence.   &nbsp;

      Dear Journal,   I've been away for a few days. Work has consumed my time the past few days. I've had some reflection time today that I have thoroughly enjoyed.   So much has happened in the past few days. My home improvement project has begun. I'm planning on painting the walls satin white and decorating Oriental style. I'm even planning to paint my waterbed white with oriental writing on it.&nbsp; I'm even going to paint the glass inserts on the headboard's side cabinets. I've turned the center into my bookshelf for all the reading material I've acquired. I've found a lot of reading on Eastern Philosophy and psychology.   I found a new water fountain today, copper with lights around each tube that water flows out of.&nbsp; I also found some oriental pillow covers with an endless knot and the jade eternity circles. Beautiful!! I feel such creative energy flowing. Passion and peace touch me, not sparing their essence.   I've also enjoyed my hands on class this past week. It still ceases to amaze me that my instructor never feels the need to guide me in my studies. He hovers over everyone else. From time to time I'll feel his eyes onlooking in approval and amazement. He's encouraged my working in the clinic. In turn that gives me strength.   My new job is quite amazing. Several people got hired the same day as I did. They all have one place only to work. Yet, they have cross-trained me in several areas, and Saturday my supervisor simply said, "I can trust you to move back and forth between departments and do what you need to do. Feel free to go where you feel you're needed. I know you know what you're doing and know you will work." Can we say, Oh Yeah!!   The VP of our company has since amazed me even more this week since my business suggestion and heartfelt story. I let him know that I was teaching myself a second language and he sent his encouragement a few days ago. But the kicker that really impressed me was even after he had done all that, two days later he sends his personal secretary down to the floor to deliver a card to me. It was a&nbsp;handwritten thank you letter for embracing the Spanish community and that he intends to assist me in all my endeavors. Hmmmm. We have security cameras everywhere that the managers watch at their office and he has his in his office. I know he wanted to see me open it, but I waited and opened it on my way home. It's so flattering to have these occurrences in my life. I'm very thankful.   I have had many blessings in my life since my divorce. Everything is final and I'm very secure. Friends have flocked by my side and I've made many more new friends that I would have never been allowed to spend time with otherwise. I have a love to share with, no strings attached. My children are happy and are positively expressing themselves. Things are so alive in my eyes. Beauty is all around me, even in my most challenging moments.   May my life encourage others to free themselves from the bonds that stifle their creativity toward the culmination of their purpose. My purpose is to love freely, to live with passion, to have all I need, and share the rest. To enjoy the moon, to gaze beyond the stars, to embrace the one who equals me, to experience all that I have yet to live, and work until I move from this world doing what I love.   Peace,   BLG

      Dear Journal,  Once more before I go to bed, I will share with you the greatness that shines on me.  I let my children stay up late to stargaze with me tonight. Crisp and clear could we see so many constellations, the moon so big and bright. I enjoy reaching beyond the stars, especially with the one's I love.  I did have an awesome occurrence today that I failed to share with you earlier. Wed. as I was thinning out my Mexican Sunflowers I observed a krysallis hanging from a tree that I attempt to uproot every year from my flower garden. Yet it always comes back. In all my many years out in nature I have never seen, up close, the krysallis of a catepillar's life cycle. Of course I've seen it in books and on television and studied about it in grade school, but never have I witnessed it until now. I have checked it everyday since I first found it and today it had been emerged from.  Why does that tree come back every year despite my uprooting? Was it meant to be there for this krysallis to form? Was it meant to show me that the catepillar and I are in the same stage in our life? That I was once a catepillar and as I found days before, have I been in my krysallis stage to emerge now as a beautiful butterfly? I think so.  With love,  BLG

      Dear Journal,  Today has been bittersweet. I had a lot on my mind last night. I wanted to vent; however, couldn't seem to find the words to express my mixed feelings. Some of anger, some of betrayal, some of hurt, some of sorrow, some of uncertainty. After a deep meditation my mind cleared to help me see my true feelings and the ripples on the water that I face. So many times I turn a blind eye to what I don't want to see. Strengthening the walls around my heart is the common goal. Since my expansion of mind and self I have decided that it is more beneficial to my heart if I go ahead and proceed with the risk that may cause my heart pain or grief. Key word "may". Some of this, I do control. For not all things should I be sorrowful about when my heart is full of compassion, not connection.  My ripple is my female instructor of the department. I may have to say something to her if she crosses me once more. I see clearly what I've so long ignored. I don't know exactly why she transgresses against me. When we had Anatomy Lab together she was so supportive and hooked on my journal like it was her daily fix. Even still, almost every time we meet she says how she wished she could still have my journal. I'm at a point now where I don't want to honor those wishes. I feel she is not trustworthy and her reason for wanting my journal is to be inside my world so she can be in constant awareness of my activities, not of bonding. The intent I feel resonating from her heart is not love or caring as it used to be, it is a great jealousy and aloofness that I feel her projecting toward me. Everything changed between us as soon as I left my husband. I spend time talking to everyone I pass, female students and male. However, when a conversation begins with a male of the group she seems to makes every effort to step in and end it prematurely...like she's running me off from what is hers. Territorial? Queen Bee syndrome? Maybe. Never-the-less, her intentions are not pure. I know I am a sexual person and often come across bolder than I choose with males that I am comfortable expressing around, but when you are simply asking, "how are you, what has gone on in your life lately?", things of that nature, I feel no sexual innuendo, yet I feel she thinks that much of me.  Some examples are, when the other male in my deep tissue class and I are having a basic conversation in the waiting area before class, seconds after it begins (even though she is supposed to be teaching class, she'll come out and make a distraction). She always pulls him away, whether it be to take him outside to talk or to do massage on her, even after class I see in her eyes the wanting that she wants me to leave, she'll stand right by him, closed, until I do.  Even still, the one time I get to catch up on "music man's" life she comes right out and tells me to walk her to the other building in a tone like she had something to discuss with me...right in the middle of our conversation! I should have told her no, but was quite interested in what she wanted to discuss as she has been so uplifting to me in the past. Petty, that's all it was. Petty questions, prys and negativity about the custody decision that was mine to make. "You're going to regret sharing custody"...I'm very sorry she's having difficulties, I wish I could make it go away for her; that has no bearing on whether it will be a regret of mine. My decision was made with an open heart and willfull trust in myself. I do not, nor will I ever regret my decision. On the other hand, her interruptions in my conversations must stop. I would never think for one fraction of a second about having a sexual moment with any male student in the entire campus. None of them could handle me or keep my attention from what I search for.  She insulted me outright last week. Our little red headed gypsy student stood up for me before I could defend myself. The female instructor and her friend that has experienced great loss in her life were talking about the one who's had great loss's, black scrubs. The instructor states, "I used to wear red and black all the time, but I would NEVER wear that now! I am soooo passed that stage in my life", then raises up to look at me. I was wearing a beautiful red summer sweater with very elegant black dress pants! It felt so good to have on. Sweet little gypsy girl pipes up before I could tell the instructor why I chose red. She says, 'but doesn't red mean your passionate or powerful or something?" I let her know the importance of red and what it means in terms of the Chakras like she was questioning.  Last night was beyond my toleration level. She was so fake last night. I did not know who was in her body, but it certainly was not her. She never acts that way unless she's around our director, like she's hiding her faults from him. Whatever is going on between those two is none of my business, but once again she tries to outwit me, another personal attack. I do not choose to play games. I already know, so why should you try to wear your mask in front of the person who feels your heart before your eyes? She consumes herself with the man in our deep tissue class and our instructor when the director is not present. Yet, he steps in and now she dare not misbehave? I know her mischievous ways as she knows mine. She gives me a stern look when I make an appt. last evening with the male in our deep tissue class. I wouldn't dare make it with anyone else in that class. I'm also hurting, I did not get worked on last night, I want to help him get his hours as I want others to help me get mine, I am touch deprived, the touch I have received in class has been very unsatisfying and nonproductive, I know he can be deep like I need, I know my special one is in pain and wouldn't dare ask for him to give to me in his time of trial, I want to be worked on so I can be in better shape the next time my special one and I have time together, you see? And yet, she does not. She walks out the door making sure I know she is to leave, I stay in conversation with the man of the deep tissue class hoping my special one will soon retire for the evening so that I may simply say goodnight. I turn around and she's snuck back in there...just as before. Like afore mentioned, it's none of my concern on their behavior behind closed doors, but tolerate her deception, I will no more. I love her deeply, that's why my spirit is angered so.  If the jealousy in her heart is for me and other male students then she will drown in her negativity for naught, for my concern and heartfelt salutations are for all, female and male. If the jealousy she holds is for the time I share with my special one then she will have her island and make her own there to suffer needlessly. I know what I have to offer him and am thankful for a moment shared with him, even if it ever may be our last. His life belongs to another and I wouldn't dare impose upon that way. I simply enjoy my time with him and grant him peace. Why posses? Why pursue to own another human soul? Are we not keepers of our own way? Can I make you go left? Can I make you go right? Not if you desire your destiny. I can only walk beside you as long as our paths run together.  Be brave my heart for it leads you to uncharted territory. Find your resting place and build your dreams.  Always With love,  BLG

      Dear Journal,  Taken from  Reflections on the Art of Living: A Joseph Campbell Companion .        "Have I ever told you about the ritual in Kentucky where I had to give up seven things? It was one of the most interesting group experiences I've ever had. We were a group of about fourty-nine people in one of those meetings of some society for the transformation of consciousness. Two couples from the University of Vermont, professors and their wives, had arranged a ritual that we were all going to undertake. We were divided into seven groups of seven and told to spend a day thinking of the seven things without which we'd not want to live: "What are the seven things for which you feel your life is worth living?" Then you were to gather seven little objects, small enough to hold in your hand, which were to represent your seven cherished things, and you were to know which was which.        In the evening we went down a wooded road in the dark to the mouth of a cave. The cave had a wooden door on it which could be opened. In front of the door was a man wearing the mask of a dog: Cerberus at the gate of hell. He put his hand out and said, "Give me that which you least cherish." When you gave him one of the little objects you were holding, he opened the door and allowed you to enter.        Then you proceeded forward through the cave, an enormous place, holding the six remaining things you most cherished. On five further occasions, you were asked to surrender that which you least cherished, until you were left with one object that represented what you treasured most. And you found out what it was, believe me. You really, really did. And the order in which you gave up your treasures was revelatory: you really knew what your order of values was. Then you came to an exit, where there were two people between whom you had to go. But before you could go through that guarded exit, you had to give up that which you most cherished.        I can tell you that ritual worked. All of the participants with whom I've talked had an actual experience of  moska,  "release," when they had given up their last treasure. One damned fool was the exception. He did not five up anything. That's how seriously this ritual was taken. When he was asked to give up something, he just stooped down, picked up a pebble, and handed that over. That's the refusal of the call.            ...every failure to cope with a life situation must be laid, in the end, to a restriction of consciousness. Wars and temper tantrums are the makeshifts of ignorance; regrets are illuminations come too late.                The exciting thing to me was the actual experience. It was a feeling of joyous participation. Watching your earlier bondages go really did change your feeling for the treasures you'd given up. It increased your love for them without the tenacity. I was amazed."   Another most excellent mantra taken from this book:        "Vegetarianism        is the first turning away from life,        because life lives on lives.        Vegetarians are just eating        something that can't run away.    I really enjoy this book!! I can't wait to get to Jung's work! For now I'm taking time to get the boys ready for Joseph's kindergarten orientation while I take time out to dance with them to Jimmy Buffet. Ring around the rosies to "Escape" and "If I Said You Had A Beautiful Body" is pretty fun.  With love,  BLG

      Dear Journal,  Before I go to bed, I forgot to tell you the exciting news! The girls at the salon have invited me to go to the beach with them the weekend of Sept. 10th! It's perfect because we'll be done with finals Thurs. It's meant to be. That would be a great birthday present to myself since my birthday's on the 1st day of Sept.! Delayed celebration. I have a lot to celebrate besides my birthday.  I will miss being out of school for 3 weeks. Just more work I can do.  Night,  BLG

      Dear Journal,  It's late so I won't stay long. I've had a long day and need rest to put on a bright smile in the morning. I just had a few things to let go of today.  My ex kept the kids tonight with him because he took an off day tomorrow. He usually comes here when he gets off work and keeps them for me while I go to school, then leaves when I get home. This is the first night he's taken them home with him on one of my school nights. I never noticed before how I could sense my sleeping children's energy when I walked in the door at night. I walked in tonight and there was a complete silence of energy. Of course, the fountains are bubbling, yet the silence beyond was so present.  I had my lonely night a few nights ago. I did have a comfort as I laid down to sleep though. The moon cast it's shadow on my face through my window as I lay there visualizing my goals for the next day then gently passed as I fell asleep. It gave me great calmness.  Class went as scheduled tonight. I left for dinner and came back a little early for class. Our poor instructor must have got a not so satisfying massage today because he asked one of the other students to work on his shoulders again since it was an uneven class. I should have went ahead and did his this afternoon since the other student was so delayed. He agreed. I did talk to him about having a fingernail check next class! This is the third female that has worked on me who needs to cut their nails! I thought she was going to slice me, especially in deep tissue, duh. Cut your nails honey, file those puppies down, something! He needs to cover that in Fundamentals too. Take them step by step on how to clip, file, how far, how often, etc. If their too lazy to do their own they need to pay for manicures!  I had to tutor two of the girls in class tonight. I went to wash my hands after giving my massage and before I could even get naked they called me over there for help. It makes me feel good to help them. I enjoy being in charge and helping others learn. Now that I have my own schedule starting next week I can go back to being a volunteer GED teacher. I got so much satisfaction from the years I taught. The best part was when an older person would come in and want to learn to read. I taught this one man to read a few years ago and he came in one day while I was working at my Father's store and told me he couldn't have gotten this shipping job for $13 an hour to better support his family if it weren't for learning how to read. He brought me breakfast every morning on his way to work to thank me. Of course, I tried to get him not too but he did it anyway. It so warming to know someone is so grateful.  I got asked out on a date this morning by my UPS man that delivers my Mary Kay! He noticed that my ex's jeep hasn't been there in a long time and wanted to know if he had sold it or what. I told him we were divorced and he jumped on the chance. I told him I wasn't ready to start dating ...That's nicer than a flat out "no, I'm searching for my soulmate and you're not it" I suppose.:D  Speaking of seeing people. I really enjoyed having the opportunity to sit down with my special someone today. It was really nice to have a few moments to share and enter each other's world. To sit so close I could feel the warmth and energy of his body. I hope his arm is doing better and he is having a good night's sleep. He must have had a previous injury of some kind that gets aggravated. I notice when I give him massages that I don't get the same response out of his right hand and forearm as I do from the left. Almost like he doesn't have as much feeling, especially in his hand. I know that's a little too observant, but maybe that explains why.  Speaking of strange observations today. As I was giving my massage to my second appt. Today I am working on her hands and she says, "you have a son that starts with the letter J don't you? Something like Jake or Joe?" Now is that not weird!  I need to get some sleep. I could ramble on and on about the wonderful and exciting things that have surfaced around me. I see the world in such different light now. It's amazing the things that occur and coincidences that happen.  I got a true blessing yesterday. Financial aid calls from the school and tells me I have a check from my pell grant. I never get a check from pell grant. I go up and get it and it's just what I needed to get my massage chair and finish buying the children's school clothes like I visualized I wanted/needed. (Which that's one thing my ex hasn't helped me with. I've had to buy all their supplies for all 3 of them and all their shoes, socks, undies, clothes) That's okay though. It gives me strength and empowers me to accomplish even greater things.  Be still my heart for you have been awakened once again today. He has a caring for you that could expand your universes together like no dream could ever imagine. And the sensual pleasure that you'll bring to him will be beyond his wildest subconscious creations. Share your goals, share your dreams, work together to build a path to heighten both your energetic senses and stimulate creativity to culminate your purpose ( or just enjoy sharing your body with him :D).  Take care of my heart, build strong my body, cradle my hands in your healing light, and share my wishes with all those I love. Breathe, nameste.  With love,  BLG

      Dear Journal,  I am having a night alone without the kids tonight. I am so lonely. Trying to stay busy. The thing I miss the most is a warm loved one to cuddle with while I sleep. It's strange how I get so cold at night while I'm asleep, even with a warm comforter and pillows on every side to wrap my arms around instead. I woke up this morning with my 3 year old laying horizontal across my stomach. It was sooo sweet! I must have been really tired, I didn't even know he was there till we woke up.  I've been moving furniture all day, getting ready to start painting next weekend. I think that's why I'm having a lonely night. Something new and no special one here to share it with. It's nice the way I have things arranged. A few things needed moving to encourage better Feng Shui.  I did decide to rent the room at my friend's salon to do my facials in. My entrepreneur spirit has been awakened. I just came to the realization that I can make more money doing Mary Kay 40 hours a week than I can working 40 hours at Owen's Company. I shouldn't doubt myself. I have a covered 8' X 16' wall with awards encouraging the confidence I should have in myself, that I DO have in myself. I brought home a lousy $200 from OC last week for working 40 hours. I can make that in 10 hours with Mary Kay. I would rather be in control of my financial destiny. I'm scared and excited all at the same time. I promised my supervisor at OC that I would hear her part time proposal in the morning. They do not want me to leave. Of course, you know I'm still going to shop there, who wouldn't!! I did get another sign when I walked into the salon yesterday. Margaritaville was playing on the radio, my favorite song. It's been years since I've heard it played on the radio.  I also want to purchase a massage chair. I was in the salon this weekend and one of the prominent ladies from the courthouse that's worked there for 20 years and has a ton of pull said I could practice on her. I could set up a chair in the salon or volunteer at the courthouse while they take their lunch. I'd get a jumpstart on clientele. I have so many goals I want to accomplish.  I may have given up my husband and my marriage, but look how luck has followed me since. I know he was bringing me bad luck because he still has bad luck following him now. He's not a bad person and I'm not saying he deserves it at all, but it's a strange thing to observe. Of course he is getting a brand new home, but he has to have his reclusive Brother to stay with him and cling right back beside his parents where he's always tried to get back too. I love my family too, but I'm too independent to not take the opportunity to move to distant lands if destiny calls for it. I know I don't have the nicest place in the world, but it's mine and I can create and build all that I desire to foster growth in my being. My 5 year goal is to have a small stable with 2-3 appaloosas in the few acres not being used right now. I want to have gone out of the country at least twice by my 5th year. Maybe to visit Vietnam, Stonehenge, or Thailand (your money goes a long way in Thailand!).  In 5 years my oldest will be in high school and my other two boys will be in junior high. I need to be an inspiration to them. Their Father will lead them straight to the mills when they graduate. I want them to go to college and have a career in what their heart desires. I want them to realize their destiny very early in their life or at least not to ignore it like I did when I should have embraced it as a teenager. It feels good to be making my own path now. Getting sidetracked was not a bad thing.  All in all, things are going very well. I may be lonely here at this present moment, but I know that I am in the thoughts of many tonight..my Mother, Father, Brother, Children, Grandmother, Friends, and a Special person that may be far in miles but not in spirit.  I am at peace and will rest well tonight safe in the arms of my pillows. :D Take care of my heart, take care of my hands, watch over my loved ones, and resonate within me your beautiful song.  With love,  BLG

      Dear Journal,  I've had an awesome day. I had my first day at the salon doing facials today. I didn't have that much to do being my first day and all, but the bonding I had with the girls was so worth the down time. I've also bonded with another acquaintance of mine. She's a very unique child of the universe. An ultimate straight shooter. That's what I looooove about the people I choose to be around.  I've forgotten to tell you about a few interesting occurrences besides the ones already mentioned in other journal entries. I had the strangest thing happen to me this weekend. My Mother cooked lunch Sunday and while my Father and I were relaxing on the front porch talking about going up and clearing the trail, our cat of 3 years, Agnes, came up on the front porch in our amazement and jumped right up into my lap, laid down, snuggled against my stomach and let me stroke her beautiful persian fur!! This cat hasn't let anyone touch her in 3 years!! and here she was in my lap!! My Mother calls us in for lunch, while Dad and I sat there quietly talking he mentions we need to go in and before either one of us could move, upon him saying that Agnes jumps down and mosies on her way, like she was responding to what Dad had said. Very peculiar.  I also ran into an old friend of mine last week and he invited me to a seminar that he and his wife do here in town. The registration is 50 dollars and they let me sit in on it for free. It was an awesome seminar on the "family structure of the new age" talking about blended families. They did an extraordinary job! I promised them we'd all get together for coffee sometime, even though I don't do the coffee thing...  How about that storm tonight? I could feel it coming. It revived my energy. I was so tired when I got home today and had so much left to do. I was almost ready to give up on it all when the lightening reenergized my energy field. I feel really great now and will spend some extra time in meditation tonight visualizing my goals.  I talked with one of my friends about one of my goals tonight. I've invited her to come out to my house and explore with me. It's nice to have someone who has dreams for the future to come out and listen to your dreams as well. For so long, being married to the fellow I was, being discouraged about having dreams, him having no dreams himself and not being allowed to have friends to share with was really a building time for me. I needed to hone in on what is really important to me, to assess what I value most in me and around me.  I value the continuity of my existence in this universe, I value my blessed children, I value my mental preparations, I value physical expressions, I value the landscapes that bring me serenity, I value my dreams of my new home for the future and my new stable with my 2 horses, with my new old truck and horse trailer, and my trip to Thailand and Stonehenge, and I value the lives that I will touch with my heart for it is my eyes. Why shall I look with the possessions of my orbits when we already have the ability to visualize with our hearts all we'll every need to hold in our view? My heart has shown me great and powerful things in recent times. Fortunate I feel. Humble to the manifestations that bring to me wonder. Embracing me tightly with it's strength.  I love you,  BLG  P.S. I haven't told anyone I love them beyond my children's ears in a while now. I don't want it to be lost from my lips. Practice it I must for my voice will never grow weak again and yet my ears grow deaf to it's resonance.

      Dear Journal,  Let's work the evening backwards, this time, shall we? I had a beautiful, peaceful drive on my way home from class. As we were leaving for the evening from deep tissue class we had to be aware of the little family of skunks running around. They were really on the prowl. I'm surprised they didn't get in a scuffle with the little kitties running around everywhere.  The President and Dean of the school came to the 6-8 pm class tonight to tell them the schedule plans. They put all the students from both classes in the same room. One class was very lucky they were not out early like usual. I wonder if they were doing work or spending class eating dinner?  Deep tissue went well tonight. We reinforced strokes AGAIN....We're finally having our midterm Thursday. I learned a better way to get deeper. I have been doing it all wrong!! I'm thankful for the breakthrough. I can grow in more areas, I feel, now.  I went to the park between classes and had a nice walk around the lake even though my hamstring group has a great deal of lactic acid build up from this weekend. I've been drinking plenty of water and put biofreeze on them. I'm going to try to get plenty of quick restful sleep tonight.  Speaking of restful sleep..why did my dream bring me a 2 story round home with an overhang deck? Inside, on the top floor there were tables around one side of the room and I was doing a massage there. It was my home. I went downstairs and all my furniture was there, the fridge was stocked with colorful fresh fruit and veggies and my juice. He was with me, walking hand in hand, as we were searching for a place to put in the water wall....At the clinic, the secretary mentions the director has a round home in the works. It doesn't dawn on me until I remembered my dream of which is significant just to have since I only have them after a certain meditation. I disregard what she has said and when she leaves, I start searching for the round home in my dreams on the internet while I have time. I find the one, woody landscape and all, and he comments this is the house he is building; the sight I am looking at with the house from my dream. It's inspiring and confusing all at the same time. Is this dream supposed to mean something? A coincidence? He and I must have some kind of karmic connection. I can't understand why else our destinies would coincide with such similar goals and dreams?  I truly felt his presence within me as his embrace rendered such peace calming my heart. He sent me such great thankfulness, love, and peace. So strong and lasting. His skin felt like silken warmth between my arms. A willful moment in time that will rank ever high amongst my thoughts. But also, as I gave him loving touch today I felt at times my heart pumping with such force it would almost take my breath away. I assessed to see if there were some sort of physical exertion on my part, but it was naught. It only happened at the level of his 7th chakra and his 4th. We have great energy that keeps trying to bond beyond our physical being. One immaculate evening may our bodies be blessed with a shared release of our higher selves to bring understanding and enlightenment to what our energy is trying to achieve. What that energy purpose is, only time will communicate. Be the whale with the rainbow penis :D  I need to run catch some quick sleep. Thank you for the peace surrounding me, thank you for waking up my legs, revive my heart with gentle understanding, and let me touch someone's life forever.  With love,  BLG

      Dear Journal,  I've thrown priority to the wind this weekend and came out on top with invigorating substance.  My children experienced a side of me that left them wanting more. Wanting more life, more happiness, more of their Mother. I let them stargaze with me (something I usually do by myself). We camped out in the backyard Saturday night after the drive-in movie we went to see. They helped me paint my facial room in the salon today after eating lunch with my parents. We danced around the house all evening after one of my friends left!! I found a song I hid from myself on the computer by accident.."I'm Gonna Take That Mountain"..ironic for me to find that this weekend.  I did spend some time facing responsibility, I can't let myself stray too far from it. :D I went to the AMTA meeting Saturday(ended up coming home and joining via internet). The productivity had already been produced by the time I got there, so there wasn't much for me to participate in. It sounded like they had all the fun without me!! Dammit!! :D I did remember something soooo funny. My first volunteering project with MHCA at their first annual conference; the secretary had forgot the nametags and the disc was hundreds of miles away to reprint the nametags, so I took the registration of hundreds of people and stayed up till 4am making nametags for them by hand. It's funny how I got the nametag job at the AMTA annual too. Hmmm.  I stayed after the meeting and worked in the clinic until my 3:30 student massage with the male from our deep tissue class. I've always gotten great "spot" work from him, but his full body massages are not full body, or at least they weren't with me. I told him my problem areas...trigger point in left shoulder/neck, lower back, and calves...and that's all I got. I can understand if you're running out of time skip a part or two...say abdomen, face, breasts (if your fortunate enough to find one who therapeutically incorporates it!! :D) etc. But I was a bit taken back when he did calves, back, sat down to do posterior arm, turned supine and did neck and a stretch then says, "Okay, it's 4:30". Didn't even ground me!!!!! The work he did was very good and did help exactly what I came in for...but geeze, I guess I'm spoiled. I shouldn't be too harsh. I just know how I would have done it if I were him, and it wouldn't have been like that. Oh well, you live and you learn.  My massage chair was waiting on me when I got home. Thank heaven's I didn't have to face the flirtacious UPS man again! Speaking of massage chair...my old job at Owen's Company is still trying to find ways for me to stay with them!! Just work here one day a week they say. We'll find anything for you to do. I told them I might volunteer one day a month to come down there and give them chair massage on their break thinking that would get them off my back. Then they said they had already thought about asking me to come down there and do it for pay. I told them tips wouldn't hurt, but I couldn't do it for pay. They are hilarious!! I'm getting such a kick out of watching them squirm!!  I am so happy tonight. I've got to get in bed! My little ones are starting back to school tomorrow morning. I'm soooo excited! They were all excited to get their teeny bookbags packed and their new outfits all laid out. I gave my boys their little haircuts after dancing so they'd be tired and sit still. They got up half a dozen times before they finally went to sleep though :D. Adorable little angels!! My little girl has already bonded with her new teacher and is so excited to see all her friends! I love my babies. I feel great things are going to happen to us this year.  My poor ex's luck keeps getting worse though. I don't understand it. They did a pert test on his land finally after waiting a month for them to come out. Then the fellow who did it gets in a wreck and it's in his impounded vehicle locked up. Even after they get it, it'll have to stay on the environmental dept's desk for 10 days. They could come out an redo it but the fellows who were doing something on the foundation ran over the holes and damaged what they did.  To beat all that, his truck has been running badly he says. I let him take my car to the store to do my maintenance and I drive his truck without a problem. It ran fine for me. He leaves here the day he brings my car back and breaks down on his way home 3 miles from my house. His jeep has been in the shop for a couple months now. My Father has let my ex and one of his mechanics work on it in there spare time. They finally got it together and my ex engages the locker that broke the first couple parts to begin with and when he went to test drive it every part from the motor back broke including the ones he just replaced!!! The mechanic had it towed to the mechanic's house and said he'll fix it as long as my ex doesn't come near it until he's finished. Sometimes I can't believe what I'm seeing. How could someone's luck go soooooo bad?  I'm thankful for my life that's turned out some incredible fortunes. I'm ready to bring myself to a more heightened awareness. I've enjoyed my body today and want it to experience more of weekends like this. To good friends and great love!!  With love,  BLG

      Dear Journal,  My eyes so want to lower early tonight. I've just had a long aromatherapy soak after a strenuous workout. I still need work on my hamstrings. I did an extra 2 miles on the treadmill tonight aside from my regular 3 every morning, along with my lower body weight training tonight. I followed with some stretches and I was far too tight. I need to find a good pilates program I can do at home or find a good text on stretches. I do feel good though. I feel relaxed and ready for a great night's sleep. Maybe I'll allure an attractive midnight dream. Of course, I think I may be too tired to visit dreamland tonight. I woke up this morning in the same position as I fell asleep in last night.  I've had a busy week though. I deserve to be expended. My first day at the salon was Wed. and from Wed. to Sat. I sold $600 in skin care! I only had 5 clients come in!! The rest of the time I spent letting the girls pamper me. One of the girls waxed my eyebrows and another one of them curled my hair twice this week, next week one of them is giving me and hour and a half long pedicure. We all went out for lunch together this week except Friday. My ex took me out for Chinese to talk about how things are going and we talked about how we are all adjusting now that the kids are back in school. It was funny how we talked about how we weren't compatible and looked on the Chinese zodiac symbols they had in the restaurant and sure enough, we weren't compatible on there either. I'm compatible with a monkey, born in '56. I could have guessed that much. ;) We also talked about his bad luck again. They finally started the interior of the house and when the fellows were painting the walls they spilled a whole bucket of paint on the brand new carpet so now they have to replace the carpet in that room. I wonder sometimes about his magnetism.  I did a lot of free chair massages this week while the girls' clients waited. I have a feeling they are going to keep me busy once I get my license. I talked to one of the girls from a gym in town and their massage therapist quit so she was sending them to the hospital and now all three of them have quit there. One of the good one's here in town got tendinitous and had to have surgery and her doctor told her she can't practice for 3 months at the least! One of her clients is my Mother's best friend. She's been wanting me to practice on her for a while now and since I had my midterms I asked her to be my practice. She came over after work and I did a full hour on her. I was wondering if I would pass her test since she's been to several professional massage therapists, goes on a regular basis until her's had to have surgery, and had that to compare me too. I can't tell you the extent of her satisfaction. She said I was the absolute best out all the one's she has tried thru the years. She tried her best to give me $100. I just invited her to come to Huntsville on my clinic days, if she can get time off work. (She's a mental health therapist.) What warmed my heart is she not only told it to me, she immediately called Mother and told her how proud of me she was and the next morning she bragged on me the whole time on their girl's day out breakfast! My heart is so humbled by her kindness. It really helped getting the deep tissue breakthrough this week. Feeling that I am becoming my destiny makes it so worth what I've gone thru the past few years. I am so grateful.  I also took the kids to the playground where I play raquetball this weekend after work. They have the coolest play equipment there! There's this one piece of equipment that the kids can get on one end and slide down to the other end just like the ropes courses I used to attend summer's as a teenager. It amazing at their strength even though they're so young.  My little girl got to go to a play date Saturday with her best friend while I was at work. Her best friend has my name. The little girl is precious. She's being raised by her grandparents which she calls Mom and Dad. But her real Mother and Father live up North with her two brothers. The parents said they could only afford to raise 2 so they sent the little girl to be raised by her grandparents. Now how much sense does that make? If I can raise 3 kids on my own!! they can raise all 3 kids between both of them!! Maybe she's better off down here with her grandparents. She's a precious child (and she has my name so I have to favor her :D)  I started cleaning out closets and taking all the pictures off the wall. I'm getting ready to start painting. I'm getting excited now. My creativity has been on high frequency the past few days. I have so many ideas. The children are getting excited too. They question me every morning on when we're going to start painting. The boys decided they want a sky mural in their room. They want it with sky and clouds up to the center and blended into the starry night at the top. Now this is coming from a 3 and 5 year old! It's amazing to observe the chakras they are developing now. I'm really going to have to encourage my little girl's spirit. With her being 8 years old now, she has a lot of western beliefs being thrown her way by society now than she has in past years. I'm hoping by giving them the best of both eastern and western philosophies in our home that they will have less energy blockages than I did once I got older. They already know how to meditate, do several yoga poses, the Qigong Wuji short form, they understand the purpose of feng shui, fountains, certain plants, animals, they understand a lot of native American history and drumming. Native American music really seems to inspire my little girl. It' amazing to listen to her sing along in their native tongue. Of couse, this evening, she discovered my Jimmy Buffet song, Volcano. I've put a shortcut on the desktop for her to get to it easily.  A few months ago I was helping my Mother by cleaning her house since she had shoulder surgery; my Father came home for lunch while I was there with my 3 year old. Dad ate his lunch and told my little boy to be real still and quiet for 10 minutes while Pappa went to his meditation place. My little boy gets sweetly close to his face and says, "can I go too Papa?" He realized they weren't "going" anywhere. It was very sweet to have my Father explain to him meditation.  Speaking of meditation, I'm going to retire for the evening and do a little of my own. There's alot more I got to experience this weekend, like making a couple cheesecakes with my little girl, and helping her with her school project of 15 seed variations and 15 seashell variations (of which I can only find 3 different seashells in my house and my friends!!), did lawnwork, and so much more, but I'll save those stories for another time. I really enjoyed staying active this weekend (even though my hamstrings have still given me trouble) and meeting all the wonderful new people that I have and making so many new friends this week. I feel my heart is finally opening and bringing to the world the person who is being held so dear by many. I do miss my love and hope he is well. I send him great stillness tonight as he rests. May his following day go smoothly as the waters of calmness and clarity hand him forth serenity.  With love,  BLG
