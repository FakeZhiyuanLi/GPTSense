						   Unbelievable. Here we are, the LGBT community in the midst of fighting for the right to marry and McGreevy (gov. of new jersey) is running around behind his wifes back with his boy toy. Sheesh. What an idiot.  I would caution all the heteroseuxals out there to realize that just like the heterosexual community, the homosexual community has its members who have low morals and character.  What I want to know is what is his "wife's" story. How can you not know he is Gay!

						   Hmmm. California Supreme court just invalidated the 4000 gay marriages in San Franciso. Sickening. Heteros really need to get a clue and stop discrimination against Gay couples.

      I suffered through the Dodgers getting *hacked* by the Braves (chop, chop). I had to work on my "Required Day Off" :-P and we missed Chris's invitation to Bowl :-(. What a bummer.  On the bright side, tomorrow our architect will be submitting our house plans again for the 3rd round of approvals. Hopefully this doesn't go on for ever. We want our house back.

      The campaign calls? I had three more tonight. One from a group in Omaha and another in South Dakota trying to oust Tom Daschel. The capper where I finally lost it was a call from a right to life group. I asked what name they had on their list and they said "john penn". So either someone has intentionally put my number in as punishment for my speaking out against right wing extremists (the right to lifers, really get me) or there was a true mistake made.

      WASHINGTON (Aug. 19) - The Senate Judiciary Committee heard this morning from one of its own about some of the problems with airline "no fly" watch lists. Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., says he had a close encounter with the lists when trying to take the U.S. Airways shuttle out of Washington to Boston. The ticket agent wouldn't let him on the plane. His name was on the list in error.  After a flurry of phone calls, Kennedy was able to fly home, but then the same thing happened coming back to Washington.  Kennedy says it took three calls to Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge to get his name stricken from the list. The process took several weeks, in all.

      (grumble piss snort) What the hell kind of a list am I on? Did the people monitoring e-mails and websites see my reference for wanting to do away with the Republican party? Is this some sort of punishment for my liberal leanings?  I received ANOTHER phone call from the Repubican party. This time from North Dakota. (It was South Dakota last week). This time someone told me how the jobless rate was the lowest it had been, how the American family was making a come back (did it ever go away?) and that by supporting our President with a financial contribution I could somehow take credit for this. I listened patiently to a 2 minute string of nonsense. I gave them my standard "....as a minority, single mom with 7 kids on welfare I was sure that George Bush was doing everything he could to help me"..I told the man (I think his name was John..not sure since I ignored him) that I could send money after my AFDC payment arrived at the beginning of the month. He said it was great that since the government was helping me that I could help them.  Holy shit! These people are idiots! Does he NOT see how idiotic he is?  Calming down now...really....I am.

      An EXCELLENT post I found on yahoo:   A day in the life of Joe Conservative   Joe gets up at 6:00am to prepare his morning coffee. He fills his pot full of good clean drinking water because some liberal fought for minimum water quality standards. He takes his daily medication with his first swallow of coffee. His medications are safe to take because some liberal fought to insure their safety and work as advertised.All but $10.00 of his medications are paid for by his employers medical plan because some liberal union workers fought their employers for paid medical insurance, now Joe gets it too. He prepares his morning breakfast, bacon and eggs this day. Joe’s bacon is safe to eat because some liberal fought for laws to regulate the meat packing industry.Joe takes his morning shower reaching for his shampoo; His bottle is properly labeled with every ingredient and the amount of its contents because some liberal fought for his right to know what he was putting on his body and how much it contained. Joe dresses, walks outside and takes a deep breath. The air he breathes is clean because some tree hugging liberal fought for laws to stop industries from polluting our air. He walks to the subway station for his government subsidized ride to work; it saves him considerable money in parking and transportation fees. You see, some liberal fought for affordable public transportation, which gives everyone the opportunity to be a contributor.Joe begins his work day; he has a good job with excellent pay, medicals benefits, retirement, paid holidays and vacation because some liberal union members fought and died for these working standards. Joe’s employer pays these standards because Joe’s employer doesn’t want his employees to call the union. If Joe is hurt on the job or becomes unemployed he’ll get a worker compensation or unemployment check because some liberal didn’t think he should loose his home because of his temporary misfortune.Its noon time, Joe needs to make a Bank Deposit so he can pay some bills. Joe’s deposit is federally insured by the FSLIC because some liberal wanted to protect Joe’s money from unscrupulous bankers who ruined the banking system before the depression.Joe has to pay his Fannie Mae underwritten Mortgage and his below market federal student loan because some stupid liberal decided that Joe and the government would be better off if he was educated and earned more money over his life-time.Joe is home from work, he plans to visit his father this evening at his farm home in the country. He gets in his car for the drive to dads; his car is among the safest in the world because some liberal fought for car safety standards. He arrives at his boyhood home. He was the third generation to live in the house financed by Farmers Home Administration because bankers didn’t want to make rural loans. The house didn’t have electric until some big government liberal stuck his nose where it didn’t belong and demanded rural electrification. (Those rural Republican’s would still be sitting in the dark) He is happy to see his dad who is now retired. His dad lives on Social Security and his union pension because some liberal made sure he could take care of himself so Joe wouldn’t have to. After his visit with dad he gets back in his car for the ride home.He turns on a radio talk show, the host’s keeps saying that liberals are bad and conservatives are good. (He doesn’t tell Joe that his beloved Republicans have fought against every protection and benefit Joe enjoys throughout his day) Joe agrees, “We don’t need those big government liberals ruining our lives; after all, I’m a self made man who believes everyone should take care of themselves, just like I have”.

      Hi all,  Since our last Pasadena cinematic outing was such a rousing success (heavy sarcasm alert), I propose yet another. Outfoxed is playing at the Laemmle in Pasadena beginning on Friday night and I would love to go with anyone who wants to join me. The times and details are as follows:  Laemmle Old Colorado One Theaters42 Miller Alley OldPasadena, CA 91103(626) 744-1224Showtimes: 1:45, 3:50, 5:55, 8:00, 10:00 PM (11:40 AM on weekends)  For those of you who don't know, Outfoxed is about the Fox News Network's extreme bias against anything that doesn't fit with the Republican agenda. It's supposedly also very funny.  This time, we should get tickets in advance so let me know if you'd like to go asap. I propose the 8pm showing.  kathryn

      (Aug. 18) -- Thinking about smashing windows or overturning cars during the Republican National Convention? Think again: that will cost you a discounted buffalo chicken salad from Applebee's or a cheaper ticket to see "Tony n' Tina's Wedding."In a transparently mercantile bid to keep protesters from disrupting the Republican National Convention later this month, the Bloomberg administration will offer "peaceful political activists" discounts at select hotels, museums, stores and restaurants around town during convention week, which begins Aug. 29.Law-abiding protesters will be given buttons that bear a fetching rendition of the Statue of Liberty holding a sign that reads, "peaceful political activists." Protesters can present the buttons at places like the Whitney Museum, the Museum of Sex, the Pokémon Center store and such restaurants as Miss Mamie's Spoonbread Too and Applebee's to save some cash during their stay.If only the Romanovs had thought of this."It's no fun to protest on an empty stomach," Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday, when he announced the program at NYC & Company, the city's tourism office, which will distribute the buttons to all comers to its Midtown office.Protesters can also get the buttons from groups that have a legal permit to rally. But Mr. Bloomberg conceded yesterday that not everyone who wore a button would be strictly vetted for his or her peacefulness. "Unfortunately, we can't stop an anarchist from getting a button," he said, though he doubted any of them would want to wear one.The discount program comes at a time when Mr. Bloomberg is under increasing pressure from the largest protest group, United for Peace and Justice, which is demanding the right to protest in Central Park, a request the city has repeatedly rejected. As a result, the city faces the prospect that the largest rally, planned the Sunday before the convention, will be an illegal gathering.A spokesman for the group, Bill Dobbs, dismissed the discount program yesterday as a publicity stunt.The city contends that it wants to give as warm a welcome to protesters as to delegates. "Most times, people try to keep protesters from coming," the mayor said, "and they certainly don't go out of their way to accommodate them."In offering the discounts, the city also has its economy in mind. Officials want to make sure that hotels and restaurants are as fully booked as possible during the convention week; many have reported that reservations are slow for that week.The discount program for protesters is modeled on one for delegates to the convention, and there are some notable differences. Protesters are offered $5 off admission to the Museum of Sex, while delegates are not. The Republicans get "Rent," the people who oppose them get "Tony n' Tina's Wedding."Bloomberg administration officials say the list of offerings for protesters may grow. An up-to-date list appears on nycvisit.com; visitors to the site can click on "Welcome peaceful political activists." There, the discontented but hungry can also find information about the city's history and tour guides for the "politically minded visitor."Mr. Bloomberg also said that the police officers and firemen who had been holding loud demonstrations at his public appearances in the past few weeks would qualify.Yesterday, outside the mayor's news conference, Joe Miccio, a firefighter who came to hector the mayor, fingered the button presented to him by a reporter with some confusion. "We are peaceful political activists," he said, puzzling over the notion of discounted hamburgers and office supplies (at Kroll's Office Products, free magic marker included). "We'll take a look at it."The city says it expects at least 200,000 people - both out-of-towners and aggrieved New Yorkers - to protest around the city between now and the end of the convention on Sept. 2. And, as Mr. Bloomberg pointed out, they will need to eat.With the convention a week and a half away, there are already some who may not qualify for the discounts. Yesterday, four members of Code Pink, a women's protest group, were arrested for trying to dangle a 40-foot-long banner from their ninth-floor window at the Sheraton Hotel across from Mr. Bloomberg's news conference, the police said. urlLink  Jodie Evans, a co-founder of the group, identified the women as Andrea Buffa and Colleen Galbraith of San Francisco, Claire Varoney of Los Angeles and Danielle Feris of New York City. The charges against the women are pending, the police said yesterday afternoon.Gary Ferdman, the executive director of Sensible Priorities, a business consortium, said yesterday that he came up with the idea for the discount program when the city decided it needed to reach out to protesters. "I'm afraid this Central Park thing is really going to blow up," he said after the news conference, perhaps speaking more bluntly than city officials about the motivations for the program.In announcing the program, Mr. Bloomberg was joined yesterday by former Mayors Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins. While Mr. Dinkins said that he might have handled the request to protest in Central Park "differently," Mr. Koch said he agreed with the Bloomberg administration's plan to keep the largest protest off the Great Lawn. That decision has angered many New Yorkers, particularly those who have ambivalent feelings about the convention, which Mr. Bloomberg has repeatedly said will be an economic boon for the city.Among more veteran protesters, the city's offer had a certain appeal. "Since we're both guests, New York City should treat us equally," said Aron Kay, who is also known locally as the Mad Yippie Pie Thrower. Mr. Kay is the organizer of a protest planned for outside Mayor Bloomberg's townhouse on the Upper East Side on Aug 22."Maybe we would like to eat in a restaurant or catch a play," he mused. Before or after haranguing the mayor? "I would say after," he said.

      Just to fill all of you non-Espanol speakers on what happened in class last night:  We learned that the first permanent settlement by non-Spaniards in the Americas was by the Pilgrims in 1620 (NOT! -- it was in 1620, but it wasn't the Pilgrims it was the Jamestown colony).  We learned that every word in the English language, including those words that come from indigenous languages, actually come from the Spanish language, including chocolate (actually Aztec), tobacco (native, but not sure which tribe), potato (ditto), and canoe (ditto).  We learned that 8:15 is really 9:00.  I'm desperately hoping that this teacher is better at Spanish than she is at history (and telling time). Yes, Chris, I know I'm being overly critical, but I don't like it when teachers give their students misinformation. Gotta go register now. Seacrest out.

      So, for a long time, I've wanted to make an online, ongoing list of perfect names for bands. Feel free to contribute in the comments. Let's open with two of them:   Chunky Hummus  Tarantula Pubes   There are excellent stories for each of these, but they may be "You had to be there" moments. So... what are your best (hypothetical) band names?   If you use any of these names in the blog for your band, you have to give us credit. I'm just sayin'.

      Well, he wouldn't have gone to school naked, I suppose. But at least now, he shall be dressed properly in uniform clothing.  I skipped the PTA meeting. I figure that I can find out what the historian does on the next meeting. I went to Target (tar-jay) and after much searching found the last three pair of uniform shorts in size 12. Not only that, they were on sale. Score! And for the 2 point conversion, unifom shirts on sale too! So for under $40 (38.77 I believe) he got 3 shorts and 2 shirts. Now all he needs is the required new school underwear (no, school does not require they be new..I do since the old ones have not been worn by someone who understands wiping ones ass, but that's another post) and he will be good to go.  One another note..Heorge is back..I think I may start enabling him by leaving some veggies so he'll stop chewing on my grass.

      I'm going to take a break from my morning of church politics (I swear that these people are worse than any democrat and republican arguing over Dubya) to tell you about our backyard visitor. On Sunday, my landlord left me a message saying in a whispered voice "I think we've got  bunny, he's (how she knows it's a he is beyond me) sitting on your doorstep sniffing". So I went outside, and I didn't find him. My concern was that he was someone's pet.  So after we got home from Taco Bell Science (the science of tacos!) I saw something speed off behind some bushes. After some searching I saw a pair of eyes sticking out of a bush. I didn't want to scare him, so I just went inside.  I have now seen our little visitor 3 or 4 times. It also explains why our grass is getting so chewed up. When we came home last night, the cute little fuzzy bunny was sitting in the middle of the grass and didn't pay us any attention.  He looks a little darker and a little bigger than a regular jack rabbit or wild rabbit that we see around town, but he also doesn't look like someone's pet.  As for the name? If he sticks around much longer I'm going to have to name him. Harvey, because he's the phantom bunny we know is there, but can't see. Or George, but he's cute and fuzzy and I want to hug him and cuddle him. Except for the rabies he probably has. Oh well.

Yes, I'm asking myself why she called me and what the hell kind of phone list I'm on that I am receiving campaign fund raising calls from South Dakota. Missy, in her very perky voice, went on to tell me that the Republican Party in South Dakota is having a crisis because John Kerry is gaining popularity. She told me how homosexuality is ruining the American family and that only by re-electing a republican to the office of President are we going to save our families. And couldn't I donate something to the cause? She said all of this in one breath and very fast. So.....I told her I was a lesbian, illegal alien, single mom with 5 kids and that if she thought Dubya could help me that I would donate money.  After some silence, she said "Well, have you thought of going to Human Services?".  She didn't see the humor in her statement. So I hung up.

They were hoping that Charley would go north of them as at the most a weak Category 3, but now it looks like Punta is going to take a direct hit at Punta Gorda with Category 4 force. That is completely destructive. Man, I am feeling very, very sad for Ray and his wife right now.

      Tyler made it home from camp today! He's even in one piece with his glasses. I asked him if he showered and he said "yeah, a few times". I'm thinking this is great! A few time in 5 days, I'm happy with that.  He then proceeded to tell me all about the food and how bad some of it was (we're definitely doing Rosie Thai now). Then he slipped into the converation "Oh mom, I'm sorry, but I didn't use the soap, shampoo or washcloth when I showered".  After a few seconds, I asked him if he borrowed someone elses. He said "oh no, but I rinsed off really good". Well, I guess that explains the dirt line around his ankles.

         urlLink  doggin' kat    said... At the risk of sounding naive and gullible, is that what Boba really means? If so, Boba Dom sounds like a great name for our bowling team. (prounounced Boba Dome)Kind of gives the impression of a large sports arena shaped like a breast.     So, we have one name up for vote (which I love by the way). Any others?

       Feather, my boss's cat is driving me nuts. She's in a lovey mood today (which is better than her usual "I want to kill you" mode), and she's chewing on my arms and kneading my legs with her VERY sharp claws. My legs are so clawed up I look like I have some sort of anti-social rash. I'd clip her nails, but I have a feeling that would put her into that "Kill" mode again. Oh well. I guess I should be getting some work done anyway. Ouch! Good day, all.

      Kathryn,  Looks like Charley is going to make a direct hit on Bluffton SC in the next 3 days. Hope your Dad has good flood insurance. Although they may be helped a little cause the storm is coming in over land from the west.

      I am now a professional voiceover person, artist? I can't decide which person sounds better.  Now that I've signed a contract, I don't feel like I'm going to jinx it. I am going to narrarate a children's DVD. Think Blues Clues meets Sesame Street. It's geared for children ages 1-3. It's not a lot of money, but it's experience and a lot of fun. And if for some reason this product really takes off, I get some of the profits. Woo hoo!  Unfortunately, because I had to go to Pasadena last night, I missed my honeydew boba. Damn. That's okay, Tyler comes home tonight and I'm thinking the food hasn't been quite what he's used to, so it's a perfect excuse to go to Rosie Thai. He can eat his favorites, and I can drink my crack.

      Not really a new thread, just a suggestion:  Should there be future outbreaks of boba haiku, I propose a name for this new form of expression -- the Art of Boku.  (Two hakama-clad warriors circle each other in the forecourt of a Shinto temple. One speaks, but his words don't synch with his lip movements -- "Your Boku can NEVER defeat my Boku! Now we must FIGHT!")  As the French say, merci Boku!

      I'm working under the principle that people die in 3's. (it's real, I swear). Two people died last week. Actually one the week before last, one last week and then one this week. Here is my conundrum - since the person who died last week was not technically a member of the church do they count towards the 3 people? Or do I have to hold my breath and wait for the next person who IS a member to die.  At least my speech isn't getting rusty. "I'm so sorry. Is there anything I can do? (insert loved one's name here) was so important to this church" After the 3rd call in one day - "no no, you're not bothering me, that's what I'm here for." After the 7th call " No really..it's okay..I'm here to help you" And after a phone call at home from the pastor telling me about the death "Are you kidding me? Another one? Ah Shit"  Anyhow..if you have input about whether or not I should wait on pins and needles for another one to keel over..I'd appreciate it.

        I am finally at work. Ugh. The appraiser was 30 minutes late. Doubt he was     impressed with the house. Oh well.           Peanut guarded the bedroom viciously. Rrrrrrrrrowwwww!          Back to the real world. :-(

      This is from the same guy as the email I sent yesterday (What Would Atkins Do?) Totally hilarious.    urlLink  defective yeti   : "'Remember a few months ago when I said we'd turned a corner? I wasn't lying, but, before we turned that corner, the economy was going down, right? After the turn we started moving horizontal -- perpendicular to the way we were going before. So if we want the economy to go up, we have to turn another corner, see? And that corner is just ahead.'"

      This is from my calendar of stupid quotes. Enjoy!    I've Been Flushed from the Bathroom of Your Heart    If My Nose Were Full of Nickels I'd Blow It All on You    You Were Only a Splinter As I Slid Down the Benister of Life   and lastly, for Chris:   I Don't Know Whether to Kill Myself or Go Bowling

      Obsessive desire for boba eludes those who have not partaken;  Thai tea suffices when one yet possesses no jones for the boba!  No dreams of peach balls nor Swedish sleep systems can stiffle the TV;  Visco-elastic memory cells invade my late nite sleeplessness...
