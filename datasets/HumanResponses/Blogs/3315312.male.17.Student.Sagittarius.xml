						   I completely agree with Joe about punishing the prison guards (I don't think anyone in their right mind disagrees) I even think the sentence served on spc. Sivits earlier this week (one year in prison along with testifying against other guards) was much too lenient. The soldiers that decided it would be a good idea to pour acid on a prisoner's back or force them to have sex with each other should spend a long, long time in prison. That would also go a long way to convincing the rest of the world that the United States punishes harshly for breaking military law.   What Joe next goes into, and where we disagree, is that the resignation of Donald Rumsfeld is warranted right now. Yes, Joe, the buck does stop at Rumsfeld's desk. Yes, he should have been aware and probably was aware, of the fact that certain interrogation methods were being used. Last fall the Red Cross brought the fact that there might be abuse at Abu Ghraib prison to the attention of the administration. There were, according to Secretary of State Colin Powell "High level talks" about the possibility of abuse. However, nothing was done. Why is this?  Interrogation is not a pretty thing. Anybody who's seen an episode of Law and Order knows what I'm talking about. Interrogation (and completely legal interrogation) in a war zone is even worse. Before a couple weeks ago no one would have even considered abuse as damming as the red cross said was occurring in it's report, which (excerpted from the executive summary) ranged from  * Brutality against protected persons upon capture and initial custody, sometimes causing death or serious injury;  * Absence of notification of arrest of persons deprived of their liberty to their families causing distress among persons deprived of their liberty and their families;  * Physical or psychological coercion during interrogation to secure information;  * Prolonged solitary confinement in cells devoid of daylight;  * Excessive and disproportionate use of force against persons deprived of their liberty resulting in death or injury during their period of internment....  Most of these methods are perfectly legal and within the bounds of the Geneva Convention and are used by militaries worldwide. The rest could easily be seen by the administration as the exaggerations of an organization which has been against the occupation from day one.  Also, any use of interrogation methods that might be construed as violating the Geneva convention have since been banned although they were never legally used in Iraq, as none of these methods were ever requested for (in order to use them a prison had to get the ok of the commanding general) meaning that any use of them was completely illegal.   With all these facts weighing in plus the overriding need to keep constant leadership in a time when the balance is so fickle (official turnover to the Iraqis will occur in a bit more than a month) Rumsfeld mustn’t get out of office. His sheer workload, drive, and sense of public duty make him right now the best man for the job. Now is not the time to have someone getting used to a job at a time when necessity demands a 12 hour workday 7 days a week. Also, Joe, Rumsfeld ain't exactly Richard Nixon, now is he? I don't see him blatantly doing any criminal acts, like, say lying to a grand jury. In fact, he's done quite the opposite. He's owned up to his failures and he knows that he has to be even more aware and even more vigilant of exactly what the military is doing.  I also, sadly, have to agree with Joe's conclusions about America's image. I was just watching the daily show tonight (Gasp! A conservative who can laugh!) and he had an Arab mention something about how he'd feel, that in order to make a comparison, we should picture "what it would be like if Iraqis were doing it to Americans on American soil." I only hope that the turnover to Iraqi control will go well and the whole situation in the middle-east won't spiral out of control, no one wants the plot of a bad Tom Clancy book happening in real life...

						   The atrocities that have permeated the media the past few weeks have many aspects to them that explain a great deal about conservative mentality and the ever-growing need to get Bush out of office. I feel justice should be served to those who carried out the inhumane acts against Abu Ghraib prisoners. Whether they knew what they were doing or they were manipulated or ill-informed, justice should be served. Appropriate punishment should be administered and justice should be served. I understand this is only a few select soldiers and does not bear relevance to the rest of the Armed Services. I still support our troops and am in a debt of gratitude for their service. I also understand other countries and frustrated citizens within these foreign countries do not necessarily understand or support these sentiments. I just ask those thinking about this issue to think about how this looks to the rest of the world. God bless the Great American Liberators, right?   Although great fault rests on the shoulders of those who carried out these acts, even a greater amount of fault rests on the shoulders of those who presided over these tragic trespasses against humanity. As Nathan pointed out, some have called for Rumsfailed's resignation. I have to say I would not cry a single tear nor protest one bit if Rummy stepped down. Yes, Nathan, Don has experience. However, that does not justify his various failures and mishandling of the prison abuse and torture. I can think of an abundance of figureheads who had a great amount of experience yet were forced to resign due to various shady activities. Remember Nixon? I don't recall hearing about anyone protesting the resignation of Nixon due to his political experience. I also don't recall anyone protesting Clinton's impeachment due to his many years of experience as President- not even from liberals or Democrats. (They rightfully protested the impeachment due to a lack of strong justification. Censuring the President for putting his dick in the wrong place and trying to get away with it, sure. Impeachment? I don't think so.) Yes, the Commander-in-Thief, Rumsfailed, and the other cabinet members did not physically carry out these acts. They did, however, as Nathan said himself: "...[carry] out the policies set forth by President Bush excellently." Excellently is debatable. Well, now that I think of it, carrying out the policies set forth by the President is debatable as well. I don't think the New Yorker reported that Bush approved a decision last year which "[expanded] a classified operation for the aggressive interrogations to Iraqi prisoners..." (See Comcast Article Below) They reported the man responsible for that action was indeed Rumsfeld. Granted, the Pentagon denied the allegations within the New Yorker article, yet when haven't they denied true and false allegations? We all know how credible the administration's word is; honest as honest can be. I wouldn't say as credible as Hersh, the reporter who broke the story, however. The reporter has a lot of experience ;). (In a break from the sarcasm, Hersh truly does have established credibility.)  If you read the AP article accessible at: http://www.comcast.net/News/DOMESTIC/XML/1151_President__White_House__Advisers/7dc7fb7f-ca89-44d5-a85e-b951655e7851.html, you will see that "there were high-level discussions within the Bush administration last fall about information from the International Committee of the Red Cross alleging inmate abuse at the U.S.-run Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq." Nathan, I thought you said Bush wasn't informed of the abuse. Granted, as shown in the past, Bush isn't quite qualified to fully understand briefings. Can you at least agree that Rummy knew the full extent of the abuse as soon as last January? (http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/opinion/172703_thomas11.html) It's sickening to think that the administration in part or full knew about the abuse, tried to keep it a secret from the public, and once the public was informed about the abuse, claim to not have to apologize for the atrocities. Do you realize they didn't apologize until public opinion toward a lack of apology turned sour? Do you realize they base their policies on that mentality- don't apologize or concede until public opinion requires it. Do you realize Rummy didn't even talk to a single prisoner at Abu Ghraib when he visited it recently? Do you realize that this incident stems more from aggressive rhetoric and corrupt leadership than "apathy on our part"? That is why Rummy must resign and send the right message to the rest of the world: our country doesn't tolerate this kind of (mis)leadership. If you consider these things as fulfilling "his duties as the civilian leader of one of the world’s largest military" (sic) then so be it. Yet, as the civilian leader of the military, Rumsfailed bears some responsibility for these kinds of scandals. He certainly does not deserve a flattering label given to him by Cheney who proclaimed: "Don Rumsfeld is the best secretary of defense the United States has ever had." Even better than Cheney, who served under Daddy Bush as Secretary of Defense? (http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=topNews&storyID=5081294)  I would continue with my dissatisfaction with Inhofe and the radical right-wing reaction, the lack of adherence to the Geneva Conventions, the interesting Red Cross statistic which states that up to 90 percent of those arrested and detained at Abu Ghraib were arrested by mistake, and more, but I don't want to write a novel. I will close by answering the fundamental question posed: What does this abuse mean? It means that our credibility has been tainted further and future relations with countries will take a long time to heal. We can all thank the Bush administration for that by sending them back home in November. Perhaps the village in Texas will even regain its idiot. This truly is Bush's Vietnam. If this abuse scandal hasn't proven that to you yet, then I direct you to any resource which discusses Vietnam's My Lai Massacre. If I didn't assure you before, I do still support our troops. I agree with Nathan that we need to thank them for their service. We need to thank them, support them, and bring them home.

						   Stories (and pictures) of what can only be characterized as torture by American soldiers on Iraqi prisoners have flooded the news recently.  Domestically, the story has met with widespread disgust.  Politically it has met with calls for Rumsfeld’s resignation on the left and been passed off as not that big of a deal by the right.  Neither of these positions is correct.  The Iraq prison abuse is, of course, a very terrible thing.  However, it shouldn’t reflect badly on the Bush administration. At the highest levels, on the shoulders of the President, the responsibility for the scandal cannot be laid.  The president was simply never informed of the abuse.  He has publicly said that he was shocked and appalled at the images.  And, in good conscience, no man in his right mind could condone actions like this. Below the president, secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld cannot and should not hold blame for the scandal.  A shakeup at the military’s highest level, Rumsfeld’s desk, would only exacerbate the underlying problem causing the abuse in the Iraqi prison system.  Rumsfeld, whether you like him or not, has experience.  He’s been secretary of defense through a major terrorist attack, two wars, and countless minor crises.  Rumsfeld knows his job and, despite this failure, has carried out the policies set forth by President Bush excellently.  You can disagree with the policies, but you can’t argue that Rumsfeld hasn’t fulfilled his duties as the civilian leader of one of the world’s largest military. The real problem and what the media seems to be missing is the obvious systematic malfunction in the American military.  This disgusting, sadistic behavior has to be a symptom of larger problems.  No organized, high morale, disciplined military would ever allow anything like this to happen.  Only ridiculously low morale could possibly cause the blatant disregard for military procedure or even basic human decency.  Only at one time in American history has the US military gone through a similar scandal.  In the 70’s, following Vietnam, the entire American military practically cracked under social pressures.  A soldier was seen by the public as some kind of moron who couldn’t get around military service.  Who would want to be part of an organization that killed babies and burned villages, the thinking went.  Drug use was rampant, discipline lax, American military bases were trash-filled dumps, allegations of rape spread like wildfire, and the entire command structure was for all intents and purposes, ignored.  If not for radical military reorganization in the 80’s the American military wouldn’t have been prepared for even its most basic duties.  America would have been left defenseless.  The same problem is affecting the military today.  Soldiers overseas see a brutal, seemingly endless war, an American populace once again hostile to the military and the cause for which they are fighting, and no reason to continue to struggle.  Soldiers are obviously ignoring the commands of their superior officers and taking out their frustration on the Iraqis.  Something needs to budge.  We, right here at home, have the ability to change things. We all need to support the military.  Write a letter to your congressman asking him to get the government moving on finding the real, basic reasons for the lax discipline exemplified by the Iraq prison abuse.  When you see a soldier returning home from Iraq, give him your thanks.  Don’t allow people to trivialize the military for their service to you.  And think that service to this country immoral or useless.  This scandal was caused by apathy on our part.  All we need to do is show the soldiers in Iraq that we care for their hard work and sacrifice.  If that happens, nothing as horrible as what we’ve seen the past week will ever happen again.

						   ...it will be in blog form!  Nathan and I have always enjoyed discussing politics and have decided to channel that enjoyment and spread it to you all. I am excited something like this is finally underway. I hope to have periodic "columns" and point-counterpoint debates on various issues. I also hope comments from the blog's audience will not be scarce. Like Nathan said, all comments and opinions are welcome and will be respected. The first topic, the Iraq prison abuse, will be an interesting one. Stay tuned, check back tomorrow, and tell all your friends! ( Yes, both of them. ;) )  P.S. As always, fight the power!

						   Welcome to my and Joe's little experiment in high school political commentary.  On this blog we hope to offer some incisive, cutting, and always entertaining political point-counterpoint on all the relevant issues of the day.  Everything from policy in Iraq to Whether Bush looks like a monkey will be covered and then, if you feel like it, discussed ad nauseum by you.  All comments are welcome by everyone (even if you're an anonymous coward) and all opinions will be respected.  Hopefully this'll turn out great and we'll be able to work this summer and next school year.  Viva la Revolucion!  Tomorrow, the Iraqi prison torture, what does it mean?

						   As you can see, this blog is dead. What was once an exciting venture is now a mere memory in cyberspace. Who knows what will happen to this blog, for few things are certain.  What is certain is that both Nathan and I will continue to dedicate ourselves to politics, discourse, and democracy. (Pardon me for the corny speech, it's late at night.)  I have decided to start a new blog. It is called:  urlLink Invade This!  and will contain personal essays, analysis, articles, and general talking points. (Comments from potential sympathizers and critics as well!) It will of course pertain to politics and current events, but as I said before, few things are certain. Will it stay in the realm of politics and current events? Most likely. Will it remain active for a substantial period of time? Doubtful. Is it even worth perusing? As long as there is a thing called boredom, the answer is absolutely.

      We need a Head of State who differentiates between wisdom and ignorance. We need a Commander-in-Chief who recognizes the difference between strength and arrogance. We need a President who, in his own mind and in the minds of those under his care, will separate the truth from the lies. We need John Kerry.  With such grave danger in the world, does it really make sense to burn America’s vital bridges to her closest allies and alienate the global community- tarnishing America’s image for years to come? I don’t think so. Kerry doesn't either.  John Kerry has always been a strong leader. Whether it be bravely commanding a Swift Boat in Vietnam, putting some of the most dangerous criminals behind bars as a prosecutor, or fighting to protect the values his constituents and millions of Americans hold dear as a four-term Senator, Kerry has always been strong, brave, and wise.  John Kerry has and always will protect sacred civil rights and liberties. He has and always will bring both logic and justice to crime. Kerry has and always will fight for a healthy economy- one full of equal opportunity and abundant jobs. He believes in strengthening the family through looking at health care as a right rather than a privilege, as well as focusing on after-school programs and affordable higher learning.  Kerry will ensure that an illegitimate war will not be fought in America’s name. John Kerry will ensure that America’s image does not suffer at the hands of an arrogant bully. He recognizes the importance of shared responsibility and shared benefits. Kerry’s foreign policy and national security plans are right for America. As President, John Kerry will go beyond fighting for these things. He will provide them with flying colors.  I realize it may be discouraging to a teenager, especially one who can’t even vote yet, to jump into the realm of politics. Don’t be discouraged, be energized. Your country has no age restrictions on who can and can’t help her in a time of need. What is happening now matters. Our parents see the cause of the decisions made today, we see the effects tomorrow. If you are able to vote, don’t take it for granted. Exercise your right as an American citizen to voice your opinion. Even if you are not able to vote, you can still get involved and make a difference. Financially contribute to the individuals who best address your concerns. Volunteer for political organizations and campaigns. Engage in political discussions, letting others know how you stand and why you feel it is the right way to stand. Finally, if you haven’t gotten the message already, you should know that our country doesn’t need a misleader- it needs a leader. America needs to be strong at home and more respected in the world. America needs John Kerry in the White House.

      "The arrogance, inconsistency, and unreliability of the [Clinton] administration's diplomacy have undermined American alliances, alienated friends, and emboldened our adversaries...Gerrymandered congressional districts are an affront to democracy and an insult to the voters. We oppose that and any other attempt to rig the electoral process...Nor should the intelligence community be made the scapegoat for political misjudgments. A Republican administration working with the Congress will respect the needs and quiet sacrifices of these public servants as it strengthens America's intelligence and counter-intelligence capabilities and reorients them toward the dangers of the future."-  urlLink The Republican Platform during the 2000 election

      Please Note: I supported the war in Afghanistan on the basis it was justified and it had to do with the War on Terrorism.  There are so many things wrong with going to war with Iraq, a simple blog entry cannot sum up every single one.  I am glad Saddam is out of power. He was an evil dictator. I am not glad, though, that he was thrown from power through means of invading the country he once ruled. It wasn't smart.  Why? Well...  A.) It creates an unstable country, a quagmire if you will. B.) The citizens of Iraq are sick and tired of getting screwed over. Whether it's living under an oppressive regime or living in an unstable country that lacks basic necessities and order but overcompensates for American occupation, the Iraqi people don't want it. I recently saw an interview with an Iraqi citizen in which he said something to the effect of: "I would shake my hand with the Devil to end the suffering of the Iraqi people, to put stability back into Iraq." They don't care who fixes things, just as long as they are fixed. If America is incapable of stabilizing Iraq (and understandably so, it's an impossible mission), then America certainly doesn't need to invade Iraq and make things worse. However, once you break it, you own it. George W. Bush bought Iraq for America and has consequently put America into one of the worst positions it has been in for decades. C.) The invasion proved to Muslims worldwide that the War on Terrorism is a war on Islam. I know the War on Terrorism is not a war on Islam, but that is what millions of Muslims now think. How is this supposed to make America and the world safer? The invasion of Iraq created a haven for international terrorists, energized al-Qaida's cause, and tarnished America's image- spreading anti-American sentiment like wildfire across the globe.  I am not glad that there are countless other evil dictators around the world. Should we go to war to remove every single one of them? Are we the global police? Bush thinks so. By acting as the global police, you provide yourself with everlasting war, which for Bush, is providing yourself with everlasting job security. This will work until something is done to stop the madness.  Let me show you an analogy I came up with for the tenth anniversary of Nicole Simpson and Ron Goldman's murders. It goes like this...  I do not approve of O.J. Simpson. I believe he escaped the justice owed to him from his dual homicides. Should I, against the will of other Americans, against the tenets of common sense, and against the restrictions set up by law, take justice into my own hands and capture him? What would happen if, in the process of my mission, I accidentally injure or kill his innocent children? Oh well, I still think I should go for it. I need to liberate the Simpson kids. Does anyone want to join my Coalition of the Willing? The white Bronco may be slow, but it holds plenty of oil!  I understand that war is never not going to be an option. Sometimes, you have to go to war. The key phrase is HAVE TO. With the horrors of war running far and deep, war should be an absolute last resort, falling leaps of steps behind diplomacy. I mourn the killed and wounded in war. I believe every limb and life surrendered in the name of one's country is tragic yet noble and admirable. Injury and death in unjustified wars are almost even more tragic, as unjustified wars produce unjustified and unnecessary results. The decision to go to war should never be made lightly, should never be decided upon before entering office, and should never involve lies, deceit, the destruction of America's vital bridges to her closest allies, and the tarnishing of America's image.

       Q: George, what are your feelings about Iraq?  A: "Trying to eliminate Saddam...would have incurred incalculable human and political costs. Apprehending him was probably impossible...We would have been forced to occupy Baghdad and, in effect, rule Iraq...There was no viable "exit strategy" we could see, violating another of our principles. Furthermore, we had been consciously trying to set a pattern for handling aggression in the post-Cold War world. Going in and occupying Iraq, thus unilaterally exceeding the United Nations' mandate, would have destroyed the precedent of international response to aggression that we hoped to establish. Had we gone the invasion route, the United States could conceivably still be an occupying power in a bitterly hostile land."-  A World Transformed  by George H.W. Bush  Q: How about you, Dick?  A: "If you're going to go in and try to topple Saddam Hussein, you have to go to Baghdad. Once you've got Baghdad, it's not clear what you do with it. It's not clear what kind of government you would put in place of the one that's currently there now. Is it going to be a Shia regime, a Sunni regime or a Kurdish regime? Or one that tilts toward the Baathists, or one that tilts toward the Islamic fundamentalists? How much credibility is that government going to have if it's set up by the United States military when it's there? How long does the United States military have to stay to protect the people that sign on for that government, and what happens to it once we leave?...I think to have American military forces engaged in a civil war inside Iraq would fit the definition of quagmire, and we have absolutely no desire to get bogged down in that fashion."- Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense, April 1991   Anyone remember the Powell Doctrine? As chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Powell proposed six questions to be answered before committing American troops to combat. The doctrine was used quite frequently against Bill Clinton in the '90s and is in existence to prevent another Vietnam. It goes like this...  1.) Is a vital US interest at stake? 2.) Will we commit sufficient resources to win? 3.) Are our objectives clearly defined? 4.) Will we sustain the commitment? 5.) Is there a reasonable expectation that the public and Congress will support the operation? 6.) Have we exhausted our other options?  Q: Hey, Colin, you seem like an intelligent leader. What are your thoughts?  A: My doctrine was created to avoid "halfhearted warfare for half-baked reasons that the American people could not understand or support." "We must not...send military forces into a crisis with an unclear mission they cannot accomplish- such as we did when we sent the U.S. Marines into Lebanon in 1983. We inserted those proud warriors into the middle of a five-faction civil war complete with terrorists, hostage-takers, and a dozen spies in every camp, and said, 'Gentlemen, be a buffer.' The results were 241 Marines and Navy personnel killed and a U.S. withdrawal."- Colin Powell, in his speech entitled: "US Forces: The Challenges Ahead," given in 1991.   "The impending war in Iraq, however, arguably meets only one criterion of the Powell Doctrine. Weapons inspectors have just begun their work, which is why France, Russia, and China argue that war is not yet a last resort. Public support for a war in Iraq is hardly strong. In the most recent New York Times/CBS News poll, while a majority of Americans support the use of force as an option, 59 percent want to give the United Nations and weapons inspectors more time. The divided opinion reflects the lack of a well-defined national interest in going to war now. The Bush administration has tried to portray a pre-emptive war as essential to the war on terrorism, but the evidence of the 'links' between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda is highly questionable."- Ruth Rosen, San Francisco Chronicle columnist. Written before the invasion.   Don't take hindsight for granted!

      How sad it is that many Republicans forget...  ...Wars don't start when America gets involved. Many of the wars mentioned in the e-mail were started long before America sent troops into battle. Many of them involved many other nations in the world before America joined the effort.  ...Germany, in fact, did attack us. Anyone remember the Lusitania from history class?  ...Germany, Italy, and Japan were allies. Going to war with one was going to war with the others. There wasn't a choice in the matter. No matter what the Bush Administration or Faux News tells you, it’s a proven fact: al-Qaida and Iraq never had a link, much less an alliance. (See the  urlLink 9/11 Commission Report .)  ...Germany was an imminent threat. Iraq was not. Iraq's real-life threat-level was nowhere near the level the Bush Administration projected. If we are to take any hint to former US chief weapons inspector David Kay's remarks at his retirement, or former UN chief weapons inspector Hans Blix's assessment in his latest book, or even listen to Bill Clinton, we can see how both Bush and Blair misled their respective publics into war and why we will NEVER find any WMDs in Iraq.  …When we look at past speeches from our President, most notably the 2003 State of the Union Address, we see that Bush not only used faulty evidence to justify the war, but he knowingly cited unfounded claims to the American public. Why is George Tenet, the former CIA Director- a man who told the Bush Administration days before the 2003 State of the Union Address to take out specific unfounded claims in the speech- not in power? Why is George W. Bush- the man who left the faulty evidence in the speech and knowingly gave an address of deceit to the American public- in power?  ...Vietnam is looked upon today as a grave mistake.  ..."Once upon a time, Europe looked to the United States for stability. Remember how Clinton helped stabilize the situations in places like Bosnia, Kosovo, and Northern Ireland? Europeans expected strong, intelligent and sane leadership from the United States, and they got it. With Bush in office, Europeans miss the good old days when the U.S. had an educated, clear-headed president. Bush is confused. You never know what's next. The terrorists came from Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan and Pakistan, so Bush bombs Iraq and sends most of his troops there. North Korea not only has weapons of mass destruction, but brags about them, yet Bush simply shrugs his shoulders because his troops are too busy in a wild goose chase in the Middle East to do anything about it. Meanwhile, al-Qaida terrorists kill innocent civilians in Spain. What's the Bush logic? As long as he's fighting somebody somewhere, he must be doing the right thing."- Chapter 126 from  urlLink the Boo, Boo Bush Book .  ...Clinton was impeached for putting his dick in the wrong place and, God forbid, trying to get away with it. What do you think would have happened if Clinton went to war to capture a man the American public barely knew? I'm sure there wouldn’t be a complaint, much less a crusade, from a single Republican, right? (At least he tried to focus on the al-Qaida and Bin Laden threat, and compared to other leaders, sufficiently did something about it. He warned the next President of the United States of the threat, but if Bush wasn't going to listen to his own Counterterrorism czar, what chance did Clinton have?)  ...Democrats own up to their mistakes.  ...The liberation that Bush speaks of is not the same liberation that injured, deceased, and tortured Iraqi civilians know.  ...Bush is seemingly able to “crush” the Taliban and “cripple” al-Qaida, but the mastermind behind the worst incident of mass murder America has ever known is still at large. Of course, diverting essential equipment and troops from Afghanistan to Iraq didn’t help. (This all rings true, of course, if Bush doesn’t further play politics with national security and pull Bin Laden out of his hat in the nick of time. High-level al-Qaida officials are already starting to “show up” at  urlLink convenient times .)  ...stating Bush put weapons inspectors in Libya, Iran, and North Korea without firing a shot doesn't make it so. Did I miss something or is this just a flat out lie?  ...Taking cheap shots at Democrats in the context of the e-mail is not relevant in the slightest, but why should I be surprised? This kind of low behavior is right on par with the Grand Old Party. (Anyone remember the Max Cleland fiasco in 2002? Anyone remember how the Republicans exploited terrorism and Iraq to defeat the disabled veteran?)  Our Commander-in-Chief is doing a great job? The military moral (sic) is high? George W. Christ...

      I recieved this e-mail from a good conservative friend of mine. It should amuse both sides...   To: Republicans -- enjoy To: Democrats -- see what the competition is circulating!  Learn these facts to properly debate our poor misguided friends &amp; family before election time !!!  There were 39 combat related killings in Iraq during the month of January... In the fair city of Detroit there were 35 murders in the month of January. That's just one American city, about as deadly as the entire war torn country of Iraq.  When some claim President Bush shouldn't have started this war, state the following...  FDR led us into World War II. Germany never attacked us. Japan did. From 1941-1945, 450,000 lives were lost, an average of 112,500 per year.  Truman finished that war and started one in Korea. North Korea never attacked us. From 1950-1953, 55,000 lives were lost, an average of 18,334 per year.  John F. Kennedy started the Vietnam conflict in 1962. Vietnam never attacked us.  Johnson turned Vietnam into a quagmire. From 1965-1975, 58,000 lives were lost, an average of 5,800 per year.  Clinton went to war in Bosnia without UN or French consent. Bosnia never attacked us.  He was offered Osama bin Laden's head on a platter three times by Sudan and did nothing. Osama has attacked us on multiple occasions.  In the two years since terrorists attacked us, President Bush has liberated two countries, crushed the Taliban, crippled al-Qaida, put nuclear inspectors in Libya, Iran, and North Korea without firing a shot, and captured a terrorist who slaughtered 300,000 of his own people.  The Democrats are complaining about how long the war is taking, but it took less time to take Iraq than it took Janet Reno to take the Branch Davidian compound. That was a 51 day operation.  We've been looking for evidence of chemical weapons in Iraq for less time than it took Hillary Clinton to find the Rose Law Firm billing records.  It took less time for the 3rd Infantry Division and the Marines to destroy the Medina Republican Guard than it took Ted Kennedy to call the police after his Oldsmobile sank at Chappaquiddick.  It took less time to take Iraq than it took to count the votes in Florida!!!!  Our Commander-In-Chief is doing a GREAT JOB! The Military moral is high! The biased media hopes we are too ignorant to realize the facts. PASS IT ON.
