      I am in Cali visiting my dad, sisters and friends.  I never realize how much I miss it here until I am out here.  The weather is perfect and its just nice to get away to a place that you like to be...especially after leaving Dallas.    Yesterday I spent the day with my best friend, Jameela, and it was like a breath of fresh air.  We've been friends since high school even though I have been in Texas the last six years.  We didn't do anything in particular just went to the mall, hung out and talked.  I love friends who no matter how much time has passed, you just seem to pick up where you left off (we had not kicked it in a year).  Jameela always has funny stories and stays positive no matter what's going on in her life  (and she deals with some really bad stuff sometimes).  She's always been one of the only people I felt I could really open up to without judging me or talking bad behind my back to our other friends.  I don't have to "screen" what I tell her and she has never thrown anything in my face later.  She's just one of those people that you feel lucky to have as a friend because she is so much fun and is just a genuine person.  It doesn't hurt that she has a fine brother either...lol.  Yeah, I know, that was really gay...in the hetro-normative sense of the word as Dustin would say...but I had to get it off my chest.    Well I will be here another three days then its back to school...last year TG!  I am actually excited which probably officially makes me a nerd but its my last year to be a student.  After this, no more long summer or winter vacations and its a regular 9-5 (or 8-8 as most first year lawyers).  Peace out...  Dee

      I have this rule about not drinking until after six...unfortunately working at a law frim is not always conducive to this rule.  Yesterday my firm decides to throw a going away happy hour for the summer clerks.  I have avoided drinking excessively the entire summer at such events but since I have decided that I do not want to work in Dallas or at this firm permanently...what the hell?    The event was catered "Brazilian Style" which was nice...but they should warn someone that Brazilians are natural alcoholics.  I had a drink which was explained to me to be the Brazilian equivalent of a Mojito (it started with a 'C') and it contained what I believe to be about three shots of rum with limes crushed at the bottom.  I am not a heavy drinker so this was quite a bit of alcohol for me (don't ask about my New Year's in New Orleans--see pic below).    So I managed to not make an ass of myself at the firm event but I attempted to workout after the happy hour--I figured it was only one drink so I could do it!  Isn't that dedication?  I was quite proud of myself until a fellow jogger stopped me and told me he could smell alcohol coming from my pores.  I did not want to be known as "that alcoholic chick at the gym" so I stopped my workout promptly and left.    No, this story really had nothing to do with my after 6 rule but I thought it would be a good way to start it anyway...

      Okay, I have pretty much gotten use to Dallas I think but have officially decided at this point that it is not for me.  At first I absolutely hated it here but then I thought, aside from the apparent caste system, my credit card being stolen and almost being robbed at a gas station a couple weeks ago, it's really not that bad of a place.  Then today I once again lost all confidence in this city...  I went to Albertson's in Uptown to buy Dole fruit bars (which I have recently developed a strange addiction to) and of course, every line was long.  SO I proceed to the seemingly shortest line (since ALL FOUR of the self checkout stations were closed, broken or whatever and there were only three regular lanes open on a Sunday afternoon the busiest time of the week in a grocery store) without paying attention to the socioethnic demographics of the customers and checker in line before me.    The checker, whose name was "Yorkisha," was obviously black and had the notorious "checker nails" with airbrushing and burgundy weave throughout her corn-rows.  The first customers were an old pregnant lady and what seemed to be her adult son, both Mexican, and neither English-speaking.  The woman had a sale paper, was pointing to the price of milk in the paper and attempting to ask why the price of the milk that she had (that was not the same brand as the one in the sale paper) was not the same price as the one in the sale paper.  I really am not sure who to blame for the events that followed.  Of course, the cashier could not understand what the customer was saying but she had an unnecessarily nasty attitude and was a bit too confident to be a thirty-something year old checker.  On the other hand, it seems that the pregnant lady should have been able to figure out the milk brands were different...but this probably had to do with her not being able to speak...and apparently read...English.  By the time the son finally figured out what the problem was, thanks to my broken and limited Spanish after three years of it in college, and decided to get the other brand of milk, I had already stood in line for about 15 minutes and was not about to loose my place in line to get in one of the other lines that had grown considerably during this incident.  I was determined to win the grocery store line game.  So the son gets back with the milk...now we have right milk, right price--okay I'm out of here soon right?  Of course not, this is Dallas.  The pregnant lady pulls out her Lonestar card, swipes wrong five times so apparently this is something the son has to do as well.  He swipes incorrectly three times.  The checker finally intervenes and swipes the card properly and the woman smiles.  She has no teeth but a beautiful smile just the same.  Though I can't think of a good reason at the time, I have to assume that not having teeth can't be good for a pregnancy.  Anyway, there is not enough on the card to cover all the items so they put the milk back and buy the rest of their stuff.    The next person in front of me wants to write a check over the amount of their purchase to get cash back, which apparently is not allowed.  Again, this checker has an unnecessarily nasty attitude calling the customer names like "ignorant" and "inconsiderate [to the rest of the customers in line]."  The customer then argues with the cashier that she has written such checks at this particular Albertson's in the past, to which the checker replies "well I don't know how to do that so you won't be writing one at THIS Albertson's in THIS line today."  I would have said something to her but (1) she wasn't being rude to me and (2) I can't fight and (3) she look like she could.  Total wait time: 25 minutes; my popsicles were half melted by the time I got to my room.  But then again, I guess this scenario could happen in any city.  But it had to happend to me here, in Dallas.  Only one more week...

      I have been a fan of the HBO original series for quite some time now.  First they brought us "Sex in the City"  which will always be a fav and a classic, then they gave us "The Sopranos" and "Curb Your Enthusiasm."  But HBO has stepped it up a notch and has finally committed themselves to telling the true American story with "Family Bonds" a 10 episode series about a family of bails bondsmen and bounty hunters that live in Medford, Long Island.  I just want to give HBO a whole-hearted thank you for expanding its horizons and telling the white trash story.  It is about time the other side of the masses is exploited.  It is getting a little old seeing poor black people being arrested, playing Sambos and making asses of themselves.  The closest Americans have ever come to seeing this epic tale is through Eminem's 8-mile and the reliable mullet guild on Cops.  I can't wait until the premier on September 19th!
