      Well, I have made it to the second book of Echo Heron's!&nbsp; The first book made me so excited about nursing and this one makes me realize I must be nuts to want to enter this field!&nbsp; They should require these books as pre-admission for nursing school!&nbsp;   Yet I still want to be a nurse.&nbsp; I hope to obtain my LPN and after a few years of working, start on my BSN.&nbsp; Who knows though?&nbsp; There are plenty of LPN's who have done amazing things with their careers and have not hit that "ceiling" yet.&nbsp;   If there is one thing I have learned from these books it is this: all people start off as innocent, good people.&nbsp; It is this crazy world that brings them to the point where they are angry or bitter or depressed or anything else that happens to people.&nbsp; Echo treats some people in these stories that make you wonder how in the world she can do it.&nbsp; Some of them are so mean or sad...what have you...but she looks to the person and the soul.&nbsp; When she reaches it and you finally see the "real" person stripped of all the walls life has built around them-you just want to cry.&nbsp; Everybody has been guilty of judgement, we can't help it.&nbsp; Society sets such high standards and stigmitisms.&nbsp; But when you shove all those out of your mind and look at the person as a human, with a heart and soul...someone who has probably laughed, loved, loss, feared, cried...it is amazing the insight you suddenly find within youself.  My father is the perfect example.&nbsp; Sometimes I could pull my hair out when he has one of those, "pity me" days.&nbsp; Yes, he had a rough childhood and has skeletons in his closet that I hope I never have to know about, but when he puts that all aside, I realize that he is human. He is the way he is because he has faced great fear, loss and disrespect throughout his whole life and his mentality and attitude are ways of just dealing with everything that runs through his head.&nbsp; We all know what that is like.&nbsp; Those darn little demons we call memories.&nbsp; They have a way of popping into our heads at the most incovienient times and keeping us up at night.  Well it is 1:00 in the morning and I am now getting tired after my "epiphany." I pray that my letter is there tomorrow...I really look forward to taking the plunge into the nursing world.

      &nbsp; urlLink   &nbsp;Well, I still not heard anything yet!&nbsp; I am still going crazy over it!&nbsp;&nbsp;   In the meantime,&nbsp;I have purchased books written by Echo Heron.&nbsp; Heard of her?&nbsp; People have told me that if you can read her books and still want to go into nursing then you've got it made.&nbsp; I admit they are right.&nbsp; The first one  Intensive Care-The Story of&nbsp;a Nurse&nbsp;  is amazing!&nbsp; It starts with her in nursing school and it goes through her first jobs...etc.&nbsp; You cannot help but get right into them!&nbsp; You find yourself getting nervous when she does (like with the clinical instructor from hell) and frustrated, and excited (like when she gets into nursing school-I swear you pace with her while she is waiting for the mailman!), angry, sad...everything!&nbsp; These books have not deterred me at all!&nbsp; They have only made me more excited about jumping in to this heart-wrenching, overworked, stressfull and rewarding field of nursing!&nbsp; I cannot wait to start the nexy one  Condition Critical: The Story of a Nurse Continues !&nbsp; I heard though that she eventually leaves nursing...   urlLink   Well, hopefull tomorrow I will hear something...&nbsp; urlLink   &nbsp;       urlLink

       So maybe I am jumping the gun on starting this considering I am still waiting to hear if I am even in to the school that I applied to.&nbsp; But I really believe I have an okay chance of getting in.&nbsp; I guess if you are reading this-then I probably did because obviously if I don't then I would not continue on.     &nbsp;   I am one of those people who&nbsp;could never figure out what I wanted to do for a career.&nbsp; I tried business, criminal justice, accounting, biology, paralgeal...if it is out there then I have researched it to death and for one reason or another it just didn't fit me.&nbsp; As a Christian, I finally prayed and asked the Lord to help guide me and He brought me here-to nursing.&nbsp; Now I cannot imagine going into anything else.     &nbsp;   The school I applied to is a vocational school about half an hour away from me.&nbsp; They decided to upgrade their admissions in order to have a better graduation precentage and I guess it has worked for them.&nbsp; They have increased their retention rate from about 80% to around 97%.&nbsp; They also have a tremendously better reputaion then the other school that is closer to me.&nbsp; I had to take the TABE exam and was shocked to have passed, go through an extremely tough interview which ended up with the admissions counselor saying she would highly reccommend me, an application, essay, physical, shot records and financial aid workshop.&nbsp; Now it is just waiting...     &nbsp;   In the meantime I am visiting my other fave site, allnurses.com & reading Echo Heron books because I just cannot get enough about nursing.&nbsp; I hope to go from LPN to BSN through one of the many online programs, get my RN and end up in Nephrology-possibly case management.&nbsp; Of course I have not had any experience yet with clinicals and what not-so who knows where I may end up.&nbsp; I guess we'll see....   all that matters in the end is my daughter.&nbsp; She is my world.

      Call me a nerd, but I bought my school supplies yesterday and my bag is packed and ready to go.  I am about a month ahead of myself, but I am so excited that I wanted to feel like I was doing "something!"  I didn't buy too much though because I am not sure what exactly I will need and my orientation is not until the very first day of school.  So I stocked up on pens, pencils, post-its, notecards, staples for my staplers, notebook paper, notebooks, dividers for my binder and clear sheets to hold important reference stuff, such as course outlines and some folders.  I feel like September is never going to get here, yet I know I should just relax for August and enjoy the time with my daughter.  So that is what I am going to do.  I will be back after my first day (09/08) and from then on, this bolg will live up to its name!  I hope that people will find it helpful being able to see from the ''front lines". If not, it will still help me to write.  Wish me luck!
