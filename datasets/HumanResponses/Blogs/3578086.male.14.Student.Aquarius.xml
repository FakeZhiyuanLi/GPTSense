      Ok it seems that everyone at the prep hates me thanks to new sources. YAY go me yeah......why do i even bother anymore i mean i am so stupid and selfish i hate my self so much and i know Alice that you love me and i love you so much but this is killing me. I cant be happy for other people. I just cant i havent got the will anymore. not for this. Everyone thinks i am selfish and i tottally agree with them but i have lost the will to care about these things anymore. Sam said "moods" i dont have moods i am depressed and sam everytime you tried to help me you take the piss of me and i know when you are doing it too. And yeah thanks everyone else you have been soooooooooooooooooooooooooo understanding (for those who dont know that was sarcsm). Thanks tim for letting Sam know, Thanks louis for letting most the school know, thanks ali for letting my brother know, thanks gibbson for the same reason as louis, Pete thanks for telling louis, Sam thanks for lying to me,thanks guys thank you soo much for your support. The only person who is not to blame is Will. Thank you Everyone else if i do commit suicude it is your falut I hope you know that! So thank you for killing me!

      Now everyone is off with their "Oh i fancy this girl what do i do help me Alim u r the gay one your good at that" But what if i have your own problems hey?? I mean there are people i fancy but i know i cant have now that is a feeling and a half.I mean with louis i loved him soo much and i knew i couldnt have him which hurt me so badly. And it is most likly to happen again. when he found out i just wanted to shout out "I CANT CONTROL WHO I FALL IN LOVE WITH!!!!". Also why is no one else gay in dulwich at my age i mean i cant be the only person who is!!! I hate being the only gay person (for now ((and for a while anyway))) cos u end up being alone all the time (with relasionships)  and also no straight person cna understand what you are talking about so they act the only way they know and laugh! I mean FUCK THEM i am going to become a Hetrophobe! I HATE STAIGHT PEOPLE!!!!

      Ok i may only be 13 but love has hit me twice before and i know that is young age but well... The first time (this is one secret which only one person knows until now) I fell in love with some one who did the choir i used to go to. I fell in love with her (because then i was not sure whether i was gay or not) and the second was with Louis. Now both of these people hurt me so badly because of this little feeling LOVE. Love it seems to eat at us. I think LOVE causes more problems that nearly any other feeling. Ok Kind of sidetracking from the subject here. I want to have a b/f i really want one or maybe just another gay person i can talk to. I hate having to talk to st8 people all the time( no offence but no one who is st8 knows what this is like at all! i still love u guys but....) I mean i will have to wait ages to get one. And i know i am not the world most attractive person and i am not fit at all but having someone would be nice. I mean i go to partys and everyone kisses but what can i do sit and watch GREAT! And even if i did get a boyfriend we would not be able to do anything in public like holdhands or kiss at partys cos of people. And people say that words can never hurt you but this is not true. Words hurt more than anything else. Words hurt more than kicking and hitting and things. Words can stay with you for your life time. Thing people say are like bullets they hit you and you cant get rid of them they stick with you forever. I mean sometimes people use them as throw down comments which they forget about and when you say something u can see the hurt on their face as u say it. I mean when people at school they say things about gay people and they know it hurts me so badly and they still carry on. These comment hurt me so much. There is this guy called Samir, He hates gay people and he goes on about how much he hates them and how mu ch they should all die and how he hates them and how it is disgusting. And then all these people like when i say i fancy that guy they laugh at me. This little things hurt me so badly  TODAY today I had a fall out with a friend who i have known for ages but who i cant trust (cos he goes to my school and i cant trust anyone who goes to my school!). I told louis this thing about me friend (which i dont belive is true) and he had a go at me and then he said that i did it cos i thought he told my brother which aparently he didnt (but i trust jess who tole me that he did soo...) and he said that jess was someone who didnt know him and how i couldnt trust him was bad. After this i couldnt take anymore and i ran off and cried in the loos (how strong am i) and since then i have cried all day! great day today then hey??

      Now explain this to me dear blogg. Why is it so hard for people to trust people? I mean everyone is like "..Oh tell me what is wrong.." But why if they are going to tell everyone else. I mean I thought I could trust my best friend who I have known for donkeys years. Well any way he told my brother my most biggest secret (that I was gay) and well I feel cheated. I didn't want my family to know and now thanks to my best friend I am dying inside. So Sam Hayward I would like tot thank you. You have ruined my life thank you so much I hope you are happy!

      Now I want to post randomly because I feel like filling up googles bandwidth so here goes.       When you are at school(now this is directed at anyone between the ages of 10-18) do you feel like there is the "cool" Group in your school? It has been this way at my school for ages there has always been one boy (who is usually good at sport) that has dominated my school. I wont post any names up here. Well this "cool" guy at our school it seems what he wants every one else in the his "cool group" do the same. Well I don't think he has anything against me but all these people just seem to avoid me like he does. And this hurts me a lot. And before this guy got really cocky i used to be quite good friends and then I found my self like falling in love with him which always happens to me. And now I feel they r avoiding me and because the are "cool" they have an effect on the whole school so everybody apart from my immediate friends avoid me and give me weird looks.  Well so is life Alim

      Seems this is what this blogging thing is it seems to me that i should do it as soon as i can. so.  10/06/2004           when i arrived ar school the class room goes silent. so i go and sit on my own at my desk. Everything goes back to normal and everyone starts talking. It seemed like that whole class was avoiding me. Not one person spoke to me this morining before registration. We had art 1st lesson. I was put on to tidy the draws while everyone else had fun so that was good. I was upset all day and then i spoke to my form tutor. She made me feel a bit better about my  self. We had our leavers foto as well which i couldnt smile for cos i have forgotten and then i had to sit for 2 hours in a hall listening to this partonising bitch talk about the end ofn term. So today was not as bad as yesterday. Thats all there is to report today. I will post later with tonites news about my life.   signing off

      So i suppose i will post this up here then. I supposei should explain why i am depressed. My school is a prep school there fore it goes to year 8. In year six i was trying to leave. I was planing to do my exams in febuary and my mum out of kindness had got a tutor for me. One day i was leaving my tutor and i heard my mum and her talking. My tutor was like "I dont think he is going to get into the school" and my mum said "No none of us do". That hit me hard. So i took the exams and failed like they said i would and then my gran died and then i had sats and i didnt do as well as i should have done and i had a nervous break down kind off thing. Well Year 7 was ok and then year 8 (my current year). The Final year t my school which i have been at for 10 years. My mum put me into over revise and the stress levels started. They still didnt think i would get into the school i wanted and even if i did it wont be as good as my oh so perfect brother who got 2 scholarships to the same schools. I revised while being low and sad. I did the exams and i got into both schools. You may think this would make me happy but it just hit how badly i was going to miss my current school.  For my whole life i have known i am gay. Well in the easter break i just came out to my self. Which was so hard and thats when i started badly. i told a few friends and then the "cool guy" at my school found out. Now when he does not like something i can feel it. He ignored me for about 2 weeks and i felt like utter shit (mind my swearing sorry). I told my other friends that i was gay too. They were ok but since then they r distant from me. Well this cool guy told all his mates and then the other cool people found out and well... they have such a big infulence on everyvody else that i just couldnt cope. Then for a while i had like loved the original "cool guy" (if u still follow) and well i told some one that i shouldnt have told and they told him and for the past 2 weeks now i have been so sad i cant lift my head. I lock my self in my room and just cry. Well i have to prentend to be over him just so he doesnt make me feel like shit. And i told my closest most important friend and she was like oh that must be hard but u have to tell ur brother. And i just felt bad. She did not care about me but my brother and now the whole skool knows about me and i didnt want them to and the staff know tho they havnt said nothing there are comments that have been made and everybody is just different to me and my family is falling apart and my brother is in trouble and i am cutting my self.  That is my story. It is pethetic i know but i am not a strong person at all.I cant cope with anything.

      I dont expect to have any replies to this blogg. Most likely beacuse people just dont care when it comes to me. Which may sound really self centered but it is true. At my school which i have been at for 10 years not on of the teahchers would regongise me as a person.I am just one of the rich brats that can afford to go to a private schoool. i have no place in life. My parents are very good to me. They love me but we are not a close family. I have everything i could of wished for. i have a perfect house i have lots of material things but inside of me i have nothing. I am sure this blogging thing is full of people saying they r sad and depressed which most people are. And earlier this year i came out of the closet as they say. And it was the worst thing i could of done and becacuse of that i am worse than i had been for two years of my worthless painful life.

      this past week has been awful! I just cant cope with this and i have to put up this whole thing for people but today one saw through it but anyway. I just seem to think that my "friends" cant cope with me being sad and lonly and depressed and so they r pushing me away from them selves. I mean my best friend has now like become best friends with my other friend (and this may sound petty but they are all i have ) and well they have all there things and i have nothing. I am sure they want me out of their little "group" and so i am moving. I spend all my time at school on my own now and they dont miss me. I just cant seem to fit in with them. But i have 2 days left at the prep so it wont last for long right? I was looking at my mates phone and there was a txt from SAM! It went on to say: "what r u saying to him aparently he is cronically depressed. why what has he said to you?" I never talk about my friends behind their backs ever unless it is praise. I would rather they said it to my face (as one did) and even then that involved them bitching about me so i dont have any friends i have decided. i mean people only hurt you i am better off without them.

      As people who read this will know i have had a blog before. Well i have started again and this time it is what i really feel and not what people want to hear me say! So i have had it with me having to be all happy for people! Just cos they got tired of me being the way i am! You may think what the hell is this mad person going on about Let me explain. After i started this blog things happened and if you have the read the 1st one the address is here.   urlLink   .Well It seems like "people as sam put it had had enough of me like a little comment he made: Sam was saying that no one cared about him (which is shit!) and i was like no one cares about me here and he said "Alim people stopped caring for you ages ago." Now soon after this happened me and sam had a fight and well he called me and said people he had talked to had had enough of me being like the way i was (which was not letting anyone help me and sad all the time ) but i only did it cos i knew that they didnt care! so why should i tell some person who doesnt really care about what i do feel that i am depressed and cutting my self. So for the last week or so i have been putting up my act again for other people. And i am going to continue doing so cos people dont care. I know some do but the people that i see regularly dont give a shite about the way i feel. And i do with them although i may not show it i can tell when someone is upset or something because i am good at reading body languge. But back to what i was wasting time about. Perhaps i do need to see someone or tell My most lovely form tutor (who i love to bits) about me cutting my self. She might be able to help me get through this but some how i doubt it i am just so weak and i have no inner strength left to fight this endless battle. And i know i should be happy about glasto which was soo good but i just cant be not on the inside. The novalty has worn off with it. I just dont know how to feel happyness properly i mean even during glastonbury i felt crap which is better than i did before but there were things like my brother and Jess just going off together all the time and leaving me on my own and my brother and jess taking the piss out of me all the time. And so i have given up once again it seems i  have been beaten again. Or perhaps i never beat it and it was playing dead. Well we shall see won't we.
