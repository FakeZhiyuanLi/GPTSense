So, I may not be here often. Whatever. Well, take care.  This is Aman, Signing off...For a while.   Songs  that kinda have things to do with my life and how I feel:  "I don't know what's worth fighting for, or why I have to scream. I don't know why I instigate and say what I don't mean. I don't know how I got this way, I'll never be alright, so I'm breaking the Habit tonight..." -Linkin Park "Breaking the Habit"  -The Yeah Yeah Yeahs "Maps" -Seether Ft. Amy Lee "Broken" -Linkin Park "In the End" -Simple Plan "Perfect" -Blink 182 "I miss you" -Slipknot "wait and Bleed" -Our Lady Peace "Innocent" -Avril Lavigne "Tomorrow" -Puddle of Mudd "Blurry"  And a lot of other songs, but I bet you're getting sick of reading them, so I'll end it at that. Buh bye.

      Well, I don't think there was much to say about my day. It wasn't so bad. I frikkin' miss Zakc, and my friends. I know I've said that A million times, but it's so hard to feel isolated from all of your friends. I don't even know what being sane is anymore. He has been foremost in my thoughts...It kills me to think that on Wednesday, it will be our 10 month anniversary, and I can't see him, or talk to him...Stupid life. But hey, what can I do? Like I said before, I gotta stay strong.   Anyways, I have provincials and crap to get through. Blah. Can't wait until it is all over. It'll be fun. Mhmm...  Well, That's it for my rant. I'm not really in the mood to talk about stuff anymore. Don't know why...I just feel...Bleh. FRIK I MISS HIM :(...  This is Aman, Signing off ...

      Well...Back from school today!! Had to write a provincial examination. It really wasn't as hard as I expected it would be. Meh! Yup, yup. Tee hee, I'm on the phone with my AShley right now. Blah. She's so cute! She has too much homework. Meh. School is alomost out, though, so WOO HOO!!  Anyways, getting to my day. It wasn't so bad. The weather totally sucks. I'm getting so sick of looking at the grey sky. I want to see some sun. Mhmm...Well, meh. I know, I say that quite a bit. Anyways, about the provincial. We had to think up of 3 Life lessons we'd like to pass on to the next generation. Here were my Three :  1.] Act as if there is no one to imrpress but yourself. 2.] Be your own person, you are capable of making your own decisions. Don't follow the crowd. 3.] If you want the rainbow, You have got to put up with the rain  Hey, I guess I can relate to all three of those. ESPECIALLY # 3. It's probably the truest statement that I have ever heard of. But yeah, I just felt like sharing that.   Now, for some pictures. Woot!! Lol. They're all from my friends b-day party on the 5th of this month. Enjoy. =)=)!!

      No matter what you're going through, friends are always there. Since always, I have known how much my friends have done for me, but I have never given them enough recognition. So here I go...  Ashley Khan, Michelle (Mica), Laura Howat, Harpal Bhambra, Raveena Kang, Jon Digno, Steph Melara, Chris Lewis, and Tyler Reaugh...Thank you all for helping me through this. Means a lot. Love you lots.  So today, the day wasn't too bad. School was actually fun. I have a provincial for english tomorrow. Woot, woot!!...Right. Lol. I came home, and I signed onto MSN messenger, and I started to talk to a couple of friends, and well, stuff happened. But the turnout was good (Thanks to Ashley). Now I'm assured that my boyfriend and I will stay together after the 2 month period of not seeing or talking to eachother...But I was supposed to know that...I suck!! Lol. I need to have more faith. I was just afraid. But hey, Life is full of tests. You have to prove your strength, or lose. The choice is yours. Heh. Encouraging, don't you think? So, My decision is as follows : Spend more time with friends, and wait until the end of this, and then...I CAN SEE HIM =D!! There's nothing else I can do to meliorate the situation. If I keep being stupid like I am, I may just make it more dire. So, If all else fails, wait it out. BLAH!! I know it sucks, but it all works out for the best. Everything happens for a reason.  Woo hoo!! Well, that was my load of crap today! Feels good to get that off of my chest. Whew! Well, I shall be back tomorrow to rant on again.   This is Aman, signing off.

      Meh...I'm trying this blog thing out. Thanks Mica, for letting me know about it. Let's see if this helps.   Stuff is Tough. Parents are assholes (pardon my language), and sometimes it feels as if no one really cares. I don't really understand why things work out the way they do...But, meh. Blah. I really miss him...My boyfriend. I love him so much, but my parents seem to think that "Young love" is a sack of Crap...That's what I think of what they think. Frikkin' 2 months without seeing him, talking to him...It's so hard. I've never been put up to a challenge so difficult. I mean, this isn't just all about me. It's about him, too. I really wonder what he's thinking...And how he feels...I'm just worried. I really hope things work out. Blah.  Anyways...About me...My name is Aman, I'm 16, Go to Frank Hurt Secondary, and I am in the 10th grade. Time is passing by so fast right now. Just for the school part of it, anyway. Yeah...2 weeks, and school is over...Well, a week and a half, I'd say. Meh, meh, and meh.  Well, that's it for my rant. Thanks again, Mica, for telling me to try this out...Maybe it'll help with the time consumption. =).

      No sé qué decir. Realmente me confunden con mi vida. Una cosa que soy realmente feliz es alrededor que tengo gente realmente grande de los amigos..., nunca, me olvido SIEMPRE que sus amigos... sus amigos serán siempre allí si la gente no . Recuerde eso. Pueble quién hará una pausa el cuidado para usted su lateral... que sea todo...  En cuanto a mi amor... si él realmente me ama, creo que él allí me esperará, y el mes de la espera... A de I can't es largo, pero por lo menos no está por siempre. Te amo Zakc. No importa qué sucede en el extremo, le amaré siempre... le agradezco... que esta espera va a ser larga y difícil de descubrir, pero solamente nos hará... una ESPERANZA más fuerte de I...Usted me inspira a que sea una persona mejor, más fuerte... que esperaré mientras tengo que, apenas para estar con usted. Gracias... tanto...  Stephy, gracias por ser un tan buen amigo. Te amo tanto, y usted es como una hermana a mí. Usted no tiene ninguna idea cuánto usted significa a mí. Gracias por TODO que usted ha hecho, y todo usted es dong inmóvil a ayudar. Gracias por dejarme saber que le tendré siempre.  Ése es todo lo que tengo que decir...   Apenas porque usted puede ver, no significa que usted no está oculto...
