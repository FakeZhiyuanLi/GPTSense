      Well, this is just turning out to be a crappy day. I went to go see my wedding cake baker today at 2:00 as scheduled. I had MONEY for him. Was he there? No. Is this the first time this has happened with a wedding vendor? No. Whatever happened to professionalism? (sigh)  On a more positive note, I found some  excellent  sugar-free cookies. I just picked them up because they were on sale at Kroger's. (Buy one get one free! Who can resist?) Oh, and they had a massive display to try them before you buy them. As it was very early in the morning (I went before work a couple of days ago) they hadn't been picked over and didn't look gross. So I tried them and they are great! I'm going to buy some for my grandfather for Father's Day because he loves sweets but he's diabetic. Besides not being as moist as I am used to, I couldn't really tell the difference between these cookies and regular sugar-laden ones. Check it out:  urlLink Joseph's Sugar-Free Cookies.  I purchased the Soft & Scrumptios Bite-Size Pecan Walnut Brownies and the Crispy Bite-Size Chocolate Walnut Cookies. A note of warning, though, the Crispy Chocolate cookies are not exactly what I would call crispy.

      So, I left my house today before eight for my 18 mile commute. What time did I get to work? 9:18. Yeah. It kind of sucked. Apparently, somebody installed a parking lot on 1-85 while I was sleeping last night and didn't notify the Atlanta population. (Which the entire portion of decided to use 85 this morning... or so it seemed.)   I usually get to work around 8:30. I like getting here early because it gives me time to eat breakfast, read the news, unwind. Today, I get here late, and I am just now scarfing down a banana and hurredly typing this in so I can unleash the frustration... To add insult to injury, Joe (my fiance) likes to point out that his commute is only 12 minutes. And he lives in L.A., which is famous for bad traffic. In his defense, he is  south  of L.A....  Argh! I HATE being late! Bad way to start the day...  Oh, and at least the AJC could have done a blurb about whether something caught fire or spontaneously exploded, but not even a whisper about what the hold up was.

      Well, I have had this blogger for about two years now and have never used it. I decided to actually write in it today so that I could record my last month of single-hood. It's a scary thought. Once I go through with this whole marriage thing, I will never be able to go back to 'single' status. 'Divorced' or 'widowed' are my only options. And as a practicing, really truly believing Roman Catholic, divorce is not an option. Terrifying. So, this is my swan song to single-hood.  I will miss being able to buy shoes without thinking, "Well, I shouldn't really because now it is  our  money." Sigh.    And in the news...     urlLink More proof of the self-centeredness of our generation:    Two apparent suicide tries forced the closing of two Atlanta area interstates Tuesday, raising concern among officials that media reports are fueling a copycat trend.  The two incidents were the  third  and  fourth  times in  three  months a metro interstate has been closed because of suicide threats.    Now, this is just getting ridiculous. Call me harsh, but these people just want the attention. Unfortunately, while there may be some sick people out there, I think that these guys just want to be on television. Men, when they really want to commit suicide, do it and do it effectively. These yahoos just want the attention. They have learned that in Atlanta, a sure-fire way to get that is to threaten to jump off a bridge. They have learned (by example) that are no legal repurcussions while they can still bask in the limelight. Call me politically incorrect (it's a compliment to me!), but our law enforcement agencies need to start arresting these attention-mongers. What they are doing is dangerous to our police force and to the drivers below them. And really frickin' annoying. THROW THEM IN JAIL!
