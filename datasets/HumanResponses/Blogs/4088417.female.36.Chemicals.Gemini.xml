      Its Friday...  I went and took my preemployment drug test, got my background check paperwork in etc. I got my offer letter last night. The only downside is that if I leave the 'company' within 12 months I will have to repay the sign on bonus...what if I die? I guess it wont matter much.  Anyway, I still cant decide if I am excited or stressed at this point. 'They' want me to start on Sept 1, that doesn't give me much time to make sure all my bases are covered here. I feel like its going to take a lot longer than a week to get my boss up to speed so that I feel comfortable knowing he can take over everything and not feel lost. He is not the most computer literate person.  Oh yeah and we had our acceptable use policy meeting today as well, I will probably get fired for writing in my blog right now...meh.  Anywho...I am so glad its friday, I plan to be super lazy this weekend since I will be pulling 11 hour days, well actually 13 if you count drive time, all next week. I know its not that bad in comparison to certain other people who pull 36ers...heh. But still, that's a long day for me considering all my other responsibilities. And it doesn't look like I am going to be able to take an extra day or two off between jobs. Oh well. It would have been nice.  My boss tells me 'they' are not as polished as they appear to be, I don't know if he is trying to scare me or what. I am def an order type of gal, I need order, I deal with enough chaos in my own mind I don't need any more elsewhere. I have to have clear direction, a clear purpose, and a sterling clear plan of action, which I have none of here, which is why I am leaving, that and I am sick of the drive. And a few other reasons I care not to get into while I am still being paid...heh.  Actually I should probably come in this weekend and tidy up, you know box up my belongings etc, clear out my space so I don't have to deal with any of that in the end, I can just walk.  The price of oil is up, that's a good thing. I was watching CNN while I waited to be called for my test...gasp...I know I actually watched the news. But anyway they were talking about this stock scam in which you get this message on your machine informing you of some stock secret and it appears to be a wrong number...I got that call. Of course I am smart enough not to fall for such obvious endeavors but still I thought it was kind of funny. I never answer the phone unless I can see who it is on Caller ID and this call came across as unknown so of course I didn't answer, I just listened to the message thinking, what the heck? It was kind of a funny message, the chick was supposedly eating and all, I guess to try and add some authenticity to it rather than it sound like a computer or salesperson. I wonder what would have happened if I had answered the phone, since this scam is about leaving a supposed wrong number message...  I am so tired of incompetent people I could torch the next one. Last night I went to get school supplies, a huge list I might add, how in the hell do they expect these kids to carry all this stuff? I mean when I was in school all we needed was some paper and a pencil. Now they have to have a special binder for each subject, dividers, dry erase markers, regular markers, map pencils and on and on...its ridiculous. Anyway that's not my point and I do have one believe it on not, well maybe just a rant, but still, onward ho. So I went to Office Max last night and all I had was my checkbook with me in the way of funds etc. So we go in with this monster list in hand and the first thing I do is ask the clerk if they take checks, she says yes in her oh so uneducated hood-like southern way...  OK great, so off we go to fill up a basket with everything she needs, meanwhile I am still in my work attire and wearing very high heels, my feet are killing me before I even stepped foot in the store. Lil j had a flute lesson so I didn't have time to go home and change first. Anyway, so we spend the next nearly two hours shopping for this stuff, get everything together and head to checkout. The clerk starts scanning stuff and I pull out my checkbook and proceed to write a check.  Can anyone guess what happened next?  "Oh Im sorry 'mam we cant take no checks."  huh? Its the first damned thing I asked when I walked into the place...  "oh our here machines have been down and we cant take no checks..oh wait...heeeey Laquisha can yous runz a check?" "Nuh uh girl you know our machines be down."  Idiots. The lot of them.  So we left without any supplies. I made the leap of faith this morning and gave lil j 30 bucks to buy some stuff at the school store...I wonder if she will actually come home with any. Its silly that they give you this monster list and expect you to have it in 48 hours. What, is like every mother there a stay at home mom with nothing better to do than go school supply shopping? Please, I have to work for a living, I don't have the pleasure of leaching of some unfortunate sap's paycheck or welfare, give me a break. blech.  I guess I better get off the computer now, I have used up almost 30 minutes and since I know they are def counting now....  toodles.

      I didn't get my offer letter yet, perhaps it will be in the box when I get home tonight. Its kind of a flurry of activity here at work trying to make sure that my boss has all the programs he needs that I have, and then I have to train him how to use them. Plus I have a bunch of filing I have been putting off that now I have to do. Oh joy.  This page seriously needs some orange...*sigh* maybe just a touch of it somewhere...  I NEED ORANGE!  :D  Anyway.  I am getting excited, and anxious at the same time. I really did try to get up at 6 this morning and I just couldn't do it. I will have to force myself this next week to get up at 5 and get to work by at least 6:30 or 7 so I can get used to the change before I actually have to do it. Poor lil j...every other Friday she will have to go with me at this ungodly hour and then sit at starbucks down the street from her school for 3 hours waiting for sectional rehearsals to begin. She is going to be one tired puppy.  So as it turns out, my 'references' love me enough to provide some serious fluffage. It was very nice of them and I will have to send them something cool once I start at the other company as a show of gratitude. My 'friend' however thought that he had blew it for me because he was in a bad mood and had been working outside all day when 'they' called. So he was afraid to tell me that they had called because he thought he had seriously botched it for me. He was happy to learn that was not the case.  Well I suppose I should actually do some work...tidy up and stuff.

      Ok so I finally decided to do what I said I would do, parse up my pages to match the misfired synapses in my grey matter.  That said, this part of my blog will be what I will call the lighter side of me or what I may affectionately refer to as the front nine, which will amount to basic ramblings just because I feel like writing or what have you, stuff I want to explore, rants and raves to an extent, but nothing too personal. Bound and gagged will remain what it started out to be, a place where I can vent and explore the darker side of me, the place where I will ultimately either learn to love or destroy my demons once and for all, the back nine.  Eventually I will most likely get bored of the entire format and look for a server where I can host my own personal webspace to do whatever I want in as many formats as I want. For now though I enjoy tinkering with the code and making it my own. Its a good vehicle really for learning what I will need to know in the long run.  So there you have it, the two sides of the coin.    *For now.*
