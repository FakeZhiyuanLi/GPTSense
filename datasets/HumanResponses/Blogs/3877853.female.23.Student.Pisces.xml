       Okay, so I am really bored, but I also think I might have mono.&nbsp; I also come from a long line of hypochondriacs, and I thought I had it beat.&nbsp; Apparently I don't.     &nbsp;   Also, bad news with the sketch show.&nbsp; Well, I don't think it's bad news, necessarily, but it's going to suck.&nbsp; Dan and I had a  long  talk about it yesterday, and figured that it might not be the worst idea in the world to put it off for, maybe, several months, until we can do it right.&nbsp; If that means doing it next summer when we have enough money to rent equipment and have tried to get ourselves into the comedy scene then so be it.&nbsp; I don't think Rob and Vicki are going to be so enthused about the idea.&nbsp; I don't even care any more.&nbsp; I just want to go home.

        urlLink  New York's Premier Alternative Newspaper. Arts, Music, Food, Movies and Opinion      Stop the presses! People think Howard Stern is an asshole? No way!   You still think Giuliani is a dick even after his saintly post-9/11 behavior? Ooh, what a risky and alternative position to take.   Janeane Garofalo and David Cross suck because their comedy is infused with political commentary? Holy shit, I better move to Kansas, because if I ever run into these people in New York I might just vomit in terror!   Seriously, New York Press? I've never read anything else from your publication before, and I only read this article because   urlLink  David Cross    said he was in it. I can see that you're trying to work the alternative hipster appeal.&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me tell you something:     Everyone hates Rupert Murdoch.&nbsp;     Everybody thinks James Lipton is pretentious.    Everyone knows Sarah Jessica Parker has a big nose.    Janeane Garofalo, no matter what your opinion of her comedy is, can't really be described as a "second-rate comedian."&nbsp; She's, like, a household name, people!     This is why I could never be a journalist.

       Is there something about me that's just inherently unboneable?&nbsp; Is it the fact that I wear men's camo shorts?&nbsp; That I haven't plucked my eyebrows in weeks due to sheer laziness?&nbsp; The distinct air of desperation wafting from my every pore?     &nbsp;   I don't think I'm going to bone The Phoenix.&nbsp; We had another writing session tonight, him, James, and me.&nbsp; We finished by 2:30.&nbsp; Awesome for the feat of playwrighting, sucks for the "Spend as much time as humanly possible with The Phoenix" plan.&nbsp; I smoothly ask if one of the guys will walk me home.&nbsp; Yes, it's just down the street, but who knows what kind of Welsh crazies lurk in the shadows in the middle of the night?&nbsp; He offers to do it.&nbsp; Good sign, right?&nbsp; Here's why I think we are not destined to cleave (as the fabulous   urlLink Nick Twisp  would say):&nbsp; yes, I think we have delightful chemistry together.&nbsp; At least, for our first few encounters, when we hadn't really talked and didn't really know each other.&nbsp; But now we've spent a decent amount of time together (any time you're with someone for over 24 hours straight shoots you up to a whole new level of bonding) and we're still at that same point.&nbsp; The natural chemistry can only take you so far, you see.&nbsp; We're still at that point where we don't really talk about anything, except for, "So, that play we just wrote," or "Wow, only three weeks til Edinburgh."     So perhaps not.&nbsp; But let's keep a positive outlook.&nbsp; Only time will tell.    Anyway, the play we wrote is really awesome, and we came up with the idea in less than an hour and all together it probably only took four, maybe four and a half hours to write.&nbsp; Which is a really good sign for  urlLink Hardcore .         &nbsp;    Just so I can be cool like everybody else...(that sounds mocking but actually I really like when people do this)       Watching:     Seinfeld.&nbsp;  Just finished "The Secret Code," now onto "The Pothole."       Reading:&nbsp;     Even Cowgirls Get the Blues. &nbsp; Have had it for about five years, just started it.       Listening:    The last song to come through on the iTunes was "All 4 Love" by Color Me Badd.&nbsp; Then I caught Felice cheating and the band serenaded me at the Peach Pit.

       My gay boyfriend has a girlfriend.&nbsp; This isn't a recent development or anything, but it's just something weird that I can write about.     &nbsp;   I met my wonderful friend Rob when I started the improv show in October.&nbsp; As he would say, I fancied him immediately.&nbsp; He is adorable, after all.&nbsp; But I honestly wasn't sure if he was gay.&nbsp; (Looking back, it's like not noticing someone has three arms.)&nbsp; Our castmate Vicki felt the same way.&nbsp; Only she spent a lot more time with Rob than I did.&nbsp; One day it came out (no pun intended) that yes, he was gay.&nbsp; Alright, sucks for me and Vicki, but no big deal, he's still awesome and we're all still great friends.     &nbsp;   Then, I come back from Christmas break, and guess who's dating?&nbsp; Rob and Vicki!&nbsp; The gay man and the woman!&nbsp; It took me a while to get past the whole "But you're gay" thing, until one day I said to myself, "Hey, it's their relationship, not yours, and if they're cool with it you should be too, so just deal."&nbsp; And I dealt, and I think they are a lovely couple and I really think they're gonna make it.     &nbsp;   The greatest part about it is that Rob is so totally still my gay boyfriend.&nbsp; He&nbsp;listens to me cry about guys&nbsp;and tells me when I'm being a freak.&nbsp; We watch bad TV and movies together and bitch about everyone we know.&nbsp; He tells me I look like crap.&nbsp; All of the wonderful things a gay boyfriend is supposed to do and - bonus for him! - he gets to have a real girlfriend too.     &nbsp;   The only downside is that now I can't offer to be the only woman he ever sleeps with.

      All the good ones are taken, or gay, or out of their fucking minds.  &nbsp;  I was going to tell a whole story about how I arrived at that conclusion, but I decided against it.&nbsp; I don't have to.&nbsp; You know.&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;

       Today I was pretty much the bitchiest person alive, except for like fifteen minutes when I was talking to The Phoenix.     &nbsp;   (The Phoenix is, obviously, a code name.&nbsp; Because I like to pretend I'm still in high school, I have to create a fake name for the guy I'm interested in.&nbsp; In fact, we call the whole operation to get me to hook up with him "Project Phoenix."&nbsp; I'm aware that this is also the name for some scientific thing.&nbsp; My friend the astrophysicist came up with it.)     &nbsp;   Anyway, went to see  Spiderman 2  with a bunch of people today.&nbsp; The movie was at 12:30.&nbsp; Why would anyone go to a movie that early?&nbsp; So that's why I thought I was being bitchy.&nbsp; But then we got lunch and when we got to the theater and met up with everyone else The Phoenix was there, so I obviously put my best face on and was all smiles and giggles and batting eyelashes.     &nbsp;   After the movie we all went our separate ways.&nbsp; Rob &amp; Vix went to do their shopping, James and his Vikki went to do their shopping, Peter J. went to Pizza Hut, and The Welshman went to the Orange shop (no doubt influenced by Mr. Dresden and the greatest series of movie advertisements in history*).&nbsp; The Phoenix was going to the library.&nbsp; I, conveniently, was going to the post office - in the same direction as the library.&nbsp; Poor Dan made the mistake of asking if I wanted to wait for him to get a cable for his iPod and walk back with him.&nbsp; My rare blend of desperation and hormones shot him down in a particularly bitchy fashion.     &nbsp;   I hadn't even seen The Phoenix in over three weeks.&nbsp; We are star-crossed.&nbsp; Just being able to walk back from town with him was enough to make me squeal with glee.&nbsp; (Text I sent to Rob afterwards: "Eeeeeeeee!")&nbsp; So we walked back and chatted and it was lovely.&nbsp; Apparently now he lives, like, an hour's walk away, which explains why I never see him around town, and also  sucks .&nbsp; But we'll be writing together next week which is cool.     &nbsp;   But the point of this was my bitchiness, which apparently Dan had only gotten a taste of earlier.&nbsp; Rob, Dan and I got together later to do some sketch writing and, as per usual, Dan and I were clashing on some key issues.&nbsp; I bitched him out but good.&nbsp; I basically told him next time he condescendingly over-explained something to me we would have some major issues.     &nbsp;   And the perfect way to end this?&nbsp; I am, of course, watching  Degrassi , and J.T. and Toby are buying condoms.&nbsp; Toby comments on the different flavors, and J.T. says, "Too bad they don't have bacon!"&nbsp; What a great show.   &nbsp;    &nbsp;   (* The Orange Ads :&nbsp; If you live outside of the UK and don't have the privilege of the Orange pre-movie ads, I don't know what to tell you.&nbsp; They're brilliant, Spike Lee rocks, and don't let a mobile phone ruin  your  movie.)

       urlLink Cold Turkey, by Kurt Vonnegut   My one hope is that if I ever get famous enough to choose which other famous people I get to meet, that Kurt Vonnegut is alive and has a listed phone number.

       The Early Morning Stomachtime Blues   or  Why I Will Never Have a "Real" Job   It all stems from the fact that I don't go to "real" school.  Well, it starts earlier than that.  Whenever I wake up really early for work I always feel like I'm going to puke for about an hour or so, until I actually start working and I forget about it.  It made sense when I used to have to get up for work at 6:00 am.  Now, however, waking up "early" for me means before 11.  I had to cover a shift at 11:30 today, which meant I had to get up and shower and stuff at 10.  I thought I was going to die.  There's so many people who hate me right now.  But, like I said, it's because I don't really go to school and I work in a pub.  Unless I work another 11:30-3 shift, I really never have to wake up before 2 in the afternoon.  To be honest, I don't really have to wake up until 7:00 at night.  But that would be odd.  In other news, I saw the  Curb Your Enthusiasm  season finale today (yes, it's taken this long).  Without trying to spoil anything, it contained the most brilliant double bluff I've ever seen on television.  Brilliant show, that  Curb.   Larry David, if you need a staff writer, I'll be back in New York in October.  I'm not dying to move out to L.A., but I'll take what I can get, you know?

       urlLink The N: The N on TV: Degrassi: Get A Shot at a Spot on Degrassi Sweepstakes   First of all, I love that little Blog This thing or whatever it's called.  It's so inspiring.    But the main reason I'm writing this is because I have a problem.  A Degrassi: The Next Generation problem.  I'm watching the episode that my mom  sent me from the U.S. on home-recorded DVD  and there was an ad for a contest to be on Degrassi!  So obviously, I go straight to  urlLink the-n.com  and check out the rules.  Of course, you have to be between 12-17 to enter the contest.  So no dice, sadly.  But if anyone in that age range happens to read this before October 1, 2004, please enter on my behalf.  (Not that I couldn't pass for 17, apparently.  I get carded at pubs here all the time.  And the drinking age is 18.  I had to show ID a few weeks ago when I bought an 18* rated movie.  The high school kid at Virgin Records asked me how old I was when  buying movies.   And I thought smoking was supposed to cause ageing of the skin.)   * 18 : movie rating that I always assumed was kind of between R and NC17.  I don't really know, though, because the movie that caused all the kerfuffle was Interview with the Vampire.)

      I've tried to start one of these things like eight times before and it never pans out.  It's like I'm the only writer in the world who has no skill for talking crap to strangers for no reason.  With any luck this one will take off.  Probably because I decided today that I'm never going outside again.  Here's the thing.  I love summer, more than almost anything (cigarettes and Pepsi are the two immediate contenders).  I love wearing shorts and tank tops and going swimming and sweating my ass off and not being able to fall asleep because I can't bear to have a blanket touch me and I can't fall asleep without a blanket.  And it infuriates me that it's just not summer here.  I had to wear a sweater today.  A sweater!  It's the middle of freaking July!  Well, as far as the weather goes, New Jersey 1, Wales NIL!*    (* nil : the British equivalent to zero in score-keeping.  ex. "How's the football going?" "Well, it's nil-nil, but it should get exciting in the extra time.")

       urlLink  LHJ Bra Sizer     Don't even ask how I got to the  Ladies' Home Journal  Bra Sizer page.  Anyway, I type in my info, and my result is, "To find a bra that fits you, visit a specialty lingerie shop." Okay, that's a little disturbing.       First of all, it brings back the memories of the horror that was going to   urlLink  local specialty lingerie shop    back home. No offense to them, they're lovely people and good at their jobs...I just don't need strangers putting bras on me all day. And it would be an all-day event. Mom, Grandma, Auntie, my cousin Julie, sometimes my poor poor cousin John, and I would take the trip down there and just spend hours upon hours finding the best bras. Fun for the whole well-endowed family.    Second of all, what am I, a freak of nature? If  LHJ  (which is a very underrated publication) can't give me the answers to bra size, who on earth can? I mean - look - I know I've got big boobs, alright? I would give anything for a B-cup, but that ship sailed about twelve years ago. So I have to wonder, am I just this big weirdo?    Well, then I decided I really wanted some answers. I decided to cheat a little, and go down an inch, and see what they would give me. I wasn't being too careful with the measurements anyway, maybe I was off, please God anything to give me the bosom of a normal, non-gestating human. I got an answer.    30 F.      30 F!!!!      So that settles it, then. I am a freak of nature.              Watching:   about to put on the last disc of  The Simpsons,  season 4, featuring such great episodes as "Last Exit to Springfield," "The Front," and "Whacking Day."      Listening:   "Mr. Blue Sky," by the Electric Light Orchestra.  Also known as "that song that was in the  Eternal Sunshine  trailer but not in the movie."      Reading:   allegedly I'm still reading  Even Cowgirls Get the Blues , but I haven't touched it since the last time I said I was reading it.  I did read  Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory  today, though.                          *A disclaimer: since I don't actually believe that 30F is a real bra size that has or will ever be manufactured, I don't feel I'm revealing too much here.
