      ok, so today, well..........i guess yesterday was brittanys b-day. she was turning the big 16. oh boy was it a big day. i got her 2 pic frames, one in which i decorated myself. i was very proud of myself. i also go her a pink (her fav color) pearl necklace, a black skirt, a dozen roses and a big slice of chocolate cake from outback. se her and i went on our first real date to bucks landing. wow was it good!! i had this huge burger!!! we had fun, threw food at each other as usual for a while then left. we drove around forever lookin for this icecream place she wanted to go to, finally she found it and it was worth the drive to see her so happy. then i took her home. ________ that blank spot represents the one dumb move i made the whole day. then i had to go to work, and britt never called me and i freaked out the whole night. i tried calling katie but she was sooooooooooooooo drunk, so she wasn't much help,. but it jended up britt had been buys and had her ringer off, that women. and then i came home and talked to her until she fell asleep. and now i am about to crash cuz i gotta get up for church tomorrow. my car is suppose to be at church tomorrow for some reason. but yea its freakin 2 in the morning so i'm out like a fat kid in dodgeball...........i love ya britt  goodnight
