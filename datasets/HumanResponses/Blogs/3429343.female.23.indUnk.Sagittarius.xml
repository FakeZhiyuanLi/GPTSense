      -Always try to help a friend in need -Believe in yourself. -BE BRAVE!....but remember... it's ok to be afraid sometimes. -Meet new people, even if they look different to you. -Have a good sense of humor and laugh often. -Love your friends, no matter who they are. -Take an occasional risk. -Every path has some puddles and it's okay to get a little dirty -If God brings you to it, he will bring you through it -Open your arms to change, but don't let go of your values.  “Evil prevails where laughter is not known.” - Iglulik Eskimo saying

      1. Did you know that you are more likely to be killed by a champagne cork than by a poisonous spider? 2. The shortest war in history was between Zanzibar and England in 1896.  Zanzibar surrendered after 38 minutes.  3. Dueling is legal in Paraguay as long as both parties are registered blood donors. 4. A snail can sleep for 3 years.  5. The electric chair was invented by a dentist.  6. The Eisenhower interstate system requires that one-mile in every five must be straight. These straight sections are usable as airstrips in times of war or other emergencies.

      Yes, I am finally moving to my own place out on my own.  Gone are the days of roommates.   I'm moving to this cute little one bedroom place in Durham.  It's quiet (oh what a blessing) so I won't miss the racing boat starting up at midnight setting off all the car alarms, or the caravan of modified fourwheelers roaring by my window.  I will enjoy the birds, setting on my patio and strolling down the rural roads.  I also live in an orchard so I get tons of citrus fruits.  As a bonus, it's closer to my job at the ranch!  And I live right down the street from a park.  It will be so nice to get out of noisy Chico.  The draw back you ask?  Well I won't be able to zip down the street and get Cold Stone ice cream :(  I think I'll manage though.

      This was sent to me and it was just to good to pass up posting it.  10. "They told me at the blood bank this might happen."  9. "This is just a 15 minute power-nap like they raved about in that       time management course you sent me to."  8. "Whew! Guess I left the top off the White-Out. You probably got       here just in time!"  7. "I wasn't sleeping! I was meditating on the mission statement and      envisioning a new paradigm."  6. "I was testing my keyboard for drool resistance."  5. "I was doing a highly specific Yoga exercise to relieve      work-related stress. Are you discriminatory toward people who practice Yoga?"  4. "Damn! Why did you interrupt me? I had almost figured out a      solution to our biggest problem."  3. "The coffee machine is broken..."  2. "Someone must've put decaf in the wrong pot..."  And the #1 best thing to say if you get caught sleeping at work... ".....in Jesus' name. Amen"

      A bullet flies a child dies another mother's broken But they don't stop fighting  and they turn their backs. She cradles her child that left her life and screams "Why, why, Does this make you satisfied My child is dead" Greif sweeps over the weeping mother as she kneals in a pool of blood, and she screams and sobs  for the life of her child

      	At 12 o’clock on everyday 	She lights a candle, 	With nothing to say 	A single tear, shed for one 	A single tear, shed from love  	A wall of names 	She searches his out 	She touches the stone 	The fire’s gone out 	A sea of names 	So many lives 	Too many shames 	But not one fight 	The stories are the same 	But in every fashion 	It came from a love 	It was done out of passion  	She hikes to the spot 	Where the white cross stands 	Back to his, true resting ground 	She touches the same dirt, he did that day 	Her tears fall, where he lay 	She places the flowers, on the ground 	Turning away, from so empty a sound 	She picks herself up 	Blowing a kiss 	It floats on the wind 	Like smoke on a drift 	Back down the mountain 	That took his life 	Never to come home to his kid and wife.

      As I have mentioned in my previous posting, I was adding a kitten to my little apartment in the orchards.  Her name is Jasmine and she's a bundle of energy.  She scales everything.  And I don't mean she climbs and pull herself up, no.  She flys and jumps and thinks she Spiderman, so I nicknamed her Spidercat as she is very good at scaling vertical objects in my apartment that she can get a grip on.  Quite amazing and tiring.  She also think her mommy, that's me, is a jungle gym.  She climbs up my leg and onto my should where she sits like a parrot.  She also attacks my feet and legs when I'm walking so I must shuffle around my apartment.  I have accidentally kicked her across the rooms a few times.  She just shakes it off and runs back to attack.  She also jumps off objects at me when you walk by even though I'm 3 feet away.  But sometimes she does get me.  She doesn't sleep with my right now as she still attacks you even if you're laying perfectly still and she thinks 4am is play time.  She is very cute and great company now that I'm on my own.

      Not only am I now moved into my new place (besides getting everything situated just right), I have a new arrival coming soon.  I will be picking up my new little kitten tomorrow and will be bringing her home.  As I understand it, she is gray with darker gray strips.  I can't wait to pick her up.  Huh.  Is this how it feels when people adopt kids?  I will keep everyone posted once my new addition to the household arrives.
