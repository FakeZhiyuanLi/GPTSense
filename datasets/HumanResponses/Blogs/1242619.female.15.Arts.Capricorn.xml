      hey hey child! i didnt not go 2 the social coz sarah b. was going, i didnt go bcoz they only invited yr 9's from mlc. n i think that that is the same reason y noush didnt go as well. yer... my mum wants 2 c shrek 2 as well... i like cats... We should catch up... ur coming back on the 17....whens that? hold on ill just go and check... thats like three weeks away... we rnt on holidays in three weeks... we are back at school. Did you mean the 7th? well, yes anyway. you still havn't told me ur homephone number! ive asked u like 6000 times on msn? where have u been? well, anyway. you still havnt seen my new house have you? well, i have my own room with my own bathroom. im soo lucky! and i have carpet! my sisters and brothers rooms dont have any carpet.. they have wood on their floor! ha ha ha... my nose is incredibly itchy... o, yes. seeeing as noush isnt here, and hasnt been for a while, ill tell you, shes going 2 cananda for the holidays and i dont think that she is going to be back for like 4 weeks or something. But she is only going to canada if her mum gets better. Noush n i have trying to do a three way wif you for like ages.. but seeing as we dont have ur phone number its been a bit difficult. so yes... tell me your home phone number, but dont post it over the internet because some strange sick person might be reading these n they might ring you. so yes, maybe you could send it 2 me, over hotmail. wow! THIS IS A VERY LONG POST! i like this font alot! but i dont know what it is called. and it doesnt post in this font... aghhh, i better go!!! bai bai wuv caitli xoxo p.s if we dont catch up b4 you leave..

It was so funny they kept on calling us to shut up hehehehe... so Funny :) Why didn't u go to the social? Is it because sarah. b. is goin to be there?  Well...I didn't go either because I had to go watch Shrek 2 it is so funny, I burst out laughin. Lol... How u seen it yet? The cat n the puppy in the movie is so cute, u should watch it I give it 10/10.  Cya Cait  PS: I'm goin to hk for the holidays so catch u up later maybe on saturdays after the term break, because I'll come back of the 17 of July or maybe we could catch up the day after I arrive or maybe something like that.
