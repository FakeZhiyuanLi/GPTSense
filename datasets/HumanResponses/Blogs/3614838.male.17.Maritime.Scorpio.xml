      AnEwAy NtH To PoSt SOOO PoSt AnY CrAp LoR  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ **WARNING** THE FOLLOWING MIGHT BE JUST A CRAP BUT IT MIGHT BE USEFUL  ThIs Is WaD I FeeL... BuT It CaN Be UnReAl...DuN Be PaRaNoiD :D It iS JuSt A CrAp ThInG To ShOw U ThAt HoW ImPoRtAnT Is U In Ur FrEn's HeArt & HoW U LeT ThE PeRsOn KnOw HoW ImPoRtAnT U ArE In Ur HEART.  ------------------------------------------------------------------  I Am SuRe ThAt MaNy PPl ChAt OnLiNe LiKe ICQ, IRC, MSN Messenger and Etc ToDaY I WaNNa CrAp AbOuT HoW I FeeL WhEn I ChAt On The MeSSeNgEr...  1)  WhAt Is MeAnS ???  i)  The Person Replied Immediately AnD U all Chatted Ur Hearts Out. [BEST]  ii) The Person Replied immediately cause he got nth to do online q-v-p|!'. (The Person USED U to cure his boredom hahaz)...No La, anyway replying fast is a way to show sincerity. [SlIGHTLY NOT GOOD THAN BEST]  iii)The Person Replied immediately and after chatted a while the chatroom become quiet because all of u got nth to tok about already. [HMMM NOT THAT GOOD]  iv) U got replied but each time u send the message it takes 2 mins or more for the person to reply. U waited until DIAO ZHA!!! LOLZ [Not GOOD]  v)  The Person nv even bother U. [Very BAD] But In SoMe Case some ppl might be busy or playing game. But it is not a good excuse as u can set to "away" or "Offline"   vi) U Nv See The Person Online at all but during grp conversation he/she appeared to be online...(The person BLOCKED U) [WORST!!!]  2) How To ShoW It ???    ( MOsT ImpOrTaNt To NoT ImPoRtAnt AT ALL ) [Often is it either u care or u dun care at all]  i) Reply as fast as U can.. If U are busy let the person know that u cannot reply that fast. If chatted until nth to talk about, just tok crap la like how r U today??? also can la. Reply to every question asked ...adding emotion also will do. If really talked until nth to talk already or when u want to leave the chatroom, a word of CYA or goodbye take care wuold be nice... :D   ii) If a person u think is troublesome, whom u do not want to talk to ask u something in a conversation. For me if the person has a nice character, i would answer his question and tell him/she that I GTG after he sastify with the answer he/she gets.  But If the person has quite a bad character... i would not bother so much la... hack care la...  If the person has super duper bad character , this person cannot be talking to me cos this type of person i would rather not know...if I haf his/she contact, i would block him/her permenantly and delete off hus contact.... :D U reap what U sow and he/she deserved it :D  BY AngBALiu
