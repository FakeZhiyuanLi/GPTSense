         When you die, there is no light at the end of the tunnel. Your life does not flash before your eyes. Everything just goes black, and that's it.  I know this because I have reached that last moment of existence, and there is nothing here to receive me. There is no life after death, death is exactly what it is, the end of life. You've got your definitions wrong if you think there is more to it than that, but you'll find out soon enough.  Death just happens sometimes. No one really plans for it. Except for the ones who are diagnosed with Cancer or AIDs or some other terminal illness. They get to watch themselves wither away in the mirror.  For me, death just came along and ruined my day.  You hear about this kind of thing all the time on the news. Random accidents where a person's existence just up and disappears. When you read the story, you stop and wonder what it must have been like, but it's no glorified movie if that's what you're thinking.  That car accident on the highway, the one you're going to read about in the paper tommorow, that's me. When you take Driver's Ed., they teach you about what happens in an accident. How there is three collisions. The first is the car into whatever your dumb-ass drove it into, the second is your skull into the windshield/dashboard/wheel, and the third is your brain into your skull. That last one is what kills you, in case you were wondering.  Right now, we're somewhere between 1 and 2. The point where I know I'm fucked, but I don't care. My little old Accord is crumbling in front of me and my head is floating in slow motion towards the windshield. My chest is caving in as I hit the steering wheel at 73 miles per hour.  There's no pain though. In the time it takes that message of pain to jump from neuron to neuron all the way up to my brain, it won't be taking any mail.  The windshield spider-webs, and pushes outward as my forehead, with the skin pulled tight around my skull, is shredded on impact. The glass does its job and contains me in the car, but I'd be just as dead outside the car as I am about to be inside of it.  That was collision #2, and #3 is coming up real soon.  You'd like to think your death scene is going to be this drawn out, slow fading where everyone in your life is there and they confess their love for you. Then you just fade away and go onto Heaven, like death wasn't the real end.  What really happens is you lose control of your car and crash into a guard rail head-on. In a matter of about 3 seconds you've gone from a semi-successful, middle-aged businessman to a pretty useless sack of flesh, muscle, and bones.  Right at this moment, collision #3 is taking place. My brain is crashing into my skull, a little ironic, the hard shell meant to protect it has become the brick wall that is going to kill it. The tissue is suffering intense bruising, blood vessels are tearing apart. One huge subdural hematoma to end it all.  If you still think you're going to go out with a bang, stop fooling yourself. Death is the end. There is nothing you can do about it. Clinging to your religion is not going to save you. Heaven and Hell exist on this very Earth and you've been to both. Heaven is those little moments where everything feels so light. No burdens. No worries. Hell is everything in-between.  You had better make the best of the time you have here, because this is it. Get out of the job you hate, get as much of heaven as you can while you've got the chance. And don't fill yourself up with those fake heavens, they're a lot more hell than you think.  Why do so many people fear death? It's going to happen, get over it. You might as well just welcome it. There is nothing to bother you, not even your own thoughts are there to keep you up.  Your mind will never be clearer than the moment you die.

       I'm working on a new piece of writing. Got what I think is an original idea, although it probably isn't. Hopefully I won't lose interest before it's finished. If I find more time to work on it, expect to see it up here within the next few days.
