      Wow, what a total consortium of incriminating evidence against this administration. Indeed, Bush is president only in name, not in right or action. I sincerly hope he'll be removed from office this next election, for another four years of this political disgust will surley ruin out country. I should go to England...

      Well, I've gone and deleted all of my all bogs, and started anew. As shocked as my dedicated readers will be (currently zero in number), it seems for the best. I was inspired by the Times Magazine article this month. Quite the excellent magazine that one is... my teacher's forcing us on to these things for next year, but its all good, so why argue. In my literary category, I must point out that one should read  The Shadow of the Wind , quite the excellent read, if I do say so. Also, to a lesser extent, I just finished Garth Nix's Abhorsen Trilogy, which is also a very good time for those interested in Fantasty. If you want to discuss some more literature, just send word to brizzle11@yahoo.com and I'll be more than happy to discuss and good literature.  Well, its election time, and I can't stress enough how imperative it is to oust GW Bush. In my sixteen (soon to be seventeen) years of life, I have never seen radically negative change as brought about as Bush. When I was in elementary, during the Clinton era, the national mood was bright, as it usually is in a strong economy. Records were broken in Wall Street, gas prices were bad, but not bloody well murderous, as they are now, and we were pretty cool in the international community. Enter the Bush, and we are spirally towards something reminiscent of the Matrix. The Republican's have stripped democracy away from us, putting their blackened politics into everything from the election to the Patriot Act, which is the most disgusting piece of legislature ever to passed in this country. In fact, if Bush were to see this Blog, he could have me picked up and held captive for an infinite amount of time, with no lawyer and no rights. That's democracy? No, that's Bushism. Please, see Mr. Moore's new movie! If your going, take some friends! That movie really will have the strength to change the election, should enough people have the guts to see it.  IF YOUR A REPUBLICAN,  also see this movie. Go ahead, put your political beliefs to the test. I read Ann cultures book, now you go see Moore's movie (as most republican's would have left the page right now, I decided to embolden those words to at least get one point though). Know thy enemy, though you might be swayed by what you see. Bush cozied right up to the Bin Laden's before 9/11, villains attract villains I suppose.   that's all I have for now. Check back often and spread the word, I'd love to get at least some readers... I'll have a whole lot of time this summer. I may try to post pictures of pages from my Moleskine notebook, as a kind of cool blogging thing. Toss a reply of criticism of congratulations (or literary snippets) at brizzle11@yahoo.com I'd love to talk. Check you all later.

      I must say, these notebooks are the freaking BOMB!! I've written two novels and sold publishing rights using the large ones (no, not any major novels, but it makes some nice money on the side) and the small ones are excellent for everything from schedules to anything goes writing. The smaller ruled notebooks are my favorite to use, as they are big enough to easily write in but small enough to be kept in one's pocket (thus the easy way to keep a planner in you pocket). For writing, I like to use one of two pens. First (and the coolest looking) is the cross ion pen. Very small and very interesting design combined for a great pen. For somthing a little more down to earth, I like to use a regular gel pen... I forget the exact name, but I'll post that later. In any case, get the cross ion at Office Max and the moleskine at Borders, and be set to have some writing inspiration!  Cheers, empire11
