      So this will be my only post from England seeing as it is so hard to get to a Internet Cafe and I did not bring a laptop so I could get on at my hotels....anyways...England is so awesome and I am totally loving everything about it...castle ruins, beautiful lakes, great country side, wonderful sceneary....nothing could be better...except home.  I find myself (espically now) missing home more than every.  I am looking forward to everything about home.  Seeing Meeta =), friends, room, BED!!, lol...but truly I do miss all of you and truly want to get back there.  Espically someone =)...  But so far I have seen like 5 or 6 castles and today we went to the Royal Palace where the Queen lives when she is in Scotland...really cool and she lives a damn nice life!!  Loch Ness was really cool although I did miss out on the monster lol.  Been to numerous cathedrals and churches (at the least 10) and all of them are totally breathtaking...the time these people took to build these things is very impressing.  All the major sites in London ive seen and yeah...just really cool cause its stuff you wont see anywhere else (culturaly wise)  There is truly nothing more strange than drving on the LEFT side of the road!! lol  Stonehenge was very impressing and mysterious all at the same time.  Prolly one of my more favourite sites (thats how they spell favorite lol)  Yeah, the culture is really weird and a lot different that the U.S.  Oh yes, the tour group....so we got on the tour bus on the 14th and yeah, I only knew my 5 other family memebers that were with me.  But no more than 20 mins after we got on the bus we find out that like 10 people on it are from Texas and 4 of them live in Cat Hollow!!  Fricking weird if you ask me.  I mean what are the possibilities of that...  So yeah, when I get back I am making a whole new blog just about this trip with pictures and yah...should be really cool...Ive takin over 400 pictures and will have over 700 by the end of the trip so it should be full of picutres...Looking forward to making it.  Alright well Im gonna go and get off to my Scottish evening which looks pretty cool.  I miss all of yall a lot and look forward to getting home (less than a week!!!)  and this goes out to a person that should know who she is...  I miss you so much and cant wait to see you when I get back...sorry i cant call as much as I would like...the time difference sucks.  I miss you so much and love everything about you...will see you when i get home...  alright...lata days...  england just isnt the same without you here....

      so todays entry will prolly be my final one for the month seeing as i dont get back from england till the the 28th and well, thats basically the whole month.  As i have said before, I have very mixed emotions on the whole trip because yeah, the trip is gonna be AWESOME!!!  I mean im going to 4 different countries over the next three weeks, who wouldnt be totally head-over-heels ready to go right?  Well in my case, wrong.  Through all the excitment I feel everytime i think about the trip, its whenever i dont think about it (which suprisingly enough is often) i think of things that i am going to miss so much when im gone.  I know its not like forever and blah blah blah, just three weeks but to those people i feel like me going is letting them down in someway...i dunno.  I will miss you all for the next three weeks but it is guranteed that i will be back...that i can promise.  I can also promise that anyone that wants a postcard etc. if they just tell me, they will get one. lol...so yeah....  so today went alright and i got a lot of stuff done.  went to appointments all day till 3 (3 of them!) and then came home and watched the rain....kinda a gloomy day and actually made me kinda depressed until someone just came right out and appoligized to me.  That really made me feel like I was important and that she really DID care what happend to us and if we were friends cause for the longest time, i thought she didnt.  Felt really good to know that and actually made my day a whole lot better. Thanks! he rest of the day was spent with my older brother and seeing him for the last time prolly this summer seeing as he has so much going on with baseball and all the other sports he does.  I do idolize him in what he does....the commentment he shows day in and day out all summer long and all year with baseball is truly amazing.  I do play hockey a lot but not near as much as he plays baseball....truly inspiring to me and my career (if you can call it that) in hockey.  So yeah, good seeing him and he will be missed of the course of the summer....  So i guess ill explain a little of my trip in here to yall because i think a lot of people are confused as to what i am doing over there...we are not just going to england and we are DEF not just going to london. lol  It is a three week journey (as i call it) all accross the British Isles.  We go to England (yes we will go to London) lol) Scottland, Whales, and of course PARIS!!!!!!! (my parents planned that just for me =) So yeah, should be lots of fun...going with 2 of my cousins, grandma, mom and dad, brother (younger) and friend....lots of fun but home will be missed.    so tommorow is full of packing and then tommorow night will be spent with the one i think I will miss the most...meeta...this past month and a half have truly been amazing and am sorry that i have to go for so long at such a good time in our relationship....i will be back though that is for sure...and we will be fine and make it through these next three weeks.  There is no one that I would rather be with right now and am so happy and loucky to have you....you truly are an amazing person....dont go changing while im gone....whatever that may mean =).....  so i am extremly tired now seeing as that i had to wake up extremely early to go to all my appointments so im out...everyone have a GREAT month of june and I will see everyone in late june when i return....lata days.....  "...Everything is gonna be alright Everything is gonna be alright Everything is gonna be alright Be strong. Believe...."

      so today marked the first day in a while that i have stayed home the whole entire day without going anywhere with anyone, and it sure did make an impact on my mood too.  i got up at 10 and power washed around the house all morning...not fun to say the least.  Seems like you wash the same area for 10 minutes and you have to look around you to actually tell that your making a little progress.  Finished that up around noon and then the bug guy came to our house which i got lucky enough to escort around cause my mom didnt like him (who knows)  So after that I had some lunch and then went outside to do the lawn for the last time this month because i will be gone...and i cant say that i will miss it either. The rest of the afternoon was spent playing Medal of Honor (which a did beat and was very proud of myself for it lol)  Grilled some hamburgers for dinner which were really good and then Meeta came over.  I was supposed to go to Codys house but I cant complain about Meeta coming over instead...another great night spent with her =)  Gonna miss her a lot when im gone...  So this goes out to someone that really seems to be having a tough time with life right now....im really sorry that you feel that way and that you feel like you have no other options but i just wanted to reemphasize that i am here for you if you need somone to talk to...anything, you know that.  If no one you know can help you then get someone that is a profesional to help you...do something.  Your way too good of a person to even think about that....more people care than you will ever know....heres one....all you have to do is ask....  well i am more than exhausted and it has been a long, tough day for me...this mood that im in REALLY needs to go away and i think that a little sleep will do just the trick....im out...  "...working together in our common faith, we can not fail."

      three more days till i leave for england (including today) thus the title three days....mixed emotions on the trip...i am really excited and sad to leave for such a long time all at the same time...someone has really stepped into my life that i just dont want to leave....i just dont want anything to change i guess.  Im sure it wont though...i as well as her will make it through this next month and all will be well =)  Thats the way i see it anyway.....  so today didnt start for me until 130 today because thats when i woke up.  My mom was really angry about that and i sure heard about it too...eh whatever, i will just have to get up earlier from now on.  Harry Potter was defenitly not what i expected it to be...they sure left a lot out and mixed stuff up a lot.  It was a good movie if you have never read the books but seeing that i have read them, the movie kinda destroyed my image of the third book =/  so i got my report card yesterday and my parents were actually pleased with my report card which definetly took a load off my back...it had been on my mind since school got out whether or not they would like my report card and now it is off and i can enjoy without worry the rest of my summer and not think anything about the place that i have come to call hell.    Tommorow is gonna be a fun day not....gotta mow the lawn and im gonna get over to the gym in the morning...errr then the afternoon looks relaxing and in the evening there are many choices to what i could do...so i guess what i mean is that tommorow morning does not look like a fun day...so yeah, im out....  "...and its you ill miss most of all my darling.  When the sun sets in the west Ill be thinking of you...I hope you do too."

      so i guess ill write in here again cause i know that everyone loves to listen to how my life is etc.  Plus its only another 4 days and I leave for England which is gonna be an AWESOME trip!  Im really excited about it when I think about it but honestly, its not on my mind as much as you prolly would think it would be...my mind is thinking about so much else that is going on RIGHT now in my life that i really havent had time to think about it....and i guess thats why all of the sudden it has hit me that I wont really be home and be able to do much until July 10th because right after I get back on the 28th of June, I leave for Colorodo July 3rd...so yeah....and i guess today it really hit home today that im not gonna be home for a whole month...eh, things will be alright.  I sure hope nothing changes too much while im gone...im really liking what is going on right now in my life.  My relationship with Meeta is really great and has really gotten good ever since school let out cause now I see her every day and has been such a relife to have something to look forward to every day....its been really great....  Things with my younger brother have really gotten better too...there was a time where i thought that all he did was hate me and didnt even want me a part of his life but the past week or so he has really opened up and let me back in his life and let me try to be the older brother that i am supposed to be.  And as I said in the entry before, things with Kimmy got so much better Friday night cause i actually went over and told her how i felt and we just talked things out.  Amazing what one night can do to a great friendship that i hope to god i never loose....  So tonight was Christinas b-day thing (I dont know how to spell what its called lol) and it actually was a lot of fun.  I wanted to go to the church thing that started it off but my ride (Meeta) did not but being the person that she is decided to come with me =)...that made me really happy because throughout the whole thing i sensed that she was not enjoying it but she still came and did it for me....I really commend her for that.  I dont know if I could do that for anyone (but maybe her =)  The rest of the night went really well and was a lot of fun.  The food was AWESOME and the dancing was really fun too.  After that me and Meeta came back to my place and watched a lil hockey (again, I commend her because even though she does not like hockey she sat there and watched a whole period just cause she knew I wanted to =) then Monster Inc. (a movie she had never seen!!)  So yeah the night was great!  So yeah just 4 more days and Im gone....but ive already talked about this....up there...lol  So yeah, Im extremely exhausted and I am gong to make a early night (for me) of it.....lata days.....

      so yeah its been a long while since i wrote in this thing....i put a couple pictures in this today which i am very proud of myself cause i was able to do it...with the help of this wizard thing i installed hahaha....im going by the last time i wrote in my xanga so let me update you on whats going on....  the last few days have been nothing but me sitting on my ass at home, running around with my mom, watching hockey (one game), and seeing meeta.  Thats about it....everyone else has been in fish camp and doing stuff with that so nobody can really hang out....and what a way to spend the only week that i am going to be home the whole month of june.  Actually, I cant really complain about spending time with meeta.  It seems like right now she is the only person that can put a smile on my face anytime, anywhere.  Im really enjoying being with her and am saddened by the fact that i am going to england the rest of the month....not sad about the trip, the trip will be AWESOME!  Its just not seeing her is what im not looking forward to but the way things are going right now, i think that we will make it through this just fine. =)  So tonight i actually felt like i was being useful to kimmy for the first time in like almost a month....i have been such an idiot this year when it comes to kimmy and our friendship.  Ive been blinded by my own foolishness and what i thought was the right and better thing to do when really, nothing can compare right now (besides my family and God) for what she has done for me.  She is truly like a sister to me and i dont know what i would do without her.  I am completly sorry Kimmy, and hope you can forgive me....  So this whole week has basically been a blur except with the moments spent with meeta.....nothin really to do now except sit around the rest of the night and do nothing...maybe go out in the backyard and look at the sky....that is always fun (seriously!)....im out....

      ok wow...its been an almost two weeks since ive updated and according to this im still in vernon.&nbsp; Wow, I think it is time for an update.&nbsp; Summer has gone by WAY to fast!&nbsp; Summer band is now up and going (for almost a week now) and it feels like school has already started because we are up there from 8-4!!!!! UGH!&nbsp; I feel like when I get home I need to sit down and do homework.&nbsp; Thats how much it feels like we are in school right now.&nbsp; So yeah, subject of summer band.&nbsp; Many words can describe...tiring, repetitive, some of it useless? yes uhhh what else...wow there is a lot.&nbsp; I mean it is nice to be with the horn section again and with friends but I mean the band part this week has kinda sucked.&nbsp; I cant really play my instrument because my mouth is really messed up (not just cause my lips are out of shape) and the show music is incredibly fast and the horn part is pretty damn hard.&nbsp; I mean its fun dont get me wrong, and we have a lot of the melody which is cool, but its hard.&nbsp; A lot of work will need to be done to pull this year off successful and I mean A LOT!&nbsp; Not just with the horns, everybody....I mean weve spent two fricking days learning 8 steps of forward march and we arent even up to temp!....totally new marching stuff wow, just a lot of work....gah!&nbsp;  So yeah along with band starting up hockey has also started up in full swing too...anywhere from 2-4 times a week on the ice, at the rink...plus my regular work out that I need to do to get my body back in shape from summer....i wish i had done more now to keep my body inshape because I can really feel it, like really feel it.&nbsp; So yeah thats whats up with hockey.&nbsp; Oh and fyi, let me know if you want e-mails this year about games.&nbsp; I know a lot of yall started to come out last year and apparently had fun so yeah...just let me know.  So lets see what ive done since Ive gotten home from vernon....chilled with friends all last week, cleaned my room of all my junk (and did it in one day!), thats about it...I mean nothing really else to do but hang out with friends on your LAST week of summer in the middle of JULY!! UGH!&nbsp; sorry, I just hate the fact that my summer is getting stolen away from me...but I guess I knew it was coming, just choose to ignore it.&nbsp;  This years scheldule is looking totally killer on me.&nbsp; I thought last year was bad but no, this year is by far way more busy.&nbsp; State year for band which means a couple more weekends, couple extra contests and makes things a heck of a lot more busy and hard.&nbsp; I mean it may not seem like it, but it is.&nbsp; Also hockey coach is talking about playing AAA tier two which is a higher level and means more commetment, practices, blah blah blah....and lets not forget the high school team.&nbsp; That too.&nbsp; And lets also not forget my school classses...all pre-ap except algebra two (NO PISKORZ!!!!!) But still...4 pre-AP...so yeah insane year...should be fun though.&nbsp; I know it may seem like im complaing but for the most part I am looking forward to all this stuff.&nbsp;  So yeah, this friday is the band picnic which I am also looking forward to because yeah...I just like it.&nbsp; In my opinion the best band event of the year (although florida might outdo band picnic this year lol) So yeah really looking forward to that...and thats about all thats going on the rest of this week except more 8-4 summer band!! YIPPEEE!!!!!....not lol...alright well tonight is looking good, hanging out with Meeta =) and maybe some other people...im out.

      so here in vernon it is nice...biggest store in town is Wal-Mart, full of hicks, nothing to do...yeah, its a whole bunch of nothing.&nbsp; Everything seemed so much nicer here when I was here in Spring Break doing a little soul searching.&nbsp; I guess thats cause I was here for something and I knew this was the best place to do it...and this is why.&nbsp; Its a whole bunch of nothing with no distractions.&nbsp; This is why I liked it when I was here spring break.&nbsp; No distractions which was good but now that &nbsp; I have my life somewhat together, it is like nothing to do and it bores the hell out of me.&nbsp; Both my cousins work so they arent home during the day and there is nothing else to do.&nbsp; No more internet at their house cause their mom took it away but luckily there is some at Coreys house (my oldest cousins house).&nbsp; So there, I mean I cant wait to get home for a couple reasons 1) Someone really special is at home which I feel like I can  never  get enough time with and now I will be home for good 2) It will be nice to be home longer than a week and 3) Will mark that all my trips are done for the summer.&nbsp; I know some of yall are prolly saying "Man, I would love to get out of here and just go somewhere else"&nbsp; Well I guess I'm just complaining because Ive been living that fantasy ALL SUMMER and I'm sick of living out of a suitcase.&nbsp; Thats all...and Im so tired of being away from Meeta.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, so I will be home for good either&nbsp;Sunday&nbsp;or Monday and yeah....that will be it.&nbsp; No more travling for me. So yeah I guess the only thing exciting that has happend to me up here is I got to see my cousins new house which is really really cool.&nbsp; I mean its only one bedroom but thats ok cause he is the only one living here.&nbsp; Its quite big actually for one person and the living room is really big I think.&nbsp; I really like the set up for the computer lol....its got a recliner as the seat and the keyboard can go aways so yeah...sit and type in absolute comfort. =)&nbsp; So yeah, spent the night here last night which was cool.&nbsp; Spent some good time with my cousins and yeah...no one had to work last night. =) Alright so I am going to make this a short one because Im heading back over to my aunts house to help put in a pool.&nbsp; I will be home in a few short days and will be back for good.&nbsp; Im out.... &nbsp;  i miss you....  &nbsp;

      So like I said last night, one last trip and the summer of trips is done.  Shouldn't be too bad cause its only for six days and yeah, cell coverage and FREE computer access.  Will by far be the easiest trip of the summer to get a hold of people.  I mean its just...everytime I come home I find it harder and harder to leave because me and Meeta just keep getting better and better which Im NOT complaining about...I love it.  Its just I dont FEEL like leaving.  Its a forced trip which really sucks but I can see why my parents are forcing me to go.  My grandma will not live forever.  So yeah, mixed emotions about it but like I said, will be easy to communicate back home unlike the past two trips.  Just sometimes feels like I die when Im gone..."but Im dying to live"...good quote from a song...fits perfect right now. So yeah today me and Meeta went to see Spidey 2 finally.  I already knew that it wasnt that good and peoples descriptions fit perfect.  SOAP OPRAH!  Oh well, it was alright and spending time with Meeta was more than ok with me =).  Came back home and just chilled at my house till about 530 when Meeta left and yeah.  Had Dads birthday dinner and yeah...my dad is 45 today.  I dunno what to say about that...well hes not OLD! =)  Then went up to the church where I havent been in FOREVER so it was nice to see all of them and yeah.  Went out to ice cream with my dad for his b-day which was really good.  Im gonna get so fat...too much ice cream for me. =)  Then Meeta came over for just a couple mins to pick up her CDs that I re organized for her...I know that sounds weird cause like a guy re-organizing for a girl but yeah...they were messy! lol So yeah I do have one thing to talk about because hockey season is starting up soon and this year I have something else to inspire me to just gut through whatever comes my way and take any pain that I get...so listen up... While we were in England there was this man that started out on our tour...was about 75 years old and yeah...he looked a lot older though and yeah...he was from Austin and the day before we started on tour through the UK he got hit by a car on the streets of London.  Really kicked the crap out of him cause of his age and stuff.  I mean he could barely get around.  But he still did...even after a whole week of being beat up and seeing double he still stayed with the tour and saw everything and did all the walking and stayed on that cramped up bus.  I totally admire him for his strength and courage.  I mean he was still going strong, gutting through the pain, being sociable and yeah...it was purly amazing how strong he was.  Totally inspiring to anything that I do now...I mean he was so banged up and old.  If he can do that, I really belive that I can do anything with hockey...thanks George, you are truly amazing.   So yeah, I dont know if I will post any blogs while im gone on my last trip...we will see.  Cell is on and will be on AIM periodically.  Well im out....  "...but im dying to live...."

      So im back from Colorado...YAY! 2 trips down...one to go.  A visit to OK would be nice.  See my grandma which is aging and do not have my whole life to see and see Corey's new house and yeah.  Just visit the people that I only see a couple times a year.  Just wish these damn trips didnt have to be back to back to back.  Really sucks...because since June 10th of this year I have spent a total of 8 days at home.  Date I get back from OK July 19th....HOLY SHIT!!!  I have been the real traveler this summer havent I?  I dont know...too much time with the family if you ask me.  At least it is over after this one...cant wait to be home for over a week at a time....and spend time consistently with Meeta....that would be great. So Colorado was a little eh.  When I wasnt worried and stuff I had a blast (no guilt trip)  Really got to know Albert a whole lot better and he really helped me through the week.  I mean backpacking was a blast...just had a lot on my mind, thats all.  Really none of anyones buisness (no offense) unless it has to do with you or I tell you so I wont mention what abouts I was worried about in here and who it pertains to.  But yeah didnt see a bear but wish I had.  Got some really nice pictures of the Rockies and yeah.  Frickin altitude kicked my ass though with all the hiking I did.  Oh well, and I also came back with a REALLY nice tan hahaha....I know sounds corny but I almost look Mexican, thats how dark I am.  Also saw a wild eagle 20 ft above my head...that was REALLY cool. So yeah I dunno, today was awesome.  I got my new hat.  Its a Mich State hat exactly like the old one cept a little bit darker and yeah...is actually much nicer than the old one.  It was a very belated b-day present of mine that I very much like.  Thank you so much Kait. =)  Yeah, the rest of the day was spent with Meeta. =)  Was really nice to see her again and when I say really that word is not enough.  Words can not express how much I missed her this past week and how GREAT it was to see her smilin, beautiful face.  Seein her really cleared a lot up and basically spent the entire afternoon and night with her.  Went and got ice cream, took a walk to the RR, came home and had a GREAT time at my house.  It was great, best night of the summer so far.  I cant explain how awesome I feel right now and how top-of-the-world I am feeling.  It is wonderful. =) So yeah will write tommorow and then I will prolly write will I am gone too cause I will have comp access and cell access for sure.  So yeah, Im out.  summer breeze...makes me feel fine....=)....

      so if your running short on time this is not the blog to read cause this is going to be REALLY long.... so yeah as most people know, i am leaving once again tommorow for Colorado.  Like I said in my last blog, at least it is in the states this time...but still.  I dont want to go camping and Im SO tired of living out of a suitcase/pack.  SO tired of traveling and I know a lot of you are saying "I wish I could get out of this place."  But think about it for 5 secs...Ive been gone overseas for 3 weeks...im home for 4 days, and now im gone again for another week AND THEN my mom wants to go to OK for a couple days RIGHT AFTER we get home from Colorado.  UGH, for the first time ever I think I just want to be somebody that stays home and does nothing...sick of traveling.  Thats the big thing.  So yeah since Ive been home things have been going great and thats another thing that makes me mad.  Right when I get used to being home and seeing everyone I have to go again.  Eh, whatever.  Enough complaing about that.   Parents, first time in this blog that they have been talked about extensly but I think today is so fitting to start.  So my dad finally got on a project again where he has to go every week and be gone from the house.  I say finally because things run so much smoother around the house when he is not around and there are so many less fights (like praticallly none) when he is not around between me and my parents.  My dad complicates things, thats the long and short of it...when he is around, the whole house is a lot more tense and yeah...its just that way.  He never lets loose...i mean i love him, thats a given.  I just think that he tenses the house and complicates things a lot more than they should be.  Tonight being a perfect example of this.  Last night home (again) and Meeta and I just want to spend the night together.  Well, you can tell that my dad is like all up tight about having company over.  Well me and Meeta see that and decided to leave for an hour or so and let them finish whatever they are doing or what have you.  Well that was the best hour of the night let me tell you.  We get back, dad still in the same tense mood but now mom has tensed up too because of my dad.  So mom says something and Meeta is forced to go home at 930...errrrr....I was done packing so yeah, I dont know why but w/e....there you have it...an example with my opinions. So yeah, today was pretty mellow with nothing really going on.  Went out to lunch with Greg and came back here and chilled for a while...that was pretty cool.  Other than that and the night (which i already talked about) nothing happend...chilled with Nate for the first time in a long time and yeah...thats it. Right now theres really someone that is making me get through the days with a smile on the whole day and yeah...is just being really great to me and I really dont know why.  Honestly, all ive been doing recently is being gone.  Thats it.  For a month now i will have been gone (cept for the four days that i was home this week) and yeah...it just keeps getting better and better.  I feel like I can tell her anything...it makes me feel so complete when I am around her.  Its so great having someone there that I can just talk to and I actually know that shes listing and not just blowing me off.  Not saying that I think people do (but I know some do) but yeah, its just different when I am around her and its a very good different.  I am just so happy to have her and consider myself so lucky to be with her.  She really is great =) Alright well I guess Im gonna end this one.  My next update will be in a week for sure cuase i know there is no computer access in the Rockies.  Cell phone will be on if I have signal.  Call if you need me, I dont roam anywhere in the states.  Aight, lata days.

      so yes im home and yet again in two days I will be leaving again to go backpacking in the Rockies.  Not gone so long this time...only a week.  There are a few pluses to this trip as compared to the last trip.  For one, its in the states which means quite a few things.  1) No GAY ASS customs/border patrol 2) My cell phone will work and 3) Again, not gone as long.  Not that im not looking forward to it because again I love to camp and this will be a great experience for me (maybe even see a bear!!)  Hey, it happend last year...so yeah, this trip wont be AS awesome..well, weathher wise it will be but i dunno...its gonna be fun no doubt.  I guess Im just tired of traveling and kinda just wanna stay home.    So I guess I will talk a little about England here since I havent mentioned it at all in here since I got home.  As youve prolly heard it was AWESOME and yeah, thats all I can say about it.  Totally great to see a TOTALLY different side of the world and totally different country.  I would recomend going there to see things for ANYONE but never go there to live...way too expensive.  Plus they are little weirdos and drive on the left side of the road and use currency that is worth TWICE as much as American money. lol so yeah, great trip.  Website is up if you havent already heard with a lot of my photos from the trip.  Took me 2 days to get it up so have a look.  Link is in my profile but in case you cant get it there here it is again.  http://behindbritain.blogspot.com/  Since I got home its been really great to see a lot of yall.  I know I havent seen many of you but today and tommorow I have plans to see a lot of the people I havent seen already.  Saw The Notebook yesterday with Meeta and it was SO good!  We had a very good time yesterday except for one incident which we cleared up pretty quickly so yesterday was good =).   Also played hockey yesterday for the first time in a month which KILLED me cause we skated for a hour and a half.  Was so sore...ugh, and left me broke too.  Still have yet to see Spidey Man and prolly wont get around to it till after I get back from Colorado.  Unless I see it tonight... Alright well I guess Im gonna end this.  I will prolly write later tonight if enough happens to make it a good entry.  Aight, im out.
