						   I just visited a web page today that made me want to throw up!  No I will not list the address here (Bart), as I want nothing to do with promoting this trash.  Let's just say that this is the type of jerk who gives politics a bad name.  He uses his site to trash anyone and everyone who dares call themselves a Republican.  And has even stooped to using the death of Ronald Reagan to promote and spread his trash.  Like him or hate him, Ronald Reagan is a former President of the greatest nation in this world, and has earned the respect of the nation he served.  Even though I personally think a more recent Democratic President, who I will not name out of respect for the office, was this nations biggest mistake in years, when he passes away, if I am still alive, I will show him and his family the proper respect.  The person who operates this web page is one of the biggest problems with politics today.  People like him and Rush Limbaugh who go around waving their political parties banners no matter what they do are the root of the problem actually.  I can't help but feel that as I converse with my friends, co-workers, and acquaintances that most feel similar to myself.  We belong to a political party due to our families political believes, a candidate that interested us in the past, our friends think this party is cooler, whatever.  I happen to be a registered Republican.  I do not believe as I once did about voting along party lines though.  A lot of candidates from the two major parties, and some of the almost unknown parties, have a lot of strong patriotic feelings and would make excellent office holders.  And if I had the chance I would vote my conscience, not just in the general election, but in every election. (BTW: The Electoral College Needs To Disappear!)  So how do we fix this?  Easy, it's time my friends for a new Constitutional convention!  And we have an advantage that we did not have at the last one.  If you are reading this then you are looking at part of it.  The ability to make the majority opinion known, not just send in the clowns and hope for the best. (Sorry, I did not intend any disrespect to the Founding Fathers, but let's face it when you look at the political landscape today that's what it feels like we are doing in present times every November)  We have the ability to let our representatives know item by item what the majority of the nation wants written into the new constitution.  We live in a society that is more diverse and connected than ever before.  And we should use this to the advantage of our nation.    Think about it.  What would you like to see in our new constitution?  I know I have a short (right) list to start with.  1. A Flat Income Tax!  If you earn money, no matter how, you pay the tax rate set by the government.  Work 40 hours for minimum wage, you pay X%, invest in a startup company and make a few million, you pay THE SAME X% on everything you make over the initial investment (even if you roll it over and invest it again).  Get the picture?  NO LOOPHOLES!  NO SHELTERS! EVERYONE PAYS RICH OR POOR!!!!! And as a side note wouldn't it be nice to have a tax form the size of an index card?  2. Healthcare should be a right, not a privilege! (Yes folks you heard that from a registered Republican's keyboard!)  No one should have to pay for Doctors visits, Hospital care, Drugs, or any other NECESSARY HEALTH CARE!  Elective surgery, or other things not necessary for the preservation of life and limb are out of your pocket still.  3. Social Security needs to be fixed!  No "borrowing" the surplus funds to finance your pet program.  Each and every citizen who has worked 41600 hours in their lifetime (40 hours, 52 weeks a year, for 20 years),  has earned a retirement benefit equal to a 40 hour paycheck at minimum wage (provided they have reached the minimum retirement age).  And yes I do believe that we have an obligation to take care of those who truly cannot work for some legitimate reason, but for those of you who could have worked and did not, sorry, good luck finding a private charity to help you out.  4. And while we are on the subject, a FIXED AND PERMANENT MINIMUM WAGE!  This point I know will throw some people, but let's look at this logically.  Let's say the minimum wage goes up a quarter tomorrow, you will take home a whopping $10 a week (gross pay) more.  Your company however has to raise prices to pay you that "messily" little $10 raise.  Why?  Simple, your 10 bucks, plus the few cents increase in their end of your social security, plus the increase in the unemployment compensation taxes they pay for you, plus certain other insurances and stuff at some companies, times every employee on the books!  Add to this the fact that every other company effected by this increase in the minimum wage will also have to offset their costs by raising prices (or worse, letting people go and making the remaining people work harder) and now you are paying more for goods and services, roughly equal to the amount of your increased pay.  Bottom line, NET GAIN FOR YOU BY INCREASING MINIMUM WAGE IS ZERO!!!!!  (More Latter)
