      For the past 28 months, I have been working on a new fibrous material that both absorbs perspiration and resists slippage.  This is the motivation of the visit.  It's my first conference and first presentation.  I'm a bit nervous, but am intimately familar with the topic.  After much presentation practice, I have become comfortable in front of an audience and do not use a script.  It's an honor to be able to speak about a project that I alone have undertaken and funded.  The work lead me to the College of Textiles at NCSU and is propelling me to the next stages of my career.  Due to pending intellectual property concerns, I did not bring along a sample of the fiber.  Had I, the first prize would have surely been mine.  Instead, I settled for 3rd with a modest 300Pound payout.  This covers nearly half of the cost to attend the conference -- a cost which I personally bore.

      One of the first presentations at the conference is given by Dr. David Forrest, a materials/welding engineer at Carderock Navy Labs in Washington and President of the non-profit Institute for Molecular Manufacturing (www.imm.org).  His nanoscience topic focused on the molecular manufacturing paradigm that K. Eric Drexler birthed in the 1980s.  Part of the original thinktank at MIT, Forrest presents an up-to-date survey of the forecast abilities and applications attributed to manipulation of individual atoms.  Several groups from around the country (notables at Caltech, Berkeley, USC, GTech from Physics to Computer Science) are making basic headway in novel materials, simulation/control and machine design.  I approached Dr. Forrest after his talk to borrow one of the books he cites:   'Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing, and Computation' by Drexler that outlines the hard theoretical applied science behind the forecasted mesoscopic revolution.  I had read 'Engines of Creation' and was fascinated by the possibilities.  However, I was unable to locate specific professors engaging in the preliminary research.  It turned out that I was looking in the wrong departments!  Since there were few students there -- the ones that were had mainly textile interests -- I was able to have nearly undivided attention from Dr. Forrest.  He give names of prominent professors and curriculum advice.  It was a serendipitous meeting.  He offered to write a recommendation.  We are keeping on contact.  Hopefully I will see him at the 1st Conference for Advanced Nanotechnology in Washington from October 22 to 24.  ---------  Manchester is one of the original cities of the industrial revolution.  The Science and Technology museum pays tribute to the city's role.  Complete with original steam engines, steam turbines, and other petroleum-powered engines.  Their textile displays contain a wide range of original textile machinery.  The urban history of the city including public works (sewage and utilities) is enlightening.  It gives a tangible impression of the conditions the earliest western city folk endured.  The city is picturesque with clean rivers and canals.  Windy, overcast, occassional rain -- it's typical English weather.  The Midlands folk are warm and friendly.  The conference has a dinner at the Lowery.  Wine flows, conversation tends to be centered on the older delegates.  The art of English conversation still contains the iconic air of snobbery.

      Visiting Manchester for the 2004 International EcoTextile Conference hosted by the Bolton Institute.  Staying at The Hatters, a renovated victorian Haberdashery-turned-hostel.   .  Beautiful rooms, zig-zag wooden slat floors, 20+ foot ceilings, original 'patented' glazed porcelin washroom fixtures.

      Depart RDU for Washington Reagan.  Staying with Lauren MacWilliams & Co near Tenleytown for 4th festivities.  See Spiderman in the nose-bleed section of the Uptown Theater.  View the fireworks from the top floor of the EPA building balcony that overlooks the American History Museum.  Lots of people;  the mall is cordoned off and visitors are checked at gates.  Brilliant fire works and a relaxing evening.

      Grandmother Snyder's Memorial.  Visited the dentist just before the services.  No cavities!  Brilliant, hot day.  Remaining family in town: Texas and Bluefield represented.  Strong showing of local friends.  Decided to read an excerpt from 'The Art of Being and Becoming' by Hazrat Inayat Khan.  Visit with family at home.  Local group sets up donated food.  Nice showing of community.   See below excerpt below.  Afterwards, see Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11.  Struck by the administration-for-hire attitude.  Republicans portrayed as motivated only by profit.  Had no idea Saudi owned over 7% of the US and funded a great many of the the Bush family's business ventures.  Has the US become a Saudi province?  From 'The Art of Being and Becoming': No one can deny the fact that life in the world is one continual struggle.  The one who does not know the struggle of life is either an immature soul or a soul who has risen above the life of this world.  The object of a human being in this world is to attain to the perfection of humanity, and therefore it is necessary that man should go through what we call the struggle of life.  There are two different attitudes that people adopt while going through this struggle of life.  One struggles along bravely through life; the other becomes disappointed, heartbroken, before arriving at his destination.  As soon as the person loses the courage to go through the struggle of life, the burden of the whole world falls upon his head.  But he who goes on struggling through life, he alone makes his own way.  The one whose patience is exhausted, the one who has fallen in this struggle is trodden upon by those who walk through life.  Even bravery and courage are not sufficient to go through the struggle of life:  there is something else that must be studied and understood.  The question is, where should one begin and where should one end?  Generally one starts by struggle with others, and then one struggles all through life, and never finishes.  The one who is somewhat wiser struggles with conditions, and he perhaps accomplishes things a little better.  But the one who struggles with himself first is the wisest, for once he has struggled with himself, which is the most difficult struggle, the other struggles will become easy for him.  Struggling with oneself is like singing without an accompaniement.  Struggling with others is the definition of war;  struggling with oneself is the definition of peace. In the beginning, outwardly, it might seem that it is cruel to have to struggle with oneself, especially when one is in the right.  But the one who has penetrated deeper into life will find that the struggle with oneself is the most profitable in the end.  The purpose of life is to arrive at that stage where every moment becomes fruitful.  And what does fruitful mean?  Does it mean fruits for oneself?  No, trees do not bear fruit for themselves, but for others.  True profit is not that profit which one makes for oneself, true profit is that which one makes for others.  After attaining all that one wants to attain, be it earthly or heavenly, what is the result of it all?  The result is only this, that all that one has attained, that one has acquired, whether earthly or heavenly, one can place before others.
