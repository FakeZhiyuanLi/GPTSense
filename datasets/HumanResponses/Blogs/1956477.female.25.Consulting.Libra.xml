      got my sari blouse done today .. yippie.. it fits well.. not superbly but well.. havent figured out which style im gonna drape it in. its been a day since the stupid fight. been offline. havent heard a peep. feels like ages. wish time would fly by quicker. thank god its a busy weekend of partying planned ahead.   heard from A. hes coming down next week. im not sure if i should meet up with him. will be the first time in a year and since we broke up. maybe its best to leave things the way they are. some part of me says that i should go meet him and some part isnt really affected. in some weird way.. i kinda get the feeling that seeing him isnt gonna affect me as bad as i think it will. ive come to realise that i need to be picky. and ive realised that we both are on very different wave lengths. itwould never have worked out. i care for him. but i try not to show it. even now.. i know hes not really over me yet so it would be an endless circle if we just kept showing our feelings for each other.   and having met other guys .. has made me realise that there out people out there with more similar characteristics than me and A. i guesstodays a good day .. since im jotting all this down without shedding a tear.   on the other hand, i wonder how upset the other one is. i know i brought this on to myself. being argumentative for no apparent reason. being difficult beyong belief. wonder how long the cooling off period is suppose to last. it some weird way its made me realise all men suxs.. BIG TIME. and maybe its just better of being single and silly and never having to anwer to to accommodate anyone elses needs..   *sigh* still debating that one out ...   Day 1 ... Day 1 .. Day 1... hurry up TIME .. and fly by .... !!! aaaarrghhhhh

      no words or sentences to describe what im feeling.. only tears... maybe something its better this way.. the only way to heal it to feel the pain .. and pray to have the strenght to move on. wonder if these wounds will ever heal. have no faith in love or any of that mumbo jumbo crap. i get my heart broken once and if thats not good enough .. it hurts even worse the second time around.. he was nice.. he was different.. dont know how things changed.. maybe i was on the rebound. will i ever find someone to call my own .. honestly .. I DONT KNOW.. i have loved and i have been hurt in return. and i have tried to find love again but whats the point. i can only take so much ... i cant deal with this anymore.. i just cant ... when will the pain go away and when will i stop feeling lonely, when will i rem then theres no one next to me in bed and stop turning over to look for his warm body ..   life suxs.. love suxs even more...

      oh man ..what a night ... think it was the most amazing and embarrasing night ever. tsb rocked.. but one too many shots.. really did its trick. god.. i dont think ive ever puked that much in my entire life.. the embarrasing bit is the fact that it happened all over the place.. a total audience.. eeeeeeee.... and the best part if i can rem all the puking .. but nothing else... double eeeeeee  after a couple of calls.... it seems i was quite the hoochie mama last night.. i cant even rem who i danced with of the fact that i did the sandwich. oh man .. this is the second time JD has wrecked havoc on my system.. first was new years eve but i have to say .. this was the worse..   god just got a shiver thinknig of the embarrasing puke sessions that took place last night... yuck yuck yuck... dont think im gonna be going to tsb anytime soon ... and worse it had tohappen at my fav  place..   hopefully a good nights rest is gonna cure this hangover (its shrinked from being the size of cali to probabaly michigan right now) and permanently erase some memories of last night.. the puke ones at least .. oh anddddddddddddddd the worst of it alll .. is the fact that it had to happen just when some prospects were in view.. god.. how ironic.. the guys name is avin too hahaha... life deff playing a cruel joke on me ..   anyways ... a last cheers to JD and avin and anand or whatever their names were and of course .. rowena... where were u hiding for 10 years man .. and of coursee... VIMI and FIR .. thanks for being puke-cleaners hehe

      He mailed me today.. ive been trying to keep away .. have not asnwered any of his emails or his sms's or his calls and suddenly i find this waiting for me in my inbox..  FR  OM HIM     'Why' Why is it that I hurt when I hear about you? ME : I DONT HAVE AN ANSWER TO THAT BUT I DO KNOW I HURT THE SAME ...  Why is it that two hearts that yearn for each other, be the same hearts that are destructive to another? ME: I HAVENT HURT YOU ON PURPOSE  Why is it that the one thing I need in life be destined to be unattainable? ME: YOU DIDNT WANT ME .. WHEN I WAS ALL YOURS... FOR 6 FREAKING YEARS !! Why is it that when I look at your picture, I still feel that you are mine ? ME: BOUT TIME U CHANGED THE PICTURE THEN  Why is it that we cannot have the fairy tale happy ending followed by a 'the end' sign? ME: DO I HAVE TO SAY THIS AGAIN .. U DIDNT WANT ME... UNLESS U MEAN HAVING A FAIRY TALE HAPPY ENDING INVOLVES A SEA OF SEPARATION BETWEEN US Why is it that I cannot get you off my mind? ME: YOU WILL SOON AND I KNOW I WILL TOO ..  Why is it that the love of my life is the one thing i cant call mine? ME: U USED TO BE ABLE TO CALL ME URES.. ONLY URES.. BUT MAYBE U TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THAT AND THATS THE PRICE U PAY ... FOR ASSUMING SOMETING WILL STAY URES FOREVER .. I KNOW IM STILL LEARNING THAT LESSON Why is it that I feel so alone without the person that has hurt me the most? ME: ITS ABT BEING SO USED TO SOMEONE EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE BAD FOR YOU Why is it that I need you so much? ME: I HAVE NO IDEA.... I TOT U DIDNT NEED ME ANYMORE..  Why is it that you are my happiness? ME: REALLY ... HOW SOO ... WHY WASNT I URE HAPPINESS 6 MONTHS AGO  Why is it that I cannot picture a future without you? ME: YOU CANT ?? REALLY ... THEN WHY WAS IT THAT YOU COULDNT PICTURE A FUTURE WITH ME EITHER ! Why is it that I feel I will never get your kind of love elsewhere? ME: NEITHER OF US WILL GET THE KIND OF LOVE WE HAD FOR EACH OTHER WITH SOMEONE ELSE..  Why is it that I know I am willing to do everything possible in life to make you happy? ME: COME ON .. U KNOW THATS NOT TRUE... I ASKED YOU TO COME VISIT AND U COULDNT EVEN DO THAT  Why is it that we cannot agree to be with each other at the same time? ME: THAT IS ONE THING I HAVENT TOT ABT ... MAYBE THERE IS A REASON FOR THAT , THAT WE HAVE YET TO UNCOVER    you are making this very difficult for me.. but ironically .. it was you that wanted it this way .. when will this hurt stop... my resolve is thinning..

DMS is still not up yet. Thought Id be able to finish testing it but didnt manage to. Z really got all fired up today with our boss.. Well what she says is true.. the shorter the person .. the bigger the ego.. you wonder if all the people in this category suffer from the same Napolean syndrome or somethin.   These last nights on chat havent been good either.. Think im gona hit the sack in a second.. OHHH one good news today .. My measurements came back extremely good.. Yippieee ! .. of course im still not in the body fat % category i wanna be in but neverthelesss i lost inches all over and dropped 3 kgs. Just informed J that ill be sigining up for more Personal Training classes.

      Dammit I was half way through this entry and I.E had to crash on me. These company laptops are soo unstable. Will use my own freaking one next time.   Anyways as I was saying .. it amazes me how much a human heart can endure. ( yah including its abilty to deal with the unpredictability of I.E ) You think six years would make u a good judge of a person's character but NOPE.. aint no thruth to that. Six years and they can still suprise you. Well like the old adage goes... "Everything always happens for a reason" .. Whatever happened today happened so that my eyes would open up to the mind games and the unsuspecting way I get conned into them. If it wasnt for sweets .. i would have gone on and moved on thinking that I instigated the change and thus I have to feel this way .. feel the pain and anguish of a separation.   I put myself to 3 days of mental torture. I pity my frends for what I put them thru. Deliberating and doubting my desicion in every which was i could see possible. But at the end of the day when I decided what i wanted.. im told that it isnt so.. Its  EASIER  to move on .. Man some people need to wake up and smell the roses. Nothing in life is easy.. Especially if its something worth having or waiting for.  And to craft things out just so someone else carries the blame for not wanting this to work.. thats low and despicable and I feel like a fool to have been played in such a way. The whole world might can think i left but u know what .. YOU and I both know who didnt want it anymore..    I want a guy ..that thinks i'm beautiful and thinks i'm the best thing out there..I don't want to settle for a guy that thinks i'm half great .or i'm worth a try..I want a guy that say when he looks at me ..I'm keeping her    And you my dearest .. will never have the opportunity to that .. you know .. girls are like stars.. theres so many of us around.. but only ONE can make ure dreams come true.. who ever ure with .. u admitted ureself .. u will only be settling for this person .. to bad A ... uve missed the boat not once but twice.. and 3 does not happen to be my lucky number..

      I finally realize how painful love can be. How things said in the past, actions taken in the past, can all be forgetten in a matter of weeks or months. Today I realize that what I had was an illusion of things the way I would have liked them to be. Life is not prefect but you cant help but wish for all the perfect things to happen at the right times.   Sometimes I am amazed at how much hurt and pain a human heart can endure. It will take me time , to be totally over him. In time I hope we can be friends. But today, right now, I cannot spend a minute thinking of him without breaking down in tears. To have someone tell you , once upon a time, that you were their only love, that you were the only person they could see lying next to them in the morning, that you were gonna be the mother of their children,that you were gonna grow old together and sit next to each other on some bench in a park all wrinkled and toothless,  and now to have to hear that he has found someone so quick to replace me hurts beyond words.   Ive loved him before I even knoew it was love and Ive been there for him through everything. We've gone through so much and we survived so much. And now its all gone. AFter giving your all to someone for 6 years and then being told that they arent sure if u are the one , can make any sane person go crazy. All i ever wanted was his love. I never was a demanding girl friend. I never asked for things or acted in any way that would have made him doubt my love this much. COuld it have been fear of commitment ? I will never know..   This new women in his life.. the things he says abt her.. just kills me.. TO say that she is almost like me and that he doesnt want to risk losing her to give me time to think .. all that.. makes me wonder if the love he proclaimed for me was ever real. It is so scary to be lonely that it is so unberable? i dont agree .. im here.. alone... and im surviving and im not looking for the nearest hunk to replace any available spots in my life.. why would i want to do that.. he took everything i had.. i have nothing left to give anyone anymore..   He says he will never let her go ... why didnt he think like that when we were together? he says he hopes she teaches him how to love ? why does he think that when all i ever did was love him with every inch of my soul...  ive alaways belived that to love means to never give up ... but today i do not carry the same beliefs anymore.. today everything has changed.. today i will not look back and cry anymore.. Enough already .. im moving on with no regrets.. because it was never meant to be... he would never had made me happy.. and vice versa. today i wish i could also say that i hope he finds what hes looking for but all i have for him today is resentment and hate.. but i know .. one day.. i will be in that place and i will wish those things for him.. but today .. my hurt overshadows all that..   You were my first love ... and to date.. my only love.. i will love no other like i loved u .. our love was young and immature, reckless and exciting... but i wish it had grown like we did.. and sustained us both.. but it didnt and what is left are silent unspeakable memories to be shared with no one.. not even you .. as i cant have u in my life anymore .. cause u have her ... and i cant bare to see ure love for her unfold the way it should have for me .. we loved with a love that was more than us.. but somewhere along the way .. life consumed us and destroyed our love ... we were both fooled by the fact that real love stories never have endings.. but maybe this wasnt real love.. but avin ... wherever u are .. i hope u know that it felt real to me..  Today i am moving on .. and i will never shed one more tear for you. i cried you an ocean of tears and its time i get my life back on track. You have wronged me in more ways that one , and i have done the same , we are both paying for our mistakes, but who can blame us. a love that young is bound to face hurdles. Ive closed the doors leading to my heart thinking u were doing the same. But you havent and now its time for me to open mine .. to allow someone a chance to show me that love doesnt have to be painful. In some weird way, whatever happened today ... happened for the best... it has pushed us to close the doors leading to each other and to open doors to others..   I am worth so much more than you have shown me and I will be so much more than I have ever dreamed possible. I deserve so much more and it is TIME ...    "The magic of first love is our ignorance that it can never end"     "Some people come into our lives and quickly go. Some people move our souls to dance. They awaken us to new understanding with the passing whisper of their wisdom. Some people make the sky more beautiful to gaze upon. They stay in our lives for awhile, leave footprints on our hearts, and  we are never ever the same."

      Its been awhile since the last entry. Lifes been a roller coaster but hey whats new rite. These emotional dramas never end. Works getting to be such a bore. Am dreading going into work cause none of the tasks are challenging enough. And having a puny boss just adds on to the misery.   A came for a visit. I knew i shouldnt have gone to see him. I had moved on or so i tot. I was on the right path. Oh healing. And then he had to come and play the victim's role and now im 3 steps back from where i was before. And all this re-thinking has made me more confused and more annoyed with everything around me. I dont need this extra mental tension.   Sigh.. nothin this year has been peaceful. I wish i could turn back time to when things were sooo much more peaceful and it was a joy to wake up in the mornings. V's coming into town next week. Hes been getting the brunt of it all. And hes been hanging in there. Standing in the side lines till i sort my stuff up. And i have realized how ive been consiously trying to sabotage things with him. Just so that I wouldnt have to considre him in the whole equation of things. But thats not been working.   Theres so many questions with V. Is he for real? Are his feelings for real ? Will he be able to love me the way A use to .. Or is that even a rite comparison to make ? Why would i want the kind of love A had for me when until today, i have yet to convince myself togive him another chance.. No i want love.. not any kinda type of love.. just pure honest love. Compassion. Caring. Tenderness. Is thattoo much to ask ? And why is it so hard to come by...   As days go by ... i canthelp but get this weird feeling that im gonna end up being an old maid while A goes on to marry someone more his type. This shouldnt be important but for some sick reason its affecting me more than it should.. Todays not been a good day cause A's been on my mind all day long. Driving to work and i have tears streaming down my face listening to some love sick song ..   How am i gonna go through life without you ? (today i dont think i can .. its just too difficult. all i want is to feel ure arms around me and to tell me everything is gonna be alright baby ... and im gonna take care of you for the rest of my life )  And how am i gonna go through life knowing I wanted it this way ? When will the pain go away ? When will the tears stop falling .....
