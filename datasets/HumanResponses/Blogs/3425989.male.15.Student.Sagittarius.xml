      Mood: GAH!  Music: Kill Bill THeme Song  grrrr damn you best buy coupons! before I start, sorry for not posting in a few days. anyway, Best Buy has a special on Xbox's so I was hyped and was heading out to get one but LO AND BEHOLD it doesn't start until tommororow. SOOOOOOOO I am going to get up at 6 and head over there. Otherwise, school is out (yay!) and I did the usual last day things, went around telling people they were jerks and I never has a shred of caring for them. Left one of my teachers a nice little note under her door (haha, a "nice" note.  ) otherwise today was normal. That's it I guess.  inf1d31, The non-believer (btw, there has been some confusion about my name, it is suppose be the 1337 version infidel for you non 1337ers)

      Mood: Happy!  Music: Hey Mama by The Black Eyed Peas   w00t! I had a LAN party today over at my house, it was sweet. it was just 4 of us but it was still fun as hell. I also found a little gem of a website, www.beta-7.com Sega, I must give it to you, that is one creative way to advertise your game. I also discovered a little urban legend, a arcade game called Polybius. It was supposedly realeased in 1980 to two backwater Arcades in Portland, Oregon and was some kind of government mindcontrol expirement. Apparently people who played it started having terrible nightmares, amnesia, and had a uncontrollable urge to play it again even though they can't remember playing it in the first place. Well, that was a hoax. But recently someone has circulated a little .exe version of the game. He even made a huge story to go along with the game. well, I having first hand knoledge as I played the crappy .exe can tell you: it sucks. the graphics are horrible, actually, it's more like this: What Graphincs? YOu play a little triangle that is supposed to be a ship and shoot gigantix Microsoft Paint made blobs that looks like a three-year-olds drawing. you shoot smaller blobs at the big ones, and they freeze. THe only thing I noticed was they did a HORRIBLE job concealing their subliminal messages, yes that's right. You can plainly see the frames skip around, a first indicator, also, after about thirty minutes of playing your eyes start to hurt terribly, another indicator. Anyway, the game just gives you a little bit of a scary feeling and makes you want to play it again. Overall it's quite stupid. If you would like to play it, I shall give you the URL to download the .exe But thats only if you have a strong mind againest subliminal messages, may I also note the sounds have quite a few messages themselves, the music is overly bass-ed and loud, a nice way to cover up a whisper of a whisper. I myself am not of the strong minded and even though I knew the source of the feeling I got I still couldn't fall asleep until around 1:00 AM. Today at the LAN party we tried to take it apart and find out what the messafes say, no luck, but they're there, trust me. Anyway just email me or AIM me n I'll give you the URL. But remember, Curiosity killed the cat.   inf1d31, The non-believer

      yeeeeeeah a Blog! as some of you (few of you) there is a similary named blog under Icherus, thats becuase that me. Go figure. anyway, this is my new blog for a new me. I have chosen this new name becuase I have decided to open my religion to the world, infidel means in laymen terms a non-believer in god. At least that will be what I use it for. If thats not good enough, guess what, www.dictionary.com Anyway, I live in San Antonio, and my name shall remain ind1d31 (1337 5k1ll5!) for my privacy's sake. And that's all for now, I believe this is ample info to get started.
