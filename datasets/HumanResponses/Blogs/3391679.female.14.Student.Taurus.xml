      SO there we were 6 or so 14 year old girls in the pool showers. We took the soap out of the containers to with hold HUGE bottles of soap. We ran around pouring the soap on top of each other. It was like a guys fantasy. To top it all off we were turning each others hot water off so all we had was cold. can u say we were "nipply" as this guy said at the pool.It was total fun though. I have way too much fun with my friends doing pointless shit. Can u blame me though????    This summer is going to be the best yet. I kind've want to get a job but my mom says im too  young. I am going to practice my sprints like atleast 3 times a week  {I hope } and im going to set a personal most times at 6 flags record. {which i got to ay is only like 3 times but im gonna do it more this year. We always get season passes. ne ways thats all for a sec i might write more later.     Check out my guest book above ...thanks Tanya------till later i love me.....and you lol amanda michelle cunningham.....

      Today i went to a pool party for one of my best friends. It was so fun everybody {well mostly everybody} was there. I looked so bad in my suit but after a while i got over it. The food was satisfactory. Let me just complain one bit.........I am home alone a lot lately......but i like to be home alone.......i have this strange thing happening where i have been listening to country music A LOT lately like when i was 10. I think it is because I miss the south and the country way of life. That left me wen i moved to colorado. I miss Louisiana soooo much it is like in my bloood. Something i need to live. I can almost promis you i will live in the south when i am older and buying my own house..... unless something doesn't go according to plan...... ne ways.......love michelle

NO ITS NOT. nobody llives ina box {with the exception of hobos} and my little "bubble" is bumping into other ppls bubbles. this chick i talk to online that i met in a room where chatting happens is a little whiner and i am getting tired of it. She lives far away from me but like come on shut up. I want to tell her that it get annoying wen she tries to make me feel guiltty. I hate it so much but she is like a good friend {one of the best} and i dont know how to tell her with out her making me feel guilty i hat it i hate it i hate it.      Ne wayz i am totally getting into this blog thing and i am looking forward to trying to get some comments on my shitty life. How messed up in the head i am.     my biggest issue is that i am 14 an i have NEVER had a boyfriend and i dont know y i mean i am not wierd or a sped or ne thing and im not rude {i think} and im not a lesbian. I am not completly ugly and im not extremly fat but ill let you know i am not hot and i am not thin at all and i never have been. I even have friends {had friends old friends not the ones i have know} theat r ruder uglier and fatter than i and they have had millions of bfs.    Enough of that lets move on to "happier places" the world is a beautiful plase. I am an athiest and i do not want to affend ne of you but i think of it a santa clause. I have too much time on my hads in the summer. I am going to go to my school this summer and run sprints and i am going to become  hot.       Whta do you call it wen a smurf relieves itself on ur lawn........................................................................................................................blue grass.         Whoose line is it ne way at its best. I looooove mad Tv stuart ROCKS.           Girls spend too much time thinking about guys........or maybe i just spend to much time thinking about guys.           I love dejavoo do you i mena it is just like a mini premaniscian

He is in a wheel chair for the next like 6 to 8 weeks and he is hot. well he is ok but i like him. the only bad thing is he is nice to me like all the time just not when he is in one teachers classroom. my two friends like his friend and his name is steven. His two front teeth are totally jacked. Royce makes fun of him like all the time. I guess what im trying to say is guys can be mean and my life is totally messed.     today is the last day of school and  $42 of mine were stolen today. I am not going to the same highschool as my frieends and i just want to go to the movies.    I need a brak likea two week break to do nothing. After that i just want to go bak to school i have issues with summer. I need to be able to doo someething or my life goes to the dumeps but the something has to be something i am required to do. I need responsidility. Some of the responsibility has to be something i can not do and get away with. Im sauprised you read all the way down to hear. Nobody reads my blog ever.     Guys are confusilg. Signed.....The one who only knows what she wants to {and today thats not much}

My cousin was here for 3 weeks and i was ready to kill her........ {I am too upset about the harry potter movie adn all they left out} My summer sucks. my sister attacked me the other day u have no idea. I decided to go to a different highschool than her because starting sophmore year im going to take an "academy" that is going to teach me medical things {real kewl} so i habve to get up earlier and she {for some reason} keeps trying to convince me to go to her highschool. y this is idn because we agree we r togeth too much {i mean we share a room} i just need a vacation and  i want to go to see the day after tomorrow i mean the graphics need to b seen in thearters and i cant go w/ out my mom and i cleaned the entire house yesterday wen my mom was at work and gabby sat {ask hr she will admit it} and what does my mom say ...... "wheres the food .....where is dinner" llike can u give me 5 seconds of rest between washing dishes and food... then i cook spegetti and what do they say? huh huh huh "its too spicy wen r u cleaning the dishes u used " I want to scream ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

      So know you know {dont laugh} {what am i saying if u want laugh}... me way i am a harry potter "fan" {i guess is the word" I think daniel Radcliffe is hot and {sorry to say} in the prisoner of azkaban movie so id draco {only a tad}. I went to see the movie on friday and we got there id say 1/2 and hour earlier and i told my mom "there are goin to be NO seats left" she said "yah ther will be" so we get in and exzactly how many seats r not sat in 1 {and it was saved} so we go to the next showing and get ther and hour and a half just to sit in a line that was going inot the thearter. Well i was fairly dissapointed with the movie. I mean it was GREEEEEEAT! but it didnt follow the book too well. The way harry got the broom was a little different in the book they take it away and test it and all this shit and I dont think there was ennough emphasis on how "horrible" sirus was said to be i mean they didnt even show him "attack" Ron in the bed when neville left the list of passwords around. I guess to say as a fan {though not as bad as the kids dressed up w/ gryffindor scarves and such {i soooooo wanted to join them} and as a fan i was pissed with the movie. I guess if u get into the books u will NEVER be completly satisfied with the movie.  Ill let you know i was sooooo glad there was "romantic" tension between ron and hermonie... .......I am pissed to hear they may change the actors who play the kids........{they say they r getting too old as if } i will not go if they change the actors it wont be the same

      So I have this role model. A cousin and he is 18. I like to think we were always close. Atleast closer then my other cousins. The other cousins do the Im-getting-my-5minutes-of-cousin-time-in-then-im-out-of-here. Chris was always different. You know calling just to catch up and go out or taking me with him to work. which let me tell you was on stage and i would never let ppl know but i want to be on stage acting. why dont i tell u ask. B cuz i dont want it to seem like im following him aroun being exzactly like him even though inside i think we r kindve alike. ne ways he moved out of my aunts house and last night he had graduation for his ged. Thats wen i realized he was gone. No more want to go for a ride. usually just to pick someone up or u wanna go up the mountain. U know so i guess what im saying is the one i look up to is gone and i will miss him forever.

      Yesterday i went with my cousin on a "hike" at {i think this is the name of the place} coldmountain......or chestmountatin.....ne ways it is something. On the way up the mountain {by car} there are thesse two tunnels. Past the tunnels is a 3rd tunnel. Sometime in the 1800s a bus load of kids were going to the school house at the top of the mountain and the third tunnel collapsed on them. they all died. if you go in the first two tunnels in your car and turn off the lights it is creepy, b cuz it is said that the kids try to get ppl out to save them from the tunnels. One time i was with my cousin and he turned off the car entierly and we started to roll. I know what u r thinking yah it happens, but what you don't know {until know} is that we were being pushed UP hill. OK ok another thing ppl do is put baby powder on their cars and turn off the cars and when they get out of the tunnels they have handprints on their cars. Freaky huh?

      A girl asked a guy if he thought she was pretty, he said...no. She asked him if he would want to be with her forever....and he said no. She then asked him if she were to leave would he cry? and once again he replied with a no. She had heard enough . As she walked away, tears streaming down her face the boy grabbed her arm and said....You're not pretty you're beautiful. i dont want to be with you forever. i NEED to be with you forever, and i wouldnt cry if you walked away...i'd die.     This is the latest in chain letters i have gotten. My take on them is some are ok {this one isnt to bad it wasn't 5 minutes of wwork to get trough} But most are shitty. have any of you ppls out there gotten this one??

       Hsve you ever noticed how you can think of the best things wen u r bord? I do i guess. I can take something perfectly normal and make it into a wierd story in no time. My mind is constantly going. I think i should write short stories and put them into a book. The things people all think but nobody has the guts to say.&nbsp; ....... just a thought .....-------amanda

       I am sauprised i havent killed myself from the hate from my sister. Every day it is the same thing. I watch dawsons creek. I like the show and even if i have seen every episode i think 2 a day when nobody else is awake is fine. Now the catch if my sister wakes up in the MIDDLE of an episode. be it the first or the second we havwe to change the channel to what she wants to watch. I put up with it, but today she woke up right at the end of not even 2 minutes left and when it was over i put it on mtv. {what she watches alllllllll day} and the making of the movie "the bourne supremacy" was up next. Now i REALLY wnated to watch it and she said "NO". OS of course she comes and takes the remote. Her excuse...... i made her sit through Dawsons creek.. OH MY GOD it was two minutes. How does she watch tv .....? As soon as a comercial hits she changes the channel. Let me tell you she doesnt always need a comercial. If she doesnt know what the show is or if it just get boring and she watched it too long the channel is changed. How may you tell me is 5 seconds too long? NO i admit if i have seen a show and a new episode of something is on i chane between the two shows. TWO. my sister will watch atleast 15 at one time never knowing what is happenig. I gave her a choince. let me watch the making and she can pick the show alllll day. SHe said "NO" i guess it is probly because she gets the tv all day every&nbsp; day ne ways. I know what you are thinking. Go outside, but i have to call my mom and get permission adn its not like i have ne one to hang with. All my friends get to go on vacation. I never do. --------i have complained enough..........love amanda

       So today my mom comes to me and says do you want to go to pinecreek? and im like yes whats the catch? you have to move in with your aunt. You see my mom and my aunt have this whole business planned to move to tennesse and start a business. well to do that we have to sell are house. My mom said it going to happen eventully, this year. She knows i want more of a challenge and Pine creek is a more challenging school. i am not at all hooked to sand creek, but i dont want to live in my aunts house. It really depends on&nbsp; which room i stay in though. If i am in the basement i will be in a place that smells really bad. has dog vomit every where and is basically a total dump. They have an extra room nobody is in and if i get that room i am all for it. I just want to know where i am going to be. I will havve my own room for the first time in my life and that would be sooo cool. I of course would not be able to have internet access unless i come HOME. The other thing is that my sister wont come. She will stay at home with my mom. You see she is in cheerleading and doesnt want to give that up. whatever. I just want us to all go together. I want to start the process. I want i want i want. Jeez. i guess i should go for reasons. Hey if i go i probly could have friends over more often. Or go to friends more often. I dont know. I wnat to go to that school soooooo bad and i guess i should give it a try. Its not like any of my friends are really aROUND TO BE FRIENDS. they all really suck ass. Good luck with the decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ----------amanda

       I went and saw a ciinderella story last night wit my mom and sister. My mom was just going to drop us off bexause she couldnt afford it so i paid for her. I actully wanted to spent that money on school cloths or at hot topic but i didnt want my mom to not be able to go just because of money so i took her. The movie was "cute" {hate that word} and chad michael murray was in it so that was a plus. The movie wasnt what&nbsp;i expected but it was worth buying on video so i might do that. I wasnt as funny as i thought it would be but still real good. I just dont like that you cant just look at her {even in the cheesy mask} adnd not tell it is her. The look at people who rnt even blond to see if it is his "cinderella" i mean come on.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DO you ever feel like you are living a double life? I do. I have my life that isnt all em. THen i have my life online where i dont lie to people. I am just me the way i want ot be. {Ihope} The me i think i am. SOmetimes I try to please my friends , family, and the other people around me way tooo much. I wish i could just be me. My thought is that i cant be me now because i am a kid and my mom has a hold on me. What i can do and whon i can hang out with. I have ceratin friends just to make other people happy or get what i want. Like i have a friend but i start hanging out witnh her more when she becomes friends with the guy i like. Usually hough i end up getting my friend andd the guy together. Then realize i dont like them at all. Which life do&nbsp;I like better?&nbsp; Well this one. The one where i tell myself how it is and i get everything out in the open wiht my self. I like to think someone else is reading it and likeing me for me but they&nbsp; r not. I need to get over it and tell the truth....&nbsp; i write this stuff for myself. {and the occasional passer by} i write this stuff so i dont kill myself. SO i can get it all out and in the open. Not held up inside until it eats me alive. The way i see it is that when i go into college my two selves will come toghether and i will not only be myself, but i will be happy. My tru self.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dont let the fear of striking out keep you from playing the game............me myself and i &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       So .... i have this whole stress to my life right now and i think i need therapy.. who knows. ne ways my summer sis so boring that all i want to do now is go to school. and strangly enough that isnt wierd for my summers. I always want to go back after two weeks. Mom says we might take a vacation during fall break i figure she feels guilty because my sis and i always complain that all r friends are on vacation and we NEVER take any. The past summers we have gone on road trips with my aunt to visit my Gram who doesnt like me or my sister because are father is black. How rude. My mom hasnt had a real vacation the whole time i have known her. She wants to&nbsp;go on a cruise so i think i want to try and find a way to get her one SOMEDAY. maybe when i graduate because my sister and i will&nbsp; both be gone and she can CELEBRATE raising us as two girls who have succeded in life. lol im wierd. I really want to go see my cousin. He lives 20 minutes away and he was teaching me to skatebord last time i&nbsp;saw him. He says im reallly good for&nbsp;a first timer. I got a "battle scar" as he says. I was going down this hill and i rolled and scratched up my arm, but i didnt go home or cry like a baby or anything. I got back up and&nbsp;he was tyring to get me to do a trick he cant even do yet. Is he crazy. I almost got it htough. yay. well. note to self...{DONT SMOKE----- even if everyone r redy has , sister, cousins, mom tried it once, friends, dont give into temptation,}&nbsp;&nbsp; by y'all amanda michelle C.

      The future i have invisioned for myself is the strangest i know. All my friends laugh at me or it. {you probly will too}.I want to save enough money to buy land and have my drEAM HOUSE BEING BUILT. THE HOUSE WILL BE A SQUARE THAT IS A BIG HALL WAY GOING IN THE SQUARE SHAPE WITH ROOMS OFF THE HALL AND THE CENTER OF THE HOUSE WILL BE OUTSIDE. I want to be married and have two kids by the time i am 25. I WANT TO GO TO COLLEGE AND HAVE 5 KIDS IN ALL AND ADOPT FIVE THAT R OVER 10 BECAUSE EVERYBODY ALWAYS GETS BABIES AND I WANT TO BE A PEDIATRICIAN R FORENSIC SCIENCE MAJOR. wRITE A NOVEL PAINT AND INTERIOR DECORATE MY HOSUSE IN MY SPAre time. oh but nobody thinks i can even come half way to my dream. Believe me i dont think the college part will be hard it is the finding a husbend who i love and money to do everything i want to do. my family has made me regret even thinking i could follow my dreams......maybe i should give up. This is all making me even more determined.

      SO not much to say I went to nicoles house sfor a last summer get together b4 school starts up again and everyone brought food I brought doughnuts and nicoles dad is like a total ass. I mean he apparently was mad because he told us to be back at nine o clock so we r heading back at 8:30 and well nicole says " you dont know my dad when he says 9:oo what he means is 8:50 we were back 3 minutes early and he was mad i mean get over it. Ne ways we watched the perfect score and 13 ghost and i fell asleep during 13 ghost. Apparently it was scary but the parts they were freaking out about {wen i was awake} were totally weak. Maybe i have to see th entir thing but i mean the ones who r redy saw it wouldnt let us turn off the lights.   whatever ............by.......amanda.......me myself and i .....................til next time...........
