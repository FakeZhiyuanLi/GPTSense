      So I went to visit my ex-roommate from Paris, dear  urlLink Lauren , and I should have known that something would go wrong (not wrong I suppose, just definitely not according to plan).  First you must understand that Lauren and I have some kind of weird, karma induced ability to turn even the most simple of events into an 'adventure.'  Like the time it took us something like 4 days to get a key made for our apartment and numerous trips to the surly key man.  Or the time we had to go get a package for me from the UPS place in Le Bourget (the French/Armenian ghetto)and it took something like 3 hours of wandering around said ghetto in the dark (in heels as well!) and then had to pay a hundred dollars worth of taxes to retrieve the stupid box, then wander all that way back with this giant, unwieldy cardboard box.  So those are just examples.  There are really too many instances to relate.  And now you wonder why in the world we were surprised when things took a turn for the worse on my visit to upstate NY. It started out innocuously enough; we were going to go to NYC to see the Dangerous Liaisons exhibit at the Met.  Well, when we get to the train station I look up and see two women with Puerto Rican flags.  After seeing the Seinfeld about Puerto Rican day in NYC I have a healthy fear of it and turned to Lauren, wide-eyed.  "It's not Puerto Rican day, is it?" I asked.  "No," she replied.  "Our lives aren't that funny."  Hahaha.  We get down there and the entire city is blocked off.  For the Puerto Rican day parade, of course ("They're a festive people!").  Thankfully, Lauren's friend June was with us and she'd lived in the city last summer.  She guided us down and around to a place we could finally cross the street after 2 hours and then the nice policeman let us cross the street between a float and a marching band, which then put us smack in the middle of all the people milling outside the Met and all the parade watchers.  Yikes. Anyway, we saw the exhibit (it was amazing)and Lauren came up with a new saying.  You know the 'it's like a kid in a candy store' one?  Well, it has now officially become 'it's like Robin a  museum!'  We ended our international kind of day with a Korean meal (we'd had Japanese for lunch, where I had my first curry donut.  See Lauren's blog entry about it and look for the pictures) and wearily took the train home. The next day wasn't too interesting, but I got to go to H&M which we don't have here in the south.  Why I'll never know.  Tuesday however, was another day of adventure.  Lauren and I somehow decided that we wanted to go canoeing.  So we went.  We drove to Vermont (which is gorgeous; I'd never been there) and rented the canoe.  Now while Lauren and I don't look like your typical canoers (she was wearing a skirt and I had one a cute little t-shirt and a pair of jeans) we are actually quite good at it.  I used to canoe down the Suwannee river and she went to canoe camp, so one would think we'd know what we were doing.  Apparently not.  We were doing great up until there was this tree down over the river that blocked us from going anywhere at all.  I got out (standing in silt up to my knees) and we had to send the canoe under this little tiny space and Lauren, who had been steering, ended up in the front.  Bad idea Lengli and Wobin.  Lauren apparently can't NOT steer and as we came to this really wide turn, she was steering, I was steering and the wind was blowing and blew us right over.  Right into the 60 degree water.  Which was the only place in the river where we couldn't touch bottom.  So we had to swim the canoe over to the bank (in jeans no less!), dump it out, make sure we salvaged all the shoes keys and such and then continue down the river, soaking wet, giggling the whole time about how stupid we were.  The ride back to Albany was interesting, as I decided I was not going to sit for 2 hours in the car in soaking wet jeans I took them off and rode back home pantless.  It was a freeing experience, slightly akin to driving without my shirt last week. We got home, bathed, changed for dinner and then had a most amusing meal at an Italian restaurant in downtown Albany in honor of Lauren's birthday.  Then I went to bed because I had to be up at 4am to catch a 6:15 flight.  Never again (the flight not the trip to see Lauren).

      So Jenny and I went to the Harry Connick, Jr. concert tonight.  My mother bought tickets for dad for his birthday  but they were unable to go due to the fact that they were in Lafayette, LA and he was here, in Atlanta.  I gladly accepted the tickets when offered and asked a boy who shall remain nameless to go with me.  He said no, so Jen and I went.  (In retrospect I'm really glad he didn't go.  Would have been quite akward when the romantic lighting and songs came on.)  Anyway, it was an outdoor concert on a sultry southern evening with lots of lightning bugs and tea lights.  Mr. Connick, Jr. has one of the all time sexiest voices around, not to mention his accent (gotta love those LA boys), the fact that he's hysterically funny, can play the piano like no one I've ever heard, and loves his family.  As a quick example of the accent: there was a woman in the audience that had a birthday tonight.  She had a sign that said something like "It's my birthday" or something equally as clever and so he says "Happy birthday, baby" in that sexy New Orleans drawl and I nearly fell out of my seat.  I HATE the endearment 'baby' but coming from him in that accent. . .I turned to Jenny and was like "he can call me baby anytime."  Then at the end he did a little butt dance. . .he's transcendant.   After said concert Susan, Jenny and I went to get food.  It was good.  We ended up in Susan's driveway having a therapy session for me b/c I'm not convinced I'm sexy and the girls were trying to devise ways to make me feel all sorts of sexy.  The best thing they could come up with was to drive home without a shirt.  So I did.  Just me and the bra (and the pants of course, not that it would have mattered.  No one could see below my collar bones).  So that was my evening. In other news, Caroline moved to WY for the summer.  I took her to catch her flight this morning and managed not to cry.  Matter of fact, I haven't cried about it yet.  I don't fool myself into thinking this will last. :)

      Well, since the perfume Deep Red always remind me of Romania and this post is to be about Romania and death, it seemed rather fitting.  Most of you reading this will be familiar with the infamous Black Turtleneck Society and its founding (if not, see me for the details) over a year ago at the St. Patrick's day party at the Irish embassy in Romania.  Now, the woman who sparked this great society (of which the members are fast diminishing.  When is it my turn, dammit?) was named Victoria and when we met her she was very drunk.  Being very drunk is not always the most likeable state for someone to be in, but even if she was a little overbearing she was entertaining and had a great sense of humor.  Lauren has just informed me that this lady was killed last week (alonf with her daughter) when a train hit her car.  This post is in memory of her.  Not much I know, but it's what I've got.

      Ok, so when I got up this morning I had a whole list of things to do, namely consisting of packing and cleaning my room, and finishing something for my classes (nothing too specific about that).  Well, I got up at 8:30 to read over the new leasing contract that Caroline typed up for the room she's moving into (moved into rather) and then lazed about for an hour or so, somehow slicing my toe in the process of doing nothing.  The time up until about 2 pm was spent givng things to Goodwill, washing clothes, cleaning off my book cases, etc.  Then Caroline comes home to move her bed over to the new room.  In the process of flailing about in the telling of a story, I hit my bad wrist on the doorframe.  Needless to say that did not feel well, so it's been twinging in it's  brace on and off all day.  Then I started talking to Susan about her date and how fabulous it was and then Jenny chimed in and started talking about this fabulous guy she'd met and I started to get a little lonely (and rightly so, I think.  My sister just moved out, there's no one in my house, and my two best friends have fabulous dates!) and I started to tear up a little bit, so I walked to the bathroom to get some tissue.  On the way back I stepped on a nail.  I sat down, looked at my foot and then burts into tears.  Then I looked at the mountain of laundry I need to fold (and can't b/c of my wrist) and cried even harder.  That's how Jenny found me when she walked in the door 10 minutes later.  She thought someone had died, and the truth is I haven't cried that hard since someone actually did die.  Hopefully the day can only get better.

      I have recently been reminded much of Norway.  Lauren and I went there the spring break we lived in Paris to visit my dad's friends that live in Oslo.  (Consequently, they're arguably the most fabulous family ever; long live Haarald, Siri, Kjetil, and Geir  In other news, Steph's Bat Mitzvah was last night.  The service itself lasted something like 3 hours, but since we love Steph, we didn't complain.  There were 2 major highlights of said service; the song at the end that Susan and I thought we weren't going to make it through (see post title) for fits of laughing, and the fac that Susan picked up a 19 year old at the reception.  Now I thought that picking up a guy at a play was bad, but a Bat Mitzvah?  I can't decide whether to applaued her or strangle her.

      I must say something.  I have left someone out who was (and is) extremely instrumental in the founding of The Cult of the Sexy Bitches (hereafter CotSB) and I have been remiss in leaving out this wonderful young woman, also known as my sister.  You see, every time Susan or my sister Caroline has a problem with a man, they swear up and down that they want to join a convent (Susan wants to go Ireland, Caroline to Germany).  Now the inherent problems with this plan are that neither one of them are Catholic and neither one of them could ever really give up men for all eternity.  So Susan and Caroline made a joint decision to come up with their own religion so they could be nuns (I'll have to post some other time on the strange fascination with nuns that we seem to have) but they wouldn't have to be Catholic. Their convent also had to be in someplace with lots of good looking men and enough room for Caroline to have horses.  The jury's still out on where this might be.  So there you go Caroline.  Doesn't it seem like I really hate you?

      Well people, this is my first post on my own, brand spanking new blog.  I have no idea what to do with it at this point, but I'm sure I'll learn as I go.  Hopefully I'll remember to post interesting tidbits about various things, but for now I'll just write some inane things. . .like about my quest for shoes today.  So since I work in every mall in the city of Atlanta, one would think that it would be easy to find colorful shoes to go with a black dress, right?  WRONG.  Apparently the only colors out there in the shoe world are black, red, and suddenly an overwhelming number of shades of pink.  Now, I went through the pink shoe phase about 6 months ago, so I didn't want any more pink shoes, but could I find any that weren't?  I think you all know the answer to that question: no.  So I said to Susan (who met me after work and got her hair cut, which took 2 hours!  She has no hair, how can it take that long?) "Susan, why can't I find a pair of green shoes?"  She looked at me as if I was slightly crazy and we continued on our search.  We found the clothes she happened to be looking for and with a mere ten minutes left before the mall closed, we decided to look at the shoes in Bloomingdale's.  I was disheartened when I found a pair of Lulu Guinness shoes I've been lusting after that were one sale.  Why disheartened, you say?  The sale price was $350.  But I trudged on and rounded a corner. . .and there they were.  Apple green, patent leather heels with black corseting on the toe.  (They sound hideous, I know but they really are quite cute.  I'll post a pic when I figure out how.)  I was scared when I turned them over because I was sure they were going to be $500 bucks, but to my great relief they were only $50!  Huzzah for that! And on an equally shallow note:  Susan has declared that our new religion is the Cult of the Sexy Bitch.  I really enjoy this because it celebrates how sexy we are without the benefit of men.  One can be sexy with a man, but it's not nearly as powerful because then you should only attempt to make one man think you're the sexiest bitch alive; not all men.  A man would be very limiting at this stage of life I think. . .anyway, we also think that we're going to make shirts and thus absorb the Black Turtleneck society wherein when you loose your black turtleneck, you get a low cut, sexy bitch shirt.  I like these ideas muchly.

          Ok, so I've been incredibly remiss in posting.&nbsp; But I do have an excuse:&nbsp;my password for the school computers doesn't work, so I've been forced to either grab someone else's computer before they log off or go to the internet cafe and pay money for it.&nbsp; You see how often that's happened.&nbsp;  &nbsp; The reason I am able to post now is that I'm in the lovely Dasvaand home in Oslo, Norway.&nbsp; I love these people.&nbsp; I want to marry into their family simply because I like the family so much.&nbsp; Not to mention that they're a very good looking group of people.&nbsp; Very nordic.&nbsp;  &nbsp; So here's a summary of what's happened so far:&nbsp; arrived in London.&nbsp; Found dorm in London.&nbsp; Went to class in London.&nbsp; Found out my scene partner is highly attractive, but staunchly conservative.&nbsp; It's ok though, as he's a great guy.&nbsp; Went to Paris for a weekend with friends Seth and Jenna to visit Ste. Astrid the Oppressed and see the city.&nbsp; It was fun.&nbsp; Missed friend Lauren.&nbsp; Paris just isn't the same without her.&nbsp; The next weekend was spent in London with the people we'd befriended from John's Hopkins.&nbsp; Don't have a clue what we did.&nbsp; Maybe Seth knows. . . .Right!!&nbsp; Ste. Astrid came to visit me and we went to Harrod's and did London-y things.&nbsp; Now, this weekend, Seth and I have come to Norway.&nbsp; Spent today with Geir, the Dasvaand son that I hadn't met (Kjetil was off sky diving, but I did get to see him last night) and went to the Viegland park, folk musuem, viking museum, and Holmenkollen.&nbsp; This place looks very different without ice and snow.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Some where along in there I ended up making out with someone (you all know who), having to fix that, realizing that I'm somewhere near in. . .can't say the words.&nbsp; You know what I mean though.&nbsp; It's baaaaaaaad. &nbsp; And that's been my London trip so far.&nbsp; There's more, but himself wants the computer. :)
