      Just dropped the dog off at the parents. its awfully quiet around here all the sudden. boyfriends at work and i have to go to work soon too, but in my head i am already on vacation. until this morning we weren't even sure we could go--there were a few snags:  1)we want to take the motorcycle, but i'll be damned if i am going to ride for 5 hours in the Texas heat with 40 lbs of backpack on. so we order a luggage rack and bag for the bitch seat. the bag comes in, the rack it is supposed to sit on is on backorder. lovely. then why even send the bag? its useless with out the rack! the bag is too big to sit on the rear fender. plus the motorcycle is the "other woman" and my boyfriend would cry if "she" got any scratches on her behind. after calling the company, we realized we wouldn't get the rack on time. well shit. we already booked a room, got time off from our respective work places, etc. the BF called everywhere and finally had to order the rack through a local dealership. they promised it would be here in time, and although i had no faith, it was. (i am so pessimistic sometimes...)the BF picked it up today. When I saw it i was like - thats it ? just that little piece of metal cost over a 100 bucks? and caused so much frustration and almost cancelled our vacation? i could have made that in the garage! the BF wisely changed the subject. (I still have to come up with a alias for him, "the BF" sounds, well, stupid) 2)weather. now that we have the damned luggage rack, it looks like it is going to rain some of the weekend. Bf brought up a good question--what the hell is the difference between "isolated thunderstorms" and "scattered thunderstorms"??? do the isolated ones have abandonment issues, and the scattered ones are just unorganized??? what the hell does that mean? it means we are going to get rained on. but we decided we are going to go anyway. "its an adventure!" he says. why is it that when I want to go to the beach it rains? cant i have an adventure when it is nice out? so be it.   urlLink    pre luggage rack&nbsp; urlLink

        I slept in a bit today, had lunch with the BF, and was calmly (yeah right!)studying for the math (torture!) exam when my phone rings. Good student that I am, I ignore it. When the voicemail alert goes off, I jump up run to the phone, why, gee, it must be important if they left a message! Hell. I'd use telemarketers as a conversation outlet to get out of doing math, (" A cheaper phone bill! Tell me ALL about it! ") I don't recognize the number that called me, so I called to check my voicemail. Dontcha know it? it's work. When did bosses finally understand call screening? Mine will call from another number to trick you into answering:   "Uh yeah, its (insert boss'name here). We just fired (ridiculously unreliable co-worker's name here). So now the bartender is the only useful employee that we have besides the cook. Can you come in a few hours early? And,(alternate waitress name here) will be in later. ( strange pleading enters Mr. Boss guy's voice )um, call me if you get this. or you know, just come in, uh, ok? i'll try to call you again shortly." So here is where my dilemma begins... I could:         a)pretend I never got the message (and continue with math..)        b)call, lie, say I am 542 miles away, but I can still get there           on time for  my  shift (unlikely to be believed}        c)just go already.  So I went. Here is where the circus begins.  I get there. a party of six comes in. six more join them. another 10. before I know it I have a party of fifty people. I am the only waitress. other tables wander in, looking annoyed that i dont jump all over them. can they not see all those people over there? "can I have some tea, and water?" "can i have another thing of ranch?" um, let me see no no and, no. my closing waitress comes in about an hour early. THank God! but... she is too wasted to carry a tray. she screws up a few tables. the boss sends her home. now, not only did I go in early- I will now be staying late.  So this madness continues until 2:30am. We kick everyone out and i sink to the floor delirious, and exhausted. I made money though, which is the important thing. I came home to tell you all this and barely made it, so this post is late sorry.  I hope everyone shows up tonight,  sober . I mean really, what's it take?? remind me to bitch slap that other waitress when I see her again.

      i'm a survivor!...of karaoke night, where the karaoke night "MC" is doing a drunk-off-her-ass version of Bonnie Tyler's "Total eclipse of the heart" right... I really need to invest in a universal remote so only I can control the volume, CD, or station played. There is nothing worse than the karaoke induced migrane. I have nothing against karaoke--I have been known to scald a few eardrums myself after a shot(or six..) Someone needs to tell some of these people that they suck. If I do something, and I suck, I count on people to let me know. And usually they do.(you do right?) These people singing tonight have evil friends, i think. I can picture it around the water cooler:    "hey guys, karaoke night is tonight, be there, cuz I am goin ta do carly simon!" says Mr. self-thought singing sensation.    And when he walks away:    "Is he for real?"    "Yeah, its hysterical. we buy him drinks and watch his embarrass himself in front of who ever sticks around to hear it, then we take photos and paste them at work! ( maniacal laughter )"  Either that or people are just delusional, and have been told they suck several times and still can't accept it.   There are people that are truly meant to sing, and waste their breath singing at karaoke night. These are the people that you stop tuning out, the ones that are so good you can't stop listening. None tonight however, ..not that im an expert...  So what is new with you??  If you want to start your own journal, or share pictures online easier than email attachments... ( initials VS! lol )email me and let me know. its pretty easy to do free.  till next time, incognito

      tonight kinda sucked. I didn't make much money and my customers were high maintenance. People should have to wait tables for one week out of every year to remind them what it is like. For god's sake man! If I walk past your table every five minutes to pour you more water, don't say "nah I am fine" 15 times and then two minutes later say belligerently "miss! can I get some water!" It is just rude, sorry. And for the love of god, if you need separate checks, tell me before I print out and bring the check. Is this really difficult to do or something?  ok I will stop ranting. (but really, it sucked.)  Seriously i am a better waitress then I anticipated. no really!   I miss my friends when I am working alot. that's the bitch about cell phones, when you are working, take a smoke break and check your voicemail, and you get  this  message:          "So, (insert any friend's name here) and (other friends}    are ,like, headed to (any random, yet cool, interesting destination). Wanna go?  To which my response is one of these three things:  1)sorry(random friend)no cash whatsoever   2)I wish, but it would take me at least two days to get there                       or  3)no response at all because i used up my breaktime listening to my voicemail           Such is life.  I am taking a mini vacation next weekend to the coast. Nothing fancy, just a little road trip. I will post some pictures for sure. I'm getting tired, and if you are still awake after reading this post, you must have had to much caffeine today.  And yet, she goes on ladies and gentlmen!   Please dont think you  have  to read this thing, i post mainly to keep my own journal, but you are welcome to read it.  Audience groans, why didn't you say so?  Also please gracefully ignore spelling, punctuation, grammar, or capitalization discrepencies. (Side note: if you are someone i dont know reading this, i am married to a copyright lawyer who is a bodybuilder and i have a dozen pitbulls.. with lazer guns on their forheads. ...oh yeah, and a moat with leeches and alligators.. with nightvision! yeah.)  Now that ya'll have read the disclaimer..   You are allowed to stop reading now, it can only get worse.

      right now I should be studying for a math test I have to take in two weeks. Ugh, I hate math. This is why I am boring you all to tears on the computer, so I can put off studying.  right now the dog is barking incessantly at the movers next door.  right now I am considering a muzzle.  right now I am also doing laundry, such a multi tasker I am, laundry, contemplation of dog-icide, procrastination of math studying, typing, boring my friends...  right now I am cursing whoever made downloading photos so damn complicated.  right now I am wishing I would have paid more attention to those godawful computer classes they made us take in high school.  right now I am wondering who will read this crap.  right now I really don't care.  right now I am thinking how strange it is that I have two close friends at 721 iron st and they probably don't even know that they are there together.  right now I am looking at the clock thinking I have 3 hours left before I have to go to work  math and work. Ugh.  right now I gotta get a life

      This is the new way I am going to try to let my friends know what's new in my life, to an extent. Due to creepy stalker weirdos that may or may not come across this blog, I am going to have to change names and some locations to protect the... well, if not innocent, unsuspecting. For those of you that have stumbled upon this blog, and don't know me-I can tell you now that my life is pretty uninteresting even to myself, so sorry in advance... I go to school full time, and I sling alcohol in a local bar/grill. I spend a bit too much time in said work location, primarily because the people I work with have become friends. I have lots of friends and family in the northeast and it is for them that I have created this site, if they bother to check it out that is. I have a fantastic boyfriend, and I am soon going to assign him a pseudonym so I can talk about him more. I intend to post some fun pictures, and I will try to write a few lines everyday, but no promises on that one

      another day, another shower.  sometimes in the "morning" (my term for whenever i get up)  i dread getting into the shower.  does this happen to anyone else?  it is as if the shower is sucking away precious time.  "i just did this yesterday!"  perhaps it is this way because i am tiring of the routine.  get up,  let dog out,  check email,  drink coffee,  let dog back in,  take shower, (soak, shampoo, shave, conditioner, rinse)  dress for work, (black tank, jeans, docs)  apply makeup that will disappear after an hour of work,  check email again,  eat, or type blog,  go to work,  run around like a madwoman for a few hours,  sit,  smoke cigarettes, drink beer, converse,  go home,  drink more beer,  stay up too late,  finally go to sleep.   repeat.   janis joplin once said "...it's all the same fucking day, man..."   you said it janis.

      i had finally gotten used to the old neighbors.  they were a couple with two dogs, a border collie and a sweet little ankle-biter.  the collie and my dog didn't always see eye to eye, but the ankle-biter and my dog had a bond.  the people they owned were a bit on the boring side, although very personable.  then,  they sold their house.   to people who cut down all the vegetation on their side of the property  and along our fence line.  with three dogs,  one obnoxiously yappy,  one sweet,  and one just downright mean.   i have to chaperone my dog into the yard, the mean dog looks like he is about to come over the fence and take a chunk out of him.  my dog plays it cool,  lifting his leg on our side of the chain link fence-  peeing directly on the frothing, growling,&nbsp;fanged, beast.   the yappy one is worse.  i can't go out and have a cigarette without inadvertently waking the entire neighborhood.  and the motorcycle?  forget it.  i may as well live in a dog pound.   the people of the family equally suck.  as i mentioned, there is no longer the lush green illusion of privacy between our yards.  that green "fence" often provided enough of a buffer between us and the old boarders,  that we could forsake the polite hellos, and how are yous,  when we were respectivly outside and not wanting to be bothered.  not now.  the mr. of the house,  after destroying various wildlife habitats by ripping out trees,  is now constantly in the yard doing  something...    (doesn't this guy have a job??)   i am tempted to ask him to help develop a schedule where i can enjoy my yard, and he can run a chainsaw, rip up the deck, blast country music,  say i get sun, mon and wed?  he can have tues, thurs, fri and sat???? pleeze???  i have altogether given up on the idea of a tan this summer.  i really don't feel comfortable laying out in my yard when he is over there.  that see through metal fence doesn't provide enough cover for me.   apparently the mrs. of the house has no such problems.  today,  her rotund form was doing a yoga routine that brought to mind the death of a beached whale.  bitch.  how come she can roll around imitating a gran mal seizure,  when i am not comfortable baking my flesh in my own (fairly expensive) backyard?   i told the Bf that he shoud belch, scratch his ass, and pee alot outside, in order to offend the offensive couple enough to put up a privacy fence.   &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      i had an anon comment politely letting me know that my posts have become somewhat irregular in their appearance.  sorry to those who are fans.  i have run into the limitations that accompany free web&nbsp;sites, in that i have been trying to add interesting links to the site, and i can't place them where i want to.  so, i tried to set up a new site elsewhere, and ran into the&nbsp;same problems.  i am telling you this in order to justify my&nbsp;slow posting habits. (it was with you all in mind!)  until i come up with a good name for my web site, i am stymied.  any suggestions?  i have to  buy  a domain name and i want it to be a good one, that isn't already taken.   last night i sat staring at my monitor until the wee hours of the morning,  coming up with all this amusing stuff you might like.  to drunk to type, (well)  i forgot it all.  it seem that i am equally blessed with writing ability-  as i am cursed with poor memory.  so be it.   lately i have been putting pressure on myself to write more.  as a result i am suffering from writer's block.   i suppose that some things in life,  typically those that make the most interesting topics-  are the most difficult to share.   every one has the friends that are  listeners..   the people that you tell everything to.  i have a few. one for each topic:  one to bitch about men with,  one to bitch about women with,  one to bitch about work with,  one to gossip with,  one to talk about books with,  one to discuss depression with, and  there is always the "kiss and tell" friend, of course.  the problem is that two of my "listeners" are locked up right now.  i have no outlet, and less imput.  i can, and have, written letters, and i like letters, but they are so-  automatic, i guess.  "hi, how are you? i am fine. i am doing this and i did this and so and so went here,  love, incognito."  very one-sided.  this blog is not dissimilar, but i can&nbsp;read comments from those who care to join my solo conversation.  (poor dears..)  (kidding!)   i think what i need to do is carry around my legal pads more, and just write down what strikes me, however inconvienent:  me:"hi! welcome to So & So's what can i get for you to drink?&nbsp;&nbsp; oh wait just a sec....  ( scribble scribble )  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sorry, was that a guiness and,..... and a&nbsp; what  now?  ( more frantic writing... )  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hi, welcome to so &so's......."    i can see my tips swirling down the drain.  i work with a girl like this, who has too many thoughts in her brain to focus on, well, pretty much anything.  sometimes i wonder exactly what has taken up so much attention that she forgets so much, and so often.  maybe she is on a 7 sec.&nbsp;delay, and the instant she begins a new task, she remembers the old one.  this kind of thing is usually indicative of a person who absorbs much more than you or i,  but absorbing doesn't neccesarily mean retaining.  i hope&nbsp;ADHD isn't contagious,  because i have been experiencing some symptoms.....   (as if you couldn't tell)

      about a year ago, my mother recounted a dream she had, where she bumped into a girl  she knew from high school.  typical to dreams, though, her waking self didn't recognize the girl in the dream.  the dream girl told my mother that she was always impressed by my mom's amazing artwork,  and does she still paint?  to which my mother replied, "oh, well i don't really do that stuff anymore."  &nbsp;  in my interpretation the dream was telling&nbsp;my mom&nbsp;something.  the girl she didn't recognize was probably herself-  maybe the self that loved creating art, the self that my mom left behind.  &nbsp;  the conversation left me sad for the unfamiliar face in the dream,  an abandoned&nbsp;personality&nbsp;voicing her unhappiness&nbsp;over being kept quiet for so long.  &nbsp;  to think of how many unrecognizable girls that used to be me...

      &nbsp;  i want to write like the guys at the slam.  there is some need to practice,  just to get used to the keys and the mind to finger effectually on that which is the keyboard.  i have never understood the people who can type without watching where their fingers were.  then again, I never was much of a typist.  &nbsp;  im insanely jealous of the poets on slam night.  they are theatrical and intelligent and sensible and beautiful  in giving me the right of audience to their emotions  though they know me not,  i hear their pain, their memories, their embarrassing dates, and their first loves.  poetry is the rawest of all the freedoms of expression.  art can give you the disguise of metaphor or color.  novels and movies give the illusion of candor, hidden in wit..  the hoarse voice of&nbsp; reality  is the poet’s domain.  &nbsp;  but for that reason-I shouldn’t care.  i am no poet.  i report the realities.  reality lacks style.  there is no finesse to reality.  or it wouldn’t be reality-it would be fox news.

      i took myself to the poetry slam last night all my friends were at work, and i wasn't, so i figured- why not? took the bus downtown, where i proceeded to walk in the opposite direction from where i wanted to go. then i figured it out, turned around and walked back the way i came, feeling like an idiot i don't think anyone noticed... anyway, i get to the bar where they have the slam, and it is packed. standing room only. (which really sucks if you are 5'4) if you have never been to one of these things, you are missing out. no, really. it is not a poetry reading, where artsy types stand on stage and simper in haiku. and it is not a beatnik thing, with everyone in black. its a slam. a contest. these people get up on stage and tell their stories in rhythm. its fascinating. some poems are heart wrenching, some are angry, some lustful, some hysterical. the judges hold up their scores, and as the mcee reads them out, the audience judges the judges. if the crowd thinks the score is too low there is a collective- ooooohhhhhhhhhh groan! its fun. MP and TK tried to meet me there after work,  but the bouncer turned them away because the bar was at max capacity. i saw them exit and was about to follow them out, but the mcee said there was to be one last poem. a tall man in horn rim glasses and a cowboy hat took the stage. last time i went to the slam, me and MP accidentally stole his lone seat while he was up, so i felt sneaking out during his performance would be over the top rude. in the first round he had recited a poem of love for his girlfriend who sat in the back, her feet guarding his chair. he told the crowd this was to be his last slam.  he was moving back to ohio to be with his girl. after the collective cry of disappointment he began. i shamefully admit that i wasn't paying too much attention, wondering if MP was waiting.. in the last line he said- "when i read this to you on the phone, you said i must be tired..." the audience laughs. then he unexpectedly gets off the stage. he walks straight back to the rear of the room. the audience is clapping for his performance, but they suddenly fall silent as the man in the cowboy hat drops to his knee, and takes his girl's hand. "you were right, i am tired. tired of not seeing you, tired of not waking up next to you, tired of missing you." he takes out a ring from his shirt pocket. "i know this isn't much, but i love you, and promise to always love you...  ...will you marry me?" the girl replies, "yes, of course" and they kiss,  oblivious to the yelling, applause, and misty eyes that surround them. romance still exists...i saw it with my own misty eyes.

      for those of you looking at this site and it seems to be constantly changing: i found a new photo site, but it needs to be edited as far as where it places the photos. so for the next few hours you will look, see posts, and then they might be gone or in a different place. hang in there...it will be OK, i promise. i will delete this post when the pictures are in the place i want them to be.  for those of you interested in hosting your own blog do not, i repeat, do not use "hello" because it is stupid. use this instead: www.flickr.com for your photo uploading needs. more to follow!

      if you are a regular reader then you would have already seen part one. although i doubt you are..... if you dont know part one, then part two is equally as boring dont read either one.  i email the "hello" program site, as i told you and they again erase my existing account. after so many swings at this program i email the blog site and say this:  From: incognito Subject: Hello is useless Date: Wed,  7 Jul 2004 19:14:02 -0700 (PDT)  the upload program, Hello, is absolutely ridiculous. i have had a few different user names (4!) and each one starts off working, and then on  the next visit it asks me for email verification, and never sends the  email. or sometimes the name and password fields are greyed out. i contacted their support and they didnt offer any solution except for clearing the email and starting over, losing the saved pictures each time. on the forums on hello's site you can find that many users are having such difficulties. i havent been able to post pictures to my site for days,  so i havent been able to post for days. not much of a weblog in that case,  is it? PLEASE find a service that actually provided the service it offers.  (Pretty reasonable right?)  and they reply:  Hi there,(hi there???? not even personalized!)  Unfortunately, we do not provide support for Hello. Please visit http://blahblahblah.plp for further assistance with this  matter.  Sincerely,            etc etc  So to which i replied:    no  shit ? so then offer me another option. (please note that i had already mention i had contacted hello support..)  i go through this computer generated crap all day, everyday lately. i need a computer to make sure my bank isnt screwing me, seriously. my bank withdrew 60 bucks of "courtesy fees" last week. no i didnt overdraft, i called, indignant like, it seems their mainframe had a slight "glitch" creepy. i wonder how often this happened  before  the internet... then i went to my employer's bank to cash my paycheck, and not only am i fingerprinted, but they charged me five bucks to cash a check drawn on the same bank! am i the only person who hasnt quite gotten used to paying money to get your OWN money??? i could have gone to cash my check for 70 cents at a gas station for god's sake! And the ATMs are just as bad. the bank charges me a buck and the ATM (MAC to the northerners) charges me a buck fifty. so to take out 20 bucks may as well count as 25. with the seven cents a year i get for interest, it is better to bury money in a coffee can in the yard! if you have alot of money then bank savings, iras', CD's-it's all you. but if you are me? banks are just places you go to cash your checks...if that.  going on with the computer generated annoyance... i hate talking to the fake person when you call somewhere: "hi im irene, your automated assistant!- Please say if you want billing, service, or new orders!" i say, oh forget it.

      i promise to post b-day pics when(if)they become available. (see below post) it was lots of fun, even though we decided to get together at my work. MP and her man were there, as was my good friend KH and his friend. The BF came by after work, and of course my work crew was there, some working, some not. i might have paid for two drinks all night, and i think they were the BF's. my friends bought me a drink or two each, the bartender (MS!) bought me a few. my work friends kept buying me shots, and the regulars who were out on the patio got me a few rounds. the interesting part was that i think i was the least drunk at the end of the night, with possibly the exception of A? who just got off of work. one friend in particular, who said she wasnt going to drink much, (you know who you are!) decided at one point that she would be responsible for birthday spanking. although i had vetoed this idea earlier in the night, she ignored me and, damn she hits hard! its ok i teased her mercilessly the next day. at least no one sang. happy birthday that is, BF did a karaoke rendition of a guns-n-roses tune. it wasnt karaoke night, but that didnt seem to bother anyone. i lost some pool games, as usual, and smoked more cigarettes then i thought possible. we left before last call, (we have  some  dignity!) and met up at my place where the party continued, for  some  of us, ahem. then i kicked everbody out because i didnt want to embarrass myself further by falling over.  it wasnt a big bash or anything, but it was cool to hang out with all my (texas) friends in one day. CM in cali sent me a cute ecard, (who i have yet to email, sorry CM! i promise to get in touch soon)as did my mom who also donated funding to the broke "incognito" fund (thanks mom!!!) to those of you that forgot, its ok i probably forget yours too.

      well i havent posted in a few days because i wanted to put up some pictures from my birthday get together, and the photo uploading program this site uses is  completely  useless.  here is the process i have to go through to show you my pictures: 1)upload the photos from the digital camera to BF's computer be cause the cameras software is on his PC 2)save said pictures 3)run the stupid "hello" program so i can transfer the pics to my computer via internet (i'd save them to photodiscs but my drive cant read them) 4)open the stupid program on my computer 5)transfer the pictures by file name one by one (talk about tedious) 6)transfer the pics from my "hello" account to the blog 7)the blog wont let me publish the pictures within the text so, i then edit the newly posted picture and copy the html 8)delete the picture from the place it was automatically put by "hello" 9)edit my draft by placing the pic's html code within the text where i want the pictures to be on the final post.  mind you this process is for one pic. if that isn't bad enough, the "hello" program itself is screwed up, so most of the time i cant log into it under my username for my computer, or BF's username on his, or both. very frustrating. but this blog site only uses the "hello" program so my options are: get a new hard drive, (involving detailed setup on my old PC) get a new blog site, (losing all text and photos i have here) throw the towel in, (losing my loyal reader following)  (ha!)  scream and rant at my computer,(most likely the option i will choose)  sheesh.

      Day three we woke up late haha and checked out the birdwatching board walk we had the place to ourselves for a while, which was cool. on the path going into the marsh we encountered this:      urlLink    scary!&nbsp; urlLink     as you can see we were a bit nervous. well i was and BF was hamming it up for the camera... so we figured hell-forget the birds, we were going alligator watching!        urlLink    waiting for the elusive blue figit&nbsp; urlLink     we didnt see any. we saw a few birds, egrets, one little guy with red dots on his wings, and a lot of pelicans. pelicans are such throwbacks.  they look like something from jurassic park. and they are camera shy.  then we chilled at the beach for a little while and we went surfing...  urlLink    not.&nbsp; urlLink    when we got back to the motel, BF was struck with the notion of staying another day, i said, hell-lets just not go back! (i always say that) we made a few calls and found out that the weather in the city was bad anyway and the forcast for day four was bleak, but the day after would be nice. well... you wouldnt have us riding back in the rain would you?? BF got his shift covered, mine wasnt an issue since i took a few extra days off. excitement renewed, we were gonna stay another day!!!! then we went to a nice dinner because i needed an excuse to wear my red platforms  urlLink    note the shoes...&nbsp; urlLink    we passed on seafood becuz BF iisnt a fan, and went to this great mexican place...it was sooooo good. they had over 60 tequilas, but we were now on a "staying-an-extra-day" budget, so we didnt partake. this outing was my first attempt at riding a motorcycle with a dress and heels. easier than you might think! later we watched more cable !!!!!  i love discovery channel!  Day four we slept untill 2pm, hit the beach insearch of sand dollars, no luck, but we now have a ton of shells. (ok, maybe not a ton...) then we went on a casino cruise. (yes! another excuse to dress up!)(i'm such a dork) here is the boat:   urlLink    texas treasure&nbsp; urlLink    we got buffet dinner with the cruise tickets, very yummy. it was strange to see how fine dining works. i felt out of place. oh well fuck it. once we hit international waters... let the shameless gambling begin! we only had 40 bucks each to spend, but we decided to make it last on the quarter slots. we started out good. then we found out that BF is not an ocean person. poor guy, i mean he didnt get seasick, but i could tell he didnt feel good. but, trooper that he is he gambled to the end... of the money that is  we didnt win squat.  urlLink    boo hoo, we didnt win!&nbsp; urlLink          urlLink    what? i didnt win??&nbsp; urlLink     Day five the way back was smooth sailing, hot and sunny the whole way. i hope you enjoyed the vacation account stay tuned for photos of my birthday get together! till next time

      Day two was awesome we went to the beach, swam, boogie boarded, drank shots of tequila and took a bunch of pictures. the seagulls there are aptly named laughing gulls, because they sound like they're cracking up. really. everytime they laughed, i laughed. they also all face the ocean when they are on the ground, i swear i got a picture of that, but i cant find it. oh well. it is so hard to upload pictures from this site it is ridiculous!!!  and then BF got eaten by a shark!!!      urlLink    not really&nbsp; urlLink    ok, maybe not.  urlLink    this was the shark&nbsp; urlLink     it was alot of fun, just being on the beach. and....i wore a thong bikini!!!!! (sorry mom) no pictures of that though. (audience breathes collective sigh of relief) i felt bold enough to buy it, but really it just meant that i sat down alot when i wore it. and sunburnt my rear pretty well. here are some random beach shots         urlLink    da beach&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    and so on&nbsp; urlLink     it was very cool. then we went back to the lodge and watched cable ahhh the luxury!!!!

      Well folks, so sorry for the delay. wished that i'd had a laptop with wireless access the whole time i was there, in order to send out a report live at the scene, so-to-speak...  We decided to stay an extra day, in order to avoid the rain on the way back...              ...so thats the official story anyway. WE HAD A BLAST!  As I relayed in my last post, there were a few discouragement before getting underway. And-it was looking very not cool for a 5 hour ride on the bike to the coast. we hadn't even got out of the city on Sunday morning when we had to stop and pull over because of heavy thunderstorms. (by the way, i think it was an  isolated  thunderstorm, haha) we parked at a gas station for about 45 min, wondering if we should call it off after all. the storm was low enough to see what direction it was headed, so when it went in the direction we came from, we decided to take our chances.  urlLink    pre-hitting the road gas up&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    note the luggage&nbsp; urlLink     we had to stop a few times, and finally found a wal-mart where we picked up rain gear. much smoother sailing from that point. (naturally) all the rain was in the city. suckers! outside of the city, Texas becomes a different world. we went through so many stranded towns interspersed with very beautiful country. we stopped off for gas in a town that was charmingly antiquated, that was in the middle of the "watermelon thump" festival. Don't ask me.... following is a picture of us there (if i can manage to upload it)   urlLink    middle of nowhere (nixon, tx)&nbsp; urlLink      ... i think this is what my not-texan friends think of when they think of texas, but these areas of texas really remind me of PA.    urlLink    yucky weather&nbsp; urlLink      i would have liked to get more pictures of the horizon, but cameras and motorcycles are not the ideal option; instead i will describe some of it for you... imagine that someone had sliced off the top of your car. as a passenger, I am free to look at everything my car windshield cant show me. i can find shapes in the clouds, watch horses and their foals fun across huge ranges. you can see for miles no, no cacti or desert. once we got closer to the coast, i could smell the ocean. i really love that smell, and i love the sound of surf. when i find the time to meditate or relax, the ocean is the place my mind goes.  so anyway, we had to cross a ferryboat to get to the island. it made me nervous, i was afraid that the bike would fall over. of course that didn't happen, but i still couldnt get used to the ferry even though we crossed on it a few times..   urlLink    the BF had no problem with the ferry, as you can see. (note the change of weather)&nbsp; urlLink     we had beautiful weather once we got there. we found our lodge pretty quickly. it was hard to miss. it was called "the laughing horse" and was decorated pretty crazy. it was cute   urlLink    blinded by the light....&nbsp; urlLink     our first night there we went to a local niteclub and drank entirely to much, well, i did anyway, but we took a cab so no harm no foul-except for my headache the next day... Day two to follow later.. i mean i do have a life other than this computer, you know... well not really but it is my b-day! so i will post the rest of my vacation story soon i promise

      win some, lose some, thats what i always say. ok, so i'm not sure i have ever actually said that, but it would be appropriate.  i am abandoning the borg bar. as are most of the other humans. the human manager, myself, 2 waitpersons, and a bartender are all done with the place. it will be interesting to see how the place runs without it's entire night crew. the other day we had an employee meeting, during which every person who attended, wished they hadn't. later that night, after all the borgs went home, we closed the bar down two hours early, took our beer money elsewhere, and proceeded to get extremely intoxicated.  last night we had our own impromtu meeting. it was easy since the employees outnumbered the customers. i told everyone that i had just submitted my 2 week notice, BP said she had done the same. JB said he wanted to be gone by saturday. AJ said he didn't want to stay either. R? said this was her last week too. i think once everyone realized that 5 out of 8 of the night crew were leaving, well hell with it lets just all go now! there was talk of a big walkout, but since there is not a night that we all work together- it would be kinda silly. somewhere along the way we just decided that we just would simply not go back.  the remaining employees are: one bartender, a recently demoted cook, the dayshift waitress, and three new waitresses. they are not so happy about it, but they understand. or if they don't, they will, very soon.  it is sad too. we have all put so much into making this work. i hope one of the old owners opens another bar, like today. i have never worked with a better cast of characters, never enjoyed my job so much (until recently obviously..) i wish we could walk into another bar together. "hire all of us, because we are a great team, and we have our own clientele!"  we are having a celebratory booze fest this friday night, at another local-ish pub. i am pretty sure we will drink them out of lonestar, cheap bourbon, and monopolowa. the legend continues...  long live the punchy's in all of us.

      it has been forever sinces i have posted. unfortunately it is because i am having a hard time being funny, or even slightly interesting lately. i am stressing a lot about everything it seems. how interesting it is that when it rains, it fucking floods.  category 1: work our fearless leader, the human boss (yes really!) has left us afloat in a sea of borg-like supervisors. they all were hired by the borg king, and therefore are now the only employees who count. the human boss has left us with little hope of his return. (but, hope is hope however faint.) as a result all the human or humanoid employees are on the brink of a mass exodus. so what, you say? well our old fearless leader used to do the schedule, guess who is doing it now? that's right ladies and gentlemen, yours truly. feeling like a traitor to the human race, i accepted the task of headwait (after they gave it to someone else and then took it back,) and now i am in charge of a handful of righteously pissed humans, some new to this whole drama. but what the borgs do not know is that like myself, another of the managers is actually human. and all hopes for the future of the federation depend on our subterfuge. wish us good luck and godspeed. (really, i am so dramatic sometimes... the whole startrek metaphor could have been bypassed by simply comparing the work situation to a playground screaming match over who is really the goose among all the ducks.)  category 2: money directly relating to the above mediocre crisis, money is tight. i am at work more, but making significantly less. i think the customers can smell the undercurrent of reality tv that is stinking up the place. the waitstaff is surly (more than usual,) and the new people are entering a hostile workplace. the new menu lists about a thousand things we don't have, and the food is completely inconsistent. patrons hate inconsistency- why do you think chain stores are so popular? (maybe the customers are borgs too!) human or not, they aren't coming in as much. (disclaimer: to those who still come in to drink their poison of choice, we appreciate and admire your bravery in light of the borg infestation. we should all hope to display such courage) and with paltry sales comes the other ugly twin, paltry tips. not to mention i have too many people on the floor for training. more people working + less people coming in=less money for all. in addition, school is starting at the end of this month. i was seriously looking forward to the loan disbursement to tide me over. well, sorrrie. disbursement dates have changed. no money is given out until  after  the semester is in session. what the hell sense does that make?? it is  my  money after all. well, eventually i will default on paying it back, right?  category 3: the return of the psycho amid all the aforementioned pleasantry, i get a call from the DA's office friday afternoon. "uh yeah, we are gonna be going to trial on monday, maybe." to which i tactfully reply: " WHAT ?!?!? that is all the notice you can give me? after over a year of waiting for ya'll to get your shit together?" (saying it was tactful reply is called  sarcasm.  say it with me: sar-cas-m. very good.) beautiful timing, man. christ. for those of you who aren't privy to the happenings of my life prior to this blog, i have a bonafide psycho stalker. lucky me. without going into all the gruesome details, (that will be next week) the stalker is still incarcerated and awaiting trial. he has been offered a few plea bargains, (that is an offer to plead guilty to a lesser charge than the felony stalking charge. the state hates to pay for trials and would rather let the psycho go with a measly misdemeanors) but he does not take the plea bargain, because he won't admit to doing anything wrong. the guy is completely delusional. for example: after being put away for stalking me, he continues to write me letters from jail. smart. and the prison still lets him. am i the only one that sees the absurdity here? so anyway... i tell the DA that "monday, maybe" is a tad vague. he says he wont know for sure until the day in question. obviously this is category of problem directly conflicts with the work category. so now i get to explain to the borg chiefs that, thanks for the "promotion" and all, um i may need to schedule myself out next week because of court. you gonna go to jail? no. oh. i can see the confusion this causes the borg community, so i get to explain the stalker thing to them. lucky me. again.  men, borg or otherwise, never seem to believe me about the stalker thing. it is really annoying. my inner monologue always freaks out when i see the look of doubt when this topic arises: who made  you  judge and jury, asshole? you don't know me. you weren't fucking there. and it isn't even any of your fucking business anyway, fucker! it is sad how often this happens. now i know kobe bryant's accuser feels.  anyhoo, i call the DA bright and early monday morning. still no news. 2:30 comes and goes and still no word. i call again. "oh sorry that i didn't call you back. looks like it will be next week afterall, maybe" aaaarrrrrrrgggghhhhhhhhhhh! the world had been overrun with borgs!  category 4: newton's law of motion #3 with all this crap going on there has been equal and opposite reactions to my (already fragile) state of being. i have a constant pain in my stomach, ulcer anyone? more headaches, and various other physical symtoms i don't want to go into. i made a Dr appt, but they were so booked that i get to wait till the end of this month to go, which is also the same day school starts (borgs) of course i have no money to pay them, (student loan borgs) and for all i know i will be in the middle of trial, dredging up last year's misery in front of a bunch of suit and tie types, (bureaucratic borgs) a jury, (some with that doubtful look i'll bet.) and the stalker himself. joy. it doesn't get any better than this folks.  since i haven't been feeling well, and i'm stressed, i do what rational people do. get wasted drunk. as a result, (damn newton) i seem to have abandoned the sensor (censor?) in my brain that tells me to shuttup. lately i have developed this bad habit of telling people exactly what i think- what i think isn't always pretty (as if you couldn't tell.) so if you want to know what i really think of you, just buy me a drink.
