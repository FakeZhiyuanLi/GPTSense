      Things can get boring down here in South GA. Besides work and school there isn't much more to do than go out to a bar. Perhaps boredom causes people here to get a little more tore up than others. Many of us do things to excess in a vain attempt to entertain ourselves. This blog chronicles my search for this ellusive phenomenon.

      Let me tell you just how fustrating this job can be. The company I work for has spent nearly the last two years trying to roll out a reporting system with little success. The problem is that this is a DOS based system that they want to run on XP machines. Crazy I know....and guess who gets stuck with trying to make it work? I've had some luck converting machines to 98 but, the systems aren't stable. Despite my protests the company continues to push these machines. So anyway, today I'm going to use a 2000 machine with a VMWare installation of 98. I'm hoping that the program will only use the resources allocated to VMWare and not the whole machine. I have some faint hope that it would clear up some of the stability problems. Anyway...wish me luck!

      I created this blog site so that I would have a place to rant and rave about various situations I encounter in IT. I work network and system support for a commercial laboratory. I'll mostly post comments on the situations that arise at work and the companies and products I deal with.

      That UG Clan server is tight with the Harriers and all the other vehicles.  There is just too much lag to play though.  Once the server is full you can't have any fun because you can barely move.  The lag is much worse for people on the ground than it is for those flying around.  Look everyone loves having tons of vehicles to play with but,  they don't count for much if you can't move.  Thats why I love the Moon because its almost entirely lag free.  The UG Clan has to find some happy medium between filling the map with armor and running a server that performs.
