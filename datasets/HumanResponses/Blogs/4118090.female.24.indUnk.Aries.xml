          If there was one word to describe this movie, it would be "kilig." It was movie night once again for me, Mar, Er, Cat and Sasa as we watched "Now That I Have You" starring John Lloyd Cruz and Bea Alonzo.  I must admit, I enjoyed every minute of it. Call me "baduy" but I agreed with Cat when she said it wasn't dragging. The acting was good, cinematography was excellent and the story was so refreshing. My only problem was that the editing wasn't done well and at the middle of the movie, the sound was lost for a minute.  Regardless, it was an enjoyable night for us.  It had all the elements of a typical pinoy love story... there was the comedy, drama and who could forget the kilig moments?! It has a simple plot that anyone can relate to. I remember asking Er if it was deep like the last tagalog movie I saw, "All my Life." She said it was quite shallow but for sure I'd like it. Yeah, I did.  So what's my verdict? Two thumbs up. It is an entertaining and feel good movie.  I recommend this movie is to those who are in love and who (like me) want to be in love.  See you at the movies! =)

          I'm sorry, but I just have to let it all out...  A certain person in the office is totally annoying me. As in, she's a  bitch ! Sorry to use that term but its true. She is the most feeling, power-tripper I've ever met.  And she's only an executive secretary!!! She a conniving person who likes to get things her way even if it meant stepping over someone else. She'll create schemes to make you believe something that is not true to benefit her.  I swear, today, she scolded me and my officemates because we were exceeding the 15 minute break in the pantry.  Excuse me, we've only been there for about 10 minutes! I gave a really nasty look and walked away.  Next thing I know, she calls me in and talks to me about office policies! As if I'm not professional and I don't know the rules! Argh! She made it sound that the breaks made us perform poorly so now we were under observation. After the conversation, I just left the office with more feeling of hate towards her.  I know that I should try to understand where she's coming from but I can't. Sorry to say, but I have lost all respect towards her.  So many incidents has occurred (its a long story) and I am now convinced that she is a miserable person with a cold heart.  Grabe, I want to shout at her face, SECRTETARY KA LANG!!!

          Last Friday night, my grandma Pepita celebrated her 70-something birthday at Sugi.  There present was the whole Aquino family and some very close friends of hers.  Of course, her "special friend" from Italy arrived that evening just to be with her on her birthday.  Tito  Gianni has been family friends with Grandma since the 70's I think (even earlier!).  I call him her "special friend" because when my  lola  is around around him, she glows. Literally. I mean, she reminds me of a highschool student with a crush.  When she talks about him with my mom, she gets so excited! Every year,  tito  Gianni comes to the Philippines to celebrate her birthday.   That night, there was sooo much food! From sushi to tempura to... lechon?! Yes, there were 3 lechons in a Japanese restaurant.  My cousins and I figured that the lechon is a symbol of a feast in the Philippines that's why you can't have a party without it.  I just thought it was so yummy! Problem was, i couldn't really enjoy it with my chopsticks, so i had to ask for utensils. Overall, it was a fun-filled night and i'm so glad to see my lola so happy at her birthday.  Check out Marie's blog for pictures of the party!    Moving Out            Well, just to another room.... hehe! To my surprise, I went home from work last week with ALL my things outside my room, at the hallway. Argh!!! Hassle!!! My parents and sister, Marie, decided to have our room and bathroom renovated. Personally, I'm not in favor plan. Here are my reasons...  First of all, we're 24 years old.  I don't plan on staying in that room for a longer period of time.  I even asked Marie, "do you want to live here forever?" It's useless! Sooner or later, I'll be getting married and moving out of my house.  I don't know.  Secondly, we'll be studying next year abroad. Marie and I will be leaving next year for our Masters, meaning we'll only be able to enjoy our room for at least a year.  Lastly, its costly. With my brothers and sister studying abroad and my  kuya  getting married next year, I think its a waste of money to be spending on a room we'll be living in for only a year. We could have just saved it for something else.   I hope Marie's right. She says I'll thank her when all this is done. I gave her the power to pick out color schemes, beds, flooring, etc. I trust her taste and i hope that the end result will be nice. I have accepted that this is something my sister wants and if she's happy, I'm happy.  I just hope it finishes asap!

          Now this is more like it! This new title,  "shindig"  reflects my personality more.  I do make the most of my life and take things as they come. Some say i'm easy-going, happy-go-lucky, which are all true. But, I do want to live a fast paced life (not possible if you're in manila) and take more chances in the future.  So everyone... Work hard, party harder!
