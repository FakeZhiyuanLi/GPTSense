      It's been a very interesting four days.  This is the first National Convention I have ever actually felt drawn to watch, and I was amazed by the solidarity that I saw over it's duration. The progressives have a cause to ally against in Bush, and they are attempting to spread their message of change and hope to the America that didn't vote the last time. I can remember footage from previous conventions, and they were always places for political power plays. Its an interesting thing to see, and I hope they 'ride that donkey' until they achieve their goals. Frankly, I agree with them myself. Something which I have come to realize recently is that I affiliate with no political parties. I fit well into neither the Democratic nor Republican parties, nor with the slew of 'independants' that I have come across. I hold no titles, and I (will) vote accordingly. I will vote (when im legal) for whom best represents my goals and aspirations for the direction of the country. Great - now that's over with, on with my coverage of the DNC.  I found two speakers in particular impressing upon looking back on the convention. I remember vividly watching as Barack Obama gave a 'keynote' address. It was incredible to watch - he had absolute control over the crowd, and deserved every ounce of it. His oration, in which he promised not only to work bi-partisan, but to try to 'heal the wounds of a racially divided America' (easy, im paraphrasing), was stunning. After hearing it, I felt hopeful, and I felt positive towards Obama. Despite that being the goal of the speech, I still feel positive about what I heard. I'm fairly convinced that I have seen the very first black president in action.  The second speaker that suprised me was Dennis Kucinich. He gave a firey oration in which he attempted to pull progressives of all backgrounds together. I was truly impressed by his skill in speaking, and how much he could emote while doing so. While I don't think he would have had a snowball's chance in hell in winning a presidential election, I do believe he is an excellent liberal politician, and will continue to be. Even if he doesn't run for office again, I can see him sticking around as a rare form of polticial gadfly.  As for Kerry - I suppose that I am most happy that he is choosing to call Bush on his position of 'family values'. Frankly - the Bush administration loses me here as it does almost everywhere else. I don't think that The Shrub has a very wide concept of what a family is, and consequently few people that would benifit from 'family' programs have the right to do so. Not to mention his pro-family drug policies, his pro-family social program cutting, his pro-family tax cut. As you can tell, I am being facetious, but the hypocrisy gets old pretty quick.  I felt the Dems did a decent job of working themselves into gear, it will be interesting to see how Kerry and Edwards develop over the next couple of months. Anyway - I will write more later, with less political motives.

      Politics Recently I have been seeing more in the news concerning celebrities losing their jobs. While I normally don't have a problem with this (quite the opposite in many cases), this current round has me very worried. About a week ago at a fundraiser for John Kerry, Whoopi Goldberg gave a speech in which she used 'innapropriate language' to construct a sexual joke about President Bush. While I don't think that this says many good things about the quality of Goldberg's comedy in recent years, the response of Slim-Fast was far more appalling. Shortly after the fundraiser, Slim-Fast released this statement:   "The manner in which Ms Goldberg chose to express her personal beliefs at this event do not reflect the views and values of Slim-Fast Foods Company...We are disappointed by the manner in which Ms Goldberg chose to express herself and sincerely regret that her recent remarks offended you. Advertisements featuring Ms Goldberg will no longer be on air."   Now don't get me wrong, but doesn't it say in the Bill of Rights that people have every right to say exactly what they want, whenever they want to? While I do realize that the job of spokesperson is one which requires good relations with  everyone , I also cannot believe that it was simply the way in which Whoopi voiced her opinions that caused her to get canned. Slim-Fast knew that they were getting "that kind of humor" when they drew up her contract, but also Whoopi should have known the nature of her employers. She gave them all of the ammunition that they needed to justify getting rid of her. It's sad, but true. Then there is Linda Ronstadt, who after proclaiming Michael Moore a "great patriot" for creating 'Farentheit 911' was asked to leave the Aladdin Hotel where she was in concert. Despite making such dedications at all of her performances since the beginning of May, the Aladdin incident was the first to have sparked any sort of punitive action from the host. A statement released by the hotel shortly after the concert said that Ronstadt had been "Escorted from the Hotel" and that the performer would "not be welcomed back". Despite it being a song dedication, the Aladdin justifies its action by saying, "Ms. Ronstadt was hired to entertain the guests of the Aladdin, not to espouse political views."  These and similar incidents lead me to believe that free-speech is likely in as much peril as all of those other things on the Bill of Rights which we take for granted every day. This is certainly not the America which I began my life in.

       Politics   Heres a tool for all of you burgeoning politicos out there. The Annenberg Public Policy Center has put forth something that they dub the ' urlLink Annenberg Political Fact Check ', and from what I can tell their aim is to seperate the muck-raking from the actual substance in statements made by politicians. Here's what they have to say about it:    "We are a nonpartisan, nonprofit, "consumer advocate" for voters that aims to reduce the level of deception and confusion in   U.S.   politics. We monitor the factual accuracy of what is said by major   U.S.   political players in the form of TV ads, debates, speeches, interviews, and news releases. Our goal is to apply the best practices of both journalism and scholarship, and to increase public knowledge and understanding" -- Taken from 'About Us     They seem to be on the level, I highly recommend checking them out! Good debate fodder, if nothing more.     Movies   I watched  Le Femme Nikita  for the first time today. It was alright, but not quite what I expected from Luc Besson. Since my first exposure to him was through the most excellent movie 'The Fifth Element' I suppose that my dissapointment is somewhat understandable. It seemed quite a bit like 'The Professional' (another fantastic Besson movie), the stories were similar in content, and there was a substantial amount of grit in both films. My main objection to the film was the incredibly irritating lead character, whose insanity in the early segments of the film (while well-acted) just managed to foster within me very little pity.   Over all, it was a decent film. One of these days I will write up a comparison between it and its American counter-part,  Point of No Return .    Thats all for now.   urlLink

      Study of ancient relics and remnants of the past has always been an area of scientific interest for me. When I was younger I explored my interest in fossils and the remains of extinct civilizations, and much of my exploration defined my later interests in life. Gradually through fossils I became interested in anthropology, and I am now very intrigued by recent history, the Enlightenment and French Revolution periods especially.    As a history fanatic, I have come to realize that in many cases it tends to repeat itself over the course of generations -- I haven't seen much evidence of humans being able to learn from their own mistakes. With that in mind, I made a very disheartening discovery today as I mused on the state of various class systems throughout history. I began to compare our own current 'unofficial' class system in the United States with that of other countries worldwide, and I noticed that it is very similar to that of the French Government around 1789.    The Three Estate System, as it was called, consisted of three different classes; the Clergy, the Nobles, and the Lower Class 'Third Estate'. The Nobles and the Clergy controlled all of the political power in the country, and the Third Estate was heavily taxed despite its economic state. The Third Estate was further divided into three groups; the Bourgeoisie, the Workers, and the Peasants. The bourgeosie were made up of Artisans, Merchants, and Skilled Workers. Despite some being as wealthy as the Nobles, they were afforded no political rights. Well educated, they believed strongly in the ideas of the Enlightenment, and brought concepts of liberty and equality to the other parts of the Third Estate. Many were disenfranchised with the Old Regime in France, and believed that their wealth entitled them to greater political and social power within the government. It was members of this group who initially made the push for revolution during the Meeting of the Estates General.  The second class within the Third Estate I call the 'Urban Worker' class. Urban Workers generally consisted of cooks and servants, and were poorer than the bourgeoisie. Often out of work, these workers suffered extremely low wages when they did find jobs. As a result, when the cost of bread rose, mobs often formed and attacked carts of grain and bread to steal what they needed. They lacked any political power, and could not hope to graduate in class as they were often only poorly educated.  The lowest class within the Third Estate was the Peasant class. This class, made up of more than eighty percent of France's twenty-six million people, began to resent the nobles and the clergy. Having no political rights and very little education, peasants were unable to more beyond their class and often were the victims of famine and disease outbreaks due to poor sanitation. Despite making nearly nothing, peasants were heavily taxed on everything from grain to salt. Frustrated with their position, they began to look toward the government for change.    The United States, despite not having an 'official' class system is very much divided economically. Based on Wealth, Occupation, and political access, these classes resemble in many ways the Three Estate system of pre-revolution France. Our own class system is split up into five major categories; a firmly established Upper Class, an Upper-Middle Class, a rapidly decreasing middle class, a lower middle class, and a lower class.    The ingrained upper class consists of those who -- either through luck or through birth (or in some rare cases, skill) -- have come upon extreme wealth and been accepted into the upper-crust of wealthy society. Members of this class often maintain their wealth through social and political connections by obtaining coveted high-salary jobs within corporations. It is not uncommon for this status to be transmitted to the progeny of a member, and often they rely on each other to maintain their fortunes and power over generations. This class makes up a small fraction of the wealthiest 2% of Americans.    The next class is the Upper Middle class of professional workers. Despite being allowed access to the best educational institutions and wealth of the upper class, members of the upper middle class are rarely afforded the social advantages and corporate jobs given to the upper class. Generally, the middle class consists of educated workers such as Doctors or Architects, and can make anywhere between forty-thousand and two-hundred thousand dollars a year.    The unionized middle class, skilled only in one particular vocation, has long been thought to be disappearing. Corporate downsizing and other such events have forced many members of the middle class to pursue higher education and become members of the upper-middle class, and forced others into the lower class of basic service jobs.    The lower-middle 'working poor' obtain unskilled positions at service establishments such as Fast Food restaurants or Gas Stations. Plagued by varied hours and low pay, members of this class often experience repellent working conditions. Despite being materially wealthy on a worldwide standard, these workers have become marginalized members of American society.    The Lower class consists of impoverished and often-desperate individuals. Crime and hunger threaten them on a daily basis, and their conditions often make pursuing higher education impossible. Despite being the largest sector of Americans, they are the most marginalized in American society.    I believe that if looked at in terms of capitol, the French 'Old Regime' is very similar to America today. The upper two-percent of Americans control ninety-percent of the wealth in the country, and our most recent tax reform was a cut for the rich. The entrenched upper class has in general far more wealth than a member of the upper-middle class would reasonably conceive of attaining. Like the bourgeoisie, the upper-middle class lacks the political and social benefits of being a 'noble' member of the upper class. Meanwhile, anti-wealthy and socialist sentiments grow within the increasingly more impoverished middle and lower classes. Looking at all of this, and keeping in mind that the eve of the most divisive election in recent history rapidly approaches I cannot help but fear that perhaps revolution is brewing in America, and has been for quite some time.

       Iraq   It has been over a month and a half since the June handover of sovereignty in Iraq, and since then, the country has seen a huge increase in violent events. Both the US Military and internal Iraqi Security Forces have withdrawn from Falluja, Insurgents now largely control the two cities of Ramadi and Samarra, and both sides continue the fight in Mosul.   Not only has Iraq faced internal revolution issues recently, but the cloud of scandal has once again gone up regarding the treatment of detainees. However, this time - instead of American soldiers being to blame - it seems that the Iraqi government itself faces its first allegations of human rights violations. On June 29th, the first day after the magical transition of power, Oregon Nation Guard members came to the assistance of prisoners after witnessing them being beaten by Iraqi officials. After securing the area, soldiers discovered impliments of torture ranging from rubber hose to electrified wire in a nearby building. Upon referring to their superiors, the soldiers were stunned as they were told to relinquish control of the prisoners to their Iraqi captors, and to immediately withdraw from the area.   In handing over power to Iraq, the United States has stepped into a catch-22 of its own design. It must respect Iraqi sovereignty or risk legitimacy problems in the future, but at the same time help protect the freedoms which were granted to the Iraqi people by their new constitution (which includes protection from: "torture in all its forms, physical or mental," and "cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment."). By stopping injustices such as this, the United States would be viewed by the Iraqi government as oppressive or insensitive to their needs. By not stopping such actions, a myriad of other problems would arise. Things such as morale, world opinion, and (more importantly) American public opinion would greatly suffer.    However, there are some that say this dilemma could have been almost entirely prevented had more action been taken during the 'combat phase' of the war to secure the country and lock it down. Such an action could have helped prevent insurgents from operating before they became such a problem. By not giving the Iraqi government a stable foundation on which to work, we have possibly sabotaged both ours and their chance at creating a new republic of Iraq with as little pain as possible.
