      Today we walked in the woods. Eden was so tired by the end. I'm not very good at going in the right direction. I guess that applies to a lot of things.

      This is the first day of the whisper. It may be brief it may be endless, but it has to go somewhere.

      My Mother's garden has a certain unkempt Autumn charm about it this morning. Fallen leaves create a sort of colorful uniformity to the whole. As the sun rises above the fence, behind the big tree (I've no idea what kind), the yellow and browning leaves turn to gold, some alchemical trick of nature.   What is the truth in that?  That there is some fundamental light/energy in the universe that causes us to transcend our normal bodies and become someting else?  As I am home alone right now, silence pervades. The sound of my voice when I cough or exclaim at some mundane domestic atrocity (spilling water from the water jug, sneezing too loudly) is brash and unconnected with the moment. I have come to accept that I write and think in a voice different to that with which I speak, mostly.   I have begun work on a new musical project. Two actually. The first is a ballet that my brother wants comissioned: Jekyll and Hyde.  I have thought up a few themes to be developed into longer pieces. I suppose at some point I will have to write these ideas down on paper, but..we'll see.  The second is a musical theater adaptation of The Tales of Hoffman. It is a story about the struggle to find truth in the face of a world of lies. I am worried that it is too colossal a project, but again...we'll see.

      Damn it. I'm not supposed to feel this. Not ever again. I'm not supposed to feel this stomach churning spiral into emotion. I feel as though I'm on top of some mountain and he's swinging off the edge by some invisible soul rope attached to my goddamn stomach. It's painful saying goodbye to him. It's painful thinking about how easy it would be to fall into him. And I like it. I love it. And I never ever want it to stop. Ever. Because it means something very important. It means I'm alive. It means I've been dead and it's time to wake up and roll back the stone and say, Damn it, I  am  the son of God! My life is one huge steaming heap of fertile moist potentiality. And I'm so scared of using it. But I think I might. I think I might.  Still, it really tears my heart out to say goodbye. But I've had to do it before. I say goodbye to my old life a thousand times a day.  Everytime I walk away from my sons' house and go somewhere without them, I say goodbye. Everytime I see Lora and know that I hurt her, I say goodbye. Everytime I see a map of England and think about where on it my Dad is I say goodbye. I say goodbye everyday.  Which of course means I haven't said goodbye at all.

      Met a boy. Met a Jack. A special Jack.  Do you know why it's called Kije's Dream? Because it's the dream of someone who isnt real. If real people dream of unreal things in their subconscious, don't unreal people dream the real?  I have a picture of what my life looks like. It's this huge set of scales....thousands of scales balancing each other out. Always in constant motion, to and fro, to and fro. But sometimes, the motion stops and everything is balanced. That perfect moment of poise and beauty is what I aspire to. Except aspiring is the worst thing to do. And so the scales tip.  Met a Jack.

      My parents are out of town(England actually)so, it's just me and the gerbils. I am beginning to make a worrisome discovery: I don't do well on my own. All those negative traits I have are just seeping out, because, well, there's no one here to see them. It's just so quiet here that I can hear myself think. So quiet that I start to tiptoe around just to avoid making noise. And I really wish someone were here. Someone besides me. I think I might be lonely, which I knew, but now that I'm actually on my own it comes into focus so much more. And I don't particularly like it.

      Life is immeasurable.  I was thinking about the term "astronomical unit". It's the distance from Earth to the Sun, about 94 million miles, and thus it is used to measure distances in space.  Distances. In. Space. But it's an arbitrary measurement. We just decide that thats a good distance to use, because it's what's familiar to us. But this measurement depends on two objects taking up a place in space.  Here and  there. And the thing is, if there isn't a here, there can't be a there. Interconnectedness.  Indra's Net. Entanglement. Entanglement means that, at a quantum level, sometimes atomic and sub-atomic particles get somehow connected. And from that point on, whatever happens to one, affects the other.  Isn't life like that? Everything relies on everything else, and if we're blind to that, we run the risk of thinking we're in control. And we're not.

      The thing of it is, I'm scared to go back to school. I don't think I can do it. I'm scared of letting more people down by failing at something else. But what else is there? I always hate being the last to do things, and I feel like I'm in competition with others who've gone before. Am i scared of someone pointing out a lack of genius? Yes. Do I doubt myself? Yes. But what if this is the only way?  The Lion brings doubt.  And doubt brings change. And Change is the only Way.

      Ever listen to some really good Philip Glass? I dont mean like Anima Mundi, though it has its place. I mean like the Hours soundtrack. I'm listening right now, and what gets you is the repeated lilting driving rhythym underneath. Thats what it's all about, because, after a while, you lose track of where you were in the music, and it suddenly becomes a series of singular events entering your brain. Ever have moments like that? Where everything ceases to be mushed together, and all the parts come apart and can be seen in crystalline perfection? And of course, once that happens, the true unity is revealed. And it's never what we thought it was. Its not really the sparkling river water rolling over the rocks as the goose descends. Its the light the water the movement the rock the bird the wings the air the change in position in the air.  Its always so much more.

      It's raining. Water falling from the sky. Does this strike anyone else as being a tad bit odd? Great gobs of liquid that get sucked up into the sky, play around for a bit, and then remember where they belong.  I wonder if a raindrop's journey is like coming home. Mother Earth.

      And this is life, I suppose. I feel as though I keep driving around, or moving from room to room, expecting to see my self coming the other way.  "There you are!" I'll say. "I've been looking for you!" Looking for me. There are days that I feel like such a little person. There are days that I feel like a giant. Which is best? Alice couldnt decide, so is there any hope for me? Taylor. Taylor was fun, but after tonight (and the phone call from his mother, asking where he was, and with whom), I don't think we'll be talking very much.  Still, there's always the river. "Ever get the feeling that the river knows what it's doing?" There's always the river.

      So there's this little sliver of light. Teeny. And it's at the end of this really, really long and dark tunnel that winds its way up a mountain. And I'm wearing rollerskates. But this little sliver is the brightest thing in my universe, and I have a feeling that I'm supposed to get to it. And I'm wearing rollerskates.   Obviously, I'm being metaphorical here. But if I come right out and say what I think, let alone what I feel or want, that sliver of light might just die. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some skating to do.

      Just when I think life cant sink any lower.... So, I'm directing Robin Hood, and the kids are great. They really are.  But I just look at them and think back to when I was in high school. And I want to scream at them... "Look! Pay attention! Don't let this go, because soon it'll be lost , and all you'll have left is your mistakes!" But I don't. I'm really kind of glad I didnt move into a new house...because it doesnt seem like I'm coping too well with living on my own.  Let's talk about Neener. She's turning out to be like, the greatest mom ever, while I just sink into Shmuckhood.She really does deserve someone as great as her, and I'm sure she'll find someone. She's such a huge person, and I feel like a mite beside her. I wish I could fix the mistakes.

      My Lora is beautiful. She got her haircut today and it is absolutely perfect. Then she died it back dark and then it was perfecter.  I was remembering the way that she used to look at me, as if she was excited to see that I was there, everytime she saw me. I was remembering the way she used to press herself to me; make herself so little and me so big I was remembering the way her long long hair moved.  And I thought "I will walk through hell and back to get there again. I will give up everything and burn myself away, just to see that girl again."
