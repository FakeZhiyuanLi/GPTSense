      I start saying this words two days ago..when my day begin lil bit overload. And those words really made my day, increasing my motivation facing more brighter day. As usual, works for me means doing routine but still with high volatility..(confuse?..routine means doing the same work everyday. For me it means, reporting almost the same business news in town. Volatile for me means, find more tidal circumstances in town..sometimes go slow..but sometimes go fast).  Routine always boring and volatile sounds challenging..i'd rather face the second one actually, but i have to admitt that sometimes i do grumbling about this condition to my friends.. But two days ago, my brain recall this words from my memories..and allow me to think about this word again. I can do It ..i exclaimed it to myself.. "just take it easy, do everything one step at the time and allow yourself become a problem solver. If everyone around u able to finish each problem well, then u can do better than them" And now, nothing seems impossible for me..no matter how huge my problem is, i convince myself that i'm  able to solve it..and today will be brighter than yesterday, tommorow will be brighter than today :)

      I feel very lucky to have lots of friends who always wake me up, when I’m about to give up..Thanks to Irfan with this story. Pygmalion Pygmalion is a youngman who talented in art sculpture. He’s really proficient in carving sculpture He’s handcarving is really remarkable. But not by his talent, he conceded and loved by friends and neighbors. Pygmalion known as a positive thinker. He always consider everything in positive angle. When the city square become wet and muddy, and all people grumbling. Pygmalion said, “Thank God the other field is not as wet as this field” When a sculpter buyer looked persistent in bargaining price, and Pygmalion friends whispering,” how stingy that person is,” Pygmalion said,”Perhaps that person still need to spend the money on something more important,” When kids stole apples at his yards, Pygmalion never complaining. He feel sorry to see those kids and said,”Poor children, they don’t get proper education and food at home,” That’s Pygmalion  sight. He never see any circumstances in bad side, but on the good side. He never think bad about others;in the contrary, he try to imagine some good side from people's bad manners. One day, Pygmalion carve a women sculpture from wood. His hand carving is really smooth and soft. That sculpture size is equal to the human size. The face of the sculpture is really charming and has a magnificent smile. The sculpture body looked very impressive. Pygmalion friends said, “It’s just a sculpture, no matter how wonderful that thing is, it’s never be your wife,” Many times Pygmalion looked deep at the statue, and rub its surface, treat it like a real lady. God and Goddess of the Olympus watch him, and really appreciate what Pygmalion done for the statue, and they decided to grant him remarkable gift. They transform the statue into a real lady..that’s the end of the story..Pygmalion live happily ever after with the most lovely women in the whole land. Now, Pygmalion remembered to describe the effect of positive thinking pattern. Whe we think positively about one circumstances or someone, the result really positive. For instance, When we try to be friendly to someone, then that person will be friendly too. When we treat our children as smart kids, they will become smart kids at the end. If we believe we’ll be succeed, bigger possibility that the effort is half way of success The effect of this positive thinking, called Pygmalion effect. Our mind sometimes have fulfilling prophecy effects, both positive or negative. If we want to consider our neighbor as shabby person, so we never want to socialize with him/her, so at the end..they will become a shabby person to you. If we suspicious to our children, at the end they will really dishonest to us. If we  gave up on something and think that we never able start an effort, bigger chance for us to face real failure. Pygmalion thinking pattern, is to think, expect and hope only good things about conditions or people. Imagine how big the effect is, if we thought in positive way like that. We’ve never come into prejudice on others. We’ll never gossiping bad stories of others..and we never expect anything bad about others. If have bad thinking on others, we always find a reason to guess something bad about them. If someone give us a present, obviously it’s a good deed. Bad if we think in bad way, we’ll become suspicious.”Perhaps he/she try to bribe” or may be we come to grumbling side “aahhh cheap ones…”  Who get the disadvantage of this negative thoughts is ourself. We come easily suspicious, and can’t be happy                                                                  In the contrary, if think in positive ways, we get easily enjoy the present and joyful with the gift, “ohh our neighbor is a generous person, though busy as a bee, still remember giving such nice present to us,”.. The color of life, perhaps depend on the spectacle we wear. If we wear some grey one, everything will looked grey. Life will be grey and blurred. But if we wear the bright one, everything will looked clear. Spectacle which full of prejudice or hate, will only lead is to suspicious, envy, hatred life. But the peace one, make our life bright and comfy. Life will be perfect if we see it in a good side. Think positive about ourself Think positive about others Think positive in any circumstances Think positive of God (God will grant us everything as you expect from him) The effect of positive thinkin we’ll realized soon. Warm family Trusted friends Friendly Neighbor Works seems fun World seems friendly Life seems lovely Just like Pygmalion…that’s it Have a great life, everyone :) Gee...my english still bad...need lots of help

      These are good advice from a friend, i like each word he expressed..Perhaps..my writing isn't perfect but his words are 1.To My Friends Who Are...........SINGLE Love is like a butterfly . The more you chase it , the more it eludes you. But if you just let it fly, it will come to you when you least expect it. Love can make you happy but often it hurts , but love's only special when you give it to someone who is really worth it. So take your time and choose the best.  2.To My Friends Who Are............NOT SO SINGLE Love isn't about becoming somebody else's "perfect person." It's about finding someone who helps you become the best person you can be. 3.To My Friends Who Are.............PLAYBOY/GIRL TYPE Never say "I love you" if you don't care. Never talk about feelings if they aren't there. Never touch a life if you mean to break a heart . Never look in the eye when all you do is lie. The cruelest thing a guy can do to a girl is to let her fall in love when he doesn't intend to catch her fall and it works both ways...  4.To My Friends Who Are............MARRIED Love is not about "it's your fault", but "I'm sorry." Not "where are you", but "I'm right here." Not "how could you", but "I understand." Not "I wish you were", but "I'm thankful you are."  5.To My Friends Who Are............ENGAGED The true measure of compatibility is not the years spent together but how good you are for each other.  6.To My Friends Who Are............HEARTBROKEN Heartbreaks last as long as you want and cut as deep as you allow them to go. The challenge is not how to survive heartbreaks but to learn from them .  7.To My Friends Who Are............NAIVE How to be in love: Fall but don't stumble, be consistent but not too persistent, share and never be unfair, understand and try not to demand, and get hurt but never keep the pain.  8.To My Friends Who Are............POSSESSIVE It breaks your heart to see the one you love happy with someone else but it's more painful to know that the one you love is unhappy with you.  9.To My Friends Who Are............AFRAID TO CONFESS Love hurts when you break up with someone. It hurts even more when someone breaks up with you. But love hurts the most when the person you love has no idea how you feel.  10.To My Friends Who Are............STILL HOLDING ON A sad thing about life is when you meet someone and fall in love, only to find out in the end that it was never meant to be and that you have wasted years on someone who wasn't worth it. If he isn't worth it now he's not going to be worth it a year or 10 years from now. Let go.....  11.TO ALL MY FRIENDS....... My wish for you is a man/women whose love is honest, strong, mature , never-changing, uplifting, protective, encouraging, rewarding and unselfish

      I wanna share a story about elevator in my office. since it's not a big office, so there's only one lift here. But, this lift already took lots of victim who get trapped in that lift..from common employee, office CEO, stakeholder, former Indonesia president Gus Dur, and last night Krisdayanti.... We call that lift as a wingit lift..wingit means lil bit spooky. The funny thing is, most employee never want to use that lift, we prefer use stairs, so the exclusivism of that lift begin more and more obviuos. Only special guests use it...and more special the guest is..the lift more eager to trap those people in... :))  Perhaps, it's the way wingit lift want to demonstrate its loneliness..never being used properly and daily by all people..and perhaps, it gets bored to serve those special guests..:p so Wingit lift wants to scare them :D hahhahahah that's my story about this wingit lift...and...i never use that lift since i work here.     ind

      Why fresair, it's just perfectly all people need..and what i need to change something inside my head :) Freshair to breathe….to fill this brain again with pure oxygen and make it work properly A friend of mine, told me why u don’t try to write diary or something similar with it..but I always say, I never try to share my feelings to others, if they see me smile then it means I’m happy but when I begin more quite it means, I don’t wanna talk about it. And it seems to be enough for me..for all this years.  But after I read her posting today, I begin to think..perhaps there’s something wrong inside of me that I should change, now here I am writing something. Pak-I, thanks for introducing me to this blogger..

      Month of August, should be have special meaning to our people. Though the respons isn’t quite the same like the celebration fourth of July. But I always notice something special about this month, yeaa make my love upon this nation grow even bigger. Albeit many people mocking or insulting this country failure holding up their image, in front of its own people. Either when all nations questioning our ability to recover, my love to this nation is raise greater. Don’t bother to deny that this country indeed have major problems in all cases. Merely when we found the spirit of it’s people struggle for better life, my love heave up to the higher level. One thing for sure that make me love this country is the people I’ve seen and lived with. I was amazed and still, every time I saw Mrs Karta her husband and their only grandchild carry more than 50 kg bananas and cassava on their each back, few hours before dawn to the traditional market which only 8 km away from their home. The fall of wet dew and soft cold breeze become their closest friend, to begin their day. I know this family better, cause sometimes Mr Karta give a big help at my place dealing with all unwanted grass at the yard. In his nearly 80s, work isn’t a burden. In fact, he thought his muscle will start aching if he stays at home n doing nothing. Same quote I found from mrs Karta’s too. Though I believe their income from selling bananas and cassava ain’t enough to provide good meal for the entire family. But I hardly found them grumbling about this condition, in fact they always remind me about being “nrima ing pandum”. Which means accept each role that God given to them without complaining. They believe that God already create a big plan in their life, so they just fit in with it and do the best to adjust with it. Adjust means, stay humble and do better their role in this life .  This two old couple give me a clear vision, that our people ain’t lazy or obstinate as others said. Sadly, sometimes our own people concur with this hilarious idea, and also pointing their finger at their own brothers. Sounds pathetic but it happen, while I’d rather see everything that happen on this country in a clear and bright spectacle. To watch single tiny effort from everybody around me try to fit in their role in life, indeed make me more in love with this people. I hardly found any despair in their eyes, I only found stream of wet sweat falling from their forehead and their hands. They only offer something positive, hope that they’re doing the best that they could. How can I not be fall in love to this people? I would become a foolish if I dare to underestimate my own people who encourage me everyday to play to best role in life. In this August, I try to remind you, that we’ll never able to manipulate our identity as a mighty and sedulous Indonesian. I proudly said, that I’m 100% indonesian, 25% javanesse, 25% aceh+malay, 25% borneo’s dayak, 25% non-native immigrant from arab. That will be a great reason why i couldn't get easily drawn into ethnocentrism. And my biggest intention is to meet each of my brother out there, to show how proud and lucky I am to have their blood in me. As well as I will try the best to make them proud for sharing their blood in me 

      This afternoon a friend of mine remind me again about the different between rose and jasmine. She told me, rose performance always stunning, every single eyes ardent to touch when they start blooming. That’s common, since their color is really gorgeous and sweet. But one thing, which sometime we got easily slipped while looking their exquisite color, right after we take a good look at them and sense them within the breeze. Scent of rose doesn’t spread as vast as the scent of jasmine, though we find one tiny jasmine about to bloom, we easily sense the scent of it. One tiny jasmine could make roomy space specific fragrance which we could easily notice. Sometime I thought, how we could be like jasmine, flourished entire space only with our tiny appearance. Sounds nice if we could give a meaning to any environment with a delightful fragrance, and they don’t have to touch us or stunned with our outside appearance. They just know our presence but don’t have to say something good about anything that we’ve done. See, doing something good but never care about compliments or any flattering statements from other. Sometimes, compliments only weakening and bring us nowhere than keep satisfied about what we have done. It’s hard to stood back when we’re still floating on the air and feel contented with it, joyous a lot with good stuff we’ve done and forget that every achievement means a challenge to double it twice, three times or more.

      I remember what James Gwee said about few characteristic of a ditherer, and I couldn’t deny that some of those could easily found in me. Worries a lot, unsure and afraid in all circumstances, always imagine the worst and trying the best that I could to avoid failure. Always thought that life is all about reducing uncertainty as much as I could. Hence, with this characteristic he put me on a ditherer  side. But some of his words is not quite fit in me, something like thoughts that never satisfied, seldom happy and always complaining. Those later characteristic rather hard to find in me, since I’m kind an easy going person, always put smile on my face, and hide all problems deep inside so no one can sense it. So, what am I know? Still a ditherer, or what?..actually I don’t care too much about this, but there is one of his note that make me curious, he said ditherer always see the ground as the safest place..and ditherer favorite color is brown. It lil bit shocked me up, since I do think that way. I thought the ground is the safest place but I don’t scare of heights either. And one thing for sure is, I really like brown color in all cases. My outfit mostly in brown, stationary, fancy stuffs, everything dominated with brown. But did the color really imply who we really are? I never expect to be a ditherer, I’d rather become someone who has positive thinkin on everything like Pygmalion. Left the words “what if…” behind and drop all worries away. Would it be a mistake if we try to seek more security? I mean, that will be great if our plans work out well and get the best achievement by reducing any tiny obstacle that might occur in our way. It’s just my thought, or perhaps I’m really a ditherer inside and outside so it flows all over my blood…:)

      One day, this woman come home from her work and saw three old men with long beard were sitting in front of her nice and cozy yard. She doesn’t know who they are, and asking “I don’t know any one of you, but I’m certain that you might be sturfing right now. So, lets go inside I’ll cook something for you,”. But one of the old men ask back,” is your husband at home ?”. She replies ,”No, not yet, he still out for work,”.  The three old men said again,” Then we’ll wait until you husband gets home,” they said that in peaceful smile. In the evening, the whole family gathering again in that house, and the lady told her husband about the three wise old men outside their yard. For a moment, the husband little bit confuse about the story, and then told his wife to call the three old men outside, to come in. Hence, the lady go ask the three old men to come in, but instantly they reply,” we can’t go inside together, you have to choose one of us, one by one to invite us in,”. The lady look with astonishment, then ask,”Why..?,” One of three old men explain to her,” His name is fortune, and the man who sits beside him is success, and my name is  compassion. That’s why you should choose which one of us, who should enter you house first. Go ask your husband, who he need to invite from us most,”. The lady leave again to tell her husband about this uncommon circumstances, and again the husband feel amaze.”Wow, this is unbelievable, I’d rather invite fortune, so he can fill this house full of fortune my dear..,” the husband said. But his wife refuse this idea, and told him that she’d rather invite Mr, Success to come in first,”We need success in our farm harvest, why don’t we invite Mr Success first?,”.   But in coincident, their dearest children  heard about this argument and said,”That will be great if we invite Mr Compassion to come inside. Our house will feel more cozy and warm with compassion,”. Then the parents agreed with their beloved children’s  idea, and decide to invite Mr Compassion in. The lady go outside again to ask a men named compassion to come in, then Mr Compassion stood up, walk to the house. Suddenly, the two other men, also rise up and walk along behind Mr Compassion. Feel curios about this action, the lady ask again,”I only invite compassion, but why fortune and success also come along?,”.  Those two men answering in the same time,” If you just invite fortune or success to go inside, you will only have one of them, and the rest of us will stay outside. But, since you invite compassion, in whatever place he goes, we will walk behind him. You should know, that both of fortune and success were blind, only compassion who can see. Only compassion who can lead us to, the right path of life, and good deeds. Therefore, we need his guidance when we walk and running this life,”. Said Fortune and Success in the same voice.    No matter how huge our intention is, but never leave the essence of our life, compassion, love, and care for other

      Love is like butterfly..the more you chase it..the more it will elude you. But if you just let it fly, it will come to you when you least expect it. Nice quote right....?? I guess so, but sometimes really confusing when we accidently feel certain chemistry reaction on someone..but the other person we least expect make an approach. That's different circumstances, but lil bit related too.. See..everything don't exactly go the way we wished to be. Perhaps, letting it fly would be better. So i can lose it forever or it will come to me when i least expect it..sounds pathetic :(
