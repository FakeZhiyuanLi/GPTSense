      This is where it begins for me. I saw Jump, Little Children for the first time in October of 1995. And I became obsessed. In the psychological manic depressive sense of the word. And I dropped out of school and moved to the Atlantic coast and everything. This was a capital O Obsession. And it was mostly because of this album.   And what can I say about this album? I do happen to know it pretty well. From Jay Clifford's sexy voice to Ward Williams' now missing falsetto. The blend of pop and folk caught me square in the chest. And they had a cello! And I just happened to have had a crush on the head cello player in my youth symphony. it was a melding of a lot of things. But this is a pretty good record. Rough in some places, and early, but you can tell that there's talent here and if not anything new, than at least a fresh look at some things that don't totally suck. A lot of energy.   Now that I'm listening to the album again, for the first time in a good while I hear different things. I actually like different things. I prefer the melancholy wistfulness of "Matchbox Whistler" to the sunny danceableness (?) of "Smiling Down." Will the older and wiser Jenny still fall for the emotional pandering that is "Quiet"? It's a great song, but not unsimilar to your "Meet Virginia" and your basic Ellis Paul anything. Though, I still believe that "Quiet" has the greatest cello solo in all of popular music. There I've said it.   An interesting thing is happening as I'm relistening to the album. I'm bored with it. In my musical odyssey, I learned a lot about what goes into an album, and I realized I am girl who loves production quality. And this album has very little of it. The sound starts about three feet behind the front of your speaker and just sounds kind of weak. As opposed to the lush, big room sound of your Daniel Lanois for instance. Which means that this album gets by on it's merits, not production quality, but it just makes me think of what this album would have been with a budget. But alternate realities are another blog.   But I still do fall for the emotional pandering of "quiet," in case you wondered.  (By emotional pandering, I mean, songs that make you feel special cause you're just like the girl in the song, until you realize that your mortal nemesis feels the same way about the song, and you could not be less like her, and so now, whenever you hear the formerly special song, you just feel cheap and tawdry. But maybe I'm investing too much into that.)  And what does my darling daughter think of this the album that changed my life? She's fallen asleep. Sigh.

      A few years ago, I was a music writer. And obsessed with music and musicians in general. And then I got married and had a baby and had less and less time for music as I was now having a real life. Then I discovered blogging and remembered my wish for an album review site, and voila! A way to rekindle my love of music and music writing and everything! So here we are.   I'm going to start slow with albums I love and have on hand and branch out from there. We may get in to stuff I hate. We may get in to stuff YOU like. Or we may get in to stuff my husband likes, as, we have that on hand, too. But we also have a really great cd store here right in town, so we'll see what kinds of trouble we can get into. Fun!!

      Okay, first I should mention that Lily has not slept in her crib since that post. Well, we got her to sleep in her crib on her stomach and that's a big nono, so it's been back to the bed with us. Which really cuts down on that sleep deprivation that you hear about. It's just wake up, plug baby in, go back to sleep. So I am like the most well rested new mother in the history of the world. Except for maybe Catherine Zeta Jones. I'm going back to work tomorrow. I'm a little nervous about that, but it'll be good to get out and see my coworkers again. I've missed them. I got out last week and went to the meetup.com sponsored knitting event and that was fun. I learned another vital step in the knitting process (thank you Lou) and I'm well on my way to christmas presents for everybody. If you're at all interested in knitting, you abslutely MUST go out and buy Debbie Stoller's Stitch and Bitch. It's loads of fun. And if you're at all crafty minded, you MUST check out craftster.org. It's a great resource for people who like to make sumthin out of nothin. You know who you are. Well, my breasts are leaking (more about that LATER) so I better try and go feed this still beautiful baby. Thanks.

      Today was my first day as a stay at home Mom and it involved a lot of breastfeeding and daytime talk shows. I haven't broken in to soaps just yet. But I suppose it's only a matter of time. Lily still hasn't learned to sleep in the crib, so it's basically on Mom or nothing, as far as naps are concerned. And I should probably mention that when she's not eating she's napping. (Except for maybe an hour or two of just alert time every day) That's question number one for the doctor in the morning. Don't worry, she's too young for immunizations so the doctor visits aren't difficult for the parents just yet. I even got a couple minutes aside to give love to our woefully neglected cats (Bert and Hero). And I did the dishes. That's literally all I did today. Jeremy (who had the good instincts to call, like, three times while he was out) was less than impressed with this, but he tried to be understanding.

      So, thirteen days ago I gave birth. And since then I have lost complete track of time. And I haven;t accomplished anything beyond seeing to the baby's immediate needs. Seriously, I took a shower every other day this week and felt really good about that. Wow, this blog is too personal already. But Lily the most beautiful baby in the world is doing fine. We're trying to teach her to sleep in her crib instead of in the bed with us (which is nice, but a little scary), and right now she's alseep in her crib! This may not seem like a huge accomplishment, but it feels like one. And I am on my way to a well deserved (and much needed) shower. But my hopes for this blog is that it will eventually become something more directed and I can discuss motherhood, marriage and crafting. Things that I'm learning about. And things you might like to hear about. We'll see what happens.

      First of all, I hate talking about my dreams. I find it this totally masturbatory exercise, AND it's bad storytelling to boot. And, let's face it, no one really cares what's happening in your subconscious. This is my pet peeve. Well, one of a few. That being said, I have this recurring dream. I'm running, but not getting anywhere. I'm running and running and running and it's like I'm in slow motion. Having the said dream pet peeve, I'm not much in to the meanings of dreams, but I've never had a recurring dream image like this. I suppose it has something to do with the frustrations of new parenthood and all the adult things I'm facing lately. I just thought I'd mention this as a way to get out of the baby poop and breast milk direction that this blog has taken so far.   I got the main color of my yarn for the bag I am making. It's a bright orange by brown sheep. it's a beautiful wool mohair blend and the yarn is shiny. I adore it. As soon as they get the rest of the yarn in at the shop I'm going to pick out a contrasting color for the stitching and the pocket. I'm taking suggestions for something to go with bright orange.   I'm also working on a ball of yarn made from cut up grocery bags. In the new issue of ready made magazine they make a quilted fabric out of folded up grocery bags and make it into a handbag and a messenger bag, so now I'm obsessed with making something out of plastic grocery bags. if you know where to find plastic grocery bags in colors other than white and walmart, I'm taking grocery bag donations. Eventually, I'll try to knit something up with my grocery bag "yarn," but I'm just building up a stash of it right now.   Lily smiled at me yesterday for the first time. Totally amazing. I almost cried. It lasted like two seconds and is among the top five moments in my life.   Friday was my first day at the needlework shop. I had SO much fun. I really like my coworkers and my boss and the perks are awesome. An added bonus is that I am not typing all day, so when I get home I actually feel like writing something, be it emails or something more creative. Which makes me happy. But I'm still going back to the bookstore next wednesday.   Grandpa Eisenberg is a big hit with Lily. He's visiting for the weekend and we've had a good time.   Tomorrow we're going to try the drive in thing with Lily. Jeremy's not excited about it, but I think it could be fun. It could also suck big time, but I'm willing to risk it, as I don't get out much.

      Happy Mother's Day to me. The good news about the colic is that it might not have the caffeine that mommy was ingesting that made Lily so irritable. So I'm going to give the caffeine a try again and see what happens. Worse case scenario is we have another evening of miserable baby and hey, we have that anyway. Tonight we're going to try and go to the drive in to see the weekly bad movie double feature (this week: the road warrior and soylent green) and hope that Lily behaves. If she doesn't, we'll just sit in the car and who can she bother? I may be too optimistic about taking the baby out for stuff. I'm still having trouble making a second fireworks scarf. I just can't get the color scheme right. But as soon as I have that figured out, I'm going to start on zeeby's bag from snb. Very exciting to me. And I'm still embroidering, too. Mostly over Lily's head while she sits on my lap, but hey, it gets it done. I had my first day at nease's needlework on friday and I'm very excited about working there. I may never make any money, but it does support my yarn habit. I'm also going to try and start back at the bookstore this week, and I really mean it this time.

      Alright, still no crib sleeping goodness, but enough about THAT subject for now. I took Lily with me for my most recent crafty excursion. Sunday afternoon I met Mary for some knitting at a local ice cream parlor. I didn't get much knitting done, but I'm kind of between projects anyway. My new obsession is embroidery. I'm hoping to get an embroidery supplies binge for a mother's day present. Yay! Another holiday I am now eligible for!! For embroidery, sublimestitching.com is the best! But I'm also going to do some "straight" designs for people for yet still more homemade christmas gifts. I am SO broke. The baby is having something like colic and it's horrible. She;s inexplicably miserable for a couple hours at a stretch and I don't know what's wrong or how to fix it. It's not a good feeling. But after a couple of hours, she's okay again and everything is fine. Anybody has any recommendations, I'm game. I'm going to try giving up dairy and see if that helps. I'm already limiting my caffeine intake. Maybe I need to give up caffeine altogether. (shudder) Other than this minor thing, all is well. Sort of. Also, today we found out that Jeremy didn't get accepted anywhere for graduate school, which saddened my husband a good deal. But he'll try again next year and we'll see what happens. In the mean time, we're planning to stay here, but also applying to some other jobs, just for fun. I did NOT make it to work last week like I planned, but I do start my new job at the needlework shop this friday. Yay!

      A lot of heavy stuff going on in the world lately, but I feel like being frivolous. So here goes...  So I'm taking stock of my life lately and seeing what it all adds up to. Breastfeeding, check. Breastfeeding in public places and in front of every male in my family, check. Obsession with knitting in particular and handmaking things in general, check. No makeup and not even a bra unless I'm going somewhere, check. Apparently, I have some granola tendencies. Was I always like this? I guess so. It's just more pronounced now. So I'm trying to punk up my life a little. Show that I still know from style and am more than just your average stay at home mom. But what can I do? Pink dye would only cover up the grey hairs of which I am inexplicably proud. A tattoo is an awfully big step. And for that matter, a tattoo of what? If only they had polls on blogger... Well, I'm taking submissions. My favorite idea is just to get a tattoo of the word "tattoo." Wanna see my tattoo? You get the joke. *I* think it's a funny one. Anyway... yes, I understand what a unique snowflake slash space monkey I am. I just want to tweak my image a little. I just don't know where to start. It's weird. I'm happier than I've ever been. I love my husband. I have a beautiful, happy baby who is (thank you, Jesus) healthy. And she sleeps through the night, too. I just figure... I went through 22 hours of labor AND a c-section and have embraced the resulting adult lifestyle that the aftermath required. I just want a physical outward sign that says I acknowledge all that, and I'm not dead yet, either.   And smoking is out. it's been almost a year since my last cigarette. I can no longer take the guilt with the littering, the harm it causes my body, as another person now depends on it for transportation, hygeine and food. Not to mention the smell on my clothes. And my knitting. Yuck! Stinky knitting. Good thing I quit when I did. But I SO miss it. Like I miss sleeping in positions that deny Lily immediate access to my boobs. There are just things I can not do anymore. So I want to explore those routes that are still open to me. Speaking of that, if you can't donate blood after you get a tattoo, what's the rule on breastfeeding and tattoos? There's a question for the La Leche League. tattoos are probably out. I guess part of being an adult is just learning that it might just be enough for me to be me. As soon as I find out where they sell the pink hair dye near my house.

      My new project.  I'm obsessed with knitting. More about obsessions in general, at a later date. But currently, knitting is my thing. I hang out with knittiers, I knit at work when I can and I talk about knitting. to my husband, who know nothing about knitting and several other non knitting friends. I'm considering joining the knitting guild so I can enroll in their master knitter program. Say Master Knitter a couple times. It's fun. So, yeah. Knitting. But tonight, I think I may have gone too far. Tonight, I started plotting out my very own knitting murder mystery. It's a natural extension for me. I have this huge background in books and I love murder mysteries. My parents write murder mysteries and murder mysteries routinely take place inside a small community, not unlike the local knitting community. And they (not my parents) write murder mysteries about freaking talking corgis, so why the eff not a murder mystery with knitting. (And NO, no one will be stabbed with knitting needles) if anyone thinks of a good title, I'm open to suggestion. I know there's one out there, I'm just not there yet. Anyway, it's my first book and Tuesday night I'm going to a writing group with my new friend Mary, so I'm glad that I now have a project to discuss.   In other knitting news, I reached and passed the halfway point on my baby blanket, which is cool. it's all downhill from here. Did I mention that I'm not buying any more yarn until I finish my two prjects I've got going now? I really mean it. And I'm taking orders for knitted goods for Christmas. Anyone who wants a Harry Potter scarf (in your choice of house colors) should speak now. And I've sorted out my next four or so projects. Which I will not ennumerate and describe here, because I have mercy on you and restraint for myself. Sigh.  In other dork news, I watched most of all three LOTR movies yesterday. And then today, I had lunch with Mary and we walked around and talked about things we want to make. What fun!! AND we got to listen to This American Life which was all about profanity and (as usual) fascinating.   Baby news. Lily came through her first round of shots like a champ. I did not break down and cry. I count the day a success. Baby tylenol is a wonderful product.   And, preliminarily, it looks like the Lakers are losing the Finals which does my husband's Knick loving heart good. Though I can't help but feel sad for Karl Malone. I'm not the best sports fan. I lack the killer instinct. At least as far as sports are concerned.

      It's like this. Generally, I have no use for celebrity, but deep in my heart, I lust after it. Intellectually, I can coolly disdain the cult of personality that is our nation's adoration of a few blessed, beautiful morons. But put me in a doctor's office and I snatch up the nearest People magazine. And every day, like a robot, I read the celebrity news and gossip page at IMDB. Anyway, famous people, I can take em or leave em, though I tend to embarrass myself and my husband in front of them. But there are some famous people who get on my nerves more than others.   Like Oprah. Daytime television is a big part of my new mother lifestyle. I used to have work and napping to fill up those endless sunshiny hours, now I have talk shows. And who would a talk show junkie be without Oprah. Oprah, who maintains that she's just a normal girl at heart who likes to save a buck here and there. Oprah who has John Travolta give her her 50th birthday toast. Normal girl my aunt fannie. And then today, on Oprah, they're doing cute redecoration things, and one of them requires re-making a coffee table. With plywood. And Oprah asks, "Where do you buy plywood?" Maybe she was just trying to get in an extra plug for the sponsor of the hour, Home Depot. But she looked really dumb. And fake. She's the most powerful woman in the country and she doesn't know where to buy plywood. She doesn't have people to tell her how this looks? And let's not forget that the reason she recommended The Heart is a Lonely Hunter to people is that it was Julia Roberts' favorite book. Don't get me wrong, if I needed advice on how to steal someone's husband, Julia would be up there, but literature? Call me elitist, but she's not high on my list of people who know from books.  Jenny's Rule of Celebrity #1 Know how it looks.  Another celebrity who gets on my nerves is Gwyneth Paltrow, but this needs some backstory. I spent an embarrassing number of years obsessed with a rock band you've never heard of (unless you've heard me mention them. In this case, my apologies.). I was eaten up with the desire to be up there in the middle of that. All that fun and style and inside jokes. To hang out with the cool kids, and what's cooler than rockstars? Anyway... here comes Gwyneth Paltrow, daughter of famous people, Oscar winner, no bigger than a minute and she's the love of this internationally famous musician who doesn't suck (if he sucked, even a little, it would be more forgivable). And THEN, she gets knocked up. And there is no scene. Just a quick, quiet wedding and some fucked up baby namage. This is upsetting a) because now we'll probably have to wade through Apple's movie career, too. And b) Mainly because it proves that to have that perfectlife with the happy family and the rockstar boyfriend, you have to BE Gwyneth Paltrow. Not to mention how she LOOKED while pregnant. Let's not go there.   Jenny's Rule of Celebrity #2 Don't rub it in. It hurts when you rub it in.

      Jeremy and I always joke that one day, far in the misty future, we will have a big fight about religion. Me feeling generally positive about the subject and him not so much. Now that we have a baby, I feel the fight is much closer. But before I can argue it out with Jeremy, a fine arguer himself, I have to puzzle out how I feel on the subject. You may not know this (except you, Genny), but I used to be very religious. Highly Christian, in fact. Unbeknownst to me, at the time, I was also mentally ill, so I am reluctant to trust the authenticity of many of my feelings from that time. Does that make sense? I'm unsure which parts of my faith were authentic and which parts were misguided brain chemicals. But this weekend, I decided to at least start actively pondering the questions, if not struggling with the answers just yet. I have very definite ideas of what Christianity doesn't look like, but what does it look like, in real life, in these modern times?  I've been pondering similar questions about parenthood and adulthoodand come up with the answers that they look remarkably like my present life. I wonder if Jesus will be so easily assimilated into my largely domestic existence. That's my problem. I *like* my life now. So much has changed so recently. And some old things, too. How far can I be trusted with religion? Which feelings are mine? Which voices are to be listened to?

      I just mailed off my first REAL&nbsp;short story to the writing group. And my parents. Except that the ending is totally undone. And not much happens. But I think it's going well. My characters are becoming more defined and clear to me. And I was able to work knitting in, so rock for me! And I got Jeremy to read it and it wasn't a totally emotionally wrecking experience. So, in four years of being together we've learned a thing or two. Yay.  Since my last post, we have moved into a new house. It's maybe a tiny bit smaller than the old house, but with better closet space. And more light. If we can just get the boxes out we'll be doing just fine. And we're closer in to town and right on the MARTA line. And, though I may not yet have told Jeremy, I signed us up to host a party for the writing group next weekend.  And netflix totally rocks!  &nbsp;

      I was just wondering if anybody would really be up for a seriously informal potluck type mixer thing some evening in July or August? It's possible that we have found a house to move into and it has a great backyard, so if all goes as we hope it does, then I'd be glad to host it. But if anybody else has a killer pad they're dying to show off, I'd be totally willing to bow out. You know, mostly an excuse to eat too much cheese dip and other goodies from the farmer's market and drink box wine and get to know eachother. I know, I know, you all already know eachother, but *I* don't. And I was kidding about the box wine.

      Spelling - by Margaret Atwood  My daughter plays on the floor with plastic letters, red, blue & hard yellow, learning how to spell, spelling, how to make spells.                   *  I wonder how many women denied themselves daughters, closed themselves in rooms, drew the curtains so they could mainline words.                   *  A child is not a poem, a poem is not a child. There is no either / or. However.                   *  I return to the story of the woman caught in the war & in labour, her thighs tied together by the enemy so she could not give birth.  Ancestress: the burning witch, her mouth covered by leather to strangle words.  A word after a word after a word is power.                   *  At the point where language falls away from the hot bones, at the point where the rock breaks open and darkness flows out of it like blood, at the melting point of granite when the bones know they are hollow & the word splits & doubles & speaks the truth & the body itself becomes a mouth.  This is a metaphor.                   *  How do you learn to spell? Blood, sky & the sun, your own name first, your first naming, your first name, your first word.

      Just a couple of things. I just found out we have to move in a (very) few weeks, so if anyone knows of a super good deal or has somewhere to recommend, I'm all ears. Email me. Also, if anyone wants to help tote or pack boxes. ha ha. But I DID think it would be nice to have a get together for the writing group and all our significant others and stuff so that everyone would have at least a passing idea of who we were all talking about during this six month experiment. Plus, I don't get out nearly enough with people my own age, so I'd like to have an excuse for a get together. if anyone else is interested, let me know and we'll plan something. I like to plan.

      very happy for the group blog. hubby says, "another blog?!" but he needn't worry. i'll always leave the computer to watch the daily show with him and the kitties. he can see me then.  unhappy because blogger will not accept any of my many names, even the real ones. hence, the rbkh. my name comes from hebrew so i suppose the nixing of vowels isn't totally unprecedented.  look foward to working with ya'll.

      Awesome idea for us to be able to communicate blogger-style, Mary! How I do adore posting and commenting...almost as much as I love carbs! Don't have any ideas yet for alternative names for the group, though am incredibly pleased to have been invited in. See y'all...you know...everyday of my life for the next five weeks. :)

      Thanks for taking the lead Mary... How exciting to have a new literary home for all of us.  I haven't yet come up with a name worthy of our group, but I'll keep chewing on it.  My recent trip to New York did however inspire me for the August assignment!  Now it's just finding the time to sit down and work on the idea that will be challenging.  Has anyone else come up with an idea, or has this last semester sucked out your creativity?  Oh, I saw today at the Java Monkey that they have open-mic nights there.  Anybody attend those events?

      This is OUR blog for our new writing group, for which we have just started and have no name yet.  Just for now it is "Word After Word" but only for the sake of marking a space in the blog world.  It is up to change.  So, what should we call this community of writers and non-writers? poets and dramatists?  We did brainstorm a few ideas in our last (and first) meeting.  What other good names have you uncovered under stones lately?  Please reply.

      I just wanted to check and make sure that nobody besides the punctual Mary and Doug had gotten their pieces in. Being the only one not on Agnes Scott Mail, I'm paranoid. Also, I promise I will get you my piece Very Soon. Just not right now. I'm working on it. I'm not just sitting here with a blank document and a whiff of an idea. Really.    Oh, about the party. How is July 31st for everybody? Anybody? I have a cute house and a cute backyard. I can shoot for being unpacked by then. I live in Decatur, off of College Ave. down towards Avondale. if anyone else wants to volunteer, it's cool with me. What kind of party should this be? Should we have a theme? Should it be meal food, or just snacks? Who brings what?   And one more thing. If anybody need boxes for a move, I have a bunch of very clean sturdy boxes that need a new home. Pick them up and they are yours.

      Hey, Just wanted to add a cute picture of Mary and me that was taken on her birthday! I would post other pictures if I was given permission by those in them.  But I'm sure Mary won't care.

             Well, it's almost over.  Regardless of the stress from last semester, none of us will forget Byron's hand movements during his presentations or Amy's creative hairdos and outfits or my standing, laying on the chair/desk/floor/whatever is available and all the other behaviors that set us apart from the person beside us.  But, now is the chance for those of us who are really writers to come together in a new and refreshing way.  Finally we will have a safe space to express our ideas, to question, to wonder, no matter how "out there" these thoughts may be.  And, we'll have the opportunity to publish together, attend spoken word events, meet authors, poets, musicians, etc.    I was reading "Life As An Adverb" yesterday, and Lee was talking about feeling nervous about going back to the real world, the working world.  I, too, already feel sad about not having school, not being a student who can hide behind that name and make mistakes because of that name: student.  But, we'll be that for each other and not the Survivor Island reality show type of student that many of us felt we were this last semester.  You won't be stranded out there in the intellectual wilderness on your own.    I just want to encourage everyone to really stay dedicated to the group, to become empowered by each other. It will be what we put in to it, and we will grow in every way if each person brings his or her whole self to the table. I know many of us are winding down from school, but I'm trying to look at my first piece as a way to purge.  It's therapeutic!   See you August 2 @6pm at Ashtons.  Oh, and I'd still like some feedback on getting together for a cookout or something at someone's house.  Volunteers?  Didn't Jenny say she could host?  When I get settled into our new house (hopefully by Christmas if not way before) I want to have everyone over! Maybe we can have our Christmas or Winter Holidays party at my house!! Take care,  -Amanda

      In addition to Amanda's post, I just wanted to add that the pieces are due soon - by this upcoming Monday or Tuesday (19th/20th) - so that each of us has time to write our comments and responses on them; members of group #2 will bring their pieces on the night of our first meeting.  Since we are the very first group to go, I suggest sending your pieces via email/email attachment.  Refer to Doug's list from earlier, and make sure to add Tony's and Lisa Anne's emails to the list.  I hope everyone is doing well.

      Hey all! Just wanted to remind group #1, which is Jenny, Doug, Laura, Mary, Amy and Lisa Anne that we will be looking for your first writing piece to arrive for critique in another week or so.  Good luck to everyone during the last week of class/finals for our MAT group. I know that you are relieved that it's almost over.   Also, Ashtons has started a Saturday night open-mic poetry event.  I attended last night and was quite impressed.  The place was packed, and many of the poets were extremely rhythmic.  I saw one published poet, Chris Slaughter, whom I had known in NYC and have heard his work many times... so some experienced people were in the house (as well as some new voices).  I think it would be great for us to go one Saturday night as a group.  I think we could really add a new flavor into the mix.  I purchased a CD from one poet called Freedom Speaks, and she really seemed to have mastered the word play of spoken word. It's a different way to look at writing, and I really think the audience would appreciate our diversity.  If any of you want to attend on the 17th or 24th let me know. It starts at 10:30pm but I only stayed about an hour, although I'm sure the mic was open for quite awhile longer.  One other idea.  I am hoping that we can have a public reading sometime in November.. possibly November 15 since we have extra weeks in that month.  Please be thinking of places to have this and the way you might want to organize the event... or if you even want to do this at all.  Ashtons might be an idea or somewhere different just for a change.  We could serve appetizer at someone's house.. whatever.  I just thought that it would be cool to invite those we care about to come and hear our work.  If anybody wants to head up the endeavor, let me know.  Hope the words are flowing and everyone is doing well!  Until next time... Amanda

      I just wanted to say hey to everyone in our writing group.  I know many of you know each other for about a year or so now...isn't that right?  Well, I only know a few of you; I see familiar faces on campus sometimes but we still don't know each other.  This is an excellent way of getting to know all of you; what a good idea!  I'm looking forward to it! Oh where oh where is this party...?  :)  ~Laura

      How is Saturday July 31st for the date of the mixer? Is it compatible with school? Will Doug be recovered from his trip? Night or afternoon? I started on my story today. Very exciting.

      Hey, I think we should try to get Khwaja to join our group.  He is a writer and would add so much to our discussions.  I know the group won't run smoothly with too many people, but I think he could really bring in a new perspective and make us stretch.    P.S. Are the creative juices flowing for your piece for August? Have a great 4th of July!  -Amanda

      Hi Everyone,  (do I have everyone on my e-list above?)          First of all, I still (okay, I'm a complete idiot) can't figure out how to post on the group's blog. Although I have a "profile," the name of our blog doesn't come up so I can't get into it in posting mode. I can, of course, read the blog. If anyone can give me a hint as to how to do this correctly, I'd be grateful.          Second and much more important, we had a very good meeting last night, I thought. I hope all the contributors got something useful from the discussion of their works.           At the end, we talked about how it went and what we'd like to do to make it even better in the future.  Here are the suggestions that came from that discussion.           --Each time we meet, anyone who CAN'T attend should let others know so that we don't wait for someone who is not coming. Email, blog post, telephone--just let the group or someone who is coming know that you can't make it.          --We will start on time, so if the meeting is scheduled for 6 p.m., that's when the writing exercise person will get us going. If you want to socialize before the meeting, come early!  If we need to change the meeting time to accommodate people who have to come from across town or whatever, we can do that.           --At least for next time, the group that is presenting their works should get them to the rest of us by email NO LATER THAN A WEEK BEFORE THE MEETING. If we want to go back to the other method, that is, you distribute your work at the meeting before the meeting where you present, we can do that. But only Tony brought her work to distribute last night, so we decided to distribute works by email for next time.          --Everyone should read everything two or three times before the discussion. That's why we need to get the works distributed early.           --Also, let's give our marked copies to the author after the discussion--that way she or he can contemplate suggestions, queries, etc. that aren't necessarily covered in the discussion.           --If you come to the meeting, please make every effort to stay the whole time. That's the level of commitment that will make the group work. We will do everything possible to stay on t ack, so that we begin and end on time.  Again, we can change the time to accommodate people if need be.          --These suggestions come from me. Could everyone put their name, the date of the discussion, and page numbers on their works? This will enable all of us to be better organized.           --Another suggestion from me--we can talk about this one. Perhaps the person assigned to lead us in a writing exercise each time could also be the "leader" for that night--keeping us on track with the time, serving as a contact person for last minute drop-outs, etc.  I fell naturally into the leader's role last night, and while I could continue to do that, I think it would feel more like a writing GROUP if we shared that responsibility.  Let's discuss this, and indeed, we can discuss all of these comments.            --Future meetings.  Our next meeting will be Monday, August 23, 6-8 p.m. unless we decided differently over email. For September, we pencilled in  the 13th and the 27th (so as to avoid meeting on Labor Day weekend).   Following that schedule, the October meetings would be on  the 11th nd the 25th, which works well with my travel schedule. Again, all of this can be discussed and changed, but we wanted to at least begin to look ahead.           Thanks to everyone who worked hard to make last night's meeting a sucess.  Special thanks to our four illustrious contributors/guinea pigs who held up beautifully under the group's scrutiny.          I enjoyed talking about writing with writers--I hope others did, too!          Christine
