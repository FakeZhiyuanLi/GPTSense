      Yesterday was okay until I had the sundae. I even got one of those new GO ACTIVE Adult Happy Meals with grilled chicken salad.   My stepometer doesn't work. I think that's how they get you to keep buying the meals!

      I ate much better yesterday. I had my usual english muffin with peanut butter, bowl of raisin bran with skim milk, and calcium oj for breakfast. Mid-day snack was a pear and low-fat mozzarella string cheese. Lunch was a chicken salad sandwich on a whole wheat wrap with fat-free chips. Dinner was meat ravioli with tomato sauce and a bit of freshly grated parmesan cheese. I had a chocolate chunk granola bar for a night snack. I had water and diet sodas to drink.  Whew. I feel I need the accountability of logging my food. I think I'll start inputting at  urlLink www.fitday.com  again.

      Well, I maintained this week. Not surprising considering what I ate. There was a Hershey bar in there, buttery movie popcorn, an all you can eat breakfast buffet and pizza!  Youch!  Must try harder. Good news is, there's not much competition!  How'd you do Nattie?

      This morning wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.  Especially with the 2 pints of ice cream last week, the wedding cake (only had a few bites) and the ice cream cake Friday night.   The numbers are... 191 (for real!)  I don't really know how you  lose  weight with the diet I had last week, but I'll take it!

        You're chocolate.  You're the old soul type, people feel that they have known you their entire life.  Many often open up to you for they view you as thoughtful and trustworthy.  Although people trust you, you have a hard time trusting them.  You prefer to keep your feelings bottled up inside, or display them very quietly.  It is alright to open up every once in a while.    urlLink   Which kind of candy are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Well, I did well for lunch today. I went to the diner with some friends and really wanted something greasy with fries. Instead I got a shrimp wrap with a side salad.  Now, I just have to resist the call of the vending machine. Man do I want something sweet!

      We all need some support. That's why we're doing this together. Maybe you'll be motivated when we post weights Monday.  Walking is a great idea and it will be good for you and mom to get out and do it together.   I know about stress. Things here at work are crazy and when I get home I've got the baby to think about, too. I've got employees with family health crises, people quitting, and people who can't get along with coworkers in other departments. Plus, we're moving and merging at the end of next month!  I've done some things to improve my eating, but we rely too much on take out and I shouldn't have had dessert at lunch yesterday. It's so hard when a sales rep takes me out, though. I'm off to a slow start.   How about you, Steph? What's going on for you?

         I didn't know that we were supposed to be going crazy with the posts.  Now that I know, I will.     I have been a very naughty girl.....    Monday I had Ramen Noodles for lunch and for dinner I had    something   , I'm not completely sure what though. Plus some onion and Garlic chips.    Yesterday I had a Healthy Choice mac and cheese with chicken cutlets for lunch.  For dinner I had A healthy choice teryaki chicken with rice and broccoli.  I also had some Ben and jerry's for a snack and some lucky charms.  (Told you I was naughty).    Today I have had my 20 oz cup of  coffee and that's it.  I'm heading out for lunch in about 10-20 minutes so we'll see what that brings.    Needless to say there has been no exercise. (at all.)

      I don't think I'm in this alone, yet. :)  Yesterday was a better day. I had chicken salad on a whole wheat wrap with fruit salad for lunch and a personal pizza for dinner. Yeah, Yeah, doesn't sound like a "diet" dinner, but I'm nursing so I get a few extra calories today.  Wish me luck. Today's a big day at work. We're making initial announcements about a re-organization.  By the way Stephie, I've started your sweater!

      I cheated yesterday. My new boss brought Krispy Kremes to a training session and I had one. Someone said it was Maple and I just couldn't resist. Dinner was steak and salad.  No Donuts today! I think a salad for lunch and we're having grilled chicken for dinner.  Dave's been eating mostly meat and vegetables. He's cut out all sugar and most white flour. All he needs to do is add some exercise.  I need to do that to. But, how to find the time?  We had a rough night with Billy last night. He was up at 2:30, 4 and 6. I'm exhausted!

      First of all I'd like to say thank you to Annette for starting this.  God knows I have no motivation, so this is a good thing.  So I stood on the scale this morning and reality set in.  192.  Yikes.  I hope to be able to fit into clothes that aren't in the PLUS side by labor day.  I figure that requires me to lose about 40 pounds.  So I guess 150 is my labor day/birthday goal weight.

      Okay. I'll go first. I weighed in at 220.5 this morning. That's 9.5 pounds over my pre-pregnancy weight. I could detail different milestone weights I've had that were lower, but I won't. I hope to be below 200 by Labor Day, ideally at 190. Right now, I'm just cutting back on portions and cutting out sugars and refined starches, ie, pasta only once a week and no white bread. I have to find time to add some activity.  I want to give props to my husband for losing 14 pounds in his first week on a modified Atkins diet. I'd be doing that too, if I weren't still nursing.   Okay girls. Where are your weights?

      Up a half pound this week to 222.5. Not too surprising. Good news is, there is no more ice cream in the house (well not in flavors I like).  Can't spend too much time here today. Everyone's moving in and it's time for me to do my job.

(love those double negatives).   I'm up to 198 and not happy about it.  Stupid conference.  (its never my fault). Plus my exercise program hasn't started yet.  The greyhound people haven't been in touch with us.  Its been 3 weeks!!!! (grrrr)

      Well, I made some progress. I lost 3 of the pounds I put on the week before. I was 222 this morning. I'm still not happy to be above my start weight, but Burger King, Ice Cream, and Snickers Bars will do that!  Good news on the sleep front. Billy slept through last night. I didn't! I woke up at 4 having to go to the bathroom and lied there trying to hear Billy cry. And then your brother-in-law was a snoring fiend. He's been a bit congested; he claims he's caught my sinus infections. I don't think so! Anyway, here's hoping Billy's done waking up in the middle of the night!  How are you all doing?

      Now I don't feel so bad. But, we're not supposed to be commiserating over how much weight we're gaining; we're supposed to be helping each other lose weight!  I had a better day yesterday until I made myself an ice cream sundae! Still, I was down a bit on the scale this morning. I know, I'm only supposed to weigh once a week.  Good news on the sleep front, Billy slept through last night. It was rough getting him down, but he didn't wake up until nearly 5. Early, yes, but I can live with it.

      I think we all may have to give our money away to someone else.... I suck too.  Up to 195.  Its not my fault though.  Too much food this weekend when we were camping.  Sausage and Birds Nests (which are these nifty egg sandwich thingies....) Pancakes and bacon... Dinner at Billy's Chowder house (O-rings, soup, fried clams, french fries, corn on the cob, and 2 frozen grasshoppers (a SUPER DUPER yummie drink-think Thin Mint)). So basically I need to get my ass off the couch and DO something!!

We had a retirement party yersterday, followed by an ice cream social and this morning we had a quitting party (moving on to better things...) with coffe, danishes (sp??), muffins, and all that good stuff.   Hopefully nobody else will decide to leave so that I can eat healthy again.   Would it kill them to serve some veggies or fruit???

      Didn't get any additional movement in this morning. Billy decided to wake up at 4:45 so at 5 I was feeding him. I'm really tired this morning! Of course, the four-month old got to take a nap on the way to daycare. He's probably still sleeping!  Still eating like a pig.  I did do some physical labor here at work yesterday. I threw out three huge boxes worth of old files.

      Got some negative movement on the scale this morning. I was up to 220, that's a pre-nursing weight.   Got some positive movement in that I went out for a walk this morning. Then I did some crunches and a few push-ups. Flab-begone!  I splurged and bought myself a fancy-shmancy pedometer at the Discovery Channel Store at Mohegan Sun. 2500 steps this morning. I need to take a longer walk tomorrow. No more snoozes (although 5 am is sure early)!

      Well, sue me for being in a meeting all morning! I'm back to 222.5. I have to double-check if that is up or down.  (I checked, it's DOWN!!!)  &nbsp; I have a plan, though. I was sitting at the Prince concert on Friday looking at all the skinny chickies and feeling more and more disgusting when I decided enough's enough. I went grocery shopping yesterday and bought yogurt, cottage cheese, high-fiber and high-protein cereal, melon, berries (blue and straw), apples, and nuts and will be bringing healthy lunches this week. I made fruit salad before bed last night. Of course, I forgot I have lunch with a vendor today and Thursday!

      I imagine it's a bad idea to buy a Hershey Bar (with Almonds) when also purchasing a lower sugar soda (love me that C2). Kind of self-defeating, huh? &nbsp; Oh well.

      I finally got on the scale this morning...  Down to 191  I think the weekends make me fat.  Hopefully my thyroid test results will be in next week.  Maybe that'll help explain my weight and the fur on my face.

      Yesterday, Mike and I went to the farmer's market in Waterbury (which sucks) but on the way home we stopped at a veggie stand and a veggie store/co-op/hippie place. So when I made dinner last night, I made: baby potatoes seasoned with garlic (minced and powder), onion powder, chives, and italian seasoning.  We also had corn on the cob and salad: green beans (fresh), tomatoes, carrots, red bell pepper, and green tailed onions.    Super Duper Yummy!!!

      I'm up to 226, that's a pre-nursing weight, but still!  I've set a goal for this week: no sweets. That means no brownies, cupcakes, candy, ice cream, cookies, chocolate, etc.  Next week, I work on fried stuff (potato chips, french fries, etc.).  Maybe I'll get back on track. Wait, I haven't been on track all summer.  I just feel so gross all the time. I worry that when Billy starts walking, I won't be able to catch up with him!

      Note to self, you should not live on cake, Pringles and Ice cream. It causes weight gain.  I'm up to 225, again.  I imagine after her tummy flu, Nattie will be down a few pounds tomorrow. I'm hoping the DQ fairy keeps Stephie up!  Thanks for coming down guys; I love being able to spend time with you.  Think about moving to Jersey, then we could go to the beach every weekend! (Not to mention the malls are better here....)
