      This is my first time blogging, so god only knows how this is going to turn out. Many of you may think, "Well what made her start to blog?"  Well the answer to that questions is simple I have a lot of self-absorbed friends who never want to here about my day or problems, and gosh darn it I want something to be about me me me me me for once.  I am a 24 year old, well almost next Sunday is my b-day, who is a Administrative Clerk for a local police department.  Don't get me wrong I am far from straight edged though.  I feel like I am Dr. Jekyl and Mrs. Hyde half the time.  I don't act my age half the time, but like a teenager instead, even though my maturity level is at least the one of a normal 24 year old female.  LOL!!!  I just love to party and have fun and I love my men young.  At least 18 though.  LOL!!! Not trying to catch a charge you know.    My life is pretty simple I drag my self out of bed in the morning, put on my Dr. Jekyl hat and go to work where I am professional and very pleasant.  Then once 430 comes around off comes the Dr. Jekyl hat and here comes Mrs. Hyde.  No one inside of work knows how I am outside of work, and I would like to keep it that way.  Well I hope that I can keep this "Diary" going and hope that someone will find it interesting.  It will probably be filled with several sporatic trist with my "friends" and probably some complaining about work too, never-the-less I hope you will find it worth reading.  Til next time.

      I can't believe it I have found him.  I believe that everyone has a love that they have lost that they regret loosing. W.B. is mine.  He was the best guy to ever walk in my life. He was a perfect gent. but could still argue with me when I needed a good one.  He was also gorgeous, could dance, and even make a mime laugh out loud.  Of course I was young and stupid and screwed the relationship all to hell.  Nothing new for me.  Anyway we talked all the time afterwards, but then he changed jobs in the military and had to go across the US for school.  We managed to loose touch  for almost 4 years until Friday when my brother got his e-mail address from a website online for military people to find old military friends.  Well I e-mailed him and he e-mailed me back.  Nothin long.  It was short and sweet, but all the memories came rushing back, and I almost started to cry like a little bitch, but I didn't.  I wrote him a little to catch him up on my life, and asked him to do the same.  I guess I will have to wait and see what he has been up to.  But to know that I will now have the opportunity to show him how much of a better person I have become is worth the wait.  I think he would be happy to know that most of it is because of him.

      I swear if I could change the name of my blog now it would have to be Life with Kooki (Confessions of a Twenty Something Drama Queen).  Life seems to get more and more interesting yet mind racking everyday since I have been seeing R.T.  You know first of all he has way too much baby momma drama, and now she is trying to make it worse.  Telling everyone that I am pregnant and don't know who the father is and stuff.  I don't mind the talking b/c I know that it isn't true it is just aggrivating that someone would go through so much to try to hurt someone else.  She is even threatening to call my work and tell them that I sell drugs and that I am an addict. (By the way I work for a police department.)  I swear it just makes me want to grab her by her hair and beat her head into the concrete, but then I think of how much I do like my job and how much she is not worth it.  I understand that this is all b/c we can't stand each other and she doesn't want me around her daughter or her baby's daddy, but she is with my ex-boyfriend and has been with him for over a year and a half, so why don't she just be with him and be happy and leave R.T. alone to move on with his life with me or with anyone else for that matter.  UUUUGGGG!!!! Girls piss me off so bad.

      I am in such a mood today.  I don't know why.  Everything just irritates the shit out of me today.  I think I just want to scream at someone until I am blue in the face.  Maybe that would feel better.  Then again that might also get me fired so let's not do that and say we did.  Maybe I just need a little good loving.  LOL!!! I think I might try that tonight, even if I have to give it to myself.  LOL!!!!Hope the day gets better, if not at least it can't get any worst. (Knock on wood)

      Ok, I am not the fall in love too easily type, used to be but not any longer. Well you know this young guy R.T. I have been messing with right, well I am starting to really like this boy.  Not fall in love, but when I see him no matter how I am feeling about my day I automatically smile. Look just sitting here now thinking about seeing him is making me smile.  Last night was the kicker though.  We was laying in bed going to sleep just talking and we were talking about how he can never keep his hands to himself.  (He is always picking on me poking me with his finger tickling me and whatever.)  Well anyway I ask him if it is b/c he has a crush on me, you know when you were younger you always picked on your crush b/c you were too scared to tell them that you liked them.  He tells me he wouldn't call it a crush it is more like a Kooki fetish.  Well of course at that point I told him to come and get some Kookies to satisfy his fetish. Then it was the most incredible he has ever given to me. It wasn't the hard core fucking that I am used to.  At first it was sweet and passionate until we hit our climax then it was hard core fucking all over again.  I don't know about this though.  I hate having the feeling of helplessness and no control that a crush does to you.  I like being in control of my feelings and thoughts, and I like not having to worry about checking in, but I also love to have someone to rely on and always be there.  Well I am still going to take this one day at a time, and I am not going to get excited about this or get all attached.  I don't think that anything big will come out of this, but if it does I won't be disappointed.

      I hate funerals they always make you think about death and the what if's.  My grandfather's funeral was yesterday and you know with President Reagan's I have been filled with the what if's for days now and that is not good. I shouldn't think about these things, I am only 24 you know.  Then I start thinking well you never know.  Why is it that when you are subjected to something like a friend or relative passing you tend to go through these motions.

      Nothing interesting last night, nor so far today.  I have a funeral to go to and don't really feel like blogging.  Maybe tomorrow.

      Well Well weekend re-cap.  Friday night- Well me and a bunch of friend went out to a local bar/club.  We had a blast.  Between G showing all the girls a picture of his penis to everyone throwing shots down my throat I had a fab time.  Oh yeah and when I got home had a even more fab time.  That's right I found me some b-day bootie.  My god was it ever so good too.  It was a long time coming.  Me and A.T. always talk shit to each other but nothing ever cam out of it until Friday.  God was it ever worth the wait.  LOL!!!  Saturday- Hung over, very hung over.  I felt like shit all day.  I always found out about President Reagan and cried about that too. Didn't help the hang over at all.  Sunday- My b-day.  Sat around and was extreamly lazy, then went to go see my little sister for a bit.  Weather was crappy, so I really didn't do much but veg out.  Monday- Slept in, but it was bright and sunny so I got up and got out the house.  I went and saw my sis-in-law and played with her horsies.  Then went and took pics for the photo contest.  This month the catagory is farm building, and that is not hard to find around here.    Today is good so far.  Not compaints. Let's just hope it stays that way.

      Every guy that I have ever met always say that every girl that they have been involved with is psyco.  I always say that there is always a reason behind a woman's psyco habits.  You know a cheating man, a chemical inbalance, or in my case family.  LOL!!! My parents separated in February and I moved home to help take care of my father.  Not that he can not take care of himself, it is just that he is a truck driver and he would never be able to do his job and take care of the house, so since he was the one who took care of me for years and years I felt that it was my turn.  BIG MISTAKE!!! They now drive me crazy.  Sometimes I want to lock myself in a room and not speak to either of them.  Mom feels like I side with Dad all the time, and Dad feels like I side with Mom all the time, when in actuality I side with no one.  I try to stay out of thier problems as much as possible.  So, guys before you start jumping to conclusions and state that a girl is psyco or is a drama queen take a little time to find out.  They just might have an issue that you might possibly be able to help them with, or then again they just might really be psyco.  My godson graduates from pre-school tonight.  It makes me feel so old.  It seems like yesterday I was changing his shitty diapers and this fall he will be starting "big kids" school.  I am also going to go out and shake my ass tonight, and as mentioned before I am hopefully going to find myself a b-day present.  Have all the details for you on Tuesday.  I had to take Monday off.  You know to recover and all from the long weekend.

      Why do people feel that when there lives are not interesting enough they have to talk about other people's, or should I say invent stories about other people's lives.  I talked to E.Y. yesterday, you know the yummy yum yum from T.C.'s wedding.  My god how could I ever forget that one.  My god my head was still spinning and my toes were still curling like three weeks afterwards, ok that is a bit of an exaggeration, but you get the point.  Anyway he proceeds to tell me that the reason he hasn't called is b/c B.C. told him that I was saying some not so nice things about his manhood and sexual abilities.  I spent forever trying to convince him that I never said any of the stuff he thought I did.  UUUUGGGGGG!!!! That stuff pisses me off so bad.  Other than that all in all if was a good night.  Should have went to bed earlier instead of staying up and playing video games with my best friends and her husband.  I am paying for it today.  I am so tired.  Good day at work so far.  Have about two hours to go and then I am out.  I have my god son tonight until 7:30 it should be fun.

      Well lets see yesterday was pretty good.  But, R.B. the Town Administrator is back today.  WOO!!! HOO!!! I am so excited. This place is so boring without anyone to talk to.  I have a dilemma today.  I have been thinking that it is time for me to cut this shit off with R.T.  Not that he is not a great guy, but for some odd reason I can see myself falling in love with this boy.  He is great in and out of bed.  LOL!!! I can't fall her someone who feels that the more girls you have the better.  I would rather wait until I can find a faithful one.  Until then I have my friends.  The closer it gets to this weekend the more excited I get.  I can't wait for Friday.  I has been awhile since I have been out to shake my tail feathers.  I need to.  A few drinks aren't going to hurt neither.  And who knows it might be like last year and I just might find myself something to take home for my b-day present to me.  :-)  That could possibly help me with this whole falling for R.T. thing too.  Kill two birds with one stone that has always been my moto.  LOL!!! I talked to T.D. yesterday I think maybe just maybe me and him can start picking up the pieces of our friendship and starting all over.  I really miss him.  See that is why you never have sex with friends, one almost always falls in love while the other doesn't.  That is what happened in our case, and I wasn't the one falling.  Imagine that!  LOL!!! I kinda like being a lone ranger.  You have no one to answer to and desides I still have a long way to go and there are plenty out there just waiting for me.  LOL!!!  Hey, someone has to think positive might as well be me.

      My long weekend in recap.  Friday- Nothing exciting.  I got stuck at work late, not enough hours in a day to get everything done.  Oh well.  Thank god for overtime pay. I had dinner with my Grammy and Dad and went to chill with my god son and best friend for a bit.   Saturday- R.T. came over first thing (Grammy had left to go back home)and my god was that fabulous.  I had waited three weeks, my head was about to explode.  You know you can only handle your own needs for so long before you need a little help.  Other than that, another unexciting day.  Matter of fact, I think that my whole weekend was unexciting.  Sunday- More time with R.T. but no lovin this time.  LOL!!!!  Then my brother and my new sister in law came over for a little BBQ with me and my Dad.  They just got back from there honeymoon and brought pics from there trip.  Can you believe that my brother took there lawn gnome with them on there honeymoon.  I know you have seen the Travelocity commercial with the Roming Gnome.  I so need to write them and say "see what you have started you actually have people taking their lawn gnomes on vacation with them."  LOL!!! It was pretty funny though.    Monday- Memorial Day. Yuck! It rained all day.  I was so hoping to go to the beach.  Instead I stayed home and made it a lazy care for Kooki day.  I gave myself a manicure and peticure, and watched the Law & Order marathon on TV.  I love Law & Order.    So, in a nutshell.  Nice relaxing weekend to rest up for next weekend.  WOO!!! HOO!!! Next weekend is my b-day and it is going to be party, party, party.
