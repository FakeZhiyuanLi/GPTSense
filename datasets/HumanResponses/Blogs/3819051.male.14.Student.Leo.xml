               I am the one and only guru. This time i have come in the form of a hardcore teacher. One day when i was playing my holy xbox, i noticed some people sneek by my holy ashram. I had to pause my game and see what it was. It was the mudafu**in teletubies, so i decided to do something rather not so nice to them.      I hated the teletubies because they were a bunch of hardcore losers. They had come to my&nbsp;ashram to get a blessing, but couldn't find the door. I thought they were rather thick in the head, because my door, to the ashram won an award for biggest yet humblest door! I felt that they needed a punishment because of criricising my door, by thinking very  little  of it.      &nbsp;    So this is the punishment they got:      &nbsp;     &nbsp;    When walking by... &nbsp;&nbsp;      &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;    When buggering me...  &nbsp;       &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;    When getting on my nerves...     &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;    when they couldn't find moi door ala fantastique... &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;    When they criticised my door...       &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;    When there was only one left... &nbsp;i did it myself...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;     &nbsp;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taught em' a lesson!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
