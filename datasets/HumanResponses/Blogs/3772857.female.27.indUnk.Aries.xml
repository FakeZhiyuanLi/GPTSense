        The sky is deep, the sky is dark,     The light of stars is so damn stark.     When I look up, I fill with fear.     If all we have is what lies here,this lonely world, this troubled place,then cold dead stars and empty space...     Well, I see no reason to persevere,no reason to laugh or shed a tear,no reason to sleep or ever to wake,no promises to keep, and none to make.     And so at night I still raise my eyesto study the clear but mysterious skies--that arch above us, as cold as stone.     Are you there, God? Are we alone?    &nbsp;

      My work week has come to a end. Hours to long from where it should be. I have gotten the good news that I am off to Saskatoon in August. I am looking foreword to spending some time with Renee and Taylor. It looks like we will be leaving Friday afternoon and returning early Sunday morning.&nbsp; I think we all need a break from home for a few days.   My Buffy Duvet Set with a pillow case came it last night.&nbsp;I also got&nbsp;The Watchers Guild Volume&nbsp;3.&nbsp;   And with that&nbsp;thought I am off to read... Be well......    Tyler if you are reading this call me......  Michelle we need a sushi date...  Wendy.. I am almost done my list&nbsp;of&nbsp;20 questions... Are you?&nbsp;  Karen...May sleep find you swiftly tonight...May it be a dreamless sleep....

      Well I am having isuses with the new operating system at work but I have a little faith and it will get better.&nbsp; I think it will take a few days to get back the speed I had with the old system.   Karen gave me this wonderful gift, it was Teddy Bear, brown with blue in his fur. As well as The Blue Day Book.&nbsp; I have been taking the Bear (Oliver) to and from work.&nbsp; I bet that I look crazy carring a teddy bear but it makes me feel better so that is all that counts.&nbsp; I dont think that I could ever thank her for her friendship.   I wonder if I tell the people around me how much they mean to me. I think that we forget that everyone needs to hear how important they are to us.&nbsp;

      I often wonder what I look like to the outside world. I know that I am not the most beautiful looking person but I know that I am beautiful within. I know that in the past year I have put on weight but then again I am working to get rid of it. I know that people find the things I say and do weird but it makes sense to me at the time. I often wonder if people really see how different I feel when I am near them. I am a watcher,&nbsp;I can watch the people around me and know&nbsp;how most feel. &nbsp;Most days I feel alone in a crowd of people but ask anyone and they will tell you that I am the life of the party. I know that I miss having someone special in my life but I have many bridges to cross before I am ready again.&nbsp; I know that I have burnt some bridges, jumped in with both feet, asked questions at the end insted of the beginning but I have learned from it all.&nbsp; I was once told that I come on too strong&nbsp;and leave too quick? I wonder if that is true.&nbsp; Maybe I come on too strong ?

      Three people told me yesterday at work that I looked like my dog died and my best friend left me.&nbsp; They said that I looked sad and was on the verge of tears. Is it a crime to be sad? I am not sure why I am sad, just know that I am really looking forword to go to Saskatoon in August. I think I am burn out. I wonder if its a combo of working too much, coming off the med's&nbsp; and just me. I cant wait to see Tyler in sept. Time has slowed down again. My friend Karen took my Saskatchewan Roughriders Jersey to see if she could get the team to sign it. For her nephew is on the team. I am gratful that she though of me. I wanted to get her something in return for all the wonderful things she does for me but I cant think of anything as wonderful as her. Any ideas?&nbsp;

      I dislike the summer heat. Its hard to sleep, sit, stand, talk, walk or breathe when its hot. I know I hate the winner cuz I am cold. Yes there is some things that please me but not heat waves or cold snaps.&nbsp; I saw I,Robot tonight with Wendy and Jason. It was great, go see it. Now go see it. No wait finsh reading this then go see it.  &nbsp; I am down today. I have been thinking alot about Toady. The girl from toronto that haunts my dreams. She once said that what we had needed a title or a name. Why is that ? Why does everything need a name? Why do we hold on to some memories and let go of others?  &nbsp; A song by Anthony Stewart Head - All The Fun Of The Fair that I love.......  &nbsp;   Well, I wrote this song when I was young and      Now I now I know there's so much I have left to learn      Adversity only makes us stronger, when we understand      That there's a purpose      Everything that you've done in your life      Every experience, every thought, every moment      Has led to this, has led to now      Everything that happens is for a reason      Every success, every defeat, everything      Nothing is an accident      All the fun of the fair      There's nothing very merry about going round and round      Heart's in your mouth, hands in the air     &nbsp;Head is spinning as you tumble to the ground      And this constant change of feelings is making me reel    &nbsp; &nbsp; Night.......Sweet dreams...

      Its that time again when we regain our city back. No more horse smell in the air, no more cars driving the wrong way on 6th Ave with BC plates. Not that its not funny watching the cop go flying after him.&nbsp; We are having a heat wave in Calgary as well. Its been 30C or higher for the last three days. I love my Air Con.  &nbsp;  I spent some of the day at Calaway Park with friends. They have a new ride Chaos, but due to the weight that I have put on during the last 8 months with the prednisone I couldn't ride on it. I never realized how different you are treated. I have always been overweight&nbsp;and have come to deal with it. I know that people look at me for I scream DYKE&nbsp;and most of the women friends that I hang out with know that everyone thinks that they are "with me".&nbsp;&nbsp;Not that I wouldn't be honored&nbsp;if that was true.&nbsp; I have been wondering if my weight has been&nbsp;my&nbsp;safety net. I can hide behind it and in some cases I have.&nbsp; I think that we often look at the outside instead of the what is on the inside. I can say that I have done it but I no longer want to. I want to see what is on the inside but I know that most people say that I am a mystery and I like that.&nbsp; I don't know what I am saying...  &nbsp;   &nbsp;

        As the rain on a mountain peak runs off  The slopes on all sides, so those who see  Only the seeming multiplicity of life  Run after things on every side.   As pure water poured into pure water  Becomes the very same, so does the Self  Of the illumined man or woman, Nachiketa,  Verily become one with the Godhead.     -Katha Upanishad  From The Upanishads, translated by Eknath Easwaran, copyright 1987.

       Well its been a few days since I have sat down and wrote. I am still off the prednisone but I am feeling it. I had to come home from work early on Friday for the room started to spin.&nbsp; I was not like fun at the stampede. I spent some time with Audrey who is in town from Toronto. We had coffee and a quick dinner. I am looking forword to spending the day at Calaway Park with her, Nikki and Kyle tomorrow.&nbsp; There is a heat wave going on in Calgary today, it was 33C.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  On to the good stuff.&nbsp; I know that there is a line in everyones life,relationships. I wonder if crossing them is a good idea. I think that I have crossed a line with a friend and yet I am not sure how to fix it or bring it up in the conversation. If you knew her I think you would be in love with her.&nbsp; She has this aroura about her that when you are near she makes you feel like you are the only one in the room. She reminds me of the coolist girl in high school, cool yet would talk to everyone and never talks downs to anyone.&nbsp; I have never lacked courage but when it comes to her I do.&nbsp; I wonder why?  &nbsp;  Well its time to go to work... See ya soon......

      I have been spending alot of time at Bad Ass Coffee house with a friend of mine. I wouldnt give those hours up for anything. The girl that I have talked about in a previous post was there. So many questions from her and yet she didnt ask any of them. Maybe they where too hard to ask and maybe I should have explained everything. The words that I wanted to say seem burn a hole in my tongue and dont make it past my lips. I wonder if I should of said more but insted I took the road that I always take, I said nothing and walked away. Maybe its the romantic in me that keeps looking for the Hollywood romance and the happy ending in everyone, everything. Sweet dreams.......

      Well its Monday again, and the work week has started. But be4 we talk of work let us talk of fun. It feels like there was no weekend to speak of for I cleaned out some of the clothes that I don't wear, some of the nicknacks that I don't really need as well. We dropped it off at Women In Need, then where off to the pet store. I wanted a plant for Splash, the fish I kidnapped from the supervisors desk at work, but today when I awoke to feed him he was not his normal golden color, the red spots have come back. I think it was the plant so I have removed it and gave him fresh water. I hope that it was only the plant that was causing him stress. Maybe I will get a picture on here of him so u can see him.    I also went to the drag show with some of the ppl I use to work with at Women In Need. My mom, and my two aunts,some friends from my mom's work and my best friend Michelle's Mom and friend where there as well. We had a blast. I love the show as always. Carly, one of the performers, made sure that the whole place knew I was gay. She went out into the street to see if some one would honk at her as they drove by. Just the luck that the car that drove by was a women. Then she came in and said " just my luck a f--kin' women drives by, but don't worry we have our own dyke in the crowd tonight" I laughed and so did everyone else. There was some shocked looks but they pass at a glance. I hope to take my brother and his wife to the next one. I think they would love it. After the show it was home to bed for 0700 (am) comes early.   Me and mom where up at 0715 and off to the Calgary Stampede. We where to meet my brother and his family. We walked through the stampede and not much has changed since my mom was there 10 yrs ago. I had the greatest breakfast ever, mini donuts and a corndog. I bought two more dream catchers for the wall and a gift for my mom's birthday in Oct. I was walking by a table in the roundup center and found a cup from Kenya that was hand painted, it has elephants on it and its beautiful. I think sometimes that giving a gift to someone that you love just cuz gives you a priceless moment in time. We where there till 1700 (5pm) then it was home to do laundry and watch a new show called "The 4400". (I taped the pilot for you Karen.) It will be on every sunday and looks like its about 13 shows long. I then stayed up as long as I though possible. Ok 0100 is not late but it is if you have not slept well in awhile. I am going to take a nap now for I have to work tonight.   I looks like I am going to Saskatoon with Berta and Lisa. I know it will be a good time but then when the 4 of us get together its always a good time.  I will see you in the darkness.......

      Well that time is here again. The smell is in the air, the people are here and cant drive, there where chairs and in some cases people sleeping in them on 6th Ave this morning. As I watched it from the windows of work, thinking always the same thing......  WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU THINKIN THAT YOU WANT TO SLEEP IN A CHAIR ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, WAITING FOR HOURS IN THE RAIN FOR HORSES TO CRAP IN FRONT OF YOU..GO HOME!!!!  Sry I was blabbling again. I sat at work last night thinking about what to write here. Today I dont have to work today or tomorrow and I am so looking forword to being at home in my PJ's. I love your new hoodie Wendy. I think I need to put up picture's up my room today. We had the appt painted in Feb and I have yet to put my pictures back up. I have not wanted to add anything to the walls for I have been liking the blue/grey that is was painted. Plus I am waiting for my Buffy the Vampire Slayer plaque "THE EMBRACE". It has buffy and angel hugging. It was one of my favorite pictures. I know that I didnt need anything more Buffy stuff but I thought I needed it after all the overtime I have been working.  Maybe I will put the picture here so you can see it. See ya tomorrow.

      So I am here watching Friends (its the one where Phoebe is a porn star and the movie is called Buffay the Vampire Layer) and eating Nibbs wondering why France would have so many cases of Mad Cow and noone knows. I thank you Karen for the update. I have ordered a Buffy the Vampire Slayer Duvet set. My favorite blanket that was made in 1977 has a hole in it. I wanted something that was cool and its my favorite picture as well.  I am looking forword to it getting here and showing it off. I get a pillow case too. (This is my happy face!!!!)   Days are passing more quickly than I would like.  Its almost August I am looking forword to going to Saskatoon spend some time with Renee and Taylor. I am thinking of taking the train the down side is I have to get to edmonton to catch the train. I am thinking of driving back. What do you think? Would you take the train if you could? I am just waiting for Berta and Lisa to say if they are going or not. I have 5 days off so I am looking forword to leaving on Wednesday and coming home on the Monday. I think I need a vacation and I want to spend some more time with Taylor. I have these great gift for them as well and I think I already pay too much to Canada Post. I know that I am paying some peoples rent but I dont want to for I think it would be better to give the gifts in person.    Sometimes its like a thousand people talking in my head, all at once. They all seem to be yelling different thoughts but lately when I am with some people the yell stops. I think its weird that some people get into your head and sooth the beast that lives there. I think that we are more connected that we think.  I read this book last week called " The Five People You Meet In Heaven" By Mitch Albom. I think that if you only read one book this year it should be this one.(  Albom follows Eddie into heaven where the maintenance man sequentially encounters five pivotal figures from his life (a la A Christmas Carol). Each person has been waiting for him in heaven, and, as Albom reveals, each life (and death) was woven into Eddie's own in ways he never suspected. Each soul has a story to tell, a secret to reveal, and a lesson to share. Through them Eddie understands the meaning of his own life even as his arrival brings closure to theirs.)  I wonder who I will meet in heaven, who are they, how have I touched their lifes, have I touched peoples lives? I know that you are shaking your head and saying that you love me and that I have touched your life.   Just some random thoughts for the day. Be well........

      So there is a new girl at work and she is wonderful. She likes Buffy, Xena, and is still mad that they cancelled Angel. We have been going rounds already for she doesnt like Tara (Willow's girlfriend on Buffy) and thought my favorite episode was horrible. So as you can see we will have some yelling matches at work.   Yesterday I was at work and said to Karen that I was out of gum.  The new girl says " I have gum its cinnimon"  And of course I hate cinnimon gum so I say " Cinnimon is Yucky"  She turns to look at me and says " You dont like cinnimon? Then you are not my soul mate!!!" and slams the gum down on her desk.  I sit there for a good 15 seconds with this lost look on my face. I ask Dave what did she say. Then we both stare at her. So the lesson here is never say no to cinnimon gum when the fate of your soulmate.  Every night on the phone ppl never get my name right and I answer the phone and say my name. I get Jennifer, Lula, Tula, Sam, Monica, Sarah, and my personal favorite is Jessy. I dont think we listen to each other enough. I have made a point to listen and ask the name of the person on the phone. I wonder if we have gotten so busy that we are missing the small things. Like saying hello to the people passing in the street, saying hello or have a nice day to the busdriver, holding a door open for 30 seconds more so the people behind you can get in the door to. I wonder if we are all walking around with blinders on.   Do u think love is blind or are we the so happy that some one shows a interest in us that we throw caution to the wind?

      I wonder what the world thinks when they are laying in bed at night. In that place between sleep and waking hours. I often think out the days events,ppl who I have talked to, the words I have said, the words I have writen. I think that I have been going about somethings wrong. I know that words can lead me down a path that maybe I shouldnt have gone. Maybe flowers would make me feel better. My friend Wendy says that flowers are given when some one in the relationship has done something wrong in some cases that is the truth but not in this case.   I had this dream a few months ago that I wanted to share.             It starts out that I am on the way to the hospital with my friend Karen to see my mom, the hospital is under construction so Karen is the only one who can find my mom. While we are in the hospital the van gets stolen. As we walk to the car there is glass everywhere, and a empty spot where the van was. So I call the cops and Karen walks home. Two officers come the parking lot where I and still standing. Both the cops are female. One's name is Julie. They take the report and then leave. I catch a cab home. As i get home and walk up the steps. As you walk in the door the living room is on the left and a closet is in front of you, and a hallway to the right. There are four rooms and a kitchen. I live in the house with Tyler, laura who works with me and a guy named John. I talk to tyler and then the door bell rings and ppl from my life deliver pizza. Then the cop named Julie rings the door bell and asks to come in. She has pizza with us and then naps on the couch in the living room. I got to bed and wake up in the morning and she is still there. I get up and Tyler is cooking breakfast and we talk quitely. Then I go to the hospital and see my mom. I come home and Julie is still there but she and Tyler,laura, John have shampooed the rugs, painted the walls in the living room. I go to drop my coat in my bed room and see that there is a set of bunkbeds in my room, Julie says " I hope that its ok that I put these in your room".  And then I wake up.  I have been seeing Julie in many of my dreams lately. I just wanted to have my dream here. Well I am off to bed. Talk to you tomorrow......

      Its the small things that get me in the end. There was a great thunder storm on Thurday and it took out my Air Con. then it took out the clocks and my puter. I didnt think about it too much. And as much as I wanted to bring it back to life it wouldnt. So as I left for work I left it in the hands of my brother. He put new memory in it and wiped it clean and so now we are starting from the start again. So far I hate the background, I have no pictures for my screen saver.   I wanted to talk about some great things today but I find that the word have left me, so until tomorrow.  07/03/04

      For the first time in weeks there is no rush to see the insides of my eyelids, for the first time in weeks there is no worry about sleeping late for today I am off. Today has been a busy day. I worked my shift last night from 2000-0600 and then came home put away the dishes in the dishwasher. Washed a few things, cut up the watermellon Karen ( my bro's wife) gave me, sat and listened to the rain. Watched Spiderman for today Spiderman 2 comes out. I just did what I wanted to. I am thinking of buying a magnetic board for my room for awhile back I bought some Buffy Magnets. They are like the poetry magnets that you see in the stores. I have always wanted a set and now I have the best of both words, word magnets and Buffy is the topic.    At this point in my life I find myself missing the joys of a relationship but the girl I would like to spend more time with is well has someone else that she is in love with. I wonder if I was to love only once in my life? For if that is true then I have loved and lost like the greatest love story ever told. Ok so I didnt die and nor did she but ask anyone who was near me in the spring of 2002. They would say that the person I was be4 I got on the plane to Toronto is not the person who returned. I am dead to her and she lives only in my dreams but yet I feel her in the wind and know that there isnt a day that goes by that I dont think about her. Sry wander there for a momment. Back to the girl who's heart belongs to another. I wanted to bring in up with her but I find I lack the courage to. My values are saying walk away and never speak of this again for I have too much respect for her other half but my heart says say something and then of course logic gets involed, here starts the yelling match. I would do anything for her but I know that I cant give her what she needs the most and truth be told I am afraid to come out of the darkess and let her see my true face. As the spring has given way to the summer I think I will jsut be the friend that she needs right now. And we will never talk of this again.    I know that you cant reply for I think you need to be a member of blogger but feel free to send me a email or send me a message via msn if there are words that you need to say. Till then silent friend I bid you good nite and good day. I wish I could say good night till it be morning but we both know I need my beauty rest.....   06/30/04

      I slept till 2100 tonight. It felt so good to sleep till I wanted to get up. I had some breakfast and then returned 3 phone calls. And it turns out that my friend Joanna wanted to see Spiderman 2. So off we go to see Spiderman. Having just seen Spiderman this morning I couldnt wait to see it again. So this movie Mary Jane's hair isnt as red as it should be, Dr. OC is played wonderfully, I just about cryed when we talked about uncle Ben. So I loved it and think it was a great movie. Michael from Queer As Folk was in the movie, and the roll he plays was jsut great, I laughted to my self.   After I dropped Joanna off, I stopped for a quick bite to eat. I sat in the parking lot of franklin mall. I sat and watched the seagulls and listened to the cars drive by. Where do seagulls go in the night? where do they sleep? Why is everyone in a rust to get home when its a prefect night? The moon is out and there is a coolest in the air that I havent felt in months. I sat outside the appt and listened to traffic on 16th Ave, this is my favorite time of the year. Its nice enought to sit outside and enjoy the night air and not be in 8 layers of clothing.   Well I have to run. The dawn is coming so I am off to read Harry Potter... Be well.... 07/01/04

      So today was a normal day for me but I marched myself down the street and voted. Now I know that we dont often say who we voted for but I voted for the NDP. I know that they are going to keep the law that says Gays and Lesbians can get married. Its something that I think we should have. I want to have the right to get married in this country. I know that living in Alberta means that is might be a while be4 I get too but I would like the choice.   Work is busy for its summer again. We are getting ready to flip operating systems. We are all training. I am looking forword to getting started. I think it will be a great for it will make things alittle easier. I have been putting in alot of Double Bubble (overtime). I would like a new tattoo by the fall. Mom and I are planing to make a trip to Mexico in Nov but we all know that sometimes life gets in the way.   I want to start taking more pictures and put them here. I want you to feel free to leave comments here. Well I will see you tomorrow.   06/28/04

      This night   I have spent allot of long nights praying that the moonlight  Will be swift in coming  Sometimes the silences eat away at the barriers I have built  Causing old memories to flow and the pain of the past to resurface  Taking me places I would rather not go  So I lay down next to the one who makes me feel safe in this world  There are times when the dreams won’t come and the fear settles in  I start to wonder if I am doing enough for you  I wonder if I alone can carry the burden that weighs down both our souls.  Can slay the demons that are always at our backs?  Will I buckle under the pressure?  I want to the hero but I find myself  Asking if it’s worth the extra load on my soul  Tell me lover of mine would you carry the burden for awhile?  Would you keep the demons at bay so I might rest for a time?  And find peaceful sleep this night  06/29/04

      I wanted to sit and write this for there are days when I am not sure what to say to anyone or how to feel. I have so many questions about the world but then I dont want to ask for I dont want to seem crazy or weird. I wonder why when you find something you like you never find it again or like when you like a brand of soap, then you go to buy more and gone.... Up and gone like it was never there. I wonder what ppl are thinking when it rains. I think of a spring day in Toronto. I am not sure who to vote for tomorrow but I guess if I dont vote then I cant bitch. Well I guess thats enough for today. Pls feel free to reply to this. Hoping to hear from you or maybe jsut hang out and read as the days go by..... T   06/28/04

      Its been a while I know. There has been a lot going on in my life. I spend the weekend in Bridge City (Saskatoon) to spend some time with Renee and Taylor. I went with Berta and Lisa. I had a good time. We saw the sights ok well I spent 3 hours in the Wal-Mart. I saw some fireworks and ate a corndog at the EX. The EX is a small,very small Calgary Stampede. We got another old fashion picture done. Maybe I will put them on here. We brought a small dog back named Tazzy. He is a yorkie and he is living with Berta and Lisa. All and all it was a good trip. But as always I missed my bed. I wonder if in the future we could pack our beds up and take them with us like George Jetson use to do with his car. Remember he would push a button and the car would fold in to a case that he can carry into the office. Ok so I am a dreamer.  I got to hang out with a friend last night. We had coffee and then watched Firefly. Firefly was wonderful. I enjoy Josh Wheatons writing, he wrote buffy and angel. I am looking forword to spending more time watching it.  Well I should find my bed..... see you on the other side....

      There are days when the world seems crazy. There are days when I seem crazy to the world. I often wonder why that is? I would why the world seems upside down and you are walking with your feet in the clouds.  I would like to think that I am not alone in these thoughts.  I think that there are days when I live in a fish bowl. I watch the world travel by my bowl, I never ask questions or wonder why they dont even see me. Then on the other hand I think of the people in my little fish bowl and I am glad that they are here.  I wonder if everyone feels like they are in a fish bowl.  I find that lately when I am near some people I feel live and free. I love spending time at Bad Ass with a friend, and I am glad to say that I have a "Cuddle Date" with her. That is making my day.  I am off to Saskatoon on Thursday.  I am so looking forword to hanging out with Renee. I now know what I am getting her for Christmas, I am going to take her a few gifts that I got her now. I think that I will be driving during the night for Lisa and Berta with fall asleep. I want to talk to more about Berta and Lisa but its time for bed......ok one more story before you go....  So I was sitting near the Soul Mate  at work. She was talking about how she got ripped off for her pudding was only 3/4's full.  I said (with no word of a lie) " Come here and let me stick my finger in it, it will make it all better" She said ( with no thought or pause) " I bet you say that to all the girls" I was a bright shade of red, and then we all started to laugh. Later after the laughter had settled, I looked over and she winked and licked her spoon. Then the laugher starts again.

         "What we sow in this life, we reap in our future lives. This is our karma."    I have thought long into the day about this quote. I wonder if we understand that all we are and all we have done in our lives has lead us here to this moment. I know that I have been chasing my soulmate for many lives as they have chased me. In every life I meet my soulmate but we cant make it work, but the reasons escape me. I think we dream of past lives, we dream of lovers, children, friends and family but then as we awake we push the thoughts away for we do not want seem crazy so we do not talk about it. I have already meet her in this life time and like before I have let her go too soon. I have been living for many life times and yet I have not found what I truly want the most. I am a old soul, a lost soul, yet I still do not understand why I keep returning. I know what I am told and what is in my heart. I love my friends too dearly, I keep carrying their load and not doing what I need to move on. I find it hard to not carry their load and help them along the way. I wonder if we have souls that we meet in every life. Maybe its like the line I heard some where , there is no word for old friends that have just met. I wonder if we all have someone we walk with. I think we walk along the path alone we are forever connected with that person. We meet, walk together for awhile then part ways but we are always connected, maybe even a heartbeat away. I know that we fall in love with many people but there is only one person that we are destine to be with. I think we all have lovers but there is always an ache for something more but we are not sure what is missing. Its like a hole deep within that is not fulled, many try to full it with nice things, homes, cars, jewels, and in some cases children but the hole remains. Maybe this is why we feel so alone in the night, yet I know that I have friends who have found their soulmate and the hole deep within is filled with a love that can not be measured or explain. Maybe I am over thinking this or maybe I have said too much. Why don't we talk of the lives we have lend before this one? Why don't we say all that we should? Why do hear the truth but then cast stones at the one who is saying what needs to be said?

        All of us are travelers lost,     our tickets arranged at a cost      unknown but beyond our means.     This odd itinerary of scenes     --enigmatic, strange, unreal--     leaves us unsure how to feel.     No postmortem journey is      rifewith more mystery than life.      Tremulous skeins of destiny     flutter so ethereally around me     --but then I feelits embrace is that of steel. On the road that I have taken,     one day, walking, I awaken,     amazed to see where I have come,     where I'm going, where I'm from.      This is not the path I thought.     This is not the place I sought.     This is not the dream I bought,     just a fever of fate I've caught.      I'll change highways in a while,     at the crossroads,one more mile.     My path is lit by my own fire.     I'm going only where I desire.      On the road that I have taken,     one day, walking, I awaken.     One day, walking, I awaken,     on the road that I have taken.

      Tonight I took my Mom to the movies. First we saw Catwoman. Then we saw The Village. I liked Catwoman, Halle was wonderful in leather. Sharon Stone was cool as well.  It was like all the other movies where they once where comic's now they are larger that life.  Now on to the scary movie. I was scared and at one point I had my hand in front of my face. I think that everyone should see it.  It was as good as The Sixth Sense or Signs. I think its the director that I enjoy. He thinks as we all should, different from the rest.  The work week is over for me and I am thankful. It has been a long week.  On saturday while having coffee with Wendy at Bad Ass Coffee Shop I looked out the window. As she talked and I listened my mind wandered to what I was doing with my life.  I was watching the cars drive by on 17th Ave. Everyone has a story, a place, someone that misses us when we are gone. Yet as we past on the streets strangers never look our way. Yet we walk with a song in our heart and joy in our step.  I have been thinking about the people that I keep close and the ones that I push away.  I am thankful for the ones that I keep close and that choose to keep me close.  I know that I live in my head and dont say what I should or let everyone know what I am thinking but its a safety messure that has been in place for years.  I think we all carry a burdon and sometimes we find someone to help carry our load and in return we carry some of theirs. Am I wrong? Do we not share the load with the ones that we love? Do we find a small piece of inner peace when we are in love? I guess too many questions and too many answers that dont match... I know that we should be thankful for everyday that we are here and I am but I like others wonder if we are alone here? Or why are not told everything by the government? Why do we have crop cirlces? Who build the heads on Easter Island? Where did they go and why?
