      Thank God it's nearly the weekend! This week has been dragging like God knows what. Unfortunately, due to being skint, nowt is planned, so hopefully something will crop up.  Dan and I saw The Day After Tomorrow tonight which was bloody good. I was particularly pleased because: a) The English people in it weren't cockneys with shit accents or really posh public school boys b) There was none of the "God Bless America, better than any other country" bollocks like in Independence Day  And so far I've managed to stick to my guns with the not watching of Big Brother 5. I am determined to not watch it this year - every other year my resolution fails, but fortunately this year they're all a load of tossers which kind of puts me off. I was tempted to watch the aftermath of the alleged violence last night, but it's a slippery slope. One minute I'll be watching that crap and the next minute I'll read Heat magazine and actually give a shit about Posh Spice and whatever her new handbag is.  And please do let me know if you also think Heat magazine is the biggest pile of turd ever shat from the fat hairy farty arse of the Devil himself. All they do is take a photo of some celeb picking their nose and give it a title like "Kylie inserts digit in nostril shocker". What a load of fucking arse!!! The worst ever was when they published a photo of Nicole Kidman stepping out of a portaloo, and when someone wrote in to say what a waste of space the article was, they claimed it was ironic!! How? Perhaps they should get a bloody dictionary, and more than half a braincell between them. And why is it that all of those programs like "The 100 Greatest Music Singles" ask that twat Mark Frith for his opinion? Like he knows ANYTHING about music? He edits a magazine full of photos zooming in on the supposed imperfections of others, just so he doesn't have to focus on the real world. He should confess to his local priest and be flogged, say 60,000 Hail Mary's, and very possibly be castrated (without anaethetic) and then be forcefully anally probed with a fuck off huge 12 foot spike, by me. I would do it for free!  Phew! As you may be able to tell, I've wanted to get that off my chest for a while now! I am not a fan of those celeb mags, I'd much rather read Loaded or Bizarre. Women's mags are poo and just go on about how to get a man and keep a man, and how to stay pretty in lovely dresses so he doesn't realise that you've actually got a 'tache. Women's mags are the magazine equivalent of skidmarks.  Now nursie has given me my tranquiliser injection, I am feeling a bit calmer now. . . zzzzzzz. So here I sit in my living room, and I have only just notice what a complete shit-tip it is. Both Dan & I are bloody untidy, so we've got videos in a teetering pile (right next to the shelves where they belong - plenty of room for them too), a small pringles packet balanced precariously on the back of the sofa, some of my shoes spread around the room -never together in a pair - because that would mean I wouldn't have to spend every morning swearing, whilst rummaging through books cds trying to find 2 matching shoes, and coffee table with God knows what under it and spread evenly over it. My mum always told me that I'd grow out of being untidy once I grew up, so mentally I must still be in puberty (which would explain my adoration for sad yet amusing phrases like "big baps" etc). Thank God I haven't got kids yet - I'd get them lost under piles of paper.  Ok, well I'm off for now, I have no idea if anyone will read this, but "Hello and Goodnight" if you do!

      I say in my post that I can't stand Jade Goody, and now there's a link to her at the top of my page! The irony! Why couldn't the link be for Peter Kay?? Damn my eyes!  And whilst I'm here I have to say that Big Brother 5 is a load of big hairy dog bollocks.  Night all!

      Hello whoever you are reading this! I hope you are well, and won't be too bored, and to be honest, tough poo if you are because no one's making you read this! I really haven't got a clue what I'm going to say at the moment as this is my first post, so please bear with me!  First of all, I'll tell you a little about myself. I have been with my boyfriend, Dan, for three years, and I live in Bristol in the UK. I love reading (almost anything), I love films (except the odd dire film like "The Mexican", which in my humble opinion was as interesting as eating cardboard), I love photography, and at this moment in my life I also love my job - an admin role. My hates include freestyle jazz, which is frankly as appealing as having glass stabbed in my eyes, Jim Davidson (don't get me started on that one), people who constantly ask a/s/l on chatrooms, and smelly people on the bus.  OK, so what next? Well I would like to state for the record that Gareth Gates is crap. I'm sorry, I just can't hold it in any more. He can't sing, and he looks like a gerbil. And what's with that hair? It also annoys me that someone with no talent and so much younger than me is so much richer than me! Bastard! I can't sing either, but I don't see anyone giving me a record deal!! Damn it!  Random things that make me laugh are: 1) the word "parp" 2) the phrase "floury baps" 3) the phrase "smell my cheese" (as per Alan Partridge) 4) A picture of Bernard Manning I once saw in Loaded,(I forget the caption but I was in hysterics for about ten minutes) 5) Gimme Gimme Gimme 6) Family Guy 7) Big pants 8) the word "eggy" 9) Peter Kay  Random things that make me want to punch someone are: 1) Shopping - especially shoe shopping 2) Party Political Broadcasts 3) People who say "I'm mad, me!" - you're not, you're a sad git 4) People who delight in being thick (Jade Goody as one example) 5) Pointless audio commentaries on films - I DON'T CARE WHY THE SCENE WAS LIT THAT WAY! LET ME WATCH THE FILM! 6) People who talk in the cinema 7) Children when they show off 8) People who don't say "please" and "thank you" 9) Shit bosses - grrrrrrrrrr!  One thing I always hated when I was single was patronizing people looking at me with sympathy saying "Don't worry, I'm sure that he's out there for you." Just because they were shacked up with a dickhead as soon as puberty hit, that doesn't mean I didn't want some fun first!  That's it for now. Nice to "meet" you! Feel free to leave a message if you want.  Redhedgirl Princess of Power!
