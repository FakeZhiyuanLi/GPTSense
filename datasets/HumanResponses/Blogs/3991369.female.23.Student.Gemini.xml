      &nbsp;  It is a calm day,today.so full of silence,i am thinking about afternoon,going to this proffessor i have. so harsh,so bad temperted,he is. actually i don't like him much,but i am going to work at his firm.there are two advantages,first the firm is near my house,second it is more like an "atolier". and maybe third i 'll learn from him.but he is so bad tempered. I am used to it though. I remember my mum shouting at me most of the times.dad too.he is actually more my mother's husband,than my father.always on her side. so i could say,i really never had a dad. no anyway,i don't think i care now.but it used to make me very sad. but you know i am thankfull to my parents though,cause their bad behavior made me&nbsp; able to deal with harsh and serious people. this proffessor,usually smiles at me...

           I have this light feeling right now,...with some "poolak"in the air,dancing round and round,so light,going up and down in the air,..some times they become still,when i remember a scene,an event,...then agian they go up,and the dancing begins,..no music,i hear a wind blowing,and there is a wonderfull scent,i am sure,i am so sure it is yours.

I dreamed about you last night.you knew me.you even smiled.but it was such a short dream that i could't...well,i don't know,maybe hold you? I am finding a job tomorrow,and i am also going swimming,and i will also have an icecream,and buy a few new books that i had in mind for sometime now,you know books are my favorite,and i will also do a lot with this computer,i am improving you know...i am going to teach when i finished this course of 3d max and all that stuff.and i am doing a lot more tomorrow,so i won't think about you during the day,i would be so busy,so happy,so successful. but what am i going to do about the night? oh the nights. they are miserable. even if i force myself to sleep,think about that handsome boy called Ali,.... you would come to my dream,with your perfect smile,i would fall in love with you again. and my story with you never ends.

      don't really know how to find the right words,...feel tired,i mean so what?we do all this ordinary things every day,some even exciting,adventurous,..but so what? you know if there is no love,there is no meaning,and when there is no meaning,there is no life. so we must find love.ok.we begin right now.i love arash,i love ali,i love pooya,.no not only humans,every living soul,..and what ever you may think of... but there is a new question now is it true love? oh God only true love leads to true life.i don't think true love is easly found,or may be i am wrong,but when we haven't find it... everyday's life goes on,and we laugh,we cry,we eat and think and work and a lot more....but there is always,something missing. you know what is funny for me,and rather sad,is that most people don't really care about any true love(what ever that is!)they are satisfied with their daily life.doing just ordinary things,maybe useless things.did it really matter if a lot of us weren't born at all?the answer frightens me. however,if i were a God,i would have only created artists.and maybe he has done that,but most of us neglect the artistic side of ourselves. we choose to be useful in matters that are really useless.politics is one case,which we have created,and not God.oh,i think humans,at least most of them,and among them "men",are really stuipid creators..if not say Gods.

      &nbsp;   Still my past....       &nbsp; I was wondering why getting drunk is easier than just saying what we feel?why is it hard to be simple?why does talking about feelings,sound so distructive for most people?and why do most of us call a person crazy,exactly when he/she is telling the most true feeling? I don't know the answers. but what I know is we suffer much more when we try so hard to hide&nbsp;our true feelings.and we try everything,from drinking to death,just not to talk and face ourselves. we are so strangers to ourselves.we are not our own friends,yet we search for friends outside. to tell us their feelings! most of us are just mirrors of other people.a reflection.in work,in relationship.try so hard to show what others are satisfied to see.maybe we gain some respect,some money,some days not alone,...but what we lose is ourselves.and we can never answer this "who am I?" maybe we should just close our eyes and go on.... that is what my family does,and for that matter me.but for me there is something new.i am fighting not to be a mirror.

          My past...       &nbsp;  I remember she always opened the door,when we where leaving the house.Then she asked"where are you going?" I didn't know what to say,more because i didn't know why i had to say.We tried to step out quitely so she wouldn't know we are leaving,but everytime,she did the same,and gave us a clever smile"oh,where are you going?"Mum always answered her,as if she had to."I am taking her to an english class.."..."oh we have an appointment at the dentist...".."we are having dinner out"..  Then she would have asked where the class is ,which dentist,what are we going to have for dinner,...I was mad.  Mum always answered her.  I hated mum.I hated the next door.  when i asked mum why should you answer her,she said "shhhh,zeshte,aberoomoon mire."sorry but i found no equal phrase in english that would match her saying,maybe because it doesn't exisits.  the neighbor was my aunt.and only 30.

      &nbsp; here i am ,in the last hours before it comes....tonight. oh it is not the devil.nor any cursed creature.it is some one real,who may walk near you every day who may smile at you,laugh with you,talk to you about all that nonsence like oh wha nice weather,and how i went to America! i know i can't stop it from happening,i wish i could,but God turned to a silente audience so long ago..i know he looks,but i doubt that he cares. for me God is TWO&nbsp;&nbsp; BIG&nbsp; EYES.and nothing more.he used to be a laugh,a secret helper,a secret listener,...now he is silent.i think he has&nbsp; given me the first role in the play of my life.a paly with no producer,no director.yes,he has made me my own producer and director...he has moved to the audience sit..i wonder if he enjoyes the play? just gazing at me with two big eyes. i am going to have a hard act tonight.you could at least wish me luck,O God.

      &nbsp;  &nbsp; it is coming....it is very close now.infact,too close.it is not a happy event.it is going to repeat.how can i prevent that?....just forget about preveniting..all i could do is cope with it. i know it is near.mum speaks few words now.she looks "thoughtful"again.oh God,i don't know who to blame,her or her thoughts...oh,,why can't you ever think beautifully?

      &nbsp;  It reaptes.never changes.like an everlasting scream.it makes me mad,sometimes i can cope with it,that is when i have the energy to stand against it,these times i smile,try to neglect it and i just do my own work....but some times i am..weak,can't stand it,i lose my nerves,and some times i get hurt,....by myself. the fountain of this negetive energy is she,can't really say her name,cause of the same "aberoo" problem,but she is close. and even more close...closer that any reletives. i won't get further. she, has this unbliveable power to destroy. although she looks harmless,weak,shy! she has this incradible power...to ruin.your soul,..take your strenght,stop you for ever.no it is not me,i am not weak,i am many things,but i am not weak.infact,i am so paitient that i have bared her for 23 years.... she hides behinde this "love" matter,sounds stuipid to me when she says that.anyway,not that i care,but she is always there,like a bad headache which you should bare. more like a cancer,that eats you up.until you die.some maybe strong enough to get free,...I... I have tried many ways..i still wait. i hate her. may sound cruel,unfair,but i would happily change my place &nbsp;with anyone who thinks "i" sound cruel.

      i can't believe it,after 2 years i still miss you.and you know your face has become blur,but what has not disappeared in my mind is you smile.the most beautiful smile. the one i would always remember. do you know what i feel now arash?i am angry.god knows i am so much angry.i wasn't like this before,do you remeber,how naughty i was,how happy,how...not knowing what would happen to me. i had the power to neglect every sad thing arround me,i had the power to make the unhappiest person laugh.now, i even get upset from the smalest challange.yes,you say,it will pass. i will be allright again. i trust you.i trust your smile,if you say i will be ok,then i will.

      I went to 'gachsar" today.it was fun,cause i went down this hill near the river,took off my shoes,my sockes and just put my feet in this chiling  flowing water....it felt like heaven.and i throw water at minna,cause she was the only person barve enough to come down this hill with me!it was very deep though. i weted every hot spot on my skin..even if i had to slip water through my cloths.

      i am so relaxed.blur pictures come to my mind,todays event pass like a film in my dreams vision....the  sport equipment shopping "i wear a two pieces bikini..."....the preasur i felt last night"she is so nice"he reapeted...oh i wanted to kill him..."ok,just shut up, and go to her then" he just reapets she is so sweat.....my visiones go on. suddenly i see myself,i am walking in this path,with trees on both side..maybe i am in a park,i don't know there is a nice feeling now...i feel calm,i feel pleasur,something is going to happen,i see a bench,there is someone sitting on it with his back to me,i can't say who he is...i walk to the bench,as i get closer,i feel the scent in the air,the blossoms ,apple tree..i reach to the bench,i turn my head to see the person sitting on it.and i smile as i see a familiar face. it is my arash. he turns his face to me too,and he smiles.

      everything is white.here,where i am kept.the door,the walls,all the curtains and carpets,all the tables and chairs,all the pictures on walls,all the satutes,all funiture.everything,...even the invisible rope around my neck,and the invisble stone on my chest. in  this room,there is no God. the windows are painted in white,so if you push the curtains all you would see is "white". this room,is a loop.every wall is the same,there is no door.on each wall is a window.and the windows are really "not".for reasons i explianed at the first of the paraghraph. i am all dressed in white.more correctly,i am wraped up in white.i think in  "white". don't get me wrong though. i can see. i have been here,since i began to see.and my seeings improve each day,now i can even see the invisible rope.i used to wonder why i couldn't walk freely.and why i felt so heavy,now i can see the invisible stone on my chest. what i do here every day,is what you do.but i keep struggling in a loop.and i see that you don't. maybe you are not in a loop.or maybe you can't see the white room,in this case,i hope you would remain blind. i don't know how i got here,who prisoned me here,my seeings are not that improved.but someday i know i will see the prisoner. i hope it is not God.

      There is more to a person,than our shallow judjments.why is it so easy for us to judge someone?and we don't want people to do the same with us.dear Hani if you are brave enough to give this view about Panahi,I dare to say that you are a shallow person.This is as superficial as your saying.  if we don't understand someone,we can just shut up and be silent at least.rather than saying things that would show our own inability to accept others. oh,and one more thing,not all girls are "zaeeeefeh",to be shattered when left alone.

      I laugh a lot.No speciall reason,though.But i laugh.Sometimes people stare at me,maybe they think i am too happy,or maybe assume i am a sloth,but actually i am a "broken heart" person,who hides behind her smiles,the laugh is the power.i believe in it throughly. I have never pitied anyone,above all my self,but i really miss seeing people smile,people laugh. I have a habit of looking at people- and not the buildings or anything else-when i am sitting in a taxi,going here and there.What i see is a pity.Peolple look angry,tired,bored,anxious,many more things,but not relaxed or happy,not even a smile. I am worried about my home,Tehran i mean,it is getting darker and darker.maybe we haven't noticed it,maybe we have but we don't really understand the out coming.

      Shel Silverstein - Cloony The Clown I'll tell you the story of Cloony the Clown Who worked in a circus that came through town. His shoes were too big and his hat was too small, But he just wasn't, just wasn't funny at all. He had a trombone to play loud silly tunes, He had a green dog and a thousand balloons. He was floppy and sloppy and skinny and tall, But he just wasn't, just wasn't funny at all. And every time he did a trick, Everyone felt a little sick. And every time he told a joke, Folks sighed as if their hearts were broke. And every time he lost a shoe, Everyone looked awfully blue. And every time he stood on his head, Everyone screamed, "Go back to bed!" And every time he made a leap, Everybody fell asleep. And every time he ate his tie, Everyone began to cry. And Cloony could not make any money Simply because he was not funny. One day he said, "I'll tell this town How it feels to be an unfunny clown." And he told them all why he looked so sad, And he told them all why he felt so bad. He told of Pain and Rain and Cold, He told of Darkness in his soul, And after he finished his tale of woe, Did everyone cry? Oh no, no, no, They laughed until they shook the trees With "Hah-Hah-Hahs" and "Hee-Hee-Hees." They laughed with howls and yowls and shrieks, They laughed all day, they laughed all week, They laughed until they had a fit, They laughed until their jackets split. The laughter spread for miles around To every city, every town, Over mountains, 'cross the sea, From Saint Tropez to Mun San Nee. And soon the whole world rang with laughter, Lasting till forever after, While Cloony stood in the circus tent, With his head drooped low and his shoulders bent. And he said,"THAT IS NOT WHAT I MEANT - I'M FUNNY JUST BY ACCIDENT." And while the world laughed outside. Cloony the Clown sat down and cried.

      i see this clown.with wet eyes,and a smile.a stuipid smile.a silly smile. he cries so much,in fact,as much as he makes people laugh,he cries for himself. he is not blessed though. i don't care neither does he he says so much rubish sometimes,he makes me laugh,well it is his job.he makes me laugh easily.but it is so hard to make him laugh.i have tried. it doesn't work.so i just hold him in my arms. he smiles now.
