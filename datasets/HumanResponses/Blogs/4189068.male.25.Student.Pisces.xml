      Yesterday, I had the pleasure of attending a campaign rally for  John Kerry  here in Southern Oregon. He is the first Democratic presidential candidate to visit the area since  John F. Kennedy , and everyone was very excited, except for the Republicans, who make up 70% of the population of my doomed city.  There were about 8,000 people there, and temperatures were near 100. Kerry was late, but we were treated to some fine tracks from Kerry's house DJ, whomever he or she may be. Such classics as  EMF's  "Unbelievable," and "Life is a Highway" by  whoever the fuck sings "Life is a Highway"  boosted spirits and got the surly crowd in the mood for some token stump-speech rhetoric. I was surprised at how lively and forceful Kerry was in person. He is a talented campaigner and he wasn't even heckled. I was there with my good friends  Scott Thorson  and  April Strickland , and we had a fine time, although we were both praying for the sweet taste of high-powered marijuana about halfway through the experience. Strangely enough, there weren't very many filthy hippies there. I guess they don't like Kerry because they reside in a pathetic dream world that is responsible for such entities as  Ralph Nader  voters or non-voters, and these scum are as responsible for the Bush presidency as  Jerry Falwell  and  Satan  himself.  Take a fucking shower and vote for Kerry.   Hurricane Charley  is rolling into Florida, but unfortunately it does not look like the state will sink into the Atlantic and lose most of its electoral votes. Although I'm sure  George and Jeb  would find a way to give fish the right to vote, and vote Republican. Democrats would blunder and only concentrate on getting in manatees because they are more intelligent and care more for social issues.  I would like to thank the cats at  Boards of Canada  for making sweet music and helping me have pleasant dreams last night. It just never gets old.  Hope is on the way.  Time:  3:16PM  Weather:  100 and sunny  Music:  Air (conditioner)  Clothes:  red t-shirt and shorts   Mahalo.  Buford X.

      I'm going to need to get the hang of this. I just googled the word "blog" and found this site and set it up and now I suppose I need to write something that will pique your jaded, speed-addled mind.  There is a vision immediately: I write for three hours every day and not a soul reads what I'm saying. Does it go anywhere? Is  Tom Ridge  the only one listening?  Well, Tom, I'm going to write to _you_. You are my audience for this first blog post of mine, and perhaps many after.  There is nothing to fear with yours truly! I am a peace loving soul who is presently listening to music so hip  Rick Santorum  doesn't even play it. And he's so young and with it, isn't he?  Sure he is, Tom! You know the story, my friend.  That's right Tom: Send your jackbooted thugs elsewhere! The terror alert level on this blog is permanently green.  But, Mr. Ashcroft, that's green as in "safe, upstanding, and fully clothed," not "pot-smoking demon spawn."  I have never read another person's blog, so I don't quite know what I should discuss. I'm leaning towards a delightful potpourri of political observations, vague attempts at humor, and pure slander, as is my wont.  Of course, if I don't read other blogs, how can I expect any of you to read what I'm saying? I suppose the point is this: what you are saying isn't very interesting. If it was, I'd be reading it. Ergo, if there's nothing worth reading in the vast world of blogging, there's obviously a void waiting to be filled by none other than me, Buford X.  But, seriously: there is a lot to discuss. There is a presidential election approaching. There is a war. There is music and "culture" going on somewhere. People are doing strange things in weird places. There are my friends and their many peccadilloes. And there are, of course, my own experiences here rockin' in the free world.  Christ, this feels so impersonal. But let's try a little observation, eh?   for fuck's sake, what the hell is fucking going on? how do we allow the wool to be pulled over our eyes with such willingness?      i read and article titled  The Tyranny of Petty Coercion  by Marilynne Robinson of Harper's Magazine today and i see what I've been waiting to see: somebody finally discussing how the term "bush bashing" has weaseled it's way into our lexicon as a token response to anyone speaking ill of the president...      ... thus causing anyone who buys into the term "bush bashing" to immediately peg the speaker of something labeled as such as merely another anti-american pinko who hates freedom.      maybe i want to say, "The president made a mistake in going to Iraq before he had a plan for maintaining the peace." i would say that is a VALID OBSERVATION, however, the think-tanks and talking-point artists in the right wing have introduced and popularized this simple retort, "bush bashing," so my VALID OBSERVATION is immediately labeled as the ramblings of a non-patriot who is probably rooting around in a bowl of granola and angel dust.    god damn it all anyway.     In personal news, my friend  April Strickland  will soon be in town (by the way, I reside in Medford, OR. Don't tell anyone). She is definitely the hippest, sweetest, hottest woman in the East Village. And on Thursday, a visit from  John Kerry . I visited the Democratic Party HQ today to obtain my tickets to the event. They looked at me like I had the plague, and I can't for the life of me figure out why.  I plan on doing a short rundown of the present state of affairs to end my email.  Time:  12:08AM Pacific  Music:  Stephen Malkmus  Weather:  78 and clear  Wearing:  white t-shirt and white boxers     Okay, perhaps I will refrain from including the last one.  This took too long. This will surely be my final blog.  Mr Ridge, I hope you enjoyed this.  Mahalo.  Buford X

      I wandered into a bar today in order to get extremely drunk.  Upon entering the bar, I noticed it was filled with what appeared to be a hateful mix of gun-toting muskrat pushers and disenchanted farmhands.  I ordered a double whiskey neat and asked the bartender to keep the motherfucker full.  I had every reason to get drunk today.  It was Sunday and I am not religious.   I was coming off of a very nasty experience with cough syrup and vicodin, and a particularly bad night with a woman from Detroit, and if you've ever spent a night with a woman from Detroit, you'll know what I'm talking about.  So I'm getting hammered and I go to put something on the jukebox.  The only thing worth listening to was Johnny Cash, and I never really bought into the whole hipster-johhny-cash thing, but I thought what the fuck and I put it on.  This gap-toothed charlie walks up to me and asks if I put on the song.  I say "yeah," and he tells me, "I don't want to listen to this shit."  "Well, there are two more songs of this same shit coming on, so I'd get used to it if I were you."  That was a pretty fucking stupid thing to say, but like I said, I was feeling fatalistic and already a little drunk.  Cocksucker laughs at me, looks back at his cadre of braindead charlies, and asks, "what the fuck is a pussy like you doing here?"  "Getting drunk." I bite my tongue.   "Why don't you get drunk at some pussy bar?"  "This one's cheap."  He got up and went back over the where he was sitting, and then a minute later yells, "Don't put any more of that shit on the jukebox, pussy."  "Sure thing, chief."  I paid my bill and left.
