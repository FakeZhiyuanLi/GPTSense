      Ok, ok...all kidding aside, this is my first post to my Blogger!  Since I have other blogspaces online, I may not always put something here...but I may also duplicate or link posts between my different blogs, if I think they are important enough to spread around...  :)  Knightsabre

      It's official now!  I stopped back into The Coffee House, and my photography show is up!  If you are in Lincoln, NE, stop down and check it out!  The Coffee House 1324 "P" Street Lincoln, NE  My photos are all framed, and everything is hung in the non-smoking areas of the shop, including the small area beyond the counter, in front of the restrooms.

      Oh, how I love being sick...especially when it means missing work. This week, for instance...I come down with something earlier in the week, end up missing two days at work, and things just fall apart while I'm gone. This results in me having to play "catch-up" for at least the next week.  This isn't the first time this has happened, either. Not two months ago the same thing happened, and on top of everything else, I still had to go in to fix a problem that no-one else at work could.  On one hand, it's nice to be needed. On the other hand, I could REALLY use an assistant!  Oh, what do I do? I'm the lone LAN administrator/IS technician at my workplace.  Knightsabre

      For the month of August, I have samples of my photography on display at The Coffee House in downtown Lincoln, NE. The majority of the prints are black & white, but there are a few color prints as well.  One thing, however...I stopped in yesterday (8-2-2004) to check things out, and noticed that my photos haven't been hung yet.  I am hoping this will be resolved soon...preferably this week.  If you stop in, you will be able to tell my work, as mine is all framed.  In any case, stop down and check it out, and have a great cup of coffee while you are wandering around!  Knightsabre
