       urlLink  > i want the world to fall asleep    for a few seconds today, it felt like autumn in new england. a cool breeze sprung up from nowhere as i walked on a deserted street in oakland, and it set some fallen leaves in motion. i was instantly reminded of the fall weather from my childhood, and the memory made me pause, breathless. the moment lasted for only a few seconds, and then the breeze subsided and the leaves scuttled around and finally lay still. the warmth of the day returned, and i knew once again that i was in california.  even after four years, california seems foreign to me. in new england, the cyclical nature of the seasons affected my mood greatly. the cycle became part of me, and vice versa--although i mostly took it for granted. i assumed that it was simply the way nature worked. i was right, too, but nature only works that way in new england. in california, the weather remains relatively constant throughout the year. the long, dry northern california summers are briefly punctuated by a month and a half of rain, and then the pattern repeats. these are the two california seasons--dry and wet. people will still play frisbee outside (in shorts!) in december here, when the sun breaks through the clouds and the temperature rises again from 50 to 70 degrees. in essence, nothing changes here... nature lies still, warm and stagnant, unaffected by time.  i think this weather affects me adversely. i can see how days stretch into weeks which stretch into months after months, with little to distinguish any one time from another. the first week of fall semester feels much like the last, and hence it easily becomes blurred in my memory, and leaves me feeling disconnected with even the most recent past.  in new england, on the other hand, you learn to feel the seasons change. as fall begins, the trees change color and lush green forests turn bright red and orange. as the temperature drops, the leaves fall and cover the ground. the air becomes crisper, and the earth, grass and trees all grow hard. the nights are particularly invigorating and feel almost electrically charged. most noticable, though, is the noise. as creatures (both human and otherwise) begin to spend more time inside their homes than out, a great quiet descends on the world. the cold air seems to carry any sound far, but there is usually nothing to carry. the result is that you become acutely aware of your surroundings--your senses honed--and you feel very alive, but equally alone. the damping of noise is even greater in the winter, when snow smothers the landscape. at night, in the snow, it is easy to think that you've been trapped inside a snow globe, for the ground is bright white, the sky pitch black and empty, and not a single noise can be heard.  i feel as though it is in this weather that my mind is most alive. however, the sense of being alone is so strong that i spend most of that time feeling introspective. i can easily understand why depression is so often linked to this kind of weather--indeed, i often feel that way myself--but it is not unwelcome. it feels, in fact, quite healthy. what is happening is that the world is going to sleep for the winter. the days grow short, animals hole up in their houses, and trees shed their leaves and stop growing. this entire process takes only about 4 months--from september through december--and each day therefore has its own unique temperature and emotion attached. living through this weather leaves me feeling quite grounded in reality, and connected to the natural world around me.  as winter faded into spring, the feelings of deep introspection passed and i felt more social once again. i grew accustomed to associating the return of warm weather with the end of the school year, and therefore there were many happy emotions attached to this part of the cycle as well.  moving to california has felt like being torn from the natural world. i went from a large, beautiful campus in the middle of the woods to a developed urban sprawl--from a place with chaotic yet cyclical weather to the most placid environment possible. i felt deeply connected to the world and its seasons when i was in high school, and now i feel as though the connection has been severed, leaving me floating in a world where everything is blurry, and every day feels the same.  perhaps i'm kidding myself when i think that portland, oregon is the right city for me to live in. perhaps i will only feel that connection in new england, and perhaps that connection is essential to me. it's hard to tell. all i know for the moment is that i'm stuck in california, stuck in college, and everything is hazy and grey. for four years, my world has been awake, but in stasis--as though kept alive only by a medicine that clouds reality. what i would like most of all right now--what i desperately need--is for the leaves to fall from the trees, the ground to harden, the air to become clear, and the world to fall asleep, exhausted.

       urlLink  > perfect first date?     copied from my orkut profile:   It's a blind date, and we decide to meet for coffee at Peets. It's crowded, and I've managed to get there first. I'm watching everyone who comes in the door in nervous anticipation, but when you walk in I close my eyes, almost wincing, hoping that it's you. We get coffee and take it outside, walking around the town while we talk and drink. It's bright outside, and the air is crisp. The wind propels snow-white clouds in arcs across the dome of the sky. We talk and laugh... excited, yet also comfortable in each other's presence. Everything is hyper-real, technicolor, and the end of PDA, by Interpol, is somehow playing in the background. We extol various squaresoft games and 1990s riot grrl bands. We discuss 19th century Russian literature and ponder questions of moral epistemology in a modern world. We roll around in the grass while listening to Pinback. We share with each other the books and songs that make us feel the most alive, as well as the ones that make us want to curl up and drown in sorrow. We spend an hour or two looking for celestial weapons in FFX. We sit on a couch, I put my head in your lap, and we read books together. When the sun starts to go down, you pull me up from the couch and we half walk, half run up to the top of the berkeley hills and look out over the bay. As the sun sets behind the golden gate bridge, we sit and watch the city in silence. I look over at you quietly, and your face is lit in shades of orange and red. You notice me, and smile, and I find myself completely lost... devastated by the complexity of your eyes.

       urlLink  >the light at the end of the tunnel?    Things have been going so well for me these days that I feel like I must be heading for some kind of major disaster. Actually, I'm a bit more optimistic than all that, but still fairly amazed at the changes. This calendar year has been one of the most chaotic of my life; it would be easier to count the parts of my life that haven't changed in the past nine months than those that did. I had love, and lost it. I thought I found it again in someone else, but was bitterly mistaken--and the process has left a part of me damaged that I thought was invulnerable. I suffered through some of the worst anxiety of my life while I was in my last semester at Berkeley, and when I finally did graduate, the feeling was anticlimactic.  However, now everything is going well, apart from the residual emotional damage. I have a job that I love, with brilliant and friendly coworkers. My best friend is very likely going to move here soon. Music is going very well. The list of people who hate me terribly has decreased in length by one (right, Ledlie? Any others on that list? Voice your opinion in the comments!). I'm even friendsters with the girl who inspired this log entry (and she's very nice). Apparently we've both been reincarnated as clownfish without even knowing it.  I am kind of unaccustomed to this feeling of comfort, this lack of anxiety. Are things going to go downhill from here? The title of this entry isn't quite right; I feel, in fact, out of the tunnel entirely. I just hope it lasts... but for now I'm trying not to worry about that. I have better things to do.

      ... how many posts I need to make in order to be considered "active". Let's attempt 5+ per day, shall we? I'll just start posting some stuff from  urlLink my real blog  for the time being.   urlLink  > falling from such great heights    Last night I dreamt that somebody loved me. More specifically (and to rip off the Smiths a bit less), I dreamt two nights ago that I was in love with someone, and that she loved me back. It was a weekend afternoon, and I walked into this establishment, which was either a restaurant, a bar, a pool hall, or some combination of these things. I was just going to meet some of my friends, but when I walked in there was a girl I didn't know who was sitting with them. Daniel looked up to say hello, and then asked if I had met the mysterious girl. I replied that I hadn't. He was surprised, and there was a general murmur of consent from the rest of the people present that the idea of us not knowing each other was somehow ridiculous. The girl (who unfortunately remained nameless throughout the dream) said hello, and we very quickly hit it off. She was fairly attractive, but what drew me to her was that her eyes literally glinted--and sometimes shimmered--with intelligence.  We talked for quite a while on a range of topics, and found that we had many things in common (most of them rather nerdy, in retrospect... like a love of video games and an interest in web programming). While we talked, the air between us felt charged with electricity. My senses were heightened, and I was hanging on her every word.  I woke up abruptly to my alarm clock, and didn't quite know how to feel. Sarah asked me later if it had been the kind of dream that renews my sense of hope, or just an unobtainable carrot, dangling in front of me. I think in some ways it was a bit of both. Mostly, perhaps, it was a simple visualization of a very unlikely ideal. Part of it, however, reminded me of what it feels like to be in love, and affirmed that this feeling, at least, is not as intangible as it sometimes seems to me these days.  However, it also opened up doors to some emotions that were a bit less welcome. The next day when I heard PDA it just made me want to cry.
