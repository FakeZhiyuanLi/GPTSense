						   I have completed my move.  To say I am settled would be an overstatement, but I am getting there. I am already sleeping in a more sound manner.  High ceilings and open space work wonders on mental health.  Everything echoes.  Conversation and loneliness.  To have this space fall into my lap has made the three years of struggle here in Chicago all worth it.  Living in this building is a bit like a cross between the Real World, Queer Eye For The Straight Guy (before the gay guys arrive and sprinkle fairy dust on the place), and a factory job stuffing envelopes for an industrial lathe manufacturer.  Open space equals clutter equals resemblance to a goodwill store.  But I have a room!  A large room which I am turning into a makeshift lounge for cold-chilling (as my friend Adam would say) and study.  Soon, the bare white corner will be occupied with a Queen-Size bed.  Do you know how long it has been since I have slept in a bed of my own?  Neither do I!  Soon, though, I will.  I can feel my back straightening already.  And oh, the room I will have to roll and shift.  Ladies, get in line!  Tomorrow, I have to scrub and clean my old apartment.  My shoulders tense at the excitement of sweeping the last grains of uncooked rice into the dustpan and sucking the last strands of hair into my electric broom's neglected bag.  As I scrub that last bit of mildew from the corner of the tub, I shall smile.  I shall smile.  Pictures of the new place will come soon.  I'm currently taking reservations from visitors.

						   From a virulent and essential essay that examines how our cognitive reasoning, fear of others, and propensity to inflate blame may be ruining us on a molecular level, as well as morally, socially, and globally.  Ignore-ance will be the death of us.   "Today, we are no better prepared for a SARS epidemic than we were last year.  "Homeland Security," curiously interpreted to exclude the most plausible and deadly threats facing our population, has remained the priority.  The massive smallpox immunization program in 2002 was little more than a distraction and waste of precious funds.  Meanwhile, we are afflicted with a government that has waged war all across the world to avenge the deaths of 3,000 terror victims, far fewer than die of influenza in a mild year; a government that insists on spending $50 billion to build a missile-defense system that does not work, a military-industrial make-work project designed to meet a threat that does not exist.  The war in Iraq consumes almost $4 billion a month, twice the amount we have largely squandered on bioterrorism since 2001.  We have grown so foolish and so incompetent that perhaps we do not deserve to survive.  Perhaps it is simply time to die."  -From the article "We Are Not Immune" by  urlLink Ronald J. Glasser, M.D.  - urlLink Harper's Magazine , July, 2004

						   from this point on, if anyone who knows me threatens suicide and i hear of it, i am having them committed or shutting them out of my life.  i'm not fucking around with this shit anymore.  you want attention?  buy a cat.  run down the street naked and drunk.  become the president of the united states and alienate the rest of the free world by waging unwinnable and unjust wars.  one thing you do not do around me is threaten suicide.  especially if you know certain things about my past.  she knew.  she took a cheap shot.  sometimes you can't tell how childish people can be until it blindsides you at an outdoor cafe.  and it makes me feel sorry for her.  sorry and sad.  nothing sadder than a person who is too afraid to even try to be happy.  i want to punch holes through walls and wail at four AMs that never end.  they say that things hurt less as you get older.  i find they hurt more.  the layers of piss and shit and dirt and insects and paychecks and bills and bile just gets thicker and hardens and it's easier to lock things inside.  but when that shit cracks, watch out.  -  let's change subjects, shall we?  something a bit more chipper and upbeat?    like, for instance, how i am moving into a new apartment in about a week and a half.  Over 4000 square feet split between two guys.  open space.  all rooms are self-made and can be reformatted, demolished, and re-erected.  bowling alley (regulation size, though not waxed or anything).  woodshop.  space to build a darkroom.  space to breathe.  space to set up photo projects.  space to do virtually anything.  also like, for instance, how i am going back to school in the fall.  northwestern university in attempts to pursue a dual bachelor's degree in english writing and philosophy.  after a four year breakaway from the whole school intellidome.  the first time around was because i felt i had to go.  this time it is because i want to.  you can't believe how excited and simultaneously scared i am to go back.  research papers?  correct format?  jesus, it's a far sight different than blogging, but i feel like i need to get some instruction and need to have more of my work critiqued and butchered and challenged to improve both my writing and my bullshit detector.  and again like, for instance, how i am going to be having a huge book sale in wisconsin to purge my parents' basement of the pulp and ink that was once going to be a used bookstore of my propriety.  when a plan falls through, tie the ends up swiftly.  lesson learned.  this will be a huge relief to get all or nearly all of my possessions out of my parents' basement.    -  the city was peaceful this morning.  meditative.  even through the construction and buzz and blur of morning traffic, the sun rays beat down at such an angle, reflecting a yellow-brick path to the sears tower.    sometimes i forget how much of a morning person i can be with all these late nights.

						   I've always felt a minute ideological connection with the media theorist / writer / thinker  urlLink Douglas Rushkoff .  It was after reading his new essay in the collection  urlLink What Makes A Man: 22 Writers Imagine The Future , that I found out why.  Everything he writes about up until his experiences in college strikes very close to home for me.  They say your early childhood affects you for the rest of your life.  I might go on to say that it can form distant bonds between people through their interaction, art or input/output ports.

						   Up until two again last night.  I need to stop doing this to myself.  Thankfully, I was able to adequately restrain my vices and drink only one scotch and one beer.  A far sight better and cheaper than last Tuesday's six Johnny Walker Blacks on rocks made of water and three PBRs.    I guess you could say I went on this pseudo-date-type-thing with a girl I had met back in January.  She had come into the restaurant where I work and asked me out.  After our first encounter in January I lost her number (ass) and fortune (which may be trying to inject me with a lesson or saying or some other such contrivance) smiled upon me about a month ago when I ran into her at a book signing where I was working.  In my charming and honest way, I gave her my number and told her that if she didn't think I was too much of a jerk, she should call me and we should get together.  Last night, that's just what we did.  After a long night of good conversation and many incinerated tobacco cylinders, I went over to her bookshelf and began speaking at length about some of the &#1082;&#1085;&#1080;&#1075;&#1080; in her collection.  It was when we began talking about Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment, which sat near the end of her second shelf (or near the beginning, but since I was scanning the books in a snake-like pattern, it became the end of the shelf from my perspective), I became very excited.  Then I became very self-conscious.  Then I became very nervous.  Then I became very sweaty.  Throughout the night, we had flirted and talked about our sexual pasts and preferences, and if ever there was a chance during the night of June 16 or the morning of June 17 to "make a move," it was this moment whilst standing in front of the great Russian existentialist novelist.  So what did I do?  I feigned tiredness and gave her a hug.  I admired her curves and extracted myself from the situation.  I walked the 15 plus blocks back to my apartment and fell asleep thinking of the inadequacies I thought I had overcome.    A moment of humiliation in the light of attraction and regret and a Russian author.  It would be rather poetic to say it was because Dostoevsky reminded me of another prominent Russian in my life, but I'd be willing to put the family fortune on the table and wager that it was just one of those coincidences in life that makes hindsight a fucking bastard.  No, it's because though I'm in a better state of self-seeing and my confidence is at a level it has rarely reached before, my trust in women seems to be dwindling again.  Healthy distrust?  Healthy caution?  Or is it the self destructive paranoid kind?  The coming weeks will tell.
