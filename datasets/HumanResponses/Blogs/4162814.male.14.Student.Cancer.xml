      the day was like any other day...just that today is singapore's 39th birthday!!! at about 4:45pm we went to fetch my cousins...and then we went to national stadium to participate in the national day parade!!!    we had to queue up at the entrance because of security reasons..and also because every person had to go through a metal detector...my mum went through, nothing happened..my cousins went through, nothing happened..but when i went through....beep..i had to step aside and get a body search..haiz..then when they used the hand-held metal detector, waved it in front of my you-know-what, it beeped...then the police asked what it was..then i said it was my zipper...oh man..how dumb could the police get??   the fireworls were very very nice..i loved it..i even kept some confetti in my pockets as a momento...haha..then there was a tribute to the prime minister...coz this will be the last national day parade he would be coming to as a prime minister...hahaha..  i miss both of them..let this song be a dedication to little foot and ducky...
