       It is sad, people, when you arrive at work to find someone sitting in your cubicle. When that happens, something is not right in the world. And it's your job to fix it. Otherwise, they'd be sitting in someone else's cube. And it is also sad when, upon first inspection on the human, you come to the conclusion that you afre speaking to a female, and the voice that comes out of the mouth of said homan contradicts said gender association. Yes, that's right. I came to work and found a woman in my cube. And she sounded like a man. And this woman didn't just sound like a man. She sounded like a  big man . And it's hard to carry on a conversation with a woman that sounds more manly than you. You wonder to yourself as you are speaking, "Is there actually a woman in there? Did she eat some dude and he's talking to me through her?" And the answer is left unsaid.    Moral of the story: LAY OFF THE STEROIDS, YOU CRAZY IRON-PUMPING LADY!!!!

       I work in Corporate America. It is a sad sight, people. I sit in my 10 by 10, watching a computer screen make fancy displays out of 1's and 0's, while the guy in the next cube does the same, all while conferencing calling to some software engineer in who-knows-where and sipping his Starbucks Double Tall Mocha, 2%. I walk about to save myself from turning into some kind of mindless computer blob. And this is Corporate America.    As sad as it may sound, the world of cubicles and non-stop staff meetings is filled with the thrills of.. uh... more staff meetings. Nothing exciting happens in a cubicle. Or in a staff meeting, for that matter. Everything is regimented. Nothing is out of place. If it were, it would violate some safety code and the whole upper management would come down on you like that grand piano that always seems to be hoisted up by a very weak rope in New York. The clang of keys is heard daily.    And yet I try to get by in this dreary workspace. I do what I'm told, and I'm paid for what I do, so I suppose that is generally how the whole "I do work and you pay me" thing works. I'm paid meagerly, but what should an intern expect but to be put in the only cube on the first floor that has a support beam smack dab in the middle of it?    I work, sleep, and then work some more. That's just what I do.

       I feel that my life right now is a constant game of catch-up. I've packed so much stuff into so little time that I have harldy time to breathe. I have found that I have no time for Leadership camp, nor my Family reunion, but I have time to work 2 jobs and that's it. I suppose there is an advantage to working non-stop.    Money. Cash dollah. Flow. Scrilla. Bling. You name it, I'm trying to make it. And thus far, it's to very little success. Too many little things come up that I end up having to pay for. Oh well.... money is meant to be spent, right?

       I guess it is only fitting for me to post an entry into my new blog. I found this blog trough my good friend, Chris.    I have decided to keep a blog, because it's much easier than a journal and it will allow people to see the real me, instead of the shroud that covers me.    The summer has allowed me to greatly ponder myself and others. I have decided that the worth of a friend is great. I have friends, I suppose, and I hope they consider me a friend in return. To those who know me, I consider you a friend. If you are reading this, I consider you a friend. I say this for one reason: If you ever feel as though you are alone in this world and that there is nobody in this whole world thato cares about you or loves you, you are mistaken. You have friends that love you and want to see that you are the best person that you can be. Yes, it's corny. Yes, it's been said before. And yes, it's true. I know that I have friend that respect and love me. I am reminded of a song by Train called Counting Airplanes. There is a small bit in it that says:  I don't spend my time with anyone  Who doesn't think I'm wonderful    Listen to the rest of the song, if you have it. It's a great song.    Final Words: Friends are not like money, where having more of them will better only you. Friends are like the ground, offering support and almost always being there for you.

       I had a love once. I still have a love now. But my love has moved on.    It was one of those things that just kinda happened. We got busy, and she fell apart. More she than I, I suspect. We had our fun, and I don't regret a second of it. Of us. We had a good thing going, and I had fun, for the most part. But I had always sort of wanted it to end, and I know she felt the same, otherwise she wouldn't have ended it.    It wasn't until it was over that I realized just what I had and what I now didn't have. I realized that I had taken advantage of what I had. I realized that I missed what I had. I realized that I missed her. And I still do. I miss her everyday.    We talked a while back, and "us" came up. We talked about times, good and bad, and in between. And then our conversation drew to a close with the fact that she was done. She said that she didn't know about the future, but I know that it's over. I have come to accept that.    And this is the drama of my life. It's a drama movie cliche.

       Okay,  So tonight I went out with some friends (annonnimity is bliss). So we went out to get some tacos from the Taco Bell, and because most of my friends are older, some cigars. I don't oppose, but I don't partake. They are of age, they can decide for themselves. Anywho, then we get to the park wheere we are gonna hang out for a bit. Some guy comes up on a bike and asks if we saw some dude on a bike named... uh... Weed. I think his name was Weed. Maybe it was Gabe. Anyway, the conversation progressed, and my friends asked the guy if he could hook them up. He could and did. So me and my friends and this random guy went through this park at 2:30 in the morning. My friends drank a little, not enough to get drunk, but enought to be drinking. Oh well. What are you gonna do?  So yeah. Then I get home at around 3AM and I'm freaking out 'cuz I thought I lost my keys. So I go back to the park and look everywhere for them and I can't find them anywhere. Then when I finally find the damned things, they were in the front door of my house the whole time. Go figure.  A freaking crazy night would be an adequate evaluation.
