       Yesterday Jeff and I went with my mom and sister to see Shrek 2.  I think it was better than the first one.  I laughed, I cried.  It also had a great soundtrack.  Keely had a really good time.  And a lot more celebrities did voices. John Cleese (of Monty Python) did the voice for King Leonard, Fiona's father.  Julie Andrews was the Queen Mum.     I also got to see the preview for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. It looks like it's going to be fantastic.     Also, I did get Jeff to go for a walk Thursday.  We went to Thunder Rocks and wandered in the woods.  It was a lovely day.  Well, I'm at work, so that's all for now.  Happy Memorial Day everyone!  Merry Part and Blessed Be

      Trying to post a b-log entry  from home.   Jeff and I both have off work today.  I plan to get him to go for a walk later.  I'll let you know how that one turns out.  I just signed up as a Witchvox Sponsor.  That means I donated at least $25 to that good and worthy cause.  For those of you not in-the-know  urlLink Witchvox.net  is a major Wiccan/Pagan networking site.  They post articles and help Pagans meet each other.  They do this without having any advertising sponsors, so there are no pop-ups on their pages, or annoying flashing banner ads.  I figure after all the people they've helped me meet over the past few years, it was about time I said "Thanks" and put my money where my mouth is.  I had a doctors appt this morning (No worries, folks, just a yearly check-up) and I weighed in at 148.  That's 2 lbs less than I had been on the scale at work, so maybe this whole exercise thing is doing something. I'll keep you posted on my progress, even if you don't care, or don't think I need to lose weight.  This has always been more for me than for anyone else. (Plus if I GAIN weight, I won't fit into my bridesmaid dress for Jess's wedding!)  Okay, let's see if this thing works....  Merry Part and Blessed Be!

      I tried to post last night, honest I did folks.  But when I hit post nothing happened, and eventually our connection timed out.    To Do List --     Get DSL!  I did exercise yesterday, I did Pilates and worked my arms with my 5 lb dumbbells.  I think I will start doing my Pilates and Yoga DVD over the weekend.  That's all since I'm at work  Merry Part and Blessed Be!

      Well besides THAT  I got home tonight and had messages to call Lacy and my mom.  My mom wanted me to approve and edit a letter she was sending to my brother about the problems they're having.  Then I called Lacy to talk about the problems she's having with Steph and Bob and her Lebanon circle of friends.  So apparently I'm a good listener.  Is that a marketable skill?  Can I put that on a resume?    Work was pretty standard today.  No big problems, other than all the web hosting calls keep getting dumped on us, and even the people that have been in RIG for a while aren't sure what to do with them. And for exercise I walked 10 minutes at work yesterday and I'm going to do Pilates tonight.  That's all for now.  Merry Part and Blessed Be!

      But this is my regular schedule now.  It's nice, it's not too busy, and I only work with one other woman.  It's almost 6 PM, I'm here til 7.  I can't wait to leave so I can go home and see Jeff.    Today's been pretty ho-hum.  I talked to my mom this morning, I think we're going to see Shrek 2 when we're down home for Memorial Day next weekend.  We're having steak and crab cakes.  I cut my heel on our bed frame, and I did my Pilates workout.  I also walked 4 miles out to campus and back yesterday, so I'm doing well on this whole fitness thing so far this week.  I think keeping a daily log in here of what exercise I do might help.  That way my readers can get on me about it if I don't exercise for more than a couple days.  Because nobody likes a fat Suzy.  I'm currently re-reading Lady of Avalon.  Jeff and I watched The Matrix last night.  And it's getting closer to time to leave work, so I'll end this here.

      And it's all Paul's fault.   I went to Paul's page, to leave a comment since he wouldn't respond to AIM messages.  But it wouldn't let me unless I had an account with Blogger.  So I created one, and here I am with a spanking new blog.  As my last one was well received, I look forward to doing it again.  This blog may include updates of a witchy nature, excerpts from stories I'm trying to write, and things in reference to role-playing games, in particular the The World of Darkness.  General update: My work schedule has changed so I now have every Th-Fri-and Sat off.  This means today I am not at work and Jeff is.  So I'm going to do some laundry, once I get it all gathered up.  I intend to pick up the apartment some too, but don't hold you breath on that.  Jeff took the laptop with him so I can't play RollerCoaster Tycoon. :(  I really need Grey to get my computer back soon so I can install my games on my own machine.  That's all for now, Hope to write again soon.

      I felt pretty gross at work today so I got permission to leave a little early.  Then my F*&!$ng Car! stalled out and wouldn't start back up not even a mile from the OCS building.  Luckily, two very nice men stopped and tried to help me fix it, and when they couldn't they towed it to the garage they run with a rope and the owner's pick up.  But now I am without car, and I don't know what's wrong with it.  Luckily Christine gave me a ride home from Coudersport.  So Today was not my day, although it is nice to know there are people in the world who will go out of their way to help you.  Chivalry may just make it through the 21st century yet.  And now it is bed time.  Sweet Dreams, dear readers!

      Forgive me, readers, for I have sinned.  It's been 5 days since my last confession.  I confess to having impure thoughts regarding my fiance and murderous impulses towards certain stupid people at work.    I decided this morning to trying taking Davan's online High Magick course again.  I need to do something.  My brain is atrophying and working near Tonya is speeding the process.  Plans for the weekend: Go see Spiderman 2 and shop for wedding bands.  I get more excited the closer to October we get.  I cannot wait to be Mrs. Suzanne Slaughenhaupt.   That's all for now, Merry Part and Blessed Be!

      Sorry, Just a little excited to be online.  My computer turned out to be just a little short on RAM to run the DSL, so Jeff has very nicely agreed to let me put it on his laptop.    I spent most of today reading a good book I borrowed from Michelle.  It's Blackwood Farm by Anne Rice.  It combines the Vampire Chronicles and the Mayfair Witches.  I have the first book about the Mayfairs, I think I'll want to re-read the series when I finish this book.  I think's that's all for now. Merry Part and Blessed Be!

      I didn't win the digital camera at work.  Dale did. :(  I was a close third.  Dale and Mike both work later in the week than me, Plus I didn't really decide til Tuesday that I might like to win, so I wasn't really focusing before that.    My DSL  SHOULD  be active Friday night.  I cannot wait!  I need to download the drivers for my printer, since I have no idea where the disc went.  Then I can print out cover letters to go out with my resumes.  I am thinking about asking Perry, my new supervisor, if I can list him as a reference on my resume.  The only problem with doing this is that I have about 10 resumes currently printed with my existing references.  But I also need to add my new job in RIG to it, so it looks like I'm redoing it anyway.  I'm going to play with my Fairie's Oracle more today.  The  urlLink artist  who did the paintings for them is really quite talented.  Merry Part and Blessed Be!

      Today should be a pretty calm day at work.  I think that stupid woman Tonya doesn't work today, so I shouldn't have to restrain the urge to bash anyone over the head with a mallet repeatedly.  Crap I was wrong she is here. Arrgh!  Honestly, if it weren't for the karmic backlash involved I'd curse her into the ground.  She really is too damn stupid to live.  I'm fairly curt with her on a daily basis and she continues to talk to me!  I don't know why.  I've point blank said to her, "I'm trying to enjoy my lunch and my book, I don't want to talk now."  And she continues.  I wish I could cover her head in duct tape.  Okay, rant ended.  I'm reading the book that came with my Fairies' Oracle.  It is a very beautiful and interesting deck.  It "talks" to me more than any other divination deck I've had.  In practice, I haven't even been using the definitions from the book, I just look at the card and "listen" and feel the impression that it gives me.  I can't wait to show them to Michelle tomorrow.    Well, that's all for now. Merry Part and Blessed Be!

      I leisurely got out of bed around 9 AM today, and spent the morning playing Roller Coaster Tycoon.  But what made it such a great morning was Jeff stopped at home around 11 AM on his way to pick up lunch for the people at the hospital.  He kissed me until I was dizzy and couldn't breathe.  It's put a smile on my face for the rest of the day.  Not too much else here.  Barbie said I could use this computer to email out some resumes, so that's what I'm going to do.  There was a listing for a marketing person at WESB and also one for insurance agents in Bradford.  Wish me luck!  Merry Part and Blessed Be!

      All the little programs that make it possible for me to do my job aren't working.  The billing system is running like a gelatinous cube, and now the program that shows us if calls are waiting is down.  And now there's a monsoon outside.    I'm getting used to my glasses.  I'm also trying to plan a picnic for Litha on Saturday.  That's the Summer Solstice, or Midsummer.  Traditionally it is a good time for communicating with fairies and other nature spirits.  I'm planning on taking my Fairie Oracle with me so I can do readings for everyone, or at least show off the beautiful artwork.  I wish I could scan them to put on the page.  I still don't know if I won a digital camera or not.  If I did, I'll post a picture of me in my new spectacles for everyone to see.  That's all for today, Merry Part and Blessed Be!

      Only two more hours... then I get to go home and see Jeff.    I feel like I'm cheating on Adelphia.  I ordered DSL on Friday.  It should be here the 18th of June.  I am excited.  I am currently reading I, Strahd.  It's a Ravenloft novel.  I miss role-playing.  Reading this book makes me want to play vampire.  I miss Leonora.  I found a note I wrote to Vita in game while I was cleaning off the desk this weekend.  Something about persuading the warlock to help...  Well, still working.  Merry Part and Blessed Be, Suzanne

      I hate weekends where I don't get to spend time with Jeff.  The only day we had off together was Saturday, and I had Jess's wedding shower to go to.  That was fun, I got to visit with Emily Shea and Jess, but I still missed my Jeff time.  Last night we rented Return of the King and Club Dread.  Club Dread is by the same guys who brought us Super Troopers.  It was pretty darn funny, but I think I liked Super Troopers better.  I'm at work today. I'm hungry and I'm bored.  I need to call Verizon Wireless because they seem to think I still owe them money, and I know I've paid them.  I actually paid them twice and they sent me a check for the amount back about 6 months ago.  And I can't make any changes on the website with it, because I don't remember the user name and password, acct #, or even what my damn cell phone # was.      In good news I got my computer back up and running.   I've got Diablo II Lord of Destruction, RollerCoaster Tycoon and Sim Golf to keep my happy.  Although I do have a tendency  to say RollerToaster Tycoon instead of RollerCoaster.  Which begs the questions, what IS a rollertoaster?  Well, that's enough rambling for now.  As soon as Barbie gets back from her break I'm going to eat.  I wish I had called off today.  So bored....

      walk walk walk THWACK!  No, I was wrong.  - Blinken, Robin Hood Men in Tights  But I can see.  My glasses came in yesterday.  Jeff says I look good in them.  I've apparently got a sexy librarian vibe going on.    Other than that, I got my computer set up yesterday.  I called and chatted with Lacy for a bit, did dishes etc.  Today I am going to call Verizon to find out about DSL packages.  I figure if I can get some fast internet, and a good long distance package together, why not?    Work was going well when I left it on Wednesday.  They have an incentive for whoever takes the most inbound calls during the pay period.  I was winning as of Tuesday night, Wesley told me. So I may be winning a digital camera. f

      It was 80 degrees out when I took my walk at my 3:30 break.  I walked all the way to the post office in Coudersport.  I can tell I haven't walked in a few days because my quads were really twitching when I got back.    Not too much else going on.  My summer weekends are filling up way too fast for me.  I've got weddings, wedding showers, graduation parties, Lace and Jay are going to try to come visit, etc etc etc.  Well, still at work, so Merry Part and Blessed Be!

      Today is my parents' 28th wedding anniversary.  I think in a couple years I'll have to throw them a big party.  30th Anniversary is the Pearl Anniversary (like 25th is Silver and 50th is Gold) I'll either throw a party, or take Keely for a couple days and send them to a hotel or something.  On second thought, I like that idea better.  I'll save the big party for their 50th.  I will be 54 years old then. And I should have children that are old enough to do the heavy lifting.  Paul, thank you for the support on the glasses thing.  I guess I should remember most of my favorite people wear glasses.  And they all look dignified and smart.  In fact, when my Aunt Cindy was little, she once failed an eye test on purpose because she wanted glasses so she could look smarter.  She also wore a pair of frames with no lenses for a while to get the same "look".    Not too much else going on.  Mom and I went and checked out a karaoke machine for the reception, then decided just to get a DJ instead.  She's looking for people that do both karaoke and regular DJing first though.  If we can't find someone who does both for a reasonable rate, we'll just go with a normal DJ and no karaoke.  I also picked up my bridesmaid dress for Jess's wedding, which I need hemmed.  I knew I should have made them order a size 10!  Now I need to find someone in Bradford who can alter formalwear.  Before July 17th. Grr...  As pleased as I am to get to be in the wedding, I'm glad most of my friends skipped or plan to skip the big wedding thing.    Well, I've rambled on long enough, and I have work to do.  Merry Part and Blessed Be!

      I'm at my parents' house today, doing the laundry.  Mom and I are going shop for decorations and whatnot for the big party.  I am going to try to make it down to Franklin to pick up my bridesmaid dress from Annie's in Franklin.   Jeff and I got our pictures back.  So be looking for an engagement announcements in the Forest Press soon.  What?  You don't get the Forest Press where you are?  I guess that means Jeff wins, and as few people as little will see a picture of us. (read him)   I also found out Thursday that I need glasses.  I'll be getting them next week.  I'm hoping I can just get away with wearing them to drive, and other things that require the ability to see clearly more than 6 feet away.  But the optometrist made it sound like I'm going to need them all the time.  I might look into getting contacts, but I'm going to go with glasses first.  Mainly because I rub at my eyes all the time and I don't want to poke things in them.  That's all for now, Merry Part and Blessed Be!

      As I walked into work this morning, two herons were flying up the Allegheny, calling to each other.  Jeff, didn't we just say the other day how members of the crane family mate for life?  I felt blessed to see them.  It also made me feel a little homesick for West Hickory, where the Allegheny isn't shoved into a cement ditch, like it is here in Coudersport.  And I think there is going to be fun at work today.  It looks like someone is setting up a casino and games and stuff.  Maybe I'll win something cool. :)  And Rob, and I can't do anything about your internet service until you get an Adelphia account.  What number were you calling that they couldn't transfer you?  Try 1-888-683-1000.  Merry Part and Blessed Be!

      Sometimes the end of the day here at Adelphia is lot like the end of the day in high school.  People yell random things like - Gary's not working his calls, Darlene's flashing people, Vera's not segueing, Charlene's pregnant.  All of these things may or may not be true.  (For example, Charlene IS pregnant. Everyone knows that)  There is also a lot of laughing.  It is very immature, but at the same time, there is a good happy energy in the building.  A lot like a preschool...  Blessed Be and Merry Part!

      The China Garden was closed today!  No won ton soup for me, I had to eat McDonald's. Which barely filled me up.  I'm going to be starving when I get home at 10 PM, which is probably good since Jeff is making me dinner.  Mmm... chicken in Italian dressing.   China Garden had better be open tomorrow.  It's sweet and sour chicken day.  Blessed Be and Merry Part

      Yesterday on the way home from work my Buick Skylark rolled over 100,000 miles.  Thisis the first car I have had long enough to do that. (Or that wasn't over that already when I got it)  I pulled over and took a picture of the odometer and the car.  A bit silly, but still, it felt important.  Also, Jeff and I are getting married in 3 months and 1 day.   I can't wait.  :)  I do really need to start making some decisions about decorating the hall for the reception.  Up til now I've just had a generic Harvesty theme in mind.  I need to get down to brass tacks here, start doing pricing.  Plus we need to order our wedding bands!  We are getting them from  urlLink Andover Metalsmiths.   They do really beautiful work. Working the long day today.  I plan to get Won Ton soup for lunch from China Garden.  Mmm...  Interesting customer name: Terilyn Ford.  It sounds like a role-playing character name.  Come home soon, Paul, I want to play D&D!

So I need to vacuum and pick up the living room a bit.&nbsp; I just wanted to post before I wandered away from the laptop and forgot about it for the day.&nbsp; In other good news I have successfully meditated for 3 days in a row.&nbsp; I wonder if doing it twice today could count for tomorrow, which I will likely miss as Lace will be here?&nbsp;   Merry Part and Blessed Be!

      Last week was very busy with all the wedding festivities for Jess and Frosh.&nbsp; In the end it was very beautiful and everything went off with only a few minor hiccups. (Hooray for carpet tape!)&nbsp; I have pictures of Jeff in a tux, and he looked very sexy. :)&nbsp;  &nbsp; He rented a bunch of movies today, so we're going to watch them.&nbsp; 1 James Bond flick, one Woody Allen, and I don't remember the other.&nbsp; This is what happens&nbsp;when a man goes to the video store alone ;-) &nbsp; Apparently the 3rd movie is a werewolf movie.&nbsp; That sounds pretty cool actually, though I've been on a really long vampire kick lately.&nbsp; I just finished reading the latest Anne Rice novel, Blood Canticle.&nbsp; It was a good joining of the Mayfair Witches and the Vampire Chronicles.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I think that's all for now.&nbsp; I want to go get horizontal &nbsp; Blessed Be and Merry Part! &nbsp; PS - Lacy is coming for the weekend!!! :-)

      Jeff, Frosh and I are going to see King Arthur, then the boys are leaving for their party in Weedville with Chits.  Chits called this morning and said he had turkeys to deep fry.  That sounds so good!  But I'm looking forward to seeing the movie, even though it depicts Guinevere as a Celtic warrior princess, and I'm much more used to the idea of her as a super Christian pious type.    I went tanning for the third time this morning, and upped my time to 9 minutes.  I'm being careful and I haven't gotten burned so far.  I don't think I'll do it after this week though, mainly because Jeff is allergic to the strong fragrance of my tanning oil.    I think that's all for now, making mac and cheese for lunch before Frosh comes over to go to the matinee.    Poll: Do you think it's time to start calling Frosh by his real name, Aaron?  After all, he is now a college grad who is about to be married?  Blessed Be!

      I really can't wait til we get a bigger place.  I love Jeff more than macaroni and cheese, and I love spending so much time with him, but it's really hard in a one bedroom apartment to say, " Hey can you go someplace else and not make any noise for the next 10 minutes?"  And I know he doesn't mind, but it's not the same as having a room of my own with a door that closes.  I work with some pretty funny people.  Today Vera and Charlene were playing a picture game that I was invited to join.  You divide up the paper into three sections (head, body, legs) and then three different people draw the sections without seeing what anyone else has drawn.  The highlight was the transsexual fish.  Head of a man, body of a woman, fish tail for legs.  That's all for now.  I'm working on supper.  We're having garlic chicken and noodles.  Don't looked shocked that I'm cooking, it all came from a box.  Blessed Be and Merry Part!

      Well, I know Jeff does from time to time.  But other than that I really don't think anyone does. Le Pout :(  I'm working on lesson two of the magick course I'm taking online.  Saying it that way makes me think of Quikspell, the magic correspondence course that Filch takes in Harry Potter.  Part of my assignment is to meditate and take notes every night.  I did it last night, and I'm going to go do tonight's work as soon as I post this, so I can be done before Jeff gets home.  This is one of those shitty weeks where we only have one day off together anyway, and life has intervened and made other plans Okay, finishing up here so I can meditate.  Harry Potter fans should read this - It's fan fiction but it's so good...  urlLink After The End   Merry Part and Blessed Be!

      Jeff and I are watched Kill Bill. :)  The Chinese pop in the restaurant in Olean todayThursday gave me a need to hear the 5-6-7-8's.   This was after we saw Spiderman 2, which I thought was great.  I'm glad they are making a third one, they set it up beautifully at the end.  Which contradicts something Sam Raimi said in an interview on MSN, but I think he just didn't want to give things away.  He said he didn't know which villain Spiderman would fight in the next movie, but unless they're just going to ignore the last 5 minutes of the sequel, anyone who's seen it knows who it's going to be.  So I think the next one has the potential to outdo the first two completely.  It will be more dramatic, more wrenching, in addition to having the improvements in effects that they showed since the first movie.  Now it's Saturday July 3rd.  I'm hoping the holiday means that the laundromat will be very empty.  I did get my car fixed, but we just drove all over creation to get my car back from Coudersport, and ran a bunch of errands yesterday, so I don't feel like the hour drive home (sorry folks!)  I feel like getting to use the internet, working on the online witchy course I'm taking, and focusing on cleaning this place up a bit today.  The dishes need done, and I think I might run the vacuum if I can get it out of the closet. (It may be jammed back behind boxes in such a way that only Jeff could get it out)  More later perhaps readers, until then Merry Part!

      Jeff scent-marked me before I left for work this morning.  He sprayed me with his cologne (Ralph Lauren, Polo Sport) and now I can smell it anytime I tip my head down. It makes me miss him!    It's the big long day at work.  I'm going to get Chinese for lunch.  Wonton soup.  Yummy.  I decided to drive here over Minard Run today rather than over Rew Hill.  (For non-Bradfordians who are somewhat familiar with the area, that means I took the road that turns left by the cemetary on South 219 rather than taking Rte 46 out by the Dari-Hut.)  Of course, this would be the weekend that they freshly tarred and chipped that road.  It was a couple days old, but riding up it with all those loose chips was still rather noisy.  I'm worried about damage to the bottom of my car.  After all, I've got 3 years of payments left on my Buick.  That's all for now, I am at work after all.    Merry Part and Blessed Be!

      Ray Stevens is awesome.  I have the title song there stuck in my head.  Jeff picked up more of his old videos from his parents house last weekend, and there were 4 Ray Stevens videos!  I wish I had access to the new TV Prod lab at Pitt, I'd dub copies for Keely.  She loves Ray Stevens.  When she does Mississippi Squirrel Revival she sings it so fast you can barely understand her.       Jeff and I went to Erie yesterday to see Allison and Grey and go to the used book store.  Jeff bought London By Night for Victorian age Vampire, and a couple old D&D premade adventures, and I got two new Witchcraft books.  We ate at Max & Ermas and had good burgers.  We were going to go to Tinseltown, but nothing we wanted to see was playing, so we packed it up and came home.  We stopped at Movie World and rented Shade, which was a cool movie about cheating at cards, with Stuart Townsend in it.  I love Stuart Townsend.  I would add him to Suzanne's Online Harem if it still existed.    Oh also, Allison's horse, Cameron, has a mysterious leg injury.  Everyone please keep a good thought out for this beautiful animal.  Al, I'll be lighting a candle and asking Epona for some help.   It's Sunday so I'm at work, so I'll end this here.  Merry Part and Blessed Be!

      I went down home ( urlLink to West Hickory )to see my family and do the laundry.  Apparently my future sister-in-law's wedding shower (which my mom and I weren't invited to) was yesterday. Hmph.  Anyway, Keely's toe is broken.  She had a seizure in the bathtub last week and broke it.  She has a walking cast on it now and her toes are all taped up so they can heal.  She came home and told me she had an x-ray, and they told her to hold still, and they took a picture of her bones.  She was so brave!  I'm home now, so I'm going to go spend time with Jeff.  So I'm cutting this short.  Becausing spending time with him is more important than blogging to you people.   Merry Part!

      I don't know where this summer went.  It seems like we were just telling Paul, Vita, Adam, Jamie and Hilary good-bye, and now it's only 30 days til they come back.  I like having all the Pitt kids back in town.  It's easier to pretend I'm not a townie then.  I think when Paul graduates maybe I'll have to hang up my polygonal dice and work on that whole being a grown- up thing... nah...   Other than that Jeff and I had a nice weekend.  We went to see The Village.  All I'll say is, Don't expect a big twist, and then you won't be disappointed.    Working 1-7 today in Coudersport.  It's looking like there's a strong chance I'll get hired on in RIG full-time.  Which should mean a pay raise, and 40 hrs a week.  But I don't want to count my chickens just yet, I could still end up on unemployment in October.    That's all for now.  Merry Part and Blessed Be!
