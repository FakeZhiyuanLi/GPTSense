      "We live in an age where entertainment persuades more often than rational argument; these days, political discussion has been transformed and conformed into another branch of media entertainment."  But when has politics every been clean and rational? Before the civil war, congressmen beat each other with canes.  In campaigns, it was common practice for politicians slander each others' wives and daughters. Take Rachel Robards, who became Andrew Jackson's wife in 1791.  Because she married Jackson before she was legally divorced from a former marriage, the supporters of President Adam in the election of 1828 came up with this ditty:  "Oh Andy! Oh Andy!  How many men have you hanged in your life? How many weddings make a wife?"  Which was a particularly nasty attack considering that Rachel was on her deathbed at the time (she would die shortly after the election).  At least nowadays, during their campaigns, politicians keep their attacks away from each other's families.  And though congressmen continue to verbally abuse each other, at least they keep their walking sticks or whatever else they hold in their hands pointed towards the ground and not at each other's heads.  That, as I see it, is progress.  The point is that politics has always remained and will always remain nasty, brutish, unpleasant and irrational.  The first political discussion in human history (between two cavemen) probably went something like this: Caveman 1:  "Me right, you wrong." Caveman 2:  "Me right,  you   wrong!" Caveman 1:  "No! You wrong!" Caveman 2:  "No!  You  wrong!" Caveman 1:  "Me club! Me club you head!"   (Wham!)  And thus, politics was born.    (I'll respond to the other points you made in your post in a later post).    Thanks for reading, Zhong Lu

       urlLink This article  by Steve Waldman in  urlLink Slate  talks about how the increasing characterization of the Democratic Party as being the "Secularist party" isn't quite so accurate.  African-Americans, for instance, are actually quite conservative on social issues such as gay marriage and abortion, and are among the most active of churchgoers--and yet they tend to overwhelmingly vote Democratic.  One might also include the union-supporting/lower middle class voters, who make up a large part of the military and are openly patriotic in ways that might embarass an elite liberal here in the Northeast.  (Increasingly, though, many in this group are shifting to the GOP for those cultural reasons: there's  urlLink a new book out  that talks about the GOP's popularity in Kansas and how people vote against their economic self-interest.)  Waldman points out that this is going to spell trouble for John Kerry, who doesn't seem comfortable talking about religion, and if he's uncomfortable with religious language, "then he's uncomfortable with Americans."    While I'm wary of polls about religion, I think he's onto something.  I think the punditocracy that buys into the idea of the GOP being the  urlLink Party of God  and the Dems being the  urlLink Party of Secularists  is being a bit myopic with that actual constituencies of the Democratic and Republican parties.  Here in the Washington area, it's easy to hear only the loudest activists and lobbyists for the various interest groups that compete for attention, and in a city full of think tanks and people devoted entirely to politics, the tone of the debate is naturally ideological.    But the truth is, given that we only have two major political parties, the Dems and the GOP are really less political parties than  coalitions  of various constituencies, who may not have any natural connection to one another.  The business interests and libertarian-minded people who make up a significant part of GOP donors and intellectual capital, for instance, are not necessarily natural allies of the religious right.  Nor, in the Democratic Party, do labor-union activists have much to do with hardcore environmentalists--in fact they are sometimes at loggerheads, so to speak.  The same is true of religion: what the poll cited by Waldman seems to indicate is that there are still many doctrinally and even morally conservative Christians within the Democratic Party.  The question then becomes: why do they not have more influence over the platforms taken by their party and their leaders?  Why, for instance, are there so few publically pro-life Democrats?  And in the GOP, why do the loudest voices belong to the (white) religious conservatives, who certainly don't represent everyone in the party?  (Look at Arnold Schwarzenegger, Christie Todd Whitman, or Rudy Giliuani, who are far from Christian Coalition-approved types.)  The answer to the question might reveal a lot about how political organization and how effective lobbying can lead a minority to become the official voice of these "big tent" parties.  It may be a symptom of the increasing polarization and antagonization in our political discourse.    Sometimes I wonder what America would look like if we had a multi-party parliamentary system, like European democracies.  Every constituency would have its own spokes-party.  Would extremism flourish in such circumstances, as they did in the early 20th century in Germany and Italy?  Perhaps one of the benefits of our broad two-party system, as clumsy as it is, is that it tends to elect muddle-headed mediocrities who can't afford to be too extreme in practice (their rhetoric is a different story).

      Zhong, I'm not sure whether a good political documentary's success depends just on whether people get mad or get happy about it.  Are the polarized responses based on genuine differences in worldview and on the interpretation of relevant facts, or, as it seemed in the case of  urlLink Michael Moore's movie , based on insinuation, guilt-by-association arguments, and manipulative heart-tugging (for leftists) or based on outright dismissal (for the right)?  Reading some of the outraged responses to a  urlLink mixed review  of  Fahrenheit 9/11  at  urlLink Christianity Today , it seems that many of the extreme responses are not the finest examples of political discourse, and for a movie that even some  urlLink Bush critics  and  urlLink prominent leftists  are bashing for its  urlLink inaccuracies .   That said,  Fahrenheit 9/11  is nonetheless an entertaining and well-made piece of propaganda.  In that sense it is a "good movie"--I enjoyed watching it as a well-paced film, even though I had a hard time accepting his arguments and the cheap shots.  At its best it was funny and it was also moving, especially when Moore stepped aside and let the grieving mother Lila Lipscomb speak for herself--though one got the sour taste in the mouth that her story was wrapped in a nakedly partisan account, calculated for maximum pathos.  The lack of overt manipulation becomes a kind of manipulation technique itself.  I still almost cried anyway.  How couldn't I?  The loss of a child is always a tragedy for a mother, especially one as devout and patriotic as her.  Also, I think it was good for the American people to see some raw unedited footage of Iraqi civilian casualties and soldiers facing danger and even being abusive (there's a part that must have been filmed before the Abu Gharib prison scandal, but seems to eerily foreshadow it).  This may, in fact, be the most valuable public service Moore has performed.  Too bad he had to show ONLY pictures of children flying kites, going to barber shops, smiling, and otherwise looking like the bee's knees in Baghdad prior to the bombing as contrast.  It almost makes one wonder whether he got those shots from Saddam Hussein's Ministry of Information.  So  Fahrenheit 9/11  is, in essence, one of the most effective campaign commercials ever made.  As long as audiences recognize that's what it is, then there won't be so much harm done.  The problem is not what the various partisans will think of it--they have their minds made up already.  The Right can be expected to vilify it (though check out this  urlLink surpisingly positive review from Fox News !), and many segments of the Left to praise it.  The problem is what happens to the not-too-well-informed "swing voter" who sees it and doesn't counterbalance it with opposing views.    Moore does a great job appealing to the emotions, bypassing rational argumentation much of the time, and when he does try to build a case he hits the viewer with a panoply of facts--he just forgets to connect them logically, as when he talks a lot about Bush family connections to the Saudis and fails to tie that in any real definitive way to Osama Bin Laden or Al Qaeda itself.  But we live in an age where entertainment persuades more often than rational argument; these days,  political discussion has been transformed and conformed into another branch of media entertainment.  Candidates have to appear on the late-night shows and the  urlLink Daily Show  to succeed in their campaigns, for instance.  And Moore may be a conspiracy-monger and a poor arguer, but he is a great entertainer.  That alone may get people to the polls to vote Bush out, after seeing all those humiliating shots of Administration figures being dolled up for the cameras and Bush sitting stunned when he learns of the attacks in New York.    In my opinion, there are many good reasons to unseat Bush this November.  But the arguments made in this movie are not among them.  I fear that if this movie becomes a decisive factor in a Kerry victory (the movie never mentions him, but it is certainly a more effective ad than the Kerry campaign could ever come up with), it will poison the way we talk about politics in the long run.

      Fahrenheit 911 has come out.  Judging from the scathing reviews from The Weekly Standard (a prominent conservative magazine), this must be a really good movie. Good political documentaries, by definition, should get people hopping either in anger or in glee.  And there's a lot of people hopping out there.  According to the polls, the nation has soured on the Iraqi war. 54% now say the war was a mistake.  (Finally)   On the other hand, everyone still agrees that we have to ride the war out. Which is good thing.    Meanwhile in Iraq, a bunch of people got blown up (again).  The occupation has ended (kind of).  Democracy and prosperity will flourish (probably not).  George Bush will be reelected (God forbid).  But then again, perhaps God is on Bush's side.  After all, he prays a lot more often than we do.  Which reminds me, does anyone actually know what is going on in Iraq? From the news I have read, it seems that in Iraq, a lot of police stations are getting bombed and a lot of schools are being built.  For every front-page Washington Post article that says: IRAQ CHAOTIC, POLICE STATION BOMBED there is a front-page Weekly Standard article which reads: IRAQ PROSPERING, ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BUILT.  I mean, man, it must suck to be a policemen there, but with all these schools being built and all, it must be awesome to be a student in Iraq.  Meanwhile in Europe and in Turkey, Bush is getting cozy with fellow European leaders.  I hope they succeed in patching up their differences. But it would have been better if he would've gotten cozy with them BEFORE the Iraq war.  That way, we could at least blame the troubles in Iraq on the French.    And finally, China and Japan continues their (literally) cold war for access to the Siberian oil fields in Russia.  The people from those two countries have a very odd history together:  They hate each other's guts, but they're always copying from one another.  First the Japanese copy Chinese culture, then, in more modern times, the Chinese copy Japanese technology.  The two countries have a little bit of a love-hate relationship going on.  Hopefully, they won't come to blows anytime soon.  Hope you enjoyed your week,  Zhong Lu

      Welcome!  This is the revamped Summa Dementia.  Things have changed a bit since the last time this site was active.  This is going to be a joint blog with not only me and Matt, but also several other contributors who are a part of a salon/philosophy club for all kinds of discussion, not only theology.  I hope this site will facilitate dialogue and interaction between all the members.  So once again, welcome . . . to the second coming of Summa Dementia!  If any of you want to see the contents of the old site, they are archived  urlLink here , on my personal website.   EDIT : for posterity's sake, and to bury the old Summa Dementia, here is this blog's original mission statement, composed in July 2002.  This website's mission is now broader than when it first started; it was once entirely devoted to theology and especially a critique of the current evangelical Protestant subculture.  Nevertheless, I wanted to take one last look at the beginnings of this blog:   Summa Dementia is a parody of Thomas Aquinas' classic work, Summa Theologica. For the sake of modesty, we are both [Matt Ng and me] assuming that these thoughts are a record of insanity rather than real theology. ;)  Our thoughts still reflect our conservative evangelical upbringings. However, we question much of the theology we find preached and practiced in our churches, so the tone of these pieces will sometimes be critical. We can't honestly offer concrete solutions at the moment--this blog is to help us grope toward a better vision to live as disciples of Christ today.   For me, that search still continues, though I am not quite as uncertain and, quite frankly, cynical as I was then.  I'll probably be using this site as a means to continue that journey.

      Bias is a very double-edged sword to bandy around. Biased people, because they're biased, tend to see unbiased people as biased.  In fact, biased people see everyone who doesn't agree with them as biased.  And unbiased people will naturally see biased people as biased. This was just posted on Yahoo:   urlLink Link to Yahoo   The general gist of it is that  urlLink Al Jazeera  is accused by both Americans and Arabic Muslims as biased.  Not to say that Al Jazeera has shed its taint of controversy. Reporters still anger Western viewers by calling slain Palestinian militants "martyrs" — and irk some Iraqis by referring to Iraqi insurgents as simply "killed." And one of its top war correspondents, former Afghanistan ( urlLink news  -  urlLink web sites ) and Iraq reporter Tayseer Allouni, is under house arrest in Spain on suspicion of ties to Al Qaeda.   But the most common complaints are also most vague — that Al Jazeera is biased, emotional or distorts the truth. "Between the lines," Katib calls those gripes. They have to do with Al Jazeera being a staunchly Arab station, a collection of journalists who inevitably and unapologetically view the U.S. "war on terror" through Arab, and usually Islamic, eyes. Al Jazeera appears to be the gadfly of the Middle East who pisses off governments but gets more and more popular every day. Which is wonderful. Media organizations should be gadflies- they exist in order to question the decisions of the rulers of countries and to hold them accountable.  P.S. neo-conservatives make two very interesting arguments: first they argue that the Middle East needs more democracy and press freedoms. Then they argue that Al Jazeera should be banned from Iraq because they're biased and their coverage supports the terrorists. These almost contradictory arguments are very revealing of their true attitudes towards democracy.

      I'd like to thank Zhong for his last  urlLink post  on atheism.   He writes:   My main point is this: when it comes to decision-making, humans are inherently illogical. We make our decisions on a mixture of emotions, logic, and contradictory statements- in other words, our intuition or gut feeling. I have (so far) not argued whether this decision-making process is right or wrong, I have merely argued that this is how we make our decisions.   It seems to me that Zhong is offering up an extremely limited conception of rationality, one that's almost a caricature of itself. Leaving aside the issue of whether it's "rational" to pursue an extremely narrow version of self-interest and the fact that any rational person is going to care whether or not they get beaten up, it seems to me that the major problem with Zhong's example of Data-reasoning is that people don't generally explicitly quantify probabilities. That's what makes Data sound so silly.  And for good reason. How did Zhong get the numbers Data uses? To get anything remotely like that kind of precision, he would need to perform a very complicated analysis of a vast quantity of data. Even leaving aside a score of other problems, like the fact that we wouldn't even know which calculations to perform if we had the time and capability, human beings don't have the memory capacity or computational power to analyze enough data to generate those kinds of probabilities.  Rationality is not free. Human beings aren't gods who can instantly draw out every logical implicationof everything they know. Thinking hard takes time, and that's time that's spent not doing the things that make life actually worth living, whether you think that's sex and drugs or prayer and worship. As limited beings, it is perfectly rational for us to make our day-to-day decisions on the basis of guesswork, intuition, and rules of thumb, because generally no other method is available to us, and even if it is, the benefits to doing so aren't very high compared to the costs. It's not worth adding up your monthly expenses down to the last penny when all you need is a rough estimate.  What I'm trying to say is that Zhong's version of rational decision-making is actually  irrational : if you generally tried to make your decisions that way, you would be worse off by just about any standard of value.  Nonetheless, there are circumstances where we do have the time and inclination to think things through carefully, or the logical conclusions are obvious, and sometimes getting the right answer is important enough that it's worth taking the time to do all the thinking the hard way. It seems natural and obvious that time runs at the same rate at all locations, and most of the time that assumption is perfectly fine, even for very precise applications. But when you're making decisions about the algorithm the Global Positioning System should use, you can't throw out General Relativity just to make your life easier. Because time flows marginally faster up in space than it does down here and the GPS uses very small time quantities to make its calculations, the GPS wouldn't work if you tried to use the time-runs-at-the-same-rate-everywhere approximation of classical physics.  Something similar is true in the law. If you're loaning a friend $15 because he has no cash while you're in a restaurant, there's no point in carefully negotiating terms of repayment and writing them down in a contract, because you trust your friend to repay you at some point and even if you both forget about it you're only losing $15. Going beyond that to negotiate terms that were to your maximal advantage would be even more foolish, because the time and energy it would take to do so (not to mention the expense of hiring the lawyers to write such a complicated contract) would be more time and expense than it's worth to either of you. When Giant Megacorp is getting a loan for $200 million from Giant Megabank, they need a hundred-page contract and a bunch of other documents, even though hiring the lawyers to negotiate all the details will probably cost another few million dollars.

      Just wanted to get this idea across (has someone else mentioned this before?):    I've noticed that even though this nation has become polarized, there is no political violence whatsoever.   Politicians no longer attack each other with fists- they restrict their outbursts of anger to verbal abuse.  The left may hate the right, but we don't have a John Brown running around Kansas killing southerners.  The labor unions may hate the corporations and vice versa, but despite all that hatred and bad words bandied around, both sides have grown very civilized compared to the Haymarket Riot (and other riot) days of the 19th and early 20th century.    We're beginning to use our mouths more then our fists.      Now, instead of beating up each other in real life, we beat up each other in the media and the Internet.   Don't like the other person's canidate?  Accuse him of something and start a scandal.  Don't like a particular person?  Write a nasty blog about him on the Internet.  Hate the left?  Then write for the National Review.   The media and the information world is getting nastier.    On the other hand, our workplaces and our real lives have  grown quite civilized.  Corporations and businesses stress professionalism.  This means: if you want a job, you treat each other with respect, and if you're going to yell at someone, you better be yelling about business and not politics.  From such an environment which restricts political discussion, two people of completely different political beliefs nowadays can get along very well at work.       Also, nowadays all children are being taught/brainwashed in schools on the evils of physical violence and the importance of being "nice."  Unfortunately, people by nature aren't "nice."  In the past, we were merely "nasty."  Now, after learning these lessons of "niceness" we become "nasty"  and  "anonymous." We don't want to make a scene- so instead of personally attacking someone in real life, we attack them anonymously through the Internet.

      Christians may limit themselves into believing that there is only God or atheism- but atheists limit themselves too: namely, they limit themselves by saying that there is no God at all.    But that's a side note. My main note is this:    Logic, testing, and scientific experimentiation is very good for analysis and reasoning, but these methods suck when one tries to use them to make a real life decision.    Take this (somewhat crude) example: From observation, I have come to the conclusion that Jane likes Tom.   Meanwile, I  know   I like Jane.  Thus, from logic, I deduct that I'll have a problem with Tom.    So far so good.  However, here comes the tricky question:    Should I kick Tom's ass or not?    If I was a Data (from Star Trek) with some human emotions, my decision-making process would be like this:     "The probability that I can beat Tom is 30%.  The probability that Jane will be impressed by mybeating of Tom is 60%.  Hence, if I attack Tom, there is a 18% probabilty that Jane will leave Tom and be with me.  On the other hand, from other calculations: if I do nothing, there is a 25% probability that Jane will leave Tom for me.  Thus, I should not try to beat up Tom."    Unfortunately (or fortunately) normal humans can't and won't think this way.  Our reasoning is more like this:    "I like Jane very very much.  And if I beat up Tom, Jane will be impressed and like me more.  On the other hand, Tom's so much stronger than I am. If I fight with him, I'm going to lose.  Besides, my mother told me that it's bad to fight with people.  Then again, my dad told me that I should be bold and fight for what is mine.  And Jane should be mine.  I'm really confused, should I fight Tom or not?"    My main point is this:  when it comes to decision-making, humans are inherently illogical.  We make our decisions on a mixture of emotions, logic, and contradictory statements- in other words, our intuition or gut feeling.  I have (so far) not argued whether this decision-making process is right or wrong, I have merely argued that this is how we make our decisions.    The problem I have with atheism is that it places too much emphasis on logic and reasoning.  Yes, logic is important, and yes, humans on average use too little of it.  But to place too much emphasis on logic and reasoning is wrong too.  To do so is to deny one's humanity.   How can atheism put logic and reasoning on such a high pedastel when atheists themselves use it so little for their daily decisions?  How is it possible to proclaim one philosophy and yet live by another?    Also,  "rational" atheism, in some ways, seems merely to be a reaction to "irrational" Christianity.  Like radical feminism, it tires to to correct one error by making another:     "Religious fanatics, out of their ignorant, irrational beliefs, have killed millions of people and have committed untold horrors.  To continue to hold onto these beliefs would only allow history to repeat itself.  Thus, for our sakes and for the sake of future generations, we will replace irrationality with rationality and illogic with logic so that the past cannot become the future."    The main error is that  atheism places too much emphasis on rationality.  As human beings, we can't be logical or rational.  To be too rational would be like trying to replace your soul with a brain.   It just doesn't work.      Anyways,  I really enjoy reading what you guys write.   And by the way, I don't want you to agree with me.  There is no point in arguing with someone who agrees with you.      Thanks,    Zhong Lu

      I haven't read the whole article so I'll only make a short note (need sleep right now):    The interesting thing about Americans is that Americans initially know almost nothing about everything. But the moment some crisis comes up in some part of the world, Americans suddenly begin knowing a lot about it.     For example: most Americans before 9/11 probably thought Shiites was some type of mushroom and that Sunnis was a bunch of happy, dancing people. But after 9/11 and the beginning of the Iraq war, the two words have become part of America's vocabulary. Though most of us still can't differentiate between a Sunni and Shiite, we now know the important things about them: namely, what they are, where they are, and what their relationship to each other is.

      Gender roles exist only if one chooses to believe in them.   Now that women can support the household with her job,  men today can actually say to their wives: "I'm leaving my job to take care of the kids."  In the past, he couldn't say something like that because then, his family would starve.    Look, though society can influence a person's decision, society doesn't give a damn what a person actually  chooses to do (provided that what the person does doesn't hurt society).  The only people who would care are his parents, his friends and his family.  And if that man's friends won't accept his decision to remain at home, then these friends aren't really friends.  And if that man's parents objects, well, heck, he has his own family to support him.

      The feminists that I know (or knew) aren't ideological feminists, but personal feminists.  They want to go out and do something useful in the world- so they naturally attached themselves to a philosophy which runs counter all that crap about "a women's role is in the house."    But I don't think they would mind if another woman chooses to stay at home.   Most feminists, like Christians, are personal femininsts and not ideologues.  There is a vocal minority of feminists screaming: " women are better," but they're no different then the Jerry Falwells and Pat Robertsons of the Christian right.   Feminism, like "black power,"  is slowly losing its original radicalism because its core principles (e.g. men and women should have the same oppurtunities) are being integrated into mainstream society.   One need only watch Powerpuff girls or Sex in the City to understand how much the men-women relationship in US society has changed over the last 40 years.    On the issue of men:  The relationship between men and women is still in flux.  But, as women move into what was formerly a "man's world," men can start moving into what was the "woman's world" (i.e. the house and the school).   Though women will initially be given more oppurtunites, everything will balance out in the end.   Granted that there is a lot more talk today about girlpower then boy-power, but I think that is perfectly fair and justified considering our history of treating women as second-class humans.  Some feminists are rather radical- but on the other hand, men have been dissing women for thousands of years, so I think it's healthy to give women an oppurtunity to diss men.

      Now that I have been working in the private sector 9:00-5:30 plus 1 to 1:30 hours commuting each way for a few weeks, I've been thinking more about the ways in which gender roles are oppressive of men. Although I like my job, it's pretty easy to see the reasons why not everyone would want to work full time. For example, you're being monitored and have a limited number of times you can go to see the doctor, since that must come out of your sick or vacation time, insurance considerations notwithstanding. You have to be in a particular place at a particular time for at least eight hours every day.    Although I don't much like children, I can see scores of benefits that could come with staying home full time to care for your own. On top of the instrincic benefits of getting to spend time with your children and do everything you can to turn them into people who will be happy, successful, and virtuous (in alphabetical order), you have a certain amount of flexibility in your schedule and have time to read, especially once your children are in preschool. I may be overstating the time benefits here, but I list them because they'd be things that would be really important to me, so I think of them first.    Yet, as Warren Farrell pointed out long ago in  urlLink The Myth of Male Power , while women can freely work full-time, part-time, or no-time as their preferences and circumstances permit, the only option for a man that our society regards as acceptable is to hold a full-time job. There are househusbands these days, but they're still extremely rare. Montgomery County, MD, where I grew up, is a pretty liberal area, and Swarthmore College, which I attended, is very far left, yet I have never met a househusband or anyone who tells me that they know one. I'm not sure how widespread the pheonomenon is even among gay males , who are more accostumed to breaking with gender expectations (I'm barely active in the "gay community, so I don't know this kind of thing.)     It seems to me that this restriction of the options available to fully half of our society has got to count as a major injustice, despite the advantages men have in making it to the top of the career ladder. (I believe research presently indicates that men and women with the same education and experience are paid about equally.) Yet the feminist movement has not, so far as I know, been vigorous about making this point. In one way this is understandable, since their concern is improving the lives of women. Nonetheless, the fact that there is a movement dedicated to ensuring that women have access to the same advantages and opportunities as men do, but not vice versa, seems to me to convey a pretty strong message.    Looked at this way the women's movement comes to seem almost mysoginistic. At least during my lifetime, the public face of feminism has been demanding stronger anti-discrimination protections in the workplace, childcare for working mothers, and the like. Those are all fine things, but the message I have absorbed through my liberal upbringing is that for a woman, a career choice is the  best  choice. Is that what feminism has come to - telling women that the roles our society associates with women are unworthy and the roles our society associates with men are? (DISCLAIMER: I don't know much about feminism, so the above may be based on that misunderstanding.)    Of course, the state of gender roles now is far superior to what it was in the past, and there is still a lot to be done even by conventional feminist standards. But that doesn't change the fact that gender roles for men are still tightly restrictive and men face other serious problems in our society.  I haven't even touched on issues like what Farrell calls the "glass cellar" that keeps millions of poor men working dangerous jobs in poor conditions, from which women are largely absent, or the fact that our society considers men's lives to be much less valuable than women's.  When Uma Thurman can slice a hundred male samuari to bits onscreen in  urlLink Kill Bill: Volume 1 , in good fun, but when was the last time you saw female extras slaughtered onscreen  en masse ?  Men are more likely to be the victim of  violent crime - in 2000 (the only year for which I could quickly find  urlLink statistics  more than three times as many men were murdered as women.  Yet nothing is said about this at all!

       urlLink This lengthy article  by Bruce Bawer in the  urlLink Hudson Review  is, I think, a necessary corrective to the automatic assumption that European anti-Americanism is founded upon genuine observation and insight.  The assertions that some European apologists make for their "communitarian" societies over rampant "American individualism" are shown to be rooted in the far less savory history of European collectivism and the tyrannies they spawned.  An informative read.    I'm still thinking about the atheism debate started by Elliot and Zhong, so my response to that will be forthcoming.  I've turned to linking interesting articles for the meantime.

      Zhong asks:     If strong atheists believe that the existence of Gods is unprovable, why do they come to the conclusion that God does not exist? In other words, why do strong atheists place so much emphasis on the importance of observation and experimentation?     For   starters, it would be pretty odd if atheists thought the existence of God was   provable.  As for observation and experimentation, I think the correct answer is largely sociological: contemporary Western atheism is largely the product of the Enlightenment, with all attendant the philosophical baggage.  Consequently atheist culture tends to look skeptically on things like intuition or "spirituality."    If what Zhong is really asking for is why atheists place emphasis on observation and experiment  rather than faith , I can't speak for all of us, but I can speak for myself.   Faith (where defined as belief in the absence of evidence) always strikes me as horrendously arbitrary.  Christians will often tend to speak as if there were only two options: the Christian God and atheism.   To my mind, this is an extremely limited view of the potential universes: there is an infinite array of possible gods, all the way from Zeus & Co. to God', which is exactly like the God of fundamentalist Christianity except that he's playing a nasty trick and saves the sinners and sends the believers to eternal torment in Hell.   Even this doesn't come close to delimiting the possibilities: there are lots of bizarre ways the world could be that don't involve ultra-powerful conscious beings.  If we must pick a god to have faith in, why is it God and not God', or some kind of non-conscious Fate?    All that I can see being left to do is to try to map out the picture of the world that best fits the evidence we have available to us.  This doesn't constitute a "proof," of course - we could always turn out to be wrong - but my view of the evidence doesn't support any supernatural beings, or have a giant gaping hole that obviously needs  some  god to fill it.  Hence no gods.

       urlLink The Post, in big headlines , reports that the 9/11 Commission found that the government underestimated the threat of Al-Qaeda, and such negligence led to the attacks. Tell us something we didn't know already.    I like the subheadline: "president calls the report 'constructive.'"    EDIT: The report is actually very thorough and even contains a list of ten missed opportunities during both the Clinton and Bush presidencies to stop al-Qaeda. I shouldn't have sounded so blase. The highly readable, understandable, and concise executive summary of the report is  urlLink here  (PDF format).

      I found  urlLink this article  at Foreign Policy to be very amusing. Perhaps we can also divide "European" attitudes from "American" attitudes in the same way we talk about "red" and "blue" regions in American politics. Because metrosexuals are characteristically "blue" while manly men, and aggressive Bush administration policies, are "red".     Then again, Ah-nold just called some of his colleagues  urlLink girly men .  And while he's Republican, he's not a Bush administration type of Republican.      EDIT: the article is rather fawning of Europe, more than to my liking.  Like do they really give more aid to poor countries?  France and Germany right now are  urlLink contributing very very little  to help out with the Darfur crisis in Sudan, for instance, compared to the United States--and neither the US or Europe or the UN are doing nearly enough to stop anywhere from 300,000-1 million people from dying.  That's not metrosexual leadership; that's criminal negligence.

      Let us, for the sake of the argument, assume that the existence of Gods is unprovable.  "Thus," a strong atheist would say, "because we cannot observe or test the existence of Gods, we must deny that any Gods exist."  Do I have express your views correctly?  If so, my question is:  If strong atheists believe that the existence of Gods is unprovable, why do they come to the conclusion that God does not exist?  In other words, why do strong atheists place so much emphasis on the importance of observation and experimentation?    This sounds cliched, but: do you believe that there are things out there that cannot by explained by logics and the scientific method?  If so, where would you categorize these objects?  I put them in the "unknowable" branch- things that cannot be proved to exist or not exist: thus, they'll be left as they are.

      One other link:  urlLink http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Front_Page/FG13Aa03.html   There is a lot of nonsense in the Asia Times Online.  But the way they write their nonsense, is very charming and appealing. And besides, not everything they write is nonsense.    My take on George Bush is that he is a tragic hero who tries to do his best but in the end, only makes things worse.  He really wanted to make the world a safer place- but his flaws, his stubborness and his lack of foresight, would ultimately doom his efforts.

      John: "Well, I am pro-choice."  Sam:  "Well,  I  am pro-life." Tom:  "Well,  I  am both pro-life and pro-choice."   John and Sam stops and looks at Tom as if he was an idiot.  "What, what?  What did I say wrong?" asks Tom.  "I like staying alive and I like choosing things, so what's wrong with being both pro-life and pro-choice?"  The moral of the story?  There is none.  Except perhaps that using catchwords and cliches is a sign of intellectual laziness.  The problem though isn't the words themselves as much as the fact that a lot of people (and perhaps us too) are unwilling to analyze their own beliefs. After all, what we believe in must be true, so why should we question it?  Also, any idea can be expressed in a positive and a negative way (e.g. "Bush is steadfast", or "Bush is obstinate").  The key to cut through the word bias is to ignore the words altogether and focus on the ideas within the sentence. However, that is a lot easier to do in writing then in an actual conversation.  So I think your idea, Elliot, of expressing your views using the other side's words is a great idea.  It helps keep the emotions in check and allows actual discussion.

      I was reading this  urlLink Washington Post article  (free registration required) about how mainline Protestant denominations are starting to use radio and TV advertising to draw in new congregants, and I ran into this paragraph quoting an Episcopalilan:   "We think this could be a very divisive election," England said.  "We're saying to people, 'if you're fed up with all the divisions, you might want to take a look at us, because we're in the business of inclusion, not division.'"   From context, it looks like Edwards may be trying to say something like,    Here in the Episcopal Church, we feel that our common identity as Christians is more important than our political beliefs, so you should feel free to come to our church no matter who you're voting for.   Yet the final clause - "we're in the business of inclusion, not division" - makes it sound like he's saying   We are a left-wing, gay-friendly church.   It never ceases to amaze me how perfectly ordinary words get so strongly taken over by political movements that merely using them is tantamount to expressing a political stand.   Diversity ,  tolerance ,  inclusion , and  choice  have all been taken over by the left.   Values ,  family ,  faith , and  morality  are all right-wing words.  I think this is a particularly deplorable trend, because it's so inimical to real dialogue between people with different opinions, something that our politics is in desperate need of.  At the extreme, in today's debates about gay and lesbian issues, there is nothing remotely like a neutral language available.  As soon as you say "gays and lesbians" or "homosexuals," it's clear which side.  This is tremendously off-putting to people who disagree, which, in turn means that nobody really listens to each others' arguments.  (The problem is worse on this issue, since one side's arguments are almost universally rationalizations for raw bigotry, but I think the point is clear.)  There are lots of people in the middle who haven't made up their minds, but the absence of a neutral language makes it impossible for someone to express a middle-ground position without taking a stand.  The same is true of affirmative action/racial preferences or abortion, to the point where people sometimes act as if the code words had no meaning beyond their code-word status.  Pro-deathers will often talk about "a woman's right to choose" without even mentioning what it is that she's choosing.   Racial preferences  has become so tied up in the affirmative action debate that Eugene Volokh winds up writing  urlLink posts  criticizing Paul Craig Roberts for writing as if there were no racial preferences in the Jim Crow South - and yet everyone knows exactly what Roberts means.  My personal form of rebellion against this trend is sometimes to make an effort to describe my own position in the terms of the other side, although I'm not yet at the point where I'm willing to say,   I'm in favor of allowing homosexuals to "marry."   And, as some of you have probably noticed by now, I make a point of describing the sides in the abortion debate as "anti-choice" and "pro-death."

      But you see, Bush may have the right idea here on terrorism.  Yes, Iraq is now a mess and we may have made things worse.  But Saddam is evil, and getting rid of him is a good deed.    But, but you see, the whole problem with this admnistration is that they're so stupidly stubborn.  Great leaders comprimise on little things in order to get the big things.  They unite people in order to achieve their larger goals.    This administration however, won't comprimise on anything-unless they're forced to, by circumstances.  If the war on terrorism is so important, why is Bush allowing the Republicans to ram the Bills down the Democrats throats?  Couldn't he have comprimised on the Medicare Bill and on similar bills in order to lower parisan rancor and build unity?  He says over and over again that success on terrorism is the most important objective for America, so why won't he comprimise on domestic agendas (e.g. Medicare Bills, tax cuts, etc. etc.) so that he can get the support to win the more important war on terrorism? Isn't it the goal of a president at war to unite, and not divide?  Look, a lot of the blame for the current rancor can also be attributed on people like Michael Moore and the left.  Their partisanship only makes things worse.  But still, the president is the CEO of the country and it is his responsibility to unite  the country to fight the war on terror.  By being so stubborn on everything, not just foreign policy and terrorsim, he is only making things worse for himself.  He is hurting his own war on terrorism.

      Sometimes a movie's quality can be judged by the antipathy it stirs up on the other side.  Though some conservatives (e.g. the Bush administration) are wisely keeping their mouths shut about the movie, a few other conservatives have now become obsessed with Micheal Moore.  Go to www.theweeklystandard.com and look for the author Matt Labash located on the left of the web page.  Last week, he wrote three articles of pure vituperation against Moore.  Also, on TV, Joe Scarborough of Scarborough Country has attacked Moore's movie, for I think the last 3 weeks.  The movie must have a certain quality to it in order to draw such anger and hatred.  To be fair, I might add that Bush too must have a certain quality to him which draws such hatred from the left.  (And similarly, Clinton too, though the people who hated him were from the right).  Hatred is much more flattering than apathy, and in some cases, is even more flattering then praise.    About the movie itself:   The facts                       D- The cinematics                  A Raising Troubling Questions     B+ Propaganda                      A Overall                         B  I don't know about you, but I snoozed through the whole middle part about conspiracies about Bush and Saudi Arabia connections.  That part was boredom and nonsense combined.  Micheal, in reply to some of the article where you mentioned the possible effect of this movie on swing voters: as I see it, if a swing voter is silly enough to be influenced by Moore's semi-propaganda/2-hour long-atack-ad-against-the-president, then he can also be influenced by Republican propaganda and attack ads.  Thus, it is better to get to these swing voters first with our propaganda before the Republicans get to them with theirs.  Politics is war and consequentially, the doctrine of pre-emptive strike applies to elections as well.  The left should attack the right before the right attacks them.    After all, conservatives has been bashing Clinton for the past 12 years and the Bush admnistration has been bashing Democrats for the last 3.  So it is perfectly fair and justified for the left to give back as good as they got.  Granted, debate and politics suffer from the partisanship, but the US will survive this bout of political nastiness as it has survived so many others in the past.  Thus, for us spectators, we should sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.

        Safe Harbor for Churches?   You know, after thinking about it, I don't think I have too many original thoughts to offer on the  urlLink Safe Harbor for Churches  issue.   urlLink The bill has died in committee anyways , and after reading the  urlLink IRS letter  that  urlLink I linked to below , I think I've pretty much come to the conclusion that I support the status quo rules: ministers, leaders, and other individuals in churches are allowed to express whatever political opinions they wish, and can even invite candidates to their churches for non-campaign related functions.  Non-profit organizations, however, are not allowed to explicitly endorse specific candidates or campaign for them.  I realize there is something of a principle involved here: doesn't full political speech rights include the right to say, "I support one candidate over another, and we as a church ought to do the same"?  But I think there is a palpable difference between, say, an individual minister making an endorsement, and an institution doing the same--an institution has far more mobilizing resources, not to mention money, than most individuals.  Those institutions remain tax-free to carry out a particular mission in society.  It would be bad, in my opinion, if candidates were more tempted to use religious organizations as tax-free bases of support.  Churches could become just another stomping ground for politicians, and a kind of free advertising and campaigning, to boot.    Furthermore, I think about the potential effect of allowing endorsements.  If churches, as churches, were allowed to endorse specific candidates--even if they are not "actively campaigning," say with funds--this can upset a delicate balance.  I can easily see politicians going for the official endorsement of a denomination or a particular influential church body, perhaps with underhanded financial dealings or other shady tactics . . . the potential for corruption, not to mention bitter political divisions, within churches is just so massive.  The way things stand right now is a good compromise between allowing religious authorities free political speech and ensuring that government and churches serve their proper roles in society.  People sometimes forget that the separation of church and state can protect the church, too--in this case from egregious forms of political corruption.     Political Pigeonholes?   When I first read  urlLink Zhong's categorization of the various factions of the Republican Party , it seemed a bit overgeneralized and vague at first, though it is accurate on the whole.  And I too thought, "where are the libertarians?" but Elliot has  urlLink helpfully appended his thoughts  on that issue.  I'd like to offer some of my own addenda, though, especially about the Religious Right.  First, it's not true that the Religious Right is not concerned with foreign policy.   The Religious Right has led the way in  urlLink the support of Israel and its policies  toward Palestinians; they have been the most fervent supporters of the War on Terror; and, in recent years, they have become outspoken voices in protesting religious persecution in places like Sudan.  Much of the reason that Bush has pledged $20 billion to help the African AIDS problem is not just because of  urlLink Bono and his efforts , but also due to pressure from religious conservatives like Jesse Helms.  So whatever one thinks about the Religious Right, they are definitely involved in foreign policy matters.    On domestic issues, certainly the focus is on issues that revolve around social morality--gay marriage, abortion, and the like.  And that isn't  urlLink domestic policy?   I do recall, however, that James Dobson of  urlLink Focus on the Family  is in favor of "tax cuts for families."  I'm not sure that makes them supply-side economists, but given that so many Religious Right figures are  urlLink still enamored of Ronald Reagan , perhaps it does.    Finally, the religious right does sometimes feel like they are outsiders, even within the Republican Party.  James Dobson has constantly threatened to bolt the Republican Party for the extreme  urlLink Constitution Party , for instance, if they don't act fast enough on abortion and gay marriage.  The biggest tension in the GOP, thus, would not necessarily be between the neo-cons and the traditional conservatives, though there has been some fractures over Iraq and the big spending.  The biggest tension seems to be the Religious Right, and everyone else.  Their numbers and activism, however, give them a disproportionate amount of power and voice within the modern GOP.  One might see the constant threat to leave as being a political ploy to get everybody in line, but it does reflect some of the alienation many religious conservatives feel with an American society that seems less and less in touch with the faith.

      I very much enjoyed Zhong's post on the Republican party.  I wanted to add one more group to the list: the libertarians.  Granted, libertarians have their own  urlLink party , but in practice it's only for the true believers.  Lots of libertarians and libertarian-leaning folks vote for major-party candidates, and most of them vote Republican.  Even though many libertarians will profess to see little difference between the two parties, they're in practice part of the coalition of the Right.    While there aren't many strict libertarians, the people who are drawn to libertarianism tend to be intelligent and well-off, which makes them vastly overrepresented in intellectual and political circles.  The  urlLink Cato Institute  is one of the best-funded and most-cited think tanks in Washington, for example.  Eugene Volokh, a moderate libertarian, is a highly regarded professor of constitutional law (and a  urlLink party-line Republican .)  The result of this is that libertarian lines of thinking have a much greater impact on policy than sheer numbers would dictate.  The religious right has millions of troops it can stir up if it wants to (although I hear they've been having more trouble than they expected getting the faithful up in arms about gay marriage); libertarians just have their elites.  (In this way they're like the neocons.)  Much has been said recently about how the Republican-libertarian alliance is disintegrating today, on account of Bush Jr. being extremely anti-libertarian, what with the interventionist warfare, the giant budget deficits, the refusal to cut spending, and the lack of action on campaign pledges such as Social Security privatization.  There's no point in rehashing what others have said on this issue, since I have nothing new to add.

      This is actually a tangential response to several of the earlier blogs by Micheal.  From what I have read or heard, everyone in the Republican party is sympathetic to or supports at least one of these 3 groups: the neo-conservatives, the old conservatives (or "original conservatives"), and the religious right.  A successful Republican businessman would probably be a member of the old conservative sect. A anti-abortion activist would be a member of the religous right.  Krauthhammer, the columnist, is a member of the neo-conservatives.  The biggest tension is between the neo-conservatives and the old conservatives. The neo-conservatives, the vanguard of the modern Republican party, are willing to sacrfice "small government" in America favor of "democracy" in foreign nations. They believe the greatest threat to America comes from authoritarian foreign states that sponsor terrorism. They also believe that America has the power to bring democracy to these countries and thus eliminate these threats.  Old conservatives, on the other hand, have less faith in the power of America to change foreign nations. They're highly skeptical that the neo-conservatives' dream can ever come true. Though they acknowledge terrorism to be a threat, they see the growing size and power of the government to be an even greater threat to America. To them, government impinges on liberty and saps America's resourcefulness and individualism. What they want is a return to the pre-Roosevelt days where the government played a much smaller role in people's lives. Naturally, this desire conflicts with the neo-con's willingness to accept a larger US government.  Recently, old conservatives have become critical of neo-conservatives. George Will, a prominent old-conservative columnist, have written articles in the Washington Post criticizing neo-cons for abandoning the ideals of small government. Neo-cons have taken the criticism in silence. They understand the worries of these "old-timers" but believe that in this new era, America has bigger things (e.g. terrorism) to worry about.  The third group, the religious right, are the foot soldiers, the rabble-rousers, and the "soul" of the Republican party. Most Republicans are a part of, or (culturally and morally) allied to, the religious right. Trademarks of this group include: strong, uncomprimising moral values, and a nationalism rooted in the Christian faith.  It is this faith-based nationalism that separates the religious right and the religious Democrats. Many Democrats are as religous and nationalistic as the Republicans. However, Democrats, for the most part, carefully distinguish between God and America. Ask John Kerry how his Catholicism will affect his presidency, and he'll stumble out with the phrase: "separation of church and state." George Bush on the other hand can say outright: "God plays a role in my decisions." This "awkwardness" of the Democrats is the reason why the Republicans can claim both mantles as emblems for their party. Only a Republican can say with utter conviction: "America is the country of God."  Neo-conservatives have many ideas about improving American foreign policies, but have almost no ideas at all with regards to domestic policy. Old conservative groups (e.g. Cato Institute), on the other hand, focuses primarily on the economy and ignores foreign policy altogether unless it impacts domestic policy. The religious right ignores both domestic and foriegn policy; provided that the government do not infringe upon their values. For example, an anti-abortion activist probably wouldn't care too much about stuff like the optimal size of the US government or whether Congress should cut taxes. However, he would jump in rage if Congress legalizes trimester abortions.  This specialization is a major reason why the Republican party cannot be successfully broken into multiple parties. For example, if a group of the religious right broke from the Republican party to form their own party, they would immediately be in trouble because they won't have a platform on important issues like tax cuts or preemptive strikes. The separatist group may be able to influence others on moral issues, but they won't ever reach national stature because they won't have any foriegn or domestic policy platforms of their own. This situation is similar for neo-conservatives and old conservatives. The three groups must hang together or sink separately. Naturally, they choose to hang together.

      QUOTE OF THE DAY:   [H]ere's my ideal plan for the Kerry campaign. At an upcoming rally, an anti-Kerry protestor starts to burn an American flag. Kerry leaps down from the podium and starts strangling the protestor with his bare hands, then hurls him to the ground and rescues the flag. In the course of putting out the fire, he suffers minor burns that, the campaign announces, will force him to be hospitalized and inaccessible to the media and the public until mid-October. In the meantime, Edwards is dispatched to present the Democratic message for the next three and half months.   -Jonathan Chait,  urlLink TNR Online

      Good, choice, I say.  Edwards was the most marketable of all the candidates in the Democratic field during the primaries.  This brings some personality balance into the Kerry ticket that was missing before, especially with Edwards' Southern appeal and focus on domestic issues, rather than foreign policy (to which he is a novice).  I'll be doing my response to Safe Harbor for Churches later today for sure.  I ended up doing other things last night (planning out a short film series with a filmmaker friend, for one).   EDIT (11:45 PM):  maybe not . . . gosh, life just gets in the way sometimes.  :)  I should have some down time at work tomorrow morning to do it.

      Micheal, where do you find stuff like this?  I really need to learn from you about finding materials on the Internet.  This IRS document is really good stuff.   One of the key paragraphs in the letter is:   "Thus, under Federal tax law tax-exempt organizations are prohibited from endorsing any canidates... Even activities that encourage people to vote for or against a particular canidate on the basis of nonpartisan criteria violate the political campaign prohibition of section 501(c)(3)."  It's the last sentence that's troublesome.  What does "nonpartisan criteria" mean?  For example, if the pastors of a church consistently attack people who support gay marriage, and one of the canidates happens to support gay marriage, then does it mean that the church is particapating in "nonpartisan criteria that encourage people to vote against a particular canidate?" Does this sentence mean that the Catholic Church should lose its tax exempt status because it's trying to excommunicate Kerry over abortion? If interpreted broadly like that, every church would lose its tax-exempt status.    However, I think the letter is interpreting 501(c)(3) of the tax code a little to broadly.  http://www.irs.gov/charities/charitable/article/0,,id=96099,00.html is the relevant website, and there, 501(c)(3) says:   "In addition, [the charity] may not attempt to influence legislation as a substantial part of its activities and it may not participate at all in campaign activity for or against political candidates."  If interpreted more strictly, what this passage is saying is that churches, in order to remain tax-exempt, cannot conduct voter registration for a specific party, raise money for a specific party, or overtly support a specific party.  However, a church can "influence legislation" (or an election) provided that these "influencing legislation" activities are a small minority, and not a substantial minority, of the church's activities.  Interpreted this way, the Catholic church can excommunicate Kerry and remain tax-exempt at the same time because excommunication is not a "substantial part" of the church's activities.

      I thought this would be a useful resource in the ongoing discussion about what political speech churches should be allowed before losing their tax-exempt status.  (Click on the title of the post--it's a PDF that requires Adobe Acrobat.)  I should have my response by tonight.

      I too have read the Washington Post article about the Bush campaign's attempts to enlist conservative churches to help out in its campaign.  The article also mentions that Democrats already use African American churches as rallying points for their masses.  Thus, it is only fair that all churches, whether Democrat or Republican, be (or cannot be) used as rallying places for the faithful, without changing the tax status of the church.    However, any politician who uses churches as campaign bases would have gone too far.  Politicians should be able to make speeches at churches, but the moment that he/she uses the church for any more than just making speeches (e.g. fundraising), that is the moment the church is to be treated and taxed as a political organization instead of a church.    Pastors should be allowed to run the church however they wish to run it. Since pastors are tenured on the tacit agreement of the congregation, a pastor has the right to speak his mind on social and moral issues.  If members of the congregation don't like what they hear, they can always vote out the pastor or leave for a different church.    However, a caveat: pastors do not have the right to attack or glorify specific politicians.  Doing that would be crossing the line.

      Spiderman 2 is the best movie I'ver ever seen.    The cinematography, the love story, the action, and the humor.  And boy, what humor:  "I'm back! I'm back!" yells Peter Parker, leaping in the air between two 10 story buildings.  "My back! My back!" he yells when he falls flat on his face three seconds later.   And the love story... Kirsten Dunst is the loveliest woman in the world.  And she's a damn good actress as well.  The scenes between her and Peter Parker are... tremendous.  The way she looks at Peter Parker, and more importantly, the way Peter Parker looks at her; with his lost puppy dog expression and all.  What more is there to say?  You watch these two people and you just  feel  for them.  And finally, the other characters; the Aunt, the scurillious newspaper magnate-Jamison, the best friend, and the octopod bad guy- they all played their parts perfectly.  Dr. Octopus is one of the most real bad guy in a movie yet.  Conflicted, torn, and possessed, with his wife killed by his own experiment, he has earned the right to be placed in the bad guy hall of fame.  And he turns out to be not a good guy after all, which is what makes him all the more entrancing.    And of course the action, the special effects, the plot line...  But I've gushed enough. See the movie for yourself.  Zhong Lu

       urlLink This story  indicates that Michael Moore doesn't mind people pirating/downloading  urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11 .  Moreover, the distributor,  urlLink Lion's Gate Films , has also said they will take a hands-off approach.  Interesting.  I guess he really does seem to care only that the message gets out . . . shame that it's such a distorted one though.  Entertainment value aside.  I wonder whether this whether this will have any long term effect on copyright law.  Probably not, but I do find it interesting--even commendable in a way--that someone with the top-selling film in the box office is willing to come out and possibly piss off a lot of movie industry people (and this after having the project shot down by Disney).  It warms my geek heart, Moore's politics notwithstanding.  The  urlLink denizens of Slashdot agree .  Or, most likely, the anti-Bush partisans are so eager to get the man out of office, they'll try anything.  I won't post direct download links, but if you're interested, you can try searching on  urlLink Suprnova.org .

      First off, welcome, Elliot!  There are two more members who are supposed to join, and hopefully they will soon.   urlLink Heresy : I agree with Zhong on this, though of course I speak as a non-Catholic.  The Catholic Church, much like the way our political parties are (were?), is a "big tent" church, with 25-30 million members in the United States alone.  In fact, traditionally, it was associated with the Democratic Party, and has a tradition of populist and working-class political activism.  While I doubt any real heresy proceedings will be launched against Kerry--these days, heresy trials are mostly for errant bishops and theologians like Hans Kung, and properly so--the timing is definitely all wrong.  I doubt the bishops will move to act on the suit, but if they do, it's impossible to see it as anything other than a political, rather than moral or theological, move.    In agreement with the Catholic Church, I am of the opinion that abortion is a grave moral evil.  I believe that the Church is not only well within its rights to deny Eucharist to those who advocate and enact policies inconsistent with fundamental Christian morality, but is theologically justified as well.  Nevertheless, timing and prudence matter in any moral decision.  Even the Vatican has called for caution on the matter, and in all things we are to be "as wise as snakes and harmless as doves."  And it is also true that abortion is not the only issue that contributes to Pope John Paul II's characterization of our "culture of death."  See this  urlLink rather extreme editorial  in  urlLink Sojourners --he goes a little too far, but he does have a point--after all, didn't the Pope and the bishops declare the Iraq war to be evil as well?  To target abortion rights advocates alone for excommunication may be morally justified, but is tactically foolish at this time, in that it plays straight into partisan hands and drags the affairs of the Church into the world in unseemly ways.  I like  urlLink this guy's  view on how the Church should respond to abortion.  I'll post later on Elliot's comments about the church political advocacy law.

      Idiots! Does the Catholic Church wish to drive its members away?  Yes, religions should take their religions seriously, but to do something like this at a time like now?  If the members of the church wish to excommunicate Kerry, they should do so after the election.  That way, they could uphold their morals and stay out of the gunbattles that will erupt between the Republicans and the Democrats this summer.  If this excommunication proceeding continues, the  Catholic church will only be hurting itself.

      Since this is my first post and I don't even know all of my co-bloggers yet, I should open by introducing myself.  I'm Elliot Reed, a legal assistant in  urlLink Baker & McKenzie LLP's  corporate group.  I'm thinking about going to law school with the eventual goal of being a law professor, or maybe a judge, or maybe an appellate litigator.  I graduated from  urlLink Swarthmore College  last year in philosophy, with a minor in economics.  I also have a "minor" in physics, but this is only because I wimped out at the very end, so I completed almost all of the major.  Unlike in econ, where I completed the absolute minimum number of courses necessary for the minor.  Unlike my co-bloggers, I am an atheist.  Or, to be more precise, I'm a  urlLink strong atheist : I have a positive conviction that no gods exist.  I may blog more about this some other time, but not now.  Philosophically, I'm something of an anti-philosopher, in that I think most philosophical questions are meaningless or have no correct answer.  Again, more about this some other time.  Politically, I'm a moderate liberal.  I used to be a libertarian (actually, I used to be an Objectivist), but Swarthmore, which is a hyper-lefty place, slowly turned me leftwards.  On cultural issues, I am very lefty, aside from my somewhat mixed feelings about abortion.  On social issues, I feel strongly that "society" has an obligation to provide for the needy in one way or another, but if the government can make it easier for private organizations to do that as well or better than the government, which doesn't have a very good track record on this issue, I'm all for it.  Fiscally, I'm fairly conservative but also a big believer in progressive taxation, although not necessarily progressive income taxation.  Continuing with the introduction, my Myers-Briggs personality type is  urlLink INTP .  I'm something of a geek: I love math, geeky board games, science fiction novels, and so on, but don't really like computers.  I'm gay.   SAFE HARBOR ON CHURCHES   I am having mixed thoughts about the  urlLink safe harbor on churches  provision that's been introduced to the tax bill.  Of course, this may already have passed or been defeated, so what I say here may be irrelevant.  What has happened is that the Bush administration has been trying to enlist conservative churches to assist in its re-election effort.  As tax-exempt organizations, churches are forbidden from engaging in political advocacy of any sort, so liberals have started pushing for the government agencies that monitor this kind of thing to rescind the tax-exempt status of churches that engage in such advocacy.  As pre-emptive defensive measure, someone in the House introduced an amendment to another bill that would allow churches (and only churches, although presumably also synagouges, mosques, meetinghouses, and so on) to have three "unintentional" violations of the advocacy provision without being forced to pay taxes.  Leaving aside the absurdity of the "unintentional" element of this measure:  Part of me wants to say that religious organizations and non-religious organizations should be treated evenhandedly by the government.  In fact, I'm fairly sympathetic to the  urlLink claim  that the  urlLink Constitution   requires it.  For example, if the government provides funds for private schools, religious and non-religious schools should both be eligible, provided that they meet whatever other requirements the government might set, such as meeting certain curricular standards.  This seems to entail that churches should labor under the same tax rules as other nonprofit corporations, including the political advocacy restriction.  On the other hand, religious activism has a long and vibrant tradition in U.S. politics, and for good reason.  If religion has something substantial to say about morality, justice, and what we owe one another, it seems only natural that religious leaders and organizations would sometimes want to engage in activism or advocacy.  Indeed, they might argue that their religion  requires  them to.  For example, a conservative Christian preacher might feel that she has an obligation as a Christian to preach against abortion and urge her congregation to vote against pro-death politicians.  Liberal preachers in Massachussets might feel a similar compulsion to argue that their congregations should vote against the Massachussets constitutional amendment banning gay marriage.  If a preacher does this kind of thing on a regular basis and the government starts stepping up the enforcement of the "no political advocacy" rule, as secular liberals want, the church might lose its tax-exempt status.  Since most churches would find it very difficult to survive financially without being tax-exempt, especially because contributions would no longer be tax-deductible, enforcing the tax laws could amount to a de facto ban on political preaching or other advocacy.  To me, this seems like it could be a substantial restriction of religious freedom, insofar as religious leaders feel that their religion has important implications for politics, as many do.  So I'm feeling torn between my desire for equal treatment and my desire not to infringe on religious liberty, which seems like it could at least sometimes require political advocacy.  I am pretty sure that letting churches become de facto campaign committes, as the Bush campaign seems to want, would probably be going too far, but can't offer any principled reason for this position.

      I'm sticking my head out on this one:  I think that an American attack on the Mosque used by Sadr militiamen as a base will not lead to widespread condemnation in Iraq. I think our military has managed to show to Iraqis that the mosque is being used inappropriately and thus, warrants it being attacked. Furthermore, the military has shown sufficient reticence in this affair- and has demonstrated that an attack on the Mosque is not an attack on Islam in general.  In other words, I believe that this is the right time to take down Sadr.

      Newest article in the New York Times:               Iraqi Leader Orders Temporary Closing of Al Jazeera's Bureau in Baghdad  According to Allawi, Al Jazeera's coverage of kidnappers and kidnappees are encouraging insurgents to kidnap more.  Thus, he's shutting Al Jazeera down.  The article also mentioned that Saddam also shut down Al Jazeera in 2002.  I've noticed that no one likes Al Jazeera except the people who watch it.

      When it comes to business, law, and science, intuition sucks.  In math, we're taught to never trust our intuition because it's almost always wrong.   Mathematics made the greatest advances in the 19th century when intuition was formally scrapped and was replaced by a system of rigorous proofs.  Other fields such as physics and biology made similar progress as well when old "intuitive" beliefs were retested and replaced by the scientific method.  I agree with Elliot- intuition and gut feeling is flawed, especially when analyzing the external world around us.  But even though intuition has its flaws, that doesn't mean intuition is unimportant or should be ignored altogether.  In fact, I might add, intuition and gut feeling play, or should play,  a central role in some of our most important life decisions.  Yes, thinking things out is always good, but sometimes thinking things out is also useless.  Take marriage for example: The most successful marriages are those between two rational people who know and understand themselves and their partners.  Before they married, they should already know a great deal about each other's strengths and flaws.  They would have already planned beforehand what their future lives together would be like- where they should live, how many children they want, and how much money they plan to make.  Once they've made their goals, they would stick to it, or change should both partners choose to change.  Disagreements would lead to comprimises and overall, the two people would lead a very successful and stable marriage.  But ask them why they married in the first place and they'll answer: We loved each other.  Which is a very revealing answer because it shows where the true bedrock of the marriage lies- not in the planning or logic, but from the emotion of love itself.  Yes, planning and "thinking things over" can strengthen emotions and is vitally important for a successful marriage.  But the initial emotion, the primary reason why they married in the first place,  didn't come from logic or planning but from somewhere else.  The potential husband may have weighed his options and evaluated, on a piece of paper, the strengths and weaknessess of his future wife.  But when it comes to actually making the important decision: "should I marry her or not?"- he would have made that decision not from these slips of paper, which won't help him at all, but from what he truly felt was the right thing to do.   So you see, though our logical and analytical abilities- in other words, our minds- are vital to our well-being, it is ultimately "our heart" that makes the decisions for us.  When we decide which beliefs to believe in, just as we decide which person to marry with, this decision is not made from rationality but from our intuition.  Atheists feel like they should be atheists just as Christians feel like they should be Christians.  So as I see it, the true bedrock of atheism lies not in all that talk about "the importance of scientific method, etc. etc." but in the actual gut feeling or belief that there is no god at all.  And simliarly, the true bedrock of Christianity lies not in all those apologetic proofs about the existence of God, but in the actual gut feeling that there is a God and that that God is a Christian God.  Atheism and Christianity are perfectly wonderful things to believe in, but the rationale that some atheists and Chrstians give for why they are atheists or Christians is flawed.  People are atheists and Christians because they feel like they should be so, not because they think that they should be so.
