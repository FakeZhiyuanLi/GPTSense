      Cthulhu is a large green being which resembles a human with the head of a squid, huge bat-wings, and long talons (true, that doesn't really resemble a human, but bear with me here). According to H. P. Lovecraft's story "The Call of Cthulhu", Cthulhu rests in a tomb in the city of  urlLink R'lyeh , which sank beneath the Pacific Ocean aeons ago. Cthulhu is dead but not truly dead, as he and his fellow inhabitants of R'lyeh sleep the aeons away. (Cthulhu is generally thought of as a "he" for some reason.) From time to time R'lyeh comes to the surface, and Cthulhu's dreams influence sensitive individuals across the globe to depict his image, slay, and found cults dedicated to him. In the past, R'lyeh has sunk after a short time, but the day will soon come when it rises to the surface permanently and great Cthulhu strides across a world thrown into chaos and anarchy from his telepathic sendings.  Here's Cthulhu.&nbsp; Pretty gross.  &nbsp; I never had a dream with that dude in it, but I did have a dream with a Night Gaunt.&nbsp; Shit those things are dangerous!&nbsp; Here's what Lovecraft had to say about them.&nbsp; Imagine if your own most personal horrible person ever mutated into some fucked up dragon beast of doom.&nbsp; That's a Night gaunt! Beyond description, a horrible eviscerious talon armored nightmare! Aaggh!!  Out of what crypt they crawl, I cannot tell, But every night I see the rubbery things, Black, horned, and slender, with membraneous wings, And tails that bear the bifid barb of hell. They come in legions on the north wind's swell, With obscene clutch that titillates and stings, Snatching me off on monstrous voyagings To grey worlds hidden deep in nightmare's well. Over the jagged peaks of Thok they sweep, Heedless of all cries I try to make, And down the nether pits to that foul lake Where the puffed shoggoths splash in doubtful sleep. But oh! If only they would make some sound, Or wear a face where faces should be found!  - H.P. Lovecraft: Fungi from Yuggoth - Sonnet XX. Night-Gaunts   A number of stories by Lovecraft deal with dreamworlds and other such nonsense.&nbsp; This is the Cthulhu Mythos basically. Here's a FAQ about all this at  urlLink http://members.tripod.com/~danharms/part1.htm#q11   In 8th grade I wrote a 12 page paper about Lovecraft.&nbsp; 12 pages was a lot for a little 14 year old, err 13, or whatever.  Oh yeah and my other favorite, Nyarlathotep.&nbsp;  urlLink http://www.psci.net/nyarla/Masks%20of%20Nyarlathotep.htm &nbsp;has some pretty great MIDI music to read along to.  "And it was then that Nyarlathotep came out of Egypt. Who he was, none could tell, but he was of the old native blood and looked like a Pharaoh. The fellahin knelt when they saw him, yet could not say why. He said he had risen up out of the blackness of twenty-seven centuries, and that he had heard messages from places not on this planet. Into the lands of civilization came Nyarlathotep, swarthy, slender, and sinister, always buying strange instruments of glass and metal and combining them into instruments yet stranger. He spoke much of the sciences - of electricity and psychology - and gave exhibitions of power which sent his spectators away speechless, yet which swelled his fame to exceeding magnitude. Men advised one another to see Nyarlathotep, and shuddered. And where Nyarlathotep went, rest vanished; for the small hours were rent with the screams of a nightmare."&nbsp; ~Lovecraft "Nyarlathotep"  &nbsp;  Wooohh....an Outer God...woooh... badass huh?  So yeah, this is the 2nd part of the incredibly lame intro of this probably even more lame personal dream log.&nbsp; Figured I'd make it somewhat interesting at first.&nbsp; We'll see, maybe this will make one of those articles you read about in the Times about some idiot's new Weblog.&nbsp; Whatever, "blog" still sounds stupid.&nbsp; Enjoy.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I can't tell you much, except that they may hatch out of your thumb at any given moment.&nbsp; Don't&nbsp; worry, they aren't bringing death to you, only to others.&nbsp; However it hurts like hell when they do hatch out.&nbsp; Right on the fingerprint side.&nbsp; Don't pull on it, it'll hurt more.&nbsp; Let it come out on its own.&nbsp; That hurts!&nbsp; Mash it up anyway, stupid fucker ruining my dream!   Here's some facts about hornets/wasps: Like bumblebees, the wasp colony dies in winter and the newly mated queens hibernate. In spring, the queen builds a nest, made from 'paper' composed of chewed wood fibres, in hollow trees, roof spaces, compost heaps etc. Larvae are fed on insects. In summer, wasps seek out sources of sugar and can become a nuisance especially at picnics. Wasps can sting and will defend their nests with vigour.   In several hornet species, no workers are produced. Instead the female lays its eggs in the nests of other wasps, where the eggs hatch and the young are fed.&nbsp;&nbsp;   However, wasps are beneficial - one worker wasp can collect over 100 aphids in one day.   100 aphids! Holy cow!    urlLink     Mash that!&nbsp;
