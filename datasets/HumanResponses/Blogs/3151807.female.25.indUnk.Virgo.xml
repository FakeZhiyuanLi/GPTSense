      Hello... I guess I was thinking I should really have a way to record my thought, ideas and things for my upcoming wedding 3.19.05. So... I thought this was a perfect way to to it. My fiance's name is Wil and we got engaged 10.10.03, after about 6 years of being together. I am really excited about planning our wedding, and creating the wedding I have always dreamed of. So far we have the date 3.19.05, the location for the ceremony and reception,  urlLink San Jose Fairmont , and a photographer,  urlLink Kristian Iskandar ,  urlLink   the officiant will be our Pastor, Pastor Ronald Hirsch... there are a gazllion things to to but most things are already lined up, just need to put deposits down...  we do have a wedding website on theknot.com:  urlLink http://www.theknot.com/ourwedding/JacquelineMamayson&WilfredDelBarrio

      It's Memorial Day and I am here at work... but will probably leave around noon... no one's here so its really quiet and I can get my work done!  Last nite we has our engagement photo shoot.  We took at the pictures at the Metreon area Downtown San Francisco. I was harder than I thought...we had to pose and all this stuff while other people were around, kinda wierd!  anyhow, got a estimate from Shawna from Flower Divas, and I am serioulsy thinking about booking her for the wedding flowers, she is nice, has good ideas, and she got me the estimate in like one day... I guess I can meet up with a couple other ones before deciding...

      I have a headache, and it won't go away... I hate that! I am here at work, but things are a little slow right now... just mailed out my deposit for chair covers and sashes for the wedding to Cynthia Lai, she offered a really good deal for the chair covers and sashes, so I just went ahead with her.  Now all the big things are winding down to a smaller list... I also just got an email from the Videographer that I am very interested in  urlLink (Monster Crayons)  that they are sedning me a new demo video, can't wait to check it out. We need a DJ too, I guess the only one that I am looking into is  urlLink Spintronix DJ's ... but I guess I can do more research on that...  I am really excited about the wedding and it seems like it is really far away... like 9 more months... I think I have done a lot so far, nearly all the big things are done, I am kinda happy about that, so I can work on the details and little things to make eveything special!  Hope eveything doesn't go WAAAAY over budget, although I think we have kinda went over (oops)... so we'll see... but Wil has assured me everything will be fine, and that we can make it happen... I love how he eases my stress =]

      It is Sunday... I am home... work tomorrow (nooooo) I am not looking forward to work AT ALL. This weekend didn't do much, just relaxed, Fri watched Farhineit 911, it was a cool documentary... I would recommend this to anyone to see... Sat, went to Wil's friends baby's baptism, and ate at Lee's Buffet, where they had the lunch celebration... it was GOOOOD. After that we went to  urlLink Union Street Papery  to check out wedding invitations. It was kinda pricy there, but at leat now I know what they offer. There was a  urlLink Simayof  there (jeweler where Wil got my engagement ring), so I got my ring cleaned, now it is sooo shiney and sparkly... I love getting it cleaned, cause afterwards it looks bigger, cause it's all clean... hehehe...  I did win a tiered cake card box on ebay... it's cute! That's about it for wedding stuff. I have to put a deposit down for the chair covers and sashes soon (by June 30th) and I have an appt. with a day of coordinator June 11th... I have to book those two pretty soon...  Still need a DJ and Videographer... then I will be done with all the "big stuff"... then it will be all about the DETAILS!!!

      I am at work as usual... have a chair covers appt tonight in San Jose! not so exciting but I know I have to go. Was working on Save the Date magnets last night on Photoshop Elements, it was pretty easy! Also, just got an address embosser from ebay. All I need now is the cardstock and envelopes from  urlLink Papersource , magnet sheets to print on, from ebay...  Things are coming together, I *think* I am ahead of schedule.   Work is kinda slow right now, I am kinda rethinking things, for my career, and I just don't know what to do. I need to give it more thought, and maybe I will come to a conclusion or something.  Hope my dress comes in soon, I just want to try it on again!

      I have had one of those weeks where things just didn't go sooo smoothly, especially at work, I am just glad it is Friday and the weekend is here! I did get some weding stuff done, finally bought the bridemaids dresses for the girls, from www.netbride.com, Bill Levkoff Style #500 in Euro Pink... they look "hot" as my friend/bridemaid Rachel emailed me when she saw them. I am glad they look "in style"   We might watch that movie "Dodgeball" tonight, and dinner, geeeez I am so hungry. Wil's mom emailed me to help plan Karen's baby shower (Wil's sister) gosh I didn't realize that I love planning parties... finding favors, decos, etc... I love it! Can't wait until everthing comes together for the wedding, I am trying to have everything with my "personal touch"   9 more months and can't wait! (ahhh Mrs. Del Barrio) what a thought....nice...   Well I still have check more things of my checklist and keep being that organized, do-it-yourself, detail oriented bride to be!

      okie... I am still sick, I guess I will be staying home tonight... and my eye hurts, the left one... feels all swollen, like i got a bug bite on my eye lid... or got punched... but I definately didn't get punched...  This weekend I just plan on relaxing, and getting stuff done at my apt. I need to catch up on some cleaning and organizing... also I need to find things to donate for the Shelter Network. Later on tonight me, Wil, Kim, Rodericko, might get some crepes at Le Creperie in San Bruno... lookin' foward to that! GOOOOD FOOOOD = GOOOD TIIIMES  Right now I am at work, of course, tired as hell... it seems this day is going by too slowly... maybe after lunch it will pick up? hope so.... I am really looking forward to going to SD mid Aug... I get to see Marisa and Shavon, gosh I miss my friends that have moved away... SD should be fun, wish I could stay longer but I have to be back to work Monday... Hope we get to hit up a beach, haven't been to the beach in so long!  Other than that... no trips planned, I woudl really like to go somewhere, but I am trying to conserve money for wedding stuff, and I don't know if I have anymore paid days off here at work... oh well, I know that in about 9 months, I will be on a really nice vacation,  my honeymoon...

      Today's been cool so far, I have a little cold, and hopefully it does get any worse... I feel like curling up in my bed, and watching TV right now... that woudl be nice...  Last nite I was working on those darn save the dates... they are going to take forever to do, since we are printing all of them out, printing all the magnets out, embossing the envelope, and sticking the magnet to the card, sealing all of them, addressesing all of em' too... wow so many steps, but they are really my labor of love...  They turned out exactly as I wanted just cause I design them and all... hopefully people will really like them when they see em'...   The other day some girl on the knot message board recognized me... she said she saw me at Club Six... kinda wierd, cause it was kinda dark in there... I guess she recognized my picture in my bio...   I am really looking forward to the weekend, I don't have much planned, but I am looking forward to relaxing and sleeping in Saturday morn... that will be so nice! But, I have to continue my save the dates project... (sat afternoon), maybe while Wil goes riding, cause he hasn't gone in while so I am sure he'll want to Saturday. That will give me a chance to get some stuff done...  &nbsp;

      Hello, its Monday morning... my throat kinda hurts, sucks! Must have gotten it from Kim cause she had a sore throat too. This weekend was cool Friday I went out with Kim and Jackie, we had crepes at La Creperie de Mundo. They shared 3 crepes, and I had 2... seems like a lot but the second one I had was really small, just butter and sugar... Then we went to Club Six in the city, it was cool. It reminded me of the old days at Agenda. They played similar music there and had the same type vibe.&nbsp; The people were kinda different though... Saturday, another baby shower. It was fun, yet tiring, kinda glad baby showers are over now... now I can relax! Sunday, just church and I helped Wil out with his open house, after that went to Best Buy, then got some more crepes! SOOOO GOOOOD! yum!  Now it's Monday, I am chillin' at work, just me and the "new guy" It is wrong of me to be annoyed of the "new guy?" He keeps on asking me dumb questions and making weird comments?!? I think he has a problem... for reals... (gosh I am so mean)  Right now listening to Amerie "All I Have" one of my fav. CD's... makes me feel at home in this hell hole...hahha! maybe I'll do some work in a few minutes? mmmm....&nbsp; I not really that motivated here, no one is here and I am soooo lazy right now!  Dam! I forgot my cell phone at home and my PDA, I feel lost... I don't even know what is on my TO DO LIST... gosh this sucks, can't even look at that...

      its been a busy, busy week! Finally it is Friday... later tonight Kim and Jackie are coming over and we will have Boba and Crepes...wehoohooo, and go somewhere in the City. Yesterday, me and Wil, ate at Windy City Pizza, went to Hillsdale Mall, and Target. We bought Mike and Karen a baby shower preset a,  urlLink Graco Dreamer Pack 'n Play . I bought some other stuff for them at Old Navy, but I don't know if I will give it to them.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is not much going on right now, just waiting for this work day to be over!   Just on the Knot message boards as usual... that is such a great board... I have gotten so many ideas from it. I don't know where i would be in planning if it wasn't for the boards. I have dicovered great vendors without paying a million-gazillion dollars! The only vendors I didn't get refered from the board was my photographer and my makeup person, thats it! Eveything else, I give the board credit to...   I was thinking of my dress today... hopefully it comes soon... i wonder how it will look on me? Cause the one I tried on was Ivory instead of White.... CAN'T WAIT!

      work has been ok today... got my paper from paper source, but it was the wrong kind! aerrrhhh! so I have to return them and order more, which I just did, cost more but oh well! Everytime I am on the Knot message boards, I get really inspired by other peoples do-it-yourself projects, can't wait to finally finish my save the dates... &nbsp; so much more to think about, what is mainly on my mind is the  invitations, menus, programs, and all the stationary  that I need to get for the wedding... also, the  details ! its all about the  details ... I am doing bathroom baskets, and I really want to make the guestbooktable/signboard really nice and pretty... &nbsp; sheesh soooo much to think about, but I need to take it once step at a time, and things will fall into place... only 10 more mintues or so til' I am outtie! gotta pcik up my pants from the alterations lady at Hillsdale Mall, can't pick up my magnets at the Post Office cause they close at 5:00pm, I guess I can do that at lunch tomorrow... &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Well it's Sunday and today started off really wierd... I work up with my alarm going off at 9:00ish.. and snoozed for like 2 times... I  FREAKED  out and thought it was Monday (I am such a retard) so I started panicing... loked at my cell phone and saw there was no call from work to ask me ..."where the hell are you.." mmm... though that was wierd, but continued on my delusion of thinking it was Monday. I just thought maybe they didn't have my cell phone #... kept on trying to call and call people and got nowhere... finally left a message to a lady at work telling her my alarm didn't go off...  &nbsp;  After that I raelized that is was SUNDAY! um-HELLO! so I realized I set my alarm for church NOT work, gosh I am sooo stupid! I was sooo relieved, but at the same time felt really dumb... so I left another voice mail for my co-worker telling her that I thought today was Monday... sheesh, I FEEL so dumb!!! Good thing she was the only person I left a message with... no it all made sense why no one was at their desk... ahhaha!  &nbsp;  This weekend was pretty tiring, Friday I don't think I did anything, just laundry, Saturday went to Mike and Karen's baby shower... it was fun, had lots of great food! I facilitated the games, so it was pretty tiring, good thing there was a mike for me to use! I didn't have to scream or anything, the mike did the trick...  &nbsp;  Sunday (wierd day) went to church, and went to San Jose. Wil and I went to Fry's and crossroads to get rid of our old clothes and after went to Valley Fair Mall to get Boba...  maaaan , we saw Crepes there too! wehohoo... too bad I could not have any, cause I ate waaaaay too much this weekend... The Boba was good though!  yummmeeee...  soooo, after that Best Buys... that's it now I am home relaxing and uploading pix... thinking of dinner...  what's to eats?   &nbsp;     New&nbsp;Photos...      urlLink    Ronnie's Visit &nbsp;&nbsp;         urlLink  Karen & Mike's Baby Shower     &nbsp;

      It's Friday, wehoohoo! Yes I love Fridays... Nothing much happing at work right now... after work I get to get my haircut, which I should have done a long time ago... sheesh, I have bad habit of putting things off until last minute,&nbsp; oh yeah, I have to do laundry tonight too (I always wait til' I really have to)  &nbsp;  What are my thoughts of today... mm... actually I am just happy right now, life is  great , work can be better, but that doesn't even faze me... I know someday things will be better in that department for me... I just have to trust in Him and just be thankful for what I have... hehe  &nbsp;  I saw Wil for lunch today, we ate leftovers from last night (thanks Jenn) sooo good! I love seeing him mid-day, cause it makes the day go faster and I just like it, I dunno... I guess maybe we will go to the movies later on tonight, hopefully my laundry does take forever...  &nbsp;  Wedding thoughts today:  Did I ever mention that I love being engaged? Geezzz if I haven't, I just wanna say that its such a great feeling... and there is on one else that can complete me like Wil. Gosh the word  Love  doesn't even explain what kind of feelings I have... its such a feeling that cannot compare to anything... I just feel extra special being engaged... haha kinda corney but I do, even though there's a million other people engaged at the moment, I just feel  SPECIAL.  Like a diamond in the rough... it's really like winning the lottery, but without money, like trying to climb a mountain, over and over again, but finally after years, you finally got to the top... ahhhhh what a great feeling!!!

      its monday... nothing too exciting... had a great weekend!   Friday: Went to Sang Tung in the City, I think I ate too much there, but its sooo good, before that Wil, Ronnie and Me went to get Boba at Tapioca Express and went to Tower... I didn't do anything after that, just went home and slept, I had to get up early for the next day.  Saturday: got up 9am, I had an appt with Michelle Thornton (Wedding Coordinator) in Concord, dang that was far! She was really cool and it seemed like she was more organized, more dependable than the other person I met with. After that I just chilled at home, Wil and his friends went riding to Monterey to see motorcycle races... When they got home we had some Pho... I was supposed to go out with Kim and Jackie, but they didn't know what they were going to do untyil late and I felt kinda lazy... after dinner we all went to get Crepes...so GOOD! I think I am literally addicted crepes and boba... so just called it a night after that...  Sunday: a relaxing day... juts watched and waited Ronnie get a tattoo at DC Tattoos in Daly City, went to Serramonte Mall for a little shopping, there ws a new Hollister store there so I bought a few things, Wil got shoes and a shirt at Macy's... after that we all headed to Morton's in the city... good steak... but very pricey...  overall it was a cool weekend... its gonna be sad when Ronnie leaves tomorrow =[ I am planing to go to San Diego next month...whoohooo! Aug 13-15 or sumpthin' should be cool, gonna visit Marisa and Shavon is going to (from LV)... I miss my friends... =/ gotta get that plane tciket soon, before it sells out! good things I still have a free ticket from southwest, make things a little cheaper (YES)

      Its friday! wehoohoo! I had a busy week... Ronnie is here this week so we went out like everday this week.  Tonight I have no idea what we are doing... Sat. I think they are going riding and we are all going to  urlLink City Beach  at night, Sun. we are going to  urlLink Morton's Steakhouse  in the city, and Mon. Ronnie leaves.  I have a meeting with  urlLink Michelle Thornton , a wedding coordinator on Saturday morning in Concord. Hopefully things work out because I didn't have a good feeling about the last one I met up with. Not that she can't do her job, just something about her didn't jive right with me... can't explain it?  I really want a Starbucks right now... but... I really do need to stay away from sugars I don't need.  Right now I am feeling bored... missing Wil, I just can't wait to see him later! Wish I could have lunch with him today, but him and Ronnie are probably going to Cycle Gear in the City...

      back from a long weekend, this morning I felt like I took too many sleeping pills, but I only took half of a tylenol PM... mmmmmm... yeha felt so dead. Right now work is kinda slow, kinda boring, but things are cool... This weekend was tiring, Friday went to  urlLink Agenda with Kim, Roxan, Jackie, and Keiana ... it was fun, Sat. just chilled and me and Wil picked up Ronnie a the airport, he will be here until the 14th. Ate at King Fish, tried to go to F & A's at Burlingame, but paying $10.00 wasn't too cool with us. Then went to Fridays where Wil and the guys just had drinks... Sun went to Pittsburg for a 4th of July BBQ, rode pocket bikes, the first 5 mins of riding, Wil crashed and got a bad case of road rash on his arm/elbow area... oh yeah and watched spiderman, but I fell asleep for about 75% of it, I guess I was tired. Mon went shopping with Kim on Haight... it was fun, saw lots of cute stuff especially the store  urlLink Ambiance , bought a purse there...Kim went crazy in this Bag store! haha! It was funny...  So that was my weekend, did not do one thing for the wedding, but I guess a girl has to take a break sometimes... but tonight I do have an appt. with a "day of coordinator" at 6:30pm... so I hope it goes well...

      Finally I got some stuff done! It was a busy day at work, but I found time to get some wedding things done.  I am all done with getting room blocks for out of town guests... Yes! So, they will have a choice to stay at The  urlLink Fairmont San Jose ,  urlLink San Jose Marriot Downtown , or the  urlLink Crowne Plaza San Jose . All these hotels are less than a mile away, I think all walking distance.  Still need to do  SOON   Hire DJ Register for Gifts Send Save the Dates Plan Rehersal Dinner Work on Invitations and Finalize Book Ceremony Muscians  supposedly I have to have all these things done by mid-Sept, but the Ceremony musicians I would like don't start booking until Dec. 2004 for 2005 wedding... soo.. we'll see... the other stuff I can take care of by then...  This Sat we are going to pass by The Fairmont to check out a wedding that will be there this Sat. I just wanna know how it looks like set up, I kinda forgot the details of the Regency Ballroom so it would be nice to take a look again...  Maybe I will try to get some registering done at Crate and Barrel, just the basic stuff that won't be gone after the season is over, I think it woudl be cool if we has all our registry done before the Save the Dates go out, cause people will look on our website ( urlLink www.jackieandwil.com ) and see there is nothing on the registry...  anyways off to contact Marriott for Rehersal Dinner info... =]

      It's way too early... my eyes hurt... argh!This weekend was relaxing....  Friday: Went to eat crepe, at Le Creperie, and went to see I Robot, it was pretty cool, better than I expected.  Saturday: I hung around the house, and went to Aveda at Hillsdale Mall and got some makeup... when Wil got home from riding, we went to get some dinner at Banana Island... then watched some Six Feet Under on DVD. Pretty laid back...  Sunday: Church, and had lunch with Wil's parents and talked about the wedding and what we still need to do... oh yeah and Wil took me to one of my favorite restaurants,  urlLink Tamarine . It was soooo good, I haven't been there since New Years Eve...  Monday: went to work, felt kinda sick... kinda busy since the Director of Catering isn't here and one of our Sales Managers isn't here either... did some laundry, went to work out, and thats it!  now it is Tuesday, ahhhh... another week going by. Right now I am tired, and I haven't been really doing much, I am just really tired...
