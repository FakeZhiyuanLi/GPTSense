      I was a killer  As a kid, I Bishwas Paudel grew in the most wonderful place in the whole god dam world. I am from the country of mountains, country of diverse ethnic groups, country of rich cultures and most importantly the country of my ancestors which is Nepal. It is the place where my ancestors grew and worked off their sweats and blood so they could provide a living for their family. I am proud to be of the grandson of those people. Taking about my early childhood, I used to enjoy hunting birds. Slingshots were bought from the cities and taken to the villages where I could find a huge area for hunting. Hunting was one of my favorite hobby, sport or whatever you like to call it. “One feels such an excitement and energy going through his body when he/she is really close to the enemy and is about to face it.” One of my quotes which I have used to motivate and keep track of my mind from going some other place. “Killing bird is not right. What has the bird done to you, why do you want to kill innocent creature?” One of the many expressions that left my mom’s mouth in my childhood. Even though my mom everyday used to remind these words to me, I never listened to her. I was a killer.

      What do you want to be in your future?   As I am walking through the paths of school, I see myself flying in the majestic skies of the ocean and the space. Becoming a pilot is my destination. “Sky is the limit.” One of the most used expressions in our daily lives. But if sky is the limit: “Is space over the limit?” This is one of the questions I have been asking to myself. In the future, or about couple of years from now, most of the planes would have the ability to go beyond the imagination of our tiny human minds. I want to ride and enjoy the high rich life of a pilot. It is in my ambition to explore the universe. The purpose of my existence in this world is to be a pilot.

      How to make the city of Windsor a better and secure place to live in  Located in Canada, the city of Windsor acts as a border between the United States of America and Canada. The Ambassador Bridge which was built almost 100 years ago connects the city of Windsor and city of Detroit. Because of increased factories and industries, pollution is taking place. The condition of the water of the Detroit River is degrading. Many steps should be taken to protect our world so generations to come may enjoy and live in this magnificent land. Factories producing smokes and other chemicals waste should be controlled. Treaties should be made with the United States which will stop the United States of America from polluting the air. “Windsor has the highest number of people suffering from heart disease.”  Security systems should installed in public places to track any threat posing material. By doing these things, we the resident of Windsor can make this city a better place to live in.

      About the Maoists of Nepal  Nepal which is also known as the most peaceful country in the world is facing many challenges. On February 12, 1996 the communist party of Nepal widely known as the Maoist has started a revolution in Nepal. Maoists call this war “people’s war” because they think that the outcome of this war will benefit citizens of Nepal. The main objective of Maoism is to end the monarchy system and to make new beneficial changes in the laws of Nepal. Even though this is a very good objective to be fulfilled, the Maoists are not using the best way to bring prosperity to the kingdom of Nepal. Maoists today say that they are fighting the “people war” but I believe they are doing a very lousy job.

      Does Anita need a laptop? Find out.  As human we tend to look forward for those things this makes our daily life easier. I have been appointed to investigate if my cousin, Anita Marahatta needs a laptop. I interviewed her on May 23, 2004. She told me that for her laptop is not a necessity but rather it is a “want.” She stated that her life would be more “comfortable” and “easier” with her owing a laptop. Anita is currently engaged in an Internet Website building course. She wants a laptop where she can work alone without having anyone to share the computer with. This sounds to me like that Anita wants a laptop just to make her life easier. But lets not forget that, isn’t this what all of us want? Don’t all us want to make our life easier? I can hear all of you cheering and saying “Yes.” What the hake! Let’s give Anita a laptop.

      Reasons for the hat being under the table  A few days ago, Ravi gave his “Nike” cap to Bibek. Bibek needed a cap because he was going outside when it was very hot. Bibek later decided that he didn’t need to wear it. Bibek asked to me if I would like to wear it. Having interest in caps I took the hat from Bibek and wore it. I should say I looked alright in the mirror. Thinking about the cap I totally forgot that I had made plans to go to the Saint Dannis Centre. Anita, my cousin called me and asked if I was ready to go. I had to do hurry up. I threw the cap which I was wearing, under the bed. I went to the Saint Dannis Centre and forgot all about the location of the cap. The cap probably stayed there for probably more than a week. Today, May 17, I finally found that cap. Ravi, the first cap-lord asked me why I ditched the cap. To answer his question I am writing this essay. I guess throwing the cap under the bed was one of the errors my mind made.

      Pigeons  According to the web dictionary a pigeon is a wild and domesticated birds having a heavy body and short legs. Well according to me, Mr. Bishwas Paudel a pigeon is most annoying bird ever to date. The reason I hate pigeons is because they crap all over the balcony and make retarded noise. All the pigeons should be caught and be send to a mental institution. I bet most of you would agree with my thesis. I have tried so much to get rid of these birds. Back in the days when I was young I used to have a slingshot with which I would snipe birds with. The name “PIGEON” was always in my head. I really wanted to hunt down this bird. Even though with my hard efforts, I kept missing and missing when I was firing rocks that went like bullets towards my prey. Because I didn’t get that bird that time I doesn’t mean that I have quit preying for this bird. Maybe one day I am going to finally seek revenge on this bird.      Whoever is reading this please don’t let the pigeon know that I am making plans to kill it.   Let’s keep it our little secret, OK?

      Pre-review. What might happen in the movie: Bend It like Beckham  In my opinion Bend it like Beckham is a great movie. Some of my collages have watched this movie and said to me that there is nothing more realistic than this movie. Because of this I have decided to watch this movie. Unfortunately, I was only able to watch the first ten minutes of the movie because of some technical problems. I think the movie “Bend It like Beckham” is about an Indian girl who is a pro in football and has a dream to become a football super-star. Unfortunately her mom thinks playing football is not the life of her daughter. Bechman struggles and finds her way to become the best soccer player to date of England. I think Bechman will get into lots of trouble for playing football without her mom’s permission. All I know is that this is going to be a great movie.     So, why don’t we watch it?

      How to stop erosion  Nepal is a very hilly country. More than 70% of Nepal’s land is in the Hilly region. Not long ago, Nepali people moved to the hilly region in a hope to find land which they can agriculture in. These people cut worked their blood and sweats off and they chopped the hills to make terrace. Terraces are used to protect land for erosion. When water falls in one section it then makes it’s way to another in a slow motion not causing any severe damage to the structure of land.

      The Best Laptop  Laptop is a portable computer small enough to use in your lap. Many of us today use laptops in a daily basis. Professions such as army, coast guard, marine, firemen, police, and construction require laptops for the job. Many companies have designed different kinds of laptops.      In my opinion the best laptop ever made is the Rocky Patriot I. Because of the laptop’s sheer strength, rust resistant, water, dust, fog proof cover, it is probably the best choice for most of us. I bet you have heard about someone whose laptop fell from the table and broke. And, I definitely don’t think you would want this to happen to your laptop. So, why not buy the “Rocky Patriot I.” This is laptop is also equipped with HDD Shock Mounts. The hard disk drives are all protected by shock absorbent membranes. The Ram Memory of the computer is over 512 MB. This laptop is a breakthrough in our world. If you are thinking of buying a laptop, this “Rocky Patriot I” is definitely the right laptop for you and your family.

      Calculator  According to Bibek, a calculator is a small machine that is used for mathematical calculations. Calculators are used to carry out some of the everyday mathematical calculations. For example, cashiers use calculator to find the sum of their host’s expenses. In our society, when a child is about four years old we send them to school. There our children learn how to write, speak and much more. One of the things they learn is math. Math is a science (or group of related sciences) dealing with the logic of quantity and shape and arrangement. Math problems are solved much quickly by using calculator. Many believe calculator is not a good way of solving problems but I disagree. In my opinion calculators are the pieces of technology ever built.

      Yahoo vs. Google’s Search Engine  A search engine can be defined as a program that indexes documents, and then attempts to match documents relevant to a user's search requests. Through the years, many people have created many different search engines using different algorithms.     One of the most popular search engines today are Google and Yahoo. Google launched on the internet about three years ago. It has gained popularity over millions of users. Yahoo has lost its fame throughout the years because google has taken over.     I think google search engine is the best search engine because it uses one of the best searching algorithms and the search engine works like a speeding bullet. Type in anything you want, Google will search 3 million web sites for you in less than 0.15 seconds. 15 Seconds if that’s not fast, what is? Yahoo is not even close to this number.

      Should I be blocked from accessing the Internet?  Internet, a computer “network consisting of a worldwide network of computer networks that use the TCP/IP network protocols to facilitate data transmission and exchange information.” Internet is a great source of good and bad information that can be viewed by those who have a computer and have access to the Internet.      In my opinion I should not be blocked from accessing the Internet because the Internet is the gateway to great knowledge. Some say Internet is bad and should be banned for teenagers. This statement is entirely incorrect. A teenager can explore the outer world by using the Internet. “One can learn more than he ever could by using the Internet.”   Internet is a source of information. Not allowing me to access the Internet is no different than not sending me to school. Internet can teach almost anyone a great deal. Hence, I should be allowed to access the Internet.

       Chatting Online  One of the most popular ways to communicate with the other today is to chat online. Microsoft creation’s Windows Messenger allows people all around the world who have access to the Internet to talk with their family, friends and coworkers. Chatting online is one of the many key points of a teenager. I like chatting online because it is a great source to communicate with my family and friends. There are many advantages of chatting online. For example: If I forget some homework, I can ask what the homework was. Not only I go online to chat about homework but I go online to talk to my relatives in Nepal. My relatives and I can talk back and fourth online. Almost everyone likes chatting online. Because of the aforementioned reasons, there are many advantages of chatting online.

Between Ultimate Frisbee and Football, I believe football is the best game. Not only I agree with Football being the best sport but thousands of fans of football all over the United States agree with me. Football a game of determination, strength, power, motivation and teamwork is one of the best games that exist today. Creator of the Ultimate Frisbee is a cheater because his game uses some aspects of football, soccer and basketball. The game of football is better because it is pure and hardcore.

      As part of Google's mission to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful, we're testing an email service called Gmail.   Gmail is a free, search-based webmail service that includes 1,000 megabytes (1 gigabyte) of storage. The backbone of Gmail is a powerful Google search engine that quickly recalls any message an account owner has ever sent or received. That means there's no need to file messages in order to find them again.   When Gmail displays an email, it automatically shows all the replies to that email as well, so users can view a message in the context of a conversation. There are no pop-ups or untargeted banner ads in Gmail, which places relevant text ads and links to related web pages adjacent to email messages.

      23. What do you think you should learn now that will come in handy, the rest of your life  The foremost thing I think I should learn today which will come in handy the rest of my life is writing. One can express his feeling, emotions and everything else by writing. There are many different ways of writing. Some of the most famous are essays, poems, stories and news articles. What I am writing right now is an essay. An essay is a group of sentence which describes a particular subject.      I have started writing essays daily since last month. My essay was poorly organized and structural when I first started writing. As time passed on as fast as a speeding bullet, I started writing better. My grammar, my organization of themes and paragraph structure all became better. Not only I have to write essay in home, but also I have to write essay in school in a daily basis. Writing essay is a very good habit because by writing anyone can express their opinions and views clearly.

      Tax or No Tax?  “Tax is a charge imposed by the government on people, entities, or on property in order to raise revenue.” The definition of terms describes the word “tax” like this. By charging tax to the people, government makes its money to run the government, to fund for school, to pay for our health care and so on. Some people are devising a plan to end government from collecting our tax money. Not paying tax sounds profiting but it is rather______. If the people don’t pay tax there is no way the government can afford run the government which will carry this beautiful country of our towards depression. There is just one answer to this question, taxing the people is the only answer.

      Suggest Bibek on whether or not he should finish all essays today.  Adaptation in the world we live in is very essential. Just because the dinosaurs could not adapt in this world doesn’t mean that we human can’t adapt either. Mr. Paudel should finish his essays today because it is his responsibility to finish one essay a day. Since, he skipped doing one essay; he is being punished by given 3 essays to complete. Mr. Paudel really enjoys watching television, watching movies and especially playing that game, Grand Theft Auto. If he does all of his assignment today there is a greater probability that he is going to get to play the game, Grand Theft Auto in the future. Bibek can do whatever he wishes to do; this is just a suggestion from his brother.

      How to be a better person   Different people describe the word “better” in different ways. One has to do good karma to be a better person. If someone wants to be a better person, he/she should believe in themselves, should do what theirs hearts tell them to do, should be loyal, responsible and disciplined. To be better you have to do better work. Hard work is the only answer for progressing towards being a better person. Suppose, if you are doing poor in school you should try to do your best. If you try hard, the title “better person” will come flying toward you.

      Is T.V. any good?  Television is a gateway to not only the real world but also the gateway to our imagination.  A person can develop anything from their imagination. Most of the best selling movies were made from the director’s imagination.       People believe that one of the most prime directives of television is to give knowledge to the public and to give news on what is going around the society. Today, not only television is used for broadcasting news, it is also used for advertising, showing movies and other more things. Television gives the viewer knowledge of different aspects of life. Learning about different aspects of life is very important.      There are others many ways that television benefits us. Parents should not be discouraging children from watching television rather they should support theirs children will to learn and to gain knowledge.

She should stop speaking Nepali language and should start speaking English language. A new law should be passed which will force mom to speak at least English 1 hour a day. She should also start watching movies which will enhance her knowledge about the English language. By following the above mentioned ways, my mom will learn English way way faster.

      Rack or computer table?  I have been left with a decision. I have to choose between a rack or a computer table. We humans are left with choices each and every day. I am obligated to choose just one between a rack and a computer table. As I can see both the rack and the computer table have played a major role in my life. The computer table has given me a place to put the computer on. The rack also has given me a place to put magazines and books. I would enjoy having both of the furniture in this room. I am not going to make the decision about what furniture moves out of the room. There are other three people who share this same room with me that is why I can’t make this decision. A decision should be made which is fair to everyone in the group. But, if I were to choose just one I would choose the computer.

Computer will do most of the work. Most of the systems in the world will be planned, made and controlled by computers. Computer will be advance and be able to do so much more. I don’t even know where to start explaining what computers can do.

God is there to give help to each human in their daily lives and guide them through the paths of life. As human beings we are obligated to make choices in our life. One can make the best choice if he listens to the advice from the god inside himself. This is one of the main reasons the name “god” exists in our society.

It is a place where thousands express their opinion. Once, a document is posted on the internet anyone with an access to the internet can view that document from anywhere in the world.

      The Best Book Ever  I bet that you have heard about “Harry potter.” The writer of Harry Potter, J.K. Rollins has made more than a billion dollars by selling books and movies. “Why is Harry Potter the best book ever?” This question is very hard to answer because it really doesn’t have an answer in my opinion. This is why because I have never have decided to read any book in my life. A very surprising thing you might think. I only have read book if they promise me good grade or if it is a requirement. In other words, I only read what I have to read. But, I am gathered some information about why other people think Harry Potter is the best book. Some say that when you read the book you feel like you are actually experiencing what you are reading. Many people told me that the book makes the reader feel as actually he is there. I tried reading the first 3 pages, hake I didn’t feel anything. Harry Potter is just a joke, just a way to make another billion. J.K. Rollins wants to rip us apart.

      Why I stopped doing my essay?     I stopped doing my essay because I had tons of history homework to do. My history teacher, ***** ******* gave us a research project which was of course at least 15 pages. I have been working on this project since Tuesday. Tuesday is the same day I stopped doing my essay. Since, there was so much to do but there was no little time, I couldn’t get my essays done. I have to get good grades in this research project of history because I have to achiever many adcademic goals of mine.

      If Kathmandu is the cultural hub of Nepal, Pokhara is its center of adventure. An enchanting city nestled in a tranquil valley, it is the starting point for many of Nepal's most popular trekking and rafting destinations. The atmosphere on the shore of Phewa Lake is one of excited vitality as hipster backpackers crowd the many bars and restaurants exchanging recommendations on guest houses and viewpoints, both by the lake and above the clouds.   Pokhara is a place of remarkable natural beauty. The serenity of Phewa Lake and the magnificence of the fish-tailed summit of Machhapuchhre (6,977 m) rising behind it create an ambience of peace and magic. At an elevation lower than Kathmandu, it has a much more tropical feel to it, a fact well appreciated by the beautiful diversity of flowers which prosper in its environs. Indeed, the valley surrounding Pokhara is home to thick forests, gushing rivers, emerald lakes, and of course, the world famous views of the Himalaya.   Pokhara is part of a once vibrant trade route extending between India and Tibet. To this day, mule trains can be seen camped on the out-skirts of the town, bringing goods to trade from remote regions of the Himalaya. This is the land of the Magars and Gurungs, hardworking farmers and valorous warriors who have earned worldwide fame as Gurkha soldiers. The Thakalis, another important ethnic group here, are known for their entrepreneurship.  Getting there  Pokhara is located roughly 200 km west of Kathmandu. The journey between these two famed cities is certainly part of the Pokhara experience. Flying over the snow-capped Himalaya to the north and green Mahabharat range to the south is thrilling, while the overland journey past sparse rural settlements nested along the Trisuli river provides a view of life particular to Nepal's middle hills. There are daily flight between Kathmandu and Pokhara.    Pokhara Rules

      Although Nepal is officially a Hindu country ,a large proportion ,perhaps as much as one third of population is Buddhist. Nepal is only country in the world who enjoy the freedom of religion ,although more than two third of population of this country comes under Hindu religion. Hinduism is a multi disciplinary religion called Sanatana Dharma. There are endless division of Hindu system. Hinduism also advocates different ethical systems and meditation system so by practising these system one can take rebirth in Brahma realm. The Hindu religion has a large number of gods and their consorts and animals, but in Nepal basically three gods are worshiped ,although others god are also worshiped, called as Trinity of Hinduism.  Trinity of Hinduism  Brahma:- The creator Vishnu:- The preserver Shiva:- The destroyer   LORD BRAHMA  Brahma is the god of creation and he is traditionally accepted as the Creator of the entire universe. The description of Brahma like those of other deities of Hinduism bears a mystic symbolism. Brahma sitting on the lotus indicates that he is ever-rooted in the infinite Reality. The four faces of Brahma represent the four Vedas. They also symbolize the functioning of the inner personality (antahkarana) which consists of thoughts. They are the mind (manas), the intellect (buddhi), ego (ahamkara) and conditioned-consciousness (chitta). They represent the four ways in which thoughts function. Brahma the creator is described as being born from the navel of Vishnu as he is lying on the great serpent in the milky ocean. One of the earliest iconographic descriptions of Brahma is that of the four-faced god seated on a lotus. The Lord has in his four hands a water-pot (kamandalu), a manuscript (Vedas), a sacrificial implement (sruva) and a rosary (mala). He wears the hide of a black antelope and his vehicle is a swan {hansa).     LORD VISHNU   Lord Vishnu, major god of Hinduism, popularly regarded as the preserver of the universe. In the ancient body of literature called the Veda, the sacred literature of the Aryan invaders, Vishnu ranks with the numerous lesser gods and is usually associated with the major Vedic god Indra in battles against demonic forces. Vishnu is depicted frequently in human form, sleeping on the great serpent Shesha and floating on the waters. Vishnu can be identified by his four arms holding a Sankha(sea shell),charka(round wheel like weapon),gada(stick like weapon),and padma(lotus flower). The petals of the lotus are believed to symbolize the unfolding of creation; the Sankha is said to symbolize that from which all existence originates; and the gada reputedly were obtained by Lord Vishnu as rewards for defeating the God Indra.. Occasionally, the balance of power is upset in favor of evil, and then Lord Vishnu is believed to descend to earth in a mortal form (his avatar) to save humankind or the world. Ten such avatars (descents or incarnations) are commonly recognized, of which Lord Rama and Lord Krishna are the most important. Nine descents are thought to have already occurred; the tenth and last is yet to come. His wife is Goddess Lakshmi (also known as Shri), goddess of beauty and fortune.   LORD SHIVA  Shiva is said to be the god of destruction. The other two gods are Brahma, the god of creation and Vishnu, the god of maintenance. The three gods represent the three fundamental powers of nature which are manifest in the world viz. creation, destruction and maintenance. These powers exist perpetually. Creation is going on all the time. So is destruction and maintenance. All three powers are manifest at all times. They are inseparable. Creation and destruction are like two sides of a coin. And maintenance is an integral part of the processes of creation and destruction. Shiva is married to the Goddess Uma. Uma represents Prakriti which means perishable matter. Shiva's marriage with Uma signifies that the power of destruction has no meaning without its association with perishable matter. Destruction manifests itself only when there is perishable matter. Lord Shiva sits in a meditative pose against the white background of the snow-capped Himalayas in Mount Kailas. Its is the god Shiva grace giving rise to The Holy Rudraksha Beads for mankind to this world.   Copyright @Hindu Publishing Company 8976897893478934789

Reforms in 1990 established a multiparty democracy within the framework of a constitutional monarchy. A Maoist insurgency, launched in 1996, has gained traction and is threatening to bring down the regime. In 2001, the Crown Prince massacred ten members of the royal family, including the king and queen, and then took his own life. In October 2002, the new king dismissed the prime minister and his cabinet for "incompetence" after they dissolved the parliament and were subsequently unable to hold elections because of the ongoing insurgency. The country is now governed by the king and his appointed cabinet, which has negotiated a cease-fire with the Maoist insurgents until elections can be held at some unspecified future date.

Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, providing a livelihood for over 80% of the population and accounting for 40% of GDP. Industrial activity mainly involves the processing of agricultural produce including jute, sugarcane, tobacco, and grain. Security concerns in the wake of the Maoist conflict and the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks in the US have led to a decrease in tourism, a key source of foreign exchange. Nepal has considerable scope for exploiting its potential in hydropower and tourism, areas of recent foreign investment interest. Prospects for foreign trade or investment in other sectors will remain poor, however, because of the small size of the economy, its technological backwardness, its remoteness, its landlocked geographic location, its civil strife, and its susceptibility to natural disaster. The international community's role of funding more than 60% of Nepal's development budget and more than 28% of total budgetary expenditures will likely continue as a major ingredient of growth.
