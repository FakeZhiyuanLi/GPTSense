      the movie is actually nice. from the first few scenes to the "youve got mail" scenes where hilary duff and the "hot guy" (according to tonton and the girls sitting behind us) where excahnging messages to the romantic-dancing-in-the-park scene (iris playing in the background. period.) to the bestfriend-splashed-with-water-from-the-pool scene to the  locker room scene and lastly the rain-drop scene. it was all good. as james said, the "fakiness" was maintained all through out the movie which made it uber nice instead of trying to be more realistic. lots and lots of cheesy cheasy lines to choose from (see james' blog  urlLink www.xanga.com/sandarapark )  besides hilary duff and chad something something,  theres something about this movie that makes people want t see it. it was a friday night and the cinema was almost a standing room except for a few seats in the front row. imagine that. haha  definately a must see for people who doesnt want to think. hehe

       ah new blog but same old person. just a thought, wouldnt it be so convenient if we could change our identity as easy as changing our blogs? hehe .      school is STILL challenging. our exams just ended a week ago and so far so good i passed all of it. hehe yey! i even got 2nd highest in automotive! haha. me? a mechanic? haha that would be really funny.       our math teacher still is the best! "I M DAVID" if you ask me, its more of a statement than a name which is quite fitting for him since when a 4th year student hears the word "DAVID" it automatically sends chills down his spine. haha because of him the word "*BBQ" would forever haunt me. haha       remiter. the economics teacher. without a doubt one of the smartest teachers in la salle. as you all know, economics involves a lot of memorization in the part of the students and the teachers but not once have we seen remiter look at a "kodigo" in writing his lecture in the blackboard. it all comes from his moderately sized head. hehe    a joke from remiter:   remi : anong tagalog ng "liquid assets?"  us : ano?  remi : nagbabasang pagaari . hahaha! if thats not funny i dont know what is. hehe       physics becomes so much easier with ms. yky (pronounced as ikay) shes one of the coole teachers in la salle along with our geometry teacher ms. marie. she gives the best projects in the world! haha creative lab rules!      ms. castillo or more popularly known as 'tiya fely. zzzzzzzzz. english teacher and adviser. zzzzzzzzzz. so far, i only have 2 pages of notes in my english notebook. 'nuff said. zzzzzzzzz.      more teachers on my next entry.       my UP adventure on my next entry.       --->PLUG IN.       VOTE NOW!!! VOTE AICA!!!
