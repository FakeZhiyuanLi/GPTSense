      Little Lambert Johnson was walking down the cracked and crumbling sidewalk a few blocks from his cracked and crumbling house. The tall weeds swaying in the wind made made a green wavy tunnel for Lambert to run through on his way to his ultimate destination. Lambert didn't know what that was, but God did. God had some terrible, nasty experiences in store for sweet little Lambert. Experiences that would make last week's skinned knees look like day in the lolly pop pavillion. Right now, though, little Lambert was happy and free and had a whole hour to play. So Lambert waddled down to the corner where Jesus was hanging out teaching the local fisher men to fish men. Lambert didn't know from religion or philosophy or even double entendre, but he new he liked to listen to Jesus. Sweet Jesus, did he like it. So Lambert listened and learned and lapped up the riffs. He learned love and sarcasm and how to really piss people off by being too honest. He learned that he&nbsp;(Lambert)&nbsp;was&nbsp;God and there was nothing ever to be afraid of. He learned that the wisdom of the world is shit, and that it will make your life smell bad if you wallow in it. It was what he didn't learn that would hurt him eventually. It would make God hate him and do everything He could to ruin little Lambert's life. It was the one thing that Jesus couldn't get across to him. What was it? I'll tell you later.

      Here's a little flash movie that all pre-teens should be forced to watch, Clockwork Orange style. They should have to demonstrate understaning before being allowed any contact with members of the opposite sex. Don't you think?   urlLink http://www.scarysquirrel.org/special/movies/foamy/date.html

      I was just dinking around on the 'net, and found www.spoonbill.org. Check out the poetry, but don't even look at the prose. It's a great idea, 'cause you get to contribute to what will be the next Dylan Thomas masterpiece without having to be Dylan Thomas. Being Dylan Thomas is extremely hard work, by the way. I know because that was my summer job in my junior year at the University of Sporfley. Anyway, don't even look at the prose. Everybody on this whole planet has this item on their to-do list: "Write a novel.". Everybody has thought about it a lot. As far as they are concerned. They know pretty much how the novel should go, without figuring out the particulars, such as the names of the characters, the setting, or the plot, etc. So you can see where this goes. All of these people have found spoonbill, and now they don't need to think about any of those things. They can be the writers they know they were born to be without breaking stride. A sentence between code snippets, or a paragraph at a boring seminar. Suffice it to say, the prose is self-indulgent. But check out the poetry. You really can't fuck up poetry. It has a mind of its own.

      Can you believe nothing comes up on Google if you enter "who raped my cheese"? What ever happened to satire? Am I going to have to&nbsp;write this thing? But wait, I spoke too soon. The cheese wranglers are prowling the web. I figured maybe the "one minute manatee" would bring up something, and lo and behold, I was wisked away to the site of Stilton Jarlsburg M.D.   urlLink http://www.cutcheese.com/index.html   &nbsp;  Now here's a man after my own curd clogged heart. He wrote "Who cut the cheese" which is close enough to "Who Raped My Cheese" that I don't feel the need to write the latter. Which should make a lot of literary types happy. Not that they would ever run accross it anyway, but they would feel the collective I.Q. lowering another fraction of a point. Now Stilton, according to the reviews on Amazon.com, is not lowering the.. nevermind

      Watching a really hot girl from the Tim Allen show be pregnant and talk to an aircraft carrier crew. You gotta hand it to TV--there is no way I would have encountered that particular combination in real life. TV gives us experiences we never would have been able to have, had we lived through most of the history of humanity. Shit's changin' fast now, that's all i'm sayin'.
