      mmmm I'm writative today... Must be boredom.   In a little over a month I'm starting an exchange semester at the university of Idaho. Besides all the stress, the hunting down papers and signatures, I'm getting pretty excited.   For me it's a chance to finally go somewhere WITHOUT PARENTAL GUIDANCE. I know, 22, err umm almost 23 and still living at home. Makes me wish my university weren't so damned near my home. Some days it's just stiffling to live under a roof with parents and siblings. Except for my little room, I have no space to breath. I can't be alone for a moment. There's always someone barging in. Mother sometimes says I would be lonely living alone in an appartment. But what she forgot are the friends I have living in the same city. And that I'm a loner. I like my peace and quiet. Well I'll have to wait another few years for that. Gonna be sharing a room with someone in the Residence hall.   *shrugs*   I'll survive it

      I've recently encountered some strange views on friendship. But that's nothing unusual with me. I have strange friends. Hence strange views on friendship could, and should be expected. But this one takes the cream I think. Not because it is so other earthly. But because it is painful to watch. It concernes three friends of mine. Or to be more precise: someone who knew me as a teenager, and two people she introduced me to which I've only ever spoken to online.   The first friend, Sara, is a very dificult person to get along with. She's what might be called a drama queen at times. Always needing to be the center of attention. She thinks she's never wrong. That everything that happens is someone else's fault. She's very extream in her feelings, in the way she reacts. You're either best friends, acquaintance, or hated enemy. I've been "best friend" since 1996, with a year pause somewhere in 9th grade. But once that friendship is gained, she is a very loyal friend.   The other two, Tiffany and Becky, I don't know as well. I've met Becky once, and exchanged a few e-mails. And Tiffany I've only spoken on the phone with, and regularly e-mail. So I can't really say anything about them, positive or negative.   Sara, as I said, is a difficult person, and doesn't make friends easily. She was overjoyed to finally find two persons she could call friends after I've moved away.  After the fiasco of some of her roommates, she more than needed a friend who lived close by. I'm in Switzerland, not California.  I thought, great, she found people to hang out with, who'll listen to her, help her, just be what friends should be: unconditionally there.  But what happens when suddenly trust is lost? What happens when people can't talk to each other anymore without "yelling" in each other's faces?   Things began to get problematic in the last year. Sara was having a lot of difficulties with her current roommates. She said they wanted to force her out of the common dorm room. I won't say anything about that particular situation, I wasn't there, and I won't take a one sided acount of what happened as truth. But with those problems, Sara's life began to turn explicitly around her three roommates, and everything they do wrong. Everytime one of us (with us I mean Tiffany, Becky, and myself) tried to explain to Sara that yes, Alice and co were doing something wrong, and yes it was partly their fault, but that she, Sara, probaly wasn't entierly innocent, she blew up in our faces. It came to the point that I almost canceled my stop over at her place in February. She's good at guilt tripping people into stopping.   Anyways, from there on things have been going from bad to worse. I try to ignore her messages, and she royally screws up her friendship with Tiffany and Becky. After a recent trip to Disneyland, things have come to a point of no return. Sara gave Tiffany and Becky an ultimatum, after which they will not be friends anymore. She's like a roller coaster ride, going up and down and up and down.   Maybe I should be like Tiffany and Becky, write a letter to cut all contact. Plainly state what I feel, and that she'd screwed up. but I keep on having to think about our friendship during high school. Mostly, now a days, it's for the sake of "old times" that I try not to hurt her feelings too much. But that's getting harder and harder.  I sometimes wonder about her definition of friendship. Is frienship something you can list in time and space? Something you can define by your current mood? Can you tell your friends to change because it would suit you better? I'm not so sure it's the right thing to do. For me friendship has always been as much about giving and taking, in same measures. If you give one day, you should be able to take the next day. Friendship has no price, it has no "best if used by..." date attached to it. Sure sometimes you're the one giving endlessly. But that's because you know you'll eventually have someone to turn to years down the road. Friendship is something where you trust someone to help you as much as you are willing to help you. For me that's what defines friendship.   Friends should also be able to critsize each other. Constructivly. To show them "hey you were wrong!". And just the same they should be able to accept those words.   Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I've been rating friendship the wrong way for too many years. But a one sided friendship only one works on, is no friendship at all. And that's what it's been feeling like for far too long now.   I know Sara will never read this. Maybe she should. Maybe it might make her understand a few things, confused and dazed as I seem to be right now. I still try to figure out how best to explain friendship to her.

      Too pissed by far to be social right now.   Seems that as a Student of English Literature I can't take English lit classes during my exchange. How retarded is that?
