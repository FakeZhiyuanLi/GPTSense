      Whether or not you love John Kerry or hate him is an entirely different argument. Those who love him didn't care whether his speech was perfect or whether he fell flat on his face. Those who don't support him aren't going to vote for him anyways, so they probable weren't watching.  No, the only people that his speech at the Democratic National Convention in Boston applied to were those who were in the middle and undecided on who to vote for come the election. Many have claimed that John Kerry needed to reach out to his listeners and prove to them he was capable of winning their vote. I believe he easily completed this task. I have heard numerous John Kerry speeches, none of which I was able to keep from falling asleep. He may be a brilliant man, but if he is unable to connect to his audience, it really doesn't matter.  For the first time I heard John Kerry actually sound as if he cared about becoming President and he also didn't act like an Al Gore clone. The enthusiasm in his voice should have been enough to convince those who questioned whether or not he was right for the job from a leadership and caring perspective.  Many of the issues discussed will remain a question mark as to whether you agree with President Bush or Senator Kerry. But unfortunately, while such issues should be the main concern on American's minds come election time, I believe the main concern is whether or not they are likeable characters. Hence, prior to Kerry's speech on Thursday in Boston, the edge easily goes to President Bush, even though he sounds like a five year old child when in front of the podium.  And although I don't think such traits are that important when voting for President, I do believe there are a ton of people out there who do feel that is the most important issue to discuss.  So the question I raise to the millions of those reading this is: How important is being a "nice guy" when you consider who to vote for for President?

           How ridiculous is the Major League Baseball economy when the same teams year after year have to sell their good players to the usual contenders for prospects and some cash?     Did anyone realize the MLS (Major League Soccer) held their all-star game today on national television?     Does anyone really care?     I also saw that the WNBA was televising a game today on television     How is that league still in existence?     Brett Hull's agent is in discussions with Mario Lemieux and the organization about joining the Penguins for the final years of his great career.  How awesome would it be for him to break Gordie Howe's all-time goal record in a Penguins uniform?     I don't know about any of you, but football can't start up fast enough.     I'm so happy to see Aramis Ramirez (third baseman for the Chicago Cubs and previous Pittsburgh Pirate until the Bucs traded him before the deadline last season) struggling with the Cubs.  Oh wait, he hit three HR's yesterday giving him 21 on the season.  Don't the Pirates have a major hole at third base?  I wonder where we could find one?  Thats not to say that newcomer Ty Wiggington can't fill the void, but Ramirez should still be in a Pirate uniform     The New York Yankees will be in the World Series again.  Yeah, there sure is parity in Major League Baseball!     How long before the NFL starts up again?

      Let's analyze this objectively....  If the Pirates do not trade pitcher Kris Benson by tomorrow's deadline, the chances of them signing him long term after the season is over is slim to none and slim just walked out the back door.  Hence, Mr. Benson will hit the free agent market come next year and like many other average ball players he will get a juicy offer from one or two idiotic teams.   If the Pirates trade him before the deadline, they may (or may not) receive a quality prospect with an average MLB ready position player to go along in the deal.  And while one never knows how good or bad a prospect will become, there is a chance that the player(s) could help the Pirates in other areas of need.  Let's face it, the Pirates have a slew of pitching prospects and this is the one are they can actually afford to give up.  They need position players...mainly at third, first and left field (depending on where you want to put Craig Wilson)  Giving away Kris Benson is not like giving away Roger Clemens in his prime either.  Benson has been an average pitcher at best who seems to have been injured moreso than healthy during his breif MLB career.  Benson is a .500 pitcher who's ERA hovers near the 5.00 mark, which is not good.  So even though he has pitched extremely well for the Pirates of late, there is no way he is worth his current salary of over 5 million per year.  That salary is sure to increase due to the stupid baseball economy and the Pirates just can't afford to pay a guy who might end up getting better in 2 or 3 more years while paying tons of money for him during his "progressions".  There is also the notion around the city of Pittsburgh that the Pirates have an outside chance of making the wild card this year, and should hold onto him for the stretch run even if they were to lose him in the offseason.  This might be the most laughable idea I've heard in a long time.  The Pirates are not going to the playoffs.  They may be 6 or 7 games back from a wild card berth, but they also have half of the national league to jump over....it ain't gonna happen!  If the Pirates hold on to Benson, they are sure to lose him.  And if they trade him, its a roll of the dice as to what they may get in return.  I don't know about you, but I'll take my chances rolling the dice with the ladder.

      My sweetheart Ann Coulter was on TV last night blaming Democrats for the existence of all terrorists, hurricanes, tornadoes, hell......you know the drill.  I love this lady. I love how she might be the dumbest person on the face of this earth and yet she still talks as if she knows stuff. How awesome is that?  How cool is it that whenever she was asked a question about an untrue Bush ad seen on TV that bashes Kerry, she dodges the question like no other and says, "you want to talk about ads, lets talk about Kerry's ads". I absolutely love that stuff. I mean after all, she was asked a question and ever so sneakily, she didn't answer it.  The thing that was so cool about what I saw on, surprise surprise, Fox News was that Alan Colmes let Coulter dodge the question and stumbled onto his next topic. Only Colmes could do this so well.  How about following up and making her answer the damn question you freaking moron? Let's see....he could have said, "No, I asked you a question about the Bush ad, lets continue with that" or "eat shit and die Ann, I asked you a question bio eeitch...answer it!". But I suppose those questions were so complex and hard to come up with during an interview that it never popped into Colmes' miniscule brain.  So Coulter refused to answer the question that no conservative wanted to anyways, and she got away with it. Can you blame her? If she is allowed to dodge questions so easily, why not do it? There is nothing wrong with Coulter being a complete hypocrite and an asswad...oh wait.  Now that I think about it, I love Fox News. You can't get this type of comedy elsewhere. Why watch CNN and get "actual" news and stuff? I can always read the Pittsburgh Post Gazette for that crap. I want lying and hypocrisy when I watch television. Because at night when I watch Fox News there is nothing I like to do more than to bash my head against the wall in frustration.  Yes, ladies and gents, my two heroes were sitting next to each other last night...Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter. We should all have watched and enjoyed it, because it was a special moment on TV.  Ann Coulter....EAT A BOWL!

      Tommy Maddox is the starter for the Pittsburgh Steelers this year.  There is nothing, other than injury, that can happen in the preseason to give the nod to either the Steelers first round draft pick or Brian St. Pierre.  However, the future sure looked bright on Saturday night in Detroit.  When Ben Roethlisberger (a name i will get sick of typing shortly) entered the game in the 2nd quarter Saturday, people were looking for good things from the youngter.  Instead, they got to see great things.  Big Ben (see?) showed the poise of a veteran QB with the ability to elude the rush while still finding open receivers down field.  I loved what I saw from him.  Not only does he have a cannon for an arm, but it is also very accurate.  The trait that I believe will separate him from other QB's in the years to come is his scrambling ability.  No, he doesn't have McNabb speed, but a QB in this league doesn't need to be that fast.  A QB must be able to KNOW when to run and be able to make the quick moves in the pocket to buy time.  Roethlisberger does this extremely well.  Also, he has the uncanny ability to throw on the run with amazing accuracy, something we all saw from his days at Miami (OH).   Now, I'm not going to jump to conclusions on whether or not he is a hall of fame QB after one preseason game, but it sure is nice to see that the future quarterback of the Pittsburgh Steelers looked tremendous in his debut.    Game notes:  Ben Roethlisberger went 8-13 for 84 yards and a touchdown pass to Antwaan Randel El.  Brian St. Pierre finished the game at QB.  Tommy Maddox also went 4 of 5 for 52 yards and looked very sharp.

      Like the title?  I was watching Hannity and Colmes on The Fox News Channel last night, a station that pretends to be fair and balanced (when you have to claim to be fair and balanced....something doesn't add up), and I saw something that made me want to sock Sean Hannity repeatedly until he shuts the hell up.  I'm all for having an objective view from both parties on a subject, but Sean Hannity is a perfect example of how not to be "fair and balanced" as he states they are every friggin' day.  They had a Fox News Exclusive (OH MY!) about how this idiot John O'Neill wrote a book on John Kerry's lies in Vietnam and how he claims to have 60 Veterans claiming he lied as well. His whole purpose: To not have John Kerry elected.  We'll get back to this...but what I want to focus on is how Hannity ran the interview. Keep in mind that they had a Kerry advisor on the show later to get a "fair and balanced" view from the other side as well. So Hannity starts lobbing up softballs while this O'Neill jagoff keeps knocking them out of the park. First off, this O'Neill moron is a Republican who has hated on Kerry for 30 years (so already his claims are partisan as hell and thus very questionable). Hannity makes the claim that only 9 vets support Kerry, and that 60 vets (as O'Neill so eloquently puts it) think otherwise. So Hannity concludes that you have a 60 vet vs. 9 vet comparison and hence anyone in their right mind can conclude that Kerry is a liar.  One problem assbag...the 9 vets on Kerry's side have publicly stated how Kerry is aVietnam hero and how the numerous awards he has won reflect such. O'Neill's buddies have never gone public. And in fact, Hannity said the book "seems very interesting" that O'Neill wrote. So the dick hasn't even read the book (which probably contains more twists than a damn roller coaster) written by O'Neill, and he is already coming to conclusions about Kerry. Typical Sean Hannity. He takes a quote about something and twists it so far out of proportion to get his point across. Isn't that illegal or something? The stuff he quotes in his show are stuff that he hasn't even read fully yet or understands the meaning of, but he just gets so excited when he THINKS he read something important that he uses it and completely takes it out of context. Thats something that a 10 year old does. How does this ass get away with that crap while Colmes sits there with his thumb up his ass (nice choice of a liberal counterpart by the way...I wonder who picked that gem, was it maybe Sean Hannity? Or was it the producer of Fox News who got rid of all the damn liberals once he took over the channel?)  Sorry about that tangent I went off on there...I just hate that guy so much.  Anyways, so when they go to a commerical break Hannity and Colmes brings in a guy from the Kerry squad to give their side. When they come back...Hannity says something like this..  "The point I want to make here is that none of us sitting at this table right now know what happened over there...the only thing we can do is listen to those who were over there (like O'Neill)...so thanks for coming to our show though, talk to you later".  Honestly, because this guy they chose to come on the show was never in Vietnam, he was never given a chance to talk because "you don't know because you weren't over there". What the hell? Sean Hannity, not to mention, continually interrupted this guy from the Kerry side and he was never able to get his point across while Mr. O'Neill was given all the time in the world to bash the hell out of Kerry. Sound fair and balanced to you? I hate Sean Hannity.  On to my other point...  Do you think the conservatives will ever quit this shit on Kerry's Vietnam record?  How hypocritical is it when their President is a damn draft dodger, yet they have the balls to criticize a guy who served for his country.  They claim he won the purple heart because he accidently hurt himself in battle, not from incoming fire.  Whatever...they sound like 6 year old girls saying that he wasn't such a cool hero over there after all.  How low will these dicks stoop?  And I wonder why they put so much emphasis on this?  Could it be because they have nothing on this guy and they want to just start a leak on something and drag it on throughout the entire election?    I bet Kerry didn't rescue anyone either, I bet he just drove his boat through the water and accidently bumped into a fallen soldier...and I bet this guy got into the boat himself, without Kerry even seeing.  Which doesn't make Kerry a hero at all.  And I bet Kerry wasn't even on the boat.  In fact, was he even in Vietnam?  Is this guy running for office?  Is he even American?  He hates America...typical liberal!  I hate John Kerry                                                                                                        Anyone from Fox News                                                                               Have I mentioned that I hate Sean Hannity?

       Baltimore  The reigning AFC North Champion Baltimore Ravens are in prime position to win the title again. Ray Lewis and the intimidating Raven defense is back again to torment QB's. While the offense hasn't seen any significant upgrades, Jamaal Lewis is one of the best RB's in the league and the key to an effective offensive attack is a stellar ground game. The Ravens will have this and should win the division title again this year. Oh, and if Kyle Boller happens to fall on his face, good ol' Kordell Stewart will take over as their QB. I hope Kordell returns to Pittsburgh as a starter for the Ravens.  Prediction: 10-6   Pittsburgh  There is no reason to believe the Steelers will finish second in this division, but I also can't see the Steelers finishing 6-10 like they did a year ago. The defense should be much improved via the return of defensive coordinator Dick Lebeau. Lebeau is sure to send the blitz packages with frequency due to their lack of ability to cover WR's with the weak secondary they still have. If they don't blitz effectively, they will not succeed. But Lebeau will have them ready and seems up for the challenge. Tommy Maddox needs to cut down on the INT's (didn't we hear this last year) because with a suspect defense and questionable ground attack, the Steelers can ill-afford turnovers this season. We saw what happened with that last year. First round phenom Ben Roethlisberger won't be ready this year so his impact won't be felt until another season or two. The offensive line will be better this season but with still so any questions to answer, a Wild Card berth is the best they can do this year, and that still may be stretching it. Look for a tough fight between The Steelers and Bengals for the second place finish here.  Prediction: 9-7   Cincinnati  The one main concern this year for the Bengals is whether or not Carson Palmer can step in and be the QB they drafted first overall two years ago. But on top of that Jon Kitna had a decent season last year and his demotion raises questions as to whether or not it was the right thing to do. After all, Cincinnati fell one game short of making the postseason last year for the first time in forever. Marvin Lewis's defense will be good enough to win some games on their own, but how many? Rudi Johnson takes over full responsibilities at RB because of Corey Dillon's departure to New England. We'll see how good he is now. I still think this team is one year away from great things, so a tie with the Steelers for second place seems like the most logical position for them this year with the tiebreaker going to Pittsburgh.  Prediction: 9-7   Cleveland  Cleveland fans can expect a long season this year. Sure, they signed Jeff Garcia at QB. But it doesn't mean anything if you have no offensive line to protect him or any type of a running game to speak of, so it's tough to predict the impact he will have on this team. As of today, first round pick Kellen Winslow Jr. was still unsigned, and if he doesn't get to camp soon, the Browns won't have their only major threat in the passing game. Butch Davis seems too into himself and his philosophies that don't work in the NFL and until he changes (or he is fired), the Browns will continue to lose. The defensive secondary is OK, but the defensive line couldn't contain any running back last year, and that's never a good thing. I could be way off on this one, but they'll be shooting for a high pick next year.  Prediction: 5-11      Overall this division didn't get much better than last year, which leaves the door open for a mediocre team to perhaps slip into a Wild Card spot. But still look for this division to only get one team into the playoffs like last year (Baltimore).

      The Rooney's and their organization have always extended their coaches' contracts with two years left on the previous deal. It's been like that since Chuck Noll took the helm in the late 60s. It's a way of showing their trust with the coaching staff of the Pittsburgh Steelers. And while when they followed suit this past week by extending Coach Bill Cowher's contract through the year 2007, this time I feel they made a mistake.  With a team coming off of a 6-10 season and missing the playoffs for the 4th time in 6 seasons, isn't it a bit premature to lengthen someone's contract? The city went ballistic when the Steelers renewed Kordell Stewart's contract when no one was sure how good or bad of a QB he was (and we all know how that turned out).  Why should Bill Cowher get a free pass on this one? His motivational skills which he used so well in the early 90s seem to be getting old and his antics on the sidelines just seem idiotic anymore. While one can't dismiss the fact that he had this team in the AFC Championship game a few short years ago, one also cannot turn their head away from the horrid season they had last year. In short, the negatives have outweighed the positives the last six years, and in the NFL (which is a 'what have you done for me lately' league) that shouldn't be tolerated. Bill Cowher deserves this year to prove that he still has it as a coach in this league, but he doesn't deserve to have his job solidified after the way they played last year. He still had two years left on his previous deal. What was the rush this time?  A 6-10 season should never be rewarded and his contract should not have been renewed, even if that means going against the policies the Rooney's have used the past 40 years.
