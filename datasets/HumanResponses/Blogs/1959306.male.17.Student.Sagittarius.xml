      ...that bother me.   Have you ever been having a conversation with someone and you noticed something that they do that bothers you. Well, I have lots of these "little things", but inorder to get the full meaning of these instead of calling them "things" lets call them annoyances. Yes, "little annoyances", much better! Now that we have them properly defined I will share some with you.   How about when your talking with someone and all the do is stare at your hair and never look you right in the face. Sometimes I want to reach-out and grab their head  and angle it down to eye level.  Or when someone always breaths through their mouth. You know that heavy oral cavity breathing that sounds like they are on a respirator or something. Sometimes I just want to reach out and put both my hands over their mouth in order to force them to breath out their nose just once! Although I do not suggest you do this to someone who has a cold, this could result in them passing out or passing on, depending on how weak they are and how long you suppress their air flow;(  OH! Here's a good one! ONE-UP-Manship (This is not about the green mushrooms that give you an extra life).  urlLink Mr. Harmless  knows it better as "that's nothin". There the people who always have a bigger and better story. If you ever want to tell if someone is a "that's nothin" kind of person use this fool proof test I learned from  urlLink Mr. Harmless . You start by telling a story about how one day you died and you got rushed to the hospital via life-line and after rigor mortis had just set in you got revived by  urlLink Chuck Norris . If they are the type you think they are you can almost say along with them "that's noth'n". (jinx :)  Another one... how about those people, usually girls, who pretend to be really ditzy. They ask questions like "did mount Rushmore form naturally"or ______________ (fill in the blank to make yourself laugh). Sometimes I think they want attention, but  who knows maybe they really are that stupid?  One more.....pickers and eaters....enough said.   -unifictious Facts from the Viking-

      Yeah! You know who I'm talkin' aboot. Those people, usually girls, who are always robbing you of the better grade you don't deserve! When you think of these people what words come to your mind? Resentment?.......Bitterness?.......Bile?......Warm milk? You might even think of yourself, scary!    There is at least one in every class except in my class there are two. For instance the class will get scores in the range of 13(matt meinema) to 76/77, and then there will be the girl(s) who studied. I, myself, think that these people are being selfish and vindictive. If they just would have thought of the procrastinators, the school, neh, the world would be a better place.  So I have came up with a few steps to help them!  1) Admit- the first part is to realize what you are doing to others :(  2) omit - this part is easy! Once you have a good grasp on all the pain and suffering                  you're causing, all you have to do to make it go away is not answer the hard                   questions. Therefore causing you to get an initial lower grade but in the end                    your grade will elevated to its proper status and so will everyone else's  :)  3) Commit - We want all curve breakers to realize you can change this undesirable trait.                     But it will take a lot of work! There will be days, though few and far                    between, when you feel like getting the the answer right. That is Why I                      will meet with any one who wants to rectify this situation. Here is an                     example off the top of my head. ;)     JORDAN BRAND ---------------------------------------KEILAH BROWN    I'm sure these two would do wonderfully well in making our school a better place!    Now, for us "non-curvebreakers" we need to work on encouraging these people and    helping them get through this struggle!     This is Paul Rolley Leaving you with pointless info. for you to do with as you please.
