      Nearly arrested today for walking on the grass in Yu Yuan Gardens. Public space here in Shanghai still feels somehow... private. Guarded. Much more regulated than in Bejing.  Error compounded: I was so flustered from the police encounter that I accidentally ordered two sugary meat puffs for lunch at the Mister Donut on Nanjing Xilu. (I thought they were chocolate creme-filled!) Lesson learned: Looks can be deceiving here, even when dealing with something as simple as the donut.  But not all my decisions have been bad lately. Seems like I picked exactly the right hemisphere for a game of hide and seek. Thanks for alerting me to the message you found on the metastasized site:   The Killer appears to have withdrawn from the field. I have data processes tracking her, but she appears to have physically escaped from me.   Well, the Operator may have grown axons, but by my calculations, Shanghai is axon-free.  Safe!  Also: I emailed the Sleeping Princess, now that I'm in more wired country (not so many Wi-Fi spots along the Jinshanling section of the Great Wall).  Will she finally show us the secret she found? Fingers crossed.  P.S. Major typhoon south of here yesterday.  Not much damage here in Shanghai, but from the news reports, it sounds like others outside the city were hit really hard.  Nearly 2000 people injured, more than 42,000 homes destroyed... thoughts and prayers with the victims.  After an earthquake earlier this week, it seems like Mother Nature has it out for China this summer.  may be time for me to move on to another country soon...

       urlLink 5913 miles  is a long way to go just to keep thinking about the same problem.  More than 1000 emails tell me you're still thinking about it, too.   Hi Dana, How are your travels on the other side of the globe? I hope you're enjoying your vacation... but it must be hard knowing in the back of your mind what kind of a situation things are in back at home. (That's why you're checking your e-mail, isn't it?)   True.   Dana, You can't run… and we can't hide. It knows our names, our addresses, it's going to reach out and touch us and guess what happens then? You'll have to go further than China to get away from this one, Dana. When it metastasizes, we're *all* going to get a good long look at it. There's hope here. There's someone trying to help here. But she's alone and afraid, she knows what's going on but, my dear, she's only going to talk to *you*. Aren't you glad? The Princess wants you in her court. The Queen wants you dead. You're our ace in the hole. One more draw and we get a royal flush.   I hear you.   Dana, The tables have turned. Now, we need *your* help. If this thing spreads ...who knows what havoc may erupt. And yikes!... It's got my email address... a possible window into my computer ??!?!... and into *all* the computers of people who only wanted to help you. Help us, Dana...... I hope you're reading this.   I'm reading it.  I was scared but if we're in it together, well… I'd rather be scared in company.  So I'm back in: as cuddly as the cat and as charming as the butterfly, from a hostel in Beijing.  In the meantime I will check in as often as I can and wait the nerve-wracking, tedious wait with you until whatever is going to begin on the 24th begins.  P.S.  urlLink Keeping things in perspective  is good, lol. Thank you, "Dan".

      It saw me.&nbsp;&nbsp; It  knows me  now.&nbsp;  &nbsp;— seen and skinned.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm sorry.&nbsp; I'm out.&nbsp;   I dragged you into this.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; But forget about it.&nbsp; It's over.&nbsp;   I don’t want  www.ilovebees.com  to be my problem anymore.&nbsp;   I don't want it to be your problem either.&nbsp; (And you can stop trying to hack into my email, voicemail, and web site... good grief.)   Tsi Tian , everyone. Thanks for the help and support. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I'm done.

      Woke up Tuesday to an alarming email from Aunt Margaret.&nbsp; (Apparently, so did quite&nbsp; few of you, as evidenced by the many "I think your aunt has completely lost it" messages I received.)&nbsp;   It took several hours to finally get a hold of Aunt M on the phone.&nbsp; Before I could say a word about the "odd behavior cry for help," she had her own email question for me:   Did I have any idea why all of her Hotmail would disappear overnight?&nbsp;   I logged in as ladybee777 to check out the damage.&nbsp; Old password worked fine. But no mail in any of the folders…?&nbsp; Weird.&nbsp; (Where was the concerned reply I had sent her that morning?)  Wrote a quick test message and sent it off to myself.&nbsp; Nothing shows up in my gmail inbox.&nbsp; Try again, this time to an older account.&nbsp; Check there: Nothing.&nbsp; Again.&nbsp; Rinse.&nbsp; Repeat.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; Like a little Maxwell's Demon siphoning off all ingoing and outgoing messages.&nbsp; (And apparently sending out its own.)  So Aunt Margaret's email appears to have gone the way of the China countdown.&nbsp; Hijacked.&nbsp; Repurposed.&nbsp;   My first instinct: ask Hotmail to kill the account entirely.&nbsp; But then someone calling him (her?) self "xnbomb" sent me a very persuasive email that made me rethink things.&nbsp; Read for yourself:   It seems that snippets of various emails that have been sent to you by my colleagues have been reassembled and sent back, apparently originating from your aunt's hotmail address.&nbsp; I'm not really sure what it means at this point. &nbsp;But it tells us that we can communicate with these entities using email. &nbsp;In the absence of having a clear idea of just what is going on, the first priority is to communicate, that is how we can learn more. &nbsp;It's at least possible that we've stumbled across something extraordinary here, and our first priority must be to learn all that we can about it.  &nbsp;  It's for that reason that I'm going to suggest that you take no further action that interferes with what's going on at   urlLink  ilovebees.com   .&nbsp; There's another reason too, one slightly more disturbing.&nbsp; Consider this passage from the end of the tale hidden in the images:  &nbsp;  "The day will break and the sun will rise when the Queen returns to rule, and further let it be known that retribution on any who hinder the return of the Queen will be swift and terrible.  This is a significant warning, namely that any interference with that process will be regarded as a hostile act, and will be responded to accordingly. &nbsp;I don't know what the SPDR is capable of, but I'm not sure I want to find out.It's for this reason that I suggest that you don't do anything else to get in the way of this business. &nbsp;If your aunt's business needs a functioning web site immediately, purchase her a new and similarly named domain and get her web site going there. &nbsp;But let this follow its course… while it could just be some hackers being jerks, there is at least a chance that this is something unique and important and wonderful, a window on a world that we may have never seen before, nor will ever see again.   Optimistic and curious, yet with the good sense to be terrified.&nbsp; This seems like a pretty good fix on the situation — thanks, xnbomb.&nbsp;   I am, of course, wildly nervous about letting the bug(s) continue wreaking havoc entirely unimpeded.&nbsp; But nothing, and I mean nothing, I was doing on the tech side seemed to make a damn bit of difference anyway.&nbsp; So it seems like a good plan to switch gears from active damage control to... well, what?&nbsp;   (ideas?)  P.S. Have decided to try to shield Aunt M from the latest development, so for now I'm telling her it’s a widespread Hotmail glitch.&nbsp; I hope I'm doing the right thing.

      So the bug — or virus, or spyware, or, whatever it is — is now apparently counting down to something, and that something looks like it's going to happen while I am somewhere in Szechuan province and I can't fix it and yeah it's creeping me out and yeah I'm not happy about this.&nbsp; (The recent appearance of words like "mayday", "metastasize", "hemorrhage," and "classified" isn't cheering me up, either.)  &nbsp;  What the hell is this thing.&nbsp; And why would a site as harmless, I mean utterly and completely harmless, as  urlLink www.ilovebees.com  attract its attention?

      Best case scenario:  urlLink the delinquent site  gets fixed before the 29th, when I'm flying to Beijing.  There's no way I'm just going to bail and leave Aunt Margaret to deal with this until who knows when. (She bought me my All-Asia air pass in exchange for 7 years of indentured tech support, and ... I'm not going to let her get the raw end of the deal here.  Not an option.)  (The trip is hard to defend.  Beijing is the first stop on an open-ended backpacking trip through East/Southeast Asia, a trip I have no good reason to be taking (as my parents like to remind me), except (as I point out to them, though sometimes kind of quietly and maybe even after they've left the room) I've been "home" — in one way or another — for 22 years now, and absolutely everywhere I go is already drenched with my own history.   I'm tired of being so...known.    So I guess you could say that the point of this trip is to make the stone stony. And I'm the stone. And I'll come back whenever I'm unfamiliar enough that it won't feel anymore like home has reached its saturation point of me.)  Anyway: I really don't want to leave my aunt in the lurch.  All suggestions (obvious, off-the-wall, whatever) are welcome, I've tried everything I can think of, am completely out of ideas.

						     Oh where to begin, first of all I guess:    WHAT WE THINK THAT YOU KNOW OF WE THINK THAT WE KNOW ABOUT ILOVEBEES    BEAUTY IS IN THE........BLOUSE?    LoL Behold! Beholder! Eye of the beholder fool!  Okay there is a saying that appears on the website that says Seek the truth, behold the truth, reveal the truth. For this is the law...blah blah. In phase two of the game reveal was completely gone from the accounts so I believe that in the first period the name of the game was reveal, in the second behold and lastly SEEK.  It makes SOME sense I dunno whaddya think? See you in period three.    A RECAP FROM THE FIRST PERIOD:    Okay basically the website  urlLink www.ilovebees.com  came up and people are like going "Whoa...dude....I'm seeing things....whhhooaaa my hands are soo....BIG....and my cape...soo....FLASHY" Anyways after the inital....SHOCK AND AWE!!!!!!! (MOABS FALLING FROM THE SKY!) died down people started saying "whoa, Dana is sexy" and then "Dude! there are hidden messages!"    So with all the messages logged and all the hidden texts revealed the question became...."huh?"  You can check out the progress of the people I'm working with at  urlLink http://elgamer.blogspot.com/  and Elgamer's website at  urlLink http://xbox-reformed.com/elgamer/index2.html   Basically we have come to the conclusions that the Operator who is behind the MAYDAY texts is the Queen and the Widow refers to the spiders and is reassembling (whatever that may mean) the queen.  There is not much said, other than in passing, about the pious flea and the sleeping princess.   I am going to do something rather dangerous and relate the Manticore to HALO.  I don't want to do that because we may jump to too many conclusions and in the end we'll be saying OMG OMG DANA IS THE MONITOR REBORN!  But anyways, I believe that the enchantment and the manticore refers to the flood.  Seeing has how a manticore has the head of a man, the body of a lion and the tail of a serpent?  And the manticore is not the only one there are others many others.  I offer you this as evidence.     "At the gates of the Inner Keep all the guards were dead but one, who when the palace was blasted by enchantment had not died, but had been witched into the form of a hideous Manticore. The Widow said, "I am the servant of your Queen, and I have walked up out of Hell to prepare this keep for her return. Let me pass."  But the Manticore did not know her, and still he barred the way. So the Widow drew her knife and slew the Manticore and the way was open. She walked through the empty corridors of the Keep searching for her Queen, past the bodies of her servants and subjects that lay dead or enchanted. "   His body has been transformed but his head and possibly his mind has not?....I'll let the HALO fanboys figure it out.  A NICE INTERMISSION AND A WEBSITE CRASH  Okay with PHASE1 complete we are in a fresh new period.  New texts so many new texts and new images and new texts and new theories....written in new texts woohoo!  We have a whole new cadre of people ONI Techs, Captains, Lieutenants, Midshipmen, Melissas (not the virus...though possibly), and more bees....OH GOD THEY ARE IN MY HAIR.   The new story I presume is again narrated by our dear lady operator and she just talks about repairs and revenge and stuff like that...you know all the sugar and spice and everything nice girls talk about?  heh.  There is also new text embedded in a series of images called "killer" as well as a whole swath of links go read the story at elgamer's website and bugger off.    HORSES FROM ITHICA    Just something I noticed. Oh and melissa is greek for HONEY BEE....GASP!    "A man thatseemed noble, classical and pure. A sailor with Odysseus. "     "Capt Greene: ...Even leaving aside our particular mission, there's the issue of letting them know we've broken their codes. If we bug out and scramble home to warn HQ about Troy,"     "Capt. Greene: I am not privy to strategic conversations at that level. But if we run home and present the decrypt, we put them in a tricky situation. If they act, they risk letting the enemy know we have a toehold in their C-and-C."     These are two excerpts that we know of.   The former comes from the killer-embedded messge decrypt.  The latter two come from the general phase 2 story. I noticed two similarities between Troy and Odysseus, namely Odysseus was one of the commanders in the trojan war and I think he was also the one who envisioned the trojan horse.
