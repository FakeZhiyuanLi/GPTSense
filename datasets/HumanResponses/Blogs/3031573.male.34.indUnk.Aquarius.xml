        I was reading first few chapters from book (PDF version) called Free Culture by Lawrence Lessig. I thought you guys should check it out. They are giving away free full version PDF on this book or you can purcahse a book from local store or online. I will share some of this with you once I finished reading this book.   If you did read or heard about it, please feel free to share your thought with us. You will need to register then make your comment. Thanks!  Quote from Lessig website:  “Lawrence Lessig could be called a cultural environmentalist. One of America’s most original and influential public intellectuals, his focus is the social dimension of creativity: how creative work builds on the past and how society encourages or inhibits that building with laws and technologies. In his two previous books, CODE and THE FUTURE OF IDEAS, Lessig concentrated on the destruction of much of the original promise of the Internet. Now, in FREE CULTURE, he widens his focus to consider the diminishment of the larger public domain of ideas. In this powerful wake-up call he shows how short-sighted interests blind to the long-term damage they’re inflicting are poisoning the ecosystem that fosters innovation.  All creative works – books, movies, records, software, and so on are a compromise between what can be imagined and what is possible – technologically and legally. For more than two hundred years, laws in America have sought a balance between rewarding creativity and allowing the borrowing from which new creativity springs. The original term of copyright set by the Constitution in 1787 was seventeen years. Now it is closer to two hundred. Thomas Jefferson considered protecting the public against overly long monopolies on creative works an essential government role. What did he know that we’ve forgotten?  Lawrence Lessig shows us that while new technologies always lead to new laws, never before have the big cultural monopolists used the fear created by new technologies, specifically the Internet, to shrink the public domain of ideas, even as the same corporations use the same technologies to control more and more what we can and can’t do with culture. As more and more culture becomes digitized, more and more becomes controllable, even as laws are being toughened at the behest of the big media groups. What’s at stake is our freedom – freedom to create, freedom to build, and ultimately, freedom to imagine.”   To download a PDF book,  urlLink Click here to download    urlLink Free Culture Book website

        Misty and I have been delaying our remodel for our upstairs bathroom for approximately three years. Last time we installed new bath tub then we never finished it for long time. The main reason we can’t decide what we really want because we did not like new tub. To make it short and sweet, we finally went ahead and installed another new tub last month. Everything worked out well at this point.  We went to Home Depot and Lowes number of times and purchased many things for remodeling bathroom. It took us approximately 4 weeks to finish our project. We usually spend time on remodeling our bathroom during my day off and well as Misty’s. I think we did pretty good overall.  Take a look what we’ve done so far with our bathroom.  urlLink Click here to enter gallery.   - Paint walls - Install new tub - Replace wonderboard wall around tub - Install new shower surround walls (3 panels) - Install new insulations - Replace new countertop (marble) and cabinet with six doors - Replace new bath facuet - Install 12x30 wall cabinet - Replace carpet - Replace new medicine cabinet - Replace toilet seat (white) - Replace shower post (white) - all other misc such as caulk, adhesive, some tools, etc.

        Super Bowl 2004  I know everyone is talking about Super Bowl game on February 1st especially half-time where Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake did silly thing front of millions of people on TV.   Anyway, I talked to Lee Germundson (my cousin) who is sports genius – he claimed that this deaf girl from Houston name Suzanna Christy, did perform during pre-game Super Bowl. Apparently, TV network didnt get her on TV at all which leave many of us disappointed. Again, I think it is still wonderful that she get this opportunity to do it whether she get on TV or not.   To view article about Suzanna Christy online, go to:  urlLink Click here   More importantly, if you look at past National Anthem Honor Roll at Super Bowl – they have done it for past 12 years with someone in signing.   Look at history at  urlLink National Anthem Honor Roll History  then scroll down where you will see history.

       Guys,  I finally read “Free Culture” book. The book is all about copyright, p2p, patents, piracy, media, lobby, much more! It gives some history how it begins and why we are doing this. It also suggests that copyright procedure is not perfect with rapidly technologies change today and will see more changes in near future.  “Free Culture” also explain we should move into new system what they called it “common creative”. Some of the author already doing it and others may follow it. The common creative looks pretty good to me. Only time will tell us if it’s going be good alternative methods to meet our today technologies.  Again, I’ve learned few things from this book to understand better why it is very important to author or media that once they own intellectual property, they want to control it forever. It is not possible – Federal did right thing to keep it for time being then release into “public domain”. Unfortunately, there’s too many lobbyist that would pay congressman and senators to push additional bill to keep it under control longer or perhaps forever.  Finally, I do believe that it should be flexibility especially we are in Internet Age now – we can do pretty much anything with power of clicks these days. We will see how we are doing next 5-10 years from today.  In case you haven’t get chance, you definitely should read it.

        See “The Search Tool That Ate My Computer” Commentary By Michael S. Malone    urlLink Good article – perfect example - click here    This is sad but true – I’ve clean it up frequently especially when my two teen daughters whom love to surfing around Internet and they did not realize something happened to our computer.   I understood how difficult it can be when you tried to tell someone not to go certain website that support spyware-ad when they have some cool stuff to look at. I usually tell them not to go this website again but they still does it anyway. Maybe its from another website too.   Once a while, I usually cleaned out all spyware and junks from system myself. Unfortunately, not all of them will go away. Some of them are stubborn and will stay for long time.  urlLink Ad-ware  &  urlLink Norton Anti-Virus  program did not help. It is like too late. I found there’s instruction how to clean it out manually at Norton Anti-Virus website but it is long process. Forget it.   Final word: I am not going spend hours clean it up. Spyware programs may have gotten away from it. Anything like Lycos, iSearch, Xupiter, WildTangent, CursorComet, SaveNow, SmileCentral, n-Case &amp; more – I knew they are sneaky and I have no respect for them at all. Period.

          FYI -- It finally resolved in Fall 2003. Maybe some of you may have similar experience as I did. If so, please share it with us. Many thanks! --gwlj   To Federal Communications Commission, Date: Tue Jun 3, 2003  This is about closed captioning being blocked by their news station "bulletin board" on bottom of the screen during TV series between 4:00 - 4:30 PM and 4:30 - 5:00 PM right before their news is on at 5:00 PM and 6:00 PM. Their bulletin board on bottom of the TV usually last approximately 30 seconds but it will cause some delaying before and after. It will block closed captioning for one minute long. This bulletin board (news & sports, etc.) is separated from their weather announcement and it is not a problem.  I enjoy watch Judge Judy daily on my Replay TV program where I can watch whenever I have free time. Anyway, as you know it occurs when it block closed captioning and I wasn’t able to read what happened at end when Judge Judy gave final result. Who wins? How much they get the money? Blah Blah... Their bulletin board doesn't always occur at the beginning of the shows. Sometime, it occurs during the middle of the show or at end of the show. I like to watch other court-related TV series such as People's Court and it is no problem even with special announcement. (Yes, it is on different channel)  I've been communicated with local FOX TV Station. They do acknowledge about this situation and promised me repeat that it will be correctly with new equipments. It’s been on going for past two years. You will see our conversation via emails. (Theirs and mine since April 2001) This is all I have - - You will find gentleman's name and their email address. Their home website address is  urlLink http://www.fox4news.com  (Dallas & Fort Worth News Station) -- Don't get confused - You may notice their email address is based on parent company which is FOX.com.  Bottom line, I think they put this issue as lowest priority and it’s been either delaying or don’t care what I was complained about it. Maybe there’s not many people complained about it but again, they knew it and promised they would fix it and they did not. It’s getting too long and it is ridiculous. My two daughters who are hearing and they said they could hear them talking just fine while captioning is being block.  Thank you for listening my concern and hope you can help me resolve this issue. Smile!  Best Regards, Grant W. Laird, Jr.  -----Original Message----- From: Grant W Laird Jr  Sent: Monday, June 02, 2003 5:55 AM To: Chip MAHANEY;  Subject: Re: Comments from the Fox TV Dallas Web Site  Hello again,  We are in June 2003 now, which means it was last time I heard from you last January. I still continued see many Judge Judy TV series that block closed captioning when Channel 4 special bulletin board -- What's worst that some of them block the result so I have no way to know which plaintiff or defense win the court. Again this is totally un-necessary -- As you know I am being very patience with you and your company for long time. Seems its not working, I am going take next step and start report to FCC and another agency. I am sorry but this is ridiculous.  gwlj  Chip MAHANEY   wrote: Date: Thu, 09 Jan 2003  Hi Mr. Laird:  I'm sorry this has taken so long. We have received and installed the equipment we need to make this work. One of the key components of this equipment had to be returned to the manufacturer. We just received it back, and it's awaiting installation in the next few days. I've asked our engineers to be updated. If you haven't heard from me in a couple of weeks, please write back.  Thanks again for writing, and Happy New Year! Chip  1/6/2003 6:52:23 AM >>>  Chip,  According to this email converstation since April 2001, it seems to be on-going delaying for almost two years. It is ridiculous. Again, I am doing a follow-up with you and see if you were able to make it possible to view closed captioned without blocking at all during the scroll message for FOX4 News.  Let me know. Thanks!  gwlj  Chip MAHANEY wrote:  Hi Grant:  Better news this time. Our engineering chief says that the equipment is in house and has been installed. One of our engineers has been trying to configure it, but has not yet found the magic formula to make it look right on TV. I'm told we hope to have it fully working in the next couple of weeks. If another month passes, and you still have concerns, please feel free to write again.  Thanks for writing FOX 4.  Chip Mahaney KDFW FOX 4 News  10/25/2002 8:13:57 AM >>>  Hello again,  I believe last time I get back to you last February 2002 regarding closed captioning (CC) problem on TV. During the special scroll message provided by Fox News on Judge Judy TV shows on weekday at 4:00 and 4:30 PM, we continued see same thing by blocking CC while Fox News Scroll begins which sometime missed the final decision by Judge Judy. It is very disappointment that its been delaying too long. What's going on? Let me know. Thanks.  Grant Laird Jr.  Chip MAHANEY wrote:  Hi again:  Thanks for keeping up with this. We appreciate hearing from you. We still have not purchased the product we need. But coincidentally, we just had a meeting with a vendor who sells a product that we like very much, that addresses this problem. I'm told this is a top priority in our capital budget, and we hope to be able to purchase it for on-air use later this year. Sorry I don't have a more exact timeline, but rest assured your concern is something we want to address, and soon.  Thanks again for writing FOX 4.  Chip Mahaney KDFW FOX 4 News  2/5/2002 3:19:09 AM >>>  Hello there!  Its been a while since last time I emailed to you regarding about FOX Flashes that affected closed captioning. Recently I saw different kind of flashes display on TV however closed captioning still not working every time it display.   I would appreciate it if you can follow it up and let me know. Thanks!  gwlj  --- KDFW FOX 4 Dallas wrote:  Hi again:  I've got bad news and some possible good news. The bad news is the equipment purchase has been delayed. The possible good news is that we're looking to do the FOX Flashes in another way that will not cut off closed captioning. I don't have an exact time for implementation, but I expect this will happen in the coming weeks.  Thanks for writing FOX 4.

I still watch Judge Judy show but it continued to be a problem with closed captioning (CC) as I already mentioned from the beginning. Anyway, did you able to get new equipment and install lately? I cant wait.....  Also, sometime FOX News do not show closed captioning once a while. I dont recall which time slot that do not have CC but do you have any idea if FOX News do offer all the times or only specific time slot?

Fox TV Dallas Web Site 4/28/2001 1:10:59 AM >>>  Comment:   Ma'am or Sir,  I enjoyed watching Judge Judy on FOX 4 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM everyday. Unfortunately, FOX 4 news always appear special bulletin news on bottom of the TV during the Judge Judy show (when it make show smaller) -- what happened when it does, it make closed captioning turn off. My two hearing daughters who can hear told me they still can hear it okay but no closed captioning. My recommendation to you is STOP doing this way every 30 minutes and look into another alternative for special bulletin news. I would appreciated it.   By the way, my wife and I are deaf and we rely on closed captioning all the times. I would love to hear your feedback. Thanks!
