      Yes, it seems that it is.  It's a Bible! It's a fashion mag! Stop; you're both right.  urlLink Revolve  is a new teen bible in fashion magazine format.  There are already a couple of articles about this ( urlLink Detroit Free Press  and urlLink Philly inquirer )so I won't say much more abut it here other than to say, yes, it's as bad as you imagine.

      I went there today.  lotsa cool stuff, but also lotsa dull stuff.  I loved the modern art stuff.  Loved the impressionist stuff.  Gorgeous colors.  I'm not so impressed by the bowls and cups and things.  I wonder if 200 years from now my boston red sox three dee animated plastic souvineer cup will be in a museum as an example of "early 21st century ripoff; plastic and ink. a gift of the john J. and elizabeth wanker collection"

      Is there such a thing as a bad college movie?  I don't think so.  There's one on tv right now.  It's about these college kids, and they start a club where they get together and eat chicken and watch porn  (fittingly enough, it's called  urlLink Porn n, Chicken ).  The dean tries to shut it  down.  Comedy ensues. Although the author  of the snooty review of it on imdb would like a little more intellectual stimulation out of this fine example of the genre, I'm thouroughly enjoying it.  And I didn't realize that Comedy Central puts nekkid asses on tv during the day.  Butt they do.

This won't be all bad as Comedy central has some quality urlLink late night programming , from Insomniac to The Critic and Futureama.  I'm becoming a fan of the  urlLink Style   urlLink Channel  too. I will leave the house today. Even if it's just to go outside and come right back in again.

      I've spent how many hours in front of this screen?  So the last time I studied html, I was 20 years old, and style sheets weren't being used yet, so I'm finding it a slow trial and error process to figure out what all the code on this page means.  It's so very addictive; kind of like a message board, only without all the other people.   Even though my only readers are my mom and my girlfriend, I can't seem to stop fiddling with things here.  Maybe some day I'll write something psuedointellectual, or at least mildly interesting.  Like why the url is spelled wrong, or the contents of my sock drawer (it's socks at the moment).  But for now it's just the contents of my brain, and an attempt to make anyone reading this as bored as I am.  urlLink School  doesn't start till a week from tuesday, my brother and sister in law are in  urlLink Minnesota , my girl with her gorgeous brown eyes won't be here till forever,  I haven't showered in a day and a half, and I'm all hopped up on caffeine.  I suppose I should be getting a head start on reading for my classes, but I don't think that's really likely today.  I might try to leave the house at some point though.

      Why isn't spam as interesting as infomercials?  I could watch that guy talk about tiny classified ads all night long, but I don't even open the email from Dana telling me about generic viagra.  Why can't the email at least be interesting?  A little story about a guy named Phil who couldn't get it up, and found salvation in a little blue pill.  Or an amusing anecdote from a woman who was dissatisfied with her man's manliness, and bought him enlargement pills online.  Something juicy and entertaining; something that might make me read or open those emails for the entertainment value.

      I've always liked coffee, but I don't think I ever got irreversibly hooked until I started working in  urlLink coffee    urlLink shops .  I love the ritual of it.  Steam rolling off a mug, a few drops of cream swirling around in the blackness.  When it's good there's a thickness to it, an oily layer full of goodness floating on top.  I have dozens of coffee mugs all of which I love.  there are the  urlLink sci-fi  movie marathon ones, a bowling mug, footballasaurus, batman and robin, and scooby doo.  But my favorie mug is my newest.  It's one of those stainless steel jobbies, a travel mug that was given to me recently.  It's slick and shiny and has panda bear stickers along the bottom.

      I was sitting in the corner of one of those breakfast all day greasy spoons, very late at night, the only people there were drunks and truck drivers.  They have coffee at these places.  It sits on this electrically heated plate, in a glass pitcher sometimes called a carafe.  The handles on the carafes are color coded, orange for decaf and brown for regular, or what fat balding men trying to be original refer to as unleaded and high test, not realizing that Dot or Alice, who has varicose veins and sagging breasts, who nevertheless used to be beautiful once, and when the light shines through the plate glass window that overlooks the parking lot bounces off the table just right, still is, has heard the orange and brown handled carafes referred to in this way every day for the last fifteen years.  The electrically heated plate is called a warmer, but its primary function is to extract flavor from the coffee above it, and replace it with viscosity.   It's always over-bright in these places.  Fluorescents are the first real light to hit your eyes, except for the occasional headlight from a truck with eye level bumpers, in hours. And Dot, I'm sorry, but this is not one of those magical moments when the light bounces just so, making your skin translucent enough to make out the cheerleader inside of you; it's the fluorescents, I decide, highlighting those fabulous chin whiskers that any twelve year old boy would be proud of.  Dot fills my coffee before I'm half done with it, and I think she secretly wants me to finish the pot so she can make a new batch and give herself something to do between now and her three a.m. lunch break.  The cream sits in little stainless steel pitchers, next to Heinz and sometimes, usually south of the Mason-Dixon line, Tabasco, getting dangerously close to room temperature, and when nuggets of coagulated dairy product slip silently into your coffee, you try to convince yourself that you did not see what you know you just saw, and you smile back at Dot.  I watched the cream creep toward uniformity.  And even though I know that if I had started at the same time that the universe started, I would not have succeeded yet, I try to unstir my coffee.

      Ok so i just saw this commercial on tv for the Robosweep which is, you guessed it, a robotic broom that runs along your floor sweeping without falling downstairs or even knocking over a full wineglass.  The people on tv looked so so so happy to have a robosweep.  I think i need one for two payments of 19.95.

      Lines  They love lines here.  Need to take a leak?  Wait in line.  Need to check a book out of the library? Wait in line.  Need to buy a book from the campus bookstore? Wait in line.  Want to get a cup of coffee? Wait in line. Need to sign up for health insurance on the last day of open enrollment? Wait in a really really long line.  On the bright side, I'm now the girlfriend of a sex god.  I mean, I now have health insurance.  Yay!  I can get hurt or sick now! At least for the next six months.

      Harold Bloom had  urlLink this  to say about Stephen King and J. K. Rowling.  I can understand being upset because someone won an award, and you don't think he should have won.  But what did J. K. ever do to you Bloomy?  And he's right, "Harry Potter will not lead our children on to Kipling's Just So Stories or his Jungle Book. It will not lead them to Thurber's Thirteen Clocks or Kenneth Grahame's Wind in the Willows or Lewis Carroll's Alice." HP will only lead to more HP and HP related products, but what will lead them on to the classics is confidence in their reading ability and the gentle (or not so gentle) urgings of their  urlLink friendly neighborhood children's bookseller .

        Bowdoin is in the heart of Brunswick, Maine   Temple is in North Philly  City chicks wear revealing clothes; Maine chicks wear bulky sweaters (by chicks, I mean, of course, poultry, not an archaic term for women, wymyn, wimmin, or grrrrrrrls).  Maine is known for lobsters; lobster sucks. Philly is known for Cheesesteaks; cheesesteaks are amazingly good. In Maine you have signs that say, "Danger rugby chicks! Moose crossing;) in Philly you have signs that say, "no guns allowed in bank." Philly is an up and coming city full of character, characters, cool bars and restaurants, theaters, and art museums.  And, as we all know,  urlLink Maine is boring

        Bowdoin has around 2,000 people on campus at any one time, including staff   Temple has approximately one Bazillion people  This means that trying to get anywhere on campus is a pain in the ass.  A crowd at Bowdoin is when three people gather together under a tree (i'ts in the student handbook). Today there was some sort of event on the main thouroughfair.  All these stupid stupid people in my way not moving anywhere, but looking at tables set up in the best possible location to impede the flow of foot traffic.  There was a bad band there too, with nobody listening.  I guess Camp Bo-Bo and TU are the same in that respect: nobodly likes a shitty band.

      So I'm sure that lots of people have thought of this already, but I was getting ready today, I took a shower, took my time shaving, spent time on my outfit, put product in my hair (starting from the back and working forwards of course), tzujed my sleeves, my hair, spent time wondering about whether the shit looked better tucked or untucked or partially tucked.  And I had this thought.  All these straight men mimicking queer style.  If I were a cultural critic in training, I'd point out that in saying we like the way these gay men dress, we are saying that there is something we find attractive about these gay men.  We like the way they look.  We identify with them enough to mimic their style.  The show is a very clever way of teasing out the latent homoerotic tendencies of the straight man.

      Hi gang,  I watched the  urlLink Pats  game on tv today.  It was fun.  Then I fell asleep on the couch for about an hour and a half.  School is great.  I'm really enjoying my classes.  I am reading a lot of philosophy, which is great fun for me.  I have a class on Romantic poetry and we won't have read a poem for class until the third week of the semester.  So far we have read some Diderot, some Kant and some Foucoult.  The prof is cool and he says that you can't study Romantic poetry without studying the  urlLink Enlightenment philosophy  that these guys were working with.   And I'm taking a class on major American authors since 1900.  On the list so far are T. S. Eliot, William Carlos Williams, and Hemingway.  The prof for that class is cool too. And my last class is about critical methods.  Essentially a theory of literary studies class.  This is also heavy on the philosophy, which suits me just fine.

      I'm watching philly cable access right now.  And yes, I'm aware that there are probably more entertaining and more productive ways to be spending my tuesday afternoon (writing haiku perhaps?). But the show on right now is called animation creation.  It seems to be a bunch of shorts of stop action animation done with a video recorder and action figures.  Some of them are actually quite good.   This reminds me of my childhood best friend Dave Peterson.  We spent most of our time together from kindergarten through junior high, but sort of lost touch after beginning to attend Woburn senior High School.  Dave Peterson's dad (aka dave peterson) had a video camera, and we would use it to make short films and do stop action animation.  We took his mom's kitchen magnets and did some neat animation stuff on the kitchen table.   Anyway this animation show got me thinking about dave, and I thought that maybe if i put up a post about dave, he will google himself at some point and find my page, email me and we can be reunited, or at least get on each other's mailing list for christmas cards, not that isend out christmas cards or anything, but you get the point.   Now i realize that there are probably better ways of going about finding dave peterson.  I'm sure that when you do a google search on dave peterson, you get a billion hits.

The house is really really nice, but the room is smaller than a federal prison cell.  10 feet by 9 feet.  but maybe i want it anyway?  it's cheap and in a great section of town.  basketball hoops across the street, two grocery stores around the corner, the roomates seem cool, a gorgeous new kitchen, a sun room.  if i had 1 more foot of space there wouldn't be a question, but this thing is small.  room for a bed, a small desk.  that's it.

      All day.  I'm locked in the house today, reading for my classes.  Trying to get everything done in time to watch the Patriots play the Eagles on sunday.  cuz I like drinkin' and watchin' football.  Which is a nice segue into a letter I got from a reader this morning:  Dear Dreamy Steve, When I go to bars, I see all these people drinking fun looking drinks out of oversized glasses.  I want to join the "in" crowd and order a pretentious beverage the next time I go out, but I'm not quite sure how to do it.  Can you help? -Pretentious Ambitions in PA  Well PA in PA I know that all those drink choices can be daunting if you don't know your way around a trendy bar.  have no fear, Dreamy Steve will help. Martinis are a great choice if you want to appear pretentious.  Having said this, I should warn you that many people think they taste like lighter fluid.  But you don't have to actually drink it; we're just going for appearance here. Go to your favorite dive bar, get good and lubricated, then stride confidently to a hipper, trendier bar, and order a Bombay martini, dry with olives.   Carry this around with you for instant pretentious cred.  And don't worry about drinking the damn thing, you'll spill half of it just walking from the bar to your group of new friends. Hope this helps PA.  have a question for Dreamy Steve?  leave it as a comment.

      Recently, some of  urlLink you  have been bemoaning the single girl's dining options.  You said to me, "Steve, I like cooking, and I like eating, and all that, but it's so hard to cook just for one, couldn't there be some sort of eating or dining club for people like me?  You're so dreamy, can't you help me come up with some sort of solution? Thanks a lot, Hungry in Harvard Square."  Well HIHS, I am  urlLink dreamy . And of course I can help you. Of course, you could start an eating or cooking club if you wanted to, but you've already stumbled upon that option.  And diffrent schedules can make finding a common mealtime a chore rather than a joy.  Besides, sometimes you just don't want to watch other people eat, not to mention the bothersome talking.  But that doesn't mean you have to eat poorly.  There's a new cookbook written just for you:  urlLink Solo Suppers .  You can buy it and other wonderful titles from  urlLink Wordsworth  and NOT from other multinational online booksmellers named after certain jungles.   You should be able to cook tasty and easy meals just for one.  While you're at it, why not open a bottle of wine just for you; you're worth it.  Maybe you can even get lucky with yourself.    Have a question? Need advice? Want a children's book recommendation? email  urlLink Dreamy Steve . for answers to all your questions.

      I found ten dollars on the sidewalk this morning.  I was walking to school, and I saw something flitter through my field of vision and even though I wasn't really paying attention to it, somehow my subconcious was able to alert my concious that there was something good on the ground and I should go in for a closer look.  Ten one dollar bills folded together, two of them had blown a few feet away from the others, and I swooped down and pocketed them.  It was like the universe knew that I could really use ten dollars and made it appear in front of me.  I wonder if there is some sort of money uncertanty principle that causes cash to jump into and out of existence like particles in a vacuum.  If this money dissappeared from your pocket and reappeared in front of me on the sidewalk, I'm sorry, but you will have to adress all requests for refunds to: The Universe everywhere all space, and time 01801  so far I have purchased a toothbrush and a package of dental floss, both cvs brands, for $1.99 each.  I plan to put the other $6.02 to good use; I will not squander the universe's gift of cashola.

      I had my first monday class today, romantic poetry.  I think I'm going to like it, because 1. the first two weeks reading assignments are all philosophers: kant, foucoult (I think i've terribly mangled the spelling) and somebody else.  I like philosophy.  I'm jazzed at the prospect of learning about romantic poetry by reading influential philosophy. The prof has said that the only real way to study something like romanticism is by studying the ideas that those folks were trying to work with, hence the philosophy and the assignment of an Austen novel in a poetry class.  2. the prof is delightfully nutty.  He seems great, has a sense of humor, and has told us that he is not a touchy feely kind of teacher, meaning that he will not tell us what we just said is interesting if it is in fact stupid.  He has encouraged us to speak up in class with the warning that he will probably trash what we say, but that we should fight back, and that we won't learn much by sitting back and smiling politely while someone else says something we dissagree with.  He made it sound like every week will be an intellectual battle.  He actually kind of reminded me of a football coach a little bit.

      I went to look at an apartment in a great little section of town.  It was small and dirty, with no utilities included.  But the kitchen.... well I'm sure it was efficient.  If you open the oven, you can't stand in front of it, and you get to choose between putting a toaster on the counter and not using the counter, and the fridge opens out into the living room.   I think I'm going to keep looking.

It's an open source comic book character, meaning that anyone can use the character for any reason without worrying about copyrights or whatever. Her superpower is that she can exist in all dimensions at once, thus cleverly avoiding continuity issues when she goes on adventures that are mutually exclusive.

      Spike tv, the first network for men, has got some quality programming.    Really, watch an episode before you write this show off.  urlLink  Stiperella  is part wonder woman and part Barbarella; a "stripper by night. crimefighter by later night." Pam Anderson is the voice in this really really wacky animated series by Stan Lee.  Yes,  that  Stan Lee.  The episode I saw last night featured Cheapo the dicsount villan.  His henckmen share one gun, and he rips off the 89 cent store.  The final showdown over the worlds largest cubic zirconium imitation diamond (valued at over $300) in the World's Largest Items Museum is hilarious.  Picture the world's largest vibrting banana, world's largest key and keyhole, and a sign showing visitors where the world's largest    pen is   located, and you get the picture.  The animation is top notch, and the jokes are high and lowbrow enough for everyone, except the humorless.       And the Most Extreme Elimination Challenge ( urlLink MXC ) is something that I don't think can really be described.   It appears to be a Japanese game show, dubbed entirely with jokes that appear to have little or nothing to do with anything going on on screen.  A bunch of people competing in games that inevitably end up with people taking really really hard falls from high heights or into solid structures.  Vic Romano and Kenny Blankenship announce with side kicks like Guy LaDouche that remind me of  urlLink Benny Hill

He was supposed to call me around 4:30 to let me know what time, probably around 6:30 he said; he wasn't sure what time he would be leaving campus.  he never called me the inconsiderate asshole.  maybe he read my manifesto?  maybe he thought I sounded like a nutcase?  maybe he won the lottery? maybe he found the perfect roomate elsewhere?  I'll never know.  Stupid stupid potential roomate.

      I'm looking for an apartment.  It should be large and spacious.  It should have no other occupants.  It should be located in a great section of town.  It should have hardwood floors.  It should have a great kitchen with a gas stove, a large refridgerator, plenty of storage space, lots of counter space, and a dishwasher.  It should be cheap.   I've decided that I don't like roomates.  I don't want one or three.  I don't want a male rock star.  I don't want a female librarian.  I don't want a cat lover or a neat freak. I don't want a loner who dissapears into his room at 5.  I don't want someone who wants to tell me about his day at work, his trouble with his boyfriend, or the rash on his back. I want to know that when I leave something somewhere, it will still be in the same spot when I get home.  I want to walk around naked.  I don't want to be reminded of bills or the expiration date on the milk.  I want to leave dishes in the sink for a week.  I want to clean everything with bleach.    I want to use dial up internet service for hours and hours.  I want to make a diet coke can pyramid.  I want to escape the tyranny of other people.  I want to exist in a cocoon of individuality.  Like Superman's fortress of solitude.  I want to stay up till four in the morning reading ts eliot.  I want to play jazz and cook bacon at 9 in the morning and read the newspaper all day in my boxer shorts.

      Ok.  So I just saw this Miller High life commercial, and there are  a bunch of folks sitting around a table and a beeper goes off and the guy goes outside to use the payphone, and the shop is Twin donughts in Union square allston.  I used to live right around the corner from there up until recently.  I would go there on Sunday afternoons and get two large coffees, a bacon egg and cheese on an english muffin, and two chocolate donuts to bring back to my place and consume while I fought off a hangover and read the Globe.  Every time I walked in the lady behind the counter would remember exactly how I liked my coffee (just cream, no sugar) and she would start making it before I even got to the counter.  Once I decided that I needed to try to save money by making coffee at home, and I stopped going there for a few months.  I ran out of coffee one day, so I stopped in to get a coffee.  The lady saw me and said, "large just cream, right?"  she hadn't seen me for months, but she rememberd my coffee.   Well, this commercial takes place in and around that twin donuts, and I have two comments about the commercial: 1. you can't buy beer there, because it's in Massachusetts, land of crappy liquor laws.  and 2. if the guy has a beeper, why does he have to go out to a payphone, shouldn't he have a cell? Does this commercial run in boston?

      No one laughed at me or tried to steal my lunch money.  any would be bullies would be sorely dissapointed if he tried to steal my money, since I have none.  the bookstore still doesn't have any of the books for my classes in yet, which is a problem as i have reading assignments already.  (yes, I'm aware I should be able to get the books from the library thank you very much).

      I'd like to begin by saying that I know that it is wrong to find humor in this.  There's nothing funny about it. I'm a bad human being, and I'm only compounding my crimes against humanity by relating this here.  I was flipping through the cable channels.  I came across a cable access channel.  And there was a man sitting at a desk with a device in front of him.  The man has some sort of a physical disability.  He could not speak and he appeared to have limited control over the movements of his body.  He was poking the device in front of him with a stick, and each time he poked it, the device would speak in a computer synthesized voice.  Each. Word. Was. Spoken. Individually. While. He. Poked. The. Device.  This, by itself is not funny.  But in the corner of the screen, was a woman doing the sign language interperetation of what the man was saying through the synthesized voice.  And she looked really confused waiting for each word to be pronounced before making the hand motions.    Ok.  Maybe that's not funny.  But I laughed.  I'm sorry.

       i had strange dreams last night about being in college, only it looked more like an old folks home.  i was wandering around the halls and I couldn't find my apartment then I finally found it, but it was summertime, and over the summer they had a yardsale or a bake sale or something, some sort of retail operation, and they relocated all the student stuff out of their apartments.  But i didn't know that (nobody told me) until i got to my apartment and there was a sign that said that my stuff had been relocated to the gym.  When I got to the gym I found my stuff haning on a rack, but all that was there was one black polo shirt and a couple of empty hangers.  But then I also found this trunk that had women's underware in it that was also somehow my trunk, and they were all different sizes, but all varients of "small"  ranging from "small' to extra extra small.

      I was competing in some gameshow with my friend Chip.  all the questions were multiple choice, a b c or d.  We were neck and neck and then  we were tied at the final question which was worth more  points than the other questions.  I had my question first.  But instead of being like all the other questions, where they asked it, then one by one  the answers appeared, it was this long list of unrelated  words, and I had a couple of seconds to memorize them, then I  had to repeat them.  I tried my best but I could only  remember the first word on the list.  I felt bad, but was  still hopeful that maybe Chip wouldn't do well either (the  prize, by the way, was one million dollars).  then chip gets  up for his question, and it was just like all the other ones,  a question and four answer choices.  and it was a really easy  question too.  so he gets it right and wins the million  dollars, and I felt bad because I lost, but I also felt  cheated, so I started complaining to my frineds that my  question was harder than his, and the worst part of the whole  dream was that my other friend Sean didn't care, he thought I was  being a whiner and a complainer, and I lost fair and square.   I was so upset.

      I had a great trip to my local  urlLink Target store  today.  I'm torn about good old target though.  On the one hand, I feel like they are evil, like the Yankees, driving out small buisiness, employing sweatshop labor, taking up vast amounts of land in the suburbs, contributing to urban sprawl, and the like.  But then there's the part of me that loves the store.  I can get everything all at one place, and it's cheap.  (I got a nice shirt for 3.98, and three pairs of cute boxers (55 percent cotton, 45percent polyesther) for 7.99.  How great is that?

      When this first came out, i didn't really like it.  It wasn't lemony (snicket) enough, and had a mediciney (tnicket) taste to it, like when you open up a packet of sweet and low and taste it by itself.  but recently, i don't know if they have changed the formula, or if i have killed enough taste buds or brain cells since i first tried it, i can't get enough of the stuff now.  So much so that when I drank a bottle of regular diet coke this afternoon, i was surprised that it wasn't lemon flavored.  wierd, huh?

So if you get something interesting in your inbox please forward it to  urlLink me , and put "fun junkmail" in the comments field.  Yes, I want more junkmail.  But please, only if it is fun, different, interesting or otherwise noteworthy.  None of the typical, "please her" or "male enhancement-naturally!" emails.  And nothing that is going to get me arrested for having it on my computer.  Unless it's really funny.

      This is a question I have been thinking about lately, and I don't so much mean me, steve as I mean me, and the career path I've chosen.  Do literary critics have any relevancy outside of the classroom?  If I am in a position of claiming that a book has literary merit, that it's an important book, say The Sound and the Fury, and that some other book, say, Harry Potter, just isn't in the same league, how is that relevant to the millions of people who  love  HP?  How can I reconcile a judgment that a piece of work has no literary merit with the fact that it is read and enjoyed by a lot of people?  (and, just for the record, I really really like HP, and I think that there is something like literary merit there, despite what Harold Bloom sez, I'm just using it as an example)  The work in literary theory over the last 50 years or so has had the advantage that it made people who interpret texts relevant to the worlds in general (I'm thinking of things like feminism, cultural studies, deconstruction, marxism).  If you think , like I do, that they got something fundamentally wrong, where does that leave you?  Would i rather be right, or relevant?

      check out  urlLink foresight exchange .  Remember all that to do over the pentagon's terrorism futures market?  this is a site that lets you bet fake money on the likelyhood of real events happening.  anything from outcomes of elections to assasinations and sporting events.  it's all based on some heavy economic theories that point to the likelyhood of futures markets giving accurate information on future events by distilling the hunches, guesses, and informed decisions of thousands of people into one number.  The pentagon's terrorism market was intended to do the same thing, but it got tanked because people didn't understand what it was about.

I think it is as good as anything written by an American.  It is an incredibly patient book though; I'm not saying that you shouldn't read it on the subway, just that I think you'll get a lot more out of it if you read it in a quiet room somewhere.

I was trying to say something to my dad, and i had a loose tooth and I was trying to keep the tooth in place with my tounge, but it came out and i looked at it and there was this decaying hole on the side of it and i thought "that's what you get for not flossing"  usually in this dream, my tooth just comes loose and falls out, and I never know the cause of it.  And sometimes it is a front tooth that crumbles away without getting loose first.

      so something I had forgotten about the working world until my recent re-entry: breaktime.  15 mins is such a nice little thing.  Like when you really want cake, and the person passing out the slices gives you your piece first, and you feel lucky an special.  But it's also really short and dissapointing, like when they finalkly give out the last piece of cake to the last person who has been waiting patiently but thinking impatiently, and you have already finished your piece of cake an you are looking around jealously at everyboy who still has cake left.  Or does that just happen to me?

In one dream, I got kicked out of school because I cited a source in the body of the paper, but forgot to include the bibliographic information in the works cited.  They accused me of plagarism, and I kept thinking, "but i cited the author in the text; i wasn't trying to pass it off as my own idea" but they didn't seem to care.

      My landlord/roomate went to florida on business.   which is fine. And his mom came over to feed the cats. which is fine; cats gots to eat. But she's Sleeping here! Which is fine, except she's in the bathroom, and I need to shower, and go out to the hardware store. And her awful little dog is here. And she's always around. But I feel bad about not wanting her to be here because she's really nice.

      And for those who just don't have anything better to do at work. I installed an ethernet card, and set up a little home network the other day.  The helpful people at HP had pretty good directions about how to open up your computer, and install a PCI card.  With one exception.  they say to remove the expansion slot cover, without any further explaination.  The expansion slot cover, it turns out, is attached tot he body of the computer with small metal tabs.  I think that the idea is to bend htem back and forth a couple of times until they break off.  That's what I tried anyway, but then I noticed that doing so was pushing this metal piece into something that looked vaugely important.  So I took a pair of pliers (actually the pliers part of my Swiss Army Multitool) and pulled it towards me.  It came off.  But in the process I jammed this metal expansion slot cover into the heel of my palm and started dripping blood everywhere.  I don't think it needs stitches, but I think I will have a neat scar.  But that's ok cuz pain is temporary, glory lasts forever, and chicks dig scars, right?

B. Blogging my head off even though I have gone weeks without posting a thing just because it's not being productive.  C. Watching cable and eating cheezy poofs.

      hey.  Thanksgiving was awesome, but if you're reading this, there's a high probablility that you were there, and therefore already knew that.  Lauren's Mom's turkey was wonderful, nice and juicy and tender, and all the fixins were great.  We mad this amazingly heavy bread pudding from a reciopie we found online and it turned out good too.  Woburn won the turky bowl, i believe, because of our big Woburn hearts.  It's really no surprise that we would beat out a bunch of white collar prep school chums who live in Winchester but all have glass houses on the cape.

      I'm enjoying classes so far this semester.  I've got one class in Documentary Poetics, and I think that I don't really like documentary poems all that much.  Maybe I just don't get them.  But it seems a little cheap and gimicky to me sometimes.  Like rearanging pieces of newspaper articles and putting them together and making it into a poem.  They also seem, at least so far, to all be overtly political, which is fine, just not my cup of tea.   I'm happy as a clam in my 20th Century African American fiction class because we are jeading nothing but philosophy for the first three weeks.   And my class in Modern Drama is quite interesting, the prof is funny, i'm reading lots of plays that I should really already be familiar with, but I'm not.

      So on my way to campus this morning, I took what I thought were two subway tokens with me.  I found out after depositing one of my coins into the subway-turnstile-coin-taking-thing, that really, one of them was a quarter.  So, a little upset that I just lost a quarter, I deposited my token and went to campus.  Once I finally got to the gym, I found out that all the rental lockers are full.  I spotted pay lockers (different from the rental ones) thak take a quarter to work.  My mind raced back to the quarter i had lost this morning (i realize that i didn't mean to bring the quarter in the first place, but had I deposited my actual token instead of the quarter, i might have found that quarter in my time of need.  Already cold and grumbling from my excursion to the bursar's office, i happened to look down on the ground, and there is a shiny quarter at my feet, like the universe put it there just for me, following some conservation of lost quarters law.  and the best part is, that after my workout, I found out that the lockers give you the quarter back when you return the key!!

      I went onto temple's website, and looked to see what I needed to do to use the gym.  I found out that   urlLink "All Temple undergraduate students taking12 credit hours or more and graduate students taking 9 hours or more are automatically assessed a student recreation fee per semester. This fee entitles you to use the ibc Student Rec Center, the Student Pavilion, and Pool 30 in Pearson Hall.  All others must pay a recreation user fee."  I even called the fitness center and asked if I needed to fill out any paperwork or pay any additional fees.  the answer was, "no, not as long as you are registered for 9 or more credits."  Since I am regisetered for 9 or more credits, I went to the gym this morning in my gym stuff.  I handed over my id to be scanned to gain entrance to the gym, and was told that I haven't paid my student recreation fee.  But I have, i insisted, i was charged $150 in fees, I have my card right here that proves I paid my activities fee. "that's a different fee.  this is a recreation fee.  if you're not registered for 9 credits, you have to pay the fee." But, I  am  registered for 9 credits. "oh," clickity clikcity clack "you are a center city student, your'e not registered on the main campus.  you have to be registered for 9 credits at the main campus." But I'm  not  a center city student, I'm in a regular program at the regular campus.  Last semester all my classes were at the main campus; this semester two are downtown, and one is at the main campus. "yeah.  you're a center city student.  you'll have to pay the fee" can I pay the fee now? or can you add it to my bill? "no, you have to go to the bursar's office, they won't let us take money here." So after a trip to the bursar's office to pay another fee, and a trip to the student recreation administrative office to sign waivers, I trucked off to the gym. Hah!  take that Temple!  your beurocracy cannot thwart my fitness efforts!  I laugh at your multiple dispersed offices!  I pshaw at your assesment of fees! I am unstoppable! I do wonder, though, if I couldn't pay a fee at the gym, why could I pay one at the computer center when I picked up my antivirus software?  I don't think the computer center is the bursar's office, so why can they add a fee to my bll, when the gym can't hmmmm?

      After spending a month with my favorite mac, I think i'm becoming a convert.  the main reason is sherlock, which is an amazing little program.  So now that i'm back with my trusty pc, i've been searching for a windows based equivilant.  It doesn't seem to exist.  But what does exist is Google.  They are going to take over the world, and when they are done, it will be a much, much better place.  The stuff they have going over at urlLink google labs  is just amazing.  I downloaded the deskbar, which lets you search from your desktop instead of having to open up the browser.  It sounds lazy, but i prefer to think of it as amazingly efficient.  also search by location will make finding the phone number of the pizza place around the corner much easier, you type in your search, and an address or zip, and you get a map with whatever you searched for marked on it.  lots of other cool stuff, but these seem to be the most useful so far.

      I've heard some people talking recently about the presidential race, and about the last election and elections in general, and some people i know have said that we should get rid of the electoral college and elect our president directly so as to keep a situation like we had in 2000 where gore won the popular vote and lost the election from happening again.  as much as i want bush out of office, really, i think the electoral college is a good thing.  here's a quote from  urlLink Approval Voting: Rational, Constitutional Electoral Reform by Paul Hager  that sums up why: "The Electoral College also imposes a requirement on a successful candidate that the popular vote be sufficiently distributed to obtain a majority, which prevents regional domination.  Very few Presidents have won the Electoral College with victories in a minority of the states.  George W. Bush pieced together his victory by winning 31 states (over 60%).  Had Gore won, it would have been with the lowest percentage of states in history.  (In comparison, Kennedy had 46% of the states in 1960 and Carter had 47% in 1976.)   It is worth noting that around 1/3 of Al Gore's popular vote margin over George W. Bush came from Washington, D.C alone where Gore got 86% of the popular vote." the system keeps politicians from ignoring the needs of less populous states.

         confusing "e.g." and "i.e."  "e.g." stands for "exempli gratia," or "for example;" "i.e." stands for "id est ," or "that is." Both should be followed by a comma, just like the longhand versions of those phrases. misuse of the phrase "begging the question"  "to beg the question" means to assume as a premise the thing you are trying to prove.  Please don't use it when you mean "the question begs to be asked." misuse of "literally."  When you use the word "literally" you are saying that the phrase it modifies is to be taken in its literal, rather than in its metaphorical sense.  You cannot, e.g., say, "literally, he was ten feet tall," unless he really was ten feet tall.  This one really bothers me because I do it often when I'm not paying attention: using "your" when you mean "you're," or vise versa.  One is a possessive pronoun; one is a contraction of "you" and "are."

      and I say let's grab a tube of  urlLink K Y Jelly  and lube up that slippery slope!  urlLink some people  are trying to argue that if we allow same sex marriages, pretty soon we'll be sanctioning unions between men and goldfish or that we'll have hordes of people marrying each other.  I say what a consenting adult chooses to do with a consenting toaster is none of the government's concern.  Besides, my toaster has a much better health insurance plan than I do.  But seriously, I've yet to come across a good reason to keep same sex marriages from happening.  and several good reasons to let them happen.  Although I do wonder, if you are a member of the clergy in a state that mandates same sex marriages be allowed to happen, are you legally obligated to perform the marriage, or do you get to choose which ones you want to do?  Because I'd be against forcing any non-government official to perform any religious ceremony she didn't want to perform.  Also, in the movies they always say, "by the power vested in me by the state of Whatever..." does the power to perform the marriage really come from the state?  and if so, does that make a clergyperson performing a marriage a government official?

      I just read Theresa Hak Kyung Cha's  urlLink Dictee , and my initial reaction was that it was a tremendous waste of paper.  For anyone not familiar with it, it's full of halting sentences that don't seem to make a whole lot of sense when you read it, but really sort of do if you readjust your expectations.  We read articles about it that talked about clarity being a tool of the establishment to dictate linguistic norms, and I kept thinking that anything that relies on non-clarity to make meaning is suspect as far as I'm concerned (which, I assume, makes me part of the anti-opacity establishment).  And if you're a critic, relying on an aesthetic of non-clarity is a career threatening position, because if the text really does rely on opacity, any attempt to say anything about it removes that opacity and takes the teeth out of the text, so you're left either not saying anything about it, or saying something and trying to negate its goal of opacity. But after three hours of talking about it in class, I think i kind of like it.  I at least think it deserves a re-reading.

      It's one of those amazing little moments when 10 mins of sleep seems like hours.  you wake up only partially, and drift off to sleep so it seems like you are experiencing time and sleeping at the same time.......Holy crap!  it's 11:44!  I have class at 12:00!  I'm a five minute walk, a half hour subway ride, a ten minute walk, and a 3 minute wait for the elevator from class.  get dressed.  stumble downstairs.  walk fast.  just make train.  everything takes much less time than i thought.  only 15 mins late for class.  and i had forgotten that the prof starts the class at 12:10 so he has time to eat lunch, making me only five mins late.  But like my football coach used to say, "if you're not five minutes early, you're already ten minutes late."  which I think means that as far as he's concerned I got to class sometime around thursday.

      I love my commodore 64.

I remember being so happy when I finally figured out and finished Maniac Mansion.  That may have been the best game ever, and one of the highlights of my pre-1990 life.  I had this printer that, as far as I could tell, was totally useless because it printed on a roll of paper instead of sheets-like a toilet paper roll.  I spent lots of hours playing lame Oregon Trail game that came with it.  I even used the games my brother had for his commodore 64 that he got 6 years earlier.  I don't think much changed in the design of the computer during those 6 years.   long live the commodore!

      I was looking at a coffee table book written by  urlLink piers anthony .  Strangew enough, I know, but it just gets weirder from there.  THe book has these really high quality photographs of strange japanese foods that Mr. Anthony has tried or encountered, along with a little blurb about how he came into contact with it.  The only one I remember was taco soup (influenced by  urlLink lauren 's experience with urlLink  taco salad ).  The picture was this bowl of soup with a dark colored broth, and this giant white octopus, with its tentacles flailing out of the bowl (it was still alive, apparantly).  Piers wrote that he, much like in lauren's story, had ordered taco soup, because it sounded interesting, and was very surprised to be served a live octopus soup.  I know, strange enough, but it gets weirder. I was then suddenly in a japanese resturant staffed entirely by young americans (in Japan).  there was this big bin in the middle of the place that had all these different types of live birds in it, all categorized by type (pigeons all together in one section, parakeets in another, sparrows in another, and so on).  I asked a guy if the birds were bread to be unable to fly or if they had their wings clipped, and he told me they were clipped.  These birds were killed and cooked to order, one of the waitstaff would pick one up from time to time and snap its neck, and send it off to the kitchen.   Strange enough, but it gets wierder.  There were also these dogs running around the place, like pets with collars and names and stuff.  This one dog had long tufts of hair on his ears, and one of the waiters was cutting the hair and talking to the dog in a singsongy voice, "you won't be running away anymore, will you? Will you?  No you won't!"  (apparently the fur on the dog's ears worked like the flight feathers on the birds).  It came time to kill one of the dogs for a meal, and all the waitstaff gathered around this dog named Rico while a blonde girl spoon fed Rico some poison, and told Rico she was sorry.  Someone took Rico's collar off.  then, thankfully, I woke up.

      My Prof. brought in a picture of Janet Jackson's exposed breast to class so we could "talk about images of Black people in the media."  Is it just me or is it funny to hear a teacher read a head line that says "Janet Gives Super Boob Show"  in class.  It was like I was in 7th grade again, and someone just read a paragraph out loud about a titmouse.

      As a pc user, I've been thinking about making the switch the next time I buy a computer, and getting a mac.  The big reason I like them, is that they actually seem to put a lot of effort into desgining them, inside and out, with an eye to how people actually use them.  But  urlLink this  is troubling. They seem to have joined up with that big music industry company to...er....discourage people from stealing music.

      So I came across  urlLink neopia  in my travels, and I'm pretty addicted at this point.  It's a virtual world where you take care of a virtual pet, and wander around and play games to earn points you can use to buy virtual stuff.  It's a little scary too, though, there are all these ads and games aimed at kids, like "visit McDonald's land and earn 100 neopoints!" and you can earn points by watching commercials for kid's cereal.  But they have some cool games, everything from craps and poker to word games and such.

      only, it wasn't really spicy at all.  I made them myself, my first time ever.  Didn't really follow any recipie, tho i did have some suggestions, from laurenzmom, via lauren.  I think i needed to use more salt, and maybe more red pepper.  And maybe I should have tried the ketchup like lauren told me to, but in my head it sounded too sweet.  next time.  they were yummy anyway.  does anybody have favorite meatball tips?

      Ok, so I'm sure that, as usual, I'm behind the curve on this one, but I just saw the daily show, and louis black had a bit about the house of representatives bill  urlLink H.R.3687 , that talks about which words you can and can't say on tv.  an excerpt:         `(b) As used in this section, the term `profane', used with respect to language, includes the words `shit', `piss', `fuck', `cunt', `asshole', and the phrases `cock sucker', `mother fucker', and `ass hole', compound use (including hyphenated compounds) of such words and phrases with each other or with other words or phrases, and other grammatical forms of such words and phrases (including verb, adjective, gerund, participle, and infinitive forms).'.  is anyone else disturbed by this? was there any debate on the house floor about this? "I agree, Mr. Representative, that 'fuck' should be on the list, but is 'piss' really profane?" don't our lawmakers have better things to do?

I don't know what it is or where it's coming from, but it's gross.

And it has what appeares to be dope in it.  I squat down to see what it really is, and pick it up, and it sure looks like dope, or some other green leafy substance.  and then I think, whatever it is, I really don't want ot get involved, so I just put it back where I found it, and when I came home later on, it was gone.

      I know that everyone is going to think that I'm going crazy, or have no sense of direction or something.  But lately, things have been in the wrong place.  like, the other day, I went to the subway station just like I always do, went in the same entrance, walked down the same stairs and turned in the same direction to get on the northbound train.  the train is coming just as i get to the platform, and as I'm about to get on, i happen to look up at the sign, and it's the southbound train.  I look across and the northbound track is on the other side.I was in the right place, but the train had switched sides.   And it's still there now.   And tonight, I went to a subshop I go to sometimes.  and I got my sub (meatball) and walked out, and turned in the same direction I always do to go home.  But after a block I noticed that I was walking in the wrong direction.  The whole world had shifted around.

      For those who have been wondering, I have been away from a working computer for a week or so.  Spring Break '04 rocked!   when I was 18-22, spring break meant a road trip from maine to florida in a) a 1980 chevy impala with a rusted out hood, a leaky transmission, and an exhaust that would come loose from its moorings 40 miles outside of Richmond b) The Urban Assault Vehicle (a.k.a. The Hamborghini) c) Eesh's Ferrari 4-runner.  This road trip involved lots of peeing into cups and bottles (my favorite was always the empty Tide bottles we would pick up from the Hippie's house in VA; the residue from the laundry detergent had a nice way of neutralizing the smell), flirting with carloads of women by asking them if they "want a cookie?!", watching Bill Bush flex on Daytona beach, Watching Bill Bush flex in Savannah Georgia, watching Bill Bush flex in Key West FL, eating peel and eat shrimp with the waitress of a bar during the 8 am-noon happy hour that would kick off a legendary fat day with Eesh and Mac, and a lot of other stuff I am leaving out or have forgotten.   This year spring break meant actually doing the homework that had been assigned over the break, going to NYC with my girl, (where we upheld the spring break fat-day tradition of spending an entire day either eating, drinking, or being on our way to either eating or drinking) hanging out in brookline, doing some laundry, and sleeping a lot.   But the spring break topic gives me the opportunity to let you in on my brother's million dollar idea.  You know how they have those girls gone wild spring break videos?  well his idea is a guys only version called Guys Gone Nuts, where the camera runs around asking guys to "show us you're nuts!"

"Broadband technology must be affordable," Bush said in a speech in Minneapolis. "In order to make sure it gets spread to all corners of the country, it must be affordable. We must not tax broadband access. If you want broadband access throughout the society, Congress must ban taxes on access."

      this urlLink interview  with a guy from the center for cognitive liberty and ethics has scared the heck out of me.  It outlines some pretty sci-fi sounding but real technologies that can be used for mind control (some already are being used that way pparently).  One that is being installed right now on vending machines in tokyo uses hypersonic sound to beam a message directly into people's heads so it sounds like the noises are coming from inside.  and he talks about drugs that either improve or inhibit memory.  and about how the government might force people to use these drugs involintarily.

And I realize that sincerity is out of fashion these days, and that what I'm about to say will be totally insincere, but it is an attempt to convey in an insincere way a moment that was sincere.  This play made me an emotional wreck.  It made me sad and happy and it made me think about my life and my own father and about how good of a dad he is. Hi dad! I love you!  And it made me wonder why it's so hard for people to talk to one another.

      What was causing my computer to spontaneously lose power, usually while I was in the middle of some Very Important Document?  Was it a faulty power supply? Gremlins? No! it was due to the fact that in 4 and a half years of using this computer, I never dusted out the inside of it.  There was a lot of stuff in there, I'm surprised the thing worked at all.  Now if I can just figure out what is making it turn itself on in the middle of the night and make lots of sounds, I'll be ok.  The friendly usenet people seem to think it's a faulty power supply.  Lauren seems to think it's haunted.  A new power supply runs around 20 bucks, anyone know how much for an exorcism?

Everyone was really nice; heather's family rocks.  After dinner all the men went outside and smoked cigars.  From this limited experience, I think I rate passover right up there with thanksgiving as my favorite holidays.

      I don't understand how some people are oblivious to the fact that things they do can have a direct influence on the enjoyment of those around them.  Last night on the green line, this woman was sitting there with her phone, making it make these awful beeping noises.  continuously.  Until she got off at park street.  and not just beeping sounds, but I think she was trying out ringtones or something.  and the volume was really loud.  And it was super annoying.   And the day before I saw this kid sit down on the red line with a big bag of sunflower seeds.  and he was spitting the seeds all over the floor.  And I was thinking that I should say something to him.  But of course I didn't.  And I was thinking that in the days when men wore hats, somebody would have given this boy a stern talking to, and asked him if his mother had taught him any manners.   I think that a better use of the MBTA's resources would be to have an etiquette officer on the trains, instead of randomly stopping people to ask for identification.  That way, if the whole train can hear your ipod, if you refuse to give your seat to an elderly person, if you are an ass with your cellphone, or if you spit on the floor, the etiquette officer would tell you that you were a big jerk.

      As you may or may not know, I am in the market for a new laptop.  My desktop is a 4 and a half years old HP pavillon that is running windows 98, and it has been my trusty friend requiring almost no maintenance and doing everything I have asked it to do (after some initial problems trying to convince it that it isn't ok to spontaneously shut down).   But lately it has some problems shutting down (it freezes during shutdown) and when I do get it shut down, it makes these strange sounds and spins all its drives and stuff in the middle of the night, as if it is haunted (see  urlLink this  post). And I really want to get a Mac.  I like the idea that they have been designed as if someone is actually going to use them.  They are pretty.  they are supposed to be more stable than windows.  I also like the idea of not using microsoft products.  it makes me feel like a rebel of sorts.  like luke skywalker.  he would have used a mac.  but han solo probably would have used a pc that he stripped down and customized.   anyway. I have always been a windows luser ever since i switched from the commodore 64.  and the whole mac thing is a little scary for me.  and now blogger is offering some sort of way to post photos to your blog via IM along with unlimited photo hosting.  but only if you use windows.   so any mac users out there, please convince me.  tell me that the mac is way better, even though there are lots of cool things that are only offered for windows machines (like  urlLink movielink  which I have been using on my old HP with no problems), tell me that the battery life is better on a mac, tell me that I will be a better person if i use a mac, tell me I will smile every time I turn it on, tell me it will make me smarter and more attractive.

      That's a dumb question.  Lots of people wear ties on a daily basis.  But today, I was going to a job interview for a part tim nonprofit gig.  I know that nonprofits are less dressy than profits, so decided to go without the suit, and wear a shirt and tie instead (yes, Shukie, i was wearing pants too).  But oops! in my haste packing for my trip here from Philly, i forgot to pack ties.  I'll stop in at the gap and get a tie on my way.   -Do you sell ties. -No, I don't.  Try Urban Outfitters. so i figured, I'd just go without the tie.  When I got off the bus, I realized that my chronic paranoia about being late for anything had made me almost an hour early for this interview.  And that the bus let me off directly accross from the Big K Mart at the Brighton Mills mall.  Ah!  They must sell ties there. Belts. Suspenders. Wallets. Silk Boxers. no ties.   -Excuse me, do you have any men's ties in stock? -yes. -do you know where they are located? -in the men's section. -but do you know where in the section; i couldn't find them. -did you look in the corner, by the belts? -yes. -then we must not have any in stock. -thank you, you've been very unhelpful.

      I realize that to the casual observer, I might seem like a typical, bachelor male with no cooking skills or grocery store experience.  This would be one of those times when judging a book by its cover would lead one astray. So when the lady (i'm sure she was very nice and trying to be helpful) took my squinting through a blinding headache that almost had me in tears as i tried to read the can of tuna I was holding for being confused by all the tuna choices, and decided to help out a clueless boy by giving me unsolicited advice on the particular can I was looking at, saying, "that one has a really nice flavor" I just nodded at her and hoped she would go away and leave me to my pain.  She did, or so I thought.  not 3 seconds later she comes back to tell me that that kind of tuna is packed in olive oil, so I didn't need to get mayonnaise too, I wanted to tell her that I know what the f* tuna packed in oil is lady, and if you don't leave me alone, the hopscotching elephants in my head are going to gain the upper hand, and I will be writing on the floor trying desperately to keep my brains from oozing out of my ears, prompting some underpaid kid in a Hawaiian shirt to have to mop up something really gross in isle 3. instead I grunted and nodded.   there should be some sort of sign you can wear when talking to another human is just too much for you to muster, and everyone would know to leave you alone.  maybe it could say "Normally I would be happy to talk to you.  But right now I am having a personal emergency, I didn't get enough sleep last night, i am in terrible pain, I am cranky, I am hibernating and i only got up to forage for berries and you are standing awfully close to my newborn bear cub, or I really just don't feel like engaging in anything more than the absolute minimum interpersonal interaction I can get away with right now.  Thank you for your understanding, and please try again when this sign is not being displayed."   It would have come in handy when, minutes later, the underpaid kid in the Hawaiian shirt ringing up my purchases asked me for my zipcode.  All I could mutter was "i'm not from...no...i don't know" and he replied "Brookline?" to which I should have just nodded and grunted.  but instead I said "philadelphia....just....I...use brookline"

I think i would have a lot of fun traveling around and eating with her.  And her 30 minute meals are very cool too.  It's like i'm in her kitchen and she's talking to me, unlike some tv chefs who are all pretentious and snooty.  Plus she's adorable.  and she's got an enormous mouth that looks like it should be on someone much bigger.  I don't know why that's a selling point either, but it is.

I could have eggs every day for months before i got bored with them.

      for those of you that don't know, I rent a room in a house here in Philly.  my landlord/roomate is very nice and the house is great, and in an awesome location, and my room is cheap.  But for some reason, when he installed the smoke detector on the second floor (where my room is) he put it in the hallway directly outside of the bathroom door.  So whenever someone takes a shower, once you open the door, all the steam rolls out and sets off this smoke detector.  And sometimes it doesn't set it off, and there is usually a delay that is long enough for me to get into my room and get partially changed before it starts sqwuaking, and I have to run down the hall and press the reset button.  That just seems like bad placement.

The book is about a guy who travels around the US and Europe, sometimes as a black man, sometimes as a white man.  THe paper is about how, in every place he visits, we get a slightly different conception of race.  I recommend the book highly, and the paper not at all.

      Rob and Heather took me to  urlLink lolita  tonight.  really good mexican BYOB (or , in this case, byo tequila)   This has led me to think about Boston.  There aren't a whole lot of byo places there, are there?  The only place I know of is an improv comedy place, and I think that's in cambridge, if I remember correctly

      Because I know that people only read this to see how many pages I have written, I have approximately 8 pages of my paper done as of 6:30 pm on friday the 7th.  That means 7 more by 5:00 monday.  then I think I'm going to go get drunk.  Most likely by myself, since I don't have any drinking buddies in Philly.  If anyone's interested in going out Monday night, drop me a line.

I don't know about anyone else, but if I were going to torture prisoners, I don't think I'd be posing for incriminating photos.

      I've been in this city for around nine months now.  But I feel like I haven't experienced anything here.  I think I had a much better feel for Seattle, and I only lived there for a little longer than I have here.  And I feel like I know Savannah better than philly, And I've only spent a few days there.   I hang out in my little area coffee shop, The Last Drop.  I eat at my local pizza shop.  I ride the subway from Lombard-South to Cecil B. Moore.  and that's pretty much the extent of my Philly experience. But I am looking forward to being reacquainted with Boston this Summer.  I'll be there May 12.  Hope to see you there.

      So it's old news about having to show ID and let  urlLink imperial storm troopers search your bags  on the T.   But now, the supreme court, composed of 5 idiots and four reasonably sane people, has  urlLink upheld  a Nevada law that tramples the constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.  Although it seems that this might be applicable to being stopped for carrying a briefcase onto the train, the court still requires reasonable suspicion that a crime has been or is about to be committed in order to trample our constitutional rights.   So unless I'm about to commit a crime, the coppers better keep their hands off.  Everyone knows where I keep the bail money, right?  Amendment IV  The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.   As I was walkin'  -  I saw a sign there And that sign said - no tress passin' But on the other side  .... it didn't say nothin! Now that side was made for you and me!  This land is your land, this land is my land From California, to the New York Island From the redwood forest, to the gulf stream waters This land was made for you and me  In the squares of the city - In the shadow of the steeple Near the relief office - I see my people And some are grumblin' and some are wonderin' If this land's still made for you and me.

      So I went to get an iced coffee yesterday.  and when I walked in, the clerk was over on the other side of the store doing something, and there was this lady at the counter in front of me.  she turned around and looked at me exasperatedly, then turned back and says "hello! you have people here!" in this really awful snooty way.  I gave her a dirty look and when she turned around to look for sympathy from me she said "well, it's just that everybody is so passive nowadays.  don't you think?" No, i don't think so.  I think people are too rude and inconsiderate.  there is a difference between not being poassive, and being a great big jerk.  that's what I would have said if I weren't so passive.  Instead I shrugged and didn't speak to her.

         the mac store is not populated by employees who love the mac and are eager to tell you all about it and offer demonstrations and give you good reasons to switch from your pc to the mac.  It is instead populated by regular old retail salespeople who really are just waiting for their next break, like all retail salespeople do.  I had to play around with a laptop for ten minutes before a kid with ill advised facial hair asked me unenthusiastically if I had any questions.  and then he couldn't answer my questions   The guy at the genius bar was a little different, he could answer my questions and was very nice and knowledgeable.  (Although he didn't give me a straight answer when i asked him about typical versus max battery life on the ibook.)  I was somehow expecting someone to try to sell me on something while I was there.  Should I be praising them for no pressure sales tactics?  probably, but i went there to be convinced that i should switch from my pc world to theirs. and they didn't do it.   macs are not designed by people who have big clumsy hunks of meat where most people have hands.  if they were, they would have put in the ability to temporarily disable the trackpad while thick fingered lusers are typing. I tried typing "the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog" but towards the end of the sentence i accidentally moved the cursor via the trackpad to the middle of the sentence.  the genius's solution was to plug in a mouse, and learn to type better.  If any computer makers are listening, please please please make more computers with that little joystick eraser head shaped thing in the middle of the keyboard.  It makes my life a lot easier.   the powerbook doesn't just have better insides than the ibook, but it seems to be constructed better outside as well.  the screen on the ibook seemed flimsy when i tried to close it, but the powerbook seemed just fine, nice and sturdy.  And I swear that the trackpad responded more quickly on the powerbook than it did on the ibook.  (man, i really don't like the trackpad.) and the trackpad button didn't seem to work as well on the ibook as on the powerbook.  And it didn't look as cute as I expected it to look.   But I don't know that the powerbook is worth 800 more dollars.     I really want to become a mac user.  I like the company, I'm impressed by their desire to innovate, and what really amazed me was how much easier it is to do something like add memory to a desktop version than it was on my pc.  They seem to have realized that somebody might want to open up the computer and get inside it at some point.  They have a door.  with my HP I had to unscrew stuff, take out the power supply, partially remove some side panel.  it was a mess. But I was really less than impressed by my mac store experience.  and what's up with that dock at the bottom?  it is very annoying, the way it moves around all the time.  but it looks so pretty.   I guess that after all, it is just a computer.  it isn't the revolutionary, world changing, tool of individualism, that fights the evil empire, and makes me smarter, sexier, and hipper that the marketing team had led me to believe it is.

      as krueger  urlLink says  making good pad thai is hard.  I followed the recipe almost exactly (water instead of chicken stock) but it came out tasting like spaghetti.  it was very bland.  now I think that part of the problem might be the water for broth substitution, but I added some salt to try to compensate.  but the point being that I'm not a novice cook.  I'm actually pretty good at making most things.  But this failed spectacularly.  It's not that it was bad, just very boring, and very un-pad thai-like.  anyone know how to make a man pad thai  come teach me. alternately, anyone want to come over for lunch? I'm having leftover pad thai.

      I’ve been meaning to write about Tyler’s bachelor party for a couple of days now.  It was a blast.  8 (?) college buddies went to a cabin in the new hampster woods.   The first night there we drank too much, talked about how cool we were in college, embellished stories, talked about love, debated whether or not we have been lied to by years of watching hollywood’s ideas about romance, whether love is roses and fireworks or something closer to what we have between us.  We hugged too much,  cooked and ate over ten pounds of meat, played wiffle ball as the sun came up, went to sleep about 7 am.    The next day,  sean made blueberry pancakes, we went for a hike, we talked about war, mideast peace, politics, blueberries, star wars.  Sean and ryan went for a swim in what must have been very cold water.  We ate some more meat.   We played poker for chips, (not the edible kind) we played drinking games, we painted pictures and carved soap.   The next day we cleaned up, and drove home.   Best bachelor party ever, I think.

      I have dog fever.  Every time I see one (or at least a good looking one), I get all goofy, and I want to roll around on the ground with him and let him lick my face.  today, at the  urlLink bookstore  this giant golden retriever came into the store and, surprise, immediately found the bowl of doggie treats we keep on the counter.  he jumped up and put his big paws on the counter and sniffed at them till his (aweful) person gave him one.  then later he jumped up and put his paws on the counter and i let him lick my hands.  He looked like a really happy dog, and when he wagged his tail, it went thump thump thump against anything within reach.   his name was rusty.

      We made fish tonight.  Some nice salmon steaks with mango-mint sauce.  mmmmm yum.  The recipie said to put the fish under the broiler for 7 minutes a side.  Was the rack too close to the heating element?  was there a typo in the recipie? Whatever the reason, after 7 minutes I went to turn the fish over, and they were a little crisp on that side.  That wasn't that big a deal, but then the smoke alarm started going off.  And the celings are too high to reach to shut it off.  So we were waving pants at the alsrm to get the smoke away.  I went to finish the salmon while lauren stood on a chair and fanned the alarm.  But as we all know, heat and smoke rises, so lauren inhaled a lot of smoke, got it all in her eyes, the entire apartment filled with smoke, and the fish tasted gross.

      Just got back from seeing Fahrenheit 9/11. it's an incredibly depressing movie.  I don't think that the film told me anything I hadn't really heard before, but it did put it all in front of me again, and made all the anger and outrage fresh again.   I want to boycott something. I want to protest something. I want another system. I want voting reform. I want intelligent and compassionate people in office. I want my rights to be observed. I want an alternative.   somebody organize me.

      I love my mac  it is pretty, and sophisticated.  It likes to have lots of programs open at the same time.  It's battery seems to last around 4 hours or so, even with the wireless card running.   Once I re-learn all the keyboard shortcuts, I am sure I will never even think about windows again.   although a small part of me wonders if I like the mac so much because my previous os was windows 98, so maybe xp is as big of an improvement over win98 as osX is?

      So, as you may have read on lauren's blog, I had an  urlLink encounter  last night with a bag of dill pickle chips. this made me very nostalgic for college and humpty dumpty potato chips.  check out these  urlLink commercials , which i tbeleive play in canada.   for those of you who are unfamiliar with the brand, they make ..... unusual flavors of chips.  my favorites were the ketchup ones, and the dilly chips.  sour cream and clam seems to be mising from their  urlLink list of flavors , and even though this flavor was pretty much edible only after a night of drinking, I miss them.

      At the risk of sounding like a wanker, (and invoking the ire of jim for liking a mainstream poet) i'd like to respond to a comment from max: "DIckenson! She's SOOOOOO lame!  How come all you teacher types think she's got to be read? It's just going to encourage her..."  but before i begin, i'd like to say that this is not, i repeat, not a poetry blog   MY life closed twice before its close;   It yet remains to see If Immortality unveil   A third event to me,  So huge, so hopeless to conceive,   As these that twice befell. Parting is all we know of heaven,   And all we need of hell.  this is one of my favorite e.d. poems.  what i love about it is the quiet rhythm that almost lulls me, every time i read it, into thinking that it is a very simple poem with a simple sentiment.  Right up through the 4th line, i think that the poem is nothing special, it sounds like a talented teenager talking about being rejected by the popular kids at school.  But that fifth line really does it for me.  I love the way those words feel in my mouth, almost like chewing.  and i like the idea that love and loss are so hopelessly intertwined that the poem can't offer the one without the other.    Is she the best poet ever? the endpoint of poetry?  of course not, but i think she's an important voice in the history of american poetry, and, perhaps more importantly, I like her a lot, and since i get to pick what i teach this semester, she makes the cut.  Phhhbbbttt!

But they were beset by anal jaguars and perished.
