          I finally have my car back. Here’s the story:       So on Wednesday the  urlLink Honda Service Center  did a test to see if anything else was wrong with the engine beside the timing belt being broken for $150, since when a timing belt breaks it can hurt other parts of the engine, that way I’d only be out $150 instead of $575 if it needed more repairs that I didn’t want to pay for. Everything came up fine and they did the repairs I have previously mentioned. Then yesterday they call me to say that one of the cylinders has a hole in it and it’s going to cost even more. As you can imagine, dear reader, I was pissed. They tried to assure me that they’d try to keep the total cost to around $1,500 which I promptly informed them I wasn’t about to pay that much to fix a car that wasn’t even worth $1,500 and even more so I wasn’t going to pay $575 for the work already done (they didn’t do the tune-up or gasket replacement after they found the hole) since I was supposed to know about the hole when they did the test for $150 – the whole point of testing it. Long story short, after arguing with the slick and slimy service manager I agreed to pay for the parts that they installed in my car, but none of the labor which brings my grand total to $300 - $150 for the test and $150 for the parts.       So now I have a car running on three cylinders instead of four – which means it could die once and for all in a couple months or (hopefully) last until I graduate    in the Spring when at that time was planning on getting a newer car anyway. At least I have my car out of that crooked  urlLink service place . Don’t take your car there.

       Gotta love the O'Jay's  urlLink  For the Love of Money  . I've had that song stuck in my head all morning. Why, you may ask?    Well, now my car needs a tune-up (makes sense, seeing as how I've never gotten one of those) and the oil pan gasket needs replacing since that was where my major oil leak was from. All this, including the work already done, is going to set me back a total of, are you ready,  $1,020 .    Wow, it must have been karma, because if this would have happened any other time I wouldn't be able to afford this. Guess I can kiss all new furniture good-bye until next month.

       Well, my car's timing belt broke Monday night, not the fuel pump or carburetor like I initially thought (or was hoping). This is setting me back $500, maybe a little more. Guess I can say good-bye to the dining table and chairs this month - I'll get them next month ;) Perhaps I can still afford the  urlLink coffee table  I want though.

          Well, it's Tuesday afternoon and I'm already tired...    Last night Evan, John and I went to karaoke, it was pretty fun. Patrick was at cribbage night. We all sang Wonderboy by  urlLink The D , then Evan and I sang a duet - Under Pressure by Bowie and Queen, which was hilarious because I hadn’t listened to that song in a while, still pretty fun though. Then I sang Tina Turner’s version of Proud Mary with Evan backing me up – I even did the dance that goes with the song.   Brandon   showed up at the beginning of Proud Mary and was glad he didn’t miss it. It was something to be seen. Of course I was feeling pretty good then so I’m sure the alcohol helped. Besides that we just played pool and drank. Towards the end of the night Evan suggested oat sodas, so we drank those, feeling deliciously white trash.     We left around Midnight, giving John and Brandon a ride home, or so we thought… my car broke down on   Franklin   and I was able to coast it into the parking lot of a Best Western. I couldn’t get it started so I left it there over night (after talking with the front desk guy, who was a jerk) and finally had it towed around Noon today and brought to the Honda Dealer to get fixed. I think it’s either the carburetor or the fuel pump, since it was acting like I was out of gas when, in fact, I had gas. Either way it will be less than $200 to fix it, so that’ good news considering it could have been a lot more.

              So I saw  urlLink The Bourne Supremacy  a few weeks ago and must admit it was great. This movie has the best car chase seen in a movie that I have seen, ever.

       I apologize, dear reader, for not updating this since the beginning of the month. I have been busy, but that is no excuse for leaving you in the bitter dark of the void known as cyber-space.  What have I been doing? Well, a week ago last Tuesday I went camping with my friend Kyri and her brother Philip, we went, of course, to Casa Bonita and had a good time. This past weekend  urlLink Scott  came down and we went to the  urlLink Scandinavian Festival ! The best part of the festival is the food so I had a bunch of Swedish meat pies this weekend - four in total, I think. I've always wondered if Swedish meat pies are really Swedish and if they are, if they're some sort of American bastardization that I have come to love over the years. There's also the Danish shaved ice booth - which, of course, is 100% authentic ;) My sister remarked that she thought the Scandi Fest was smaller this year and asked me to pay attention to that when I went. It's not that I think it's smaller, I just think that, as with most things, when you get older things around you have a way of getting smaller. Things you once viewed as huge or important are somehow smaller now. The one exception to this is, of course, Disneyland ;)

          A note about the sidebar off to the right – This is where I’m putting the what I’ve seen or listened to lately feature. However I started off with  urlLink Kruder & Dorfmeister  not because they’re new to me, but because I love this album to no end and think everyone should give it a listen.       As for  urlLink The Sopranos , I just finished the first season and this is possibly one of the best series ever on television. I’m already to episode 6 in the  urlLink second season  ;)

          Hmm… Well, what’s been happing with me lately? Last weekend I went camping – it was a lot of fun. Went up  urlLink Brice Creek  and found a nice place to camp, but more importantly we were next to the most perfect swimming hole I have ever seen, which we affectionately dubbed “Casa Bonita.” I can't wait to go back.          Got the  urlLink TiVo  yesterday and set it up. Wow, is this thing amazing. Now I'll never miss another  urlLink Queer Eye for the Straight Guy  ;) And I've already set it up to record all  urlLink Star Trek: TNG  episodes that air on TV. Speaking of Star Trek - I hope you all are aware of  urlLink Trekkies 2  being released this month.           …the most informative moments from this astounding world tour…another fascinating look at the world through the eyes of the people we have come to know as 'Trekkies.'
