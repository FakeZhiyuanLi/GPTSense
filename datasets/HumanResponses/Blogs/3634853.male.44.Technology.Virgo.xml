      Day 11 Recap    $1/$2 Limit HE        UltimateBet    -$11.00  PokerStars     -$15.00   $1/$2 Limit STUD    UltimateBet    -$27.00   $50 NL HE    UltimateBet    +$4.00    Total   -$49.00  -$59.10 for days projection -$14.84 for years projection  Summary  Well, I said yesterday that I'd probably regret bitching about being ahead and now the poker gods have reached up and slapped me square in the face!  I truly can't get any cards right now.  While playing Stud, trying ot mix it up a little bit, I never stayed in a hand that I shouldn't have and only lost one on the river.  I just never got good starting cards.  As far as the limit Hold 'Em tables it's more of the same.  I vowed to myself when I began this that I wouldn't use it as a forum to complain about bad beats or bad players.  My soul intent was to evaluate myself and my feelings, and to keep a record of how my earnings (or lack thereof) were going.  In reviewing what I've writtne lately it seems like all I do is cry about the cards I'm getting.  I think it may be time to re-evaluate my starting hands, do some work in PokerTracker and see if I could be playing hands a little differently and find a way to make this venture more profitable.  I don't feel like I've dug a hole that I can't get out of, but I think if I continue with the attitude I have now I can do no better than to play scared and lose any effectiveness I may have gained through study and analysis.  Now to stick to my guns......

      Day 10 Recap   Sit N Goes    PokerStars  (1) $10 SnG     13/18        -$11.00   $1/$2 Limit HE        PlanetPoker    -$8.25  UltimateBet    +$47.00  PokerStars     +$3.75   Total   +$31.50  +$21.40 for days projection +$44.62 for years projection  Summary  It still seems as though I can't get any cards. Although I had a decent sessio at UB all in all I got very few cards.  Had I not caught quad 10's on the limit table on UB I would have been struggling there as well.  As it turned out, I flopped the quads and had 2 guys fighting over the pot so I just followed until the river where I made sure to cap and they both were playing an off pair from the flopped 10's.  Lucky me!  I made almost my entire result on that hand.  I think I'm playing a little too tight in these limit games but will continue to try and make some adjustments and hopefully can begin seeing better results soon.  I guess I shouldn't complain as I am at least ahead of projections, but I feel a little underwhelmed none the less.  One day soon I'll wish I wasn't complaining.  Oh well, Until next time......  Enough for now.  Until next time.....

      Day 9 Recap   Sit N Goes     PartyPoker  (1) $10 SnG    4th/10        -$11.00    MTT   UltimateBet   (1)  $5 MTT NLHE    184/2402     -$5.50   $1/$2 Limit HE        PlanetPoker    +$34.88   $25 Pot Limit Hold Em   PartyPoker     -$3.30  Total   +$15.08  +$4.98 for days projection +$23.22 for years projection  Summary  I seem to be catching better cards at PlanetPoker right now and should probably be spending all my time there until things change, but I'm not real hot on that interface and haven't figured out their tourney schedules yet.  All in all at least it was a positive day although I'm giving away a lot on UB.  I played a large MTT tourney there last night and probably should have hung in until the money since they were paying 150 and I broke out at 184, but I was really playing for the win and I needed to make a stand before the blinds started eating me up and caught a bad break.  I played very well in the tourney though.  Maybe as aggressive as ever and just making sure all my good starting hands either paid well or didn't get sucked out by making sure people paid to draw against them.  I may try to play a little more limit tomorrow on all the sites and see if it isn't a bit more profitable than the SnG's.  Overall, I like the SnG's because I limit my losses, but if I'm not catching the cards, as has been proven of late, I can still end up posting losses for the day and I just can't accept that.  The other thing is that I think I may have to vary my game selection a bit more as sometimes I catch myself feeling like I'm just going through the motions and that just doesn't have a very positive expectation.  Enough for now.  Until next time.....

      Day 8 Recap   Sit N Goes    PokerStars  (1) $6 SnG    10th/18        -$6.50  PartyPoker  (1) $10 SnG    3rd/10        +$9.00    MTT   (1)  $5 MTT NLHE    39/733     -$5.50   $1/$2 Limit HE        PlanetPoker    +$57.04  Total   +$54.04  +$43.94 for days projection +$18.24 for years projection  Summary  I decided to give PlanetPoker a shot tonight to see if maybe a change of scenery would do me some good and apparently it did.  I caught some nice hands early and made them pay.  Then I stuck around until I felt like the cards were turning and got out booking a nice positive session.  My play hadn't really changed but I seemed to get some better starting hands and it worked out.  I will continue moving around and see if I can't maximize the good sites when I catch them while trying to keep my losing sessions a little more under control.  On to the weekend, let's see what happens.

      Day 7 Recap   Sit N Goes    PokerStars  (1) $10 SnG    10th/18        -$11.00    MTT   (1)  $3 MTT NLHE  PS     98/1448     +$3.48  Total   -$7.52  -$17.62 for days projection -$43.32 for years projection  Summary  Not much to say.  I have changed up a bit but am being careful at the same time and thinking about some other things I can do to shake things up.  I haven't played Stud in a while, maybe that would be the ticket.

      Day 6 Recap   Sit N Goes    PokerStars  (1) $10 SnG    15th/18        -$11.00   PartyPoker  (1) $10 SnG    4th/10        -$11.00   UltimateBet  (1) $5 SnG    4th/10        -$5.50     MTT   (1)  $5 MTT NLHE    388/738     -$5.50  Total   -$33.00  -$43.10 for days projection -25.70 for years projection  Summary  Things aren't getting any better as you can see.  I just don't think I'm getting any starting cards and now when I do I'm either already so far behind that no one is bothered by my play or they come over the top with little or no fear.  I think I may be a bit to patient and may try opening up a bit to see what happens.  I just hate changing things when I don't have a lot of bankroll room to absorb things if it doesn't work out.    Guess I'll just give it some thought and see how things go.  Until next time.....

      Day 5 Recap   Sit N Goes     PokerStars  (1) $5 SnG    6th/18        -$5.50 (1) $6 SnG    4th/18        +$4.80  Total   -$.70  -$9.40 for days projection +$17.40 for years projection  Summary  Seems that the cards have dried up.  I wasn't able to get anything to start with in either tournament and only lasted as long as I did in the $6 one because I was ruthless in trying to steal blinds.  Oh well, mom said there would be days like this :)

      I haven't updated my results in 2 days, but will most definitely do that tonight when I get home from work.  Although I know better, my thought processes really suck right now as I haven't been getting much for starting cards and when I do have a hand they aren't holding up.    At one point I showed my wife where for 7 hands in a row I had 2xos with nothing higher than an 8.  Right after that I asked her " now at some point don't you think I should be getting AX suited 5 or 6 times in a row?"  She laughed out loud.  It kind of made me think how frustrated I was sounding, and probably silly too, but at the same time, I haven't seen yet where you get a good streak that lasts anywhere near as long as the bad ones.  I'm hoping that soon I catch one of those "hot" streaks that you're able to sustain, but it hasn't happened yet.  Anyway, I plan on going home this afternoon and doing some analysis in PokerTracker.  I want to make sure there aren't any loops I'm opening up as a result of how things have gone.  Also, I want to make sure that my study and reflection habits remain in place regardless of  my short term results.  I still think that the goal I set is attainable and look forward to the progression of my game.  I also still believe that with diligence, commitment, patience, and discipline I can bring my game to at least another level.  That next level should get me beyond the casual or undedicated player and help me to supplement my income as I am hoping.  Enough crying for now

      Unfortunately, I wasn't able to pull myself to the computer last night to do my normal recap post.  Maybe that's a good thing, but I felt like I was letting at least myself down as a result.  Anyway, I played 2 Sit N Goes on PokerStars.  One was a normal $5 SnG and the other was what they call a Turbo SnG with the blinds escalating at a much faster pace, every 5 minutes.  That one cost me $6.  I bombed out of the first and ended up 4th in the turbo for a total loss of roughly $3 for the day.  I will post accurate numbers this evening which will reflect where I am towards my goals.  In addition to those I played a freeroll on PS for an entry into a tourney on Sunday with a guaranteed $300K prize pool.  This cost me 500 frequent player points and there were 206 entries which meant that they would be giving 4 entries into the big tourney.  I ended up in 15th place, but was really never a factor after the first hour as I was simply playing catch up the rest of the time.  When it was all over I had looked at 18 flops in 187 hands and had won 15 of them.  The cards simply weren't there.  Then at the end I had KK cracked by a flush.  Oh well, it was interesting and a nice change of pace.  I really just wasn't very interested in working my game yesterday.  I probably would have been better off reading a little bit and giving myself a break, but sometimes find myself feeling obligated to at least giving it a shot.  In the long run this attitude would get me in a lot of trouble, I'm sure, but I generally only sit down if I'm focused on building my bankroll and playing good cards.  It was another good lesson and fortunately not an expensive one as most are.  I will just need to keep this in mind the next time I sit down to play when I don't really feel like it and pull myself away and find other ways to occupy my time that can help me on my quest.  That's enough rambling for now.  Until next time.....

      Day 4 Recap   Sit N Goes    PokerStars  (2) $10 SnG's  1st place  +$61.00                                                      7th place  -$11.00   MTT's    UltimateBet  (1) $5 NLHE   53/656 for  +$2.70  Total +$52.70  Total for the week (4 days since I started mid week)  +$67.20 --> projected for $40.40   +$42.60  for days projection  +26.80  for years projection  Summary  I had a good start to the day by winning a $10 SnG on PokerStars.  It's been a long time since I had the feeling, but from the very start, although I didn't see my first hand for a while I felt like I was dominating the tables I was on.  I don't think after I made my first move with KK to a rag flop that I was ever truly threatened.  I came at any pot I wanted to play strongly and normally didn't get much action but it allowed me to steal some blinds and get to a position where I stayed just as aggressive as I thought I needed to stay in control.  The only real trouble I had was with the guy I ended up Heads up with as he was very careful and wouldn't put his chips at risk and he was only behind me by about T2500 chips.  I decided the only way I was going to get him was to try and trap, and eventually got my chance, slow played a flopped straight, and knocked him out.  After that win I found another tourney and registered but really never caught any cards.  I ended up in the middle of the pack, but did so only by being very patient, but finally got to a point where I had to make a stand and pushed all in with QQ and got caught by AA.  I took quite a break through the middle of the afternoon. Partly because of Father's Day but as I started thinking about it, also because I wanted to protect my win for the day.  That's probably not the best thinking all the time, but at this early stage of the building of my bankroll, I was able to justify it.  Anyway, after dinner I decided to try a Multi tourney at UltimnateBet.  The entry was only $5 so I wasn't risking a lot, but had potential to make a big hit if I got some cards.  On top of that, UB hasn't been very good to me lately and I'm just not running very confident there, so I thought this might be a good time to try to shake the cobwebs.  I ended up placing 53rd out of 656.  It only netted me $2.70 so my BB/hour rate won't be skyrocketing, but it was nice to at least finish in the money.  I truly have no idea how I lasted as long as I did.  At one point I had been moved to a table and only saw one flop in 48 hands!  That was the last before they moved me and it turned out to be a blind steal, but it certainly tested my patience.  Anyway, I remained patient and eventually got a couple of hands, was able to make them stand up and doubled up at least enough to get into the money.  I ended up getting busted out with AKs and a Kxx flop, when pocket QQ's caught a straight with runner runner.  Such is life :)  Anyway, I've gotten myself back over the hump and am feeling somewhat confident, although I want to guard against being cocky.  I may have also shook the UB feelings of late so this day could have had more positives than at first glance.  I guess we'll see.  Until tomorrow......

      I'm posting this one a little early as I'm hosting a small home tourney this afternoon so I believe this will be all I can play online today.  Day 3 Recap   Sit N Goes    PokerStars    (1) $5 SnG no cash   -$5.50  18th place :(   PartyPoker    (1) $10 SnG  1st place  +$39.00    Limit Games    PokerStars    $1/$2 Game   -$22.75   UltimateBet    .25/.50 Game  +$1.25  Total  +$12.00   +$1.90  for days projection  -$25.90  for years projection  Summary  I had a rough start to the day when I played the SnG at PokerStars and ran into KK when I had QQ.  I raised coming into the pot about 5xBB and was just called by 2 people.  I didn't have any notes on anyone and no real reads so I probably jumped the gun, especially that early in the tourney, but when the flop brought rags but 2 of a suit I thought I wanted to make someone pay to draw to the flush.  Oh well, another lesson learned I hope.  After that I played about an hour of limit at UB and was up and down the entire time and when I had a small positive balance after that hour I decided to take a break.  I came back a bit later and played limit on Stars and never caught a break.  With AQ suited I had a flop of AAK, raised the pot and another guy capped.  Turned out he was on KK and never raised pre-flop and caught me off guard.  That was most of my losses there.  When I couldn't get anywhere after about another 1 1/2 hours I moved on again.  This is where I played the SnG at Party and early on I wasn't catching any starting cards at all.  I managed to steal a couple of blinds and just tried to stay patient.  Soon my cards changed.  I was getting great starting hands and any time I had a chance to put someone all in I did it and all but one of those hands held up.  I ended up knocking out 4 of the last 6 players and had such a large chip lead on the last 2 players that it was just a matter of me playing smart heads up and I won.  Overall, I didn't make a lot of money but was at least able to post another positive outcome and knocked my years deficit down a little bit. I think if I continue being patient, studying when I have time, and catch my share of cards that I should be able to have a realistic chance of maintaining my goals for year end.  Now if I can just do something good tonight in our home game.  If it's not too late and I'm not wiped out, I'll try to post a report later.  Until tomorrow.....

      Day 2 Recap   Sit N Goes    PokerStars    (1) $10 SnG        3rd place   +$25   PartyPoker   (1) $5 SnG           1st place   +$19   Limit games    UltimateBet     -$13  Total   +$31.00   +$20.90  for days projection  -$27.80   for years projection  Summary  I had a better day of cards today.  Overall it still seemed as though I wasn't getting many cards.  When I looked it over in PokerTracker I had only played 11% of the flops and that kind of proved what I was thinking.  Anyway, I was able to make what I did get pay off and thought I maximized hands fairly well.  One thing much different today was that when I needed to push all in and I had a good hand, generally they stood up.  Much different than yesterday.   Anyway, I was able to post a positive day.  It wasn't huge by any means, but if I can continue chipping away then soon I'll be back on track.  Until tomorrow :)

      Day 1 Recap   PokerStars    1 $5 SnG's  no cashes  -$5.50                               1 $10 SnG   no cash     -$11   UltimateBet   1 $5 SnG   no Cash       -$6   PartyPoker    1 $5 SnG   no cash       -$6   Total    -$28.50   -$38.60  for days projection  -$38.60  for years projection  I was stung by the bad cards all night.  I never had a run of good cards and as we neared the end, I never was fortunate enough to catch when it was time to try to defend to stay in the tourney.  On UB & Party both tourneys I finished 4th, one spot from the $$, On PS I made it to the final table each time, since the SnG's I play there are 2 table, but ended 6th & 7th, with cash at the 4th spot.  Although my first day was less than spectacular, I basically played what I thought was good cards, remained patient as long as I could and didn't overplay hands and get caught.  I was able to make a few blind steals in position and never played a weak or suspect hand out of position.  I'm sure I'll catch this up when the cards turn but it gets frustrating sometimes waiting for that ot happen.  It should also be noted that I didn't play these tournies back to back.  I played 2 after coming home from work, ate dinner, helped my sister-in-law try to buy a car, and then played 2 more.  Tomorrow is another day!

      I've decided that to be successful at this I must first set a goal.   If I'm totally honest with myself, and log each and every days results, I should be able to see how I'm doing toward my goal, but should also be able to see where I'm most succesful and where my play needs work.  Some of this may be difficult to track at first, as my interests are so varied and my ultimate goal is to be at least proficient in many different games, but I will do my best to keep this journal understandable, easy to read, and most importantly, functional to me in my assessment of my play and progress.  Since I am starting with such a limited bankroll, I will primarily be playing Sit N Goes (SnG's), some $1/$2 Limit tables, and an occasional $25 NL table.  These are all Hold 'Em.  Additionally, on rare occasions, which I use to primarily change the pace, I will play $1/$2 Stud games.  Each of these will be reported seperately with a days recap at the end.  Most of the SnG's will be either $5  or $10, and occasionally I will venture into a MTT, but only as a change of pace and to give myself some experince in that arena.  Now, to the nuts & bolts!  If I begin this quest today there are 198 days left in 2004.  Since I don't want to put too much pressure on my initial phase, I am going to shoot for a $2000 BR at year end.  This would mean that my daily average would need to be $10.10.  If I 'm not able to play for a couple of days that doesn't matter as this is a daily thing and I have figured in a low expectation so that I can absorb difficulties in getting to the table as well as the totally expected down times.  The quest begins!

      I played in a $75 + $15 NLHE tourney last night at Holywood Park.  This is a continuation of their Endless Summer series but with a different format.  It used to be a lower buy in with re-buys and now they've increased the entry and eliminated the re-buys.  Last nights turn out was a little lower than I've seen in the past but we still had 156 people.  I caught a couple of unexpected hands early.  In the BB with no raies in front of me I had 36s. The flop came 663!  I slowed played the flop and the other guy in came at me with T100.  since we start this with T800, I thought if I could keep him thinking he had the lead I may be able to pick up almost 25% more chips here.  He came at me again on the Turn when a K hit the board and I smooth called one more time.  A rag hit the river, there was no flush or straight draws and once again he came at me with T100.  This time I raised to T300 hoping he would think I was trying to bluff, but he folded there and I took the pot.  I managed to steal a couple of blinds and basically played tight through the first hour. Then remembering what I had read about trying to make something happen just before levels increased or going on a break, with about 5 minute left before the 1st break, I caught AKs from a late position.  I came in with a raise of 3XBB and was called by one guy. The flop brought KQ8 rainbow.  The other player checked, I came in for about T250 and he smooth called me.  The turn brought a rag so I thought if he checked again I was going to put him to a decision since he only had about T400 left, and I was at about T2100.  sure enough, he checked and I pushed all in!  He was on QQ and I got no help on the river.  This put me in a postion where I had about T600 left and just a couple minutes before the break.    On the very next hand I get QQ in the hole, the flop comes 789 rainbow and once again I'm in a raised pot with the same guy I had just lost the last hand to.  I figured he thought I was probably tilting a bit ( I don't really think so though) and also that since he had just popped me, I was sure he was probably playing this hand a bit looser.  I pushed all in again, expecting him to fold to the straight possibility and he calls!  He has TT and sure enough the river gives him a 6 and I'm out.  I didn't check the board but I think I was right about 100th.  Not a very good showing, but overall I think I played my hands as well as I could and caught a tough break.

      I have just opened this Blog and am not sure at this point how things are going to work, but thought it would be fun and maybe interesting to give it a shot.  I am hoping to share the site with friends and family and hope to hear from others when something I've posted is of interest or particularly funny to them.  Anyway, I hope you enjoy and be easy on me.

      Last 5 days have been an up and down affair as usual. It just doesn't seem that I can sustain an upward swing, but am working the numbers and doing some reading and studying and hopefully can keep my head above water until I get this figured out.  Monday 6/28        -$3.00 @ Planet PLHE table  Tuesday 6/29 PokerStars       -$11.00 SnG +$10.25 $1/$2 Limit HE -$.75 total  -$15 PLHE  PartyPoker       Day total  -$15.75   Wed. 6/30 Stars  - $11.00 SnG -$3  Multi  Planet  +$23.75  $1/$2 Limit      Day total  +$9.75   Thursday  7/1      Party -$3.75 PLHE  UB   -$11 SnG  Day total  -$14.75   Friday 7/2         Planet   $1/$2 Limit HE   +$15.25 UB       $10 SnG          +$28.00 Stars    $1/$2 Limit HE   +$13.25 Party     PLHE            -$3.85               Day total  +$52.65    Total +$28.90   -$21.60 for the 5 days projections -$36.44 for the years projections  Summary  I am becoming more and more patient but also looking for opportunities to open things up a bit in the Limit games.  I think it's working, but will hold off until I have a few more sessions results to evaluate.  Playing the PLHE tables is nice for the variey as it is a much different game than Limit and I seem to be doing ok there.    I will trying to play a few more SnG's at UB this month as they have what looks to be a very cool promotion where they are giving back 1/2 your SnG buyins in Bonus points.  It takes forever ot release them, but free is free!  This format is still being worked out and I hope it becomes cleaner, and more interesting as we go along.  I will probably being playing off and on over the long 4th of July weekend and hope to once again get on the plus side of my projections and start seeing some real progress.  Until next time......

      I've decided that instead of daily updates on what I'm doing playing poker that I will probably just do weekly updates and then maybe a month end recap.  I keep pretty concise logs in other ways of everything I'm doing and it gets a bit redundant to re-hash it every day.  Besides, for anyone looking at this thing, it would get pretty dry if I continueed, I think.  So, it looks like I'm going to go see Fahrenheit 9/11 this wekend with Dave.  I'm not really into Michael Moore, because I think that although he brings up some great points, he also distorts the facts terribly and the genreal public doesn't always see through the BS.  Then I have to come to work and listen to these people talk about what a great movie it is, because it shows how mislead we've all been and what a terrible job Bush and his cronies have done.  It took this movie to point this out?  Where the hell have you been?  I can't remember the last time I didn't vote Republican across the board, but I can truly say that won't be happening this November!  If I can see it , then those that are looking for issues shouldn't need Michael Moore to point it out for them.  I got a kick out of the news today about Saddam Hussein being brought into court.  Almost everything I read said something about it being a ploy by Bush to boost his ratings.  What about the people this man has kept in fear all of these years?  Any chance that may have something to do with it?  I did see one person come forth and say that they were looking forward to their chance to testify against him, ONE!  I'm really getting tired of living my life in fear.  Every day another person is shot down or run over or beaten to death, all becasue we no longer remember how to deal with adversity.  If something doesn't go our way, hell, we'll just make someone else hurt even more.  What kind of logic is that?  Then I keep getting these letters in the mail from the support people back in NY.  If the god damned governement spent as much time trying to break down the gangs and putting criminals away, as they do pestering me about whether or not my kids all have sufficient medical insurance, this country would be back on it's feet in no time.  Each and every one of my kids receive support, have medical insurance, and are as well taken care of as possible, yet I still have to go to my benefits people at work and resubmit tons of paperwork so that they can be sure.  What a bunch of bullshit!

      Well, I was having trouble posting thigs to my Poker Journal because I've been in such a funk lately, so I thought I'd try a different format here and see how things go.  Sometimes all I need is an opportunity to vent.&nbsp; This blog won't be very specific, just things going on around me and thoughts I'm dealing with.&nbsp; One of the first things you should probably do when putting one of these together is consider your audience, and I'm here to tell you that I have done that one bit.&nbsp; :))  Anyway, let's see where this takes us.
