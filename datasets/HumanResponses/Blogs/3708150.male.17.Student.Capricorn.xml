       BFD is winding down, everyones finishing their work and asking Mehdi to look it over, and as usual he forgets about everyone in just about the order they asked for their work to be looked at.  grrrr...

       What more can I say? I'm lying in bed, looking at my TV, listening to Heat radio from EMAP and typing rather badly on a wireless keyboard.  No, I haven't got a PC with a WaveFinder hooked up to my telly - I own a Netgem iPlayer, a Digital Terrestrial Television STB with internet capabilities. Its capabilites certainly don't match up with those of a PC, but at a price of around Â£100 I think it offers great value for money compared to other less capable STBs.  Shortly, I shall probably blog on the iPlayer's features - and some of its problems.  Nighty, night!

       Posted by Stephane of Netgem:  Ogg Vorbis support should be available in the next software update.   YAY!! I asked for this almost a year ago, and didn't get a very positive response, so it was quite a pleasant surprise to see this.   However nothing is planed for WMA support.   The post was made in a thread started by an iPlayer owner to enquire about support for WMA on the iPlayer. The subject of Vorbis support was brought up after about 10 replies, but some quite correctly stated that more devices support WMA than they do Vorbis.  In true "me" style, I pointed out my confusion as to how, if natural market forces were at work, WMA became supported in so many players. Although that's kind of rhetorical because I think it's painfully obvious why. I could be a successful politician if only I could lie well.  So, in conclusion, iPlayer = html + mp3 + mpeg2 + email + ftp + dtt, and in the future +  ogg vorbis .  Hopefully in the not too distant future, but  this is Netgem  so typically there are no dates given.

       And I've had a cup of coffee. Never a good thing in my case, makes me jumpy and feeling even more tired for about half an hour or so. How thick can you get?!  Sam
