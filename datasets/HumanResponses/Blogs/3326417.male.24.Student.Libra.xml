      The case in chapter 3 asks the question, did John do something? Well yeah he did, he expressed his attraction for this girl. For someone who is John’s age you would figure that he would have some self-control. He should have kept it to himself and worked through his schoolboy crush. I may be biased because I am old fashioned (John is married), but it seems John would have been better speaking to a therapist about his feelings.  The other thought that the case provoked was the interns insistence that this was sexual harassment. Although I agree that John made a mistake, I don't think this was sexual harassment. My experience in life is only 24 years and maybe half of that I have been thinking of the opposite sex so I am not an expert, but is a crush sexual harassment? Was she really harassed? If I were to put a label on it, it seems more discriminatory than harassment.   So now the damage is done. What should John do? As CEO of the organization he may have to bite the bullet on this one. His candor although admirable was foolish. Because of the subordinate/mentor issue and the difficult journey the board would face in damage control if they backed John up, it would be in everyone’s best interest for John to resign.

           While reading the case in chapter two, I couldn't help but feel annoyed by Jim. It sounds bad, but it seems curious that he is the only one that felt this was an ethical dilemma. Someone close to me once said something that stuck with me, "There are good intentions and then there is the real world." He went on to explain that in the real world most people in business are looking out for number one, themselves.       This was part of the game. People like Kozlowski, Lay, Barbakow, and Scrushy took it too far, but what they were doing in a milder form was nothing new. The company I work for also faces these types of issues.  Example: Recently it was announced that my organization was to be acquired by another organization and the deal was for a cash buy out of $15 per share. Our stock prior to the announcement was $6 per share a 52 week low. Turns out that two months prior to the finished deal, upper management exercised stock options for bonuses including our CEO who was given 900,000 shares at $6 a share. Coincidence? Probably not.      Does this bother me? Unfortunately it doesn't. At least not yet. But those other 18,000 employees that were given stock options when the stock was $32 a share and then watched them dwindle to $6, I can understand where they are coming from.        So back to Jim and his dilemma. What I would do if I were Jim? Probably ask Joe for a cut. Just Kidding! I don't think that I would do anything. I don't think that this is so egregious that I need to risk my financial comfort and my families stability for this. Seems sad, but then again what would you do in the Real World?

      After reading the first case in Chapter 1 in the Perry book, I was reminded of a movie I saw some time ago called "A Band Played On". The scene was a closed door discussion of the several blood banks in California, arguing if they should test the blood supply with a slightly effective Hepatitis B test. They came to an overwhelming conclusion that the test was too expensive, and the costs did not equal the deaths occurred. Although all this was dramatized for Hollywood effect, I still remember one of the board members saying, "If doctors act like business men, then where do the patients go for doctors."  Although the details are different, I reflect on that scene because it reminds me that although Doctors and Administrators are in the business of helping people, they in fact still are a business. While it would be nice to have an inelastic budget, the reality is that resources are scarce.  The conflict in the first case centers around telling the truth. As a business person my first reaction is to keep things quiet, but as a person who likes to treat others as I would be treated, I find that my sense of moral obligation would require me to tell the patients the truth in the best way possible. I have always felt that honesty is always the best policy. At work I never dance around the truth with my customers. I am brutally honest and my customers appreciate me more knowing that I am being honest with them. Reps at work who dance around the truth (sometimes instructed to by people upstairs) end up leaving canceling their contracts and in some cases seek litigation. Bottom Line: Tell the truth most people appreciate it.

      I recently read an article in Fortune magazine about some of the woes faced by HCA and the fallout from the merger with Coloumbia. I wonder how prevalent upcoding is in health care organizations and if this is a larger problem. It makes me wonder if the problem is so prevalent that it is a leading contributor to rising costs of health care in the U.S. Are the settlements that have been struck through deals, recourse enough to scare other organizations from stealing? I don't think it is. HCA Columbia should have been brought to its knees as well as any other organization that has been ripping off the taxpayer for years. It seems to me that in health care ethics questions it is a recurring theme of "if everyone else does it, then it must be ok".

      Are there really such a thing as ethics in business? In the debate between team three and four I talked about the primary interest. According to the authors in the journals that I found, the primary interest is public health and the secondary interest is financial gain. I don't believe that for one second. I think that the primary interest is financial gain and the secondary interest is public health. When beer companies fund research to test the effects of alcohol is it any wonder that the scientists come back with a response that "Drinking a beer or two a day is good for you"! Companies fund this research with the primary interest of using the information to make financial gains. Wow beer is good for you? Maybe I should start drinking more often. Since I am on vacation in California visiting my dad, I am able to hear some of his personal horror stories about his business dealings. His response to the idea of ethics, "There is no integrity".  I pose the question, is it possible to work on complete integrity? Perhaps not, but we must strive for it no matter how many times we are "screwed" in the process. After all that is said and done, those organizations with the most integrity will be those that succeed.

      For this post I have deviated from my usual case review from the chapter to rant and rave about something that I think is unethical. For some time it has been absolutely driving me crazy the amount of time that I have had to deal with corporations and their mix ups, mistakes, and absolute unwillingness to return me my money. I myself work for a large corporation and carry out policies that subject my customers to the same run around.   Several times a week I have to call into a company, wait on hold, speak to someone I cannot understand, and hang up frustrated. Just recently I have had to deal with my insurances company and a medical billing company that both absolutely refuse to solve a situation that happened back in September.   Is this unethical? I question myself everyday when I go to work. While I won't go into specifics, I can assure that every angle is calculated. Where there is an opportunity to squeeze a dime from a customer, it is exploited.   There are organizations out there that do not subject their customers to this run around. Two that I can think of right away are Costco and Walmart. While they are not service based organizations, they are an immediate example of companies that would rather not argue and upset its customers. These organizations truly seek to please its most valuable component of business, its customers!  Is it possible for service organizations such as health care take this type of attitude? When I go to the doctors office would it be that far fetched to have someone greet me with a good afternoon or good morning? Could I solve my billing issues in one visit? I think the answer is yes! I think that health care organizations could benefit greatly from a customer oriented environment that seeks to absolutely please its customers.

           When reading Case #4, the prognosis of the financial strength of Hillside seems bleak. Increasing concerns about a variety of issues lead to the question: How long before we enter into socialized medicine? 41 million Americans do not have health insurance and according to the case 80% of them are working. I currently do not have health insurance and I work. What would I do in an emergency? Well there is always the emergency room, but I know how much of a pain in the butt that experience is. The University provides free basic care to all students, but my major plan is to avoid going to the hospital at all costs. This means limiting my risks and exposure to potential harmful agents. But if I wanted health insurance could I get it? Yes. Through work or even through an extended program through the University. If one wanted health insurance they could have it. People will have to make a choice between a cell phone, cable, etc. and health insurance.

      Blogging has finally come to a culmination. What have I gleaned from blogging? Well I certainly enjoyed self reflecting on what I think ethics means to me. While the book presents interesting scenarios that we can all learn from, I don't think it is an accurate representation of what reality is. I honestly believe that there is a lack of true integrity in the business world. The days of the "handshake" to seal a deal are long gone. The evolution of litigation has a great deal to do with this. What is moral has been replaced with what can we get away with legally?  We face many ethical issues in the coming century that will define the future of health care. Issues that we are currently struggling with now may be commonplace in society. The lack of a basic health care for all has certainly surfaced many ethical issues for us. The divide of what is financially feasible and what is morally justified will be the most difficult challenge faced by health care administrators. I look to meet these challenges with vigor, and I hope that the choices that I make in a will restore integrity and morality to the health care field.
