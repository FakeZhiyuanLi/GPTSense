Dunno why kinda miss my friends although I just saw them yesterday. Mayb I'm going mad soon? Haha,anyway, went out in the morning today. Didn't go for cca had important things to do.  Don't mind okie? I write song lyrics. Not really write lah, more like copy and paste. Haha, really like this song. *smiles*  ~Broken~ *Seether and amy lee*  I wanted  you to know, I love the way you laugh I want to hold you high, and steal your pain away I keep your photograph, and I know it serves me well I want to hold you high, and steal your pain.  'Coz I'm broken, when I'm lonesome And I don't feel right when you're gone away.  You gotta win, you don't feel me anymore.  The worst is over now, and we can breathe again I wanna hold you high, and steal my pain away There is so much left to learn, and no one left to fight I wanna hold you high, and steal your pain.  'Coz Im broken, when I'm open And I feel like that I'm strong enough 'Coz I'm broken, when I'm lonesome And I don't feel right when you're gone away. 'Coz I'm broken, when I'm openAnd I don't feel like that I'm strong enough 'Coz I'm broken, when I'm lonesome And I don't feel right when you're gone away. 'Coz I'm broken, when I'm lonesome And I don't feel right when you're gone away. 'Coz I'm broken, when I'm lonesome And I don't feel right when you're gone.  You gotta win, you don't feel me anymore.

      Hey! It's me again. Feeling rather sad and tired today. Dunno why. Yup, seems like nothing seems to make me happy at all. I try to laugh in school but deep inside I know that what I'm doing is just&nbsp;on the surface. sigh* I suspect I'm suffering from depression. Haha! LOL.   History was quite ok today, probably the most fun and interesting lesson today. Maths was kinda ok, we did group work. Oh yah, she tried to act smart today. So irriating, like so fussy about every single thing. Freak lah.   Opps, phone ringing. Write later.

      "I am the person who sit snext to you in class" "I am the person who is a bit overweight " "I am the preson who is laughed at because I am short" "I am the person who is picked on because I like computers" "I am the person who talks with an accent" "I am the person who isn't great at gym" " I am the person who is always to blame" " I am the person who takes the bus home in fear" " I am the person who stumbles when I walk too fast" " But I am also the person who is brave enough to wake up and do it all again the next day"  Nigel Potts  Hey, read the short story that is above? Good, cos I took it from a book. The story shows that whatever hardships we may face in school. Whether it may be bullying, friendship problems, results whatever. If we can wake up everyday and face all the problems , then there's nothing we can't do.  Yup, great huh? Yah, was reading last night, then read about this part and found it quite true. Especially the part " But I am also the person who is brave enough to wake up and do it all again the next day". Wow, that hit me like what, so I wrote or rather typed it down to share it with you.  Ok, let's see, day was kinda busy yesterday. Work to be done, projects not completed etc.etc.. I have to go out later to but some school stuff, ALONE. sigh* never mind lah, used to it . But not really decided if I should go 'cos the school stuff also not that important. Yah, oops, I need to go. I'll continue later. see yah.  *hugs and kisses* Li Ting  +fly up high and leave the world behind*

       Hey! Whew, what a long day it was yesterday. Friday the 13th somemore. *sigh* Luckily, my projects are done. If not, i'll be like my friends rushing my work even until now. But I finished of course got sacifice lah.Slept very late,then went to school the next day feeling very tired and restless.  sigh* Many things happen yesterday. Bad day, got scolded by ppl for nothing. Seems like all sec 3s in a bad mood. Probably because of projects, not enough sleep. That's why. After school, also like everyone rush to the school comp lab to do finish their work. Evryone was like " quick, quick 3 o'clock ready". Yah, bev, rice and I were just going around to see who needed help. So good right?  Went to school today, really busy. Had to stick the tags on the OHPs, other than that Sharon pusjed her share of her work to me,'cos she had to go and pass up her projects. Ok lah, then I got no choice must do. So, besides sticking, I had to do stock taking. Making sure that the OHPs were the correct ones. OMG, there were like what 10 of them of I slowly do, then after that. Stupid Amanda had to ask me and Wendilynn to push back . Luckily, Mrs Goh say they must push. Not us. Freak lah. Sometimes I feel that I don't really like amanda alot.  Yup, now doing chinese project. Finishing soon, later must call them up. Ask if must do reflection. Yah, wish me luck. Ok, I have to go. See you soon,take care. Bye!!  *hugs and kisses* Li Ting  ~happy memories+

       Hey, I'm back again. Just went to friendster and checked out the bulletin bored. Saw this really very sad story, so I thought I shared it with you.  As I sat there in English class, I stared atthe girl next to me. She was my so called "bestfriend". I stared at her long, silky hair, andwished she was mine. But she didn't notice me like that, and I knew it. After class, she walked up to me and asked me for the notes she had missed the day before and handed them toher. She said "thanks" and gave me a kiss on thecheek. I wanted to tell her, I want her to knowthat I don't want to be just friends, I love herbut I'm just too shy, and I don't know why.  11th grade The phone rang. On the other end, it was her. She was in tears, mumbling on and on about how her love had broke her heart . She asked me tocome over because she didn't want to be alone,so I did. As I sat next to her on the sofa, Istared at her soft eyes, wishing she was mine. After 2 hours, one Drew Barrymore movie, andthree bags of chips, she decided to go to sleep. She looked at me, said "thanks" and gave me akiss on the cheek. I want to tell her, I want her to know that I don't want to be justfriends, I love her but I'm just too shy, and Idon't know why.  Senior year The day before prom she walked to my locker. "Mydate is sick" she said; he's not going to gowell, I didn't have a date, and in 7th grade, wemade a promise that if neither of us had dates, we would go together just as "best friends". Sowe did. Prom night, after everything was over, Iwas standing at her front door step! I stared ather as she smiled at me and stared at me with her crystal eyes. I want her to be mine, but shei sn't think of me like that, and I know it. Then she said "I had the best time, thanks!" and gaveme a kiss on the cheek. I want to tell her, I want her to know that I don't want to be just friends, I love her but I'm just too shy, and Idon't know why.  Graduation Day A day passed, then a week, then a month. BeforeI could blink, it was graduation day. I watchedas her perfect body floated like an angel up onstage to get her diploma. I wanted her to be mine, but she didn't noticeme like that, and I knew it. Before everyonewent home, she came to me in her smock and hat ,and cried as I hugged her .Then she lifted her head from my shoulder andsaid, "you're my best friend, thanks" and gaveme a kiss on the cheek. I want to tell her, Iwant her to know that I don't want to be justfriends, I love her but I'm just too shy, and I don't know why.  A Few Years Later Now I sit in the pews of the church. That girl is getting married now. I watched her say "I do" and drive off to her new life, married toanother man. I wanted her to be mine, but she didn`t see me like that, and I knewit. But before she drove away, she came to me and said "you came!". She said "thanks" and kissed me on the cheek. I want to tell her, I want her to know that I don't want to be just friends, I love her but I'm just tooshy, and I don't know why.  Funeral Years passed, I looked down at the coffin of a girl who used to be my "best friend". At the service, they read a diary entry she hadwrote in her high school years. This is what it read: "I stare at him wishing he was mine, but he doesn't notice me like that ,and I know it .I want to tell him ,I want him to know that I don't want to be justfriends, I love himbut I'm just too shy, and I don't know why. I wish he would tell me he loved me! I wish I did too... I thought to my self, and I cried. I Love U I Love U I Love U..."  Remember to tell the person you like how you feel. I know it's hard but you need to. Don't be like the girl in the story.  *hugs abd kisses* Li Ting  ~you rock my world*
