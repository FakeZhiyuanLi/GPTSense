       ..Hey. I'm all alone. xD Joe's on Socom ll talking to Hawk..they're doing something I can't be included in. Heh.&nbsp; I dunno, but whenever Joe and Hawk get together, I feel left out. It's not them, it's me and my idiotic self. xD Dan didn't get on today..Haven't spoken to Art in awhile. He's prolly doing Lou..xD Awhness. I think I have a fever. I can't believe I'm leaving tomorrow..I'm kinda nervous about it..scared when I come back , things are going to be different. A lot different. Joe hasn't said anything yet..Maybe I should talk, but I don't wanna sound pissy. Lol. I'm hopeless..I wonder what he's doing. It must be nice..not having me tagging along..and sucking. xD w00tage. Today's post was short, and I'm not bothering with making it pretty or signing and stuff. Peace out.

        [.I know it's been two days, and I apologize, but of course I will make up for it with tonight's post. Tonight, we shall talk about love, or what I think is love..Mmks..here goes. -dun lemme sound corny God, dun lemme sound corny xD- .] .::I'm not sure about you, but I don't think I could go on forever without love. I look at some people who are around eighty years old and never have a husband or wife..I don't understand how they make it honestly. How can you wake up and see no one beside you? Hear no one snoring..xD? How can you eat alone..dance alone..sing alone..get older alone..die alone?..If there's one thing I think I honestly NEED to survive, it's love. Maybe it's cuz I'm young and stupid and think I'll fall apart If I don't have someone to tell me I'm pretty all the time. -rolls eyes- Whatever! SCREW YOU! lol. I know what I want and need and you do not. -gives you the finger..lol jk- Anyways..ahem..lol..Love seems so great, so..I dunno..beautiful? Lol. Look, I'm trying my HARDEST not to sound totally QUEER! lol. Bare with me. =p I just wonder if anyone..can honestly..ever love me. Like, What if no one will ever fall in love with me?..What if I wasn't made to be with someone?..What if I'll be one of those old ppl I mentioned?=o That'd SUCK. I just want someone to think I'm beautiful when I'm all gross and who'll always love me..who doesnt care if I act stupid a lot or complain..who'll make me breakfast sometimes..and sing me songs..who'll dance wif me in our huge living room with the lights dimmed..who'll think I'm pretty when I'm all fat with our baby =p..someone who'll love EVERYTHING about me..and only me..just someone to be there..forever..no matter what. =\ I dunno, is that too much to ask!? Lol, prolly. =p -reads over it- WOW. THAT'S QUEER SOUNDING. Lol. Oh well. Joe's just got on. w00t. Lol. I LOVE YOU JOE! Yes, so..I'm done. I'll write some more later. Joe and I are doodling xD. Muahs!!! -ill also sign it later lol..- xD::.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LLLLLLLLLLLLLAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTEEEEEEEERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR     &nbsp;   [.-Screams head off..- Siiighhhh. Screw love, no one wants to hear that shit. So..today was ok. I sat around all day..and waited..for a certain someone. He had good reasons this time. w00t. Dan and Mark kinda entertained me in our conference. Thanks guys. I just had ice cream. It was good. Joe and I are arguing again. w00t. See how much we LOVE each other? xD It's awesome. I can't wait til Tuesday..Miami is going to rock..BIG TIME. Four days..away..with God. Maybe&nbsp;Him and I&nbsp;can discuss how crappy my life is right now? Yea? Ya think? We'll see. Or maybe I'll catch a disease LOL. w00tage. Yea..i dun giveee a fuckk..I need VODKA. Lol. xD Vodka Vodka Vodka..Vodka is LOVE. :X -hugs Vodka- D00d..Im hungry again.

Sorry Marcus, you know I didn't mean it. xD Omg..The tv is blank..:">Oh..it's not on. LOL. Yea..Don't worry about me..I'm trying to act stupid so I won't rip my hair out or something. =) Breathe In..Breathe Out..Lalala. \:D/ -Dancess- Omg..tis 11:11 PM. w00t! Phew.

            .::Sigh. Things have been really cruddy lately. I know it's a bit early, but I wanted to write today's post now. Mmks, so let's talk about how I'm feeling at the moment, shall we?  My day:  I woke up at 7:40, because I had some fucking nightmare about roaches. x_X Then, I got online. No one was on so I sat there..and went on Neopets. (w00t) At around..nine o'clock, Krystal called and asked if I could babysit Desmond and Damon for a few hours. I had no problem with it and I need the money so I agreed. So I sat online more..doing nothing..watching my pathetic life rot away with a machine propped up on my knees..-sigh- Then Joe got on, or did he get on when I first got on?.. He might have, I don't remember really. I was half asleep.Soo..SKIP ALL THE OTHER BORING ADVENTS OF MY DAY SO FAR TO NOW. I'm listening to stupid ass depressing songs, my stomach is ripping apart, Joe and I are like..I dunno. Dan is er..smelling his fingers and yawning like always while hugging his knees. I was going to put his funny blanket pictures on here, but I don't think they suit the mood I'm in. Sorry pal. -sigh- Anyways, I have church this afternoon where I will figure out how much I still owe for the Miami trip next week. I have a feeling it will be around $150. w00t. I'm glad my parents have offered to pay that $250 trip, maybe I'll actually enjoy myself. Who knows? Anyways, I made plans this weekend to go see a movie with Sam and maybe Kim and Larissa..holy fuck my stomach hurts..=\..yea anyways..so back to that, when I'm supposed to be going on the church encounter and bringing my friends with me. So if Carrie calls you Sam, say I've been begging you to go, mmks? Thanks I appreciate it. Ow..my stomach..is ripping..apart. Ahem, so yea. Here I am, moody, angry at the world, wondering when I'm going to get my shower or if I'll even take one, and also wondering if eating that brownie mix with raw eggs in it made me sick..who knows? But I also felt bad last night and I didnt eat brownie mix them..Ow..-stare-..it doesnt hurt..it doesnt hurt..it ISNT killing me..>_> -shifts, trying to ignoring the ripping- Wow, I just got up and noticed you can see my underwear. Lucky you. -blink- Yea so..-grasps at stomach- Holy..@*&#^$*&%*&#&*^#*@&!..Ow. I want a hamster. I shall name him Goober and he shall be my goober. Wow, I've made a lot of grammar errors, but I'm in too much pain to correct them. Ew. I need to shave my legs..I haven't in weeks. They are VERY hairy. Sexy, huh? Yes, I know. So like..this post isn't really organized and itis probably hard to understand, but who cares. I don't. So now it's 2:32 PM and I'm thinking about how I should type something interesting, but I cannot think of anything to say. So I will go. I might post agaist after church, not sure.::.

It burns and it won't stop tonight. It makes me angry that my Cell Leader did it this time. I gave her a piece of my mind tonight. I'll regret it in the morning. Then I looked like a pussy when the tears started coming. I hate saying mean things to people..and I hate feeling like I have to do something I don't want to. Which was what she was telling me. If only Lauren knew what a horrible person I really am..she'd be so dissapointed. And that makes me burn inside. She said if anything was wrong I could tell her..but I just shook my head and walked in the bathroom, while I screamed at myself inside my head. I stayed in there awhile before deciding I wanted to go home. I just realised..the search bar on my browser says Ass Fucking..-blink- Anyways..I feel rotten and dead inside. I'm such a fake..I'm truly disgusted with myself. I look at Lauren and Carrie..All I see is something..beautiful. They appear so innocent in their actions, their thoughts. And here I am..being so damn screwed up. They SAY I can tell them, but they could never understand. I sure as hell hope this Miami trip next week changes me. I'm so tired of not being happy. Acting like I'm all..good and stuff. I have no social life. I can remember in the 6th grade I went out almost every weekend with Sam. We went out, we had fun. Now rarely do I go anywhere besides church. I wanna be able to touch my friends..to laugh and SEE them..there..not online all the time. I wanna be able to know that when I'm pissed or upset, I can call anytime and they'll give a shit. Gosh, I sound fucked. I look it too. My cheeks are puffy, eye-liner smeared down them. My hair needs to be washed..and my eyes are bloodshot. Bah. -smashes mirror- I just want to be ..pure. I know, corny. But, I want to have a clear conscience. I don't want to think of all the bad things I do. Sometimes I think it's too much. Way too much. Why does this have to happen to me?..Why am I the one who always feels worthless. God should have made me pretty. Bah. -turns on Puddle Of Mudd-Blurry-.."CAN YOU TAKE IT ALL AWAY!?" No, you cannot. You suck. I suck. We all suck. It's sad when you sin for so long, that you dont even care anymore. If it didn't hurt, I'd say I wanted to die. I feel alone and stupid. I am. w00tage. Peace Out!

            [.Lovely Pic , eh?.]   .:: Today sucked really, and Limp Bizkit's music isn't helping my mood. I'm so damn moody;it's really unhealthy. I don't feel quite as ugly anymore. I guess it as a phase thing. -shrug- I fucking hate how I come off as some hugely perverted bitch online. -kicks self- Today at the hospital I almost fell asleep again. w00tage. "It's my way or the highway." I want to go out with Samantha. We have tons of fun together! And she said I was beautiful. xD I LURVE YOU SAMANTHA! Anyways, I was on mic with Joe;he fell asleep. I heard him breathing hard/half snoring for awhile..but I suppose the mouse moved somehow away from the mic, so I exited out of the conference. -sigh- I wish he was on. Today on Neopets (w00tage!!) someone said their dad died like..I think it was two weeks ago, and I think I realised how much I loved my dad. I freakin' love how he smells..I remember when I was little and he'd go out of town for a few days, I'd smell his shirts. It's this weird thing. Lol. I know, I'm weird.  Well..As far as me and Joe are going, I think it's a lot better. We didn't fight today at all and I'm getting Socom ||, so I can play online with him. He doesn't think I'll spend that much money though. Just wait.  Lauren got online today drunk, Heh. She and Justin broke up. I'm sad she's upset about it, but maybe it's for the best. He treats her like shit a lot of the time. She deserves someone so much better. She's so fucking awesome. ^_^. And Adam got mad cause I'm with Joe..which he never knew. So he's deleted me. I'm getting upsetting letters from Jon. =\ Why can't he just stop? He knows what he says hurts me. =\ What an ass. Yea..  Oh! This morning I was woken up by a rooster. Funny thing is, I don't have a rooster. xD Har Har. MMks. I'm done for today! ::.  -Y4[]-[]0o_w[]-[]0|2e    [.Kiss Kiss...My Ass!.]     |F|R|I|E|N|D|S| |L|I|K|E| S|A|M| |A|N|D| |L|A|U|R|E|N|    MY Anti-Drug.

        [.Well.. Last night I was talking to all my wonderful friends and my baby, Joe, when I realised how beautiful my chic friends are. Talk about a freaking wake up call when I looked in the mirror. =\ Maybe it was because I seriously needed a shower and wasn't wearing any makeup, but I felt incredibly UGLY. Horrid. I wanted to cut my face off like in Hannibal..Well..Okay, I wasn't that ugly, but I sure as hell could have been A LOT prettier. -We interupt this message to inform you that Lauren and Justin are once again..irritated with each other..ahem..-  So..back to my self esteem problems..-rolls eyes- I think maybe I should start working out? And tanning or something? >_> There has got to be a way for me to improve myself. THERE HAS TO BE!!..=\ Or maybe there's no hope.  Alert! Alert! Pity Crew needed!! Alert! Alert!   Anyways, tonight at church I felt GUILTY again. As always. I'm heading down the road to  HELL  quite in a hurry. I fucking screw up all the time, and if I was God, I'd send me to hell too.-sigh- One of these days, I'm going to start doing what's right and tell the world to stop trying to fucking ruin me! See..I'm cussing..Uh.  Here's some things I need to fix in myself :  -I need to respect my parents.  -I need to stop being hateful and angry. -I need to have more faith and stop doubting God. -I need to stop cussing.  -I need to stop wanting to get drunk all the time.  -I need to take care of my animals and actually spend time with them.  -I need to control my lust. Omg. I have a HUGE lust problem. x_x -I need to hang out with my friends. They probably think I hate them. -I need to accept that I AM worthy of being loved.  -I need to start praying again. -I need to start reading my bible again.  -I need to go to church more. -I need to forgive people.  -I NEED TO COMPLETELY CHANGE!!  Well..enough about my empty conscience..now about   Joe.    Well..we're getting along. Little things still kind of tick us off though, but we're working on it. I'm trying not to think about Kitty. I wonder if she had to beg him to put her in his profile. Lol. I know..I'm pathetic.

      Today I was playing SOCOM II while waiting for 4 o'clock to roll around so I could call Dev and enjoy wakin her up and making her say funny stuff on the telephone while she was still asleep and lost sounding! :">  Instead, Dev realized I wasn't talking much on Yahoo and got on SOCOM to check her stats, and joined the game I was in! I was upset cause I had been losing, even though they were going against me 2 vs 1. The next round started and Dev goes really loud "DUN DUN DUUUUNN!"! I almost jumped out of my freakin' seat cause' I was so happy I swear! She turned my whole day around right there. I was sooooo surprisssssed how just the sweet sound of her voice and the cute way she goes "DUN DUN DUUUUUN" could make me SO happy. I wanted to drop my controller and kiss her and hug her all over like I hadn't seen her in a million years or like she had almost died in an accident and I was glad to see she was okay. I felt like that was the happiest moment in my life ever! Dev I love you SO much I can't describe it any other way. You're the perfect little thing to me and I cherish it. I'm sorry for all the times I made you feel bad when I was trying to help but I didn't realize I was being so harsh; and I'm sorry for falling asleep on you when I could have gone to bed at the same time as you; and everything else I can't think of right now. You mean so much to me Dev Dev, never go away!  And we can't forget this...  I dunno if I forgot any though... Cute things Dev Dev says or Dev Dev thinks is cute when I say and things we do!:  [ cmere dev ] [ AHW, you died! ] [ AHW, you fell! ] [ you know i love you, right dev dev? -BANG- ] [ DAUGHTER! ] [ now you listen here SON! ] [ babyyyyyy! ] [ joeeeeeee! ] [ i'm gonna sit here and take a nap ] [ you go out and kill them while i take a nap in this bush ] [ -dancing around night stalker poles and crossroad trees- ] [ -strip dancing with our handguns out around the poles and trees- ] [ -humpage in front of the dead bodies when we're alive- ] [ -get all mushy in front of other guys to get them jealous- ] Hell yeah :X   and it's really really cute and awesome for ANY time Dev says [ AHWWWWW!! ]  God I love your voice Dev Dev.... YOU! Everything about YOU Dev Dev!  While Dev Dev was napping or something I helped my mom bring in groceries, ate some food from Sonic she brought home, drove this laptop computer my dad fixed to some guy because my dad didn't have time, took some of our trash and went to my grandpas house and got his trash up because he's in a wheelchair now and needs help sometimes, got his mail and put something in his mailbox, went back out and got the mail when the mail man came by again, watched t.v. and talked with my grandpa for a long time, drank iced and chilled water, drove home, kept myself awake for Dev Dev. I hope she surprises me on SOCOM like that again cause' it's the best feeling to hear her voice out of nowhere :X     .  Dev Dev you're sleeping right now ..... hope you're having sweet Devan and Joseph dreams :X:X:X:-*:-*:-*>:D<>:D<>:D  Over and out *makes walkie talkie swoosh noise and cuts off his radio* *gone*

      Hey look, I'm a guy and I'm posting in a blog. Aren't I cool? Anyway, today is not a good day; in fact, it's it's the perfect  BAD  day.&nbsp; I got into a car accident. Before I tell you about that, I read my sweet hearts blog today and it seems I've been leaving her out a lot lately when my friend Ervey is on. I'm really sorry sweetie, I feel stupid and I take full blame, I should have payed more attention to you.  You guys, Dev is  incredible . Dev goes out and buys all this expensive stuff just to play with me on SOCOM II, a Playstation 2 game. It's like the sweetest thing anyone has  EVER  done for me; because she did it to play with me and spent a lot of money on it! I know she loves me and I love her too. You spoil me Dev!&nbsp;Dev dev, YOU are the greatest!  Okay, this morning sometime after Dev went to bed, I got on the couch and layed down. I quickly realized that this is how most of my accidental naps take place, so I got up and decided I will take my Dad's car for a "spin" to get used to driving that stick shift better, and mostly to drive fast. Boy was I in for an unexpected surprise.  >_  >_ Skip the bloody details and I'm okay, just scratches and a banged up head; and can't forget the fucked up car. This repeats in my head: I could have died. I'm sitting there shocked at what I have done, scared half to death of whether I heart myself bad enough to die, and whether I damaged the car enough to blow up, concidering it was on it's fucking side where the gas tank was. From my standpoint right now, as far as I am concerned, I don't ever want to drive again. I hate people, I don't trust them. I wish I could walk everywhere, but I can't, so I'll get over it, and drive later.. like much later. I'm afraid.  I love you Dev.&nbsp;I'm now glad I'm still alive, but I&nbsp;am still pressured. My parents are still gone on their week&nbsp;vacation thing to Reno,&nbsp;Nevada. They know, I called them. &nbsp;  By the way, if it means anything, I buckled up. [ Insert fake chuckle that I never really did, but might would have if I wasn't so pissed off ]  &nbsp;     &nbsp;   Until next time.. *gone*
