      One of my pet topics is this whole battle of the sexes, since i live with both men and women its good to know the difference between the two parties. But the division may change with the production of testosterone for over the counter usage. this scares me, because i dont want women to be more like men, because then they arent women, and i dont like the idea of just a single gender species. Gender and sex: there is a difference, you can have the sex of a male but the gender of a female, or visa versa. Sex is the physilogical person, Sex is you have male genitals your a man, you have female your a woman. Fine, Gender is different, gender is the physilogical traits and the psychological traits. Gender male: you have male gentials and like cars, shorts and sports. Gender Female: You have female genitals and like dolls and dresses and talking. when the genders cross over, Nances and tomboys thats when there is little distinction. SO! my point is that testerone doses to women is bad. Because what that shows is that you dont liek who you are. You arent proud to yell i AM MAN/WOMAN HEAR ME ROAR.  one thing that is strange is the abuse of us fellas by womenfolk, ok the past has been pretty patricarchal, but its not like us guys arent easy to manipulate. but lately women seem to always taking the piss at the fellas, and with good reason. 90% of crimes are done by men, men are violent, arrogant, pig-headed, risk-takers (far beyond the point where its rational) overly compeditive and the worst communicators. We are more senstive emotionally, yes! we dont show it. and have a weaker immune system. Out bodies are weaker, it burns out faster maximum mileage of a man is 140 years. a woman is 150 years. And men are more likely to commite suicide.   that is a given, most people know all of this, or some of it. but what about the othe side of the story. Us guys are stronger, physically, we are more active, we have the capasity to work harder and the capasity to work longer. we are more driven. We are more amibitous. We are better in science, Information technology and maths. We are better engineers, we are better soliders. our bodies are designed for all of the above.   Why? WHY are men like men, well firstly because we are taught to be this way. by parents, teachers, tv, etc. and most teachers are women and the more dominant parent is the monther:P. But us guys naturally blame something we cant control. Testorone, this is a hormone, and guys have 3 times of this hormone than what girls have. this is essence of man in a bottle.   the difference between guys and girls stem form differnce in the concentration of hormones, progesterone, oestrogen, testerone are the biggies. testerone makes you more violent more active more agressive, stronger in physic, weaker in immune system. tests were done where testerone were given to women, they became more like men. there you have it. but i disagree on women taking this hormone. they want it to be able to support a career a family and a social life. they dont have the energy to be the breadwinner and the housewife at the same time! testosterone opens up the energy and invigorate the body. so they have the energy to keep going. Think of it this way, how often do you meet a single father who doesnt have the energy to do everything? Time is another matter....  but dont forget the bad side of men. this will be in women too! they become more reckless, more bastardly more of a prick than before. diversity is key in the theory in natural selection, if we all want to be men and do man things, what happens when the wind changes? What happenes when the womenly positives are more suitiable? you know? the verbal skills will vanish, the coperative powers and drive for harmony not ones own self will be destoryed, and if the conditions change we will be fucked. What proper fucked? Yes tommy, before ze germans get here....

      I was at a party last night, Yes a Party. i supose you could call it a party, really it was some people over at Sarahs, it was good fun though, the guys were like guys the gals like gals. mad fun. i coulda won bilionare too if i have found that ruddy property card in time. eeeeuch. I do hope i didnt make any enemies this time, none of the others seemed to be too annoying. Hooray. now Sarah invites me to churchie mcchurch. should i go? i dont have anything better to do so i dont know. Luke was there, i dont think anyone noticed the fact that he has a bad habit of trying to have the last word. fish was funny with his coupling thing with me, i think everyone esle laughed nervously, im surprised some of those people were so homophobic, meanwhile i frankly dont care, just dont try anything on me, keep your hands to yourself boys. Simon kept himself in check this time around, good to see, hes finally hit pubity insiting hes paired with a girl for any activity, very good progress. Sarah seemed preoccupied with other people, and she called ME a Snob? well well, Enter the Hypocracy. Oh one fellow was alot fun, Josh. Yay, he wasnt happy with my choice in music. I dont know why, i mean i dont like garage rock. so i can understand that he doesnt like Korn or ICP, or Disturbed. But contrary to what he thinks, They arent Satan Worshipping whatevas but even if they are what does it matter, ive still got my head fixed on proper. And clearly i withstand "Brainwashing" as he calls it, i mean, im  a Muslim hanging with a bunch of christians, when You Dance with the Devil, You wait for the song to finish. But that got me thinking, which bands do i acutally like, because everyone seems to have preferences where the only definate for me is that i hate Rap. EMEemiemieemine! DIE DIE DIE!   So i thought about it and the results even suprised me.   (In order of genre)  Artists i Like.   Comedy : Arrogant Worms Tripod  " Harcore ": Disturbed Korn Linkin Park ICP (except tht juggalo rubbish)   Popular : Will smith Evanensence Delta Goodrem Frank sinatra (Go Old school) Ameil (Its all about Obession)   The Unknowns : Rob Dougan (You know Clubbed to Death?) Frenzel Romb John Butler Trio   & Various Movie Soundtracks : Matrix (both of them) Gladiator Lock, Stock (Go James Brown) Queen of the Damned Enemy of the State Fight Club!!! Love the Dust brothers.  That looks pretty rounded to me. My Top 3 Songs & how long theyve been Up there. Clint Mansell - Requriem for a dream. About 7 months Ameil - I love You (Obession) About 2,3 months? Frankie Sinatra (i think) - Fly me to the moon. About a Year.  I mean its not that i dont like other songs, but these are the ones that STAND out that i like and listen to a fair bit. Funny how many Love related kinda things i have in the list, i supose theres no avoiding it. But seriously i RECCOMEND any of the afore mentioned to anyone.

      Yes this is the start of something new, I never thought id descend to this level, but my web page is so ridiculously me, I might put in more time. Yes. But actually I don't know what this thing is for? Am I meant to write insightful comments and have people respond? Or is this simple where I post anything regarding vats of cheese? I am not sure, and until I actually figure out what I should be writing, I think I'll just keep this option open, but I probably wont use it.

      They think its all about sex. There's more in life than sex. We are meant to be INTELLIGENT LIFE. Such carnal desires are beneath us and must be controlled.   has anyone actually loved anyone else platonically? Or has it always been Lust with you people?   Yes feel sex desires, but don't let that drive you. Don't let that choose your way of dress. WE ARE MORE THAN SPERM AND EGGS. What's the point of propagating ourselves then if we don't have society and integrity? Just for the sake of it?!??!?!

      So now we enter, end game. Watching DW journal, it seems to be all about the spacey new around the world. Right now talking about moving the mars. "Earth is the cradle of Humanity, but who wants to spend there whole life in a cradle?" Yes, a very witty quote. Confidenially, i myself wouldnt mind moving to the moon, or to mars. that would be very very cool. Heck there are so many places we could go, just in our solar system, that would be wonderful. Humans spreading thourghout the solar system, in time we could go anywhere in the galaxy or the universe, there is infiniter resources out there! You wouldnt need to have one child policies or anything, because you just move overcrowed populations to anyother planet. Youd have totally different cultures as the landscape and terrain would effect the people living on it. Can you imagine movies from Europa? Or IO? or Mars ? Or the moon. From a space station orbiting Saturn? Beautiful.  Just a thought.

       "Where are the Snowdens of yesteryear?" asked Yossarian.     It was easy to read the message in his entrails. Man was matter, that was Snowden's secret. Drop him out a window and he'll fall. Set fire to him and he'll burn. Bury him and he'll rot, like other kinds of garbage. The spirit gone, man is garbage. That was Snowden's secret. Ripeness was all.

      Look.  I know its a bit morbid, but every material thing of yours will be destroyed. Everything your build will crumble.    you want to be the richest man? (and or woman)  that's not going to stop death. You can delay it a little. Your still going to die, and someone else who DIDN'T work for it will take it. What is that money worth then?   Cars. (except the Supra) will rust. Empires will fall. Fame fades. Time Heals All Wounds. Superficial thing are useless pursuits. And maybe you could say relationships are a goal, true love etc. etc. But YOUR STILL GOING TO DIE MOTHERFUCKER! That love will be forgotten, or the loved/lovers will die too.    when you really think about it. What really matters is that YOUR happy with your efforts. That you feel happy with yourself.    Everyone says when you die you remember everything.  Hell isn't fire. Or pain, or daemons. Its guilt. The guilt of a entire lifetime, to think about for Eternity.  guilt is what eats your soul.    that's what I was lightly saying when I said "id like to end up on my death bed with proof that in the end..... I didn't fuck up." I was hoping that I wouldn't have to say all of the above, and give further evidence of my fucked up ness but .......... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

      I wrote this hoping to offend people. So far people have generally ignored it, And so they should. Its so hard to argue this point of view, its illogical and fallacious. *sigh* looks like I'll never get into the Toastmasters club now...   I said that I'd tackle Male tendency to be stupid. But id also like to first look at a topic that Meg brought to my attension, which leads into several other issues.    Somewhere between Hamish's crimes against humanity, Kenji's pornos, and Tassos's plea for a return to our roots. Meg post a message that said something along the lines of "I need to get back into a relationship" I wish to highlight the word NEED.  NEED/ni:d/ v.  & n -- v. Be under the necessity or obligation.    obligation, necessity, are very powerful words. Dare I say it, but 'need' in the sentence implies a requirement of existence to have a relationship.  the guys generally like, or want, or find it better to be in a relationship, but very few of us actually need a relationship.   Meg may have been saying it lightly but for many of the female form they Require a relationship in order to define what sort of person they are.    Its true isn't it? Some women latch onto a fella and use him to reflect how they are. "He's popular and strong and masterful, AND HE PICKED ME!!!!, im sooo cool" then, shes destoried when he fucks off, cause he can live on his own and she cant. Becuase HE knows who he is. He can love himself. (this time im not refering to jerking off) 8===========> The man is defined by his actions. The action defines a woman.   think of this very very carefully. lets take 2 groups which most people dont like. Jocks & sluts.  A jock loves the rugby A slut loves the cock but  a jock is truely defined by following the phillosphy of jockism. (stupidity at lunch, worship of sport, hate of nerds and intelligence) there are some rugby players that dont fit in the same catergory as Jocks in the true sense of the word.  but a slut is defined by actions, even just one action. of sexual activity. there is no doctrine and general attitude of sluts. at least not at the same Fascist drivings of Jockism. you can have goth sluts,  blonde bimbo sluts, minga sluts, etc. groups of entirely different people and different approaches to life.   Instead of using The action defining a woman. use principles to define the action. As a wise (and senile) man says "Stay True to youself"  --Tavis.  8===========> Note there has never been a matriachal-female civilization. Why?   is it the psychological nature of the cock & cunt? the exernal, outwards cock builds the psychology of expansionism. although the inward cunt has a psychology of self conciousness and containment.    that is one theory.   What ever happened to the Girl power idea? it was there and it just faded away. why? did men crush this rebellion, No. it fell apart on its own. everyone jokes about women controlling the world in one way or another. but is that really possible oweing to the dependaceny of ladies on gents?    YES YOU CAN JOKE, BUT ULTIMATELY YOU NEED MEN. 8==========> Men cant get away with anything rotton unless women let them. every conceviable transgression (crime, violence, sexism)! women have the ultimate power of sexual acceptance/dissaproval. Although women cant control male action they can control theirs most of which is tollerating the male behaviour to avoid loneliness, self-assertivness and self-sufficeny.  it makes sense doesnt it? tollerate a little bit of shit to get the guy, and youve got access to all the money this fella makes. Why isn't there females in high administrrative positions? BECAUSE THEY CANT BE BOTHERED!    Dont give me that Sexism in the workplace bullshit, theres rascism too, and still Curries, Gook, Fags, Wogs, Spicks, Pinkos, Hispanics, are getting to the top. Females love to cope out. give up, settle for less.   Guys wont do it BECAUSE OUR EGO WONT ALLOW IT. 8===============> Recap: we've covered alot today. Firstly, Male definition and female definition in society is ultimately different. Owing to the focusing on different aspects of the person Secondly, SOME Women lack the drive to truely excel. because they dont really know what they want. Thirdly, SOME women instead cling onto the males in order to define themselves as a person, and thereby allowing male stupidity to take place.  Fourthly, Man (usually) doesnt suffer from this because ultimately our ego gudies us in a direction. (not nesscerally good) Fifth: This doesnt apply to everyone.   Every guy deep down inside believes theyll change the world. "What we do in life echos in Eternity", a very masculine and egotistical statement.    Ladies get off your whiny, depressed and complaining asses AND CHANGE THE WORLD

      have you ever ejaculated and not orgasmed, your just standing there think, "Damn, that was a waste of Time"    Sometimes your penis is there looking at you going, look mate im not done yet. a quick and meaningfull conversation ensues that ends up with your penis holding firm and shaking his head in dissaproval.   sometimes the cock has a mind of its own, and you awake to find hes been up five minutes before you.  Penis: Hey, Howyagoing? Me: What the fuck are you doing up so early? Penis: needed to exercise *footsteps heading towards bedroom door* Me: shit is that mum? Penis: ooooh yeah, your in trouble now biatch!    so hamish can talk about molestation but i cant talk aobut something that plauges ever man who has sex with hand sandwitches and gives them to Mr. Rogers to eat.    Anyway, clearly i dont need a penis due to my lack of getting any. but then again getting nothing would be much better than Mr. Rogers sex *glares at Mr. Rogers * *winks at Mr. Rogers * *whistles at dog*    yes Mr. Rogers - Mr. Rogers sex, i can see that people have a drill to thier temple and ready to turn it on in order to bore that image out of thier head.

       "Animation isn't the illusion of life; it is life."  ...Chuck Jones    He was a man. I never met him personally but he's one of the few people I admire. Of course nobody knows him. I seem to have an attraction for unsung heroes. Like Robbie Dougan, everyone knows clubbed to death but few would take the time to find out who the artist is, I like others did. Well chuck Jones was a major force in Warner bros. Looney tunes. A masterpiece of animation. People admire the simpsons for the fact that jokes are ironic, one side of the joke is funny to the children, like Bart running into a trash can, but adults appreciate jokes about the republicans. A two-edged sword. You know, for young and old and in between. So, Looney tunes was the first sort of animation to utilize such humor. I mean in comparison Disney is shit. M-I-c-k-e-y can just fuck off. The depth and humor of bugs bunny is exponentially w00t. Disney is good too, but; its cute funny, not witty.  I grew up on these cartoons, and I'm glad I did, they were really something, classics. Better than today's jap anime shit like Pokemon. Even at that age one could appreciate the artistic value of each cartoon, the music was perfectly orchastrated, building mood; the animation was clever and vivid, and the jokes and gags were certainly familiar and predictable after the 30 consecutive cartoon, I got TAPES of the stuff. But it was golden. It was always funny, it always be funny. Universal Eternal.   Chuck Jones. Did NOT start Warner bros. He did NOT make Porky pig, Elmer fudd and the other old school WB characters. But he did create Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Sylvester & tweety, Road runner & coyote. You know. All the combinations. Yosamite Sam, and the jedi pimp Pepe le pew (the greatest lover to ever grace the silver screen; and off the screen, nes pa?) Chuck had been cartooning way before his invovlement in WB, he made a few groundbreaking animation pieces before thinking up that wascally wabbit.   Bugs and Daffy were his pet characters. HE once remarked, that Bugs is everything he wanted to be, smart, kind, witty, all around good guy. But Daffy was what he was, arrogant, envious, irritable. In fact he admires that daffy openly embraces his faults and just runs with them.  Chuck also asserts that all of us have a bit of daffy & bugs within us in that regard. Chuck was always a joker; he got his kicks making everyone laugh, and he was good at it too! His goal would always to have everyone laughing, its a good goal. And by watching those cartoons, I think he achieved that goal. Hats off to Chuck. ;)

      My reflection on Looney Tunes, now have lead me to think about other Tv i watched at the time. Some of the best televsion was made in the 80's. and i caught the tail end of it barely. Teenage ninga turtles was a favourite. Yes, another corperate demon, but its one that worked.  one had to admit that the plot was predictable after a while. And theres only some many times one can see shredder get his arse kicked. poor Wang bastard. But indeed April was hot. another Favourite was He-man. Not that new shit. But the old school HEMAN AND THE MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE. The way of the true jedi. i even can remember entire episodes. but there was a similar complex with this one; it just got repeditive. But it was alright for a 6 year old who liked familarity in that fucked world of 1992.   Transformers. Thomas the tank engine! THOMAS! Ringo Starr. Ringo was the life of thomas, he just was; goood. as a result i seem to automatically biased against the other beatles. yeah Lennon! At least ringo didnt get shot you sook! Yoko this *Finger*  i was an avid television watcher, i think i even learnt how to use a VCR at the age of 7. yes, Record too! I grew up on Tv. in london there isnt much esle to do, and i already had a habit when i came here. television was my friend, but i outgrew it. i hardly watch any tv. i feel, that the television now is for another age. the cartoons today, are not like my childhood ones, with the galent hero, or heros. Flash gordon! Batman! Spiderman (though he came later) Superman (i never liked superman) the phantom (he was cool sometimes) X-men! (that came later, 1995 but i think i watched almost all the episodes CABLE HAS MAD SKILLZ) but today's pokemon, digimon etc, are no attraction. theres something sissy about sending an animal to protect you. Fuck off! i prefer a big long sword instead. power of the cards eh Yugio? how about  the power of Erternia!! although Yu-gio is pretty cool. Ruff from Dennis the menace is way cooler than gofuckyourself-mon.  i still follow these craze tv shows and so on, i dont know why, i just seem to have a basic knowledge about them. and thus i can always connect with the young boys. (6-12) cause i can speak their language.   It was an era. an era that resurfaces when the stations dont have the next seasons of the new stuff. and i feel glad that kids fall in love with the same stuff that i did. because then it creates a bridge between generations.

The final orgasm of school was a month ago no one wants pillow talk with Mr Mott. Lets move on.   Uni looks a lot more better, no matter what your doing your free, you are free, cause school is ok if you don't have to come in at 7, don't have to listen to sarge and go to assembly crap. That is uni that is what we want, it is good. Women, the women will clearly be good. Ye. No more rugby, everyone will hopefully grow up, and if they don't they get thrown out,   but not only that, but in a few more weeks we as people will finally have a say, we will soon vote, people older than us will no longer see us as school 'kids' we will be men, Men looking for poon.   freedom! FREEDOM FROM ALL THAT IS SECONDARY WE ENTER A NEW AGE.   NOW WE ARE FREE......

      Computer gamming, my other diversion. I never had much in the way of consoles, only a good old Sega master system (not mega drive mind you). but it was good, i loved shareware, i dont know where i got those games from, friends, or something, cause no internet to download, but i loved games like Wolf3d. Cosmos, duke nukem 1 & 2. and the other arcades. my training in this games allowed me to become competent in most other games, i became a champion in all arcade games, i could just pick it up. i was able to astond people with my knowledge and utilization of Dos. Dos was a true operating system, you had to first be literate to be able to use it limiting computer usage to over 7. so the younger kids acutally when outside and played. not like now you fat ass youths. I soon expanded my gamming exprience. to other games, Mortal kombat, street fighter, Mario all of them. I was good, but not THAT good, some older fellas (14 up) had managed to work out the games systematically, so games like MK & street fighter were out of my league. Enter the button mashing. Ladies let me tell you now Guys who are gammers are always gammers, either they never game or always game; theres no middle ground. guys love to game, it excited everything that is masuculine in a person. Games are a Spacial activity with a sort of ego boosting satisfaction, theres that risky challenge, that danger factor.  And guys love it, cause thats what guys are good at and insinctively like to do; spacial activities, with an ego statisfaction. Sure you can dampen insincts. But, dont be mean. I am a gammer through and through not the best, not the better but a gammer, and im proud i wasted all those hours trying to top my own high score, just because.

      See. I read Catch-22 again. Its a good book. i like books cause they are books. but dfid you know if you type in Nabil-fareed in google you get ONE other result that is not of me:   "Discussing and Modernization and Obstacles facing Engineering Industries in Two Consecutive Meetings    The Engineering Industries Chamber, affiliated to the Federation of Industries, is to hold next Sunday two consecutive meetings, the first with the Industry Modernization Council, the second with the Standard Measurements Authority. Nabil Fareed Hassanein, chairman of the chamber, stated that the first meeting would discuss the priority accorded to engineering industries in the modernization program, whilst the second meeting will revolve around means of reducing maximum cost incurred in order to obtain expiry date certifications and quality standards from the authority. "  Quite the funny one again proving the fact im unique. at least, my name is.

      Mr. Rogers is someone I know; he's been Manslaved by a mrs rogers. he si very nice  to her and buys her things and drives her around and so on. Se continues to reject  him as he tries to be more than friends. Leaving mr. Rogers quite angry and  testy. I don’t like this because mr Rogers are a nice guy and shouldn’t waste his  time and money like that. He's like a boyfriend except he doesn't get any, which  is dumb because why else would bother? Oh mrs Rogers likes him but not in the way  he wants. So Mr Rogers continues to try, while I act as boarish as ever. Sometimes I'm glad people don’t like me.

      For some reason today, I found my self singing an old nursery rhyme.  "Oranges & lemons say the bells of St. Clements. You owe me 5 fathings say the bells of St. martins when will you pay me say the bells of Old Bailey When I grow rich say the bells of Shoredich. When will that be say the bells of Stepney. Im sure i dont know says the great bell at Bow.   Here comes a candle to light you to bed. Here comes a Chopper to chop off your head chip, chop, chip chop. the last man's head..."  There a game to this song, which I cant remember. I can't expect anyone to know this rhyme.. Its all about London church bells...

      Have you ever looked into the mirror and thought either, "damn your one ugly mofo" or "You  Sexy sexy man..."  I tend to do both, mostly the "Sex Machine" look is right after a shower, it seems to have something to do with the water, skin and soap. Otherwise I generally look pretty bad. I guess the best thing to do would be as soon I've had a shower go and hit the clubs. Damn straight.

      Today I saw someone who looked exactly like Danny fish; I knew it wasn't Danny  cause he didn’t walk like Danny, unless it was Danny moping around QUT, walking  funny. I don’t think it was he. I have decided to name this mystery man Stephen  Meet because it doesn't sound like Danny fish, but it’s strangely similar. Maybe  its bizzaro Danny in that case, I better not let them meet otherwise they'll  cancel each other out causing a hole in the space time continuum and causing Kent  to move to another parrel world, which would be bad, since the new Kent is  probably going to be worse than the old one.  I will post if there is any more Stephen Meet sightings.

      Don't you hate it when you love someone, and they don't feel the same way.   I thought you'd be out of my mind  And I'd finally found a way to  Learn to live without you  I thought it was just a matter of time  Till I had a hundred reasons  Not to think about you  But it's just not so  And after all this time  I still can't let go  I've still got your face  Painted on my heart  Scrawled upon my soul  Etched upon my memory baby  I've got your kiss  Still burning on my lips  The touch of my fingertips  Is love so deep inside of me   I was trying everything that I can  To get my heart to forget you  But it just can't seem to  I guess it's just no use  In every part of me  Is still a part of you   I've still got your face  Painted on my heart  Scrawled upon my soul  Etched upon my memory baby  I've got your kiss  Still burning on my lips  The touch of my fingertips  Is love so deep inside of me   I've still got your face  Painted on my heart  Painted on my heart  Painted on my heart   Something in your eyes keeps haunting me  I'm trying to escape you  And I know there ain't no way to  To chase you from my mind   I've still got your face  Painted on my heart  Scrawled upon my soul  Etched upon my memory baby  I've got your kiss  Still burning on my lips  The touch of my fingertips  Is love so deep inside of me, baby   I've still got your face  I've still got your face  painted on my heart  painted on my heart  painted on my heart

      I've been working for sometime on revamping my  webpage as I always am, and you can look at it if you haven't already at  http://eatsoup.freewebpage.org  I'm  really getting quite proud of my webpage now, It's got almost everything a  personal page/blog could have, likes, hates, opinions, bios of the gang, photos  so on and on. I think its cool, and its so easy now, go Macromedia Studio. Go!  email blog to blogger dooby, which is great, cause i can write a pissed off  message, it will save in Outlook and its saved, and its emailed right to my  blog. its so simple! Horaay for everything. Horaay for the new photo sending  thing where I can post up pictures, but I really don't need to...Cause I have my  OWN webpage for that.  The best part is that it was free oop! I better go finish more Bios and get to  around to those quizes & the Things that should shape our world  page.

      We have a large break on Mondays. So somehow we found ourselves at southbank at "Picnic Island" The curse of the black duck? We spent out time here & Jamie, Chris and that other guy showed up. That was fun, I haven't seen Chris for ages. They're from Griffith doing music.   For some reason the girls launched into a lovely conversation about periods and other girl talk before the other fellows got there. So I was the only male with my screaming "WTF!!!"  Kate suggested we make something out of this every Monday.

      Yeah. That on TV just before, and it really wasn't that bad. (By the way, I'm going to totally spoil the plot, I mean come on! The movies almost 7 years old, if you haven't seen it now your not going to.)  Its major problem is that we've seen it all before, and the director knew this. Note in all the other movies someone tells you about the Aliens, like introduces the species, but no such talk we made, we already know! We already know the 'blood' is corrosive, so were not surprised when wheelchair guy gets it on him and it burns!     On the whole the movie sucked but there were a few points that were raised were quite cool, Call, the Robot whose more human than humans was quite cool. And for the first part your thinking, damn she's not bad (Winona Ryder) then when you find out, everyone including you is saying "OH! Yuck Robot Sex!" Also the Newborn Alien has human emotions, which is quite cool, but of course they kill it anyway cause the humans characters are  inhumane.   I think it was this and the lovable characters like Call, The wheelchair guy and guy with Alien foetus. Reminded me of some of the characters from Aliens (2nd one) The "Game Over man, Game over" Guy, he had mad skills.  But something piss me off about the movie, why 200 years in future? Why do the Aliens have corrosive blood? What's the damn point, its meant to circulate nutrients to the cells, what's the point of it burning stuff, and how does the Alien hold the stuff inside it since it eats through a 6 inch block of steel?   Hmmph, stupid Animal diversity lecture. Where he told us next time to pick apart Sci-Fi movies for illogical ideas like that..Hmmpf.

      This week was a special picnic island, because this time we actually had some cool people around and it was almost a party. Today I met Marcus I thought he would be more dweeby, but thankfully he's not.  Jamie, Chris and that other guy were there too. I also met miles on the way back from getting drinks. He used to be a dumbass in school, but now he's doing better which is good, because he works really hard. It was so funny today, more jokes and laughs and the twins started fighting, its like someone arguing with themselves. This was cool I drank so much Soda & ate so heartily, hopefully next week will be like this.

      One of the very few surprises in my household is chocolate. Somewhere or other,  Every now and again, my mother springs on us chocolate and the citizens rejoice,  We practically get the stuff about once a month, sometimes a lot sometimes very  Little. It just makes your day.  The last time (a Friday) I was on MSN and, of course, Kate was too. I got 2  Pieces of white chocolate, so I asked her if she wanted it, which she did, of  Course. So I saved it for her until Monday when I saw her again.  This time (Monday) I got a single piece of brown milk chocolate & asked her if  She wanted it.  {Let me tell you something about Kate, she can't have caffeine, her hearts too weak to cope. } She declined, of course, and I ate it, of course, it just happened to be that  coffee chocolate, Kate loves coffee (probably because she can't have it.) I could  of not said anything after that but I decided to complain the chocolate was that  really sour black chocolate, and didn't taste nice at all, and then blamed her for  not taking it and leaving me to eat such a horrid chocolate. I thought it was a nice thing to do.

      Yar! Today be Picnic Island day, as be last week, and  today was really more of the same as before. A few things to note,  Korn - Shoots Ladders is  good.  Marcus looks like heath ledger  (in my mind a bad thing)  what is it with girls  and toesocks? Are they all mad? I believe so, but then again all guys worship  Super Mario?  Also, um. Oh, let's get  the good stuff out of the way.  Marcus walked Katie to our usual bustop,  and quite frankly being a third wheel sucks ass, I shoulda walked on ahead if i  didn't need to use Kate's bus pass to get home, because mine ran out and im  broke. Well, of course they had a to have a goodby kiss, and of course they did  so blocking up the bus terminal. Kate is about 2 -3 inches shorter than me,  Marcus is 2 -3 inches taller than me, and I'm about 5'8" - 5'9". So they looked  really funny, she has to throw her head back(lookin at ceiling stylings) (I  realised two things at this point 1)Kate has a nice neck, 2) Shorter girls have  an advantage because they always have to look up slightly to make eye  contact, when you look up the flesh around your neck tightens  highlighting the jaw line, which looks hot.) From my angle the whole thing  looked akward, I thought it was because one of them didn't know when to stop, so  you get this feeling like "are we stopping now? no? ok..." But i asked Kate  about whether she felt that way, probably not a question to ask. She didn't, so  i'll just assume one or the other needs more practise. Pfft. Stupid teen love.  Waste of Time.  Picnic Island was fun! Yar! I got to have a drink I'm aclling the Day at the beach, Tomato sauce, Coke, Sherbet & Salt, Lots of Salt. I  forgot something. Oh, I've got an online Physical Science quiz. Meaning i can  sit with the notes in front of me, what the hell? But if they want to give me 5%  free, then cool. Wish my Java Assignment was like that.  For some reason I'm getting  the vibe that girls assume something with us fellas. Sex induendo for one. But  its late and I dont feel like ranting, so ill elaborate some other time. Oh! I've decided to call  people Pooky or Sabo. just for the hell of it. You know, like how you say, mate,  pal, yar, etc. And I'm going to go to a lecture in my Pj's because I can.  Sex Me.

      So we watched the FA cup final at mully's which was good I got introduced to the part of the 'crew' a group of UQ randoms. Go Man U 3 - 0, suck it Millwall! Anyway, after the game we went in Fishy's car (one of the randoms) and trashed a letter boxes & bin ran bins. Bin running is where your in a car and you hold on to a wheely bin and when the car gets some speed you let the bin go free, usually into someone's front yard. I don't know why but I broke about 4 letterboxes that morning. I am now known as Sally.

       urlLink      One thing I've noticed is the amount of people who are part Scottish. Its almost 99% of anglos & its really disconcerting.   How did this happen? Its not like Scotland was like Spain or Italy or Britain with their explorer/imperialism gig. & the amount of people who are fully Scottish are so few!!  Clearly, Scots must have "cross bred" with everyone. They must have had a huge drunken orgy that went on for about 100 years.  Or maybe it was just one Scotsman. One Immortal, Immoral jedi pimp known as SCOTMAN!  "Hello Mr. Scot" *cheesy Porn Music* "I actually needed a handy man, but you'll have to do" *wink* Scotman must have inseminated half of Europe and these half-castes went on to colonize everywhere else, shunned by their community for being bastards.  This explains a lot.  "Scotman is thrusting in the general direction of the new world" This also explains the bastardization of the English Royal Family.  Queen of England: "You said you used protection!" Scotman: "Scotman says a lot of things... Oh Yeah"  When I grow up I want to be just like him. Oh & if you were offended by that, just think of every other ethnic group that's been persecuted. That's right. Shut the hell up.

      Today's Word of wisdom from the bus is  "Are you afraid to die?" Thankfully I'm not.   There has been no more sightings of Stephen Meet of late, It appears that he has caught wind of my operation and skipped town, That or he was only there as a one off thing. Could it have been Danny Fish, we may never know. Maybe its a sign from the Great Simon Penis, BTW the cult site is up, so if you want to see it its there, and there is a random section called the voice, which is just *.WAV files of me saying stuff. I love my Site.

      Could i have picked a worse day to photolog?  nothing happened today! nothing worth taking a photo of! God! My lectures weren't even like real lectures and i hardly saw any of the people i expected to see and stuff. Damn! It failed. But i posted the photos anyway under Tuesday Gallery. So you can look at them, but I'll have to do another, and better one later.   PhotoLog: That is, to document a day's events in photographs.  Anyway, I've decided that although aspects of my life need improvment, I am happy. Strange, I didn't think I'd knock that goal off so early...

      Today being Monday was yet another misadventure at Picnic Island. Arrrh, I was quite the quite the salty seadog, or you could say I was worth my salt, or by the end of it, it seemed I had been asSALTed and battered.  Like last week I drank a most befouling of drinks. last week being coke, sherbert, tomato sauce and salt.  This week being water tomato sauce & about 30 sachets of salt. (I'M TALKING SATURATED SOLUTION HERE PEOPLE!) Well, I drank it. it took my mouth about a second to realize what id done and it didn't like it. Well that wasn't too bad, except for probably the worst after taste I've ever had. But, It took another 6 seconds for it to reach my stomach and for my stomach to realize what I'd just fed it, and it said "FUCK NO! I'm not putting up with this shit, RETURN TO SENDER!"   I was retching for about a half a minute before I vomited in a bin. Chucked up my lunch, chips and the Salt. I feel sorry to those on bin duty today that all I'm going to say. That was cool I haven't puked in ages, and it was a good ?Experience? But for the rest of the after noon everyone avoided me, especially Katie, of course. She was in a very bad mood today and nothing I did could cheer her up. I even got her jellybeans from some guy and jellybeans should perk anyone up but noooooooo!  Oh today Chris, Jamie & that other guy (I found out his actual name is Jim, but its not as cool as "that other guy") & Marcus were present. Marcus bestowed on me the title of General Lobo. Adding to my other nicknames, Blackjack, Khanage, and Sally..... And Chuckie called me a home less person today, owing to my outlandish attempt to stay warm. I got to start studying.  I've realized that when ever I'm hungry, really hungry. I fillup with self pity and depression. Thus, if I'm ever down, I just have to eat something and I'm Perky! Now that I've made this observation I can combat my negativity with "Your Hungry, Shut the Hell up," Aye I know what your saying, "Typical male, the way to a man's heart again is his stomach." And I retort, Why shouldn't it be? I think we complicate issues too much anyway,   This leads to the key to my happiness, Good square meals, Someone to talk to, something nice things to look at (nature, or manmade) and a good solid problem that humanity needs solved, to keep me busy. & just because I'm 17 doesn't mean I don't know what I'm talking about.  That would be cool, life like that.  Oh BTW My website is getting rave reviews, so my site actually become popular! But I doubt it.  "No Salt. NOooooooooooooooooooooooooo Salt" --OfficeSpace  P.s Tomoz will be the Camera project. Lets see what happens.

      I think one way to make money would be to develop a game that Girls  would like to play. There is very little in the market today catering for such a HUGE demographic. Although the nature of this game i've got to figure out. Maybe if i walked around in silletos for a while...  Girls like games like Card games and the Sims. Although, some are wild cards; like my sister who loves the racing game genre and GTA stylings. So, yeah. Must meditate on this.

      I want to recount an evening I spent with Simon. It was friday night, and Simon and I had decided to go out, he had been invited to a Jesus Freak party. and I had been invited to Bennet's 18th. We decided to go to both. We went to the Jesus party first. I find these sort of events uncomfortable, because I'm not one of *them* I don't believe in a ressurection, nor do i believe in the idea of a son of god; basically i don't believe in the 2 cornerstones of the Christian faith. And I go to a party where there is nothing but *them*! If only they knew... See, when they find out that you don't see the world the way they do, they ask why and you have to explain it, and then they try and pickapart your logic which is fine, if there is one or two, but not when there are 20 of them! The best part is they sincerly wish to find out what you think and when they do, they pity you. They call you "Lost!" (Their insufferable self-absorbtion!) I play very defensively to stop this sort of thing from happening and Simon very rarely steps in to help. They ultimately sense something about me, my difference. fat we just have conflicting beliefs but conflicting attitudes.   Anyway, We were only there for a couple of hours. We went off to bennets party, where simon was uncomforatble. Ok, so there was a fair bit of pot but come on. On our way back we stopped off at Mully's where the gang was getting drunk, we watched futurama till 2 am. That was a good friday night. I need all my friday nights like that.

       Where dips the rocky highland Of Sleuth Wood in the lake, There lies a leafy island Where flapping herons wake The drowsy water-rats; There we've hid our faery vats, Full of berries And of reddest stolen cherries. Come away, O human child! To the waters and the wild With a faery, hand in hand, For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand.   Where the wave of moonlight glosses The dim grey sands with light, Far off by furthest Rosses We foot it all the night, Weaving olden dances, Mingling hands and mingling glances Till the moon has taken flight; To and fro we leap And chase the frothy bubbles, While the world is full of troubles And is anxious in its sleep. Come away, O human child! To the waters and the wild With a faery, hand in hand, For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand.  Where the wandering water gushes From the hills above Glen-Car,. In pools among the rushes That scarce could bathe a star, We seek for slumbering trout And whispering in their ears Give them unquiet dreams; Leaning softly out From ferns that drop their tears Over the young streams. Come away, O human child! To to waters and the wild With a faery, hand in hand, For to world's more full of weeping than you can understand.   Away with us he's going, The solemn-eyed: He'll hear no more the lowing Of the calves on the warm hillside Or the kettle on the hob Sing peace into his breast, Or see the brown mice bob Round and round the oatmeal-chest. For be comes, the human child, To the waters and the wild With a faery, hand in hand, from a world more full of weeping than you.  -- William Butler Yeats

      Time has worn on, dear reader. My last post I reported that I would be busy with exams and such. Exams have well and truly over for at least a week and I have not posted once. In order, to keep this site alive I know I have to keep adding and updatig, but I haven't felt the urge. I think it's due to the intensity of my thoughts (or lack there of). But once again I have had sleeping problems and again I turn to my website for aid.   My holidays have been calm and collected. A few get together with friends and such. It appears that this will continue.  As of late i have been focusing my efforts on the Trigun Project and have written 11 Episode summaries with quotes and summary of the contribution of the episdoe to the overall plot. There are 26 episodes in total and I have to write character profiles and throw in any other miscelanous information I can find. That's to set up the site, I then have to affiliate it with as many other Trigun Fan sites as possible. It will be alot of work, but if i finish it it will be the one of the most detailed Trigun fan sites on the internet. For love and peace!  Although I am pleased with the current status of my site in general, and the amount of my visitors, I regret I am unhappy with the lack of comments on this blog itself. I am also unhappy with the forum usage, all members were members of the ceased COA forum; no new blood has joined. Join the forums today and start something! http://coa.ausut.com/forum  I will be diverting my attensions away from the Trigun project temporally, to create more sections in the main site and catch up on Blog entries.

      AFter a very long time I got Simon to have a whack at playing Max Payne 2. I even went so far as to rent out a copy for him. It took us about 2 - 3 sittings to finish it. Its not a very long game, so I would advise to just borrow it, not to buy it. Even Simon liked it, and he's more of a RPG D&amp;D type of guy. Never got on well with the 1st person shooters. I had already finished it on Computer, and he had an Xbox. As such, my skills needed some training, its hard to snipe with that accursed joystick. Before, I was pulling tight ass moves with the mouse using very little ammo, now i had to go for the more trigger happy weapons like the Ingrams or the M1 Carbine. Of course the favourite is the MP5, decent clip size and decent aim, though the Desert Eagle was a fair bit of fun, But make sure you use it in bullet time, since as we all know DEs have a very small magazine size. Don't worry if that didn't make any sense, if it did, i think you'll love this game. The Best part is the story, built in the comic book, film noir feel, a genre that was popular back in the 30's. But the graphics are beautiful, even though the atmosphere is rather bleak and grim, you have to admit it that the realism of the graphics had a certain charm. Let me put it this way, we spent 5 minutes watching Max jump so we could see the realistic waving of his trenchcoat.  Max Restecpa.

      I need a job, because I don't have a life, so i might as well make money on the side too. That way, I can buy stuff I want, like a new keyboard. Or even a Ford LTD, OR even a girlfriend. You heard me. Those are pretty expensive to maintain nowadays, think about it...

      Today was Thursday, on Thursday I have only one lecture for 2 hours, then I go home. That’s nothing cool, what is cool is the amount of people I ran into who I know, and the amount of times I listened to Furious Angels (the album). I ran into Crazy legs, a part of mully’s crew, in my very own IT lecture, he does I @ QUT and I didn’t know this, nor have we seen each other before, strange. We were both under the impression that the other went to UQ. Very WT&F.   To make matters worse, I also ran into Zoe & Miller, Zo &amp; miller, they’re almost inseperable, ZOEMILLER! I even saw Scotty; A high school random. I saw Beeva Huoey’s buddy and even Katie. Which was weird because she definitely had the day off. (Every time I see Kate I’m reminded of those china dolls; You know, the white porcelain ones where if you poke it, it falls over and shatters everywhere. But the difference is when I poked Katie; I got slapped.)  That’s Crazy-Legs, Zomiller, Scotty, Beeva &amp; Katie. That’s 6 people. In the space of 3 hours. Too coincidental for me, I slept with a machete under my bed. Just in case.

      Rob Dougan has been of those unsung music geniuses. He was the mind behind a lot of the most memorable music from the Matrix, (try saying that 5 times fast) including Clubbed to Death, Everyone knows that song, when they hear it.&nbsp;Although, his style of music doesn't really fit into any category. And he can't sing. Seriously. Check him out if you've got nothing else to get off Kaaza. (i do not codone such activities) Anyway, Here's the lryics to  There's Only Me,  off the  Furious Angels  Album. &nbsp; You're all I want   You're all I need   You're all I've gotAll I see  It won't be long   'Til suddenly   You'll find he's gone   And you'll turn around and see There's only me   For whom there's silence in your heart   There's only me   Waiting patient to the last   You wait and see   One day your love will surely start   You'll turn around   You'll find when everyone departs, there's only me You walk in the room   You take you seat   You don't turn around   You don't see me    I'll make him    goYou'll find one day he'll disappear   You'll turn around   And find that not a soul is here  There's only me    Only me there's only me you wait and see    you'll turn around you'll find when everyone departs    there's only me

(alot) Hopefully I can get CowBoy Bebop off Timmy, OMG TiImmy is not on the People I know Page! How could I forget him?

      It's not that I don't like System of a Down, It's just that they're lyrics doesn't make a single ounce of sense. I'm kinda over the teen-anger I'm 16 i hate my father syndrome. I'm a bit too old for that. But then again, the next level is the DINK (Double income no kids) catergories, who think theyre so cool because they hang out in swanky resturants and have swanky flats. It's always Swanky with them, Swanky Wanky Wankers.

         I love this stuff. I'm pursuing a career in it. It appears chocolate is more doped up than Kent last Friday night. After a quick perusal of the net. I found a few properties of chocolate.  It stimulates hormones that would usually be triggered by rubbishy hormones like Love & romance, and the twisted female intereptation of sex.  It also has magnsium and some other ions that ladies love, and require a shitload of (thanks to our friend Menstruation)  It also contains more drugs than bennett's bloodstream, most noteably; Anandamide. A toned down version of Weed. The protein in question binds to the same THC-Receptors. In other words. Chocolate is a very week version of pot.  its also got N-oleoylethanolamine and N-linoleoylethanolamine (triggers production of more Anandamine) caffeine, theobromine (related to caffeine) tyramine (An anti-depressant) &amp; phenylethylamine (I think thats a rip-off of adrenline)  Not that i have anything against Chocolate. But i do have something against dependancy on anything other than yourself. Just cause it's legal doens't mean its right. and visa versa
