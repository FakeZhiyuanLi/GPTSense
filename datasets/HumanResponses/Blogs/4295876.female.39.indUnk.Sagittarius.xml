      I learned the phrase Yippy Skippy from a wonderful online friend, Sunni. It seems to sum up things in life a little more positively than "whatever".  Next time you want to buy something and have no money or something bad happens to you just say Yippy Skippy and don't let it stress you out.  I'm sitting here laughing because I could say Yippy Skippy a hundred times and I would still stress out. I'm the queen of stress. I have to admit I don't hang on to the stress as long as I use too. Some one hit my car in a parking lot the other day and totally smashed my drivers side door. Normally I would stress over it for weeks. This time I let it go in three days. That's a world record for me. I stress about everything it seems. My weight, my job, my marriage, money(especially money as in the lack of), and all sorts of everyday things. I even stress out wondering if my dog is happy lol.  I love blogging because it let's you type out all your thoughts and frustrations. You get to really vent and sometimes you will find you are not alone because some one will comment on how they feel the same way. I doubt there is anything that you can go through that some one else some where in the world hasn't gone through the same thing.  Comedians know this....the good ones anyway. They can take everyday stuff that happens to just about everyone and make us laugh at the situation or ourselves. Laughter is very therapeutic. (I'm going to spell check my blog but if you could see how I spelt this word the first time you would be laughing.  My husband is a bit more laid back than I am. I don't think he worries as much because I worry enough for the both of us. I'm sure sometimes I stress him out with worrying though. I try to be more like him in some ways. I try to be a little more laid back. I think he isn't quite as laid back sometimes as he pretends though. I think he does it just to help me.  Warren is a very special person. He's a good man and I'm the luckiest woman in the world to be married to him. This isn't to say he's perfect. None of us are. He's perfect for me. Not every woman would think being married to him is the greatest thing in the world. Our marriage works because we love each other. He has his faults and I have mine but we some how make them work together. When we first got married we fought a lot. We still fight now but not as often. We've learned each others moods. We've learned how to deal with them. Sometimes I want to hit him over the head with a baseball bat. I'm sure there are many times he wishes he could do the same to me. I'm just lucky he puts up with me and loves me as much as he does. We've been married for four years now and to spend one night apart from each other drives us both crazy. He's my soul mate and I could not imagine life without him.  I promise not to make my blog all mushy about my hubby and how much I love him. Though I'm sure you will see him mentioned many times.  Right now I'm half asleep. It's around a quarter to 12AM. We were watching "The Exorcist" and I fell asleep in the middle of it. lol I think I'm away to bed. I just wanted to get my blog started so if someone clicked on my web site it wouldn't be blank or have my hubby's test blog he did for me. (Test Fart lol)  So this is the start of my blog.  Yippy Skippy!!
