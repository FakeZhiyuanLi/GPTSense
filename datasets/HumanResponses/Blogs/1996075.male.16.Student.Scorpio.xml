       Blah okay i'm going insane...hooray for michael. he rocks. as for the rest of you...bad people. need to start posting things. Yeah anyway, i got like three hours of sleep last night becuase i started watching armageddon for some unknown reason and just  yeah...couldn't fall asleep. I've been told by a lot of people that whenever i seriously lack sleep i just get like...crazy and scary and all those things. Just beyond tired i guess. Definitely at that point now. So instead of actually paying attention in Bible, i'm posting on here, as usual. Can't possibly pay attention in here. Our teacher tells us to share notes with each other so yeah...whats the point. But i am going to do well in all my classes this year...i'm determined. I so took out lisa and sarah in french today on our quiz. Anyway, yeah this is just a bunch of useless rambling but thats okay. Almost time to go home...yay  rar ~Christy

       yayrah for michael! first person besides me/christy to post on here! ok, yeah, i am definitely not going to get a lot of sleep tonight (technically, its already monday) - I AM SOOOOO BEHIND ON MY HISTORY PROJECT AND I AM WORKING MY ASS OFF RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE I REALLLLY NEED TO! right now im just taking a little break because even when working your ass off, you need breaks, so i decided to post...me padre just went to bed so no worries about getting caught or anything, which is good...blar, im gonna be so dead/out-of-it tomorrow (today? whatever...) my goal is definitely to do my best in every class (esp history though) - sorry guys, but from now on im not gonna lie to my parents just so i can go to a movie or hang out or something...its just not gonna happen...i REALLY need to do my best at CLS to stay there, cause the only way i CAN stay there is with financial aid, meaning that if i start flunking when i know i can pass, im OUTTA THERE! which wouldnt be good, cause then id either be going to phs (UGHHHH) or east (well only one good thing about that - id be going to the same school as alex, but thats it) so definitely gonna be a good girl this year (*crossing fingers*)...so yeah, williams wrist is broken! so sad! i finally get to see him tomorrow after like forever of not seeing him (well not really, but whatever)...and yeah my "flavor of the week" HAHA lol is going just dandy...his nickname is CRAB (initials CRB and yes hes a freshman lol...sorry alex i know u hate them...lol) but i bet hes gonna be gone from my mind (at least in that way) pretty soon...cause thats just how i am, as u all so very well know...anyway, back to sputnikness/space race-ness/HISTORY RESEARCHNESS!! I LOVE YOU ALL!!! moo ~ lauren

       I have finally worked up the "Patience" to come up with a username again. And i like it. And i have noticed that no one has posted in a few days. BAD PEOPLE! Anyways. Fencing tourney today was fun (1st and 3rd, woohoo!), and tommorrow should be better too. yah! and i might get to see leia. i hope i do. yeah. I am so not looking forward to school monday. I have roughly barely any time to work on my history project and so for the next few hours it will be all fencing eating and historing.

       Blah Bible class...lots of fun. I'm so bored right now. College fair tonight! lots of fun. everybody needs to come. Sure, its kinda useless becuase all you do is get info about different colleges which you could easily get online but thats okay, it's a good excuse for us all to hang out on a school night for two hours. So yeah, be there. You know you wanna see me.   Yup, movie last night was very cool. Me and lauren have this bad habit of acting like we're drunk all the time. That always gets interesting. Think we definitely scared some people. But what kind of night is it if we don't scare anyone, anyway?   Okay, some other people need to start writing stuff in here...me and lauren are totally going to end up having conversations on here if you don't. Dumdedum...anyway guess i should actually pay attention...or start sending random people e-mails. The two are entirely interchangeable at this point.   Rar unto all

       I'm thinking this weekend is going to be pretty short, or rather feel that way since all of them really are short.  I just want to say that Quizilla is so much fun.  I have taken numerous amounts of quizi (lol) and here are the results I have gotten (some of them are kind of funny) :  "Are you weird?" - Results:  You are a very unique individual. You perceive things unlike many others do. You find beauty in the essence of yourself and the things people often take for granted. You are very intelligent and you see the whole picture. You do have the tendency to become a bit shy, but not because you lack the social skills. Just because your such a deep thinker and intellectual and you find it as a conflicting factor in your life for you to easily relate to others. You value your alone time and find it a priority to seek out knowledge to strengthen your foundation of what you truly believe in. You are a very special person, don't let anyone contradict that.   "Will you fall in love? (for girls)" - Results: Yes you will fall in love!!! You love being with people and you are ready to find the right someone, or u found them! Your sweet and guys always like you and being around you!    "What holiday are you?" - Results: You're Halloween, The scariest holiday of the year, you love to scare people, dress up and eat candy.   "which of my friends or me are you ;boys and girls;" - Results:  Congrats!!! You are Me! Youâ€™re also called Carly, and sometimes baby but only by Brian! Your favorite color is of course pink, and well you just love your friends completely, seriously, congrats, they say youâ€™re special!   "What Goddess Are You?" - Results: Athena: Smart, disciplined, and wise, you also have a sarcastic sense of humor that shows people that you can see right through them. Tough and independent, you can deal with many situations with your quick thinking and sharp wit. People like you become successful- lazy people drive you insane--so pack your bags and head out!   "What water sport should you play (in the pool)?" - Results: You're a synchronized swimmer! (my personal favorite) Why swim when you can synch?   "Which Teen Girl Squad member are you?" - Results:  You are cheerleader! You like boys! A lot! And some don't like you! Very Much! At all!   "Which Band is your personality most like?" - Results: Incubus   "Which of the Seven Deadly Sins are you?" - Results: Envy   "What is your stereotype?" - Results: emo.kidd! It's not a bad thing...you like the greatest music...and not just things like Dashboard and Further seems forever. You probably also like Finch, Senses Fail, Afi and all that good stuff!   "What type of dog are you? " - Results: You're a Golden Retriever. The beginner's dog, there's no one that doesn't like you. Sure, you shed... you take a bit of extra grooming, but what you lose in hairballs and brush fibers, you make up for in loyalty and friendliness. You're easy to train, adapt easily to new situations, and don't drool much.    "which of my insane frineds are you? (boys and girls)" - Results: You are Holli. Red hair, green eyes, and a personality to boot. You certainly are a catch for any guy. You are hyper and fond of swearing without fear. You are one of my closest friends, and i love you with all my heart. Personal quote: "anti homecoming party at the marry-go-round!"   "What sport would you be best at" - Results: You are a sophisticated person who knows what a real sport is So go play some good ole football (soccer to you american beer guzzling pigs).    "Which random object are you?" - Results:  You're a q-tip... sorry.   "What Color Represents You?" - Results: Yellow! You are a sunny person, in that you make everyone happy. Sometimes people take advantage of you, but you are a good friend and an overall good person!   "*what random object describes your life?*" - Results: You are a stapler. I don't know why, but thatâ€™s what you are. A stapler!   "What kind of person are you?" - Results: your sex life matters the most to you, as long as your with someone you are pleasured by, your very opened to new things  Damnit the pictures didn't copy with the rest of the results! Oh well...if you want to see the pictures, just e-mail me for them.  Monday ....................................................................................  493 INSIDE JOKES now, I believe...that's exciting, huh...oh yes I sound oh so wonderfully excited about that!  moo ~ lauren

       This is sad... I'm PG. And it'll never get any different. At least, not anytime soon. Homecoming was awesome. Everyone looked great. Not saying who looked the best, but it was Sabina. So I guess I am saying. Coolest dress other than that was Lauren's cool green one.  I don't make an animal sound ~Daniel~

       My life isn't PG nor will it ever be...i can't handle that. Unless i was going on an adventure to find nemo of course...then it might be PG. but thats an awesome PG movie so thats okay. Anyway, yeah didn't get much sleep last night...thinking about other things, just like i have been all day today too. I'm so out of it and just all-around insane. Homecoming was AWESOME. Definitely a weekend to remember. Knowing me i'll probably post more about it later, and so will lauren but yeah back to e-mail. This class is so useless...  rAr ~Christy (a.k.a Lickit)

       Okay, you guys officially suck! I most certainly am NOT a fairy princess! Well, at 'least not as far as you guys know. (Damnit, they know my horrible secret)   And because you guys asked for it, it's the RANDOM AARON SORKIN QUOTE OF THE MINUTE!  "What are you, nuts? Are you just some... nutty-nut girl who's nuts?" -- Dan Rydell  (Sports Night)   Gee, wonder who THAT could be talking about?   Do you guys know who Philo Farnsworth was?  He invented television.  I don't mean he invented television like Uncle Milty, I mean he invented the television. In a little house in Provo, Utah.  At a time when the idea of transmitting moving pictures through the air would be like me saying I've figured out a way to beam us aboard the Starship Enterprise. He was a visionary and he died broke and without fanfare.  The guy I really like though was his brother-in-law, Cliff Gardner.  He said to Philo, "I know everyone thinks you're crazy, but I want to be a part of this.  I don't have your head for science, so I'm not gonna be much help with the design and mechanics of the invention.  But it sounds like in order to do your  testing, you're gonna need glass tubes." See Philo was inventing a cathode receptor, and even though Cliff didn't know what that meant or how it worked, he'd seen Philo's drawing and he knew they were gonna need glass tubes and since television hadn't been invented yet, it's not like you could get 'em at the local TV repair shop. "I want to be a part of this", Cliff said, "and I don't have your head for science.  How would it be if I taught myself to be a glassblower?  And I could set up a little shop in the  backyard. And I could make all the tubes you'll need for testing." There oughta be Congressional medals for people like that!   Everybody's favorite lawnboy, Brandon

       Ladies and gentlemen, the apocalypse is officially on its way! I made plans for homecoming, actual knew that I was going to the dance over a week before, and was actually going with someone. Once she said yes, I looked up into the sky and saw Death riding on his horse, Binky, across the sky.   And now, it's time for the RANDOM AARON SORKIN QUOTE OF THE MINUTE!  "You shouldn't think that just because I'm looking at you while you're talking to me, that I'm necessarily listening to or caring about what you're saying. It's just something I do to be polite.

       I have posted again, unlike some slackers! Maybe if they posted their 5k time would drop? maybe?  Well, hey there, hi there, ho there,  Alas, the long weekend is over, but we have the next normal weekend to look forward to! Yeah, finally. Power ties to the max! hackage to the mackage! anyways, Some people need to pick up their posting. No one likes bagels and breadsticks posts (0 and 1 for the intelligent ones out there). And lauren: if you did forensics you might not stutter! and if someone else who doesnt post joined they might be adept at debating/arguing. and up to date on current events.

       HAHAHAHA!! wow, this night has definitely changed from being a not-so-fun night to a totally AWESOME night...WOW!!  ok, so i call him, and his dad answers and hes like "hello this is lance becker speaking", ok, here: mr b - "hello this is lance becker speaking" me - "hello is 'CrCl' there?" mr b - "um hes at kyles house right now, may i take a message?" me - "sure thats fine" mr b - "who is this?" me - "lauren, summerville....i go to charlotte latin" mr b - "charlotte latin? ok...do u want him to call u back?" me - "thats fine" mr b - "what time is the latest for u?" me - "um, probably about 9:30" mr b - "im not expecting him back from kyles until after 10, so how about in the morning?" me - "sure" mr b - "l-a-u-r-e-n?" me - "yes" mr b - "s-u-m-m-..." me - "e-r-" mr b - "v-i-l-l-e?" me - "yes" mr b - "and whats your number?" me - "7048472383" mr b - "alright, well he has a clarinet lesson at 10 in the morning, so before or after?" me - "um, after" mr b - "ok, well, ill have him call u" me - "ok, thanks" mr b - "sure, bye" me - "bye"  ok some of that isnt quite accurate (he and i said some other stuff...but thats the gist) considering im doing this from memory, but i have never called someone and when their mom/dad answers, they ask that many questions! wow that was GREAT! lol...definitely lightened up my mood for the evening...and im glad i called too...now hes probably going to call tomorrow morning when im still asleep...but maybe not, whatever...lol...if he does call when im asleep my parents are gonna be like "dude, who is this guy, and why did lauren call him?" haha...thats gonna be great if that happens, ok,...im a happy person again! lol  moo ~ lauren

       13 paged notes...they dont seem that long, they LOOK long, but appearances can be deceiving because ive read and reread this certain 13 paged note a lot now...and it is definitely not that long...but maybe im just a fast reader...and i definitely keep thinking that hes gotten it, but NO HE HASNT! lol, because fall break isnt over yet, so i havent had a chance to give it to him, being why he hasnt gotten it yet...but if things dont work out (im kind of assuming they wont, but you never know) i totally want to be friends with him because he is really a cool person and would (as far as i can tell) be an awesome friend for me...but the only problem with that is that i cant stalk him anymore...and stalking is fun! lol...maybe i could do it in secret lol...that could be interesting...random notes in peoples lockers have gotten interesting consequences before (christy...lol)...im gonna try and not be obsessive anymore, because im tired of it, and i cant see how susanna isnt tired of being obsessive over kiko for this long time!    last night was great fun...with michael and christy at the playground in stonecrest...hehehe...lots of innuendoes last night...we have such dirty minds.    my hip hurts...stupid hip, well at least it was a volleyball related "injury"...my bruised hand wasnt, but its actually totally better, so its all good...  this week is gonna rock...i get to see christy again for 2 days in a row (cant do the sleepover though, dernit) like yesterday and the day before, plus i get to see leia, plus i get to see certain people all dressed up, and the list just goes on and on......  i look special today...and thats all you need to know, lol, jk...  christy gets out of school in 15 minutes! thats exciting! maybe she'll call...i doubt it though, since im pretty sure that alex is picking her up from school...and all that jazz  i need to draw more in my sketch book  i feel like i need to keep writing...but its just not coming, so i think im gonna stop now  MOOOOOOO ~ LAUREN

       This weekend is definitely a godsend. Without the god part of course. So its just a send. Anyways, onto the content:  Saturday was definitely a good day - 20:13 5K race time (another new pr!), LOTS OF SLEEP, got to play Max Payne for more than just a few minutes, and other stuff i cant think of right now. Only way it could have been better were if i had remembered to watch SNL. I wish i could remember who was hosting...hmmm...  Yeah. In other news the forensics team kicks ass. Novices dominating the JV tournament!  I still have daniels food, although he will probably get alot of it back wednesday. But the mentos are all gone. arg.  How 'bout them mets? they dont matter How 'bout them A's? They really screwed up the 6th inning. If anyone knows what happened they must be laughing along with me. utter hilarity and stupidity on the part of the A's.   -Mikeo   "Life does not cease to be funny when people die any more than it ceases to be serious when people laugh."  -George Bernard Shaw

       Good God, Barny's "psycho-analyses" are getting creepily accurate. I don't think I'm actually talking to Barny, but really to the resurrected spirit of Dr. Freud who's telling me shit about myself I knew but didn't know at the same time because it was in my subconcious or something like that.

       ok, tonight was awesome, not only did we kick bishop mcguiness's ("the villains") butts, but i finally talked to chromium chloride (CrCl, hehe) !  thats his new nickname...but yeah the convos went something like this (after the game was over) :  me (but saying his real name of course) - "CrCl! CrCl! CrCl!" CrCl (after finally hearing me, turning around) me - "im assuming you got my note?" CrCl - "what?" me - "in your locker..." CrCl - "yeah, yeah"  and  me - "another question: youre not like scared out of your wits are you? CrCl - "nah" me - "ok good, cause i tend to get kinda crazy sometimes" *CrCl kinda shaking his head no this whole convo*  ok so theyre short convos!! give me a break! lol...im so glad hes in my first period, its the best class! haha...and then hes usually out there in the gaz-i-bo, lol, during my lunch, and i see him throughout the day at random spots, its great fun, i have "CrCl radar", as me and susanna like to call it, hehehe...once when me and christy (tonight) were walking around the track we passed him and his friends and he just randomly started doing pushups and looked up and did this cute little smile as we walked right by him; we thought he was showing off...turns out he was doing them because we had just gotten (another) touchdown haha...that was great...and i definitely like stared at him the whole frickin time, and he stared back some times...talking to him was the best part though...*sigh* HAHAHA...woooo! im ok, not really, but thats ok!  football game tonight, besides the "CrCl" issue, lol, was totally awesome...me and christys drunkeness haha, falling so much! woo! definitely blood from that! lol...too much blood lately, fingers, hip...BLAR!  oh definitely colored jeans today! that was fun! yayrah for coloring jeans! ok...wrapping up this entry now...i think...im way too tired to go on, hope u had fun reading it!

       WOW HAHAHA - perhaps my most WRONG result ever!! lol...ok, first of all...heres what the ONLY question was:  Will you be a Happy Adult??  For high school aged persons... or those who want to just goof a bit...  You are a member of what groups or activities?   Band     Sports club (Basketball, Football, Track, whatever)     Cheerleader     Science Chess, or Computer Club     Newspaper or Year Book Staff     Nothing... you just want to be left alone.     (Be patient, it may take a few seconds before your browser reacts)   and you could choose more than one answer, and so i chose the first two obviously, so heres what i got (SUCH a joke!) :  "Will you be a Happy Adult??" - Results:  You will be a miserable, neurotic, whiner of an Adult!~! You are a Preppy Jock/Skank Bitch who makes the lives of those who do their own thing miserable in a lousy attempt to make yourself feel bigger. Grow up and get a life!! Just because you are pretty/handsome and popular, with Daddy's money to get you the coolest styles and fast car doesn't mean you are the shit. You are an asshole. Accept it, and now change it. High School is nothing in the greater scheme of life, and once you graduate, you won't be the same "Popular" person you are now. Real life isn't about gossip, styles, nice cars, and money. It's about being kind to one another, accepting responsibility for all your screw ups, working your ass off to pay the bills, and wondering if you'll be able to make rent next month because you might be "downsized" or how to pay for the braces your kids need. And I don't care HOW much Bling Daddy's got... he won't bail you out for ever.    how off is that? i mean, come on! lol...wow...the world these days...  LOVE YOU ALL!! *blows hugs and kisses* moo ~ lauren

       yes happy birthday to me...feels weird to say that im 16...and so (for now anyways) i am 3 years older than danny (bday dec 5) and 2 years older than craig (bday july 9)...wow.  yeah the night didnt start out too great for me...throwing up on your birthday sucks...lemme tell you that now...so needless to say, i didnt go to practice (considering that its going on right now, down at good ol' uncc).  yeah so its been a pretty emotional night for me - i think me being too emotional caused the throwing up because i realllllly didnt want to go to vball practice because i was so tired (like yawning every 5 minutes) and so when i woke up to my dad saying "you are going to volleyball practice" i got kind of pissed (probably cause i was so tired - short temper when im tired lol) and when i was crying i looked in the mirror and my face was red as hell...it was scary.  and then i started gagging, most likely from crying too hard...so then when my dad heard me gagging he was like "go in the bathroom if youre gonna throw-up" so yeah then i went to the bathroom and threw up in the toilet - which is definitely always the most fun you can have the night of your birthday.  other than that, it hasnt been bad...  got 2 more presents today - flowers from my aunt and uncle in maryland and hilary duffs cd metamorphosis...quite exciting  so yeah happy birthday to evo tomorrow! hope your foot heals quickly!

       I've tried to get you off my mind, I've tried to play my part, But everytime I close my eyes, You're still inside my heart, Why can't I laugh? Why must I cry? Everytime we say good-bye, Why does it rain, Here in my heart, Everyday that we're apart, Why can't it be, Just you and me, What will it take to make you see...  Like the stars in the sky, You still keep on shining down you're light on me, But out of reach, And I know that in time, You will come back to your senses,  See the signs, And change your mind, I try to look the other way, And keep my heart on hold,  But everytime I'm close to you, I lose my self-control, Why can't I laugh? Why must I cry? Everytime we say good-bye, Why does it rain, Here in my heart,  Everyday that we're apart, Why can't it be, Just you and me, What will it take to make you see, Why can't I laugh? Why must i cry? Give me just one good reason why... Why does it rain Here in my heart, Everyday that we're apart, Why can't it be, Just you and me, What will it take to make you see...  great song, although i know a lot of others would disagree...like christy...and alex...and pretty much everyone...what can i say? i have a unique musical attraction...lol I LOVE YOU SWEETUMS...AND EVERYBODY ELSE TOO! moo ~ lauren

       Thats good news - I guess no more extremely hard long physical practices. Sounded like track for a bit there. (intro fin.) (insert transition). I've noticed that my entries all follow the same general format. Comment on one before it. Say my deal. Close with some odd insight. Why break with it. Anyway, I keep remembering the existence of this thing, so i figured I might as well contribute. Yeah. OM is turning up, Leia is over, and things have gotten alot simpler. On top of that, there is a snow day, meaning no school or forensics tournament, meaning that I can go to the play  and  work on OM all weekend. And it was good.  -Mikeo  Mel Gibson's father needs to realize bad things can happen, and that they have. Mel Gibson's movie sounds good - hope i get a chance to go

I really couldn't care less right now - and if that sounds mean, it's not meant to...at this point, I'm just trying to figure out what I want to do, and I just feel like I should decide alone and you'll know if I want you're opinion on it

       im happy yet not...gahhh life is so fun, especially on rainy dreary days! although i do think i am more happy than not, just kind of thinking through a lot of stuff in my head right now - its not exactly confusion...not really at all, just thinking really hard...the pollen doesnt help either, although the rain today will probably clear that up a little bit...ok im gonna go back and try and find someone who i can hang out with before break is over...sounds so sad doesnt it...

       It looks like the fun has up and run away  Too scared to hold, and now too scared to break  We've put our roots down here but  There's a feeling I can't shake  Anticipating your next move  I can't get comfortable with you  And I try to weigh it out  We've nothing, everything to lose  You can't stand me, I'm sick of you  And what is this thing turning into?   And how can we hope for no hard feelings?  We built this together and now we're pulling down together  From different sides of the room  And when this is gone  What else are we gonna do?   We've gotten good at eye contact  While regurgitating lies  Learn to swallow hard so we won't cry  It's been so long since we laughed at the same things  The joke is on me and you  fuck everything  I wonder who will be the first to quit

       it's a terrible thing to need and not be needed, to be needed and not wanted, to be vital and disposed, to give and be blind to giving, to find the walls and no door; though worse still when the door must be opened. it is a terrible thing to lose oneself and worse when others cannot find you. the past is a terrible thing, the doors of probability closed. yet more than these it is a terrible thing to look only at the darkness at night. and the damned shackles need loops. i feel the chains unforged and yet real which bind me

       since when did michael become so poetic? unless of course those are lyrics...whatever...life is so special...especially right now...thats all i have to say...none of you ever want to be inside my brain...many a thing happens there, and its notsomuch fun sometimes (especially right now) - so be glad for your sake that telepathy is not possible...or whatever...grr my throat hurts...i hate planes..im actually happy to go to school tomorrow though - and VBALL IS OVER! yaaay...byeness complexus dans et oscula sufflationes ~mOoLaU~ im done here...for today anyway. I CAN ONLY CONTROL MY ACTIONS BASED ON THE WAY I FEEL...i should remember that...thanks christy...even though i already knew it, people forget things they already know a lot of the time - prime example: school

       civil is hardly biting with politeness gone askew. To thee and those do dreams flock trailing wishes in tow. The control has not the powet but what is granted by the master and the minion. THe world is always brave, and the only way to be lost is to be found, for the rope can only tether, no bind. A fire is never dark, it is only the environs which may make it seem as such, for fire is always the master of light, not destroying, but changing.  -mikeo   "She just ran off, leaving her temple in ruins!"

       civil blades biting politness why this duel we prolong? she is gone to me why to me does she come with wishes to go away? if one feels controlled why returns the controlee when "controller" has left them be? what brave new world this be with such women in it? she cries "loose me" i have not the rope, why does she not take her freedom and let me be? run, run far away my immortal and never look back, i am the dark fire; too close to my darkness and yourself you will destroy

       wow...long day at school.  14 hours pretty much does it-- I don't think i could stand much more.  hey william, how late did you end up staying? I know you were still painting when I left at 10 and there was more to be done... Horray doing homework after midnight (not)  I hope i don't make this a habit (wasn't it wednesday night last week too?? seems like so long ago).  well the show is going much better now, the set is almost finished and my lights are done (finally!!)  I'll be so glad when this is over (not that I don't enjoy it, but sometimes its frustrating and tiring). hope ya'll come see the show 7:30 tomorrow (well technically today) and friday!

       for some reason this song is running through my head (i dont even remember when i heard it last...good song though)...dont worry im not at all anywhere near applying these lyrics to my life, i just like them:  And I'm staring down the barrel of a 45, Swimming through the ashes of another life No real reason to accept the way things have changed Staring down the barrel of a 45  hooray shinedown! ~mOoLaU~  i hope that today will be as awesome as yesterday was...man monday was the best day ive had in such a long time, its crazy...but it was soooo fun!! especially lunch...people dont have good aim these days lol...and that includes me, considering i was like 2 inches (if not less) away from "the target" and i missed! lol

       i know, and hence the comparison to hobbes. he said life was nasty brutish and short, but also advocated a strong central ruler as able to take charge of life and preserve the common man. life was bad, but a strong central leader can overcome that he argued. i'm saying it's more like locke. life is intrinsically good. we screw it up, complicate it, and confuse ourselves to death, but there are moments in there that are just so surreally good, moments where you feel so indeniably alive, moments where no one on earth can't say that, just for an instant, everything was worth it. hell, we live in those moments. either during them, or thinking of them. dreams, memories, those times where you just zone out and mentally go to another place and time are people trying to relive those moments. life is incredibly beautiful, awesome and scary. it's like trying to hold a supernova in your hand and being vaporized, turned into dust and energy cascading on the expanding exploding wavefront of the nova. 'cept most of our time on earth is spent existing, getting by; not living

       i think that life is a deceiving little bitch that is always confusing but chooses to hide the confusion (to confuse us even more as to why its not there) until at the worst times and it just pops out and says "hello!" all cheerful and everything but its really a "cold hard bitch" (jet) that no one wants, but is necessary to live with because we would get nowhere without it - no lessons learned, or stuff like that...so theres my analysis lol

       well...about 2 and a half hours of studying history...would have been a lot less fun (and helpful) if it had been solo though - so thank you michael!   I'm gonna fight em' off.  A seven nation army couldn't hold me back.  They're gonna rip it off.  Takin' their time right behind my back.  And I'm talkin to myself at night, bcause I cant forget.  Back and forth through my mind behind a cigarette   And a message come from my eyes, says leave it alone.   Dont wanna hear about it.  Every single ones got a story to tell.  Everyone knows about it.  From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell.  And if I catch you comin back my way, I'm gonna serve it to you.  And that aiin't what you want to hear, but thats what I'll do.   And a feelin' comin from my bones, says find a home.   Im goin' to Witchita.  Far from this opera forever more.  Im gonna work the straw.  Make the sweat drip out of every pore.  And I'm bleedin' and I'm bleedin' and Im bleedin' right before my lord.  All the words are gonna bleed from me, and I will think no more.   And the stains comin from my blood, tell me go back home   i made a decision yay... :) ...hooray (eventual) decisiveness  ~mOoLaU~

       How does it feel to be One of the beautiful people? Now that you know who you are What do you want to be? And have you travelled very far? Far as the eye can see. How does it feel to be One of the beautiful people? How often have you been there? Often enough to know. What did you see, when you were there? Nothing that doesn't show. Baby you're a rich man, Baby you're a rich man, Baby you're a rich man too. You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo. What a thing to do. Baby you're a rich man, Baby you're a rich man, Baby you're a rich man too. How does it feel to be One of the beautiful people? Tuned to A natural E Happy to be that way. Now that you've found another key What are you going to play? Baby you're a rich man, Baby you're a rich man, Baby you're a rich man too. You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo. What a thing to do. Baby you're a rich man...

       Cut my life into pieces  This is my last resort  Suffocation  No breathing  Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm, bleeding   This is my last resort   Cut my life into pieces  I’ve reached my last resort  Suffocation  No breathing  Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm, bleeding  Do you even care if I die bleeding?  Would it be wrong?  Would it be right?  If I took my life tonight  Chances are that I might  Mutilation outta sight  And I’m contemplating suicide!   Cuz I’m losing my sight  Losing my mind  Wish somebody would tell me I’m fine  Losing my sight  Losing my mind  Wish somebody would tell me I’m fine   I never realized I was spread too thin  Till it was too late  And I was empty within  Hungry!  Feeding on chaos  And living in sin  Downward spiral where do I begin?  It all started when I lost my mother  No love for myself  And no love for another.  Searching to find a love up on a higher level  Finding nothing but questions and devils   Cuz I’m losing my sight  Losing my mind  Wish somebody would tell me in fine  Losing my sight  Losing my mind  Wish somebody would tell me I’m fine  Nothing's alright  Nothing is fine  I’m running and I’m crying  I’m crying  I'm crying  I'm crying  I'm crying   I can't go on living this way   Cut my life into pieces  This is my last resort  Suffocation  No breathing  Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm, bleeding!  Would it be wrong?  Would it be right?  If I took my life tonight  Chances are that I might  Mutilation outta sight  And I’m contemplating suicide   Cuz I’m losing my sight  Losing my mind  Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine  Losing my sight  Losing my mind  Wish somebody would tell me I’m fine  Nothing’s alright  Nothing is fine  I’m running and I’m crying   I can’t go on living this way  Can’t go on  Living this way  Nothing’s alright   ooohhh lovely song eh? lol...i like it, but i didnt know it was about suicide haha...oooops =D

Even youths grow tired and weary,  and young men stumble and fall;  but those who hope in the Lord  will renew their strength.  They will soar on wings like eagles;  they will run and not grow weary,  they will walk and not be faint.  Isaiah 40:29-31

       I've got nationals from the third until the 11th (plus I'm supposed to help set up on the 2nd). If Im not fencing, I'll be helping in the afternoons - schedule is as follows:   2-3 : help out with stuff in the afternoons  4th : helping in the afternoon, but with any luck it wont be the Div III foil day and the tournament wont last until 8 pm  5 : U-19 Men's Sabre  6 : U-19 Men's Team Sabre  7 : Div II Men's Sabre  8-9 : help in the afternoon  10 : Senior Team Men's Sabre     Div III Men's Foil  11 : Help break down venue  Okay - just checked for the fourth and all the events are team or age restricted...meaning they should be relatively small...hooray!  And you guys are welcome to come to some of the events if you want - just ask me about times and all  -mikeo  "Those who live by the sword, die by the sword"

       Its been a while since I've posted, and just as long since I've seen the light of day. Well, maybe not that long, but just consider the fact that I'm posting at 2:35 in the am, and it has been completely overcast for two days now...you get the idea...  Anywho, the days since school ended have been pretty fun, not the best they could be, but all in all I don't have many complaints - I just hope I can keep up this whole staying up late to watch adult swim and comedy central cartoons - the only way to spend the late night when your friends dont usually stay up that late. But yeah, I managed until about 5.30 last night/morning and could have done even better if I didn't have to worry about being late for stuff that I had to do mid-afternoon (thats when you know you've slept late...).  So yeah, late nights, movie nights, its all gone pretty well for the past 5 days (or so).  -mikeo   "I'm not going there to die...I'm going to find out if I'm really  alive "

       guessing we'll probably play two games. sooo we'll be there for however long that takes plus some hanging out of course. and yeah apparently they don't open until 4 so we'll all be meeting there then instead. at the moment it's like me, lauren, alex, william, brooks, brandon, and michael definitely. there are a bunch of other people who will probably but not definitely be there too. mainly juniors.

       yes i believe it is laser quest...terribly sorry. i changed my away message, happy now? lol. and yeah who decided that the naughty ones wouldn't be bitten? personally i'm thinking everyone that doesn't show up that i happen to like gets bitten and then the few who come with us and WANT me to bite them can also be bitten. sound good?

       A few things:  Is it Lazer Quest or Laser Quest? I could have sworn it was the latter...  Why do the naughty ones not get bitten - they're always the fun ones to bite! Why should the naughty ones be excluded - sounds kinda racist - or at least less fun, because everyone knows that none of us belong on the nice list, none of us. At all. okay, thats failing horribly there.  Away I go -  -Mikeo   "I want a girl with a short skirt and a loooooooonnnnggg ... jacket"

       my fellow americans, hear ye hear ye. their royal highnes-ness-es, Christy and Lauren, do declare that all shall attend a meeting to be held friday at lazer quest. their list has been made and is currently in the process of being checked twice and being sorted into naughty and nice. all "nice" listees who fail to attend shall be bitten. conversely, all "naughty" listees who fail to attend shall not be bitten. you have been warned.time will be announced at a later date because, as usual, i have absolutely no clue what's going on. that is all, you may all go about your buisness

         So i hung out with people today...it was quite exciting. Alex, Caitlin, and Courtney. Yup they're cool enough...soo much cooler than you guys. Ha just kidding. We just went out to lunch and stuff. Seems like they're "popular abercrombie people." Oh well. rar they have my screen name and my cell phone number so i'm supposedly going to be hanging out with them a few times before school starts. Somehow it seems like being friends with them could get interesting...and of course as usual i miss you guys! Can't wait to see my Alex on monday!     &nbsp;   ~Christy

       It's some kind of wonderful.  But whatever. I'm still down here, you guys are scattered and it'll be over one point five weeks till that is fixed. Poo.

       I depart tommorrow, and as such, it would be nice to hang out one more time before I go. So any who want to do something, call or leave a message or something along those lines.  Those who are looking for a more reasonable entry, check the other blog.  And Alex: Well said. Or at the least - good point.

       its been goin well for me this summer--i got a new laptop after i got back from the mission trip. i've got theater camp starting next week, and other than that, i'm just relaxing.  about the abortion issue, i think it should be banned, because the woman has a choice she can make to keep her from getting pregnant in the first place.  what do ya'll think about Bush vs. Kerry?

       rar hows it hanging everyone? im tired, ive been tired a lot lately, who else has been tired? its summer, why am i tired in summer, thats when im supposed to recover, im not supposed to be all tired, i think its my bed, my bed isnt very comfortable, my parents just got one of those super duper foam mattress cover thingys and its sooo comfortable, so now theyre getting great sleep, and im the one waking up with a dore back and more tired than when i went to bed... but nooo, im young, it cant be bad, i can take it, rar, everyone needs a ghood nights sleep, no one should have to grin and bear it, sure tons of people do, but if its possible to be able to change it for not thaaat much shouldnt you? ok so the thing might cost like $90 or something, but hell if i sleep better and am more productive, isnt that worth it? rar, whatever, ill shut up with my meaningless bitch and moan ramble, im sure no one really care, and even if they do theres nothing they can do about it, like most shit in life, we're "too young" or whatever, fuck that, we're as young and immature or whatever they concider it as we want to be, were as innocent and sheltered as the world makes us, just because we dont have the age advantage or whatever, many people have the experiance and knowledge of someone much older, not nessiccarily me or you, but people, then there are people who get shoved into stuff they arnt ready for, ok so with some shit maybe we dont know enough to make a decision, but fuck dont force someone into some where or a group of something because you nbelieve it will be good for them, but you dont believe what they say about that group, the group they're around every single fucking day, its just like god damn politicians or company presidents and ceos, trying to make changes for the better when they have no fucking clue what theyre talking about, like 60 year old me voting about abortion stuff, you arnt a female, youve never given birth, youre rich, if your wife or daughter was ritch, ok yes it might do some damage if youre daughter was pregnant, maybe then youd support it, but no you have no clue what its like, you dont see the women who have to quit their jobs to try have their child, or work multiple to pay for child care, and because theyre working so much are no part of their childs life, what kind of an upbringing is that, its vital for a child to have parental interaction, so before you decide peoples futures, take a good hard look at them, not just kids, not just women pregnant, but countries or plants anything. rar, yeah ok thats enought bitching any moaning for tonight, dont know what it accomplished, probably nothing, hell, maybe it'll anger some people, whatever, i dont really care, perhaps itll create conversation, all of those(like the abortion thing) were examples cus that one makes a very good point... so yeah... hope you enjoyed my ramble, if you dont agree with something tell me, ill defend it, but ill welcome youre opinion, thats what this post is about, so yeah, hell i might not agree with everything i just said, its late im rambling so yeah create conversation, creat contriversy, at least it might wake this place up a bit.... lol anyway, on a lighter note, hope everyones enjoying their summer as much as they can....   ~Alex  edit: im not really sure how the second half of that relates to mattresses... so yeah.... oh well, i just got to typing and this is what happened.....

       Of course it isn't dying - it is just a little slow and old. And with all of us collaborating, it's a bit random.  And Christy - If you keep posting, I'll keep posting, as will most of the people here I would bet.  -mikeo  "If there were in the world today any large number of people who desired their own happiness more than they desired the unhappiness of others, we could have paradise in a few years" - Bertrand Russell

[clop clop clop]  SOLDIER #1:  Halt! Who goes there?  ARTHUR:  It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot. King of the Britons, defeater of the Saxons, Sovereign of all England!  SOLDIER #1:  Pull the other one!  ARTHUR:  I am,... and this is my trusty servant Patsy.    We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join me in my court at Camelot. I must speak with your lord and master.  SOLDIER #1:  What? Ridden on a horse?  ARTHUR:  Yes!  SOLDIER #1:  You're using coconuts!  ARTHUR:  What?  SOLDIER #1:  You've got two empty halves of coconut and you're bangin' 'em together.  ARTHUR:  So? We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercia, through--  SOLDIER #1:  Where'd you get the coconuts?  ARTHUR:  We found them.  SOLDIER #1:  Found them? In Mercia? The coconut's tropical!  ARTHUR:  What do you mean?  SOLDIER #1:  Well, this is a temperate zone.  ARTHUR:  The swallow may fly south with the sun or the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land?  SOLDIER #1:  Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?  ARTHUR:  Not at all. They could be carried.  SOLDIER #1:  What? A swallow carrying a coconut?  ARTHUR:  It could grip it by the husk!  SOLDIER #1:  It's not a question of where he grips it! It's a simple question of weight ratios! A five ounce bird could not carry a one pound coconut.  ARTHUR:  Well, it doesn't matter. Will you go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here?  SOLDIER #1:  Listen. In order to maintain air-speed velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings forty-three times every second, right?  ARTHUR:  Please!  SOLDIER #1:  Am I right?  ARTHUR:  I'm not interested!  SOLDIER #2:  It could be carried by an African swallow!  SOLDIER #1:  Oh, yeah, an African swallow maybe, but not a European swallow. That's my point.  SOLDIER #2:  Oh, yeah, I agree with that.  ARTHUR:  Will you ask your master if he wants to join my court at Camelot?!  SOLDIER #1:  But then of course a-- African swallows are non-migratory.  SOLDIER #2:  Oh, yeah.  SOLDIER #1:  So, they couldn't bring a coconut back anyway.  [clop clop clop]  SOLDIER #2:  Wait a minute! Supposing two swallows carried it together?  SOLDIER #1:  No, they'd have to have it on a line.  SOLDIER #2:  Well, simple! They'd just use a strand of creeper!  SOLDIER #1:  What, held under the dorsal guiding feathers?  SOLDIER #2:  Well, why not?  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 'Bring out your dead!'  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  [thud]  [clang]  CART MASTER:  Bring out your dead!

DENNIS:  Man!  ARTHUR:  Man. Sorry. What knight lives in that castle over there?  DENNIS:  I'm thirty-seven.  ARTHUR:  I-- what?  DENNIS:  I'm thirty-seven. I'm not old.  ARTHUR:  Well, I can't just call you 'Man'.  DENNIS:  Well, you could say 'Dennis'.  ARTHUR:  Well, I didn't know you were called 'Dennis'.  DENNIS:  Well, you didn't bother to find out, did you?  ARTHUR:  I did say 'sorry' about the 'old woman', but from the behind you looked--  DENNIS:  What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior!  ARTHUR:  Well, I am King!  DENNIS:  Oh, King, eh, very nice. And how d'you get that, eh? By exploiting the workers! By 'anging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the economic and social differences in our society. If there's ever going to be any progress with the--  WOMAN:  Dennis, there's some lovely filth down here. Oh! How d'you do?    ARTHUR:  How do you do, good lady? I am Arthur, King of the Britons. Who's castle is that?  WOMAN:  King of the who?  ARTHUR:  The Britons.  WOMAN:  Who are the Britons?  ARTHUR:  Well, we all are. We are all Britons, and I am your king.  WOMAN:  I didn't know we had a king. I thought we were an autonomous collective.  DENNIS:  You're fooling yourself. We're living in a dictatorship: a self-perpetuating autocracy in which the working classes--  WOMAN:  Oh, there you go bringing class into it again.  DENNIS:  That's what it's all about. If only people would hear of--  ARTHUR:  Please! Please, good people. I am in haste. Who lives in that castle?  WOMAN:  No one lives there.  ARTHUR:  Then who is your lord?  WOMAN:  We don't have a lord.  ARTHUR:  What?  DENNIS:  I told you. We're an anarcho-syndicalist commune. We take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week,...  ARTHUR:  Yes.  DENNIS:  ...but all the decisions of that officer have to be ratified at a special bi-weekly meeting...  ARTHUR:  Yes, I see.  DENNIS:  ...by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs,...  ARTHUR:  Be quiet!  DENNIS:  ...but by a two-thirds majority in the case of more major--  ARTHUR:  Be quiet! I order you to be quiet!  WOMAN:  Order, eh? Who does he think he is? Heh.  ARTHUR:  I am your king!  WOMAN:  Well, I didn't vote for you.  ARTHUR:  You don't vote for kings.  WOMAN:  Well, how did you become King, then?  ARTHUR:  The Lady of the Lake,...  [angels sing]  ...her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water signifying by Divine Providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur.  [singing stops]  That is why I am your king!  DENNIS:  Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.  ARTHUR:  Be quiet!  DENNIS:  Well, but you can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!  ARTHUR:  Shut up!  DENNIS:  I mean, if I went 'round saying I was an emperor just because some moistened bint had lobbed a scimitar at me, they'd put me away!  ARTHUR:  Shut up, will you? Shut up!    DENNIS:  Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system.  ARTHUR:  Shut up!  DENNIS:  Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help! Help! I'm being repressed!  ARTHUR:  Bloody peasant!  DENNIS:  Oh, what a give-away. Did you hear that? Did you hear that, eh? That's what I'm on about. Did you see him repressing me? You saw it, didn't you?   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The black knight  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  [King Arthur music]  [music stops]  BLACK KNIGHT:  Aaaagh!

VILLAGER #1:  What are they?  CROWD:  Tell us! Tell us!...  BEDEVERE:  Tell me. What do you do with witches?  VILLAGER #2:  Burn!  VILLAGER #1:  Burn!  CROWD:  Burn! Burn them up! Burn!...  BEDEVERE:  And what do you burn apart from witches?  VILLAGER #1:  More witches!  VILLAGER #3:  Shh!  VILLAGER #2:  Wood!  BEDEVERE:  So, why do witches burn?  [pause]  VILLAGER #3:  B--... 'cause they're made of... wood?  BEDEVERE:  Good! Heh heh.  CROWD:  Oh, yeah. Oh.  BEDEVERE:  So, how do we tell whether she is made of wood?  VILLAGER #1:  Build a bridge out of her.  BEDEVERE:  Ah, but can you not also make bridges out of stone?  VILLAGER #1:  Oh, yeah.  RANDOM:  Oh, yeah. True. Uhh...  BEDEVERE:  Does wood sink in water?  VILLAGER #1:  No. No.  VILLAGER #2:  No, it floats! It floats!  VILLAGER #1:  Throw her into the pond!  CROWD:  The pond! Throw her into the pond!  BEDEVERE:  What also floats in water?

VILLAGER #1:  If... she... weighs... the same as a duck,... she's made of wood.  BEDEVERE:  And therefore?  VILLAGER #2:  A witch!  VILLAGER #1:  A witch!  CROWD:  A witch! A witch!...  VILLAGER #4:  Here is a duck. Use this duck.  [quack quack quack]  BEDEVERE:  Very good. We shall use my largest scales.  CROWD:  Ohh! Ohh! Burn the witch! Burn the witch! Burn her! Burn her!

VILLAGER #3:  Burn her!  CROWD:  Burn her! Burn her! Burn her! Burn! Burn!...  BEDEVERE:  Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?  ARTHUR:  I am Arthur, King of the Britons.  BEDEVERE:  My liege!  ARTHUR:  Good Sir Knight, will you come with me to Camelot and join us at the Round Table?  BEDEVERE:  My liege! I would be honored.  ARTHUR:  What is your name?  BEDEVERE:  'Bedevere', my liege.  ARTHUR:  Then I dub you 'Sir Bedevere, Knight of the Round Table'.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The book of the film  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  NARRATOR:  The wise Sir Bedevere was the first to join King Arthur's knights, but other illustrious names were soon to follow: Sir Lancelot the Brave, Sir Gallahad the Pure, and Sir Robin the- not- quite- so- brave- as- Sir- Lancelot, who had nearly fought the Dragon of Angnor, who had nearly stood up to the vicious Chicken of Bristol, and who had personally wet himself at the Battle of Badon Hill, and the aptly named Sir Not- appearing- in- this- film.    Together they formed a band whose names and deeds were to be retold throughout the centuries: the Knights of the Round Table.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Camelot  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  [clop clop clop]  SIR BEDEVERE:  And that, my liege, is how we know the earth to be banana-shaped.  ARTHUR:  This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere. Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.  BEDEVERE:  Oh, certainly, sir.  SIR LAUNCELOT:  Look, my liege!  [trumpets]  ARTHUR:  Camelot!  SIR GALAHAD:  Camelot!  LAUNCELOT:  Camelot!  PATSY:  It's only a model.  ARTHUR:  Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home.    Let us ride... to... Camelot!  [in medieval hall]  KNIGHTS: [singing]  We're Knights of the Round Table.  We dance whene'er we're able.  We do routines and chorus scenes  With footwork impeccable.  We dine well here in Camelot.  We eat ham and jam and spam a lot.  [dancing]    We're Knights of the Round Table.  Our shows are formidable,  But many times we're given rhymes  That are quite unsingable.  We're opera mad in Camelot.  We sing from the diaphragm a lot.  [in dungeon]  PRISONER:  [clap clap clap clap]  [in medieval hall]  KNIGHTS: [tap-dancing]  In war we're tough and able,  Quite indefatigable.  Between our quests we sequin vests and impersonate Clark Gable.  It's a busy life in Camelot.  MAN:  I have to push the pram a lot.  [outdoors]  ARTHUR:  Well, on second thought, let's not go to Camelot. It is a silly place.  KNIGHTS:  Right. Right.   'A blessing from the Lord!'  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  [clop clop clop]  [boom boom]  [angels sing]  GOD:  Arthur! Arthur, King of the Britons!    Oh, don't grovel!  [singing stops]  One thing I can't stand, it's people groveling.  ARTHUR:  Sorry.  [boom]  GOD:  And don't apologize. Every time I try to talk to someone it's 'sorry this' and 'forgive me that' and 'I'm not worthy'.  [boom]  What are you doing now?!  ARTHUR:  I'm averting my eyes, O Lord.    GOD:  Well, don't. It's like those miserable Psalms-- they're so depressing. Now, knock it off!  ARTHUR:  Yes, Lord.  GOD:  Right! Arthur, King of the Britons, your Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times.  ARTHUR:  Good idea, O Lord!  GOD:  'Course it's a good idea! Behold!  [angels sing]  Arthur, this is the Holy Grail. Look well, Arthur, for it is your sacred task to seek this grail. That is your purpose, Arthur: the quest for the Holy Grail.

[pause]  Hallo!  FRENCH GUARD:  Allo! Who is eet?  ARTHUR:  It is King Arthur, and these are my Knights of the Round Table. Whose castle is this?  FRENCH GUARD:  This is the castle of my master, Guy de Loimbard.  ARTHUR:  Go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest. If he will give us food and shelter for the night, he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.  FRENCH GUARD:  Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen. Uh, he's already got one, you see.  ARTHUR:  What?  GALAHAD:  He says they've already got one!  ARTHUR:  Are you sure he's got one?  FRENCH GUARD:  Oh, yes. It's very nice-a. (I told him we already got one.)  FRENCH GUARDS:  [chuckling]    ARTHUR:  Well, u-- um, can we come up and have a look?  FRENCH GUARD:  Of course not! You are English types-a!  ARTHUR:  Well, what are you, then?  FRENCH GUARD:  I'm French! Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king-a?!  GALAHAD:  What are you doing in England?  FRENCH GUARD:  Mind your own business!  ARTHUR:  If you will not show us the Grail, we shall take your castle by force!  FRENCH GUARD:  You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottom, sons of a silly person. I blow my nose at you, so-called Arthur King, you and all your silly English k-nnnnniggets. Thpppppt! Thppt! Thppt!  GALAHAD:  What a strange person.  ARTHUR:  Now look here, my good man--  FRENCH GUARD:  I don't wanna talk to you no more, you empty headed animal food trough wiper! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!  GALAHAD:  Is there someone else up there we could talk to?  FRENCH GUARD:  No. Now, go away, or I shall taunt you a second time-a!  [sniff]  ARTHUR:  Now, this is your last chance. I've been more than reasonable.  FRENCH GUARD:  (Fetchez la vache.)  OTHER FRENCH GUARD:  Quoi?  FRENCH GUARD:  (Fetchez la vache!)  [mooo]  ARTHUR:  If you do not agree to my commands, then I shall--  [twong]    [mooooooo]  Jesus Christ!  KNIGHTS:  Christ!  [thud]  Ah! Ohh!  ARTHUR:  Right! Charge!  KNIGHTS:  Charge!

FRENCH GUARDS:  [taunting]  LAUNCELOT:  Fiends! I'll tear them apart!  ARTHUR:  No, no. No, no.  BEDEVERE:  Sir! I have a plan, sir.

ARTHUR:  Who leaps out?  BEDEVERE:  U-- u-- uh, Launcelot, Galahad, and I, uh, leap out of the rabbit, uh, and uh...  ARTHUR:  Ohh.  BEDEVERE:  Oh.

The historian  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  [clack]  VOICE:  Picture for Schools, take eight.  DIRECTOR:  Action!  HISTORIAN:  Defeat at the castle seems to have utterly disheartened King Arthur. The ferocity of the French taunting took him completely by surprise, and Arthur became convinced that a new strategy was required if the quest for the Holy Grail were to be brought to a successful conclusion. Arthur, having consulted his closest knights, decided that they should separate and search for the Grail individually.  [clop clop clop]  Now, this is what they did: Launcelot--  KNIGHT:  Aaaah!  [slash]  [KNIGHT kills HISTORIAN]  HISTORIAN'S WIFE:  Frank!   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Sir Robin and the three-headed knight  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  [trumpets]  NARRATOR:  The Tale of Sir Robin. So, each of the knights went their separate ways. Sir Robin rode north, through the dark forest of Ewing, accompanied by his favourite minstrels.  MINSTREL: [singing]  Bravely bold Sir Robin rode forth from Camelot.  He was not afraid to die, O brave Sir Robin.  He was not at all afraid to be killed in nasty ways,  Brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Robin!  He was not in the least bit scared to be mashed into a pulp,  Or to have his eyes gouged out and his elbows broken,  To have his kneecaps split and his body burned away  And his limbs all hacked and mangled, brave Sir Robin!  His head smashed in and his heart cut out  And his liver removed and his bowels unplugged  And his nostrils raped and his bottom burned off  And his pen--  SIR ROBIN:  That's-- that's, uh-- that's enough music for now, lads. Heh. Looks like there's dirty work afoot.  DENNIS:  Anarcho-syndicalism is a way of preserving freedom.  WOMAN:  Oh, Dennis, forget about freedom. We haven't got enough mud.  ALL HEADS:  Halt! Who art thou?    MINSTREL: [singing]  He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who--  ROBIN:  Shut up! Um, n-- n-- n-- nobody, really. I'm j-- j-- j-- ju-- just, um-- just passing through.  ALL HEADS:  What do you want?  MINSTREL: [singing]  To fight and--  ROBIN:  Shut up! Um, oo, a-- nothing. Nothing, really. I, uh-- j-- j-- just-- just to, um-- just to p-- pass through, good Sir Knight.  ALL HEADS:  I'm afraid not!  ROBIN:  Ah. W-- well, actually I-- I am a Knight of the Round Table.  ALL HEADS:  You're a Knight of the Round Table?  ROBIN:  I am.  LEFT HEAD:  In that case, I shall have to kill you.  MIDDLE HEAD:  Shall I?  RIGHT HEAD:  Oh, I don't think so.  MIDDLE HEAD:  Well, what do I think?  LEFT HEAD:  I think kill him.  RIGHT HEAD:  Oh, let's be nice to him.  LEFT HEAD:  Oh, shut up.    ROBIN:  Perhaps I could--  LEFT HEAD:  And you. Oh, quick! Get the sword out. I want to cut his head off!  RIGHT HEAD:  Oh, cut your own head off!  MIDDLE HEAD:  Yes, do us all a favour!  LEFT HEAD:  What?  RIGHT HEAD:  Yapping on all the time.  MIDDLE HEAD:  You're lucky. You're not next to him.  LEFT HEAD:  What do you mean?  MIDDLE HEAD:  You snore!  LEFT HEAD:  Oh, I don't. Anyway, you've got bad breath.  MIDDLE HEAD:  Well, it's only because you don't brush my teeth.  RIGHT HEAD:  Oh, stop bitching and let's go have tea.  LEFT HEAD:  Oh, all right. All right. All right. We'll kill him first and then have tea and biscuits.  MIDDLE HEAD:  Yes.  RIGHT HEAD:  Oh, not biscuits.  LEFT HEAD:  All right. All right, not biscuits, but let's kill him anyway.  ALL HEADS:  Right!  MIDDLE HEAD:  He buggered off.  RIGHT HEAD:  So he has. He's scarpered.  MINSTREL: [singing]  Brave Sir Robin ran away,  ROBIN:  No!  MINSTREL: [singing]  Bravely ran away, away.  ROBIN:  I didn't!  MINSTREL: [singing]  When danger reared its ugly head, he bravely turned his tail and fled.  ROBIN:  No!  MINSTREL: [singing]  Yes, brave Sir Robin turned about  ROBIN:  I didn't!  MINSTREL: [singing]  And gallantly, he chickened out. Bravely taking to his feet,  ROBIN:  I never did!  MINSTREL: [singing]  He beat a very brave retreat,  ROBIN:  All lies!  MINSTREL: [singing]  Bravest of the brave, Sir Robin.  ROBIN:  I never!   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Diving monks  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  CARTOON MONKS: [chanting]  Pie Iesu domine, dona eis requiem.

[pound pound pound]  In the name of King Arthur, open the door!  [creak]  [thump]  [creak]  [boom]  GIRLS:  Hello!  ZOOT:  Welcome, gentle Sir Knight. Welcome to the Castle Anthrax.    GALAHAD:  The Castle Anthrax?  ZOOT:  Yes. Oh, it's not a very good name, is it? Oh, but we are nice and we will attend to your every, every need!  GALAHAD:  You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?  ZOOT:  The what?  GALAHAD:  The Grail. It is here.  ZOOT:  Oh, but you are tired and you must rest awhile. Midget! Crapper!  MIDGET and CRAPPER:  Yes, O Zoot?  ZOOT:  Prepare a bed for our guest.  MIDGET and CRAPPER:  Oh, thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!...  ZOOT:  Away! Away, varletesses. The beds here are warm and soft and very, very big.  GALAHAD:  Well, look, I-- I, uh--  ZOOT:  What is your name, handsome knight?  GALAHAD:  'Sir Galahad... the Chaste'.  ZOOT:  Mine is 'Zoot'. Just 'Zoot'. Oh, but come.    GALAHAD:  Look, please! In God's name, show me the Grail!  ZOOT:  Oh, you have suffered much. You are delirious.  GALAHAD:  No, look. I have seen it! It is here in this--  ZOOT:  Sir Galahad! You would not be so ungallant as to refuse our hospitality.  GALAHAD:  Well, I-- I, uh--  ZOOT:  Oh, I am afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours. We are but eight score young blondes and brunettes, all between sixteen and nineteen- and- a- half, cut off in this castle with no one to protect us. Oooh. It is a lonely life: bathing, dressing, undressing, making exciting underwear. We are just not used to handsome knights. Nay. Nay. Come. Come. You may lie here. Oh, but you are wounded!  GALAHAD:  No, no. It's-- it's nothing.  ZOOT:  Oh, you must see the doctors immediately! No, no, please! Lie down.  [clap clap]  PIGLET:  Well, what seems to be the trouble?  GALAHAD:  They're doctors?!  ZOOT:  Uh, they... have a basic medical training, yes.  GALAHAD:  B-- but--  ZOOT:  Oh, come. Come. You must try to rest. Doctor Piglet! Doctor Winston! Practise your art.  WINSTON:  Try to relax.  GALAHAD:  Are you sure that's absolutely necessary?  PIGLET:  We must examine you.    GALAHAD:  There's nothing wrong with that!  PIGLET:  Please. We are doctors.  GALAHAD:  Look! This cannot be. I am sworn to chastity.  PIGLET:  Back to your bed! At once!  GALAHAD:  Torment me no longer. I have seen the Grail!  PIGLET:  There's no grail here.  GALAHAD:  I have seen it! I have seen it!  [clank]  I have seen--  GIRLS:  Hello.  GALAHAD:  Oh.  GIRLS:  Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello.  GALAHAD:  Zoot!  DINGO:  No, I am Zoot's identical twin sister, Dingo.  GALAHAD:  Oh, well, excuse me, I--  DINGO:  Where are you going?  GALAHAD:  I seek the Grail! I have seen it, here in this castle!  DINGO:  Oh, no. Oh, no! Bad, bad Zoot!  GALAHAD:  Well, what is it?  DINGO:  Oh, wicked, bad, naughty Zoot! She has been setting alight to our beacon, which, I have just remembered, is grail-shaped. It's not the first time we've had this problem.  GALAHAD:  It's not the real Grail?  DINGO:  Oh, wicked, bad, naughty, evil Zoot! She is a bad person and must pay the penalty! Do you think this scene should have been cut? We were so worried when the boys were writing it, but now, we're glad. It's better than some of the previous scenes, I think.  LEFT HEAD:  At least ours was better visually.  DENNIS:  Well, at least ours was committed. It wasn't just a string of pussy jokes.  OLD MAN:  Get on with it.  TIM THE ENCHANTER:  Yes, get on with it!  ARMY OF KNIGHTS:  Yes, get on with it!  DINGO:  Oh, I am enjoying this scene.  GOD:  Get on with it!  DINGO:  [sigh]  [clunk]  Oh, wicked, wicked Zoot. Oh, she is a naughty person and she must pay the penalty, and here in Castle Anthrax, we have but one punishment for setting alight the grail-shaped beacon: you must tie her down on a bed and spank her.  GIRLS:  A spanking! A spanking!  DINGO:  You must spank her well, and after you have spanked her, you may deal with her as you like, and then, spank me.  AMAZING:  And spank me.  STUNNER:  And me.  LOVELY:  And me.  DINGO:  Yes. Yes, you must give us all a good spanking!  GIRLS:  A spanking! A spanking! There is going to be a spanking tonight!  DINGO:  And after the spanking, the oral sex.  GIRLS:  The oral sex! The oral sex!  GALAHAD:  Well, I could stay a bit longer.  LAUNCELOT:  Sir Galahad!  GALAHAD:  Oh, hello.  LAUNCELOT:  Quick!  GALAHAD:  What?  LAUNCELOT:  Quick!  GALAHAD:  Why?  LAUNCELOT:  You are in great peril!  DINGO:  No, he isn't.  LAUNCELOT:  Silence, foul temptress!  GALAHAD:  You know, she's got a point.  LAUNCELOT:  Come on! We will cover your escape!  GALAHAD:  Look, I'm fine!  LAUNCELOT:  Come on!  GIRLS:  Sir Galahad!  GALAHAD:  No. Look, I can tackle this lot single-handed!  DINGO:  Yes! Let him tackle us single-handed!  GIRLS:  Yes! Let him tackle us single-handed!  LAUNCELOT:  No, Sir Galahad. Come on!  GALAHAD:  No! Really! Honestly, I can cope. I can handle this lot easily.  DINGO:  Oh, yes. Let him handle us easily.  GIRLS:  Yes. Let him handle us easily.  LAUNCELOT:  No. Quick! Quick!  GALAHAD:  Please! I can defeat them! There's only a hundred-and-fifty of them!  DINGO:  Yes! Yes, he will beat us easily! We haven't a chance.  GIRLS:  We haven't a chance. He will beat us easily...  [boom]  DINGO:  Oh, shit.  LAUNCELOT:  We were in the nick of time. You were in great peril.  GALAHAD:  I don't think I was.  LAUNCELOT:  Yes, you were. You were in terrible peril.  GALAHAD:  Look, let me go back in there and face the peril.  LAUNCELOT:  No, it's too perilous.  GALAHAD:  Look, it's my duty as a knight to sample as much peril as I can.  LAUNCELOT:  No, we've got to find the Holy Grail. Come on!  GALAHAD:  Oh, let me have just a little bit of peril?  LAUNCELOT:  No. It's unhealthy.  GALAHAD:  I bet you're gay.  LAUNCELOT:  No, I'm not.   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  'Meanwhile, King Arthur and Sir Bedevere...'  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  NARRATOR:  Sir Launcelot had saved Sir Galahad from almost certain temptation, but they were still no nearer the Grail. Meanwhile, King Arthur and Sir Bedevere, not more than a swallow's flight away, had discovered something. Oh, that's an unladen swallow's flight, obviously. I mean, they were more than two laden swallows' flights away-- four, really, if they had a coconut on a line between them. I mean, if the birds were walking and dragging--  CROWD:  Get on with it!  NARRATOR:  Oh, anyway. On to scene twenty-four, which is a smashing scene with some lovely acting, in which Arthur discovers a vital clue, and in which there aren't any swallows, although I think you can hear a starling-- oooh!   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Arthur, Bedevere, and the old man  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  OLD MAN:  Heh, hee ha ha hee hee! Hee hee hee ha ha ha...    ARTHUR:  And this enchanter of whom you speak, he has seen the Grail?  OLD MAN:  ...Ha ha ha ha! Heh, hee ha ha hee! Ha hee ha! Ha ha ha ha...  ARTHUR:  Where does he live?  OLD MAN:  ...Heh heh heh heh...  ARTHUR:  Old man, where does he live?  OLD MAN:  ...Hee ha ha ha. He knows of a cave, a cave which no man has entered.  ARTHUR:  And the Grail. The Grail is there?  OLD MAN:  There is much danger, for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril, which no man has ever crossed.  ARTHUR:  But the Grail! Where is the Grail?!  OLD MAN:  Seek you the Bridge of Death.  ARTHUR:  The Bridge of Death, which leads to the Grail?  OLD MAN:  Heh, hee hee hee hee! Ha ha ha ha ha! Hee ha ha...   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The Knights of Ni  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  [spooky music]  [music stops]  HEAD KNIGHT OF NI:  Ni!

HEAD KNIGHT:  The Knights Who Say 'Ni' demand a sacrifice.    ARTHUR:  Knights of Ni, we are but simple travellers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods.  HEAD KNIGHT:  Ni!

We will find you a shrubbery.  HEAD KNIGHT:  You must return here with a shrubbery, or else, you will never pass through this wood... alive.  ARTHUR:  O Knights of Ni, you are just and fair, and we will return with a shrubbery.  HEAD KNIGHT:  One that looks nice.  ARTHUR:  Of course.  HEAD KNIGHT:  And not too expensive.  ARTHUR:  Yes.

This'll be your kingdom, lad.  HERBERT:  But Mother--  FATHER:  Father, lad. Father.  HERBERT:  B-- b-- but Father, I don't want any of that.  FATHER:  Listen, lad. I built this kingdom up from nothing. When I started here, all there was was swamp. Other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same, just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp. So, I built a second one. That sank into the swamp. So, I built a third one. That burned down, fell over, then sank into the swamp, but the fourth one... stayed up! And that's what you're gonna get, lad: the strongest castle in these islands.  HERBERT:  But I don't want any of that. I'd rather--  FATHER:  Rather what?!  HERBERT:  I'd rather...  [music]  ...just... sing!  FATHER:  Stop that! Stop that! You're not going into a song while I'm here. Now listen, lad. In twenty minutes, you're getting married to a girl whose father owns the biggest tracts of open land in Britain.  HERBERT:  B-- but I don't want land.  FATHER:  Listen, Alice,--  HERBERT:  Herbert.  FATHER:  'Erbert. We live in a bloody swamp. We need all the land we can get.  HERBERT:  But-- but I don't like her.  FATHER:  Don't like her?! What's wrong with her?! She's beautiful. She's rich. She's got huge... tracts o' land!  HERBERT:  I know, but I want the-- the girl that I marry to have...  [music]  ...a certain,... special... something!  FATHER:  Cut that out! Cut that out! Look, you're marrying Princess Lucky, so you'd better get used to the idea!  [smack]  Guards! Make sure the Prince doesn't leave this room until I come and get him.  GUARD #1:  Not to leave the room even if you come and get him.  GUARD #2:  Hic!  FATHER:  No, no. Until I come and get him.    GUARD #1:  Until you come and get him, we're not to enter the room.  FATHER:  No, no. No. You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.  GUARD #1:  And you'll come and get him.  GUARD #2:  Hic!  FATHER:  Right.  GUARD #1:  We don't need to do anything apart from just stop him entering the room.  FATHER:  No, no. Leaving the room.  GUARD #1:  Leaving the room. Yes.  [sniff]  FATHER:  All right?  GUARD #1:  Right.  GUARD #2:  Hic!  FATHER:  Right.  GUARD #1:  Oh, if-- if-- if, uhh-- if-- if-- w-- ehh-- i-- if-- if we--  FATHER:  Yes? What is it?  GUARD #1:  Oh, i-- if-- i-- oh--  FATHER:  Look, it's quite simple.  GUARD #1:  Uh...  FATHER:  You just stay here and make sure 'e doesn't leave the room. All right?  GUARD #2:  Hic!  FATHER:  Right.  GUARD #1:  Oh, I remember. Uhh, can he leave the room with us?  FATHER:  N-- no, no. No. You just keep him in here and make sure he--  GUARD #1:  Oh, yes. We'll keep him in here, obviously, but if he had to leave and we were with him--  FATHER:  No, no, no, no. Just keep him in here--  GUARD #1:  Until you or anyone else--  FATHER:  No, not anyone else. Just me.  GUARD #1:  Just you.  GUARD #2:  Hic!  FATHER:  Get back.  GUARD #1:  Get back.  FATHER:  All right?  GUARD #1:  Right. We'll stay here until you get back.  GUARD #2:  Hic!  FATHER:  And, uh, make sure he doesn't leave.  GUARD #1:  What?  FATHER:  Make sure 'e doesn't leave.  GUARD #1:  The Prince?  FATHER:  Yes. Make sure 'e doesn't leave.  GUARD #1:  Oh, yes, of course.  GUARD #2:  Hic!  GUARD #1:  Ah. I thought you meant him. You know, it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard.  FATHER:  Is that clear?  GUARD #2:  Hic!  GUARD #1:  Oh, quite clear. No problems.  FATHER:  Right. Where are you going?  GUARD #1:  We're coming with you.  FATHER:  No, no. I want you to stay here and make sure 'e doesn't leave.  GUARD #1:  Oh, I see. Right.  HERBERT:  But Father!  FATHER:  Shut your noise, you! And get that suit on!  [music]  And no singing!  GUARD #2:  Hic!  FATHER:  Oh, go and get a glass of water.

I will send help as soon as I have accomplished a daring and heroic rescue in my own particular...  [sigh]  CONCORDE:  Idiom, sir?  LAUNCELOT:  Idiom!  CONCORDE:  No, I feel fine, actually, sir.

[rewr!]  [music stops]  Is there anywhere in this town where we could buy a shrubbery?  [dramatic chord]  OLD CRONE:  Who sent you?  ARTHUR:  The Knights Who Say 'Ni'.  CRONE:  Aggh! No! Never! We have no shrubberies here.  ARTHUR:  If you do not tell us where we can buy a shrubbery, my friend and I will say... we will say... 'ni'.  CRONE:  Agh! Do your worst!  ARTHUR:  Very well! If you will not assist us voluntarily,... ni!  CRONE:  No! Never! No shrubberies!  ARTHUR:  Ni!  CRONE:  [cough]  BEDEVERE:  Nu!  ARTHUR:  No, no, no, no, i--  BEDEVERE:  Nu!  ARTHUR:  No, it's not that. It's 'ni'.  BEDEVERE:  Nu!  ARTHUR:  No, no. 'Ni'. You're not doing it properly. No.  BEDEVERE:  Ni!  ARTHUR and BEDEVERE:  Ni!  ARTHUR:  That's it. That's it. You've got it.  ARTHUR and BEDEVERE:  Ni!  CRONE:  Ohh!  BEDEVERE:  Ni!  ARTHUR:  Ni!  CRONE:  Agh!  BEDEVERE:  Ni!  ARTHUR:  Ni!  BEDEVERE:  Ni!  ARTHUR:  Ni!  BEDEVERE:  Ni!  ROGER THE SHRUBBER:  Are you saying 'ni' to that old woman?  ARTHUR:  Erm,... yes.  ROGER:  Oh, what sad times are these when passing ruffians can say 'ni' at will to old ladies. There is a pestilence upon this land. Nothing is sacred. Even those who arrange and design shrubberies are under considerable economic stress at this period in history.  ARTHUR:  Did you say 'shrubberies'?  ROGER:  Yes. Shrubberies are my trade. I am a shrubber. My name is 'Roger the Shrubber'. I arrange, design, and sell shrubberies.  BEDEVERE:  Ni!  ARTHUR:  No! No, no, no! No!   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The knights who no longer say 'ni'  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ARTHUR:  O Knights of Ni, we have brought you your shrubbery. May we go now?  HEAD KNIGHT:  It is a good shrubbery. I like the laurels particularly,... but there is one small problem.    ARTHUR:  What is that?  HEAD KNIGHT:  We are now... no longer the Knights Who Say 'Ni'.  KNIGHTS OF NI:  Ni! Shh!  HEAD KNIGHT:  Shh! We are now the Knights Who Say 'Ecky- ecky- ecky- ecky- pikang- zoop- boing- goodem- zoo- owli- zhiv'.  RANDOM:  Ni!  HEAD KNIGHT:  Therefore, we must give you a test.  ARTHUR:  What is this test, O Knights of-- knights who till recently said 'ni'?  HEAD KNIGHT:  Firstly, you must find... another shrubbery!  [dramatic chord]  ARTHUR:  Not another shrubbery!  RANDOM:  Ni!  HEAD KNIGHT:  Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must place it here beside this shrubbery, only slightly higher so you get the two-level effect with a little path running down the middle.  KNIGHTS OF NI:  A path! A path! A path! Ni! Shh! Ni! Ni! Ni! Shh! Shh!...  HEAD KNIGHT:  Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest... with... a herring!  [dramatic chord]  KNIGHTS OF NI:  A herring!  ARTHUR:  We shall do no such thing!  HEAD KNIGHT:  Oh, please!  ARTHUR:  Cut down a tree with a herring? It can't be done.  KNIGHTS OF NI:  Aaaaugh! Aaaugh!  HEAD KNIGHT:  Augh! Ohh! Don't say that word.  ARTHUR:  What word?  HEAD KNIGHT:  I cannot tell, suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni cannot hear.  ARTHUR:  How can we not say the word if you don't tell us what it is?  KNIGHTS OF NI:  Aaaaugh!  HEAD KNIGHT:  You said it again!  ARTHUR:  What, 'is'?  KNIGHTS OF NI:  Agh! No, not 'is'.  HEAD KNIGHT:  No, not 'is'. You wouldn't get vary far in life not saying 'is'.  KNIGHTS OF NI:  No, not 'is'. Not 'is'.  BEDEVERE:  My liege, it's Sir Robin!  MINSTREL: [singing]  He is packing it in and packing it up  And sneaking away and buggering up  And chickening out and pissing off home,  Yes, bravely he is throwing in the sponge.  ARTHUR:  Sir Robin!  ROBIN:  My liege! It's good to see you.  HEAD KNIGHT:  Now he's said the word!  ARTHUR:  Surely you've not given up your quest for the Holy Grail?  MINSTREL: [singing]  He is sneaking away and buggering up--  ROBIN:  Shut up! No, no. No. Far from it.  HEAD KNIGHT:  He said the word again!  KNIGHTS OF NI:  Aaaaugh!  ROBIN:  I was looking for it.  KNIGHTS OF NI:  Aaaaugh!  ROBIN:  Uh, here-- here in this forest.  ARTHUR:  No, it is far from this place.  KNIGHTS OF NI:  Aaaaugh!  HEAD KNIGHT:  Aaaaugh! Stop saying the word! The word...  ARTHUR:  Oh, stop it!  HEAD KNIGHT:  ...we cannot hear! Ow! He said it again!  ARTHUR:  Patsy!  HEAD KNIGHT:  Wait! I said it! I said it!  [clop clop clop]  Ooh! I said it again! And there again! That's three 'it's! Ohh!

Beyond the forest, they met Launcelot and Galahad, and there was much rejoicing.    KNIGHTS:  Yay! Yay!  [woosh]  NARRATOR:  In the frozen land of Nador, they were forced to eat Robin's minstrels.  MINSTREL: [high-pitched]  Get back! Eee!  NARRATOR:  And there was much rejoicing.  KNIGHTS:  Yay!  NARRATOR:  A year passed.  CARTOON CHARACTER:  [shivering]  NARRATOR:  Winter changed into Spring.  CARTOON CHARACTER:  Mmm, nice.  NARRATOR:  Spring changed into Summer.  CARTOON CHARACTER:  Oh. Ahh.  NARRATOR:  Summer changed back into Winter,...  CARTOON CHARACTER:  Oh?

ARTHUR:  You know my name?  TIM:  I do.  [zoosh]  You seek the Holy Grail!  ARTHUR:  That is our quest. You know much that is hidden, O Tim.  TIM:  Quite.  [pweeng boom]  [clap clap clap]  ROBIN:  Oh.  ARTHUR:  Yes, we're-- we're looking for the Holy Grail. Our quest is to find the Holy Grail.  KNIGHTS:  Yeah. Yes. It is. It is. Yeah. Yup. Yup. Hm. Mm.  ARTHUR:  And so, we're-- we're-- we're looking for it.  BEDEVERE:  Yes, we are.  GALAHAD:  Yeah.  ROBIN:  We are. We are.  BEDEVERE:  We have been for some time.  ROBIN:  Ages.  BEDEVERE:  Umhm.

Um, I don't want to waste any more of your time, but, uh, I don't suppose you could, uh, tell us where we might find a, um-- find a, uh-- a, um-- a, uh--  TIM:  A what...?  ARTHUR:  A g-- a-- a g-- a g-- a-- a g--  TIM:  A grail?!  ARTHUR:  Yes. I think so.  ROBIN:  Y-- y-- yes.  ARTHUR:  Yes.  GALAHAD:  Yup.  KNIGHTS:  That's it...  TIM:  Yes!  ROBIN:  Oh.

[boom pweeng boom boom]  ARTHUR:  Look, um, you're a busy man, uh--  TIM:  Yes, I can help you find the Holy Grail.  KNIGHTS:  Oh, thank you. Oh...  TIM:  To the north there lies a cave-- the cave of Caerbannog-- wherein, carved in mystic runes upon the very living rock, the last words of Olfin Bedwere of Rheged...  [boom]  ...make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.  ARTHUR:  Where could we find this cave, O Tim?  TIM:  Follow. But! Follow only if ye be men of valour, for the entrance to this cave is guarded by a creature so foul, so cruel that no man yet has fought with it and lived! Bones of full fifty men lie strewn about its lair. So, brave knights, if you do doubt your courage or your strength, come no further, for death awaits you all with nasty, big, pointy teeth.  ARTHUR:  What an eccentric performance.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The rabbit of Caerbannog  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  [clop clop clop]  [whinny whinny]  GALAHAD:  They're nervous, sire.

ARTHUR:  W-- just keep me covered.  TIM:  Too late!  [dramatic chord]  ARTHUR:  What?  TIM:  There he is!  ARTHUR:  Where?  TIM:  There!  ARTHUR:  What, behind the rabbit?  TIM:  It is the rabbit.  ARTHUR:  You silly sod!  TIM:  What?  ARTHUR:  You got us all worked up!  TIM:  Well, that's no ordinary rabbit!  ARTHUR:  Ohh.  TIM:  That's the most foul, cruel, and bad-tempered rodent you ever set eyes on!  ROBIN:  You tit! I soiled my armour I was so scared!  TIM:  Look, that rabbit's got a vicious streak a mile wide! It's a killer!  GALAHAD:  Get stuffed!  TIM:  He'll do you up a treat, mate.  GALAHAD:  Oh, yeah?  ROBIN:  You mangy Scots git!  TIM:  I'm warning you!  ROBIN:  What's he do, nibble your bum?  TIM:  He's got huge, sharp-- eh-- he can leap about-- look at the bones!  ARTHUR:  Go on, Bors. Chop his head off!  BORS:  Right! Silly little bleeder. One rabbit stew comin' right up!  TIM:  Look!  [squeak]  BORS:  Aaaugh!    [dramatic chord]  [clunk]  ARTHUR:  Jesus Christ!  TIM:  I warned you!  ROBIN:  I done it again!  TIM:  I warned you, but did you listen to me? Oh, no, you knew it all, didn't you? Oh, it's just a harmless little bunny, isn't it? Well, it's always the same. I always tell them--  ARTHUR:  Oh, shut up!  TIM:  Do they listen to me?  ARTHUR:  Right!  TIM:  Oh, no...  KNIGHTS:  Charge!  [squeak squeak squeak]    KNIGHTS:  Aaaaugh!, Aaaugh!, etc.  ARTHUR:  Run away! Run away!  KNIGHTS:  Run away! Run away!...  TIM:  Ha ha ha ha! Ha haw haw! Ha! Ha ha!  ARTHUR:  Right. How many did we lose?    LAUNCELOT:  Gawain.  GALAHAD:  Ector.  ARTHUR:  And Bors. That's five.  GALAHAD:  Three, sir.  ARTHUR:  Three. Three. And we'd better not risk another frontal assault. That rabbit's dynamite.  ROBIN:  Would it help to confuse it if we run away more?  ARTHUR:  Oh, shut up and go and change your armour.  GALAHAD:  Let us taunt it! It may become so cross that it will make a mistake.  ARTHUR:  Like what?  GALAHAD:  Well... ooh.  LAUNCELOT:  Have we got bows?  ARTHUR:  No.  LAUNCELOT:  We have the Holy Hand Grenade.  ARTHUR:  Yes, of course! The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch! 'Tis one of the sacred relics Brother Maynard carries with him. Brother Maynard! Bring up the Holy Hand Grenade!  MONKS: [chanting]  Pie Iesu domine, dona eis requiem.    Pie Iesu domine, dona eis requiem. Pie Iesu domine, dona eis requiem. Pie Iesu domine, dona eis requiem.  ARTHUR:  How does it, um-- how does it work?  LAUNCELOT:  I know not, my liege.  ARTHUR:  Consult the Book of Armaments!  BROTHER MAYNARD:  Armaments, chapter two, verses nine to twenty-one.  SECOND BROTHER:  And Saint Attila raised the hand grenade up on high, saying, 'O Lord, bless this Thy hand grenade that, with it, Thou mayest blow Thine enemies to tiny bits in Thy mercy.'    And the Lord did grin, and the people did feast upon the lambs and sloths and carp and anchovies and orangutans and breakfast cereals and fruit bats and large chu--  MAYNARD:  Skip a bit, Brother.  SECOND BROTHER:  And the Lord spake, saying, 'First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin. Then, shalt thou count to three. No more. No less. Three shalt be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, nor either count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out. Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then, lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thy foe, who, being naughty in My sight, shall snuff it.'  MAYNARD:  Amen.  KNIGHTS:  Amen.  ARTHUR:  Right!    One!... Two!... Five!  GALAHAD:  Three, sir!  ARTHUR:  Three!

Look!  LAUNCELOT:  What does it say?  GALAHAD:  What language is that?    ARTHUR:  Brother Maynard! You are a scholar.  MAYNARD:  It's Aramaic!  GALAHAD:  Of course! Joseph of Arimathea!  LAUNCELOT:  'Course!  ARTHUR:  What does it say?  MAYNARD:  It reads, 'Here may be found the last words of Joseph of Arimathea. He who is valiant and pure of spirit may find the Holy Grail in the Castle of aaaaaagggh'.  ARTHUR:  What?  MAYNARD:  '...The Castle of aaaaaagggh'.  BEDEVERE:  What is that?  MAYNARD:  He must have died while carving it.  LAUNCELOT:  Oh, come on!  MAYNARD:  Well, that's what it says.  ARTHUR:  Look, if he was dying, he wouldn't bother to carve 'aaaaaggh'. He'd just say it!  MAYNARD:  Well, that's what's carved in the rock!  GALAHAD:  Perhaps he was dictating.  ARTHUR:  Oh, shut up. Well, does it say anything else?  MAYNARD:  No. Just 'aaaaaagggh'.  LAUNCELOT:  Aaaauugggh.  ARTHUR:  Aaaaaggh.  BEDEVERE:  Do you suppose he meant the Camaaaaaargue?  GALAHAD:  Where's that?  BEDEVERE:  France, I think.  LAUNCELOT:  Isn't there a 'Saint Aaauuves' in Cornwall?  ARTHUR:  No, that's 'Saint Ives'.  LAUNCELOT:  Oh, yes. Saint Iiiiives.  KNIGHTS:  Iiiiives.  BEDEVERE:  Oooohoohohooo!  LAUNCELOT:  No, no. 'Aaaauugggh', at the back of the throat. Aaauugh.  BEDEVERE:  N-- no. No, no, no, no. 'Oooooooh', in surprise and alarm.  LAUNCELOT:  Oh, you mean sort of a 'aaaah'!  BEDEVERE:  Yes, but I-- aaaaaah!  ARTHUR:  Oooh!  GALAHAD:  My God!  [dramatic chord]  [roar]    MAYNARD:  It's the legendary Black Beast of Aaauugh!  [Black Beast of Aaauugh eats BROTHER MAYNARD]  BEDEVERE:  That's it! That's it!  ARTHUR:  Run away!  KNIGHTS:  Run away!  [roar]  Run away! Run awaaay! Run awaaaaay!  [roar]  Keep running!  [boom]  [roar]  Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!...  BEDEVERE:  We've lost him.  [roar]  KNIGHTS:  Aagh!  NARRATOR:  As the horrendous Black Beast lunged forward, escape for Arthur and his knights seemed hopeless, when suddenly, the animator suffered a fatal heart attack.  ANIMATOR:  Ulk!  [thump]  NARRATOR:  The cartoon peril was no more. The quest for Holy Grail could continue.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Bridge of Death  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  [gurgle]  GALAHAD:  There it is!  ARTHUR:  The Bridge of Death!  ROBIN:  Oh, great.  ARTHUR:  Look! There's the old man from scene twenty-four!  BEDEVERE:  What is he doing here?  ARTHUR:  He is the keeper of the Bridge of Death. He asks each traveller five questions--  GALAHAD:  Three questions.  ARTHUR:  Three questions. He who answers the five questions--  GALAHAD:  Three questions.  ARTHUR:  Three questions may cross in safety.  ROBIN:  What if you get a question wrong?  ARTHUR:  Then you are cast into the Gorge of Eternal Peril.  ROBIN:  Oh, I won't go.  GALAHAD:  Who's going to answer the questions?  ARTHUR:  Sir Robin!  ROBIN:  Yes?  ARTHUR:  Brave Sir Robin, you go.  ROBIN:  Hey! I've got a great idea. Why doesn't Launcelot go?  LAUNCELOT:  Yes. Let me go, my liege. I will take him single-handed. I shall make a feint to the north-east that s--  ARTHUR:  No, no. No. Hang on! Hang on! Hang on! Just answer the five questions--  GALAHAD:  Three questions.  ARTHUR:  Three questions as best you can, and we shall watch... and pray.  LAUNCELOT:  I understand, my liege.  ARTHUR:  Good luck, brave Sir Launcelot. God be with you.  BRIDGEKEEPER:  Stop!    Who would cross the Bridge of Death must answer me these questions three, ere the other side he see.  LAUNCELOT:  Ask me the questions, bridgekeeper. I am not afraid.  BRIDGEKEEPER:  What... is your name?    LAUNCELOT:  My name is 'Sir Launcelot of Camelot'.  BRIDGEKEEPER:  What... is your quest?  LAUNCELOT:  To seek the Holy Grail.  BRIDGEKEEPER:  What... is your favourite colour?  LAUNCELOT:  Blue.  BRIDGEKEEPER:  Right. Off you go.  LAUNCELOT:  Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  ROBIN:  That's easy!  BRIDGEKEEPER:  Stop! Who approacheth the Bridge of Death must answer me these questions three, ere the other side he see.  ROBIN:  Ask me the questions, bridgekeeper. I'm not afraid.  BRIDGEKEEPER:  What... is your name?  ROBIN:  'Sir Robin of Camelot'.  BRIDGEKEEPER:  What... is your quest?  ROBIN:  To seek the Holy Grail.  BRIDGEKEEPER:  What... is the capital of Assyria?  [pause]  ROBIN:  I don't know that! Auuuuuuuugh!  BRIDGEKEEPER:  Stop! What... is your name?  GALAHAD:  'Sir Galahad of Camelot'.  BRIDGEKEEPER:  What... is your quest?  GALAHAD:  I seek the Grail.  BRIDGEKEEPER:  What... is your favourite colour?  GALAHAD:  Blue. No, yel-- auuuuuuuugh!  BRIDGEKEEPER:  Hee hee heh. Stop! What... is your name?  ARTHUR:  It is 'Arthur', King of the Britons.  BRIDGEKEEPER:  What... is your quest?  ARTHUR:  To seek the Holy Grail.  BRIDGEKEEPER:  What... is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?  ARTHUR:  What do you mean? An African or European swallow?  BRIDGEKEEPER:  Huh? I-- I don't know that. Auuuuuuuugh!  BEDEVERE:  How do know so much about swallows?  ARTHUR:  Well, you have to know these things when you're a king, you know.

[angels sing]  [singing stops]  [ethereal music]    ARTHUR:  The Castle Aaaagh. Our quest is at an end!    God be praised! Almighty God, we thank Thee that Thou hast vouchsafed to us the most holy--  [twong]  [baaaa]  Jesus Christ!  [thud]  FRENCH GUARD:  Allo, dappy English k-niggets and Monsieur Arthur King, who has the brain of a duck, you know. So, we French fellows outwit you a second time!  ARTHUR:  How dare you profane this place with your presence! I command you, in the name of the Knights of Camelot, to open the doors of this sacred castle, to which God Himself has guided us!  FRENCH GUARD:  How you English say, 'I one more time, mac, unclog my nose in your direction', sons of a window-dresser!    So, you think you could out-clever us French folk with your silly knees-bent running about advancing behavior?! I wave my private parts at your aunties, you cheesy lot of second hand electric donkey-bottom biters.    ARTHUR:  In the name of the Lord, we demand entrance to this sacred castle!  FRENCH GUARD:  No chance, English bed-wetting types. I burst my pimples at you and call your door-opening request a silly thing, you tiny-brained wipers of other people's bottoms!  ARTHUR:  If you do not open this door, we shall take this castle by force!  [splat]  In the name of God and the glory of our--  [splat]  FRENCH GUARDS:  [laughing]  ARTHUR:  Agh. Right! That settles it!  FRENCH GUARD:  Yes, depart a lot at this time and cut the approaching any more, or we fire arrows at the tops of your heads and make castanets out of your testicles already! Ha ha haaa ha!  ARTHUR:  Walk away. Just ignore them.  FRENCH GUARD:  And now, remain gone, illegitimate-faced bugger-folk! And, if you think you got a nasty taunting this time, you ain't heard nothing yet, dappy English k-nnniggets! Thpppt!  FRENCH GUARDS:  [taunting]  ARTHUR:  We shall attack at once!  BEDEVERE:  Yes, my liege!  ARTHUR:  Stand by for attack!  [exciting music]  [music stops]  [silence]  French persons!  FRENCH GUARDS:  [taunting] ...Dappy!...  ARTHUR:  Today the blood of many a valiant knight shall be avenged. In the name of God,...  FRENCH GUARDS:  Hoo hoo! Ohh, ha ha ha ha ha!...  ARTHUR:  ...we shall not stop our fight till each one of you lies dead and the Holy Grail returns to those whom God has chosen!  FRENCH GUARDS:  ...Ha ha ha!...  ARTHUR:  Charge!  ARMY OF KNIGHTS:  Hooray!  [police siren]  HISTORIAN'S WIFE:  Yes, they're the ones. I'm sure.  INSPECTOR:  Come on. Anybody armed must go, too.  OFFICER #1:  All right. Come on. Back.  HISTORIAN'S WIFE:  Get that one.  OFFICER #1:  Back. Right away. Just... pull it off. Come on. Come along.  INSPECTOR:  Put this man in the van.  OFFICER #1:  Clear off. Come on.  BEDEVERE:  With whom?  INSPECTOR:  Which one?  OFFICER #1:  Oh-- this one.  INSPECTOR:  Come on. Put him in the van.  OFFICER #2:  Get a blanket.  OFFICER #1:  We have no hospital.  RANDOM:  Ahh.  [squeak]  RANDOM:  Ooh.  OFFICER #1:  Come on. Back. Riiight back. Come on!  OFFICER #2:  Run along! Run along!  OFFICER #1:  Pull that off. My, that's an offensive weapon, that is.  OFFICER #2:  Come on. Back with 'em. Back. Right. Come along.  INSPECTOR:  Everything?  [squeak]  OFFICER #1:  All right, sonny. That's enough. Just pack that in.

       i had the weirdest dream last night. so i was at discovery place, except it was like a mall, like it had a starbucks and a food court and stuff...and michael (i think it was michael...it could have been alex lol) was like this superhero type dude who could fly, like had these charge booster fire rocket engine type things for legs, so he was like flying me around discovery place, and i dont really remember much about that, but later i ran into christy in the parking lot, which was ginormous, with her mom and jennifer in this like fancied up hearse looking type car, like a limo hearse lol, and she was all excited cause it was a surprise coming back from florida visit. and why you were in the ginormous parking lot of the mallesque discovery place i do not know. so her mom apparently didnt like me very much anymore for some reason, because christy was like "you should come join us!" and her mom was really hesitant, and i had to do something, so i couldnt go anyway, but guess what you wanted me to join you in? jury duty. i was like "yeah...thats exciting..." lol. so hooray for strange dreams.

       I've started a really bad habit that I bet all of you are copying right now: staying up really late.  But I bet I've made mine even worse than all of you: I have to be at school at 9 for a debate thing.  Math time: 9 - 4(o'clock)=5 hours. -1 for breakfast shower and drive time = 4. -1 for misc. 3 hours of sleep!

       That's even crazier than what our schedule is. But you're lucky to have had your orientation already. I wish we had ours soon, even though I would want school to come for a while. So yeah, I went to Lauren's volleyball thing, and it felt kinda strange to be on campus again. Mixed feelings about it and all. Hopefully those will go away once I get into the swing of things.

       I'm back from my two-and-a-half-week stint elsewhere!  And it's not dead yet.  Back to my point - while at the debate thing, through the use of many asides I essentially learned the history of the world. And the funny thing is that a lot of it had to do with Philadelphia. If I remember some of them it goes a little something like this: The marines were assembled from Philly bars, meaning that the guys were vicious, ready to fight, and could be easily coaxed into a drunken rage (okay, I added that last one). Then there was the story about how Philly is the only city to have ever bombed itself. And now my mind fails me - as I remember, I'll post more, but for now, I'm getting breakfast.  -mikeo  "Do not be too moral. You may cheat yourself out of much life. Aim above morality. Be not simply good; be good for something" - Henry David Thoreau
