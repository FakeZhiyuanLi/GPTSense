						   &nbsp; Well, I've gone and done it. I've started this blog and thus joined the scores of self-indulgent who think anyone in the world actually cares what they have to say. Don't I have anything better to do with my time?  You bet.  This is gonna be so lame.

						   This back-and-forth between the Red Sox and Nomar Garciaparra is getting tiresome. I've seen murder/suicides that end with more civility.  Most folks around here seem to blaming the Sox for starting this pissing contest, but I'll let you decide. Below comments from Nomar and Sox GM Theo Esptein that appeared in the same story in the Boston Globe the day after the trade. Note the dramatic difference in tone.   Nomar:   "If it was in my control, I'd still be wearing a Red Sox uniform.” "They can take the shirt off my back, but they can't take away the memories I got.”   Epstein:   ''It was with mixed emotions that we let Nomar go. ''He's been one of the greatest Red Sox of all time.'' "We lost a great player in Nomar Garciaparra, but we've made our club more functional. We weren't going to win a World Series with our defense."  Someone here clearly has an axe to grind.

						   OK, so Nomar Garciaparra is now a Chicago Cub. Can Red Sox fans and some of the local media outlets here in Boston  please  stop overstating the significance of this trade? I've heard some people compare it to the sale of Babe Ruth. Gimme a break. First off, let me say that I was never a big Nomar fan. He always struck me a something of a phony. Early on he earned this reputation as a great team guy, good to the fans etc. While I appreciate the way he interacted with children and signed autographs, I just never bought into this notion that he was some sort of stand-up guy in the clubhouse and a great team player. He always struck me as odd and somewhat selfish. That's not to say he wasn't a great ballplayer. He was a throwback in the way he performed on the field, attacking the ball with gusto on defense and barreling out of the batter's box every time he made contact. For that he should be applauded. But I've heard scores of people call him the "greatest all-around player the Red Sox have ever had." No friggin' way. I got one word for those dopes: Yaz. Don't believe me? Look at the numbers for both players over their first eight seasons and how each was regarded by his contemporaries. I've averaged out their average season over the first eight years. Here are the numbers:  R H 2b 3b HR RBI SB E Yaz 87 170 36 4 20 82 8 7 Nomar 86 154 34 6 22 84 10 16  Yes, Nomar only had 87 at-bats in his rookie season and 21 in 2001 and that's a factor. But let's not forget that he played during the liveliest ball era of all time. Yaz's first eight seasons came during the 1960s, the most pitching dominated decade in the history of the game. During his era, teams scored around four runs per game and the league ERA was about 3.50. During Nomar's era, which saw Roger Maris' season home run record obliterated by Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Barry Bonds, teams scored five runs per game and the league ERA was 4.50. To me, it's a wash. Give Nomar the at-bats he missed, but send him back in time to the 1960s and his numbers would probably come out the same. For some context, let's look at season-ending rankings and awards. During his first eight years, Yaz was a five-time all-star, won four Gold Gloves, a Triple Crown, an MVP award, finished in the Top 10 in MVP voting four other times, won three batting titles, led the league in on-base percentage four times, slugging percentage twice, OPS three times, runs once, hits twice, total bases once, doubles three times, home runs once, RBI once, bases on balls twice and extra-base hits once. Garciaparra, on the other hand, was also a five-time all-star, won Rookie of the Year, won two batting titles, led the league in hits once, doubles once, triples once and finished in the Top 10 in MVP voting five times. Clearly, Yaz was not only a bigger impact player on his team, but league-wide as well. And don't discount the fact that the young Yaz played on some of the worst Sox teams of all-time, whereas Nomar's big-spending Sox were perennial contenders. If that doesn't convince you, how about this: Nomar never had any food named for him, but Yaz Bread was a staple of the New England diet in the late 1960s.  Just for kicks, Fred Lynn can also be compared to Nomar. His average season numbers through seven years with the Sox.  R H 2b 3b HR RBI SB E 75 135 31 4 18 74 6 4  Lynn was a six-time all-star during those seven years, won an MVP, finished in the top 10 in MVP voting one other time, won a batting title, finished first in on-base percentage once, slugging percentage twice, OPS twice, runs once and doubles once.
