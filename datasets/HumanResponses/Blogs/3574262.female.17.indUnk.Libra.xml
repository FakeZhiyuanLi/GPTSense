      Dear diary, pretty down lately. Kinda wondering if its bcuz of him, or is it bcuz im stucked at home with NOTHING better to do! :bleeeh: Anyways, one of those sleepless nights last wednesday, Hong msg-ed me surprisingly. And i thought that he forgot bout' my existence alredy. Asked me why ain't i in bed, and was i thinking bout other guys. Told him nothin he should worry bout, as i'l l deal with it myself. (Hell ya, i WAS thinking bout guys, was thinking bout Him. Agh!) Then he called, out of the blue. Well, hate to admit it, but sorta had a feeling he will. He alwiz did when i had some problems and all. Just can't stop wondering if he does dat to everygirl he knows, u noe? *shrugs* Called, asked me wats up, (refused to tell him anything. It just didn't feel right). And we talked a lil'. Actually more like had our casual cat-fights. :) Oh, and yes he even asked me out this saturday (today), for movie. And erm, bringin me c this ENT in the morning b4 dat. I was like, can someone pls tell me whats going on? Pls? Gosh. It just didn't felt like.. Him. Lately la. Feel as though he's avouding me. Dam rite. Haunted by my past, and history repeating itself. Again. Agh! Well, nothing much i can do bout' it, then just confront him. The questions is, HOW. Agh! Headache. Anyways, persuading me to go to bed,(as it was very late, but to no avail) he hung up. I msg-ed him, told him thanks for being a sweetie for calling up and that i'll manage being a tough girl and all. Guess wat, he called again, and snickered at me being tough. Wat a total pest! Hung up, and I called him this time, "sang-ed" him properly. :P Anyways, said our Goodnights, (which was really hard, cuz he tends to reply me with Good-afternoon) and we hung up. Was pretty sweet of him, and it did made me smile. Ya, it did. But not for long i guess huh? Oh well.. urs alwiz, cyn-

      Dear diary, met up with my ko and Jus on Monday. boy, was i glad to see him! Missed him, totally! Went Kim Gary's for Lunch. Jus ordered this, er.. rice and i ordered Peach snow Maountain and both of us shared with ko. :) Wanted to watch movies, but thanks to his Heng dais.. AGH! Oh well, nvm.. He followed us shopping, which was really quite cute. He was there to hold our cellpones, wallet, and handbangs while we try all the clothes we could get our hands on! Well, thank God for Topshop and their PS2. Hehe.. Yeap, ur guess is right. He played Street Fighter there, while both of us went in and out of the dressing room, tried on all the shades we could get our itchy fingers on, and even made our way to Zara. :P Yups, he came over to find us, and there he was carrying our stuf. Again. :P But it wasn't that bad la, rite ko? Hopped into MNG, and tried clothes again. Both of us. Asked him for opinions, and guess wat he shoved me. Long sleeved button-ups. PLAIN one-coloured top. GOSH! Get a grip ko! This is sooooo not a communist country where u have to get ur ksin all covered up! Anyways, hanged around then we left Mid Valley. (Is this the 1st time im telling u where we actually went? Oops, sorry dear d.) He dropped me off at Asia, and i reached home by 5pm. (Which was reeeaaaaaaallll early, considering i've been going out and coming home after 12 lately. :P) Great "family reunion" la, overall. Wish we did more though, like wathced movies. ;)

      Dear diary, spent last Saturday night at Genting with Hong, Ni, and Ken. Almost had to slept in the streets, really did gave me a huge lesson for not booking rooms earlier. Hehe.. guess Ni and i really had our fair share "tasting" how is it like being a well, beggar. :P Anyways, was really quite "cham" for us, had to line up all the way oni to find out dat there's no more rooms and dat we gotta wait till after 8pm. This time, we didn't let go, continued lining up, and eventually made friends with 2 aunties who were really friendly and nice. And this STUPID IDIOTIC BARBARIAN came and cut our line, being an absolute hooligan. AGH! Waited for like what seemed eternal, before Ken came over and gave me a fright! Was i glad to see them! Hong carried my luggage, and walked me to the carpark. Left everything in the boot, (after struggling with the buttons and knobs) and ended up fooling with him in the car park. Hehe, silly us. (no wonder Ni and Ken were wondering wat happened to us!). Thanks to a Malay lady, (who happens to understand Mandarin as well) we managed to get a room! 15749. Yeap, that's the room number. Left our stuf, and we went for dinner. Ended up at the super-duper smell-ed mamak Ni and i sorta "despised". :) Both of us took of our jackets and took the guys' jacket and roll-ed ours in. Well, so that u know, the smell will get to theirs first, and not ours. :evil: Ken took off his pull-over and it was kinda cute as his singlet and my white v-back tee was somewhat similar, and since we were sitting together... :P Then this scary looking fella was practically staring at us, which kidna freaked us girls out. Left after dinner, and thankflly no one followed. *phew*! Hanged out outside there, at the "japanese garden" and cuddled against each other. Took some pics, which was sorta cute. Missed those times. Was walking to the cinema when LCK called, and felt sorta bad cuz the guys had to "hide" and pretend they were somewhere. Aiks. Anyways, Hong accompanied me to the room, and the others headed to the cinema first. Gave him a light massage on his back (yea, managed to slap his butt too! :P) and "quarelled" on our way. Harry Potter 3 was only OKAY, not as good as i expected, and i happened to be the story teller to the other 3. *grins* Wanted to go clubbing with them, but unfortunately the "clubs" were closed. HELLO? Like only 2 am only! Super dumb i felt. Headed to Starbucks, bought a Puff which was really nice. Went back to room. I continued to tease him all the way bout talking on the phone, and Gary msg-ed me. Told me i was pretty and cute and all. *shrugs*. Washed up and the others went to bed, and Hong said he's going out to "fetch some water". Yeah. Right. Kinda regretted not following him as he asked me, cuz im actually STILL curious. But erm, well.. Can't do anything bout' it now could i? Aikz. He came back, and we well.. went to bed. Looked at each other, which was pretty amusing as it was in the dark, and we were fumbling for each other. Hehe.. Finally, Ni decided to on the lights, and i made him locked the door. Didn't really had any rest actually, had my usual cold. Agh! I think i got up from bed for more than 20 times. Poor Hong, im sure he didn't sleep well from all the tossing and turning, huh? Oops. Aight, anyways, nxt morning.. Was really really hard to wake him up. When i said Goodnite to him the nite b4, all he said was.. Good afternoon. Agh! Made him wake up, he asked me to go for Breakfast. Really can be a pain in the butt sometimes can't he? Hehe.. I just love it when he shakes his head when i asked him if he can wake up. So.. cute. Even ni agrees. ;) After packing, Ken just swept me off my feet out of nowhere and threw me on the bed! Just like those Newly weds? Resisted at first, but didn't later on. Felt sorta fun. And guess wat, i wasn't heavy!! YAY!! Then before u know it, walking out of the room, he just grabbed my feet and piggy-back-ed me! I was screaming all the way: "HELP!" WEI!!!!" LET ME DOWN!" :P Well, mainly bcuz it was very sudden to me, and i felt as though my jeans were going to come off anytime soon. (which unfortunately, didn't.) Hong and i were in-charged of checking out, and we managed to fight over who gets to keep the card this time. And, NO, not for ourselves, but the other way around. Silly Us. (No wonder Ni and Ken was starting to wonder wat happened to us. Again. ;P) Aight, we checked out. And we headed to Gohtong Jaya for lunch. Honestly, i enjoyed the most there. WE had long talks, heart-to-heart. (well, in a way..) and it just felt so.. relaxed. As though there isn't any barrier between us or anyting. It felt good. Really good. Oh, did i tell u that one of the topics brought up was.. perverted? Keke.. Yea. Ni and i had the time of our lives asking them stuff with them answering us. And poor them, we weren't exactly honest with them when they asked US in turn, unlike them. Oh well.... *grins* Got into the car, and we talked again. Haha. Ya, the "talking couples". *winks*. Then that stupid Hong mentioned something, which i can't get off my head now. AGH! Anyways, we finally reached, dropped Ni off at the LRT, and they sent me home. It's the gazillion-th time i'm feeling guilty bout' them not being able to drop me off at my front porch. But.. I just don't know how to break it out to them, or xplain the situation in simple words or language to make them understand. I just.. don't. AGH! And sometimes, i just can't stop blaming myself, for giving HIM such a great "resistant" to overcome my current. AGH! AGH! Just.. tell me wat to do k? I just sincerely hope that they know that they are really important in my heart deep deep down. Oh, and i appreciate their kindness, and concern they've shown me all this while. And that the outings and "dates" with them, were all an simply amazing adventure all together. Every single one, and that i truly cherish them. Yups. I love u all. Very very the much. ;) xoxo, cyn-

      Dear diary, i've got loads to tell u. Went out with Ni on Friday nite. Kinda felt bad for "dumping" my jimuis for Hong and gang. But.. wat to do? He's leaving in bout 2 weeks time, won't be hanging out with them till he comes back i guess. Just hope i did right though. Let me tell u wat i wore. Really liked it. Was casual, yet not "sat lai". They must've felt weird coz' we don't usually dress lidat when we're out. :)  Well, in THEIR eyes la thats it. Wore a sorta v-back brown tee with my padini shorts, with black jap slippers with blue nicely pedicured nails. :) Felt soooo comfy and beachy at the same time. So slumber. :) Hong picked us up (in his old car) from Lrt. Since we're here, might as well tell u how proud i am bout' not minding it at all. Old car, New car didn't even mattered to me then. Just can't stop feeling that i've changed and grown alot u know? :) It's a good thing ain't it? Ya, it is. Fetched us to Alpha Angle (thru jam and all) coz' i was starving to bits. Ended up? Both of us ended up spending duno how much time in ONE shop, choosing shirts for guys. Goodness, God knows what we'll end up doing nxt time! :P Thought for a long long long time, and decided to get something for Hong. Since he's been SORTA sweet AT TIMES. Did i tell u that i have the same Exact one? :P What made me Really happy was when i received his sms, asking me to call him when we're done shopping and that he'll come over to pick us up. :) Aight, after skipping like a thousand of minor details... Went to this place called Zook for dinner. Atmosphere's pretty good. Played "chor dai di" with his friends, beat him and his friends. Haha.. The kena "ta pao" by him. Luckily his friend helped me, if not... keke. Sorta enjoyed myself, cuz we were sorta stucked together. Has some talk with him. Kacau-ed him with dat sily gal which he insisted there's nothing going on between them. Ya la, wateva he says rite? Forgot to tell u dat a GAL called him when we were on our way to Alpha Angle. Didn't even wana tell me who's dat. C? "Sam yao si" Bluek. Liar Liar Pants on Fire. Can't be trusted la guys. After chilling out thr till 12-1 like that, he fetched us home. Luckily i know my way, if not.. sure kena "sang" by him. Hehe.. Then home, then start to think bout the nxt day. Did i tell u i put my pic in his wallet? Hehe, perasan huh? :P Urs alwiz, kim-

      AGH! I was just being regretful and here i am gonna choose them over Jms. How could i? But on the other hand, why can't i? C? Told u i'm kinda nuts lately. But can't balme me rite? With the pace everything's going now.. I'm just normal u noe. I jsut.. wish that.. u know, life will be a little kinder to me at times, and simpler. Its really hard trying to cope out with everyting with it being so complex and all. :bleeeh: Guess that's wat makes it intersting ain't it? :) B4 i forget, just wana tell u bout' this guy i just "met" recently. Haven't met him yet, but he seems like a nice guy to me. Well, prolly matured comparing to childish old me. :) Well, thank God for nice new ppl! It brightens up my day! URs alwiz, kim-

      Had a tough time last nite. Having fun tryin out all the nice nice clothes and not getting to fit into any nicely is besides the point. Was pretty excited bout meeting Jimuis and Tjuan Actually. But.. Agh,i dunno. For the 1st time, i felt.. out of place? !st we went Hartamas Square and the last time i went thr was like.. to send Wei to Spain? And my dish made me think of Hong. I felt like a total bitch i tell u. Sometimes i just hate myself, i mean how cud i do this to them? Bluek. On in addition to that, i felt totaly guilty for not spending much time wit the rest. It's like i got cut off from my friends just bcuz of a stupid guy whom i dun even have strings attached to. Gosh. Wat got me so blind? Thank god, Ni called, and i managed to let out abit b4 i went all cuckoo and stuf. Was really depressing i can tell u. Awful day. Oh, did i tell u that something really weird happened? I was actualy sms-ing with Kit? i myself dun believe what had gotten into me! Well, him too! Hehe, but heck, he's a nice guy. I'm actually liking him! And shopping with Jus? Well, as usual, fruitful. Can't wait to use the orange pants which i find pretty cool with my bag! Urs, cyn-

      Dear diary, had a long and boring day. Just duno y after driving home after lunch, i got soo bored and ran out of stuf to do. How i wish CSI or Bold and the Beautiful could play for the whole day. Then it could at least save me from boredom! Anyways, been feeling empty and not to mention grumpy. Just.. very grumpy and super-duper easily irritated. (no, its not PMS) Ended up printing a whole stack of score sheets and "released" it on my piano. Felt good. Very good. Just dat i had to kip everytin LOW as it was erm.. already 3 am? Stopped playin at 4.30 am to be exact and yes, its An hour and a half on my piano without feeling bored or jumpy. Just wondering.. Was it bcuz i called him before i played it? Just found out dat night talks are alwiz the best to speak ur mind and talk ur heart out. well, sorta. Not like we connected or anytin, but there was something. Between us. It's there and i could just feel it. And yes, i believe that we're both trying to deny, AND not to mention hide. Oh well ,wat to do? Guess its for the best isn't it? It always has been for the best. Last time. Now. And Next time. But.. wat can i do? wat can we do? Can't change the fact that he's gonna leave.. *shrugs* It'll be unfair for me to ask me to stay. No, make it selfish. Nah, i can't do that. I just can't. I won't. But to come to think of it.. how sure is he or me that it wouldn't last? But i'm also not sure how much i can trust him, or.. trust myself.. Heck, i guess its all better this way ain't it? We play. We joke. We connect. BUT no strings attached. Yeah, i tink it is the best. :) Well, i hope. I just.. Just hope nothing will change (except for the better) now and then. Oh and erm, one more thing, was it jealousy? Was it? AGH! I dunoo! I guess it was for me. What else could explain on me kinda "checking" on him? Where were u? With WHO? Do wat?.. And checking his phone.. The thing is, it is already absured for me to do THAT on him, but its not like he doesn't do anyting lidat too. What for will he check if i keep his msges, or his emails (he kept all mine, and so did i btw)? Or, get all touchy-feely when i call his friend AND neighbour and not him? Or, alwiz asks who just msged me, who that GUY was etc. Dam, if there isn't anyting between us, pls just tell me wat is it! It's driving me nuts i tell u. Especially now that i'm soooo bored and i have nothing else better to do! :bleeeh: And here i am, 4.50 am listening to KISS - Because I'm a girl after playing like how many sad love songs on my piano. *aikz* Oops, almost forgot. I SOOOO gotta gaodim my dad bout' genting. For once (actually lately) he's been real nice and even keeps his promises. I wonder what got into him. Realised that he's gonna leave me soon? :hehehe: I hope. Anyawys, i dun wana miss this LAST chance. I gotta go. Help me pls. Yours alwiz, cyn-

He's just so fidgety isn't he? Can't seem to make up his mind bout' where he wants to go. Wel, this just better be his last decision! ;) Anyways, kidna stressed yesterday, but yea.. i'm feeling loads better now. Looks like another fella's mom thinks i'm the son's gf. Lol.. i wonder where all that came from? Do i really have DAT kinda look? Or am i really just givin ppl those kinda impressions? :weird: Whatever it is, its no biggie, as long as they like me! :D

Hel yeah, b4 i forget. Watched Rose Red just now. Well, not the original-original version, but somewat similar. And YES, it was able ot spooke me off! Freaking scary, especially watching these kinda movies HOME ALONE! *phew*! kinda haunting me now.. :hehehe: Oh well,was a great movie, and i'll luv to watch it again!

Until then, kim-

      Yeah, rite u'll do dat. Guess i've been over-exagerating to myself bout' everything. Fine, i'm just this perasan B*tch who thinks the world out of herself.
Teaches me a lesson not to have high hopes. Again.
Cuz the only thing i've gained thru everytin, is that the higher ur hopes are, the higher ur disappointment level is.
