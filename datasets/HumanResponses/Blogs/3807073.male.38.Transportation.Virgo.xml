      Well, the prologue for the TdF is this weekend, and I was talking to my buddy Mathy and decided that the whole world should benefit from my observations and insights as Lance rides for his 6th tour. So, here it is. I hope to make a daily commentary and celebrate at the end with a victory for Lance in Le Tour.

      with Floyd out of gas, and Kloden all but across the line, there's Lance with one last big burst to steal the win. Amazing finish. It's to bad that Lance couldn't have Floyd on the podium with him today, because he deserves the win. What a team.

      Lance is back in yellow and fixing to put a major beat down on the GC. Just finished listening to the interview of Robin Williams on OLN. He's wired as usual. He has gotten to ride in the team car 5 years in a row, now. and usually for some prety big days. TT tomorrow, I think I want to watch it.

      The French do love to see their riders do well on Bastille Day, same as we love it when the Americans ride well on July 4th. I think it was Lance's stage win on July 4th, '99 (fact checking now, nope, it was July 3rd). So, they must be doing backflips over there to have Virenque win the stage in such driving style and also have Voeckler holding the yellow jersey yet again.  I guess we'll have to wait until friday to see the peleton really crack. It sounded like there was some testing of riders in the finish today, and I think if Ulrich is going to want any chance on Lance, he's going to have to attack him and try and drop him, otherwise, Lance will do the same to him.

      And they rode like it, today. It must have been amazing to see the pack catch the 2 lead riders withing metres of the end. What I am always most struck by are the camera angles and perspectives. When Thor won the other day, the camera at street level facing the riders did not show the difference in distance between him and Kirchen. You could not really see how fast Thor was moving until they showed the replay from overhead. Then, you see the distance between Kirchen and the pack when they round the last turn, and then the burst of speed that Thor put on up that street, to overtake him right in front of the line. Very exciting finishes.  Tomorrow, though, they separate the climbers from the grupetto, as it were. With 9 categorized climbs and the longest stage distance of the tour, I predict we will see some movement at the top. I don't look for Lance to go off the front, but he will be reeling in anyone that threatens him, for sure.

      Big spill at the end of today's stage, but everyone seems ok. The French have to be thrilled to see their National Champion in yellow for a 2nd day in a row. France hasn't had a tour winner since 1985, but I am curious as to how many stages a Frenchman has held the yellow jersey in recent years. I am still looking for the site that can tell me that.  The next couple of days are still relatively flat, though the road is starting to point up. By next wednesday, the climbers and the sprinters will be seperated, the Pyrennes are looking quite vertical this year.

      Well, our friend Chris Brewer at www.Paceline.com answered the question that was in my mind today and that is: how long does it take the peleton to reel in a breakaway?  Then answer is, the peleton can make up 10 km for every minute of the break. So, if the breakaway is 10 minutes ahead of the main pack, they would have to start the pursuit of the break before the 100 km-to-go point. Had there been anyone in the break today that the Posties were worried about, they would have had to spend 2/3's of the stage chasing the break. Fortunately, there was no one that threatens Lance with their climbing ability, so the break held.  So, there you go, learned something about tactics today.

      Awesome finish. 6 of the top 7 GC riders are USP, outstanding. They are going to have a tough decision, because even it they don't want to defend the jersey, it may work out that way, just to keep his main rivals behind him. If some purely sprinter riders take it away, they won't sweat it much, but look to him to stay in yellow if it suits their strategy of holding off the real mountain threats.

      As expected, the first couple of stages are dominated by the sprinters. Just glad to see teh team keeping Lance safe and letting the rest of the pack fight it out for sprinter points.  Tomorrow's TTT should be very interesting,(EDIT: TOMORROW?? DUH, I mean Wed. I lose track of days and dates when the tour is on) though, being this early in the race, all the teams shold be fresh and I bet more that a few teams will throw up some strong numbers. As always, I am sure the Posties (what will we call them next year? The Discoverers?) will be strong and not let anyone get out too far. I am sure if the conditions are right, they will go for a win.

      OOOOOOOFFF, I thought our boy was going to pull off that win. How great was it for that guy, Cancellara to put up such a huge time and hold off all those guys. First TdF, first stage win.   I was just glad to see the rain held off. My biggest fear was bad luck and an injury. How quick can fortunes change? Ask Peter Farazijn, who was at home, watching on TV when Cofidis called him to get to the race, Matt White had a crash in training and broke his collar bone. This guy went from spectator to competitor in 2 hours. I hope he has a great race.  Ulrich looks like he's lost weight. I think he's definitly going to be a huge challenge this year. Mayo, Heras, Hamilton, Jan... it's going to be fun 3 weeks.

      Having a little peruse of the news sites for the TdF, everyone seems confident that Lance will take the race. I too, feel that way, but we all know, it is a LONG race and a lot can happen. Remember, Tyler Hamilton broke his collar bone last year, early. He will be a signifcant competition to Lance. Especially on the L'Alp d'Huez time trial. That will be amazing, and I will probably have to watch it live.  Tomorrow's time trial is a sprint, 6.1 km. I think Lance will be in the top 5, and maybe win, depending on the weather. If it's slick and rainy, he'll stay safe.  So, finally, my prediction for the tour, Lance will win with at least a 5 min margin, total. If he loses, my blame will be place squarely on the shoulders of Sheryl Crow, and the definition of "Succubus" will be complete. (needless to say, this belief of mine angers my wife, a bit).

      Well, the prologue is tomorrow. I will be at Scott and Kellyn's to watch. Lance takes off last, so that should be some time around 9:45 central time.  Very excited for this weekend, it will be the perfect pool, BBQ, TdF, Wimbledon weekend.  more later
