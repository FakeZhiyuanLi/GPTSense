      APL wishes happy 39th birthday to s`pore. Next is some comments from our CEO, Andrew  I went to eat the steamboat to marina bay with  Jishun,Melissa Chan,Joyce,some more ppl  who i saw some times but don`t know their names...  Not only it was a class gathering i felt weird joining  but also the fact when most of the ppl were  ppl i don`t know i felt totally weird n  complained to joyce....  Demanding my MVP BenBen Chan.....  He came later just b4 eating d steamboat  but until then, it was a silent trip for me...  when to play bowling, first time played n  it wasn`t that hard but after i felt confident,  Mr. gutter sucked my balls so well i was so  embarrased...  Just when i figured out i should try for the  10pound ball,i played with d 11pound one..  thought that my thumb would be stuck during   the game when i was choosing the ball...  After changing the ball, i got a nice strike!!  But the game was almost over...-_______-  I`ll wait for my revenge Mr. Gutter!!!! @__@  Anyway, I saw the fireworks and WAH LAU~   it was so fantastic and prayed for my wish...  (Definitely cannot reveal^^:)  I never saw that kinda fireworks since the  WorldCup and regretted  myself not bringin the camera..  But i felt better after i heard that Wei ping&Jas couldn`t even see it on their way comin`..  Poor love birds ^^  After wanderin the park in da middle of the night,  the guys were foolin around with fireworks,  BenBen killing 3 poor rockets' dreams...  (they just catched fire on themselves...)  Really liked Wei ping`s fireworks when he lighted up  about 6 firesticks together in a row  they really looked nice...  Then,we went back home by the MRT..  Walkin in pairs,Mel&Jishun,Joyce&amp;BenBen(^^:),  Wei ping&Jas and  ME with my faithful J-timberlake  Long tired trip...  Everyone left me on Yew tee...So sad...  I went home alighting at CCK,taking 175,  just like I do when i go back home  but it was 12am,worried if i lost the last bus so i ran  like a mad-man but it was effective and i got home safe,  finishing my trip from a friend called Singapore`s birthday party
