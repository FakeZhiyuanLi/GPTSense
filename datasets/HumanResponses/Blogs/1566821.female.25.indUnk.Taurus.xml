      So...in my hunt to find the perfect shower curtain I have searched far and wide. BB&B, Walmart, Target, Filenes homestore, Pier 1, and just about everyother place I could have imagined. With my head resting gently on my Martha Stuart Pillows I scored from KMart... urlLink EUREKA ! And I was in love! And it was even on sale! Thanks Martha! In fact...all of the Martha Home collection was on sale...interesting! My recommendation to anyone searching for shower curtains...go fabric!

      I know I know...I didnt keep up with the first blog I created, what makes me think I will keep up with this one? Well, because you requested it! I've turned in to a work-a-holic, and I keep hearing that same old tired line: "Where yah been?" "We never hear from you any more" "When are we going to get together". Since there arent enough hours in the day, I figured I could take a few moments from day to day and update ya'll here.   The move is just about over...got my big stong men coming over tonight to get all the heavy furniture out...it will probably take me the rest of the weekend to get everything out...but I'll be in my new pad as of tonight. Ahhhh, and to live alone. Oh what a joy! Everyone told me just how much I was going to love it, and they were right!   So thats really whats at the top of my list right now. I'll try to be better about this...I swear...  Until next time...visit  urlLink Foamy !

      Its that time of year again...bleh, Halloween. I guess I have lost my interest in dressing up and causing chaos. The past couple of years I have gotten together with friends, dressed up silly, had some beers, etc. This year, so not interested. I am suppose to attend a halloween party at a bar with a friend...think they will riot if I dont show up in costume? Its hard enough figuring out what I want to wear every day...now I have to dress in costume to suck down some tini's and do shots? What is this world coming to? Maybe I can get by as a Buffett fan if I throw on one of my hawaiin shirts...or maybe  urlLink Martha  can help?  The only reason I am even acknowledging the day is because of my cutie niece Cassidy who is being a monkey (quite fitting for her adorable little additude), and the other young children in my life. I guess I would have to say that statement holds true for me with most holidays...so not in to it, but having young children in my life makes me acknowledge it. I guess it will be extremely different sometime when I start my own family...but for now...I'll keep it up for the kids sake.  Come on now...you wouldnt want to participate in all the Halloween crap if your mother did  urlLink this  to you one year (me, age 4, on the left)

      Okay, so maybe I am more to blame then the weather. I sat in the cold, windy rain today watching my friends football team play. Needless to say, I now have the sniffles and cant seem to get warm. Bleh...the things we do for men! But let talk about how adorable little kids are playing football! My friend coaches junior high aged kids, but before their game the elementary aged kids had a game. Oh boy were they adorable! Little kids in huge football pads...even if it was wet and cold, I had a great time.  Winter is coming...and I am soooo not ready! I always hate this whole turning back the clock business. Sure we get an extra hour of sleep in the morning...but it was pitch black by 5:30pm and that sucks!

      Ewwww, am I in a crappy mood! Its just been one of those days. I could barely drag myself out of my bed. I would have been completely happy just snuggled up in my blankets all day dreaming about far off warm places! And with all bad mornings...come the bad day. My couch was suppose to arrive today and oh yah! Sorry Albee, you cant have it until tomorrow. Why do people insist on tormenting me? Ugh, there is nothing I can do about it because I highly doubt my couch can fit in my trunk, so I just have to deal. But I was looking forward to breaking it in tonight while catching some decent Thursday night television...bleh, oh well. And then just when I was starting to think there was something decent for me to watch on television at my wonderful quiet apartment  BANG!  One of my new favorite shows on FOX was canceled. The show was called Skin...almost like a modern day Romeo & Juliet involving District Attorneys, the porn industry, and bi racial relationships.  Well let me tell you...should those FOX jerks cancel  urlLink The OC , heads will roll.   Lets see now...what else can I possibly bitch about?  Oooh! Ohhhh! I got another one!   So Veterans Day falls on Tuesday the 11th of this month. Being a state employee I am fortunate that I get almost every friggen holiday off (can you say Bunker Hill Day???). So, they are giving us Tuesday off...who has ever heard of such a ridiculous thing? Shouldnt they give us Monday off? Ugh, do they think of nothing!  Alright...well I am starting to fell much better now. Thanks for listening to my rant...now listen to  urlLink this  one

      Bleh....I am beat...is it Friday yet? I know-sad. I guess I am just still recovering from the weekend. Believe me you....its going to be a while before I drink like that (yah, I know-lies...all of it...LOL). So this weekend I will be heading to Boston to see  urlLink Les Miserables . My poor neighbors...I have been blasting the soundtrack for days.  Speaking of music, I have been listening to yahoo's  urlLink LAUNCHcast  while at work. You create your own station featuring artists you choose, but there are also other themed stations to listen to. I have been stuck on Awesome 80's and Love Songs. The 80's station plays and awesome selection of 80's tunes. Recently they have played:  No One is To Blame ~ Howard Jones Owner of a Lonely Heart ~ Yes Take On Me ~ A-ha Still Havent Found What I'm Looking For ~ U2 Maneater ~ Hall & Oates  They have some great tunes for sitting at your desk pumping out those not so pleasant reports....  Oh yah! Look how cool I am! Not only have I figured out how to change the links, but I added a counter. Yah me!

      Halloween is over...thank goodness. I am bet you are wondering how I ended up on the costume situation. Well I pondered all the ideas and suggestions - but nothing was simple enough. I wanted somehow to have a costume without actually dressing up. I don't know how I finally came up with it, but I went as 'God's Gift To Men'. I made a giant gift tag and decorated it to say  To: Men From: God  I tied it on my wrist with ribbon, and walla! It was a big hit...I should have some pictures up in the next few days.  Scary enough though...the weekend far from ended there!  Saturday night was the Barbies [Me (Whore Barbie), Melissa (Pole Dancing Barbie), and Tracey (Turbo Barbie) - don't take it all too seriously, there are extremely funny stories behind each name] bi-weekly "Mission: Drink Your Face Off"...and boy did we succeed. Can you say turbo? Well we said 'take that' to about 17 of them...not to mention the constant arrival of drinks from our new buddies that we met at the bar. It is a wonder we made it out of there with our heads still on....but alas, it was a great time as always. After hours at my new pad was fun....it included wrestling, puking, candy, baked chicken & pasta at 3:30am, and a whole lot of laughter. Thanks to Paul the case of the missing placemat has now been solved....   Big ups to little brother Jer for providing some safe transportation home...we owe you one!  And now on to another work week...

      Spent some overdue quality time with my Dunkster last night. It was a martini night all the way...and the Tunnell Bar is always a great place to people watch and catch a few good laughs. Whats better then that wasted chick stumbling around the bar, somehow making her way over to us, and being too drunk to even form real sentences, or real words for that matter. Good thing Mark was nice enough to get her some coffee and take her upstairs to rest it off a bit. And there is really nothing better then running in to that friend from high school who slept with your boyfriend and laughing at her...ah, what fun! whew....its been a rough morning. You know what I am talking about...waking up, bumping into walls, disoriented...did I leave that mess last night? Heres a shout out to Mark my favorite bartender...Oh waiter!!!!

      I am wondering where it has been...my Christmas spirit...I am just not in to it anymore. Its more of a task rather then something enjoy anymore. Every year I spend most of the time fighting off the bah-humbug feelings, and pretending like I really even care. One year my family and I went away to the islands for Christmas...ah the joy. I wish I could do it every year. There was not one piece of Christmas in sight when we were there...heaven! I was shopping around yesterday and there were Christmas decorations everywhere, and I realized just how close to Christmas we really are. We are only talking like 6 weeks here...where the hell has the time gone? I dont even remember fall happening. Bleh, oh well. I am just not ready to tackle my Christmas shopping yet. Its like absolute torture...I never know what to get anyone, or have the patience to go and get it. Fortunately I dont have a ton of people to buy for. I was thinking of doing something homemade and creative...then realized its far less trouble to just purchase gifts and have that nice people in the mall wrap them for me. I am seriously thinking of taking a day off of work, heading to the mall at the ass crack of dawn, and getting it all out of the way. Otherwise, everyone will end up with gift baskets from Hickory Farms - or whatever kiosk I come across first in the mall.

      Wow...did I just love having yesterday off. It was just what I needed. I woke up fairly early and went for a walk along the bike trail that goes right past my place. It was pretty chilly out, but still nice. I have been doing the walk about every other morning,but with this cold weather I am not quite sure how much longer I will be doing that! We even has some snow off and on throughout the day. As much as I hate that stuff, it was really beautiful to watch it flow out of the sky while sipping on some hot tea, snuggled up in my chair. I even attempted to grab my camera and go for a drive to get some first snow shots...but every time I got up it started raining...maybe next time. Did a little shopping, did a whole bunch of relaxing, watched my favorite cheesy soap operas, and made a wonderful beef stew for my co-workers. Overall, it was a very pleasant day. Spent the better half of my evening sipping on some wine with Mel and Tracey-laughing hysterically at Mel's sister Steph and her friends...oh to be young again! And get this! They even got me to play a game...I know, crazy isnt it? Boggle-who would have thought! I have actually found a game that I like! You heard it here folks...a game I enjoyed playing! And I have to say, we played a short game of Taboo with Steph and her friends...and it was a blast. I cant remember the last time I laughed that hard...and sober at that!

      I say no...its not hard when its the right thing to do. So there!  But lets talk about what is hard...falling for someone you can't have - or so I believe. As my friend Emily says "That sucks in such a major way babe". I met this guy around 4 or 5 months ago and its been practically torture ever since. Have you ever been in one of those situations...the guy is great, you can practically feel the attraction from both sides...but there is something that stands in the way? You know what I am talking about - its like a huge pink elephant in the room that everyone refuses to actually talk about...and yah, it friggen sucks. We are not just talking basic attraction...we are talking heart beats skipping, careless thoughts, smiling for no reason feelings...and they only get stronger...Does one simply accept it and move on...or attempt not to lose hope? Bleh...yah know what? I want to move on...just not sure that I can. Double suck!

      In a word or two....today sucks. I am so fighting the flu-and so far she is kicking my ass!   But on a better note, the show last night (Susan Tedeschi) simply rocked. She played some of her older stuff, some covers, and a bunch of new stuff. The crowd was happening, and we (The Dunk and I) had a great time. One complaint though...you could tell that she was completely uncomfortable in her shoes...I still dont know why she didnt just kick them off!?  Things I am looking forward to doing this weekend:  Bag Day Shopping Catching up on sleep Putting together my new bakers rack Hot Lunch @ My 3 Sons Not Working Spending time with Chris after not seeing him in what seems like FOREVER!

      Alright, so here it goes:  While Mel finished up her shift, Tracey and I got ready and then went and picked up Mel's Mom Joan for an evening of fun and chaos. She needed a good night out with the girls, and who better then us?! In fact, this was her first time experiencing all the fun that there is to be had at our favorite place to let loose, My 3 Sons, in Southampton, MA.  Our new best buds, Close Call, were ripping it up before we even got there. You could tell they were excited to see their "Barbies"!!! So then the drinking began...typically we just have Scott or Justin run a tab for us, makes it far more easier to just run up to the bar and wave and have a drink right there for you, rather then fight the crowd and dig the money out of my purse. Especially since everytime I attempted to head up to the bar for another drink, the guys would start playing something that incidentially was "one of my favorites!!!", and I ended up just running back on the dance floor to shake my groove thang! Speaking of my grove thing...lets talk about my new dearest friend Kim. Kim=cool chic! We were outside smoking a cigerette and Kim approaches me to tell me how much she admires my -umhmm- rear end (hot ass booty are the words she actually used) and my keen dancing skills...it was probably the coolest compliment I have ever received from a women. Mad props to secure women who arent afraid to compliment another woman!!! So basically, the evening was pretty typical...singing with the band, dancing like its our job, drinking like we cant stop, and getting hit on by guys who could really use a refresher course on "Lines that actually might work".  We intorduced Mel's Mother, to the wonderful world of turbos...she'll never be the same again!  $124.00 later, we were out of there. I somehow convinced the rest of the girls to skip out on our usual trip to Buckwheats, and just head home. From all the drinking and dancing, I was hella looking forward to getting some zzzzzzz's...but not until after our traditional "after the bar meal". As always, I served chicken...and shrimp...and peanutbutter and crackers...a little something for the 3 of us! Best part of the evening was the interactions we had with the band...by far! They even dedicated a few songs to us and made sure we were present for our favorite songs! They are a whole bunch of fun, and worth the $3.00 cover charge! Thanks guys! Hey, you should come check them out! December 19, 2003 @ Whiskers in Easthampton, MA.  Speaking of fantastic bands...somehow we are managing to go out two Saturdays in a row...but only because the guys of  urlLink Hot Lunch  will be heading to our hot spot - My 3 Sons in Southampton, MA on the 22nd of this fine month of November...see you there! Looking ahead...if anyone is up for seeing a GREAT comic...my Uncle (JUST GEORGE) is playing his annual Happy Hour show @ Ronnie's in Holyoke on Thanksgiving Eve...with any luck, it will be a ruffie free show!

      And so passes another wonderful Thanksgiving. As with every year, I traveled to the Eastern part of this fine state and spent the day with 'Bobby' and family...drank, ate, and caught up on each others lives. And as always...we all ended up on couches and chairs waking eachother up with our own snorring!   And today...its black Friday. Some crack heads were actually lined up at the mall at 3am! Seriously now, the sales are not that good. I am almost glad that I have to work today. I would hate to be sucked in to such a shopping cluster fuck.

      As most of you already know, the past week has been a rough one for me. I am really looking forward to life going back to normal...or whatever it was before last week. If there is one thing I have learned from all this, its that life is never what you expect it to be. Live your life today, because tomorrow may never come. Change comes in and swoops us off out feet when we least expect it. Its unfortunate that it takes death and tragedy for me to realize, that I have a lot of unfinished business, a lot of explaning, and a lot of things to do before its too late. Overdue apologies, long awaited hugs, amongst many other things. I am determined to turn all these negatives in to positives....somehow.

      Thank God for Friday. This week has been far too long and I am certainly looking forward to a quiet weekend at home, bundled up on the couch watching the snow fall. I guess its estimated that we will get about a foot...I can handle that I guess.  On the recommendation of a co-worker (Good ole Will), I watched Monthy Python and the Holy Grail for the first time ever last night. And he was right, friggen hysterical. I couldnt even get through the opening credits without laughing (with many furry animals!). I recommend it to all who have yet to see it...its worth it.   20 more days until Christmas....maybe I should start my Christmas shopping?

      How Albee knows Christmas is here:  -the dollar amount in my check book is smaller and smaller -my friends children are being especially good during our visits -dry cleaning bill from having the dresses cleaned because I am the "instant Christmas party date"  (2 down, 2 to go) -The Annual Army Ball -the stack of Holiday greeting cards in my mail box every day when I get home from work -christmas music on the radio, in the elevators, on tv, christmas music EVERYWHERE

      British novelist Evelyn Waugh once said, "One forgets words as one forgets names. One's vocabulary needs constant fertilisation or it will die." Editors at MSN Learning & Research picked some of their favorite words to nourish your vocabulary. Some of them you may even use.   1. Defenestrate: "throw somebody or something out of window: to throw something or somebody out of a window (formal or humorous)"   It is quite entertaining to defenestrate paper airplanes. 2. Garbology: "study of waste materials: the study of a cultural group by an examination of what it discards"  Garbology might be a good career choice for dumpster divers. Recycling may make the job of future garbologists extremely difficult--they'll have less to study.  3. Digerati: "computer experts: people who have or claim to have a sophisticated expertise in the area of computers, the Internet, and the World Wide Web"   Not too long ago, computer expertise was considered nerdy. These days, many people strive to be among the digerati.  4. Antipodes:          1. "places at opposite sides of world: places at opposite sides of the world from each other, or the areas at the side of the world opposite from a given place"          2. "opposites: two points, places, or things that are diametrically opposite each other"  One could say that Arthur "Fonzie" Fonzarelli and Warren "Potsie" Weber are antipodes.  5. Hallux: "first digit on the foot: the big toe on the human foot, or the first digit on the hind foot of some mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians (technical)"   The ballerina had her hallux insured for $10 million!  6. Otiose:           1. "not effective: with no useful result or practical purpose"           2. "worthless: with little or no value"           3. "lazy: unwilling or uninterested in working or being active (archaic)"  Will e-mail render traditional letter writing otiose? Let's hope not.  7. Cullet: "glass to be recycled: broken or waste glass returned for recycling"  Don't forget to take the cullet out to the curbside, and be sure to put it next to the trash, not in it.  8. Pellucid:          1. "clear in meaning: easy to understand or clear in meaning (formal)"         2. "transparent: allowing all or most light to pass through (literary)"    The police officer's warning was pellucid: drivers must go the speed limit in the school zone.  9. Borborygmus: "stomach rumble: the rumbling sounds made by the movement of gases in the stomach and intestine (technical)"   If you lay your head on someone's stomach, you are likely to hear borborygmus.  10. Embrangle: "perplex somebody: to confuse, perplex, or entangle somebody or something (archaic)"   As Lord Needlebottom attempted to explain the rules of cricket, his American friends became more and more embrangled.

      For years now...I have loathed winter. The snow, cold, holidays...all of it. My friends have even coined me 'the Grinch'. But I think its safe to say that I am in love with winter again. The snow storm was just amazing - watched movies, played in the snow, drove around, drinks with Mel...it was great. Lets put it this way...when I was 20-years old I bought a kick ass pair of boots from AE and never actually put them on because I wanted nothing to do with the snow. Well, those boots have officially been broken in!  I have to note, that Pirates of the Carribean is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. I typical stay clear of movies like that, but I was extremely impressed with the entire movie. And Johnny Depp....yummy! Next on the list was The In-Laws, with Michael Douglas...another great laughing movie.

      2003 has really been an adventerous year...one I wont soon forget...so here I am going to list some of the many things I will always remember about you 2003!!!! I know...arent you excited!!!???   -My waitressing job @ Glory Days (Easthampton, MA)   I know what  you are thinking...whats so great about her old waitressing job? Well, It was pretty short lived - February to June...but I met some of the most incredible people there. After hours @ The Pasco, girls nights out, closing the bar, the infamous Shawn Klosek, garlic glory wings, the everlasting friendships, the ones that faded fast...it was a job that forever changed my life!  -Graduating from college   I know...it was about time. I could have never imagined the pride I would be filled with when I actually finished. Moreso, the pride my family had for me. I'll never forget that day...walking in (front of the line mind you...yah, I am cool), cell phone in hand, trying to figure out where my family was sitting in that sea of family and friends. And seeing all my family there, waving down at me...it literally brought tears to my eyes.   -Watching my baby sister graduate from high school   I know...I am such a sucker for sap crap...but it really was great. She has always been this little girl in my mind...that needed me...and there she was...sitting on that commencement stage, laughing, smiling, and gleeming with joy. Not only did she end up at a fantastic college (Johnson & Wales - RI), but she is doing great! Deans list baby, yeah!  -Finding a great "first job"   Hard work does pay off...don't let anyone EVER tell you different. Those 11 months of unpaid work at the Sheriff's Department scored me an amazing job right after graduation (or about 3 weeks later). Not only was I personally reffered from prominent employees at the Sheriff's Department...but I got the job! I could hardly believe it. I work with amazing people, who have become so much more to me then just co-workers. But more along the lines of mentors and friends.   -Bruce Springsteen @ Fenway Park   Holy shit...what an experience. Bruce...in the outfield under the green monster with my Dunkarooni...it was friggen amazing. Although he didnt play a couple of my favorite songs...but I forgave him for that! ;) Not to mention the drinks and laughs with Dee before the show...  -My first apartment roommate free   My mother had always told me how much she simple loved living alone. And after having roommates ever since I moved out from under Mom's roof, it had seemed time for me to try it on my own. It took me months of contemplating and deciding whether I really wanted to do it all on my own. Seriously...I looked in those real estate ads for 4 months before I bit the bullet and did it (and FYI, go through a rental agency...you pay a stiff fee, but you'll find that it is worth it). But its a great feeling...coming home at night to my own place. There is really nothing like it. I miss sharing the bills, but its worth it. Every time I have a crappy day at work and I am able to come home, turn off the phones, hop in the tub, and be absolutely alone...I remember that it is worth it.  Some other highlights of 2003:  -beers in the grad lounge w/ TJ -weekends in Boston w/  urlLink Tha Queen Dee  -the party after the graduation party...I'll never tell! -Odetta, a piano, and a small room...I still get chills thinking about it -D Mission -Summer 2003, Thursday nights on the deck w/ Dunk -Kaeroke VFW style -Bobby and Cecily....finally -Movie nights on the couch with Tatee -Chris and the cocky Worcester Cops -watching Cassidy become a vibrant, beautiful little girl -Jimmy Buffett 2003 (just as great as every other year...only this time I won $50!)  With 2004 fast approaching, I cant help but wonder...what will be? They say that how you spend your New Year's Eve is how you will spend the rest of your year...well if all goes according to plan...my year will be spent surrounded by my dearest friends, my beloved family, and my favorite bottle of Merlot...

      Whew...peanut butter bars, and 5 batches of my famous cookies later...and I am pooped. Over the past two nights I have been baking like Martha to prepare gift tins for my co-workers...thank goodness I don't have a lot of coworkers! Of course one batch was ruined because that handy new timer I bought bit the bullet during the last batch...but overall, they came out wonderful...and quite yummy according to my younger sister who took it upon herself to sneek one when ever I wasnt looking!  Less then 2 shopping days left...are you done? Fortunately, I am. Usually I end up at the mall on Christmas Eve, but not this year! I took the smart route and took an entire day off of work and tackled everyone on my 'nice' list.   To everyone...have a great holiday...whatever it may be that you are celebrating...ENJOY!

To find the perfect cheeseburger in paradise  To calm the voices in my head to a dull roar  To witness my best friend giving birth and not let it gross me out  To actually save money instead of just talking about it  To clean out the boxes in the basement  Start a petition to ban 'Bobs Discount Furniture' commercials  Spam spammers  To stop being such a wuss and finally pony up the dough to have my ex bumped off  To convert atleast 2 democrats to the republican side  ( I swear on all that is good, that it isnt my resolution...although...)  To convince that  urlLink hypochondriac  that she is not alergic to cheese, she doesn't have mad cow disease, and she definitely does not have the flu...  Out with the old and in with the new!   To finally tell him that I love him  I resolve to spend more time doing things I like, rather then spending all my time doing what I get paid for  To spend some time thinking of all the stupid things I have done, and never do them again  To be as big as Vin Diesel by next Christmas  To get a fucking job  To finish school with a 4.0 in May

This past weekend was a football full weekend no doubt....there was some serious football watching, gin drinking, tons of wings eating, and just plain chaos this weekend with the good ole crew...it felt almost like one of those kick ass house parties I used to have when my mother was away...except we were all of legal drinking age and this time I was the one with the head injury from trying to wrestle Mark...ah, the good ole days!  Now, my SARS rant...I am pretty pissed off. I was suppose to be heading to Beijing this March to hike the Great Wall and fly a kite in Tian'anmen Square...but now it looks as though that wont be happening...damn you SARS....DAMN YOU!

      Boy am I glad that I get my lip gloss  urlLink here   I dont know if all this is factual or not...but it makes one think alrighty....   Even if you wear lipstick infrequently, this is good info to have  and share with others who you may know that wear these particular brands.  Lipstick Test   Brands don't mean everything...  Lead is a chemical which causes cancer. Recently a brand called, "Red  Earth" decreased their prices from $67 to $9.99 ........... It contained lead.  The Brands which contain Lead are:  1. Christian Dior  2. LANCOME  3. CLINIQUE  4. Y.S.L  5. ESTEE LAUDER  6. SHISEIDO   7. RED EARTH (Lip Gloss)   8. CHANEL (Lip Conditioner)   9. Market America-Motives lipstick   The higher the lead content, the greater the chance of causing  Cancer.  After doing a test on lipsticks, it was found that the Y.S.L.  lipstick contained the most amount of lead. Watch out for those lipsticks  which are supposed to stay longer. If your Lipstick stays longer, it is  because of the higher content of lead.   Here is the test you can do yourself:  1. Put some lipstick on your hand,  2. Use a 24k-14k Gold ring to scratch on the lipstick.  3 If the lipstick color changes to black then you know the lipstick  contains lead.

      Is there really anything better then getting together with 3 of your best gal friends and hitting up a local kaeroke bar?   The girls and I ventured out to Ludlow this past weekend, The Lighthouse to be exact. There was drinks, shots, a lot of singing (you hear right, that damn DJ somehow got a drunk Albee to sing Cher), pool playing, and of course, a little man handling ;)  Sarah's new nickname is going to have to be Cupid! I believe we made it home for 4am...after 2 rolls of film and everyone eating cheeseburgers on Jenny's kitchen floor...without a doubt, a successful night!  I have to say, I have not really been venturing out that often on weekends...but with not going out as often, it makes it that much better when I actually do go out. Thanks girls...another page in the memory book!!!!

      In a recent article on  urlLink MSN , A Doctor listed certain foods that all people should eat:  Beans  Blueberries  Broccoli  Oats  Oranges  Pumpkin  Salmon  Soy  Spinach  Tea (green or black)  Tomatoes  Turkey  Walnuts  Yogurt   He continued to say: "When incorporated into your regular daily diet, these foods, says Pratt, can stop some of the changes that lead to diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, Alzheimer's, and some cancers."  Is it just me, or does everything either cause cancer, cure cancer, or both?

Believer or not, what's your favorite superstition?       -None  4. Do you believe in luck? If yes, do you have a lucky number/article of clothing/ritual?       -In a way, yes. Lucky number = 3  5. Do you believe in astrology? Why or why not?        -Not really, but I always read my horoscope

      How many times can older, unattractive business men sitting near me at the hotel bar use the line "So there sweetheart, you here on business or pleasure?", or the timeless, "Where did you come in from", or even better, "Does your husband mind you traveling all alone?".  Don't they get the hint that all my one word answers mean I am not in the mood to chat? I just wanted to scream, "SEE THIS BIG BOOK IN FRONT OF ME? I AM STUDYING IT! LEAVE ME BE!!!!!" Ugh, oh well...not all of business traveling is bad...for instance:  -someone else making my bed every day -room service -hotels with sweet ass gyms and steam rooms -that sexy young fine fella who just done flew in from Alabama down the hall -excellent little diner across the corner for lunch every day -meeting amazingly wonderful people who share simillar interests -learning a wealth of information in 3 days -ice machines -little chocolates on my pillow -breakfast buffett -wake up calls

      Yah know what I love? A Monday that is so busy that when you finally get caught up and even get a chance to glance at the clock, its already 4pm...  So what is up with this weather? Sunday I was tooling around in capri pants and sandals...I even fell asleep with my living room windows open. Boy was I in for a shock of cold when I departed from my bedroom this morning to crack the shades in the living room...friggen snow!!!! I could hardly believe it...you and me Mother Nature...we gots a few things to be talkin about!  Well, the count down begins...in exactly one week I will be hoping on a plane for the long flight to Beijing China...I am so excited yet so nervous at the same time. Its hard to believe that just in a matter of days these little toes will be on the Great Wall of China...I wonder if they'll have green beer in China...oh well, its not like I drink beer anyway!

      I am finally starting to feel normal again...things are basically caught up at work, the clothes are out of the suitcases, the laundry is done! My house is still a mess, but I am getting there!  Adjusting to the time again has been hard...China is about 13 hours ahead of us...so most of the time during the day I am feeling as though it were morning...very early in the morning...the night before last I got a pretty good nights sleep and woke up on time...but last night was another crappy sleep night (well, to be honest I was distracted by a cute boy, but that is another story!) and a late wake up.  So you have already seen the itinerary for the trip (if not, check out the old entries in my blog) so I am pretty sure you are aware of where I went...everything was fantastic...by far, the most amazing was the Great Wall...I was there and I still hardly believe it. The hike up seriously kicked all of our asses...it is much harder then it looks.  The people in China were great. They were so fascinated by me and my mother (tall blondes, they just don't get many of those over there I guess). Many people stopped us to take pictures with us or tried to be stealth about getting us in pictures...it was hysterical.  Shopping...the markets are awesome. Everything can be bartered for - which was great for a shop-o-holic like myself. I spent barely any money and came home with a ton (we even had to buy new backpacks to fit some of our new things in).  So much is happening in Beijing right now...with their preparations for the Olympics...construction seems to be happening everywhere. I believe they are attempting to put up 500 new hotels...it was either 300 or 500, cant quite remember. They are also relocating many locals out of their impoverished housing in to new apartments...sadly they are tearing down the historical 'eyesores'. Some see it as a good thing, some see it bad. I hope to return to Beijing after the Olympics to see what changes will stick, if anything at all.   So I am in the process of getting pictures online,  urlLink here is the start...

      After  urlLink this article  I got to thinking...well actually, I have been thinking it ever since I entered in to a field where I continually deal with peoples addictions... What Doctor in their right mind is precribing oxycontins to their patients???  Seriously now...there are far less addictive medications out there for pain...anyone who is not in a hospital should not be using it. Oxy's are so strong and so addictive you cant blame the people for getting abusive with them and going through extreme measures to get it...ok, well they do have to accept some responsibility, but it really doesnt shock me to hear stories like these any more... Then of course you have the addicted person moving on to heroin from things like Oxy's because its easier to get... urlLink then all of a sudden they are trading heroin for guns in NH....    urlLink More good info

      Ever had one of those super long days, that by the time you get to bed you barely have the energy to change your clothes? After a long Easter day with the fam, driving my kid sis back to school (J WOOOOO), I could barely keep my eyes open as I trapesed in to my apartment. But then of course, the second I laid down and snuggled up with Floppy the bear, my eyes were wide open and I was completely uncomfortable. Ugh...that drives me nuts. And it happens alot. No matter how tired I am, sometimes I just cannot sleep once I lay down.  So I am tossing and turning, stretching and reaching, then all of a sudden it was like "aaaahhhhhhhhh". And I just passed out. It was like I reached the perfection of comfort...it felt so damn good...I will spend the rest of my life trying to find that perfect comfort level!!!!

      What a birthday! This was without a doubt, the best birthday I have had in a very long time. Besides the great gifts I received from family and friends, the highlight was definitely going out on Saturday. Birthday headquarters was at Silk City, and most of the night was spent there until we decided to do last call at Buckwheats (it was such a bad idea, yet great idea at the same time). Highlights:  -waitress giving me free drink coins, I think I have enough for a collection -dancing with my favorite people -BAM! Bazooka Joe! Someone should cut Megan off of the Red Bull -finding out that hottie is a dirtbag doesnt stop him from being hot -doing every shot in existence (not really, but my stomach surely feels so) -DJ shout outs -people really pulling through for me and making sure everything went well -drunk dialing my mother at 1am to tell her that a Patsy Cline song was on the juke box  now I just have to work on making this hangover go away!

      What sad news to take in today...beloved former President Ronald Reagan passed away. He was more then just a person, or just a President...he was a great American institution...a man who helped shaped my own political arena...a great man who will truly be missed.   "When people tell me I became president on January 20, 1981, I feel I have to correct them. You don't become president of the United States. You are given temporary custody of an institution called the presidency, which belongs to our people." — Address to the Republican national convention. Aug. 15, 1988   Rest in Peace President.

      So as it turned out...Michael Moore has had footage of the prisoner abuse in Iraq for quite some time now, and claims he didnt release it because he thought the public might think he released it to promote his "movie" (if you can even call it that)...in my own opinion:  Michael Moore = Dirtbag  Why didnt he do something with it? Report it to someone?   Great...Michael Moore could have brought attention to this serious issue much sooner, but instead held the information back to protect his own image...yeah, what a good guy...   urlLink story here

      Originally posted by  urlLink JimK  on  urlLink Moorewatch.com   Something that has been in the back of my mind all weekend just came to the forefront with clarity.  I thought I would share it with you.   First of all, by ALL measures, F911 is a success.  Let’s just get that out of the way up front.  It’s a media and commercial success, and will make Moore, F.A.G. and Lion’s Gate a lot of money.  And I’m happy for them...capitalism is my favorite thing behind sex and eating.  :)   But let’s talk about PR.  Buzz.  The word on the street, if you will.  What has this weekend been about?  Moore selling out theater after theater, companies being forced to add screening, etc.   Why?   Because the film opened on a limited number of screens, that’s why.   It’s easy to create buzz surrounding a movie that everyone knew was going to be popular the first few weeks of release...all you have to do is limit the screens.  That way, people have to clamor to get in.  If F911 had opened on 2000 screens, the theaters would be half empty.  Instead, it opens on 868 screens, and the buzz is instantly generated.    urlLink Take a look at this list . Notice that EVERY OTHER FILM that has made more than a million bucks this past weekend played on 2000 screens or better.  Garfield The Movie, which is universally despised by anyone with a brain in their head, played on 2882 screens this weekend.  I can’t even imagine a world where anyone who has ever been to a movie, much less people like the Weinsteins and Lion’s Gate, would expect Garfield The Movie to be THREE TIMES more popular in it’s 3rd weekendthan F911 on opening weekend.   Once again, Moore and Co. are manipulating reality.  Is the film popular?  Of course it is!  Was there a need for people to wait in line?  Of course not.  They could simply have negotiated a wider release.  Theaters all over the country would be glad to dump the losers on the list like Chronicles of Riddick or Stepford Wives, and show a movie that is actually making money.   But that wouldn’t create the buzz, would it?    urlLink Just look at the numbers yourself.  You don’t need me to tell you what kind of game is being played here.  When Troy, a movie that was panned by almost everyone and made a lousy 300 grand this weekend, is playing on almost the same number of screens as F911…   You are being played.

       The following was originally published at   urlLink IMAO   Some are saying that Fahrenheit 9/11  urlLink set records for a documentary , being the first ever to debut in the number one spot and already having the highest gross for a documentary with $21.8 million over the weekend. I looked it up, though, and it is total bunk. If marginally staged events filmed for entertainment value is what makes a documentary, then Jackass: The Movie actually set those records. It debuted at number one  urlLink with a gross of $22.8 million . It also had less erroneous assertions than a Michael Moore documentary.  Yeah, that's right; we're the blogosphere and we'll fact-check your ass (and with Michael Moore, that's a - ah, forget it; obvious joke).  UPDATE: The adjusted gross of Fahrenheit 9/11’s opening is higher than Jackass’s, but Jackass still was a documentary that premiered at number one before Michael Moore's film (one record claimed) and it still has a higher total gross for a documentary ($64.2 million) than Moore's film (the other record mentioned in the article cited; it falsely says that Bowling for Columbine with $21.6 million total gross previously held that record).  I'm not claiming to be an authoritative source; I'm just making the more meager claim that I'm more authoritative than CNN and Michael Moore.  UPDATE 2: Anyone who disputes me is a goober. Yeah, I mean you, goober.  If you still don't believe in my fact-checking ability, just see all the great facts I compiled on Michael Moore  urlLink here .  UPDATE 3: Best of the Web  urlLink points out , that, if you adjust for inflation, Jackass: The Movie ties Fahrenheit 9/11 for its opening take. That makes me extra-super-right about everything and all who doubts me that much more of a goober.  Whether Fahrenheit 9/11 will have the long lasting political effects of Jackass is yet to be seen.

      Recently I have been witness to this new revolution of 'brushing without brushing'. Many well known toothbrush and toothpaste companies seem to be coming out with various methods of brushing those pearly whites and eliminated that stank mouth anytime anywhere without having to carrying around a toothbrush or toothpaste. Or as they refer to it as: "On The Go Oral Care".  So I went out and bought some  urlLink Oral B Brush Ups , and gave them the ole' test run. Much to my surprize, I loved them! They really do make your mouth feel refreshed. They come in small little packages, easily fitting into a pocket or purse!  I only wish I had this for all those mornings doing the 'Walk Of Shame' back in college!

      Am I the only one who thinks its ridiculous and an embarassment to our judicial system that they are sentencing Martha Stewart to jail? Here is my logic:  &nbsp;  Some time ago, the word "prison" was for all attentive purposes, replaced by the words "House of Correction". Why, you may ask? Because H.O.C.'s are suppose to take certain individuals out of society to protect those in society and offer treatment and programming to help correct criminal and/or addictive personalities. Alternative sanctions have been created (house arrest, residential treatment programs, community service, fines, intensive probation, etc.) for those individuals who are convicted of crimes who are not a direct threat to society. There are far better ways to impose punitive consequences.  Do we need protecting from Martha Stewart? No, we don't. Its a waste of the tax payers money to incarcerate Martha Stewart.

      Did everyone get that email that was going around about the mother and daughter and the yellow shirt? It was one of those sappy emails, that you usually get half way through and toss in the trash folder...well, I had already received it 30 times, so it was going in the trash usually before even opening. Well, I spent some time today in my mother's basement going through personally belongings and the never ending bags of old clothes I have stored down there. (My poor mother...she has got more of her childrens junk down there cluttering her basement...she ought to charge us rent). In the middle of my mess, we came upon a storage container of my mothers old clothes.&nbsp; And as we began pulling them out, I realized just how many memories can be found in the clothing of my mother. That old winter jacket that she wore when zipping us kids off to school when we were too lazy to walk in the snow after she had worked a 12 hour over night shift...that one skirt suit she would wear that made her look like the most beautiful woman on earth...that faux leather purse that reminded me how fashion forward she was in the 80's...the endless supply of short summer dresses that she sported for many summers out on the Cape...I have to admit it...it made for an enjoyable time cleaning...
