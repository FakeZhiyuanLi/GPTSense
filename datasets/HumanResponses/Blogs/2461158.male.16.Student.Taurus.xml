       Well, I'm at North Vernon Indiana and havin' a great time! We got here Friday afternoon and pretty much just unpacked and hung out. Saturday Uncle Randy took Gael and I up in his plane and even let us fl it a bit, that was great. When we got home in the afternoon we got to ride the horse, Foxy. Aunt Marla got Isaac all dressed up in cowboy clothes and he was riding around all over the place it was great. Sunday we had a nice worship service and just rested, until the evening when we watched a movie. Today Uncle Randy took Papa, Gaelan and I to the Indianapolis 500 Speedway. It has a museum in the infield, which was pretty cool. We got lots of cool pictures that'll I'll have to put up on my website. We also went to a big war monument and got some cool pictures of that too. While we did that Isaac and Shayna went with mama and aunt Marla to a childrens museum. This evening aunt Marla made us sit in the living room while she prepared a suprise. Well she had set the table with weird stuff for us to eat with. Like I got a big bowl for a plate, a pale for a cup, a straw for a fork that kinda stuff. It was hilarious, we all had to wear bibs and we got some weird stuff. Shayna got a baby bottle to drink with, ect. We got pictures so don't worry I'll put those pictures up too. Well I'm gonna go spend some time with the fam. So happy holidays from Steven in Indiana!

Sunday had a great worship service and time with friends. Monday I went out suit shopping with Gael and my dad. We also got some things for our trip. That was about it for Monday. Tuesday we went to Target cause we had got some gift cards for thanksgivng. I got the Two towers, the Pirates of the Carribean, and the Meteora cds. So that was good, we also got a digital camera while we were there so now I have to update my website right? That night we also got a couple of gifts so that we could use 'em before our trip. We also baked cookies that afternooon. Well this morning we iced the cookies. Took Cortez over to the Miller's so they could watch him. Messed with there playstation and finally got it to work so that Heidi and I could race... she beat me. That was fun but we didn't get to stay long enough. When we got home we got ready to go over to a christmas party that was alot of fun. We went caroling around the neighborhood and it was cold but fun. Well I gotta get some rest. Tomorrow were off to Indiana for a week. So It'll be awhile before I post again.

       First off sorry this is so late, there's the whole me being sick and all. But Tuesday came and has gone. That was one of the greatest days of my life! Well we had everybody but the Mosses stay at our house the night before just in case we had to get to the theater real quick. We got there at 7 am and stood inline for three hours. That by itself was great, then we got to go in the theater and sit down and wait for three more hours. But that was great we had soo much fun. Seeing the movies again in the theater with friends was awesome and then came the Return of the King! Oh wow that was good... I even cried. Oh and now it's all over, all that waiting and now it's gone. Well we'll have to do it again, maybe if Peter Jackson comes out with the Hobbit? So yeah I'll have great memories of that day for years and years to come. Well that's enough ranting for now. L8r.  "That still only counts as one!" wow Legolas sure can rack em up!

       Okay first off the reason why I didn't write my blog last night was because someone stole the computer. So you can blame HIM. You know who I'm talking about. Okay well yesterday we rented an awesome game. Gael and I had so much fun. It's a world war II game so Gaelan and I were having sniper wars. Heh heh, yeah fun fun. So that was all that really happened yesterday. Today has been pretty good so far, except for something that I can't talk about. Aarghh. Well I'll write more later if any thing of note happens. L8r.

       Okay so nothing of real note today until the evening. Gael and I got to Boy Scouts early so he could show me how to use a standard, and I don't mind saying that I did pretty darn well. Didn't stall out once, Hazah! Well the meeting was great, we had a party to celebrate everything over the last year. Watched a slide show, got nifty scout mugs and had snacks. So one of our best meetings ever I'd say. Well I'm just sittin' around now, I have to go to bed soon cause I need to get up on time tomorrow. Buenos noches!

Gael and I took the Moss boys to the Miller's to watch the Two Towers extended edition. That was so much fun, ha ha we would have killed mr. Miller if he was there, we talked sooo much. When we got home we watched the Bourne Identity with Chris and Tim and got to bed at like 3. Saturday we got a Christmas tree and it was   Freakin' cold   outside! Well we got it home and decorated and now it looks all pretty and stuff etc. etc. Let's see now today after church we had the Sanchezs over. We had sooo much fun! We played pictionary, fun fun.

       Well! It's been forever since I've written on this I am so sorry for keeping you all in suspense. Ha ha just kidding. Well I don't think I'm gonna write about everything that's happened in the past month so I'll just write about the important stuff. Let's see..... We had a great Christmas at Indiana. Lot's of fun, hoping I'll get to go back soon. I've been just doing pretty normal stuff. Contra dancing... sooo much fun, school sooo not fun. Having some great fellowship with Chris and Tim after church. I've decided to learn the piano. I've wanted to play something for so long and since we have a piano I figured I'd do that. I won't be as great as most people who started when they were young but I wanna be able to play something.  Right now I'm waiting for the UPS man to come with our air soft guns... heh heh *evil grins*. Man my mind is a total blank. Well tonight my family and I are going to Heather's concert performance. That'll be fun seeing everybody at least almost everybody. And hopefully I won't keep you guys waiting so long for the next entry. Till then! Up, up and awaaaaaaaay!!!

       Hello, hello. Been awhile... so I'm guessing you wanna know what's been happening lately. So let's see I'll start with last Saturday I guess. Well we had contra dancing that night despite the absence of the Mosses, Heather and Danielle. So we had a great time, the guys weren't too outnumbered. Afterwards we came back to the house I got to play the Sanchez's in some connect four, ha ha that was fun. First I played misses Sanchez (and won) then I played Sarah a couple of times, I beat her a couple of times but she got me once. Ha ha then I played Elizabeth... the first game I set it up so that at the end she couldn't make a move without me winning so she was like "I want a rematch!". We played a bunch of games both winning and losing it was so much fun.  The Sanchez's and Jen ended up sleeping over so they could come to church with us the next day. We had a nice service and all with some great conversations afterwards. The Break dancing cups! woo hoo! ha ha, oh boy. So let's see this week: Well Monday I pretty much killed myself. I dont know how but I hurt my neck so bad I had to lay on the heating pad the whole day! I couldn't move my head at all, it was awful. The next day it was a little better but I still had to spend the majority of the day laying down. Well that night Gael and I rented Signs. Heard it was a good movie Sunday. Yikes! Near the end I was wondering how it could have a good ending? But it was all good in the end. Needless to say I jumped a couple of times. Wednesday not much out of the ordinary happened. Oh yeah by the way my dad had to leave for Mississippi Tuesday because his aunt died. So yeah that was kinda weird him leaving real quick. He got back late last night. So now it's today and were trying to get friends to go see a movie Saturday but I'm not sure how that will turn out. Oh yeah before I go... I have discovered the origin of the infamous "woot woot!" I had a dream and in it I was watching Star Wars: A new hope, and when Obi- wan sees the death star and says "that's no moon." Han solo goes "woot woot!" And I was like "whoa! so thats where we got it from". so yeah anyways I gotta go. I'll post within the next month or so, ha ha. L8r

       Wow it's been awhile. Sorry to everybody who reads this, I'm just... what's that word? Oh yeah, lazy. Ha ha... well anyways, what have I been up to lately you ask? Well I've been really working hard on my drawing lately. I did two last week that I'm really happy with. Monday I went iceskating with most of the people reading this, ha ha lol. That was so much fun!  We all gotta do something like that again sometime. Let's see afterwards my family and I spent the rest of the day with the Sanchezs. We had alot of fun hangin' out at their house and that evening we went and watched Elizabeth's hockey practice. It was tons of fun, ha ha and Sarah gave me a violin lesson, ha ha thanx Sarah. Well I think that's all I'm going to write right now I'm kinda tired. So farewell for now!  Hyah!

       Well Monday was my birthday. It's really weird when I stop to think that I'm now 16. It's just like... whoa. Let's see I'll star with last Thursday, that's when we celebrated. We had a fun family dinner, ya know me, pizza...... and other part food stuffs. Then I unwrapped my gifts. I got a Star Wars book, a book on medieval swordsmanship, a book on how to use Nunchakus, Unreal Tournament 2004 (a video game),and a Star Wars board game. I'm also getting a sword but it's back ordered and I won't get it till June.... So that night we played with my game I looked at my books, spent like an hour installing UT2004... so that was a great day. Friday I had to get ready for my campout. I don't think much else happend then except for David coming over to spend the night so we could take him to the campout the next morning. So, Saturday I get up at 4a.m. make sure I'm already and we go to meet the rest of the grooup at the Yoder Dairy... and like usual everyone else is late. So we sit around for a few minutes and some other guys get there. Well once everybody was there we loaded up and got on the road. We drove for four hours up to Assoteauge Maryland, you know the island with all the wild horses? We got there and loaded up the canoes and we were off! We canoed... and canoed for like three hours. Some places it was so shallow that we had to get out and pull our canoes. Well once we finally get to the campsite we are immediately attacked by ticks the size of small trailer homes. Jonathan Gill got like 3 the firs second we were there. Well once we were all set up we just hung around for the rest of the time. I peeled tons of carrots and potatoes for dinner.... yeah, fun stuff. After dinner me and a bunch of other guys walked to the other sside of the island to the ocean.... wow. Where I live going to the beach is just like the bay. It was awesome. It was getting dark and the fog was coming in so you couldn't tell where the horizon was, and the breeze was blowing uber hard. It was just so fun. I wish all of my friends could have been with me then. Well the next day (Sunday), after waiting forever for breakfast and having a smal worship service we packed up and went off.   The water was even lower!   so we pulled our canoes most of the way back to the parking lot and to make a long story short........ we were eaten by wild horses. No just kidding. We loaded kup our canoes and went home. Well I got home and found out that I was no longer human. I'm now more like one big sunburn. So I've pretty much crashed for the last couple of days. Gael got me my present today. It's this T-shirt with an old Nintendo controller on it that says "Know your roots" he he. So thanks to Gael! Well I'm sitting here thinkin I'm gonna play some Unreal Tournament so I guess I'll see most of you at the bonfire and to all the rest, I'll see you when I see you.

Yeah and I just got finished watching "Emma" with my mom... crazy woman, someone shoudda smacked her. Anywhoo, I figure I should go get some more rest so I'll be fit for game night friday!

       No you're not imagining things, this is in fact a post. Well it's been so long and so much has happened so I'm just gonna cover some current events. Last week was the Christian Worldview Student Conference... oh man... That was like freakin' awesome! I don't know how else to describe it. I had a great time with some of the best friends a guy could have. It was the best of times. It was the worst of times. An elephant! ha ha lol. (Ben's Haiku.) So yeah it was great. Hi to all my friend's from CWSC! So let's see there was CWSC all last week and then this week I started Driver's ED... yeah. This first day got me like all worried cause it seemed like it was gonna be tough but then it got better so I can't somplain. The homework is pretty time consuming though. So anyhoo... tonight is the men's meeting, and I still haven't read the chapter... crud. I guess I should go and do that now. So that's what's been happening in my life. Oh and by the way don't think this updating is gonna become like a regular thing ;) Laters!
