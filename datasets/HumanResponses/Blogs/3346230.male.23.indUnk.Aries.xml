      Ok, I give up, I give in, don't mind me as I roll over and die... can't believe I was convinced to start a blog...  For anyone who actually reads this, don't worry it won't last long but while it does I take no responsibility for the randomness that may result from me posting to this thing.   One of the reasons I was talked into doing this was so I could post any "odd" things that I find on the web here for the entertainment of others. In the spirit of that,    urlLink Penquin Cam   I'm convinced the penguins had to much to drink and are now passed out on their backs but if you see anything interesting let me know.   Part 2 of "reason to make a blog" is related to things that my roommate and I have decided would be amusing to do to everyday (more or less) items.  Just be thankful I'm broke and will probably never have the money to do any of the things we've thought of.  What I'm eventually going to do, whenever I figure it out, is keep a running list of the top ten (or so) things I think would be really fun to mess with and put it on the side of the page.  To start it of, today we decided that taking one of the new hybrids (prius, those civic things, or whatever else is out there now) and rice it out.  I'm really curious as to how well a prius would take to having a fart can strapped on it.  Also wondering how big of a stereo system you could put into one of those bad boys before you fry out the entire car.  What I would really like to see though, is a hybrid worked over to be a drag/street racer.  How great would it be to dust a mustang in your little prius.

      Spent the weekend down in Rhode Island with Shal, James and Lana. Fun stuff, ate like a king, went to Riverside during the day Saturday, rain managed to hold off, and I experienced what was possibly the most disgusting thing I've ever seen at a theme park.  First, I hate the fact that they've renamed riverside, the place used to have charm, now it just seems like another Disney knock-off pushing as much themed merchandise as possible.  I'm not going go into the disgusting part, figure some of you (one of the 2 or 3 people that read this) may be eating while you read this.  If you curious just ask, I'll tell you all about it...

      On one of my hour long coffee breaks and figured I'd kill some time by posting.  Its kinda funny, you'd think I'd be happy working a job that goes from 6am to 2:30 pm and includes between 3 and 4+ hours of break.  It is actually starting to drive me nuts.  I have realized that I would rather bust my ass all day and go home dead ass tired but at least the day will go by.  All this break stuff does is slow down the day.  Give me a lawnmower, point to a massive field, and tell me to cut till 2:30 and I think I'd be happy.  Course it may be that I just want something to bitch about...     Random Link   urlLink So who wants to help me build it?

      Well I originally warned that updates to this thing may be few and far between, but here goes anyway.     The day after my last post, the dsl service to my old apartment was prematurely cut.  Presumably because my ex-girlfriend (yes who I was still living with a year later, complete with her as of last week new husband) didn't bother to tell the dsl people not to kill it to the end of the month.  Bitching aside, since then I've got 5 more scuba dives into my dive book, finally fried the clutch on my car, been to a bitch ass cold graduation, went to a grad party and got serenaded (while eating lots of cake), gotten a job (thank you Gretchen) working for Plant services (decent pay, good hours, and a free pair of $100 dollar boots :) ), moved into a new apartment (more or less, not in the right room yet), gone to Rochester, New York to visit a very good friend that I haven't seen since last August, moved several people out of their apartments, said goodbye to some very good friends that I may not see for a very long time, and fallen behind on my IQP.  Now that we're all up to date, I'm going to bed so I can get up for 5:30 am to go to work :-p
