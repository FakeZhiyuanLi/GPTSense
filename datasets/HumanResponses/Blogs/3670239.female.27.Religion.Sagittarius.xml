      The paper that started it all: the personal statement. Some of it may sound very hokey and politician-like, but I guess that is what a personal statement is supposed to sound like. There is so much content that, I figure, you may never speak to me again. Heavy Sigh... jc  Faith: it is hard to describe, hard to put into words. It is “knowing” the unknowable, not needing physical proof, because, as far as one’s concerned, the proof is in plain sight. No one ever says, “I have faith that I will blink every 15 seconds,” or “I have faith that the sun will come up every day,” because these statements are provable givens. Faith implies an intense belief in an un-provable given, at least in my opinion. I have always known that I had it, even when life circumstances urged me to forget it.  Behind every musing of faith—every postulation, prostration, and testimony of it—is a declaration of love. What is faith without love? When one places intense belief in something, it is not because one wants to run away from it, but rather desires greatly to be near it and experience it. Such is the way I feel about God. It is more than a mere certainty, which is neutral. It is not probability, which varies. It is more certain than hope, than expectation. Faith is a positive certainty, an expectation I believe in with all my heart—a fulfillment of an intense desire.  My choice in life is to publicly declare my faith through ministry. Ever since I was very little, I knew my reason for being was to be in constant worship through activities that bring about connections among people and God. I realize that the only time I feel whole in spirit is when I am exalting God. I know that it must be the right time to live my faith and bring to others real love in action. I believe that this story begins when I was four years old. My mother recorded a conversation that we had about politics and the world on audiotape. She asked me what I wanted to be when I grow up, and my first response was “I get older when I push the button!” Mom laughed and asked me again. After a moment, I said, “when I grow up, I want to be a mercy.” Later in the tape, I mimicked a Ronald Reagan campaign slogan: “The time is now. Reagan for president!” My mother, a lifelong Democrat, responded immediately, “don’t endorse that man on my tape!”  The recorded conversation is only one example of how my mother had opened my eyes to the vast world around me. By contrast, my small world consisted of an extended family living in a small house: my grandparents, my aunt (who later brought her daughter Abeke home to live with us), my mother, and me. It did not take me long in my childhood to figure out that neither world was kind to a single-parent mother such as mine. My whole family, especially my mother, often had to sacrifice our own needs until we could make ends meet. Many Christmases, I received hand-me-downs as gifts. I was happy with the presents, because I thought that having Mom’s things made me more “grown-up,” but she always insisted I was worth more. She honestly tried her best to raise me with a sense of justice and worth. It is because of her that I am aware of the existence of unconditional love. Truly, I do not believe I would have come to know God if it were not for her sacrifices and her faith, even when her own spirit was tested.  My own spiritual test began while I was still a very young girl. Although many of the neighborhood kids were friends of my family, some of them did not even want as so much as to talk to me, only because I was light-skinned (my neighborhood was—and still is—a predominantly African-American suburban neighborhood). I have a vivid memory of trying to talk to a girl on her bike as she was riding in front of my family’s house. At the time, I was about five years old and had really no concept of racial differences. I ran up to her and said hello as she looked at me as if I were wasting her time. I touched one of her handlebars. She yelled “Don’t touch my bike, white girl!” After that, I ran back to the house in tears, very hurt as I was schooled in the “ways of the world.”  It was more of the same when I started school. My mother sent me to a private, Catholic elementary school in the hopes that I would escape the abuse that she and her siblings suffered in public school. The very damage that Mom wanted me to avoid, however, followed me every day. I was picked on, beaten up, pushed down the stairs. As with the girl on the bicycle, I was singled out because of my light skin. Even after my mother put me into another Catholic school, I was still teased and found that most of my peers (and some of my teachers) were hard to get along with. So after a while, I retreated into myself by just keeping quiet and focusing on the two things at school that mattered to me the most—my schoolwork and participating in liturgies. The contributions I loved the most were lectoring and singing with the choir. I loved making the Word come alive as I sensed that God was providing me with comfort and grace.  My focus on faith and academics paid off when I was accepted into  urlLink St. Ignatius , a Jesuit college prep school, but because I was on this brand new and much larger stage, my academic persistence started sinking. I was one kid of about one thousand in the whole school—I had never been in such a large place and I immediately started to feel lost and unremarkable. Slowly, I realized that the survival mechanism of “just keeping quiet” was not working anymore. Instead, I was the shy outsider—happy about being in this educational oasis, but awkward in communicating with anyone. My grades suffered, and I became depressed. For the first several years of high school, I had a few friends but barely spoke to anyone. The only way I expressed myself to the world was in writing poems and stories. As it turned out, writing would help carry me through the hard times yet to come.  The year 1994 was a year of loss for my family. My grandmother lost her niece during surgery and an old family friend was murdered. My aunt lost her husband (and father of her daughter Abeke) in a bus accident in Nigeria. The event that affected me most deeply that year occurred in April, when my grandfather, virtually the only father I had known, suffered a stroke. I thought he was going to die then and there, but he held on for another year. Naturally, these events were coupled with financial troubles that were so threatening that I almost had to leave school.  In the midst of these changes, I immersed myself in the volunteering I began the year before at  urlLink South Suburban Hospital , the same hospital my grandfather was admitted to. My functions were not very grand—pouring water for patients, feeding them, admitting and discharging them—but often I found myself simply talking to them and getting to know their stories. One woman, while waiting for a nursing assistant to take her for tests, told me how desperately lonely she felt after losing her husband. I stayed by her side, talking to her about her loss, even as she faced her own death. I began to sense from deep within me a desire to alleviate the loneliness and pain of others. I made a vow that, if I could help it, I would not let people suffer.  The next year, 1995, was a year of transition. That was the year I led my first retreat group. It was the sophomore retreat—mandatory for all sophomores, but a day off for the rest of the school. My junior-year co-leader and I took our group to the south side  urlLink Misericordia , a home for the mentally and physically disabled. My group encouraged me, even as I felt a bit awkward leading them at first. All of us learned something that day at Misericordia: despite severe challenges, happiness could belong to anyone—this was the place from where their strength and courage came. These were qualities I would need that very same evening. At 4:45 that day, my grandfather died of cancer. Truly, it took some resolve to survive a stroke and face a year of pain as he did, and I greatly came to respect him for that.  Attending college at  urlLink Loyola University Chicago  proved to be the biggest turning point in my spiritual life. When I began life at Loyola, I was struggling both academically and emotionally. Central to this strife was the new independence from my family. Although I had a roommate, I had never felt so totally alone. For two years, a deep depression sat over me as I tried to keep up my grades and involve myself in activities which, I had hoped, would gain me friends, or at least someone to talk to.  It was during the second half of my first year that I began singing in choir. At first I joined because it seemed a natural thing for me to do—I had been in choir from grade school to high school. It was something to do and a place to exercise both my voice and my social skills. I realized after a while that I loved the masses that we celebrated as we became one living Church, and I began to feel what I was singing in a way I never had before. New and beautiful emotions poured into and out of me as I sought a larger role in ministry.  I began participating in spring break service projects during my first two years at Loyola. I went on my most memorable project in my sophomore year in Tama, Iowa. Our group of students went to the  urlLink Meskwaki Indian Settlement  to observe and assist at the Meskwaki Indian School. Among the many activities we participated in, we had lunch with the grade school children, and watched them as they performed traditional dances. In the classrooms, we assisted the teachers with their regular activities. The children were generally warm and welcoming, but there were some who were shy and quiet. There were times, however, when each member of our service group captured the best out of the shy children. For instance, one child cried easily when separated from her mother and stayed to herself, not playing with anyone. Finally it was recess, and I took the opportunity to swoop behind her and scoop her up, spinning her in the air. It was then I finally saw her smile. Her picture, which one of the group leaders took while she was in my arms, captured her smile forever.  The greatest memories that I have from my ministry opportunities always remind me of the importance of community. I learned not only to serve, but also to solve—to not just watch, but participate and belong to something greater than myself alone. I began to realize that to construct lasting solutions, a community must work together. In Tama, the situation is still evolving. The Meskwakis are still struggling with issues stemming from the profits of the casino they own. For them, and for most Native Americans, difficulties continue to mount as they continue to grapple with corrupt tribal leaders and lack of consistent government support. Monies never get to where they are needed, and the most vulnerable must always sacrifice. I was drawn to working in this kind of environment, and believed that in some way I would live and work on a reservation. This became a short-term goal, and one I would accomplish a few years later.  I knew from my service projects that I wanted to be a full member of the Catholic Church. I did not truly set out to do this until my senior year. By then, I had participated in Catholic dialogue groups around campus and, energized by the opportunity to discuss and debate scripture, I decided to pursue my faith even further. Eventually, I helped lead a retreat and assisted in hosting a city-wide undergraduate Catholic discussion group about the death penalty. This was a great experience because I began to feel a renewed sense of mission and a confidence I never felt before. The speaker was especially striking: she was the mother of a murdered child. She felt mercy for her daughter’s killer. So driven by God she was and so sincere were her words. I felt from then on that I needed to affirm my faith.  My last year of college was one of the most hopeful times of my life. A true change took place in me as I accepted myself more than I had ever before. I was not afraid of speaking my mind and was less fearful of approaching people when I needed to, since I believed in myself as a person and became more confident of God’s love for me. My Confirmation and graduation added to my optimism and I looked forward to positive growth. Thus, I began my “adult” journey in the real world, and after my first job, I was led to another turning point little more than a year later. In June of 2000, after working for a year, I decided to volunteer on a Native American reservation. I pursued every avenue that would take me there, always examining myself to see if this was what I truly wanted. My Confirmation sponsor, who was also a Dominican sister and a good friend of mine, took me to the  urlLink Sinsinawa  motherhouse, the epicenter of the Midwest Dominican contingent. I got in contact with other sisters there who were familiar with a reservation school in  urlLink South Dakota  that constantly needed volunteers. Soon enough, I found myself in communication with the Apostolic Volunteers (AV) program. I also applied to other programs, such as  urlLink St. Francis School  in New Mexico, and a  urlLink Mercy Corps  site in Arizona. I was invited to join all of the programs, but my decision finally came down to where I felt I was needed the most—Pine Ridge, South Dakota.  Nervousness settled in as the date to fly to Pine Ridge drew closer. The superintendent, who was my contact at the school I would be working at, told me that my qualifications fit their open multimedia teacher position. My mind was pondering this “adventure,” but I never taught before! The short days of training I had prior to this experience were beneficial, but I still was not aware of what would lay ahead of me as I began this new chapter in my life.  South Dakota—a land so foreign to me because it was far removed from the urban setting I was used to. It was such a contrast for me that immediately after I landed I wondered if I were in the right place. I was not able to visit before I accepted the teaching assignment, so this was entirely new. Often I had to remind myself to place my trust in God.  The weather was very warm when I arrived at the Holy Rosary Mission, the place where I would reside. The mission was a campus that included the  urlLink Red Cloud Indian School , consisting of an elementary school, a middle school and a high school. I was well received by the community of sisters there, but it was still a bit awkward, as new beginnings usually tend to be.  From the start, I realized that there was an orientation the week before that I could not attend because I had to be present at the AV orientation. Thus, I came in missing the opportunity to get to know those I would be working with while they already had time to become acquainted. Secondly, it was required that participants in the AV program live together in trailers by the school, and they were closest to me in age, but separated from me by distance. The person closest to me in age in my community was forty years old.  I began to observe the beauty of Oglala Lakota culture right from the start. I attended a sweat lodge ceremony with other teachers, and learned the chant “Mitakuye Oyasin (all my relatives).” The ceremony itself was almost unbearable—the heat and smoke inside of the tent may be been sacred to our souls, but my body wanted to collapse! Listening to the chanting and singing, however, did pique my curiosity and calmed my spirit. As the days at Red Cloud progressed, I went to masses that included a drum group, hymns in Lakota, and smudging, where a place is purified with smoke. I witnessed holy Lakota-Catholic rituals and, most unfortunately, I beheld the Pine Ridge community in mourning.  My brief experience as a teacher was indeed very harrowing. The high school kids were challenging to teach, as they wanted to play and openly disrespect anyone older than they were. My teaching skills, which I did not have much practice with, were not very good (at that time, I barely understood what Photoshop 6.0 was, let alone teach it). I made a few enemies of students right away when I disciplined them on the second day. Often I was frustrated that I could not teach and almost gave up. This affected my relationship with both my peers and my community as I withdrew to work on lesson plans and to just be alone. Relating to people became difficult, and with those I lived, greeting them seemed more like a forced chore than an actual joy. The directors of the AV program were concerned about my malaise and told me that I had to be more of a community member, or else go home. This added to my pressure, and I did try to challenge myself more by rousing my spirit out of the fog I had wandered into. I prayed for a way to make the situation better. My saving grace turned out to be those I least expected: my students.  The ease with which the students talked with me rather surprised me. They felt like they could come to me with advice. I did my very best to steer them away from trivializing the dramas they put themselves through. Some of my most mature students once went to a party in Chadron, Nebraska, wondering how they even got there. Many of them drank until they passed out in their cars. These were good kids, who were really dedicated to learning and envisioned a future for themselves. They told me all of this (they also showed me videotaped footage of them drinking in the backseat of a car), but I had to tell the principal. He arranged group counseling for them.  In my conversations with students, I saw a desperate need for someone who could relate to them without the built-in restrictions of a teacher-student relationship. These kids needed serious training in self-worth and real problem solving skills from someone who could relate, but would not take pity on them. Many kids already sought healing in alcohol instead of the Church, so trying to simply to bring them to Jesus would not do any good. Then it dawned on me that I could use my skills as a listener to mentor and counsel--if not here, then somewhere.  Clearly, when living daily with death, poverty, and mistrust, God shows that holiness is not all purity and light. God shows love for God’s children and demands it in return, but at the same time, God knows the urgency of humanity—our pain and our motivations. Observing the sadness of the kids’ experiences and feeling the darkness in myself, a truth emerged: one must be willing to dive into dark places to find the light in oneself and in others. To do that is to understand God’s will. In practice, a regular counselor can help solve problems, but a faith-based counselor can help a spirit retrieve itself from despair.  The love I felt for Pine Ridge could not lessen the damage that my months of silence had done to the community I lived with, so I had to leave. After initially fighting to stay at Red Cloud, I slowly grew relieved to return home. I was unhappy trying to be an effective multimedia teacher when I had so much yet to learn. Many potential friendships suffered and I deeply missed my family. I still continue to this day to try to process the meaning of my Red Cloud experience, but in hindsight, going home was the best decision.  After a few months of introspection and self-examination, I started working at  urlLink Northwestern University  as a secretary. The lessons hard-learned in South Dakota were finally put to practice. My organizational skills improved as I began to care about all aspects of academia. Most importantly, I felt accepted there, and my fear of opening up diminished.  Drawn back into an academic institution in a staff capacity, I was eager to become a student again. Inspired by conversations with friends and family, I decided to pursue degrees in Divinity and Pastoral Counseling. Thus, in early 2002, I began culling information about local graduate programs and focused particularly on three schools. As I proceeded in the application process, I felt determined to do this and spurred on by something much greater than myself alone. When I was notified of acceptances from two of the schools I applied to, my family and friends (not the least of all myself) were delighted for me. No one could have been more excited of my future path than my grandmother, who told me that she was happy, and felt certain that this was God’s plan for me. As it turned out, she would echo this sentiment to my mother later in the last conversation she would ever have.  My grandmother was as my second mother. She would fill in the holes and gaps that existed in my familial framework in the absence of a father. Whenever I needed someone urgently to “bail me out,” she was the one who did it. Though we did not have the closest or best relationship at times, we were mirrors of each other’s dreams. She was the strength I’d hope to become; I was the woman she had wanted to be. Grandma wanted to see me and my little cousin Abeke both graduate and achieve great things in life. In April of 2002, both Abeke and I were on our way.  God, however, made other plans with regards to Grandma. She had been losing her hearing and sight, and frequently succumbed to dizzy spells. My mother often found her on the floor, unable to get up. Finally, my grandmother told us that she was going to cut her cholesterol medicine dose, which seemed to cause her to become weak and dizzy. Only a few days later, as grandma was going to answer the door, she fell into her chair with eyes rolled back, crying that she was dizzy. She pleaded with my aunt not to call the ambulance. Panicked, my aunt did call as grandma fell deeper into unconsciousness.  I got the call at 7 pm that evening. Never did I feel so scared, but at once wavering with uncertainty. It’s the shock one feels after being hit in the stomach. The immediate reaction of being “hit” was sustained in this case, with me not quite believing what was happening as I endured a slow train ride home. I do not quite remember what happened when I got there, except for being briefed on Grandma’s condition and how many of my relatives had already visited her. I also made calls to my job, alerting my boss and others of the news.  The visiting was the hardest part. For the longest time I debated whether or not to see her in her hospital bed as I did with Grandpa seven years before. Perhaps it was vanity or a sense of wanting to hide myself from reality, but at first I did not want to see her. I sat there in the waiting room, deciding. Finally I mustered up the strength to go and see her. There she was, with a long tube down her throat, connected to respirators and blood pressure monitors. She was still responsive and heard me. I decided to pray over her—her blood pressure started going down. I spent time observing the nurses and how they would change the tubes of the respirator. It seemed like they almost yanked it out of Grandma’s throat. I wanted to tell them to go away. When one of the nurses said that Grandma’s condition was worsening and that she was increasingly unresponsive, I wanted to tell her to go to hell. When Mom signed the DNR, I felt helpless. Grandma sank deeper and deeper into sleep.  The hospital staff finally moved Grandma out of the ER into intensive care. She had a nicer room, more spacious with a view and quieter. She was totally unresponsive by this time, and her hands and arms started curling into a fetal posture, signaling to doctors and nurses that her brain was dying. That day, we made the decision to find a priest to administer last rites. I had called my Grandmother’s parish, and the priest there refused, saying he had other commitments he needed to attend to. Crestfallen, I asked a nurse if there was a chaplain around. A soft-spoken middle-aged man named James came. He said he was not a priest and could not perform the ritual sacramentally, but he did pray over Grandma with us. He made the sign of the cross on her forehead with water from Lourdes. The prayers said here relieved my aunt, who was not quite ready to let Grandma go, but she at least made peace with a situation completely out of her hands. The prayers were a reassurance to us that God was working in this process, calling her home. Grandma left us behind at 4:45 the next morning.  I exploded with sadness at Grandma’s passing. Her departure left a vacuum in our family. Her absence was so unbelievable to us that it was as if she never left; she only took a trip for a short time and would be returning. Finally, I was extremely upset that other members of my family, and even people outside of my family, were not being sensitive enough about this loss. Perhaps I was the one being too sensitive, but even small gestures were important. All of my friends could tell I was profoundly changed by this, dragging this sadness along even as I was venturing toward an independence that would bring me such happiness. It was hard to move, I was so immobilized in either direction. Hard to feel happy, hard to feel sad. I knew God had a plan unfolding, but I had to work through the pain and watch my mom and my aunt struggle with keeping the house and paying bills. I had to reassure Abeke that her future was safe (but she mostly reassured me, instead). We all looked at each other, fought with each other, and wondered “what’s next?” In fact, the night before I moved into my new apartment that September, my aunt and I argued over who would take my grandmother’s china. How did we resolve it? I proposed that we let Grandma go—in other words, release her ashes, and we did. For at least that time being, it was what we needed. It made us realize that arguing over what she left behind was not worth the trouble. After all, Grandma did not bother much with the china herself when she was alive. We shrugged our shoulders and let it be.  So here I am now, having experienced 7 months as an M.Div. student at Loyola University IPS. I feel I fit so well here that I cannot imagine being anywhere else. I desire to pursue further my passion for psychology and am now applying for the M.A. Pastoral Counseling program. Entering this program will enable me to communicate with those who are in the greatest need for someone to listen. Having been on the receiving end of this help, I want to bring it to others. Craning my head to hear God’s word in the stillness and silence, also too in the loud boisterousness, I want to learn how to listen better. Sighing every time I hear the Gospels, weeping inside when I see fear and suffering, I want to be an effective minister of care. My goal is to unite people with others, with themselves, and ultimately with God. God gave me the grace to get this far—traveling through the rocks and stones of childhood, wading through the fog of my teenage hesitation, sinking in my failure at Red Cloud, and struggling with the waters of pain my family cried after Grandma’s death. I feel sometimes as if I exaggerate my grief--that maybe these things were not actually so bad--but then I wonder, if they were not so bad, why did they scar me so much? Would I still be here if they had not affected me? My choice is to turn my grief into answers. If I cannot find them for myself then certainly for others, since we all have a story replete with signs and twists and mysteries.  My purpose is to continue doing God’s work while exploring the mysteries of God’s revelations to humanity. After witnessing God’s unyielding presence in my life, I am confident that even if the plans I make for myself fall through, I have faith that God will show me a better way. I have persisted this far because I knew I was loved every step of the way, and that Christ desired me to follow him.  So the sun will come up every day. So I will blink every 15 seconds and breathe every few seconds. Long after my story here is complete, I know with faith that I have been here to serve.

      Basically, folks, this blog is going to be my long-post page.  My personal statement, academic papers, etc. are all going to be here.  Starting with the next entry, originally on my other  urlLink blog .

      Below is a paper I wrote about Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Learning about it really helped me understand my own depression and how to get out of it. I don't know if all the information is correct--ie, I am not sure that Barbara's GAF really is 49. I am still learning!  This paper is presented with gratitude to those who forged these revolutionary--yet common sensical--ideas, and to those who have done the research (a link to learn more about CBT is on "Prima Facie" post  urlLink here .)   For years I have observed a cycle of depression in myself. Trying to understand it had not been my highest priority. I had only wanted to get rid of it. It had been an awesome burden on me, and a sad process of hoping for the best—yet expecting the worst—and then having the worst confirmed by life. This is what I perceived. This is the way I feared it would always be.  Recently, after a period of stability in my mood, I felt like I was hurtling down that familiar spiral again. This time, my depression was perpetuated by loss, anxiety, and hopelessness at the changes happening in my life. It was a paralyzing loss of control that I do not believe that I could have survived if I had not sought help. Just a few weeks ago, at the lowest point that I had ever been, I did.  I met with two counselors, one from my school clinic and a pastoral counselor. Both of them had said that if I wanted to change my life, begin with my thoughts. This aroused my suspicions. I had figured, what good would changing my thoughts do if I cannot change the situation that made me depressed in the first place? My counselors persisted, however, by challenging my perceptions and helping me to see ways that I could act to change my current life situation.  Thus, I have begun to rebuild a positive attitude on my life. An important part of this renewal is resistance to feelings of being crushed by the changes that happened during the year—to avoid being the victim of circumstance. This renewal is a sincere desire to free myself from sadness and anxiety, a desire to control my thoughts, my behavior, and be the author of my life. That I have the will to even write this paper testifies to this.  Many of the techniques that the counselors employed came from a cognitive theoretical perspective, which aims to identify thoughts that produce painful feelings such as depression or anxiety. These thoughts can also trigger maladaptive behaviors. The goal of therapy is to change negative automatic thoughts, assumptions, or core beliefs (Thompson, 2003). At the very heart of cognitive therapy is the understanding that if one changes their beliefs, ideas, or perceptions of reality, one can change their feelings and responses to stressful situations.  Other techniques that the counselors used came from the classic behavioral theoretical perspective, which focuses on the measurable observations of behavior (Ivey, et al., 2002). The idea here is that negative thoughts and feelings are triggered by the maladaptive behaviors themselves, which are the result of faulty learning and conditioning (Thompson, 2003). The goal of therapy is to change behavior using what is called behavioral modification: examining what caused the behavior (the antecedent), observing what happens during the behavior itself, and exploring its consequences. By changing the antecedents and the consequences, the behavior itself is modified (Thompson, 2003).  When these orientations work in tandem with one another, a powerful agent for intrapsychic change develops—one where a client learns how to take control of her responses to stress. The client develops a deeper awareness of her thoughts, feelings, actions, and the environmental conditions that arouse them. With the right counselor, the client may become empowered to change the world around her. Essentially, where the cognitive and behavioral perspective converges, the cognitive-behavioral orientation begins.  In the next few pages, I will present a short analysis of cognitive-behavioral therapy, and apply techniques from this orientation to a sample case study of a client whose experience reflects my own. This is intentional for me, since I would like to better understand the mechanisms behind depressive “thinking,” and therefore explore what I could do to make sure others find a way out of the darkness of depression.   Cognitive-behavioral therapy is far from being the cold, deterministic kind of therapy that many (including myself) had thought it was. Instead, it is focused on building a collaborative, supporting relationship between client and counselor. The aim of this alliance is to change thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. This therapy puts clients in charge of their own actions and destinies.  At the heart of CBT is choice—a person can choose what thoughts, feelings, and behaviors to change, and therapists acknowledge that there are always chances to do so. Often, clients come in with feelings of powerlessness and loss of control. Cognitive-behavioral therapists work with clients to isolate maladaptive elements that trigger anxiety, helplessness, or depression. Once a thought, feeling, or behavior is identified, it is replaced with a new, learned thought or behavior. Methods are established to ensure that the client does not relapse, and usually involve changing old patterns of thought and practicing newly learned behavior.   Albert Ellis is considered as the “grandfather” of cognitive-behavioral therapy (Corey, 2001). A former Freudian, he recognized the ineffectiveness of psychoanalysis in his clients (Ivey, et al. 2002). He saw that most problems clients reported had originated from their own interpretations of stressful events. Ellis experimented with techniques, and in 1955, he combined humanistic, philosophical, and behavioral traditions to create rational emotive therapy (Corey, 2001). This therapy, now called rational emotive behavior therapy, or REBT, focuses on changing clients’ philosophies or belief systems by altering irrational ideas. Ellis’ own style is direct, but his intention is to challenge his clients to realize that they are responsible for the decisions they make, and that they must learn to live with them. Contrary to the way it may sound, this does not indicate that the therapist forces the client to do anything—in fact, Ivey, et al. (2002) mentions that “REBT provides clients with unconditional positive regard.” The therapist reminds the client of the choices that he or she had made, and to accept the consequences of those decisions. The ultimate goal is to get the client to change negative thoughts and behaviors so that he or she can live a more empowered life.  In a therapy session, a client begins to uncover the goals and standards he or she internalized from their families and culture (Thompson, 2003). These “musts” and “oughts” contribute to irrational thinking patterns within the client. The therapist will listen carefully to the root of this thinking, their “inner dialogues of musts” (Thompson, 2003), which often sound like the following:  “I must do well, or else I am a failure” (An unrealistic expectation of one’s self). “My friends/family/partner must treat me well, or else they are bad people” (An unrealistic expectation of others). “My life/work must be perfect, or else it is nothing/awful” (An unrealistic expectation of situations or circumstances). (Thompson, 2003)  The therapist rationally challenges these beliefs by giving the client a “more accurate appraisal” of themselves (Thompson, 2003). Clients who evaluate themselves using a reality-based perspective will accept themselves and life stressors become less overwhelming (Thompson, 2003).  Both therapist and client work thought irrational thoughts and behaviors using Ellis’ “A-B-C’s of cognition.” They are the following:  A: Understanding facts, events, or behaviors that the client encounters B: Examining the client’s belief about A C: Exploring what the client feels about A (Ivey, et al., 2002)  Notice that this is not a linear pattern—A does not cause B, which does not cause C. Both B and C are direct consequences of A, and A could be a consequence of B (a belief system).  As a client understands his or her thought processes around a particular event or situation, patterns of past thoughts and behaviors may be explored. When deeper beliefs surface and the client articulates them, the therapist will change focus and discuss the following (which continues the A-B-C process):  D: Disputing the irrational beliefs E: Listening to the effects that the disputation has on the client F: Helping the client develop new feelings and behaviors (Ivey, et al. 2002)  This process includes changing the “musts” into preferences, empowering the client to change what he or she can, while coming to a sense of acceptance when the situation cannot be changed. With practice, a client will begin to say:  “I prefer to do well, but I will accept myself even if I do not.” “I prefer that others treat me with respect, with I cannot control others.” “I prefer that my life is easy, but I can handle stress and still enjoy my life” (Thompson, 2003).  Eventually, therapy will help clients come to a greater acceptance of themselves, their world, and their lives.  As Albert Ellis is considered the grandfather of cognitive-behavioral therapy, then Aaron Beck is most certainly its father. Like Ellis, he originally practiced psychoanalysis and became dissatisfied with its results (Thompson, 2003). In the 1970’s, he developed cognitive therapy, a more direct approach to helping the client understand and identify thoughts that trigger negative behaviors (Thompson, 2003). This therapy orientation assumes that if changes are made in thinking, then changes in behavior will follow (Thompson, 2003).  Features of cognitive therapy include collaboration between therapist and client, a goal-oriented focus, the client’s gradual awareness of his or her own beliefs, and education about relapse prevention (Beck, 1995). The cognitive model, on which therapy is based, dictates that emotions and behaviors are influenced by a client’s perception of events. With strategies learned in therapy sessions that may be generalized to the client’s daily life, negative perceptions of stress will abate (Thompson, 2003).  Cognitive theory suggests that an individual has three levels of cognition: core beliefs, intermediate beliefs, and automatic thoughts. Core beliefs are one’s most central and fundamental beliefs, often regarded as absolute truths (Beck, 1995). It is usually an over-generalized statement (Beck, 1995). A core belief may sound like “I am not good enough,” or “Humanity is essentially good.” Though it is a central belief, it is not a fixed belief. Dysfunctional beliefs can be unlearned and replaced with ones which are reality-based (Beck, 1995).  At the next level are intermediate beliefs, which include attitudes, assumptions and rules (Beck, 1995). Attitudes may sound like “It is terrible to not be good enough.” An example of an assumption may be “If I can get someone to love me, then I will be good enough.” A rule is an expectation of oneself or of others, and may sound like “I must always strive to be a good person. I must always be good at what I do.”  At the most superficial level cognition is automatic thoughts, which are specific to a particular situation or event (Beck, 1995). They are brief and arise spontaneously (Beck, 1995). We are not aware of these thoughts, but we are conscious of the resulting emotions (Beck, 1995). A client may express his or her thoughts like this: “I can’t accomplish this task. It’s too hard.”   If we could combine cognition levels into a diagram, it would look like this:                                                                                Core belief

						   I saw a video today about people who are terminally ill.  The video profiled three people succumbing to terminal illness.  Two of the three died by the end of their profiles.  One, who was in hospice care waiting for lung cancer to take his life, was still alive by the end of his profile.  I have no idea how long ago the video was made, but this man, the first profiled on the tape, is most likely dead now.  You see, I am the new administrative assistant at a hospice.  I will basically be the go-to gal for all the patient charts for doctors and nurses.  Also, I will be the first person family members see and the last person to see the dead being wheeled off the unit.  Although I haven't yet started my job in earnest (I begin training on my unit tomorrow), I anticipate seeing families drift in and out, patients coming in walking or in wheelchairs but knowing that many of them will not exit alive, the smells, the tears, the sounds of crying, life support machines with their strange bell-like noises, and the death mask.    The dreaded death mask: the frozen expression of a weary sufferer lost in battle.  This is the very thing that breaks my heart the most--looking at a face contorted with pain and exhaustion.  I thank God that I didn't have to see my grandparents' faces at their moments of death.  I hope to never see my mother's.  And, dark as this may seem, I hope to either be incinerated in an explosion or die alone in the woods so that no one would have to see my own, since it says that death has won.  Because I hate the death mask.  Because I hate death.  Dylan Thomas invoked, "RAGE,RAGE AGAINST THE DYING OF THE LIGHT."  Was his anger a pointed missive at the end of life?  If it wasn't, can I turn it into that?  I hate death.  I hate the limits, the uncertainty, the knowing that eventually the lines stop.  All my senses, all my feelings, all my life--gone in labored moments.  I hate it more since, ironically, I just finished my Clinical Pastoral Education a few months ago.  Seeing people reach the ends--beautiful, glowing lives reaching painful ends.  And these people, every last one of them, were truly beautiful.  I hate it that they had to go.  And I don't care about the ends or the limits so much because I don't know where  I'm  going.  I hate it because  they are leaving .   The very reason why God sent me here was to help people--this I do know.  I always pray, "God, please help me to love her or him like you do."  The upside is that I get to meet great people who help me out (I admit to selfishness here--it's true).  The downside--they leave.  I can respect it when their life journeys take them elsewhere, but I could not deal with it if their journeys suddenly reached an end.  I am 27, young enough to still change my perception but old enough to know that the time will come soon that I will have to scream in sadness at the passing of a relative or good friend, or march in someone's funeral procession, or stand bewildered at an open casket.  It's only a matter of time.  I hope that God takes me first.  It's selfish of me to say that, right?  Truly, there are things from my past that make me feel that way.  The feeling and sense of abandonment.  I wish I could "abandon" my abandonment, come back and feel that those who have passed are alive in new ways.  I wish that I could say without a doubt that if my mom passed on, that I will survive and be at peace.  I wish that I could say that I can "survive" death.  But I hate it, and I am swinging on a very thin rope.  I hope that God shows me that I can make peace with death itself.  When will that happen?  I am impatient, I am eager, I am more than willing to surrender my stomach-numbing anxiety and nausea, my constant panic and fear.  I would be happy to cast away my cares and place my trust in God.  I would love to totally change my life to a place where I am comfortable enough to believe that everything is going to be ok (maybe I just began a new subject, but you can ignore what I just said if you don't follow).    I want the fear to end. Not my life, or yours.

						   Well, Hide Park is where I am trying to write a story.  I was in London on a layover for a day, and it was nothing I expected.  Basically I wish and hope to go back to Europe.  I love challenges, and I know that just even visiting the place is tough because it has been so blatantly obvious by my body type that I am an American--the big round bottom, the size-14 frame (and I am just below 5'2"), the big eager CAN-DO smile.  It conspires against me.  So my day dream is to actually still be all that I am and have a happy life.  To grow in the midst of adversity without being pulled under.  To be everything I truly am and what God wants me to be, because I love God and God loves me.  And if people don't like it...fuck em all.

						   Admittedly, it pays to be a private person.  But then again, I wonder if being a private blabbermouth is ok too.  You see, I am married.  Or at least legally, but nothing else.  What is wrong with me?    I finally confronted my husband about getting an annulment. It makes me feel as confused as Britney Spears. One thing is for sure--I don't know if I can ever get married again after this.  He said that he loved me, but he would not get in the way of ending the marriage if that's what I wanted to do.    When I have really begged him to be there, he was there.  Now, he is not even within a phone call's reach.  I haven't seen my husband in two weeks.  Never even met his parents, or his sister.  I am married at 27 and it has sucked beyond my wildest bad dreams.  I didn't want to marry my father, the guy who first educated me about how easy it is to be abandoned, but LOOK WHAT HAPPENED!!!  I had a feeling this would happen when I got married, yet I went through it anyway, primarily because I really needed someone to just be there for me.  I can't begin tell you how bad it was last year.  I was depressed, and he honestly made me feel better about myself and about life.  He was my way out of the crap I found myself in.  And I will always owe a large part of being alive today to him.  Unfortunately, he's now part of the problem.  And I can't wave a wand to simply make it go away.  I really don't see myself getting married again, and sort of pessimistically, I may just end up only dreaming about the kind of life I wanted to have: kids by age 30, financially stable, in a loving relationship with a man that actually KNOWS me from the deepest part of my soul.    Isn't this what every woman wants?  What J-Lo was singing about in that Gigli song?  (Ugh, I guess that's the fate of true love right there...)   So there it is: I am starting to question whether I can really ever love a man at all.  Will I totally turn my back on marriage altogether like Halle Berry?  Will I  desperately try to make it work with my husband?  Will I continue to go to therapy to work all this crap out?  Well, at least the last one will happen.    The other 2--the red bottle, the blue bottle--will be determined soon.  Or at least when the question "what the hell was I thinking?" gets answered.

						   I am a gigantic bigmouth, but if you met me on the street you would not know it. Well, actually, I am not really a bigmouth. It just takes many words to express what I really have to say. Honestly, I am an introvert, and many think that I am "reserved" and "quiet." Maybe I am just selective. Trust is of the utmost importance. Face to face is the hardest way to express oneself if one is introverted. The computer is safe...   But it is impersonal. I acknowledge that face to face interaction is underrated now. Courtesy is an endangered quality. We are slaves to the written word, worshipping the trinity of computer, monitor, and keyboard, and bowing to the almighty cable modem. There is something fake in this. Something that is missing. This kind of openness is illusory. There is no true intimacy achieved here. Only written words floating into empty space. Heck, probably no one will seriously read this tripe. But whatever. This is still a rather fun project.   Besides, when I am long gone, at least my words will still be here.

						   Out in the distance, beyond desert sands and past lush green palm trees stands a pronounced figure. Quite distinct, he stands there as if he his expecting a visitor. The sky is awash in azure purity—not a single cloud. It is reflected in the crystal waters that lap the feet of the distant figure. The wind is gentle yet still. Your feet keep moving forward in the dry sand though your mind is confused, your heart aching, and your spirit fading. Nothing can stop you. This figure is standing and waiting for his visitor. You look around and realize that there is no one else. The visitor is you.  Recently, seas of depression swept over me. I thought that I was going to drown in it and not know life. Yes, that is extremely “deep” of me to say. I tend to be especially sensitive to the world—the regular rhythms of others’ lives and the well-being of those immediately around me. I feel like I am fading as those in my world are getting stronger. Sometimes, I am not sure where everyone else ends and I begin. Where do I begin? How do I even answer this question, or where do I find the answer?  I can imagine that many other depressed persons have thought the same way. Whether stricken by the chaos of change or thrown by the loops of life’s odd rhythms, we come to the downward spiral. Most of humanity, in some way, has probably taken a ride down this path, but I would guess that many have found their way out. For those depressed, we are still there, and have no hope of finding our way to peace—unless, of course, there is someone standing at the exit, willing to grab hold of us, determined not to let us go. To me, that is the pastoral counselor.  A counselor is a mentor, an encourager, a parent for the interim. She has seen the spiral and has been there—may still be there, but fighting to get out. By adding “pastoral” to the title, you get a witness, not unlike the martyrs at the beginning of Christianity. A pastoral counselor witnesses through adversity, storms, change, and violent struggle. She peers into your mind and helps you to reconstruct your life. You may have been engaged in a brutal battle on the landscape of your psyche. She is the medic who helps sew you up, and the nurse who dresses your wound. The counselor invokes the Wisdom already present, and illuminates you with the truth you already know.  Beautiful images, you may say, but how exactly does this illumination happen? What wisdom invokes the Wisdom?  The counselors who have helped me through my darkness have asked me to question my own thoughts. One of them had already known I was a “rebel against the world.” Why couldn’t I rebel against the tyranny of myself? This much is true: if you cannot control what you think, you cannot control your own life—the precious gift that God has chosen to give you to nurture. Such is the message behind  urlLink cognitive therapy , honing your thoughts to believe the best about yourself, the best that God already knows. Once I myself had begun to identify what thoughts hurt me the most, my spirit seemed to shout—I pursued the tasks that were ahead of me and focused on the relief of accomplishment. I am not there yet, but every day is a step closer.  One thing that I have learned from depression is this: losing yourself in others costs you. It costs you a relationship with your own self, especially if you are the kind of person who constantly says, “I don’t know who ‘myself’ is.”  urlLink Robert Kegan  had a great idea: developmentally we all go through the rhythm of belonging and separating. Humanity begins life merged with its mother and ideally ends life merged with the cosmos. Unfortunately most of us still find ourselves reflected in others, existing as long as others find us pleasing (Kegan would call this the stage of the interpersonal self). I would die if anyone says, “Jackie, you are a liar, a creep, and a bad person!” The insult would be a slap that leaves a wicked print on my heart. Therefore, to keep the world (me) from collapsing, the façade from crumbling, I have to please. I have to save the world. Even if this involves compromising and lying to myself, I will suffer through it. Why? Because everyone must be happy!  Oh come on, you may be thinking, it cannot be that bad, right? You probably cannot sense the fact that I am blushing as I write this. I am sure it is true, as sure as I am a “two” on the  urlLink Enneagram .  I see the work ahead of me, that I have to build my self. To realize that I have hopes, dreams, goals and desires—then having to find the courage to act on them—will bring me closer to the person that God wants me to be. This is the kind of shepherding that Christ had done for humanity, and the example that the pastoral counselor should follow. It is much like watching a child grow. The client’s chair becomes the cradle, then the training wheel, then finally the springboard. The counselor and the client dance to the music of human development (here, I am using Kegan’s own image). The music is sometimes strange and trippy, but it is always the music of the client’s soul.  So you are the client, I am the client. All of humanity is a client—all in need of hands to hold us when we commit crimes of hatred against one another, in need of an understanding voice and of loving eyes despite our abuses and our lies. The need to be cared for and loved, even in the presence of our faults, is present and common to us all. Beyond the fighting, the wars, the debates, beyond bombs and terrorist attacks, beyond tyrannical leaders, beyond governmental lies, and beyond the tears of a child abused—GOD is there.  And so we keep moving through the sand, toward that distant figure. We walk under the palm trees, under the pure blue sky. The reflection of the sun through the water becomes so bright it is almost blinding. We come upon this luminescent figure, who smiles generously and stretches his arms to greet us. We return his love, trusting him and enfolding our arms around him. We look up to gaze into his eyes. We recognize who it is….

						   Here is something else I wrote last year that touches on why I am where I am right now...   Love is not love/Which alters when it alteration finds, /Or bends with the remover to remove...    William Shakespeare, Sonnet 116   It was a liminal day—I had just returned from home and was not feeling well. Instead of going to work, I stayed at my apartment and slept. At almost 8 pm that evening, I received a phone call from my Mother, informing me that Grandma, whom I saw earlier that morning, was in the hospital. She had suffered a stroke. I rushed home with a bunch of clothes and called off from work for the week. I heard my Aunt Pam and my Mother say that Grandma was barely responsive. Too scared to visit her, I stayed home and slept. The next day I got the courage up to see her. It was more than awful—tubes going down her throat, hooked up to machines. Once vital and lively, brought low by mechanisms in her body that failed her. She was getting old, tired, dizzy, fragile. But this—no one expected this. I left the room and called a friend at work. After I got off the phone I knew—Grandma wasn’t going to make it. She was going to die. Less than a week later, she did. I lost a parent last April. Not my Mother nor my Father but my Grandmother. She was a second mother, literally. Piece by piece, the physical vestiges of childhood have drifted away. I still have my Mother and Aunt, but with my Grandmother’s death, the real process of separation and adult self-identity making has begun. I am fully aware that one day I will lose my family to death, and to prepare for that, I must find God in fellowship with others, and be mindful that the flow of unconditional love does not end with me, but it continues through me. This is the solution and the goal, but getting there is the key. It has been a painful process. After Grandma’s death, the adjustments were not only physical or financial. Six children had to wake up to the fact that both parents were now gone. Grandchildren had to realize that the one link to a more distant past was no longer there. Certainly, with all of the arrangements with the funeral home, the creditors, and so on, the piece that mattered was our spirit. We are still in reconstruction. Mine has led me right were I am today, where Grandma herself wanted me to be. So when and how does one change? The story above was an example of a forced transition where the family had to suddenly adjust to one member lost. A myriad of ways can cause one to transform into someone almost completely different. Aside from sudden loss, change occurs from sudden entrance, i.e. a birth in the family or a new connection with someone. It can come from injury or sickness and new situations. Motivation for change can come from the inside, where the person one dreams of becoming does not match with the person they already are, or it can come from the pressure of others. True life changes are hardly ever easy. All seem to require deep reflection and will almost certainly plunge one into melancholy, if not depression. It is frightening to tread on unfamiliar territory and leave what we know behind, and often it seems too difficult to forge ahead. That is why God has given us the grace to live in companionship with others who will encourage and help us along in our transitions. Pure God-blessed change is the result of the movement of the Holy Spirit within all of us, guiding us to be the fullest of who we can be. We touch God through each other and through ourselves. So ultimately, God-given change is love. My Mom always says that God does not give us anything we cannot handle. If we let the Holy Spirit move us, then we can surmount the pain that threatens to consume us when we are faced with troubling transitions. The very being who guides us through all times is the very one whose love for us will never change.

						   This is my pastoral statement, written for my Clinical Pastoral Education class less than a year ago:    My Image of God:   “Be still and know I am God.”  Psalm 46:10  God is a genderless, omnipresent, omniscient parent.  God is a provider of unconditional love (Isaiah 43:3-5, Psalm 33:18, 1 John 4:7), suffers with us, and knows when to stay and when to let us walk on our own.  God is light, love, and the connections in the ties that bind.  Finally, God has a plan for each of us.

						   I am Catholic.  But I haven't made a big whoop about my being Catholic thus far.  Until now, that is...  Since my brain is on overload, I have decided to take a mental vacation.  What that means is that I am going to post papers that I have written and journal entries from diaries I have written in.  Most of the ideas I am going to show you have not changed, but for those who know me well, you know that this year has been a year of transformation and upheaval.  I'd like to think that I have changed for the better, or at least still in progress.   What I will show you are my reflections on being Catholic.  This includes my theology, my Christology, and my politics (or better yet, how my beliefs translate into real world practice).  I may drift into academic God-talk, and I  might be sort of abstract and reaching where language can't go, so BE WARNED!  However, most if not all that I have written is reader-friendly.  Hopefully you will be able to understand it and even comment on it.  In fact, I hope you do.   You are entering a place that is perhaps the deepest plane--a place where the cerebral and the viceral meet the spiritual.  It is my heart, it is my core.  Beyond all things tangible, the most important being to me is God (yes, besides my Mom).  And I believe in God as expressed through Jesus Christ.  So I hope that you enjoy the excursion into my mind, but above all else, I hope that this makes you think about your own lives.  Where is God for you?  What--or whom--do you believe in?  Where do you find meaning?  jc

						   Here's an idea...  Would you like to help me write Hide Park? Or any other story? Before I explain further, here is the background:  I have stalled a bit with the story only because I am busy trying to quit my job. No, I am not just being ridiculous, even though ridiculous is part of my personality...  But my energy is focused on being careful in my exit from my position as an administrative assistant at a hospice. I just began here a month ago, and though my official reason for leaving is "the distance too far," the real reason is because I am having personality conflicts with my co-workers. Plus, to condense what could be a very looong explanation into a few words: PCCHNS is not my community. It is a great place, but it is not my community.  Sitting at the annual PCCHNS "Everybody's Day" party last night, I felt like I was among total strangers. I was here in a restaurant out in the middle of Wherethehellami, IL, sitting in the basement dining hall watching a stream of PCCHNS employees file in. They were grinning and embracing one another in the dim lights of the large, crowded room. The crowd consisted of mainly middle-aged women who had been with the organization for a while, laughing and talking while catching up on old times. Fun atmosphere, and I wish I could have gotten into it--but I didn't, and it is not just because I was new (or that I was two steps out the organization door).  I was on the clock. The morning secretary wanted me to come for the evening and since I didn't know left from right, I said ok. I thought it was going to be an hour we would stay, at least long enough to eat and such. The AM secretary, let's call her Sue, was my ride, so I really couldn't leave even if I gave her dirty looks. She was busy yapping with all the energy God gave her. I just watched her, and was quietly thinking "get me the hell out of here!!!!"  No--I wasn't totally alone. I did talk with some of the nurses on my unit and a doctor who sat next to me (really nice guy). We comisserated about the pervasive lack of a well-cooked veggie burger. [Ok ladies--I know what you are thinking here. Sorry, he's married. And so am I, STILL! UGH!]  Most of the time, however, I sat peering behind me, focusing on the room and trying to locate the friends of mine from Loyola who work at PCCHNS. They were nowhere to be found. Sigh. Well, at least an employee brought her 21-month old baby for me to be amused with. But then she started getting me to thinking: I WANNA BABY! But there's no way in hell I can support a baby on the salary I am getting from PCCHNS. Absolutely no way.  So after Sue bangs on the table a few times shouting "I WANT MY SUNDAE!" We finally finish our meal and she drives me back to work. All in all the entire affair meant 3 hours of missed work.  Of course, I have other gripes and complaints, like Sue's overly nervous and highly controlling personality, the nastiness of the nurses when you either don't know something or you disagree with them, and the condescending attitudes of just about everyone who works there. Most of the times they think I am quite stupid. For the nurses I will repeat: STOOPID. I will admit, there are a few people there (nurses included), that I will always remember for their kindness to me. Everyone else can shove off. Sorry I know that is not very Christian, but this post is like an exhalation of bad air so that I can breathe cleaner air in.  So mom is applying for my job at the hospice, despite my complaints and my gripes. I was (and still kinda am) against it, but it is her decision, ultimately. She is strong enough to tell people to stick it where only the gastroenterologist can fetch it. But anyhoo--I hope SOMEBODY gets the job soon so that I can get the HELL out of there!!!!  Back to my original idea--how about sharing a blog where all 0f us can write a story or publish a thought together? A collaborative effort, with many diverse thoughts and opinions. An E-discussion, as it were. How'z about that? So that is my idea.  Nurses, please read: IDEER.

						   So I am writing this story called  urlLink hide park .&nbsp; It is about a girl who goes to London for some reason (I am still trying to decide if it is school or a job) still carrying the emotional problems that felled her back home in the US.&nbsp; She meets her neighbor who challenges her resolve to never be in a relationship.&nbsp; She carries the burdens of anger and sadness, but these do not define the person she is.&nbsp; Inside the walls she has built up, she is a giving and loving person.&nbsp;   As you can imagine, the heroine, Genevieve Caron, is a complex mirror of her creator.&nbsp; Yes, just like me Genevieve feels like she has a name fancier than her own personality allows her to be (Jacquelyn A. Carlton in itself honestly sounds like it belongs&nbsp;to an LLP or a JD).&nbsp; Genevieve is short and mixed.&nbsp; She is intense, sarcastic.&nbsp; And she is angry, particularly about an intense relationship that happened in the past.&nbsp; The similarities end there.   Ginny is angrier than I am, and also less shy.&nbsp; She is also an amalgamation of several individuals other than me, all with unique stories to tell.&nbsp;   Genevieve is the projected image of my own dreams: a woman who is flawed, scared, and yet courageous.   Basically my request to those that read this story is that you let me know how I can change it to sound better and where the story should go next.&nbsp; I am writing it in snippets and basically from my mind to the blog.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I am not the most articulate these days, but Genevieve's story is close to my heart, and I just want her to be known.

						   This weekend was the kind of weekend that I used to dream of when I was a little girl.  Well, it's the kind of weekend us loners often dream of, anyway.  I met people.  I saw people.  Heck, I was energized by people.  And I'm an introvert--this doesn't happen very often.  Something short of a mystical spark plug went off and all the sudden I was Miss Congeniality at this one party I went to this weekend.  Ok, maybe it was more like a spirit--but honestly, I only had half a glass...  But really, what Regina did not realize was there was something or some ONE moving through the small space.  We challenged each other, we admired each other.  We, for one moment in time, may have fit together like pieces in an odd cosmic puzzle.  No darted glances--when there was a meaningful word said, we looked each other straight in the eye.  And I believe in the cosmic connections, the sacredness of a moment.  Even if it is just a moment.  But last night was truly a gift.   The mood from last night (and, admittedly, the full feeling in my belly) carried over to today.  I had lunch with friends I hadn't seen in months.  Looking across the table and seeing sisters, and again meeting new people--this is truly what summer days should be, no?  Plus, what would seeing friends and meeting new ones be with out food?  Really...  Finally, I just hung out with my Mom.  We saw Shrek 2, and talked about life, love, and pursuits of Prince Charming (or if there is truly such a thing).   So this weekend doesn't "write" of excitement or passion--it is not rife with the anger and bitterness of many previous posts.   But truly this is what we dream of--not the "heat of the moment," but an enduring peace.  And for these past two days, I have felt nothing less.  Thanks Regina, Mary, Valerie, Asra, Mom...and God.

						   For the past few weeks, I&nbsp;have been feeling like I have no true and original thoughts.&nbsp; Well, because I&nbsp;really don't have any true or original thoughts.&nbsp;   When you are in the middle of&nbsp;financial chaos, when you have 2&nbsp;and 3 jobs to&nbsp;sustain you financially, when you&nbsp;face a mountain of responsibility, understanding the difference between&nbsp;high and low Christology and its implications on the world economy is not the first thought that I would expound on.&nbsp;   I look at my friend's  urlLink blog &nbsp;and realize how rich her life has been, how much she&nbsp;uses the world&nbsp;perched so gracefully&nbsp;upon her shoulders.&nbsp; Then I look here and say woefully, "nothing new today, nothing new today."  Well, I will wake up tomorrow and suddenly find something between my&nbsp;ears.&nbsp; It happens that way sometimes...  &nbsp;

						   Change.&nbsp; Resistance. Surrender. Conversion.  &nbsp;  I really wonder when the "right time" will be to show that I can fully lead, that I am fully mature.&nbsp; I do not ask that question to others, or even&nbsp;God,&nbsp;so much as I ask that question to myself.  &nbsp;  When I relate to others, I do so face to face.&nbsp; I am not comfortable in group situations unless I really know the people I am with or really buzzed on caffeine.&nbsp; Or maybe when I am happy--which DOES happen, despite the entries in this e-journal.  &nbsp;  Eden--this happens when I don't expect it to.&nbsp; It is not exactly the same as finding romantic love.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is finding God's love in other people.&nbsp; The Garden of Eden and the Kingdom of God: one in the same, only this time it is not about the beauty of what the eyes see, but light the heart radiates.&nbsp; This kind of love grows when you don't even know it is there.&nbsp; You are not even aware of it's power and glory until just the right moment.&nbsp; Then suddenly you are engulfed in holy bliss.&nbsp; If you're not religious, you may not call it holy, but you just cannot help but call it overwhelming.&nbsp; You stand there feeling like it's you...but also something (One) else.&nbsp; Your fingers are different, your body is different, your face, your breathing, your gaze.&nbsp; It is like feeling light radiate from your pores.&nbsp; It's not magic, it's not that YOU yourself are being God, and it's too real to be a delusion.&nbsp; It is the living breath of God emanating from your very own skin, seeking to enfold others in a loving and tender embrace.&nbsp; The best thing about this is that it can happen to anyone, anywhere, at any time.  &nbsp;  Now, how's that for a holy revelation?&nbsp; I guess today must be a good day...

						   It's my father's birthday.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  I have neither seen him or talked to him in, what, 13 years?&nbsp; Lucky me.&nbsp; Thank you, Father, for the example you set.&nbsp; And the lovely parting gifts: poverty (Mom&nbsp;&amp; me) and a failed marriage (me).&nbsp;&nbsp; I will cherish them with the anger that you had already given me!  &nbsp;  Despite that, Dad, I have created a life.&nbsp; It is imperfect, it is unremarkable, but it is a life.&nbsp; Things I have now I have built from scratch.&nbsp; Life has been a cycle of chaos and rebirth.&nbsp; Of course, mom has been here to witness it all.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has just been the two of us "against the world."&nbsp; She has taught me responsibility and survival.&nbsp; Now that we've lost the family house, I have taken care of her and tried to supply a means of support for her as she begins to rebuild her own life.&nbsp; I have no doubt that she will someday very soon.  &nbsp;  My grandparents have both died since I last saw you and the rest of the family have dispersed.&nbsp; Grandma was the glue, the matriarch--someone I know you remember.&nbsp; Well she's probably conversing with your mom in heaven about how you never came back to claim your daughter.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Maybe it was the best thing you could have ever done, leaving me.&nbsp; I try to live a life of service, generally helping others and making sure they don't go through the same kind of shit I have in your absence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your willed removal has helped me "see the light."&nbsp; Reality is clearer.&nbsp; I just wish it didn't have to be so dark.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Don't get me wrong, Daddy, I do try to be happy.&nbsp; I go to school and am getting a Dual Masters degree.&nbsp; No, I am not at Harvard and probably will never be.&nbsp; But I will go as far as God chooses to take me.&nbsp; And if it is to the far ends of the earth or just as far as the cornerstore, so be it.&nbsp; Again, I live by the choices I make.&nbsp; Though I am angry at you, I am generally NOT angry by personality.&nbsp; All things considered, I am a good person.  &nbsp;  But I constantly think about the absolution I gave you.&nbsp; Well, Dad, you will be pissed to know that I take it back.&nbsp; I was not ready to forgive you because I did not really understand what forgiveness meant.&nbsp; The soul conversion, the true change of heart--these things did not happen.&nbsp; I was 16 and working with the only inner stuff that I had then.&nbsp; You CANNOT expect an ADULT absolution from a 16 year old.&nbsp; You think you left freely and cut the cord the minute I said "I forgive you."&nbsp; Well I don't.&nbsp; You never answered me.&nbsp; Will you ever?  &nbsp;  Are you dead?  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

						    Sure, I seem stand offish enough, until you get to know me...   &nbsp;  I ride this very heady tide of emotions that I don't understand, coming from a place in me I tried hard to ignore.&nbsp; The girl screams louder than I ever wanted to hear.&nbsp; Every time I close my ears, she shrieks almost preternaturally, as if she is beyond girl and something other than human.&nbsp; She shatters my ears, and  I want to thrash her with my hands .&nbsp; But her cries are just as cruel, and she becomes only the sound.&nbsp; I can't reach her at all.  &nbsp;  So then what can?&nbsp; I mean, there are times when I think everyone around me can hear her yelling, or at least feel it.&nbsp; Goddamnit, I can't get her to stop pushing people away.&nbsp; Who does she think she is trying to defend?&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell, I thought she wanted love.&nbsp; I thought she wanted kindness and friendship.&nbsp; I thought she wanted to BELONG.&nbsp; So then now what?&nbsp; She is not protecting ME.&nbsp; The silly brat.&nbsp; She does not even know herself.&nbsp; All she does is scream.&nbsp; And now that bitch is roaring.  &nbsp;  The whole room can feel it, and they slide away.&nbsp; I stand in the darkness, not  known , but probably pittied.&nbsp; Standing alone, without reason but insanity as my invisible companion.&nbsp; Moving the motions, drinking empty cups, walking aimless steps with no purpose or drama.&nbsp; Average person.&nbsp; Average little person.&nbsp; Little thing.&nbsp; Little fucking thing.  &nbsp;  And someday her screams will have reason.&nbsp; Her shriek will be known.&nbsp; Her flesh will disperse into space (as it should) and her echoes will be memories.&nbsp; But she will not win.&nbsp; She will not be known.&nbsp; Not before me.&nbsp;

						   let me be the first to admit that it was kinda slow in the middle in some areas. I do have a short attention span and it was hard to focus in some areas. Businessmen and their jobs are boring, but they exist to generate money flow and maintain the status quo. I was trying to be value-free in that last sentence, but as you can tell, I am not interested in maintaining the fucking status quo.   Having said that,there is something that MUST be said about the impressions that Michael Moore leaves his audience with. I remember seeing Bowling for Columbine, which had a huge impression on me. That one could thread so carefully the failure of the US government to protect its citizens on an international level to the failure of society to protect its children in Columbine, CO on that April day in 1998--it is incredible. His storytelling is at once powerful and accessible to the extent that even if you don't believe his politics, you will walk away changed forever.   After endless previews, the movie finally began, showing the mess that was US politics before September 11, 2001--the election that George Bush stole, the grand Dewey-ness of the media declaring the rightful winner to be Al Gore (which they RIGHTFULLY did, just so you know where MY party lines are drawn), members of the Black Congressional Caucus standing up for President Gore to the point of anger. You know, it is truly a post-modern society when those in positions where impartiality is necessary show that they are not. This goes especially for the US Supreme Court justices that put an end to the recount in FL. But this film shows that bias reigns everywhere, even in the perspective of the one who holds the camera.   The strange thing is, during the movie when I saw the first few moments after the world changed on 9/11, I felt sorry for George Bush. He was nearly expressionless, like suddenly the headlights washed over him and he was standing in the path of a large big rig. Nothing trained him for that, though somehow he had to have known that a major tragedy would happen during his term, as it has for every presidential term since the founding of this nation. This was his turn, and his time to prove himself.   Unfortunately for George, my sympathy ended there.   This movie asked the questions the everyone wondered but no one dare ask. I used to hear people say, "Oh, I'm not political," or "I don't pay much attention to politics." These are days that call us to avoid disengagement from the world. We're behooved to heed the call toward the polls this November, especially since our young are being sucked into the power machine, destroyed by bombs and gunfire, killed by the greed of our very own government.   But then it is here that I cannot help to think of the mothers.&nbsp; Any mother, every mother.&nbsp; Created in the image and likeness of God, with lines and scars and wounds the size of God's heart.&nbsp; Eyes as deep and penetrating as Miriyam, mother of the Lord.&nbsp; By His Stripes We Are Healed goes the verse, but we still inflict the gash, we still throw the spear, we still thrust the sword into the parents' hearts every time we send a kid off to&nbsp;die in a war in another country.&nbsp; "The children are our future," but let me add that their blood ensures there will be a future, right?&nbsp; Are we selfish to send our babies to shed their blood so that our own asses are covered?&nbsp; Why don't our politicians go over there and do the dirty work themselves?&nbsp; Hell, I'd go over there myself to protect some well meaning kid who just wants to go to college.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Real courage to me is when we fight with our intellect.&nbsp; Real courage is speaking out.&nbsp; Real courage is staying the course and being true to your convictions no matter what.&nbsp; Real courage applies to both sides of the argument--either for or against this fucking war, but real courage means that whatever side you choose, you must take the heat for what you believe.&nbsp; We can all possess it.&nbsp; We can all be on the front lines.&nbsp; So why not risk it?&nbsp; I'd risk it for liberals, others may risk it for the conservatives, but the wealth of freedom is in the RISK.&nbsp; So why not risk it?&nbsp; Why not risk peace?&nbsp;

						   Confusion really is when you have options, but then again you don't...  The reason why I am working 2 jobs is because they both have odd hours and pay less than I need to live off of.  Combined, I would earn 2400 a month--pretty good.  But the problem now is that ATT Wireless, ComEd, RCN, Farnsworth Hill, and all those folks are coming after me for money I can't give them because I don't get paid regularly enough.    Patience,take a deep breath, relax.  Easy to say.  Have you tried inhaling underwater?  I am trying to catch up to the standard I enjoyed when I was employed at Northwestern: stability.  Being able to afford rent, being able to afford the electric bill, being able to afford food, paying the phone bill on time.   All that stuff.  All the while I keep asking a million questions...if only I could win the lottery.  If only I had a rich relative.  If only I could change my degree to business and worked in marketing instead.  If only I was conservative and a workaholic.  If only my husband would get off his lazy ass and help me.  If only if only if only...  I had been unemployed for more than a year.  My school schedule complicated employment and my money situation has complicated finishing school.  My loyalties are diffused.  My concentration difficult.  Sheesh.  Yes, I write about bad news all the time, but when all of this craziness is over and some semblance of stability returns, then maybe my life will get boring, and I will start writing about YOU instead.  How ya like me now, HUH?

						   How much do I think about school?  Let me count the papers...  1 due for Foundations of Liturgical Studies 1 due for Models of Counseling 1 due for Freedom, Justice, Authority, Identity, etc.  in Islam 3 due for Foundations of Biblical Literature  Can she do it?  Can Jackie Poo get out of her funk long enough to crank out another paper before she begins her 3rd year at IPS in 2 weeks?  Can she wrestle the demons both in her head and at her job so that she can have space to work?  Can she do all this and STILL make a living?  (Encouragement is helpful, by the way...)  Till then, this blog is adjourned.  Check back in a week or two.  jc

						   Yes, it is as it sounds...  Whenever my "cycle" begins, I become more reflective and often times really sad.  I guess that this happens to most women--some hormonal change triggers negative thoughts or emotions.   So I am relieved that this kind of thing doesn't just happen to me.  But the sad thing is, these thoughts and feelings are rooted in real-time lived experience.  To reduce all of this to biology is to deny that these feelings are real.  Maybe these feelings are something that I unconsciously push back, and the hormonal surges of menstruation open a chasm that releases them all.  These primal feelings--I hate them, yet I know that there is a truth to them.  And now I am revisiting them because I am consistently encountering my worst enemy: rejection.  In case you didn't know--I am sort of an exhibitionist.  My private thoughts and feelings are laid out in this here weblog for all to see, but it's not limited to just that.  I seek attention often because I truthfully am an insecure person (my ex-husband knows this and thinks that because of this I should never get married again).  My deepest desire is to belong, to be important to people, to be loved.  Therefore, I volunteer for anything and everything.   I seek things and people out so that I can have a purpose and a meaning.  But what I really want is for people to seek me, to want me, to understand me.  I want to be strong and independent, but I still need other people.  I still need the affirmation.  I try not to be as selfish and self-important as this may sound.  Really, I do love people and whenever I get mad at them I pray that God helps me to love them.   But I hate feeling rejected because I fear being alone and insignificant.  Mostly I just fear being alone.  This past year has brought rejection after rejection.  If not from a possible counseling internship site, then from a job opportunity.  If not from a job opportunity, then from someone close to me.   I got married in December because I felt alone and left behind.  Even though I was married, I STILL felt alone and left behind.  Now that I am in the process of divorcing him,  I feel sort of alone again.  Maybe I am more or less anticipating future loneliness.  Right now I live with my mom, and I often fear life without her.  She is the only person--"meaning-maker,"fortress, foundation, etc--that I need to really function.  It is an intense emotional connection that we have, and I know that one day she will not be physically there anymore.  Understand that I really do want her to be independent and I also want to BE independent, but now I need her to be there since I still feel, as I said earlier, that I can't be alone.  It is incredibly easy to feel lonely--and maybe I say this because I am pre-menstrual, but it's the God's honest truth.  Until I learn to really love myself, and I am trying, I really need help, I need others to SEE me.   Rejection equals loneliness and unimportance, and that equals oblivion.  Yes, I have friends who have helped me and my mom out in the worst times.  Like this past summer, I saw them almost all the time, and I don't think I could have made it without them.  Going out to eat, seeing them, and even their help with my security deposit and moving--it's meant the world to me.  And even my ex-husband lifted me out of some pretty devastating lows.  Sometimes he understood  (Sometimes!)  I hope that I will always have them in my life.  Even when they get married, have kids--I hope they will still have some room in their lives for me.  Meanwhile I will either be some really important big person (yeah, right), or in some mental institution somewhere (more likely)...  So now you know what is weighing on my mind now.  Truly during this emotional flux I feel like I am standing still.  Again.  Please move me.

						   I realize that the last post was sort of left dangling.  The question that you are wondering is: what next?  So all this bad stuff is happening in the world.  What can I do?  Here is an answer:  If nothing else today, hug someone. Look at someone and see them as complete personsas beautifully complex as they are, and try to understand what it takes for them to be who they are everyday.   All it takes is a "hello, how are YOU?"  As for spreading love on a global scale, make contacts, seek out certain web pages that propose real solutions to global madness, such as DATA (link to your left) and  urlLink The Sudanese Peace Meetup  (there are links on this page to sites in which you can volunteer time or money to).    Finally, be vocal--either with the spoken word or even by the written word.  Speak until your throat is sore, write until your hands bleed.  But speak your soul and your conscience.    I guess this stuff above is pretty general and rather vague.  But before getting into specifics of any kind, you must ask yourself these questions:  * Where do I feel the most called?  We can't heal all the world's problems, but we can identify those issues that we feel the strongest about.  If you still are not sure, try this question--What tears you up inside and makes you feel either really sad or really angry?  *What can I offer?  Basically, ask yourself what your talents are.  Can you organize?  Can you encourage?  Can you write or sing, or speak publically?  Are you a leader?  Also, what you do on the side, i.e. hobbies such as blogging (!) can influence what you do with your mission.  And finally, *Where can I find others like me?  Sometimes this requires research and invested time.  It may also require you to compromise (even well meaning persons have "personalities").  But stay focused on the mission, and savor even the smallest rewards.  I hope this helped.  I am always looking to get involved in volunteering time to different organizations.  However, I have run into deep trouble with that, since I have to realize that I have limits and I get tired very easily.    So I guess the last suggestion is to know when your body can't take it anymore!   REST.  jc

						   Why is it that our government is so gung-ho about blastin' them terrorists in Iraq that they fail to see that the real terrorists are in Sudan? And 30,000 people paid with their lives. And one million people are forced out in a campaign to forcibly remove black African farmers from there lands. Are we so far removed from our Motherland that we choose to ignore what is going on? Am I the only Black American pissed off by this???  But in all seriousness, it is a sad tale that no one will win--neither the Arabs nor the Sudanese. And 30,000 paid with their lives. Why?  I will wrestle with this, I will pray for peace. Join me?  When I wrote the paper that is here in the post called "Prima Facie," I was listening to a song called Stabat Mater, arranged by  urlLink Paul Schwartz .  This song captures the suffering that Mary Mother of God endured when she was standing by her dying Son's side.  urlLink Stabat Mater  literally means "The Mother Was Standing." It was supposedly written by Jacopone da Todi in the 14th century, but many believe that Pope Innocent III may have written it in the 13th century instead. There are actually two Stabat Mater's--the Dolorosa and the Speciosa. As you can imagine, the Dolorosa is the one that is more popular. It is the one used during Catholic Stations of the Cross on Holy Week. It is also the piece, between the two, that has been set to music the most.  Each verse sets the stage--if you have ever seen the movie "The Passion of the Christ," then you could probably get a sense of what the poem is saying (here I use the Passion because of it's controversy and it's popularity--many are quite likely to have seen it, despite it's grotesque violence). Concentrate for a moment on the suffering Jesus. I come from a church that embraces a "high Christology": Christ is king, ruler of the universe, the Risen Lord. Our liturgies, with a "high" priest, reflect as such.  But for 24 hours somewhere lost in time, Christ was NOT the Risen Lord. He was a prisoner and a victim. Beaten, battered, tossed, abused, a fate that is not unlike being raped. Yes, shocking of me to say the word "raped," but imagine the worst thing that could happen, being alone, being ganged-up on, violated beyond any kind of self-recognition. The scars are physical, emotional, and probably deeper. This is the Jesus who, even though He can see the resurrection, is not yet The Resurrection. He is Jesus, son of Mary, fate's bastard and fortune's fool, wracked with pain and haunted by flesh that is ripped apart, by rejection, by the jeering of those around him. This is the Jesus that I understand, the Jesus I see in the world today. The Suffering Jesus.  And Mary--she is standing in tears as she watches her beloved son die. Imagine the person that makes life worth living writhing in pain in front of you. You, who believe that your loved one is put upon this earth for a reason, destined for something great, but having to suffer so cruelly. Thirty-three years of ups and downs, banter, serious talks, arguments, stolen moments of frivolity, and mutual respect but always love--gone in slow, painful hours. The baby, who cried for Mom, who walked behind Dad following his every move, the Boy eager to learn, the Man of action--gone with every drop of blood.  Now imagine that this kind of suffering, endured by Jesus, is still happening every single day. In the Sudan, where thousands are dying every single day. Imagine those dying of AIDS--minute by minute, dying as slowly as Jesus did. Imagine your own families and friends--broken ties, hopes dashed, compromised dreams--all can be as painful as death.
