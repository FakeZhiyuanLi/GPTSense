      Yep and Harloe everyone again!!!! Yarp I'm back here again to complete my story... hehe sorry for the interruption the last time, but my dad wanted me to run some errands.... er like cleaning out the fish pond ( that involves going down into the disgusting algae-filled water barefoot, the happy koi fish slithering around your leg) and disinfecting our birdcage.... because one of my favourite parrots have some bacteria disease called "Newcasle"..... need to disinfect everything!!!! Haiz.... so sian Oh, in my last post I mentioned about something that my peers couldn't ... may have confused you a little so I thought I would make it clear... well a lot of people couldn't finish due to time constraints.... and were all like "Huhhhh.... I never feenish ley.... how arh? Die liao, why must be so deefeecolt one?" If you dont understand singlish slang, then skip the earlier sentence ok? Yup, and some of the more (ahem) refined people were like in deep discussion over the thought-provoking question of," Is affluence the number-one enemy of the environment?" so everyone were discussing until we sat for the next paper.... i will spare you the details about D&T bcos it will surely bore you to death.... (GURANTEED)   I cant tell you how happy I felt after the exams! Sleep was definitely on my mind.... not to mention the wonderful thought of slacking in front of the computer and playing to your heart's content.... wowee wowee wow.... slurp....   hahaz.... oright i have to go gain.... updating soon! NiteZ...

        urlLink    MuaZoiii people! Hi my exams are finally ovar..... yipee hurray!  Citrons et soleil reporting to you guys for daily updates! Well haha my exams finally finished, I feel so relaxed! Happy! Its time for champagne and fire-crackers.... haha.   Well today I must say that everything went well... ok larz.... well today I had two papers.... Geography and DesignTechnology... well I was mugging like crazy from 3pm to 2am for these two papers ESPECIALLY DesignTech cos I always manage average, if not horrendous marks for this particular subject! And to make matters worse, it's streaming year and I need the marks to pursue a pure sciences course... preferably the triple sciences of course... cos I lurve Biology and maybe in the later future, I would like to enter the NUS Medical Faculty. Haha... well enuff of the crap. Now, where was I?  Yes, where was I? Yes! Aha, I think I was touching on the topic on my exams today. Ok so lets start with the 2nd last paper... which is .... GEOGRAPHY! It's my ultimate favourite subject! I like studying about the Earth and touch on geological issues like Deforestation and Environmental Crisis... only this time it is harder for my school is like, erm.... kiasu and I have to borrow a Sec3 Geog Elective textbook and read in advance, to be more far ahead than my peers. So I memorized this and that until I went ABSOLUTELY crazy,so much so I mixed up the causes of Environmental Degradation and High-tech farming and blahblahblah.... but it was fun! I dont remember studying so hard for my exams before... haha it is very competitive even if I am in a to-be autonomous school... dont mess with us! Oh yar, so I swapped and alternated every hour, 1st hour dedicated to Geog and the 2nd hour to D&amp;T and so on until I was dead beat... Duralumin.Pewter.Antimony,Copper and Maganese, High Carbon Steel 2%-4%..... and so on.... yes, my mind was filled with all these stuff. Ok and so when I went for the exam, I wrote everything I memorized down, until my hand was oh SOOOOO sore.... lucky feizhao was our invigilator, I was still writing when she went to collect papers! In fact everyone was.... a lot of people can't....>{pause for a while] Gotta go.... I will continue soon! Have tuition! Bye! {Yes Dad i AM CUMING, PLEASE STOP YELLING!]
