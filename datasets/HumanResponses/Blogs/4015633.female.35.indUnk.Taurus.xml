      Ok, one of the reasons I wanted to do this is I feel the need to record somewhere the evidence of what has become a mantra in my life – The people I work with are fucking crazy. CRAZY PEOPLE. Sometimes fun crazy. Often annoying crazy. Many times confusingly crazy. But do not be confused, they are seriously and clinically insane. So, in what I believe will be just the first of many installments, let me introduce PIWWAC:  Last week, on Thursday, I was coming out of the ladies room when I ran into Nichole. “Welcome back!” she said. From the ladies room!?!?  Today, Carol announced she was ordering Chinese food for lunch. Karen announced she would like to join in ordering Chinese food. In most offices, this would lead to a five-minute exchange about what to order, from where, at what time and to be picked up by whom. In MY office, it launched a FORTY FIVE MINUTE loud debate about glutten and General SOW (not Tso, but sow, like a pig) and what someone’s grandbaby can and cannot eat, even though she of course would not be participating in this meal. And all the while, I sat between them meditating on the unhealthy refrain of “SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP.”

      Ohio nominated Kerry!!!!!!!  I don’t care if you make fun of me. The Roll Call of the States is something I look forward with the zeal of an unabashed civics nerd. Only twice every four years do you get to hear great stuff like this:  “Montana Democrats, grateful to God for the quiet beauty of our state….” Was the best one last night.  Everyone from Hawaii yelling Aloooooooooooo-HA! was also good.  “Pennsylvania will do our talkin’ on election day, we cast all our stinkin’ votes for Kerry,” Dumb Ass Gov. Rendell said. It was the worst one. I was so embarrassed.  If they had had the wisdom to let ME, a registered Republican, thank you very much, cast our state’s votes, I would have said something like this:  “Thank you madam chairwoman, Pennsylvania, land of Byzantine government and dumbass governors from Philadelphia….”  No, wait. (I actually personally like Ed Rendell, he just pissed me off last night.) Let me try again:  “Thank you madam chairwoman, Pennsylvania, the roots of American democracy, the keystone of original colonies, the heart of America’s blue-collar work ethic and high-minded intellectual achievement, proudly aspires to full-on blue state happiness by casting all of its votes for John Kerry!!!!!!!!!!!!!!”

      At 7:45 a.m., I am vaguely aware of a ringing that I mistakenly think is my alarm clock.   I am cursing myself for stupidly setting the alarm for a Sunday morning when I realize my head is aching. And I have cramps.   And now I realize it is the phone ringing as I hear the answering machine click on and Tuttie is chirping, "Winnie! Winnie! Winnie!! We are going walking at eight!!"   And I wonder, did I wake up in hell?

      This has been cracking me up all week.   Last Sunday, Tim Russert rattled off how many days there were until the election. About a hundred, I think he said.   And instead of thinking, "Oh good, it's almost over!" or something sane like that, my initial gut reaction was&nbsp;"Ah man, that's not enough. I need more!"   Freak.   The craziest thing was that then I went to work Monday and told Mike this story and he said, "I had the same reaction."

      First, she got me addicted to Slo Mo Tourist.  Then I said, "I want a blog."  And then she said, "You should totally do a blog."  And now look, here I am. Nothing to say.

      A list of things I need to do before leaving for Ohio: - Buy candy - Buy toys - Buy booze, not for the same people as the candy and toys, thank you. - Remember to find and print out a schedule of Olympic swimming events cause even though my parents now have satellite television, there’s still no Internet out there - Buy more candy and more toys.  Do you think I do enough to make those kids think Wynne=Toys? - Cut my grass, which won’t get done, cause hurricanes in Florida mean rain,  rain,  rain in Pa. - Make enough progress on my very thick book so as to avoid these kinds of comments: “Weren’t you reading that book the last time we saw you?”

      So I've heard from a few of you Teresa Heinz-is-so-cool-she-can-do-no-wrong types that you, in fact, do not want to shut up about Shove-it Gate.  That's fine. We don't have to agree.  You're allowed to be wrong.

      SHUT UP about Shove-It Gate. SHUT UP about it. I cannot even believe anyone is still talking about this.  And more than that,  I cannot believe that I actually feel obligated to defend Colin McNickle (whom I’d just as soon hate) against Teresa Heinz-Kerry (whom I’d just as soon love.)  But you all need to shut up about it cause you’re WRONG!!!  I swear to God,  if you’re a woman who can have a run-in with Colin in which he comes out the injured party,  you have the capacity to be one ridiculous bitch.  And you deserve all the shit anyone from Fox News to the Trib to the Washington Times wants to heap upon you.  And this is especially true if you’re a political veteran like THK.  For those of you who think Colin had it coming because the Trib has antagonized Teresa Heinz-Kerry,  I have two things to say. First,  even if the Trib had made her life miserable,  she has the right to walk right past Colin without talking to him or taking his questions.  She does also have the right to tell him to shove it,  but not without accepting the consequences of that choice, which would be people calling her a big-mouth loose cannon.  Second,  and more importantly,  she told Colin to shove it,  BEFORE SHE KNEW WHO HE WAS.  I’ve watched the tape about a dozen times.  She told him to shove it, she stormed off.  It wasn’t until Big Fat Ed Rendell talked to her a few feet away and said _ insert snotty, whiny, 7th-grade voice here _ “You know he’s from the Trib!”  that she turned on her high heels,  went back to Colin and said,  “You’re from the Trib? Of course.  Typical.”  And stormed off again.  Now,  this goes back to my first point,  which is that she seems to have made some kind of defense out of saying that Colin is her tormenter.  If the Trib is such a daily aggravation to THK,  you’d think she’d recognize Colin by sight.  Either because he’s harassed her before,  or perhaps,  CAUSE HIS MUG’S IN THE PAPER EVERY DAY.  Also,  Colin was not being mean to her.  Hard to believe,  I know,  if you read his stuff.  But again,  I’ve seen the tape a dozen times,  and he was actually gentler with her than I would have been and I am a tree-huggin’,  no-meat-eatin’,  gay-marriage-lovin’,  death-penalty-opposin’,  of-course-the-war-was-wrong LIBERAL.  Moments before he questioned her,  THK was babbling something about un-American and unPennsylvanian (??) traits creeping into something.  If anything needed clarification,  it was this.  And instead of just not seeking a follow-up with her and blasting her weird ramblings in the next day’s column,  Colin quite politely asked THK what the hell she was talking about.  Have I mentioned I’ve seen the tape a dozen times?  He said,  “You were mentioning something about un-American…….”  Leading her to finish her own statement.  When she shrieked that she hadn’t said that word _ even though we all have seen the proof that she freakin’did too say it _ Colin actually backed off and asked her, all right, what did you say then?  Which I think was more than fair.  And instead of clarifying herself, THK said shove it and bolted.  I cannot tell you how it galls me to feel like I have to stick up for Colin. But he’s right here. And she’s wrong.  And have I mentioned SHUT UP ABOUT IT?

      I loved this: “I don't care if it's Sandy Berger or Warren Burger or Veggie Burger who walked off with 'code word' documents. . . . It's . . . the fact that it could happen -- that concerns the Committee."  Rep. Thomas M. Davis III (R-Va.) Don’t worry Mr. Davis,  most men like to think they have big secrets in their pants. Rarely is true.

      In my perfect world, Subway would sell iced tea as good as the iced tea at Wendy's so that when I go out for lunch, I don't have to make two stops.

      Man, this morning Pittsburgh was as smog-covered _ excuse me, OZONE-covered _ as I've ever seen it. In 10 summers, it has never looked as bad as it did on the way to work this morning.  You couldn't even see the top of Mount Washington. It just looked like the inclines were disappearing into a big, brown marshmellow.  I remember the day Isabel gave me a lift into LA and very helpfully pointed out that the thin brown line of haze on the horizon was "smog." I wanted to say, "That's not SMOG! Come to Pittsburgh in July and I'll show you smog." Except we don't call it smog. We call it ozone, which makes it sound like a good thing, but it isn't.  Bums me out. Cause really, I know I tell all of you this all of the time in my fruitless campaign to get everyone I know to move to Pittsburgh, it's not a dirty city. It's really clean. The steel mills are mostly gone and we're all civilized now, I swear. But the smog every summer bums me right out.
