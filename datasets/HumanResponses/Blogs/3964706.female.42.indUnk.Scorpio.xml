      &nbsp;&nbsp; Ok, I weigh a lot.&nbsp; I had lost 50 some pounds a year ago with Weight Watchers, I was very pleased with my experience.&nbsp; I don't know what happened, but I've gained it all back. I need to get over this and move along.&nbsp; I need to stop feeling sorry for myself. I just need to bet back on that WW horse and say, " Getty up!"&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp; Ok, I have issues.&nbsp; I don't think a person gets to 310 without some.&nbsp; I tell you, I was shocked when I got on my home scale and it went past 300.&nbsp; I thought maybe 290, or 285, NOT 310!!! I'm right back at square one.&nbsp; No wait a minute, I have learned something, and it was a shock. Maybe that was my "a ha" moment I keep reading about.  &nbsp;&nbsp; One thing I do know, it seems it takes more than being sick of being fat.&nbsp; For I am sick sick sick of it.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been embarrassed, too. That hasn't motivated me, in fact that just makes me want to eat all the more !!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I'm going to keep on keeping on for now  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  amie

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, hello out there, all you bloggers.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm very new to this, a little nervous, but here I go.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm 42, married with two teen sons.&nbsp; I am an RN, I work at a geriatric psych acute care facility, I'm the day charge nurse, meaning, I just happened to be the bossiest when the job opened.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The focus of this blog is to document my journey to fitness.&nbsp; I've struggled all my life with low self esteem and a high weight.&nbsp; I've been up and down the scale, motivated, unmotivated, frustrated, left out, made fun of, heart broke, and penniless.&nbsp; Well, not penniless, I got carried away.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will post my weight every week.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will post my thoughts here, for all&nbsp;to see.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will faithfully&nbsp;go to my Weight Watcher meetings every Sat AM.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will walk at least 5 times a week.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will&nbsp;write down everything I put in my mouth, maybe not here.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will do my best to support you, my blog friends.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today, my weight is 310.&nbsp; I walked 2 miles. I stayed on program.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yours truly,&nbsp; Rikgril  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
