      Hi there, i am dying from boredom at the moment - i am in half term. THere is no food in the house. Nothing to do. No friends. I am living on the internet. I am soooooooooo board. To be quite frank i have compleatly forgotten to keep my blog updated. So im gonna do a big post to keep everyone updated and awake!   So no valantines... im gonna die soon - no boys at all. maybe i am gay?! ummmmm no! - hope not anyway! thats my love life done - although there is a really cute guy on the bus. I bet he will never ask me out!  school is sooooo boring as well. Why the hell did i take latin? we have a latin trip soon and i hate the latin teacher. :( - oh woe is i! lol at least we miss maths! we have a french trip to! (why the hell did i do french?) but we miss biology which is fine! we have a big music concert soon as well. I have loads of rehursals so im gonna be missing school. The only thing that is bad is that i am missing physics. thats the only thing that i enjoy at school. Well i like sports, music, chem and physics and thats it.   Life is crap - i am just feeling really depressed at the moment. I am just depressed. Its cos i have no contact with any of my friends :( - awww i miss them all.  awww im gonna cry now...

      I am soooooo tired we just had a DofE training expedition. We had to sleep in a tent all nigh with cat, Chloe, Sophie and me!, it was pissing it down and the wind almost blew the tent down! (it stayed up though! - just!) The night before we had to cook our own dinner on a really little crap stove thing! It took ages and we didn't get to eat much! Then the next day we woke up at 4.30 because of the wind. We had to take Sophie to the loo because she was scared! After we went to the loo Ellie m went and the little toilet tent fell down on her! It was relay funny!! He he. Anyway we packed up our tent which was wet and then had breakfast of hot choc and black toast (not because we burnt it but because we cooked it on the crappy stove!) and then we took our very very very heavy bags up a steep hill to the obelisk! and then back down the hill again (once we had wrapped Alice in a orange blanket because we had to practice emergencies - you see Ali fell down a rabbit hole and broke her leg! Not really though! LOL) when we got back to school we had to wash everything that was covered in mud and then go to school concert rehearsals and the concert. We got to bed at about 11.pm which  doesn't seem much but we were up at 4.30 that morning! Then they wanted us awake for school this morning! - fat chance LOL. Anyway that was my weekend! eventful huh?  we finish school this week on friday - a well earned rest i think! but i am going skiing so i will have to be active for another week! ugh! anyway i have loads of free time and nothing to do - actually i have 2 preps to do but i cant be bothered so i will do them later! he he.  blog later heather

      Hi there! at the moment i am in a food tech lesson! the teacher is not here so the whole class are working in the IT suite! (or pissing around like me!) - he he! how amusing ;). Anyway i have survived today, but the most stupid thing happened in physics, what happened was we were using reed relay, which you need a magnet of some kind! So when we went to tidy up there was a magnet missing - just a bog standard magnet! anyway our teacher got really annoyed and made us stay in after the lesson - we had to go to spanish though so she made us all come back before lunch, or we would get a detention. So we went back after lunch and had a 10 min talk with the head of faculty. All just for the stupid bar magnet! Then we were late for lunch! so anyway we are all a little bit narked with our teacher! Anyway in spanish we had our aural exams - it went really well, i think i got full marks! ;) - anyway ttyl cos i need to get work done! hedge

      Hello there! sorry i have not updated this blog for ABSOLUTLY ages! lol - anyway i have half an hour so im gonna update you with all the stuff ihave been doing recently and all the stuff that pisses me off and generally life! (which by the way is a bitch!)  Anyway im going from last weekend, which was an exeat so we had the weekend off! Basicaly the weekend is where i catch up on lost sleep but i woke up at 7am both days! thats before i wake up in the week! Anyway the daytime wasnt much better as i had my family  bitching and constantly moaning at me! it was boring and horrid so i went onto the computer for the whole day! I learnt some more HTML and went onto my old email account and found that i had an email from neopets about my account which had been unfrozen! I was sooooooooooo happy so i played all day and had no dinner! My mum was in such a bad mood so i kicked her too! in all a bad day! - knowing how saturday went on sunday i went straight to the computer and spent more time on there! Then i came off the computer at 7pm and did my homework and some revision! it was boring but i had to do it until 9pm when i went and had a shower. I then got told off for avoiding jobs by having a shower and i said that i needed to have a wash! this started another argument so i took my dinner and ate it in my bedroom watching tv until 11.30pm. So when i woke up today i was absolutly shattered, this wasnt helped by the fact that i had to sit through the most boring lessons and assembly! and now i am here writing about today! kinda odd! i bet when i get home i will not have fun! and i will probably go and revise on the computer and play games till late and have no dinner AGAIN! i hate food! it makes me to large tummied and i hate my tummy and bum! i need to loose weight! - i will go and run the 1500 tomorrow! (ok so i will probably not!) anyway we have a rounders match on thursday and saturday! so i will get fit then, and then go to the gym at the weekend! Anyway i will go and die now! cos i have been typing for ages!  ttyl hedge

      Grrrrr! stupid IT teacher (who shall remain unnamed) decided to go and tell the whole class that i made a website! which is fine but now i am getting loads of stick from everyone cos they think that i should hav got the IT cup for the end of year prizes! - actuallly, i think that i am better at IT than the person who won. :( - idiot.  Anyway yesterday in hymn prac the head teacher announced the winners of the end of year prizes. In each year there is a prize winner and then highly commended. I never get these so i was EXTATIC when i got highly commended - its great cos one person i dont like didnt get one and she was soooooo pissed off!!! hardiharharhar!!! ;) - woo! go me!  Anyway, one more week of school. One more week of Ivydene. One more week of the art block. then 8 weeks of nothing! oh joy - (not) but im gonna learn CSS and javascript over the holls and then i will make a website that kicks ass!   HUH! lucky me! - two more weeks of DoE service and i am done for bronze :D  - tonight i take the brownies swimming - oh joy.  anyway cant be bothered to write more! talk later hedge

      OMG! i really cant tell you my true feelings about this cos it is such a HUGE thing that has happened. - The only thing i can tell you is about what happened today.  When we got to school we were sent to the boarding houses. When we were all there the headmistress of our school, Mrs Leggate, told us that our school was going to make a new drama department but to do this they had to close one of the boarding houses, and they had chosen my house, Ivydene, to close. They are going to do this at the end of the summer term - three weeks time. :(  They are going to sell the house then - it will probably be demolished cos is has asbestos in the walls. Sniffle.   Anyway - the only thing good today was that i got 97% in music - top marks in music for the year of 50 people! :D - suppose that made me a little happier!  Anyway need to go and practice my clarinet.  ttyl hedge
