      Finally found the time to sit down and write again.  Nine-to-fiving it is not my cup of mint-tea, but I'm slowly adapting (is that a good or a bad thing?).  Anyways, much has happened in these first three weeks that needs proper rambling to be put into place.  Let's see...  LARPed over the weekend.  If you are among the vast majority of sane Americans who don't know what that is then shame on you for not opening your mind, broadening your horizons, and all that other uncreative crap.  www.masi.us should give you an idea of what I'm talking about.  So I spent the weekend in the woods, rain soaked, mosquito drained, bruised, bloodied, and shamelessly covered in mud - in otherwords: in absolute bliss.  I find it funny how I like spending a weekend busting my ass for the enjoyment of others better than getting blitzed and hanging out at a party.  I always knew college life wasn't my scene, but it's frighteningly easy to be sucked into believing that it is what I should like, even now that I've gradumutated.

      So I've settled in to my first week of work and I just discovered that I'm psychic.  All day I've walked into the room just as someone said my name, or picked up the phone the second someone called me.  I was thinking of writing a letter to someone and they appeared in front of me.  Needless to say, things are good. The apartment's great - my roomates, likewise - and my neighbors are quite friendly.  I think this is going to be a great summer.  At least it's been a great week.   I was a little bothered that I wasn't going to be able to make it to my brother's bachelor party - I still have two more weeks until I get paid, and I'm sufficiently broke to be unable to make it down to boston.  But true to uncanny form, the party I was fretting missing got cancelled.  Things have a funny way of working out. So I'm making dinner with Kate and Laurel tonight - two classy chicks who redefine the meaning of cool.  This came as the end of a long held phobia of mine, asking a girl out to dinner.  Don't get me wrong, I've been in numerous relationships of all levels of intimacy.  I've just never felt comfortable asking someone out to dinner.  Requesting casual sex hasn't posed a problem, but, there's I've always been reluctant to ask for their culinary company.  This may say something about my priorities. Anyways (stalling for thoughts)...   work has been good so far.  I like my job, picking up where I left off last summer after I got laid off during the school year.  Nothing's more embarassing than being laid off from a campus job.  Well, I can think of a few notable exceptions, but it still sucks. So I'm here, back at college but without the homework.  Just how I like it.  I can tell the group of people I'm living with (there's five more or less living in my apartment now) are going to be a load of fun.  We're already planning the 50 Drinking Games in One Night Party.  *Sigh*  Irresponsible young adult life is good.

      Drove to Portland with my mother today to get measured for a tux for my brother's wedding.  The man working at the suit-store surprised me with his grace and professionalism.  I have seen few people in my life more respectable or confident in what he was doing.  Made me feel older, more professional myself.  Funny the places inspiration strikes.  It's utterly surreal that my brother is getting married this summer.  He's always been somewhat distant from me, but then I feel I've always been somewhat distant from my life in general.  These brief islands of meaningful family events crop up every now and then, but it's far from the photo-album impressions of adulthood I had in my youth.  I guess this is part of my passage into manhood, letting go of the dream that I'll suddenly wake up one day and know what's going on.  I hate terms like passage into manhood and coming of age, but I can't help but chuckle at the truth of them when I come out the other side.  Whoever is writing this story of mine sure has a funny sense of irony.   The highlight of an otherwise disappointing (1:5 odds my ass) and depressing day (good-bye, Gipper) had to be the discovery that I know how to make pizza.  This noble task had always fallen to my brother when we were children, but I surpised myself and my parents for reinventing the not-quite-from-scratch art of pizza making in the Powell House.  Beats the Crispy Chicken from Burger King I had for breakfast.  For those of you who don't know me, I am one of the few people I've ever met who has a bitter dislike with breakfast foods.  Muffins, bagels, eggs of all textures and viscosities, toast, fruit, pancakes, waffles, and worst of all breakfast ceareal - long have these morning delights plagued my strange and twisted stomache.  When I get up in the morning all I want is a burger.  Is that so unusual?  If you were starving in the desert which would you rather, a bowl of cold, mushy, sugar-satured grains, or a pound of sizzling beef draped in the warm embrace of cheese?  I must admit, I was a part-time vegetarian during my college years, but the thought of breakfast foods for breakfast still ran chills through my bones and waves of nausea through my stomache.  Anyways.  I'm off for an icecream sandwich and some tums.  Maybe that'll cheer me up.

      And how!  For the first day in over two weeks, there's sun.  Beautiful, life-giving sun.  And a nice cool breeze.  I feel inspired.  I even vacuumed this morning.  I must be coming down with something.  Breaking in the dancing feet again.  There's nothing quite like the guilty pleasure of blasting 'NSYNC and Backstreet and busting out some new moves across the family-room floor when you're home alone.   urlLink Tom Cruise  would be proud.  I seem to have gotten the spring back to my step again.  The knees aren't aching any more.  There's nothing worse than creaky joints before you make it half-way to middle-age.  (Side note: I seem to be going hyphen-happy lately - weird)  I just wrote something interesting, but lost it when I went to  urlLink dictionary.com  to look up the word 'sans'.  I knew I knew what it meant, but I wanted to be sure.  Part of my newly blossoming, self-imposed OCD I suppose.  And now I've gone and lost a paragraph that I was excited to write.  I mean, how many times do you get to use 'sans' in casual conversation?   Paragraph sans excitement. Paragraph sans point. Oh well.  I find myself utterly paralyzed, staring at the trees blowing in the wind.  I thought it chintzy when John Travolta did it in  urlLink Phenomenon , but there's something to be said for simple pleasures.  Idle tree watching would be tops on my list.  Followed closely by supermanning into my super-soft futon, slipping on socks fresh from the dryer on a chilly day, mint lip balm, and of course killing kittens.  (Side note: I would never, in fact,  urlLink harm a kitten  - chickens on the other hand, they just creep me out and I'm happy to  urlLink commit mass chickencide  - you see I knew this flock of free range chickens when I was in Australia - they were awesome - anyways, my favorite chook somehow hurt hurself and started bleeding when suddenly her carniverous band of merry hens decided to peck her to death and fight over her vital organs - if that doesn't convince you  urlLink this will )  Good God, I can't believe I'm up before noon.  I just don't know what to do with myself.  I suppose I should go out and enjoy the sun while it's decided to make an appearance, but I'm afraid it's just a hoax.  Mother Nature luring us outside so She can dump two more weeks of rain on our heads.  Just to punish us further for living in Maine.  I can't wait to get out of this place.  But I will miss it.

        So, I finally came to that place. You know, the ultimate post-show let down.  Only the show lasted four years and was kinda called my College Education - or more hiply - my College Experience.  Like four years of putting up with cynical (but loveable) yuppies wasn't enough, now I either have to become a corporate potato or flee the country to avoid 40k plus in college loans that I *slightly* remember taking.   I think the biggest thing I'm going to miss about old Bowdoin will be the food.  I loved that dining hall.  1st in the nation, damn straight.  That and the bathroom.  I will always be fond of a person that cleans my puke from the sink and smiles at me the next day.  Joyce, you are my personal angel for that.   So that place I was talking about.  You all know it.  Sitting at home.  Wondering how you survived four years of this through highschool.  Feeling like a stranger in the one place you've called home all your life, but which now has the dull name of your Parent's House.  And everyone keeps asking you in hushed tones if you've thought of your future yet, like it's some sort of insider joke - boy you must be asked that a lot.  Well no.  I haven't been asked that nearly enough.  And certainly not enough from the sort of people who would inspire me to actually want to find my calling in life.  You know the type of person I'm talking about; the ones you ask for a cup of sugar and they somehow get you to join the Peace Corps.   I'm ranting now, trying to sound like a real writer whose long-winded tirades somehow worm their way into your heart and make you feel all fuzzy inside.  I hate and love that shit, much like most of that shit out there I guess.  But where does that get me?  Four years of putting the liberal in my liberal arts career (we're talking Women's Studies, Government, Buddhism, Italian, Spanish, Native American spirituality, even a class on Japanimation and Manga!) and out of all of that, I think my greatest classes were in cynicism and lethargy.  Is this really what yuppies do for fun?  Am I doomed to analyze a life that I only half live in moments of lucid daydreaming?  Can I think of some witty or poignent end to this, my first entry, one that will let me go back to obsessively checking my email and wishing someone would come on instant messenger?   Or is this, as the movies asks, as good as it gets?   Well, I doubt it.   But if I'm going to start living that life I've dreamt of, might as well start here at home.  I guess I should dig that Computer Science diploma out of the glove box where I left it graduation day (I still don't understand a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science) and put it to some sort of use.   Even if I couldn't afford the $100 frame for it.

      Alright. So I've been avoiding writing in my blog for too long.  I tried to be all clever and witty and expressive with my writing, but it just turned into a cheap immitation.  So I stopped writing.  I put my head down and tried to plow through this summer, as if something better were waiting on the other side.  Some other time I'd have the inspiration to begin writing again.  Well, bullshit.  This is not a work of art, or at least that should not be its driving force.  This is my conscience, my voice, and my mirror.  I don't even think there's a single person out there who reads it, so it's about time to put these words to good use - that is, to start making some consistent sense out of my life.  I'm always afraid to write about my philosophies - they sound so trite and self-riteous when I go back to read them later (I think trite and self-riteous describes most of philosophy for that matter).  Writing through self-consciousness is bit like shooting through a slump in basketball, only way to get your rhythm back is to keep at it.  So that's what I'm doing.  The best thing I ever did for writing was keep a 'throw away' notebook.  I made myself just write whatever, not worrying about its quality, all the time knowing this was just excercise - nothing I would want to keep for later.  It gets me out of my head.  Softens my focus, so I'm not so worried about the product, and more invovled and interested in the process.  It's also really good for organizing my thoughts.  Not necessarily so I can sort out specific thoughts, but so that my mind becomes comfortable with following through on moments of inspiration.  It's a matter of tricking my mind into getting out of the way so my self can come through.  I like that description.  Anyways, that's what this was supposed to be, and that's what it shall be.  Maybe eventually I can stop writing about my writing and get on with my writing.  Here's to perfect simplicity.

      Something beautiful just happened:   I was looking for apartments in San Francisco and came across a message written by a woman out there.  Something about it inspired me.  Here's the response I wrote:   ...I couldn't shake the feeling of laying on my back in a field of daisies, coaxing the clouds with my eyes into giant whales and majestic sky ships, sails billowing to carry them off to some distant horizon.  Lately I've been reluctantly shutting myself off from lazy afternoons in my mind, trying to focus myself on a world that I can only half imagine somewhere out in the mysterious 'there', where careers are made and my debts repaid.  I used to love weaving little stories, little patchworks of pictures and poems, little rhymes like daisy-chains to set on my head as king of the clouds, happy on my throne of words.  But the words left me.  My education sapped from me the nectar I squeezed from life, the simple pleasures I had idly sipped upon, oblivious of how good I had it.  Somehow the belief that I must reach for more - become something more - sucked the air from my sails and set me to dreaming of distant cities filled with busy people with busy jobs and busy lives.  But like the clouds I kept these visions far above me, distant, safe.  I stayed close to home, pushing my way through college in the town in which I was born.  Under the watchful wisdom of the white pines of my home I forced myself into a culture and a society that turned my stomach and suffocated my dreams.  Somehow I limped through, earned my piece of paper that qualifies me fit for fine society, and arrived here - half-way to middle age, searching for a new place to settle down and begin my second life.  This morning I was searching for an apartment, a career, a lifestyle in a city where I thought I could see myself living.  This afternoon, I found myself in a field of daisies.  I don't quite know why, but I feel like after reading your post I woke up - not from a dream - but into a dream, a familiar dream where the edges of the world are soft and forgiving and open to gentle breezes and light touches.  I don't know who you are, but I wanted to give to you my deepest thanks for reminding me how to see.  May peace, wisdom, and grace always be with you, A young man from a distant coast.

      I've done it; I've decided where I want to live and stake out my fortune.  San Francisco seems to have it all: crazy stuff to do; crazy, openminded people; crazy weather; and crazy money to be made.  And crazy suits me just fine.  This comes after a near-miss with an impending depression that forced me to take a sober look at my life (well, I wasn't exactly sober at the time, but perhaps a sobering look at my life).  My brother got hitched over the weekend (beautiful ceremony, reception, and all - Virginia sure is purty) and his friends got me blitzed.  14 hours of riding cramped in the back seat of our Impala brought me back to my parent's house.  I'm not sure which is more contricting, being sealed in the back of a car with a raging hangover or being secuestered at my former home without license or wheels to set me free.
