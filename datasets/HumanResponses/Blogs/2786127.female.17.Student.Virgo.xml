      BaD mood!! Winter really has its way of bringing someone down. Someone being me, down as in...everyday has that definate blah factor. I'm talking to my ex right now, Tim, more bad moodness! I need to be off, and sleep, and not be so crazy tired for school tommorow. A tout a l'heure.

      So. Sex in the City, a show i've never been introduced to until tonight. Strange because a main point in the show is power to women, women who get what they want, casual sex...and such. But sitting there thinking about it all...I just don't think i could ever do that. Meet a guy, date him for a few weeks, have sex many times with him...to find out that he's been dateing other women. It would tear me up inside...i would be so horribly messed up emotionally! i just can't understand people like that...how everything is so completely impersonal. It drove me crazy to watch the women have one nights stands and then carry on the next day...as if nothing was wrong with what they just did. Not that there is anything wrong with that, ugh, it would just drive me crazy! i would be thinking about it all the next day, freaking out about how the guy doesnt really care about me at all, that im just another piece of ass. BOTTOM LINE. I miss having someone to care about, and to care about me. Strange how a show about women in their 30's haveing casual sex made me miss a boy that i could hug and hold in my arms...and look up into his eyes and see him smile. I hate high school, i want out!! I dont want high school relationships anymore. I wish i didnt feel this way because i am in fact still 17 and shouldnt be worrying about finding someone that i can have a really meaningful relationship with. not that i worry about it....i just want it.   ugh. Im off. I'm sick of thinking about something i cannot remedy at the moment.

      So.  Today had to be the most hellish boring day ever. It started off okay, church, and then a little macaroni grill for lunch (no complaints there) and then....it just went absolutly nowhere! I sat on my ass, spent two hours making a cd for nate, and ate. What an exciting day for jessica. Nate needs to call me right now so i can go away from this house.  I went to the sweethearts dance last night. Way fun...my best friends makenzie and lindsay were there and they actually danced with me. yay! They said they wouldnt dance so i was sad but then they did so it was a better night then i expected. And yes...for those of you who have read Jon's blog I did in fact have some "black light" issues if you will. If i don't know what im talking about then well....for the better my friends.   So im still really bored. I thought maybe this would unbored me for awhile, but this all took me about two minutes to write, so thats two minutes of something to do, meaning...GOD IM SO BORED.  I'm getting my hair dyed tommorow. yay. i also have to visit good old doctor bob, my dentist, tommorow as well. not cool. I hate the dentist.

      MM. blog.  I'm desperatly tired...i did zero homework tonight...was supposed to read a bunch of The Great Gatsby but...didnt...I like the book but oh well, its easy to find other things to do besides read.   Why do i make myself stay up late. I'm going to make myself eggs and toast tommorow morning. Yum! If i go to sleep now...i'm that much closer to my eggs and toast...  GOOOD BYYYYEEE -jessica. kjfkalgfgkjgklgjkl;dklah;  Oh yes, tommorow is nate and I's 4 month anniversary(?) Should be interesting as to weather or not he remembers. I doubt he even knows what day of the week it is today.   Volleyball has got me down. My team is a whole bunch of nothing.

      Okay. Feeling a bit stupid...took me quite awhile to figure out how to write in this thing again. *head shake* Well, i am ridiculous, suppose its expected.  So i was on the phone WAY to much today and for some reason i've really grown a strong dislike for the phone as a means of conversation. Tim called to see how my weekend was, babbled about that for quite some time. *unfortunatly* I didnt get to hear about his because Nate showed up to say hello. So i got off the phone and watched a little bit of the 'ball...football...superbowl...stuff. Many a time I've watched a football game and still i have no idea what goes on it that game. I just made fun of the replay action, slowmotion big chunky men in WAY to tight of pants...fat slowly jiggling from side to side...um, ew. While i was laughing about that my dad and my uncle were yelling random "oooohhh yeeeeahh" s from the other room and a few "WOOOOO!!!"s to go with them. Football is a strange thing indeed.    But back to the phone. So Nate was sitting around *entranced* by the big beefy men tackling each other while i was contemplating weather or not i should go in the family room and steal that last sugar cookie sitting on the table when Genie called and saved me from certain cookie fat doom. I talked to her awhile about her strange incident with her treadmill and a semi-"special" kid that came over with a bunch of her other friends. He had a mullet, and was approaching the lovely "obesity" stage of his life apparently. Long story short the kid fell flat on his face while jogging on the tread mill and chipped his too front teeth. So now the kids got a lot of good things going for him, I mean, seriously...he's got a kick ass haircut, lots of fat to keep him warm this winter, "Friends" that only keep him around because its fun to make him do stupid things, and NOW he has carnie teeth. I wish i could find a guy like that, thats definatly hot.   SO THE PHONE. Genie let me go, I let nate go, and then i had to talk to tim some more. SO talking talking, told him i had to do math homework, he let me go. Makenzie doesnt want me to get good grades in school so she called me almost the minute after i had gotten off with tim. Disscussed some things with her, found out theres a chem test tommorow... she was the bringer of bad news, so i told i her i must leave and i hung up.  So, i guess i just don't like the phone. Haha...what a great story about apsolutly nothing.  hmm. I should sleep. I get to go dress shopping this week (!) Dances are my favorite things ever. -Jesska (as jon would call me, its apparently my new nickname that i had no idea about.)

      umm...yeah hotmail isn't working. I suppose not up until these last moments of desperately trying to get it to work that i've realized that i'm completely obsessed with email...i check it three, four, five times a day. Or more. Its thrilling in a way, some kind of strange hope that someone will for a minute sit down and think...hey...i should write to jessica because well i can...it excites me immensly. Horrible horrible addiction.   I've decided on the most true statement of all time just now.   What goes around comes around, everything goes in circles   I swear to god everytime i think "oh yeah this is going to come back and bite me in the ass" and sure enough...it always does. If i hurt someone, weeks, months later the same thing happens to me. grr. Now i'm going to go listen to the old Incubus CD and reminise about when things really sucked, because thats when i listened to this cd.  I need a good moshing concert to cheer me up. A fight circle... thats what i need. RAr.

      My car is full of ballons and tiny shreds of blue confetti. Do you know how HARD it is to remove small blue party confetti from...well...anywhere?!?! Most of all my car. So, I'm leaving it there. It gives my car a little special "somethin" anyways.   Back up...  So yes this is what matt did to ask me to prom. Completely filled up my car with balloons candy and confetti while i was in school today. I knew something was going to go down with my car because staci had to steal my keys...and I wasn't supposed to know "what for", but...you know. why else. Makenzie and lindsay and I dreamed of all the things he could be doing to my car all day in school. Our favorite happened to be the way he would ask me to marry him, because he's "clearly in love with me" so makenzie says. He would write "just married" on my car window and underneath the balloons a priest would be hiding and when I opened my car *surprise* He'd jump out and marry us there on the spot. What we found most amusing about this was how long could the priest *really* last in the car? We thought it would be funnier if we found the priest dead under the balloons. HAHA....how morbid.  I need to go to grassroots...volleyball...stupid.   its just easy cheese beansta- Makenzie

      The only good thing about tommorow is I get a "prom surprise". not really a surprise anymore because staci told me I was getting one... way to ruin that one stace.   I'm covering up my embarrasment when im playing with my team with unbridled rage. I get soo disgustingly pissed now when im playing. I need school varsity to start up again so i can play some REAL volleyball.  I need to go shave my legs.  Am I dateing Nate? I'm scared to ask him if we are. He was gone in Disneyland for a week and i haven't talked to him like...at all...since he got back. Is it wrong that i want to play it like a "whore" right now? I'm not going to dance around and sleep with everyone persay...I just want to date a bunch of guys at the same time. Why? because I can...and I've always been tied down. Its time for somthing new, and my dad won't give me money for a new bathing suit so this will just have to do.  My bed looks inviting. sleep.

      MRAAAHHHH get my team out of my face!! I dont' want to go to practice tonight my team is complete ass. No one cares about winning or playing well anymore and its pissing the hell out of me because not only is it embarrasing to be on a fucking stupid team, but its just pissing me off because i'm a competitive person by nature and when people don't care about winning as much as i do i get frustrated.   MRAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! WE lost every single game this weekend. I told my dad I was quitting because my team was shit and he told me I couldn't because im the captain and I couldn't let the girls down like that. To hell i couldnt, they wouldnt even care.  I need a tan before prom.  I want to go dress shopping.   I have to go to volleyball. Piss.

       "The heart has it's reasons of which reason knows nothing"-Blaise Pascal    NOt that this quote has anything to do with anything right now.  SO the Wisdom teeth thing sucked major ass, I spent all of yesterday laying around on vicadin feeling sorry for myself and listened to my tummy rumble because all i could eat yesterday was applesauce. Some good came of it though, i found out that my friends really do love me. Strange, you'd think I'd already know that, but its been questionable before. Makenzie Ashley and Staci all came over yesterday and brought me flowers and cookie dough ice cream. And then later after i woke up looking like ick matt came over and brought me a teddy bear and some flowers :) yay for boys and teddy bears.  Meh.  I found out theres NOTHING of value to watch on tv...ever...yesterday when my sister and dad left me all alone for 5 hours. I got so bad that everytime I stood up i felt like i had to throw up because i had swallowed so much blood. Yes, disgusting. So i couldnt get up to get my vicadin or fill up my ice bag. I'll even admit that i cried a little because i was all alone and in pain. Hey, if no one would pity me i just had to do it myself.   LIndsay came over today. LINDSAY, on her own free will. it was amazing, i was dumbfounded. Though she did only stay for like ten minutes, it was good that she came over to say hi.   I went and painted a youth room today, orange green and blue. NOT good looking colors together. meh, not my youth room. And my face is puffalicious.  not that that has anything to do with painting a room.  I think...the medication might be getting to me. I'm rambling on about nothing. Soooo...I'm going to go find something to do. something that i can write about in here later. yes.

      And then there was...something.  So I just returned from a weekend with Tim. So I'm sitting here in my half *clean* room dreading tommorow where i "go under the knife" and have a 1% chance of losing all feeling in my lower jaw. Though slim, I HATE that chance...that pesky little 1 damn percent. I will kill you.  My room smells delicious because I've lit candles everywhere not only for the awesome atmosphere but because i need to be surrounded with a nice smell for a change. This past weekend I've been dancing around Tim's apartment, public restrooms, and airports. All smell pretty damn icky.   I have actual things of importance to write, yes, but its late and I just don't feel like talking about them.  Okay. Fine.  So this weekend was, well, tim. We drove up to Moscow so i could hang out with him in his college apartment. Though he usually has his roomate around (Erin) this weekend she was in Boise visiting some peeps, so It ended up just being Tim and I. And no, dirty minded bastards, we didnt do *anything* due to the isolation, thank you. In fact i didnt even really feel like cuddling with Tim while watching a movie...Its strange because lately I've been very...just personal bubbly. Especially with boys. I think I'm finding out that I just really don't want one right now...theres to many to think about and choose and I dont want to share affection with just one... This sucks. I remember getting pissed at Nate for talking about how the morman religion used to encourage a man to marry many women. He said that he would totally do that, and i got really pissed about it. He said" but jessica, I'd love every wife just as much as the other." yeah, that pissed me off too.  But now i Guess i see what he means a bit.   I care about Tim, still. I do...but he's the hardest to deal with, because if i give my heart to him then it needs to be all the way, i mean, i can't have any regrets or doubts. He's called me "the one" and his mom was talking about marrage the other day witch WAAAYY freaks me out.    Nate and I spent a full 7 hours the other night walking around my neighborhood and talking on my front steps. We both miss each other and have decided to start hanging out again to see what happens. Lately I've missed him the most...but i think it just might be because he was my most recent boyfriend. I dont think he's the one for me. meh.    Ben, of all people, is trying to hang out with me again. Intentions? unclear.   Matt? wants to date me, tried to cuddle with me and kiss me tonight at Mark's house. NOt feeling that...ugh.    BAH! I dont want to waste my spring break eating apple sauce, sitting in bed in pain and feeling sorry for myself. I like my wisdom teeth right where they are thank you. They never hurt anyone... why don't you just back off crazy ass dentist...  I had a great day today. I always feel fulfilled when i hang out with alot of people. Genie and I went to the zoo earlier today. Lame, but meh something to do. After lunch she took me home and I called up ashley to see what was going on. We called up staci, got together with her and played in the park a bit and hung out. Then we took ash home, picked up chris and matt, and I danced around with them for awhile. But...sadly i didnt want to hot tub with matt tonight, because of the bad mood about fondlige...(  mmm...maybe i should sleep.  yeah. I think I'll go do that.

      SHOPPING DRIVES ME CRAZY. I always drop into a way depressed mode after shopping. It makes me realize how gross I am :( sad. bad self esteem.  I went to coffee with ben today. Strange. so very strange. I remember why we used to be good friends though...him and I have an easy time talking to each other. Thats rare with me, having someone around thats easy to talk to. right now the only people i have for that are tim and makenzie. I used to have lindsay, but as previously stated, no more.  My hair needs to be CUT. Its way to dead and blonde and over stripped of all its natural beauty and nutrients. Stupid freshman year where i began this stupid hair dye journey. Now look where its gotten me. Its lead me straight into the hands of hair death. I can't cut it right now though i desperately wish too. Must keep long hair for senior pictures in about 4 months. must...resist temptation... I have so much shit to do tonight but here i sit typing on this because i don't want to do anything. That and I'm waiting around for nate to come over...I'm scared. I hope...he still misses me i guess. I dont know. BAh. I need to pack because i leave tommorow. And i need to do homework, because in us history i'm BARELy pulling off a B at them moment and i can't blow off this stupid paper thats due tommorow that i've had all week to do but somehow *magically* haven't started until...well...i haven't even started it yet. hmm.  I feel sick. to much coffee. Stupid not sleeping...ever. I have to go.

      ...  Strange but i've never missed or wanted a person back as badly as i do my best friend lindsay.  Today i found out that she thinks we've changed to much to be friends anymore.  I say yes we've changed...but not that much...she just needs to give us a chance.  I think it hurts more then anything to see that she doesn't care as much about us not being friends as I do. Its killing me right now. It's like she doesn't remember how much fun we used to have and...just everything. I don't know how to go about getting her back either. I feel like I'm trying to get back a boyfriend cause this is how I act in such a situation...only for some reason it seems alot harder to do this.  I just wish she'd come to me and try to be friends with me again...but i just don't think she wants to anymore...and everytime i ask if she wants to do something shes..busy. Depressed. I'm going to go finish off the chocolate cake in my kitchen and watch trading spaces and pout to myself.

      I went and saw his play...Nates play... last night..."Titanic"...with Matt. I saw Dan and was thrilled because I haven't seen Dan since Nate and I broke up and I love Dan. We did some catching up and he was surprised when I told him the real reasons that Nate and I broke up. Nate did A great Job of avoiding me the ENTIRE time, in fact it was quite obvious that it was deliberate avoidance. Nate looked really hot though in the play...and I couldnt take my eyes off him. The play required alot of sitting for him on stage and everyone had a blank look as they stare off the the side, or stare forward, but I caught his eyes many times stareing at me. God It made me miss him so bad...and then they're was intermission. Dan thought it would be quite interesting to see what would happen if I met the girl that Nate wanted to break up with me for...because dan is a drama queen. So I met her...she's really pretty and I guess I can't blame him because compared to me she's alot better looking...and then she left after an uncomfortable meeting, and then dan told me. "We've been talking backstage, Nate and I, and he misses you". He just had to say it didnt he.     So the play finished up and the cast started mingling amoung the audience...except for Nate...who again hid the entire time...   I miss him. I hate this. I want him to go away. I have to go to school.

      So. I get on here to write a blog...and my favorite person pops up out of no where. nate. My stomach is getting tied up in knots My brain is yelling at me "don't talk to him he's a jerk you dumped him for a reason stop being nice be a bitch be bitch" and yet I'm sitting here having a conversation with him. What is this.  ARRRGGGGGHHHHH why do i do this....he has to leave right now but he says he'll be back in a half an hour and we can talk...I need to go to BED because i have school tommorow and yet here im going to sit and wait for him to get back. I'm SO DRUNK when im tired... this is ridiculous. And here i sit...i'm going to go read. or something. sit and wait. twiddle my thumbs because im pathetic. PATHETIC. go to bed.

      You know...you get to a point were you realize that your life has been a complete sham...that all those times you thought you had a tiny infetismal bit of happiness in your life you've come to realize that they were nothing at all...just times you were a little less stressed and a little less anxious.  Hanging out with Matt makes me feel this way. I see how relaxed he is, and how social he is...and how horribly uptight and worried I am when im around people. What do I say next? they hate me don't they...they want me to say something now....i need to say something good or they'll think im so and so way... How do i stop feelings like this? I feel like my entire high school career has been a complete joke...best time of your life my ass.  to many times have i been hurt by people that its corrupted my vision of how people are supposed to be...I've told myself to "relax, just be yourself and they'll like you" But...what if this is me? A wound-up girl who freaks out all the time....untalkative and "stuck up" and anxious...In this case i must admit that i hate myself completely, and therefore can blame no one else for disliking me, or ignoring me...or not listening to me....like most people do.  I wish I could take back the years of pain so I could have a pure mind.  I'm in a foul mood right now, with the realization that i haven't had one PURE happy moment in years. literally. I'm in hell.

      It really needs to stop raining. If I have to get my hair wet ONE MORE TIME running into school for first period... heads will roll. I got John in trouble with his girlfriend yesterday, for having sex in his car. Just jokeing...though thats what she probably thinks, when in actuality he drove to chruch with me. Ridiculous.  The O.C. has lost it's appeal to me, sadly enough. I miss having episodes of Sex in the City to watch, must go rent season 2.... but before that, i need to go to school.

      hung out with the genesta today. Good fun, I've decided Genie is a really great person to talk to because, well, she talks back. Unlike some people...i know...their name might possibly ryme with MACY...or be a song or something....  someone just pulled up...talk to ya lata....i needt o investigate.

      The best part of waking up...is finding a new bra missing??!?!   ....  Yeah...so I'm dancing around my room this morning to Genies mix cd she made me ( war, all of the time in the shadow of the new york skyline...*dance*)  and decide that hell, i've only worn my cute new blue bra only once since i bought it like, two weeks. ago. So I slide over to my dresser, open my underwear drawer, don't immediatly see it, so i fondle through all the stuff. ?. Not there. at all. And i know it was in there because i had seen it in there a few days ago...and i haven't moved it.  what the hell. whos been rummaging through my underwear drawer and snatching things?  Its not my sister, she takes countless other things from me but a bra, it would be pointless. I'm three sizes bigger then her. Logically it doesn't make sense.  okay.   So...only other person in my house is my dad...and god i hope he didnt take it cause, well...that would be somewhat uncomfortable....  none of danielles friends would have taken it, all of them have the same issue as she does (size AA issues...*cough*) The only friends of mine who are the same size as me are staci and makenzie...staci i dont allow in my house anymore because shes driving me crazy, and maknenzie? I'd like to think she wouldn't take it, in fact i know she didnt...she would tell me that she's snatching it.  so who the hell...i need to go all Nancy Drew on this mysteries ass...

I'm feeling so tired and sick lately...I think my medication is to blame for the stomach ickyness i'm feeling...the tired part is all my fault...hey i HAD to watch the new real world episode last night at 11 okay...  Today was okay. After school was nice, no HOMEWORK for once! woo! and what did i do with this newly found free time?   I read. ...and attempted to sleep. and then matt called me and i had to go to panda for dinner. meh, I love my panda, but i also enjoy my sleep, so i was in a piss mood.  Cleary on day 28 of my cycle, as makenzie put it.   Today was a "hate people because of their bad qualities" day. Makenzie and I are the same person...seriously...she says she knows exactly what i mean when i say im in this kind of mood. Its like....i just get so negative that i see all the bad qualities of people and hate them. What? hormonal? noooo....not me.  I'm crazy right now.  I need some action. I've been actionless for weeks. I need some good fondling god dammit.   ...   My dads new girlfriend writes trashy romance novels for a living. Weird? cool? kind of...until i pick up her latest copy and it refers to my dad in it....yeah. likely senerio which would end with me throwing up all over the book, myself, and possibly the closest person to me at the moment (hopefully eating kid)  Volleyball tournament this weekend. Good. I need a break from school.  weeee.   You think your to cool for...school....*mumble* bleh bleh....  sleep.

      so heres the D.L. on Prom.      Where i last left you was right before matt came to pick me up for breakfast. He came around 8 and took me to his house where we made french toast. Pretty good french toast, but clearly because i helped :P hehe not really.       So i got home around 8:30 and because some people messed around with our already planned itinerary ( yes, we had a TYPED itinerary that we were supposed to follow) instead of meeting at ann morrison park at 9 i was told to show up around 10. So i sat around for awhile with nothing to do, and then went over to get staci to head to the park. After a fun hour of frisbee golf with everyone( reminder to self: talk friends into playing frisbee golf in the summer, its actually really fun) Staci and i had to head off to get our hair done. After 89 bobbypins were placed in my hair( yes, matt and i actually counted the amount of bobbypins in my hair when we took it out) I dropped staci buns off so we could do our makeup.     I put on my dress, did some "smokey eyes" makeup and waited around for matt to show up. He borrowed a mercedes for the night(!) and pulled up in that around 4. WAY excellent, man can that baby excellerate. So then we had to go to demeyer park for group pictures and parents. It was sooooo damn windy and everyone wanted to take like 4 MILLION pics...we spent way to much time there. Anyways so after that we headed for The Big Easy to take early pictures at 5. After we got everybodys pictures taken we went to  The Cottonwood Grill downtown...that is SUCH a nice resteraunt....half of our group ordered 25 dollar plates...mega expensive but excellent. I met a girl in the bathroom with my same dress, it was expected that i would see a few girls with it. Calie and I sat at dinner and whenever girls would walk by we would point out which of their dresses we tried on.      After dinner (around 7:30) we FINALLY showed up for the dance. It was awesome, especially since i wore flip flops instead of heels (so nice). I saw Genie and seifs right as i walked in the door. Genie looked soooo pretty and Ian looked great as well. The Big Easy smelled like its usual smoke alcohol and drugs but otherwise it looked good. So Matt and i danced with Genie and Ian and the rest of our group forevs which was crazy fun. Genie and Ian were hilarious to watch, and despite what genie says shes an awesome dancer. At one point in the night we joined a congaline and randomly they decided to break it off right in front of me so i had to be the front. It was fun! i barreled in and out of crazy people grinding and broke it up. they were pissed, it was excellent.    I saw makenzie and Lindsay and the other Lindsay randomly throughout the night too. LIndsay Andrysiak looked so pretty, damn her for being so pretty. Makenzie looked great as well, but Todd looked SOO cute and seeing the two of them slowdancing together put a smile on my face. Makenz refused to dance with me though because she didnt want to look stupid in front of Todd. I danced and looked stupid in front of everyone.     Best part of the night though was Seifs and Bains coming and dancing with Genie Lindsay and I. Seifs doing Genies signature move was the funniest thing I've ever seen,EVER. He's my favs. Grizz was there randomly too. Genie and I also ran into Alex and we think he was seriously drunk. He was way to happy and disoriented.     Anyways.    I won't bore you with any more petty details, the fact of the matter is I love dancing and it was a blast. I told Genie we should come back to the Big Easy on all ages nights and go dancing. She agreed that would be excellent.     After the dance Matt drove me home in the mercedes. When we rounded the corner on mcmillian i rolled down the skylight and stood up through it. It was such a rush, having the wind rushing past me in the car.     I packed my camping gear after matt dropped me off and waited for him to return for me. We rode up to the campsite with Chris and Staci. I was exhausted by this time and slept the entire way up. By the time we got up there I knew it wasn't going to be a very fun night... to be continued, i have to go make myself decent for dinner.

      So it begins.  Matts picking me up in about a half an hour to make me breakfast. and then the madness starts.   EXciteD AND streSSed!! MAHHH!!! I just hope everything turns out okay and nothing goes wrong (like..my makeup, which Genie and I are doing. Not that Genie would mess it up but me on the other hand...) and then theres always camping which I am also very skeptical about. Meh? I'm mostly just excited to get my hair done because i found the most awesome hairstyle on the internet that i really hope looks good on me. I'm excited about that and the dance the most, i can't wait to dance with my friends. eee!! excitingtastic.  I need to go paint my toenails before matt gets here, This is is my last blog until tommorow afternoon, I'll write then!

      well well.  So I got the boutanere taken care of, and my sister taught me how to do smokey eyes with makeup...so all is good i think. I still feel like i'm forgetting a ton of stuff for tommorow....this is WAY more stressful then i wanted it to be. And Matt keeps trying to steal my house key...and i swear to god if he comes in here and wakes me up really early tommorow...let's just say it won't be pretty and i'm pretty sure he won't want to go to prom with me anymore.   I've just decided that i don't want to go camping tommorow night. Its not sounding all that appealing to me right now. bah.   Why am i feeling so stressed out about prom? I don't like this. I think its partially because i'm going in such a big group...i wish i was going with makenzie and lindsay and genie. Instead i have to go with staci and watch her f-ing grind chris all night. SICK. yeah....  Anyways, makenzie and genie and i are going to go to red robin tonight to eat. delicious! and then we'll probably paint nails and such and hang out. I need to de-stress tonight.   Oh. and nate and i are just friends. for now. ... jerk.

      T-minus( ...  I feel the need to be creative right now...i need to go start an art project or something. I have this closet full of art supplies downstairs...i just never know what to DO with them. I'm having serious artist's block as of late. I kind of have an idea which i know genie will love but i'm keeping a seek for awhile.   I need to go out and have some fun...this week has been so horribly stressful. I'm in the long run until school is out... we still have like...5 weeks...oh GOD...  Makenzie and I had a good long talk tonight, and it was good. I've decided something, I care about makenzie so much, and over the years I've kind of mutated into kind of a "motherly figure" for her. Kind of...I always feel like i need to look out for her, and take care of her because she's vulnerable. I know Todd is a good guy, but if he does anything to hurt makenzie...yeah... and the fact that makenzie has been drinking occasionally with kathryn and katie has really gotten to me, because i know what alcohol can do to a person...and i'm scared to lose makenzie, she's the only person right now that i know no matter what i do she'll always be there for me and love me as much as i love her. Now i'm getting all emotional *tear*.  Anways, enough of that. I went mystic tanning yesterday, way crazy. I look like it's been about two months of summer and I've had some serious outside time. awesome! I enjoy.  Anyways, sleep? yeah.

      Tuesday oh glorious Tuesday...   what a shitty day. I guess it wasn't entirely all that horrible, just nothing good happened to balance out all the blah...ness....  I got hit on by my a substitute this morning, a "stifler/staci's boyfriend" look-a-like who told me I had an "infectious laugh" when we were in the library. He kept hoovering over me and asking me questions. creepy...he was shorter then me. and a teacher. meh, flattering none the less. I'm pathetic needing attention right now.  So I'm officially single now, if i wasn't before. I'd have to say after not having any contact whatsoever for a week with your boyfriend then you're definatly single. yep. Genie...I thought you were gonna hook me up bud... don't leave me to die in the arms of rapeface.  I went and got job applications today. woo work! woo money...the work not so much. I want to work at booster juice i've decided, it smells mega good in there and the lady said there was a good chance of ash and I getting hired because summers soon. so thats very excellent. Atleast thats out of the way.  More later? I need to go call Ben.

      hmm? oh yes its sunday.    I was crazy overexageration when i was freaking out about driving with Marika. It was harmless and she didnt even barely talk to me, she watched buffy or something on her laptop and i read and played casino on my phone for way to long. I should gamble for real someday, i kick ass at it.     I'm finally starting to get really excited about prom. Theres so many things to do this week before the dance... i need to go get a new necklace( the one i bought doesn't go with my dress...what a waste of 14 dollars. RAR!) get a "boutanere" for Matt ( i have no idea how to spell "boutanere"...lets call it "crazy flower arrangment that the boy wears on his jacket." okay.) find someone to do my makeup( I'm really bad at things concerning my face...or something) and I need to go mystic tanning with Genie (which scares me the crap out of me...what if I'm crazy orange for the dance? Orange skin and black dress? clearly i dont want to be halloween style.)    So, yes. Many many things to do. As well as things concerning prom i need to find a job (still.) and i need to put together Tim's b-day present and send it off to him before wednesday. And right now...yeah...i should be finishing my u.s. history essay on "movements, ideas, and people that shaped the 50's and 60's". MRRAAHH!! i sleep first period...how am i supposed to know these things...   Oh yeah...i just remembered the mass amounts of math i was supposed to do this weekend. right. forgot about that. hmm.    So, just because i don't want to do my essay, here's the deal with prom.  7:00AM. A WAY to early breakfast at...actually I don't know where.   - to 11:30AM. Everyone at DeMeyer park to play frisbee golf ( not entirely to excited about this idea)  12:00 PM. Staci and I will run off and Get our hair done.  4:30 PM. Everyone is due back at DeMeyer dressed and ready so parents can come and take pictures.  5:30PM. Dinner reservations. Where? I dont remember what Matt told me. This is the beauty of leaving the boys up to planning things..i dont have to know any details, i just go with the flow.  7:00 pm to 10:00pm. The dance at the Big Easy.  wee!! The part I'm most excited for...i love dancing so so much and would never get a chance to if it wasn't for dances.  10:00 -? Everyone is camping up near Lucky Peak. Staci and I ( and possibly Kaley) will be sharing a tent, and then the next morning everyone is getting up and going boating. (its WAY to cold to be boating, but whatever. I'll be fully equipped with sweatshirts and jeans...the swimsuit will be under like 5 layers of clotheing. Dammit, i just thought of something else. I need to go swimsuit shoppping this week too. To many things to do!  Anyways, thats prom in a nutshell for you. My dad said he's cool with the camping thing, which is excellent.  And Genie is coming to prom to, which way excites me, because we now have an amazing plan to get pretty face into a suductive trap. BWAHA! and we'll get to dance to "Yeah"...it will just be awesome.    hmm. should probably go to bed soon. Nate and I are "supposidly" dateing...but i seriously haven't had any contact with him since... last monday. Stupid ass, if he doesn't care enough to call me all week then i sure as hell won't care back. I was going to call him today but found myself thinking its not worth it. maybe he's not worth it. Atleast right now. Whateves...I'm sick of talking about it.  I'm off.  Sleep.

I was all excited for this volleyball tournament this weekend...and now its going th shit, because i have to ride in the car WITH FUCKING MARIKA ALONE while makenzie and ashley and allison all get to ride together. FKDSLGJFGD:STKLETHRLKGJDSTGJA:D RARRRRRRRr  Must. solve. I'm going to go call ashley and give her a piece of my mind.

      Its so easy to down a thousand peeps in one setting.  Damn you delicious little yellow baby chickens.  Today was a struggle as most days are. As I was laying the hallway today at break sandwhiched between Genie and Ashley, i realized something. Somewhere along the lines all of us girls just...stopped being friends. Fell apart. Slowly and agonizingly. Today I see it in its final state...an era has died,  A good era, an era of happiness and girls and fun...  A new era has begun, one of lies and depression and boys.  I'm just going to have to come right out and say that boys are definatly to blame for this catastrophe. I miss my friends god dammit... I miss my only source of happiness.   And this is why I sit here and eat a thousand peeps.  ... and become obese.  As sad as this is and as guilty as I feel for thinking it but i cannot WAIT until next year when everyones boyfriends are off in college(only staci and lindsays....but still, i definatly would love lindsay back.) and then things might possibly swing back into... or at least close to, normality.   Sleep.

      tonight was a pretty good night.  today was not a pretty good day.  ...as a whole. Just another tuesday. Worst day of the week, tuesday. Mondays are okay because you just got off from a weekend, you're revived and such. Wednesday is okay because you know you only have 3 school days left until the weekend. But sneaky little Tuesday...kicks you in the ass. You wake up knowing you have FOUR more days of school and pissed off because you have to do the whole school thing again after monday.   RARR ON TUESDAYS.  Atleast its over.  I need a boyfriend. or...atleast one that cares about seeing me...or talking to me...or being with me....everything Nate DOESNT care about. Nate was disgust yesterday, he came over all smelly and dirty from work. I didnt want to touch him.  I want someone to love so bad right now... *sigh*.  mahh.  I need to go on a volleyball tournament right now so I can escape this ridiculous place.

      mmmm. Love that good dose of school.  Its going to be a looooonnnggg eight weeks until school gets out. Will I last that long??! DOUBTFUL!! RARRR!! I've already began to slowly stop doing homework...and usually come to school to sleep/talk to people/space out. It was so freaking hot in school today...if there were windows in any of my classrooms i would probably have been stareing longingly outside where its all sunny and happy and not a burning sauna.   Theres a powderpuff volleyball game this week for the junior guys and senior guys. Aparently i was gone the day they annonced if any varsity girls wanted to come help out...:( so now i can't coach and have to just watch. ooooOOOooo speaking of volleyball i was talking to makenzies old coach from last year at grassroots the other night, and he's heard rumor that Larkin might not play next year!! *excited dance* So now she can stop being a damn ass coaches pet and now i can rightfully claim the spot that is mine!! I'm so giddy! Next year will kick ass for volleyball because I'll be a senior (and because larkin and kelly will be gone) and theres open room to be a captain next year. But thats about the only good thing about next years season really...because we won't have a setter...and we all know how THAT works out *glares at Glen* *glares at BRVBC*. This season has been shit. Makenzie and Ashley talk about how they don't want to play next year...and i just don't get it. They never want to go to practice either, or go on tournaments...or basically play volleyball. My question I guess is then, why do you waste your time and money to play then, if you don't love it? Hell even with my shit team this club season i still love going to practices and going on tournaments because im playing the game i love. It just baffles me i guess that they've played it so long with me and they don't share the same passion.   hmm...speaking of makenzie, she was supposed to be at my house a half an hour ago. We were going to go get slurpees and then go crash the boys volleyball practice. She's probably with Todd...:P  So we talked about marriage in health today. I completely hate that class because its solely based on common sense...i dont learn anything new. We got a worksheet where we had to check weather or not a statement could be said to be "love" or "infatuation". bah. The entire class made me think about my past relationships with people. My teacher asked the class "what is being in love?" random people raised their hands and said things like "careing more about another person more then you care about yourself" and such, and then Ian next to me says " you can't explain love, you just know what it is when it happens. And I sat there and thought about it all that period and a bit into chemistry, I do know what love is. I've felt true love. I was truely in love with ben when i was 15. I would have done anything for him, and everytime i saw him my heart would skip a beat and my face would just light up with joy.Its not a feeling i can explain. It was wonderful and i had never been so happy. And then everything started going downhill, my mom was becoming worse and worse and my dad was on the brink of divorcing her, and then ben started acting funny. Not wanting to hang out with me, not calling me...and eventually he dumped me. I've never let myself be hurt like that again. Ever. I thnk it'll be forever too before i let myself fall in love. Certainly not while i'm in high school. But i want to be in love so bad right now...Lindsay was talking to me in the car on sunday about how shes in love with ryan and she talked about all these things...and i knew what she was talking about, all the feelings she was having. Its disheartening. But none of the guys in my life right now are good canidates for "being in love" with. I think out of them I can find myself falling in love with nate the most...but that would be a horrible mistake on my part because nate has alot of growing up to do for a 20 year old.   I've babbled enough, i need to go clean my room (yeah, i haven't done that yet. Or gotten together the stuff i need to do to answer matt yes for prom. Slacker! )

      To much candy! *sick*  Today is an excellent day. *new decision* Easter is my favorite holiday. It promotes being out in the sun, light pastel happy colors, and fuzzy things like bunnies. Its like Easter kicks winter in the ass, and part of my depression. Atleast for awhile :)   weeeeeeeeeeee!.!.!  Well...the good part of easter is about to wind down, and now the bad part is about to begin. My dads "girlfriend" is coming over soon...as well as her teenage daughters. I think I'd rather puke then have to suffer that uncomfortableness. And my dads "girlfriend" dresses way cute, meaning her kids are going to dress way cute and I'm going to be trash. WOO! . I love when that happens. I'm leaving asap though...dinner starts at 5 and I'm going to say that i'm expected at genies at 5:30( which, technically, isn't a lie, because i told genie I'd be at her house around 5:30... :P ) rarrr! tonight...later tonight...is going to suck to. I need to clean my room and do massive amounts of forgotten homework.   I shouldn't have eaten so much candy. Its getting down to diet crunch time....I only have two weeks until prom. OKay.... so every diet starts tommorow i guess....

      April something or odd.  Another day, unfortunatly not another dollar. I need a job.  I usually Don't want to write about past events in my blog...i more feel like rambling nonscence usually. I bought some new pants today, but no prom dress :( I think i might want this one but its a whopping $180...I don't know if i want my greedy little self to spend that much on one freakin dress. I went dress shopping FOUR times this week. Punch me please...i hate the mall.  hmm. So you'd think that when you went in for a physical because of *depression* they'd only do things like...oh you know, check glands, draw blood and such to see if you have some sort of chemical imbalance... or something. Well my friends don't ever let them fool you like that...my doctor turned out to be a *secret* gynocologist...thats right..."So Jessica, have you ever had a pap smear?" OH MY GOD.  so. that was uncomfortable. If I ever have to put my legs into *stirrups* again when NOT placed on a horse....well....lets just say I won't. ever. again.  ONE good thing about the crazy doctor was that usually doctors scales crazy add like 10 pounds to my actual weight...and this last time mine was excitedly low. yay loseing weight! wooo.  I need to cool it with the bad self esteem. Its driving me crazy. This weekend is going to be full of homework and working on how to answer matt for prom(yeah...thats still not done)   I need summer and summer clothes and hanging out on the lake on a nice sunny day with all my friends...boating and wakeboarding a playing volleyball...those days are definatly the best I have all year...  So. Nate was supposed to come over after school today. Wonder what happened with that. Nate pisses me off...I try not to think about him anymore or I'll probably get extremly sad. I wonder why he never trys to hang out with me anymore. Can anyone say douche.  Easter is on sunday... i love easter because i love peeps, and pastel colors, and sunshine and happiness. yay!.. what i don't love about THIS easter is that my dad wants us to have dinner with this lady he's dateing. So that would be uncomfortable enough, but throw her 15 and 17 year old daughters in the mix...well...awkward. And i refuse to be there. I feel bad because i want to be there for my dad but seriously, i already hate them and i haven't even met them. Kind of weird...but i know dinner would just be awkward silence and glares and my dad saying "mmm, good dinner good dinner" for a conversation filller. Ugh. Must escape...but if i did i wouldn't be able to avoid feeling completely guilty about leaving my dad...RAWRRR...I guess i should talk to him soon about it, because otherwise i probably will just leave the house on sunday...and that would be bitch of me.  I'm going to a movie with ben tommorow. Good...bad...meh....I haven't actually *explained* to any of these guys that I'm not dateing anyone right now...I'm assuming they *know* except....i doubt matt and nate do. I feel somewhat guilty...but whatever. I'm in a whatever mood about the entire situation. I don't want to be in a "serious" relationship again for a long time...I'm sick of giving any (even an infetismal) part of my heart to any guy anymore when they all just turn out to be complete and utter jerks. SO NOW the tables turn...and I'm in control and I'm going to do whatever the hell i want with the guys in my life. Take that bitch. I'm sick of being hurt...I just can't take it anymore...  I need to go to bed. Its two am and I've been up since 6 this morning. yay...mornings...

      This thunderstorm is beyond awesome.   Ashley Makenzie and I had to run from meridian high school to makenzies car while it poured on us. We ran through puddles and splashed everywhere, laughing at each other...bliss for a few moments *sighs*  I really don't know what i need right now. I don't think i've ever felt this bad about myself in my entire life. What is makeing me go crazy? I left school today...and most people were like why did you leave...because i really didnt seem to be in that bad of a mood. Its because first and second period I couldn't focus on anything else but about how trashy i looked and how good everyone else looked. It was just like.... i never want to be seen in public again.   Thinking on it now i dread going bad to school tommorow for those same reasons.   My dad said I can get excused from school today from the doctor I'm going to see on thursday, because clearly I'm mentally unstable #$##^T#@@!!!  The rain stopped.

      mmm. to many things to do, so much time, no drive to do them.  Yeahhhhh so someone failed to explain to me that today was daylights savings time. I went to church and got there as they were closing service. hmm. embarrasing.   I need a shower. I put mayonaise in my hair yesterday so  it would be all shinetastic and pretty today, and i took a shower and now it looks rat-tastic so i'm takeing another one. Nope, you can't talk me out of it. To bad, i'm going to anyways.

      And something and whatnot.  ▐ I'm waiting for Nate to come over. He told me yesterday that he thought it was funny that I'm "playing" both him and Matt. Meh? I'm not but even if I was, nate has it coming to him.   I went dress shopping with Lindsay Andrysiak and Makenzie today. It made me like lindsay alot more, and I've decided that she actually is pretty cool. I was being all depressed and in a bad mood at the end of the day because i'm a *fat ass* and all the dresses looked like shit on me, and she reassured me that they didnt and that I wasn't trash. And she was being nice about it. hmm. strange.  I'm sitting at a desktop containing a bottle of water, an empty can of pop, a half full glass of milk, a tube if "strawberry" lipgloss, makenzies cell phone, misselaneous(?) crumbs, a few art books, a bottle of white nail polish and a notepad with the begginings of a playlist on it and random scribbles of stars. As well as other things. I need to clean. My dad gave me 200 buck a roos for dress shopping, but he's withholding a whole 100 until i clean the whole damn house this weekend.  I'm so disgusting. I dress like trash and do a great job of really working the part too. I need summer to be here so i can get my Y pass and so i have volleyball workouts at Centennial...I'm going to work out everyday for hours until I look awesome. God that'll take forever.  I freaked out today. I freaked out hard core after shopping...  PukE>    I've got a day and a reason why I should not believe in anything anymore,What's this for? My time well spent I've got all these memories that I cannot believe in  Cause I don't know where I've been all these years All these years And do you know this reason I hope that you can see it cause I will not give up  And we all know what you've done again I can see right through you You're making your way over again..again -::.The Early November.::

      I need to do something for myself. Something thats going to make me feel fulfilled...and happy. I want to get into really good shape this summer, I'd feel so much better about myself, and terribly proud.I need to start on that immediatly...i feel like i don't do enough for myself, and its really bringing me down.   When you look in the mirror, wish you were somebody else...just a perfect reflection of you and no one else...  -Guster.   I want to go wakeboarding! AHH!! I dont want to take my french and math final tommarow. oh well. Then summer! after wednesday...

      bored.  If this is to be my summer...I'd rather have school.  Something exciting needs to happen IMMEDIATLY.   I hate sitting around...even if it is to watch Sex and the City, which I've been doing all morning.   It's weird that I've gone from wanting to have alone time constantly to not being able to stand it, not even for as little time as an hour. I need to be out with people, keep things entertaining...I really want my friends back.   I finally figured out what a strap on looks like today. eww. thanks sex and the city, somethings are just best kept secret.   Hawaii countdown: 15 days.

      pissed.   My sister and I were bumming around at 10 this morning, I had just woken up and she just got back from spending the night at Jordans. Dad's girlfriend was in the driveway getting ready to go up and watch my dad race today. And then Danielle and I saw a car pull up with two guys in it, and we're like, shit, we both look horrible, we'er not answering the door. So we ran to the back of the house...haha...and then they just drove away. Stef came in and told us that a "dan and kelly"...meaning dan and kellan, showed up and that they would be back in a bit. DAMMIT!! Its now an hour later, i'm now fully dressed....and they haven't come back yet. DAN!! Genie understands.   mahhh!!!

      Lindsay came up to me and hugged me today.  She told me that everything Nick said was a lie, and that she does want us to be friends.  I feel like a giant weight has been lifted off my shoulder. Its strange but when things are okay with Lindsay and I, it just feels like...the world is okay...but if things are bad, when it rains it pours.   Today was okay. I can't believe its the end of the year already. Can't say I'll miss it though, this year sucked ass in a major way. I'm hopeing more then anything that next year all my girls and I can just have a fun year where all of us are single and hang out together all the time. No boys=no drama. Simple as that.  Maha! I have to go get my hair cut.

      I learned some good things this weekend.  I finally figured out how really obese people have sex. Quite interesting. I also figured out that younger generations are getting more and more sexually savvy. Disgusting. Thats my sister...she needs to be sheltered from these things.  I've also found out what lindsay really feels about our situtation. I was talking to her brother today, and found out that her and I are "cool" now, but that we can never be friends again. What the hell, is all i have to say. I hate this person she's become. I want the Lindsay i love back, not this selfish little bitch that decided to take over her brain. I understand that she's upset about this Ryan situation, and I feel for her, but why does she have to hate me because of it? She acts like i have no right to be upset about any of this either. Hence the selfish. I'm so beyond frustrated right now, I can't express it enough. And theres absolutely nothing i can do about it. If I talk to her about it, it's like fueling a fire...she'll just flare up and freak out at me some more. Nothing I could say would get through to her, I'd just piss her off more. Therefore, I'm stepping back and not careing until she decides to be herself again.   God. I hate boyfriends and what they do to people.

      damn is hot in my room. But the storm cloud that just passed over my house was SO COOL...a massive expance of black threatening to swallow everything up...so awesome.  I went to dinner with my moms old friend Nancy. I feel so good now, mainly because Nancy and I, though two decades apart in age, are the exact same person. She's also takeing anti-depressants, the same prescription as i am in fact, and she just...understands. It makes me so happy to connect with an older female, seeing as how i don't have a mom and such. She's invited me to go to a fashion show with her, and she said that i could come over anytime i wanted to, or call her whenever i need her.  It almost feels like having a mom again. almost. After dinner I cried in my car on the way home.  And the black storm cloud loomed behind me.  It was good to cry though....things just build up and it feels so good to just release them finally. I feel much better now thats i've done it.  I need to go think on some things.

      I was all excited just now to go to bed at 8:30...yay! lot's of sleep...  It's 9:30. bah! so tired. I need that extra hour.  I've decided ONE reason why I like unattainable guys.   1. They're unpredictable. Theres always something mysterious about them, you never know what they're thinking. Its also the whole "fun of the hunt" deal too, I'm thinking.   so theres that.  today was pretty shitty, besides that. Lindsay is mad at me again, I'd rather not even write about it. It'll just depress me more about the situation, and possibly make me ten times more mad.  yes TEN times RARRRR  aslfkjdslkajgklj!!! kl.jsdgklh;drkgljgkljdgkl;hklgjdkgljdfd

      I felt like laughing at my dad, when he said he thinks I have a problem, and that I'm takeing the easy way out. It made me uneasy, to think I would laugh at such a thing.  maniacal laughter.  So, today. Feeling better about myself, randomly. Much better. Everyone else around me? falling apart. It's terribly tragic that right when i'm feeling good everyone else needs to feel down. Tragic, yet expected.  Things are okay(?) rar?  tommorow i find out for sure if I'm going to Hawaii this summer. I want to be happy, but that fact that my dad's fake ass girlfriend and her equally fake daughters need to come with us somewhat puts a damper on my vision of paradise.  Convo.  Dad- I just want to know if you're okay with us going to Hawaii with Stef and her kids, It'll be uncomfortable, but I want you and danielle and I to go somewhere together.  Me- Okay, so when do we need Stef and her kids to hang out as a family? If this is uncomfortable for you too, why invite them?  Dad- *mumbles* *walks out of room*  You know, when I grow up I want atleast 3 kids. I want them all to grow up being friends with each other, a tight knit family that drives each other crazy but all love each other so much, because we'll all know everything about one other. I feel deprived of family, I would never do that to someone else, least of all my kids. They'll have a loveing mother who cares to ask how her kids day at school went, and what happened with that girl they liked, and what they got on their math test.  ...I hate not having a family.  good mood just went down a notch.

      I could have kissed him, you know. The atmosphere was perfect, the sun fading to my left, his hand on my arm to the right. His eyes stared straight into me, and i knew what he wanted. I could have done it, right there.  ...  But I'm sick of regrets. I walk a thin wire right now, and if i don't make some desicions soon, that wire is going to break and snap me in the face. Its a metal wire too. Thats going to hurt like a bitch.   why is it true that girls always like the "bad boys"? the ones they can't have...why do we crave the unabtainable? I've been exploring this mystery for some time now and its driving me stark raving mad. Mad i tell you.  ...  I saw Dan today at the pita pit while Genie and I were dancing around downtown. God he's gorgeous, I've thought so for years. One small problem though, yeah. His girlfriend of 4 years.  My plan? Corruption corruption sudduction. Wanting the unobtainable, craving it.  I've gotten over that, but all the same. That crazy craving. Ridiculous. Even though I should be hateing on Nate right now, i wish he would just fucking give me a call.  ...Jeez.

I went to the mall the other day and it was swarming with them. Is it like...some kind of protest against old people diabetes or some jazz?  And hey, no one has given me good slut names yet for my car. Comon people, i know you have it in you. somewhere...

      MAAHH!!      Genies Birthday party was way fun. Her friend Zach is hilarious, so so much with Mike because he was being all quiet and such. The only part that really sucked about the night was everybody telling Staci to shut the fuck up. repeatidly. Hey, Its understandable, but i still felt a little bad. But only a little.     I feel left behind a bit, because last night Genie Zach and Kenzie all got together and got drunk. Genie told me about all the fun they had and i feel stupid because I've never been drunk before, and i wish they would have called me.  Peer pressure? woo!  I jumped off a bridge the other day cause there was a bunch of other people doing it too.  So anyways.  I'm going to start playing my guitar again. I can't even play mary had a little lamb anymore.  ...  hmm. this summer is going to be interesting. I predict a bunch of drama. Why? just cause...I feel it.  like the girl on "mean girls" i can predict the weather with my boobs.  There is a 30% chance that the sun will go down today.

So today is Genies birthday party...I can't wait, mainly because school is becomeing a booming stress metropolis and this weekend will be a good getaway.   I need to get ready for school.

      alright.  So contrary to POPULAR belief, I'm not looking for some quick-fix sympathy, or attention. As stated in previous blogs, I DO have alot of self esteem issues, and my blog, for me, is a place where I write my feelings at the time i feel them. I'm not looking for you to say " Oh no Jessica, don't say that, you're beautiful, blah blah..." I write how I feel and I won't apologize for it. Yes I have some issues, with good reason assholes, clearly no one knows what I've been through in my life, and the few that do, I would have thought They'd understand a little more when someones self esteem crumbles temporarily.  And does no one think I've TRIED to feel better about myself? Does anyone really think i like being this way? Fuck that, I'd give anything to be happy again.  GOD, I'm so fucking pissed, can you tell?  And for the record, I am happy now, but everyone gets a little down sometimes, so get off my back.  *fumes*   I need to go calm down.

I feel like the uglyiest person alive right now.  ...  UGH!! I HATE THIS!!   I'm reading  The Handmaid's Tale  and came across this excerpt.    Falling in love, I said. It was, on the contrary, heavy going. It was the central thing; it was the way you understood yourself; if it never happened to you, not ever, you would be like a mutant, a creature from outer space. Everyone knew that.     Falling in love, we said; I fell for him. We were falling women. We believed in it, this downward motion: so lovely, like flying, and yet at the same time so dire, so extreme, so unlikely...   I wish i was in love...

      two words m'friends.   New car!!!!   My dad *randomly* surprised me today with a shiny new 2000 tracker. Sounds dumb, yes, but i have a fetish for trackers. I'm crazy! and its SUCH and improvement from my stupid 89 pontiac grand prix. But you know whats strange though? in some small way i miss that piece of shit...   I think I'll get over it though. I won't forget the memories Leonard(my old cars name)*sniff*  My shiny pretty red tracker now needs fitting name. I think...red is like...the color of sluts, my car is a slut, and therefore needs a slutty name. any suggestions?  Happy Birthday Genie! This was an awesome day.

      I actually hung out with lindsay today.  It felt soooo good to finally talk to her again, it made me realize how much better i feel about myself when im with lindsay. Its kind of like getting a piece of myself back. Thats the only way i know how to explain it really.   That just brightened my whole day.  This weekend has been pretty good, played my last volleyball game(well, real volleyball game) for the next three months. Damn i'm going to miss it. The good thing is though that wakeboarding will soon replace that empty space...weeeee!! I'm so excited for it, you have no IDEA!!  woo.  Today is now all about "spring cleaning". Ugh. But if I clean my room and my side of the bathroom i get 200 bucks...so i'm thinking its worth my while.   Nate emailed me after not talking to him for two weeks. He says hes seeing a phsychologist now...so thats good. He needs to work out some issues. He also says that he'd love to hang out with me soon. *pout* not allowed to miss nate....  anyways, god summer needs to be here. LIndsay and I were talking about it this morning, how much better its going to be with all us girls, after her and ryan break up and we can all be single (well, except kenzie) but yeah...god i need it.   I played frisbee golf yesterday with John NIck and  Ben. It was fun, I'll have to remember that for summer as well.  I need to go clean. My wallet is collecting cobwebs right now...

      Jealousy? I think not.    Aproximatly three minutes ago I was informed by Matt( the guy who *thinks* him and I are dateing) that he was apparently asked by three girls today to Morp. He told me that, i said thats cool, and then there was silence. What did he want me to do? freak out and tell him he couldn't possibly say yes, because he HAS to come with me because im clearly in love with him.    See, I'm such a total bitch, why can't he see that im not interested in him?    Maybe everyone is right, maybe i do lead boys on...not nessacarily with the intent of hurting them, but because by having guys like me it boasts my self esteem.And trust me, its self esteem that I'm in dire need of at the moment.  That and i don't want to be the one to hurt them. That sounds like a bunch of bull shit but i find it only to be truth.  I guess I do lead guys on. MAAHH! I'm a horrible person, but i guess I'm only searching for happiness, or something.      I think part of it also is that 3 of the 4 guys "pursueing" me at the moment are x-boyfriends...and i think a reason i won't let them go so easily, because I remember what we had and such, but at the same time i can't make a choice between any of them because, again, I'm afraid of hurting people.     I'm thinking i need a new boy...yes! A new boy it is.    Stupid Nilla wafers, so damn delicious and irresistable...     speaking of nilla wafers, Chris finally broke up with Staci today. A tragedy we all saw coming, but now that its here not only is staci heartbroken but in a small way i am too, because i know exactly how she feels. I've tried to explain this to our other friends so they might possibly show her some compassion (though mostly everyone hates her at this point...for many reasons) they refuse to, makenzie even said that Staci has it coming to her.    True, she did ditch us all the time for Chris, and used us for rides to get Chris presents, and basically treated us like shit...I still feel for her, we've now been in the same boat. Meh? meh.   I need summer terribly, but i'm also afraid its going to be a bore fest. That and I'm not going to have any money because i have *yet* to find a job.    I sound like a snob in this blog.  please ignore my randoms.  Stressed! school is crazy.  I want to go swimming, i'm going to force Mark to allow me to swim in his pool. and i'm going to force him to let Genie come to. mahha!  I have to go work on my us history papes.

      I learned something new and vital this weekend.  I'm NOT allowed ever to go without my medication again. ever. again.   I really didnt think it was doing that much to help my depression until i didnt take it two days in a row. Yesterday during volleyball I was frustrated and pissed and freaking out. I started crying and couldn't, literally, stop. After our game my coach told me to go up to the bleachers and do whatever it takes to calm me down. As I sat in those bleachers with my sweatshirt hood over my head, my  watch me dissapear mix playing in my ears, I stared at my teamates reffing down below and tried to take deep breaths to stop crying. After a few deep breaths i was still tearing up and sobbing...and i started to get scared because i couldn't stop myself. I didnt really even know WHY i was crying, really.  so to avoid being scared like that again, i will take my medication everyday from now on. We'll be joined at the hip, that bottle of pills and I.   Oh? the volleyball you ask?  Im so fucking happy this season is over.   I've never played with a worse team in my entire life.  And so its over. and now i don't care anymore.  I really wish i would have taken my damn pills on the trip, I'm all pissy today and have been sitting around trying to get a tan. Matt came over and I was super annoyed with him so i sent him home and told him I was in a bad mood and thats why i didnt want to hang out. which i was.  This weekend I have also come to the realization that I am lonely once again. Weeee!! So much for likeing being single, that lasted a whole 3 weeks. *sigh*    I tried to go to church today to hang out with Lindsay to find out that her and her family left this weekend for a little mini-trip. Why am I so completely out of the loop with lindsay these days? Good lord, i had no idea she was leaving.   JOB! if i dont have a job this summer i will drive myself to complete and utter madness from being so bored. bored bored bored bored booooooreeeddd.   I've decided that i like truck stops. They're funny little things, complete little worlds inside one small building. Tiny deoderants, keychains, toothbrushes and books. Food, jewelry...everything you need in life, its all there. I saw a magnet yesterday in a truckstop in Jerome Idaho that said "My cousin went to Texas and all they got me was this lousy magnet" WTF??!?! last time i checked...we live in idaho...but okay. But i told makenzie we're going on a road trip, and on that road trip we are visiting many many truck stops. because i like them.  i had a nightmare the other night in my hotel room. Iraq came over to america and started bombing everything and takeing prisioners and stuff, it was utter chaos and i was trying to escape with my life as well and genies and ashleys. weird, and it scared me too. But we escaped alive, and then my nightmare turned into a stupid dream about how i left my cell phone at some school and i made matt go and get it for me...and some other jazz.  My dad told me we're going to Hawaii this summer. !! delicious, i love hawaii. Except...we might be going with his girlfriend...and her kids.  not nearly as appealing.  ...  but its still Hawaii, and my sister and i have decided to run away when we get there.  I have things to do! must be off.

      I want out of this cage. In this cage i'm secure, i know im safe...only physically though. Everything else that has happened in my life, all the hurt, all the pain, all the people...they're trapped too. Trapped in here with me where i must rexperience them each day. I need out. I need to spread my wings and become someone else. I can't take my world any longer. I wan't to say that someone needs to save me...but only I can this time.

      with all that is sweet must come something sour.   Dan and I just got done with our "chat". our 2 1/2 hour chat. I found out wonderful things that brought my ego sky high, and things that made it plummet beneath the earth.   Well, for the good news. Dan had asked me what was up with Tim and I. I told him nothing more then had been in the past. He then decided to go and tell me that i'm the perfect girl. I couldn't believe those words came out of his mouth. This sounds so egotistical but i had to know exactly why he found me the visible and mental personification of perfect. He said four things: I'm pretty, I like video games, I'm easy going, and that I don't put up with drama. And apparently to Dan, those are the ingrediants for the perfect girl. This is where it got the best. He told me that Kellan and him had been talking and had decided that if kellan wasn't so short and that if Dan wasn't dateing Steffanie they'd both be going after me. I haven't felt that giddy and light hearted in...god, forever. Its that feeling when you were in middle school and you idolized this boy from afar and thought he didn't even know you existed, and then one day you caught his eye from across the room and he smiles at you. But of cource this news is bitter sweet due to the fact that dan WON'T be breaking up with Steffanie...ever...they've been going out for 5 years now. And I, well, don't have enough power of suduction to bring him to me. So it's nice to know he wants me, but, thats about all the pleasure i can get out of that.  And, of cource, during our conversation nate had to come into play. I haven't talked to him in a good month or so. Here's the news that made my heart sink like a rock.  He's dateing a girl at Drop Em Dead...alright...i guess i can handle that...i mean she's probably prettier then me and all....NO. NO not at freaking all. Dan likened her to his girlfriend, who isn't the skinnest person in the whole world, and he said that she's FATTER then stef is. God...and on top of that she's older then nate and has a strong tendency to drink alot.   hmm. There goes my self esteem again. Whatever little bit i gained earlier in the conversation went out the window. Am i that horrible? God...why would he choose her over me...  I'm done. I've had enough. I am numb to emotions dealing with boys. I will never fall in love again.  ...  Jesus.

      Does anyone wonder where coins have been?  I was sitting in panda yesterday with Staci. We were pondering this nasty dime that the guy at the cash register had given me. It looked like someone had viciously bitten in a million times. The edges weren't serated anymore as much as they were burnt slightly brown. While staci babbled about how i shouldn't keep the dime because it could infect my other change i wondered, what the hell has this dime been through? What has it seen...  Fascinateing.  Me? Drunk.  I haven't been able to sleep in all these days i've been back. I think i'm still on Hawaii time, i don't get tired until atleast 2 am because back in hawaii we went to bed around 10. So. its just messed up. I. Tired.  DAn called me the other day. Yeah. Dan. hmm. He tells me he wants to "talk about some things with me" I asked him whats up and he says "well, you know, just wanted to catch up with you, spread shit about people, stuff like that." Weird. I don't like this. Not at all. Though i have secretly been jonesing on this Dan kid for years, I also am not blind to the fact that hes a manipulative son of a bitch. So this convo we're going to be having on Friday should prove to be quite interesting. Quite interesting indeed...  I hung out with Mark, Staci, Chris, Travis, Robbie and Megan last night. It was so fun...I miss having alot of friends. I wish i was a permenant member of their posse, I'm more just a "show up sometimes and chill with everyone" person. Meh. Whateves. But anyways Mark and I did alot of talking and we've decided to go float the river next Tuesday. Tres Excellent....last year was so fun. But this year will be all the more interesting because Tim, nate and i will all be there. Will it be weird? Uncomfortable? All he freaking above...but sadly I only find it to be amusing and interesting...and i can't wait to do it. I want to see how it all plays out, if tim will really kick nates ass, if nate will completely ignore me, or if he'll get jealous that im hanging out with Tim now... Am I a bad person? probs. But i love a good dose of drama every once in awhile.   Anyways. I need to go get ready for things. MA HA!

      Yes, my friends. The rumors you've heard around town are true. I AM BACK...on the mike again...from Hawaii.   Hawaii, no matter what kind of company you are in, is brilliant. I got so used to living on the beach and eating out every meal that it began to feel like it WAS my life, and that i had never had another. My real life seemed so far away and in the past...bloody brilliant. I am fully revived! I feel good, lets see how long it can last :)   More on these matters later friends, I have things to do and people to see.

I want to go on the trip...don't get me wrong, its just in some ways i just want to chill around here and hang out with Genie.  I'll miss her, we've been crazy joined at the hip lately. It'll be like missing a leg, or something.   Anyways, more later i need to go get ready for church. blahh. and make a packing list, because i don't know what to pack.   oh yeah, and why didn't anyone tell me i needed a calculator at the ACT's? RARRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!

      So this morning I was getting ready to go out. I began to brush my teeth while laying on my bed in my cave like room and thought about how ridiculous getting ready for the day is. If I take a shower, straighten and blowdry my hair, put on makeup it takes me a good hour - hour and a half to get ready every day. to what purpose? Mahh...and then i started to think about little house on the prarie...haha...but seriously. I bet people were so much happier back then, even if their lives did consist of wakeing up everyday and working their butts off. But atleast they felt fullfilled, and had good self esteem. Also though, family relationships were the most important relationships to have back then. Now take all those things, and look at my life. I don't have a job, the most "working" I do is at the gym, i have bad self esteem, and i have little to no family relationships. atleast not good ones. Hmm.  Pointless life, perhaps? Oh well.  Hawaii-3 days  A.C.T's- tommarow (disgusting, i dont want to do them)  off to see the millionth movie i've seen this week.

      This is turning out to be the makeings of the best summer ever.   I'm leaving for Hawaii in four days. I'm swimming with dolphins while i'm there, which has been my dream since i was like 3. Genie and I talked to her parents last night and we're going to disneyland! most likely...but that would be beyond fun if Genie and I got to roam around disneyland together (and possibly with peanut, if we play our cards right). And then later this summer Ash and I are going on a  crazy back to school shopping spree in Seattle. I *might* be going to warm lake again (which i must say, was the funnest thing ever last year)I guess it all just depends on how much lindsay and I can repair our friendship by then. I talked to her yesterday and everythings alright with us...so I'm feeling optimistic.   yay! I get to play actual volleyball today, which is excellent. I feel really good right now.

      dude. Feeling good.  Today I've eaten only a bowl of smart start cereal for breakfast, then an apple before volleyball, and then some pasta salad and some radishes for lunch. And I rode the bike at the Y this morning and went to weight training volleyball style...I feel so crazy healthy right now. I like this feeling, alot better then eating trash food and sitting on my ass...so I definatly think I'm going to keep this up.

      Just got back from planning Hawaii trip with Dad's girlfriend and her daughters. The trip seems surreal right now... we've planning parasailing, surfing, snorkeling, swimming with dolphins, a dinner whale watch cruise and riding a helicopter around the Island. Holy. Shit. Coolest vacation ever...and i think i'm begginning to actually like Stefs daughters...they're actually really nice and pretty funny.  So...thats all good.   whats not all good...is I that I wrote Lindsay an email saying I've been trying to get ahold of her foreves and haven't been able to and that she should call me/write me soon....and I have yet to recieve a phone call and/or email. Man.  *hums* Istambul the city of dreams...*hums*

      Am I doomed to spend my summer like this? Lagging around the house, occasionally turning on the t.v., getting bored of it, checking my email (with high hopes, to almost always be shot down) and then sulking around wondering why no one ever calls me? During the school year if I ever got bored after school I could just take a nap...but now that summer is around and I'm getting plenty of sleep everynight I can't take naps anymore because I'm not tired. So in a way its like I'm trapped in boredom hell.  I'm thinking I've become a staci...no one wants to hang out with me anymore. I called Ashley yesterday and she told me I could come along with her today to the job offices to find a damn job...and she said she would call me. She didnt call all day, so i finally decided just a few minutes ago to call her to see if we were still going. First thing i ask her is "whats up?" and she said" filling out a job application."  ...  She went without me. What the fuck? God...if you don't want me to come, don't fucking invite me. Christ. I'm so sick of people. Apparently they're sick of me too.

      At the moment im in the middle of three books; Bridget Jones's Diary, Temple of the Winds, and White Oleander. From reading Bridget Jones I've decided to keep a daily journal like she does, though it won't be going on the internet because it's going to be quite a bit more personal. It's nothing new anyways...before this blogger thing I've kept written journals since I was 12. It's fun to read them occasionally...interesting to read about how opinions form and change over the years as you get older.    I remember my first kiss. Jon attacked me in Lindsay's downstairs hallway. I was moving in to give him a kiss on the cheek( because he had been bothering me about giving him a kiss all day) and then at the last moment he turned around and kissed me. I went home feeling like my innocence had been stolen from me...I think back on that now and laugh. Geez. Every last shred of my innocence has been stolen now.  tim wants me to go swimming with him and a bunch of people right now, but i'm feeling somewhat insocial and he just made a big freaking deal of it.   summer must: popsicles. Need to go get some so they're on hand.  It was freaking hot today. blah. I hate being really hot almost as much as i hate being mega cold.  hawaii-11 days.  Going to the gym tommorow, excellent. I've felt like a slug these past couple of volleyball-less weeks.

I really want to reconnect with lindsay and makenzie, I need to get on that soon...very soon. I also need to go up to the lake immedes.  My dad and I talked about how my sister is a bitch last night. Hilarious...I'm glad that he agrees with me.  hey...I had a 75% in my math class...I got a 100% on my final...and now i have an 80% !!!!!!!!!! WWOOOOO FOR B's! I was crazy excited when i found out.

      nothing to report. nothing. at. all.  I haven't done anything. I sat in my backyard and tried to tan my swimsuit lines, and then i got creeped out because i was topless and my grandma was talking about boys looking over the fence when i went to her house yesterday.  I then came inside and ate an ice cream cone. I then ate another.&nbsp; Then I realized that today is the most hellish boreing day ever. And here I am now. Waiting for a call, somebody to drop by.&nbsp; I almost invite school to begin, just to give me something different to hate.   Today is hot. I'm playing sand volleyball later. It will be hot. I'm talking about weather. I'm bored, and boring.   Its hard to be depressed in the summer. In the winter though you can listen to your sad music, bundle in a blanket and stare into the white void and cry.&nbsp; I went and saw this movie the other day, What the Fuck Do We Know?, it was about quantum physics and such. It sounds hells boring, yes i know, but I actually understood alot of what they were saying. Human emotions can be tamed, turned on and off according to the person. People wouldn't feel such strong emotions unless they were addicted to the way the emotions make them feel. For instance, depressed people don't have to remain depressed but they're so addicted to the feeling that they continue to be negative.  &nbsp;Tres interessante, mes amis.   My dad and Stef are taking a "break"...my dad isn't feeling her as much as she's feeling him...she's talked&nbsp; about the future and marraige and such. I wish my dad would just marry her, I think we'd all be alot happier. I like stef, i like her daughters. It'd be like having an actual family again instead of my pseudo-family that I have now. And Stef cooks...how i would LOVE to have home cooked meals again.  ...I hate guys. rar.

      alright. Woke up this morning but i didn't go to bed, i was watching the whites of my eyes turn red...Now that I'm back from disneyland, now that the adventure is over, i find myself in a terrible rut. I have NOTHING to do today, tommorow...well, nothing of interest or excitement anyways. I have to go buy a new bra because mine convieniently broke itself at disneyland, and I need to go pick up my retainers. Wooo, sounds like a fun day and a half.   One of my fav moments at Disneyland.   Picture this. Standing in line for Indiana Jones on a Saturday night. Genie, myself, and her parents are standing behind this group of 12 year old boys who think they're the shit. You know, punching each other and saying "fuck" a million times. The following ensued.  *boys start punching each other* *one hits me in the arm* Genie: "Dude, calm down, okay? stop freaking out, we're trying to have a good time here" Stupid backwards hat kid: *stares and gets afraid*  Genie is way up in the kids face at this point. They stared each other down for a minute and then the kid weasels his way through his little group of friends to be protected at the front. HAHHA...oh man.   I need to go get pictures developed as well. Right now my future day looks meek...god i need to find something to do.

      Despite being in the car for the past 14 hours, I feel strangly refreshed. This vacation was so needed for me, I needed to get away, to have fun, to not worry about things like TIM and NATE and SCHOOL...all i had to worry about was fighting off all the hot guys working at Disneyland. :)   ...but seriously, there were hot guys.   &nbsp; I had such an amazing fun time at Disneyland with Genie. God how can you not have fun being at the happiest&nbsp;place on earth with your best friend? We were pirates and princesses and absolutly out of our minds drunk and we had so much fun. Atleast I did. God I wish disneyland was closer. We made so many awesome new guy friends like Steven the pirate and Ryan the underground recluse and Kerry, Genies waiter/lover.   wonderful.  More later I need to go run around and stretch my legs,&nbsp; they're about to fall off.  &nbsp;

      Today is a full blown "reorganize my life" day. I'm cleaning out my entire room, top to bottom, left to right, upside down and all around. I hate these days but at the same time love them, I feel like im accomplishing things, and my room is nice and pretty when im done. woo!.  speaking of getting things done, I still haven't talked to tim yet. Today is the day. Nate is an ass, again. he was supposed to call me yesterday. He called me in the morning, said we couldn't hang out until later because he had to go paint the stage at knock em dead, so he said he'd call me when he was done. Who didn't ever recieve a phone call? thats right, Jessica didn't. grr. this only furthers my decision to swear off boys for the remainder of high school.  I want volleyball....and disneyland. DISNEYLAND! I'm so terribly excited. Lets go now. I need a little small world to brighten me up a bit.   "what are you going to do today Napolean?"   "whatever i feel like doing...God."  Best. Movie. Ever.

      I don't want today to happen.  Today i'm dropping the bomb on Tim. I don't want to date him. We can't be anything but friends. I can't continue hurting him like i do.  when nate came over the other night we went on a really long walk around my neighborhood. He talked about his girlfriend, how it wasn't going anywhere, about us and how messed up it is that he would throw us away, and he talked about how depressed he is with his life. At the end of the night while we were sitting on my porch he said, "why do you have to be so beautiful?" and then he kissed me.   ...  Tim found out. Nate told Dan, dan told steffanie, steffanie told Tim. Tim freaked out a couple of nights ago when i was spending the night at Genies. It was nearly 2 in the morning when he called me crying and freaking out. bahhhh.  I need to talk to him. Now. He thinks we're going out. We're not. I need this to be done. I refuse to date in high school any longer. Its a waste of my emotions and time.   BAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!

Nate is coming over to give me my sunglasses and talk to me, and tim is pissed off and upset. GET OVER IT. JESUS.  Have sworn off boys.   NOw i'm so not in the mood to hang out with nate, i would much rather curl up in my new hot pink chair and watch sex and the city.   I need money.

      Raceing horses man... I just came back from the race tracks with my fam. My uncle owns/races a horse and so of cource everyone bet on him, except for me. I went with my gut instinct and had my dad race on #4, a beautiful pepper horse that looked really spirted. I won! 30 bucks...haha! GOd my gambling obsession is going to be bad when im older.  Good times this weekend hanging out with my extended family. I usually hate little kids as you all know but i'm loving the time i'm getting with my 14(!!) younger cousins this weekend.   Disneyland looms around the corner...DISNEYLAND!! happiest place on earth, the place where genie and I are going to dress like whores and make mickey be a gansta. Hells fun.   I have a black eye too. woo! good stuff.  I'm off to a BBQ at my aunt doris's house.

       The wind tickled her nose as she stared into the horizon. She smiled, wishing this moment would last forever....when the world was gone...     Where the hell is my family. It freaks me out, i'm never home around 12 so this is new to me.  I keep thinking i hear my cell phone in the other room to find out that its all in my head. I think i'm going crazy, i'm hearing things. And i'm still creeped out about or phone cord getting cut...thats just messed up.   I want to go to college. I want away!!!!! AWAY DAMMIT. I don't want to go to high school anymore. Bah. I have registration in two days.  I need to make a new life.  Jon called me ugly tonight.  *sigh*. whatevs. Its not like i have good self esteem to ruin anyways.   But back to this college thing. I was hanging out with Staci and Ashley the other day and we got to talking about if we all went to the University of Washington. We could all get an apartment together and decorate it...we could have cats and live near Seattle where we could flea market shop and play at the aquarium. God that sounds like the life right now...i'd give anything to be in that fantasy.  my life seems so worthless right now. I'm just...bored. Things will pick up i expect when volleyball starts up.  The only thing good about this summer was Genie...without her i would have had absolutly no fun at all. I heart Genie.

      now that things are starting to get better for Genie, I, of cource, must start feeling bad about things.  I guess the best way to sum everything up is in these lonely words.  I'm tired.   I'm tired of juggling people around. I'm tired of worrying about hurting anothers feelings by talking to someone else and i'm tired of walking on egg shells to make sure someone is not mad at me. I'm tired of having to fight for someones attention and getting to much attention from someone i don't want that much from.  I feel like everytime i turn around my life does a 180 on me. I've never had a stable life, a stable home, stable friends. My friends slip through my fingers like sand...it's so much work for me to pick them back up if they won't help me. I've tried for so long to keep all that stable, and, I'm tired.  I've never had a stable home. In the past five years i've lived in 5 different houses. The first home i miss. The second one my mom was drunk all the time, tried to commit suicide, and she was embarrassing. I hated that home. The third one my mom reclused to her room all the time, i had a stupid dog named Jerry who never got house trained, and it was the house where i saw my mom for the last time. The fourth was my dads rental house. It had amber in it, who eventually stole many of my things. The fifth one is where i am now, and i hate this house. its to manly, its to much my dad, and it doesn't feel like home.  along with all these different houses came so many different feelings and different friends. I'm sick of change. I just want to be stable.  I'm tired.  I want school to just start, then end, so i can get away from this place. I need to go start my own life, with my own rules. I want to be able to mold it the way i want it. God i need that so bad.
