      Well, I went to a meeting of a local mountain club. They were having a sale/swap of used outdoor equipment - skiis, packs, boots, etc.  I honed in on a nice-looking (like new) backpack, internal frame, Kelty, so even I knew that it was top of the line. I picked it up, started asking questions of the guy who was selling it, because the price tag was $35! As I was leaning the pack onto the table, a girl moves in a little too close for my comfort, says  she  was looking at it (to purchase). She looked kind of tough, and I could see the fact that she now had competition for the bag had her up in arms. She asked me if I had any backpacking experience (is that a prerequisite for buying a used backpack?), so I told her a short story of my first experience 20 years ago. She brags to no one in particular that she just got back from Sri Lanka or something. She was quite interesting looking with piercings and tatoos.  Piercings and stuff don't bother me; however, I think they're somewhat distracting when they're in the middle of your face. Anyway, she says, "I'll fight you for it!" (Yeah, right; sorry, but I left my brass knuckles at home.) Well, folks, I had no cash on me, so what it came down to was the fact that she had a wallet of green stuff and the guy sold it to her for $ 25 !!  About 5 minutes later I saw her on her cell phone, probably gloating over her good deal and for scaring me off.  I was so mad after I left, over this deal that got away.  However, the next day I found a brand new backpack on sale at Gander Mtn for $25.99!  So there!

      This Waterman guy that I'm reading about right now apparently hiked to the top of a mountain in New Hampshire, a mountain he had climbed many times with great enjoyment, to sit down and die. This was in the year 2000. He went up in February with minimal clothing on and little or no food with the intention of not returning. He pinned a note to his jacket asking that no one bother trying to revive him. Four of his old climbing buddies hiked up the mountain to bring his body back down.  If you think his death is sad, wait until you read about the rest of his life, and the lives of his sons, two of whom also died, one in a climbing related incident in Alaska.

      Working Daze, because I'm in one when I get to work and start digging through the mountain of paper on my desk. I'd rather be hiking...Let's talk about plans for going to the Adirondacks, or hiking the AT, or whatever other outdoor activity that sounds good to you. I want to read something about the outdoors and feel like I'm there instead of inside these four walls at work.

      August 6-8, 2004. If you haven't caved before but always wished you had, get started now! Stop wasting time! There's stuff you need to get, and you need to find yourself a grotto to join where you can get all the information on it. I joined the Niagara Frontier Grotto and they turned out to be a fun bunch of people, very close group, I must say, and very open to new members. Went on my first trip on August 6 to Scoharie, NY, where there are several caves owned by the NSS apparently. I can't wait until my photos are developed so I can post one here! I had a great time squeezing into lots of tiny cracks in the walls and seeing how far I could go. Got extremely muddy and sometimes wet, bumped, bruised, etc. but otherwise not hurt. Didn't see any bats this time, but maybe next time. Met a lot of really cool people who are so into caving it's not even funny. And the partying wasn't bad either. Maybe I'll publish the trip report that I wrote for the grotto newsletter....stay tuned.
