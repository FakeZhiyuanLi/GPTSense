         "What a Terrible Weave we Web"      So most of you all probably about this psycho girl that keeps harassing me and how I got to the point and told her to fuck off. Well I found out lastnight that about 90% of anything she ever said was a lie. With the help of a friend she has been pulling Re-Con and we are finding out some interesting information. So just outta temptation I had to IM her and be like your full of shit peace out I have proof now. So now she has been blowing up my phone and its only 7:20am. I didn't answer it since I just wanted to leave it at that. But its crazy how you know people through other people and some people don't know you know those people and so on and so forth. God I know way to many people here. Gimme a couple million so I can get me and my boys outta here to the west coast to live it up with some stars. I wonder what the day has in store for me today? Hopefully my tires are left alone. Good thing I work far away. Well peace out until tomorrow

         "A New Month"        So we start off the month of August with a Code Orange saying these Terrorist bastards are going to attack a finanical institution. Well guess what I work for one now I am no longer at Eastern Motors where your job is your credit. anyways I was sitting thinking these idiots could bomb my building since I am close to DC now but it probably won't happen. I am going to try and keep this updated daily from now on since this is my rebirth. Generation Y baby is coming to life believe that and I will have my entourage with me for the ride.!!!

        The Dream Continues   I woke up this morning to the same dream I have had for the past 10 day's, The world is in ruin's and I am leading a squad of 10 men to gates of the last standing city, As we approach the gates we are attacked by Men in black robe's but there are no gun's we only have swords, a battle pursue's and my second in command gets stabbed protecting me. I think proceed to cut the man that attacked my second in command in half, we get closer and closer to the gate and when I reach the gate I wake up but last night was different. We make it through the gate and enter the city, the city is gold and people come to greet us but as the people approach I get a feeling that looks are decieving so we draw are swords and the peacefull people change into what they truly are, Black robed men begin to appear and a second squad comes through the gates. We begin to battle again. I get sliced and then I woke up. Now this dream is really wierd because I keep having it over and over again. I have never had anything like this happen to me before. Just think your dreams have meaning and I am not sure what these mean. According to the bible code a comet is supposed to hit planet earth and cause total destruction in the year 2012. Wierd huh? Maybe I am just dreaming up that sitituation.
