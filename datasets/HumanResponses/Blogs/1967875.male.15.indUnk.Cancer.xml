      Hey everyone!!!  Day 2 of my new and improved blog!  anywho...later today (tonight) I am going to spend the night over at reds. today though while i was there for a while, john came over to get a game he had forgotten, and he stayed long enough to play a match of Super Smash Bros. Melee, and i must say, i personally think my skills have improved, but if i talk anymore about the game, i would be "pulling a levy" so, anyway john was yelling at us by the time it was over, and red, he had actually begun to sweat. but yeah, Melee remains one of my favorite games ever! Cameron's party is in a couple of days and i am looking forward to that. but yeah, nothing else is really happining today...i will post again later if something interesting occurs.  I now bid you adeui!

I was like that was the entire purpose of getting one!!!! ARRRGGG!! so instead i went to EB Games and i got Metroid: Zero Mission, and it was sooo friggen easy!!! omg! i beat it the next morning. what a waste actually, I am still gonna keep it cause i love metroid games, and i unlocked the origional one. (from the NES) but whatever...that was my little thing for now...anywho...  aduei  (note)  Ryan Redmond's blog no longer exists. (note missing link)

      Well, yesterday my mom cashed my check, and i got the 30$, so i went with Red to EBgames, and i purchased Mario Kart: Double Dash, and a Broad Band Adapter, hehehehe...i thought you could play DD online, but it turns out the adapter is used only for LANing grrrrrr i hope some of my friends get a broadband adapter so we can LAN. although...red said he would get one for X-Mas...but in the meantime, DD is one of the best multiplayer games for the GameCube, and if you like racing games, i would advize (sp?) getting it. in the meantime though...   6 more days untill my B-Day!!!   adieu

Then, on Sunday, it was Cameron's 4th of July/ B-Day party all-in-one! So I spent the night at Cameron's and John, Red, and Peter were there, we stayed up really late playing a CTF on Halo, then we watched Orange County, and finnaly we talked untill we dropped. Then, yesterday, I went over to Rachel's to return the Garage door opener i used to get into their house to check on their animals. and i got 25$!!! i was only supposed to get 18$!!! so i think now that i have all this cash, i am gonna get some new video games, since my mom doesnt like me haveing internet in my room, eh, i can stand dial up untill i get 50 more $$, oh, and one more thing...john says my blog has gotten annoying with all of the scrolling text, so there shall be a few limitations to my scrolling.  1) Countdowns 2) Very Important announcments 3) i dont know, you'll see   8 more days untill my B-day!   adieu

      Well, be warned this is gonna be one long post....  to start it off with, i would like to say, IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK!!! now that i have said that...it is time for you to hear about my vacation.   Tuesday:  We left our house around 5:00 p.m. and drove untill midnight and spent the night at a Louisiana rest area.   Wed.:  Drove some more, we got into Panama City, Florida around noon, and we went to this outlet mall we saw, and i got myself a new watch. then, around 3, we went to the park we were staying at and checked in. Then we left to drive around the city for a while. Then after we drove around we went back to the camp and got stuff ready for bed and next day. Only thing though is that it rained most of the night.   Thurs.:  We went to a nearby beach to go swimming and whatnot, but due to the rain, the beaches were all crummy and there was green crud floating around in the water. So we drove to another beach, and on the way my mom was like, "If this beach has green crud too, we are just gonna have to deal with it." Sure enough this one had crud too, only this one was WORSE! it had more crud than the other! oh well...we swam most of the day, and i dug holes in the sand. We all got sunburnt. then we drove along Panama City some more, and went back to camp and slept.   Fri.:  We went to a Spring called...oh crud...what was it called?!?!? it was named after some Spanish guy...anyways...we spent most of the day there, and the water was FREEZING!!! 68 degrees (i think it was F) also, the water was a really nice blue... anyways, the place was turned into a natural swimming pool, with a rock diving board. it was cool. We all had fun.   Sat.:  We went to another Spring, i believe this one was called Malwuka or something like that...well, we went on a boat tour around the place, saw a bunch of birds, a couple snakes, and a few aligators. then we went to another part of it where they had this BIG swimming area, and it was really cold the first time in, but after that it was pleasant. They had this tower thing, where you climb up the staircase to get to the top, and you could jump off of it into the water, (which was 180 something Ft. deep.) and i must say it was REALLY fun! the first time i did it, i was wondering, "where is the water?!?! why havent i fallen into the water yet?!?" and then suddenly, i was underwater! it was sooooooo cool! Then, my sister wanted to jump off this lower thing into the water, and she kept going for it, and then stopping short, so my step dad snuck up behind her, and pushed her in! so i rescued her, and she disliked my step dad untill he bought her a Frosty and Wendy's.   Sun.:  We started to head home. before we left the park, we stopped by the beach to say goodbye to it, and when we got there, the water was omg perfect! there was no green crud floating around whatsoever! it sucked! but then, we got back in the car and headed home.   Mon.:(today)  we arived back at my house at about 5:30 this morning, and now here i am typing this for you. according to my mom, we need to clean house for company coming this weekend. but thats all for now.  so yes, i must say my trip was most enjoyable...i swear though...Panama City is nothing but beaches, hotels, and all you can eat resturaunts. not to mention every 30 seconds you would see a couple girls walking down the street in nothing but a bikini. *drool* lol!  but seriously, i dont know what was more fun....eating at an all you can eat resturaunt, or watching girls in bikinis walk down the street...i swear, i could never move to Florida...i would die of torture watching all those girls. but in the meantime....  adieu
