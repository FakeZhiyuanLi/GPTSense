      (12:40am Wednesday)  This is soo very true! For the first time in awhile...I had a moment to reflect on my life. Now many people don't know this...b/c of the way I am/and the way i carry myself...so I will let u know a little bit about me.  Lets just say, the real world for Trish started at a very young age....15 to be exact.Im not going to get into the specifics n jist of everything...b/c that time in my life has passed and now that I am older I can honestly say that im glad it happened to me when it did. Im not sure how I made it out alive.....I can remember some of my worst days like it was yesterday. Crying every day, no selfesteem, sad,depressed and hungry. I never knew where my next meal was going2come from.I never knew where I would sleep at nite...and that was if i even slept at all....cheating the bus system with saved transfers so that I could get to a shelter where i could lay my head...not sleeping b/c I was scared of what my herion head roomate would do. Yeah life was tuff....and thats doesn't even brush the surface of what I endured.Though im older, n wiser, and better off now than I ever thought I would be...I have relapses that allow me to check myself in whatever current situtation comes up "things could be worse...whatever Im going through today...can be and will be resloved...if I beleive". I stress about a lot of things...n its b/c i don't ever want to go back to that dark place I was once at b4. I think if i fear n e thing...that might be in the top3. I jus thank god...for all the people n friends he put in my path at that time he did. I didn't realize it then..but I do now. I was thinking about the people that saved me...I doubt that they knew it then..but they are the reason I am here today! They did the little things: they listened to me,they feed me and they showed me the right path to follow....now it toke awhile for me to trust...n e one for that matter.....and b/c I was a young jit I wasn't able to tell the difference and C the lite..it toke years. N mind u these people weren't my family memebers....its a shame that blood is suppose to be thicker than water...but in this case water was my AID.  My life now, consist of both...family and friends. I have learned how to forgive but not forget. The friends that I am closest with have all taught me what a family is suppose to consist of...one of them is forgiveness...following right behind that is Love and inner peace.   :)

      My weekend was off the chain!! I seen the movie The Note Book..it was sooo romantic!! Remember what it was like that one summer that u met someone and the whole summer ya'll was inseperable!! Man oh man...i had sum crazy summers...any ways the movie was along those lines....I would tell u but i would rather u watch it! Yes many of u would not like it...but if ur a hopeless romantic such as my self...u def need to c this movie.  Ok...well that was friday..Saturday i went to the Carribean festival they had in Washington....Man it was packed!! They had music, cook-outs and people were just dancing every where! It reminded me of Carribana in Toronto...we were there most of the day...u couldn't even get sum thin to eat w/o waiting in line for like half an hour! Nothing crazy happend everyone was just out having fun!  N Sunday i chilled with my homegurl at her family...they had a bbq and we drank n played spades, and laughed about all sorts of silly stuff...the whole weekend was just soo relaxing and chill....D.C might be a destination to move too!

      Its funny..the other day I was having a discussion with some friend of mine about web dating and meeting someone at a club.Some of my friends like to pick people up n e where they can...others think that web dating is the way to go..I will leave their name anonymous...but (lets call her A) has the greatest luck when it comes to men picking her up at a club or bar...i mean....they are not all the greatest but it seems to be her "THING"....n e how...she decids wheiter or not she likes them enuff to give out her number or more or less take theirs. Now of course her decsion is totally based on looks...So (lets call her B) B was like...shoot u can do that on the web too...its the same thing...only you will know a different side to them.  Its kind of strange.... in some ways its the same and in others it can be better or worse......a person can lie on the computer (of course its sooo easy) and they can lie to u face to face, ur intially attracted to the pic...n even then that could be a back in the day photo...or not even them. But I think the people who chat online have the same chance of getting to know each other weither or not ur actually seeing each other physically or just chatting online and on the phone....(people have a tendency to hide things very well) it builds suspense and excitment for the next meeting. But then again when ur chatting online u don't get to c the likes n dislikes of that person....but u don't get to c the likes n dislikes when ur with some1 till ur LIVING with them either.   Now if u get a person who is funny, witty with his/her writting skills and each note or email is stimulating in different ways..You feel anxious for a response...but nervous as to what he or she will say. Then its like every time u read it......the chances of u liking the person or falling for them either grows stronger or weaker, either way they have ur attention...maybe its just another form of entertainment or attention. (thas another topic in its self)  I mean what is the difference ya'll?  So i guess my question is to u...which would u prefer.   OH YEA....ITS THE WEEKEND N ITS ON N POP'IN HERE IN D.C!!!! CIAO

      Outside my window, a new day i c and only i can dertermine what kind of day it will be. It can be busy and sunny laughing and gay or boring and cold unhappy and grey My own state of mind is the determining key For  I AM THE ONLY PERSON I ALLOW MYSELF 2B  i can be thoughtful and do all i can  to help  or be selfish and think just of myself I can enjoy what i do and make it seem fun or gripe and complain and make it hard on someone I can be patient with those who may not understand or belittle and hurt them as much as i can. But I have faith in myself and beleive what I say and I personally intend to make the best  of each day.

      Its saturday....the last day at my old job as an assitant manager...I have decided to try my luck as a Contract programmer...I will be training indivduals around the USA and Europe how to use what ever popular program out in the fast food industry, resturants and hotels as well as airports. I choose this job b/c it allows me to work independantly (growing up I have done very well with independant projects)...and I get to travel the world for weeks at a time ( I still have some places i want to visit)...and the pay is str8. (LOL....i know ur not expecting me to say what the pay rate is....cuzz if u did...JUS NOSEY..lol). Okay back to what i was rambling on about...though I have have to put in some long hours...this might be the job to kick start the other goals that i have. I know that this job will effect my life in many ways...(keeping in contact with friends, being away from family n my peeps) but once again...it will be sort of like a scholarship in the sense that i will be extremely busy n time will determine who n what i can fit in....though I make my own schedule it still will be tedious with travling and all. So it will go a lill sumthing like this...............work for 2-3 weeks in lets say...Germany (that will prolly be for 3-6wks)and n e time after 5 i can do what i want....knowing me; quick bit to eat, shower, get in my cozy cloths, n then im laying it down to sleep...but by the time I get up it will be 9ish...lol..good time for free calls...had i been in the states...oh lord i forgot about the time difference...germany is 6hrs ahead of eastern time. Okay...yea this job is going to be exciting for me....I wish i could do it with some one i knew...thas its only down fall. :(  Ok...lovely BP  I got to pack it up and get ready to head out...I will be in the washington DC area...so hit me up and ill get back to u when.....TIME PERMITS! MUCH LUV XOXOX 1

      A lot of people have asked me this question...and I thought about it...and came up with one answer I really truely wish were possible...but it may be follow along the guidelines of not haveing the power to tamper with free will. I said, if i could have one power it would be to travel through the past when ever I wanted. I choose that because i wanted to know how certain things came about; like y sum people act the way they do, and if the philosophers were serious when they came up wit sum of the crazyness they talk about. I mean...i would like to know what happend...for my self....all these stories n books that are written...the books that we have had to study n learn....I want to know the TRUTH....or do I?? Don't get me wrong i don't want the power to change what has already happened I just want to C and experience it for myself.   Now i ask u....if u had the power to do n e thing.....~~~WHAT WOULD URS B??~~~

        &nbsp;  Time has a funny way of working things out. It can work in your favor....though some times it may seem like its preventing or holding you back.    &nbsp;   High school;     during this time you live with your parents so you have a curfew, chores, a brother or sister to take care of when u come home, extra cicrucular activity(s) and homework. Its stressful for a teenager during this time, now being in high school isn't always easy. It&nbsp;can be a good or awful expereince...in regards to finding friends, seeing how you get along with others,&nbsp;having your first boyfriend&nbsp;or girlfriend,&nbsp;making that&nbsp;grade, having to&nbsp;show ur report card to your parents.   During this time you don't realize that your teachers and peers are trying to help you. Wheither you listen or not....what they say will&nbsp;forever stick&nbsp;in your mind.&nbsp;By time you get&nbsp;into your&nbsp;senior year and you start to apply to college, JC or&nbsp;a&nbsp;Job the pressures get greater&nbsp;from your&nbsp;love ones&nbsp;who know what its like out their in the&nbsp;"Real World", they want you to&nbsp;get out and do something productive.    &nbsp;   Now College/Job;    On your own, away from mom and dad. Now you have to learn to do all for yourself with minium help. Yeah at first it seems a little overwhelming...but soon enough you get used to it. All that you learned in high school will apply to how u live on campus or your job atmoshpere. All the friends that you had in high school, you may or may not keep in contact&nbsp;with them;&nbsp;their out their doing the same thing as you, but in another state/province. Its a new era for you...everything is so much bigger and better....the questions arises "will i fit in"?   Instead of picking your friends, you get to be around such a&nbsp;diverse variety of&nbsp;people that you learn to acccept everyone  for who they are, in return they accept you for being you &nbsp;Which is such a bonus, for you perosonally and those that work with you. Being on campus or at work&nbsp;for&nbsp;serveral consistant&nbsp;years..you get to know and see everyone on a regular basics like you did when u were living at home with your fam. They know you, from the time you get their as a freshman who thought they were ready all that life had to offer to&nbsp;a sophmore who has&nbsp;grown for the last year to a&nbsp;junior&nbsp;who is getting&nbsp;trying to get right to a senior who is&nbsp;now prepared to go&nbsp;out their and be sucessful.&nbsp;They seen you at your worst, at ur peek they serve as your parents in a sense; ...making sure you get and stay on track with&nbsp;classes, grades and drop/add. Just like an Angel, guiding you&nbsp;gently down a road of sucess.&nbsp;Everything else you do by yourself.&nbsp; But during this time, your not aware of all your learning out of the classroom that you never knew before, it sort of becomes the norm for you...so you do it unconsciously. But when you get back to where ever you call home, you realize how much you have actually grown up and how much maturer you are now. Its a good feeling...and its preparing you for "life after college".    &nbsp;   Life After College/Promotion or better job offer:    Hey no one said it was going to be easy to get a job right out of college/ Or adjusting to your new co-workers. Once again you have to make that transition from high school to college and now to the working or corparate world.&nbsp;Everything about you will&nbsp;gradually change; your attire away from work, your attitude on the job, the time you wake up till the time you come home. There will be no more rules or restrictions, no one to guide you through anything or tel l you how to live your life. Your social life will change new/old circle of friends will evolve now&nbsp;around working schedules and your weekends. Now&nbsp;the idea of coming home to&nbsp;that&nbsp;someone special or being around friends&nbsp;seems more appealing than it ever did before.&nbsp;&nbsp;Its time to&nbsp;think bigger and better.   Things happen gradually, one day your going to wake up and be like....."its time for a change".

Im in Katterbach Germany with no internet connection,   a burger king that is being renovated so their running   their resturant out of a huge trailer, so we have to&nbsp; set   up and do training...about a mile away from the actual    store. But what makes it worst is that when we did set    up the computers, we had to set them up in the new    burger king...so there a lot of consrtuction going on, a lot   of dust, wires, n flies..now these flys are every where..    some days&nbsp;i felt like i was working in Africa! They're just    everywhere. Pleased, im not...a bad combo of DUST, WIRES   CONSTRUCTION WORKERS N BIG OL HORSE FLYIES! Its&nbsp;been   a nightmare for me. Though my co-worker was this is jus   a specail case...im not tryin to hear it. Katterbach is going under   one of my many horror stories of working for MICROS. I swear i    take 2 showers a day...then what makes it worst...im staying on    base...for the past two nights i have been eaten alive by mosquitoes!!   Last night i slept in a long sleeve shirt n my sweat pants...i may have   lost 30pds but i was BIT FREE of them critters.    &nbsp;  NOT HAPPY OR PLEASED.

First of all..my homegurl that played for Cleavland WNBA, n in Korea...was tellin me about how this lady mis-understood what she was said and completly blew it out of context. Bmac(Im using her alias name) is a ball playa, she helps people out with their game if asked. So this older white lady from Alaucha Conty asked her to show her sum of the drills that we do as basketball players to remian in shape. So she did....by the second drill Brandi was like this lady was blown n suck'in wind as though it were her last...n if u have never done bb drills; Its only expected....n e way..... she looked like she was going to fall out...so of course B was like....u Str8? The lady got affended n upset and left the court....B was confused and jus thought she couldn't take it n e more y she left....a day later it turns out that the lady told her co-worker that B was a Leisban and was asking her what her sexual prefernce was while doing drills, n it made her uncomfortable!!! LOL...i shouldn't laugh but...i know if i ask u if ur "str8" it usually means are u ok! I mean....really!! I was like "WOW" if she would just look at the situation n the context it was put in...she would have saved her self the embrassment of even letting those words come out of her mouth....of course B was laughin at the situation as i was rollin at the whole thing....but man..some people are way out the loop for real!  CONGRADULATIONS KHALIHAH My Nucca is going to play in France....mmmmmm wine n cheese!! lol...im going to france ya'll...i mean thats where she will be playing!!   Oy yea...TGREG... u got issues....though u never seems to amaze me...stay away from my fam(jus kiddin)....U know i luv ya!!

Her aunt use to play the piano back in her day...n hasn't in a while. So consequently there was a piano available to them, she started playing fooling around with the keys. Well my cousins dad walks in and starts singing at the top of his lungs like he was Skinny Lutha,i mean veins poppin out the side of his neck n in his forehead...im he was blowin!! So the other older lady joins in and starts singing like she is Tina Turner..yea she was exposing thangs that should have remained covered up...def not Tina's Legs!!

Reading the cover of a book does no justice..all books have covers to spark ur intrest...they come a dime a dozen...bigger brighter..bolder, sexier, fat n skinny;it doesn't assure u that its worth its price... b/c of its appreance n what it portrays on the OUTSIDE and the Intro is so brief n broad, u can't get sense of what it has to offer....Open it up...this could be the start of a new begining.  Open ur mind n ur heart...have an open mind...every turned page leaves u wanting more....read further n with every paragraph, sentence and word brings a sense of urgency to go a lill further, jus to comprehend fully of Y,How,When, Where and What....And when ur think u know everything and the book is over, u put it down n return to what u used to do....nothin seems the same, as a matter of fact....it would be time for another edition...greater n better than the last.&nbsp; urlLink

      Well folks...im back in G-ville...n the luv from my peeps is real. They missed me...lill ol me..hahah. Naw but on the real...upon exiting the airport and seein their faces waitin for me.... it felt good to be home again...but as soon as i got to the apartment...i felt estranged...like wow...im finally back home and it doesn't really feel like its home any more. I guess when u do a lot of travling and ur away for weeks sometimes months at a time....u tend to get use to travel and u never completely forget where you have spent most ur time but the feelin of what its like to be back in that familiar place all rushes back to u with each pic u see left on ur dresser, each pillow sheet u left on ur pillow and the cloths that are in ur drawer. I mean...i feel like i've been travlin my whole life..n i have....and every time i get to settle for a couple of weeks or months...I get this instant rush of Remembering what happened b4 i left. Is it good...yea n no. Im not running from anything...but i prolly left and hurt some people with my decsion to travel....hey I never mean to hurt n e one..but its the price u pay when u want to do something n when that one time opportunity is offered, I will (hopefully) have no regrets.

      I had a mini spa session with myself last nite;  Cucumber Peel-off mask, greased my nappy head.. ALL OF IT! Toke a long shower, shaved and had some calls just as i was about to watch "Sex In The City"  This morning I was awaken by a phone call...and it was my home-gurl callin just to make sure all was good. N it always feels good to get calls from the people u most care about while ur across the waters. Good thing the phone rang when it did..i was just about to lay my head back down knowing i  had to get up, sign out the hotel and get dressed for work. I wake up to large drops of rains on my window pane.  My Window is always open...I love to listen to whats  going on outside; not loud music, no one cussin, no drama! I mean, i miss the US/T.Dot...but its so relaxing not to worry about Drama and violence over here in Germany. The only thing I dread about when i sleep with my windows  open is my allergies!! But won't kill me will make me stuffy in the morning! lol  So I packed this morning...A G A I N...i think i'm getting better at this...i made more space for my latest purchases.  Now im at work, bored at hell in this office!Im really glad  that only have one more week left.Its was a nice trip..though 6weeks...alone, is just a little too much .....even  for me.

      Well ya'll my time here in germany is winding down as well as the summer. I missed the majority summer...thas never happened before. I had bits and peices of opportunities to hang out, meet new, revist some friends all while working; though it was so short lived. Its cool though,too much of anything isn't always good i mean i would have slept, drank (water and tinted Koolaid lol), and tried to be cute the whole summer!!! This year, I got a chance to travel and see things i never thought about, be some where i never thought i would be and meet some really cool ass people that may be life long friends.   Its funny how things work out...i planned noone of those trips Shoot, looks like my summer was arite after all. But trust me....im ready to just go home and relax, get my feet and hair redone n listen to everyone else and what they did. I miss my peeps back at home.  Im exstatic that i will be there soon!!  Now im about to leave work...and i know im gettting tired of being here...i have a scarf over my head to match the shirt and bracelt im wearing. Yea....but i look professional still, in a business ekia badu kind of way. LOL...im about to leave soon...n e how. The rest of the day is mine...maybe ill get a tattoo or sum thin....I will see how i feel when i get there.  CIAO Tired Trish :(

      I got an email today from a friend that i haven't heard from in YEARS!! I mean this boy knew a lot about me and we jus feel out of touch. But he found me....man...this world is LIKKLE....haha. Well he found me along with many others that were aquintances and i  never really spoke with. Its funny how you remember certain people for things they did or didn't do; back in the day. And its always good to hear what their doing now and that they have not forgotton about u and what u use to be like. Looks like my trip back home is going to be like a reunion type trip....they betta come to the crib....CUZZ IM GOING TO BE CHILLIN H A R D!!!  I have been soo lazy ya'll i haven't ran or touched a ball since i  got back from Amsterdam....I woke up and felt fat!! Ughh...i hate  that feeling...so you know what i did...went for a run...and i was sucking wind like a fat person walking up the kitchen! Dang...i need to get back on the ball!!  Fluffy
