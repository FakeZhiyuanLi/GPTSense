      OMG.........rumi's getting married on the 4th of July :O.....i know she went to get married and all, but still its such a huge shock....she's getting married b4 runa is (runa's isnt settled it, im guessing there are still issues that need to be solved...rumi said runa might end up marrying someone she knows from the states :O...its not that big of a shock though, i had my ideas about that even b4 she left...i just hope all goes well and she gets to marry who she wants, i mean afterall isnt marriage suppose to be about happiness and bonding and eternal luv)...i guess rumi wants to keep the family tradition still on (her mom got married b4 altaf's mom, and altaf's mom is older than her)  so anywayz...back to rumi...so yeah she's getting married on the 4th of July (so is shammi afa)...rumi's making me seem soo old and outdated and off the market..lol...she's gonna be the first one to make me a zetali (i think thats how u spell it)...im gonna be an unmarried zetali, and rumi's hubby has to bend down and do salam to me and im gonna have to pay him....damn...im still in shock though.....i cant even still digest tahera's and happy's weddings...and they're at least at of age, now rumi!!!!...omg....  so i called bd last night and talked to tahera and her hubby....her hubby is maaaaad funny...cant wait till he comes to the states..mo...we're gonna have maad fun....oh btw mo, tahera keeps asking y u havent called yet..she said she left u a message too on ur phone, so i told her ur gonna call......so call :) ....azir bhai is a piece of work...he left me speechless last night...he told me he used up our gift in just one week :)...i just hope he goes out and gets some more of those, cuz i dont want tahera to come back with anyone else :)  anywayz...my breaks going on overtime now...lol...i was supposed to go back to work at 10:20 its almost 10:30...Dan's not here, so im taking advantage of that fact :)...gotta go back to work now and deal with the old wierdo, who is btw STILL not talking to me...he's sooo childish ...i mean ur freakin 60 something yrs old...grow up and stop acting like a child....

      Bole woh dosti, chupp karaye woh pyaar. Hasaye woh dosti, rulaye woh pyaar. Milaye woh dosti, juda kare woh pyaar. Phir bhi na jaane log DOSTI chodd ke kyun karte hain PYAAR   ....quite interesting quote

      and i thought nothing could change my mood after monday...boy was i wrong.....all u need is an overly-annoying dad, a mom who keeps decreasing ur height in order to find a "good zamai", and the other wonderful stresses of finding the right jivan sathi...  i dont understand this whole concept of marriage...am i not the person getting married or should get married???....y is it that i have to mend to other's aspirations and ideas of me meeting the ideal man???  anywayz...madiha just called.....so im gonna have to bitch later

      Aankhon Aankhon Se Koi  Teer Chalta Rehta Hai Is Kadar Saawan Mein Bhi Jism Jalta Rehta Hai Pyaas Jitni Rooko Main Utni Badhti Jaati Hai Dooriyon Ki Bechaini Mujhko Uh Tadpati Hai Shaamo Sehar Bezaar Kare Jeena Dushwaar Kare Hai Jo Bhi Yaha Pyaar Kare  Jeena Dushwaar Kare Hai Kitna Pagal Dil Hai  Kaise Yeh Mushkil Hai Bewaja Kisi Pe Aitbaar Kare Jo Bhi Yahan Pyaar Kare  Jeena Dushwaar Kare Hai

      The sweetest thing I've ever known Was like the kiss on the collarbone Soft caress of happiness The way you walk, your style of dress I wish I didn't get so weak Ooo, baby, just to hear you speak Makes me argue just to see How much you're in love with me See, like a queen, a queen upon her throne  It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know,  It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know  I get mad when you walk away (don't walk away) So I tell you leave, when I mean stay Warm as the sun dipped in black Fingertips on the small of my back More valuable than all I own Like your precious, precious, precious, precious light skin tone  It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know,  It was the sweet, sweet, sweetest thing I know  "Sweetest Thing" Lauryn Hill

      shumi sent me a forward with some pretty interesting quotes that almost describes the way i feel.....  "The worst way to miss someone is to be sitting right beside them knowing you can't have them."  "Don't cry because it is over, smile because it happened." (this quote will come in handy soon enough :/ )
