        Memorial Day 2004: This is an important day for everyone. Remembering the ultimate sacrifice that many young men made for you and me. My father served in WWII. My mother served in WWII. I however never served. I won’t spend time explaining why I didn’t serve. The times were strange back in 1980. I’m an only child and my parents didn’t want me endangering myself, and after Watergate and Vietnam I thought it was a good idea.   I do appreciate the sacrifice through. They did something no young man should have to do. End their time when their just really getting started. So as my kids play and I enjoy having the time to write this, a special thanks to all those brave men in every war and &quot;police action&quot; who paid for my freedom with their sacrifice.      THANK YOU! GOD BLESS YOU!

      OK here I am in my 40’s (42 to be exact) and I’m feeling that grumpy old man feeling creeping into me. I finished vacuuming the house and I have dinner cooking in the oven. With my wife on the couch, my son is watching cartoons, and my daughter on the computer (playing Sims). Working around the house makes me feel good. Do I feel a little used? Sure I’m not a not a dope, but if there is one thing I have learned is I have to take care of me.   Most people think that’s relaxing on a couch and catching your favorite shows, or playing a game or two on X-box. I have decided that is not what it means to me. Taking care of me is looking in the mirror each night and seeing someone who has done something. If I can count off a few accomplishments (they don’t have to be big ones), I’ll be able to sleep well that night.  When my ticket gets punched and I board that afterlife express. It is important to me that my days were filled with getting something done. I need to contribute. Everyone else will have to work out what they need for themselves.

      OK. Are Motorcycles safe? Hell No! Safe is defined as, free from harm or risk and secure from threat of danger, harm, or loss (Webster). BUT dang near nothing in life is safe. At least not the fun stuff.   So do I have a problem with motorcycles? Yes two. Boy (I was one once) let their hormones get ahead of their commons cents.  The other problem I have is that they are COOL! Since they re cool, people riding them don’t wear protective gear and responsible clothing. Why? Because their Cool image maybe tarnished.  My wife drives a motorcycle. She wears a helmet, gloves, long pants, and over the ankle boots. I think she does a really good job of balancing cool with responsible. What about you?

      So I’m asking myself. Why do you want to blog at the age of 42? It seems like a waste of the little time you have everyday, but then I know that there is a part of me that wants to say something. A voice inside me, who wants to get something get off its chest. Time is a limited priceless gift we are given, but sometimes that gift is best spent on yourself so you can enjoy the rest of you time with others.  So that’s what I’m doing. I’m doing this for me. You will see rants and raves about being a husband, father, living in Texas, working, and just living.  Hope there is some soul out there who can at least be encouraged to write their own blog after reading this space in time I have reserved for me.

      Dang! I have been at the hospital the past couple of days. My Mother had rectal bleeding (I know TMI!), but life is pretty dirt. I decided a long time ago to not turn away from everything that is not part of the “Perfect Life” illusion. She is doing OK right now. Her vitals are stable and the bleeding is small. They gave here more blood so it looks like she’ll be fine.  My mom’s a hell of a woman! She was one of six kids, her and five boys. She was born in 1920 in Bridgewater MA (near Boston). She lived through the depression, WWII , and all the crap after it. She got a nursing degree in 1942 and joined the Army when WWII started. She serviced as an Army nurse in Great Britain for four years. She used the GI bill to get her bachelor’s degree in nursing after the war. She worked for the Veteran’s Administration (VA) Hospitals for 25 years. She met my Father in Florida in 1952. They had me in 1962 in Memphis, TN. She retired from the VA and worked for a few years at a retirement center. After I graduated in 1986 she and my Dad moved to Sun City, AZ to retire. They live there happily for many years.   I thank God everyday for giving me a great Mom (and Dad). I have always felt they would sacrifice anything for my welfare. It is really cool to grow up with unquestioning love from a mother and father all your life.
