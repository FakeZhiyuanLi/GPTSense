      So I realize that I'm a horrible friend. I still haven't L's package out that contains her Birthday gift as well as her graduation gift.  Could I be worse of a friend? Somebody should omit me from the friend gene pool, as I totally suck at being a good friend.  Now that I've remembered where I put her gift and that I hadn't indeed sent it out I can't send it anymore. She's moving and I don't have her new address yet.  Son of ze bitch.  If anyone else happens to read this, don't be my friend.  I am teh suck.   On a less shitty note I watched Win a Date with Tad Hamilton last night.  After convincing myself that it would suck I was surprised to find that it didn't.  Now I don't particularly like Kate Bosworth but I love that kid from That 70s Show.  There's something about a guy with dry wit and humor that really appeal to me.  Such as the boyfriend.  He's hilarius in that same kind of way.  But whoever that Tad Hamilton dude was totally unbelieveable in a not good kind of way.  Oh well.

      I don't know what it is with the cat but the past 2 days I've been making sandwiches for lunch.  As soon as I crack the deli meat baggie the cat starts trying to climb the cabinets and mews like crazy.  I then look at her and explain to her that she can't have deli meat because it will give her kidney failure.  She doesn't seem to get it tho.  She just keeps on mewing and hoping that I'll feed her some of the forbidden stuff locked away in a bag that smells so good.  She breaks my heart and she knows it because once I put it away she gives me this hurt "How could you not give me any?  Don't you love me?" looks.  Oh well she'll get over it.

      Oy!  What a weekend.  I went thru and cleaned the entire apartment because I'm anal retentive.  It's spotless now, I just hope it stays that way.  Decided to recommit myself to getting healthy and in-shape.  I'm eating well today and starting the Couch 2 5K program today.  But I think I'm going to feel pretty stupid walking for a minute and a half and jogging for a minute for 20 minutes.  But oh well, if it means in 12 weeks I'll be able to run 3 miles I'll be happy.  I decided I'm going to do yoga on the off days.  So 3 days of runnin to get me in shape and 3 days of yoga to limber me up and lean me down.  Plus yoga kind of centers me.  It gives me a peace that I don't really get anywhere else yet.  It really makes me aware of my body.  I think I'm going to start another Blog to keep as a food/Exercise journal to keep track of what I'm doing.  Think I'll go do that now!

      Dearest,     Could you please start doing your business on both sides of the litter box.  The autocleaning kind can't distribute propperly and you fill 1/4 of the container and I have to change it.  It'd last much longer if you'd use both sides of the box sweetie.  Make mommy a happy girl.  Love and skritches,   Your human companion

      Alright, so this is my first post.  Such a weird thing this is.  I always want to keep one for myself but I never really utilize it propperly.  Ah well, so I'm coming from LJ who has become more of a pain in the ass than anything.  They suck the big one.  Nonetheless I'm here and it's my first post so I don't have much to say.  Nyah!

      So I didn't do the yoga last night.  I really felt like I needed some time to rest so I didn't get overwhelmed with the process.  I'll be back at it tonight again.  I think I might do it at the house again and start going outside once I'm not looking like a tool switching every 90 seconds.  It seems to be working out okay.  I can't help but feel guilty like I'm already letting myself down cutting out the yoga for a while.  I really think I should concentrate on picking up running according to their recommendations before I start adding things to the mix.  I'm feeling better and thats a good thing but I'm hopelessly tired.  I really have to stop waiting up for Ged to come home or else I'm never going to make it.  Thank god I'm on vacation next week, I can sleep in like crazy!

      So as it goes I feel wonderful today.  I'm attributing it to my reaffirmation in healthy eating and exercise.  Of course it is, why wouldn't it be?  I feel less bloated and more energized.  Of course I overslept this morning but I think it's because I didn't go to bed until late even tho I was tired.  So today's Yoga.  I love yoga, I can't even explain it.  It's so relaxing and after the day I had I'm going to really need it!!

      Phew!  Boy am I beat.  But I feel good tho.  I feel accomplished.  It's actually a really good program.  By the time you think you're lungs are going to concave from the running you go back to walking to recoup.  But holy shit am I beat now.  I think I'm gonna go chill out and watch a movie.  I'm on my way - day one in the books.  Yoga tomorrow!!!

      That was one of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time.  Whoever at Boars Head thought up the Buffalo Chicken Deli Meat rocks my socks.

      I'm feeling pretty good about today. I'm tired but I'm amped about starting my workout routine.  Eating well is usually not too bad until I think that I've blown it and give up and scarf everything I can get my hands on.  It makes it difficult to follow a "program".  I think I might try to do this on my own and see how it goes.  They say a self-developed program is the best way to do things.  Eating things that are healthy for me, cutting calories where I can, working out according to my plan.  I think I'm going to try that for the month of July and see how it works.  If it goes well, I'll keep it up and cancel weight watchers.  If not I'll get onto the weight watchers thing.  Anyway.  Day 1 at 190lbs.  I have to check my body fat on that scale when I get home.  I'm sure it's disgustingly high.  Hopefully that'll change soon!
