        Last night i had the coolest most outrageous dream ever. It' was so awesome im debating wether or not to make it into a story or not. But if in the future i ever decide to, i need to hav it down in paper...or for this thingy...internet. Okay..so basically it starts out that i'm with my soccer team and we have a tournie in Canada. Coincidence? Haha..i had just been thinking about them..again...for the thousandth time. But the only people i remember seeing in my dream were Diana, Coach Mike, Diana's little sister, and the Canadian boy. Okay so i decide to go for a walk ( in my dream), and i come across this little tablet. It looks like on of those candy things...it was blue and i pic it up. I decide to continue on my walk. I get close to this river thing where i see a boy of my age sitting in the river helping a mom (animal) with her babies. The weird thing is...the babies look exactly like those little mood things you see on here...they r orange and look like foxes. I trip and fall into the river with my little colored tablet. The tablet turns into a dragon made of mist. The weird thing is..i can ride it.. The boy yells out to me, " Oh NO..be carefull!!" then i see one of the little baby livejournal foxes fall into the river and is going down the rapids. The boy yells to me to save it so i fly down toward it and pick it up. It feels like plastic..but i think whatever its my dream so ill let it be. SO as im flying back to the boy.. i look down at the center of the dragon where a little guage is. It has blue bubbly stuff inside and it's half gone. I bring the baby back to the boy when the dragon disappears and i fall into the water. The next part is weird for many reasons..one, he doesnt tell me his name..two, out of no where diana shows up..and three, again..out of no where i suddenly have alot of these tablets. Then (and this is where it gets shady since im slowly forgetting the dream) diana, canadian boy with no name, and me are flying around on these dragons to a house..more like a shack...where we are hiding becuase these strange people are hunting us for? i have no idea..maybe the tablets or maybe because the canadian is a prince of some sort. But anyway..outside..the house sucks..inside it's a palace. We go into the rooms looking for a hiding spot..there are all these awesome clothes and jewerly every where. Then canadian boy and me hide under the bed and diana stands behind the door (great hiding spot diana..haha i still love you though..*laughs*). The strange people look all over for us but can't find us..not even Diana. So we leave the shack/palace and are now near a waterfall and diana, and i have to get home soon because it's time to leave this weird canadian place. So we rush back to our "ride" home. It is a flying ship. You know, like the ones from final fantasy. And my dog somehow appears there in the ship. I give the canadian boy i had just met a huge hug...we fall on the ground with him on top of me, and he shoves handfuls of the tablets in my pockets. It's diana's turn and she just gives him a hug and then we leave. While on the ship, Katie (diana's little sister) grabs her tablets and runs out onto the deck of the ship we are flying. She thrusts them into the sky and the dragons pop out and take her away. Everyone is freaking out and then coach mike comes out and he's like " You have to try 110% at all times" or something like that..something that he always says before a game. So me and diana are flyin on the dragons tryin to save Katie when canadian boy comes back and decides he's gonna help. Then all of our dragons are out of "magic?" ithink and we are all falling into a neverending waterfall. Weird. We get out another tablet and are flying around and see Katie on her dragon (funny how hers lasted longer). And then my dream ended because my mom came and woke me up. At guess what time? 1 PM in the afternoon. I was soo surprised..but w/e i think this is good enough to make into a story. Leave comments and tell me what you think? Please?
