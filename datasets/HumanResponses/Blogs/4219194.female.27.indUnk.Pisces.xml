      I am back- Miss me??  SO, I have been back over a week now and haven't done an entry! I wish I was still on vacation! It was so nice to be away for 16 days. Florida was beautiful! We decided not to go to Disney. We ran out of time. If we could plan our trip again we would have spent a whole lot more time in central Florida. We only had 3 days. Not long enough, especially when its 87 degrees. Anyway, we endured 3 days of driving to get home. It was great bonding time for me and my son. He is such a good rider for a 2 year old. I think I got more cranky then him! We had pillow fits, made a tent (to my husband's disbelief) and played, played, played. We also took naps. It was LONG! But we made it. My husband's grandma is so sick. It was difficult to see her like that. She is normally so feisty. My husband was able to tell her he loved her and she responded. That made it all worth while. We know we will see her in heaven and are grateful for that.  SO, now on to everyday life, I can tell you my vacation makes me want to be a stay at home mom. But can't for now, life will go on. At least I have some good friends to work with (most of the time &#61514 ;). My son has decided it was time to potty train. YES! POTTY TRAIN! If you read my other entries regarding the subject I am terrified!  On Wed. of our vacation we went to meet my husband's cousin's family from Ft Myers. We drove the hour back to where we were staying and he was dry. So I thought he would be very wet in the morning.  Wrong, dry and he went in the potty! Yeah! Anyway that day traveling we were at a restaurant and he declared he needed to go, so we went, and he did go! SO at every rest stop he went. Like 4 times that day, and 3 the next. We kept the diapers on just in case. Anyway, it's been a week, and we are starting all the way today. BYE DIAPERS (AS she screams "am I ready for this!?!?") He is very proud of himself being a big boy and all. We shall see, my mom is like "you put a diaper on him and your in for it." I don't know why I am so scared of this. I guess it makes it easier on me in the LONG run. But I fear pee going all over in a Walmart, or restaurant. You know the thoughts! Anyway, Deep Breath, I can do this, everything will be fine!  So here it is… my son LOVES PIZZA! We refuse to say the word at home, hide the tv screen during pizza commercials etc. Otherwise he yells "pizza mama pizza, I want…" If you ask him what he wants for dinner, even giving him two options that are not pizza he still says pizza. We went to a buffet restaurant the other night and before we even looked at the food, I said what do you want. He answered pizza. I guess that's when the madness began. At Walmart, walking down the pizza isle to get bread he began to chant "PIZZA, PIZZA, PIZZA" very loud. He was quite upset when I told him we would order it and not be getting it here. We then left to go get lunch, and I said do you want nuggets, he said "mama what about pizza?" I told him we would have it for dinner. I don't know why or what has caused this, we had pizza that night and he ate a whole piece, and I am talking big piece. HE is 2 and already sold out on pizza! I have always been a particular eater, but my son will only eat chicken nuggets, bologna, fries, cottage cheese, ice cream, fruit, and pizza. Nothing mixed up, no vegetables, hardly any meats, maybe some mac and cheese on occasion. I am thinking the poor kid is starving. This last weekend he hardly ate anything I fixed for meals, (lots of Bologna from the fridge), so on Sunday night we got him McDonalds nuggets and fries. HE ATE ALL 4 nuggets and ALL the fries! He is only 2 and I am not happy with his pickiness. Oh well, he will live I am sure, as long as I keep packs of bologna in the fridge.

      HOT: Good Morning! I am on vacation!! Yeah! We have spent the last week in Georgia with my husband's family. His grandparents even got to come spend the week with us. It was relaxing and fun. We had great weather. They live in the mountains which are so beautiful. We drove from Iowa the day after Christmas. It took us 18 hours! We did it all in one day!! My little 2 year old was so good. He wanted out the last couple hours though. He fell asleep and we kept on. I had a horrible tooth ache the whole ride. My poor husband had to do most of the driving cuz I was in pain. I think the antibiotic that I was on inflamed my gums. I stopped taking it and it stopped hurting. Whew!  We got to see my husband's sister's family. She just had a new baby boy. He was so little and cute. NO MOM, IT DIDN'T MAKE ME WANT ANOTHER ONE! All it took was some spit up all over me to kindly remind me babies are work. My husband's brother was there and they have two kids also. My son had a BLAST playing with them. My son got very attached to his grandparents and great grandparents. It was a good time of bonding for them.  Yesterday we drove 13 hours to Central Florida. My husband's other grandma is ill and we are about to go visit her. It is 75 degrees out already and only 12:00. The high should be 87 today! HOT! When we FINALLY got here last night my son said "I want Papa, and Mammie." We had to explain we would see them in a couple days.  We are staying with my husband's aunt. She has 2 horses, 9 goats, and a mama pig with 4 piggies. We went out this morning to play with them. My son was in shock. He lead a horse around the pasture. We tried to catch a piggie but they run FAST!  My husband finally gave up. They are only 2 weeks old and so cute.  We will be leaving here Thursday morning with hopefully stop at the Animal kingdom or Magic Kingdom before that. We are planning to drive up through Alabama with a stop at my husband's grandparents house. His  parents will be taking them home that day so we will see them one more night.  They were very excited that we would be able to see them yet again. It's hard to live so far away from family. It sure makes for a long drive. I am guessing it will take 30 hours to get home to Iowa. It sure has been fun, but I don't even want to get in that VAN! Hope it's warm where you're at. I know it's freezing in Iowa. We might go swimming in the ocean here! Yeah Florida. Did you know the ground is covered in black sand, and the trees have moss on them? I am learning all sorts of things here. Happy New Year!

      This weekend is going to be a blast! I have tons to do. My Birthday is Sunday and I am looking forward to celebrating at home. This week has gone by fast. How come it seems, I want to get so much more done then I take time to do? I wanted to bake cupcakes, yeah right! The weeknights always go by in a blur. I honestly can't wait for it to be light outside at 8:00. It always seems like I get more done in daylight.  The snow is melting-I can almost hear it scream. I know I am glad to see it go-sorry for those of you that actually LIKE it. (Crazy people!)  My son is growing up so fast! I went and got his 2 ½ pictures done and what a difference. He is actually talking now. Like sentences! Not just words! It is incredible, it surprises me how much he has changed. He is a good little boy. Potty training is coming along well. He is still struggling with poopie. The other morning we were getting ready for church and my husband decided to show my son how to sock fight. AT LEAST HE USED CLEAN SOCKS! My son at least likes to fight fair. I was getting ready for church and my husband and son were running around like crazy hitting each other with a sock. (or in some cases 2 socks). My son came up to me and said "here Mama" and as soon as I touched it he hit me. SO what am I to do but join in.  We had a great time. However 2 year olds don't know when to stop! SO we were late for church. OH well, the family moments were well worth it!

      Okay so you ask, did you fall off the planet, why haven't I done an entry? Don't know, really I love journaling! Just haven't had the time to put it on the computer. Well a lot has happened since my last entry. GO Figure!  My son is almost potty trained! YAHOO! He now has the #1 thing down to a science and has even done the #2 thing for several days in a row! This morning he was even dry, which totally surprised me since he had a lot of poop at 10pm last night. This is week 3 of the training and there is NO turning back now. I will tell you it has really gone pretty smoothly. He still has an accident a day, he gets playing and forgets to tell us in time. But I can deal with that. When we are out he does really well. We now know where all restaurants have bathrooms. But better that then the latter.  SNOW is everywhere here. There has to be at least 20 + inches out there. We continue to get hit weekly. I honestly can't see the road across the street because they have plowed it up SOO high from the parking lots. This morning actually felt warmer to me, maybe we got to double digits!  My husband just got hired at a really great company. We are thrilled. He has worked for them as a temporary employee for the last 3 months. They called him in last week and said we want to hire you. SO that means he is now the warehouse manager, has better pay and full benefits. YAHOO! Only thing is, he only gets one week of vacation each year for the next 2 years. SO sorry family members down south, it's gonna be a while before we see you again. Good thing we had a long vacation recently.  Well I will do better at journaling. My son continues to do CUTE stuff and you all are missing out on the information. He still loves Pizza. Had to go last night, he ate 2 big pieces, which were cut into 4 pieces, plus a whole lot of cottage cheese. Crazy kid!

      Wednesday already! WOHOO! I planned to do an entry on Monday but got hit with the stomach virus. Didn’t do much but sleep and you know what! I went to work for a couple hours but had to give in and go home to bed. My son was so cute; he wanted to play with me really bad. I told him “Mama’s tummy hurts, I am sick” he said “me too mama, I sick” and grabbed his tummy. It was cute; however it didn’t stop him from jumping on my bed!  Yesterday went by quickly. My stomach was sore, but not sick like the day before. Oh course now my sinuses are acting up. But I would much rather deal with that then the other! I went to bed pretty early. I woke up at like 3am to my son crying for a drink. My husband was last to bed, with my son, and neglected to put a cup in the fridge. (BUMMER) So I stumble around the house in search of the cup to wash and refill. Half asleep, when all of a sudden I notice one of our cats is in the house! (We have two OUTDOOR cats) I am like wake up husband, why is Cali (are cat) in the house?? It freaked me out, the movement, and oh it’s the cat. He said something about seeing a mouse and that he let both cats in. OH great, a mouse, all winter we have been mice free. (We rent a house, that has lots of places those things can get in, so we have to be very careful and alert). Now it’s SPRING and there is a mouse. ANYWAY I have a HUGE phobia for mice!  I didn’t get to talk to my husband before he left for work about details, like where did you see it, where did it go… you know important stuff! So this morning I am all jumpy. Anything moves or touches me and I’d jump. Of course, I am watching everywhere, every step, in case the cats got him and he’s lying dead somewhere. My son wakes up and runs like a crazy man through the house, I am thinking GREAT, now the mouse is going to run too! Don’t want to go home, I did find out the little mouse was by the computer, so SORRY won’t be doing entries at home until the critter is caught! GO CATS! I’ll let you know when the trouble ends. One thing is for sure, the cats know he is there, but do they care? I had a crazy dream that the cat’s made friends with the mouse just so they could stay inside the house. (They used to be indoor cats, until my son was born) I know it crazy, but I just want the thing OUT OF MY HOUSE! Anybody got any ideas?

      Man, can't believe I have not been online since Thursday! I missed you all! Friday was incredibly busy. I took my little sister "R" shopping with my son for all that fun Easter Egg hunt stuff. We hit 5 stores in 4 hours. We were truly worn out at the end of the day but we did have a lot of fun! I have to make 4 baskets for the drawings so that always proves challenging. The ages range from 6 months to 6th grade, of course each basket is by different ages. Problem is when you shop you have got to keep straight how many items you have for each one. ANYWAY, the kids loved them, we showed them today.  Friday night we got my husband a new computer game so I have been letting him play some. We also had a young adults get together which turned out to be rather fun. Saturday we clean house (JOY) and filled 300 Easter eggs. My son and I watched a couple movies while my husband played. We saw that new Bugs Bunny one (stupid if you ask me) and School of Rock (EVEN DUMBER). But it worked for background music and the occasional laugh.  Today was busy with church. We went out with a bunch of friends to Ryan’s. (My son did not have any more stomach attacks--Thank you GOD!) I made it to my 4:30 appt on time and after evening church my son and I headed to McD's for some play time! It was fun, I never realized how competitive he is though. He wanted me to play air hockey, but every time I scored he got mad. Finally he wouldn't let me have either puck, and I was left defenseless. Needless to say, he won! Good quality time, I LOVE IT! Early my husband and son played ball outside. It was beautiful today. I feel like even though we were busy, that we did get a lot of time this weekend with him. Tomorrow night we start infant swim class, can't WAIT!  This is my son's 3rd session. He loves it and it makes us have one night each week that we concentrate on him and not all the other things in our lives.

      Warning the following entry may be too much for some:  Tonight we decided to go back to Best Buy. Had to get my husband a computer game. Of course that just means we are going to have to share better. Well anyway by the time I picked up are son and got home to get my husband it was getting late. My mom informed me the our son had several loose #2 today and that it was NO FUN cleaning him up, since he still can't figure out how to sit on the toilet. (HE LIKES TO STAND). Anyway we go out to eat at a buffet, so we all can get something we want and it's fast. My son keep saying he had to go potty, so my husband and I took turns. I went first, then 10 min later he said "I go pee pee BAD" so my husband took him. Well about 10 min's after that he again said he had to go. (You'd think we'd get a clue he had to #2) Anyway my turn again. In the bathroom we go, he is standing there and he pees (again), I said are you sure it's not poopie, right then grab and throw on the toliet. He has it BAD. Luck I got him up there with minor amount of spillage (sorry). So he's going, all of a sudden he wants to see it, flush, back up on the toliet again. Then he starts getting the giggles. Every time his little body makes the sounds (you know gas) he starts to laugh, and laugh. I am trying to be serious, yeah right, next thing I know I am laughing at him. Then someone else comes in. I am like GREAT! I hear a mom and her little girl. They hear my son doing his number and laughing each time. Soon the little girl start to giggle, and then the mom too. By this time I have LOST Control and the other mom calls out. STOP laughing or else will NEVER STOP.  Her daughter was laughing and couldn't go. Anyway got it all under control. My son jumped off all excited! He did it, and made it mostly in the potty! The other mom told my son "GREAT JOB!" at least she understood. He was all proud, we go back into the restaurant and he is proclaiming he poopied. I was like "lets go!" I had to change him and quickly get out of there. I did not know it was possible for that much #2 to come out of such a little body, it still makes me laugh. I guess tonight we made a memory. Not a typical memory but one none the less. My son did a good job and we had a great laugh. Okay, don't think I am strange. Just know that it was truly funny and laugh!

      One more day of work and it's the weekend for me! I have fridays off and I love it! Lots to do this weekend. I am in charge of a huge neighborhood egg hunt. Got to do some major shopping for that. It will be fun and hey, it's not my money!  Well, honestly I try to spend at little as possible for the best stuff. Can't believe I only have a week and a half left before the hunt. Tonight we have my 2 little sisters with us. "H" is in 2nd grade and "R" is in Kinder. We are taking them to McDonalds and then to church. My mom cleans new houses part time in the evenings so we get the girls. It should be fun, my son LOVES them, he calls out there name all the time. Crazy, he wants to go to there house. Which he is there 4 days a week. Of course they are in school too. Spring break this week so he is very excited to play with them all day. By the way my son did end up sleeping all night WAHOO! Of course it was in our bed, bummer, but oh well at least we got some shut eye.

      When I got home at about 7 from a class I was suppose to have my son was up. He is SO ready to play. It is now about 9:45 and he is not the least bit interested into sleep. Maybe I will get some rest tonight, my hubby and I might have to take shifts! By the way no one was at my new ESL information meeting. I was planning to volunteer to help those in need to learn english, also hoping to improve my spanish. Very disappointed, I killed almost 2 hours after work on that side of town for the class and NO ONE was there. Kinda frustrating, I was REALLY pumped up about it too. Bummer, the leader will be hearing from me in the morning that's for sure!

      Well last night was WONDERFUL! We had such a great time. We went to a great resturant and then to see Hildago.  Great Movie too! Over dinner I shared with my husband my entry yesterday. We talked about the past 7 years and memories. It was neat to see what years stuck out in both of our minds. Then we talked about goals for the next 7 years. Where we might be and what we might be doing. It was a lot of fun and I am thankful we were able to celebrate.  Our son was out cold when we went to my mom's to pick him up. She said he didn't have a nap and that at about 7pm he just knocked out. He slept until 6AM. Nice, just talked to my hubby and he said my son is already asleep again. IT'S ONLY 5:10 PM. No nap again today. It has been very nice outside, and he has been playing very hard.  Maybe he will sleep till morning. More likely it will be 3 AM and I'll have to convince him it's still time to sleep!

      Today is the day 7 years ago I walked down the aisle to become MRS. ____. Boy, it just seems like yesterday. I had just turned 20 years old, was dreamy in love to a tall dark handsome 23 almost 24 year old man. The first year, as most newlyweds, we were so mushy in love. You know where you think you have to touch all the time. The second year we started lighting up a bit. We had a great couple to hang out with and did a lot of traveling with them. Then we all decided it was time to think about kids. We went of the pill and soon after THEY announced they were pregnant and we were not. They had there little girl while we waited. It was hard yet exciting for are good friends. They entered a new stage in life we just made ourselves busier with ministry. They moved away, still another year passes. My husband worked a lot of temp jobs, which can be very frustrating. Finally after 2 years of trying to get pregnant I went to the doctor for an UTI. Well, I did have a UTI but she also announced I was expecting. I HAD KNOW CLUE! My poor husband was waiting in the lobby. The doctor told me several times that I was indeed expecting. I still cycled for 3 months during pregnancy! I went out and told my husband I had this UTI and oh yeah...she said I am pregnant! He was like "are you serious?" I started of course to cry (hormones already going). He was so excited, he ran around the parking lot yelling. Finally we were going to have a baby. New stage of life, baby shopping, doctors visits, more visits, more visits, I got gestional diabetes, classes, classes, visits and finally it was the day. I was induced and had my little baby BOY 6 hours later. Now life is totally different. The first 5 years of are married life was way easier then with a child. But our son adds so much to our lives too. It's a good exchange. Our son is now 2 and a half years old. He loves playing with balls, and music. He plays the drums (just like dad) and the guitar anytime there is music on. Tonight we are going out to celebrate. Dinner and a movie alone! Never thought we would have to struggle for alone time, but you do. We are doing well; we might drive each other insane some days but we always manage to make it through. We have a son to raise together and NOTHING will take us apart from each other or from raising him together. I can put up with irritations; it's just part of who I am. We can deal with financial hardships and times where my husband might not have a job. Good and the Bad that's the way life is... but we have each other and someone much bigger then us to see us through.

      Crazy busy day! Had a lunch meeting after church, with some people I work with. It was fun but SOO exhausting! We ended up taking too much time and I was late for another meeting I had with a couple kids. They went home before I got there. Now I feel bad, had to cancel last week on them because of meeting, two weeks in a row. Oh well, such is life! Now it's time to go back to church, nursery duty tonight YAHOO, maybe I can sit an relax. Sometimes it's only my little boy, other times I am not that fortunate.  My son is doing better potty training today. It seems like we have been at this thing FOREVER. He does good for several days and then yesterday he had like 4 accidents! What's bad is that he knows he did wrong and he LAUGHS about it. He will come running in and say "I PEE" Great one more mess to clean up. Oh well at least to day has been accident free! YAHOO! Gotta Go for now!

      Did I tell you what my son did the other night? Probally not, noticed time has gone by. Work has been busy. Well the other night we were all 3 in my bed.(Seems to be happening a lot lately) My husband was totally out and very tired. He started to snore-- I mean really LOUD snore. I looked over at my son who is laying there looking at the ceiling. The next thing I know my son looks at me and started to make these funny snoring sounds. I looked at him and started laughing, I was like daddy's loud huh? He was like unhuh, and started making up more imitations of his daddy's snores. It was so funny, next thing I know he's got me going to. We laughed our heads off as we copied my poor husband who was in dreamland. Finally, I pushed my poor husband enough to wake him up, so we could all go to sleep. SO FUNNY! What a 2 year old will do when you least expect it

      Hey bloggers- I did it, talked my husband into buying me a computer for my anniversary! The computer we have at home was SOO sorry! Actually this latest one didn't even have a modem to connect online! I had to do everything at work, which wasn't good. SO I asked him for a computer! But of course we have to share. Right now he is sitting next to me and bothering me cuz he wants to play a new computer game. I set up our Great new system and am loving it! Gotta figure everything out of course. It will be worth it!  Now I can actually start viewing more web sites. We even got a very nice printer, I am way to excited about my new toys! I am horrible though. My poor hubby had already ordered me some way to expensive flowers, I asked him to stop the order so we could use that money to go out Monday. He was so sweet and told me about them, and stopped the order. We are going to go out for dinner and a movie instead. Much more fun then flowers! But that's just me. Looking forward to spending more time online

      This morning when my 2 year old son woke up he rolled over, smiled at me and let it rip. It like GREAT he’s only 2 and they sound like there coming from a man! What will I do when he reaches his teen years! But let me confess, it’s partly my fault. SO here comes the confession… My husband hates “wind breaking, tooting, farting, gas” or whatever you call it. I will not lie, and you shouldn’t either…we all do it. Well, sometimes I do it more then others. My motto is if you are in public you find a safe polite place, BUT if you are at home with your family you just do what you got to do. My husband can not STAND it. It makes me laugh at his reaction, and after 7 years he has adjusted somewhat. While I was pregnant it was the worst. I told my husband I was praying for a very gassy child, and then we could both go sit on his lap and fart. He was like NOOO! Well the Lord heard my ornery prayer and now it is coming back to haunt me. I HAD A BOY! What was I thinking when I said that. He listens to his dad, and he doesn’t always side on my side when we horseplay.  Such as last Saturday, (Saturday’s are the worst…we play to hard) my husband owed me several paybacks for things that I had done to him. Namely…um throwing ICE COLD WATER (Ice cubes included) over the shower curtain… etc. Well I had done that (several times- different days of course) and not got paid back until last Saturday. I had locked the door… I am not stupid. BUT my husband was pounding on the door saying he needed to use the bathroom (we only have one) so I finally say FINE and open up. Watching the hands the whole time… the minute I put down my guard- SPLASH, and as I am yelling he comes with another cup- SPLASH! Now I am like Revenge is MINE… but here is out son helping his DAD. GREAT I guess I need another child, so it will be even. (NOT YET!)  What’s funny is that he has never got me back before. He said I told too many people about him screaming like a girl and it got me. So I gotta come up with something new for the revenge…anybody got any ideas?

      Here is little information about myself. I have been married 7 years on Monday. I have a 2 ½ year old little boy and LOVE being a mom.  Last night I was coming home from work. My hubby called and asked if I could swing by and pick him up. He works downtown, and parking is horrible, his work gives out bus passes so he normal rides to work. Anyway, I almost forgot, I jumped on the interstate at the last minute and fought through traffic to get to him. I pulled up and he is all in a good mood. He says he is getting excited about our anniversary. I am like okay, he’s like what are we going to do?  We had already discussed this several times! MEN! So I patiently go over the scenario again.  We head to my mothers to pick up our son. When we arrive we find our son covered in snow and his hands are bright red. He has been playing in the snow, building a fort. I have 4 young siblings, ages 9-4, and they have been teaching him snow games.  I want to go home, and not sit around and chat. We have to get the car seat and I had asked my husband to get it on are way in. We get ready to walk out the door, and my husband jumps up from the couch where he has been sitting and is like I have to get the seat. This continues my irritation with him. He had been sitting there while I got our son all ready to go. I thought it was already done. SO I showed him some of my frustration with words. Now he is started to get irritated.  Then he drives. It’s not a good idea for him to drive when I am already irritated, especially my van. He is always picking on me about hitting corners. Guess what he hit a corner!! I couldn’t resist, comments were made… of course he claims it was snow he hit, not curb. WHATEVER! You don’t lift like we did with snow!  Then we decided we needed to get garbage bags. My husband mention a couple other things we needed to get, but it was beginning to snowing again so I was like it can wait. We ended up stopping at a Family Dollar which is very close to our house. My husband pulled into to parking place and hit the curb with the tires. Remember I’m irritated,  NOT a good move! So I get out to get the garbage bags, and to check out the front of my van, giving him the evil eye the whole time. UNTIL, WHAM it happens, I fell straight down on my butt. It was like my guardian angel saying “Stop being SOO Mean!”  I was of course embarrassed, my husband is looking at me trying not to laugh. I am mad, hurt, and humbled. I stood up slowly, I could feel that a trip to the chiropractor would be necessary. I crawled back to the van, opened the door and told him he could go get them, I wanted to go home! (This was a bad idea) My poor husband wonders into the store with NO IDEA where the stupid bags are, I can see him in the window, back and forth, back and forth. Finally he comes out, he is now upset, and I am just plain GRUMPY! He tells me that I am irritating him, finally we are on the same page. I tell him “fine I won’t say anything” (yeah right, look at this entry, I am a talker).  As we pull into the drive I noticed where I had shoveled earlier in the day had melted to the rocks. My husband guns the van up the drive, which probably wasn’t necessary, so I made a little comment about the rocks flying, and opps, he went from irritated to plan mad. Needless to say, last night was not a good night, he always apologizes to fast. You know when your still to mad, and you KNOW it was mostly your fault anyway!  My husband hardly EVER gets mad. He is a very calm natured person, and very slow (he’s from the south) which is what sometimes gets to me. I am a on the go, lets do it now, type person.  I sometimes feel bad for the poor man. He puts up with me! But I guess that’s what part of Love is…putting up with each other even on the grumpy days!

      Well, I am finally doing it... writing a post. I have been checking out several sites for several months now and have been a silent observer. I am taking the plunge!  I think this is a cool way to express feelings and life happenings. I am a very busy person so I will do my best to keep my entries current.  SNOW, that's what I see outside my window. Lots, and lots of SNOW. I thought it was almost spring. I really want it to be spring. I like it to be light out when I come home from work. I am able to accomplish SOO much more. When it is dark it feels like I have to go home to do the basics and go to bed. Spring will come someday, after 16 inches of snowfall go away.

      WARNING WHAT I AM ABOUT TO SHARE MAY BE HARMFUL TO YOUR HEALTH! EXPERIENCED WOMEN WILL UNDERSTAND!  Okay so I wake up Wednesday am with my son throwing up in MY bed. You know the feeling, when you are sleeping and you think "I think he is throwing up?" so you sit up still sleeping, grab the garbage pail and stuff it under his mouth. STILL IN THE DARK, can't tell where the mouth is but somehow you get it. SO HUSBAND WAKE UP! Finally after saying his name 3 times my husband comes to and hits the lights! It could have been worse... let's just say I am sure glad there was no left  overs in the fridge for lunch the next day!  SO I then realized that it's on me, and all over my little boy. So I take him to the Bathroom. Let me just say, this is the first time my son has been old enough to realize what was happening, and he didn't like it. (FLU SHOTS WORK GREAT) I then try to convince my son to do what is necessary in the toilet... yeah right! He tries to swallow (SORRY), which totally grosses me out. I am like yucky, spit it out. ANYWAYS 3 rounds, while my husband, bless his heart, cleaned up the bed. I stayed home from work the next day. Gave my son a bucket to do his duty in. Mistake #2, he doesn't want to go in the bucket either! (AHH!) He ate just 2 bites of dry toast and some water, needless to say it ended up on the living room floor. Where was the bucket you ask? In my son's hand "my bucket" was all he said... no yucky allowed in it I guess.  I had been on the phone to my Mom, needing a little encouraging. SO while I am running him to the bathroom, (I had drop the phone in the process!) I went and told her "can't talk bye" Ran back to the bathroom and GREAT... the diarrhea! Remember last journal? Standing at the potty... doing his duty all over the floor. By then I am like.... DEEP BREATH I can do this. One mess at a time! I did survive, and was thankful when someone told me... at least you only had one child to deal with. THANK YOU GOD!  I commend all of you parents with more then one child, and pray you don't have a day like mine.

      Okay so it's been awhile again since I have updated. Maybe it's cuz I am too busy or nothing exciting has been happening to journal about. I am horrible I admit. Love to journal, hate too. It's a win/lose case.  Okay pass the complaining. I had a good Birthday we had a blast at HuHot grill. It was definitely an experience. This past weekend was good. I would say we did a lot of fellowshiping. We had 2 couples over for games and pizza Friday. I have realized that sometimes I want to invite a bunch of new people to do things. (I am VERY SOCIAL) Anyway, we have the regular group of friends, the one's we  have been doing stuff with for years. Then we all grow up and some of them don't. I find that we are the only one in the group with a small child (minus one single mom with twin 5 year olds). Anyway, all of a sudden, I want to hang out with new people. I love my group of friends, don't get me wrong. I just want to hang out with some other people sometimes. I think my group is thinking I am snobby or something. The last two weekends we have been invited to play games and we have not gone. We had already made plans with other people. I felt kinda bad, but then found out they were up until 3 in the AM. Parents can't do that! Plus we all used to go out to lunch every Sunday. Well, it is easier with a two year old (who needs a nap) to go home and eat. SO we didn't go to lunch yesterday with them either. After the PM service we went with some young parents to McDonalds and had the most fun.  I don't know, I guess it's all part of life and that we will have to balance it somehow. I like to plan ahead; they do things with a call that day. I feel OLD!  My son is still struggling with poopie. My mom called the other day and was like "um Brandie your son pooped all over the floor… 7 piles(thanks for the details mom) and I walked in and he was picking it up and putting it in the toilet." I said at least he was trying to clean it up. She said "when I got after him he started to cry and put his HANDS in his mouth!" Great is all I kept thinking… he likes to stand and pee, he doesn't want to sit on the toilet, he wants to stand and poop too! PRAY for my sanity, at least he doesn't poop everyday, so I have some breaks! Poopie STINKS!

      Okay- I have been told to update! I have been SOO busy. I worked on the computer all Friday and wanted to do an entry... but good thing I didn't cuz I barely had time to do all that needed to be done. We had our Spring Bash. This is a big event I plan for kids 1st thru 6th grade. It's an overnighter, and a lot of work. But I can honestly say everything went off without a hitch. There were 79 of us in attendance, and we had a blast. We first went to a middle school gym for games, then to the church for pizza, and finally to the skating rink for a private party. I got all of them asleep about 3 am. Did I sleep?? Yeah right, everything kept going through my head, I couldn't sleep for anything. Plus the hard floor didn't help much either! So the rest of the weekend I spent trying to catch up and get ready for my trip.  I leave in the morning for Springfield, MO. I haven't been there for several years and am planning to have a great time. I am attending a children's conference. (yes, it seems my life is filled with conferences lately) I will be gone until Saturday and unable to be online during that time- unless the hotel has connections. I plan to soak up all the information and to relax- hey, this is pretty much an all expense paid vacation. I will miss my husband and son though. I have never been that far away for this long a time. I have been preparing them both for my trip. Not sure my 2 year old gets it yet, but he will. Tonight I have to finish packing and go to infant swim. We want to have at least an hour of family time before I leave. My husband is unable to attend, due to his job being fairly new. This weekend we didn't have much family time, so I plan on enjoying there company tonight. I will try to write if I can. Hope all is well in your neighborhood.

      It is a beautiful Saturday! Yesterday it hit 87 and I live in the MIDWEST! I had to turn the air on in my car. Here I am thinking....what am I going to do today. My husband is still gone until later tonight. It's just me and my son. I went and bought a new television this morning. However, it's to big for me to carry in the house, so now I feel like the van is not usable. I am tempted to go get the car at the church. My husband birthday is tomorrow and I got him the TV. It's a 33 inch. We have been using a 19 inch the last 7 years, so this is going to be a big change! Now I am going to shop for a entertainment center, uh- I forgot to measure the hole in ours and it's not big enough! (BUMMER!) Oh well maybe I can find one for a decent price!  My son is into saying good bye to everything. Like when he flushes his pee or poppy he yells BYE PEE/POPPY! My father just made him a rocking horse and now he has to give it a kiss and tell it by before we leave the house. He also is finally realizing that when I say OW I mean it really hurt. Like an elbow is the eye is not funny. Yesterday we were rough housing and opps he hit me hard. My son was like "you okay mama?" and then he started to kiss my head where he hit me. It was so cute! Then he hurt himself and had to kiss it too. I don't think I taught him that, must have been my mom. I am just thankful he is realizing that I don't like it when he hits me (even on accident) in the face. I guess it just shows me my little boy is growing up!

      WAHOO! The mouse is dead! (feels funny celebrating death- but YAHOO!) Tuesday night my husband wakes me up to say Cali (our cat) has the mouse. It's like almost 1 in the morning. I was like Great- roll over to sleep. NOO- he had to give me every detail. He says- do you think I better shut the bedroom door- she's playing with it- OF COURSE! Then I hear him talking to the cat, encouraging her not to lose it. I was honestly thinking- can't wait to get online worry free again! She finally put it out of it's misery. I AM SO EXCITED!  I went to work and guess what, the dsl was down! I was SOO bummed out. It still was out today, but should be up soon. I kept saying I want to go home and get online. So here I am FINALLY! We had a busy couple days at work, getting ready for a big conference. I am glad I don't work tomorrow. Me and my friend are going on a girls night out. Can't wait- my husband will be at the conference. We are thinking about seeing 50 First Dates...anybody see it? Wondering how nasty Adam Sandler is going to be in this one. We are wanting to see a funny stress free film. Any suggestions?

      Okay, it’s been way to long since I have done an entry. I must confess, Saturday evening I was starting an entry and my pesky mouse made an appearance. I asked my husband just to turn the computer off, that I wasn't going back over there! Of course the cats came in and went straight over there. We are hopeful the pitiful thing will lose its life soon, or just leave my house. I have a major problem with those types of things, and am not trying to be offensive in anyway!  This entry may get lengthy because it's been awhile. I went to the chiropractor on Friday. I had never been before, but knew I needed to go. He found several problems, and boy did I feel better afterwards. My hip is already back out, and I honestly have to say I am sorer since it popped out of place. I go back tonight and am hopeful I will be less sore this time. Swim class is also tonight, so maybe the warm water pool will do my body some good.  We had a great Easter. Saturday we went to my mom's house and had a hunt. My son got really into it this year. He picked up to many, and we had to put some back out in the yard for the other kids. He was running and grabbing like crazy. My mom had hid a basket and my son was so cute. I helped him see it, and he whispered "it's mine?" I said yep and he ran over and grabbed it out of the bucket it was in. He was ALL excited running around with it.  He didn't want to wake up on Easter Sunday. We kept telling him that their are eggs everywhere, he didn't care. Finally he agreed to go cuddle with me on the couch while dada got them. (We had church to hurry for) When we went into the living room, he started to wake up real fast. We had fun watching him pick up the eggs. He wanted to open every one of them and touch to thing inside, and then close it back in there. We got him cars, and little dogs...not a lot of candy. The other hunts provided enough. We then went to my Grandma's house for lunch and yet another hunt. (BOY am I glad Easter is over!) He got several outfits and several eggs. We had a good time and my son jumped on the trampoline for hours. We were all very tired when we left there at 6pm. We went home and took a nap. Usually we don't take naps that late in the day, but we were tired. My son did not get back up, I tried to wake him up at 8pm but he just kept falling back to sleep. He slept until 7:30 this morning. My husband and I watched "Good Boy" which if we new our son was going to be sleeping; we would have rented something else. It was a cute family movie, silly but fun. I know my son will enjoy it.

      Is it Tuesday already?? Can hardly believe the days are going by so fast! I love it that it's light out at 8:00!  Well I survived the weekend. Sunday the kids in church drove me crazy with those branches! I wanted to tell them to throw them away- but didn't think the lady that bought them would like that to much! They got them before my class- so that means they were using them as swords for fights, smacking each other with them- and ALL SORTS OF other annoying stuff! SO being the GREAT teacher that I am- when they came in for my class, I made them all put them along the back wall- and NOT TOUCH THEM! I did use some of them to adlib part of the lesson- but NO BOYS GOT TO HOLD THEM UNTIL THE END! Phew! Sunday was crazy, I had to be back at church at 3 which only gave me 2 1/2 hours at home. I then skipped evening service (SHH!) to go to dinner with my sister and family for her birthday. She is 22 now- crazy! My dad and other sister were there. It was fun- kinda, we went to a chinese buffet that was CROWDED! My husband missed the dinner- he had to play drums at service. But my son and I went. One thing that is weird is my dad's new girlfriend has 3 boys! My dad didn't want anymore kids, (he has us 3 girls- the youngest 21), and that is one of the excuses my mother uses for leaving him. I like this women though- just strange seeing my dad with 3 young boys- I think they are like between 7-12 years old. I don't even know all there names. They have been dating since before Thanksgiving and I have met them 2 times! Hoping to get to know them better this Sunday at my grandma's for Easter. (Hmm... wonder if I should buy them something??)  Last night we had infant swim- last week it got canceled. My son had a blast, and my sister has my niece in the class too. My niece is 3 1/2 and was SOO funny- she didn't want to get her hair wet. When the teacher dunked her in the water- she screamed and cried "my hair!" My son had fun- still trying to get him to kick his legs and move his hands at the same time- but that would mean he would have to let go from me or dad. He did go under water several times, and jumped in to the pool- to us. Not bad for first class again- since January.  My son is trying all sorts of new things out- like he doesn't want to come home at night from my mom's. So he throws a bloody fit. The other night he got mad at my husband and began to count "1, 2, " (we count to three) I was like great! Tonight my mom stopped by- bad move. My son had a fit leaving there and here she comes knocking at my door. Of course my son wants to go- my mom's young kids are in the car! So my son went with her- I ran to Target and bought some Easter stuff (FUN!) I went over there at 8:30 to get him and he was all in pj's ready to stay the night. It's a school nite, my mom is like, he's attached (I am thinking- HE"S MY KID). Once in a while is fine- but I don't want him to get in a habit of staying over night every night. (My niece does that to my grandma- it's annoying!) Anyway- he wouldn't give me a kiss or hug- he wanted the kids. Finally at 9:30 he decided he wanted to go home. I was glad- I only get him for like 4 hours in the evening on M-Thurs. and I like to spend time with him. Do you think I am being to harsh? He was over last Friday nite- didn't stay the night, but the weekend before he did, and after this weekend he gets too, we have a conference to attend. I think moderation is good, just afraid I might be overreacting, a little. Oh, well time for bed.

      Tonight I am tired. I had a fun filled day. Started out with the hunt. It was cloudy and windy cold! (thanks a lot weather guy!) We got to the park at 8 am and boy was it cold! we bundled all up. People had gloves on to put out the eggs. I thought- something is wrong with this picture! The sun came out, but the wind didn't stop by 10 am when the kids came. Over all it was a Blast! Their wasn't as many kids as last year (and it rained then) but all the kids left with bags full of candy. My helpers were terrific! We started at 10 and were packed up and ready to go by 10:40. I didn't do any of the work- except oversee everything, and blow the whistle. It was wonderful- go volunteers! I'd say the Hunt is the easiest activity I have ever done.  My grandma took my son home after the hunt. We unloaded at the church, and went home for a nap. Which didn't last to long- but gave me a boast. We took a little boy out to a Fun Center (video games etc). He won a contest we had a few weeks ago- and this was his prize- his choice. SO 2 1/2 hours of chasing my son (grandma dropped him off) and playing games. That in itself is a need for a nap. Anyway, it was fun and the boy had a blast. He kept saying this was one of the funnest days. Egg hunt, and video games. He felt pretty special which is good, he needs that, his family recently filed for divorce.  I have been working on my lesson all night. I have to add something in for Palm Sunday. They got Palms branches to give to the kids, which I just found out about, and have to figure out something to do with! Top is all off we SPRING Ahead tonight! AHH- one less hour of sleep to add to my tiredness.  My husband keeps yelling for me to come watch the new Funniest Home Video Show- it has my son entertained too so it must be good. I keep hearing them laugh, so I guess I will finish up what I must and go have some family time. Night all!

      It's Friday nite and I just got home from a big event my husband has been working on. It is called the 3 band night. My husband and some others have been planning this since Jan. They got the bands, the sponsors, and a lot of food donated. It is an outreach to teenagers- 3 bands and food for FREE! SO tonight is the big night! He is so PUMPED UP! They really are having a terrific turnout, at least 200 kids. That was the goal. When I left they were jumping around yelling, so I'd say it's a hit. My son loves music and was very popular with the youth. He had his guitar and was jammin down the aisle. All the kids were watching. Then my son thought he was big stuff, started walking around giving teenage boys HI FIVES. I was following close behind, he pushed me away! I guess I was cramping his style! GOOD GRIEF! The guy in charge even said his name up front, and told the kids to check him out! They did and my son came home zonked out. This thing won't get done till 2 am or so after its all cleaned up. SO we came home. We have a big morning ahead and I want to be alert! The EGGHUNT day will finally arrive. Everything is packed in the van. The signs, the stakes, the eggs- I still have to make a sign (if I can) and pick up bags at the store in the morning, for those kids who forget to bring something to put the goodies in. Today was busy, but yet relaxed. I had done a good job at trying to spread things out this time. I even had time to put my budget together on this computer and get my son's haircut! It is SOO cute by the way. Another reason he thinks he's a stud muffin. Now that he's 2 1/2 we had to do a style. I even bought stuff to put in his hair. (I am a stucker I no) Now his hair sticks up in front- only in front through. Like the big boys. How come kids grow up so fast?! Not sure if I like it!  Well that is my day in a nutshell. Gonna visit a few sites and hit the hay. Hope you have a great weekend!

      April Fool's Day! One of my favorite days. I get an excuse to play tricks on friends! Yeah, I had fun! The gals at work were thankful the hours were over today. They began to get jumpy on me. I made sure there phones were unhooked, printers unplugged. I even volunteered to pick up lunch and brought them back only part of there orders. (The rest was in my van) I taped one poor girls coat sleeves closed- that didn't work good though, it was 57 degrees out and she didn't put it on! (BUMMER) I was busy thinking all day! One of my friends came up with covering the bottoms of the computer mouses with labels that said "APRIL FOOLS" I got in on that and had a blast.  My husband has lost his cell phone and needs me to get off line to call it! Sorry guys, I can't even say I took it as a joke. So my entry will be short tonight.  Hope you took the time and energy to enjoy this FUN day- share with me your pranks!

      Today I feel that  I got the most done I have in a long time. I cleaned out my garage (which looks better then when we moved in), my front porch, living room, bathtub and am almost done with my son's room. I am planning on cleaning the basement, and the rest of the house Monday. SO much for a day off! I am planning on having a garage sale next weekend, and am quite excited. It is making me clean like a mad women.  Last night we went to the movies and ended up seeing "Sherk 2". I was VERY impressed- esp. cuz I didn't even like the first one! We were suppose to be meeting a bunch of friends to see "The Day after Tomorrow" but when we got there it was SOLD out! We figured if we went to Sherk they should be out about the same time. WRONG- we left the movie and here are all are friends standing in line to go to the 10. They didn't get tickets in time for the sell out either. SO they convinced us to go to the 10 also. My 2 year old was with us! I will have to say he did pretty good. He was great at the first movie, but drank to much and had to go potty like 15 times during the second!!  OH my nightmare came true! We were in Walmart yesterday with my sister and niece. We ran out of room in the cart and let the kids out- BAD move. When we FINALLY caught them, I put my son in the cart. He started wailing, and then all of a sudden said, MAMA PEE PEE BAD! and then it happened...right there...and he was wearing cotton short, so it didn't hold much! I was like STOP!! Luckily a worker was walking past and I was able to grab him, and my sister was there to stay with the dripping cart. We rushed half way across the store to clean up. IT was NOT FUN! But I survied, it was the first accident in a public place. I guess I can say I can stop worrying about it happening because it did.

      We have been having crazy weather here. Storms, storms, storms! I feel like we are living in the basement. Last night I came home to the tornado sirens going off yet again. This is the third time in the past week! So off we go, at least we have a television and couch down there. But all the lighting means I can’t turn on the computer! The forecast is for clear dry weather YEAH! Maybe some of the flooding will go away.  I had my tooth worked on Friday. It is still throbbing! Part of my molar had broken off so I now have my first temporary cap with plans for a root canal! YUCKY! I hate having work done on my teeth- that’s why it broke off. It’s been at least 7 years since I have gone. I do think I found a good one this time. Scary!  I started watching my eating and cutting back. I am going off the weight watcher plan. Today has been the hardest. I think the reason I need to lose weight is that whenever I think about food I eat. Even if I am not hungry. Like right now, I am not hungry, yet I know that there are chocolate brownies upstairs and so I want one. I have not had one, and I WILL NOT GIVE IN TO THE TEMPTATION!  I brought to work lots of healthier chocolate things knowing it was someone’s birthday. HMM somehow it hasn’t worked in my mind. My stomach is saying your fine, but it the mind power I have to overcome. Sound crazy? I do need to take off some weight and I am not using up points on a brownie. There, now that’s out in the open.  I didn’t want ANYONE to know I was watching what I ate, but you know me and my big mouth! Anyway, I had to express this so now I did. If I lose weight I will let you know otherwise DON”T ASK :)

      Well we just got back from Florida. Florida you say…was that planned? NO, my husband’s grandma passed away last Wednesday. We both were like, what do we do. She had been ill for a while now. We ended up running around, getting stuffed packed. Then we found out the funeral would be Friday- so on the plane we went Thursday evening. Those days are a blur. It was nice to meet a lot of the family, just stinks under those circumstances. We ended up staying until Monday night.  My son actually rode the horses this time at his great aunt’s house. He loved it! He rode as someone led of course. (He’s only 2) This is the first time he was old enough to understand flying. The last time we flew was before he hit 2. (Full fare price) Now that he is almost 3 he loved it- he kept saying “go high mama”. He did good, esp. with it being late night travel, we ended are flights after midnight both times.  I still didn’t get to see a gator. OH Well- next time we are going for fun. The one thing that was nice is it forced us to go, we weren’t planning a trip until Christmas again, Grammie and Papa (my in-laws) didn’t like that idea very much. We were able to visit with them and my husbands siblings and there families. Glad to be back home. Not expecting anymore sudden trips. I am going to try to rest over Memorial Day weekend. My teeth are hurting today, I see the dentist tomorrow. Hopefully he can help that. We are taking a bunch of kids to the zoo Saturday. (I know we are crazy) Maybe I will have time to get my house in order and do up all that laundry! I am beginning to go nuts in all the clutter. Bye for now, I will do better I promise!

      Okay- you might ask WHERE YOU BEEN?? Well like the rest of you I have been busy- too busy to turn on the computer. Actually my son gets upset when I play with the computer instead of him, and he had really bad mommy withdraws after I came home from Springfield. SO I had to take a break. I sure have missed my entries! There is so much to tell it’s going to take a few entries to catch up.  Right now I want to complain about something! If you are watching two children one is 2 the other 3 and you know it nap time… do you A. let the 3 year old go outside and play with an adult while the 2 year old cries and screams?  B. make them both lay down to rest? or C. let them both go play? Okay- to me B or C is acceptable.  But A. is what happened to my son. I wonder if I lead the person to believe that he HAD to have a nap. Oh well, nothing I can do about it now. I am thankful that this person could watch my child on short notice. Last night at are last swim class a girl got hurt. Her little brother jumped on her head- from the side of the pool and gave her the WORST bloody nose. I had never seen a child bleed that much from the nose! My son kept pointing to his nose the rest of the night and would say “OHWEE” it really bothered him. I think it bothered me too! YUCKY!  This past weekend we went to Chucky Cheese and out to see the movie “Mean Girls” (interesting movie- good- but interesting) I took my friend C out, we had fun and my son loved it! My husband was at yet another retreat! He asked me Sunday what we had to do this weekend- I told him not much- he said good cuz the last 4 weekends he has been at overnighters. One he did at our house with the guys when I was out of town- but the rest were big deals.  My conference was exciting. I learned a lot- almost overloaded. I am still trying to absorb all the cool stuff I was taught. We started in classes at 8:30 had a lunch break- on site- more classes- finally dinner break- which wasn’t long enough- then back for service at 7 till 9:30 or later. It was tiring but a good time. Glad to be back, trying to get back into the groove.

      This past week was are Family Crusade. It was a lot of fun, but I am sure glad it's over. Every night this week we have only been home for a short time. We are also buying a new home right now and what do you know- the mortgage lady called and asked if we wanted to move the close date up a couple days. SO the last two days I have began the packing! At first I didn't think I had that much but now after 10 big boxes I feel like this might take a little more TIME. We are not planning on moving until the 4th even if we get the keys on the 27th. This is are first new home. We have rented for the past 7 years! My son turns 3 on Tuesday, I have just started planning the party. I know I am a little late. I still have to find time to buy his pinata' and his Spiderman Bike! We have been telling him all summer that on his birthday he could have that bike. Of course this week isn't the BEST week to buy it financially, but OH WELL- he would be too disappointed, so we will get it for him. (okay don't say spoiled- 3 months of waiting is along time!)

      This past week has been crazy I made one call and the next thing I know we are out looking to buy a house. We looked at like 10 of them, of course in my mind they became one big house at the end of the day. Right near the end of our search we found it- the house. So now we are in the process of buying it. It is way bigger then the house we currently rent. We have a 2 bedroom house this is a 4 bedroom! This new house also has a 4 - seasons porch and a skylight in the bathroom. Major perks for me! And my husband like the 2 car garage too. ANYWAY it’s nerve racking- are stuff is at the underwriters and should be out on Mon. 2 years ago we began this journey and back out of a bad deal. Plus wow, this house is WAY better then that one. But still I just keep waiting for them to say HA- you can’t have it. We have already been pre-approved, but I really don’t trust that. So we are waiting, and waiting.  Not only are we buying this house we are selling are 2nd car too. My husband has been blessed with a company truck, so are 2nd car just sits in the drive most of the time. So tonight we have to get that all cleaned up and hopefully sell it to this sweet lady in the church. THEN we gave are notice to are landlord, and he wants to bring people through as early as uhhh-NEXT WEEK! So this weekend it is CLEAN CRAZY! Closets, the rest of the basement, garage everywhere. YUCK!  Oh and wait this weekend we kick off one of the biggest events of my year! A FAMILY CRUSADE! Yep Sun-Wed nights we have services with me making sure everything runs smoothly. So I also have to –this weekend - go shopping for the final supplies!  I honestly have know idea HOW this is all going to get accomplished but I am sure going to work my tail off to do it!  My father and I talked this past weekend and I got suckered into watching his pup. He is a Chinese Sheir pei who is really quite a good dog. He likes to sleep in our bed which is SO annoying. We kick him out of course, but last night he wouldn't stop yelping and barking until we opened the door! This dog is way stuck on my hubby. He follows him EVERYWHERE. He won't even let me walk him unless my husband is right there next to him. But THANK Heavens the doggie goes home this weekend! My son and husband are WAY too attached. My son continues to say “mama ask papa jimmy if we can buy it?” I am like NOOOO!!  Any more exposure could be bad for us! Bye, bye,  “buddy” (that’s the dog’s name)

      Okay- so I have not been remembering to journal. SORRY Summer is SOO busy, I hardly turn the computer on, except at work.We just got done with camps around here, so I have been quite busy with data entry.  When fall comes I will do a lot better. Just a quick update... hmm let's see... this summer I spent a week at camp with 4-6th graders, we got some new furiture, so we have been rearranging, and I have lost 36 pounds. Camp was a blast, hardly any sleep but the services were awesome. I had a peanut butter facial, and had to put my face in flour to get bubble gum. (I WON the one) All were new experiences for me, but of course the kids LOVED it, so it was worth it. New furiture was a blessing, didn't realize my sofa was that bad! We didn't have to pay a penny either which was even cooler. My husband's job has proven great benefits once again. We not only got a sofa but an intable, book cabinet and a couple other things. I have added walk and watching to my life. I try to walk at least 4 times a week 2 1/2 miles and I watch closely what I food I intake. I have been doing this for 12 weeks tomorrow and have lost 36 pounds. WOHOO! I have also been blessed with a coworker losing weight, so she is giving me great hand me downs. I feel like a kid again! No I really have loved it. My job requires me to wear skirts or dresses, which is fine but when you lose weight those cost a little bit more. Plus I plan to lose a lot more... and I don't want to buy much until I hit my goal. SO it's great to have hand me downs.  My son is growing like crazy. He will be 3 this month. He is all about spiderman. We plan on getting him a Spiderman bike and the little guy has been waiting all summer for his birthday. If you say what do you want for your birthday it is a spiderman bike. The other day he very cutely said "mama can I have 2 presents?" he then said "spiderman bike and bob" He also likes Bob the builder. It was so cute. Of course his party will be Spiderman this year, it's not like it's everywhere! HA! We actually took him to see the movie.. it had a couple violent scenes which when we covered his eyes he fought us. He enjoyed it just as much as we did. CRAZY!  Little kids pick up on things. My 1st cousin is being sent to Iraq on the 18th and we had his going away party Sunday. He will be gone for 18-24 months. My son and I have now began praying at bedtime for him. When we get to his name I tell my son he's in the army and he promptly responds "fight hard?" and I say "yeah he's going to go fight" and then he says "he die?" and I say "no, that's why we are praying for him" We play army men all the time and he always has men that die... so when we pray for my cousin he puts fighting and dieing together. Of course his guys jump back up in 2 seconds after dieing but then again that's a 2 year old.
