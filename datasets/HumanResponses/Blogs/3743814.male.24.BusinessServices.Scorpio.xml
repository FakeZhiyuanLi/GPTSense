      I was chatting with my good friend Tanya today. I haven't spoken to her in quite some time. I've severely missed her and am so very glad that I got the chance to contact her. She said that the weather was like uber horrible and then five minutes later the sun popped out and the weather was goergous again just like that... she said she knew there had to be some kind of meaning because she then saw two rainbows and I immediately called. Talk about coincidences. Talk about Aloha! LOL!

      I currently have a "Live Journal" but had not given the whole 'blog' thing a go so here it is. I'll start off by telling you a little about me and the rest will come in time.  I'm a 24 year old white male who was born in a po-dunk town called Lugoff, South Carolina. I grew up pretty much being raised by my grandmother (Nonnie) until I moved in with my dad (her son) during high school.. well, that's not totally true because I lived with my dad off and on throughout my childhood and teenage years but, you get the point. I came out of the closet as being homosexual when I was 17 years old and when I graduated high school I went right to college and lived out of my car due to the fact that my family and I weren't exactly on speaking terms (see coming out of the closet in the sentence above.) I did a semester in college and reenrolled for another semester but ended up going to Jail for "Minor in posession of alcohol" because I was crashing with a friend one night, when I finally found a place to stay for the night instead of the waffle house, and she threw a party. I wasn't even drinking! I was asleep! but the cops came in and busted the party, I did 30 days, got dropped from all of my classes and proceeded to Kentucky for Job Corps. I did my time at Job Corps and got a little experience in computers, though it's not really anything to brag about. I then went in the Army and was officially enrolled for almost 4 years. That in itself is a long story and we won't even go there... but we will say that I did NOT get out by saying I'm gay, and I got out in good standing.. well mostly. I then met what I thought was the most wonderful man in the entire world who I gave a huge chunk of my life to, and the whole of my heart to, and then my hand as we exchanged rings. We were together for almost 4 years when he decided it would be a good time, since he was over seas with the navy, to cheat on me. Needless to say, we're not together anymore. I then moved back to SC, ended up in a bad relationship and my really good friend from online, Kim, came and rescued me. I now live in Norfolk Virigina with her and her husband and kids. I have beome intergrated into their family and would absolutely do anything for her, or her family. It really sucks being single but I think I'm starting to realize how important it is for me to remain single for a little while until I can learn to love myself enough to be okay being single. I've got a pretty good job, which I love, will be getting my own place soon, and things are really looking up. I do intend to write more but right now, soup's on and it's time for some grub after a long day at work ;) More later!
