      FREEZING!!!! Tonight we ascend upon the  urlLink St. Paul Winter Carnival Ice Palace ... both very exciting for me and admittedly in these economic times of budget cuts and layoffs a huge waste of money... I've never seen an ice palace before and this is the first one in 12 years. I remember being a little girl living in North Dakota and my parents had a brand new calendar up on the wall... January - the first month of the year - was adorned with a huge sparkling picture of the Ice Palace in St. Paul. I was enthralled - I thought it was the coolest thing I had ever seen. Tonight I'll be standing out in the cold - bitter bitter January cold - volunteering at the Ice Palace.   And for those crazy for Friends spoilers... the  urlLink best  happen to be over at  urlLink The Morning News ...    urlLink Happy Year of the Monkey ! I was born in a year of the monkey.... i guess that means i'm special or something right?  This Sunday we're having a little Johnny-Depp-A-Thon at Maria's (i haven't seen Pirates of the Caribbean yet)... another fabulous reason to watch that movie...  urlLink Orlando Bloom   Also...   ITS REALLY FREAKING COLD HERE!!! (did i mention 5 layers of clothes and i'm still inside???)

       urlLink here . this is an incredibly interesting email interview with David Eggars. I will admit that I did not read much of the first part of the questions/interview (i scanned) because I was directed to it through  urlLink rex  through someone else on the topic of selling out... the rant on selling out is so right on though... right on.   also there is a new pizza place we should check out soon...  urlLink SPOKES ... its located in the seward cafe and only open on thursday and friday evenings from 6pm-1am. and i guess they do delivery too - on bike... must have felt that the new seward location of pizza luce needed a little  urlLink coop competition ...   and this  urlLink phone thing ... just bizarre...

      New Job News:::>  Day 2 was shorter and seemed more frantic than Day 1.  Had to run  out of my first site manager meeting to plug the parking meter, but wasn't the only one to do so.   I feel so overwhelmed trying to digest all the information and protocol, but moreover, incredibly overjoyed that my supervisor is actually cool.  And not just cool in comparison to previous awful bosses, but legitimately a wonderful person.  She's completely scattered and disorganized, which for now makes me chuckle--but will it drive me nuts after a week?  I'm hoping A, that it won't, and B, that after a week or two of my assistance she will be far better organized.  ((And let's note that it is A and B, not A and 2.  Or 1 and B for that matter)).    Sad Things:::>  Finally watched Whale Rider---it's been sitting in the apartment for weeks---and enjoyed it.  Though some parts I feel could have been explained further, but that little Keisha Castle-Hughes was darned compelling.  I almost cried.  Following the movie-watching, spent the latter part of yesterday evening yelling at the radio with the Dean-atic roommate.  She probably did some crying herself later on, but hopefully the hour we spent ranting and shouting obscenities at the voices of Kerry, Edwards, and Gephardt (goodbye little Dicky) allowed her sufficient venting opportunities.

      big news...  urlLink Katherine Lanpher  stepped down today as host of MPR's Midmorning. I guess I missed the announcement - I was late to work this morning and was therefore able to listen to the first half of midmorning... still no word from our insider on her behavior at recent annual work party...   in more personal related (and admittedly somewhat boring) news:  Ifinished  urlLink Dune  last night. The last third of the book was actually quite good, and overall I enjoyed the concept - innovative ways of coping with/transforming your surroundings, prophesies, advanced body/mind control, and rebellion. However Frank Herbert needed an editor so bad that I was forced to take frequent breaks from reading. Now I want to rent the movie and see if that clears anything up for me (don't get me wrong - the book wasn't confusing) but I'd like to see some sort of condensed version.   Also started  urlLink Life of Pi , interesting so far. Learning a lot about zoos.   Watched Average Joe last night... i really like that tattooed ocd boy... so cute! the new hunks seem just obnoxious... its making me nervous.   Sunday night was  urlLink Heiruspecs  at  urlLink rockrockrock  and next week is  urlLink Coach Said Not To  at the Kellar Bar...

      forget magnets... we need to pick up some more marbles and start doing  urlLink necklaces ... genius!   urlLink this site  is also pretty cool... i've been wanting to learn how to stencil for a while... i figure its something that could enhance the sewing and other projects i do already...    also...  urlLink go Brazil!  i don't see why U.S. world travelers shouldn't be treated the same as our government is treating our world guests... did you forget the golden rule?

      if you are one of the masses that does in fact watch tv - although a lot of us claim to be above its hypnotic stare - i hope to god that you did not watch the simple life reunion show. that’s all i have to say about it. i also cannot tell you how many hours of television i watched last night because a) it was quite a lot and 2) it is quite embarrassing.  i did finish reading a christmas present as well though - Bachelor Girl by Betsy Isreal - a look at single women through the twentieth century - very interesting at some points, a bit repetitive at others...   in other news... 50cent cans of tomato soup make for a damn fine lunch. as do walking past the cute auditor who i am hoping takes another week after this to finish all the work audit stuff or whatever it is they do. as for things that do not - filling out one's college alumni registration, and chatting with a certain coworker.

      a) the triple rock has redesigned their  urlLink website  to include food, photos, and more great info  2) i was at the triple rock last night for the greatest show i almost missed. Dre Day 2004. The second annual celebration of the life of Andre Young - yesterday was his 39th birthday. This great celebration was put on by the crazy skater boys at  urlLink life sucks die magazine  and had incredible music sets by  urlLink heiruspecs  and the entire  urlLink rhymesayers  crew. It also featured the return of the $20 sack pyramid. Heiruspecs took the stage to do some great Dre and Snoop Dogg covers. Muad'ib sounding especially impressive with the Snoop vocals. After a short break Heiruspecs band got back on stage and was shortly joined by Eyedea, Felipe from Los Nav, Brother Ali, Slug, I-Self, Musab and probably some others that I really shouldn't be forgetting right now, for some great freestyle to the back beat of Dre produced tunes. It was a great time. We were dancing, there were 40s, and there was some camera guy who edged himself right in front of me for much of the freestyle. For me giving up a little bit of my front and center I better be seeing those photos in a full page glossy national magazine spread...  As for now... the ink isn't washing off the back of my hand, I hung my little Dre Day poster (that I took off the entrance to the 3rock) proudly in my cube (i've gotten quite a few positive comments on it already), I'm daydreaming of the most beautiful guy in Minneapolis who was also snapping quite a few photos at the show last night, and I should probably get some more sleep. Next year I'm taking the morning after Dre Day off.

      When I was in elementary school in North Dakota a friend of mine and I made up alternate words to this song in the hopes of making some sort of small fortune off of the sales to other fourth and fifth graders…  Unfortunately our genius was not nearly that of  urlLink billy joel’s … thanks to  urlLink useful noise  for the link

      I keep hearing about electability and this frightens me.  Why are we so focused on who the other guy would vote for? Don’t people realize that now, especially in the primaries and caucuses that are occurring, now is your chance much more than in the nationwide election to make your voice be heard. This is about you and your choice and picking the right candidate to represent you and your issues rather than voting based upon what your neighbor thinks is right and following suite. Am I missing something here? Granted my politics are much more radical than the people that I have chosen to support and so you may in fact call me somewhat of a hypocrite. I do believe that it is important to choose someone to bridge the gap between us all. However, don’t just give up and pick the guy everyone else is. This isn’t high school. It does remind me of it though. When I was a senior at my rather small school in northern Minnesota I decided that I wanted to be chosen as queen of our winter school festival called SnoBall. Since the decision was made rather democratically (we nominated people in our class and then those names were given to the student body to be voted on) I thought I had a rather good chance. All I had to do was get a nomination and then get my name out there to the rest of the student body on voting day. Most of the underclassman would not be familiar with the senior student names and with the help of some homemade posters and a handy catch phrase “Vote Christine for SnoQueen!” I had a fairly good chance at it. This was the route that we (a couple of my friends and I) undertook. My friend Maren even made up the two little posters to go up on the voting day. After the voting was in I found out that I had not been chosen as SnoQueen. This I could live with – evidently our tactics had not been effective as we had thought. What threw me the most however was that my dear friend Maren had decided not to vote for me on the basis that she didn’t think that I would win.  What?! This is how our country is working. I just don’t get it.

      the absentee bloggert.  it's like my mom used to say: if you don't have anything interesting to blog, don't blog anything at all.    the one single guy in the office--who, don't worry, probably doesn't like girls anyway--filled me in on ms. jackson's little halftime oopsie.  ((you see, the coworker is a devout J.T. idolizer.)) don't ask how i missed it, of course i sat through the whole boring first half of the game, then missed the janet nipshot.  i haven't tried to download any nips, er...clips, yet, but word is there is a vertiable deluge.  i am currently addicted to postal service: "give up".  i borrowed it from a friend, and am hoping i can make sure she forgets that i have it before she leaves the state in a few weeks.  if only i were as cold-hearted a friend as that.  i had track one (the district sleeps alone tonight) stuck in my head for all of Monday--probably means i'm addicted in a bad way.  as soon as i figure out how to add links (yes, i'm dense) my posts may gain a little more spice.

      local kids do good.  when i was a teenager living in northern minnesota my family got the  urlLink fargo forum  delivered to my house. i was never terribly interested in the local news that was happening in the fargo/moorhead area as it were - but would skip ahead to the local movie reviews and read them with reckless abandon. the local reviewers would tell me what to expect, what to avoid, and of course what books the movies were based on so i could be sure to either read them first or read them instead of seeing the movie (because books are always better). my absolute favorite reviewer though was chuck klosterman. i would value his advice above all others... especially above tammy swift whom i couldn't trust at all with her puffy blond hair and super done up northwestern pretty mom face. since i'm super excitable about reminiscent stuff and my roots and all... i you know... feel happy when i hear that my favorite little reviewer is currently an editor for spin magazine and that  urlLink this little interview  was linked on  urlLink gawker . that makes me happy as well.   oh and i also can't forget to use my barnes and noble gift card to pick up the newest issue of spin which is evidently featuring  urlLink slug  on some article about emo-rap... whatever that is. he also was drinking at the cc club saturday night. i was also harassed by one of the wait staff, who when i emerged from the bathroom stall insisted that i "should leave" and that she "had been watching me". i'm not entirely sure why she was so insistent that i should leave. my slightly intoxicated behavior was - i assure you - not inappropriate or anything else that would require me to leave. we stayed for quite a while anyway. our server didn't seem to have any issues with me or my posse.

      the  urlLink funniest thing ever  via  urlLink New Yorkish  it makes me even more sorry that i missed the showing of tron at  urlLink sound unseen  this past fall... ahhh tron.... i get a little misty eyed when i see the simpsons version... pure genius...   this  urlLink nifty little device  would be so handy to have... there are many a show that i've come home from wishing i could have a copy of the songs that night. especially since i've been forced to listen to so many crappy recordings from cell phones and i'm not technologically inclined enough to think up my own way to do it...

      Its Thursday today. All week I’ve been one day ahead. Not usually a good thing but this week it has been. Especially since I’m calling in sick tomorrow… so today is kind of like Friday, I have to get all my work done today.   Anyway. Been staying at the new place. I love it. Last night I was supposed to take my last trip of stuff over from the old place – well I moved my kitchen table and chairs (was going to leave them in my car last night, but there were other people out moving as well so I just hauled them in at 11pm). Tonight I have to get all my stuff out of the fridge and freezer – which really isn’t much at all and I have a basket of dirty clothes (which I’m throwing in my car to take home Friday night, I guess I still have a couple things in the bathroom drawer and a picture on the kitchen wall, and a couple things in downstairs storage… oh man and my bike. Will this never end!? Well, it will have to. I’ll go out to the old place after work and load up all that random stuff (try and get my bike in my car (eek) and take it back to the new apt. I’m also going to stay over at the old place tonight because we’re moving roommate out at 7am tomorrow morning. That’s a little early for my taste, but at least most of her stuff is all ready to go. We have been packing her for the last couple of nights (interspersed with my moving.)   I’m so excited for next week. I just want to be able to know that there is nothing left to move and then I can sit down and start putting things up and organizing. I have three sacks of dry groceries sitting on my kitchen counter. I need to get things put away. Amazingly enough I already have plans for Monday, Wednesday and Thursday with friends. And  urlLink Swiss Army is playing on Friday at the Entry  which we might try and see. Also I have a wedding to attend on Saturday. Oh boy. I’m just going to collapse from exhaustion pretty soon here.   Oh – and I love my new place. It’s tiny, with good sunlight, hardwood floors, and quiet. There are dogs in my building which are just adorable – I saw this young great dane leaving the other night as I was hauling stuff in… so cute. And since the weather has been nice I see them walking all over the place.  I think its going to be really good – this living on my own. Quite good.

      ITS MY BIRTHDAY!!!   urlLink TAURUS (April 20-May 20):  Your most important accomplishment this year has been to deepen your capacity for love. That alone should inspire you to leap up and sing a song of joy. More and more, you understand that in order to get the passionate affection you want, you simply have to give the passionate affection you want. If you continue to expand your generosity in the coming months, you will receive a flood of evidence about how beautiful you really are. That, in turn, will ensure that the influences you want to bring into your life will also be good for you.

      Birthday Week has commenced!  Sunday  - Force college girl friends to eat delicious breakfast in my company at SunnySideUp Cafe. Accomplished! Jes, Katie, Kat, and Jill accompanied me for breakfast/lunch to open up my birthday week. I had my usual 5A (which will feed me for the next week) with scrambled eggs, whole wheat toast, veggies, potatoes and a whole lot of gooey cheese. Delicious! I do believe the winner of the meal though was Katie, who in her indecisive prime, made our server choose which meal she should order. The choice was the Cowboy Tort which almost everyone tried and decided they would certainly order next time.  Monday  - Coffee. This shows how crazy I am. I had penciled in coffee for Monday which meant that I was to go to a coffee shop and write and drink coffee, because as it is something I enjoy doing - it is something that I rarely make time for. So tonight I'll be having some sort of caffeinated beverage on Lyndale while being interviewed by a friend of mine from college about an article he's writing for some online magazine. You must remain flexible in the plans you make.  Tuesday  - 3Rock two-fers My favorite place for a cheap drink.   Wednesday  - (actual birthday) Nachos and muchos friends at Little T's  Thursday  - Skateboard shopping (unfortunately i won't be actually purchasing the skateboard yet... just doing my research). Also  urlLink Dining Out for Life  and book club. (I'm half way through the book - don't tell)  Friday  - Was going to be girls night has now been delegated to "Pack the Kitchen with my roommate" night  Saturday  - Moving day - that’s right. moving. Filling up an empty 15 passanger van with all my belongings and moving across town. I'm excited. Will most likely be celebrated that evening with cold Premium.

      So last night we didn’t make it to the 3Rock until much later than planned. It was still good to be there. D is freshly back from Italy and I have so much missed hanging out with her. She’s crazy and funny and the boys tend to hover around her (or maybe they were just trying to get through to the video games we were leaning against – whatever) and she continues to talk about how she just needs to find either some random to date or some good Christian boy to settle down with that will understand her restrictions etc. I told her good luck, because as far as I’ve seen, what she’s looking for is purely a myth propagated by parents and church leaders, no boys are ever that pure or understanding. Well we kept getting in the way of the people who wanted to play golden tee or the root beer game but that was mainly because we refuse to go into the new addition (granted I’ve been over there for shows and that’s about all its good for, in fact its great for that… but for a bar – no). We complained about the lack of old regulars, the twins – two boys that some how look so similar in their gorgeousness and yet completely different (one of whom I’ve renamed the most beautiful man in Minneapolis, he wanders around uptown with a camera and a skateboard… so lovely) the other that we were missing was Mr. Intriguing. Mr. Intriguing is this crazy eyed curly haired man who we always used to run into (not talk with) exchange crazy glances and raised eyebrows with at the old triple rock patio. Last night we had the realization that we have been going to the triple rock for four years now (some Tuesdays more regularly than others).  He is one of whom it cannot be said is either attractive or not – he transcends all the normal classifications of our people watching. We hadn’t seen him in quite a while – granted D has been out of the country and its harder to go there in the winter or even if I start to think about the loss of the patio and all the new faces that are there – but he arrived last night at 1:30, just as we were leaving. We almost turned around and went back in, but really, we both had an early morning to look forward to, and we’ll be back next week. I mean next Tuesday after all is the night before my birthday… where else would I be? Oh and next week, I’m taking Wednesday morning off.

      "oh these creatures and their love"  It's good to be a twenty-four year old uncommitted girl. Uncommitted to anything besides my apartment anyway. For the love of the apartment (with the hardwood floors, big windows, huge bathtub, in the lovely neighborhood) I have committed to at least a year of habitation. Which means that in a couple of months I must find something to support my committment - a job. I work now, but not in the actually getting paid for my forty hours a week sort of sense. This I'll worry about more later. But while my friends are considering cohabitation and engagements I am still trying to figure out whether or not I can drill into my walls to affix shelving, if I should really get a step stool to reach the top shelves in my kitchen, what art/picture I could hang over my bed, whether my neighbors are aware/bothered by all the noises coming out of my apartment, and if that guy with the black lab down the hall is actually attractive or if he's just really old and I only see him in the not well lit hallway and because he has a dog with him I've imagined that he's hot. Oh I don't know how I get through my days and nights with these pressing issues.   For now I will worry about kickball. What night of the week it should change to - the responses seem to be leaning towards Mondays and Wednesdays.   Oh, and I've been dreaming about puppies again. It's at least comforting to me to be dreaming about puppies instead of babies. I know that I'm not either responsible or ready for either of them, but I'd rather be having the puppy dreams.   In real news: *This weekend jilianlove will be down from the great boring north for a little book clubbing and general hanging out in the cities.  *I'm looking forward to attending the  urlLink U.S. Conference on Democratic Workplaces  next Monday and Wednesday. (unfortunately I am unable to attend on Tuesday because of a training that we're hosting at the Hill House) *I'm having happy hour at  urlLink rock rock rock  tonight with some of my girl type friends. $5 for a beer and a burger... (veg burgers included!!) *Next Tuesday evening is  urlLink Voltage: Fashion Amplified  at First Ave featuring my favorite new band  urlLink Coach Said Not To !

      Why am I not inspired to be writing?  It’s the laziness.  I felt it last night. No I didn’t.  I was going to call people that I hadn’t talked to in a while… but then decided not to waste more of my daytime minutes and wait until 9. By nine I figured most people didn’t want to be called? I read instead.  It’s a book – paper back novel – by  urlLink Agatha Christie  – one of my favorite writers, featuring the splendid little Belgian detective Hercule Poirot. There is a murder to be solved. I’m half way through the book. Will most likely finish the second half tonight. The host of a party who liked to dress as Mephistopheles was killed while his guests were playing bridge. Who did it!? Can she write the word Mephistopheles one more time? Or make one more reference to what a character the host was? He lived dangerously, was a collector, of many things… including… murderers. Dun Dun Duhnnnnn! Oh and I baked cookies too. Not too complicated since they came from a box (which I might add is very unusual for me.) I brought them to work today and labeled the clear plastic container "Cookies are for sharing!" They'll most likely be gone by the time I leave work today.  Now here I am at work. Just finished my latest project. Waiting for lunch and walking. Wondering where last evening went and why I didn’t do more. Why haven’t I been doing more while I’m at home. I have all this time, this space, this freedom and I just want to lie around in bed. Dreaming.

      This morning I'm early to work and listening to Dancing Queen on Radio K.  Last night I was terrified. Just a little while after my parents left(They stopped by on their way to their hotel out by the airport. They're going to Rochester today for my Dad's appointment.), around 11pm, I started hearing noises like people pounding on something and then breaking glass.

      This morning I'm early to work and listening to Dancing Queen on Radio K.  Last night I was terrified. Just a little while after my parents left(They stopped by on their way to their hotel out by the airport. They're going to Rochester today for my Dad's appointment.), around 11pm, I started hearing noises like people pounding on something and then breaking glass. I had never heard this noise before, but from what I could decifer it sounded like people breaking car windows. So I sat there in the middle of my bed. Then I went to the windows to try and see if I could figure out if I was just freaking myself out or if this was really happening. I couldn't see anything. Although I feel very safe for my person in the new apartment I'm always a little nervous about my car. Its been broken into twice and neither time anything was stolen - because there is never anything valuable in my car!! Both of the times that it was broken into before were within a couple months of each other and not far from where I live currently. In fact the second time it was just a couple blocks down from my current apartment. Anyway. I realize that this is a risk that I take with my car. Finally I convinced myself around midnight that since I wasn't going to do anything I should just go to bed. I woke up early this morning and it was raining. Usually I love the rain, but this morning I was filled with dread that now my car might not only have a broken window, but drenched seats. I couldn't decided whether I should run out to the car before getting dressed for work so I could call the insurance people right away or if I should just get ready for work. I got ready for work. Showered quick, put some lunch together, got my umbrella and went out to my car. All along the block on the way there (where I swear these glass breaking sounds were coming from) I didn't see any signs of break ins. There was no glass on the street or sidewalk and no noticable dome lights on. My car was fine as well. Nothing amiss.  I hope that I was just imaging things - or misplacing sounds. Either way. I'm fine again. And now I can enjoy the rain and the fact that I got to work super early.

      new york times reporting on the  urlLink new generation of gardeners .  i found it interesting that the title references the blog generation and yet starts and seems to focus on  urlLink Ready Made Magazine  (which is neither gardening focused or a blog) and something that has been rather hit and miss in the past, but i think with its growth in popularity has been steadily getting better. I'm a big fan of the d.i.y. stuff and challenges that they have in each issue. They barely mention  urlLink You Grow Girl  which is a site I was lead to back when i read  urlLink Bonnie Burton's site  . The personal gardening blogs are always fun to read. Also good for getting tips. I still have yet to get the shirt that they sell on the site which I love. It simply says - garden hoe. As a girl who grew up gardening plots much bigger than my house ever was I've always tried to maintain a healthy indoor plant population since moving to the big city. At the last apartment my friends would constantly comment on my "little jungle" that I had growing on a couple of end tables in front of the south window. In this new apartment I've been able to spread the plants out a little bit more which gives a little variety to the apartment and ensures fresh air everywhere you turn.  Also - plans for this summer are to add three fresh eating plants - cilantro, basil, and mint.

      notes... - appeared to be husky night at the dog park last night. a woman who was leaving with her dog told us (we were standing outside the park leaning against the fence) that "only the dogs need off leash permits, we were free to go in without" it was sweet of her, but i still would feel wierd going in there without a dog of my own. - kick ball starts next friday. - its raining right now.  - i've eaten dinner at my new place TWICE since moving in officially last monday. i'm thinking that needs to change soon. - listening to rufus wainwright "want one" today. his reedy voice is not grating instead rather pleasant and this cd seems to match my mood and the weather today.

      This weekend was the opening of the  urlLink Hiawatha Light Rail . I enjoyed the day with Kate and got to nerd out/go into tourist mode a bit and take copious amounts of photos (of which I will soon be posting, well half are digital, the other half I need to get developed yet)... but more importantly...   I saw the most beautiful man doing voter registration at the Cedar Riverside stop.  Do I still need to get registered to vote? YES. Did I go and speak with the most beautiful man ever in order to get registered to vote? NO.  Why? because evidently I am perpetually fourteen years old and instead took a picture of him while waiting for the train to take us to the Franklin stop.  Kate said that he took a picture of us as well, although I do like to believe I'm invisible, I'm finding that pretty likely. Related to that --- I had an amusing conversation with Maria today that went a little something like this...  M: Do you know who Dale is WITH for helping people register to vote? C: No, I was going to ask him though. the sign in front of the beautiful man’s table said ACT. M: Hm…you should volunteer with them, maybe then you’d MEET him. C: Who is it though… ACT… I tried googling key words today and got nowhere. M: Jeez, it could be anything. C: Exactly. M: But you could be making beautiful babies for me to babysit to see if I want them… C:And now the pathetic weeping begins. Oh. I am a sad sad creature.  M: Woe is you…:) C: *weep* *weep* *weep**weep* *weep* *weep* *weep**weep* *weep**weep* *weep**weep* *weep* (etc.) M: No weeping.  You’re fabulous.     Friends are really spectacular things to have.

      I am so tired - this weekend was heaps of fun, but super exhausting as well. For starters - left work early on Friday to help out at  urlLink Rock the Garden with David Byrne .   For two and a half hours of taking tickets, applying wrist bands, directing people to the exit and infoming people that they  could not  infact take beer into the garden, we received a nice little box lunch, water, a great t-shirt from american apparel and admittance to the show. We even saw  urlLink Rex  and resisted berating him for the lack of posting. The Walker volunteer coordinators were great and even let our friend from out of town volunteer with us since she had no where else to go really. We were positioned at the main entrance and worked with an azia security guard who reminded me of  urlLink lorenzo lamas  from his  urlLink Renegade  days.(which i thought was pretty hot at the time - i mean back when i watched the show) He was rather friendly and I enjoyed chatting with him, but the fact that he never took his sunglasses of (even in the shade) made it difficult for me to actually have a conversation with him. I hate it when I can't see people's eyes.   The  urlLink Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra  from Brooklyn was fun to dance to during our ticket taking stint. They were a huge maybe thirteen piece band with reggae, ska, afro beats and political language. I was loving it. We were finished with our volunteer stint in just enough time to grab a beer and head up close to the stage to see  urlLink David Byrne  perform. He moved about the stage sometimes running in circles, other times dancing in a slow sexy manner that also seemed to be directing the music and the Tosca Strings that were accompanying him. I was fairly unfamiliar with his music other than a couple Talking Heads songs from the radio but that did not take away from the excellence from the show at all. My favorite song of the moment is Finite=Alright off of the Feelings album. They also performed a live version of a dj remix of one of his songs. This could be the new trend in musical progression - forget just live bands or dj's or the mixture -  the next step is the cover of the collaboration performed live. It made for an excellent evening and instead of being sad that we didn't have an after party to attend I was relieved. All that ticket taking, people watching, and dancing had worn me out.   I was in bed by 11pm.

      Wednesday evening I ended up hanging out with Jes and Katie doing some chatting about whatnots and eating strawberries and shortcake.  After returning home (and successfully parallel parking my car) I headed over to the park to see what was left of the movie.  urlLink Beat Street  is the story of hip hop in inner city New York in the early 80s. By the time I arrived there were still two reels left of film and the bugs were biting like mad. Fortunately my friend Dan of soon to be  urlLink Oh!Operator  fame saw me sitting on the sidelines and invited me to share the  urlLink Transformer  blanket that he and his friend Tyler had with them. The movie was not a good movie, but was still great if you know what I mean with some great break dancing scenes, graffiti, and 80s hip hop music. The most amusing part of the evening however came not from the movie, but from the woman across the street from the park.   She evidently was unware that open windows + lights on = everyone in the park can see you topless walking around your bathroom and living room while watching tv.

      neurosis for the morning.   Just because you start to find more extensive common ground with someone of the opposite sex over a couple of beers (ok... three on an empty stomach) does not mean that you might be accidentally falling in love. I, in my drunken, suddenly shell-shocked and excited naiveté have mistaken this more than once. Luckily this time the fall brief and minor and was over happy hour so I had time over dinner with a close friend to sober up and come to my senses.   I have many girl friends that over the years have complained about not being able to keep any close guy friends because eventually and nearly without fail they guys fall in love with them. In my case it turns out to be nearly the opposite. Almost without fail, when I start to discover something genius and special within another person, most often of the opposite sex, my first instinct is to get terribly excited about them, talk about them incessantly, and last, but not least, convince myself that I must be falling “in love” with them. In fact this happens so often that I rejoice when I hit it off with someone that I don’t immediately find physically attractive. The reason for this being that I assume or try to convince myself that if I don’t find myself attracted to them, I should be able to keep them as a good friend. Maybe I’ve just watched “When Harry Met Sally” one to many times, but I seem to fall into this trap.   Maybe it’s all about my incessant need to fall in love. If you need more pop culture references and labels I’ll put it this way. When “Sex and the City” came out all of the women I know rushed to identify themselves with one of the characters in the show. My former roommate was an obvious choice for Carrie with her penchant for spending money she didn’t necessarily have and her on again never truly off relationship with Mr. Big. No one in my group seemed quite ready to identify themselves with Samantha and her uber promiscuous behavior although her frankness about her not only her sexuality but also the rest of her life matched up well with another girl friend of mine. I, however, was left with not one, but two characters that I felt shared my styles, traits and whatnots (one mustn’t forget the whatnots.) I discovered that I am both Miranda and Charlotte. An, unlikely combination I know, and thinking about it makes me want to defend my affinity with that now horribly cliché Meredith Brooks song – I’m a bitch, I’m lover, I’m a child, etc. because isn’t every woman a combination platter. We don’t fit into nice little stereotypical packages of the slut, the domestic, the independent woman etc. But this is getting off the topic.   Back to the matter at hand. I identify with Charlotte because of her idealistic and unblemished view of the possibility of true love. Many see this as her naiveté, in fact often I do as well and it makes me question my own life. It makes me question y own faith that I will someday find “the one” and have adventures for the rest of my life with one person, have babies, send them to good schools, bake pumpkin bread, teach them how to ride a bike, and grow old with the same person. It’s a level of commitment that is hard to find these days – but I still believe in its possibility especially when coupled with “true love.”  Miranda and I are soul sisters however for the fact that I am utterly and completely terrified of everything that I just wrote above about matching with Charlotte. I am a strong independent woman who does not want to rely on anyone else for anything else – regardless of whether I need it or not. If we want to look into where this came from, the most obvious contributing factors seem to be that the fact that my parents raised me to be an independent thinker who didn’t accept things at face value who could do anything I set my mind to, because they had faith in me coupled with the fact that I have been - alone - single - for pretty much my entire life. Sure I had a boyfriend in high school (who lived an hour and a half away from me and neither of us had cars), and bizarre friendship/relationships in college that I think are just part of college and the fact that I tend to fall for flaky boys, but never a real relationship – never something where we called each other boyfriend and girlfriend or hung out regularly or called each other before we went to sleep at night or knew that someone was there for us. None of this has ever been a part of my life. So because of that I’ve grown to be a stronger independent woman who doesn’t make time for those sorts of things with possible boys I meet, and doesn’t even consciously expect a relationship as a possibility. Miranda didn’t want to commit to a relationship, sure our “histories” are different, but I think the driving force can be the same – fear.   So have I really figured anything out by saying these things? Probably not, my character is conflicted. Not that there is anything wrong with a conflicted character – they’re the great ones right? Every story has to have some conflict, mine just happens to be the internal sort. Maybe I am Miranda after all and it really isn’t about my incessant need to fall in love. After all, Miranda was the one who ended up with the career, the baby, and the clever guy with the round glasses and the curly hair. Will these issues get resolved some day? Possibly, after all I’m only twenty-four… and if we’re still going to follow the “Sex and the City” ladies I’ve got a lot of time left to figure things out for myself.

      Last night Jen and I were in search of some air conditioning and since I saw a movie on  urlLink Monday , am seeing one  urlLink tonight  and  urlLink tomorrow , I opted for a change of pace last night. She was a good sport and we went to ½ price books out in St. Louis Park so I could pick up my book club book  urlLink The Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Tool . Maria and I had gone to the Highland Park ½ price yesterday at noon, but they only had one copy, so she got it (it was less than $2!). Normally I don’t advocate for chain type booksellers, but in times of desperation (I have very little money and the book cost me less than what I owe in library fines currently) I can justify it.  I found the book for only six dollars and then spent a bit of time chatting with Jen and disturbing the other customers I’m sure. (I’m never quite sure about the protocol for book stores, is it exactly the same as libraries? Are we allowed to talk?) I’m usually quiet and respectful, but I guess the sudden coolness of the air conditioned surroundings brought out my chatty side. I picked up a couple of possible birthday gifts as well so all in all it was a successful outing.  When checking out the man who was selling me my books mentioned that he had heard that  urlLink Will Ferrell  was possibly making a movie based on the book but that it probably wouldn’t be out for a while. I mentioned to him that at the very least it won’t be out until after I finish the book. He said, yeah… probably. Then I said, well, club meets on Monday so I’m almost sure of it. He kind of chuckled and said good luck.  I told Jen that obviously he has no idea&nbsp;how determined I&nbsp;can be – besides the fact that I’m a single girl, who lives by herself and doesn’t own a t.v.  Jen chuckled and we drove to  urlLink Crema Café  to get some Sonny’s ice cream. I had a double scoop with merlot chocolate chip and sweet cream. Oh delicous.

      San Francisco specifically, and the Bay Area in general, certainly have their appeal (especially next year if I have a friend there), however (and this is probably a wack reason) my brother and sister-in-law just moved from SF.  I don’t want to give the impression—mostly to myself, but secondarily to others—of “following in my brother's footsteps.”  I want to forge my own path, blaze my own trail, venture to cities where no other R-D child has dwelt before. While I concede that I would still give another thought to California for its dearth of rain and surfeit of sun, especially as compared to the attractive (though colder and wetter) northern metropoles (metropolises? metropoli?) of Portland and Seattle, there is something about Portland that inspires me to strike out into the unknown.  San Fran and Seattle are somewhat lacking in this indiscernible quality-—I haven’t yet conjured a reason/definition for it--but there is an aspect of Portland (the city itself as well as the idea of it) that captivates me.  I’ve been saying Portland for a year now (and hoping that it is calling my name as well).  Just saying the word to myself, to anyone who will listen. By speaking it I hope it will someday become a reality, but I’m starting to think perhaps the reverse is true-—that by repeating the phrase it has lost its true meaning, becoming a mantra that allows me to make concessions on the real plans (taking the GRE, looking at grad schools, finding a more inspiring job) that could get me there.  Besides which, I’ve only visited Portland once, for two days, so what do I really know?  Anywhere along the Western shore would provide a valuable change of pace and a much-needed respite from -40 degree winter weather.

      I'm one of those foolish souls who continues to use her work email for personal type things. Well because we had some spam problems we've had to institute a number of filters so that our entire day isn't spent looking through the preview pane at anonymous unclothed members. This has created a bit of a problem in my personal correspondence however, my email has taken to showing re:CONTENT whenever anyone swears in it. At first this was fun because some friends would try and see how many CONTENT markers it could get per message, but today the filters must have been turned up as it is simply blocking the offending emails. However, it seems Morgan had some spare time on her hands today and came up with some alternative spellings... to evade my filters.   -----Original Message----- From: Morgan  Sent: Tuesday, July 06, 2004 3:18 PM To: Christine  Subject: the new profanity -- work email friendly  shet sheet  shiitty  fock feck fecker focker  beech betch  botch  ----------------------------  creativity at its best people. give this woman a lemon - she'll make lemonaide.

      Just so I don't forget... memo to myself...  Oh I know I know. Its so difficult. I think I need to personally start taking more risks and not being such a weeny. Ask some people out. They're cute - why not? It doesn't mean I'd be stuck with the wrong person or in a relationship, it just means that I'd have a chance at a make out or a cuddle or something. I need to stop being such a freak about it though... cuz really that guy was so cute and I couldn't even say " hi, I need to get registered to vote, could you help me with that?" and now I don't need to get registered to vote... so I don't even have that anymore. Oh well.  ps. I'm going to be sitting in the bar all by myself... well not entirely.. I'll send you the correspondence I had with steve-o about it. :) Yes, no getting hung up about boys... more having fun. That way we'll minimize the rejection and add some spontaneity to our lives.  And dude. How more pathetic can it get than me lying in bed at 7:30 in the morning imagining the voter registration guy with his arm around my waist while we stayed there trying to convince ourselves that we didn't have to go to work.

Would love to see a hardbound picture book of the book someday, but realize that according to the rules it won't happen.       * Wishing I would have had enough money to buy the new   urlLink  Ouija Radio    cd Last Night On Earth. Was at their cd release party Friday night (ok... we went to see the Mellismatics, but what a great biproduct of the evening-- found out about a great band). Also thank you to the girl who was at their merch table. She was so kind to give me a button for free and not laugh at me when I explained my lack of funds. Anyway - go to their shows! Buy their CD!

       urlLink "Let a hundred flowers bloom: let a hundred schools of thought contend."   Life has been really busy and really good for a little while now... what with last week's  urlLink birthday week extravaganzas  with Maria and general contentment on my part regarding life. I suppose it is only appropriate that it is Monday and it is raining a perfect book end to the uber hectic schedule I've been keeping.    Return of the Phone Stand        I'd like to say a little something about my general contented outlook at the moment. I've been biking. This is not the first time that I've been biking in the city. No, I don't have a helmet yet, yes, I'll be getting one --- soon. I hadn't been biking since the summer after sophomore year in college. I had coerced my parents into transporting my bike from home down to my little on-campus apt the fall when I moved back to school but proceded to keep the bike in our apartment (at the foot of my bed) for the remainder of the year. It came to be known as "the phone stand"I'm not sure whether it was Jill or I who dubbed it this, but it was appropriate as my green phone sat on the back of my cute little dusty rose ten speed for the entire year. Even now the moniker has remained. When I told Jill that I had been out riding she said "What!" and dropped her jaw, "You were doing what?! with the phone stand?" Yes, on July 31st I walked my rusty pink bike over to the gas station, paid 25 cents for air and rode back to my apartment. I had thought that I needed new tires for most of the summer and with August approaching and I still hadn't done anything about it I figured I should at least test them out. They work! At least the leaks are slow enough to hold me for the amount of bike rides I fit into one or two days. My first ride consisted of biking from my apartment to Calhoun Square (to do some Saturday morning banking) to Lake of the Isles and back to my apartment. It was glorious. I was nervous about biking amongst cars (still am and rightfully so) but the feeling of wind through my hair and arms and legs and toes did everything to overtake that. The feeling that I was fueling my movement and going rather rapidly at it as well was so freeing. It felt like I was that girl that I had wanted to be when I moved down to the cities. Like as if all the pieces were coming together and this was it.  Even now when I'm writing about it I get this little thrill through me. Part of the exhilaration was the fact that the Monday before I had run into a friend of mine from college at movies and music in the park. I had been sitting there with MRD, Maria, Amanda, and Jill inbetween the music and the movie (which they fell asleep for) watching the people when I noticed him standing there on the edge of the path. I turned around again and waved. I hadn't seen him since we said goodbye two summers earlier. What do you do when you're crazy in love with someone who doesn't feel the same way about you. You anguish, you torment yourself, you pray to the love of all that exists that they leave town. He did. It was good. I was kinda seeing someone else at the time so that made things a little easier, it didn't help the past though, I still wrestled with that in drunken 4a.m. moments at later times. He had called the fall before to invite me to some art show but I had been heading out of town and hadn't been able to make it. I've been told that I left the New Years party a year ago just ten minutes before he showed up (in town on a visit) and also that out of the two party options for Halloween this year he showed up at the one that we didn't quite make it to. I have no idea how that all worked out, at the time I was a little upset about missing him -- or greatful because I was dressed as a really ugly "Designing Woman", but I'm so thankful now. So thankful because I needed the time. When he came and sat next to me I realized that I had nothing to say to him. Which is a little bizarre for me to keep looking at "I had nothing to say to him" because when I think about it I never really said much to him at all. I mean, we talked had great conversations, but really I was the sponge in our relationship. I wanted to absorb all that he was. I wanted to be part of all of it. I wanted to know all of it. It was where we were when we were. He and all that he found value in were all that mattered to me. But sitting there I had nothing to say to him. I listened as he told me that he had just gotten back from Wisconsin with his significant other and he handed me a berry flavored beer. I noticed how he casually slipped that in there, but really that wasn't it. For whatever reason I always had seen myself as the martyred woman. He was my Che and I was the woman who couldn't hold a candle to his revolution. I clung to this fantasy, either knowing or refusing to acknowledge the fact that it was only a fantasy. I think I mainly knew but held on nonetheless. Unfortunately it took me two years of not seeing him -- physical, mental and emotional distance to grow on my own. Then realizing as I sat next to him in the park that I had nothing to say to him. It wasn't so much that his podium had suddenly crumbled - that happened without me realizing it within those two years. All of a sudden he was sitting next to me and that was all that it was, we were level and suddenly he wasn't so special anymore. As Jill and I were talking over a glass of box wine later she brought up that she thought talking with him that he hadn't changed at all. He was still that same crazy boy - but I was someone so different than that girl who had fallen for him six years earlier.  After seeing him however I got really upset - but not in the oh-shit-I've-seen-him-again-and-opened-up-all-the-old-wounds but I was just really pissed off. Jill was right by my side ready for damage control. She asked how I was and I said fine, but you could tell that something was off. Maria and MRD who had never met him before and I hadn't even bothered to introduce made bewildered comments of "that was him?" They were obviously not impressed. I went home that night still angry and in a way trying to wallow in what should have been depression. Cursing the fact that I had run into him. The thing is though that seeing him I felt nothing. I wasn't depressed and the next morning when I tried to get all worked up about it upon waking I finally began to realize that I really wasn't angry about seeing him. The issue came from the fact that when I saw him I didn't react, I was getting angry because I didn't feel anything else and didn't know what to do about it. Somehow I had regained all that power that at one time I had voluntarily gave to him. It was mine and I was confused about what I should be doing with it.  So on Saturday I went for a bike ride. It was exhilarating not because bike riding fills everyone with such and extrodinary thrill - but because I was beginning to realize that I am the girl that I wanted to be. Six years later I'm that bike riding, book reading, writing, people watching, solo apartment having, optimistic, great set of friends having, freedom fighting, peace loving, girl that I wanted to be. I'm doing it without having some of the things that I thought were necessary at one time --- a boyfriend and a stable job.  I'm living and it's good.

      He just knows! It's like he's f*'ng psychic or something...   urlLink TAURUS (April 20-May 20): To hint at the potentials of the coming week, I'll appropriate the words of avant-garde music composer and author John Cage. In describing his work, he once said, "I have nothing to say/and I am saying it/and that is poetry." Here's an altered version, Taurus, created especially to suit your current astrological needs:   You have nothing to do/and you are doing it/and that's your genius.
