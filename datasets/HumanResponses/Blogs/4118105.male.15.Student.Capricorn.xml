      Not much has been happening the past few days. I had a LAN tuesday, Erik had one Thursday (?). His, of course, was bigger, but they were both pretty fun.  Friday I got up early to head out to orientation at Marion Steele. Eek. That school is absolutely gigantic. I'm going to have a hard time trying to find my way around, I know that already.  Looks like fun :)  After that I tried getting some sleep, because, well, I really didn't get all that much that night. My old bed completely fell apart, and the new one is just hell. H-E-L-L. I swear. I was up for literally hours, tired and completely pissed off. Tossing and turning didn't help, so I just ripped the damn mattress up and tossed it onto the floor upside down. Sure, it was lopsided with a comforter and pillow underneath it- but anything was better than that bed. From hell.  Well I didn't get to sleep. Yeah, I was tired. But my little brother was doing his usual annoying "Hey, look! I can act like I'm homosexual and be cool at the same time!" thing. So I just started up FFX and overdrived some Aeons.  Then Joe picked me up to do stuff. That stuff started out by going to Zack's house. We watched him play Chronicles of Riddick for like two hours before leaving again. Joe fell asleep and we had to wake him up with pen missiles.  First off? The Exchange. Bleh. I'll never understand people's obsessions with "buying" music.  Then Fazoli's, where I was tempted by bread sticks and Italian food poop. I wasn't hungry, but that didn't stop Joe from trying to bug me about not having anything to eat. Seriously, Joe. I had twenty friggin' bucks in my pocket. If I wanted to eat, all I'd have to do was move three feet to order.  Then where, I hear you ask. Giant Eagle. Where I got scammed.  Zack, the considerate guy he is, took my twenty dollars and bought 3 tickets for the movies. I got a dollar back, along with some change. Total cost? $16. Bastard.  We saw the holiday buyer's guide of OXM. It totally sucked. I mean, this thing reeked of something that smells very bad. I can not put into words how disappointingly ripped off I would have felt if I bought it. As I said before, "crap crap crap!"  Off to Cobblestone, at last. We went to see Garden State, but that wouldn't be on for almost an hour. So, to Alien vs. Predator. That was pretty... underwhelming. We saw it from the part where the chick makes friends with the Predator. Seriously. W-T-F.  Anyway, the movie was kind of boring at that point. All the way to the end. Yawn.  So, to Garden State when it ended. Now  this  was a good movie. Sure, not the greatest- but compared to AvP it was like the second coming of Jesus.  One part made me think of the whistle scene from FFX. Yeah. That confirms that my life is owned by video games.  Overall, very good movie. The ending was, um, quick... But it was pretty exceptional besides that.  And what night would be complete without Frosties? Yeah, Joe's treat. After that, Rite Aid was probably more fun than it should have been.  (Caramel Ho-Ho's! Love at first sight!)  They say the greatest things in life are free. Well, they actually cost roughly a dollar. But the general idea is pretty much spot-on.  I also realized something on the way home (it was probably when Joe hit 110 mph with Breathing blasting through the speakers) : I haven't been doing anything at all for the longest time. I've been spending my life cooped up without taking any risks. No chances, no fun, no excitement. I need to change that, but I need a way to start. I got off on a bad start for high school because I worked  every single weekend . Now I still work weekends. Know what? I hate it. And guess what surprise my dad told me today!  I have to work every Tuesday and Wednesday evening from now on.  I don't often say this, but I think it fits what I'm feeling about the whole situation: FUCK NO.  I am not going to fucking work weekdays  and  weekends this year. No fucking way. That'll just get me off to yet another bad start. I can't go out on weekends, I can't enjoy myself, I can't see people- all because of that damn job.

      I was bored, I admit, while I came up with this theory. Maybe a little tired. But it doesn't matter. What matters is that this ancient saying is being proven wrong.  First, let's look at the definition of "object", as it pertains to this argument:  1.) Something perceptible by one or more of the senses, especially by vision or touch; a material thing.  That's the first definition, quoted from The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language. Here are some other takes:  1.) Something material that may be perceived by the senses. 2.) Something mental or physical toward which thought, feeling, or action is desired.  That was from Merriam-Webster. So, now that we have established the definition of object, let's look at the word "material":                 n.          5.) A person who is qualified or suited for a position or activity. adj. 1.) Of, relating to, or composed of matter.  That was quoted from The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language. I'm just using the definitions that pertain to this certain essay.  So, I'm pretty sure women are composed of matter. I'm also certain there are quite a few positions they are suited to fill.  *snicker*  And so it is ascertained that women are material things- thus showing that they also fit into the definition of objects.  Now, I don't mean to put anyone down by saying that. By using the reasoning of this case, men would also be considered objects. Therefore we are both equal in that respect. I was just trying to disprove an incorrect statement.

      I get a lot of these, but I never really write them down. Now it's late, I'm tired, and I have nothing else to do. So here is my lightbulb:  -----  Setting: Primitive, but not medeival. This is a fantasy story, but there's none of that magic or dragon riding stuff. The known world is mainly encircled by a vast unexplored region that flows from rivers to mountains to lush forests. In the world exists scattered villages and only a few large cities... but outside and around civilization exists hordes of vicious and violent beasts- every area must first be cleansed of these creatures before anyone can settles down safely. This is why the first colonized city is also the largest; people didn't like to leave it. Travelling is dangerous, since the only places safe from a beast's bite are those which have been populated. Roads aren't exactly teeming with creatures looking for blood, but all the lesser-used paths are danger zones. Anywhere that hasn't been mapped has probably never been lived in long.  Bageanti- The largest city, founded by Turg Basanti six hundred years ago as the first true colony within the wilderness. It is bustling with science and technology; life is good and the people seem happy. There is a lack of space because of buildings steadily moving in towards the heart of the city. This is due to a rising rate of encounter with foul beasts on the city's edge. So within, it is crowded but busy. Stores abound and life remains mostly unchanged. On the outer limits, however, the sky is hazy and the homeless litter the gutters and ditches along the roads and sides of buildings. The air reeks of urine and cheap alcohol (but mostly urine). Not a very nice place to be.  The poorer folk who live homeless aren't exactly looked down upon by the more fortunate. They are just ignored, left alone to rot. The leaders of Bageanti want the city to appear immaculate. They don't want its dirty side to be shown. There's nothing really to hide besides that. The people are working towards the general betterment of mankind. Most realize the hypocrisy of their ways, but know that if they start to change things word would get out that the situation exists. There is a weekly "cleansing" of the inner city, where the restless bums who had snuck into the inner limits are forcibly taken back to their assigned area. Some of the wealthy actually help the less fortunate, but laws are laws.  Most of the homeless are viciously torn apart by the beasts on the outer limits. They have no protection or shelter, so it is easy for those animals to get at them.  The renowned Dr. Makaveli Craus lives here.  Arlaoa- The second largest city within this world. It's people accept technology and often trade with the neighboring towns and villages. It is fairly big, but not nearly as gigantic or as vertical as Bageanti. Still, it is a city compared to the smaller villages. Beasts don't usually show up around its area, but encounters do occur every so often. This is probably the place least touched by the effects of wilderness.  Every once in a while messengers will come from Bageanti to Arlaoa with a new technology, whether it be a new form of entertainment, medicine, or transportation. It is very rare for a traveller from Arlaoa to head in the direction of Bageanti, and even rarer for them to return.  Arlaoa has recently been receiving strange transmissions that spooked all who heard it. Garbled signals on radio that pierced the listeners' ears and drilled strange religious and symbolic ideas into their minds. The memory of those messages is almost impossible to shake. It first occurred within the town square, caught by the largest communication tower, thus being experienced by the general public. In a panic, the leader of the city cut off power to that section of the city and had the radio station changed. He keeps a receiver within his office walls that records the transmissions as they come in. Experts have been trying to decrypt them since he realized how grave their epistles were.  The signal was rumored to have caused hallucinations.  The main industries of Arlaoa are manufacturing and trade.  Ilios- A town on a peninsula, surrounded by many islands. It seems tropical in this world, but by Earth's standards it is not. Warm, but not exactly mediterranean, this is a vacation hotspot for those that can afford the expensive equipment and supplies needed for a journey through the wilderness.  The beaches here are separated into three groups: safe, risky, and forbidden. Safe, obviously, is the most popular tourist choice. Risky is subjective to the day and the tides. Sometimes it is calm and beautiful, sometimes it is extremely dangerous because of strong waves and currents. These are open to the public when resort owners know it is safe, but sudden changes in water level have been known to occur. Thus most people prefer the safe beaches. Forbidden areas are the places in which beast encounters have been known to occur- and marine creatures are among the worst. The general public are not allowed near these coasts.  The islands and the mainland have little contact with each other, mainly due to the risky water travelling. Only a handful of boats have a guarantee of not being destroyed by marine animals.  This is a small town which seems much larger because of the resorts and hotels. Still, most people do not have the money for vacation in this world.  Dreaum, Joyeuse, and Hadriin- The three smallest villages within this world. Each is led by a village chief.  Dreaum is self-contained. Its people don't often go out to meet others, and as a result, its knowledge of the outside world is limited. It's a dirty place with an even dirtier history. A hideout for bandits and other outlaws. The people here don't exactly take kindly to newcomers or strangers.  Joyeuse is a relatively neutral place. Its people are content, its crops healthy. A nice place to live.  In the past there was a scare in Joyeuse where young children were wandering away from home and disappearing. It started three years ago and didn't end for seven months. The children were never recovered, and the chief declared it an incident caused by beasts. Everyone knew he was wrong.  Hadriin is where the story starts. Rune, the main character, lives here. He has lived in this village for twelve years, brought here by a woman who was most likely his mother. She left him in the care of the village chief, but he ended up being raised mostly by a midwife and an old man named Rudrin. Mmm, enough about him. I have to save something for the character section.  This place is peaceful, but it knows past woes. Forty nine years ago a raid on the village left most of it burned down. Many died, souls of friends were lost. Some of the remains of that event are still visible. The culprits were never caught, so the search was eventually given up.  A place where everyone knows everyone else and life is as good as it gets without technology. Many books that hold years of information litter the hallways of every home. Family trees are dated way back to the Hadriin trail- when those who had chosen a simpler life migrated from Bageanti and Arlaoa to the three lesser villages in hopes of a freedom from science and the constant stressful search for technology and new uses for it. The people have not forgotten technology, but they choose to limit their use of it- thereby allowing themselves to be free of its constant use and temptation.  ----  Characters:  Rune- The main character. He is a young man whose exact age is unknown. Currently living in the village of Hadriin, he was brought here twelve years ago by a woman who was supposedly his mother. Not quite an amnesiac, he remembers he once lived in a very big city when he was younger. Possessing a bad memory and prone to spasms of zoning out, everyone around him can tell there is something wrong in his head. Skilled with a bow and arrow, he often joins hunts to bring the village food. He has good aim but an unsteady hand, leading to many last-second misses on smaller animals.  Raised by an elderly midwife, Margarite, and an aging man named Rudrin.  Mysterious woman- Rune's alleged mother. She came carrying the boy into the village twelve years ago, handing him to the village chief in hopes of a better life. Her eyes were filled with tears; dark circles showed she had not slept for many nights.  She stayed in Hadriin for only a week with her child before leaving without a word.  Rudrin- A wizened old man who arrived in Hadriin not long before Rune. No one has ever really inquired much about his past, as he is a kind and gentle man, providing humor when others are down. He took a liking to the young boy even as his mother still held him.  Possesses many books from all different eras. Trinkets and toys litter his home.  Spent more time raising Rune than anyone else. He is talented in that he is able to teach the boy things that stay with him for a long time; it was because of Rudrin that Rune is able to hunt at all with his shakey hands. Still, they are more friends than family.  Margarite- A kind midwife with a longing for children of her own, she was the foster mother of Rune for much of his life. She loves the boy as her own child, and he loves her back. Rune considers Margarite his mother, even though he remembers the voice of the woman who brought him to Hadriin.  Druminov- A drifter. He travels from town to town, constantly searching for something he does not know. Years of roaming the backroads and untamed paths have given him the experience and skill necessary to kill anything that crosses him- man and beast alike.  Yet for those who have met him, he seems an innocent fellow. He is usually resting in Dreaum when not out on the open road, leading to rumors that shadow him of deeds he may have done, crimes that he's committed. No truth has been confirmed in these tales... but none has been denied.  Dr. Makaveli Craus- A brilliant and renowned scientist who lives in the mega city of Bageanti. He is known the world over for such inventions and discoveries as the Skycruiser and Crop Harvester. A true friend to the people and planet.  Dr. Seibzhen- An infamous scientist who is known for his research and work on history and human evolution. Often brandished as a villain because of his mutilating human enhancement projects and experiments with cloning. A blight to the reputation of Bageanti and all of science itself. He was sent into exile in the untamed wilderness, stripped of all status and power. Staying near the outskirts of Bageanti, he was known as a madman to any and all who saw him; unkempt and constantly paranoid, he often wandered into the city as a shadow of his former self.  Disappeared when Dr. Craus rose to his current rank.  Kamalai (?)- A shadowy and strange figure who once appeared in Joyeuse. He claimed to be a hero working to find the lost children from three years ago, but has not been seen or heard from since.  Has recently been sighted near Hadriin.  -----  And so begins the story.

        urlLink http://www.ff12.com/music/index2.html   Three clips of some new tracks from the upcoming Final Fantasy XII.  Oh man, that series has still got it. The first sample sent chills up my spine. Does that not sound like Chrono Trigger or Xenogears with a little of the crystal theme tossed in? This is definitely my favorite of the three.  The second track has a distinct Final Fantasy Tactics feel. Beautiful. All those memories of the first FFT... wow, what an amazing game.  The third had some parts that reminded me of Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. The lower beats in it kind of made me think of the Bangaa.  This Final Fantasy may very well be the best one yet. With a revamped (and seemingly vastly improved) battle system and a storyline tying into the Tactics' Ivalice, this game will undoubtedly be outstanding. Phenomenal. The story... man, even the music is giving me chills already.  It's been promised to be the best looking Ps2 game ever. Heh. Doesn't look that way from the screenshots. But hey, as long as it's more consistent than FFX, I'll be happy. Besides, Final Fantasy's biggest draws for me have always been style, sound, and story. And man, it has always delivered.  With Yasumi Matsuno at the reigns and Hideo Minaba, Akihiko Yoshida, Isamu Kamikokuryu, and Nobuo Uemetsu backing him, this game may be one of the greatest tales ever.  urlLink  More info, for anyone interested.

      Know what? Screw everything I wrote before. I stumbled across a much more extensive preview today, and it covers all the main points. I think there was only one or two things I disagreed with in it, namely the flashlight and health readout. Bungie's said health is gone, but this guy seems to be in denial. I don't really feel like correcting him, so oh well. And the flashlight? Well, I haven't seen it yet. Have you? Has it been mentioned? Yes, it was. The white button is now team chat in multiplayer instead of flashlight. So why would the flashlight be gone from multiplayer? I think it isn't- the flashlight will now be weapon-specific. Remember how the AR and shotgun had lights on them? Well, yeah. I believe that in Halo 2 you'll have to find a weapon that has a light to be able to use it. Anyway, here's that writeup:   urlLink http://members.aol.com/duskywolf/private/halo2_guide.zip   After reading that, I have no idea how anyone would be able to deny Halo 2's glory. I'm salivating over it. Ewwy.

      As promised, here's the second half of Section One:  Chapter Four: Dead for Dinner  Shadowy figures discuss something in a dimly lit room. The walls glisten with a strange sheen, and one of the characters has a strange, commanding voice.  They agree on something, and the scene ends.  Switch to Chief and crew. Still heading for the comm signal's origin. They notice the bodies aren't as badly mangled here. There are a few trees and shrubs that haven't completely fallen yet. This gives them some hope, showing that the whole world might not have been obliterated.  John sees something sparkling in the distance, giving him chills. The sun doesn't show well through the clouds, making the light suspicious.  The marines complain about having to bring the Grunts along, calling the Earth "The Bad Lands", but Chief knows they are the only source of information he has. There is also a lack of food.  The marines go on and on saying they should stop to look for food, but John knows that nothing would be found. He tells them to set up camp for a rest.  The Grunts go to find more rebreathers, as the ones they are using have begun to run out of methane. The marines rest. Chief knows the group is getting close to whatever they are heading to. He can feel that.  Finally, the marine's bickering becomes to much to bear, and John yells at them. He blatantly tells them there isn't anything to eat but the charred bodies on the ground.  Of course, this statement is met with disgust by the marines and joy by the Grunts. Chief frowns at that irony. Most marines refuse to eat. John himself is not yet hungry enough to eat another human.  The Grunts dig in, causing the humans to hate them even more.  Switch to soldier who was underground. He now has struggled through the dirt and lies exhausted, staring at the roof of a cave.  After a few of his thoughts, he sits up. The voice he had heard before is all but forgotten, but the haunting feeling that he had to do something remains. He knows he has to survive.  Getting up, he finds some parts of his body covered in mud-caked armor, very thick. Moving to the edge of the cave, he is shocked by what he sees. There is lightning and thunder plowing through the skies over a vast wasteland. Crevices spouting lava have opened up. Huge waves splash onto a high rock wall far beneath him. Giant cyclones shape the landscape, flowing over anything with ease. Great gusts nearly knock him off his feet, and he finds that his hair is very long.  The sky is as it would be at dusk. He hears something deep within his mind:  "This is your world. This is your Twilight."  Knowing that he is the only hope left, he marches out of the cave with no memory of his past. He knew there was a battle, but that is all.  Switch back to the Chief. The camp is angry, upset, and frustrated. None of them seem to be getting along, and Manson's constant nagging doesn't help things.  John thinks about things, recalling the moments before he lost Cortana. He remembers some of his past, the Spartan training. He tries to remember his friends.  It's then that Manson begins to start a fight with Jeremiah. Manson isn't exactly a small guy. He's not particularly muscular, but he's not tiny, either. Rogers, on the other hand, is very scrawny.  Chief is snapped out of his trance by their argument. Well, it's mostly Manson's argument. Jeremiah isn't very aggresive. There's a group of marines that have formed around the conflict, and just as John is about to break it up, his shield starts to crackle.  Turning around, he sees a dark wave approaching very fast on the horizon. This obviously makes him kind of jumpy, and he yells for everyone to get down. After a moment of bewilderment, everyone panics. They see the wave and fall into any hole or ditch they can find. Manson still does to asshole bit and keeps pushing Rogers away. Finally, Jeremiah snaps. He dives at Manson and they both start wrestling.  Chief considers stopping them, but knows there isn't enough time. The amount of radiation in the coming wave was more powerful than anything he had ever seen.  It goes over them, silent. All noise is lost. Jeremiah was standing up, the top half of his body engulfed in it. Manson was on the ground, but very close to it.  John feels the heat, even through his suit. The pressure is almost lethal. He screams along with all the others, out of sheer agony.  To them, it seems to last forever. A bending ray of dark and light, flowing endlessly above them. None of them can watch, but they feel it. They can imagine what it must look like.  The entire plain is engulfed, and then it fades, rushing off into the distance.  Sand and dirt is all that's left.  Chapter Five: SPF 5,000,000,000  The sound of an agonizing scream is what wakes John up. The ringing in his ears only grows as he tries moving. His entire body is stiff.  Cracks in his MJOLNIR armor let in sand, which doesn't make him very comfortable. A light blanket of soil has covered up the entire camp. Groggily, he struggles to get up. Brushing dirst off his visor, he sees the entire "Bad Lands" has turned a lighter shade. It's no longer a horrible, dark bog. Now it's almost white, a creamy, sandy color. The bodies have mostly been covered.  The sky above is a little brighter. Behind, it is full of fire. Ahead, only darkness.  Turning his attention to the constant screaming, he sees Manson has survived. This day just keeps getting better.  The marine's skin is red; he has been burned horribly. It's the worst case of sunburn John's ever seen. No wonder he's screaming. Nothing he says comes out coherently.  Chief looks around for the others. He finds some had already woken up, and were wandering about, waiting for death. Most are gone.  One surviving marine finds Jeremiah's body. It's a sickening sight. The top half was completely separated from the bottom. It almost looked microwaved. His skin had been dried, pulling up tight. His eyes were bulging, and his teeth froze in some sort of unholy grin.  Gathering the survivors, two of which are Grunts, he is about to head off once more. When a couple of marines go to pick up Manson, they realize his skin is still extremely affected. Their hands blister the moment they touch him.  Seeing that the radioactivity has not faded, John warns them to use something so they don't have to touch him. Fashioning restraints out of whatever remains they can find, they tie him up and take him along, despite his thrashing.  Switch to dark area. Two menacing voices threaten each other. They resound with wisdom and fierce authority.  One ends the conflict by saying it's time to go.  Back to Chief. He thinks about the current situation. Many lives have been lost. He wonders what he's still going on for. Those who sent that transmission probably didn't survive that second wave.  His entire life has been for humanity. He's used to taking orders. Now he's alone. He's the one in charge. It's tough.  The Grunts talk about the Survival being narrowed down. Only the most worthy will survive. Their trust in John is growing.  The soldiers march into the dark part of the sky. John sees a familiar looking structure, similar to the ones on Halo. This is where the light he saw before had come from. Knowing some answers must lie there, he goes forth.  Chapter Six: Best Friends Forever  The soldiers find the station admist a field completely unaffected by the waves. They know something about that is strange.  John cautions the others. They don't know what lies within the structure.  Exploring the outside yields nothing useful, so Chief leads the way in. Two marines stay with Manson outside.  Definitely a Forerunner building. John has the nagging feeling he's being watched, but sees nothing that might be dangerous. This is probably the safest place anyone could be.  Hoping that no Covenant are here, he explores. The group splits up, taking extra care to not lose each other. John heads into the heart of the structure after a brief look around.  He's surprised to find a lot of machines intact. Many things are still running fairly undamaged from wear over the years.  Suddenly he hears a yell, followed by a squeal from a Grunt. He rushes to find out what's going on.  He heads lower into the facility, only to find a giant hologram spanning a massive room. In the center is a blue data block, some kind of uber-mega computer. Standing next to it are a marine and a Grunt. Their faces are nonplussed. Chief is horrified.  The characters' blank stares only amplify the fear John had after noticing the ground at their feet was strewn with skeletons, all of different species.  He realizes at that moment that they must get out of that place as fast as possible. Yet, something tempts him to touch that data block. Something is calling him to it.  Entranced, his mind begins to be absorbed by the stream of information within that place. The Grunt and the human smile, not remembering any language. All that is left in them is the knowledge that the machine chose for them to know- that all thoughts must meld into that place.  Chief is suddenly brought back to his senses by an explosion that rocks the entire installation. He gasps, realizing what was happening. Some of the knowledge that machine possessed had been transferred into him when he pulled away. It lets out its equivalent of a scream of rage as he stares in terror before darting away.  The Grunt and the marine stare at each other, unmoving. The dumb smiles on their faces remain.  Chief rushes outside, using the screams of the others as guidance. When he makes it outside he is again knocked back by another predicament.  Manson's body has begun to swell up. His skin is stretching at an extremely rapid rate.  The marines watching over him have no idea what is going on. Chief can't get them to give him any straight answers. It seems something attacked them, but they don't know what it might have been.  The Grunt that remains says the big scary thing is back.  Apparently Manson was hit by something when that thing attacked them. Whatever it was, it had left, but now Manson was growing bigger and bigger, screaming all the while.  It took John only a moment to sort out his thoughts. Manson was a living, breathing nuclear bomb.  The Chief yells at the others to run as far away as possible. Manson cries out. No one would deserve what he goes through.  As everyone runs away, one marine falls and injures his ankle- no doubt the stress has finally gotten to him. Chief turns and starts running back. Manson keeps on growing.  Just as John dives to the fallen marine, Manson explodes. Light engulfs the Chief.  Change to a place full of light. Chief is dreaming. He remembers something. He doesn't know what it is, but it gives him a feeling that hope is left.  His mind wanders.  Back to his physical body. Chief slowly wakes up, sore from the explosion. His armor is scorched, his shield definitely disabled. He feels like he is burned, but nothing too serious.  In his hand, Chief holds a disembodied hand. The man he had tried to save was gone, disintegrated into that explosion.  If not for his shield, he would have suffered the same fate.  As he gets up from the sandy grave he had been dug, he sees the crater the explosion had left. For some reason, the lives of the other survivors just didn't seem to matter to him anymore. Something much more important was calling for him. He could feel it.  Suddenly, a powerful limb reaches out and knocks him down. John rolls onto his side, winded. His shield doesn't activate, and his armor is already cracked.  For a moment, his eyes are a blur. What had just attacked him? His ribs burn as he struggles to get back up.  Another blow, from behind. He feels his ribs crack as he is flung forward. Whatever is trying to kill him is very powerful.  Surprised, and very pissed off, John jumps to avoid another attack and grabs onto the "tentacle" that had come at him. It was made of metal.  He turns himself around and comes to face his attacker. It's a huge behemoth of steel, vaguely reminiscent of his own armor. Only a lot bigger.  Chief pushes himself away and the two fight.  After a brief struggle, the enemy finally gains the upper hand. Chief is forced against a wall, being choked.  At the very end, just before passing out, he sees the face of the pilot for a moment as the glare on its visor is toned down by a shadow.  It is his best friend, Sam.  ----  Agh, section two will be up soon. If anything confuses anyone, just get in touch with me and I'll explain it.

      Right, as I said in my last blog, I'm not going to finish this. Sorry for anyone who was reading it, but I can't put the time needed into writing the whole thing before November.  If anyone wants to use any ideas, that's fine by me. That's why I'm sharing this. I couldn't finish it, but maybe someone else could.  Anyway, here it goes:  Section One: Exodus  Chapter One: Intro  This is the beginning, of course. The view of the soldiers, along with the Master Chief, are described. It is dusty and bleak. Many bodies are scattered along the flat plain, which was once a rolling hillside covered in a thick forest.  The marines trudge on, not knowing if they are the only survivors. Everyone but the Chief believes this was the Covenant's final strike, a trump card used because the battle had suddenly become tilted in favor of the humans.  Describe Manson, a haphazard marine with a cocky attitude and short fuse. He doesn't much like John, who is equally annoyed by the marine.  Many bodies are so badly mangled that it is impossible to differentiate  between alien and man.  Ends with the Chief allowing his men to set up camp. He tries to raise morale, but because he has the nagging feeling that the Covenant did not cause this, he has a hard time even keeping himself upright.  Chapter Two: Break  Zachary Channels is the only known marine who witnessed the incident without passing out before hand or dying. He tries clearing his mind, but as sleep takes him he begins to recall the horror.  Change to camp scene. John continually searches comm channels for any sign of survivors, but to no avail. Some soldiers sleep, others stare at the camp fire while playing cards over a supply pack. Manson is one of the poker players.  John almost gives up hope, but searches through the channels one more time.  Switch to dream sequence. Channels remembers the battle he had been involved in. He had been assigned as a sniper scout by a gruff sergeant.  He snipes at a Covenant brigade from the elevated base of a mountain. The mountain is pocketed with dozens of caves, and he finds one perfect for his use.  Taking out the top-ranking Elites, he causes chaos at the Covenant side. A new leader is chosen for them, and they continue marching.  Suddenly the sky begins darkening rapidly. Both the human and Covenant forces are bewildered. Channels watches as their bodies begin to be ripped apart by a sudden powerful force in the atmosphere.  He cries out as the sergeant almost reaches the safety of the mountain base in a Warthog. End scene when the sergeant explodes, his head knocking out Channels when it flies into him.  Back to camp scene. Chief continues searching comms.  Manson has begun to start a ruckus at the makeshift poker table. Chief ignores it at first, but after the marines begin to fight, he is frustrated.  Before he is able to stop them, he picks up a pre-recorded comm signal asking for assistance. It is badly garbled, but makes mention of an AI. With it, he is able to attain its point of origin. He tells the marines, they begin to clear camp, and the chapter ends.  Chapter Three: Remnants  Begin with a soldier trapped in darkness, unable to move.  The soldier slips in and out of consciousness, hearing a voice within his head. The voice warns that the battle has not yet started, and commands the soldier to survive.  Immediately, the soldier reaches his hand out and finds himself to be buried underground. Struggling to free himself, he almost gives up as he pushes with all his strength and finally breaks through.  Go to Channels. A soldier wakes him up. At first he is startled, but regains his sense quickly.  He is notified a signal has been picked up by the Spartan. The marines clear up camp.  Switch to John and his group. They are still wandering, heading towards the comm's origin. John himself is getting nervous because of the random blips on his motion radar. He also begins to think he is hearing things, but hopes it is only stress getting to him.  The marines seem to sense his anxiety, and are equally on edge.  Suddenly, John realizes they are being watched. He stops, and warns the marines to huddle together. They all know they don't have much ammo left, and any fight would most likely be futile.  Waiting for a moment, John listens intently. There is wind howling. A rustling sound.  Then a Jackal jumps out from behind a smoldering log, plasma firing. The startled marines begin firing away, despite John's yelling to stop. The Spartan then realizes just how exhausted these men must be, and he struggles to help one of them aim correctly to shoot the alien.  Just as the Chief is about to kill the alien, a swarm of green bolts fly into it from both sides.  In a shocking development, there is a rabble of Grunts that have formed around the marines, apparently confused and afraid. They whisper amongst themselves, and the marines' eyes dart nervously back and forth. Chief eases a bit, wondering if these aliens mean harm.  Dropping his gun, Chief slowly moves towards the aliens. They slink back, cowardly. Chief sees that they are too bewildered to attack.  Chief tries showing them he doesn't mean harm. The other marines don't trust the aliens for even a second. Normally, even John would be wary of these creatures, but this was not a normal situation.  The Grunts cautiously ease up to John, holding their weapons very anxiously. One of them walks up to him and touches his leg, then quickly darts away. Chief, knowing they wouldn't dare attack, does not let himself be bothered.  Finally, the aliens gather around the Spartan and admire his stature. He has a built-in translator, so he can tell they don't quite trust him. Still, he is able to pick out words that would seem to mean that they wanted to stay with the group.  The make mention of "The Twilight" and "Survivors". They seem to be amazed and rather pissed off that the humans are "The Survivors". They try explaining to Chief that the Prophets had taught that when the Twilight occured, only those that had joined the Covenant would survive. These humans were the first sign of life the Grunts had seen since then, meaning the Covenant religion was a lie.  Chief tries using a newly-installed human to Covenant translator, courtesy of Cortana, and he questions the aliens. Finding out that this was caused by a Halo installation did not surprise him.  He also finds out about "big scary things" that had attacked and scouted throughout a Covenant camp shortly before the incident, but does not know what it could mean.  Again, cryptic AI references. The Grunts will explain no more. They are still afraid.  Despite the marines' disputing, John allows the Grunts to trudge along with them. He knows that it might lead to more trouble in the end, but these creatures did not seem particularly bright or hostile.  As they continue on, John feels a growing emptiness within his mind. Hoping he is making the right choice, the chapter ends.  -----  Well, I'll try to finish up the storyline of the rest of section one tomorrow. There are two more sections, so it might take a few days to type them all up.

      Well, it's been a while since I posted anything in the Xanga, and quite frankly, Xanga is boring. Doesn't Blogger just look nicer? Yes, yes it does.  So, anyway, what's been going on with me? Well, not much. My skin is so pale now from not going outside that anyone could tell that I haven't been doing anything.  I'm so used to going on vacations in the summer. This year, though, my dad bought an apartment complex that  he's going to try to rent out. That brings us to have an apartment building, an empty old bar, and three houses in addition to the one we're living in. Lucky us. And even luckier is whoever gets the mortgage money.  So, there have been a few things I've been up to. For one, I've been using the treadmill a whole lot. Last night I went to bed at five in the a.m. after 5 miles on that thing. Why? I guess because I don't do anything else. This is just an easy way to make sure I don't get all loose and flabby.  I still do the sit-ups, but I suppose the fact remains that I have no abs. I've been trying to build up muscle for four years, but still nothing. Sure, I might have a strong stomach, but nothing actually shows.  I can do 35 push ups now! OMG! And the next day my arms hurt.  Lately I've been posting on forums like crazy. For those of you in the know, ilovebees consumed me for a while. I've retired from that. It was boring. It kept me up too late. Really, I'd never be able to figure it out. I don't even know why I tried.  I still haven't finished Xenogears. The last boss is just too tough. I mean, if you actually know the story, this shouldn't even be a fight you'd be able to win, no matter how strong you are. See, you have all sorts of mega-ultra-super powers to unleash, but it really doesn't matter. This thing rips you apart.  I finished Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay again. Awesome game. Awesome. If you have an X Box, play it. If you don't, buy one so you can play it. The top shooters of '04: Far Cry Escape from Butcher Bay Doom III Half Life 2 Halo 2  So cool. Fable comes out soon. I wonder how long that'll keep my attention.  In other news, I still haven't really done anything worthwhile. It seems to me that a lot of people are complaining that they're bored or that they don't have anything to do. Well know what? I am the epiphany of boredom. I literally never leave the house except for work. I don't call people, no one calls me. I only have 32 people on my AIM buddy list, and I don't even talk to half of them. Does this mean I don't have any friends? I don't know. Maybe.  I've been meaning to start re-learning Greek again. If me and the dudes are going to head to Kefalonia after Senior year, we're going to need at least one person to help translate. If we go to Athens, it'll be completely necessary to have someone who knows the crazy-ass Greek lingo. Still, the island is a tourist place. Last time I went most people sounded like they were from England. Oh man, I'm excited already.  I don't think I'm going to finish my Halo 2 story. I got a little ways into chapter 3, and then I realized just how long it'd take to finish it. There's no way I'd be able to do it before November. I wanted it to fit into Halo's story. If Halo 2 changes up that story from what we know, my fiction will become absolutely useless. So I'll probably type up my storyboards sometime. Maybe in my next blog.  So far the only movie I've seen this summer is Spiderman 2. Sure, it was a great movie, but I've missed out on a lot. Ah, well, that's what usually happens to me. I slack off too much and lose whatever I wanted to do. Meh.  I've also been trying out so strategy RPGs online, namely Dark Throne and Kings of Chaos. I haven't really been paying much attention to either. Dark Throne just doesn't grab my attention too much, and KoC is way too slow-paced. There's also another game called Kingdom of Loathing, and I've been spending a lot of time with that. I'm currently a level 4 Disco Bandit. A Jiggy Grifter. Heh heh, the game is funny. What other game has you fighting possessed cans of asparagus and a troll who barbeques nipples?  I got a surround sound thing for my TV downstairs, so I've been reliving some old games. Halo is brilliant with the bass turned up. Brr-ap Brr-ap.  Is there honestly anything I can do to jumpstart the rest of my summer? I've been neglecting friends. I've been ignoring a lot of people. I don't clean my room. I haven't all summer. Is there something wrong with that?  Maybe I just don't live well without something to do. I don't like that fact, but even Joe saw how pathetic I am right now. He came over bearing gifts of wheat and barley (well, corn and melon, actually), and stood witness to my obsession with this little thing I call "my computer".  I always figured I'd be able to do what I want when I wanted to. I must've assumed wrong. Right now I do absolutely nothing. I'm either sleeping, working, or typing. My eyes hurt, I'm always tired, and at work I'm miserable. Ugh.  The other dishwasher from work quit, and guess who gets to replace him. Yeah, me! How lucky! Now I get to work every day!  We might go to Canada again before the summer's over, but to be honest, I really don't want to. What I want is to go to the beach or something and just hang out with some friends. That I may or may not have.  I've never been a very socially-inclined person. I don't know why. Am I boring? Am I shy? Am I just plain strange? Why is it that I can't just be like everyone else? While all the rest of the world is trying to be different, I'm trying to figure out how to be the same.  School starts on the 26th. Ilovebees ends (?) on the 24th. That might give me a good two days of fun, assuming a Halo 2 demo is released.  Yeah, I'm boring. That's got to be it.
