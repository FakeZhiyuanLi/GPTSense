      The funny thing is, when I told Isaac I was going to New York City, his first reaction was similar to what's been running through mine all week...you know, the old Pace Picante Sauce commericials with all the cowboys eating around the campfire, and someone introduces a new "hot" sauce, and they don't like it, so they look at the label and say "This stuff's made in New York City!!" and the whole bunch says, together, "NEW YAWRK CITY!??!?!" and go after the new guy.  His first reaction was "NEW YAWRK CITY!!" which is what I've been saying all week.   So I'm off to said non-picante place, and I'm excited, dangitall!!!  I just won't try the hot sauce.

      ...I don't have a whole lot to say, but I'm writing anyway.&nbsp; This should NOT&nbsp; become a pattern, but it is kind of fun.  Right now, I'm lamenting the fact that I'm VERY full, and I have an entire chocolate pie in the freezer that I REALLY want a piece of.  *sigh*  Oh yeah, and the Fullerton Revenue Patrol are now up there with the dentists.

      That's me impersonating a dial-up network dialing up.&nbsp; I hate dial-up, especially since we had DSL at home.&nbsp; Dial-up networkers and dentists will go to the same level of hell.&nbsp; I'm not sure what level they'll be on, since neither were invented when Dante wrote...maybe they'll be in there witn the traitors against mankind.&nbsp; Wherever they are, though, they'll be there.&nbsp; The dentists will have their teeth perpetually drilled without novocaine (or maybe they'll alternate no novocaine with making them so numb they can't move their heads...).&nbsp; The dial-up people will have to try to load an infinitely large website on their computers connected by...yeah, you guessed it...a dial-up network.  The more I read in this, the more I think that I shouldn't post when I'm tired.&nbsp; Really.&nbsp; Look at me stopping.  I got to see Sellis and Matthew today...I don't know why that makes me so excited, but it does.&nbsp; For some reason, I really wanted to see them, and I got to today and I get to tomorrow.&nbsp; How lucky can one girl be??!!?!  Oh yeah, and Jess and Adam had their baby.&nbsp; Brigid Elizabeth (Snell).&nbsp; BEE_YOOUU_TEEEE_FUUULLLL&nbsp; (I first wrote "_FUUUKKKK," which I think is funny).&nbsp; What a doll.

      ...or not.&nbsp; Actually, I feel tired.&nbsp; Quite tired, since my body thinks it's almost 11.&nbsp; Timechanges suck.&nbsp;   I don't have much to say.&nbsp; I'm mostly wasting time until my laundry is done.&nbsp; If I harnessed all the time I spent waiting for laundry, I could get so much done.&nbsp; Too bad I can't put it all into one larger timeslot.&nbsp; Now that....THAT would be cool.&nbsp; Actually, I wish I could do that with all my little smidgens of time that I find here or there...put it together into functional chunks.&nbsp;   I always wonder if time is part of the curse that God put on man...not that it exists, but something about the way we view it, or use it.&nbsp; I'm not quite sure what I'm getting at, except that I know I'm getting at something important.&nbsp; I hate it when I dance around something and can't get to it.&nbsp; Oh well...maybe tomorrow.  Maybe it's  stress  that's of the fall.

       urlLink    Look what I found!!!  Posted by  urlLink Hello    So, I learned how to post pictures here ;)&nbsp; This one is just so much fun that I had to have it on my blog.&nbsp; Look at the guy's eyes...he look ill or possessed or...drunk, I guess.&nbsp; What fun.&nbsp; I was randomly on some Celtic music website, found this pic, drug my cursor over it, and found I could copy it...so I did.&nbsp; Duh.  I have to pack today.&nbsp; SCARY!!!&nbsp; I always forget how much work packing is...you know, washing dirty clothes (or keeping them separate from the others, which is just way too hard).&nbsp; So off I go.  My foray against the dentists was pathetic.&nbsp; I lost.&nbsp; Big time.&nbsp; That's why I call you (yes, you!) to join my little crusade.

      Before I say anything else, I should admit that I shamelessly stole the title for this post from a student paper I got the first year I taught.&nbsp; I gave her full credit for the title...what else could I do, when it made me laugh in the middle of a HUGE stack of term papers.  &nbsp;  I feel AAARRRGGHHHHH!!!! today.&nbsp; I have now deemed AAARRRGGHHHHH an emotion.&nbsp; It means, I feel like nothing is going quite right today.&nbsp; AAARRRGGHHHHH!!!!&nbsp; Try it; it feels great, I promise.  &nbsp;  For anyones future reference, I do NOT want anyone to work on my teeth.&nbsp; Ever.&nbsp; Too bad life is full of things where I don't get what I want.&nbsp; I hate mouth pain.&nbsp; I hate getting shots in my mouth.&nbsp; I hate the sound of the drill.&nbsp; I hate the fact that I have a particularly sensitive mouth.&nbsp; I could go on, but I won't bore you.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  We should unite against dentists.&nbsp; The profession of "dentist" must be destroyed.&nbsp; We must come up with technology that will keep our teeth perfectly healthy and make it available to the masses free of charge.&nbsp; We must make this world a better place!!!  &nbsp;   Will you join in my crusade,    Who will be strong and stand with me.    Out beyond the barricade,    Is there a world you long to see?   &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Look at me...I'm going to test this whole "posting by email" thing AND be controversial all at the same time.  Bam!  Thud!  Thud!  TWO birds, ONE bullet.  Or something like that.  So dad and I had breakfast together this morning, and we ended up talking about the whole new-earth/old-earth creation debate.  My big question about the whole thing is, why don't all these people get over themselves?  I mean, BAM!!!, God created.  What more do we need?  My bet is that we couldn't understand how long it took him to do so if we tried (well, we are trying, and we don't understand; at least, we don't agree at all).  I think it's one of those cases of transposition that Jack talks about in his essay (amazingly, called "Transposition").  I mean, I think God probably created in some way that we can't understand and the best way Moses could write it down is using the word "day".  Do I have evidence...well, not scientific, but then again, science isn't all it's cracked up to be anyway (which is another controversial topic that I'll maybe talk about another day, if I feel like it then).  It just makes sense to me.  God seems so very much BIGGER than this debate.  And creation is a supreme case of supernatural having to translate into (and through, for that matter) natural.  So it seems likely that the reality is something much, much greater than we can understand.  But this doesn't really matter (though what would this position be called...we have new earth and old earth...what would this be, the how-the-hell-do-I-know earth position?).  What matters is that God created.  He CREATED.  He came down in such a massive (and yet such a small, if you think about all of him, or try to) way.  I mean, if you think about it, he revealed himself to us before he created us, by making us an earth to live on.  How cool is that!!!  When I look at that, how can I argue about HOW or WHEN he created it.  He created it!!!  That's what's so awesome.  So enough beating around the bush.  Go out, and enjoy creation, and try to see the hand of God in it.  Now, dang it!!!

      Why do people always worry about me when I want to be alone?  Why do they always think that, somehow, I should really really really want to go run errands with them, or whatever it is that they're doing?  Sorry, the grocery store is just NOT my favorite place to be.  Sorry.  I'd much rather sit here, with my book and my computer and my music, an djust kick back for a little while.  Really. REALLY.  I'm not ill, or crazy, or depressed, just...quiet, I guess.  At least for today.

       urlLink nevawinternight's Xanga Site   These have got to the the coolest words ever to fall into the "what-I-told-my-6-year-old-brother-on-his-deathbed" category.  Don't think I mock the pain, but the words are awesome.  I can see Gabriel and Jack (and Angie, for that matter) sitting together over tea, discussing the finer points of Aslan.  Joy to you, Gabriel-the-Younger.

      Sometimes I just want to scream.  Literally.  Why does my growing seem to entail hurting some people more?  Why are they only willing to see growth when it comes in certain areas?  Why do they not see my changing as growth when it means more conflict with them?  I know the answer...the answer is sin.  I would just like to go on the record as saying that sin sucks.  It just does.  Sucks the big one, as we used to say in Jr. High or High School or whenever it was.  Sometimes I feel like all of my interactions are poisoned because of my and other's sin.  Some days, I'd rather drink arsenic.  Not that I want to die, but it's a much more direct and obvious way of killing yourself and, since I feel like I'm doing just that anyway, I'd rather drink arsenic (do you drink arsenic or do you eat it...some mystery writer I would be).  Sin is so devious, so twisted...it's like a fog, sometimes, that won't let me see things in any sort of perspective, and I end up walking off the edge of the cliff without ever knowing I left solid ground.  Then I'm suddenly falling, and I don't know why.  And I don't even know if it's my sin or someone else's.  Like I said, if I'm going to die, I'd rather drink arsenic and have it over with.    Why do I feel so unfree in my family?  Chained?  Boxed in?  I'm sick of expectations.  The more free I feel like I am, the more I run into other's expectations.  And I don't know how to avoid that.  Am I supposed to not care?  But I DO care...I care when people are hurting and I don't want them too...but I'm no longer as willing to eat dirt so that they don't.  I have expectations, too, and no one seems to care about those.  Mine are unreasonable.  Theirs are totally reasonable.  Of course, and I'm just supposed to go along with this.  Uh-huh, yeah.  Watch me.  Bite me.   Is one supposed to say that to one's family?  I don't know, but it's cathartic.   Bite me, bite me, bite me!!!

      Gabe died this morning.  I haven't talked to Renee yet, but a friend of hers posted it on Bubbs.  I don't know how she knew...maybe they were all on AOL or something.  But he died.  I don't know what happened to make it go so fast...I heard two weeks on Thursday, then I woke up and checked email this morning and read that Renee had posted yesterday that he was really bad and probably wouldn't last the weekend, and then Holly's post that he died this morning.    I'm sure it's better this way, not having him lay there suffering for another week or two...and I'm sure it's easier overall on his family, not having to watch so much.  God is merciful.  Yet a little light went out in the world this morning.  Even still, the darkness will not win.  Gabe's death makes the cause of light stronger, because it was so clearly wrong.  It was so clear that a 6-year old who was full of life and love and wings (Cummings will forgive me, I think) should NOT be dying, should not have to suffer so much, and that the family who loved him, who had taken him into their homes and their hearts should not then have to watch helplessly as he was slowly wrenched away.  So Gabe, in his unique way, has strengthened Light this morning, because who wouldn't fight against this?  I keep thinking about dying that young and whether it's a good or a bad thing.  I mean, Gabe missed so much.  He missed so many moments of joy and wonder and happiness and light, but he also missed moments of pain, of betrayl and hurt and competition.  It's mixed.  Everything about life is, I'm noticing.  I think it would be better for him to have lived...that's what he was created to do...but then again, death is the end of life...and his just came faster.  So I really don't know.  And there's a let down in this death already, even for me.  Sure, the next week will be full and difficult, but what then?  How will they find meaning in the everyday tasks when they've spent so much in time, energy, and effort in loving Gabriel for the last 7-8 months?  How will Renee go back to school?  How will Mike leave home?    So many questions.  Too many questions (now it's Robert Redford who must forgive).  But they all have answers.  If I didn't believe that, I'd lose my mind.

      More on Gabe...I really can't get the kid off my mind.  And his family.  Renee said yesterday that they have no more than 2 weeks with him, thus said the hospice nurse.  And Gabe wants to die.  But I said that already.  They're hurting so incredibly badly.  It's horrible, and no one can do anything about it.  And no one can do anything for them.  I know this breaks God's heart.  I know that he would not have Gabe suffer, that he would not have them all suffer, and that he's holding them all right now.  But they don't know that, or at least, Renee doesn't.  She's going to be so incredibly lonely next year--Gabe dies, and Mike goes off to school, and she's left in an empty house with parents who are grieving.    Isaac is reading the book   Death Be Not Proud, about a boy with terminal brain cancer.  I took one look at it and said, "I don't need to read that; I could write it."  And I could, I think.  I'm sure the book is wonderful, but the thought of reading something like that right now is a little overwhelming.  I know real people who are dying, real people with cancer, real people who are suffering.  I don't need to read about fictional ones (though this is a true story, so I guess that's not quite right).  Lord God, have mercy on your child Gabriel, whatever that means right now.  Comfort his little heart, and comfort the hearts of those who are with him, watching, with him, for the moment where you will come and take him and he will be with you.  Give them all peace, and the joy of these last moments, before eternity, where they will all be together.  And welcome Gabriel into your kingdom in your perfect time, where he can run and jump and shoot waterguns again.  Amen.

      ...looks like Gabriel is on his last legs.  Literally.  He can't walk anymore, and sometimes he lays in bed crying because he wants to die so badly.  I think it's really cool that his parents seem to be telling him that he'll be able to run and play again in heaven, but it's so sad that it makes him want to die because he can't do it all now.  It's so hard to be watching him die through others' pictures and words; I can't imagine what it must be like to be with him day in and day out.  I'm sure it's wonderful and beautiful and glorious in some ways, and one of the worst feelings in the world in others.  Times like this, I'm glad I'm not God.  I'm glad I don't have to know if it's better for Gabe and his family if he dies quickly or slowly.  I know that God is so much more than I that this isn't a burden on him but....well, I don't know "but what," but I know there's a "but something" inside of me.    Sweet, well-loved Gabriel!!!  May heaven be so much more than you ever asked or imagined (well, that's a safe blessing, I think)

      "Badly done, Emma.  Badly done indeed."  If you don't know where that came from, you don't deserve to know ;)  I watched almost the entire movie on Monday, and had to leave, right before the end.   Why do I always want chocolate chip cookies for breakfast?  For that matter, why hasn't Jenn's baby come yet?  Poor Jenn.  Come out, come out, wherever you are...olly, olly, all's in free...open Sesame!!??!?   Ali Baba had dem forty thieves; Scherezadie had dem thousand tales ...  Yay for free association.
