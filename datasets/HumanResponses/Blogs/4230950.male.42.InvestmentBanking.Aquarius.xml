						   To move the grain project forward it has been necessary to start a new company entity so we could leave the non-performing Directors of AGF to their own devices.  The team will be lead by Mr. Paul Rix as Chairman of the Board and Mr. Darryl Young as CEO of the company. Both men have a wealth of experience in their respective fields and together should develop into a force to be reckoned with.  Mr. John Rivett will be Director/Secretary and his firm will manage the share register.  Documents are currently being prepared to contract them to the venture.  The firms Auditors will be Allstate partners who are the Auditors for Alternative Lending Australia Ltd

						   Over the weekend I completed the investment summary for the first capital raising. This is an excluded offer under Australian law that is made to less than twenty investors in a 12 month period and only to investors that have asked to be informed of such offers.  The first offering is to raise AUD$200,000.00 to pay for the initial research into the grains industry and define the financial structures the company is going to use.

						   Ploutos Grain Management is the culmination of the Australian Grains Fund project started some time ago. VVC has identified a management team, Board of Directors and an acquisition that should allow the project to move to a satisfactory conclusion.  Our aim is a Newcastle Stock Exchange listing in the first half of next year.  The team to date is Chairman Paul Rix, CEO/Director Darryl Young, Director Gary FitzGerald, Secretary/Director John Rivett.  A website will be created in the next 90 days and cv's of all relevant people will be posted on the site.

       urlLink ECPG - Stock Research - InvestorGuide.com   This is the website of a US company which buys debt. ALA is planning similar activities.  We are now awaiting the arrival of our loan insurance agreement so that our prospectus can be lodged.

      GST has raised its ugly head in our acquisition of a AUD$6ml loan book. GST has the ability to increase our acquisition cost by 10% and cause a cashflow problem for the vendor.  It is times like these that having professional advisers available make all the difference, Craig West from Platinum Consulting and Scott Allen from Fusion Coporate were able to suggest moving forward on the loan book by way of a joint venture structure and we are now back on track.

      I am in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia today and spent the day meeting with the firm's investment bankers.  It was a great day, the investment bank is extremely happy with the structure we have put together and introduced me to a very important investor/client of theirs. They have verbally approved a number of other products such as 2nd mortgages that ALA will be able to finance.  In Singapore we have secured in principle agreement from a group of private investors to fund the companies expansion should we grow faster than planned.

      Hi,  ALA shareholders will hopefully be able to access almost real time information on their company. I am hoping that this weblog technology will enable myself and other Directors to post information and correspondence immediately for shareholders information.  Please keep in mind that we are testing things here so any feedback is greatly appreciated. I will not be using this forum to answer questions however if I get enough questions on a certain topice I will answer them on an FAQ page attached to the website
