       Thanks for visiting, as you've probably noticed the blog on this page is new. Basicaly most people noticed the old one was working pretty badly, features didn't work etc.. so I've tried this new one. Thanks for everyone who E-Mailed me asking when I'd update the blog again, actually didn't think people still read it! Anyway, this is the new blog and I've updated the other pages of the website as well. Its still in a bit of a teething process, so if you find any problems with it please drop me a line from the contact page. Cheers!

       Yup, I watch too much Friends. I'm boooooored! So so bored. So so so so so boooooooored! First up, I'd like to apoligise for my (lack of) punctuation in my first entry. Obviously it just wasn't up to standard, and I've been told off about it (*glares*), so I'll only be using my best grammar skills from now on... Hmmm so not much happened today. Had a lie in, took a shower (I'm starting to take them in the morning, like normal people do), then went round to my good friend Gemma's. She lured me round with the offer of fit builder men, but it turned out to be two old, short, fat, balding men, who spent more time drinking tea than they did building the wall *sigh* But it was fun, we had a laugh. I've just finished reading my book, called 'Are you Dave Gorman?'. It was fantabulous (WEEEEEE Slither has just come on the radio!!) to be honest, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone. It's about a bloke, Dave, and his mate, Danny, and as the result of a drunken bet they bugger off around the world to find 54 Dave Gormans. It's a true story, and helluva funny, so you should all go read it. NOW! I love this song so much heh. Open day at De Montfort Uni tomorrow. I don't particularly want to go there, but hey, its a day off college. Dunno what I want to do after sixth form really. I think I wanna do some travelling - there's a big cat animal sanctuary in Tampa Bay (USA) that I'd love to volunteer at, but meh, who knows.. I'd rather volunteer doing something I love than make money doing something I hate. But I obviously need money to travel. And then I guess maybe I'd like to do some kind of Animal Science degree at a local college. I dunno really. But then that's limiting me to working with animals all my life, which I'm 99% sure I'm gonna want to do, but I have no way of knowing how I'm gonna feel years down the line. Grr. I have all these ideas floating about in my little Ali brain and it's just too confusing.. LOL you know those crappy adverts you get in the middle of programmes on ITV for like Claims Direct and such like? Well ones just come on and my next-door-but-one neighbour is on it lol. *puts on phoney voice* I was driving along when suddenly I was met with a head-on collision. doosh! *mimes how she crashed into the windshield* Hehe. Bless her.  Nobody at all in the world will have just found that story even remotely interesting lol. Do i use 'lol' too much? Sometimes I have to stop myself from actually saying it out loud instead of laughing lol. Now that's sad. Heh I just used it again! I think maybe it's time for me to sign off now and go find something productive to do. Not that this isn't productive, but y'know, I've wrote loads and I can't spend forever having a debate with myself about whether I use 'lol' too much. Oooh, my sympathies to Tim Henman before I go. Poor lil' guy. And also HAPPY BIRTHDAY to Lydz! Lub (yes, lub) you sweetie! Thats all for now kids. Peace Out. In a bit =p xx

       Ok so I originaly planned this post to be a list of bands and music artists that I really hate, but the more I thought about it, I thought it would be better if it was like room 101. For those not farmilliar with the concept, basically you decide on a few things that you could gladly see banished from the face of the Earth never to be seen again. Now don't flame me down if you like something that I'm putting in room 101, its merely my own opinion! So in no particular order...  Fat people - Ok now that sounds really controversial but it's not actually that bad. Let me explain. I'm quite fat myself, I know a few fat people, I get on great. Now the only fat people I don't like are the ones that whines about being fat but do NOTHING about it. Basically I was thinking earlier about different diets, the Atkins Diet and all these special diets. I'm not saying that they don't work, but I remember how I lost quite a bit of my weight, and I'm sure I did it the same way generations before me did. I realized my pie hole was bigger than my arse hole, and I stopped eating silly food in silly amounts! Couple that with actually getting some decent exercise and you get somewhere. I'm not saying you need to go down the gym and never stop, but just use your head! Do some press ups in the adverts of your fave TV show, walk to the shop instead of driving, go for the occasional jog, or even easier, if you are into sport, join a sports team! I rekindled my love for football a few years ago and I've never looked back! But anyway yeah, I understand some people can't exercise for whatever reason, well fair play, but I only want to send the whiney fat people who are just plain lazy and unhealthy to room 101. So respect to everyone else!  People blaming the internet for internet peadophiles - Right, man A goes out and buys a gun. He loads the gun, he shoots man B in the head and he dies. Who's fault is it? Its quite blatantly man A. Not the gun, right? Well apply it a different way. Man A goes out and buys a computer. He Tracks down some gullible kid in the net, and he humps the kid. Who's fault is it? Well its again Man A, but the internet gets even more bad publicity than the man does. The fact that the bloke went out and shagged a kid is irrelevant, its the fact he used the dreaded tool of Satan, "THAT BLOODY INTRANET THING" or as its commonly known, the internet. See it takes two to tango. If someone is stupid enough to go off and meet some stranger they believe to be a soul mate or something, then I guess they deserve it. Parents should keep an eye on what their kids do more. Slating the internet is pathetic. I remember when the internet was a free place, years ago. We all downloaded music and video, we could say what we wanted to say, we had free speech, there was no RIAA breathing down your neck, or newspapers blaming the internet for everything, or piles and plies of popups and ads. They were the days. No AOL kiddies. But we will never go back to that, just like in life we all used to get away and do alot more in generations before. Ok I'm rambling now but you get the point.   Whiney American bands - Right this is for bands in America, usually of teenage age, which all pick up a guitar and think they can play, and sing about how god awful life is because some really fit totty won't touch them with a bargepole. I'm not going to name any specific band names (better for lawsuits that way), but they really do get on my tits. I admire music. I admire musicians. I admire everyone who's better than me at something, which is most of the free world. But some of the music is just plain shite! Why can't they sing about happy things? Something that will make the teens of today have something to live for, instead of the harsh realites that there's more war than ever, inflation is through the roof so you will be skint forever, and obesity levels are up so most of our current population will die young anyway. Bring back Guns N Roses. I'll leave you with a classic lyric from Its So Easy, its just a song that's plain and simple, its not about love or anything fancy, its just some obscenities on top of some splendid guitar magic:  "I see you standin' there  You think you're so cool  Why don't you just  Fuck off   Ya get nothin' for nothin'  If that's what you do  Turn around bitch I got a use for you  Besides you ain't got nothin' better to do  And I'm bored"  Remember, these are just my opinions, and if you've read this far, I applaud you! Now don't take it to heart, nighty night :D

       Ok this is something I'm gonna start putting my blog, basicaly I play/run a 5-a-side team in the local league, and I'll stick reports of our matches up here. Last night we played this team in a friendly, well I honestly can't even remember what the team we played were called. They were younger than us, but not my much and actually didn't seem too bad at football.I had been reffing before so I started on the bench, and it didn't take long for us to take a 3 or 4 goal lead. We built on this, and comfortably won. I grabbed a hat trick, Ant got five, and everyone else got one goal. For the first time I can remember, the whole team scored! My third was the pick of the bunch though, the ball was laid off to me quite a way out, and I creamed it and it dipped right into the top corner past the keeper. There was great applause from the balcony! I think if we just had Skinner in instead of Niall, that would be our strongest team. We did let in some slack goals, letting them score and giving their great abundance of fans on the balcony something to cheer about, but in general it was a solid performance. Lets just hope we can bring this into the league now! We've got a 2 week break until the next game, so we should all be nice and fresh.

       Quite depressed tonight over the football. We lost on penalties to Portugal, which eliminates us from the competiton altogether :-(   First of all we can all jump and blame the ref for some, quite frankly, shambolic and outrageous decisions. Yes, its true that in most peoples eyes, England scored a perfectly legal goal in the last few minutes, but it's also true that we played poorly. Beckham has had a mare of a tournament, and his performance tonight summed it up. Gerrard played well, but for some reason he was completely knackered as we started the second half so he came off. The back four did have a good game, but I also think that in the games he's come back for, John Terry hasn't shown half the ability and skill Ledley King did in his first game against France for us. Rooney had to go off injured in the first half, which most people are saying changed the game. Fair enough, a change in personel always changes things, but what is it coming to if a team such as ours, filled with the experience and talent of players like Beckham, Scholes, Campbell and Owen, cannot perform without a teenager up front?! Vassell has looked good all tournament, and his pace looked lively tonight, but that's about the only thing that did. If truth be told, England didn't deserve to win. We did enough (no more, no less) in the first half to scrape past Portugal, but the second half was a different story. They came out fighting, and I think we all knew Portugal were destined to get back into the game. After Campbell's perfectly legal goal was ruled out, the game ended up as a penalty shoot-out.   As soon as that whistle went and I saw James strolling up towards his goal, I clearly remember being at the City of Manchester Stadium and seeing Dickov blaze a penalty straight past a helpless James in the Man City goal. I knew then it wouldn't be our night. Beckham took his penalty, blazed it over the bar then looked behind him at the spot, as if expecting a hand to quickly retreat back down the hole again. Sound farmilliar? Well it's exactly what he did against Turkey, when he completely buggered up his penalty there and tried to somehow blame the little dot in the ground 12 yards from the goal line. The replay showed that the spot was not at fault, but the fact Beckham dug his foot in and scooped out a lump of turf when he hit the ball. The spot got worse and worse, with players eventually digging chunks out of the ground. I believe the refferee was again at fault here, because after the normal shoot-out had ended in a 4-4 draw, he could have swapped ends to a new, less worn and damaged penalty spot.   There's no use crying over split milk I guess, but I'm getting increasingly worried and anxious as to whether I will ever see England get to a major final in my lifetime! The future does look quite bright, with young players like King and Defoe coming through, but I'm still curious as to how long it will take to see success.  In other news, still no bugger comments on my entries. Oh and me and the band learned Slither by VR today, it sounded most scrumptious!  Well I'm gonna go cry myself to sleep now, there's always Germany in a couple of years... *God save the Queen*

       Heh I had such a ridiculously strange night last night. Basicaly it starts off with me and me lovely girlfriend going for a light meal at the pub she works at. So we had a meal and sat down with some other people who work there, and then played some Monopoly until closing time (cracking fun!). So then when the pub started to empty we had a couple more drinks. Then there was this lad, Kev, who works there, and he lives in this house in the middle of the common next door to the pub. There's a big country road that goes down the side of the pub. Well I'd had a few to drink, and we all (5 of us or so) got a lift off Chris who works there to his house. So anyway it was getting late and they all decided to go home, basicaly leaving me and Kev. It was getting late and he had an empty house and said I could crash there if I wanted to, but I decided what with it being father's day the next day it would be a bit better if I woke up at home.   So being slightly drunk, I thought I'd just walk back up to the pub, then walk home (I don't live too far away) and it would all be fine. But I'd actually forgotten how far down the road he lived, and it was actually a couple of miles. So the scene is, its about 1am on a Sunday morning, and there's me walking down this empty country road through a common, with trees and bushes and shrubs all around and I FUCKING SHIT MYSELF. I saw so much stuff that shit me up! I got to like this railway bridge (I think, I couldn't see) and the road bent round over it, or carried on where it turned into a gravel path. That's when I decided to ring up Kerry (gf) and find out where the hell to go. So basicaly I carried on over the bridge, but then the bloody road started to open, and I had like fields on either side, and that's when I started to hear these noises behind me. It was definetley someone following me and not the echo of my footsteps, cos it was odd steps. I kept turning round but because it was completely dark and there were no streelights or anything I couldn't tell who or what it was. So I carried on, but then it started to rain, and that really fucked me about because the rain meant I couldn't hear what was behind me anymore. Of course by now I had sobered up pretty well. I started to think about turning round and going to Kev's, but then I realised I probably couldn't find my way back anyway. I passed some right scary shit then, I went past a house which I presumed belonged to a farm, but then I passed like two barns on the right hand side which proper shit me up. I could hear like the buzzing/humming of a heater or something coming from inside the barn, and I could only see the red security light on the side. Then my saviour arrived, and Kerry rang me up and basicaly her and her brother came out and saved me. He's got a beast of a car so I heard it about a mile off so I stopped, which is when I heard something coming from behind me again. I just sort of hid by the side of the road for a while then, and then Kerry finally pulled up with her bro and they took me home.  It was such a strange night, monopoloy and getting lost. Anyway, if you ever want to shit yourself, go walking round Burbage common on your own for a few miles in the early hours of the morning!  Ok well I hope you enjoyed my great story, heh. Oh and on the job scene, I'm now a trainee chef after I quit my job at the garage. Boring story but thats it! I start on Tuesday, wish me luck! AND COME ON ENGLAND!  Oh one last thing, please feel free to comment on any of the posts here, thats what the comment thing is there for!

       Ok so now I find myself in a prediciment I thought I would never be in. After months of hunting for a job, I basicaly have two on the go now. On Saturday I started working as a forecourt assistant at a local petrol station. The pay isn't great, but its really easy work and I can basicaly sit on my arse for hours and still get paid. The other job is one I applied for ages ago, as a trainee chef at a really posh hotel chain. I never thought that they would get back to me, hence getting the forecourt job, but yesterday they basicaly phoned my mum and told me I had the job. So now I'm in a dilema! I know for a fact that the chefs job will be more taxing, challenging, busy and potentially more fulfulling, and would probably look better on a cv. I don't mind taking on the more demanding work, but I would want my wage to reflect it. So basicaly, the head chef is gonna ring me tonight at some point, where I can find out more details. I can't really do both jobs, I'd have to pay tax then, and I couldn't do it, what with college and everything. Or maybe as its the summer hols soon, I can try and do both for a while... who knows! Anyway, come on England for tomorrow, if we lose I think we are out, so lets hope we can pick up some points!

       Christ on a bike! How could England throw it away like that?! Anyone who doesn't know what I'm talking about obviously doesn't like football and is therefore gay.  Beckham's penalty was dire, I could have put that away for christs sake, I could have saved it too, 'cos everyone knew which side it was going! I think for the penalty Rooney should have squared it to Vassell first, he would have buried it, goal would have stood, end of the game. Don't rate him at all, I'd like to see Vassell get a chance starting up front.   James wasn't up to scratch, but then we all have bad games. I'm not sure if it would be worth while playing Robinson instead, but I think if James doesn't perform again Sven might have no other choice.  There were some positives about the performance though! The back four had a superb game I thought. Ledley King surprised me and looked rock solid at the back, he had a cracking game, and he's still young so he's definetley one for the future! Ashley Cole played well, I noticed he was going up but always coming back defending as well, something which differentiates between the good defenders and the best defenders.  Well we need wins against Croatia and Switzerland now, so lets just see what happens, but fingers are crossed!

Any comments on this new layout would be much appreciated (yes I know its a template, I gave in etc..) so feel free to use the comment system!

       It's official.  urlLink Velvet Revolver  rock my socks!  I got the Contraband album a few days back, have to say on first listening it didn't exactly grab me. So I gave it a few days, listened to it a bit, then again, and again and again and now I can't stop playing it! Basicaly its Slash/Duff/Matt from GNRs prime days, Scott from STP and the other rythem guitarist is Dave Kushner. There really is something for everyone on the album, heavy hard rocking riffs to mellow acousticness. What makes it good is every song is different. I didn't like the first couple of minutes of one particular song, but then the verse in the middle is great and I thought twice about the rest and I love it (Do It For The Kids is the track for anyone interested).  Err anyway can't get to sleep, got an exam tomorrow that I've done no revision for, and I'm a bit achey but hey, Velvet Revolver will save me :-P  Christ this is a long entry for me. Oh yeah, I might be changing the site alot soon. I'm thinking of ditching it altogether and just leaving it as a blog with a wee bit of info. I don't think many people visit the other pages, I'd probs just keep the Undergrade one. Oh well, gonna go listen to this album and hope I get some urge to sleep so I don't die in the middle of the exam tomorrow or something. Wish me luck :-s

       Buggery bollocks! Had an A Level English exam today, on Dr. Faustus, The Handmaids Tale and Larkin's poetry. Well anyway it couldn't have gone much worse, I wrote some crap for The Handmaids Tale. I recommened the York Notes for it, had I read them more than an hour before the exam I might have pushed a grade! Faustus just took the piss a bit, I had no notes in my book, and I forgot my bloody poetry book! Looks like I might have to leave college soon cos I aint resitting, so if anyone wants a poor freelance web designer at their disposal drop me a line :p  But on a totally unrelated note, I got Contraband by  urlLink Velvet Revolver  the other day. It's actually not as good as I would have hoped, there's two or three really good tracks but the rest is a bit take it or leave it. Oh and it was my birthday on Friday. Hurrah! Oh well, back to business revision...

       Yeeeeeah got back from Blacpool on Saturday. Strangely enough.. I had fun! The weather was sunny.. the cabaret at the hotel was good (!!).. I beat my dad at bowling =D Weee! Sunday I was at the cattery. I had to walk past my stalker a couple a times and it was kinda awkward. I dunno whether he gets told about the complaints I was asked to make. I suppose not, seeing as it should be confidential. But he definitely kept his distance and avoided eye contact. Then yesterday. I hung out with Gemma. We were feeling immature so we went to climb this tree that we used to climb as kids. Lol I say kids.. it was only like 2/3 years ago. But anywhos, the branches had been cut off!! Noooooo! Grr stoopid council people. It was just one big trunk! Gahboohiss! Tuhhmmgrr! Tskarghbah!! Um just got back from my driving lesson. It went really well. Yey! Just booked my theory test too. I was thinking while I was driving.. I'm not a particularly practical person. I'm more.. I dunno.. better at stuff like English or whatnot. And yet I've set myself two incredibly practical challenges - learning to drive and learning to play guitar. It's kinda daunting but then when (and if, lol) I succeed I'm just gonna be all the more happier I suppose. Going into town later. I want the new live Chilis CD =D That was so one of the best gigs I've ever been to. Obviously excluding Bon Jovi at Hyde Park and when me n Bec met Something Corporate at Nottingham. But woo that really was such a hooby groovy night. And ummmm oh aye, I need some plectrums. Seeing as I only have one and it keeps going awol. And there's this new music shop opened in the Shires that looks snazzy so I'll go have a mooch in there. They've got a gorgeous guitar *swoons* It's a vintage Gibson Les Paul in a sunbursty colour. Ohh it's droolsome. But yeah Ali, learn to play your Fender first.. S'about it I reckon. Another nice long rambley entry :) I could mention my dream I suppose. But it's way too long and detailed. But it was soooooo vivid! Basically it involved me and a loada people going on a coach to see a rock gig at my old high school, and on the way Josh threw my trainer out the window (git =p), and when we got there it was just my history teacher playing clarinet, and then my psychology teacher was on playground duty at the local infants school and he was phoning Sylv's parents cos she'd been doing drugs.. Heh yup. Random.  Seriously, I'm going now. I'll update soooooooon! Peace out. xx

       So last night I got kinda bored, and I decided to watch a film I had wanted to watch in quite a while, Batoru Rowaiaru, or Battle Royale. It's a Japanese film, and its one of the strangest, most disturbing films I've ever watched, but it was superb. The story is set in a Japan where the volatile nature of the youth population is finally becoming to much for the adults, to an extent where a new law is past. Every year there is a class selected at random from the whole of Japan, and that class is put on a deserted island for three days. The simple rule is that there will be only be one person remaining after 3 days, and they are the winner. Apart from that there are no rules. It's disturbing, it's thought provoking, and it's awesome. The film is a real break from average American films, its a film too risky and daring for a country other than Japan to produce. You can read more on the film  urlLink here , and the cheapest place I've found to buy it in the UK is  urlLink here . I really encourage you to check it out, it's well worth it. 5 stars.

       Hellooooooo!! Good day yesterday *nods* well from 11am onwards at least. Went shopping and got the Aerosmith autobiography for the bargain price of £1.99! (RRP.£12.99) So chuffed lol. And Spiderman 2 is sooo cool! Better than the first I thought. I don't wanna spoil it.. but gah! It's good! And the Dashboard Confessional song as it goes off is swoonsome! Today was fun too. Went round Charli's.. went into Hinckley.. had a McD's.. went back to hers.. played on the dance mats.. (Lol we went on the Expert level and me, her, her bro and her sis all had an arrow each and we rocked! Heh yeah some people can do it on their own but noooo it takes 4 of us =D) And then we got a Chinese and then ummm yeah we did hair cutting&nbsp;on some Bratz dolls. Hmmmmm.... Oh and I came home and Dad had me a prezzie! =D He made me walk upstairs with my eyes shut before I could get it so I nearly broke my neck heh. But he got me a Kerrang CD! Which was coooool cos normally his presents are like.. i dunno.. socks or summat. Meep Blackpool tomorrow. I LOVED Blackpool when I was a kid. But I dunno, my eyes must have been so glazed over that I totally missed all the tackiness and scum and strip clubs and shops full of poppers / dildos, etc. I used to cry when it was time to go home for Christ's sake! So I dunno, kinda looking forward to a few days away, but Blackpool isn't the best place in the world.. So I'll update on the happiness that was Blackpool when I get home. Laters people! Peace out. xx

       Oooh I'm in SUCH&nbsp; a bad mood!!  GRR!  Just had a driving lesson *fumes* and as well as taking me through the town centre at like rush hour, he was in a right friggin bad mood. Which makes me tense. Which makes me do dumb stuff. Not like a great socking big car crash, nooo just forgetting to indicate or summat, but he goes off on a big rant at me. And if I stuff up on a reverse round the corner, then maaaaybe we should be friggin practicing them more than like once every 6 weeks. Instead of going for nice long drives in the country which I can obviously do, why don't we work on the stuff I'm crap at?!  And it's not just that either. Everything seems to be putting me in a bad mood lately.  Arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!   *breathes* Calm Ali.. calm..  Today will hopefully get better. Shopping, meal out, then cinema.  OK. I'm off to calm down lol.  Peace out.  xx

       A depleted Bradford Dynamo side were soundly beaten 12-4 by an in form Leannes Boys team. The summer holidays hit us hard, and as a result we were only left with two regular players in the starting squad. Stand-in 'keeper (or permanent keeper as he has been lately!) Niall appeared in goal again, and new players Finley and Towey were drafted in. Finley made a flying start to the match, scoring in the first few seconds, before the Bradford lead was doubled by a second Finley goal as he tapped home a rebound from Phillips' original shot. By the half way mark Leanne's boys had turned the game around, the former Birmingham and West Brom player in the team clearly giving them a big advantage over the underdogs. In what can only be described as 10 minutes of mad defending, Bradford Dynamo went down heavily. The lack of subsititutes expoited our fitness levels, and on the night the better team won. Bradford are still in quite a lofty mid-table position, and we look forward to a busy week next week, a friendly to keep fitness levels up this coming thursday, with league games following on both Sunday and next Thursday, where we hope to have a full team back.

       Happy Sunday everyone.. Today's been pretty cool so far. Had a lie in, went to the cattery, got back an hour or so ago. Now I'm just waiting for my Sunday roast =) My moods have been up and down like billy-o lately heh. Thursday night I was kinda upset and then November Rain came on the radio and I just burst into tears. Lol it was weird. Just sat on my bed hugging my teddy feeling like a right fool. And then Friday night I was all angry and started throwing stuffs about. And last night I was ecstatically happy which was nice. So hmmm I wonder what I'm gonna be like tonight... Oh yuss, last night was helluva fun. Ross Noble is one of the funniest guys in the world. I was so pissed orf that we had to leave early to catch the train. But I'm so happy we actually got to see him at all. *Puts on a Scouse accent* "CLAIRE CLAIRE CLAIRE CLAIRE CLAIRE!!" Ohhhh you had to be there. Liverpool Claire, the God of seagulls *nods* I had tears rolling down my face. We so have to go and see him again. Heh I was at the cattery and Rachel came up and asked me if I wanted to take Custer for a walk. And I blinked and looked stunned, because, yuss, Custer is a cat. Lol so anywhos he got strapped into this harness and I took him for a walk. I looked like SUCH&nbsp; a gimp. And he just kept stopping and rolling over and I had to keep pulling him up and shoving him along and he's a huuuuuuge heavy cat and everyone was laughing *sighs*  Oooh speaking of animals I'm getting Becci's mice to look after this week =D Yeyness! I want mice sometime. Or a rat. But not until Pippin dies. Not that I want my hamster to die! I'm dead proud (no pun intended) of him actually, he was only meant to live 18 months or so and he's up to about 23 and still seems pretty healthy. Probably go upstairs and find he's snuffed it now.. S'about all for now. My dinner's almost done *drools* I'll update soon. Peace out. xx

       Ok so I've decided to share a bit of knowledge I've come up with here in the hope it'll help footballers out there. Every now and then I'll try and post a wee tip, and this week my tip is about the importance of choosing a good team captain. Whether you play 5/6/7 or 11-a-side football, its vital to have a captain on the pitch to lead the players. If you couple some good communication from the sidelines with a mentally strong player communicating with the rest of the team on the pitch, you will be at a distinct advantage to your opponents. Quite alot of managers and teams tend to overlook captaincy. It's important not to do this. The captain does not neccesarily have to be the best footballer on the pitch, although it often helps to lead by example. Communication skills are more paramount than footballing ability when it comes to team captaincy. Winston Churchill wasn't the fittest or best soldier in the country, but he still managed to lead everyone else quite well! Morale is important when picking a captain. You want someone who will ENJOY the job, as its not an easy role to fulfill. Having a captain does not mean that the rest of the team should remain quiet, a captain should be overlooking what the other players are doing, and all players should be talking to each other. Finally, get a Captains Armband. These cost about a quid, and are not essential, but they have a kind of stigma attached to them. It's a psychological thing, the player will actually have something to show for his role, something he can actually wear and be proud of. For a quid its worth it! I'd be interested to read anybodys comments on this, so if you wish to comment please go ahead. Remember you don't need to register to comment, you can comment anonymously.

       Can't wait for tonight! =D Going to see Ross Noble in Birmingham with Kiri, it should hopefully (and probably will) rock my socks. Woo I love the lil' long haired&nbsp;Geordie dude!  Hmmm yesterday was fun. Went for a meal with some people which I really enjoyed. I wasn't sure if it would be OK but it turned out that we had a laugh. So yey!  Lol also yesterday Andrew was painting the windowledge and there was this hole in it, and and an ant came through *gasps* so I mooched over and prodded the hole and all of a sudden it was like omg a SWARM of ants came flocking through. Lol they were scurrying all over the place. So he went and got the hoover and sucked em all up. And it made me laugh.  What a great story that was!  Moving on..  Oh I was reading this person's journal, and she was going on about how this guy was gonna name a star after her for her birthday. And it sounded awwww so cool! So yeah *major hint* it's my birthday in a few months.. *coughs* Hehe..  Finally got off my ass and picked up my guitar. Yup, I suck. But I did learn the intro to Smoke On The Water which I was kinda proud of. Even though it sounds a bit dodgy. But I'll work on it. And mum was walking past my room and she knew what it was without me telling her lol&nbsp;so that's good. And I learnt bits and bobs of some other songs, mainly It's My Life and Summer of '69. One day I'll master the intro to Sweet Child. Oh yes! My left fingers hurt soooo much. Which is good I guess =D But I dunno, I think my amp might be buggered. When I plug it in sometimes it works OK but then other times the sound cuts out and there's this horrible buzzing sound. Hmmm. Anywhos..  Thats it for now. Everyone have a good weekend. And comment damnit!  Peace out.  xx

This blog is actually the TOP  urlLink Google   result for a search for fourcourt assistant. And also, on  urlLink Yahoo , its the 16th top hit out of 6,560,000 pages for a search for really fat people. Not sure how long these links will stay where they are but who knows!

       A very depleted Bradford Dynamo side took on mid-table rivals Taxi to Portland tonight in a gutsy encounter. Bradford were without Ant, Porter, Dillon and Skinner for the match, leaving just Chris and Josh from the original team. Replacements Purnell, Neil, Niall and Baggott stepped in to take their place. We took the lead twice in the game early on, only to be pegged back by sloppy goals. We found ourselves 4-3 down with not long left on the clock, when Purnell stepped up to tap home his first goal for the club from just outside the D. We were tiring but we knew if we kept pushing for it the goal would come, and in the last minute of the game, Phillips got eye for goal after cleverly turning the defender, and slotted it into the bottom corner from well outside the D. We defended frantically for the dying seconds, before the whistle went and Bradford Dynamo racked up another 3 points from a very close and exciting game.

       Wooo it's been a while since I've posted. My one-a-day thing's gone out the window lol. Today was so much fun! We went down to Ingoldmells for a day, and it was helluva cool! We went on the dodgems and I couldn't stop laughing =D Charli's driving ROCKED! And then we went on this huuuuuge loopy leg-dangly rollercoaster thing and just screamed constantly the whole way round =D =D =D And we watched David get his ear pierced which was fun. He's in trouble bless him lol. And we went bowling and I was so winning until right near the end *curses* but I got a strike and a half-strike which made me go wappy heehee, and I came second which wasn't so bad. And I spent loads trying to win this damn Fimble out of the grabbers and it kept picking up and dropping and I don't even like the Fimbles lol but I wanted it! And in the end it woulda been cheaper just to buy one heh. So yuss, I had such a good time today. Not much has been happening lately really. I had this well scary dream that I got my AS results and I got 3E's, 2D's and a B+, so I burst into tears. And then my history teacher came and shouted at me to get off the course, but then he was only joking lol. I told him and he laughed and said he hoped that wasn't a sign of things to come. So do I... =s Lol I ordered Chinese on Saturday night for me and Andrew, and he went out to collect it. And he comes back and asks me if there's two Chineses in Barwell cos he thinks he went to the wrong one cos they didn't have our order. But he waited anyway. And yes, he had gone to the wrong place. Silly narna! But I've ordered and he's collected before lol, and there can't be that many Cartledge's in Barwell, so I guess the Chinese I phoned has blacklisted us now for keep forgetting to pick up our orders.. Lol well I found this funny. And we watched Silence of the Lambs which was such a good film. I can't believe I've never seen it before. And this weird X-Files episode about a man whose siamese twin kept detatching itself to go and kill people. Hmm.. yes.. *Thinks* Ooh yay to Josh for the whole YE thing. I went to the buffet last night as Lydz's guest which was cool, even though the chicken satay sticks were a bit dodgy =s But i hadn't done any work whatsoever and I got a free buffet so I really can't complain. So yuss, well done *applauds* Hmm my stalker at the cattery has been at it again so I'm gonna have to file ANOTHER complaint *sighs* Life's a bitch.. But it's cool, I love it there and its something to have a laugh over I guess. Yeah. A laugh at my expense. Lol. Tsk. I agree with the no-smacking ban. There's better ways to discipline your kid, eg. taking away their favourite toy, not letting them watch their fave tv show, sending em to bed, etc. And you're still allowed to give light smacks, which should be enough really. No parent should want to cause pain to their child, even if they have been naughty. It's more the actual smack that scares the kid anywhos, its not the pain, so a light smack should still be enough. Well I think so anyway. So I pretty much agree with it. Oooh heard today that this year's alternative Christmas speech is gonna be done by The Simpsons. That should be so cool. Oh and I heard some stuff about Big Brother so I hope tonight's episode is gonna be good. But I've heard Michelle and Becky either practically kill each other, or Michelle tells Becky it doesn't matter. I know which one I'm hoping for.. I also know which one it's probably gonna be.. Ah I reckon I've wrote enough now. Sorry if there's any typos, I don't really wanna proof-read all this. Until next time peoples. Peace out. xx

       I was proud to be a football fan after watching last nights Euro 2004 final! And my proudness for Greece was doubled when I saw that the player lifting the trophy, poised to send thousands of fans around the world into sheer euphoria, not so long ago was playing in a Leicester shirt. Theo Zagorakis I'm of course talking about, the Greek captain, and now official player of the tournament. I met him a few times and he was also a top bloke. He didn't play all the time for City, but when he did he always put his heart and soul into it, and he only went back to Greece cos he was homesick. I still remember the big ovation we gave him when he left, it was superb. I only hope that sometime next season he will come back to Leicester as one of the half time guests or something. Anyway it wasn't a vintage game of football, but I loved to see Greece win. The passion in the game was immense, Ronaldo's tears of sorrow at the end, the Greek players going mad with joy, scenes that just really make you smile, makes you realise why you love the game so much!   In other news... Those government bastards are trying to stop parents smacking their kids now! Absolutely ridiculous. I was smacked when I was a kid, yeah it hurt, but it never did any harm in my upbringing. Yeah I'm against kids being beaten up by their parents, but I see the stuff kids do today, screaming and running round in shops etc, I'd get such a smack if I did that when I was a kid! And the way some of them talk to their parents! Geez if that's how they're gonna grow up, I don't know if I want to live in the UK in ten or twenty years time! And I'm spent. Have fun and comment damnit.

       Blimey, had a proper busy night at work last night. The only chefs we had on were me, two other trainees and two experienced chefs. Basicaly we had to cater for 500 people, and that was just in the restaurant, not including the various functions/room service going on. The chef assured me that its unlikely anywhere outside of London had to cater for that many people last night! I had to look after the deserts and the salad bar, as well as being a backup for everything else. Worked really hard and give or take a few tantrums and swear words, I (well, me and Joe) managed to keep it all afloat (not literally) and there were little complaints! Then I went out for a bit after with a couple of friends for a few drinks. It was an ok night.   Oh and also, I've been looking at the stats for this site and it seems we are getting a few hits from other countries (eg. outside the UK). I might whack up a little guestbook soon, but until then, if you're from another country drop me a line and let me know how you found the site or what you're doing here, I'd be most interested :-D

       GRR! So some of you know me & mum arn't exactly getting along at the minute. She's stressed, I'm stressed, and we're just getting on each nerves. But today reeeeeeeally pissed me off. She burst into my room at 7 (I was having another nice lie in) snapping at me to clear up all my stuff from downstairs before she gets home. So fair enough, I go downstairs, and theres a big heap of my schoolwork and prospectuses (prospecti?) at the bottom of the stairs. And my little Miffy bag is there too, and she's stuffed every piece of rubbish she can find in it. So I have Andrew's old crisp packets, tissues, etc in there . . and a chip. ARGH! Yes, there is an OLD CHIP IN MY BAG! It may sound like a trivial thing, but I found it SO annoying!! I threw it across the room in a mood lol so now it's just sat by the cat's scratching post. Ready for her to see and have a go at me over *sigh* Today apart from that has been fun so far though. I met Charli at about 10.45 at Top Town and we caught the bus into Leicester with all the good intentions of spending the day at the Open Day. As you do. We got there, had our names ticked off, got our goody bags . . . and decided to mooch off to Burger King. Heehee we were at the uni for around 5 minutes, then got lunch and went shopping =D Another day without school tomorrow *stretches* But I'm probably gonna have to walk up at some point anyway to hand in my coursework front sheet for history. And also I want to see all the new year 10 kids heh. I think thats about all the news I have. Thanks to all the people who are commenting =D Keep it up! I'm gonna *touch wood* try to post an entry a day. Good luck to the Czech Republic tonight! (because they read this lol) I'm not actually too fussed who wins but I guess I should half-support someone. So go CR! *waves* Ali xx  PS.

       =D I had a hooby groovy day today =) Well I had to get up at like 7.30 *yawn* to go to work at the factory with Charli n there was only like 90mins worth of work to do lol. Grr! Gawd it's mind-numbing though! Line up transfer.. stick transfer.. line up transfer.. stick transfer.. repeat until the end of time... Anywhos, so then we went back to hers and hung out.. ummmm nothing really it happened it was just fun fun fun. My head hurts from laughing so much, which is always a good sign. Uhh this week.. I went shopping on Monday. After reading the Aerosmith book, I checked Amazon and the David Lee Roth autobiography was recommended so I was gonna get that.. and I walked into HMV and it was like the first thing I saw and it had a fiver off which was sweeeeeet. So another bargain book for moi. And some hair stuffs and a bracelet (which is sodalite, and meant to calm me, and promote joy - I think I need a bit more than that hehe, but its a start) and the new Calling single. Chuffed too cos they're coming back to UK which is cool cos I missed the tour last month. Yesterday seems forever away! Ummmm oh! I had a driving lesson which went really well. And then in the afternoon I went to the gym with Lydz which was supercoolies. Then I had to nip up to Boots and on the way back down Castle St I saw Charli n John so I spent some time with them. Lol @ them waving madly at me and my ignorance.. And today you've just read (",) And also I had to go round Katie's to get Pip back. And on the way out I tried to get into the wrong car. Lol. D'uh. Meep! Tomorrow is results day *quivers* LOL mum &amp; dad are watching a programme about the sexiness of man boobs. *Giggles* It's helluva funny. Anyways, yuss, results. Very nervous. And me n Charli n Lydz are going out that night to "celebrate", so I'm just wondering what's gonna happen if any of us do badly. Kinda gonna piss on that bonfire.. Aaaaaand then I'm sleeping over Charli's *yey!* Then we have to go shopping on Friday. (I shop way too much. But this for birthday stuff which doesn't count. So nyer!) Then on Saturday it's CARNIVAL! Wooo! So that's like almost 4/5 days solid spent with Charlipoo. Which is a good thing! Lol.. Then Sunday I get to go to the cattery which I'm looking forward to cos I've not been for 3 weeks =( And I miss le cats and Rachel and Julie and Matthew. And my stalker.. heh.. yeah.. Meh I'm done I think. This helps me not think about tomorrow. *Bites nails* Peace out. Ali xx  PS. Oh! I just remembered! A MASSIVE thank you to Kirkus for the fantabulous picture he drew me! I'd put it up but (a) I'm not sure how, and (b) I don't want Josh to shout at me for filling the blog with what he might consider crap (which it plainly isn't Kirk, but, y'know, some people just don't gettit =p) ...

       Bradford Dynamo tonight played two friendlies to help keep up mid-season fitness in the fourth division championship. The Dynamo fielded two different sides for each game, the first consiting of  Chris, Chopper, Ant, No Hope's Andy Dickinson and trialist Andy the plumber. The first friendly was against a well established side, namely including arguably one of the leagues top shot-stoppers, Danny Suffolk. Both Andy's formed a solid partnership at the back, and the plumber impressed throughout. Bradford ran out 12-4 winners over the side, Phillips hitting back to his prolific form along with Ant and Chris finding their scoring boots. Phillips hit a spectacular volley which sailed into the corner of the goal passed the helpless Suffolk, but the goal of the night belonged to Andy the plummer, firing home an unstoppable shot from inside his own half to delight players and fans alike. Dill, Skinner and Boff arrived for the next game, and Dynamo welcomed one of 5-a-sides best goalkeepers, as Matt Brazier put on the Dynamo shirt and played between the sticks. Dynamo were against tough opposition, Andy Lee's team, including the prolific scorer Nico. Dynamo eventually ran out losing the game 8-2, with both goals coming from Ant, who had a classy night. The players were dissapointed with the loss, but conceded that they were the weaker team in the contest. Dynamo continue their mid season break with a friendly against a new side on Sunday night. At the end of the night Phillips commented that all the players had enjoyed the workout, and it was a good run out for all trying to keep fitness levels up.

       Yeeeey, I'm back =D Nice holiday *nods* lots of sun and sea and sand. I've been taken over by freckles =) Well it did rain a coupla days. Actually it pissed it down like nobody's business, but it was OK. Oooh, apart from the second night *quivers* I was woken up at like 5.30am and it was pitch black and I lay there trying to figure out where I was etc, and there was singing coming from my en suite bathroom =s It was sort of like *puts on a deep voice* LAAAA! LAAAAAA! And then - the night before I'd left my CD player in there cos I was listening to it while I showered with the little speakers attatched - and suddenly it came on. All by itself. And Appetite for Destruction starts blasting out from my bathroom. Argh so at this point I'm lying there absolutely frit to death. And THEN to makes things worse, the tracks started being skipped through. So Welcome to the Jungle played for maybe 10secs, then I could hear the beginning bits of the next few songs, then Nightrain was left on for maybe another 10secs, then more songs were flipped through, and then it was left on Think About You. So I'm lying there shaking, but I figure I have to get up and go turn it off cos it's really loud... And I swear to God, getting up in pitch black and opening a door behind which I've heard singing and my CD player has suddenly turned on, is possibly the bravest thing I've ever had to do. Anywhos there was nothing there. *thanks God* So I turned it off, had a quick pee, unplugged the speakers, legged it back to bed and hid under the covers till morning. And then when I looked at my CD player in the morning, showing on the screen was the total length of the album, which means that it'd been played through again.. Erkles. And it was reeeeally weird that sometimes it wouldn't work in the room, but as soon as I took it through to the kitchen it was fine! But I guess if I had to have a ghost, at least he seemed to like Gn'R hehe.. Umm what else happened.. Oooh! We went to Buffalo Grill *drools* Lol, omg if you go France you so have to go there! Not exactly French cuisine, but it rocks! It's sort of all American Wild Westy, and they have like saloon doors seperating tables and really low hanging fringed lights n stuff. And the best music! Sort of country n western mixed with classic rock. V.cool. Sweet Home Alabama was played twice while we were there which cheered me up no end =D Ahh speaking of Lynerd Skynerd (bear with me here), I finished the Aerosmith autobiography. Which btw is absaloutely fan-fuckin'-tabulous. And the plane that half of Lynerd Skynerd was killed on when it crashed was nearly bought by Aerosmith =o That's reeeeally dodgy and scary and really makes you think.. Another thing that made me think on holiday was when we stopped off at Caen on the way home, and had a wander around. Ad it was a very very significant town during WWII so obviously there's loads of war memorials and stuffs. And not to sound boring, but it's very thought-provoking. And it kinda annoyed me that the souvenir shops seemed to be cashing in on the war by selling postcards and toy soldiers and tanks and whatnot. And also the amount of people having their photos took in front of memorials without even giving them a second glance, just standing there, grinning away. I dunno.. it just seemed wrong.. Anywhos. Whoah this is a long post. And possibly quite boring. Not done yet though =p Before I finish off, in tribute to Le French Ghost, I'm going to write Ali's List Of Very Scary Things That She Thought About While In France. Starting with - 1) Being woken up by nasty singy voices and CD players turning themselves on. And having to get up to turn them off! 2) Lighthouses. We passed quite a few of these and they always make me shudder. It's not exactly a fear, as much as being uncomfortable looking at them. It's a very irrational and unexplainable fear though lol. But they do scare me more at night, and I think it might be something to do with the film 'The Fog'.. 3) Black Widow Spiders. Omg help! I'm shit scared of these. Always have been. Just pictures of them are enough. I mean I'm bad with regular spiders, but these are little beasties. They spin their webs on toilet seats (!!), and after mating the female eats the male! And they're veeeeeery poisonous. And they're a horrible shape - all big bum and scuttly legs. I saw them in this wildlife book in the gite and that did it for me lol. I even had a plan incase one spun a web on my toilet seat - (1) blast it with the hairdryer, (2) flush, and (3) put the seat down for the rest of the holiday. Lol yeah I'm weird... 4) Clowns. Never been keen on these things. And the French go all out for them! Everywhere! Souvenir shops, supermarkets, you name it. And the worst clown of them all, Ronald McDonald. They have this huuuuuge hideous Ronald McDonald head on like every McDonalds. Ugh. Makes your skin crawl.. Gah I really have to quit typing. I dunno whats up with me heh, I could keep going all night. If you've read this far then I salute you. (*Salutes You*) Oh yes, and its official - I LOVE VAN HALEN!! And with that, I'm gone.. Peace Out. xx

        It's nearly here. Infact at time of writing, The Championship is only about 18 hours and 45 minutes away. Of course I'm talking about the big kick off, the start of the 2004/2005 Coca Cola Championship season. Not being biased, but my promotion tips this season are Leicester, West Ham and Sheffield United. So COME ON CITY, and here's my predictions for this season:   Leicester:  The team I support. Though I am usually quite pescimistic when predicting our performances, I am quietly confident of a good season this time. When you look at the players we have lost and gained over the summer, things are looking up. The big losses were without a doubt Izzet, Bent and Ferdinand. Izzet is simply a sad loss because he was a dedicated Leicester player. He was a talent, but regardless of this, last season his performances were lacking. We've bought in midfield players like Joey Gudjonsson, Jason Wilcox, Scott Gemill, Gareth Williams, to add to what we already have, such as Lilian Nalis and the young Tommy Williamson. I think we have a quality replacement of Ferdinand in Dion Dublin, a Leicester lad who will fit right into The Championship, and a quality proven striker in David Connely to partner him. We definetely have a good mix of young legs and mature brains, and a play off finish would be dissapointing in my books.   West Ham:  Another team who have bought sensibly over the summer. Harweood and Zamora are easily the best strike force in the division on their day, and with players like Etherington backing them up it will be hard to see West Ham not scoring goals this season. As long as they hold their own at the back, a play off finish should be the mininal target.    Sheffield United:  Like him or loathe him, Neil Warnock is a proven leader and will get the best out of his players. I think Barry Hayles will be one to watch this season, he's a typical striker who will crop up and poach goalscorers goals. He won't dazzle defences with flair, but he'll certainly slam home plenty of goals if he can keep fit. They have players like Jagielka, Paddy Kenny and Kozluk who have always been linked with bigger clubs, and players that propelled the blades (nice pun) to the play offs last season. They will be there or thereabouts come the end of the season.  And a quick mention to the Premiership which kicks off next week, players to watch in my expert opinion are going to be David Bentley of Norwich, and Emile Heskey at Brum. Bentley scored some fantastic goals last season in the Arsenal youth ranks, and has impressed thoroughly. He's definetley one to watch this season. I also think that Steve Bruce will get the performances out of Heskey that he once had at Leicester. Heskey is a very talented player, he was just slightly astray in the last season or so at Liverpool. A clean start at St Andrews will see him back to his former best I'm sure.

       Lol I've had that song in my head for ages now.. I thought I'd better update now in case I can't be assed tomorrow, and I wanna update before I go away. Uhh last night Sylv came round for a little while, that was v.kewl. Gave her her bday present which was way too late =( Meep, sorry, my bad.. And today was, well, eventful. Me and Katie walked like 2 miles from the bus stop to the uni library to study. We got there and walked through one of those lil' silver push bar things, and this bloke at the front desk looked at us like we were crazy and goes 'EXCUUUUUSE ME! HOW DID YOU TWO JUST GET IN?!' And we were all 'uhh.. we pushed the bar..'. And he goes 'Noo you didn't! It's locked!' And then he went back to it and pushed it, and it was locked lol. So we looked suspiciously suspicious. Anywhos it was a waste of time us even going cos the letters we had from college plus our ID wasn't enough to let us in yada yada, we need more PROOF! Proof of what I dunno.. its not like we were carrying bombs.. So instead we walked into town and did some shopping. Then went to the cinema and saw King Arthur which I thought was fantabulistic. I liked Lancelot *nods* Ummmm tomorrow - I have to pack. And clean out Pip and take him round to Katie's. Then I'll see Joshooahhh at the leisure centre. Then me &amp; Katie are gonna either play badminton (if there's a free court, which I doubt) or go swim. Then go for a meal. So it should be a pretty hooby groovy day. Sorrrrrrry to Kirk who is getting fed up of reading my long pointless updates =p Tough titties I say! Nyer! Thilly Thimon! S'all for now. Maybe update tomorrow. If not then byeeeeeee! Peace out. xx

       Gah. I was only out in the sun for like 2 hours. But now my legs are in pain! Tuh I wish I'd just go straight to brown like other people. But nooooo I have to go through the pain first. *sigh* But my top half is brown now so yey. Crummy legs.. And nooooo Josh you and your DC wind-ups arn't funny ACTUALLY. They're a great band and you're just determined not to like them cos you think they're another 'whiney American band'! You're just miffed cos I'm getting more comments =p And you don't half big yourself up on your football reports lol =p =p =p Long time sice I updated. *Thinks* Can't remember much of last week. I saw Charli on Thurs I think. Could have been Wednesday actually. No no, it was Thursday. I was a hermit on Weds. Oh, and Katie on Friday. We went into town and got lunch, then I went round hers for a while. She gave me her looong black cardigan that I've always liked! Bless her little heart. Then shopping with Kes & Sylv on Sat. I got a cool Ringspun top and some Converse flip flops aaand a Gn'R poster =D Apparently Chinese Democracy is actually gonna be released this November. Heh yeah, I'll believe that when I see it! And I was at the cattery yesterday. There was only 3 of us in so it was busy busy busy. I got to name a cat! The first one they've let me name. I was flicking through a cat name book and chose 'Gloves' cos it's black with white paws. It suits Gloves *nods* Its v.cute and whines reeeeally loudly when it's left alone. Belinda the most gorgeous kitten in the world had gone though so that made me sad.. Oh oh oooh I remember something else which happened last week! I got home one of the days and there was an answerphone message for me off Jason, who was like my best friend all through infant school. We always hung out at each others houses etc, but then he changed schools for some reason and we tried to keep in touch but it's hard when you're that young and we just kinda fell apart. I've seen him a few times lately but only to wave and say hi to, not for an actual chat. And when I moved up to college a few years back I originally went to the one he goes to, before changing to Willy B, so I saw him a bit there too. So anywhos, he wanted to check how I was etc, and I called him back and we had a really good catch-up talk which was totally hooby groovy. He's got a great sense of humor. And he was gonna come round on Friday but I had plans. Grr. So hopefully I'll see him sometime soon. Ummm and todaaaay I sunbathed and then messed with the guitar for a bit. Then went into town for a little while. Got a waterproof mascara and some credit and the new Van Halen CD =D And I'm going the gym tomorrow with Lydz cos I need to get some exercise in before my holiday. Tuh and I have to go the university library on Weds with Katie to do some research for my history cw *sigh* Then on Thurs I have to take the hamster round to David's at some point, assuming he's free to look after him. And I'll see Joshoohahhhhh at le leisure centre. Aaaaaaand then on Friday it's Holiday Baby!! Lol now I've wrote it all down I have no reason for forgetting anything. Meh s'too warm. It's pigtails r us with Ali's hair at the minute lol. I want a big storm. I'm so in the mood for a storm. It rained a bit earlier and it was thundering so I was all yeyyyyyy! But now it's all passed. Tuhhmmgrr! *Drools* I just had one of those dairylea dunky things. Omg it was delicious. I can see myself becoming obsessed with those things. And on that note it's time for me to go. I'll definitely post another entry before I go away on Friday. Laterssssss. Peace out. xx

       Bradford Dynamo today unveiled a player who will hopefuly ease the strain of injuries and unavailable players as the league progresses through summer. Defender Lee Dickinson has joined the team, after previously having trial spells with 5th division outfit "No Hope", but never really settling into the side. Lee played a friendly for the Dynamo and impressed, and has now been offered a full time place in the team. He is expected to be officialy signed on on Thursday night. Bradford have tried several players in the past weeks to try and fill the gaps, but Dickinson is the first to have joined full time. Phillips had this to say about his sides new player:    Obviously we all delighted that Lee has joined us. We understand he had trouble settling in at 'No Hope', but having watched him play since, and after his trial friendly for us the other week, we are very optimistic that he will become a valuable asset to the team. He is a very strong individual who loves to get stuck in, and takes his game very seriously. We are taking him under the Bradford Dynamo wing so to speak, and hopefuly he will improve further working with us.   Meanwhile Bradford Dynamo find themselves on poor form, but still nearer the top than bottom due to some excellent early performances. Dynamo's next set of fixtures have yet to be announced, but they are expected to be released on Thursday along with the signing of Dickinson. The general mood in the Bradford Dynamo camp is a bouyant one, with the team optimistic of a mid-table, or even better finish this season. Phillips, still the only player to have appeared in every game this season had this to say about the current dip in form:   Well obviously a dip like we've had is dissapointing. We've been hit hard by absent players and injuries, but this could potentially be a blessing in disguise. We've been forced into trying out new players and tactics, players have had to play in different positions, I think we have all learnt a little bit more about our game. This can only help us, and if we can get back to the form we showed at the start of the season I'm sure we can at least secure the mid table finish we were hoping for   Bradord have displayed some excellent signs of promise throughout the season, although as with last season the goal difference is yet again very poor. Defender Scott Wheway was heard to say:    All of us were filled with optimism at the start of the season, however poor performances all over the pitch and an ever changing side meant we could never keep on top of the goal difference. Things do seem to be picking up though, I've netted a couple lately and Josh keeps on putting them away. We are building up a more solid team, things are looking up and a successful season is looking on the cards   With this Bradford Dynamo head into the second half of the season, and the fixtures will be announced shortly.
