        After the famous sculptor Thorvaldsen finished his statue of Christ, he invited a friend to view it. The arms of Jesus were outstreched, and his head was bowed between them. The friend said, "I can't see his face." The sculptor replied, "If you would see the face of Christ, you must get on your knees."          (from The One Year: Devotions For Teens by Susie Shellenberger)

       i just found out that my school is putting a kind of 'ban' on flip flops. you cant wear shoes that 'you cant keep on'. ok what i dont get is why they're worrying about flip flops when there are girls walking around looking like....well lets just say its disgusting. they have never cracked down on these girls and they're concerned with flip flops. OPEN YOUR EYES AND LOOK AROUND! flip flops are the very least of the dress code problem! i live in flip flops during the school year. hopefully it wont be so strict that we arent allowed to wear them. we'll see. if i get pulled into the office, i am not going to be happy.

       lately i've had a facination with the stars. i just want to sit outside and stare at them all night... but lately it's been so cloudy that you can barely see the stars at night. i need to go star gazing before school starts and i barely have the time to breathe let alone watch the stars. it's just a reminder to me of God's power and love. if he cared enough about each and every one of those tiny stars to create them to be sooo beautiful how much more does he care about us?      ok im looking outside now and it's still really cloudy. anyone know a good place to star gaze??
