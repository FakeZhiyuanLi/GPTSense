       Hey all, I've fixed up the Blog a bit.  Now people can put in comments and not have to sign up for a blogger account.  I realized that it was a bit of a pain to have to sign up for an account to put in a post.  I'm trying to figure out how to put in links and stuff to other people's blogs and whatnot.  I'm still new at this to bear with me.  Also, I had to get rid of all the other comments to previous posts.  Sorry about that.

       I have a few days still to go with CH and I never realized how much stuff I'd have to do to finish off work here.  It's just insane the amount of work I still have to do before I leave. I still have a few days so it shouldn't be a problem in getting it all done.  I completely trained my successor in financial coordinator duties yesterday.  She'll do fine as she has a good head on her shoulders and picked everything up pretty quick.  I'm not gonna have a whole lot of time to yap about things after this week unfortunately.  My access to the internet right now is limited to work.  We don't have the net at home yet and I think I'll only be able to get on if I go to the library.  Kate wants to get the net at home in September though when she can't move a whole lot and when the baby is born.  I'll try to show her how to do these blogs so she can keep people up to date with what's going on though.

       This week isn't going to fun as I have to completely remove myself from CH.  I have a ton of stuff that I have to train people on before I go.  I have to train another staff here on financial coordinator responsibilities.  I find it a very easy role as I have been doing it now for 5 years.  I started typing out what you have to do each month and when I was all finished it totaled about 4 pages of stuff to do.  I'm currently on 3 different bank account and have to switch all that around and I have a giant list of about 30 different things I have to do by the end of the week...  ACK!  Well I've always worked well under pressure.

       Kate and I had a few adventures this weekend.  On Sunday we went up to Owen Sound to visit Randy and Meaghan (Meagan, Meghan?).  We haven't seen them for quite a while so we thought that we'd better go see them while Kate is off work for the next couple of month and the baby hasn't come yet.  Randy has been trying his hand at the whole Home-brew adventure.  It wasn't too bad but he used corn syrup as the secondary sugar in the brewing process and the beer had a very distinct flavor to it.  Luckily he had a bottle of Keiths to cleanse the pallat with.  Afterwards we went to Paisley to see the camp.  The renovations look great!  They completely redid the mens wing.  It was kind of eerie being back there again though.  There was absolutley nobody there that I knew from years ago.  We just wondered in and walked around and saw a few guests that I recognize, and every staff there just kinda looked at us funny as we didn't talk to any of them and then we left.  We went to visit Cam and Claire and had dinner with them and their 4 kids.  That made me feel old as the last time I saw them they only had the twins and they were tiny.  Now there were all growed up (well 5 years old anyways)  It was a good visit though.  Yesterday we went for a BBQ at Dan and Faiths.  Good burgers!  Matt came by and we all went out bowling.  All those years of bowling league didn't pay off though.  Matt killed us all.  Dan beat me by 2 points or so and Faith and Kate were niping at my heals.  Oh well, good fun though. We played Chinese checkers after bowling.  I don\t like that game.  It's silly and I really suck at it.  Anyways... gotsta go get some work done.

       Hey all, just wanted to let you all know that I got the job at Honda.  They called me this morning and offered me the job.  WOOHOO!  I'll be starting on July 19th.  I'll be taking a $0.34 pay cut to work ther but I'll be working on a 48 hour week so in the end I'll be doing better.  Luckily I have close to 4 weeks vacation built up so I'll be working next week to tie up all the loose ends here at work and then I'll be on route to Honda.  Plus I'll still be getting 4 weeks of pay from CH.  Not too shabby.  It's going to be a big change for me.  So far I've been working for CH now since 1995 and now I'm off to a car plant.  I'm gonna have to work those flabby social worker muscles into shape.  I'm still a little sore from my physical test a few days ago, but I know that after a week or so of working I'll be fine.  Well gotsta run.

       Hey does anyone know if it's worth going into those baby classes that they have the clinics.  Kate's made a few calls regarding getting into one.  Right now she's about 2 1/2 months form her due date and I know a lot on the stuff that they tell you is for the beginning part of the pregnancy.  I know nothing about them so I'd apreciate any advise form anyone.

       Well I've just realied how much I miss my unborn child today.  Kate has been away all week doing some upgrading of her schooling at Redeemer College in Hamilton.  I've gotten quite used to feeling the baby kicking and whatnot.  So I've been missing it all week so far.  Kate's back tomorrow so I'll get to feel some more kicking again soon.  It's really cool cuz I have figured out how to get the baby to kick to my voice and prodding.    Oh well, I've been busy trying to get into Honda so I've been a little preoccupied in my thought and I'll survive.  By the way, Honda gave my boss a call yesterday for a reference so it's looking pretty good.  I just can't wait to get this process over with so I can start focussing on other things.  I've been blabbing about it all week to everyone that will listen and I'm sure it's getting annoying.  So now I stop

       Hey all,   Well I wnet for my physical testing today at Honda and it went pretty well.  I think I did good at it and I think I did well at the hand/eye coordination test thanks to all the video gaming I've done over the years.  So now it's just the waiting game to see if they want me.  I think it's looking good as the physical test was supposed to take about 90 minutes to complete and I did it in 70 minutes.  The only problem that I can forsee is they straped a heart rate monitor to my chest and after a particular grueling exercise I had to wait a minute for my heart rate to go down.  We'll see though.  So now they have to check my references and score me on my interview which I believe I did very well in.  Then I'll get the call for yea or nay...  I'll keep you posted

       Well I went for my second interview today and I believe it went pretty well.  I think it went better then my first one and I got a call an hour and a half after my first one.    Honda wants me to come for the physical test tomorrow.  It involves stooping, bending, lifting, walking, pushing, pulling, gripping, pinching and a few other things.  It's 90 minutes long.  Quite a long physical test I think.  Oh well, gotta do what you gotta do.  So I think its looking good that I'm going to become a Hondroid in the near future.  I'll let you know how it goes.

       Hey all, just wanted to let you all know that I've decided to change career fields completely.  I've decided to hang up the social worker shoes and try my hand at the car factory field.  Due to the fact that I could be making close to $30.00/hour putting cars together in about a year and a half and it would take me at least 15 more years to reach that in social work, it wasn't a tough decision.  I went for my first interview at Honda in Alliston on the 25th and they told me that I'd hear from them in about 7-10 days and I heard back in an hour and a half to come for a second interview.  That's a good sign I assume.  So, tomorrow I have my second interview and I'm pretty confident as they are hiring around 200 people and my first interview went very well.  Wish me luck everyone.  I'll post on Wednesday and let everyone know how it went.

       If you all don't know this by now you have been living in a cave.  Kate is having a baby in September.  She is due on September 15ish.  She's had about 3 different due dates and the latest is the 21st.  So we're going with the 18th for now.  We're registered at Sears right now so if anyone wants to buy us some stuff then that's the place to go.  But we'll take anything to be honest. Used strollers, clothes, vast amounts of cash...  Whatever your hearts desires.  Well thought I'd just do a quick little blog about what's happening with us since I'm kinda new at this.  Later  Dave

       Well I'm here in Sarnia this weekend for my parents little golf tournament and thought I'd write a quick post to say hi to everyone.  The golf tournement was at the holiday inn golf course here in town and I figured I'd have this one wrapped up for sure as I play on a par 3 course all the time. I shot a +6 and thought that would be good enough and then I find out when we are all done that my Dad had the best game of his life and he shot a +4 and beat me be 2 shots... Oh well. Good for him.  Work is getting better for me as I can now do 4 different jobs by myself without a trainer! I'm a big boy now! I don't need any help!!! Hooray for me!  I'm still getting the numbness in my hands when I wake up in the morning which is starting to get pretty annoying.  My flabby social worker muscles are starting to get whipped into shape a little and I'm not too sore anymore.  I'm found a real appreciation for baths with Epson salts though.  I just wish my tub was a little bigger.  Last night I got the chance to use my folks jucuzzi though.  That was nice.  Well gotsta run.  Heading back to Aurora in about half an hour or so.

       Hey folks, just wanted to let you all know that I'm not dead or anything yet. I'm doing quite well and am really enjoying the new job. I don't have access to the net very often so my posts may few and far between. Right now I'm at the library using the net, so 'm able to punch a few words down.  Honda is going good.  Right now I'm on 5 different jobs and today I will be signing off on my first one so I don't have to have someone watching over my shoulder constantly.  Three of the other 4 jobs are going good and I should have those wrapped up by the end of this week.  The one job that I'm having problems with is COUPLING.  I have to climb in the car and hook up about 7-10 different little couplers (electrical component involving to pieces that push together and click) and it is a killer on the back.  It will come though in time.  I'm on afternoons this week and I don't have to work untill 4:30 this afternoon.  Lunch is at 8:30 pm though and that may be a little hard to get accustomed to.  The main problem I have had to deal with so far is that from Wednesday to Saturday I was waking up and finding that my hands had gone numb.  That scared me a bit as it sounds like the onset of carpel tunnel syndrome.  On Sunday morning I went to the walk-in clinic to see what the doctor said about it and he said that it would work itself out and not to worry about it.   OK....  Thanks for the help doc...     It's better today as I've had three days to recouperate and no pain or numbness today at all.  Well my hour is almost up and I have a few more things to do still so I better get running.    REPRESENT!
