      &nbsp; Naku naman.... grabe tong ulan na 'to. Kung kelan di ako nagdala ng payong eh, tsaka umulan! Ayun, edi nabasa ako...I mean, kami. Hehe. Alam nyo na yun. Epal kasi yung ulan, wrong timing! hehe. Ayun, naiwan sya dun sa school. Pinauna na nya ako. Well, eto na naman nga pala ako para dumaldal. (dapat kanina ko pa to sinabi noh?) Well, isa lang ang alam kong sure na nangyari....umulan. At umuulan parin. Waaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!! O sige, serious na...ehem... Wala naman talagang nagyari ngayong mahalaga. Nag-debate kami sa Filipino, at naging napakaingay nun. Syempre pati ako maingay noh. Bukas naman, debate ulit. Naku, kalaban ko ba naman si Peejay??? Ano laban ko dun?? Baka mag-collapse lang ako!!! Hehehe. Tapos may ginawa kami sa Physics na sobrang nakakatwist ng utak, but somehow na-gets ko naman. Sa T.H.E. naman, aba, mantakin nyo, may surprise recitation! Kaya lang di pa'ko tinatawag, bukas pa. Kaya mamaya, aaral ako. Tapos sa math naman, nag-check kami, ayun 16/20 lang aku...huhuhu... Nde, ok lang yun! At sa last subject namin.... wala kaming teacher! Inantay lang namin mag-4:50!!! Tapos ayun, lumusong na kami sa ulan. Sino pa ba kasama ko?? Edi ang ninja ko...kayo talaga. O sya sige, kakain muna 'ko. Byeeee!!!!!!!!

      &nbsp;Well...I can't think of any title kasi eh. As you can see. Nothing much really happened during the past two days. As usual, I'm back in my daily routine as a student. Lots of assignments, projects, meetings...etc. Yesterday, the induction of classroom officers and the SGO officers were held. Mary Grace Don was the elected SGO president...How I like a very beautifula nd talented lady president! hehehe. Today, July 20,&nbsp; as I said, nothing much happened. We had a quiz in Bible (a subject in our school). Fortunately, I got a perfect score...hehehe. And then, in our T.H.E. subject, my classmates and friends, Katrina and Michelle reported on the other two kinds of "canning"...hehe. And by the end of the day, we had a meeting on the school journal! Actually, we were going to have our practice on our presentation tomorrow, but my groupmates left so soon, I wasn't able to catch them...hehe. Now, that'll be my problem for tomorrow! Hehe...anyway! On Thursday...I think...we will have our debate! Whew! And tomorrow, we'll have three quizzes. First is in English, second is in Computer and third is Filipino! What a day! hehehe...Anyway, that's how life goes! Well, I think that's enough for now... Oh wait! May I add another. We're going to make longanisa for our T.H.E. subject! I don't even know how to do that! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      &nbsp;Whew! All I can say is that... I think I had a dull day. Maybe because it rained hard, and it's still raining hard. It lessens my spirit and makes me feel lazy. Makes me dive into a deep slumber! Hehehe... But I can't, 'cause I still have assignments to do... and of course, an online diary to update and maintain! Nyahaha... But at least I have a big accomplishment this day! It's my first time to finish reading a pocket book!! And for me I think this calls for a celebration! Wanna join me??!! Nyahaha!! But one thing is sure still... I hate the brown-out!!! Damn that! It's so humid and it made me feel really sticky and really sleepy! But ironically, I can't sleep because it's so hot! I was already thinking that the rain intentionally stopped to give way to the heat made by the brown-out! I really hate it now! Oh well... I think this is enough... Gotta do my assignments first... And do a classmate a favor! hehehe... Hi Xtian! Don't worry, I'll do your favor! See yah!

      &nbsp; Y'know, I was supposed to post this yesterday (July 17, 2004) , but unfortunately, I ran out of time. Well, it's better late than never huh! Well, yesterday was....uh...great! Really great!! I started my day with a very great and special person! None other than my "koibito" . Well, gomen to those who didn't get me...hehe.&nbsp; All I can say is, I really missed being with him, exchanging silly jokes and tickling eachother...hehe.. literally. I was going to school to uhm...uh... to wax the floor with my groupmates. He accompanied me all the while, until I went home. Oh...waxing the floor is really tiring, but well, it's kinda exciting! At least we did it as a group! Then after a tiring job at school, I went home and was really really sleepy! I was just going to bed when my uncle arrived. ( wrong timing! ) He came to fix our internet connection. Well, thanks to him! Or else I won't be typing here...whehehe. And y'know what? I really didn't know what happened to my appetite! First, I ate "pancit", then a sandwitch, I drank iced tea, then I ate pasta, then I drank chocolite! Good thing my stomach didn't react wildly! Hahaha... 'Cause I still have to go to church to hear the mass... We arrived home at about 9:30 pm and I decided to try reading a pocket book; a Filipino pocket book! Yay! It's not like me!! Nyahaha! Well, it's just a try anyway! hehe. And I just finished it this afternoon! Well...check out the next post! ja!
