       I use to be embarassed about this but... I sing all the time. Is that weird? Seriously, like, all the time. When I get up, I usually listen to my morning show (yay... Sarah and NoName on Alice97.3), but after that, it's all music, all the time. In the car, at work, at home. I'm surprised nobody tells me to shut up.    I had a management meeting yesterday which I was late for because I had to go to FedEx to pickup the new acoustic Gavin DeGraw (which, by the way, is AWESOME!) I was rockin out to it all the way home, up the hills to the meeting, and all the way back home. I'll have to dedicate a BLOG just to Gavin in the future...   Right now, I'm listening to Ashlee Simpson (at work, mind you). And...I'm rockin' out. Well, not as much as I would if I was by myself, but still... It seems to calm me down. I think I would quit if I couldn't have my music. Seriously, I would rip my hair out.    I was watching people driving on my way to work today and nobody looks happy. I'll randomly see someone singing in the car and they look weird. I think "Man, do I look like that?" But then I think, "I don't really care - I'm having fun". But... what's up with all y'all? What do you listen to? Why do you look so miserable? Sheesh! OK - back to pretending I'm a recording artist!  :) :)

       Dear God/Customer Service,    &nbsp;  It seems as though, a little while ago,&nbsp;I lost the "Life Manual" you provided me. I'm really not sure what I did with it and, frankly, I'm&nbsp;quite lost without it. I tried to go on, thinking I could figure things out,&nbsp;but that doesn't seem to be working too well. Each time I come upon a fork in this road of life, I will make a choice, be content with it, and,&nbsp;somehow, it&nbsp;ends up&nbsp;to be the wrong choice. We must not be on the same wave length.     &nbsp;  In an effort to curb my perpetual cluelessness, I would like to request that&nbsp;you would be so kind as to send or email&nbsp;another copy to me &nbsp;(both address should be on file). I would be more than willing to pay any applicable fees necessary.     &nbsp;  Thank you in advance.    &nbsp;   - Magdalena   &nbsp;

       i HATE when CDs don't have lyrics included! I'm usually pretty good at deceifering lyrics, but sometimes, I have no idea what the heck they're saying! There's actually a&nbsp;cool web site that has a lot of lyrics&nbsp;which I&nbsp;check out on&nbsp;occassion (it's - duh -  urlLink www.lyrics.com ), but it doesn't have&nbsp;everyone. Like, when I went to the Gavin DeGraw concert a few weeks ago, Marc Broussard opened for him and he was AWESOME! So, I got his CD. Since he's a new artist, the CD case is just blah. And, of course, there's no lyrics! I tried lyrics.com, but he's not listed (which wasn't a suprise), but I tried googling lyrics to no avail. UGH! Most of the songs are clear, but there's one which he's talking about France and he's got some French words in it which I don't recognize. Oh well... I'll just keep pretending until&nbsp;he gets big enough to be listed.

       A friend of mind and I have a debate going. When you are  with  someone, should you still openly check out people? I mean not, like, get with them - that would be wrong, but&nbsp;checking out&nbsp;a hot guy/girl that you see or whatever. She says yes. Her argument is that it's human nature and that it keeps the&nbsp;guy in line cuz it gives the impression that, if they don't treat you right, you have other options. I agree that it is human nature, but you should keep it to yourself just for the sake of the person you're with - their feelings, ya know? Although, I do see her point. The only thing is, I think you should know how self-confident the other person is before you just start oogling over someone. Cuz, if you're not careful, that is a bomb waiting to explode. I guess since I'm in that boat, I sorta disagree with her. I mean... seriously... it has to sting   a little   when you see the dude you're with checking out someone chic (especially if that chic he's checking out&nbsp;looks totally different from you). I mean, especially though the last few months of debating divorce, daydreaming about Gavin and&nbsp;John Mayer has kept me going, but I don't know if I would continue&nbsp;that when I get with someone and, unless I get a shot of self-confidence serum, I wouldn't want that to happen to me.&nbsp; Anyways... those are my thoughts...and our debate continues...

       I've been thinking about this for a while. What the heck is the point of marriage? I've been hearing Halle Berry talking about her&nbsp;3rd failed marriage and how Eric Benet is going to try to get around the prenup. It just makes me think that Goldie Hawn has it right! If things don't work out, she can leave or Kurt Russel can leave. When there is a stupid piece of paper involved, it just messes everything up. If two people are committed then they should just move in, have kids, yada yada yada. I know that&nbsp;from a legal standpoint, there's a whole set of reasons but I'm just going to ignore that for now.    Look at J.Lo&nbsp;for instance. She just looks like a retard - how many guys has&nbsp;she married now? four? five? (almost - if things didn't get weird with Ben) If she just dated them and&nbsp;moved in together, then it wouldn't look as bad. I mean - hello! - people change, things happen. How should I know that I want to stay with someone for the rest of my life???    My soon-to-be-ex-husband was a gentleman when we got together - I felt loved and cared for. Then, we got married and moved in together and things went downhill. Before we discussed divorce, I felt like I was getting $350/wk to cook, clean, do bills, and be his personal servant. On second thought, that would actually be nice - I had the added joy of endless arguments and guilt-trips. I NEVER thought it would come to this when I said "i do".    I'm not ruling out marriage in the future like Halle. But, at least I have my eyes open now. There are a&nbsp;lot of happy couples where one or both people have gotten divorced before. Look at Will Smith - him and Jada are so adorable!    OK - I'm done ranting now. Back to work...

       I went to the Maroon 5/John Mayer concert on Friday with a friend and we saw Steve Young when we were walking back to the car. He's 43 but is really hot. That's kinda weird thing to say&nbsp;- he's almost old enough to be my father - but still.... Anyways, so, before I went to sleep, I was thinking about that. Then, he was in my dream!&nbsp;We were chattin it up on the steps of a library and we were totally flirting with each other -&nbsp;he was holding my hand and we were talking about football.&nbsp;It was cool. I woke up and it just put me in a good mood. It's weird cuz, since I've been&nbsp;in this pre-divorce stage, I've been having all these dreams about&nbsp;getting with guys. It's usually celebrities but sometimes it's just random guys. It's encouraging, but&nbsp;I have to resist the urge to let it depress me. I have to just take 'em at face value, ya know?&nbsp;About a week ago, I dreamed that I was beating up my soon-to-be-ex-husband. THAT WAS AN AWESOME DREAM!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       I love changing my hair color. Why is that? It's weird. It's like I think I'm going to become a different person or something. It's cool, though. First I did blonde highlights. Then I did it so much that I hated it so I went really dark red. That was cool, but it made me look really white. Then, I did light brown which was really cool. Now I'm back to the blonde. But like Jessica Simpson blonde. It's cool. I think it matches with my skin better. Then, I could play with my makeup - it's cool. I just bought s'more hair dye and I'm ganna touch-up my roots this weekend. It's so exciting!!!

       I really think I'm going through a quarter-life crisis (to quote John Mayer). I really want to just leave Cali, but everyone I divulge my crazy plans to&nbsp;thinks I'm... crazy. I went to NY in 1997 and I just fell in love with the city. It's just so lively. California just depresses me. I mean, the weather is great, but&nbsp;I just feel like I'm in a rut. I'M F-ING 24! This just sucks. I don't think I'll go through with it, but the thought is just making me crazy. I keep hoping that God will just give me a sign - every time I hear a mention of New York I think it's a sign. Is that crazy? I think so... UGH! I think I'll take a little vacation and check it out. Ya, that sounds good. It makes me sound saner, doesn't it?

       So... I had a fun time trying to choose a blog name. I listened intently to the lyrics in my favorite CDs to get inspiration and then it came to me... perpetually clueless... that's perfect. not to say that i'm dumb or anything! it's just that... well... how come whenever i think i've got a relative hold on life, something always seems to get f-ed up? so i thought... perpetually clueless... ya, that's usually how i feel on a day-to-day basis. It's OK - i've learned to accept it.

        I got invited to my friend's baby shower yesterday which, without hesitation, I agreed to. I knew it was in Richmond (about an hour away), but she's a good friend so... whatever. I got a gift on Friday, mapquest-ed directions, and set the alarm. I have 6 WONDERFUL CD's in the car which I can sing my heart out to:    1: Ashlee Simpson   2: Gavin DeGraw acoustic   3: Maroon 5   4: John Mayer "Heavier Things"   5: Marc Broussard "Carencro"   6: Avril Lavigne "Let Go"   The invitation said it starts at 2pm and I was there about 5 after. I got there, and her sister answered the door and there was NO ONE THERE! Then, I realized - her and her husband are Latino - they're on Latin time. Now I feel weird - especially since she wasn't even there. Oh well. I just hung out a little and chatted a bit with her sister. Then, she came and we hung out until her family got there (around 2:30). As everyone started coming, I began to realize - I AM THE ONLY WHITE PERSON HERE! Not only that, but they don't really speak English. OH Lordy - I really shouldn't of come here. I figured - OK - it's about 3 now. I'll just eat and then leave. So, we all ate and I hung out with her and her husband a little. Then, at about 4:30 I told her that I'm going to leave cuz it'll take me about an hour and a half to get home.   And there I am... back to my CDs! And, for some inexplicable reason - my A/C only turns on at the very highest setting.    UGH! THIS REALLY SUCKS! So, what do I do? Swing into Macys to check out what they've got. I didn't buy anything (althought here were a lot of cute thing) - I just looked around.
