      so here we are.   notice the blatant stealing of matt's "music i'm listening to right now" styles. when in doubt, borrow strategically from the masters.  friday afternoon. week 5 of sports camp over and done already. stumbled my way through another laid-back caffeine fueled friday with fin and ali and the little silverbacks. thursday-night-kalli probably thinks this little game is hilarious. oh, foufones ladies night, look whatcha gone and done to me now.   exciting messages about laura g and jana + joe visiting montreal this weekend. splendid development.  in other news, gonna go take apart my soon to be reclaimed bed with nazarin.   moving day tomorrow!!!  but before I go, some beautiful detail from everyone's favourite deep south poet, david berman (of 'silver jews' fame)  "It all reminds me of that moment when you take off your sunglasses after a long drive and realize that it's earlier  and lighter out than you had accounted for."  ---from "The Charm of 5:30" in his book kaija lent me, "actual air"

      i think it has rained on about 17 of my 23 birthdays. and not just rained. poured, thundered, blown small trees over. my mom told me i was born in a thunderstorm. she once told me a theory about how dylan, daniel and i have personalities that somewhat mirrored the weather at the time we entered the world: me, a stormy, humid, noisey august night. dylan, a serene sunny may afternoon. daniel, the only major snowstorm of the season that year in toronto. i always liked that theory. i've probably embellished.  even in the early morning sunshine on tuesday, i knew the rain would come. and it did. and so did the electrical storm. hitting a peak around the time i was biking home from dance class at 8:30. but lo and behold, 14 or so intrepid montrealers braved those flooded streets and dance club skies. and we were rewarded with the chuck e. cheese of the twenty-something birthday : le lotus bleu. probably the only bring your own wine vietnamese place in town with such a conveniently and stylishly covered terrasse. rain on, rain on...  good wine, bad wine, fried bananas impaled with umbrellas and sparklers. roddy doyle, warhol, keats, peach berserk, louis garneau. soulful ireland, stoned wheat, tied barley, creeping vines. japanese punk art, homemade cards and jager.  such a night of surprise sweetness and good laughs. and at the end there was a hot bagel.  wednesday. lying half-conscious on the grass of fletcher's field, the steady stream of cars swooshing down the hill on ave. du parc sounded so much like rollers crashing steadily on the beach that i could almost hear the drone of the kokrobite fishermen's call. hardened bodies bracing against the heaving rope. hardened voices chanting in imperfect unison. the sun on my face, for a moment, felt warm enough to remind me of early morning runs. a quick dip and then the sand between my toes. for a second i thought i could smell someone cooking beans and sauce.  ghana visits often these days. in flashes. like the momentary memories the day after a rollicking drunken night. like a victim's vision of blood and glass, weeks after a car crash. like a misplaced snapshot falling unexpected out of a book. like memories of the touch of a long lost lover, coming back to haunt the senses. as if only a few hours had passed.  i've been trying to grab on hard to these moments of recollection. i've been trying to figure out where they fit into the web of past, present and future in my mind that is somehow under the heading "Ghana." all i know is that i have an undeniable feeling that all of these little fragmented pieces need to be pulled together. weighed against and between each other. allowed to mingle and converse a bit. it seems that there's a feeling, a realization, an experience, something connecting them all. one that is greater than the sum of its parts. one that i hope will eventually become more clear. when it does, i would love for it to be accompanied by a neon arrow floating above my head. pointing me the way forward.

      tired, tired bones. and a stuffed-up nose. but the following moments are a few among many from this past weekend that make how i feel right now 100% worth the trouble:  - the triumph of sidewalk chalk messages and serendipitous people-watching on the part of chelsea, kate and corey leading to the lovely brightening of alyssa's birthday, last-minute ticket style  - unamplified drum sounds, sweat soaked backs through paperthin tshirts and over-the-shoulder keyboard views from the sweetest, hottest opera box spot ever at modest mouse and wolf parade at the rialto  - making the 6:55 am train to k-town with 3 minutes to spare. flawless.  - wind through my air and oldies on the radio, cruising around the islands on lake ontario  - listening to the irishmen reach full tilt as kate threw down the stepdancin' hammer and the stinky foot scent of dutch cheese overpowered the wine  - "so we're all in the driveway, but did anyone actually call a cab?"  - "i mean, with all the shit women go through with their bodies an' everthing. i'd be up for testing out the ol' mood swings on the male birth control pill"  - breakfast burrito and owen's fistfulla cheerios at the sleepless goat  - baby photos  ...nice.

      this post is dedicated to the almighty wd4o. and to the following other tried and tested things in this world which just really make sense:  - modest mouse - big bathtubs - baby carrots - soy delicious ice cream - fenders (of the bicycle variety...other types too, i suppose) - rainbow sidewalk chalk - two-drain kitchen sinks - balconies - hoodies - kitchen music - slow dancing  ...can't believe the date box says aug 5. wha? modest mouse tomorrow. kingston this weekend. otown/grace's wedding next weekend. only one more weekend in montreal before ....SCHOOL...birthday fun on tuesday...oh august, why don't you take your shoes off? sit down and stay a while. come on now.  with regards to ontario-bound plans for the weekend of the 13th-15th. if ANYONE reads this and is planning on travelling toronto-bound on the friday or montreal-bound on sunday anywhere in the general montreal-kingston/ottawa-orillia/muskoka corridor(s), please help me dodge the via rail money train at least one way.  um, does anyone else get that stomach sinking with the sun feeling in their stomachs when they realize that what were once 9:30 sunsets are now at 9:00? at least falling leaves brings returning friends and student loan cheques and fiery mont royal. gotta buck up. skipping a year of winter makes my toes turn white just thinking about november.  scarves. fuzzy, fuzzy scarves. and mittens.

      some days mcgill sports camp makes me wonder how much like or unlike my current self i would be had i been switched at birth and raised by westmountians. summers at the country house with my tennis court and water trampoline. sushi in my lunchbox. designer kids outfits. getting my sweaty summer bum stuck on bmw leather seats.   what is happiness for a kid from the Boulevard?  would i still think that an apartment with sticky drawers and creaky floors and an old porcelain bathtub was perfect? would i still walk 6 extra blocks for 1 dollar cheaper beer? would i ever have called a 50 dollar gst refund "joyous?" would i still buy sidewalk chalk at the dollar store? for that matter, would i be in montreal? in debt? in aux vivres? would i be wearing oversized, one-pocketed, red mcgill all-purpose jock uniform shorts?  or would i be on an internship on a tropical island for an indeterminate number of years? drinking coconut milk and writing messages for the sea turtles in the sand.
