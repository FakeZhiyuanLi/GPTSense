      I came home for lunch today.  My roommate came home shortly thereafter.  He had just come from the humane society.  He had cats picked out.  We drove to the humane society.  We picked out two cats and decided to play with them to see how they liked us.  Shortly thereafter, we found out the cat my roommate wanted had already been adopted.   I WIN!   His name is Gilmour.  He is black with a white underbody, paws, and bottom half of his face.  He was a bit skittish when I first brought him in the house, but after about an hour, he calmed right down.  He just took a break from playing in my lap to go take a nap on the chair.  Hopefully he stays just as calm as he is now.

      So, I'm pretty sure I invented the Internet-mostly word "meh".  I was using it in '95-'95 or so and never saw anyone using it at the time.  Now, it's a phenomenon, so... I'm laying claim to it... Start paying me royalties.  Anyway, I had an overall good weekend.  I went away to a wedding in Akron with my lady.  Not much to report other than I spent too much money.  The wedding was pretty cool though.  The couple tried to forgo all the standard wedding crap (the garter, the money dance, etc.), but the groom's mother kept pushing the DJ (my roommate) to do stuff like YMCA and the Electric Slide.   Oh, and I got lost 2 times while driving to the bar the night before the wedding and 1 time on the way from the wedding to the reception... wheee!  A good weekend on the whole, until this evening.  I had settled in with m'lady to watch Helter Skelter, the silly Charles Manson movie on CBS.  TV Movies are typically cheezy, but this one was alright, I think.  I say "I think" because Lynn ended up getting a call from her sister halfway through the movie.  Lynn was sitting near talking to her sister for about 15 minutes, so it was very difficult to concentrate on the movie because I was trying to listen to her conversation as well.  Of course, it was about the baby.  Of course, Lynn's sister wants us to keep it.  I listen.  Lynn appears to defend her case quite well.  She leaves the room, and I watch Sadie and Tex and Katie and all the others kill Shannon Tate and the Folgers chick and all is good.  About a half hour is left in the movie and Charlie is on pre-trial.  Lynn comes back into the room and curls up on me and cries.  She's having second thoughts again.  It always seems like she has second thoughts about the whole thing after talking to her family.  I tried to calm her down.  I think I made some really good points that she took to heart, but we'll see.  She knows I'll support whatever decision she makes, but that doesn't make it any less stressful.  We've got 7 weeks until the kiddo comes (July 4th at the latest, hurray for induction), and she's still wavering.  We'll see what happens.

      So today I accompanied my lady as she drove her brother to an AA meeting.  The meeting was a 45 minute drive away in the middle of nowhere.  N   O   W  (us)  H   E   R   E  Seriously, the largest town within a short distance was 10 minutes away and was about 700 people.  So... to pass the time, we went to the local park and played on the swings.  As we sat there we decided to come up with names for our soon to be born child: the boyspawn.    We are giving him up for adoption to his aunt and uncle, but directly after birth, the name that goes on the birth certificate is one of our choosing.  We were thinking of naming him (forgive the spelling):    Aloysius Devadander Abercrombie Balwinski-Hildreth III   after the Primus song "My Name is Mud", but we figure that might do some damage when he gets to see his real name.  So instead we came up with this list of first names:   Sajon Paren Mead Noel Parker    Not bad for 20 minutes of thinkin'.  This got us talking about names for my soon-to-be cat, Here's what we've got so far:   Huxley Orwell Aldous Major Minor Analog   There were more, but I can't remember them right now :(  After a cerain point, we were just thinking up names and deciding if they were good boy or cat names.  We're weird.  Oh yeah.... and my roommate thought of "Gilmour" when I got home.  That may be the front-runner right now. Oh yeah, that's for the cat, not the boy.  Though it's not a bad boy name either.... hmmm....

      Sittin' at home, waiting for... waiting for nothing really.  Just decided I should start a blog cuz, well, I had one a long time ago on diaryland.com (before I knew of the word 'blog').  It was a great way for me to get my emotions out on paper, or a paper facsimile, without worrying too much about what was being said.   Anyway... I'm gonna go watch some TV now and think about ordering food.    mmmmm, Crab Rangoon.
