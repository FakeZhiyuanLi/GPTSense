       Chapter 1: Unintended Meeting  It was around 12:00 am on April 19, 2004. A rain cloud hung over the city of Makati as I walked these dirty desolate streets... Ayala, where all the well known malls are to be found. Always found to occupy thousands of people shopping, dating, eating, conducting buisness and whatever normal people usually do in their everyday lives... but it was midnight, and I was walking this street all alone, accompanied only by the few cars driving off home and a few bums here and there lying on the street. The lights guide the way for me, Edsa is where I'm headed. My head drooped lower as the rain poured harder on my back. I was freezing, walking half concious not noticing the scenery around me... what's there to see in this city anyway? There are just massive buildings that are found here anyway, buildings used for office, or residential purposes. It's a shame I don't know too many people living here except for my big brother and a couple of friends I barely know. I stopped by G4's lobby and shook myself dry.  I reached deep in my jean's back pocket and took out the brand new pack of Marlboro red's; which has slightly been wet by the rain; took a stick and lodged it in my lips then gave it a light. It was a sad day for me. I took a deep long puff from my cig and I tried to clear my mind. I was soaked. The street lights blinks at me furiously a couple of meters away from me and all I could hear was the pit-pattering of the rain as it fell on the hard asphalt road. I wasn't alone after all on that night, 3 or 4 people were there with me just wanting to escape the rain. One of them was an attractive young woman that appeared to be in here early twenty's. She was wearing a black hoody sweater with the words 'I like boys with tattoos' sewn in the front. And she had a tight dark blue bell bottom pants on. She looked cold; as did the guard who was probably on the grave hour shift; I didn't really pay attention to the other people. I just gazed at the street shown in front of me. The rain is actually a beautiful sight, it's a shame it doesn't feel that way when your under it.  I figure the rain would last longer than usual so I slid down against the wall. Sitting there as I watched nature do it's work. I took another puff from my cigarette, turned my head up high and blew a smoke ring at the ceiling of the mall's lobby. I was thinking of what my consequences would be once I get home. Would anyone find out I skipped from the house to get hammered? Most likely. I just hoped no one came down to check up on me. Whilst I pondered on, I overheard the woman in her early twenty's cuss and fight over the phone. I just stared at her in a dazed way and didn't even bother to make out the conversation she was having. She caught me staring at her, and she turned away and moved a bit farther from me. Paranoid bitch. I stared once again at the ceiling. I wondered on what it was made of... was it marble? It looked like marble, too bad it's high up for me to go and touch it's surface. The guard paced back and forth at his space and rambled on his walkie-talkie. And as for the other people they have gone into a taxi and drove off for home probably... "Why don't I get a taxi" you might be thinking if you ever met me in this situation. I'm broke.  I stood up from where I was seated and threw the cigarette I had in between my fingers. The woman wasn't on the phone anymore, but she still seemed pretty upset as she reached for a cigarette, it appears that she didn't have a lighter, cause she threw a short fit. I came up to her. I whipped out my lighter and offered her a light "Rough night eh?" I said as she reached over to light her cigarette. "Yeah pretty rough night... and you?" she replied. "Same here... alright then, I'll be back over there." I said as I put my lighter back in my back pocket. I didn't know why I did that but it can't be helped, I already done it. So once again I sat in the place I was at earlier staring once again at the street... it was quite hazy now as the rain poured harder... The woman came over to me, and asked if she could sit with me. I was shocked. You never ever find people like that over here, especially in the streets, sure at the clubs you could, but where I was sitting, never. "Sure" I said as I scooched over...  I leaned my head against the wall as she slid down beside me. Once again I found myself staring at the ceiling thinking, that the wall must be made of marble, or if it isn't, maybe it's black smooth tiles that look like black marble... idunno... My pondering has been broken by the woman's voice... "Ok, so tell me what are you doing here at a time like this?" She asked me with much ease... "And my name by the way is Sarah" She followed up... "Me? Idunno I figure it would have been a good walk in the rain, broke..." I said in reply to her question... "Oh ok... and ur name is?" Sarah asked showing a bit of dissapointment... "Would it even matter if I give you my name? I mean we won't probably see each other again anywhere anyway..." I said blurting out a short sarcastic laugh as I shifted my stare at her. "Fine, be sarcastic... I mean it was you who first opened up..." Sarah said as she flashed a face of distaste... "Alright, I'm Chris... nice to meet you" I said in a jokingly manner as I reached out my right hand for her to shake... "Nice to meet you too" She said as she took my hand and giggled a bit...  "If you don't mind..." Sarah said "I was wondering why you're broke..." My God what is this? An interview with the local folk here? I felt like I was in an internet chatroom. "I'm not sure I can tell you that information, I mean you have not yet told me your reason on why your out here." I said as I looked at the street again."Ok fair enough..." she started "I got too rowdy at the bar and my friends left me." Sarah finished... "That still doesn't explain why you're still hanging around here, I mean there are a few unoccupied taxis passing by here, you could've gotten one already and head on home" I said showing signs of distrust as I took my pack of cigarettes out... "Ok, if you want to know the whole picture that much I'll tell you then..." she said flashing me that distasteful look again... " I live at my friends condo, and since I went overboard at the bar earlier they left me there, and the reason I can't go home now is I lost my set of keys." She finished again... "Can't you just go there and just ring the doorbell constantly then?" I said in reply as I lit my cigarette... "You don't know how my friends are like... nevermind, you'll never understand."  The rain continued pouring, I was beginning to think this isn't just a normal rain but a typhoon. Sarah continued talking, and I just kept nodding at every question she laid on me, till finally... "Are you even listening me?" She said... I just simply said "Yup" "Ok what was I sayin earlier then?" she asked me "Uh... you were talking bout ur friends bein this and that and that they'll never let you in whatever you do etc... look I get you..." I told her in reply, she just said "Ok then... that's my story on why I'm here... and now it's your turn..." I was just thinking whether or not I should go and tell a stranger my situation, but I guess it's only right since she seems to have spilled me her story... "Ok..." I said as I took a long puff and blew 2 to 4 smoke rings...   "My reason of being here..." I started off... "is cause I overspent at the bar, nothing amazing about it, I just drank and gave all my buddies a treat, the thing is here though, they left me there." I took another puff and I noticed Sarah reaching for her own pack of cigs... "I mean I just went off to the restroom I came out they were just gone... the only thing they left me was a bill of all the extra orders they had..." "So how were you able to pay for it?" Sarah asked... "I didn't, well not all of it, I gave em all the rest of my cash and I told em I'd pay them back" I told Sarah as I lit her cigarette.       The rain slowed down, so I stood up and started walking. "Where are you going?" Sarah asked me as she too rose from the floor... "The rain isn't pouring hard anymore, so I'll continue my walk home... I suggest you go find a taxi and head on home too, or wherever you can sleep tonight" I said as I turned to answer her question... "So you're gonna leave me w/o saying goodbye or giving me a number?" Sarah said as she folded her arms... hmm I can't believe she's sayin these things, is it my charm? is it cause I took the time to talk and listen to her? I don't know, but whatever I did made her want to see me again... well in my perception of the whole scenario... "Ok... sure, why not, here's my number..." I said with a smile, and she noted my number in her phone. "Thanks" Sarah said flashing back a smile at me... "You take care then Sarah, bump into you some other time..." "You too..." Sarah said in reply, at this I turned and faced the cold wet street. I was once again walking home...

       Who was outside watching over a slow dying rat? was it me? I couldn't tell... As it was lying down on the hot hard asphalt covered street, it made me wonder... shall i share the same fate? A street cat appeared, watching the rat die in the corner of it's eye... already the cat is in it's position to pounce at the slow dying rat, and again, it makes me think... Is someone ready and waiting for me to die? Already is someone in his or her position to pounce? Ready to feast upon my soon lifeless body? Damnit! Someone always has to be on top of the food chain... and how i love how it works... Rat at a corner dying... will it die peacefully? Who knows?

      I've walked upon these streets before... damn... why am I here again? I guess now, cause I'm not walking but running... running towards something or away from something... the rain hasn't hit here yet, or has it ceased... I've never been so alone... and I've never been so alive... sunny days... burning... something's burning within me might it be my hate again?  or something else is fueling this burn... damnit...  running, such freedom... no one stopping me... no one in front of me... running wherever i want to... this fire burning, happiness... such happiness... hardly ever thinking of the cold dark pit i was in anymore... i'm not in it anymore, it's not gloomy anymore, it's just so sunny... What?!?

       Fastballs coming 'round my way Trying to evade each one everyday Every single package comes to me so simple Every step must be quick and nimble Took two steps back and slipped back to the past All the good times and fun didn't seem to last I got hit with a hard one, a sharp pain to the head The fastball knocked me out, i thought i was dead I awoke from the ditch which i thought was a grave Not once did i think that i would be saved Feeling as though i'm going against the tide losing my strength from each pushing stride i finally reached atop the ditch I saw myself on top, there must be a glitch I said to myself "I threw that fastball" "I threw it at you, so I'd make you fall" As I listened to each word Id said I realized that only i can mess with my head...

      I seem to space out almost every single day Dont' seem to care about what comes my way A collapse into a void still and silent as a droid Money comes around I throw it away Everything else I feel the same way A collapse into a void, still and silent space Staring at myself i see a blank, unknowing face The void grows bigger every single day If i continue staying this way

       Been staring at the clocks that seem to stare back Days seem to fade into the back of my mind The sands of my time drag on pulling me throught the ground Memories appear out of nowhere pices scattered in my head Been staring at the clocks that seem to drag on Seconds feel like hours it's been to long Can't fall asleep, falling fast at the state of insomnia Can't open my eyes easily drowning in eternal slumber Been staring at the clocks that warp my mind Time pulls me in losing sense of reality Reality is quickly turning into fantasy once again And fantasy is turning into reality

      Sitting at my porch Staring at the star-filled sky Smoking a cigarette Listening to some rock It makes me wonder makes me wonder You doing the same thing? Busy with poetry taking a break  As i look up at the sky today I feel a greater good staring back at me Fills me up and makes me wonder Are my dreams being shared with someone else?  The songs stuck in my head playing over and over Taking sips from my iced tea I'm pretty laidback Chillin around smoke myself a pack Walking to my room Fall on my bed all feeling sleepy Slip in some CDs volume's full blast  I stare at my ceiling Sounds from my system fill the air Filling up fast The sounds forever they last

      Have you ever asked yourself? What part did you play in someone's life If what you did had an effect, a consequence... Maybe that person is who they are because of you I have asked myself this question and found that i have denied the negative and fully accepted the positive actions to a person's well being,his/her becoming of a real person knowing that denial is a front, i broke it down I tore every brick down with my hands and found many mistakes in the development of many friends and family I wish I could go back, but i can't Have you ever asked yourself?

      Sometimes, I just close my eyes and go to sleep Dreaming dreams I know i shouldn't keep Where have I gone? Where have I been? All my thoughts lead back to Raine One of the few who made me feel alive again I'd loved alot and it's not the same I'd give too much and expect nothing in return My rainy days are over Sunny days have come to me again...

      It was a tiring day... or was it? Looking over my shoulder constantly hoping i would bump into someone who would cheer me up... it never happened... I just wandered on, going wherever my feet could carry me... effortlessly i walked on not having a care to where i would be headed... just follow your feet...  no need to look back... just walk on... no matter how tired you are... smiles, left and right... all flashing at me... damn you happy people... I'm envious of you all... i wonder what makes you smile? even in this  dark and gloomy day... damn you... while i trudge on these cold cold hard roads you mock me with your smiles... is it because you people know i can't? how placid must your lives be?  to not have a worry... to not ever draw a frown on your faces... to have all the time to do what you want to do... and how warm it must feel for you who has arms wrapped around you... damn you all... must you torment me with your laughs and giggles... must i always fulminate your actions... am i so garrulous about my hate towards happiness? why do i generate such anger? it must be the weather... everything is so abstruse... or must it be, i choose not to? i ponder on without sense... it is natural for me... i spot a woman, at first overwhelmed with sadness, but a message soon after came, and brought her much happiness... damn you... you are so fortunate... I tire of looking within... so much as in looking out...

      I was at starbucks today, sipping on my cafe mocha... sitting alone at one table, wanting to feel the loneliness looking at couples in there tables conversing... torturing myself, i don't understand why i'm looking  for ways to hurt myself... to bring me much more pain i want so much to numb myself, someone kill me! i scream from within... no one is ever interested in me no one ever wonders where i am... and it's good i'm not important, why should the world stop turning if i ask it to? i love getting ticked at myself for stupid shit i love it when i'm hated... hate me more cigarette butts on the floor... i need more of you to hate me... i'm not numb enough... that is one thing i haven't expierienced, pure numbness of self being... i want that... i want to reach the point where nothing could bother me even for a day...i believe it to be atainable... i just need your help title of the "most empty man" is what i want...

      it has engulfed me once again... much stronger now, the pain and regret... it had swallowed me once... but i had survived... i crawled out from that pit bruised and battered by the constant mockery of my own hate... i've lived among the dark hoping to find a shred of light but alas, i couldn't... so i ventured to one pit after another... each and every time the same effect... vowing never to step back in ever again... but this time was different... i fell, not knowing how deep this chasm goes and in falling i have found a shred of peace and serenity thinking that something would break my fall at the end hoping i would not be disappointed at what lies beneath... what i thought came true, there was something there to break my fall but i was falling too fast, to fast that even it couldn't take my fall...  and so i lie there, broken beyond repair thinking that what i done was stupid... i fell too far down, too far for me to see the light too far for the light to see me...  darkness... total darkness... i lie there in a fetal position bones shattered, breathing heavily...

      What compells you to remember me? What is it i've done to make you cling onto me like a grapevine to a wall? Is it that hard?  I have dragged you so far... I've cursed this pathetic existence of a man... I've told you straight forward... but still... You remain still...  How far must my anger dive in your ocean? How hard should i be on you? What must i do to drive you away? Forget me... I'll be happy if you do...

        feelings... what are they really? especially love... it feels so good but hurts so bad... damn them... why must i fall to such a depth knowing  once i reach the end of the pit i know it'll cause so much pain? loneliness... can force you to much extent surpassing ur own capabilities pushing you to walk on... till you meet someone who you espect could take it all  away... but when they can't  anger comes into play... rage... yes it kills all other feelings.... rage has blinded me to the point that i feel nothing at all... and when all my anger has been drought... sadness to walk among the dead... that is sadness pure obliteration of one's mind and soul Damn them... damn them all! why must one such as i must expierience such a deep level of all these feelings? i have found peace, serenity, comfort with being alone and for many years... only to be shattered by love... To walk among the dead... you will find me...

      I have been staring at the monitor for days Lighting a cigarette after another only standing when the pack is done or only to throw the ashes that overflow my ashtray I can only imagine what my friends are doing whether I am or not in their thoughts "My own doing will lead to my demise" I remind myself often just before i sleep As always only my music keeps me company At least i have something to keep me sane Although at times i can only Imagine Who I'll be when i see your faces once again I have Changed and it scares me Will you also be the same as the other's Who have shrugged me off, cause of the state I'm in? I can only imagine...

        I am no coward, escape is temporary It is only a delay to what is to come inevitably which is truth, answers, the end I stand now because i face what comes to me and survive. that is the only way even if standing my ground will be the cause of  my demise I shall not run I will continue standing I will continue fighting for what i believe in whether it be right or wrong Running away is and forever will be the last thing on my mind...

I stood up and walked towards the kitchen 4:00 in the morning the clock glares at me Nothing in the refrigerator just left over fried chicken i gaze at the stove, thinking it would cook something for me  Cooking up a meal, damn i'm too lazy just grab some canned goods and shove it and nuke it Vinna sausage, pork and beans and corned beef too messed up to think, shit just blenderize the shit

I can knock off all your teeth Need medication for this soul  Am I so blind? whatever it is I cannot see Am I so kind? Read the warning label on the bottle please  What are your motives? They're pretty precise, planned carefully You're screwing around with my lack of judgement What's in this disease? That has got me fucked up to my knees You start me up with your own set of keys  Dementia got a rope around my neck Tight, too tight to breath You got me walking back and forth effortlessly The time has come Fot you to step out the door and leave This is just too much, just let me be

      I woke up, i couldn't believe it what i had expierienced was just a dream a fictitious feeling in a state of unconciousness forever have i pondered on whether or not i should forever sleep, expieriencing bliss and absolute happiness or to wake up into a cruel and confusing reality dreams... things i know that can only be manifested in my head, in my thoughts...  it is only i who can see them it is only i who can understand them and so it is only i who can understand myself no one else... loneliness i'll live alone, i always have And i will be in this state, even after death in my awakening i have found freedom i have found truth and it is beautiful yet tragic at the same time

        It is true that i have expierienced more than i should normally have, but i made this decision, i took this path. I have surpassed my peers not in age, nor in any physical attribute, i have surpassed them in wisdom... i am young but i have lived my life as if i was born in my 20's and continued on... i have lived a life enough for 2 generations. although i am at peace with my state of being, it sometimes saddens me that i have not lived my age, that i had not had a chance to be a kid... the simplicity and naivety of a young boy's mind and heart for something... i've expierienced much... I am young, but my mind has surpassed juvenility.. i feel old, think to mature... it's sad to know that i can never ever regress... but progress...

I am in a state of Halcyon That is all that matters to me right now...

Only a bolt of lightning can stop me now... Or probably a good friend... I'm too bored, I feel like a total loser I know i'm not what i used to be but i think i might just go out... even for awhile Everyone i know keep telling me It's for the best... just relax... take a rest But after awhile, this room starts to bore me So i might just go out... i'm all done thinking Time to put some action into my thoughts

       Well, here i am, waiting for my time to come unravelling these tangled pieces of what i done reality, slowly overwhelming me i've lost many friends cause i didn't want to stay  my time has come to be unglued searching memories of times i abused this mind ablur... alone and confused i just know you're waiting for me to lose  This addiction... is just too much to handle It laughs at me, as i continously stumble down this life i love... i lived it so fast and now i find myself just living in the past  I try to lean back, but there are thorns on my head i should've never tried knowing that i'd end up dead And now that I'm here, after all that i've done Where are my friends? to help me come undone?

      Alright so far all I knew of my blood was philippine, chinese, and hispanic, never have I known I had a drop of jewish blood in me, a drop of an ancient race driven from one domain to another, a race that had endured thousands of years worth of struggle and conflict... This new found knowledge explains alot, my main feature which in being; my nose... My knack of knowing how to get into and out of trouble... alot more... they say knowledge is brought down upon men through text and novelty, and recently noted, knowledge is brought down upon men by the origin of his blood,our paths have already been lain upon us even before our birth... it has been decided by our bloodlines... fascinating this new found truth...

      How many times will they do it  Taking what's mine and they tell me that I blew it.  What can you do; who me, yes you.  When bitches get scandeless and full of voodoo.  Catching my breath is the term I use when the world gives up on me.  Can you love or not? The truth finds all of us eventually.   I don't mind taking lives I find.  They all shine in my pocket at night.  You wonder why your always alone.  You never fit in you never could find a home,  and I don't need to second guess why,  your eaten by the anger and it makes it so hard to....   Love to love to love ya..ooh ooh   And please don't let me go, and please don't tell me no (who me yes you)

      Feeling feelings of hostility Won't someone come bother me Watching these people atop their high rise People glancing at me with their piercing eyes  These world that I have been Complicates the things I believe in And I'm constantly wondering why Is it that i look up at ths sky  Running down the trcks Still viewing works of art they all try to fool me And I'm wondering on smoking till the lights go off All around me and I'm Knocking at your door but much harder than before  The sky is looking dim I say The sky is lit in a beautiful gray Here alone in the Zone Makes me wish i was home

      Watch as I strum away,  you're fear pain and misery And hear all the soothing word's  I sing along the way I pluck, pluck pluck  At these 6 strings rapidly Hitting and missing  Sometime's my guitar's a gun you say  So I shoot you up with these funky rythms  while I shoot myself a tequila Whoa! Whoa!  While I look around Figuring what makes good sound Comforting really isn't it? I sweep your feet off the ground And so you you dance dance dance not minding what's around Listen to my radical funky sound Baby my guitar's a gun  So I shoot you up with these funky rythms  while I shoot myself a tequila Whoa! Whoa!

      You came in so slow, but your exit was quick And baby I thought that your loving was thick But I guess I was just too unsure about you And it was a bad idea to ever call you my boo-boo I'll show you how I want it if you come back my way Get down on your knees and take it the other way  These playgirls think they can mess with my head They like messing with it so take the other one instead  I've been totally wrong about you my boo-boo Tell me slut were the things you ever said to me were true? C'mon baby baby I'm waiting for it At first glance never in my head I thought you a trick Alright my boo-boo I'll let you go have your way But when you pass me my boo-boo still remember you owe me  These playgirls think they can mess with my head They like messing with it so take the other one instead

      And so say that I'll never stray so far away And never again will I ever feel that way The only thing that matters now is me being anywhere but here Cause wherever I roam your presence lingers there  And so my brother we will never separate And our memories of the past won't dissipate You may have gone but to me you stay My friend, my family to me you never have lain  I walk on with our memories intact I still haven't forgotten our secret pact To me and to all you have always said "I can't, I won't, I don't fade away"  My peace to you my cousin it's been over a year Anywhere but here cause wherever I roam your presence lingers there

      I've been cruising around looking for my only lady She's somebody I aint know, that's for sure but I've been down watching the sets Looking and looking till I couldn't catch my breath and I spot her resting over by the shade And now it's time to go and lay my charm but then a man came up and wrapped her in his arms so I walked out again looking for my buddies, Telling them someone come comfort me and But then I saw this pretty girl shining brightly And all of a sudden I was blinded suddenly by her light so bright and I couldn't even fight for her attention please come glance at me oh think you'd come to my way oh I'd like to think you'd come to my way Been dreaming again but my friends have butted in but I couldn't even move I was mesmerized wondering if that was a diguise I'm not smart nor am I wise I thought I've seen it all all the things that bring you awe But I guess I was wrong Oh baby please kill your lights it is far too bright shining too much this can't be right I'm blinded suddenly I'm suddenly blinded It doesn't really matter on how you arrange it but it's all the same...

      I've been waiting all this time, soliciting is my one crime  Take a step which way to go, with no permission from a ho  And I live with no disease, my back seats got remedies  I'll be part of history, with 15 books on my story  And be a swift like roddigan, equipt with the best selection  Wondering what you use, slipping off the booze cruise  And your focus turns to blur, when you set your eyes on her  As I turn away when she looks at me   And I'm a wanting watching you walk away  I will try to meet you by the old highway  And if it's now I'm down to slack  With the sun shown accross my back  And I'm comforted to know That you're backstage at my door  Why am I so short of your attention  Having this discussion downtown  No obligation, it's a real hard emotion  Now that your gone, I'm moving right along  Run down the road still viewing sluts, bowcats,  these ho's are trying to fool me  No promises you get the one time slam  Seductive sexy capers in the hilton tram  with this abuse of napkins  X-amount of heineken  Waking up's so hard to do when I'm lying next to you  So I'm knockin at your door, complicates the night before  She says the joke is on me, I said the joke is on her  Mary oh Mary, your still so quite contrary  How could you ever know   And I'm a wanting watching you walk away  I will try to meet you by the old highway  And if it's now I'm down to slack  With the sun shown accross my back  And I'm comforted to know That you're backstage at my door  Now that you're gone...

      Oh no- here comes that sun again.  And (that) means another day without you my friend.  And it hurts me to look into the mirror at myself.  And it hurts even more to have to be with somebody else.   And it's so hard to do and so easy to say.  But sometimes - sometimes,  you just have to walk away - walk away.   With so many people to love in my life, why do I worry about one?  But you put the happy in my ness, you put the good times into my fun.   And it's so hard to do and so easy to say.  But sometimes - sometimes,  you just have to walk away - walk away and head for the door.   We've tried the goodbye so many days.  We walk in the same direction so that we could never stray.  They say if you love somebody than you have got to set them free,  but I would rather be locked to you than live in this pain and misery.  They say time will make all this go away,  but it's time that has taken my tomorrows and turned them into yesterdays.  And once again that rising sun is droppin' on down  And once again, you my friend, are nowhere to be found.   And it's so hard to do and so easy to say.  But sometimes, sometimes you just have to walk away, walk away and head for the door.  You just walk away - walk away - walk away.  You just walk away, walk on, turn and head for the door.

      I was at the beach, sitting on the sand When I saw this girl Dark brown eyes, and a dark olive tan She was watching the sets With a surfboard underneath her arm The first moment I saw her I knew she'd do me some harm  She's so good She came out of the water From the best session I'd seen Man, she had the biggest chi chis I had ever seen She put down her board, and sat down next to me And played a soft ole lonely tune, on her ukulele I don't know what had happened But I'd fallen asleep The next morning I woke up She was sleeping next to me   I fell in love with her I'm so in love with her I fell in love with her My little Surfer Girl   She got out of bed Waxed up both our boards Grabbed me by the hand and then she took me out the door We surfed all that day long At least eight hours straight Man! I knew she was the one And damn I couldn't wait Well I asked if she loved me She said, "Yeah well I guess" So I asked her to marry me Dammit, you know she said "yes"   I fell in love with her I'm so in love with her I fell in love with her My little Surfer Girl   I was at the alter In my tuxedo-o-o Waiting for my Surfer Girl Man, where did she go Later on that day A friend to me did tell-ell-ell That she went to Mexico To catch a, to Catch a, to catch a 10 foot swell That Bitch

      Spinning away, so far away Hammered beyond belief shattered pieces of my memory Spinning away, so far away  It began with a bottle of beer walking around with an irresistible veneer I picked up a girl, maybe two they said "we could do so much with you" At this i took 3 shots at the bar spotting my buddies at the door that was far They motioned to me and glanced at my female companions and took them to dance  Spinning away, so far away Hammered beyond belief shattered pieces of my memory Spinning away, so far away  My head aches from the alcohol and probably cause of the v's I took and demorol I just took a girl by the hand took her to a room and she assumed position Before I moved in she passed out Damn i thought my luck would never run out I got out and met with Horry and we had a session with Sancho and Cherry  Spinning away, so far away Hammered beyond belief shattered pieces of my memory Spinning away, so far away  I woke up no clothes lying in bed all these memories clouded just flooding in my head Grab myself the pack of cigs on the floor just then i heard a familiar voice say "baby gimme some more" What? Huh? How? And when? I don't remember letting any girls in Cherry there lying in bed talking asleep my god i don't remember anything i was hammered beyond belief  Spinning away, so far away Hammered beyond belief shattered pieces of my memory Spinning away, so far away

      Sige na nga diyan, magtatagalog na ako... Pangtrip lang to kaya huwag kayong mag-abuso...  Isang simpleng tao naman ako Pero marami na akong pinagdaanan Ngunit hanggang ngayon wala akong naiintindihan  Ano ba ang aking kasalanan Parang ako lamang ang palaging hinahamon Sa lahat ng labanan kahit hindi aking panahon Ang aking isang bilin sa diyos namataas Sanay hindi ako mawatas-watas Dahil marami akong minamahal sa mundong ito Kahit na wala silang pake alam sa buhay ko Sa ngayung araw at hanggang kamatayan Ang buhay ko ay hindi ko nang pagsisisihan   I can't really speak tagalog well but i tried Uh hopefully ur comments would dent my evergrowing pride

      To what did i do to recieve this acclamation? When all i have really done was plain procrastination... Am i really simple in a complex way, you nod in agreement When have i reached this social status, is it such a statement? Must i bow to this ever evolving way of perception? These subsequent events fill my mind with much confusion

      Enjoy what you are about to see This is my made for tv movie The things i say they might be true But it depends really upon you  I have walked a mile over land and above sea If you don't believe me take a closer look at my feet I have battled many wars, wars that have no ending My body bruised, mind like ice, and a heart crumbling  Down, down, down i go below Wham, bam thank you man, but really, i got to go My head is aching, i mean i really do not know  I drank and i swam like an overbloated fish I took everything as if it was nothing at all like a sushi dish I've rambled to myself and to you on and on But never again, no never again shall I turn myself on  You, you, you i go below taking and making and raping all of you know Overintoxicated i mean i really do not know  I took to the streets, to the streets and i wandered off I can't, no i won't ever leave again and go just take off Can't i see what this life is to me unimportant really But i guess that i have to because this aint no ordinary fantasy

      She looked me in the eye What have I done wrong Visions of the sky They didn't last long These worlds that she has seen "you will never find me" Locked above the rise Can I hear us? Can I hear us?  Falling back to the ground Never even made a sound Won't you ever leave this town?  4 weeks have gone by Wanted to scream, but he did not try Killing his fears, he challenged he and said  You have no idea what it's like What it's like to be me...  Unhinging all these screws She says she wants something different No options left to choose He says he wants something different Paying all these dues I wish that something was different Yeah something was different No matter what happens to you today

      I'm sure I have done this...  Keeping all the good times forgetting the bad times Choosing a part of my life to tell  And leave the rest in the closet, locked away... But the question here is...  Why I do it? I ask and ask... Why do I do this, when i will be reminded of it Somehow, someway, hell...  Someday it will come out,  And in that time it'll be too late... Editing my life... I probably do this to compensate for yours Or maybe, i don't even have a life, So I add things that were never even there To keep you near me... just maybe... The thing here is sometimes I'm not even concious about it... Unconsciously, i'm already fucking around with you And what's weird is, i already am before i even meet you... And at the same time I'm also getting fucked By Me... Editing my life...

      An act of pure desire Doing it, I've never been better Pull me in thru your metaphorical State of being, purely subliminal  The parallel universe Adjacent to ours it's course Must be some way to cut away From this over-empowering being of state  Cast me in the pit Of your hollow heart remains unlit Just a continous cycle Running around these perfect circles  To be pacified locked within your stare Your beautiful face covered by your hair Run, till you have nothing to fear Purely based on desire, I've never been better

      Wake up in the morning, Clock says half past one  I have no sunglasses As I step into the sun  There’s no recollection Of the evil things I’ve done  My head feels like I musta’ had some fun   What happened?   Last thing I remember I was chillin at a party  Pinching girly’s asses I was drinking recklessly  I know I did something Lord what could it be?  Woke up in the morning And all my friends say me   What happened?   What am I doing here? Who is this girl in my bed?  What is this shit on my face? My god, what is that awful smell?   She may be an angel She may be a queen  She might be black, white, american, indian or japanese   Thru a bottle at a bouncer Didn’t think that he was cool  Pissed in someone's drink And thru a bike into a pool  Driving down the side walk Like a drunken possessed fool  I broke every single traffic rule.   What happened? What happened?   Let’s go

      Let the day fade, pass time, drink up Lie in bed, looking up, take a sip from the cup The music echoes... echoes in my head Let's waste the day together... You and me forever... Serenity and I, in bed, the others are downstairs Echo... in my head again I've never been so alone And I've never been so alive! the sun rises, it's light seep through the blinds brush it does on mine and Serenity's... It echoes once more... It's so distant, can't hear it... But it still does...

      Looking and looking, still can't see, still can't find What makes my mind heart and soul tick... The medicated state of mind Things i try to get everything i know of you out of my mind Searching, keep searching till ur completely blind All of my time spent on things such as you, it's ardous Bottled up inside this feeling of angst, must read Dr. Seuss To clear my head and spark a fire, what do i have to lose? Completely oblivious to my surroundings, my options to choose Dangling on a fine piece or thread, my head it rests Wondering about the day after come, should i take these tests You cut me up, I'm wide awake lying on a pile of pests That gnaw at my skin, the medicated state of mind, am i so blessed?

      Beginnings and there Endings  By: Chris Sarmiento  Intro  It all began on Sept. 19, 03… cool late summer breeze blowing as the clock reached 5:00 pm. I was outside the bus terminal waiting for a friend of mine. I remember it so vividly… I was there with my pen and notebook as usual sketching down whatever visions I’ve been receiving in this deluded head of mine. It’s been only four minutes but it felt as though the whole day went by and still, I hadn’t put down anything on this old Maui and Sons hardbound notebook. I decided to take awhile off so I split, sent Horry a message through my phone telling him we’ll meet up tomorrow instead. Walking these dirty streets, my head still throbbing from a hangover, I noticed the sun set early I didn’t see the orange filled sky it was just plain… dark… “Damn, Christmas is drawing near…” I thought to myself. After realizing, I stopped to check my wallet, see if I had enough money to buy gifts for my friends or family… Fucking broke. I only had enough cash to get me home… Then for a moment I thought to myself “what am I worrying about Christmas isn’t here till three more months” I put my wallet back in my back pocket. Walking steadily, trying not to fall asleep. My phone started ringing.  I answered the phone. “ Hey! Bro, look I can’t go out man, my car got wrecked last night on the way home…” It was Horry… “ I ‘m really sorry man but there ain’t nothing I can do right now I’m broke and please bro I just can’t go…” I could tell he was lying, cause I heard the laughter of one or two girls in the background… “ Look, Horry, bro, I told you to meet me there cause I’m fucked up right now, didn’t I tell you! Plus you could’ve just told me you were fucking some hoes you didn’t have to lie to me…” Horry apologized and I told him I’m going home alone. I’m one patient guy but if I’m not feeling well my patience is just a piece of thread that an insect can easily tear. My mind went a blur after that short and meaningless talk over the phone. I started once again on the long way home… then I decided to turn, stop once again and call a friend of mine. As I dialed the numbers on my phone I had a short flashback of what had happened last night.  I was at Cherry’s place at around 6:00 p.m. setting everything up, laser lights, the foam machine, everything… I walked around in her patio telling my underlings where to put where… it was the first time I was asked to host a party, and usually I never hosted parties, but I threw great ones… it was all going as planned, we installed a couple of Bose speakers to the living room, set the den as the chillout room, every room was a make out room, and the fucking patio was a great site. It was around 9:00 p.m. I had my first shot of Jose Cuervo, just sitting alone till Cherry sat next to me by the bar. I asked about her expectations for this party. Cherry replied with a smile and a flirtish glare that made me weak in the knees.“ So tell me, do you think I’m missing anything?” I asked Cherry while I took another shot of tequila. “ I don’t think so, actually I’d like to say thanks for doing this for me, I couldn’t find anyone else to set the place and host it…” she leaned over and gave me a soft kiss on the lips, I took another shot and strolled off to the gate leaving Cherry by the bar. I didn’t expect her to follow me; I just wanted to enjoy company alone. I’ve no intentions in fucking a good friend of mine… That night Cherry wore a dark red, spaghetti strapped blouse exposing a bust of 38 c’s that would make any man’s jaw drop, she just passed by me trying to put fantasies in my head, well some did pop in there. It was around 10:15 the place was swarming with familiar faces and new ones… all to which I was surprised of, for they praised me for the set up and the sounds…  10:15 p.m. all these people just started pouring in I thought fuck I’m going to get a lot out of this party. I started mingling around, when I saw one of my old girlfriends, Melanie, I remember this girl just loved it up the ass, too bad she turned lesbian after we split up… I couldn’t resist so I came up to her, over the loud music I shouted “ Hey Melie! Long time no see… how’ve you been?” I waited and tried to get her attention once more. After a few more tries I started thinking, fuck she isn’t going to talk to me so I started to walk away… I took only a couple of steps when I felt someone grab my arm. It was Melanie she just smiled and spoke some words that I could barely hear, so I pointed to the glass door leading to the garden. She smiled and nodded, and told her friend to wait inside. As we pushed our way through the crowd to get to the door, I bumped into Horry, he glanced at me and saw Melie… then he drew me close to hear him, “ Bro, don’t tell me you’re going to start fucking Melie again?” he gave me a slap on the shoulder, as I walked away. I could here him shouting over the music saying “ at least introduce me to her lezzi Friends Bro!!” I just laughed… damn Horry is just one fuckin’ horny bro.  We reached the garden, I took my shoes and socks off cause I thought it would be a trip to feel the grass with bare feet. I was surprised that Melie also did the same thing; we walked around till we reached the gazebo. I started the conversation asking her how she has been since three years ago. She just laughed and glared at me for a second “ Oh, me I’ve been doing well lately, I’ve finally finished my course on Architecture and I’m planning on moving to Australia soon…” as she continued I couldn’t help but just stare at her. I kind of missed the days I was with her, my hand caressing her soft creamy skin, her long blonde hair and those soft lips that touched mine everyday. Hey she was great company and a great fuck. “… And then I guess that’s all I got planned for me, What about you How’ve you been?” she finally stopped. I simply just said. “ Me, I’m doing great, I got my life back somehow. I just can’t help thinking of one thing….” “What is that one thing?” Melie asked me with curiosity “…what if we were still together, do you think you’d ever become a lesbian?” she just laughed at me, I know I just asked a stupid question, and that gave me away… “Well…” she replied, “ to tell you the truth I was always a lesbian I just wanted to try dick for a change, especially up my ass… he he...” from then on we told what’s been going on and I was still trying somehow to get in her pants once more, with more bedside humor. Well as the conversation dragged on I noticed that the air had been much cooler and the music started to fade, it was the time that I had to officially start the party.  I told Melanie it was time for me to get the party officially started so we left the gazebo and went separate ways when we reached the glass door leading to the dining hall packed with people. Before I headed to the DJ’s booth I stopped by the bar and downed four shots of tequila to drop the fear of talking in front of crowds and I also brought a bottle of beer along with me. The bartender Edong glanced at me telling me to take it easy on the drinks, cause the party barely started and I’m drinking like a fish. I disregarded the advice and took another bottle. I stood up from the bar ready to make my party opening speech to the people, as I reached the booth I could see Cherry walking through the crowd to the DJ’s booth. It was a beautiful sight, well for a drunk like me, imagine a beautiful girl that could easily split these mass of people without pushing them or speaking to them, she was like a walking crowd repellent, or maybe my thoughts were already messed up… as she got up there with me I could barely take my eyes off her, I was once again thinking fantasies in my head, but I easily snapped out of it telling myself that it’s the alcohol that’s making me feel this way… it was already 11:24 I motioned the DJ to kill the music for a second… as he did, I stepped up to the microphone… fuck I was once again surprised as to hear some of the people in the crowd just call my name, when I didn’t even do, or say anything yet… I took a sip of my beer and began… “ Aiyyo I don’t know how the fuck you guys know me, and why you guys like me, but that’s cool…” Cherry stepped back a few steps and laughed. “ Anyways we all know why we are all here aren’t we?” I drank some more from my bottle; I could already feel my face getting red. “ We are here to party, to smoke dope, to fuck the police and their motherfucking laws, to get laid… but most importantly we are all here for Cherry’s added year in her life let’s give her a holler people!!! And let’s get the fucking party started!!!!” these guys just went crazy after that frickin speech… Cherry went up to me and gave me a kiss and threw me down the booth along with her. All right that shit was fucked…  Lying on the floor with her on top of me, with bits of pieces of glass and food piercing my back, I just noticed how much this girl liked me… she stood up and motioned me to walk with her outside. I stood up brushing of the mess from my back; she took my hand and snatched a bottle of Cuervo in the other. I once again found myself walking through this mass of people but now with much ease and with Cherry leading the way, It felt like a dream sequence, from one of my acid trips… as we reached the glass door hand in hand, she moved her lips and started pointing to the wooden bench, assumingly she wanted me to sit with her, and so I nodded. I could tell she was planning to do some crazy shit to me, or was it the alcohol doing the thinking for me again? I slid the glass door with a force I forgot to check, it hit the edges hard almost causing it to shatter; I faced Cherry and flashed a smile of embarrassment. She just flashed me a flirtish smile and didn’t even mind if I almost broke the door. At this point I could already feel the heavy buzz of tequila and beer; and the music was already getting to me. You know I almost lost my mind… it was The Chemical Brothers playing, the track was The Test; my head was throbbing harder now pounding each time I heard the bass… but now I’m home and I’m free… if Cherry wasn’t there I’d already lost my composure and start fucking up the place. We walked till we reached the bench; she smiled again. I noticed that this girl just loves to smile; her lips always curl up forming a perfect smile. And her eyes always gave off an honest yet deceiving look; that would make a guy wonder what’s going on in this girl’s head…  I slid down the bench beside her, twirling the bottle of beer in my right hand. I could feel her eyes watching me, it felt as though the sun was focusing its rays on me keeping me warm, or trying to burn me up. So I glanced back at her. Her long black hair just hypnotized me, the way it fell on her face, making her eyes much more seductive. Trying to battle these thoughts, I started a conversation… “ So… what’d you think about my opening speech?” she swayed to the left laying her right elbow on the edge of the bench, twirling her hair and was thinking of a response. “ Well… you forgot to use what you had written on paper, but that was cool you still kicked it off pretty well.” That was right… I did write what I was to say to kick off the party, I must’ve forgot. I drank what was left in the bottle, and motioned Cherry to pass the bottle of Cuervo. “ I thought. Hey it’s best to say what I felt about the party, and it would’ve been awkward if I whipped out a piece of paper reading it in front of the peeps.” I told her as I reached for the bottle. I was trying to cover up my little mistake. She looked at me and giggled “ you are still trying to be cool eh Mr. I’m The Bomb” after I took my shot from the bottle I passed it back to her, and laughed as well… she took a shot and glared at me once again, smiled, and leaned down and gave me another kiss. I once again had thoughts about what was going on, receiving images of her and me in the bedroom stripping off that blouse and caressing those size 38 c cups… how I wish that shit would come true… I stood up abruptly; my phone was ringing, the vibration in my back pocket startled me. I asked Cherry to excuse me while I answer the call…  I stepped over by the pool where the least noise was. It was Rachel; she has been looking for me… “ Chris, Where are you?” she sounded worried and pissed at the same time… “ Rachel, I’m hosting a party for a friend of mine, remember Cherry? …” she raised her voice a tad bit, and I could hear the blender start in the background… “ Cherry? Yeah, I remember her… why didn’t you tell me?” She said, “ I did… didn’t I?” I replied trying to get my head straightened out. “ Look baby, I’m sorry it must’ve slipped my mi-“ she cut me off retorting “ look Chris if I’d known I wouldn’t have been looking for you and calling you… just be sure you get back home tomorrow, or it’s over!” she put the phone down on me. Rachel and I have been together for only a few months, but she feels as though we were already married, I don’t understand why some girls are like that, jealous and always breathing down my neck, always wanting to know what I’m doing, and easily get pissed off when I mention I’m with another girl; maybe they know what I’m up to… I shrugged it off, and went back to the bench to look for Cherry. I wanted to forget about the call; it would just ruin my night… I passed the numerous bodies that were lying by the poolside, it reminded me of a scene in one of those teen movies I forgot which one but it was exactly the same; the bodies on the ground drinks everywhere and people making out in the dark corners, loud trance music coming from all sides… I reached the bench but I didn’t see Cherry there instead I saw a couple sipping drinks and having a light conversation. “ Fuck it, I’m going to the bar get myself another drink” I thought to myself. I once again stepped into the dining room it was less crowded, the time was at around 11:45… it was easier for me to get to the bar, without all the peeps pushing around no more.   I saw Horry trying to make some moves on some Chinese looking girls, I could see he was doing a good job, the girls were smiling that’s a good sign, another was they were exchanging words… I sat away from where Horry was, and asked Edong for a glass of whisky… Edong passed me the bottle and told me to take the whole thing instead, I thanked him and made my way to the living room where I set the beanbags, I thought I could just enjoy my bottle of whisky there… at this time Chicane was being played, Daylight, damn this DJ knows what I listen to…. my head throbbed harder as I lounged around, I slouched down in one of the bean bags, bottle in hand enjoying the sounds and the buzz I was having… when a familiar face stepped into the living room. It was Sancho in his usual blue Pornstar shirt and khakis, always carrying his pouch, which is most of the time; filled with drugs… he passed by and motioned me to follow him. I was back at the bar, Horry already went upstairs with one of the chinay girls, and I ordered a glass of vodka for Sanch. Edong took one look at Sancho and gave him the bottle of vodka, not the glass… he did the same thing he did to me to Sancho. “ Yo Edong! Why are you giving us the bottles bro when all we want is the glass?” I asked Edong in curiosity. “ You guys are heavy drinkers, I can tell and don’t worry it’s all paid for, don’t you remember?” Edong told me in reply. “Oh, yeah right.” With that being said, Sanch and me made our way to the poolside.  I grabbed a magazine from the coffee table in the living room, and stepped out to the poolside with Sanch. We whipped out the bag of Chronic from his pouch. Beautiful stems and tiny green leaves that gave off a musky smell. We then peeled and shredded the leaves on the magazine as not to waste any, Sancho ate some seeds in the process, he said it would fuck him up earlier, this guy. After we got the leaves set, I whipped out the Rizla from my pocket and rolled and packed it tight with my make-believe rolling machine, which was a hundred peso bill. The ritual was almost complete, we were just waiting for one more element… The Bitches.  Sancho and I had the joint set up we just waited for one more thing and that was Andrew our best friend pimp to hook us up… we were conversing about how the world would’ve been a better place to live in if people in the government didn’t judge addicts cause of their lifestyles, we are people as well that have a different way of looking at life but still try and maintain the way ordinary people live… we waited for about 10- 15 min and Andrew arrived, he was sweating as hell, and his right hand shook more than usual… “Hey guys, sorry I ran a little late I got confused with the place.” He took a seat across me and took the bottle of Vodka from Sancho’s hand. “Go ahead why don’t you? Just grab my bottle and drink away…” Sancho said sarcastically, as he rose from his seat slowly… “ I’m sorry bro, I just needed a drink…” he took a shot and gave back the bottle to Sanch. “I had a run in with some friends of mine and I couldn’t pay them back so I had to give them what I promised you guys, then I got lost; these streets all look the same dude…” Andrew said shaking his head, and started reaching for my bottle, I took it away from his reach, saying no through my eyes… “ Look at this” I said showing the joint I rolled… “It’s cool Andrew, I know we’re missing the free fucks you were supposed to bring, but as long as we are here we might as well enjoy the party; do you know that the percentage of hot horny girls in this party is 78%, just look at the crowd… for sure we’ll catch some, I know I will” I said as I passed the joint to Sancho… “Let’s just smoke this joint and mingle around…” Sancho told Andrew. Andrew looked relieved and tried to reach for my bottle once again. “Fuck dude! Here! The bottles yours, lazy ass fuck” I told Andrew and figured I’d get myself another bottle and bring someone along for the session. I rose from my seat and told the guys to wait for me…  I dropped by the bar once more, Cherry was there entertaining some of her guests and Horry snuck behind her and gave her a hug. I whistled for them. Cherry glanced at me and spoke in Horry’s ear, Horry looked at my direction, and I motioned for them to come to me… it was 12:30 and my mind wasn’t that straight anymore. They excused themselves from the guests and walked to my direction, each holding a bottle of beer. They took the two seats beside me that were unoccupied. Horry dropped down and sighed… “Bro this night is turning up all right, I got laid again, although I wish it was with you…” she turned in Cherry’s direction. Cherry just gave him the finger and asked me what’s up… “ So what’s up?” I leaned over and whispered in her ear… “Well Sancho and I got the stuff ready by the pool I wanted to know if you want a toke as well, you know since you just grew a year older…” Cherry flashed me her smile again, that meant a yes of course… she told Horry as well, Horry just smiled as if he was already satisfied with his night, and motioned us to go ahead… Cherry just gave Horry a sucker punch and pointed out to the direction of Melanie and her group… Horry got the message and split from the bar. I got another bottle of whisky from Edong and stood up with Cherry  Cherry and I then made our way back to the poolside where we saw Sancho and Andrew wrestling on the grassy side by the pool. “Hey no Fucking Kids allowed in my party!” Cherry called out to Sanch and Andrew… “Well excuse us Miss I just turned 19!” Andrew said… the idiot. I walked over there and gave him a punch on the shoulder. They broke their little melee and both fixed themselves up and sat down joint in hand… we lit that baby up… Sancho as usual got the first hit, then I then Andrew. It was Cherry’s first time to smoke dope so she kept asking us how it was like… “Just go for it already Girl nothing bad will happen to you. It’s just like a cigarette except this cigarette here has an attitude…” Sancho said, “Yeah a Fuckin attitude is right Bro!” Andrew blurted out as he and Sancho gave high fives to each other. “Just suck it hard and hold the smoke in and suck some more!” I told her, as I took a hit and passed the roach to Cherry, “Dude! Chris that didn’t come out right bro…” Sancho told me… I paused; then the guys and me just burst out laughing. While in our laugh trip Cherry took one good long hit… her face just crumpled up as she started coughing it out, she still tried to keep her composure, but couldn’t help it. She put on a face that read: Oh Fuck! I Smoked Too Much! We just laughed and she laughed with us…   It only took us a minute to finish that joint then we just settled by the pool, talking bout things we saw on TV… “ You know dudes it sucks to be a sea turtle” I told them as I opened up a conversation “…cause one night right, I was switching channels and I saw two male turtles on top of a female right…” I took a shot of my whisky “ anyways, #1, the turtle on top of the female, was trying to fuck her right? But then #2 came along and started eloping #1 while #1 was eloping the female…” I said re-enacting the scene with my hands, “and as the program progressed the three were being chased by other sea turtles who wanna get a piece of the action as well, the whole program was just these turtles trying to dislodge #1 to fuck the only female sea turtle in the sea…” I told the story laughing… “Shut the fuck up!” Sancho said as he threw his empty bottle at me… it hurt, but I didn’t mind and continued my story… Cherry stood up and said she’d hang out by the bar, me Sanch and Andrew just chilled and listened to the music… after awhile I dozed off… next thing I knew Andrew had already left the party…  Sancho and Horry met up and conversed about what life could be if drugs were legal. Andrew left no trail, everyone just said he left the party with a bottle of vodka and never came back. I left the party to go and buy cigarettes by the corner store; Cherry followed me to the gate acting paranoid telling me not to leave. I told Cherry to stay put in her room; she was tripping, she was asking me to make her a baby, and in return she would cast a spell on my drawings to make them come to life, she smoked too much, hopefully she’ll snap out of it in an hour or so. On my way to the store I noticed a black van drive by playing music of Fifty Cent. And it skidded after the first street and ran into a post. Neighbors came rushing out. But I didn’t give a shit I just wanted to buy my cigarettes. The time was around 1:00 am and I was lost… I didn’t know where I was going anymore. “Fuck I should’ve brought someone along with me.” I thought to myself. I’ve been lost now for 10 min. I’ve been going round and round and these streets all started to look alike. I decided to go back to the house hoping I could find my way there. Then Sanch called my phone up… “Where you bro?” he said it with a hint of worry blended with sarcasm… “Bro you won’t believe this but I’m lost bro, it’s fucking surreal… bro could you drive around and look for me?” I asked hoping he took it seriously… “That’s what I am doing right now just sit tight I’ll find you alright?” with that he put the phone down on me and I checked my pockets for some stray cigarettes that I might still have and sat by the curb…  So I was there, sitting on the curb next to the Bluebird street sign, waiting for Sancho… I noticed the sky filled with lights, and heard the engines of drag racers from afar; the air was cool and it gently brushed through me once in awhile. I was imagining if I could live life like this, no problems just listening to the world and never getting involved in it’s problems, no one to bug you, no one to tell you what to do, living without conflict, living life just plain, just simple, just peaceful, with a buzz in your head and a joint in your hand… I was out there, just imagining… it took fifteen minutes for Sancho to find me, from afar I could already hear his music drawing closer, Sancho always loved Telepopmusiks’ Breathe, he played it whenever he had a chance to… his blood red gallant stopped in front of me and he opted me to jump in… “Bro kill your sounds and sit with me for awhile…” I asked Sanch in my laidback voice… “I just had a vision, a feeling to share with you…” Sancho lowered the volume, and stepped out. He took a long look at me and gave me a whack on the head… “You Idiot! Don’t be tripping out just yet bro… it’s still early.” He reached out his left hand and gave me a boost up. I groggily walked to the passenger seat telling Sancho I needed a follow up. Sancho laughed and got in, turned the music up and we drove off back to Cherry’s place.  “Bro, don’t crash on me now…” Sancho shook me up… I fell asleep again… I was just waiting to get back to Cherry’s house so that I could get a drink, and hopefully get lucky in having a fine fuck for the evening. I could already see the gate; it was only a couple of meters away… I shook myself up; it was around 1:55 in the morning. We stopped for a minute, to smoke ourselves a roach. We stepped out and walked to the entrance. Damn, the tall majestic mahogany gate looked like the gates of heaven… or hell… I couldn’t decide on what should be what no more. The car park inside was still pretty packed but the sounds have moved from trance to hip-hop, it wouldn’t be the same trip for me from the trip I was having earlier that night. We moved in straight to the bar, Cherry was there, I was glad to see she snapped out of it earlier than what I had expected. She welcomed us back with a smile and pointed to the poolside, where Horry was, half naked and red as hell… Sancho and I just laughed… then Sancho made his way to the poolside, opting me to go with him, I told him I’d rather chill by the bar… Edong wasn’t there anymore instead; a guy at around my age was there, mixing some Bloody Marys and Kamikazes. I ask him to pass me a bottle of whisky, which he did without question. “Hey bartender, what happened to Edong Bro?” I asked him… “Oh Edong, he left awhile ago sir, it’s my shift now… by the way my name’s Rudy” the bartender replied… “Ok, then… Rudy” I could tell this bartender was a fag, the way that faggot spoke, and how that faggot gave me his name with a faggot-like smile… I despise faggots; all kinds…  I sat beside Cherry, hoping she got her head straightened out… “So Chris, I heard you got lost,” she said giggling a bit… “Yeah I did. I was going to the corner store, you know just to buy cigs, but I just found myself lost.” “You stoner! I don’t think there is a corner store around here,” she giggled… “Hey at least I wasn’t trading a fuck for magical drawing spells!” I replied laughing a bit. She stopped for a second and asked… “I did? Did I say such a thing?” She just laughed some more, till her strap broke off… “Shit! My strap broke…” she said trying to hold her blouse together. “Chris could you take me to my room so that I could change?” she looked at me with those eyes again… I thought, “Damn, take her upstairs to change, or to fuck? I can’t think straight anymore”, I snapped out of it and said yes trying to just keep in mind clean thoughts…  I was walking past all the drunken people lying on the floor following Cherry up to her room. Her house was a mess after only a few hours, damn what would you expect to happen in a house party anyways right? I stopped by her bedroom door, and told her I’d rather wait outside for her, “Suit yourself, I’ll just leave the door unlocked is that ok with you?” she said flashing me with a look in her eyes… she then gracefully entered her room; and as promised left it unlocked… “I’m not falling for that shit,” I told myself, knowing that I think I know what she had in mind, or was it my mind? After only a few short seconds I just said fuck it and entered her room locking the door behind me… she was on the bed as I had imagined, waiting for me to enter… “Shit you’ve planned this whole thing haven’t you? Eh Cherry?” I said to her as I paced the room… “So Chris, you’ve known about this and still fell for it…” she smiled at me “Why?” Fuck! What was I going to say? I was already thinking of words, till I just said… “You made me horny the whole time at the party, and I already knew you had a thing for me when we first chatted by the bar…” I said, slowing down my pacing… “And I just followed the path laid before me so I could get the truth.” I said as I walked up to her on the bed… “So do you want to know the truth?” she said to me flashing that smile and that glint in her eye again… I was ready…  We just fucked each other’s brains out; it was all just a blur to me… Cherry was lying beside me, she had passed out… I took my jeans, put them on, gave Cherry a soft kiss on the forehead and went down back to the party, or what was left of it… I didn’t bother checking the time anymore… I staggered down the stairs and passed the bar to get myself a drink… I sat down; only a few people now were to be seen, mostly consisting of Cherry’s good friends and a couple of outsiders trying to hook themselves up for the night… Rudy the faggot bartender popped his faggot head from out of nowhere, and ask me for my drink… I just told the faggot to pass me a bottle of whisky… “Good night sir?” Rudy the faggot bartender asked me, trying to open up a conversation… “Look here just give me my bottle, I’m not in the mood to talk to anyone all right…” I told him sternly. He gave me my bottle and I went around the house to look for Sancho. My first stop in the house was the buffet table at the dining hall; I wanted to chow for a while… there were some wanton noodles, barbecue, and cold beefsteaks, I grabbed myself a plate and took a sample of each. I didn’t mind if the food was cold, I just wanted to fill my stomach up… I sat down in one of the chairs by the dining table and commenced my eating… “Fuck… this night was a good night…” I told myself as I took shots from my bottle. I finished eating and left my plate then and there on the table. Holding my bottle I headed for the first place Sancho would be, the poolside… as I walked to the poolside, I felt my ankle start to ache and my head throb it’s hardest, “FUCK!” I shouted as I threw the bottle of whisky on the ground. I fell down on my knees clutching my head and trying to shake this pain off…  Sancho caught me puking my guts off… it was the first time this had happened to me, and what made me freak out that it wasn’t just stomach juice but blood… “Fuck! Chris!” I heard Sancho as he was running to help me… “Bro, I guess you messed yourself up this night eh…” Sancho said as he gave me a boost up and guided me to the bench… I couldn’t believe what happened, but I asked Sancho to get me another bottle of whisky at the bar, Sancho ran to get me what I ordered… I just laid back and lit myself a cigarette while I waited, my buzz disappeared and I needed a follow up, even if it killed me…  My head was throbbing with pain and my body started numbing up. I could only wait for Sancho to bring me my bottle as I waited at the bench. “Damn I overdid myself this night,” I told myself as I rocked back and forth in the wait… Sancho arrived with my bottle; he brought Horry along with him… “Bro I can’t believe what Sancho told me…” Horry said laughing, I took the bottle from Sancho’s hand and drank… “And I can’t believe my eyes! You still continue after puking blood!” Sancho added as he and Horry stepped back… “Fuck bro, like I told you guys before nothing and I mean nothing can stop my self-destruction…” I told them as I took another shot… “It’s something that you guys will never understand… this disease I have, this fucking Addiction it can never stop… so just leave me be for awhile, I need to stabilize myself ok?” I told them and they went off.   I lumbered off back in the house into the living room. I dropped into one of the beanbags and lit a cigarette… “If I’m to die tonight, at least I died doing what I loved most…” I told myself aloud… my mind was a blur with images of my past and I just enjoyed it… after a few minutes, I had already finished the bottle of whisky… I stood up and headed to the DJ’s booth and told him to split… “Your services are no longer required dude, you can go home, or hang if you want ok?” I told him as I gave him a slap on his shoulder, no one was here anymore to listen or dance anyway, just the few friends of Cherry… “Dude thanks man, I’ll be by the bar, go ahead play whatever you want…” The DJ told me as he left his CD case with me and headed to the bar… I flagged through his case and took out the Sublime Greatest hits CD and played Badfish, my song to end the night… it was already 3:30 in the morning… I roamed around Cherry’s house with Badfish playing. It occurred to me that Bradley Nowell and I had a lot in common, except of course he died years ago from an overdose and I’m still walking… Our lives were pretty much the same, and I thought I would probably end up the same state he’s in if I continued this a couple more years… “Cool” I told myself as I fell to the floor and drifted off to sleep thinking I wouldn’t wake up anymore…  “Wake up Chris!” it was Cherry, she was slapping my face but I couldn’t feel it, in fact I couldn’t hear anything that well… I didn’t even know where the fuck I was already… I just stood up and I could see the sun start to shine over the buildings, there wasn’t any sign of Horry, Sancho, or anybody… it was just Cherry and I, but where? Well she was in front of me, moving her lips I couldn’t make out the words she was trying to say, what am I trying to say, I couldn’t even hear them… my head was jarred with images and flashbacks, my head felt like it was being worked on with a jackhammer… ouch… I could already feel my legs but as soon as I did, I fell hard on the floor… my legs were twitching and my ears started to ring… Cherry helped me up and brought me to the kitchen, she had a hard time cause I kept on tripping over some junk lying on the floor…   We finally got to the kitchen and she guided me to a chair… “Fuck! My head feels like it just wants to explode!” I told Cherry as she walked to the fridge and took a pitcher of water and handed it to me… her lips formed the words ‘drink up’ I still couldn’t hear shit… I took the pitcher and drank. Fuck it wasn’t water… It was Gin! “What are you trying to do girl?” I said in my shocked state of mind fully awake and pumping with adrenaline… “At least you’re awake now…” Cherry said giggling a bit… yeah it was a good trick… “Now hand me a pitcher of water… For real this time…” I said as I tried to stand up… “Sancho and Horry left after you crashed…” Cherry said as she went back to the fridge… “They asked me to tell you to call them up when you woke up…” she came back with a pitcher, with water perhaps, and an empty glass… “Alright… What time is tit?” I said as I groggily reached for the pitcher and glass… “Tit? Did you just ask me ‘what time is tit?” Cherry said laughing… “Well, Chris the time I know is 7:00 am. In tit time I’m not so sure…” she replied laughing a bit more… “Hey! Don’t trip on a guy who just woke up fucked as hell alright?” I said laughing a bit… Cherry just smiled again and excused herself from the kitchen… I finished the pitcher of water and went out to the poolside… I guess Cherry and I weren’t alone after all, Sancho left his pouch of goodies; it was floating on top of the pool. I jumped in to get it…  1 The phone rang for about a minute then finally, Sancho answered. “ Aiyyo! Who this?” I could tell he was fucked up as well but I knew this guys in the condition to drive. “ This Chris, look dude I need you to pick me up bro, Horry the fuck just ditched my ass for some hoes dude.” I could already hear Sancho moving around over the line. “ Alright, where you? I’ll be there in five minutes alright, let me just cleanup this shit…” Sancho started slurring over… “ Hey Bro, you got buds man?” I asked him as I found a spot to sit in… “ Yeah man, shit I’m slurring again. Look just tell me where you are I’ma be there.” I gave him the location and put down the phone… it was already 6:30 p.m. and I was ready to crash. I got my busted ass notebook out and scanned through it, once again I started reminiscing bout what happened.   My train of thought was shattered, as a bus came to a screeching halt right in front of me, the bus was a fuckin rusty big pile of metal with wheels and it just stayed put for about five seconds. Then the doors slid open when a conductor popped his head asking where I was headed… I told the conductor to buzz off, he continued asking the other people that were on the bend as well, waving his wad of stinking bus tickets in his hand. A couple passengers stepped out. One of which I noticed… it was Bart. I called to him but he didn’t pay attention, so I stood up from my place and gave him a slap on his back. He must’ve been wired with speed cause he reacted faster than a fucking rabbit could and whipped out a knife… “ Whoa! You Fucker it’s just me bro!” I replied with a bit of strain in my voice. He took a look at me and said. “ Bro Fuck sorry man, I thought you were a cop or a snatcher or someone…” he replied as he put aside his knife in his jacket pocket. “ …By the way what are you doing here?” I explained to him the situation. In turn I asked him “ So what are you doin’ here as well?” he shifted the placing of his feet a couple of times and said “ HUH?” fuck he’s messed up, but I asked the same question again. “ Oh me I’m here cause my place is just down this road, want to chill there and wait for Sancho there?” I shook my head declining his invitation, reminding him what happened the last time I was in his place. “ Dude, remember three weeks ago? We chilled in your place, me, Sanch, Horry and Andrew, and then while we were stoned we got raided and you split like a frickin jackrabbit, we spent how many nights in jail till Sancho’s brads pulled some strings…” He just shook his head and snickered apologizing for what happened. “ Bart, you wired man?” he shook his head shuddered his shoulders and just continued snickering… at that point I was getting annoyed till he asked me bout my party last night.    Sancho finally arrived there in his blood red Toyota gallant, sounds booming from his speakers. As he stepped out, smoke billowed out. Damn the moving hot box is in action once again. “ Aiyyo! Chris, what’s Barty boy doin here with you?” Sancho asked in a disgruntled way. “ He got off the bus I forgot he just lived down the street, I could’ve told you to meet me there, but you remember last time…” I told Sanch, laughing a bit. “You are right man, next time, Bart Yo! Don’t split like a frickin tadpole when the cops come man.” Sancho said laughing his stoned ass off. I walked over to the passenger door bid farewell to Bart and took my notebook and jotted down a short and meaningless poem, Sanch followed a few seconds later closed the door and put the volume down. “ Bro put some ganja music in, and tell me where you want to go.” I reached for the CD case in the back seat; I always left my music in Sancho’s car for some strange reason… I took out my reggae CD that contained Bob Marley And Yellowman stuck it in and turned up the volume. “ Sanch, bro, I can’t go home in this condition, Rachel’s gonna give me another sermon again…” I said shaking my head. “ Let’s just chill around in your place… let’s just pass by 7-eleven and buy some beers.” We drove off and Sancho loaded the pipe… I took a toke and passed it back to Sanch. Sancho always had the good shit from Amsterdam. I had a good buzz and asked Sancho to wake me up once we reached 7-eleven. I drifted off to sleep…  Chapter 2: The stop at 7-eleven  We were almost at 7-eleven when Sancho woke me up… “Hey Bro… Bro! Wake the fuck up we’re near 7-eleven already…” he shook me up I was nudging him off till finally his continuous shaking woke me up. “ FUCKIN A! Bro I was sleepin’ man…” He raised his right hand and gave me a light whack on the head, reminding me that I asked him to wake me up… “ Oh yeah I forgot…” I said laughing still hit from the toke I had. We stepped down the car, after hiding the shit we smoked up in the car… I was reminded that I didn’t have any cash so I asked Sanch if I could bum from him. “ Bro check your CD case… I think you left a couple of bills their…” he takes his car keys and tosses them to me. “Meet me inside alright…” he said as he walked to the store. I walked back to the car and opened the trunk, revealing 10 of my CD cases. “Which CD case did he mean?” as I surfed through one of the CD cases, a picture fell; it showed me and Sancho back when we were still in grade 1. Bunch of innocent looking kids, it’s hard to imagine that we’d end up where we are right now… I slipped the picture back and found my money on the fifth case. I locked the car and went to the store. Sancho was by the fridge checking out the beers I tossed him back his car keys, and scavenged around for the munchies. I passed through the fields of plastic wrapped preservative filled dried grain products, and settled on 5 packs of Doritos, and I then walked to the counter and paid for the chips and bought two packs of Marlboros. Sancho followed with a twelve pack of san mig lights. We stepped outside with our supplies and headed for the car… we sat down and drove off. I rolled down my window feeling the air blow through my face, I reached for the pack of cigarettes and lit myself one. I then took my share of the beer and had a huge gulp…  Minutes after we left 7-eleven the radio announced that the 7-eleven we were in just got robbed and the clerk was shot 5 times and many were wounded, me and Sancho just sighed and thanked god for our lucky stars… half way through my first can we had already reached Sancho’s village in White Plains… we caught up with Andrew by the gate… he was staggering with a deep gash on his left cheek. We asked him to hop in. Andrew, the fuck, always got himself fucked in situations, we told him to chill at Sanch’s place so we could take care of the wound… apparently he had a run in with some major underground group last night… that made things clearer for me.  Chapter 3: Andrew’s Issue  Andrew was lying on the couch feeling the gash on his cheek; Sancho was in the bathroom lighting up a joint… he was also trying to contact Horry. In situations like these Horry was good help… I was pacing around the room thinking whether I should go home or stay with the guys; I was still wearing the same clothes from last night and I didn’t have a bite to eat; and I meant real food. The time was already 9:00. We cleaned Andrews wound up, we dropped some hydrogen peroxide on his face and Sancho sewn his face up and patched it with a square band-aid… Apparently after Andrew left the party he had a run in with some major fraternity he had a beef with two months ago…   “I was drunk as a mother fucker last night I was walking towards my car and next thing I knew a couple of big tough punks from APO pulled a 45’ on me telling me to hop in the van…” Andrew walked towards Sancho’s fridge and got himself a can of beer and helped himself to a bag of Doritos… “Fuck bro if I only knew I was gonna bump into them I could’ve brought my shot gun along…” he finished his beer in 4 huge gulps and grabbed another one… “The funny thing about it was after a few minutes I was in the van, getting my ass whooped and threatened, the driver crashed into a post trying to avoid an idiot standing in the middle of the road.” I stood from the bed and grabbed myself a beer as well… “Well I guess you should thank me bro…” I said laughing a bit… Andrew replied asking why… “I was there. I thought some kids were just drunk when they crashed their ride they were driving hella fast, so I didn’t pay attention cause I was pretty stoned…” Andrew just stared at me and laughed… “I guess I should thank you for the state I’m in as well eh bro?” I just chuckled; Andrew was trying to be serious… “Look, bro the driver died instantly in the crash, the others were knocked out and I busted my knee and got fuckin cut in the face…” “Hey it’s better than lying face down on a pool of blood or your body riddled with bullets; oh wait the meant the same thing didn’t it?” I told Andrew chuckling on the last bit of my sentence… Andrew explained to me that he owed these guys some cash and that he has up to next week to pay them twenty grand… at this point Horry arrived.  Upon entering the room Horry once again apologized for ditching me at the bus station, he looked tired as mofo. I accepted his apology and told him about Andrew’s situation… he looked at Andrew as he lit a cigarette… “So tell me, what did you do to owe these guys so much?” Horry asked Andrew in a serious tone of voice… “Well I… Well I rammed my V-tec in one of the OG’s Expedition, I promised I was to pay them back, but that was two months ago… and… I was ashamed to ask cash from you guys…” Andrew said shifting his position on the chair. “So you let it escalate to the point that they had to kidnap you… just because you didn’t pay for the car’s bill of repair? That’s bullshit! You’re hiding something from us… aren’t you?” Sancho stepped in from the bathroom; apparently he heard everything from inside… “ Cause hey, I wouldn’t go to such an extent to kidnap a guy and threaten him just to pay for a repair bill that was… 2 months ago you say?” Sancho paced to his fridge got a bottle of vodka and took a shot… “Sure I’d remind the guy a couple of times to pay me back, but what kind of guy would do this shit to you if you didn’t do anything else to him? Tell me bro… tell us what else you did.” Sancho said passing the bottle to Andrew… I just sat there reached for Sancho’s pouch, rolled myself a joint and hit the bathroom; I wasn’t in the mood to hear anymore problems…  I got out after I finished the joint; Andrew had his hands on his face shaking left and right, spilling tears on his bright red shirt. Sanch and Horry got the truth from him; I didn’t bother asking anymore what happened I was just ready to do what I can do… “Chris, grab the 12 gauge under the sink in the kitchen, you know what to do…” Sancho told me… “Andrew you stay here…” Andrew just nodded, then Sancho gave Horry and me a look only we knew… we hit the road in Sancho’s muscle car, a modified Land Cruiser, he had it repainted black and had the windows bulletproofed, as usual had his speaker set up, and believe it or not, he added a NOS system that was under the passenger seat. We reached the gate of White Plains, our windows rolled down, a cig in each hand… “Chris, bro I know we’ve done this before, but as usual I need to remind you, cause you’re stoned… Again…” Horry told me… “We’ll just talk to the guy alright, scare the guy as usual maybe ask a favor from him, you know give Andrew some time. You stay outside and if things go wrong, pop some shells got it?” I nodded, trying to focus myself. We were already driving on Edsa by Crossings; I was enjoying my cig and the lights of buildings and cars passing by. By the time we reached Ayala I was still hit hard, I thought I could get a drink once we reach WhereElse! I sat lower in my seat just thinking to myself…  “Fuck I’m doing this shit again…”  We looked for the best parking spot in the parking lot in front of the club; we found the perfect spot after a minute. I had a great view of the entrance, no obstructions I could get a clear hit if anyone who came rushing out the door. Sancho, Horry and I wished each other the best of luck, so that I wouldn’t have to pull the trigger. They stepped out, reminding me again of what I was to do, and walked into the club. The clock on Sancho’s dashboard flashed 11:00, they’d be out in 10 minutes or less if everything went well. I went down and had a cigarette…   Chapter 4: Waiting for Ten Minutes  I finished my cigarette. My head was buzzing with images of what was going inside the club… Sancho would introduce himself and Horry, then Sanch would say his usual statement to startle whomever the guy was, he would start the conversation firmly, then Horry would mediate the situation if things ever got out of hand. He then would rephrase Sancho’s words in a more understandable, but meaningful statement. Probably at this point, the guy would have two things in mind, he would either give consideration, or fuck these two guys and do whatever the fuck he wanted to do. If ever the second thought came into mind, I would step in do my part… hopefully he would give Andrew the chance, I didn’t have the time to get my shit ruined again, and after all I’ve gone through… I remember the first few times we did this, give a talk to a trouble maker, we were all young back then and our conversations usually ended with the other guy’s head blown off; of course I did all the dirty work… I was never really good with words, I’m more of the action type of guy… although lately our meetings all went smoothly, I didn’t have to blow anymore brains, and we also always kept our end of the bargain, so both ends had good deals… hopefully we’ll get lucky again… as I lit another cig, my phone rang. “Chris, Where are you? Again!” it was Rachel, damn this bitch… I never get a single day free of this bitch’s complaints.  “Baby, I know I was supposed to be home this day, but something came up…” I said still trying to keep my emotions intact. “What is with you? You’ve been hanging around Sanch, and Horry all the time; you and those fuckin assholes called friends…” she said, fuck I couldn’t believe that she was dragging my friends into this shit between us… “Look here bitch! My friends have nothing to do with us all right?” I shouted over the phone trying to make a point. “Look don’t be breathing down my neck all the time alright! You wouldn’t, I repeat you wouldn’t understand the shit I’ve been doing even if I wrote it in black or white…” I said… I couldn’t keep myself in check anymore… “ The best thing for you to do is get the fuck out of my apartment and erase my number from your phone.” I lit myself another cigarette, as I waited for her response… “Chris… I’m sorry…” she was sobbing on the other end… my heart sank again and I refreshed my thoughts and feelings… “Look don’t cry alright, I’m sorry I shouted ok, you just caught me in a bad time…” I took a puff from my cig and threw it… “Yeah, I know I haven’t seen you lately but try and understand that I’ve just went through a great ordeal, I needed some time alone, spend some time with the guys… cause shit they’re the only ones who could screw my head back together again alright?” I got in the Land Cruiser and checked the time; five minutes have passed… “Look I promise you, I’ll be home tomorrow ok?” I said reassuringly in a lower tone. “Ok…” she replied her sobbing started to fade, and put the phone down on me… Damn it!  I got back into the car and checked the time another two minutes have passed, that made a total of seven, shit I hope things were going well inside, I rolled down the window and had a smoke… fuck, this day was fucking stressful…   Horry called my phone saying it went well, the OG would give Andrew another two months to pay him back for the bill, all he wanted was Andrew to apologize for drugging the OG’s sisters and screwing his ex-girlfriend a year ago. Fuck I was glad I was smoking up in the bathroom when Andrew told Horry and Sancho this; cause if I’d known I would’ve just beat him up then and there whether or not he was a good friend of mine… they said that the OG wanted to meet me, I told them I was in the parking lot and I didn’t want to move so they told me to wait… “One thing Chris this guy is alone, we’ll be coming out with no one else, once you see him fuck bro try to keep yourself composed alright…” Horry said to me over the line, I promised him and turned my phone off… “Keep myself composed? For what? ” After a minute they were out with the OG, Rico… they walked over to me, I was at the side leaning on the Land Cruiser, then Rico stepped up in front of me laughing, “So this was the guy who was to bust a cap in my ass…” Rico said looking up to me… god I can’t believe a guy like this was an OG of a major frat… this guy was around five foot four inches tall wearing “totoy” hip-hop clothes, I just smiled at the punk tough guy wannabe. “Yup, I’m the guy…” I told him battling my thoughts about this fucking shrimp being an OG… “It’s a good thing you took our terms bro. I’d hate to see another guy fall down cause of what I might do, you know?” I told him I noticed him shiver a bit “Rico, right? Rico’s your name? All right nice meeting you… hope when we see each other again it wasn’t a product of conflict alright?” I motioned Sancho to talk to me. I excused myself from Rico and whispered to Horry to take him back and get me a drink from the club’s bar…   I waited for them to step back in the club… as they disappeared me and Sancho just burst out laughing… “A fucking totoy like that is a fucking OG?” I said as I struggled to open the door of Sancho’s ride… Sancho just laughed and stepped in as well busting out a cigarette. “Fuck the dude looked like he was still wearing diapers man… ‘So this is the guy who was to bust a cap in my ass’ that tough guy wannabe man!” I told Sancho as I lit myself a cigarette… seconds later Horry came out with my beer, hopped in the back seat and we left WhereElse! Horry just started laughing at the situation… “I can’t believe we were going to shoot down a fucking Kid, I swear to god this kid looked like grade 6” Horry said… I drank from my beer… Sancho just told Horry to forget about what happened with the totoy and think about what to do with Andrew… I drank and just laid back…  Chapter 5: The Idiot  Me, Sancho and Horry were driving off, back to White Plains, where we had hoped, Andrew was waiting. Passing Edsa once again, only a few cars were on the road accompanied by a bunch of semis… “Bro what should we do about Andrew man?” I asked Sancho and Horry… “I mean, why the fuck did he have to do those things to a fucking shrimp dude… I mean sure the OG was a fucking shrimp, I could tell he was on the verge on crapping his pants when he came up to me… Rico… what a fucking stupid ass name… And Andrew is an idiot for picking on one…” I said venting out some humor and anger at the same time… Sancho and Horry just laughed, “Hey guys, wanna pass by 7-eleven grab a couple of drinks before we see Andrew again?” Horry suggested… “Sure, why not?” Sancho said as he stepped on the gas and made a turn… we knew every 7-eleven in this fucking city, every road to take, every nook and cranny just to get to a 7-eleven… we finally reached one along Shaw Boulevard… They both stepped out. I was starting to doze off…   “Chris, get your ass up!” Horry said as he opened my door… “Alright, alright… I’m up and walking…” I said as I got down from the car and walked around to prove myself… “Satisfied?” Sancho just shook his head and we walked into the store… as usual, Sancho was by the fridge again and I handled the smokes and chow… Horry was by the magazine rack reading a PSM magazine that featured Metal Gear Solid 3 on the front… “Hideo finally came to his senses guys…” Horry said as he browsed through the magazine “I can’t believe it’ll be out soon…” Horry dribbled on as we were doing our usual stuff. Horry was the eldest and the youngest in our group. He’ll be serious in fights and business, but when he turns his back he kind of becomes a 12-year-old kid… we finished our routine and headed for White Plains… Sancho whipped his phone out from his pocket and called his house up hoping Andrew would pick it up… No one was answering… we figured Andrew crashed after we left… Sancho stepped on the gas anyway just to be sure…  We arrived at Sancho’s place, it was around 3:30 AM… we lit ourselves a roach in Sancho’s garage and preceded upstairs with our supplies… on the way upstairs we had noticed bottles of beer and vodka on the floor, Andrew must have drank to forget his worries for awhile… as we got to Sancho’s room we found Andrew on the floor face forward, we had dropped everything we had in our hands and rushed to check Andrew’s condition… “Bro!” we shouted in Andrew’s ear hoping he was just asleep, Sancho took Andrew in his arms and laid him on the sofa… we checked his pulse… nothing. “Fuck!” Horry shouted as we continued to see if there was any chance we could revive Andrew… nothing… we were too late…   The idiot OD’d on Sancho’s stash of Ecstasy and Morphine. Sancho was pissed… We had a dead friend of ours lying on the sofa and he had to take Sancho’s stash along with him, wherever he was off to… he had broken the syringes that contained adrenaline shots to revive him, I guess he wanted to pass away then and there fearing that we would have a talk with him after we settled our business with the shrimp OG… “You Fucking Idiot!” Sancho said at the top of his lungs as he was clutching Andrew’s lifeless body in his arms… We were all just bummed out finding out one of our good friends have passed away… “What are we going to say to the parents guys?” Horry had said his voice was shaking along with his body. “Horry, his parents are dead… remember?” I reminded Horry… come to think of it, after Andrew’s parents have passed away, we were the ones who took care of him; we took care of each other… We were the only family Andrew had, if he ever did consider us as his family…   We just sat there, I didn’t bother what was going in their heads, I was busy with getting my head straightened out, I was feeling stoned and having feelings of grief at the same time for what had happened to Andrew… that is the worst combination for a guy to have going on in his head… “Horry, Chris,” Sancho said shaking his head… “Get a Garbage Bag and stuff him in there…” Sancho said as he started shedding tears… “This is the best we can do for him, pack him up and let’s head to Batangas, he always said he’d love to be buried by the beachside…” “Sancho… yeah he did say that.  Well let me get the bag…” I said as I walked out of the room. I had reached the kitchen and opened up the fridge and grabbed me a carton of milk, it was time I drank something else aside from alcohol…  Chapter 6: Outro  I had grabbed 4 XL sized garbage bags from the kitchen and headed upstairs to where I had left Sancho and Horry with Andrew… I still couldn’t believe one of us had fallen, and of all the people, it was the least we had expected; Andrew, the one whose health was pretty much intact, the dude who partied least, the dude who smoked out the least, the dude who basically stayed home frequently, even though he had the cash and the time to go out, he was a clean pimp… all the guys thought I would be the first to go; at the rate I was going I thought so as well… Then it would be Sancho and Horry, last would’ve been Andrew. It’s funny come to think of it, what if we had the order wrong?   “Fuck it Chris” Sancho had told me, as I stepped into the room “Let’s just drive off there now; bring some shovels along… And we’ll pack him then and there instead…” Sancho had said, “I got dibs on the front seat…” Horry blurted out trying to humor the situation… it didn’t work… we just sat there a few more minutes and Sancho checked the time… “It’s 4:15 guys… Let’s move…” Sancho spoke as we all had risen from our seats to carry Andrew downstairs… we laid Andrew on the backseat of Sancho’s gallant, then I went off to grab the shovels, located underneath the sink in the garage… “I can’t believe we are doing this!” I said to the guys as I popped the shovels in the trunk… “I just can’t believe this shit…” I dribbled on, continuing what I was supposed to say in my head… I walked over to the front seat till Sancho spoke… “Chris, you drive, I’ll spend the trip with Andrew over here…” Sancho tossed his keys to me and slid into the backseat with Andrew. Horry hopped in the front with me…   Sancho and Andrew were the closest to each other in our group; cause Sancho was mostly there to give advice and help him out of situations, he was Andrew’s big brother if you looked at it, so it hurt him the most to see his ‘little brother’ dead in his house, lying dead in the car now cause of his stash of narcotics… Sancho was blaming himself for leaving Andrew there with all the drugs he could take… we did regret leaving him there, we should’ve brought him along with us… well there aint no use grieving what has been done… I started the engine and we drove off…

      Some people say that being asleep is better than being awake… I used to believe in this concept, who would want to wake up in a harsh reality, when it’s better to live in a state where your dreams come true anyway? I’ve spent most of my life awake, and what I got were constant problems… wars, conflict, murder, basically we live in a world where people hurt people constantly… we try to blind ourselves from all these with drugs, friends and activities that keeps us from the ultimate truth, which is death, pain and suffering… we eventually hurt people consciously and unconsciously… but there isn’t anything we can do about it… it has dawned on me that without these conflicts, life would be a dull and empty void… we can’t escape the inevitable, we are going to continue hurting, we are going to continue blinding ourselves, and we are going do die eventually in the coming days… at this I would like to say we can’t sleep, live in our dreams and expect everything to go away when we wake up, these things will always be there when we do, so go ahead and sleep, live inside your head and brush these issues off your shoulders, but when you wake up you can only wait for the day to end, to escape this world, this reality, the truth again… I know I’ve gone through a lot and I still wake up cause I know that when after I’ve gone through these shit I’ll come out strong and soon after I won’t feel anything I’ll be numb from these conflicts and the only thing I’ll feel is pleasure soon after…

      hmmm... what's there to do? i'm just sitting here typing, watching the day go by... play myself a tune on the guitar, thinking how and why i've ended where i am right now... these letters pop up when i press on a letter at the keyboard showing me that this thing still works... some of these keys were jammed last night... the visualization of my winamp keeps me entertained although the images i see are just bright colors intertwined into each other showing different shapes and such... like red smoke mixing with blue to create this purple hazy dragon... but it changes randomly, different ways of blending the colors moving to the beat of the mp3 files being played... why is it that i have to be so cheap and download pirated music? idunno, i'm just letting my mind wander off right now... yeah... why do i do this, idunno, maybe cause i love music, and don't have the time or money to get my own album?... oh well, music is music it was made for everyone, so i guess yeah it shouldn't be sold but it should be open to all those who want it... uh... you may be wondering why i'm typing here and what am i typing... i'm bored and i guess its just for the attention... why? cause i need it... don't you? doesn't everyone need a little attention sometimes? i know i do... hehe, damn, why is it that some people just have this innate desire to do something out of the ordinary just to get noticed? for me it's just plain boredom... when i'm bored i just go crazy... idunno why? what is it that bores me? there are so many fascinating things to be seen and expierienced i'm just too lazy i guess and being lazy leads to my growth of boredom... why must I wander off into my thoughts? It’s necessary fo me I guess to know myself a little better, cause idont know who I really am anymore… igotta come up with something to do… oh well, i'll come up with something probly this... everyday writing The Mind Of The Bored Man yeah first shit oh vell... i gotta split... read this or not i don't care, just bored... guys gonna do anything crazy this summer? let me know ayt PEACE!

       Scooby Doo's Scooby Snacks  Marlboro reds cigarette packs  Listening to rock, air guitar  I'm so close and so very far  Jot down notes on cats and dogs  Cold breeze, soft winds and cool fogs  Set of pictures on the wall  Memories I remember them all  Sketches of women and poetry  Visions I see all coming from me  Lying down, standing up  This cup of coffee keeps me up  Radio on with my Bose stereos  Finished Doritos, iced tea and Oreos  CD walkman turned on, eating chocolate mousse  Down some warm milk, and just start to snooze  Time to sleep put out the torch  Donw with my time, out on the porch

       The river god's daughter Daphne  Pursued by Apollo's undying love, He  Has been struck with an arrow from cupid  So did Daphne, although a god may forbid it  It was because of Apollo's foolish heart and mind  What was in Cupid for Apollo to find?  Now Daphne runs far from love fearing to be wed  And Apollo will chase her till the day gods will have been killed  It's a beauty wasted since she fears love  But to Apollo it's a beautiful sight as Daphne flies like a dove  And as Apollo caught up and Daphne has tired  Daphne calls her father; help is what she asks; for what had transpired  She get's her wish but is unable to move an inch  Her feet get rooted, her skin turns to bark and her hair replaced with leaves  But Apollo still loves her even in her present state  Apollo truly in love has no sign of hate  Apollo gazes at Daphne because she's everything he sees  Respects and still loves her dearly even as a laurel tree   (my poetic rendition of Daphne and Apollo)

       Are you awake? Or are you still roaming around in your dream?  How do I know if this is reality? And what if this is fantasy?  Could I have been you at a different time?  Is there a truth to death? Or at the time of our death  We are instantly born again with a new life and identity?  How can I tell if you are real? What if these "Thoughts" are a message?  A message telling us that everythin's not real?  Or is the message a lie? Beguiling our beliefs?  What if we are awake but in truth asleep?  And what if we are asleep but in reality awake?  Thoughts, thoughts, thoughts, thoughts  Never-ending, eternal, defiling our souls  Never let it stop

Newly formed shimmering from the sky up above    Look at what's growing within us    Wonders and dreams start overflowing    Stacks of unopened boxes waiting to be exposed    Chests unlocked waiting to be shared with the world    Don't throw them away plans and dreams    Pick up what was thought waste and recycle    Spill the pale of overflowing thoughts    Use the knowledge and build your ideas into reality    Our minds are not made to waste others    Create reality from your fantasies

       I was chillin over by the corner store early this afternoon   Alone on the curb with a pack of cigs and a bottle filled with sweet intoxication   I stood up, picked my bag up and headed for the mall   The rain poured harder with each and every single step but still standing tall   Carefully I maneuvered to a nearby coffee shop   Took a seat laid my bag down went to the counter to order myself a cup   Whipped out my journal and thought of something to write   Then had an idea&nbsp; maybe&nbsp;I should start something to fuel this empty mind   And so this man stepped through the shop entrance   Around 5'9 dark hair chinky eyes and built... what's weird was he gave me a glance   In the back of my mind&nbsp;I was thinking he&nbsp;looked familiar   I shrugged it off and finished my cup walked for awhile till&nbsp;I was very far   Then I was forced to stop my walk and forced to listen   Cause&nbsp;I could've sworn I heard some footsteps and heavy breathing   I turned around and there was the guy from the corner store   Cussing at me askin if I remembered him from way before   Before a word of mine was said he was already upfront   And threw me a left hook and kicked me on the nads... what a cunt   I was crawling on the ground and he kicked some more   I struggled to get back on my feet whilst taking the free shots&nbsp;I was giving this fucker   I was pained yes&nbsp;I was pained but&nbsp;I manage to get a hold of his neck   Tighter my right hand squeezed at this punk's trachea   He ceased his kicking and punching his objebtive now was to get free and breathe   I landed only 3 left hooks and let him go   Gasping for air this fucker gave me no show   He did have a fighting spirit so once again he charged at me   Spiking me to the ground... what a pathetic attempt to ground me   Once again&nbsp;I had him locked gasping for air his head trashed around in the mud   He valiantly punched at my ribs hoping I'd dislodge him&nbsp;I thought after this melee&nbsp;I needed a bud   I told him bro I'll let you go and you run off I have no beef with you   He replied with ceasing his uncontrollable trashing and tapping my arm   This melee took merely a min to settle... he went off the other side   I stood up took my bag and just watched him walk away just to make sure&nbsp;I wouldn't get back stabbed   And so he disappeared around the corner street   Nothing more nothing less... I walked home that day bruised and aching   And jotted this short meaningless melee down

      We planned a thing it was no problem at all I didn't have a reason to doubt them all Just take it there and hope that it don't fall When they go, I'll go, cause you'll go &nbsp; Just a little way to get some satisfaction And my homies think we need no calculation I settle things my way and head on home When they go, I'll go, cause you'll go &nbsp; If you don't hear me&nbsp;I say we got to get sold Cause all&nbsp;I got in my mind is making me some dough You know that we need this all cause When they go, I'll go, cause you'll go &nbsp; It's all about what, when and where's your goal I don't wanna get stuck mining fer coal I want to be the guy who's&nbsp;running it all When they go, I'll go, cause you'll go &nbsp; My mind is set on gettin and spendin g's Cause remember money makes the world go round My boys you gotta understand money cause They'll go, and you'll go, cause I'll go

      When my girly comes around I just want to hear one sound  I just want her to stay by my side Cause I grow weak with her camel toe slide Why does she do it&nbsp;I don't know Just thinking about it gets me high when I'm low Where'd you ever get such a thing? The thought of it is just so mind boggling &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

      It was a night to remember And a night to forget Cause we drove away, so far away We were lost and silent Just you and I sitting on the curb I sat and you stared We ran, yes indeed we ran feelin chills from this air These lights all pass us by As I stepped on the gas We laughed and shouted whilst in the car Driving so fast And for an hour we haven't said a word Radio did all the talking Rastafarian music played so loudly Ganja kept on burning  We stopped to rest by countless motels And if we ran out of gas And for days we haven't said a word But you always knew when I wanted ass We drove for weeks then turned to months We fled We drove till we almost reached a year But this car's engine was close to dead

      I don't know what I want But I know how to get it You're sayin there's somethin wrong with me But there isn't that i can see What am I supposed to do But I'll do it when it comes around My heaven's grow ever so ever so This scenery ever never blow My mind is broken down And my body irepairable Funding my state of mentality  Now I know what I want Now I know how to get it Go and say what you want Never will I go forget it And I know what to do So I'll be the one coming around My heaven's now ever so ever so This scenery I know will never grow old My mind has grown and not being beat My body was mearly in a healing state Funding my state of humanity

      Hey there goes that guy  with the guitar down the road Strumming away his pain  and probably yours with his odes I can't wait till he hits the stage  and watch him play His rythm and all his solos and his riffs  make my day No one wants to leave or turn away  cause if they do he's gone He, only stays to play  and to be heard a shame he's done  Hey baby look at the guitar man he plays so good I wish it wouldn't end Hey baby look at the guitar man these six strings get struck, plucked and bend

      I believe that a life;  Long lived and empty, is worthless  Short lived and full, is priceless  I also believe that if you're living a life  just solely to live it, is grand  But to live and be remembered by all, is sublime

I aint gonna kick the bucket soon, Not until I get the rundown from you I'm gonna get ya just to see I'm gonna get ya just to see

      Do you remember the days? spending it outside by the park swinging on the swings that bring us up high And what about the turles fighting crime in the tube how easily amused we were when they said cowabunga And remember the time when you and I fought about who was who back then and who'd get the last slice of pizza Watching cartoons in my room and laughing so loud and tripping on the show Mr. Neighborhood  I miss those days back at my old house in that little street  both of us were so close back then  What about the time when we helped each other during tests and examinations, passing and sharing notes And remember the day when you cried cause you were afraid of the dark so I'd come and bring flashlights along And we'd play pretend like I was a king and you were a princess and all we had done all day was play snes And hope you remember the day when we fought for us to stay in my little house and how we cried when I moved away  I miss those days back at my old house in that little street  both of us were so close back then  And after many many years I came back to know that you have left your own little house in the street by the park Where we used to meet I still remember those good old days Especially the day we both said "don't forget me" I wonder how you are and if ever will we ever meet again or we both are still looking at our favorite star And I hope ur still cool and remember never ever turn a fool to those who's only desire is to be cruel  I miss those days back at my old house in that little street  You and me were so close back then

      I saw you at the bar I was laughing with some friends I saw you turn your head I was checking you instead I asked you if you would like to dance I really wasn’t trying to get into your pants Not to say that you’re not a beautiful young lady But I drive a chevy nova And I thought you liked mercedes Soon enough though We were allured Bumping and grinding out on the dance floor With the system so loud The vibrations so pulsing You whispered in my ear But I couldn’t hear nothing Steered me over in the corner And kissed me on the neck That’s when I decided oh what the heck I put my hands on your hips And I kissed you right back You kissed me like a shark That’s sniffing on a snack And then you said "my boyfriend never kissed me like that" I said "boyfriend? you didn’t say he was around" On this friday friday night When I came and rocked your town  On this friday night When the feeling’s alright Rockin rock steady grooves In the middle of the night Everything is heated up And nobody’s standing still With my arm around my girl And a hundred dollar bill  The song was over So we headed for a drink And whatta you think She gave another guy a wink Who came over for a kiss And asked the girl "who’s this?" She said "that’s G. Love you know G. from special sauce?" Then he said "I’m getting louie kid you better get lost" I asked the girl "who’s louie?"  And she said "that’s my man" Women women I just can’t understand Then I says "I don’t want to hear about girl problems And if you got a problem babydoll I can solve them" But I feel you’re gonna get me in trouble So c’mon let’s leave this bar And go out clubbing on the double Girl’s putting me in a trance All because she wants to dance And get down with the man Who brought the sound On this friday friday night When I came and rocked your town  On this friday night When the feeling’s alright Rockin rock steady grooves In the middle of the night Everything is heated up And nobody’s standing still With my arm around my girl And this hundred dollar bill  I can just tell A girl like you’s a deadend Pressing up against me Talking about "I got a boyfriend" Now here he comes looking for you On the dance floor While you’re pushing on my knee Talkin’ ’bout "I love you more" I’m new in town Bout I’m no stranger to this I’m not trying to exist With a hit and run fix I get my loving on the run And I like having fun But I don’t sneak around And I don’t gotta gun Now give me three steps Like the boy lynyrd skynrd There’s more drama in this town Than a soap so I figured Maybe I’ll get your number And maybe I will call And maybe we’ll slip Into the backroom down the hall Or maybe I’ll get jacked up By your angry boyfriend louie ’cause his eyes are getting redder While his anger’s busy stewing on the fire The little trick in you brought out On this friday friday night When I came and rocked your town  On this friday night Everything is alright Rock steady grooves In the middle of the night Everything is heated up And nobody’s standing still With my arm around my girl And this hundred dollar bill

      Baby we’ve been through a lot And times sure have changed Everybody’s leaving town Looking for better things But I found what I want And I got no problem working I wish to god That my heart would stop hurting Shops closing down Factories outdated People so frustrated My whole life is changing Just trying to find some solid ground A little house with a picket fence How’s that sound  Love is all I need Love is all I need  I’ve seen tears that are Falling like leaves from the trees Houses boarded up and they Threw away the keys But this town is where we’re born And this town is where we’re staying I’ll never ever turn my back On you ever again Come on let’s be together I got some money put aside And if I make it big Would you take a little ride Would you promise to always Stay by my side Woudl you give me true love And have nothing to hide Would you give my your love Would you give me your love Would you give me your love If you want to give me your love babe It’s alright It’s alright It’s alright We can make a change in our life babe Tonight It’s alright It’s alright

        As I inhale the smoke of boredom  my body shivers   for with boredom comes silence, such deafening silence   And as my hand traces her still and peaceful face   I wonder what she dreams of, or if I am found in her state of unconciousness   The ceiling stares back at me from up above   it still fascinates me looking up and thinking of things looking down upon me   She lay still and silent on the bed wrapped up as she is   still dreaming on and I'm thinking... thinking of the posibilities   Maybe she's forgotten? Maybe she's thinking of someone else   who am I to try and control one who has no control over her feelings? Her choices?
