      OK here goes nothing, I'm starting over. My old online journal is no more, I have a new address, I'll ahve a new look, more links, a profile, pictures and all that lovely stuff not to mention a knew look on myself. Ok so this is how I'm going to start out, so far this is my first year of High School at Abe. It's great minus a bitchy drama teacher. I have found a new guy to call my own, almost and this time he doesnt live in a different provence. Exsept I'm not sure how its working out, sometimes i love to think hes totally in love with me, but something show otherwise. Jared seems to be now out of the picture. Hes off girl searching and he already has two trying to go after him. I think he's overly enjoying it but hey, its not my job to judge, its his life. Jon's girlfriend Kristen haha.. she kissed him yesterday and hes overly happy which is great, Jon needs to be happy and someone to look forward to seeing. I guess its the same with Jared although, he seems content with or without someone. Danielle, my best friend, well she has had guys all over her as well and now is dating a guy named Jeremy and she seems exsteamly happy which is great. Me as a whole I've been bored as hell. The phone never rings for me, the guy i like is too busy and has let me down more then once, I get my homework done in hours my tests are going great I love my english class. I have no one to call and well... thats it. Everyday I have no choice but to sit around and think, usually I'm fine with that, but I dont have anything to think aobut anymore. I just can sit staring at the wall untill its like 9 or 10 so i can go watch a good tv show. This week I dont have much planned as of yet. I have a band consert and that should be good and its my first real consert for choir as well. Also mom asked me to go to work with her on the 5th for a take ur childern to work day but... she told me that i shouldn't go because it would be a waste of my day. which is almost a laugh .. lol cause i have nothing to waste. next semester im going to be so busy tho so i guess i shouldnt complain ... this is my break.. so i dunno.. i hope i do ok.... anyway i guess thats it.. so goodnite everyone  MOOD: Bored...

       CATCH UP TIME   OK! well, the last few days have been lightly more interesting then before. I'm starting to read To Kill A Mockingbird in English which is cool, cause I've heard its a good book, of course others hate it, but oh well it gives me something to do.   The guy I liked he well, told me not to call him anymore. Thats the last I've heard from him and really, I'm ok with it, I had a feeling it was going no where and I heard he likes some other chick so I'm fine.   I went to the dentist yesterday, I found out in december they are going to put me to sleep cut my gums open chop my wisdom teeth into 3 bits and then pull it out peice my peice.. to all four of them.. so naturally i'm... scared to death!!! .  On a lighter note, lets see, miss oboe lady, the one that stalks me and is into everything that i am, and does better then me in everything and talks to much and is really ugly, WELL it turns out i kick her ass in singing... which is of course no doubt, but FINALLY the drama teacher put her down for once and not me and it was sweet revenge... and I was happy. I also got a 90 on my poem i presented and im awesome.  As for my music.. GOOD all GOOD ... umm I got Jared ( my ex)'s birthday gift ... and its music notes for piano guitar and vocal so im soo happy... I'll be playing it forever... and so far that is it for my life....   so I will let u guys know anything else interesting that turns up in my life....

       ACHIEVEMENT?   Ok so my goal was to stay alone today, take a book and think, relax, avoide all human contact. Well I woke up this morning, go everything ready, made sure I had my new book "About the Author", My song writing book and my cd's. So i walk down to the bus stop alittle later so i would miss the early 20, because i know for a fact Danielle takes that bus.  (ps: Aside from my hate for most of my friends at this point I am also very mad at Danielle for yelling at me last night, on how i told Fred (her ex) she had a new bf.. which i dont even recall anyway) I'm almost at the lights where i cross the street to the stop and the 20 roles on by.. being the smart one that i am i dont run to the bus knowing there will be a 73 coming down the same way that takes me to the same stop in about ten minutes.  I slowly trudge along, but when i get to the lights, i notice, Danielle had gotten off the 20... that right she got right off of it   "WHY?"   I'm asking my self as i mouth the word "shit" I cross the street and go up to tlak to her.. it turns out she saw me walking and got off... just to talk to me... and tell me how sorry she is for being a bitch yesterday...  haha if only she could say shes sorry for being a bitch everyday ...  anyway so i said .. ok cool... disappointed that my days goal was totally over at that minute. eventually she asked me what was up.. i told her i've been going throughs tuff and i didnt want to talk about it .. and i was mostly tired i know she knew i was lying but oh well i dont care... so once again ... danielle starts talking about her life, and her new bf... and how all this stuff is wrong with her and thats why she spazed at me... and eventually she ran out of things to say.. and we were quiet ... i walked in the school and she followed me everywhere i went, so my idea for a nice quiet break in the morning was canceled as well.... so i did the smart thing.. i sat down next to fred in the caf... knowing danielle would talk to him.. he was also with steve and stef so i chilled out in my own little world while they talked... adding small... smart comments along the way..  then the bell rang we all went our seperate ways and i was happy.... everything else was good until lunch THE ONE TIME i NEEDED to get away. so i grabbed my lunch sat downstairs and ate.. low and behold... Katyrna, Danielle, Steph and  a few other people come sit down right next to me and start talking.... so i just sat there and ate quietly.. i had my discman on and ignored all of them... then when no one was paying attention i got up and walked away.... i went up stairs.. got out my book and ... 2 minutes later ... steph sat down next to me.... she asked me if i was ok because danielle told her i was "depressed" I hate that word anyway so ... she sat down next to me and i told her to define depressed.. and she couldnt so i said im fine just tired.. she asked me  if i wanted to be left alone... i would of said ya .. but i gave her the option... all she wanted to do was write a note... to her seceret lover.. so we sat together i read and listened to music.... steph wrote.. it was relaxing.. and that was my lunch.. it felt good... im just curious if its an accplishment or not....   after school i was hoping to get straight out of there .. but danielle caught me at my locker and took the bus with me home.. ugg.....   *sigh*  just one more day of the week Kris.... just one more day....

I went to starbucks... and talked to a lady, for an hour and a hlaf, about life, and books, and people, interests, travel... it was cool but god i need a GUY that is that.. i just need someone.. im going insain... its like in really cheesy movies where u look everywhere and someone is in love..... the only thing i really have ... to charish right now is my cd player and my music..  so life and times of what NOTHING... a boring ... life....  I dunno... mom is suddenly being nicer... homework is easy, no guy to call my own  the one mysterious guy i DO like (who isnt Jared btw) well... there are some ... technical difficulties there......

       SURPRISE!   Ok, I said i would keep you posted... it turns out Jared was refering to the past... before when I had to choose between Jon and Jared SO everythings good.  Ok now for the surprise... You know how i was desperatly waiting for someone great to sit beside me and try and get to know me... a few days ago that happened.. and A guy too Yet he never sat next to me.. while i was avoiding my friends... Anyway he told me he liked me...  The only problem this is one of my friends bfs... but that friend is also one of the many few i have a grudge on..  Ok so during these past few days I've been talking to him, calling him and such .. and hes not happy being with his gf at all .. so he wants to dump her but doesnt want her to be depressy ... but.. id unno the thing is...  this guy asked me out on friday and i dunno what to do.... im afraid he'll stop liking me and all will come to an end and ill be on the waiting list of nothing all over again... i dunno thats all that is new so far...   So i will now refer to this guy as  Mr. X  .. untill i think its safe to reveal who it is... and  Miss X  will be my friend....    MOOD: Scared, Happy, Slightly Hyper, Kinda Cold, thats it..  Song: Jacks Obsession - Nightmare before Christmas..   PS! I talked to Jon last night and I really wish he was here.. i wanna go out with him!!... I'd drop Mr. X as quick as i could... if I could have Jon lol... sorry anyway   GOODNITE!

       Here is the deal...   Ok friday my new friend Jenna, came to school after being sick for awhile so I had a real reason to ditch Danielle and Kat for a good reason, with someone knew to hang out with ... so Friday was great.. I also got to school early and I got to spend basically all morning alone reading.. Until Fred joined me for a little conversation..  This morning.. I woke up to the phone ringing... of course im not one to get up and answer it knowing its most likely for my brother.. but a minute later my brother knocks on my door, grabs my phone, gives it to me and says its danielle i think, shes crying.....  of course i grunted and answered the phone and asked her what was up she was upset because Jeremy and her had gotten in a fight, and she had just thrown up and she had to go to work in an hour and her mom didnt believe her that she was sick and .. made her go.. so she was crying and... i didnt care.. as much as it must be painful for her...  as little as it seems... i've done it.... oh well .. its her life not mine.. i just wish she would keep me out of it...  OK so most of the rest of the day .. i spent dragging my ass around.. I actually had a good conversation with my mom about school and driving and life and such... and well .. thats about it...  well aside from jared .... actually talking to me today  i was watching a movie and i had come back to a message from jared telling me to go to his journal page... so im like... ok ..  this is what he wrote... well the important stuff .. considering Jon and I and Jared and the situation..  It all started back in the day with Kristen Loader, who I will from this point forth call Krissie, to avoid getting her confused with Kristen Sigmeth, who will be known as Kristen. Krissie and I had our share of troubles, as most  couples  do, but we always had a way of handling them. But Mr. Jon over here seemed to think he needed to help us with our problems and then suddenly he was involed.  Now what I'm upset about is that Jon always feels he needs to be helping Krissie, or Krissie and me as a whole, whichever the case may be. He doesn't need to be helping hey or us! She/we doesn't/don't need help!  Note to Jon: Please understand that Krissie and I can work through our problems by ourselves. Remember--it was you getting involved with them in the first place that caused a great deal of new problems, and solved few, if any, others.  Note to Krissie:  Yes, I'm still interested in working everything out between us so we can be good again. I haven't stopped caring, and I hoped you haven't either.   Ok, if he only knew, I have no idea what Jon is doing, if he is trying to help Jared and I, I don't understand why, He knows I dont like Jared anymore... so.. i dunno ... Im going to need to give him a talking to......  "couples" "as most couples do" ?????    EXCUSE ME??   we arent a couple no more... sure we worked out our differences before.. but .. not now.... i guess he doesnt see that im not interested and neither does jon.. do i have to screem it for the world to hear.... Jon knows i like him... if i havnt told u guys that I  DO .. its the truth .. hes got himself a gf.. so hes good as a best friend.. but if hes going to like me back why is he helping Jared try not to lose me... jared is right its not his place... but im only getting this from jareds journal... so i guess ill talk to Jon later.. Ill keep you posted    SONG: Denied - Our Lady Peace  MOOD: somewhere in between, confused, bored, tired, sick, happy, and mad

       Just when your at you all time high   OK .. I have a solo in band, that i won fair and fucking square and well 'Oboe Lady' (adrien) is a quick who is in my drama class and band class, gets the same monologs as me, the same parts as me, she has the same insturment, and she thinks shes better then me... so when i get a solo in band... she gets all jelous and crap.. and her ego goes way up thinking she can do it way better then me so she should get it.. so today in band class we start the song for the first time...  and i start my solo and i screw up on this half note continusly and the teacher gets frusterated and makes a big seen .... then he asks oboe lady to help me out.... and play along with me.. LIKE THATS GOING TO HELP.. anyway so i gave my teacher a dirty look and went with the flow.... her reed wasnt working so she was aweful and i felt great... but after awhile she starts coping down the notes for the solo.. and IM LIKE... NO U DONT THIS IS MY SOLO ... but i didnt say that .. and i tryed to make it so she couldnt see the notes but she just kept looking over my sholder and all taht stuff... then FINALLY before she can finish... i put my music away and she asks if she can see my notes.. and i basically said no... because ... she wont be playing it for long..   also i got hit by a car and almost ran over walking home after band practise  and OH KEON.. ok i called him last night and the phone conversation was great and he was happy and everything.. and he wants to get together tomorrow.. but i havnt been able to get a hold of him so i think its off... ill try right now..and HES HOME.. i have to call him back in 15 minues... i wonder who hes on the phone with.. anyway so i guess i willb egetting together with him... i think he likes someone else too tho so... i dunno ill have to get it out of him..

       Its amazing how something so small can warm your heart and change the way you see everything   Ok, I have to share something with u guys, i was talking to Jon, of course he read my journal entry and he is well... appologizing as much as he can, i dunno... we kinda talked things out... i think im just bitter cause well... everything lately sucks...   but in a cry for someone to talk to ... I called Keon, knowing he wouldnt answer and.. low and behold i was wrong... he picked up.. and he sounded happy.. and he knew who i was.. and he had to go cause he was talking to his dad long distance .. but i can call back.. in 20 minutes! .. so... YAY .. I thought he hated me.... i dunno .. i think its wrong cause he stood me up a few times.. but .. i dunno... im asking for trouble.. i know it.. but im desperate.. and he is sweet... just alittle odd at times.... well .. i know... things turn around quick dont they....  Ill get back to u...   MOOD: EXSITED!

       The weirdest days are yet to come   Jon and I faught yesterday, although i have such strong feelings for him, i also feel a sense of resentment towards him, maybe its not resentment... but I ... I seem to have problems talking to him sometimes, maybe jelousy, or something else, i dunno...... Anyway, that date with  Mr. X  was no go, No show, I got stood up, wow did i see that coming or what, he was too busy and I had to tell mom about it and when i called him asking where he was she dictated everything for me to say and my mom scared him away. so he said "forget it"... a day after he broke up with  Mrs. X  and now... I'm alone again... and not even able to have ... Jon in the back of my head... he said something last night, hit me kinda hard, because well, i realised that its no different with him or Jared, I'm no good this far away from him, so whats the point of gapping over it..... I didnt talk to anyone today...... at school... i was by myself .. and i could care less if people missed me or not...   MOOD: Lonely, Sad, Lost  Song: Hello -Evenesence

Also I was sick yesterday and today, and i forsed myself to go to school, I had to skip choir, in fear i would puke if u will... while singing.. so i went home straight after school... and I ended up throwing up last night.... at midnight.... aside from the gorry details of my past few exsperiences in the past day i have some good news...  I've been quick lonely as usual lately and out of no where... Keon calls me... surprise surprise... he said he waited in the foyer ... instead of outside like he originally said... and he got in trouble from his teacher .... while waiting for me... i mean .. once again all he has is a excuse .. but hes offering to make it up to me.. this time avoiding his school all together cause its bad luck and heading off to chanook with me .. on friday... we didnt get to talk much about it cause he had to go shopping for his moms christmas gift .. but he said he would call tonite.... so if he does then.... i will give him a chance if he doesnt call i will deam him just like everyone else... the truth is .. i really like him tho... and i know its wrong for me to give in so much... im just needy .. ill take what i can.. and if something goes wrong i wont dwell on it ... i mean ... im more prepared... but want to do something with someone and hes the only person who has really kept calling and such .... that i can do something with ... so i am needy but so what I HAVE NEEDS lol...   Mood: Kinda Happy, Kinda Sick, Prepared for the worst, well rested tho  Song: Easier to run- Linkin Park  "Easier To Run"  It's easier to run Replacing this pain with something numb It's so much easier to go Than face all this pain here all alone  Something has been taken from deep inside of me The secret I've kept locked away no one can ever see Wounds so deep they never show they never go away Like moving pictures in my head for years and years they've played  (If I could change I would take back the pain I would) (Retrace every wrong move that I made I would) (If I could stand up and take the blame I would) (If I could take all the shame to the grave I would) (If I could change I would take back the pain I would) (Retrace every wrong move that I made I would) (If I could stand up and take the blame I would) (I would take all my shame to the grave)  [Chorus] It's easier to run Replacing this pain with something numb It's so much easier to go Than face all this pain here all alone  Sometimes I remember the darkness of my past Bringing back these memories I wish I didn't have Sometimes I think of letting go and never looking back And never moving forward so there'd never be a past  (If I could change I would take back the pain I would) (Retrace every wrong move that I made I would) (If I could stand up and take the blame I would) (If I could take all the shame to the grave I would) (If I could change I would take back the pain I would) (Retrace every wrong move that I made I would) (If I could stand up and take the blame I would) (I would take all my shame to the grave)  Just washing it aside All of the helplessness inside Pretending I don't feel misplaced It's so much simpler than change  [Chorus] It's easier to run Replacing this pain with something numb It's so much easier to go Than face all this pain here all alone  It's easier to run (If I could change I would take back the pain I would) (Retrace every wrong move that I made) It's easier to go (If I could change I would take back the pain I would) (Retrace every wrong move that I made I would) (If I could stand up and take the blame I would) (I would take all my shame to the grave)

      So much to say, yet I have so little time, and I would rather not make time because I don't really want to talk about anything right now... so I leave you with a quote from one of my favorite movies 'Practical Magic'. Ever since I have seen this movie I have identified with this quote, and now it means more sense then ever so, this is it, I do not have a mood or song for today so I bid you Goodnite.   'Dearest Gilly, Sometimes I feel there is a hole inside me. An emptiness that, at times, seems to burn. I think if you lifted my heart to your ear, you could probably hear the ocean. And the moon tonight, there's a circle around it, a sign of trouble not far behind. I have this dream of being whole. Of not going to sleep each night wanting. But still, sometimes when the wind is warm or the crickets sing, I dream of a love that even time will lie down and be still for. I just want someone to love me. I want to be seen. I don't know. Maybe I've had my happiness. I don't want to believe it but there is no man, Gilly, only that moon.'

      I got a 22 year olds work number lol... we just started talking one day and i got his number.. yes i know hes 22 but hes atleast someone i can talk to .. he is amazingly sweet and he cant give me his house # as of yet cause the person he is living with doesnt want people to know the phone # ..... but he's moving over a dispute anyway .. so hes house hunting.. and we've been talking for the last few days and its cool... Age difference is weird.. but most people my age dont understand me much anyway.. unless they're smart  like Jon and Jared and Kevin and Thomas... I dunno .. We'll see how this turns up.. His name is Dallas  he told me today that he was so exited to go to work.. lol cause he knew he could talk to me after he was done .. it was kinda funny.. and sweet .. ya i dunno ..   I wrote Jon a letter kinda, I havnt really finished it.. I'll send it later..... I still wish i knew what i want  NEW CD'S: Default- Elocation and Finger Eleven   PS: Jon If you love nickleback.. you'll love default too!

      OK I'm guessing you want me to update so here it goes...  The past while mom has yelled at me many times.. I got hit onces....  I told Jon ... that I felt that i would be better off .. well the situation would be better off if we stopped talking for awhile.. why?  I don't know why.. I've been so stressed lately .. and everytime i talk to him.. I just want him more... and I get so jelous... Kristen talks to me all the time.. she reallys great.. shes alot like me... but it hurts talking to her ... when she asks me where Jon is? and how great he is.. and i have to throw in a joke just to calm myself.. cause i wanna ... join in the convo.. saying how much he means to me.. and i cant do it.. .. i dont wnt to get in the way of things.. so im going to shut up around.. him i guess... i cant see it lasting for long.. since i told him how i felt... i've been thinking about him more... and taking advice from romeo and juilet.. and when friar lorance.. tells romeo when hes grieveing about him killing ... tybult ... and not being aloud in the town.. so he cant see juilet... and he just crys and frier larence tells him to stop crying .. and acting like a baby and find a way to be with his wife... to help her through troubled times.. and comfort her... and well have sex with her too .. but i dunno he says that u cant abandon someone u love over saddness.. and thats what im doing... im driving myself insain.....  I havnt talked to keon in awhile... hes never home.. so it seems that lonelyness is my fate for now.. maybe my senses will come back..

       New years eve day with Dallas and Happy new years wish to all!   I went to go see Dallas today again... we spent most of the day together.. It was great.. I mean .. it was an adventure... well for me anyway... I got to Dallas's work... and sat down.... and waited for him.. his boss wasnt too happy about me being around.. Dallas.. while he was working.. so I desided to be good and sit down.. His boss actually walk by and smiled and said hi to me.. which was odd... I mean.. Mr. unexspression.. can.. smile lol .. I dunno .. I was going to tell him I was sorry about ... yesterday.. but I just left it at that... Anyway .. after awhile.. Dallas and I .. got up and went to go meet his cusin.. so she could help us paint.. Dallas's new place.. but she was sick and couldnt come.. so we went to... his house.. (which is right on jr. high memory lane for me lol.. well more childhood.. memories anyway..) ya so we got there.. and it well... its not very well put together...  and I mean there are holes in the walls.. and its just run down.. and dallas has to work with it.. but we went out.. i got to buy him some lightbalbs :D lol thats cool and cups... and ya.. we just grabed some pop and just hung out for awhile.. until we desided to... get on the payphone and call his landlord... to go get some paint.. and after standing.. for what seemed like a million hours in the cold.. he showed up... and we went paint shopping.. with a guy who... is very very very gay lol or possibly bi.. most likely bi .. cause he's seeing a girl.. so .. i dunno .. anyway .. he drives like a crazy phsyco.. person lol.. and likes to play his music really loud and hit on dallas lol!... i wont get to much into that.. but it was quite entertaining.. anyway after amking like 3 stops we found a place.. got paint.. and went back and started painting... then i dunno we just kinda hung out after that.. and its was great.. most of the time.. was spent just holding eachother ... and keeping eachother warm lol.. .. it's cold outside!!!  but im happy... i like him so much.. i could hold him for an hour and i would be the happiest person alive... I'm kinda shy around his mom... i really dont know.. how to act or.. talk or anything.. and i dunno.. i guess im just shy ...   anyway .. i got home.. and all i can do .. is think about Dallas... just everything that happened today it all fresh in my memory .. i can still feel him and smell him.. and i remember puting my hands in his pockets.. and his eyes... wow :| .. is eyes are amazing!.. they are like crystals... it's amazing..... i think sometimes.. Dallas.. thinks im not happy or interested or something .. cause i go blank for a moment or .. 2 or i wont look at him.. well i dont know if he actually feels like that.. its just when im with him.. im like wow... i go blank for a  second.. or like go into deep thought .. i love it when he holds me tho... like tonite i was tired.. but not too tired... but when i was in his arms im like.. ok now i wanna go to bed.. lol  but at the same time.. i didnt want to .. cause i dont want to sleep.... when i can be doing stuff with him instead..  anyway .. its new years now.. the clock hit 12 not to long ago.. i've been sitting here and writing this.. in between phone calls and instant messages on msn and yahoo... all the same new years stuff.... and I miss dallas... he sounds so sad.. yet happy.. he misses me... and i can tell that .. new years mean a lot to him... and i couldnt be there.. to .. celebrate .. with him.. and i want to... just snap my fingers and be there with him right now... just to make him smile.. he sounded sad when he called.. i mean .. i can hear a smile in his voice.. but it's ... different i guess... but i just want to say .. happy new years to everyone.. who reads this... it's now 2004 and no matter what happens this year good or bad.. learn and strive and dream from it... never let anything stand in your way... last year my resolution for my self was : "Have faith in yourself even when the roads get long love, sing, and believe in the impossible" and i think i did:) .. and i will continue for .. many years to come... and this year i think.. that I'm going to add.. that i shouldnt let the past control me... I have so many bad memory;s that i wish i never had.. and i know i have to live with them.. but i shouldnt let them... get to me all the time.... i get upset over small things.. just because.. i have a  flashback.. of my mom.. hitting me .. or something... i loose who i am... for a minute.. and i cant let that minute grow..... and also.. I hope that with Dallas in the picture how.. i have a new start... *smiles*   I also wish Dallas the best in this up coming year.. and he better be happy lol....     Happy New Year everyone!!! have a great night and a great year! Strive to be the best you can be   I'm going to bed ...... lol

      *dies of happiness*  ok I told my mom and brother today that i was gunna go out shopping.. and instead i took the c-train down to Dallas's work. since i told him i was coming.. i couldn't really back out... Not that I would, I usually take risks, I just ... take my time... anyway he gave me directions.. and i around 12 I left.. and my brother drove me to the mall... and i took the c-train from there... once i got to the station... I had an idea on where iw as going.. but i didnt want to do it lol so i took a longer way..i went down a block and walked in a circle...lol well it was more like a square... but hey anyway.. right when i thought i was lost... i bumped right into it.. and im like wow.... there it is.....it was almost by chance.. its kinda freaky  anyway! so i get up to the building .... and i didnt know if i wanted to go in or not... i mean .. this guy has never seen me before.. and i mean i've seen a picture of him.. but i forget these things....i didnt memorise his face or anything.. mind u .. i think he looks cuter now then in his pictures .. but ya i went inside.. it was all good... I didnt see him at first.. i kinda looked at a few people and .. they didnt seem to care that i was there... so im like GEE thanks.. but lol thats cool cause like a minute later Dallas walks down .. and he said hi Kristen.. and I thought i was awesome lol.. i didnt want to ask the mean people who wouldnt address my presents anyway! So I basically hung out with him for 4 hours and a half.. and It was great... I mean most of the time I had to follow him around ... so he could work.. but I thought it was fun.. and most of the people that worked there didn't seem to mind at all .. and a few talked to me... i actually felt at home there... and Dallas is just amazing.. I told myself I would be the first one to hug him... but I didnt want to .. I mean I did.. but I was kinda scared ... so when he went to go give me a hug for the first time I was like YAY! finally! lol and I could stop holding him since then.. I mean I had to .. most of the time.. so he could work.. and his boss .. is kinda... interesting.. you cant tell what he is thinking.. so I tend to want to be good around him .. lol plus I dont want to get Dallas in trouble... and I'm going there again.. whether they want me to or not... so I might as well keep a good rep....   when he holds me... its great... he means it and i got to door flirt lol ... no really.. he had his hand on the door... he was leaning against it and talking to a few people .. and i dunno i was looking at his hand.. and i was thinking to myself.. i wanna touch his hand... but he was talking to people.. and i didnt want to .. but i did.. so i like brushed my finger against his ... and he looked at me and smiled so i basically got total permission .. to hold his hand.. while he was taking to the people.. and the best part was .. he held back..as odd as it sounds.. taht really made me happy... because keon didnt do that.. i would touch his hand.. and that would be it.. he wasnt interested at all .. and im like grrr... i dunno its odd.. i just get so.... intriged by small things.... and when he reads this he's either going to be happy and thinking im odd .. or just happy lol... but i dunno .. it was great .. there is so much to say that I loved about it.. but it basically all comes down to ... I like him and he better call me tonite lol and as far as i can tell this will not be the last time i will see him :)   Mood: Exstremly Happy! Song: Who cares! lol   ps: Dallas is great!

      I guess I should update you on... life...   I'm slowly getting better.. most of my week has been full of taking pills.. laying down... and getting better.. or atleast try to.. my mouth still hurts .. but im walking around more.. I've talked to Dallas a few times and I couldnt be happier!!!!!!!!!!!, he is seriously the guy I've been waiting to talk to for the longest time. He calls when he says he will, he looks forward to talking to me, he listens and we have so much in commen... I can actually talk to someone now.  I've been reading my old journal entrys and i feel like such a fool. I mean I had that thing with Jeremy and Danielle... and he was such a dick... I mean he didnt even give me a chance... and Keon.. well he's just wanting to get into my pants... He never shows up for anything, never calls, he calls me up asks me to come over .. and that would be that then if i couldnt i wouldnt hear from himf or a month. He doesnt want to have a converation with me. He's too busy for me. He's just horny and I've known that all along, but I've been in so much need .. for someone that I would stand in the cold.. just to have someone to hold me. and in the end.. be standing there...for .. nothing....   The only thing I really got out of , having a thing for Keon was.. standing alone in a graveyard more then once... sitting on this bench... It inspired me for a poem and I really like it...  THen there is Jon and Jared... Jon well I've always liked him, but I cant sit around wishing for something that cant be there. I would of met up with him when he came to Calgary this christmas, but with my operation I couldn't anyway.. i think we are best off as best friends right now... and Jared.. well it's over between him and I .. no more .. I cant take it...  He told me he missed me... yesterday .. and wanted to talk more... all i could think was no... He can't drop me and pick me up when he feels like .. nor can Jeremy or Keon ....  Besides.. it's weird cause.. Danielle has dated both keon and jeremy at one point... i kinda just interested in them cause they were there... and thats stupid.. very stupid of me.. how can I be happy with people like that...  No this time with Dallas.. I'm going to play it cool.. I pick him because .. well i truely like him ... and that is that... he's so far making up for everyone elses mistakes.... age doesnt matter to me at this point.. I know everyone else cares.... but if im going to make this choice.. I'll have to learn from it .. like everything else.. who knows what will happen.

      a lot has happened in the past while and I'm sorry for the lack of updatness...I have a million things that I've been up to.. lots of studying.. adn stressing.. and of course i've gone out with dallas... a few nights ago.. he got me a dozen roses and we had pizza and hung out .. it was great... mom knows about him now.. or atleast that I'm seeing him... the problem is.. she thinks he goes to my school and I'm afraid to correct her.. and if she finds out he's 22 im dead.. and i could lose him for good... my brother is going insaid when it comes to Dallas... he's very protective.. and its weird... anyway i wrote up a 2 page remake of green eggs and ham for a drama project and I have a feeling I'll do alright with it... I've been running into a lot of trouble with Keon.. he keeps calling.. and wanting to get back together and is all jelous of Dallas.. and he's not the only one.. in the past 5 weeks I've had guys find out i was dating Dallas and they were so upset.. It's amazing... I got a watch today ... its really pretty I'm quite fond of it... actually  anyway on to another point... I told Jon that for good I'm pretty sure i just want to .. leave what we have behind and just stop talking .. because what we had was a dream and we can't keep talking to eachother like it's still going to happen... so most of my friends from regina are ... blocked now... jared .. jon.. kristen... all of those people.... Jon is the most upset tho... he's emailed me like 10 times.. bagging to talk to me over and over again... and i dont know what to do.. he wants to work out things.. u has to have my friendship.. but i have nothing to offer him.. so its ... pointless .. i dunno im confused.. I feel bad...for leaving him like that but... things arent the same between us.... and i cant see it getting any better.. anyway he's baggin for me to talk to him next week and like work something out .. so i will but im not promising anything..... i dont know why he needs my friendship so bad.. what have i ever done for him.. he just thinks I've helpe dhim through everything but... it was all him... i didnt do much i just reminded him of other possibilies... i dunno maybe im going crazy .. and if i am hes better off not talking to me anyway   Off of the sad stuff... Dallas and I are doing great and he is still calling me... and it's kinda funny .. cause i met his brother and one of his ex's .. on thursday when we got together and ... well his brother likes to bugg dallas alot like.. most syblings.. i just think its funny that ... no matter how old u get it never stops...and his ex.. well no comment... i mean i dont know much about her.. but i think im better then her.. lol!!! to be blunt enough...i just mean when it comes to Dallas.. I kick her ass... in all forms.. haha.. im so mean.. I'm sure shes a cool person tho..   and I'm the first gf he's ever had that he has let touch his hair.... which is amazing cause i didnt have to do much to deserve it... once again.. i stress we havnt even kissed yet.. which i'm dying for.. but the fact is... i hug him.. and talk to him make him laugh and i have a free passport to exsplore anywhere i want ;) lol! and i kinda have.. aside from like... one place lol and we havnt kissed yet but its all good.. I still love him to death.. anyway i should get goin... im gunna go watch a movie or somethin   Song: DJ Sammy- Heaven  Mood: In Love

      On a very very very high demand from someone i know by the name of Jon .. I believe I am supposed to update this site lol and talk about whats new with me...  Yes I have been reading your site Jon.. sorry it took me so long to get back to you.  I seriously dont have much to update you on.. but i can try to remember  Last week I had exsams.. math and english.. and i most likely did a pretty good job umm I had an in class essay a week ago while schoolw as still in... i did pretty good on that.. and be sides that i've been going out with dallas or ashely or steph.. just running around with a few out bursts from my mom.. which is never out of the ordinary .... on tuesday i ended up crying at Dallas's house .. for more then one reason but the main one being that mom was getting on my nerves so badly i needed to cry.. and u know that was... the first time in a long time i've cryed with someone to hold on to.... so... ya....  I've gotten to get to know dallas's brother and his gf .. alittle better now.. they have some over a few times to dallas's house.. and his brother... is quite the rapster... lol he's a very interesting person.. and his gf connie who used to go out with dallas is.... well i dunno.. she seems like the type who is kinda controling.. likes to joke around alot and she also goes along with whatever is going on around her.. she doesnt seem to have a mind over her own.. but i dont really know much about her.... im probably wrong .... sept maybe the controling part... i hate the way she looks at dallas tho.. she like belittles him... and i dont think thats fair...   i got guitar stings and oboe reeds in the past while.. been playing alot of music and stuff.... i have these weeks off.... so i might as well be productive.. once school starts im going to be busier then hell tho... im afraid of next simester... social, french, science and band/gym..... ahhhhhh!   thats about it.. really.... im not going to get much into what my mom has been yelling at me about cause.. i really dont want to talk about it... but Jon i do miss talking to u .. im sorry i havnt been online alot and i hope your doing ok.....   thats all i really ahve to say ....  i also got... new cds .. stone temple pilots.... and 3 goo goo dolls cds and alisha keys so thats cool.. anyway talk to u alter   Song: Iris - Goo Goo Dolls Mood: I'm alright

      ok so monday is long gone and its wednesday night... it's still cold outside .. but that hasnt really stood in the way of me getting outside and going over to his house. I just finished reading my journal entry from monday .. and i think when i was writing it.. i thought i was coming out a lot more different.. then how its sounds.. and the more i think about it... the situation isnt that bad.... its not like im bending over backwards to see keon or anything.. i havnt seen him since that first time... and i dont call him or nothing... besides... Dallas treats me better then him.. and i think i should just stand up and be like... keon.. i know u like me... but im going out with dallas.. and im not sure i want to give up this chance for you.. but ya anyway  Dallas came over to my house last night... it was cool..  mom didnt say anything after she met him.. so im not sure how she feels about him.. she was nice and all.... kinda laughed at his jokes... they didnt talk much or nothing... so im not sure.. but oh well...  I'm going swimming with him tomorrow.... and saturday .. im SUPPOSed To be going skiing with him my brother and cindy but .... dallas might not be able to come.. and im mad!!!!! well not mad but sad... i want him to come! he has to!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ... anyway i think im done writing for the day.. i know my ...  entries havnt been very entertaining or nothing.. but once school starts back up ill have a hell of a lot more things to say i promise!  love u all lots..

      It's monday morning.... well early afternoon.. but it might as well be the morning... its cold outside.... im hungry ..... and tired.... and all i can really do is think.... these past few weeks... have been horrible for me .... and great for me all at the same time.. Like i've said mom has been on my back .... ever since she found out about Dallas... and I fear that everything she says and does.. may fall and crash all around me... i knoww dallas doesnt care what she says or thinks.. and neither do i ..... but i hate having to deal with it at the same time.... sometimes i regret going to his house because.. if i dont come home on the right terms... shes going to be after me once more  plus keon has been keeping up his little arguement on how we would be great together.. and he is refusing to talk to me really cause it "hurts him too much" to know that im with someone else...  also .. anyother problem I've been having is.. Tim.... my ex ... and the first true boyfriend i had.... has started to talk to me again... asking me to call... and he started falling for me... while knowing that im going out with dallas..... and he lives in ontario now.... so im trying to save the friendship... because i havnt been this close to him in a long while.. and our past is just too deep... i know i can turn to him for anything.. and hes just overally upset... sayign alot of things that keon has... about how he doesnt want to be put second .......next to dallas.. and im supposed to dump dallas for keon or.... tim.... and im not going to do it... but there is so much pressure on me and its killing me............. dallas doesnt really know any of this .. and i dont know if he still reads this site but when he finds out i dont want him to be upset...cause nothing is going to change ... between us ... its just hard ... im need friends...and its pathetic... i dont even talk to my friends... but i need to have them.. so i act stupid to keep them... im  not  going to cheat... but im afraid to tell them to fuck off and i dont know why!!!!!! and its tearing me apart.... whats wrong with me!!!!!!!!! dallas i love you.. you know that.... nothing will change cause of this i promise... they are just jack asses and cant bugger off.. i'll figure out everything... in a few days... it sjust cause im tired so im slowly going crazy that it lol

       School Time   Back to the old routine of going from class to class.. having projects .. and homework and grr... i dont like my new teacher.. with an exseption of my science teacher.. but all of them nothing like mr. easten.. my english teacher last sumester... but I'll live... al least my science teacher Mrs. Everett has a great sense of humour I'm getting my stomac problems again.. like most school days... i dont know why it always happens on school days... sometimes it doesnt.. but usually on monday and sometimes during the week I'll get them its kinda frusterating... but ya.. anyway I have Social and Science and French plus Band/ Gym.. for the next half of the year My social teacher.. is Mr. Lopez.. He was the spanish teacher.. for the first half.. or so I've heard.. he seems.. ok... he's kinda boring and not fun.... but he seems to like repeating himself and hes slightly unorginized but at the same time too organised... i dunno... he gave us a 100 page booklest of peices of paper... and we are working on that all year.. its like having a book but it goes in ur binder... but he never knows what we are talking about.. like my Science teacher... quite forgetfull...and thats all i can really say about him For science.. I have Mrs. Everett as i said before.. she seems ok.. shes one of those people that .. as long as ur good she loves u .. and come ontime and all that stuff.... shes very organised.. which makes me happy and I'm sure I'll kick ass in science this year... shes good at making me smile.. its my lighter period of the day!  and French .. is ok .. my teacher Mrs. Dunn is nice and slightly outgoing... shes very interested in french which is cool and she puts french music on in class... that makes me happy.. being the music geek i am.. if i cant listen to my discman... at least i can listen to something.. besides people... bitching about their lives...  I've been in school for 3 days so far .. at first .. it sucked crap.. now i feel a bit better.. once i get used to everything I'll be happy.. i do miss.. mr. easton though he was a great teacher .. oh and by the way .. i got the highest mark on my English essay i wrote for the first half YAY!!!

      It's been awhile since I updated so here is the scoop. Dallas broke up with me not to long ago over reasons of my mom. I'd rather not get into it too much. I dont have much to say about it anyway. Keon and I have been getting together, and so far he has been great in meeting up with me and such. I got a capo for my guitar and i have yet another guy at the age of 23 who is interested in me. its just a constant cycle of evilness. I've had so much homework the past few weeks it's killing me.. and I got a capo for my guitar. and I've desided to name my guitar Iris or Spirit or something else.. but i want to name it... anyone who wants to help me out is aloud to lol.

      AAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH  I had the worst day ever! but i'll shorten it for you first .. in french i had to take up a role in the paly were reading i sucked so bad.. I cant read in french and everyone was laughing at me .... well not everyone.. but alex wasnt there lol he came late.. so he missed me being stupid.. for the most part and i have a shit load of homework it's not fun... anyway i have some what good knews... first of all my social teacher gave me an exstention for my social project  and i found out alex's last name!!! and I emailed him this huge ass note.....     Hi, my name is Kristen... and I'm positive that you're in my french and social class and this may sound a little odd.. but I kind of want to get to know you. I don't really know why, you seem very kind hearted, quiet, and I've walked by you while you talk to your friends and you seem quite happy and content around them. I promise you this is the crazyest thing I have ever done espeically over email, but I would feel more stupid coming up to you in class and just saying I want to get to know you. I guess I'm shy when it comes to that, so this is my other alternative. You've seen me before; I'm the girl who ... was by your locker one day talking to one of my friends and you dropped your lock and I picked it up for you; I also sat next to you twice during french, while we were on the computers and I'm pretty sure you'll figure out who I am but if you don't, I'm not stalking you, I promise.  I guess all I have left to say is I really don't want you to freak out, but there's something about you that is telling me to get to know you. You seem different then most people, not in a bad way and You're a mystery to me, and mysteries are always best when they are solved .I'm quite quiet in class too so we have something in commun I guess but I'm going to shut up before I totally scare you away. But feel free to email me back and hopefully I will get a chance to get to know you. k? :)   Have a good day  Kristen Loader   So now i have to wait for a reply and i can't wait... even tho he'll be freaked out .. i might get a reply and if not i have a reason to approch him ... i guess... im not .. omg i like him.. its insain... watch him turn out to be some religious guy ..... omg.... only time will tell .... OMG and also i found out my beloved english teacher Mr. Easten wont be teaching... english 20 next year .. most likely and ! he's retiring .... when im going to be in grade 12 i'm never going to see him again!!!! after that .. and im so sad he was the greatest english teacher i have every had! omg im sad .. i'm going to miss him so much ... i do wish him the best on his retirement.. and he talk to me this morning .. it was great .. we had a long conversation it made me happy ... and he said it was nice talking to me.. yay! but awe lol all at the same time ... oh well anyway thats all i have to say ... so bye

      You know... I think I may actually like someone ... I havn't really met.... I have him in two of my classes french and social.. and ever since  the first day of school for the second semester I've noticed him and I've been watching in awe.. He's not really hot ... well he is.. but to me.. not to most... but there's something about him that seems so.... different.... and I really wanna get to know him... He usually doesnt talk in class.. and he doesnt seem to talk to many people.. JUST LIKE ME... and  the first time i heard him talk.. the teacher asked him to come up to help take up a character in the play that we are reading... so he played a "man" in the play and he has the most amazing voice... i could fall alseep the happest person... just listening to him...... I've just been watching him.. not talking to him or anything.. ever since school started back up... but once I found out his name I went on webCT .. which is a internet thing that my french teacher set up for her class and she has email on it and ... school work.... print out... umm practise grammer stuff.. and online tests... all that stuff.. its really cool.. but with the email she has everyone listed... by first and last name .. so u can email anyone taking french right now... the problem is i dont know his full name.. and his first name is alex.. i looked through it and there is  an alexander and an alex... so i kinda .. emailed one of them and guessed asking if they had social first period on day ones... and french last period... ... and since then i've been waiting for a reply and nothing has come up... but today in class... the teacher said.. we were going to the library to work on grammer exsersizes on the computer....  on web CT and i was so happy because he could check his email .. cause i dont know if he does it at home or not .... so ... just to check if it was him... i sat next to him.. while we were on the computers and i kinda watched to see if it was him.... and he did open his email eventually  but i didnt see anything from me... so ! i emailed the other one today ... and now i have to wait till he checks it again cause hopfully i want to start talking to him.... but also today... since i was sitting next to him.. i wanted him to kinda...talk to me.. and i noticed he smiles alot when he talks to people.. so i was dying for his smile lol... so i asked him after 9 minutes of forcing myself to do it .. i asked if we had social next .. and i already knew we did but i really need to say something to him... of course he thought for a second ... and said yes and smiled.. and i was so happy .. after that.... then we went to social.. and i glanced over at him every once and awhile.. of course he wasnt looking at me... thats ok tho... anyway moving on .. we had double of social... so lunch was in between the 2 periods.... and i walked up to were i usually eat.... and i started talking to steph.. and who walks by me .. but alex.... and he went into his locker... I KNOW WERE HIS LOCKER IS NOW... but anyway lol ...  he dropped his lock.... and i picked it up for him and gave it to him and he said thanks.. and it made me happy.. i didnt say anything back tho.. and i should of!  but anyway ... i told everyone i was going to go for a walk alone.. cause i didnt feel like socialising and i walked away and alex walks right by me.. and i almost had the erge to follow him... but he stoped to talk to someone...  but i learned he has friends but and... seems friendly and it seems like a good crowd... well it was one person but anyway.. i just kept walking and a few minutes later.. im walking up one of the stair cases... and lol alex walked down the stairs with his friend... and he didnt say anything.. and neither did i ... but god ....... im obsessed over someone i dont know! .. anyway .... i ask around and find jenna in the art room and i sat in there and drew stuff... while she worked...  and i couldnt stop thinking about him.. wondering what hes like... all that stuff... then i go back to class once the bell rings.. and he was silent as usual didnt say anything to me.... and i kept looking at him lol... not like he notices.... i mean im across the room from him... but anyway the day slowly goes on after that.. but ... after school i once i closed my locker and i turned around and i saw walk by and i thought to myself this is my chance..... so i followed him down different stair cases... until i kinda gave up... i didnt want to scare him away ... so i dunno .. i get to see him tomorrow tho! lol .. maybe this is my break.. this is a guy i can pick.. and fight for .. im sick of guys coming to me .. im going to go after alex.. it may take me a bit tho.. and he may not like me ... but come what may .. im sure as hell going to try !

I do have a highlight thought... after we performed our peices for the judges... we went to a clinc with a conductor/judge and she asked the fron row flutes and clarinets.. and oboes to tune... so she asked us to play in dividually ... and she told me i have an amazing sound coming through my insurment... and i felt great... plus there was this guy who kept starring at me in social class... it was flattering... that never happens to me... and i think im giving up on every guy from now on.... i still have mixed emotions about how i still feel about Keon and Dallas..... i seem to change my mind alot ... i hate it ... cause i dont know what i want... and i never had.... and even though i havnt been talking to Jon i do miss him... and I hope hes ok.... i think if i were there with him... it wouldnt matter....

      It has been acouple of days since my last entry. Not much new has happened. My title is now "the suck up" because I happen to be nice to people and fellow teachers at my school including people I have never met and that in the mind of other people... makes me a suck up... great huh!?... People should be more nice to each other! oh well ... also, I find myself wandering up to Alex atleast once or twice a day, asking him how it's going and if he is still interested in getting together ... and so far its seems to be friday ... friday was kind of my idea... the only problem is Keon asked me to go out on friday.. of course he just wants to come over and have me .. "do things to him"... *sigh* i dunno....  Im just going to cancel out on keon and hell him i have work to do after school... today was ... okish... mostly bad to begin with but as the 2 last perode came around and i talked to alex i felt alot better.. and i caught him... looking at me a few times today .... also .... after social... he usually walks to opposite way i do... but today i felt like walking the same way as he did.. i wasnt too .. exsited.. about going to science away .. but i ended up walking by his math class. and he looked at me and smiled... and it was great.. lol he probably thinks im stalking him.. and I kinda am but .. in a good way .. i mean him no harm........  I find myself wandering the hallways more often these days.... Hoping maybe to run into Alex or talk to Kevin or Thomas ... You know I'm starting to notice that.. Kevin.... last periode.. is always walking up to my locker after school and talking to me...,, Its kinda interesting   also i want thinking of starting to write a book .. i wont go into details yet... but ya i thought though i would write that down.. im gunna study for my test tomorrow

      Last night, I got my reply from Alex... this is what it said   Sorry it took me this long to reply, in all honesty I rarely check the webct mail.  Admittedly I did feel the sudden surge of panic when you came to me with your interest  in getting to know me, I myself am an introvert by nature and so I find it difficult to get  to know anybody, especially by the, "hi my name is....." kind of introduction. I applaud  you for your bravery in asking me at all and I hope that I haven't been too rude when  going about my sometimes dreary school existance. Perhaps one of the reasons why I  find it especially difficult to meet people in french or social studies is because they are  grade ten classes and I myself am in grade eleven, now I know that the differences in  age are entirely inconsequential, nevertheless I find myself portrayed (by myself and  others perhaps?) as the big (stupid) kid in class that has known nothing but failure all his  life and is dangerous to all who wish to succeed in (his) class, for he will undoubtedly  bring them down. Now this is by no means what I myself believe but there remains the  potential for that particular energy to be manifested in just such an environment. On  another note I would like to make one thing clear, I do not deign to assume that you  have romantic interests in me but I would like to make clear, nonetheless, that I am not  looking for any type of relationship any more involved than friendship. In saying this I  am not making some sort of arrogant assumption in regards to your intentions, instead I  am merely defining the parameters of the type of relationship I am able to handle (for  the time being anyway). If I haven't offended you by this point then feel free to reply by  e-mail or simply approach me in class about meeting after school for coffee or something  of that nature, Weed's café is quite an interesting place if you've never been.   I end this e-mail with a sort of clear conscience that will permit the assuagement of my  troubled stomach and hopefully what has been said has responded to the majority of  your questions.   -Alexander    what an amazing guy... I sure as hell can pick them huh.... I'm not hurt at all.. by anything said im cool with all of it... but anyway ... i went to school... i kinda freaked out about talking to him... and i didnt really say anything to him until the very end of last period... i keep forgetting to bring up the coffee thing tho... i should probably go.. it would be fun.. i need to remember to ask first... you have to see his smile... its unlike any smile i have ever seen before... wow... but I've talked to him now.. he knows i exsit.. i didnt totally freak him out.. and i found my own friend! lol this is great   thats for the good new.... the bad news is my science teacher.. i hate her with a passion... and im going to fail her class if i dont do something and quick.. i got 0/11 on a lab.... 0! ... i have never had a mark like that before and i sure as hell am not going to fail science..I can't .. I'm better then that.... *sigh* im scared...  so in regards to how my day was.. it kinda balences out ..... i dont know what to do... but i made knew friend.. who somehow reminds me of jon .... but different.... anyway have a good night....everyone

      I was talking to Alex today after a hard day of things i would like to leave unmentioned for awhile.... but in this conversation there was something said that warmed my heart so quickly   Kristen - "Sorry I'm not talking too much" Alex - " It's ok, I'm not either; but it doesn't bother me" then he looked at me and smiled  wow... what a way to end a aweful day

      Standing On The Edge Lyrics  I'm not asking for much But I need a little time to find What it is I want And is it you this time?  I wish that I knew you better I wish that I knew myself I wanted to be forever But now I see it’s still only me  Standing on the edge of the world Now I don’t want you to catch me I want you to let me Stand up here and walk on my own I can’t learn to love you If you’re all I know  Saw you waiting there Across the parking lot I told you, you never looked so cold You were looking for All the things you know I’m not And believe me I’ve tried I’ve tried, oooh  I thought that I knew you better Than I knew myself  Standing on the edge of the world Now I don’t want you to catch me I want you to let me Stand up here and walk on my own I can’t learn to love you If you’re all I know  Uh-oh, uh-oh Don’t let it change your mind Whoa-oh, uh-oh On and on and on and on....  Standing on the edge of the world Now I don’t want you to catch me I want you to let me Stand up here and walk on my own I can’t learn to love you I can’t learn to love you, whoa-oh I can’t learn to love you If you’re all I know....

      Wanting Out Lyrics  I turned around and there you were standing in front of me I can't ignore the fact that you were back for more  It's kind of funny when you think about it It's kind of hard to agree to disagree and we're back to the step number no but like you want me back  So take me away 'cause I don't want to be back I should learn to speak up when enough is enough and I'm wanting out I'm wanting out  I saw you smiling in the photograph and I remember how you used to laugh But that was then forgive and forget It's just easiest  So take me away 'cause I don't want to be back I should learn to speak up when enough is enough and I'm wanting out and I'm wanting out  Da da da da da da da oooooooh   And I don't know if I can get through this And I never knew that before Oh You make up your mind and suddenly find you're wanting more  So take me away Cause I don't want to be back I should learn to speak up when enough is enough and I'm wanting out Oh I'm wanting out [repeat]  And I'm wanting out And i'm wanting out And i'm wanting out Oh. And I'm wanting out

      You Hold My Heart Lyrics  Do you believe in love at first sight  I know it is true now cuz it happened that night  But now you, slip away  Don't believe me, when I say  When you hold my hand you hold my heart  But lately we still drift apart  When I say I love you I mean it  When I say I love you I mean it  I mean it  Do you believe that we're meant to be  I know it's true now but you just don't see  Cuz now, you get scared  Don't believe me, but it's there  When you hold my hand you hold my heart  But lately we still drift apart  When I say I love you I mean it  When I say I love you I mean it  I mean it  Please believe me when I say  I'll love you till the end  forever and a day  When you hold my hand you hold my heart  But lately we still drift apart  When I say I love you I mean it  When I say I love you I mean it  I mean it  I mean it

      Fall Lyrics  You were the question I need an answer You'd never know how scared I was Falling in love  You would talk softly You are a riddle And I felt so innocent standing in your eyes  So hear me now I'll scream out loud Can't figure out  how you entered into my world And I fall down  You are the vision I'm always seeing  Oh. And being alone right there with you Left me satisfied You're all I need in life  So hear me now I'll scream out loud Can't figure out How you entered into my world And I fall down  And I fall down. Oh.  And now what can I say I'm so far away waiting for the day when  I'll be standing in your eyes In your eyes  So hear me now i'll scream out loud can't figure out how you entered into my world And I fall down Ooooh. And I fall.

      Ok aside from my to be or not to be arguement I thought i would talk about a few things. In jon's entries he talked mostly about my last few entrys on Alex and French and such. LOL he said Alex is a catch, I don't know how he got that cause I havnt really caught him, he is more or less an aquantic that i happen to have a huge crush on lol who wont do anythign with me and never has anythign to talk about but hes so ... DIFFERENT! god. Everytime I turn around I see him. He's everywhere. Sometimes I'm looking for him sometimes he;s just standing right in front of me and he has this glow about him... and we were practising our french play acouple of days ago .. which by the way we presented today and i sucked but I was watching alex with his group and i got so caught up in it that .... the people in my group had to yell at me to get me to pay attention ... its like from a movie.... and I'm sure I've freaked him out.. but i just cant stop! i wish he would notice me the same way. I doubt he even thinks about me too much. Anyway not much else is knew...  I'm probably going to get guitar lessons over the summer .... umm what else.... I have a million guys who "love me" that I am sick of and probably 4 guys that want to date me this weekend and do something none of which are Alex and i offically hate guys lol not really but most of them.... anyway mom yelled at me last night and I'm being stalked by a guy who wants me to join his church. besides that ...  oh wait! jon wanted to know about Dallas... we are still talking.... and some what friends... I never have anything to say and lately hes been pretty quiet too.... i still need my cd from him.. i guess thats it... have a good night everyone.... I'll leave u some lyrics of a song I'm working on

      The oh so famous line, "To be? or Not to be? It has been haunting me for the past weeks. I'm sure it just popped in to shakspears head for a second and it has lived on for centuary's ever since, but I'm stupped? What is to be or not to be these days. There is nothing to be to become or Something not to be to not become. I know I'm confusing at this moment so here is my exsplination. If we spend our whole lives going to school, for what?  to get good grades, for what? to get good money, for what? for a good job that pays you a whole lot so you can feed yourself, or your family, or just pay for the house that you bought and we all work for one big group called society that always some how screws us over and we work our whole lives just for that. Nothing more. We just build brains and run around and act stupid. So we are supperior beings? Thats all we do! There is no life to it. SO what are we becoming, what is to be? what is not to be? what is wrong and what is right. It's all symbols of things we make up and give them meaning so we can believe in something, other then running around and going to shool and work and trying to be rich. The cross, Police badges, THe peace symbol they are just shapes and lines and we just give them meaning? Love? what is up with all of it? To be or not to be? How can that be a question!?

      Alex and I never did anything on friday but we talked today and he basically said we should maybe not pressure it so much on doing something and just kind of talk in the hallways or whatever and get to know eachother so I'm ok with that. He's saying hi to me more often now anyway and i get to see him smile more which is great.   I find myself getting laughed at in french often now because I can't read french very well and I have a play that we are presenting tomorrow and I'm going to suck crap. *sigh* People can be so judging.  Not much else is knew everything is back to normal... Aside from all the guys still after me. but I'm not as busy with school and I have a few people tot alk to anyway. I also have been doing a great job with my guitar playing. I'm getting better day by day. it's quite exsiting. Just wait till i get guitar lessons! :)

      Not much of a talker lately... I'm just very mad at the world right now and i've been going through a lot. Alex and I have been talking more and thats cool. He's part of the rock climbing club! which is cool... I was going to sign up but I'm just too busy ... but I like learning about him. I think hes more been into approching me then I have him lately I'm still pretty shy around him and i cant really .. say much .. just because Im not much of a talker but he seems to not mind. I got into a conversation about my family situations.. I didnt tell him anything but i just kind of let him know there was something going on and he seemed to understand totally and know what solitude is sometimes the best way to go.... that was quite satisfing.... finally someone who understands..... I think my leap of faith has done me good

      I had a great day yesterday who said the world doesnt change? cause it does.. Most of the day was average but I felt so great .. so ready for anything coming my way and I was just all smiles and hugs ... and at the very end of the day ... alex starts talking to me and I walk him to his locker and we talk about music ... and blues and doucumentrys and life... how our opinions are slightly different even tho we agree on the same types of things...  and he talked about walking together but we went different ways ... so .. i missed out but he made my day that much better... he smiles at me alot more now... and we just have so much in commun that its hard not to like him and feel for him. I still hope that some how I enter his mind .. every once and awhile ... maybe deep down inside he has feeling for me too.. thats just a dream tho... Hes probably shy who knows... anyway today was slightly different still a good day and alex smelled better then ever lol but i found that most people i can consider my friends arent really my friends and the ones i see and the people i hate can be there for me.. but only if i look at them as goddesses ... My stalker is still bugging me ...ALOT he keeps telling me to call and such and i have an essay to write on thursday and a project to do .. *sigh* anyway my friend matt is upset cause im ignoring him over my beloved journal so im off to entertain .... oh ps.!!! i had a dream about Kevin!! u know grad kevin.. the one i went to grade 9 grade with.... we were dating in my dream... and today he came up to talk to me and all i could .... think of was the dream... i thought it was weird.. I dunno what to think... i do like him .. i have feelings for kevin .. but hes shy and i dunno... I miss talking to him tho... he so busy .... anyway goodnight ... tomorrow better be a good day! *thinks of alex* i think it will :)

I was so upset I skipped choir.... he didnt show up the next day...   to cure myself of hate and discust for every guy that has ever dismissed me for anything... which is alot ... i went to the movies alone by myself at chinook.... as im going up the stairs this guy comes up to me and starts talking to me... hes black and african just like  my dear mr. stalker and basically he asks me out and for my # and email and such.. being the nice person i am i gave him my email and such  but i really dont know this guy and hes somewhat hard to understand when he calls i hope my mom doesnt think hes the stalker...   i met this new guy named jesse who lives in st. albert alberta... we are kinda hitting it off and he seems to be alot like me... which is good.. once again distance plays a factor but im glad i met him...

      Alex got a hair cut... he looks like my friend Leon from Aussi. He looks good but I'm totally pissed about how he treated me. He never says hi, no smile, nothing... I think I should forget about him.. He's missin out anyway.   New Attraction. This guy named jesse that i talked about at the end of my last entry. He is totally amazing. Wow. I'm a lose of words just thinking about him. He lives in St. Albert though. Which is crap. Every good guy I meet is always somewhere else. But hes not that far. I can't wait till I can drive. I need to get richer first though.   Also like I said I went to my sisters house for the last 4 days for spring break. It was ok, busy and tiring... I got myself a few fossels in Jasper though. Found em myself:D lol. and there was one point where we were walking by a huge steep rock clif thing and there were all of these mountain goats huddled over us never taking their eyes off of us ( my brother Cindy and I) it was amazing. I'll never forget that. S  Sorry I don't have much else to say besides that. I'm pretty tired so... whatcha gunna do ... anyway have a good night everyone even though no one reads this

      It's been brought to my attention by a certain someone *cough* Jesse *cough* that I have been failing to add to my journal entry's which sounds like something I would do in the most desperate times when I need to write down my thoughts and opinions and how incredibly stupid the world is. I'm sitting here eating chocolate icecream, going over every event that has happened since my last entry and I can't even think of how to write it all down. My world inside myself is crashing. That's what is happening... Everything I have believed .. That makes me the most special person has been destroyed and I haven't said a single word about how I feel to anyone. Last weekend my stalker asked me to go out with him and he was thinking about marrying me in the future that all in itself scared me half to death, he talked about how I was everything to him but I don't feel like I'm everything to anyone. I don't even feel everything myself. I don't want to get deep into the stalker thing. It doesn't matter anymore, I haven't seen him and the worst has been done. .... But there is something he said that stopped me right in my tracts and that would be when he told me that I was quiet and slow moving and very observant and not like other people. That in itself is fine but he got into the fact that I'm secretive, I seem to hide things and he took advantage of that and told me not to say a thing to my mom.... Just because I'm quiet does not mean I am unsure of myself... It does not mean I cant take care of myself. My mom accused me of lying when I asked her to go to the mall alone by myself as usual to see a movie. Because of what Obnes said. I don't get this. I really don't .. I feel alone... Without being alone and sometimes that's the best thing I can be. I don't make a good talky person.   my French teacher told me today that my French needs work I need to practice more.. I need to talk more.... But to who.... People don't talk to me... Not in French class.... They don't even smile ... I sit next to no one... In my French class.. And no one sits next to me. No one says good job ... And no one trys to help.   I found out I'm failing social today and ... Everything is just down the hole... I feel like crap... Band used to be so great for me and now I'm second place next to some chick who needs to be self centered about everything. She got lessons.. I didn't so what... My band teacher doesn't even give me a chance...   I spend hours doing homework.. Being yelled at because I refuse to make time to hang out with people... That I really don't like anyway ...  And I work my ass off..... And at the end of the day I look to see what I have accomplished ... And there is nothing... I don't see anything and I feel so sad ...  I'm failing because I see another part of life... And the world.. That most people just don't relate to.... There is no room for dreamers ... In the world.... Its like Einstein ... He said imagination is the greatest thing u could ever have .. And we think hes all wise for it .. But we didn't take that information from him.. We took his formulas... And his smarts... But we never stopped to look at ourselves......   *sigh* I need a hug:(

      Sometimes I feel there's a hole inside me an emptiness that, at times seems to burn. I think if you lifted my heart to your ear, probably you could hear the ocean. And the moon tonight, there's a circle around it. A sign of trouble not far behind. I have this dream of being whole. Of not going to sleep each night, wanting. But still, sometimes when the wind is warm or the crickets sing Idream of a love that even time will lie down and be still for. I just want someone to love me. I want to be seen. I don't know. Maybe I've had my happiness. I don't want to believe it but there is no man, only that moon.

      I know I havn't added for awhile but who cares really... A lot has happened... not much i really feel like talking about ..... I'm just alone, sad and lost. I've been blind folded and tied up from everything around me and I prety much did it to myself. I need someone to care I need someone to talk to me I need someone to call I need to find myself I need a friend I need better marks in school I need to not be judged........ I need to stop dreaming ....

      Through the past few days I've begun to think about something that plays a big part on me as a whole. I have found myself more attracted to people older then me for too many reasons at one time. I've learned a lot about myself and these things are a problem and not accepted in society. It's not right of a girl my age to even be interested or try to even get someone's attention that is in his 20s' and as much as I'm the same as older guys we have a very different life style and experience. Something I must learn to get around. I also have realized I have been spoiled. I'm used to having guys want me so badly due to lust, I never have had an opportune time to find someone I truly desire and at the moment where I think I have, I am having to wait for a chance. This time no one is leaping into my arms and I feel disappointed and I shouldn't be. I also have come to the conclusion that my being younger can change things quickly when other people find out and because I grew up around older people its no surprise when I see myself hugging someone bigger then me, but I sometimes wonder what it would be like to be holding someone younger then you and feeling a connection other then family. Maybe I should let this go for a bit. I can't change but I will help others that way.

      OK long time no entry, this would probably be the longest I have put off writing. I've been through crazy things in this past month and I really have a lot to say so I may as well start and hold off the excuses cause really no one reads this but hey I get the occasional visitors.   Once June hit I was basically on top of the world, almost, literally floating, busy, but floating, a little nervous, but flouting. School was almost out, The sky's were blue, my heads in the clouds (as usual) and it seems like nothing could go wrong. The bus pass was green for god sakes, my favorite color, sorry to be superstitious, but come on everything was going my way. But as we all know, with the good comes the bad and that's surely what happened. You see I had met a guy named Steve not to much before I had written my last entry and he was everything I had been hoping for and that's exactly what I got, it just wasn't what I wanted. Totally a contradicting sentence, but you'll see what I mean. The day Steve and I got together I had this magical hope in my heart and mind, that this would be just like everyone else, with every other guy I have met and this time I would like the guy in return, but I was blind. We some what hit it off, but not. You see I was trying to get closer to Steve and he was being his normal careful self and trying not to push things into a road which should be traveled causiously and those two contradictory characteristics eventually lead to a hot evening where your mind runs away with you and you end up kissing someone when you really shouldn't. That night was odd. Right when I'm up at my peek of greatness, where I practically have the guy I have hoped for, forever was on my shoulders and almost mine, he has to come out and say that it doesn't feel right. Ouch. I was shocked at first, didn't really know what to say. I didn't know if was the kiss or what and I just tried laughing it off, I almost felt it coming, but I was two high on my cloud that I ignored the feeling. I almost felt stupid, for even kissing him and believing that someone this great would just fall into my hands. It had happened to Jon and Jared but not Krissie. I was laughing more so at myself then anything but it hurt all at the same time. I had my hopes up and my heart was torn. I cried that night in his arms and went home choking back the whole day. Feeling as if I should give up. I've let myself down too many times, but as we all know that feeling never stayed around for very long with me. I came back more determined then ever to get him. I thought that no great things in life come easy so I sat on my thrown and fought him, for him lol. I tried to show him how magnificent he was in my eyes but I was running off of fools hope and stubbornness. He was everything wanted but I meant nothing to him in that way and to make this long battle a short story, I dropped the hat and we're best friends now.      You know I almost feel like the girl in Sweet November. I seem to have a new guy every month now. I met this guy named Ryan a few weeks ago, different Ryan then the one that left for Europe a few months ago, who by the way got back and realized he didn't like me anymore. But this Ryan is cool. He is 19 and is a soccer ref., he lives in the south and works at radio shack down in the south also. H's quite smart and seems fun. I talked to him on  the phone for a few hours last night before my mom almost killed me.. Not literally but yah. Anyway, it was fun, we talked about nothing and a lot all at the same time. Mostly the world as a whole and death and religion and life. He makes models of cars and other things. I've never seen them but I presume he's pretty good at it. He's very sweet, he must have my number written down somewhere good cause every time I call and he's busy he calls me right back just to talk. I'm not pushing it this time though, I'm going to take my time on this and see what happens. If steve's taught me anything, it would be take my time.     On another note. I don't really feel like talking much about this one, but the end of the year finished off great except for me failing social and having my science teacher basically threaten me and tell me that I will not pass Bio next year.      Also summer school, through all July I'll be talking summer school for pure Math 10, and I'm planning to get a good grade. My teacher is awesome and I feel really smart in the class lol. I get to sit under and Einstein poster, he's always been on my side; even at his state (dead as a door nail) lol      One more thing before I leave this journal entry for the sake that my creativity is drained and my headaches are starting up again. Dad called today hoping to get together and as mad as at I am at him for obvious reasons, I was quite glad to hear his voice and I really wouldn't mind seeing him this summer.     anyway that is that. I'm kind of tired.. But that was June and the beginning of July for me. Feel free to add comments if anyone is going to read this and has anything to say. I'm off to feed my cat and bird, sleep and dream. Afterall it's what I do best.
