      You know what's dumb? Anarchy! I have to make the distinction between "cool" and "dumb".  They are entirely different things, but usually go hand in hand.  An excellent example of this is smoking; you look cool, but you're dumb and you should be shot repeatedly in the face.  But I digress.  For the less informed out there, anarchy is when you want to overthrow the government.  This has to be one of the most ill-formed plans, because it caves in on itself under the slightest scrutiny.  Only angry teenagers or criminals hate the government, and that's because they suck at life and should be euthanized.  I heard something about anarchists wanting to create a peaceful co-op or some crap like that.  And what would you do with the idiots who wanted to rebel against your government? Oh shit! You're dumb!  If you don't like the government in general, go shoot yourself.  If you have specific complaints, go change the government and quit bitching.  So instead of trying to overthrow the government, here's a better idea.  Get down on your knees and worship me as your god. Now. I was asked to write about this by Stevie, who wholehearted agrees with everything stated here.  If you don't, feel free to reply so I can insult and humiliate you publicly.

      My humour is the best.  Nothing is better than insulting people, because despite how hard we try otherwise, we still like seeing other people in pain.  When I tell someone to go die, I may or may not mean it; but the effect is the same.  It demoralizes them, and come on, seeing someone crushed is hilarious. Another type of humour that is vastly misunderstood is corny humour.  It in itself provokes more of a "hang your head in shame" reaction, but its true humour lies elsewhere.  When someone says a corny joke and someone else finds it genuinely funny, that is when you really laugh; not at the joke, but at the idiot who has such a rudimentary grasp of comedy.

      Well, I've just entered the world of blogging.  I'm not sure if I'm going to be the best of bloggers, but anything can happen!  Also, those of you who don't know me, I may seem egotistical, however that's just my sense of humour.  So, I believe I will make my blog about random rants about anything, because I usually don't rant.  This will be my place to criticize anything and everything.  Feel free to add any comments on my opinion, as long as they don't contradict it.  On a side note, I pride myself in not making any spelling mistakes and using a more varied vocabulary.  If you spot any mistakes let me know.
