                    Woke up much earlier then I wanted to Karissa came into my room with grandma and played hide and seek with the door.  I was putting my arm out the door around the corner and trying to get her and she thought that was pretty funny.   Grandma got Karissa strawberries and yogurt for breakfast.  I have never seen anyone eat as many strawberries as Karissa can .    Today we went to the space needle.  Karissa said she really wanted to go up in the space needle so we went.  They have really changed the space needle since I went in it last.  We had our picture taken as we went in kind of like they do at Disneyland.  I held her in my arms all the way up in the elevator and she really liked looking out the window.  Once we got up in the space needle I was shocked at all that has changed.  I used to bring first dates to the space needle but now it is a complete tourist trap with a starbucks in it.  Karissa and I went out on the observation deck on the outside.  She like looking around but once we were up in it she was done.  We then went down and they drop us off in the gift shop.  We bought the picture.  Karissa really likes the picture so I got her one.  After we were done She wanted to ride the rides.  It was sure cold maybe it is me I am after all from Texas now but Karissa rode the kiddie rides and loved it.  She also wanted to go up in the ferris wheel with me.  I took her up there and she really enjoyed that smiled ear to ear.  She was even more crabby at bedtime about brushing her teeth.  I just don’t understand what happened she used to like brushing her teeth.

                    After driving 40 hours I arrived at my parents house.  I have had 2 hours of sleep in 40 hours so I am a bit tired.  It is 0530 my stepdad just left for work I am going to go sleep on the couch for a few hours as I am going to pick Karissa up later.  Picked Karissa up and left about 12-1 after dropping off toys at the house Lisa is staying at.  I actually met Karissa at the Drs. Office in Kirkland because Aunt Lisa had to take one of her kids to the Dr. and she is watching Karissa because my ex had a job interview this morning.  The look on Karissa’s face was wonderful.  I had a hard time holding back my tears.  She came out of the office and Karissa did not recognize me at first.  Then Aunt Lisa said Karissa who is that?  Karissa looked at me and her eyes got as big as plates, she took a deep breath and came running into my arms yelling “daddy”   I had to peel Karissa off me so I could walk.  Man she is so beautiful.  We spent the day in kind of a lazy mode I am bushed that ride took a lot out of me.  Karissa and I went to the store and did some shopping picked up some snacks and stuff.  Today was kind of shot for things to do as picking her up really took much longer then I wanted.  I met Lisa tonight for a couple of drinks and I thought we had a somewhat normal conversation.  Seeing her was difficult for me I know the things she has done but I care for her still.  I had to tell myself there is nothing here anymore.  She told me about how she is thinking about coming back to Houston.  She told me about how she is not happy at her brothers.  She said she will talk to the kids and let me know.  She said it is not fair to keep Karissa from her daddy.  The boys are used to it but Karissa is not.  I hope that happens.  I am excited to see Karissa and it would be cool to have her back in Houston  A couple of times today I did notice that Karissa does not talk to people or ignores them when you ask her to do things.  Like her crayons she spilled them on the floor and I asked her to help me pick them up and she refused.  In addition brushing her teeth at bedtime was a Major Chore.  This did not used to be the case.

                    Today Karissa woke up kind of cranky.  Not much I can afford to do today so we went to Wal-mart with Grandma.  Tara called while I was at Wal-mart and asked us if we wanted to come over and swim in her indoor pool at the apartment.   I bought a new floating swim suit for Karissa and a pair of trunks for me so we could go swimming.  She is really excited.    We met Tara and got in the pool.  Karissa had a great time she loves to swim glad to see she still does that.  I had her jumping off the edge and into the water with me.  I could not get her to do that before.    Afterwards we had dinner with Tara and Karissa fell asleep on Tara’s Lap.  I took her home.  It is kind of early so I put her to bed and went out with a friend to a later dinner at Red Robin.  My mother called me while I was at the movie Theater with my friend Kristen and said Karissa was quite warm.  I told Kristen that we would have to catch up later and I had to go.  On the way home I bought some medicine for Karissa.  When I got home I gave her some of the medicine it was quite a chore.  That did not used to be a problem either.  Putting up such a fight over the medicine woke her up so we were up late watching movies.

                    Well I am pretty much tapped on my funds so we went to the mall and just walked around went around to the shops looking and stuff.  Karissa got a new care bear backpack in the shape of a care bear she showed everyone in the mall I think.  We spent time in the book store looking at books.    After a few hours of that we went back to Grandma’s and Grandpa’s.  Karissa wanted a ride in the riding mower.  I got the mower out and Karissa and I mowed the lawn and rode on the mower.    Grandpa went to Pizza with us.  Karissa really wanted pizza for dinner no coaching from me even!  We went to alfy’s pizza and they have video games the kids can play.  She got to play the video games (nintendo’s) and although she could not really play the games well she had fun and that is all that matters.

                    Today we went to the zoo I told Karissa we would go to the zoo about 3 weeks ago and we went today.  She had a pretty good time we checked out the many animals at the zoo.  She really liked the otters and the bears.  Karissa wanted to see the tigers and they did not have any I cannot tell you disappointed she was but she told me she was going to get a tiger someday because I told her tigers were her daddy’s favorite.  Well I saved the day I found a stuffed baby tiger in the gift shop for her.  This is her stuffed animal of the day now.  It had a tiger striped leash or whatever that I bought as well.    We then went and met my friend Tara for lunch I have not seen Tara since shortly after Lisa and I met.  Karissa liked Tara a lot.  Tara invited us over for Dinner.  Karissa and I stopped at Mcdonalds on the way home.  I let her play in the play area for probably 90 minutes.  She was having a real good time.    Went to Tara’s and we had spaghetti for dinner and watched Harry Potter.  Tara’s son had a couple of Hamsters and now Karissa wants a couple.  Karissa fell asleep on the way home in the car.

                    Today Karissa came in and tackled me while I was sleeping.  I heard her come on but she was trying to scare me so I let her.    My money is running low so we got a bunch of old bread and even stopped at the store for another loaf and went to the waterfront in Everett.  Karissa and I spent about an hour feeding the seagulls.  She loved the birds and loved how they would pretty much follow her for bread.    I took Karissa to the marina to walk the marina after feeding the birds and she enjoyed the walk. It started to rain a little so we cut our walk short and went into one of the stores to get out of the rain.  Karissa wanted to have Ice cream so I got her some bubble gum ice cream.  I got a great picture of her blue face.    We went to the park luckily the sun came out it was still cool but the sun helped.  She ran around the park and played on the toys.  She had me spin her on the merry go around.  I can tell you I felt sick with all the spinning.  I am not sure how I used to do it.  Bedtime is the way it has been all week.  Nothing but one big issue.

                    Today was a pretty slow day I woke up before Karissa.  She ate strawberries and toast this time.  We decided that Sunday, today, we would hang out and go to a movie later.  Karissa picked “Home on the Range”.  The movie was funny and Karissa even laughed when the audience laughed at stuff.  She is developing a sense of humor and hearing her laugh and stuff was good.  Grandma promised her macaroni and cheese for dinner so she was eager to get home.    I had to go to the store and Karissa did not want to go.  I asked her if she wanted to and she said no she was watching a care bear movie with grandma.  I started to leave to go to the store and Karissa asked me if I was coming back.  I said yes I was coming home and she said whose home?  “My home in WA or my home in TX?”  I did my best to assure her I was coming back to Grandma’s and she seemed worried but eventually let me go.  While Grandma was making mac and cheese, home made, Karissa and I played with the neighbor’s son Adam.  He has grown a lot since I saw him.  Karissa really likes Adam they ran around the yard her chasing him.  They had a really good time.    Seems like bedtime is a real issue for Karissa lately.  I am not sure why but she does not want to brush her teeth.  She won’t go to bed without someone there.  I had her going to bed without someone in the room and now she is back to needing someone.

                    I just spent the last couple of weeks with my daughter and after not being with her for 3 months it was great to see her.  She was so awesome we had a great time going to the park, going to the zoo, we went up in the Seattle space needle and much more.    I had to drive 2500 miles to see her and to give my Ex-wife the mustang.  I am now a single guy stuck with a minivan!  The drive back was not as bad as the drive up the mustang although a cool car was not desinged for cross country travel.     Here is the trip I took to and from.  On the way up I traveled by myself I stopped for 2 hours and slept in a truck stop.  It took a total of 40 hours to get from my home in Houston, TX to my parents house in Lake Stevens, WA   On the way back my aunt came with me as she wanted to see Houston.  The trip back only took 35 hours! Not sure why the time difference but whatever.   Leaving my daughter was very hard for me it is one of the hardest things I have had to do in my life.  I did not want to go but I did my best to keep my composure and move on.     I am going to do my best to put something on these blogs daily if for no other reason then just to say I did it.

                    Well today is the day I have to leave.  It is going to be hard.  The drive is about 40 hours back.  I want to keep Karissa but I don’t want to go to jail.  We took pictures of Karissa loaded the many things in the car.  Well I made it back to Houston it is actually the 25th of April but I had to finish the entry.    I dropped Karissa off at her aunt and uncles with Lisa.  I wanted to see Jimmy and Jeremey but Lisa said they had testing and cannot stay home.  I think she just did not want me to talk to them.  I hugged Karissa.  It was so hard to leave.  I left crying I held it as much as I could but it was hard to leave her we had such a good time.  This is so wrong!  Karissa should not have to split time with her mommy and daddy.  But Lisa wants it this way so what am I to do?

                    So I called Karissa today and I get to talk to the   X   and she starts in on my with her bunch of BS!  Things like how she does not have any child support money and stuff like that.  I simply told her I paid the state and if she does not like it then that is her problem.  Then she says to me "well how do I get it then" like it is my job to tech support her ass through child support retrieval.  Well as our conversation goes on she makes some comment like "maybe you should have tried harder" or some such BS on of her famous tag lines.  In the background I get to hear Karissa echo  "Yeah daddy maybe you should have tried harder"  Maybe it is me but if I am not mistaken right then and their Lisa is commiting another act of contempt.  Carrying on this discussion in front of Karissa.   I know this woman is doing everything she can to run me out of my daughters life.  It is only a matter of time before her psychotic ass snaps and does who knows what kind of harm to my little girl.  Meanwhile the court just lets shit slide like its cool.    If I did have the stuff this woman has I would be the reenactment of OJ in the white for Bronco but not mother of the year!!

                    Well needless to say I am now sunburned and sore.  Actually my heal is in pain from all the walking.  We went to west Texas today "The Hill Country" and hiked in a couple of miles on this trail to some waterfalls.  There my roommate, his girl friend, and her 2 little girls, a friend of my roommates and I hung out for the day picnicing and playing in the river.  It looked like it was going to be kind of a crappy day but turned out quite nice.  I called Karissa from the river but she had just gotten to the park and did not want to talk.  Which was probably OK I did not have that great of a signal.  Well time came we hiked out and we were going to watch the bats come out from under Congress Bridge in Austin but the kids were zonked in the car and we had about an hour to wait for dark so we opted to leave.  Ran out of gas on the way back.  Roomie and his GF hiked to the gas station.  I fed the kids, as they had woken up, and awaited their return.  I called Karissa again.  Things were pretty loud sounded like there was a party of some kind.  I can only assume that the party was for my   X  .  Needless to say Karissa did not want to talk and when she did she did not say much.  I would say &quot;were you at the park today?&quot; and all I got was a no or nothing so it was time to let her go.  I wanted to tell her about my day.  How fun it was for 2 reasons:  1.  I did have fun 2.  I guess deep down I wanted her to think daddy's house was fun to.

                    Well I did not put a post out yesterday as I was swamped with other things and Karissa chose not to talk to me.  According to the   X   Karissa was cranky and having a bad hair day.  What probably happened was that the   X   had a big night planned with her boyfriend and was trying to get Karissa to bed early.   I say that because yesterday was the   X's   birthday!  So today I called and did not get to talk to Karissa much she was busy watching cartoons and eating pickles so needless to say daddy was not a person of interest today.  Much to my dismay my   X   was available (I was hoping she would have choked on her birthday cake) which I must say anymore is really a disappointment anytime I call!

                    The last couple of days I have called in a con-call and had Karissa talk to aunts and uncles and gma's and gpa's.     Well today the   X   says to me &quot;So you don't have the presidential conference calling today?&quot;    &quot;I said no it is just me! Why do you have a problem with me letting Karissa talk to her family?&quot;   She then says &quot;no I think it can overwhelm Karissa.&quot;   I replied &quot;if you would call her family and let her talk to them I would not have to!&quot;   She then says &quot;if it is your family that is one thing but it is different when you get my brother and his wife involved!&quot;   I finished that line of discussion with &quot;well I did not hear your brother or his wife complaining considering they wanted to talk to Karissa and you don't call them either!  In addition I am an adult and no one will tell me what to do!&quot; As you recall that last part is the   X's   new motto so I got a great big &quot;OH I SEE HOW IT IS!! Well I will keep that in mind!&quot;  So today when I talked to Karissa she was in the tub.  She told me about how she had found more worms.  Then she had also found a frog and some tadpoles.  I told her that the tadpoles were baby frogs and would grow legs and become frogs and that excited her a lot.  She asked me if I wanted to come see them which of course I said yes!   We exchange our hugs and kisses and loves over the phone and then I got to talk to the   X   some more!!  The second half of our discussion went well with the possibility of having Karissa come to Texas for 3 weeks being possible.  She even said to me at some point &quot;I know you think I am a cunt!&quot; Of course I let the silence hang for a minute and then said &quot;well anyway&quot;      These were mails I received from some really good friends I like a lot and these are such great e-mails I posted them.   urlLink Wise Advice many can use   urlLink Rolling 9-11    Photos on this page are large intentionally to preserve the formatting.

                      This is for Humor!  No this is not a true tale but it certianly could be!               I never quite figured out why the sexual urges of men and              women differ so much.  And I never figured out the whole             Venus and Mars thing. I have never figured out why men              think with their head and women think with their heart.              I have never figured out why the sexual desire gene gets             thrown into a state of turmoil, when it hears the words "I do"        FOR EXAMPLE:        One evening last week, my wife and I were getting into bed. Well, the passion starts to heat up, and she eventually says "I don't feel like it, I just want you to hold me."   I said "WHAT???!!! What was that?!"    So she says the words that every husband on the planet dreads to hear..."You're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man."   She responded to my puzzled look by saying, "Can't you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?"    Realizing that nothing was going to happen that night I went to sleep.     The very next day I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, big unnamed department store.  I walked around with her while she tried on several different very expensive outfits. She couldn't decide which one to take so I told her we'll just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so I said lets get a pair for each outfit. We went to the jewelry department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings.    Let me tell you, she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a shipwreck.   I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to play tennis.    I think I threw her for a loop when I said, "That's fine, honey."    She was almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement.     Smiling with excited anticipation she finally said, "I think this is all I need dear, let's go to the cashier." I could hardly contain myself when I blurt out, "No honey, I don't feel like it."    Her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled "WHAT??!!!"   I then said "Really honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while. You're just not in touch with my financial needs as a man enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman."    And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me I added, why can't you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?"     Author Unknown

                    Well today I found out that the finance company that keeps calling, regarding the vehicle my ex has not paid for, can be fined up to $500 a count for harassing phone calls.  Since they are not supposed to call more then once a day (they are averaging 3-4) and have the information to get in touch with my ex, I may just start keeping track and put a trace on the line and then sue them for the inconvenience. Might as well get a couple of bucks out of them.  Called Karissa today and had my Aunt on the phone Karissa really likes talking to Aunt.  She talked for a bit then she accidently hung up the phone but it was OK I had to go to work and Aunt (Karissa's name for her) had to go to a dinner function.  I called her back to tell her how much I miss her and love her.  She told me how her and her brothers were out catching worms and she had hundreds and she named them all Arial.  She was eating cake and Ice cream my ex's Birthday is this week and they were celebrating it today. She is going to use them to go fishing.    I got to hear a hello from Jimmy and Jeremey as well.  It was good to at least hear them.  I miss them too but I am not supposed to care about them they are not my concern...thank Lisa for that one.

                    Well now I am going to get serious about this.    My ex has been removed from her location in Seattle and has moved to a boyfriends house in Michigan. Of course she still blames me and now her sister-in-law for the misfortunes in her life!  Of course the finger of blame never points at herself.   Maybe the saying when you point the finger at someone there are 3 fingers pointing back applies in this case.  I called my daughter today and had a con-call going with her Aunt and Uncle. The call did not last very long Karissa I think had issues with the aunt and uncle being on the phone and it made her sad.  Of course she handed the phone to her mommy and Mommy would not talk to anyone.  She is a big girl these days and does not like conflict.  Of course she spends a lot of time creating conflict so I am not sure where that bunch of BS came from.

                    You know I am starting to wonder if Lisa is coaching Karissa into asking me if I have someone on the phone.  For the last 3 days or so I call and the first words out of Karissa's mouth are "who is on the phone with you daddy?"   Not Hello Not Hi Not how are you?  Given the e-mail exchange that took place the other day after her phone call ordering me not to allow her family to talk to Karissa or she would hang up on me the increase in interest seems a little fishy to me.  So after I told Karissa it was just daddy she started making noise in the phone like yelling noises and stuff.  Then she must have handed the phone to Lisa as I heard Lisa say "I don't want it you take it" then I hear stomping feet and Karissa says "I don't want to talk anymore daddy"  She gives me the usual hugs and kisses thing then hangs up on me.

                    Well once again Karissa came running to the phone said she was tired from running.  Then she asked me if I had anyone on the phone.  I told her I did not and once again was ignored.  In fact I was so ignored that Karissa was more interested in the dog crap on the bottom of her shoes that she decided to talk to her mommy about that instead.    I just love the way mommy encourages her to talk to her daddy.  She never says you can play with that after you are done talking to your daddy.  Never encourages dialogue of any kind just stands next to her and lets her put the phone on the computer piano or something and ignore me.    I hope she gets to experience that feeling someday!!

Karissa said she was sick and not feeling good so she did not want to talk.  I told her good bye and wished her my love and how much I missed her and let her go.

                    After todays exchange with the   X   she will no longer be referred to as   X  .  From now on she will be   Stupid Fucking Whore   or   SFW   for short.    This woman calls me up asks me for a favor then has the nerve to call back and threaten me with visitation of my daughter.  Keep in mind she is in contempt of court for so many things at this point and she wants to act like she is going to hold me to the court order.  On top of that during our discussion I pointed out to her that we had joint custody and she actually says no we don't I have Karissa therefore I have custody.    Someone needs to put this woman in her place and with gods help I will do just that!

                    Once again I talked to Karissa and being sick that took a lot of work.  Someone got Karissa one of those piano keyboards or something, she calls it her "computer".  For 2 days now I have been unable to really talk to her because she puts the phone on the speaker and then just lets it play.  I tried to tell her I liked her singing but daddy did not call to listen to the computer.  But that does not matter.  Plus the   X   does nothing to help the cause by asking her to put it up and talk to me.    Some days I wonder what is the point.  I know Karissa is 4 but it makes me feel like I am less important then an electronic keyboard, in this case, when it was not the keyboard it was something else.  The   X   calls and says you don't have any record of paying your child support so my attorney says you have to talk to your attorney.  I said I have already done that provided all paperwork necessary so if your attorney cannot find it from there then that is not my issue.  Man I tell you the   X   has some nerve she calls here telling me to not give out thier home number.  I am like you know what when collectors call here they get your number if you don't like it pay your bills.  I will hand out the number to anyone trying to get a hold of you.  She says well I don't appreciate the things you do...I said well I don't appreciate the things you do either so we are even.    That is the end of this discussion!  ****the line goes dead****

                    Well I got a hold of Karissa this afternoon and she was feeling better we got to talk for a few minutes before I started work.  She spent a lot of the phone call playing some music thing and singing along with it.  Although it was cute it made it hard to talk to her.

                    Went out last night had a good time with friends.  Even went so far as to run through the sprinklers (they live on a golf course) at 1 in the morning on the 14th hole of a local golf course.  I called Karissa this morning and apparently she "ate too much fruit" and is having a tummy ache this morning.  So much so that she did not say much to me at all but had enough time to hang up on me 2 times in less then 5 minutes.  I would not be suprised if the   X   taught her that one.  Of course she will deny it but how do I know anyway.  The   X   has proven she is not above being a   LIAR   too.  I know some would say that this statement could be classified as libel.  However, since I have proof of her being with other men after she said she was not. Since she has openly admitted going to Michigan after saying she was in AZ when she left here obviously that was a lie so if she should ever happen to see this then she can be comforted in knowing that everything that has been stated here is true and just to the best of my knowledge!  I will try Karissa later.  I am sure it will meet with the same results. I think I am just a voice on the phone anymore.

                    Man the feet hurt today.  I feel a little beat up actually.  Karissa really did not have much to say to me again today.  She talked about a little lady bug she had caught and then it got away and she was not longer interested in talking.  in fact I would say she got beligerent but not in a bad way just simply that I could not talk to her as she was being loud and not talking anymore.  She gave me hugs and kisses, told me she missed me and gave the phone back to her mommy.    I hung up and that was that.

                    Well after a meeting today I have to admit I was feeling up for a little bit.  I tried to call Karissa but apparently she was having an attitude and did not want to talk to me.    I tried 3 more times.  On the last try I got Karissa on the phone she said "Hi Daddy I don't want to talk to you right now" and hung up the phone.  Jeremey called back and gave the phone to Karissa.  She did not even say anything that time she just hung up.  It is good to see Lisa has taught Karissa well when it comes to phone etiquette.  If you can't get your way on the phone just hang up on them.

                    Somedays I have real issues with this divorce process today is one of those.  I called Karissa as I do everyday and tried to have a good conversation like I did yesterday.  Instead what I got was I don't want to talk daddy.  Of course I get my hugs and kisses and she says I love you and I miss you.  Although I feel those things passionately myself I feel as though Karissa is just saying them.  When I tried to get her to talk to me longer she just hung up on me.  I did not hear Lisa in the background I can only assume she was there or if not she was out, probably in search of her next victim.  Thanks to that   SFW   I do not get to hug my daughter or show her how much I love her.  To her I am just a voice on the end of the phone.  Meanwhile this   Ass Wipe Jon   gets all my daddy time!  He acts like I am just supposed to like him and trust that he will make the best choice for my daughter.  Meanwhile this is but one of many of the notches on   SFW's   belt.  Why should I trust that a guy who has the moral and ethics to have an affair with a married woman will raise my daughter with values and principles that I feel are appropriate.  In my opinion this guy is no better then   SFW  !   Yet   SFW   and   Ass Wipe Jon   get to have my little girl and raise her. I mean just because I have a penis I have to prove to the court that I can be a worthy parent. Then I get to pay to try to convince the court that she is not the better parent.  I have tried so hard to not hate her or let that come out in my words and discussions with her but then I have days like today and it reminds me how some people deserve a steaming hot cup of hate and I am back here.    This Country is so Fucked up sometimes!

                    My conversation today went better then it normally does with Karissa.  She came to the phone after she told me she was doing her chores.  I think she was helping out with dinner but none the less she was excited to have chores.  Something I am sure will not carry on as she gets older.  :)   So today we talked about how she liked to do chores and how she got a new bed, Lisa must have figured out how to get the child support!  She told me a little about her bed.  She asked me if I wanted to come see it? I replied I would love to come see it someday.  She said I made daddy sad now then decided she did not want to talk anymore.    I coached her into talking by asking her what she wanted to talk about.    She wanted to talk about candy.  She was telling me how she had a watermelon ice cream cone sucker.  She also told me she had candy for dinner.  I certianly hope that was not the case.    She then told me that mommy wanted to talk to me.  Lisa got on the line and asked me when I wanted to get online, in coordination with her, to purchase Karissa's ticket.  She then said let me know when you are ready as I have some other priorities and am waiting for the other child support check.   She then gave Karissa back the phone and Karissa and I said our good buys and I told Karissa next time she comes to daddy's house we would go to the galleria and check out the candy store there.  She was so excited yelled at mommy about how daddy was going to take her to the candy store.  She also thanked me, with her cute "thank you daddy" voice,  for offering to take her and was excited to go.   I hung up with Karissa on a positive note and a longer talk then I have had in about a week.  I found a quote from the bible that I find befitting under my circumstances:   Malachi 4:6 "He will restore the hearts of the fathers to {their}  children and the hearts of the children to their fathers, so that I will not come and smite the land with a curse."

                    Well I talked to Karissa today she was outside in her new slippers.  She was not up to much.  She and I talked for a bit nothing really special again as she won't let me really talk to her anymore.  I did tell her how I liked talking to her and she is my most favorite person to talk to.  I know not the best english but she understands it.  She told me I love you about 10 times and said she missed me then hung up on me.  I was not done with my sentence and she hung up.  I am a little miffed that Lisa cannot take more responsibility in making sure Karissa at least uses proper etiquette when talking on the phone...like not hanging up on people.  I am sure she has seen Lisa do it enough that it is nothing for Karissa to do it and Lisa probably would not even notice it even if she did know it was not appropriate as that is Lisa's way of solving her phone disputes.

                    Well today I con-called Karissa with Grandma and Karissa was very excited at first but she lost interest fast.  It did not help that she needed to go potty in the middle of the call but she took the phone with her to the potty to finish talking.  She ended up hanging up and grandma and I talked.  I had to tear down her swing I felt bad about it but the wood was rotting and it was becoming unsafe so it is the safe thing to do.  I had a line on an above ground pool but that fell through and I was telling my mom about it.  She says she may be able to get one for Karissa for her B-day.  Karissa loves the water and I can get an 18ft pool for $348 so I may put that where the swing set was.    Karissa loves the pool

                    Well todays conversation went pretty dang good.  I called and she was out doing something.  Not sure what but since I got her on the cell phone....  She remembered the pool and asked me about it when I told her I was out working in the yard.  She even told Jeremey that her daddy was getting a pool he remarked that it was just a little kids pool.  Karissa then said shutup Jeremey it is a big pool.  It was pretty funny.  I told her about the best circus on earth coming to town the Ringling Bros. circus and how daddy went to it with his Grandpa when he was a little boy.  She then told everyone how the circus was coming to Houston.    I did have one moment of set back that really infuriated me, at one point Karissa went to ask me a question and said "Uhm Jon I mean Daddy"  That just made me really mad and very jealous but I went on as though nothing had occured.  I have to admit I felt a little guilty as I had to cut down Karissa's swing set today the wood is just getting too rotted and old to let her play on so I figured if I can get rid of it before she comes then she will not remember.  Of course I could be wrong :)  She then asked me to tell her a story.  I started with Once upon a time (Karissa said I have to start that way) there was an evil witch.  I stopped there and said I can't think of anymore but if you have been reading this you know that I had a lot more but could not tell her.  I asked her to tell me a story and she told me about an elephant that was bigger then clifford the big red dog.  She also told me a story about giant bees that would come and eat you.  I added a part about Super Rissa Roo in her pink cape flying down to help me.    She said oh look walkie talkie and pressed the button on the nextel phone and I lost her.  I am half tempted to get a nextel phone just to talk to her with that feature.  I also spent a good portion of the day working outside it was hot but nice as well.  I hung out with Manly from next door.  Manly and his wife Kandy are good people.  Manly and I hung out and had a cook out and BS'ed.   I ran into one of   SFW's   friends at Wal-mart.  She said I looked good with the weight loss and all.  In fact her exact phrase was "where did all of you go?"  It felt good to hear that but I know I am not where I need to be.  She told me how she does not talk to Sarah (another of   SFW's   friends) much and that she felt what Lisa did to me was wrong.  I told her she would get no argument out of me on that.  I saw her new baby something   SFW   can't say and I am sure if she knew she would be pissed off about it.    All in all a relaxing day but a good one as well.

                    Well todays conversation with Karissa really did not go well.  I called the cell phone first and she was somewhere that the signal was real crappy.  It sounded like she wanted to talk but the cell phone signal prevented that.  I then called Karissa at home and at first the conversation seemed like it was going to be good but I could not get Karissa to talk.  I asked her if she wanted me to just hang up and she said no but she would not talk at all.  I think she was in front of the TV.  I tried to get her excited to talk.  I told her how the circus was coming to Houston...Nothing! I told her I sent her something....Nothing!  I finally had to tell her I was going to hang up and still nothing.  Usually she will give me hugs and kisses and then she hangs up first I could not even get that out of her.  All in all I just felt like the call was a waste of time.  I am not sure why but I really feel guilty about things right now with her.  In fact I feel crappy all over.  I just don't want to go do anything.  Maybe it is because it is Fathers day this weekend and I have never been away from her.  I have always gotten a card from Karissa that was great and this year I can't even hug her.   Being down and pissed off had at least one positive side effect it made me weed the front flower bed.  In fact I am going to try to finish the back yard this weekend as well.  I have nothing better to do and no money to do it with so might as well.  :)

                    Well another good conversation day despite having to fight with Karissa over her leap pad book.    She told me yet again how she did not have the right color crayons to color a picture for me so I may just have to remedy that issue.  Not because I need a picture but if she is saying she does not have the right crayons I should be the stand up daddy and get her some.  Then I look like the Hero!!  She said she had a banana popsicle which sounded good.  I did not have much to return to her other then I was tired and doing homework.  After I said I was tired Karissa said "me too" so I asked her if we should hang up now.  She said yes because I am tired and have to go to bed.  I heard   SFW   say you are not going to bed now.  Then Karissa yawned and   SFW   laughed and said you are so silly.  Now normally I would not mention it just because although it was funny it is no big deal.  However, hearing   SFW   laugh and see Karissa's facial expression and stuff made me really angry for some reason.  I can only think it is jealousy.    Maybe I am losing it?  Maybe I was over reaacting but it made me want to jump through the phone at   SFW  .  Instead I gave Karissa hugs and kisses and told her I would call tomorrow.

                    You know I was thinking about the incident yesterday with   SFW   telling Karissa that I sent her the book.  Although it was good for Karissa to think I sent it to her why would   SFW   do it?    More to the point why would she do it while I was on the phone? Is she trying to make me feel guilty that I have not sent Karissa anything!  Because if she was I already feel guilty but considering my disposable income allows me the choice to decide between food or gas to get to work there is not much I can do in the way of sending things to her right now.  Is it something that maybe Karissa should not have?  You know a book that is not age appropriate and she will try to use that against me.  Paranoid thinking I know but given the recent past with   SFW   what am I supposed to think.  I mean when I have to question every single thing that has come out of her mouth or that she has done for the last 2 years maybe more why would the lies and deceit end now?  This has been the hardest thing ever for me.  I love my daughter she is so awesome and to have to ask these questions or operate in this manner is an insult to everything that I believe in and wanted for my kids and my life.  I just do not understand what I did wrong or how I screwed up so heinously to come to this.    I am not saying I want   SFW   back but I am saying I wish I could have stopped where I ended up and where   SFW   decided to go!  All I know is that   SFW  , the one who always claimed to be all about family, destroyed this one and now wants to keep her kids from having any relationship with family as well.    SFW   is in self destruct mode she needs help yet does not want to admit it herself.    I hope someday she sees the error she made and I am there to witness it.

                    Well I had to smile today when I called to talk to Karissa and she took the phone from   SFW   and the first statement she made was "Hi daddy!  I did not make your pretty picture yet because I could not find the right color crayons"  That really made me smile.  We started a conversation the other day about her favorite colors and stuff and I asked her to make me a picture with her favorite colors and have mommy send it to me.  Then yesterday I asked her about the picture so it was funny when she said that first thing.  I told her it was OK I was not in a hurry and she could send it when she was done making it.  I also found out the circus was coming to Houston during the time she is supposed to be here (if   SFW   agrees to the terms) I know she wants to go so it would be really cool.  She was watching 50 first dates with everyone she said she liked it and it was funny.  She also talked to my room mate Rick and told him about the movie.  Then she put the phone down and came back and said "Thank you daddy!"  I said what for?  Lisa got on the phone and said we had a book sent to her and we told her it was from you.  Not the type of behavior I expect from someone who knows about upcoming events so I can only assume she does not know yet.

                    Today I had an opportunity to talk to Karissa and she sounded very excited to talk to me.  She was telling me how Jimmy and Jeremey helped her catch a green bull frog.    I told her that Jeremey's nickname was bull frog just like her nickname was Rissa Roo she thought that was funny and stopped the conversation just to point out that Jeremey's name was bull frog.  I even went so far as to sing the Jeremiah was a bullfrog song to her. She thought that was silly too.  Karissa and I talked about what she did today and what was going on.  As usual Karissa told me nothing.  I have a feeling that Lisa is out looking for work or hanging out with her boyfriend and the kids are at home watching Karissa.  I talked to Jeremey asked him how he was doing.  Told him I still wanted to talk to him and that I was not ignoring him but I was not supposed to talk to him and he said OK.  I am still waiting for the thunder I am sure will be coming.    :)

                    Todays conversation with Karissa occurred amazingly enough from a callback with   SFW  .  Karissa sounded happy she was drinking a sprite and enjoying it from the sounds of it.  There was no fighting with her on the phone today to get her to talk to me.  In fact when she answered the phone she was excited to talk to me.  Karissa and I talked about her favorite colors.  She likes pink and purple, red and yellow.  I asked her to make me a picture.  The prettiest picture she can think of.  She said she would do that.  I am sure I will never see it after all Lisa will never mail anything for Karissa.  I expected a much different conversation from   SFW   seeing as she and I will be meeting again on July 24! Then it dawned on me that she did not have that information just yet.   I figure I will give a day or two then try to get Karissa's bus ticket for her to come here as agreed but I am sure that will change now.  Of course that can only make me look better and   SFW   look worse.    I was thinking this would make a great reality show!  Maybe I should patent the idea and go to work on it.  I could be rich.

                    Ok today's conversation took place with Karissa at the beach.  She was playing in the sand and making a big sand castle.  One as big as her according to the description given by Karissa herself.  The conversation did not last long though as she was headed to the water with the cell phone and I saw disaster looming so I told her to give me hugs and kisses and go play in the water...without the cell phone.  Of course the desire to hear Jon's phone hit the water was almost overwhelming but I opted for Karissa's fun day to remain fun.  Then I proceeded to buy tickets for Karissa's trip.  Now I know why people fly and do not take the bus!  It would have been easier to get the tickets if I had been Osama bin laden getting on an airplane.  On top of that they wanted to nickel and dime me for every little thing.  Talk about a pain in the ass.  But I finally got it figured out.

                    Well I talked to Karissa today and she sounded very excited and wanted me to come see her today.  In fact she said I am going to come see you in a few hours daddy.  I loved hearing it but I had to tell her it would be a few more weeks.  We talked about the circus coming to Houston and how I was going to try to take her to the water park and stuff.  She was so excited she was yelling at   SFW   about what daddy was going to take her to do.  We told some stories to each other nothing special just made up "once upon a time" stories.  Karissa told me about her new bear (the one I linked to in a previous post) she said she liked it so so so so so much and she slept with it every night.    Karissa accidently hung up on me a couple of times but I called her back and stuff.  Once of the times I called Karissa back I got   SFW   on the phone.  I asked her about the CS and what we talked about.  Her exact phrase was   "I am too tired to fight with you about it so that is fine.  If I tell you no you will keep arguing with me about it so it is easier to say fine"  I simply said ok I will send you an email to that effect if you would plese reply to it stating that you agree that would be appreciated.  I then talked to Karissa some more and we hung up because Karissa had to go to dinner.  She said she would call me back but did not but that was OK as we talked for a long time today.

                    Well todays conversation involved   SFW   more then it did Karissa.  I talked to Karissa for a minute and she told me she caught a catfish today but she let it go and it was not dead.  Then Jimmy changed the channel on the TV which sent Karissa into an outrage so my conversation with her was no more.  I then had the pleasure of talking to   SFW   regarding Karissa coming down.  She still insists that I pay her child support even with Karissa here "because she has financial obligations"  To which I keep replying that Child support is for the child not for Mommy's expenses.  She asked me to give her another 24 hours to "think about it".  Personally I think she is just buying time trying to figure out how to be a bitch and not look bad!

                    Alright now today was a good conversation with Karissa.  She answered the phone and immediately told me she was drawing a pretty picture for me.  She then told me that   SFW   cut her hair off.  Of course I heard   SFW   in the background saying tell your daddy why I cut your hair off and Karissa would reply no I can't tell him.  Well apparently what happened was that   SFW   gave Karissa some scissors in her room to cut paper and then left to get Karissa some breakfast (now a responsible person might ask is it wise to leave a 4YO unattended with scissors) and while she was gone Karissa decided to work on her skills as a hair stylist using her own hair.    After   SFW   explained this to me Karissa got on the phone and said "sorry daddy"  I simply said there is nothing to be sorry about honey your hair will grow back.  Daddy is not upset or mad at you. Can you do daddy a favor though and not do it again?  She gave me a resounding yes.    SFW   said that she gave Karissa the scissors to use in her room   1. because Karissa's pediatrician said they should allow Karissa to have scissors in her room (not sure how a conversation like this would even come up at the pediatricians office)  2.  They were kids scissors and were not supposed to be able to cut.  I had 2 thoughts that I voiced to   SFW    1.  I am wondering what the phychological qualifications of the pediatrician are and why they would advise that it is Ok to leave a 4YO unattended with scissors? 2.  If they are supposed to cut paper then what would make one think they would not cut anything else?  Now I am a reasonable person and understand that a child will experiment with cutting their hair that is understandable, Hell I did it!  But I question the logic behind the lack of supervision with regard to sharp instruments!  Anyway Karissa and I talked some more about other stuff that was going on that day and then she started watching Dora on TV so of course the TV became the baby sitter.    While Karissa was watching Dora   SFW   and I talked again.  She advised me that she wanted Karissa back by the 31st of July (I can only assume she knows of the upcoming legal maneuver and as a result wants to pick Karissa up at the same time she is here for court.  Of course she is assuming she is going to walk out of the court room a victor) I said that I would agree to letting her pick Karissa up by then if she would agree to my not paying her Child Support from 15 July to 31 July.      SFW   basically said I am not sure I can do that I need that money to buy Karissa's bus ticket and I have a car payment due.  I then took the opportunity to advise her that child support is intended for the support of the child not the support of the childs mommy's car!  So I was not sympathetic to her need to make a car payment.  I stated that since she would not be supporting the child then I did not see a reason to pay her child support.  I told her that I basically choose between food or gas for the car with the money I have left after paying her.  In addition she has Karissa all the time I only have her when it is convenient so let me at least have the money so I can support Karissa and do fun stuff while she is here.     SFW   said she would let me know tomorrow.  I told her I wanted it in writing as I would not trust any verbal agreement with her!  Karissa then got back on the phone and said "Thank you daddy!"  I said what for honey and she then stated "Thank you daddy for the bear"   urlLink (See her bear here)  I said oh did you get your bear and crayons and she said in a very happy, excited voice Yes!  She asked me why I sent her crayons and I said because you kept saying you could not find any crayons so I sent you some.  Karissa opened the box and said let me see if I can find pink.  The phone was silent for a minute and then she yelled I found pink daddy (She should have had no trouble there as it was the big box of crayola crayons).  So basically the call ended from there Karissa gave me hugs and kisses and then hung up on me.  Although the hanging up on people still bugs me I did not mind so much today.

                    Well thanks to   SFW's   fine parenting my daughter has not only learned that it is OK to just hang up on people but she also sits around watching TV.    In fact while talking to Karissa today I got hung up on because Karissa wanted to watch her TV show and not talk to daddy.  I was asking Karissa if she wanted daddy to let her go so she could watch her show and......Click.....then nothing but dial tone.    Once again great parenting   SFW  !  Thanks really appreciate it.

                    Well today's conversation with Karissa was kind of dull.  Karissa had just got out of a bath and was not really is a talking mood.  When I told her I was at work she thought it was funny that I worked during her night night time.  I would like to point out that I called at 18:50 my time and was told to call back in 15 minutes by   SFW   which is after 20:00 at night in Michigan.  The only reason I point this out is because at 20:05 I called and got Jon   (Fuck Stick) from now on referred to as FS   on the phone.  I asked for Karissa and got   SFW   who then gave me Karissa.    So that just adds to the case that she is in contempt!  Other then that nothing special to say today.  My mother received a call for me today from Microsoft Personnel however, the called did not leave a name or a number and when I called Microsoft Corporate main line they cannot connect me to a person unless I have a name or e-mail address so needless to say I am in a quandry.  I am still trying to find someone there at Microsoft who can help but....  I would not be interested in going back to Seattle but for the right price and the right job in Seattle I would probably go.

                    Well needless to say I did not even get a phone call from my daughter on Fathers Day.  I am sure I can thank   SFW   for that one.    In fact It was not until after 5:00 when I called Karissa and heard   SFW   say tell your daddy Happy Fathers day in the background.  I thanked Karissa and told her it made me very happy to hear that but what I was thinking was your mother is a B****!  Anyway Karissa and I talked she told me she found her color crayons and she was going to color me a pretty picture.  They were hidden in a drawer in the kitchen according to her.  She said I found a ladybug and I will send it to you so you can see it. Then you have to send it back daddy!  I told her she probably should send me a picture instead since the ladybug would miss it's family if it was sent to me.  She also said she was going to be making a ladybug cake I assumed that was for her birthday but could not make it out on the cell phone.  Jimmy was being himself.  He was yelling at Jeremey in the background saying how he hated playing a game with him because he was a "freakin cheater"  Something came up as Karissa gave me hugs and kisses real fast then proceeded to hang up.  I did not want her hanging up but all in all it was OK considering the conversation was pretty good and I needed to go into Wal-mart.  I got up this morning and did some more cleanup work on the yard so at least I have a backyard again.  Now I have an area near my AC outside that I have to clean up that will probably be next weeks project.

                    Karissa and I conversed today but again it was fairly short.  She said she was driving and wanted to go so again I let her give me hugs and kisses and go do whatever it was she was doing.    SFW   and I talked today.  I went to court appointed parenting class and while sitting there I realized that I had better consider mediating with   SFW   otherwise I may be caught with my pants down losing the contempt case and then owing a bunch of money while I go through mediation.    For the first time   SFW   said "I am sorry about all of this" and it actually sounded like it had some meaning in it.  Of course in almost the same breath she said you know I keep coming back to the contempt thing are you still going to go through with it?  I answered her question with another question "if I was not paying child support to you would you do whatever you could to make sure I paid it?"  Her silence was golden!  I said, "I will take your silence as a yes and since it is a yes here is why I am doing this.  You seem to think that you can go ahead and break the law and do these things to the kids because up until now no one has opposed you.  So I am going to go through with this because I have a point to make and that is simply I will not be bullied by you and more importantly I will not allow you to disrespect me and get away with it."    Her reply was simply "well I think you have made your point!"  To which I responded with "I do not think I have you say that now because you do not want to have to deal with it but I want you to stand in that court room and understand that what you have done is wrong and NOT in the best interest of your children."  Of course she said "I did what I had to do and I will explain that to the judge since you are going to go through with this."  Of course   FS's   parents showed up and they were headed to a BBQ so she had to go.   If we were arguing over dishes or something I would have no problem giving in but we are not I am fighting for my little girl.  I am fighting for the right to see her, be with her, hug her and ultimately to be her daddy.  Right now I am just a voice on the phone and that is hard to deal with.

                    Today Karissa and I talked for only a short period.  She said she was not feeling good and she was watching cartoons.  She said "can I give you a hug and kiss and hang up?" so I could not say no.  I felt bad for her so I did just that.    I spent the first part of my morning doing homework which I finished about noon.  Other then that I spent the day cutting down some tree branches that were rubbing up against the house.  Then I spent about 4 hours in the 90+ degree heat leveling the yard for the pool I have for Karissa.  It is about 12 feet around 3 feet tall and holds about 1500 gallons.  It just finished filling and is a little lopsided but not too bad considering I did all the leveling by hand.  I think I had too much sun I am actually feeling kind of sick but I am happy the pool is up.  Now it just needs chlorine and it got some grass in it but that will be easy enough to fix.  Tonight will be a early to bed night I have to get up and go to court mandated parenting class for a good portion of my morning tomorrow.  Then I have to see if I can get a bunch of stuff out of the back yard (wood and fencing) and take it to the dump.  That way the yard can be nice and clean for Karissa when she gets here.

                    Ok I am not sure how to even make this post flow I have had so much go wrong today I am sitting here right now getting drunk and contemplating evil thoughts (I am sure they coincide with the alcohol I am abusing currently)  So I called Karissa and as always it was great I love talking to her even though she does not always talk a lot.  In fact today she did not talk much instead she sang to daddy on the phone which was nice and I think she would be happy singing to daddy all night long if I let her.  However, she had to go play in the water so I let her go.  Then the fun started.  My attorney e-mailed me and stated that she was now agreeing to the visitation but not allowing me to keep the child support.  This of course prompted a call on my part to   SFW  .  So   SFW   says well my attorney says I don't have to agree to let you keep the child support and I said your right but I am only asking because Karissa will be here and I need that money to support her and to show her a good time.  So then   SFW   says I just want this to be civil again!  I said you know I don't think this was ever civil starting from the time you snatched Karissa up and left in the middle of the night not allowing me to even tell her goodbye.  So from there things just went down hill.    SFW   says you said you were going to file contempt against me so are you still doing that?  I of course said yes as she has the paperwork she has just not been officially served!  That is when the well you won't give me a break and help me out why should I help you?  Essentially if I drop the charges then She will let me have the money to show Karissa a good time while she is here.   At that point I informed   SFW   you have everything why should I give in I have nothing I get nothing I am supposed to pay for everything and you and your attorney think I am made of money and I am not so fine keep the money I don't give a damn.  She says well if I am going to possibly lose my daughter over this why should I help you out.  I told her she called my house barking orders at me and that I was not going to be treated like the boys' fathers and when I told her a month ago I was filing because I can sit back and let you treat me that way or I can fight I was serious.  I told   SFW   a long time ago this year had changes in it and when I say I will do it I mean it so she could have stayed here and worked things out but she did not so she gets to find things out the hard way.    SFW   wants to keep telling me how I did not do anything for the past 8 years and I was like well I told you water under the bridge and you can keep living in the past but I plan on making you accountable for what you have done.  She says I will stand in court and tell the judge exactly why I have done things the way I have.  So I said well you better make sure what you tell is the truth because I guarantee you that if you lie I will probably know it and I will have your ass for perjury as well.    The problem I have with all this is that she is probably right.  I am a man and the system works against me.  The chances that the court will do anything for me are slim.  It is OK for her to break the law and lie her way through this process but I get shafted.  So I hang up with her and then no more then 5 minutes later I get a call from the IRS.  Of course after a heated discussion with them (I was already in a confrontational state anyway) I get told I owe the IRS 2K and they have payment programs but I have to have my wife sign it with me.  Great so now I get to call   SFW   back!  So I call her back and start to tell her about what is going on and she basically says well I am not sure what you want me to say.  You did the taxes it is your fault so you can pay them.  Then she has the gall to ask me about my grandfather who is counting his days with his fight with cancer.  She actually says are you OK?  I was like am I OK let me see we have had the conversation we had plus the conversation with the IRS and that does not count the fact that yesterday I was told they did not have enough escrow for the house and now I owe 500 extra dollars payable immediately.    Needless to say I was ready to go off the deep end.    Well the only high point was I got to talk to Karissa again and tell her good night as she was eating ice cream and my neighbor came over and ivited me over to his cook out where I had steaks and other fine grub.

                    WEll I had the opportunity to call Karissa twice today.  The first time was very nice we talked and told stories to each other.  Just made up stuff.   The second time I was able to get Gma & Gpa on the phone and they talked to Karissa.  Karissa appeared to enjoy the conversation and had a good time talking to them.  I had to go to work so I tried to keep the con call going but when I hung up the phone hung up on them.  I feel bad because that means Karissa got hung up on and she wanted to talk to Gma & Gpa more.  I told Karissa if it hangs up to have mommy call them back but of course that did not happen.    I have to figure out how to con-call at home so they can talk again.

                    OK are you ready for this one.  I picked up the discovery from the   SFW   and she is claiming that I do not deserve to be the custodial parent because I have a siezure problem, was verbally and mentally abusive to Jimmy and that I use the TV as a baby sitter for Karissa!  She has some nerve I tell you!  I mean if that is the case then she has bipolar disorder, has been equally verbally abusive and has a violent nature about her!  I think the police report from her striking me proves that!  The entire time she lived with her brother you know who babysat the kids?  Hello TV!  I am so pissed off about this and some other things I cannot go into on her right now.    I talked to Karissa today though and she and I talked about how she went to the beach and played in the water and stuff.  She told me about her coming here and how I should not be sad and she did not want me to be sad!  Of course she was saying some things and must have had a great look on her face because everyone was laughing at how cute she was.  This only inflamed me more as I was already dealing with stuff from earlier in the day.    Then I got   SFW   on the phone and she says "what are you getting Karissa for her birthday?  I am just curious so we don't get the same stuff."  Then she proceeds to tell me " WE  got Karissa a couple of barbies, a mermaid barbie, a fairy barbie, and some books and stuff.    This pissed me off as well because now she is rubbing in the fact that her and   FS   are able to buy presents together and I have to scrape together pennies and stuff to get Karissa presents.    With each passing day I think the life of bachelor is the way to go because in the end I will have more money and I won't have to worry about losing my money, home, and family because I gambled on love and lost!  Maybe that is being cynical I don't know but at 20:14 on June 29, 2004 that is how I feel right now.

                    Karissa and I talked today about stuff in general.  She told me she has a prize that mommy bought her but she cannot open it until her birthday.  I asked her what she wanted for her birthday and she told me candy, ice cream, something pink....So I asked her about toys...so she said she wanted a doctor kit, stuffed animals, books, and a big pool for her and her daddy.  I told her we would BBQ and stuff when she got here and she said I want mommy to cook.  I said I did not think that mommy would be here cooking it would be daddy cooking.  She then said she wanted a mermaid for her birthday as well.  Not sure if I can come up with a mermaid   :)    Karissa had to go potty and   FS   was in the bathroom.  I am not sure why it makes me so pissed off to hear   FS's   voice but it does.    On another note the earth moved and the seas shook because   SFW   agreed to the terms of Karissa coming down and staying here.  Of course she has not seen the other paperwork yet!   :)

                    Well much to my chagrin   SFW   had Karissa call me!  Needless to say I was more then suprised.  As that has not happened before.  Karissa was out walking Sadie (the Jack Russell I bought for   SFW  ) she said Sadie was a small dog and I told her that was OK because Karissa was small.  Karissa replied with I know but I am growing bigger every day.  Karissa told me all the stuff she wanted to do when she is here.  She says she would like to walk with daddy, go to the park, go to the circus, have a BBQ, meet daddy's friends, go to "G" and Ry Ry's house.  She also said she wants a ladybug cake.    I was thinking maybe I can get Dairy Queen or someone to make one out of Ice Cream for her.  Now I just have to get the pool up before she finds out the swing set is gone!  Karissa said she was going to run with Sadie and we got disconnected.  I am not sure if Karissa hung up or if it was an accident.  I asked Karissa if she wanted to hang up and she said no but then the phone clicked so I am guessing it was accidental.

                    Well after spending the morning waiting for   SFW   to take Karissa and I to the bus station she did finally take us.  Of course after I had to sit at their house and watch her sit between   FS's   legs and kiss and stuff in the kitchen.    I did also see the hand holding and stuff under the table at Karissa's party. I wonder if she was doing to rub it in or if she was trying to make me angry to see if I would do something stupid. I even shook his hand at one point.  I wanted to deck the bastard but I errored on the side of caution instead after all how good would it look if I went up there and beat the piss out of him!  Anyway this will be the last update until probably monday as I will be on the bus for awhile now.

                    Well I met Karissa!  She ran up to me and bowled me over when she saw me.  I have just spent a couple of hours at   FS's   with Karissa, Jeremey,   SFW  .  Jimmy had no interest visiting with me in fact he went downstairs to help   FS   work on what will soon be his room.  Then we went to Chuck E. Cheese where I got the pleasure of eating dinner with   SFW   and   FS   again Jimmy avoids me!    SFW   gives me the whole "mom protect mode" line again!  Jeremey of course has no problem hanging out with me.   After Chuck E. Cheese I had to break down and get a hotel room.  I took Jeremey and Karissa to see Spiderman 2.  They both appeared to like it.  I would have taken Jimmy but he left with   FS   from Charles E. Chedder. After the movie Karissa wanted to spend the night with me so that was cool.  I did not want to upset Jeremey so I took a quick moment to tell him that this divorce had nothing to do with him and he can hang out with me anytime he wants too!  When   SFW   picked us up from the movie she informed me that in the morning Jimmy wanted to say goodbye to Karissa before she went because he did not want to come to the bus station to see her go mostly because he did not want to see me.  I was actually excited to see the boys!  I know next time I will save my excitement for Jeremey because obviously Jimmy could care less.

                    Well my conversation today was cut short with Karissa due to poor cell phone reception. Basically I told her I would be there tomorrow and that was about all I had signal for.    But since that story is short let me tell you about the Bus Service in this country!  My problems with the bus service started with ordering the tickets.  I have come to the conclusion that it is no wonder why people choose to fly.  I have never been treated with the disrespect and lack of regard for me as a customer like i have been by the bus system.  In fact I plan on writing a letter to someone over there at the bus company and if you know me I don't write letters very often!  They sell tickets with no idea how many people are on the bus or will be on the bus.  They are rude, I had one driver actually cuss at me, overall if I was grading it I would give it an F as they lack any regard for the customer at all.  Basically I wrote this during a stop at a truck stop, on a bus I was never supposed to be on!  Thanks to the oversale of tickets I am headed to Louisville KY! A destination I was never intended to go to.  But I am hoping to catch the Detroit bus there so I can make Karissa's B-day party on time.  All I can say is I would like to thank Greyhound for crappy service and   SFW   for making this whole thing possible!

                    I went to the HP employee events office today and picked up tickets for the upcoming appearance of the Ringling Bros. Barnum & Baily circus so when Karissa is in town we can go.  I look forward to seeing her look and smile from the circus.  Karissa and I had a nice talk today.  She answered the phone with a "tell me something daddy". So I told her about the tickets and that I would see her in the next couple of days.  I also informed her that I was bringing a Present from Grandma along with my present.  She acted excited about that fact.  We chatted a little more about small stuff and then she handed the phone to   SFW   I would not call that call pleasent but considering what can transpire from a call to a lying, cheating, adulterous, soon-to-be Ex-Wife I would say that the conversation went diplomatically.    Mostly we chatted about what she was packing and what I was asking her to pack.  Of course she asked me about the car seat on the bus and I informed her that I was not bringing it.  I am sure she will use that against me but I called them and they informed me it was not necessary and it was entirely my option.  I did not see any reason to coup Karissa up in the car seat for 1000 miles or whatever if they did not even recommend doing so.  In fact it has been so long since I have been on a bus I am not sure they even have seat belts in them.  I know they did not when I was a kid traveling on them.  Oh well so I get to be charged with making a decision that is not in the best interest of the child.  Not like anyone else we know is guilty of that.  I mean hell not packing the car seat on a bus might be worse then.....Oh I don't know....leaving a 4YO unattended with scissors!

                      SFW   had Karissa call me today after my failed attempt to reach her.  This shocked me yet again because prior to filing the contempt motion she never did that.  Now she is being O'so nice!  No doubt trying to manipulate me.  Karissa and I talked about her going to the library and she was planning on checking out books and playing on the computer and apparently she had a friend from across the street with her.  We talked about silly stuff.  Karissa told me how she wanted to have a ladybug cake and a spiderman cake.  I told her that much cake in a little girl her size might make her do silly things :)  I told her how grandma sent a present to her and stuff but again she did not seem all that excited about the notion of coming to daddy's house.  I just want to hear her be excited like she is when she tells me about other things she is doing.  So after about 15 minutes the need to hang up and stuff overtook her and she hung up.  I had very little sleep today about 4 hours but then I went and got a haircut and ran some badly needed errands.  I also worked on the homework and stuff trying to get it all done before I leave to get Karissa.  Now all I have to do is pack for the trip.

                    Once again I was shut down by Karissa.  I called right after she apparently hit her head and hurt herself.  She told me about it and I tried to comfort her as much as possible over the phone but lets me honest the phone is never as good as a hug or a kiss to make it better.  She then wanted to watch cartoons and had no use for me any longer and hung up.  I bought her birthday present today, at least the one I am taking to MI anyway, it is a cat that you put batteries in and it meows and purrs and stuff.  Knowing how much Karissa loves cats I thought she would like it.  So I am not sure what is going on lately.  I am driving along and next thing you know I am thinking about   SFW   I am not sure why I just am.  I don't know if it is my upcoming trip or what but I have dreams about her and think about her and stuff and I don't understand why.      SFW   deserves none of my thoughts, time, or anything else!  I have always been very logical and analytical about most things but this makes no sense to me.

                    Well today I thought I would be slick and call Karissa before later in the afternoon when they may be gone because of fireworks shows or BBQ's!  Well that plan backfired on me.  I am not sure what was going on but from the sounds of it Karissa was taking a rocket of some kind from Jimmy and they were fighting over it.  So needless to say I got to say Happy 4th of July to Karissa who in turn told   FS  !    Then she did not want to talk anymore due to the fighting and mood she was now in.  I let her go as she was going to hang up on  me anyway.    When I hung up I did so feeling guilty:        I always hear the kids outside or doing something with   FS         I don't recall doing all that much with the kids (Maybe it was the 2 years of depression I was supposedly suffering from).        despite my attempts to make her happy when she was with me   SFW   sounds happier now then she ever did with me!    I am sure that I must have had times when I did fun things with the kids and stuff but to be honest as I sit here typing this I have a hard time remembering them.  That may be in part due to my 6 month haetus away from the kids, maybe the things I did do have been overshadowed by the ugly mess that is going on, or maybe I just did not do that much.  I hate the thought that an adulterer and a person of unsound morals and ethics being a better dad then I.    In addition I spent the night dreaming about   SFW  !  I know what you are thinking but it was not that kind of dream.  In fact if I had to put it into a movie it would almost play out like a chick flick.  I did not want to dream about her but I did!   I think I needed a parental mind filter! Capable of blocking out images of   SFW  !   I wonder if she ever thinks of me....Other then someone trying to put her in jail?  So here it is 4th of July I have to work and have chosen to sit here and do homework for the rest of the day.  I have to get it done so I would like to get as much done as possible so I do not have to take time away from Karissa while she is here to do it.    In addition I leave Thursday and will not be back until Sunday so that is going to cost me participation points I am sure but Karissa is worth it.  I have so much to do this week and so little to spend to get it done.          get a present for Karissa (I have it just have not purchased it yet)     figure out how to get the damn pool to a normal PH level and alkeline     haul off all this wood and debris so the yard is clean for her     pack for the trip    I forgot to mention yesterday that   SFW   actually agreed to pick me up from the bus station when I get into town! I did not even ask she offered!  I said well I will have to figure out where I am going to stay that night and again she suprised me and said "We will figure something out"  My luck she is planning a pine box about 6 feet in length and 3 feet wide!

                    Today was a big domesticated, gaylord fauker day for daddy.&nbsp; I had friends over again to visit and play with Karissa.&nbsp; She really likes it when friends come over with kids she has a great time and they play in the pool and it wears her out.  &nbsp;  I awoke at 10:30 am after working the previous night and was able to borrow a pickup and made a run to the dump with stuff I have been meaning to get rid of.&nbsp; Karissa wanted to go so I loaded the extra seat in the pickup and she rode with.&nbsp; I think she&nbsp;enjoyed the ride except for the part where you got to smell the landfill but then again none of us enjoyed that part!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Daddy (me) also&nbsp;baked pumpkin bread, banana bread and cheesecake all from scratch.&nbsp; All seemed to be a big hit with the locals.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Karissa talked to her mommy and and asked her if it was ok to spend the night at daddy's because she really wanted to stay, not sure what that was all about but it was all good!  &nbsp;  My buddy Doug came by and he was showing me his motorcycle&nbsp;and the changes he had made to it.&nbsp; He was telling me how he wanted a pair of chaps so he would have to wait to get saddlebags so I gave him my chaps.&nbsp; After all I have no motorcycle anymore and I have not worn them in years so it seemed right.&nbsp; Plus he has helped me out with a lot of stuff.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  All in all it was a productive and fun day!&nbsp;  &nbsp;

                    Today was rather uneventful.&nbsp; Not a lot to talk about.&nbsp; I picked up Karissa from the babysitter and we had dinner at CiCi's pizza which she has always liked.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  We then went home and she sat on my lap and watched some cartoons.&nbsp; I think if I would have sat there long enough she probably would have gone to sleep.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Rick, (crazy Uncle Martha) we walked in from CiCi's and Karissa said "hey Rick" and he said I think I am going to change my name to Martha and you Karissa can be Fred.&nbsp;&nbsp;Well&nbsp;Rick had to go to the store so while he was at the store, I&nbsp;convinced Karissa to call him Crazy Uncle Martha. when he&nbsp;returned she did just that! &nbsp; Anyway Rick&nbsp;had a&nbsp;mutual friend and his girlfriend over for dinner and they brought her 2 YO son.&nbsp; Needless to say&nbsp;Karissa was having a pretty good time when I called home!&nbsp; &nbsp; Like I said not a lot going on...&nbsp; &nbsp;  I did however, come across this fable I thought was pretty funny.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Onestone  &nbsp;  There once was an Indian whose given name was "Onestone," so named because he had only one testicle.   He hated that name and asked everyone to not to call him Onestone!   After years and years of torment, Onestone finally cracked and said, "If anyone calls me Onestone again I will kill them!"   The word got around and nobody called him that any more.   Then one day a young girl named Blue Bird forgot and said, "Good morning, Onestone..."   He jumped up, grabbed her, and took her deep into the forest where he made love to her all day and all night.   He made love to her all the next day, until Blue Bird died from exhaustion.   The word got around that Onestone meant serious business.   Years went by and no one dared call him by his given name until a woman named Yellow Bird returned to the village after being away for many years.   Yellow Bird, who was Blue Bird's cousin, was overjoyed when she saw Onestone.   She hugged him and said, "Good to see you, Onestone..."   Onestone grabbed her, took her deep into the forest, then he made love to her all day and all night; made love to her all the next day and night...but, Yellow Bird wouldn't die!!!!   What is the moral of this story???   You can't kill two birds with one stone!

                    Well like every payday it is a gloomy day for me.&nbsp; I pay the bills and realize that I am so&nbsp;poor I cannot pay attention!  &nbsp;  However, after working last night I am operating on very little sleep.&nbsp; I truly love Karissa and she is worth every bit of pain I endure for her so the lack of sleep is still worth it.&nbsp; Today I came home and slept about 2 hours before she woke up!&nbsp; Then I took her to the babysitter (a friend that agreed to watch her for a few hours so I can sleep)&nbsp; came home and got about 3 more hours.  &nbsp;  Karissa had a great time as the babysitter has small kids and she had a great time playing.&nbsp; When I picked her up I took her to Mcdonald's and got her some ice cream and she played for about an hour.  &nbsp;  When we got home Rick's sister Tamara came over with her daughter Madison and they played until about 5 when they both got into the pool.&nbsp; Needless to say Karissa had no problem with daddy leaving for work tonight.&nbsp; She also had no problem with the temp outside being 102!  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

                    I was thinking about the trips I have taken to go and see Karissa and I came up with the following:     So that made me think if Lisa would just start messing around on   FS   with someone from the east coast then I can go coast to coast to visit my daughter!  :)  The thing that is truly sad about this map is that my daughter has had to endure more miles in the car then I have in the last six months.

                    Well today Karissa and I hung out at home with Alan and his son Jack.  Karissa and Jack swam in the pool for about 2 hours. After Alan and his son left Karissa and I went on a bike ride to the fountians in the lakes to see the ducks and the fountian.  After bothered the ducks we went to the park for a little bit.  I did not want to keep her out to long in the sun as she is not aclimated to Texas sun anymore.  Mommy called a couple of times today and everytime she called I tried to call her back and got nothing but a fax machine or modem and could not even leave a message.  When I finally did get through   SFW   was not home.   SFW   called about the time I was getting ready to leave for work and Karissa did not want to talk to her :)    I cannot tell you how good that made me feel.

                    Well Daddy is pretty much out of fun money!  We went to the galleria today where Karissa and I had the opportunity to check out the wall of water and I purchased a fur covered kitty Pez dispenser for her.    We then came home after about 5 hours at the galleria and Karissa and I swam and played.  I had her help me with the BBQ dinner we made.  Afterward her and Rick baked some cookies and I went out and mowed the lawn.  I finished about the time the outside lights came on and the sun was no more.  I informed Karissa that before we do anything tomorrow she and I will be cleaning her room and she seems fine with that right now.  We will see what happens when tomorrow comes.  I asked Karissa a couple of times today if she wanted to call her Mommy?  To which she kept replying "not right now"  Which is great because it is good to hear her ignoring Mommy for a change.  At least I am making an effort to have Karissa talk to her mommy something I doubt   SFW   does for me!

                    Talk about a long day.  Karissa woke me up at 8 which I was not ready for :)  Then we were on go from there.  She and I went out and ran some errands which included a trip to the toy store where she picked up a couple of new toys.  We spent about 1.5 hours in the pool together and were having a great time.  When we decided to take a break Brad & Amy showed up and and Karissa was right back in the pool with Amy and their 2 boys.  So all in all Karissa spent about 3 hours in the pool.    After they left Rick started in on cookies which Karissa graciously helped with.  I cooked Karissa some dinner and afterward she sat down with me to watch American Chopper.  She liked that show she said but fell asleep from all the activity today in my arms.  I carried her to bed!  Instead of waiting for   SFW   to call I made the effort and called her!  I let Karissa talk to her about anything she wanted.  Of course Karissa got to talk to Jon and stuff to and that kind of rubbed me the wrong way but I did not let that show!    SFW   called back after Karissa hung up to have me get her W2 for her along with Karissa's birth certificate.  I told her I would look around but I was not sure if I had that stuff.  Bottom line is I will look for it when I am good and ready to do so!

                    Karissa had a pretty good time at the circus today and I have to admit I enjoyed the circus as well.  The tigers have always been my favorite although that part is too short!  Karissa came away with all kinds of stuff.  She received one of those spinning scepters, a white tiger cup that had her snow cone in it, a hat that had her cotton candy in it and a full tummy and stuff.  Daddy came away with an empty pocketbook.  On the way home she even fell asleep so I am guessing she got up too early and liked the circus.  I came home and cleaned the house anticipating a suprise visit from   SFW   since she is rolling into town today.  Instead all I got was a phone call saying she was coming over tomorrow but she does not know when.  She does not have a rental car as all the places are closed which really means I need to give out some nookie before I can get paid!  I am sure she will come over and tell me what she wants and if I don't give it to her she will take Karissa and leave.  Right now the way it stands she did not get back to her attorney or something because her attorney never corresponded with my attorney so mediation may not take place on Monday which means I will not see her until her contempt hearing on Tuesday!  I have to admit I am a little nervous.  I am worried about the court not providing justice and letting her go scott free!

                    So shortly after today's fun and excitement with   SFW   Karissa says to me "daddy I have to pinch a loaf"  I was aghast I could not believe this was my 4 YO saying this.  I said Karissa where did you hear that and she says well   FS   (Jon is what she really said) says it all the time!  Well after that conversation Karissa and I were able to run a couple of errands and then come home and she played in the pool and I worked in the back yard some more.  I ran the weedeater, mowed, and cleaned out one of the flower beds and cleaned out the bird bath.  I finished about the time that the thunder and lightning started and it POURED rain.    There were a couple of times that the thunder and lightning scared her but for the most part all was ok with her.  Tomorrow morning we get to go check out the circus so that will be a great time I think.

                    Just got off the phone with   SFW  .  I asked her about Jeremey and she swears that his "nana" bought the ticket for him and his vacation was unplanned!  Of course I got the lecture about how I was in cohoots with Kirk and Katy, Jake and Lisa and everyone else.  She states what does my child in my possession have to do with you?  I said well unless you fail to realize this our lives are still intertwined and when you tell me you have to have Karissa back because she is going to a birthday party that obviously will never happen I am a little curious.  She then says I would sure like to be able to wipe my ass without you knowing about it.  I simply said this has nothing to do with your ass nor do I even care about your ass.  She was like she has been gone for 3 weeks do you know how hard that is?   I was like hello...I have seen my daughter for 1 month THIS YEAR 3 weeks is a walk in the park.  I hope you now have at least a small taste of what I have gone through!  She then said well you will get her for Thanksgiving and Xmas so I won't get any holidays with her.    I simply said well we can trade you can have the holidays and I will take her everyday.    Of course her answer was no!  Then she tried to tell me how nice she had been chauffering me around so I could spend time with her and stuff.  I simply told her I thanked you and it won't ever happen again I will get my own car.  Sure she chaufferred me around but I had to sit around while she hugged, kissed, held hands, and groped her boyfriend in front of me so it did not come without a price.  Not to mention having to explain to my 4 YO why she should not try to french kiss her daddy!  So I would say I paid my dues!  She will probably come here and want to take Karissa and there is nothing I can legally do to stop her.  The order gives her that right.  If my attorney thinks I will be mediating anything other then stuff for the kids he and her have another thing coming if I lose before a judge then so be it but otherwise I am going all out.  What do I have to lose but more money I do not have?

                    It has been a long day for Karissa and I.    WE went to the Museum of Natural Science and then to lunch at the golf course at memorial park.  Then followed a friend out to his house in the woodlands.  Or augusta pines anyway.  She had a great time with his son and his older daughter.  They played in the pool.  Had dinner together, played with is boxer named Henry, and just ran herself ragged.  I too had a good time and it helped take some of the stress I am starting to feel with the upcoming mediation and court hearing with   SFW    In addition   SFW   said the reason I could not keep Karissa until Aug 6th was because Karissa had to be home for her brothers birthday party! Well considering her brother is in Washington with his dad until Aug 21st I would say that once again she has been giant liar!   The more things change the more they stay the same!  A leaopard can't change it's spots!  You can't teach and old dog new tricks!   If you get my meaning!!

                    Today was a day filled with very little excitement or outing.   Basically Karissa wanted to swim in the pool and I had some yard work that needed to be done so basically I put her in the pool and worked in the backyard with her.   I got quite a bit accomplished. Now I just have to hope the garbage man takes the stuff I put out for him.   I added the new webcam to the site it is pretty cool in the daylight hours as you can look into the back yard and see the pool. Of course not much fun at night in my dark back yard. I need to fix that someday as well.     SFW   called to talk to Karissa I think she had the phone up to her ear long enough to say I don't want to talk to you anymore. In a way I know that is wrong and I tried to tell Karissa about being hung up on and stuff yet at the same time it is so fulfilling to have   SFW   get a shot of what I have been getting for 6 months!

                    Man some days really take their toll!  This morning Karissa started crying because she missed her dog!  So we loaded up a picnic basket and headed to the park where we played and did hide & seek and stuff.  On the way from the park Mommy called on the cell so I let Karissa have the phone and I kept peddling.  Karissa was in the bike trailer and I was peddling.  Of course Karissa's mommy wanted to talk to me so I had to pull over.    She grilled me about I thought you were at the park and all that.  I told her we were I am riding a bike and Karissa was in the trailer. Her response.....Oh  Well Karissa and I came home and ran a couple of errands and since she was good she got a sucker at wal-mart.  I came home and Karissa helped me do yard work.  She even helped me push the mower.  She stood in front of me and pushed the mower while daddy helped ;)  Then she helped me pick up the grass and throw it away.  For that I took her to 2 for 1 pizza roll night.  We got a dozen of them for about 6 bux and they are about as long as bread sticks from Olive garden and full of cheese and pepperoni.   Afterwards we went to the park and she played with Brad's boys Garrett and Ryan.  She had a really good time.  She got really dirty and despite having a bath this morning she needed another when we got home.    I was reading her a book when she asked if Mommy was going to pick her up.  I asked her if that is what she wanted and she said no.  Then Karissa said if she picks me up then I will miss you  That was very hard to hear.  I told her that no matter what she will be with someone she loves because I love her lots and lots and so does Mommy.  I also told her that I knew this was hard on her and I was sorry that mommy and daddy could not be together anymore but no matter what she was a good girl and she did not do anything wrong!    I gave her a big hug and told her to not be sad because it makes daddy sad when she is sad :) Then I got her a stuffed animal and had to leave.  I hate my ex!  This is so wrong our baby should not go through this she should not have to wonder why the pictures of her family are not on daddy's walls (since she asked me yesterday and seemed hurt when she went through the house looking for them), she should not have to worry that she misses one parent more then the other.  It is just wrong!  But how would I know that after all   SFW   said in her deposition how she understood kids from her extensive training in parenting class!  Bleccchh!

                    Well Karissa and I picked up Circus Tickets today and went to daddy's school.  We then came home and swam.  However, I had a couple of thing happen today which I really am now questioning.      Karissa (while we were playing in the pool) said to me I want to give you a kiss daddy.  So I let her and she tried to French Kiss me!  I asked her what she was doing and she said trying to kiss like mommy!  I had to explain to her why she should not be kissing daddy or other people that way which is hard to explain to a 4 YO. For that matter I should not have to explain it!    Karissa went upstairs today and was upstairs reading her books.  I went downstairs to clean the kitchen and she came down and said "daddy I went potty and got poopy on my underpants because I did not wipe good".  I said OK go in the potty so we can finish.  Well when I got in there she acted like the world was going to end.  "Sorry daddy I didn't mean to!  I am really sorry!  Don't be mad at me!  I told her she did not need to be sorry and it was OK it was an accident.     Normally this would not bother me but yesterday when we were at Stacee and Rob's she could not find the potty and ended up peeing in her pants on the floor downstairs.  Again not a major issue but she acted the same way almost the same verbage.  Again I told her it was OK she did not know where the potty was and I would just wash her clothes and clean up the mess.  Then last week she did the same while she was here with Rick.  She had gone potty in her pants.  She did the same kind of routine with him.  He just told her that is why they call them accidents right?  She thought that was funny and all was well.  You know   SFW   even said in her deposition that she feels she should have custody of Karissa because she has had parenting classes and and understands children.  I will admit I have made mistakes as a parent.  I don't know a person who has not but I have had parenting classes as well. In fact   SFW   and I took a couple of them together.  But to see the look of fear on Karissa's face because of the bathroom thing and the french kiss thing really pisses me off and concerns me.  For someone who understands children Karissa sure seems scared when accidents happen.     SFW   says Karissa is happy and well adjusted and for the most part I would agree but to see these things coming out lead me to believe not all is great for Karissa.  And the system is against me isn't that some shit!

                    Today we spent the day with Kim and her two girls Amber and Ashley and her cousin Stacee and Rob and their 4 kids Brie, Kenner, Maggie, and Rainey (Hope I spelled some of the names correct)  &nbsp;  Karissa and all the other kids played in the pool at the YMCA which is more like a water park then a pool.&nbsp; After we went back to Rob and Stacee's house where Karissa played with the kids and we had dinner.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I made mini-kolache's and Rob fried up some hamburgers.&nbsp; Kim and Stacee filled water balloons for the kids for after dinner.&nbsp; When it came time for water balloons the balloons went quick.&nbsp; The deck was wet and the kids discovered that water and sidewalk chalk make paint so they painted each other.&nbsp; After some time doing that they decided they wanted to get into the hot tub.  &nbsp;  I stepped in for my part in the kid washer assembly line and we cleaned all kids before allowing them in the hot tub.&nbsp; Once they got&nbsp;into the hot tub we added some dish soap to the tub.&nbsp; Well the tub was full of bubbles in no time.&nbsp; Karissa dove into the water and came up covered in bubbles.&nbsp; She wiped her eyes of and started laughing and basically looked like a mini-Santa or something.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Kim took&nbsp;this pic with her camera phone&nbsp;we all thought it was pretty darn funny so I have put it up here for all to see!  &nbsp;   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  After that the kids stayed up late playing until I put Karissa in the car and headed home.&nbsp; She was out cold in about 10 minutes.&nbsp; She said she had a really great time and even wanted to call and tell everyone so I let her.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Now it is daddy's bedtime as he is pretty tired himself.

                    Karissa is supposedly sick today.  She has a cold, stuffy nose, cough that sort of thing.  I find it interesting that she was never sick at my house but day 2 arriving in Michigan and she is sick.  I did talk to Karissa momentarily.  Enough to get a kiss and hug and that was about it.  She asked me to call her back later and I obliged however, she did not want to talk later so I was shot down.  Well the ride home this morning was a little on the sore side but other then that it was a good ride.  This cowboy is just not used to being in the saddle so we will be building up to that ride.  Today I drove the car.  Other then that not much going on.  I am wondering about what   SFW   next move and that enters my mind all the time now but good things come to those who wait so we will see.

                    Conversations with Karissa have returned to normal.  I call she says one or 2 things and then wants to hang up.  Today she wanted to hang up after I told her I was running errands.  I did tell her that a lot of people have told me how they miss her.  She said who daddy and I told her that Rick and Alan and his wife and their kids Jack and Kelsey miss her and she says "are they crying?"   I simply said no they are not crying they just miss having fun with you.  She simply said can I go now.     I asked for hugs and kisses and let her go!  Other then that today was pretty normal.  I did ride my bicycle to work but that was nothing special it was the first time I did it about 8 miles.

                    Yesterday I got a ticket for speeding that really sucked!  $237 to be exact!  Of course the evening went much better :)  Today I drove back from Dallas I thought of Karissa and even called only to get VM.  I came home and started to take a nap as today was my first day back to work in 3 weeks!  Well who should call but   SFW  !  Did she call to let me talk to Karissa or clue me in on where she is going?  No!  She called to bitch at me!    I did get to talk to Karissa for about 3 minutes tops!    It seems that I forgot to pack Karissa's socks. The very same socks that Karissa never wore when she was here so the socks sat in a drawer unused for 3 weeks and I forgot them.  I also forgot to pack Karissa's leap pad book.  Karissa never even played with it from the time we left MI to the time   SFW   picked her up.  I went in Karissa's room and found it in the toy box.     SFW   hung up on me in the middle of our conversation when I told her Karissa never played with those toys while she was here and I was sorry I did not pack it.  She simply reponded with "Yeah you are super dad" and hung up.  I called the pay phone back and told her that one of these days she needs to understand that hanging up the phone does not solve her phone conversation problems and Karissa is very perceptive so I did not appreciate her doing it in front of Karissa as Karissa has that bad habit which I am sure she got from Lisa.    Like the french kiss thing because she wants to "kiss like mommy!"  So rather then blow it off or seem uncaring I sent it fed-ex for $62 to MI so it would be there Monday since   SFW   told me she has to leave on Tuesday to make it back to TX or WA.    Of course I am helping her decision to go back to WA by providing Jeremey's Stepmom and Dad with information from my case so they can file for temporary custody of him.  I can only imagine the lid   SFW   will flip when she finds that one out.    I also found out that   SFW   is telling her kids that their uncle does not love them anymore because of the blowout between   SFW   and her brother.  I find that absolutely horrifying not to mention if she can get her 14 and 12 year old to believe that about their uncle I am afraid to find out what   SFW   might tell them about me and/or the latest court ruling.    Needless to say I am a little tired.  I did not get my nap before work because of everything going on.    My mother sent extra money for my mortgage and a Kaleidiscope for Karissa 11 days ago and still no sign of it! That sucks more then I can even tell you.  I am sure at this rate I will be broke and homeless in no time!  I know the lord tests people and the tests make you stronger but I am wondering if he can quit making me stronger for awhile and offer me some tests that make me thinner or something?

                    At this very moment I have to admit my mood is somber...or maybe that is a little mild how about down right in the dumps!  Karissa left about 45 minutes ago.  I did not want her to go but I could not stop it.  I cannot even describe my hatred for   SFW   I know god tells me I should not hate but I have to admit watching my daughter drive off with her little hand waving to me filled me with more hatred for   SFW   then one can possibly imagine except for the 60% of you that are in the divorced category and probably the 50% of that who do not have custody of their children.  I took Karissa to breakfast this morning and bought her a big breakfast and let her pick out her snacks for the trip back to MI.  I have had such a great time with her here the pool, the circus, even just hangin with friends!  It sucked to have   SFW   come to town and ruin that for me!  So as I sit her I contemplate driving...not necessarily to any place in particular but driving just to get out of the house and have something to do.  I miss Karissa dearly and feel this is so wrong how can I have walked into a courtroom and essentially won only to have Karissa leave?  I feel the ruling was fair however, I wish he would have said the child will remain in the fathers custody until such time as   SFW   got back into compliance of the court order.    Of course it would only be another 10 days of which I have to work 4 of them so I guess that is not all that great of a situation.  At this point I am merely rambling letting my fingers do the talking :)   All I can say is Goodbye Karissa and I will wait with great anticipation until you come to visit daddy again!

                    Well today was not a win but it was not a loss as well.    The court decided that they were unable to hear the motion to modify temporary orders and the motion for interim attorney fees.  So the court only listened to the contempt motion.  To refresh your memories or fill you in if you are new the motion listed the following items of contempt against   SFW       Living outside of the geographic restriction of King County, Washington or Harris County, TX   Being with a person of the opposite sex, in the childs presence after 20:00 (8:00) in the evening   Responsible for timely payment and insurance coverage of the 2000 Ford Mustang     Well the court found her not guilty of contempt on the first count based on a technicality.  The technicality was the official filing of the temporary orders was filed May 10 and   SFW   moved to MI on May 7th.  However, the court did inform her that she was guilty but because of this technicality they were letting her off.  With regard to count 3 they did not even rule on it.  It was like they did not even see it or recall that it was filed.  Count 2 found   SFW   guilty of contempt!  The court said based on your own testimony you are guilty and   SFW   has 10 days to move back to WA or TX or turn over Karissa to the father otherwise she will be confined to Harris County Jail.    Of course when it was all over I got the "you are such an asshole" phone call where she threatened to make me pay and that I had won a battle but I had not won the war.  She swore to make me pay.   The only problem with all this is that   SFW   has demanded that I have Karissa ready to go tomorrow at 10 am.  She said to me she is never coming back to TX and that for me has a dual connotation.    It can mean she is never coming back to live in TX or it can mean she is not coming back!  Meaning she is going to take Karissa and bail!  She has 10 days to get back to MI which will take 2 days then 3-4 to get to WA that is essentially a week.    We have mediation scheduled for the 1st of September which she has to come back for.  The attorney's are trying to move up the final hearing to mid-september and there is still a hearing for the attorney fees so unless she is using all the support money to travel or has a new sugar daddy in WA I could see her not coming back and disappearing with Karissa.  Anyway I am spending my last day with Karissa before she leaves tomorrow at 10 AM.

                    Today was one of the more stressing days I think I have had in about 3 weeks!  Today I met   SFW   at Mcdonalds up the road with Karissa because she wanted to see Karissa.  Well after being there about an hour she busted out the papers for visitation I sent her 3 times and said we should talk about this.  I simply said to her unless you are open to the option of me having Karissa even temporarily then there is no reason to discuss anything as you and I both know Karissa is the issue.  Well that did not go over so good!  After a break she came back and said Karissa we should go to your house and watch a movie.  Of course that worked for Karissa so next thing I know we are headed back to the house.    Well she finally said look one of us is not going to get Karissa so we should at least talk about the visitation we can both agree to.  The reason she said was because she was not going to give me Karissa and I am not going to let her just have her so we would have to just let someone else decide that.  I agreed and we did just that.    That was fairly civil in the way in which it took place.  Oh and for those of you who called while seeing her in my backyard on the webcam thanks for watching my back and making me have an awkward conversation....You know who you are! :)  Anyway we seemed to have come up with a fairly agreeable plan with regard to visitation.  However, as we finished up she says if I lose Karissa I will have an issue with you having the house.  So here we are right back at a money issue.  I know it is not all about Karissa.  Karissa is her meal ticket.    She says I will not get fucked out of everything and get nothing after all I put into this marriage.  All I said was well we will cross that bridge when we come to it.  What I was thinking was not to mention all you put into everyone elses marriage as well.  She also says do you have to be at the hearing (contempt) and I said yes and even if I didn't I would be anyway.  She says well you know the stuff I am in contempt of you may just be in contempt yourself.  I can only assume she means my roommate after all she is up on three counts and I am not in contempt of 2 of them for sure.       Residing in a location other then Washington state or Texas   Not paying for the mustang in her possession     The only one she might have an argument on which still holds no real weight is      Being with a person of romantic interest after 8 o'clock at night     This one was filed meaning moving in with a boyfriend/girlfriend.  We filed it because she did just that.  I have a roommate which she found out about today! So I think she thinks because I have a roommate I am living with another man after 8 o'clock at night....the flaw in her logic is we are not romantic and I am not living with a man other then the father and I am not trying to make Rick the new mommy!  Anyway I am hoping for the best but I am expecting the worst!  We will see!

                    After leaving a message today around 3 PM I received a phone call from Karissa at about 9 PM.  Apparently she had just gotten home or back to the Hotel from a busy day at the beach.  She told me the water was cold there and then asked mommy to make sure it was cold and mommy told her it was not so instantly Karissa changed her story to the water was warm.  She told me how she played in the sand and built sand castles and swam in the water with mommy.  She talked about how the waves crash down and get in her mouth and stuff.  Karissa asked me a bunch of stuff about my work like what is it's name where is it stuff like that.  She told me how work is not just for boys but it is for girls too!   Maybe she should explain that one to her mommy!   Karissa started to laugh and I told her how much I liked her laugh and how cute it was. That made her laugh more and of course she had to tell mommy about it.  Then she said I don't want to talk anymore and that was the end of it.  She asked me to call her later and I said how about I call you tomorrow and if you are not there I leave you a voicemail.  She liked that idea telling her mommy (in an excited voice) how she would get a voicemail if they are not there.   I gave her hugs and kisses first and she returned the gesture and that was that.  When I hear her laughing and sounding so happy it really plays on me like what I am doing in my effort to get custody of her is wrong but if I don't do anything I feel I am wrong as well.  I just cannot sit back and do nothing.  If I lose that is one thing but if I do nothing that is entirely different.  If I lose I keep all the paperwork and receipts and when she is old enough to choose I show her that daddy tried.  I just hope I don't have to do that.   I have to admit having   SFW   is making me a little paranoid.  Especially now that she has been served yet again.    I saw some pics of Jeremey today all Decked out like a biker boy!  He looked like he was having fun.    Other then that I get to look forward to a day of house cleaning and yard work tomorrow as I cannot afford to do much else.  Oh well the house needs it and it keeps me out of trouble.  Good thing it is free HBO, Cinemax weekend on the Dish!

                    So today is the day that all hell has broken loose.    SFW   was hit with paperwork from WA today.  I had a friend of mine serve   SFW   with a restraining order and motion for temporary custody of Jeremey.    Needless to say   SFW   is a little pissed at me!  I got to talk to Karissa and I actually went by and saw her.  When I talked to her on the phone she was laughing and stuff, I love to hear her laugh. Karissa asked if I could come by and see her and I told her I wanted to.    I called   SFW   back and asked if I could bring Karissa's swimsuit by and she said OK.  I went by and man she was so pretty and happy to see me.  It just felt good to pick her up and hug her.  I could not stay and so she painted a picture, a little pony picture, and gave it to me and said I want you to have this.   I left and 15 minutes later my buddy showed up and served her!  Of course I received a call from   SFW   telling me not to come by there anymore I could have Karissa on 8/17 - 8/24 and 9/1 - 9/8 otherwise I was not to come by.  In one way I am sorry that happened because I would love to go by everyday and see Karissa and I have now screwed that up but hopefully in the long run it will work to my benefit.  I know she hates me for what I have done and am doing and that is a little painful to have the woman you once loved hate you but then again the stuff she did was not done out of love I am guessing.  Instead I think she just hates me because I am putting up the fight that I am instead of rolling over and giving in to her like many do.  None of this process is easy but at the same time I feel it is necessary.  I feel if I leave Karissa with Lisa she will turn Karissa into a basket case.  I mean after all she told Jeremey that his aunt and uncle did not love him anymore. That is not healthy or acceptable.  Even if she dislikes the rest of her family and hates them she should not deny the opportunity to her children to have a relationship with their family.  That is my opinion and I am hoping it will be the courts opinion as well.

                    I was sitting outside at lunch tonight in the warm evening air thinking to myself about times past.  Wondering how things got to this point.    How could things have gotten so off course that I have lost my daughter and a woman that I loved so much.  I really tried to get her to come back to me.  If only she had given me another month or so to see that the medication I was taking for depression was helping.  It was changing me from the man I had become.  I begged her to return to me which was a stupid move on my part but never the less I did it.    I feel torn between what I now have to do and what I still wish for.  I think it is wrong to take Karissa away from her brothers but at the same time I feel Lisa (this post I have decided to not use SFW)is not the person she used to be.  I am not sure if it is her attempt to become something else...midlife crisis after turning 30 or what but she is not the same person.   I wish so much for the good times of the past but know that they are dead.  I wish for Karissa to have her parents at the same time but that too is gone.  I swore from the time I was a kid I would not do the divorce thing to my kids but here I am.  Given the things that Lisa did to me I should not feel guilty but I do.    Maybe I am just tired it has been almost 24 hours without sleep and I have an hour long bike ride home which I am not looking forward to.  It is good for me and once I get going I will probably think differently but right now...  I worry about if I get Karissa can I be the father that is expected of me.  Can I make the daddy that she deserves.  If I don't get Karissa what will I do?  I have to be honest I truly miss my daughter and even now want to just go pick her up but I can't and that sucks.  She is less then a mile from my house and I cannot go see her.  I want Karissa to live with me but I know Karissa would miss being with her mommy and her brothers.    I will continue forward because I have to and because Lisa thinks she will automatically win.  Nothing in life is automatic. Lisa has said one of the reasons she got involved with  ONE  of her affairs was that the Dr. made her feel like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman and all I can say to that is that a lot of women see that movie and view it as the prince charming saves the princess movie but everyone seems to forget that under all that glamour and zip she was found hooking on the streets and is nothing more then a common whore.  So I guess if the shoe fits Lisa...  Now if you are a regular reader you may have thought I was having cold feet or something but all I can say is I was just looking at the stars and pondering and this is kind of the stuff I was pondering (Luckily I think faster then I type) so don't worry all plans are still a go and until I run out of money so am I.

                    Well   SFW   is in town just called.  I could care less about her but I was able to talk to Karissa.  Karissa sounded like she was on a great trip and she was happy to be in Texas.  She told me about the room and all the stuff it has and even went so far as to tell me about the kitchen and the bathroom and stuff.  I told   SFW   she can bring Karissa by to play in Karissa's pool.  I would be sleeping and stuff so she would not have to talk to me or even see me.  I know what you are thinking but if the house is locked and she is in the back playing in the water who cares.  At least Karissa is having fun and that is really what is important!  Karissa said she missed me and she loves me and stuff and then I got the info from   SFW   as to where they are at.  Man have I got a suprise for her!  I wish I could be there to see her face.  However, I have a friend and he will be taping it.  You know when this is all over and hopefully I have Karissa I am thinking we should  ALL  get together for a party on   SFW  's behalf.    After all without her we would not have brought as many families together as we have done recently.

                    Well today is blackout day.  I did not get to talk to Karissa at all.  In fact I did not even get to try.  So I don't really have much to post today.    I did get to write a paper for school and make a blueberry cheesecake but that was about it.  I guess the one good thing that happened today was that I got a copy of the court order showing that although   SFW   was given probate on being thrown in the klink they did not let her off to the tune of $300 bux payable to me.  I probably will not see it but it was nice to see it.  Other then that just another day.

                    I did not post yesterday which is rare that I would miss a day but other then school I had nothing to write about.  Basically I called Karissa and she did not want to talk to me at all.  Not even to say her usualy can I give you hugs and kisses and hang up.  Today I have a little more to write about.  Isn't it interesting how I talk to   SFW   and I have so much more to talk about.    I did talk to Karissa and the conversation went pretty much like I described above other then to say I am tired daddy I did not sleep enough.  I had the fine opportunity to argue with   SFW   today after my conversation with Karissa.  She basically said what days this month do you want to see Karissa since you have to give me 2 week notice (really it is only 1 week and I sent her an email with the court order stating so), when I asked are you going to WA or TX she said I don't know which is bullshit.  The day you plan to leave and you don't know whether you are going South or West?  Is she going to get in the car and drive randomly until she arrives at one of the 2?   I also sent her a copy of the section in the court order where she is once again in contempt by not telling me.  It reads (paraphrasing here) when the move is unintended or could not be forseen you must notify other party as soon as you know about the move within 5 days.  So since the judge gave her 10 days to move my argument is she knew about the move 5 days ago! Not to mention she knows where she is going!   Of course I had to listen to her tell me how I did not care about the kids so why would I wish Jeremey a happy birthday. She told me how I Jimmy missed his sister so much while I had her that he slept in Karissa's bed for 3 days.  To that I said so because Jimmy misses Karissa I am not supposed to miss my daughter?  Because I am a male and could not possibly be a good father or Jimmy's love for his sister is more important then mine is that what you are saying?  That stung but at the same time pissed me off.    What was even better was as I was talking to her she stated that I just want to take Karissa away from her brothers anyway.  In the background in a loud yell I hear "YEAH!" from none other then Jimmy.  I said to   SFW   that I did not feel that was appropriate and she simply said that he knows what is going on I have informed him of it.  I simply responded with first of all your almost 14 year old son does not need to know what is going on in a divorce case.  In addition the stuff you are telling him can and probably does get repeated around Karissa.  This did not seem to affect her decision at all.  She simply said don't worry about it Karissa is not in the room.  She of course ends the call with the whole if I thought it would have ended like this I never would have married you!  Oh not me I know I dreamed of the day that she would kidnap my daughter and the sexual turn on I got from thinking that she would have numerous affairs is what kept me going.  Hell I wish she would have had more!    Please!  You know I was really thinking about things today and I realized what is driving me is 2 things.       I love my daughter and care for her upbringing and the stability in her life   Contrary to   SFW   thinking I am "just trying to make her life hard" I am being cheated out of a relationship with Karissa!  For that I am angry and Jealous!       SFW   wronged me in a way that can never be undone and for that I hope she gets hers...if I can help in that I will!  I don't really know   FS   and in a different situation I might like the guy but he is an unethical and immorral piece of shit and if   SFW   wants to be in love with that more power to her.  After all it is my opinion that "birds of a feather..."  I hope and pray that I can save Karissa from that.  I hope I can get the relationship I deserver to have with my daughter.  She deserves more then what she is going to get with   SFW  !  If I cannot get Karissa maybe I can help another child get to a better place...

                    Today I heard Karissa in the background, after   SFW   answered the phone, saying hooray the phone is for me it is my daddy! She was saying it over and over in a quiet voice.    That really put a smile on my face and made me happy to hear.  Once she was on the phone she did not talk a long time but she while she was on she told me about her boo boo that she received in the pool here was feeling better.  She said she received another one today.  This one hurt a little.  I gave her a kiss over the phone and asked her if it felt better.  She laughed and said daddy it still hurts because you are at your house and I am here at mine.  So you did not really kiss it.  From there she says pretend you are grandpa.  So the rest of the conversation was me trying to pretend I was grandpa.  She finally gave up on that.  I will have to get Gma & Gpa on the phone for her I think that was a sign.    I called Jeremey on the phone to wish him a happy birthday and asked him to eat some cake for me.  I got the impression that talking to me made him uncomfortable.  I think I just need to leave things be and let him contact me if he wants to.  I don't want to stress the boy out he does not need that.    Not that I expect him to ever see this site but I think he deserves at least a little recognition on his birthday    Happy Birthday Jeremey!

                    Karissa and I had a really good conversation today.  I actually had to cut her off when it was time to come to work.  She was just talking and playing on the phone.  In fact she started in on me early.  I said Hello and she then started crying and I knew she was faking but I played it up good like oh my what are you crying for and stuff like that.   She yells into the phone.  "I AM JOKING YOU!" and starts to giggle.  So our phone call went on like that at one point I was pretending I was ordering from McDonalds and she says are you ordering food?  So I said no I am joking you!  She laughed and thought that was pretty funny.    At one point she put the phone down and when she came back she says ow daddy that was not nice and I said what and she said you bonked me on the head and I said I did not.  I said who do you think you are little bunny foo foo and she then played that she was little bunny foo foo and I could not talk to Karissa cause she was bonked on the head.  It was a silly conversation but good.    There were a couple of things that bothered me.  When we first started talking I asked her if she did anything fun today and she put the phone down and I did not hear anything except mommy he wants to know....   She then picked up the phone and said we went swimmming.  Well later in the conversation the same type of thing happened.  I think   SFW   has Karissa clearing what she can and cannot talk about with me.    I mean I will go to almost anything length to get incriminating information that will make   SFW   look bad but I will not involve my 4 year old daughter as a filter to do it.  Maybe I am reading that wrong but it still pisses me off if she is doing that

                    Tonights conversation lasted about as long as a fart in the wind.  It was really nothing more then a Hi and a i'm excited to see you next week and we hung up.  Karissa was not interested in talking.    No biggie it is par for the course.  It used to really bother me that she would not talk to me or whatever but I realize now it is the age and forcing her to talk to me will only cause issues down the road.  So I am back to work for 4 days and I forgot my sweatshirt so it is freezing ass cold in here.  I might have to run home later and get it.  I would have ridden my bike in but I need the derailers fixed or replaced.

                    Well I called Karissa this morning and was able to talk to her for a couple of minutes but since she had just awaken she was not in a talking mood.  I let her go on the premise that daddy will call her later today.  About 12:30 I recieved a call from   SFW   she wanted to go over the drop off and pick up times for Karissa.  She of course wants to know evening or morning and shit like that.  The 17th-24th of this month I did not care it was not a big deal.  I told her morning.    Now here is where I truly appreciate having an soon to be ex-wife like her! She says on Sept 1st you realize you have to get a babysitter don't you (our mediation date is that day) and I said why I figured I would be picking her up after that.  She says "that does not work for me"  I say OK then I guess I will be picking her up that morning then.  Unless you want to let me pick her up the night before?  She says well if I drop her off on the 31st then I want her back the evening of the 7th not the 8th.  I said well I would like to keep her through the 8th if you don't mind. Of course here is where I get it....DRUM ROLL PLEASE.....She says "So I am just going to let you have her for 8 days out of the kindness of my heart!"    First, I would like to state that I doubt there is too much kindness contained within   SFW  !  Second, You have to have a heart to have kindness in it!  I simply said I figured I would be picking her up that afternoon/evening?  She simply says that does not work for me!  So I say why is it that I am a mile away from you and that does not work for you (which really I had no reason to ask, nor did I expect an answer it just came out)? "It just doesn't thats all!"   So I said well since the evening is not convenient for you and I think it will be a little rough on Karissa to get her up and get her to a babysitter all in time for me to meet you at 08:30 that morning whatever works best for you is fine by me!  So she is dropping Karissa off on the 31st and picking her up at 18:00 on the 8th.  Hopefully if things go well she will be visiting on the 8th not picking up!

                    Well I don't know how it happened but I have missed Karissa's call 3 times today.  I missed it on my cell phone because I was in an area with a dead spot.  She called the house twice and somehow I was not around to get her call and of course no message.  I feel bad because I call her everyday and today she called me back wanting to talk to me and was let down.  I know she will get over it and it is the way of the world but I really look forward to my talks with Karissa and I was not here to get her call.    Of course I left calls on the cell phone   SFW   called me on today (a number she never gave me) and of course she never got my message.  When I called the hotel room Karissa was asleep.  Now I know it is 8:45 PM but considering that Karissa has called me almost every night after 9:30 it must of caught up to her.  Naturally Karissa is a mile away and I still cannot see her thanks to   SFW  's demand that I leave them alone and I can be with her on my approved visitation.  I know I have every right to see my daughter but I am opting to avoid a domestic relations issue until the court can decide the issue.  I just feel like I may have let Karissa down.  Logically I know that does not make sense but emotionally that is how I feel. Today I finished my paper for this week and next week so that I can be free to spend time with Karissa.      SFW   must have made a payment for the vehicle as I am now getting phone calls from household again.  Man I hate dealing with those people.  I should not have to if   SFW   was making the payments.  I can only guess with $165 a week at the Hotel, gas, food, and payments for the car that she has found a way to bring in some income on the side (or on her back).  I also called Jeremey today and although I did not get to talk to him left a message that there was a meteor shower that he should be able to see tonight.  Anyway I will try Karissa tomorrow and with any luck I will talk to her tomorrow.    SFW   just hung up after she said smugly "she tried to call you three times"

                    Well today I had the unique privelage of talking to Karissa twice.  The first time she was sitting in front of the TV eating pancakes for breakfast.  We talked a little but not about a whole lot.  Just nice 4 year old chit chat.    I finally asked her if she wanted me to call her later.  She said yes but if I am not here leave me a message daddy.  Well I did just that and at 10 pm I received a call from Karissa and she told me how she spent the day at Sarah's and how there were a bunch of kids there.  Today being Tuesday and the day before school starts it kind of makes me wonder if she is really visiting Sarah who works as a nurse or if she is going to some kind of day care or something while   SFW   does whatever or whomever in search of money for her attorney fees.  Regardless talking to Karissa lately has been extremely pleasant and a lot of fun.

                    Karissa and I talked today although it was not a long talk.  She spent a lot of time talking to Uncle Martha.  When I told her Miss Debbie was coming over she was very excited but I had to tell her she would have to wait til next week to see Miss Debbie.  Other then that the day was pretty uneventful.  With school taking up most of my evening.

                    Karissa called and she started by telling me about her day at the beach and how many sea shells she found, of course no day at the beach would be complete without sand castles.  She also told me the water was freezing.  I apologized to her for putting ice in the water and she giggled at that.  Simply saying you were at home so you did not put the ice in the water.  She asked me to play I spy with her.  I said you silly we can't play I spy you are at your house and I am at my house.  Karissa put down the phone and said Mommy I want to go to daddy's house.  Then she picked up the phone and said daddy I need you to come get me.  I wanted to say "Oh hell yeah be right there!" Instead I simply told her we would need to talk that over with Mommy.  She asked to talk to uncle Martha and I obliged.  She and he talked for a couple of minutes and then she told him she went to Jamba Juice.  He gave me the phone back and I asked if I could have some because her kind was my favorite (I don't even know what kind it was) she said daddy you will have to go get your own and then giggled again.  Other then that we exchanged kisses and hugs and concluded todays conversation.  The rest of my day consisted of nothing more then yard work, laundry, house work, and emptying the pool so I can clean it.  I did go work on a friends computer and while I was doing that he told me that he and his wife are getting a divorce.  I think that sucks there is way to much of the divorce virus running around.  It needs to go away like a bad habit.  The only other thing I guess is I would loved to have had a chance to go to the concert tonight with the guys from work but I am so poor I cannot even afford the 15 dollar tickets.    Oh well there will be other concerts
