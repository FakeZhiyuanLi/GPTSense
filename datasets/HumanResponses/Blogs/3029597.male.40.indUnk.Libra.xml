						   Hey, hey, hey!  Today's show was yet another repeat.  The choice of programs was surprising as it was from early April (almost 2 months ago).  But as shows go, this one was a whopper.  Some choice quotations from The Honz:   This was the program where Fred uses the "1.4 jobs per minute have been created since September" line.  He stated that March employment numbers reflect "the fastest job growth in 4 years."  He sought to deconstruct Senator Kerry's plan to create 10 million new jobs as "a lie."   We will deal with each of these in reverse order.  We could do it in top-down order but Fred's logic is so backwards it seems fitting to do it upside-down.  Fred announced that the 10 million number had to be "a lie" (and that Senator Kerry is a liar for using it) because there aren't 10 million people out of work in the US.  He said that there are only 9.7 million people out of work.  So even if Senator Kerry had an economic program that could create 10 million new jobs, he'd still fall short by 300,000 employees.  He added that Senator Kerry would have to import 300,000 immigrants to make up the difference.  This position is based on a few assumptions.  Primarily, that the Senator's plan would create 10 million new jobs  now .  Right now, this minute.  As there are 9.7 million people out of work  now , this is what Fred must mean.  Of course, Fred is lying about Senator Kerry's employment plan.  MSNBC  urlLink reported  way back in March (before Fred made these statements) that: Kerry...laid down the first plank of an economic platform Friday that he said would create 10 million jobs  in four years ...[emphasis added]   So let's run the numbers.  10 million new jobs in four years translates to an average of 2.5 million new jobs per year.  2.5 million new jobs per year translates to a little over 200,000 new jobs per month.  Incidentally, if one were to take a look at the employment record from President Clinton's second administration, one would see that that economy created on average about 250,000 new jobs per month.  So Fred, what you said was "impossible" is actually quite possible.  It's even been done before - during Bill Clinton's Presidency.  Which brings me to the next point.  Fred stated that the March job figures showed the "fastest job growth in 4 years."  This isn't really a lie of course, but Fred is admitting a couple of things while still trying to hide them.  If it's true that March had the fastest growth in 4 years, that means that growth was  faster  at that time immediately preceeding those 4 years.    Do we need to ask who was the President 4 years ago?  So by saying that job growth in March was the fastest in 4 years, Fred just admitted that if one were to check out the numbers from the Clinton Administration, one would find better job growth numbers.  As Liz would say, "Can I have an amen, somebody?"  We've already dealt with the remaining point. We'll only reiterate that by Fred's own numbers, he said that the Bush economy created just under a half million new jobs in 7 months.  What we didn't say last time is that this is how Fred Honsberger characterized such atrociously bad economic numbers: he said it was "good news" and a "good statistic."  We will keep this in mind whenever we hear Fred starts to boast about the Bush "recovery."

						   It seems that The Honz is on vacation all this week.  This morning PCNC had another repeat.    Feel free to look around at the previous posts on Richard Poe or the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth.  When Fred comes back on live, we are sure there'll be lots to talk about.

						    (May 26, 2004)   Today’s show was a repeat from Thursday, May 13th.  During that program Fred's guest, Richard Poe, said that George Soros, “…considers it improper and extremely dangerous that a man like Bush--a believing Christian--is President.”  While I couldn’t find  that  quote from Soros, I did find that Soros has said, "Bush feels that on September 11th he was anointed by God. He's leading the U.S. and the world toward a vicious circle of escalating violence."  urlLink       - Washington Post    Some might think that disliking Bush because you believe that Bush thinks that God has anointed him is not quite the same thing as disliking him merely because he is a Christian.     And They Said Irony Is Dead    It would seem that the man that the Right (including Honsberger) loves to hate has actually bailed Bush out in the past.  From a David Corn article in  urlLink The Nation:    In 1986, Bush's own oil firm, Spectrum 7, was collapsing. Before it went belly-up, Harken purchased Spectrum for $2.25 million worth of Harken stock and made Bush a Harken director and consultant. That is, Harken saved Bush from ruin.   Why? It wasn't Bush's record as an oil man. He had run two oil companies into the ground. Could it have been Bush's insider credentials as the son of a vice president?   At the time, Harken was owned by global billionaire George Soros, the Harvard Management Corporation, and others.  The article continues:   Later, when I saw the billionaire almost alone, I sidled up to him. "Nice offices," I said. "But can I ask you about some ancient history?" Sure, he said, with a good-natured smile. What was the deal with Harken buying up Spectrum 7? I inquired. Did Soros know Bush back then?   "I didn't know him," Soros replied. "He was supposed to bring in the Gulf connection. But it didn't come to anything. We were buying political influence. That was it. He was not much of a businessman."   Then my time with the billionaire was up. If Soros--who disagrees with most Bush policies--is telling the truth, it means Bush only survived in the corporate jungle because of his surname and connections. Yes, that hardly comes as a surprise. But it does render Bush a purebred embodiment of the central issue of the current business scandals: those on the inside play by a different set of rules than the rest of Americans (including workers and small investors). The market works for Bush--as well as for Martha Stewart and the execs of WorldCom and Enron--in ways others can only imagine, or read about, once in a great while, in an indictment.   Had it not been for Soros and his Harken partners, what might have become of George the Younger? Because a liberal billionaire and his corporate allies sought political juice in 1986--for they knew the business world is no meritocracy--Bush's corporate career was artificially inflated. Consequently, he was able to enter politics, citing his business experience, and land in a position where he could implement policies that make Soros gag. (O. Henry would enjoy this turnabout.)

						   Today's show is a repeat from the 12th.  Check out the first entry in this blog for comments on this show.  Not mentioned there, however, is Fred's use of the phrase 'Iraqi Naked Twister' to describe the torture at Abu Ghraib prison.

						   Today's show was a repeat (from 5-5-04) so there's nothing new to report.  However, Fred did have a few interesting things to say.  In a rather heated discussion at the end of the broadcast, Fred said these two things:   Bush has released all his military records. Kerry has not. I began this mini-project with something in the back of my mind.  I'd read in the  urlLink Pittsburgh City Paper  a few weeks back (at the end of April) about something called a DD-214.   urlLink Marty Levine  interviewed an honorably discharged veteran who stated that the Bush campaign had not released Bush's DD-214.  The DD-214 would spell out completely the reasons for the discharge, any commendations and so on.  While it  is  true that the Bush Campaign hasn't released Bush's DD-214, there's a reason for it:  Being in the Air National Guard, Bush wouldn't have gotten a DD-214.  As far as I can tell, his discharge form is is called an ANG-22.  And the Bush Campaign has released that form.  Well, so much for that.  By the way, here's Kerry's  urlLink DD-214  and Bush's  urlLink ANG-22 .  You will notice, of course, that the list of Kerry's records is vastly larger than Bush's.  So if Fred is correct in saying that Kerry hasn't released ALL of his records, he has to explain how the list of Bush's records is actually smaller.  I guess (at least in this instance) that size does matter!  There is a comparision of the released Military Records of each candidate  urlLink here .  Boy, this is a murky thing to research.  The main problem in doing so is the difficulty finding non-partisan websites for source material.  As much as I love reading at the site, I am reluctant to quote from  urlLink Awolbush.com  for obvious reasons.  I'll keep digging and whatever I find, I'll post here.  Fred also said that the question as to whether Bush had been AWOL had been resolved to the satisfaction of the major media - and that he wasn't AWOL.  On that point, Fred is obviously wrong.   urlLink Here's  what the Boston Globe reported after the release of the Military records in early February:   WASHINGTON - After days of hesitation, the White House last night made public what it said were all of President Bush's military records. But the records seemed to add virtually no new information about Bush's stint in the Texas Air National Guard that concluded with a final year of sporadic duty and an early return in 1973 to civilian life.    An initial review of the more than 300 pages found no additional documentation about why Bush went months without attending required drills while he was living in Montgomery, Ala., and at his home base in Houston between May 1972 and May 1973.  The documents also do not clear up another mystery about Bush's military service: why then First Lieutenant Bush, a fighter-interceptor pilot, did not take his required annual flight physical examination in mid-1972. On Aug. 1, 1972, he was suspended from flight status for not taking the physical, and never flew again.   But, you say, The Boston Globe was the paper to break the story (back in 2000) so they have a vested interest in supporting their own reporting, right.  Perhaps.  But  urlLink here's  The Washington Post from the middle of February.  About 8 paragraphs down we read:   But the hundreds of pages of documents did little to answer questions about Bush's military history. Why, for example, is there no definitive documentation -- except a single dental exam -- that places Bush at Dannelly Air National Guard Base in 1972-73 and shows how he performed his temporary duty in the Alabama Guard?    Hmmm...  The Boston Globe and the Washington Post  both  say that the question is still open.  How is it that Fred can say that the matter is closed as far as the major media is concerned?  How 'bout it, Fred?  Is there something I missed?  Has the Boston Globe and/or the Washington Post published anything new about this?

						   Today, The Honz raised the issue of Senator Kerry's "support" of a 50 cent per gallon gas tax.  HL has addressed this point before, but I think since Fred's brought it up AGAIN, we have to address it AGAIN.  First, here's the source of the story, a  urlLink Bush Ad :   He (Kerry) supported a 50 cent a gallon gas tax.  If Kerry’s tax increase were law, the average family would pay $657 more a year.   Presumably, Fred is talking about this.  Second, Senator Kerry's  urlLink website  says this about this story:   John Kerry never introduced, co-sponsored or passed a fifty-cent gas tax.    But let's be honest, that says nothing about whether he  supported  such a tax.  So we'll have to dig deeper.   urlLink Factcheck.org  , a group that describes itself as "a nonpartisan, nonprofit, "consumer advocate" for voters that aims to reduce the level of deception and confusion in U.S. politics" says  urlLink this  about that claim:   Kerry's support  for a 50-cent-per-gallon increase in the federal tax on gasoline was so brief and lukewarm that it was barely noted at the time -- a decade ago. One Boston Globe news story from 1994 quotes Kerry as complaining that the Concord Coalition's scorecard had not rated him highly enough as a deficit-cutter: "It doesn’t reflect my $43 billion package of cuts or my support for a 50-cent increase in the gas tax," the Globe quoted Kerry as saying. But neither the Bush-Cheney campaign nor FactCheck.org turned up any direct report of how and when Kerry had actually backed the 50-cent increase. Kerry sponsored no such bill in the Senate, and did not add his name to a bill offered by Sen. Charles Robb in 1993, to increase the gasoline tax 10 cents per gallon each year for five years.  And MSNBC  urlLink notes  that in 1994:  Kerry was referring to a proposal by democratic Sen. Chuck Robb to substitute a dime-a-year increase in the 14.1-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax over five years as Congress looked for ways to cut the deficit. Kerry never voted for the measure, which was spearheaded by Robb.   So Kerry never voted for Senator Robb's measure.  So how can The Honz say that he's still supporting the idea?  That's a good question for Fred Honsberger to answer, I'd say.  What about it, Fred?  How is it possible for John Kerry to support a tax that he  never  voted for?  But wait, there's more.  An internet search did turn up some interesting things.  At the Kerry  urlLink dbunker website , they point out that some of the President's own also supported raising gas taxes.  For instance, Attorney General John Ashcroft, when he was Governor of Missouri, signed into law a 6 cent per gallon increase in the state gas tax over four years.  At the signing, he hailed the measure as "the great economic development tool of the decade.” [St. Louis Post-Dispatch, 2/21/92]  So what do we have here?  Fred has been spending a lot of time recently criticising a Senator who, a decade ago, briefly supported a measure that he no longer supports for a tax bill that was introduced by a man who hasn't been a Senator for almost 4 years.  On the other hand, he is silent about the Attorney General who so clearly supported a gas tax increase that he actually signed it into law.  That's amazing, Fred.  You're dancing so fast, I can't even see your feet move.

						   It's late in the day and I am tired, so I'll try to make this quick.    As Liz mentioned a few posts back, The Honz had a guest on his program named Richard Poe.  Poe was on "Honsberger Live" to discuss his recent article on George Soros.  I just found an amazing  urlLink interview  Poe did with a website called  urlLink Frontpagemag.com .  I linked to both the interview and the main page of the website so that no one can mistake the interview for a fake.  I won't reprint the whole thing here.  I'll just paste a few of Mr Poe's tragically ignorant (if they weren't so unintentionally comic) comments.  Here's an interesting tidbit.  He characterizes Senator Hillary Clinton was the "muscle end of the Clinton Mafia" during the Clinton Administrations.  Barbara Olson (wife of current Solicitor General Ted Olson - she was one of the people murdered during the 9/11 attacks) was convinced that Senator Clinton had, "among other things, conspired to use the Federal Bureau of Investigation unlawfully to intimidate, punish, harass, frame and otherwise harm innocent people who stood in her way."  At that point Mr Poe is asked: How did Hillary get away with all of this? Surely Ken Starr would have jumped on any excuse to indict Hillary, no?  And this is what Richard Poe said:  I will quote this in its entirety.   Well, as I explain in my book, there are two Ken Starrs. There’s the imaginary Ken Starr conjured up by Big Media – a ruthless, rightwing religious zealot, bent on toppling the Clintons. Then there’s the real Ken Starr – a timid bureaucrat, afraid of his own shadow, who shrank from investigating any of the truly serious Clinton scandals. On the contrary, Starr actively helped to suppress and whitewash evidence of Clinton wrongdoing. I wonder how many conservatives really believe that Ken Starr helped supress evidence of Clinton's wrongdoing?  Do you believe it, Fred?  If so you should tell us.  And if not, you should challenge Mr Poe on his allegations about Ken Starr.  They seem to be rather serious.  Poe then goes on to talk about the murder of Vince Foster, assert that the Starr invenstigative team was "infiltrated" by Clinton Loyalists, and that the Clinton Impeachment was a charade.    There's one more: Richard Poe alleges that it is Hillary Clinton (along with her "Shadow Team" of private detectives) who is now trying to frame Rush Limbaugh on drug charges.  By the way, today a caller asked Fred whether he'd ever have Richard Poe back on as a guest.  If my memory serves, The Honsman agreed.

						   Today (5/19/04) Fred Honsberger made the following claims.  When I get some free time I'll be trying to track down their sources.  1) Saddam Hussein "outsourced" his nuclear weapons program to Libya and so that's why no nuclear weapons were found in Iraq.  2) Saddam Hussein shipped at least some of his WMD to the Bekaa Valley in Syria controlled Lebanon, and so that's why no chemical weapons were found in Iraq.  He also mentioned something about an mid-east connection to the Oklahoma City Bombing via "John Doe II" a man no one has been able to find or identify.  Wow, it's been about a decade since the bombing.  This guy must be good at hiding.  If you have any news source for any of these, please drop me a note.  I'm at getzen85@yahoo.com.

						   Thus spake Fred.    I haven't been paying close enough attention to this, but somehow it seems as though The Honz is using "You can believe what you want to believe" more and more as a antidote against being on the losing side of an argument.  However, I could be wrong about how often he's been doing this recently.  In any case, he used it a number of times today.  When presenting some outlandish Right-wing conspiracy theories (here's a typical one: Saddam sent his WMD to the Bekaa Valley to hide them), Fred has been vaccinating against the inevitable disagreeing caller by adding, "You can believe what you want to believe."  But what does that mean, exactly?  As Liz pointed out here recently, it's true meaning is difficult to fathom.   Its usage, though, allows the speaker to acknowledge a disagreement without ever having to address it.  Contrary evidence?  Doesn't matter.  Flaws of logic?  Doesn't matter either.  Why not?  Because you can believe what you want to believe.  See how easy that was?  This line of "reasoning" might be ok in aesthetics (Beatles or Stones - who was better?) or religion (Is the universe better described by The Christian Bible or the Bhagavad Gita?), but when human lives are at stake, as they are in Iraq, this sort of epistemological relativity is woefully inadequate if not dangerous.  Unfortunately, the Bush Administration seems to be have been following the same track in the lead up to the Iraq war.  Would our troops in Iraq be seen as liberators or occupiers?  Some said the latter.  The Administration said (in effect) "You can believe what you want to believe, but we believe they'll be greeted as liberators and that settles it."  Settled, indeed.  Here's a more concrete example to show the inadequacy of the YCBWYWTB defense.  Imagine going to the Dr. for an annual check up.  Would you be at all comfortable hearing the Dr. say, "Some people believe that the common cold is a mild viral infection involving the nose and respiratory passages.  You can believe what you want to believe but I choose to believe that the common cold is a specific imbalance of the 4 bodily humors: blood, phleghm, choler, and black bile."

						   Provocative title, no?  This phrase has been slung around quite a bit on the "Honsberger Live" show lately.   On Thursday of last week, a guest told a caller that he hated America simply it seemed because the person defended moveon.org.  The caller emailed Honsberger and his letter was read on Friday’s show.  In the email, the question was posed as to whether or not Honsberger agreed with the guest’s assessment as to who hated America.  Honsberger mostly sidestepped the question, but he made a few interesting comments in doing so:   "I am not a missionary."  "I give the truth from my perspective."  Anyone who keeps a picture of John Kerry with the international symbol for "no" over Kerry’s face on his set every show would surely seem to be on a mission of some sort.  Also, I don’t even know how to begin to understand the second statement.  I mean the truth from my perspective is that Fred lies an awful lot so I guess that means it’s so.  Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Friday’s program was how many people called in on the after hours line to voice their dismay that yet one more Bushie was labeling those on the other side of being American Haters.  While Honsberger tried to present himself as being reasonable on this issue last week, he couldn’t help but give a shout out on Tuesday to "...all of you America Haters out there..."  I guess it’s just too darn hard for any Bush Lover to go for very long without descending into ad hominem attacks on the patriotism of anyone who dares to disagree with them.

						   Today's program was a mixed bag as most of the hour was devoted to a non-issue, the "soaring" gas prices.  When adjusted for  urlLink inflation , the current gas prices are far below the price paid 20 years ago.  It's even lower than it was 25 years ago.  Indeed, it's been more or less constant for about 18 years.  On a more partisan note, I couldn't help but notice that the lowest price (again, adjusted for inflation) occurred late in the second Clinton Administration.  After that (by which I mean the Bush Administration) prices bounced back up again.  To his credit, Fred DID point out that when you adjust for inflation, gas prices aren't as bad as they once were.  But then he spent most of the hour taking calls from people railing against the soaring prices, anyway.  The interesting Honzman-ism occurred late in the show when he trotted out the old Bush-critique that Senator Kerry "supported raising taxes 11 time."  Later in the show, he changed the verb to "voted for."    Needless to say, "supported" and "voted for" are two very different things - something that was pointed out to The Honz by an astute caller.  To which he responded, "Support, vote.  What's the difference?"  There's a lot of difference, Fred.  Let me explain it to you.  If Senator Kerry spoke on the Senate Floor 11 times in support of a bill he voted for once, would you say that he "voted for" the bill eleven times or did he vote for it once?  And would you say he "supported" the bill eleven times or just once?  See?  It's easy.  But that's a hypothetical.  Let's take a look at what Fred said.  He said that Reuters reported that Kerry supported (or "voted for" - I mean really, what's the difference?) raising taxes 11 times.  Today (May 18, 2004) Reuters DID have an article with the "11 times" data.   urlLink Here  it is.  However, you'll have to look way down towards the end of the piece - 15 paragraphs to be precise to see the reference to "11 times."  And THIS is what's in that paragraph:   Bush and his Republican allies, who portray the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee as a chronic waffler and a fence-straddling political opportunist, said Kerry had supported higher gas prices at least 11 times in the Senate.   So Reuters was quoting "Bush and his Republican allies" rather than making the statement outright.  When challenged on the source of the information, Fred today asked the caller, "So are you saying that Reuters is wrong?"  No, Fred.  You're the one who's wrong.  You presented the source of the information as Reuters, when the source is actually the Bush Campaign.  And that was a lie.    But this still doesn't answer the question as to what Senator Kerry DID (or did not) do 11 times.  And to that we turn to Foxnews.com.  More than a month and a half ago (on April 6 2004), And here is what Foxnews  urlLink posted  on their website.  I believe it's an AP news story, by the way.  Here's the important stuff:   For example, a Bush ad says Kerry "supported higher gasoline taxes 11 times." But nine of those cases dealt with the same increase, a 4.3-cents-a-gallon hike enacted in 1993 as part of a deficit-cutting package, the Annenberg Public Policy Center found in its analyses of claims and counterclaims by Bush and Democrats.   Five of those votes were cast as the bill moved from one stage to the other; another four came between 1996 and 2000 as Republicans tried to repeal the increase. The 11 examples include a time, in 1994, when Kerry briefly endorsed someone else's proposal to raise the gas tax by 50 cents. It never came to a vote.   So what do we have here?  We have a misleading statistic that's been debunked in an AP news story 6 weeks ago.  And yet Fred is still trotting it out as if,   1) it was new news and  2) it was true.  Fred, you really have to do better than this.    This is just too easy, my friend.

						   There's some evidence that The Honz himself has seen this blog!  Welcome aboard, Fred!  Feel free to comment on anything written here.  Here's what I'm basing this assumption on:  Today Fred pulled out a piece of paper saying that someone had e-mailed him with a question about Nick Berg not wearing a uniform and the Geneva Convention.    And this is how I ended one of yesterday's postings:   So, Fred. I need to ask you: What would you say if someone at Al-Jazeera claimed that since Nick Berg wasn't in uniform, wasn't a member of a militia and so on, that his beheading wasn't a war crime?  I realize it's a stretch, but I'm pretty sure he's aware of the blog.

						   Today, Fred addressed the issue of the Geneva Conventions in relation to the treatment of Iraqis in the now infamous Abu Graib prison.  His call-in guest was a man named Mike Ritz who is the co-owner of a company called  urlLink Team Delta .  The Baltimore Sun describes Team Delta as "a private, Pennsylvania-based program that runs interrogation workshops for law enforcement officers."  Here's the  urlLink link  to the article with the quotation.  Mr. Ritz, with the tacit support of The Honz himself, spelled out which prisoners are entitled to the protections outlined in the Geneva Conventions - specifically, those adopted in August of 1949.  The only people entitled to protection, according to Mr. Ritz and the Honz are those who fulfill the following qualities:   That of being commanded by a person responsible for his subordinates;  That of having a fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance;  That of carrying arms openly;  That of conducting their operations in accordance with the laws and customs of war.   This comes straight out of the  urlLink  Geneva Convention Article 4, Section 2 .  The Honz leads us to believe that since the people being held at the prison are not "carrying arms openly" or "having a fixed distictive sign" and so on, then invoking the Geneva Convention is unnecessary.   What The Honz and Mr. Ritz failed to mention, however, is the text of the very next article -   urlLink Article 5 .  It states pretty clearly that if there's any doubt as to whether someone fits the above categories of article 4, they're still entitled to the protections the Geneva Conventions offer, until deemed otherwise.  Here is the text:   Should any doubt arise as to whether persons, having committed a belligerent act and having fallen into the hands of the enemy, belong to any of the categories enumerated in Article 4, such persons shall enjoy the protection of the present Convention until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal.    When was the tribunal designating the guy with the panties on his head NOT a prisoner of war?  Did I miss that news report?    By the way,  urlLink Article 3   also states:   To this end the following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever with respect to the above-mentioned persons:  (a) Violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture;  (b) Taking of hostages;  (c) Outrages upon personal dignity, in particular, humiliating and degrading treatment;  (d) The passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.   So, Fred.  I need to ask you:  What would you say if someone at Al-Jazeera claimed that since Nick Berg wasn't in uniform, wasn't a member of a militia and so on, that his beheading  wasn't  a war crime?  Quoting only some parts of the Geneva Conventions (while ignoring others) in order to diminish their importance is at best misleading and at worst intellectually dishonest.

						   On today's program, The Honz made an interesting rhetorical sleight-of-hand.  In professing to address the issue of gay marriage (today being the first day of legalized gay marriage in Massachusuetts), he consistently diverted the issue AWAY from something formerly illegal (in Massachusuetts anyway) something still illegal - Polygamy.    The calls went something like this:  Caller:  I don't personally agree with gay marriage, but I believe that people should be allowed to do what they want.  The Honz: So how far can we as a society go?  If we allow a man and a man to marry, why shouldn't we allow a man and a woman and a woman to marry?  Or a man and a man and a woman and a woman?  And then any attempt to bring the discussion back to the original topic (Gay Marriage) on the part of the caller was met with static from The Honz...  The Honz: Why won't you answer my question?  It's the same thing!  We're discussing the redefinition of marriage!  And so on.  While watching, we were honestly expecting the discourse to shift away from gay marriage through polygamy to bestiality and finally and inevitably to Pedophilia.  Such shallow hyperbole is common in this issue.    To his credit, The Honz DID NOT continue down that particular slippery slope.  Although the "if you agree with gay marriage then you have to agree with polygamy" argument doesn't really address gay marriage at all, does it?  Of course, This sort of "debate" is designed to work backwards:  If you support the right of a homosexuals to marry then the only way to avoid being inconsistent is to support the right of a man to marry two women (or three or four, or perhaps an entire villiage!).  It places the caller in a rhetorical bind that effectively shifts the discussion so far away from the topic at hand that it never gets addressed.

						    Thursday’s Show (5/13/04)   Well I found yesterday’s show to be ‘vintage’ Honsberger.  Aside from what Mike has mentioned:  1.	Fred told a caller that he was, “absolutely wrong” when the caller said Berg was beheaded in retaliation for the abuse of Iraqi prisoners.  Fred based his arguments on two things:  That Berg was kidnapped before the media storm on the torture and that reporter, Daniel Pearl, had also been beheaded.  First while I am somewhat tempted to believe that the Honzman can read the minds of the terrorists because he shares a similar rigid, black & white view of the world, there is no way that he could be absolutely certain of the motives of these people.  Secondly, while Nick Berg was kidnapped before the pictures from the notorious Abu Ghraib jail came to light, that does not necessarily mean that they had intended to behead him from the start.  And thirdly, not everyone who has been kidnapped has been beheaded.  2. When the same caller asked Honsberger why they (terrorists?  Islamisists? The Middle East?) hated us, Fred replied, “We’ve done nothing to them.”  Can I have a witness?  While not in any way excusing the beheading of Berg or terrorism in general, to say that we’ve done nothing objectionable in the Middle East is a lie of the highest sort.  A short catalog of our abuse could include:   - The U.S. overthrew Prime Minister Mossadeq of Iran and installed the Shah as dictator.  - The U.S. trained Osama bin Laden and fellow terrorists to kill Soviets. The CIA gave them $3 billion in ‘aid.’ - We provided billions in aid to Saddam Hussein for weapons to kill Iranians.  - The White House secretly gave Iran weapons to help them kill Iraqis. (Just which side were we on?!?) - Iraq invaded Kuwait with weapons from the U.S. - We bomb Iraq for invading Kuwait even though US Ambassador, April Gillespie, basically told Hussein that his fight with Kuwait would be considered “an internal matter.”  Bush 41 then reinstated the dictator of Kuwait. - American planes bombed Iraq on a weekly basis throughout the ‘90s. (U.N. estimates 500,000 Iraqi children die from the bombing and sanctions.) - Bush 43 gave Taliban-ruled Afghanistan $245 million in "aid". - We can’t possibly be considered as neutral in the Israel/Palestine conflict.  Can I have an Amen, somebody?  3. In his continuing effort to provide his viewers with worthwhile and informative guests, Richard Poe, author and Newsmax.com contributor called in for an interview.  While savaging George Soros, Poe compared people on the Left to those in this country who stayed loyal to King George during the Revolutionary War and who would one day face, ‘the Ultimate Judge.’ He went so far as to tell a caller who defended  urlLink moveon.org  that, “There are some people like me who love this country and there are some people like you who hate this country.”  Honsberger’s only comment on that disgusting statement was along the lines of everyone’s entitled to their opinion. Ugh!

						   The Honzman did it again today - a number of times.  Today's aren't the big huge lies that we're growing to expect from the Honz, but as they're more numerous than usual we'll spend a little time on each.  1) A news clip was shown today to point out how "muted" the response to the horrific beheading of Nick Berg was in the Arab world.  An editor of the Egyptian Al-Ahram was interviewed for a comment.  Fred pointed out, in support of his position the tepid nature of the Arab response, that Al-Ahram isn't even covering the murder!  Now doesn't that show how cruel they are?  Well...  If you take a look at the Al-Ahram  urlLink website , you'll see that it's a  weekly  not a daily.  As the murder only occured a few days ago, it shouldn't be a surprise that a weekly news source wouldn't have any mention of it on the website.  Obviously, all this changes if Al-Ahram fails to mention the murder in its next issue.  And it's quite possible that what Fred said might amazingly turn out to be the case.  But at the present time, The Honz was presenting something as true, when he couldn't possibly have known whether it was.  It follows along his basic MO.  State something as obvious and hope that no one checks up on it.  2) He pointed out something that he said hadn't made it onto the major media.  It was his example of how the major (read: Liberal) media is biased in favor of Islam.  It was an AP story (but hey, isn't the AP  major media ?) a protest of Moslems in Najaf "urging" Sadr to leave that city.  So far  urlLink USAToday ,  urlLink MSNBC , and The  urlLink Boston Globe  all picked up the AP story.  At each of these links, just hit Ctl-F and then type in "Black Veils" and you'll see exactly the same sentence.  They were all from the same AP news story.  The Dallas Morning News and the Atlanta Journal Constitution and Salon.com also ran the AP story, but since they're subscription sites, I didn't want to waste your time with them.  By the way, I found all this material with a google search on:  "1,000 people" +marched +Najaf +Tuesday +"Muqtada al-Sadr"  So I'm not sure what Fred means when he said that none of the major news media picked up the coverage.  But it all follows along his basic MO: State something as obviously true and hope that no one checks up on it.  He did this when he said that 1.4 jobs/minute created in the last 7 months (which was  technically  true, but hardly good news) as well as the stuff Liz pointed out earlier.  3) He said that Theresa Heinz was funding her husband's campaign and so the public does have a right to delve into her personal life/finances.  In exactly the same way that the public  doesn't  have the right to look at First Lady Laura Bush's personal life/finances.  In any event, the FEC fundraising rules are very clear.  Each person has a $2,000 maximum for donating to a political campaign.  And according to the "Neighbor Search" at  urlLink fundrace.org , Theresa Heinz-Kerry has given (now wait for it) $2,000.    If Fred has any more real data he should deliver it.  As I am sure he knows, giving more than $2,000 is against the law and if he has evidence that Theresa Heinz has broken the law, he has an obligation to get that evidence to the authorities.  Until he does deliver that evidence, I think we can safely assume he's full of crap.

						    Wednesday's Show (5/12/04)   A couple of glaring misstatements by Honsberger:  1. Repeatedly asserted that the beheading of Nick Berg had not yet been reported by Al Jazeera when in fact the story had been posted on their website as least as early as 4 AM ET that morning.  Click here for article   2. When a caller to the show asked why our Government let just anybody go into a war zone and stated (correctly) that Berg had gone to Iraq looking for a job, the Honzman insisted that Berg was being employed by the Government as a contractor.  As too often happens on the show, the caller eventually backed down--assuming perhaps that a host of a TV show couldn't be so blatantly wrong?  One wonders if Fred was more intent on demonstrating that there isn't an unemployment problem in this country or that security isn't a problem in Iraq under the US occupation?  My guess:  He was going for a twofer!   Additional Note: While the host correctly stated that Kerry had missed a vote in the Senate to extend unemployment benefits which caused the defeat of the Bill, he 'forgot' to mention that Kerry (and anyone else who was paying attention) knew that the Bill had no chance of passing in  the House.

						   Fred Honsberger today (on his television program) stated that  The Toronto Star  had proven a link between al-qaeda and Iraq.  Truly Earth-shattering news.  And if true, it would certainly rewrite the history of this administrations war with Iraq.   urlLink Here  is the article.  But before you e-mail a copy to your member of Congress, take a look at the article's date.  It says that this was published on April 27, 2003.  As this is May 11, 2004, it's easy to see that the article is a little more than a year old.  So it's not new news by any definition of the word "new."  So the Bush Administration has known this for more than a year and yet it chose not to leak it or discuss it at all.  Indeed George Bush has even stated that there's no link between Saddam and al-qaeda.  So what does The Honzman know that Bush (who has access to one of the world's largest intelligence communities) doesn't?  Boiling it down to it's simplest terms, if Fred Honsberger is right then his President is lying.  But things get more interesting.  The Honzman uses the  Toronto Star  to validate the story.  If it's in a paper as reputable as  The Toronto Star  then, by golly, it has to be true.  Except that it's not.  And  urlLink here  in  The Toronto Star , Tim Harper writes this:  "...Dick Cheney, is a drag on the ticket, successive polls show, tarnished by his dogged insistence that weapons of mass destruction could still be found in Iraq and his refusal to acknowledge that there is no link between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda."  So right there in the same paper, there's the phrase "there is no link between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda."  So which is it, Fred?  Mike

						   While not actually a LIE, this story shows the level of respect The Honz holds for the truth and his audience.    On his TV show in the beginning of April, he was trying to convince a caller that the employment picture was better than the caller was implying.  And to show this, The Honz said, there were "1.4 jobs per minute created since September."  While that seemed to silence the caller, a few minutes with a calculator shows how The Honz deals with facts.  Since he said this at the beginning of April, I am assuming that he was talking about that time period between the beginning of September and the end of March.  There are 212 days in those months this year (which is a leap year and so February has 29 days) and 212 days = 5088 hours = 305,280 minutes.  So if 1.4 jobs PER MINUTE were created in that time, that means that only 427,392 jobs were created (305,280 x 1.4 = 427,392).  So The Honz was trying to spin the economy's employment numbers by saying that less than half a million jobs had been created in the 7 months between September and March.  But wait, it gets better.  A minute or so before the "1.4" number was thrown around, he was boasting that 360,00 jobs had been created in March ALONE.  So taking out the calculator again, we find that about 430K jobs created from September-March minus the 360K jobs created in March leaves us with about 70,000 jobs created in the months between September and February.  And Fred was BOASTING about this??  It's just plain obvious that he was counting on no one checking his numbers.    Mike

						      There was more Moore on today's show.  By the way he has yet to mention (much less repudiate) the RNC's Hitler ad.  Day Two and still waiting, Fred.  Fred had a call-in guest today, one  urlLink David T Hardy .  He's got an interesting website.  He's a critic of the Government who spent nearly a decade (guess which decade?) working in Government.  An author who's penned a book on the Government's response to Waco, he's now going after  urlLink Michael Moore .  Perusing his webpages we find some very interesting things.  At the top of the Michael Moore website, we see this:   The website that dares to ask: Should a 320 pound man advise us on evils of overconsumption?    This offensive question is supposed to be humorous.  While there may be room for real debate about Moore's work, such an  ad hominem  attack speaks more about the character of the man using it than about its supposed target.  It has no place in civil discourse.  He includes a  urlLink brief description  about himself that also contains some interesting items.  He says he tends to agree with the "classical republicans, " those men and women who believe that: man achieves his highest state as part of a polity, a nation state--a man without a nation is indeed an empty creature. He also feels that: that polity owes duties to its citzens--duties to avoid killing them, lying to them, behaving unjustly or dishonorably toward them.   That being said, we wonder if he has any information as to where Bush's WMD are.  Or what he thinks about the administration outing the CIA agent.  Maybe we should  urlLink ask him .  Maybe not.    So much for the introduction.  Mr. Hardy, who's been a critic of Moore's since the Academy Award-winning "Bowling for Columbine", takes the usual pokes at the filmmaker.  Where he grew up, how much money he has and so on.  Tired stuff, really.  We guess it's supposed to undermine the credibility of the moviemaker and therefore "Fahrenheit 911".  As for his direct criticism of the movie itself, it wasn't anything we haven't seen elsewhere - but that's not a criticism.  All we can say is that there's little that's new about it.  There's the part about the school principal.  The case the movie makes is undermined (or so Hardy and The Honz say) by the fact that Moore never interviewed the principal of the grade school where Bush took that book-reading-wait-seven-minutes-doing-nothing-after-hearing-that-the-WTC-had-been-hit-by-two-planes photo op.  The Principal now says she'd still vote for Bush.  Fine that's her right (unless her name resembles some felon's name in Florida - then all bets are off).  But how does that change the fact that Bush sat there for 7 minutes?  Where's the lie?  Where's the misrepresentation?  We're confused.  The big moment came when Mr Hardy took time to correct (what he said was) Moore's assertion that the White House flew members of the Saudi Royal and bin Laden families out of the country during the flight embargo immediately after 9/11.  Mr Hardy said that, in fact, they were flown out of the country "two weeks" later.  In fact the movie does not make that assertion at all.  Take a look at  urlLink this .  However, when corrected by an astute caller (the flights out of the country were actually two  days  after 911 and there  were  internal flights for the Saudis during the embargo), he backtracked.  He said he wasn't talking about  all  flights, just the  international  ones.  Honestly, we didn't hear the un-spoken word "international" when he presented his case.  Oops - our bad.    We're still confused.  What was Mr Hardy trying to say?  When he claimed that Moore said the Saudis were flown out of the country  during  the embargo, he was wrong. He seemed to admit to that when corrected by the afore-mentioned astute caller.  So he presented something as the truth that he knew to be false.  Is that called "lying?"  Later, after the Hardy phone call, The Honz brought up the ACT voter-registration  urlLink story .  He quoted the AP piece by David Lieb by describing how ACT (a political group opposed to the current administration) has hired felons to go door-to-door to register voters.  He omitted (and Fred always omits something) this part of the story: Since spring, "our policy has been that we're not going to employ violent felons," the group's Washington-based spokesman Mo Elliethee said Thursday. "We're going to conduct this background check to ensure we're not."  So the problem, if there even was one, is solved.  Isn't it?  We enjoyed watching Fred Honsberger deride, in no uncertain terms, the idea of giving convicted felons "a second chance."  It was very funny and very to the point.  To paraphrase, it's a joke for anyone, (ACT included, of course) to even think it's OK to cut a a convicted felon a break.  We guess Fred Honsberger then disagrees with this:  We know from long experience that if they can't find work, or a home, or help, they [prison imates] are much more likely to commit more crimes and return to prison. So tonight, I propose a four-year, 300 million dollar Prisoner Re-Entry Initiative to expand job training and placement services, to provide transitional housing, and to help newly released prisoners get mentoring, including from faith-based groups. America is the land of the second chance, and when the gates of the prison open, the path ahead should lead to a better life.  It's from a recent State of the Union Address.  The person giving the State of the Union Address is the Republican Candidate for President of the United States, George W. Bush.  Take a  urlLink look .   You really need to do better than this, Fred.

						             Predictions for Today     Prediction     We predict that Fred will continue to misrepresent "Fahrenheit 911" for a while.  He'll probably keep calling it "Fahrenheit 7-11" and he'll probably keep thinking, "Fahrenheit 7-11 instead of Fahrenheit 911,  Now that's funny!"   Follow-up   The other day Fred pointed out how NBC had debunked Fahrenheit 911.  It ended up he was referring to a "truth squad" report by Lisa Myers.  We mentioned it  urlLink yesterday  and after searching around for a bit we found a transcript.  It was used as one of the segments on the June 25th edition of " urlLink Countdown " on MSNBC (a program we generally like).  In its entirety, here is the transcript:   NARRATOR:  The true story that will make your temperature rise.   LISA MYERS, NBC CHIEF CONGRESSIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over):  But how true is it?  The film‘s sometimes embarrassing video of Bush administration officials is authentic.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, “FAHRENHEIT 9/11”)  JOHN ASHCROFT, ATTORNEY GENERAL (singing):  Let the Eagle soar. (END VIDEO CLIP)  MYERS:  Though some argue certain shots amount to cheap shots.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, “FAHRENHEIT 9/11”)  GEORGE W. BUSH, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I call upon all nations to do everything they can to stop these terrorist killers.  Thank you.  Now watch this drive.   (END VIDEO CLIP)  MYERS:  The powerful story of Lila Lipscomb, whose son was killed in Iraq, is also undeniable.  But, on other key points, critics say this so-called documentary is either wrong or deliberately misleading.  The war in Iraq, to drive home the point that the children of the powerful aren‘t dying in Iraq, Moore ambushes politicians on Capitol Hill.   (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, “FAHRENHEIT 9/11”)  MICHAEL MOORE, FILMMAKER:  Congressman, Michael Moore.  How you doing? (CROSSTALK)  MOORE:  Good.  Good.  I‘m trying to get members of Congress to get their kids to enlist in the Army and go over to Iraq.   (END VIDEO CLIP)  MYERS:  But Moore left out what Congressman Mark Kennedy went on to say.   REP. MARK KENNEDY ®, MINNESOTA:  My nephew had just gotten called into service and was told he‘s heading to Afghanistan.  He didn‘t like that answer, so he didn‘t include it.   MYERS:  Bush and the Saudis.  The film trades ties between the Bush and bin Laden and Saudi royal families, then suggests the Bushes—quote - ·         “might be thinking about what‘s best for the Saudis, instead of what is best for you.” ROGER CRESSEY, MSNBC COUNTERTERRORISM ANALYST:  The Bush family‘s relationship with the bin Ladens and the Saudis had nothing to with do with our decisions in the war on terrorism.  To so say so is simply unfair.   MYERS:  Finally, Saudi flights after 9/11.  The film suggests that planeloads of Saudis, including the bin Laden family, were allowed to leave the U.S. after 9/11 without proper vetting.   However, the 9/11 Commission says, “Nobody was allowed to depart who the FBI wanted to interview.” (on camera):  One character in this film suggests that President Bush is even worse than Osama bin Laden, one of the excesses and distortions that may undermine the credibility of Michael Moore‘s message. Lisa Myers, NBC News, Washington.  That's it.  That's Fred's evidence from NBC supporting his claim that the "liberal media" has now turned against Michael Moore.  But did you notice what Fred did?  He only mentioned the critical parts of the piece, while editing out everything else (for instance, that the videos of the administration are "authentic" though "embarrassing" and that Lila Lipscomb's story is "powerful" and "undeniable").  Interesting.  Fred edits out parts of a story to make a point.  But he states that when Moore does that, it invalidates his argument.  But Fred, by the same logic, haven't you just invalidated yourself?   The Daily Howler has some further things to  urlLink say   about the Lisa Myers report.  The "misrepresentation" about Congressman Kennedy that Fred mentioned yesterday was, according to The Daily Howler, a gag.  In any case, the part that Moore edited out - "that Kennedy's nephew had recently signed up - in no way contradicts Moore's point: That of the 535 members of Congress, only  one  had a child in the service.    Fred, that was the point Moore was making.  Posted 8:20am (we're trying to get this in earlier to give Fred and anyone else who's interested enough time to read it)

						   Is THIS really the best they can come up with?  Michael Moore is registered to vote in TWO states at the same time?  Honsberger says it like Mikey's done something WRONG.  The  urlLink smokinggun.com  website that Honsberger seems to be referring to on his program (which is quoted by  urlLink newsmax.com ) says, "We're sure this is some kind of innocent mix-up, that Moore forgot to cancel his New York registration before signing up in Michigan."    Duh, has Fred Honsberger never moved in his life?  When he did move can he PUHLEEEZE tell us where he got his official Voter 'Unregistration' Form?    As someone who has done voter registration--most recently at the Three Rivers Arts Festival Voter Registration Booth--and who has taken a class on it at  urlLink Camp Wellstone,  I can tell you that when you register at a new address you don't have to 'unregister' at your old address, in fact there's no form to do that.  That is why states periodically go through their voter rolls and clean them up.  If NY is doing its job, Moore will eventually be dropped from their rolls.  It's not up to the voter to notify their County's Voter Registration Office that they are moving or that they are registering in another state.  That's what the nice voter registration people are supposed to be doing when you submit a new registration--that's one reason it can take six weeks to get your new card.  And if you don't believe me, then call  urlLink Project Vote Smart,  1-888-VOTE-SMART. Ask THEM about 'unregistering.' 	 Now regarding his Independent status, the  urlLink smokinggun.com  website says, "Now here's the good part: Moore is simultaneously registered to vote in Michigan, where registrants aren't even given the option of party affiliation (so he's not an Independent there either)." Umm, pardon me, but what kind of argument is that?  By that standard, he's not a Democrat in Michigan either. Gee, maybe Moore's a closet Republican!

						      In a performance worthy of Richard Burbage himself, Fred Honsberger today danced and weaved around the truth in so many ways, we're still reeling.  His more compelling rants mostly revolved around Michael Moore's  urlLink Fahrenheit 911 .  On a side note, we were present at the  urlLink town meeting  hosted by MoveonPac.  The room had a capacity of 500 people and we were among those standing in the back because there were NO SEATS LEFT.  COOL!  First off, we should state up front that while Fred is quite adamant in saying that he has no plans to see the movie, he never-the-less knows that it's propaganda.  He then pointed out that "even the liberal media" has determined that the movie plays fast and hard with the truth.  His evidence?  An NBC report on the Nightly News.   Check out  urlLink this  From the Daily Howler.  Just scroll down to the part that says "But Myers Loves Scripts."  Fred really should pick his sources more carefully.  Philip Shenon states in a  urlLink piece  from the New York Times (the link is to Moore's website where the NYTimes piece is republished) that he was allowed to see an advance screening and he adds that  Based on that single viewing, and after separating out what is clearly presented as Mr. Moore's opinion from what is stated as fact, it seems safe to say that central assertions of fact in "Fahrenheit 9/11" are supported by the public record (indeed, many of them will be familiar to those who have closely followed Mr. Bush's political career).  As more evidence of the "liberal" media's rejection of Michael Moore, The Honz quotes an  urlLink op-ed piece  by David Brooks.  Neglecting to say, of course, that Brooks is hardly a liberal at all.  See urlLink  this  at Slate.com or  urlLink this  at the Boston Globe.    Do we need to point out that both sources label David Brooks as  a conservative ?    And lest anyone (like Fred) think that these are just the disgruntled opinions of those farther left, the piece at the Boston Globe states pretty clearly that Brooks is "a former senior editor at  urlLink The Weekly Standard ." For those who don't know, The Weekly Standard is owned by Rupert Murdoch and is currently edited by William Kristol and Fred Barnes.  Is Fred Honsberger trying to have us believe that David Brooks is an example of liberal opinion?  If that's the case, then he is either lying, or he is ignorant of the political landscape in America.  But we digress.  Fred tried to challenge the veracity of the movie by pointing to...Michael Moore's voter registration card.  He began by pointing out that Moore says he's not a Democrat but an Independent.  Fred cunningly countered by holding up Moore's  urlLink New York voter registration card  and dutifully pointing to the box (checked off my Moore) marked "Democrat."  Fine.  Perhaps Fred should let his eyes wander a little to the right (which should be easy for a conservative - haahaa!).  Take a look at  the date .  The voter registration card is dated 7-8-92.  By my calendar that's almost exactly 12 years ago.  Moore recently (thesmokinggun.com says "last April") registered to vote in Michigan. This caused our Fred to point out that Moore is now registered to vote in two states.  Thesmokinggun.com (one of the sources of this story) states that they're sure that this is "some kind of innocent mix-up" and that Moore probably forgot to cancel his New York registration when he transferred his drivers license and register to vote in Michigan.  What that all had to do with the movie, we're not sure.  Fred never really did get to point out any facts that Moore got "wrong."  He tried to bring up that Richard Clarke claimed authority to allow the Saudi Royals and bin Laden family members to leave the country without much FBI screening.  The "logic" of the argument seemed to be that if Richard Clarke authorized the flights, then Moore is lying.  Huh?  By the way here's some of Clarke's  urlLink testimony  about the flights to the 911 Commission: MR. GORTON: One more question on that subject. When the approvals were finally made, and when the flight left, was the flight embargo still in effect or were we flying -- or was that over? We were flying once again?   MR. CLARKE: No, sir. No, Senator. The reason that a decision was needed was because the flight embargo -- the grounding was still in effect.    So we suppose now that we're not so far off the mark to believe that  there were some flights before the embargo was lifted .  In any event, Clarke seems to be referring to flights like the one described in  urlLink this  news report.    However, take a  urlLink look  to see what the movie actually says about those flights.  The point was  not  that they were flown out of the country before the flight ban was lifted (the film never says that), but that the 140 people on the planes were given special treatment when they were flown out of the country.  We shouldn't need to say out that this isn't contradicted in any way by anyone pointing to the fact that Richard Clarke "okayed" the flights.  The OK  was  the special treatment.  Fred should let us know  after he's seen what's actually in the film  what facts Moore gets wrong.  Until he knows what he's taking about, he should probably not say anything - it's embarrassing.  We are surprised that the media and other mouthpieces of the Right have suddenly found religion and are now relentlessly tracking down facts to support the credibility of those asserting them.    Now if they'd just done that before the bombing began.

						             Predictions for Today   Judging from Fred's rants about Michael Moore yesterday on KDKA, we're pretty sure that if he's on TV this morning, there'll be more of the same.  Good.  We're ready.  Perhaps he'll also be commenting on the RNC's new "Hitler Ad."   As Liz pointed out so well  urlLink recently , the RNC is running its own Hitler ad.  The so-called "Moveon.org ad" was submitted to that website as part of a  urlLink contest  and as soon as they found out its content, they  urlLink removed and denounced  it.  The RNC's ad has been in the news enough for Fred to take notice.  We even heard him discussing it on KDKA yesterday afternoon. So if he's on the air today and if he fails to denounce the ad and the RNC for posting it, or even mentions the "Moveon.org" ad (when we know Moveon.org neither sponsored nor endorsed it) then we'll know he's doing that "let's mislead the public with misstatements" thing that we know he does all too often.  Remember, Moveon.org is a distinct organization - separate from both the Democratic Party and the Kerry Campaign.  To imply otherwise is a lie.  Moveon.org had nothing to do with the Hitler ad posted on its website.  To imply that it did, is another lie.  To tie them all together in any way is a HUGE lie.  We'll see what Fred does today.  posted 9:27am

						      We don't claim Fred's radio show as regular territory for this blog, but when his radio lies are particularly agregious, we have to correct him.  On his radio show on  urlLink KDKA-Pittsburgh  this afternoon, Fred's been parrotting the line from  urlLink Newsmax.com  that fans of Fahrenheit 911 would be surprised to learn that Michael Moore thinks they are "the dumbest people on the planet."  This is another one of Fred's deceptions.  The Newsmax item, from June 28th 2004, references an article found in The Mirror, a British tabloid.  The article is dated November 3rd, 2003.  Great researchers over there at Newsmax - only took them eight months to find an English language quotation on the internet.  What Fred omits (and remember, Fred always omits something) is the rest of the story.  Here's the context of the quotation:   Take his description of his fellow countrymen and their blind pursuit of the American Dream: "They are possibly the dumbest people on the planet... in thrall to conniving, thieving, smug pricks.   So it's the blind pursuit of the American Dream that makes Americans dumb - not the fact that they are fans of Michael Moore.  And who do you think he is referring to when he says that they are "in thrall to thieving, smug pricks"?  Moore continues:  We Americans suffer from an enforced ignorance. We don't know about anything that's happening outside our country. Our stupidity is embarrassing. National Geographic produced a survey which showed that 60 per cent of 18-25 year olds don't know where Great Britain is on a map.  If anything he is painting a picture of those people who pursue the "American Dream" at the cost of everything else - including knowledge about the world as a whole.  This can be dangerous.  Imagine if there was a group of people running the country who didn't know about anything outside of the US, but were pushing a narrow economic agenda there nonetheless.  No, wait.  We don't have to imagine it.    In any event, Fred was implying that Moore said that the people  going to the movie  were the ones who are the dumbest.  This is simply untrue.

						             Predictions for Today   We don't have any particularly strong predictions for today - sorry.  We're still buzzing over  urlLink Fahrenheit 911 .  We saw it this weekend and it blew us away.  We're assuming that considering the fact that the movie made close to $22 million this weekend, the Honz will have to say  something  about it.  He'll probably rant about the movie's "inaccuracies" or how much of a liar Moore is.  Perhaps he'll find some bit of minutia to discuss - and from there "prove" that the whole movie is a lie.  We will be sure to correct him if need be.  Or he may continue to prattle on about Bill Clinton's book and maybe even get to Monica Lewinsky's reaction to it.  Or the program may be a rerun.  We shall see what we shall see.

						   On previous programs Honsberger has railed against  urlLink moveon.org.   One of his primary objections to the group was the ‘Hitler Ad.’ Moveon.org did not write, produce, pay for, or broadcast on TV the ad which compared Bush to Hitler.  Moveon sponsored a contest online at their website for people to create their own anti-Bush ad.  They received something like 1500 entries.  All the submissions were on the moveon.org website for members to vote on—the ‘Hitler’ ad was one of these.  When objections were voiced about this ad, the ad was quickly removed from their website.  However, it was then shown on the Republican National Committee website as an inducement for contributions to that party.  It eventually was removed from there too.  It’s baaack!    Where can you view it, you ask?  Well you can view portions of it a  urlLink www.georgewbush.com : the official campaign site for President Bush.  Portions of it appear in an online ad for Bush.  The ad starts out with white type on a black background that says, “The Faces of John Kerry’s Democratic Party.  The Coalition of the Wild-Eyed.” It then shows clips of Al Gore, Michael Moore, Howard Dean, Dick Gephardt and John Kerry yelling interspersed with clips of Hitler yelling from the moveon.org ad entry.  It then says, “This is not the time for pessimism and rage.”    So I challenge Honsberger: does he object to THIS ad which compares Hitler to various Democrats (and one Independent)?    Will he demand that it be taken down?

						   We'd like to give a shout out to the astute caller who, while challenging The Honsman and Steven Hayes on the tales of Saddam's son-in-law, seemed to be reading straight off of this  urlLink blog posting .  It's about halfway down - the part about Ahmed Khalil Ibrahim Samir al-Ani.  Welcome aboard!  Drop  urlLink us  an e-mail, if you're so inclined.

						       Fred was on LIVE today, and boy was he on-message.  Most of the hour was devoted to an interview with writer  urlLink Steven Hayes .  He's the guy with a book out on the connections between Hussein's Iraq and al-qaeda.  Considering the recent 9/11 Commission report declaring no "collaborative" involvement between Saddam and al-qaeda, we thought we detected a bit of desperation in the conversation.    Hayes (with Fred's help) brought up some points that had been more or less explained away elsewhere.  For example, they brought up the " urlLink meeting " in Prague between Mohammad Atta and an agent of the Iraqi intelligence service.  As we wrote about this a few days ago (see link) we won't bother to restate it here.    We mention it only because Hayes uses an amazing logical argument to support it and by extension the whole book.  The argument can be boiled down to this: You can't prove it didn't happen.   The evidence supporting Atta's presence in Florida at that time, his cell phone records, was explained by Hayes this way:  He probably wouldn't have brought his cell phone to Prague anyway as he wouldn't have been able to use it there.  Someone else could have used it in Florida when he was in Prague.  Never mind that there's no evidence he was in Prague at that time.  This whole "you can't prove it didn't happen so you have to accept it as a possibility" argument is most troublesome.  This is one time when Occam's Razor works very handily, indeed.  For example, no one can prove that:    1) ghosts don't exist.  2) the Universe wasn't created 60 seconds ago to be exactly what it is now.  3) The Batman isn't gay.   The fact that there's scant evidence to support any of these statements should lead us to be highly skeptical of those who're trying to convince us of their truth while offering little to support them.    Especially someone who's selling a book.  We were reminded during this hour of Richard Clarke.  Wasn't one of the criticisms he faced from the conservative media the fact that he's "just out to sell a book?"  If Clarke's book is so dismissed, why not Steven Hayes?  Fred said a couple more things that are more or less goofy.  He declared that Madeline Albright (former Secretary of State) believes that the US has Osama bin Laden and already in custody and will "capture him" just before the election - an "October Surprise."  He failed to mention, of course, that she's already said she was  urlLink joking .  The most egregious display of illogic occurred at the end of the hour.  The Honz began by "quoting" USAToday in a rundown of Senator Kerry's " urlLink Gloom and Doom " view of the economy.  He presented it as if it were a newspaper article and not the editorial that it is.  And he boils the  urlLink response , by former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich down to Reich quoting some polls to support his position.  The implication was that the facts are on the side of the USAToday editorial board (though Fred never identified them) and not on the side of Robert Reich.  He went on to lambaste Reich for presenting poll results as facts.  He said, "Polls aren’t facts.  Polls are opinions."  Here are just two of Reich's facts that Fred left out: More than 8 million Americans are unemployed today. That's 39,000 more than in April.  Wages are stagnant. According to the Labor Department, the weekly pay of the typical full-time worker is rising no faster than inflation   In any event, do we need to waste any time letting Fred know that Editorials are "opinions" too?  That's why they're on the "Op-Ed" page and not on the "news" pages.

						             Today's Predictions   As we posted  urlLink yesterday , Steven Hayes will be on today's program.  But we're not convinced that Hayes will take up the entire hour.  So here are some more possible story topics for Fred.  Michael Moore's movie  urlLink Fahrenheit 911 .  The Republican smear campaign has begun and we expect Fred to toe the line faithfully.  If he says anything about it, he'll point out how the movie is full of lies, propaganda, blah-blah-blah.  It's all crap, of course.   urlLink Here's  Moore responding to a critical Newsweek article.  Or Fred might continue to rant about the Clinton autobiography.  (As of 8:45am on June 24 it's the number 1 bestseller at  urlLink Amazon.com , thankyouverymuch.)  And by the way,  urlLink Media Matters  has pretty much  urlLink debunked  the right-wing myth that Clinton refused an offer from Sudan to turn over bin Laden in 1996.  The site points out that the 9/11 commission found no evidence for the story.  This week Fred said otherwise, of course.   Posted 8:50am

						   Friends;     Given the unofficial "day-off" prompted by another "Honsberger Live!" rerun, we've taken the opportunity to gather some views critical of Steven Hayes' book in the hope that those who plan to call in will have just a little more info to use.  Earlier this week The Honz said that Steven Hayes will be on this thursday.  For our own part, we have to reiterate that even if Hayes is able to show a series of "connections" between Saddam and al-qaeda, that does not in any way prove that Saddam had a hand in the 9/11 attacks.  And since we're in agreement with Fred in that Saddam had no involvement in the 9/11 attacks, we're looking forward to tomorrow's discussion.  We suspect that the party line will be presented in such a way as to lead us to the postion that that the current administration never actually said that Saddam had a hand in the attacks, only that he had an interest in spreading terrorism - and that's enough to justify the invasion.  Heck, the US had contacts with Iraq going back decades (remember the picture of Rumsfeld shaking Saddam Hussein's hand?), that means absolutely nothing.  Isikoff and Hosenball over at Newsweek had a  urlLink piece  last year on the memo Hayes built his book upon.  Here's the first paragraph: A leaked Defense Department memo claiming new evidence of an “operational relationship” between Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein’s former regime is mostly based on unverified claims that were first advanced by some top Bush administration officials more than a year ago—and were largely discounted at the time by the U.S. intelligence community, according to current and former U.S. intelligence officials.   And it kind of goes down hill from there, sorry to say.  The piece goes onto say that the memo was prepared by Douglas Feith in response to a request by the Senate Intelligence Committee and that it didn't contain anything new.  The article discusses something we are sure Fred will bring up: the meeting in Prague between an Iraqi intelligence official and Mohammad Atta.  Last we heard, Fred still believed that the meeting took place.  The Newsweek article says that while Hayes concedes (in his Weekly Standard article on the memo) that US Intelligence cannot confirm that the meeting took place, it does say that the Iraqi agent at the meeting, a man named Ahmed Khalil Ibrahim Samir al-Ani, has been in US custody for months and denies meeting Atta at all.  Combine that with the fact that, as we've read elsewhere, that the CIA has good intelligence that Atta wasn't even in Prague at the time of the meeting - he was in Florida.  Here's what the  urlLink 9/11 Commission  said: We have examined the allegation that Atta met with an Iraqi intelligence officer in Prague on April 9.  Based on evidence available - including investigation by Czech and US authorities plus detainee reporting - we do not believe that such a meeting occurred(Statement 16, Page 8).   We are sure there's more to say, but we'll end it there.

						             Things we won't see today   While Liz has already thought of this (and shame on her for pre-emptively plagarising us!!!), we want to make a list of things we probably won't see on today's show.  Assuming it's live, of course.  We probably won't hear about  urlLink this  today.  It's from newsmax.com, by the way - a rightwing "news" source.  The piece details how, although he didn't use it, Bush claimed right to waive torture laws and treaties covering prisoners of war.  Whatever happened to the adage that no one is above the law?  Nor will we probably hear about  urlLink this  today, either.  It's also from newsmax.  This piece says that the original numbers used to show that Bush's "war on terror" was going well, were, uh, wrong.    And we officially predict that Fred will stay a million miles away from  urlLink this  as well.  Granted, while it's only an op-ed piece from Florida (but hey, isn't that where Bush "won" the last "election"?) it asks the question of Dick Cheney, if he knows something about the "connection" between al-qaeda and Iraq that the 9/11 Commission doesn't know, then why doesn't he show it to the Commission?

						   Alas, today was another repeat.  This time it was the from May 19th.  So there's nothing much to say except this:  A viewer called in complaining about the pictures comeing out of the Abu Ghraib prison and he asked whether anyone remembered 9/11.  We were attacked then, the caller felt compelled to remind us.    Fred agreed with the caller. He  mocked  those who would point out that there's no connection between the 9/11 attacks and Iraq and continued to assert that there  was  a connection between the 9/11 attacks and the government in Iraq.  That was one short month ago.    We have a question for Fred.  What changed your mind?  We think you owe it to your viewers to explain how on May 19th you mocked the very position you accepted on June 20th.  Perhaps you need to be reminded that while still maintaining the position that there are "connections" between al-qaeda and Iraq, you stated on camera that Iraq had nothing to do with the 9/11 attacks.    We're pretty sure that  this  is what's known as a "flip-flop."  We also think that Fred should be asked this very question at his  urlLink website .  You can e-mail him  urlLink here .  Tell him Mike Ellis sent you.  We'll be e-mailing him this afternoon.  And we'll post whatever (if anything) he e-mails back.

						             Predictions for Today's Topics  We are quite pleased that some of our  urlLink predictions  yesterday turned out to be true.  But let's be honest, predicting that Fred will rail against Bill Clinton is like saying that Fred trims his moustache often - it's not that much of a stretch.  Now, for today's prediction:  We're thinking that, if Fred's live again today, he'll continue on the anti-Clinton rant (again, Fred: It's time to move on.) and/or mention Steven Hayes' book on the now dismissed "connection" between Saddam Hussein and al-qaeda.  Fred told us that Hayes will be on the show in the next few days.  Liz tells us that Hayes said on "The Daily Show" that his book is based in part on a 16-page memo written by Douglas Feith.  But the problem with the memo is that it's just a set of raw "data points" that are (even according to the memo itself) inconclusive and contradictory.  Some preemptive criticism can be found  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .  We're betting that The Honz may even regurgitate some "news" he finds at Newsmax.com.  We even predict that he'll authenticate it by saying that it wasn't found in the "mainstream" (which for Fred means "liberal") media.  Again, not a big stretch if he does.  posted 9:16 am

						   With a series of callers today, Fred outlined his particular theory of talk show epistemology.  First he said that his show was “actual fact” (which when you think about it, is a sort of redundancy – are there any facts that aren’t “actual?”).  Then he refocused and said that the show is about his opinion, based on fact - facts that he gives us.  He was distancing himself and his show from newscasts that, by definition, are supposed to be objective.  He also said that he is on the air to offset what he sees as the “massive liberal media.”  Beginning from the position that Fred is acting on the belief that the media is biased towards a liberal point of view and that it is powerful enough to steer public opinion away from the truth (We’re pretty sure that covers all the necessary angles for the phase “massive liberal media.”), we’re hoping to show that Fred has mired himself in a contradiction, whether he knows it or not.  There are a couple of assumptions here that we are not going to address.  Whether the media is liberal, for example, is a separate issue that should be dealt with elsewhere.  What we want to analyze is what Fred said and what it means.  Whether the media is liberal or not (and we believe it isn’t) doesn’t change whatever belief Fred holds about it.    Based on a number of things he’s said on his show in the past, Fred, like a lot of other conservatives, believes that the media consciously or unconsciously filters out “undesirable” information from reaching the masses (for example, good economic news under a Republican administration and bad economic news under a Democratic one).  Every time he presents a news item that supports a conservative position that he says isn’t found in “the mainstream media,” he is making this argument.    There’s a conflict of sorts with the other things Fred said, notably about his own show.  He has said that the media is biased and that he’s seeking to offset the left leaning media, but while doing so he doesn’t claim to be objective.  He even stated that his show is about his opinion – opinion based on the facts he gives us.  It almost goes without saying that he is the one who has selected these facts for us.    So we have, in Fred, a non-objective media outlet basing its opinions on a selected set of facts and presenting them in such a way as to influence public (i.e. our) opinion.  The only difference between Fred and Fred’s image of “the media” is that while “the media” is at least claiming to be objective, Fred is quite open about the fact that he’s biased.  He’s just biased another direction.  But if it’s wrong to be biased in one direction, shouldn’t it be just wrong to be biased in another?  The cure for a biased media is not a larger set of biases, but more objectivity.    Unless of course we wouldn’t want to let the facts get in the way of our opinions.  We wouldn’t want that, would we Fred?

						   "Honsberger Live!" was indeed live this morning.   We are relieved.  Fred Honsberger has returned to Pittbsurgh Television.  The Order of Things has been restored.  The Honz has returned and he's still misleading his audience.    Cue the choir.  They need to start singing Handel now.   Fred focussed, as many conservative pundits will this week, on Bill Clinton and his interview on  urlLink 60 Minutes  last night.  There's so much there, it'll require some work to unweave Fred's rhetoric.  We'll be concentrating on this one later on today.  But for a man who is callous enough to say on live TV that the 911 families (or at least those who disagree with the current administration) should stop  whining and "just get over it," he's remarkably incapable of accepting the fact that Bill Clinton is no longer President of the United States.    Note to Fred:  Just Get Over It.  Bill Clinton is no longer President of the United States.  Some other highlights of today's show (and we're still giddy that it was actually live):  Fred feels that he's on TV to offset some of the "massive liberal media" and that he's there to offer some balance.  Hm, he may be right about that.  Consider the massive heaping piles of airtime PCNC (Fred's little corner of TvLand) gives to liberals and you'll have to agree that Fred's little half-hour talkshow is in every sense of the word "balance."  But only if by "balance" you mean "unbalanced."  Anne Devlin (the only other even remotely political talk show host on PCNC) was hired as a replacement for the truly liberal John McIntire.  As wonderful as she is, we simply can not tell whether she's a left-leaning centrist or a right-leaning centrist.  This is not a criticism, however.  In any case, Fred says that the media is "totally complicit" in selling Clinton's book and in getting John Kerry elected.  He then quotes Kakutani's scathing  urlLink review  found in the New York Times.  As an example of the pressure being put on him by "the liberal media" he offered the following tidbit.  The radio station that broadcasts his program, KDKA 1020, is owned by Viacom, the same company that owns the publishing house that is selling Clinton's book.  He says that the station is being forced to broadcast excerpts from the book as advertisements.  Please note that this is the same "liberal" corporation that refused to broadcast the Moveon.org ad during the Superbowl and the same "liberal" corporation that bowed to conservative pressure over CBS' miniseries on the life of Ronald Reagan.  On a more or less unreleated note:  Fred did tell us this morning that Prime Minister Putin of Russia said a week ago that Iraq did have Weapons of Mass Destruction.  Not surprisingly, this is wrong.  As ABC news  urlLink reported , Putin said that:    ...in the time between the Al Qaeda attacks and the war in Iraq there was repeated intelligence that Saddam Hussein's regime was planning to attack US territory and American targets around the world.    What Fred left out, and he always leaves something out, was that Putin said there was no information linking Saddam to any specific attack and that in any event the intelligence does not justify the invasion of Iraq.  And considering the sabre-rattling on this side of the Atlantic during the time between 911 and the invasion, it's hardly surprising that our intended target would draw up some attack plans of his own.  In any event, there was no mention of WMD.  But here's something  HUGE .  Fred Honsberger admitted on live TV that there are no connections between Iraq and the 911 attacks.  So next time we see him juxtapose the videotape of people leaping to their deaths from the World Trade Center with videotape of anything in Iraq, we will have to gently remind him of something he's already said:    Saddam had nothing to do with the 911 attacks.

						   Many many thanks to Liz for her eye-poppingly great posts.  We're now officially worried - she's so good at this that she makes us look real bad in comparison.          Predictions for Today's Topics  Assuming "Honsberger Live!" is indeed live today, we're predicting that Fred or Bob be "discussing" President Clinton's new book, or at least liberally quote the NYTimes  urlLink review  of it.   For a reality check on Kakutani's review, check out  urlLink Media Matters .  Fred (or Bob?) may, of course, parrot the right-wing party line with  urlLink this .  If he does, we're sure he'll pump up the "connection" paragraphs while ignoring the "no collaborative relationship" paragraphs.    In any event any (ANY!) quote from WorldNetDaily must be taken with a huge dose of skepticism.  They're the folks pushing Jayna Davis' book that claims that the "3rd Oklahoma City Terrorist" is connected to Middle Eastern Terrorism.  Or the yeastly  urlLink Richard Poe , who claims that then-First Lady Hillary Clinton "commanded a secret police operation dedicated to silencing dissent, muzzling media critics, intimidating political foes, whitewashing Clinton scandals, and obstructing justice."  They also push Michael Savage and David Bossie.   Yea, quality writers over there at WND.

						   Friday's program was a repeat of a show originally broadcast on May 17th.  For Mike's take on the Geneva Convention portion of the program click  urlLink HERE.   I must have missed much of this show the first time around because there was a segment on gay marriage that I have lots to say about.  And, I will say it right here when I have more time...perhaps after I get back from the Pittsburgh Pride Parade later today.  Should put me in a real good mood to comment on Fred's take on gays!   Blushing Brides, Mendacious Hosts & Hot Man On Dog Action   Honsberger's stated main objection to gay marriage was that it would change the scope of marriage which has long-standing traditions which should be maintained.  He used the bugaboo of polygamy to EVERY caller who favored (or at least did not oppose gay marriage).  Since Freddie painted himself as a traditionalist, let's first look at marriage 'tradition' (cue 'Fiddler on the Roof' soundtrack now) regarding polygamy.  Honsberger often mentions that he is a Christian and bases his morality on the Bible.  As he is a student of the Christian Bible, one wonders why Honsberger seems so horrified at the idea of polygamy?   urlLink Surely he knows that in the patriarchal age polygamy is regarded as an unquestioned custom?  It survived far into the Christian era among Jews--and Luther, as late as the 16th century, arrived at the conclusion that he could not forbid the taking of more than one wife. So just why did the Honz imply that the custom was so immoral?  Could he just have been trying to scare his viewers with a slippery slope argument (first they allow gay marriages and then legal polygamy is soon to follow)?  Is the Pope Catholic?  Additionally, there was certainly a tradition of  urlLink legal polygamy  in the US Territory of Utah, although the Mormons did have to agree to condemn the practice in order for Utah to become a state.  At least he gets points for not bringing up the bestiality bugaboo as did Rick  urlLink 'Man on Dog Action '  urlLink Santorum . (Speaking of Lil' Rickie, Senator Bob Kerrey once asked, "Santorum? Is that Latin for asshole?")  When one caller said that there was a time in the US when there were restrictions on marriage as pertains to African-Americans, Honsberger feigned ignorance and said that while there may have been some societal pressures against interracial marriage he wasn't sure there were ever any laws restricting Blacks in terms of marriage.  C'mon!  Someone who presents himself as an educated person who has a knowledge of history has never heard of the word  urlLink miscegenation ??  urlLink Antimiscegenation laws were only finally struck down in 1967... well into Honsberger's lifetime.  And did Fred really think that slaves could marry legally?  Has he never heard the phrase  urlLink "jumping the broom?"   Lastly, Honsberger argued that gays could have the same rights that heterosexuals do under marriage by invoking power of attorney.  This is flat-out false as there are more than  urlLink 1,000 federal rights open to heterosexual couples who wed.  Power of attorney simply doesn't do the trick. 	 The case against gay marriage that Honsberger made on this show was just one more instance where Freddie knew the facts but was depending on the ignorance of his audience to make his argument.     And by the way, Saturday's Gay Pride Parade was FABULOUS!  Especially nice were the hearty cheers and applause given by bystanders to the John Kerry supporters (straight and gay) marching behind a 10 foot banner.  And, no, despite rumors to the contrary, Fred Honsberger was not the Grand Marshall for the parade, nor did he appear on any floats in drag.

						    Wednesday, June 16, 2004    What I learned from today's show: The biggest project in Iraq is getting the Internet into all the high schools.  (And, here I thought the biggest project was to stop getting our soldiers killed!)  Yes folks, today's show--hosted again by  urlLink Bob Bruce --was all about how wonderfully well Iraq and the US Economy are doing under President George W. Bush.  If only PCNC's phone system worked half as well! (Callers to the show could not hear the host and guests.)  The first guest was  urlLink Betsy Hiel , Middle East Correspondent, Pittsburgh Tribune-Review.  In the course of discussing the situation in Iraq she declared that Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr was not viewed favorably by respectable people in Iraq which was contradicted by Bob Bruce who pointed out that a recent  urlLink poll  showed that 81% said they had either a better or much better opinion of him than they did three months ago.  Ms. Hiel said that she had not seen that poll.  Ms. Hiel also stated, "The biggest project in Iraq is getting the Internet into all the high schools."  Umm, right.  For a project that might need more urgent attention, please read this article on the  urlLink  horrific conditions  in Baghdad's Central Teaching Hospital for Children.	 	 Bob Bruce stated that he'd been reading up on the post-WWII Germany and Japan occupation and tried to say it was as bad as Iraq. If ANYONE has ANY statistics showing that there were as many American soldiers KILLED in either of those two countries AFTER the end of major combat operations, PLEASE post them here.  The comparison might be more apt if we're saying that we'll need to be in Iraq for decades too.  He also said that we have troops in NORTH Korea (?).  A caller to the show expressed their dismay at the 'skewed coverage' of Iraq and Bob and Betsy bemoaned the lack of good news stories.  Hmm, can't imagine why the media and those awful Democrats would want to focus on armed insurgency in Iraq's capitol and the disruption of the country's major industry (OIL) in the South.  Bruce ended this segment by telling Betsy that, "What's good about you is you're not just seen on the balcony in Baghdad.  You're out in the country getting the real story."  I guess the daily death and dismemberment of US troops just isn't a 'real' enough story for Mr. Bruce.  Another segment featured  urlLink Jerry Bowyer  on the economy.  His appearance was preceded by a packaged piece which mentioned that 1.4 million jobs had been created from October 2003 to May 2004, but also mentioned that there were 1,625,208 bankruptcies in 2003.  Bowyer responded to the piece by saying, "More of the 'yes, but' coverage.  I'm tired of this 'yes, but' coverage."  I guess the truth hurts, especially if you're a conservative talk show host who favored Bush's tax cuts and wants the coverage to be all sunshine and lollipops.  Mr. Bowyer also chastised people who can't find a job because they haven't learned a trade or who don't learn a new computer language after an old one becomes obsolete.  Maybe Jerry should check out this  urlLink article  on how it's not just the low level programmers whose jobs are being outsourced these days.  Then again, if ol' Freddie Honsberger had been in on this discussion he would have again extolled the virtues of emptying bed pans for a living.  That's right folks, if your high tech job has moved to India stop your carping and start (literally) shoveling the sh*t!   It's ALL good!

						   As mentioned yesterday, today's program is supposed to be about the "Booming Bush Economy."  Here are some Talking Points:  1.  Bottom Line:  Just to keep pace with population growth, the economy needs to produce  urlLink 140,000 jobs each month.    48 months of Bush Presidency x 140,000 = 6,720,00 jobs that needed to be created under Bush JUST TO BREAK EVEN.  2.  "If you get  urlLink D-minuses for three and a half years  in college, one semester of a B-minus does not get you on the honor roll,"  said Gene Sperling, who was a top economic adviser to President Bill Clinton and is now advising Mr. Kerry.  3.  urlLink  Jobs today paid an average of $9,000 less annually   and household income is disappearing because of  50% increases in healthcare, 35% jumps in college tuitions  and other increased expenses.  4.  urlLink  There are more Americans living in poverty now than there were in 1965.   Over thirteen million of them are children. (The US has the worst child poverty rate of all the world's industrialized countries.)  Last year alone, another 1.7 million Americans slipped below the poverty line, bringing the total to 34.6 million, one in eight of the population, and up from 31.6 million in 2000.   5.  urlLink  History shows the stock market does better under Democrats.   A broad index of stocks (similar to the S&P 500) returned approximately 11 percent more a year under a Democratic president.  6.   urlLink Jobless Rate Misses 'Hidden' Unemployed  - 5.96 Million Unemployed People Not Counted   7.  urlLink  High-End Technology Work Not Immune to Outsourcing   - Microsoft contract documents show that as far back as 2001 the big company had agreed to pay two Indian outsourcing companies, Infosys and Satyam, to provide skilled "software architects" for Microsoft projects.  Bush responded to concerns about job outsourcing by proposing Anthony F. Raimondo to the new post of Manufacturing Czar. Raimondo’s nomination had to be withdrawn when it was revealed that he had opened a factory in China.    8.  urlLink  Consumer Prices Surge at Fastest Rate in 3 Years   - A surge in gasoline prices lifted the Consumer Price Index by 0.6 percent in May, the largest monthly increase in three and a half years, the government reported yesterday (June 15 2004). Food prices also jumped while the prices of many other items went up by enough to suggest that the inflation rate will continue to climb gradually.

						   Today’s show was hosted by Bob Bruce and featured two call-in guests.  The first was Paul Kengor, Ph. D., who was identified as an Iraq Analyst.  Kengor has been on the show many times (I think they may have him on speed dial for Conservative, pro-Bush Iraq comments).  Kengor first celebrated that Faluja and Nayef have "cooled off."  No mention of course of Baghdad where 14 were killed on Sunday and 13 people killed on Monday (including three General Electric workers and two bodyguards) with 62 injured.  No mention either that crowds rejoiced over the attack, dancing around a charred body and shouting  urlLink "Down with the USA!"   Additionally, today, two pipelines were blown up in southern Iraq which is expected to cut oil exports in the south by more than half.  Kengor then quoted an article from the urlLink  World Tribune  that said Saddam had shipped out weapons of mass destruction before the war...maybe I misheard him, but the article stated that WMD  COMPONENTS  were shipped out.  As they continued to discuss Iraq, Bob Bruce said, "At this point Kerry has not offered any ideas (on Iraq)."  He immediately followed that up by saying that Kerry said that we needed to bring in the UN.  Hmmm…if that’s not an idea  urlLink why is Bush trying desperately to pursue that course now?   You can find Kerry’s ideas on Iraq  urlLink HERE.   Bruce then expressed his dismay that Abu Ghraib was being "blown out of proportion" and Kengor agreed wholeheartedly.  A caller asked them how they could say it was being blown out of proportion, "...when everyday more people up the chain of command were being notified."  The word "notified" gave Kengor some wiggle room to weasel out a discussion of the leak of  urlLink memos  demonstrating that torture was a policy  urlLink instituted at the top  and instead to go over the press release put out in January.  Kengor went on to claim that maybe a dozen soldiers were involved in the prison abuse and that, "You can find more people who can quote the UN Declaration of Human Rights from beginning to end."  Uh, yea, right.  Let’s see, there are currently over 20 prisoner deaths in Iraq being investigated which would mean that each of these dirty dozen must have murdered two people.  The second call-in guest was Barry Lynn (Exec. Dir. of  urlLink Americans United for the Separation of Church and State ) who discussed the recent Supreme Court decision (or non-decision) in the Pledge of Allegiance – "Under God" case.  I will say that Bob Bruce was quite even-handed, especially when a caller said that "...the Founding Father detested atheists..." and that atheists should not serve on juries.  Tomorrow’s show should provide much blog fodder as a topic will be "The Booming Bush Economy."

						   - Don't expect any comments on the Honzman's radio program this week.  Mike is offline until next week and I only have access to TV and streaming online radio at work. I'm guessing that KDKA 1020 AM radio skews  OLD  and we can expect them to have online radio sometime in the next century.  However you can catch the delightful  urlLink Lynn Cullen's radio show online  as well as Must Hear Radio:  urlLink Air America Radio  (unfortunately Air America Radio can  only  be heard online in Pittsburgh).   - I don't think it's been mentioned here before, but we did receive a plug on  urlLink PittsburghLive.com  (scroll about halfway down the page) in addition to the already mentioned  urlLink City Paper article .

						             Predictions for Today's Topics  If Honsberger Live is indeed live today with Honsberger as the host, there's certainly LOADS to talk about:  -  urlLink Powell admitting that the Terrorism Report was a 'Big Mistake'  	  -  urlLink 26 ex-diplomats and military leaders say Bush must go. (His foreign policy has harmed national security. Several served under Republicans.)   -  urlLink Justice Dept. Memo Says Torture 'May Be Justified'   -  urlLink Interrogation abuses were 'approved at highest levels'   But all things considered, we figure he'll go with Reagan...or maybe the Pirates losing streak.

						   We took the opportunity to listen to the honsman on the radio (KDKA-AM) this afternoon.  I heard Fred say that there's a report in the news that a Jordanian attorney who claims to represent Saddam Hussein claims that the former Iraqi dictator has been tortured.  We did a google search and as of 4:40 and using the keywords "Saddam Hussein" and "torture" and we probably found the news item.  If that's the case, Fred's correct.  The story's certainly in the news - in China.  We would never have guessed that such a zealous anti-Communist as Fred Honsberger would trust an news item that was found in the  Xinhuanet  out of Beijing.  While the google search says it's been on the web for 18 hours, it has yet to make onto the Drudge Report (as of 5:05pm).  No matter - we can not necessarily dismiss a news report on account if its source.  So let's move on.  While Fred faithfully related the first paragraph:    A Jordanian attorney who claims he represents Saddam Hussein said on Wednesday he believes the ousted Iraqi leader was subjected to torture,   He neglets the next phrase:   ...although a copy of a letter reportedly sent to his daughters seems to show the ex-president in good spirits, said Friday's China Daily.    Actually the short piece (it's only about a half-dozen paragraphs) goes back and forth so much, we can't see it as a credible source.    But we just report - you have to decide.

						   Today's program was another Honsberger Live without The Honz.  We hope he's ok (honestly).  It was again hosted by Bob Bruce and again the photo of John Kerry usually seen over The Honsman's right shoulder was absent.  That being said, it was a much better hour than the previous non-Honz  urlLink Honsberger Live , probably owing to the balancing presence of former diplomat--current Post-Gazette associate editor Dan Simpson.  We don't know whether it was a conscious effort on Simpson's part, but whenever Bob Bruce veered the conversation into something that resembled the beatification of Ronald Reagan, Simpson was able to reel him back in with some counter argument.    What stood out was the fact that Simpson was able to introduce into the conversation the Iran/Contra scandal. To which the efficient Bruce declared that there are some scholars who believe that because Communism is out of Nicaragua, Reagan's Iran/Contra program has somehow been validated.    Hmmm...let's see.  An administration breaks the law, defies Congress and covers it up - but that's OK because it turns out the ends really do justify the means.  Simpson was also brave enough to ask of the funeral preceedings, "One has to wonder, how much of this is politics?"  We don't have an answer to that question, but we applaud Dan Simpons' posing it anyway.  A note:  We will be off-line for about a week.  Liz will still be posting, however.  See you soon!

						   My Friends;  Today was another repeat.   There hasn't been much to write about here at HL, so things might be a little slow until Fred comes back on the air more frequently.  There's only so much retreading we can do.  We may have to start listening to The Honz on the radio (ACK!).  In the meantime here, read  urlLink this .  It's David Corn on the Love Story between Ronald Reagan and the "liberal" media.  Or  urlLink this .  This is Corn's piece on El Mozote.  Don't miss it.  Here's how the piece ends:   Thanks to Ronald Reagan, American tax dollars supported the murder of hundreds of El Salvadoran villagers. And the UN-backed commission, after examining 22,000 atrocities that occurred during the 12-year civil war in El Salvador, attributed 85 percent of the abuses to the Reagan-assisted right-wing military and its death-squad allies. Similar patterns transpired in Guatemala and Honduras in the 1980s.  The El Mozote massacre, though perhaps the largest massacre in modern Latin American history, is a minor footnote in the history of the Cold War, but it is, as writer Mark Danner, author of The Massacre at El Mozote , observed, "a central parable of the Cold War." It is also a telling tale of Reaganism. The lives of the people butchered in this small village by U.S.-trained troops were worth as much of that of the man whose body now lays in a casket draped with the Stars and Stripes. Media commentators have been hailing Reagan as heroic, iconic, patriotic and optimistic figure who led an "American life." It was indeed an American life, but one with lethal consequences for others. That is as important a piece of the Reagan story—if not more so—as his oh-so-sunny and cheery outlook.  I doubt the villagers of El Mozote were thinking about Reagan’s wonderful disposition when made-in-the-USA bullets supplied to their killers by the U.S. government, in accordance with Reagan’s foreign policy, were piercing their bodies and ending their non-American lives.   Something to think about while listening to Bush's eulogy tomorrow.

						             Predictions for Today's Topics  Assuming the program isn't another rerun, we're predicting that Fred (or now Bob Bruce - Hi Bob!) will be discussing the Reagan funeral services.  But let's be honest, that's not much of a stretch, is it?  The thing to look out for is outlined in this  urlLink posting  from Mediamatters.com.  It outlines how some elements of the media (the "fair and balanced" parts) are looking to make George W. Bush look better by connecting him to the "legacy" of Ronald Reagan.  We saw this sort of Reagan-Bush "comparison" on yesterday's  urlLink program .   If Fred's on and he has the time, we're also predicting that he'll pounce on this  urlLink story  - just more examples of Kerry's "flip-flops."  There's more "info"  urlLink here  at the Weekly Standard.  We'll be watching.  Posted 9:00am 6-9-4

						   During today’s show the topic turned to the love between Ronald and Nancy Reagan.  In the course of remarking how Reagan had no problem showing affection in public to his wife, Bill Green said that this demonstrated, “a part of family values that went unsaid” and that Reagan, “didn’t have to talk about them.”  Well, I’m more than happy to talk about “family values” in terms of Ronald Reagan.  Ronald Reagan was the only divorced president.  Nancy Reagan delivered their first child Patti--full-term-- urlLink seven months after their wedding.   Patti did not know she had a half-sister and adopted sibling until she was  urlLink seven years old.   News releases in Reagan’s gubernatorial campaign announced that he had just two children  urlLink (leaving out his two children from his first marriage).   His son Michael, adopted during his first marriage, later revealed that he was molested by a camp counselor when he was eight. Ronald Reagan reportedly made  urlLink no public or private response  to his son's revelations. His other son Ron explained that he could tell his father had himself written the letter to the nation announcing that he had Alzheimer's,  urlLink ''because there's no mention of his children.''     Fine, we all know relationships can be hard and divorce isn’t easy, but can Bill Green, Bob Bruce or Fred Honsberger please explain the following in terms of family values:      Michael Reagan has told the story that at his boarding school graduation,  urlLink his father failed to recognize him.   Ronald Reagan came up to his own son and stuck out his hand and introduced himself.    Now that’s about as far away from any recognizable ‘family value’ that I know.

						   Well to begin with, today's show was  not  a rerun, but that doesn't mean that Fred Honsberger was on the air - he wasn't.  Instead,  urlLink Bob Bruce  was sitting in his chair.  And for those who keep track of such things, the photo of John Kerry usually seen over the Honsman's right shoulder wasn't there either.    Bruce interviewed local political analyst Bill Green about the week of mourning commemorating Ronald Reagan's death.    What should have been a balanced hour of somber reflection edged at times too closely to being yet another non-paid commercial for the Bush campaign.  Between a fair amount of otherwise questionable claims about President Reagan's "accomplishments" (The claim that Reagan "did away with Communism." would probably come as a surprise to the billion or so people still living in Communist China, Communist North Korea, and Communist Cuba) the hour was a more-or-less one-sided discussion on the "legacy" of Ronald Reagan.    The more troubling parts of the hour occurred when Bruce and Green tried to reflect the glow of the Reagan Presidency onto George Bush.  Mr Bruce made this explicit when he compared the Reagan tax-cut, which he said spurred the economy then, to the recent Bush tax-cut, which he loyally parroted the party line as spurring the economy now.  As it turns out, the differences between the Reagan tax-cuts and Bush's are very neatly spelled out in today's  urlLink column  by Paul Krugman (may require a sign-in).  According to Krugman, when it turned out that the budget projections used to justify the tax-cuts in 1981 were "wildy optimistic", Reagan agreed to roll back some of those cuts.  What followed were two huge tax  increases .  Krugman even states of Reagan:   In fact, no peacetime president has raised taxes so much on so many people. This is not a criticism: the tale of those increases tells you a lot about what was right with President Reagan's leadership, and what's wrong with the leadership of George W. Bush.   The first Reagan tax increase, according to Krugman, undid about a third of the '81 tax cuts.  And the second, the Social Security Reform Act of 1983 implemented, among other things, a rise in the payroll taxes that pay for Social Security and Medicare hospital insurance.  There was no mention of Iran/Contra, the HUD and S&L scandals, the support for right-wing dictators around the world although Nancy Reagan's use of astrologers to shape her husband's schedule was excused as a "natural reaction" to the attempt on Ronald Reagan's life in 1981.  Questioning the rationality of a woman who would choose astrological charts over the United States Secret Service for the President's protection just never came up.  As a balance, or perhaps as a pallette-cleansing political sorbet, we offer some other opinions about the Reagan legacy:   urlLink Hitchens  on Reagan  urlLink Palast  on Reagan  urlLink Corn  On Reagan  The only way to fully understand history is to grasp it as much as possible from as many angles as possible - good and bad, top and bottom, left and right.  Offering a one dimensional characterization as history does no one any good at all.

						   Something we have yet to comment upon, the SPR (or Strategic Petroleum Reserves).  Fred spent a good amount of todays rerun (originally broadcast on May 20), ranting against Senator Kerry's plan to "tap into" the SPR.  This is a bad idea, he said.  The oil in the reserve is only to be used during a crisis, he said.  The implication being Senator Kerry would be putting the US in a more dangerous position by reducing the amount of oil in the reserves - and all for a political point.  As we'll see, this is another one of Fred's misstatements.  For those who don't know, the SPR was created in the mid-70s after the Oil crises of that decade.  The oil is kept in salt caverns a little under a half-mile underground, mostly in places around the Gulf of Mexico.  It is thought that a 60-day supply of crude oil would be enough for any short term crisis that might arise.  A month or so after 9/11, George Bush  urlLink directed  the Secretary of Energy to fill the reserves to capacity, to 700 million barrels.    According to the  urlLink DOE  there are about 660 million barrels of oil in the reserves - the highest ever - so there's only room for 40 million barrels more.  Another way of putting it is that the reserve is a little over 94% capacity.  The administration has been actively filling (or in gas-station parlance "topping off") the reserves for sometime.  According to the Pacific Business News about  urlLink 10%  of the country's daily production of oil is diverted to the reserves.  What John Kerry has  urlLink proposed  is a cessation of the diversion of oil into the reserves until the price of oil has stablized.  There will be no "tapping" of the reserves, no reduction of the amount in the reserves.  And remember, the reserves have never been this large.  For the time being, the oil that would have gone into the reserves would stay on the market, increasing the supply (and presumably lowering the price, if Adam Smith's invisible hand has any influence on the price of oil).  Whether this would actually work to lower the price of oil is a different issue, one which we are not qualified to address.  However, when Fred insists that Senator Kerry is looking to "tap" or otherwise reduce the amount of oil in the SPR, we now know he's either telling a lie or is grievously misinformed.

						             Predictions for Today's Topics  If Fred is on PCNC today, I am guessing he'll spend the hour lauding President Reagan.  But that's not much of a stretch - EVERYONE'S talking about Reagan.  If he talks about Reagan, he'll mention how Reagan won the cold-war, cut the size of government, and some other elements of the Reagan mythology.  Some other possible topics:  Newsmax is running a  urlLink story  from CNSNews stating that John Kerry met with North Vietnamese communists twice in the early 70s.  The Fred-hook is most likely to be the "flip-flop" that the Senator has only stated that he met with them once.  Of course, it's crap.  Or he might continue to parrot the right-wing line about George Soros.  The line goes that Mr Soros is quoted as saying that the abuse at the Abu Ghraib prison is "worse than 911."  Of course Media Matters has already  urlLink shown  this to be bogus.  So if he mentions these, remember you heard 'em here first!  Posted 9:30 am 6-7-04

						   We assume that if "Honsberger Live!" is indeed live today, Fred will talk about Ronald Reagan.  Of course his death is sad.  He was a human being with friends and family, people who loved him.  Their grief is very real and must be respected.  Alzheimer's is a cruel disease.  It must be an awful way to die and an awful way to watch a loved one die.    That being said, before we travel down the path of "Ronald Reagan singlehandedly saved us from ourselves" we should like our readers to keep in mind some things:   Iran/Contra Scandal    In a nutshell (for those who don't remember) the Reagan Administration, while publicly proclaiming that it doesn't make deals with terrorists, made a deal with some terrorists.  Through the CIA and intermediaries, they sold weapons to Iran, (at inflated prices) and then diverted the profits to the Nicaraguan Contras.  All illegal and all hidden from congressional oversight.  Harbor Mining in Nicaragua    In January of 1984, Reagan secretly approved the mining of Nicaraguan harbors in order to destabilize that country's economy.  His administration never informed the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (as was required by law) and even Senator Barry Goldwater called it a violation of internation law, an act of war.  The World Court agreed, and so Ronald Wilson Reagan made us a Rogue Nation.  Economy    If I am reading this  urlLink table  correctly, Reagan inheritied a budget deficit of a little more than $70 billion and then handed George H. W. Bush a defict close to $200 billion.  But before anyone says, "But it was a Democratic Congress, and THEY pass budgets!" let us remember that the budgets Reagan proposed were very very very close to the budgets congress passed.  According to the Congressional Almanac, budgets totally $7314 billion were proposed in the years 1982-1989 and $7361 billion were passed.  But think about it, wouldn't it be great to have a budget deficit of  only  $200 billion?  What is it now?  More than double that?  But I digress...  As far as Reagan being staunchly against raising taxes, Joshua Green of the Washington Monthly urlLink  points out  that Ronald Reagan raised taxes four times in two years (1982-1984).  One of those (a $100 Billion tax hike over three years) Green calls the "the largest since World War II."    When will Grover Norquist denounce these?  When will the republican noise machine start to grind out misinformation about them?  If time permits, we'll look into the Reagan Record on some other topics.  But, remember Reagan was the guy who said on October 20, 1965   "I favor the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and it must be enforced at the point of a bayonet,  if necessary." Only to say some 8 months later on June 17, 1966:   "I would have voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964."   That, my friends, is a Flip-Flop.

						   It's Friday evening and I thought we had a question:  where does Fred get his informaiton?  Through hours and hours of incense-aided meditation, we've settled upon an informal set of Fred-ready news sources:    urlLink Newsmax   urlLink World Tribune   urlLink World Net Daily   urlLink Drudge Report    This is by no means a complete listing and we have no idea exactly where The Honz gets his stuff, but it's been fun trying to predict his daily agenda.    Of course this past week, since the show's been in reruns, our powers of prediction have remained untested.  However, a few days ago we were sure that  urlLink this story  would be front and center in Fred's daily prattle.  The article starts with this: The same San Francisco federal judge who just overturned a federal law banning partial-birth abortions also approved of Muslim prayer in schools when federal rulings ban all other denominational prayers and activities.  The piece goes on to assert how school children were forced to take Muslim names, recite the Koran, and so on.  What we learn from a few other "news" sites is that the judge in question was a Clinton appointee.  Think of it.  The story has:   A liberal judge From San Francisco Who overturns an abortion Ban Who forced Islam on some school kids (when Christianity is banned) Who was appointed by Clinton.   A walking wet dream!  Of course reality is far different.  The abortion ban was overturned because the law was too broadly written, the unit on Islam did NOT force anyone to do anything (in any event it was mandated by the state) and the judge's appointment was ok'ed by both a Republican controlled Judiciary committee AND the Republican controlled Senate.  We're hoping to be able to stay one step ahead of Fred, all the better to phone in to correct his many mistakes.

						   Today's show was another rerun.  We expect that new shows will begin on Monday.  Can't wait.  In any event, today's rerun included Fred's logical construction releasing the US from having to abide by the Geneva Conventions.  The syllogism goes something like this (and I hope I am paraphrasing correctly here):   The Terrorists do not constitute a "State." The Geneva Conventions are a set of binding agreements between States.  Therefore,  The Terrorists are not bound by the Geneva Conventions Furthermore:   Since the Terrorists are not bound by the Geneva Conventions and The Conventions are a set of agreements between states,  Therefore,  We're not obligated to extend to them the protections that the Geneva Conventions provide. According to Fred, this includes all the people abused and otherwise humiliated in the Abu Ghraib prison.  I am not a lawyer (thank goodness) but here's why I think why that point of view is total crap:    We  signed the Geneva Conventions and so  we're  bound by them.   As I've written here before,  urlLink Article V  of the Geneva Conventions states that:   Should any doubt arise as to whether persons, having committed a belligerent act and having fallen into the hands of the enemy, belong to any of the categories enumerated in Article 4, such persons shall enjoy the protection of the present Convention until such time as their status has been determined by a competent tribunal. According to  urlLink Article VI   of the US Constitution, "and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land...."  Again, I'm not a lawyer, but it seems to me that that says we're bound by the Geneva Conventions - regardless of whether the organizations we're fighting have signed it. It's not up for discussion.  It is the law of the land.  So even if they're members of a terrorist organization, until that's been determined by a competent tribunal, they're protected by the Geneva Conventions.  If we are to recapture the moral high ground, we have to abide by our already agreed upon international agreements.  Or as one Republican Senator  urlLink remarked  recently, when you're the good guys, you have to act like the good guys.

						   George Will ended a recent  urlLink column  (a column that should be read by every neoconservative everywhere) with the following quotation from Alexander Hamilton:  I have thought it my duty to exhibit things as they are, not as they ought to be.  He adds it's the core of conservatism.  I think it's my duty to add that while truth may indeed be the core of conservatism, our devotion to the truth should be painfully obvious as well.  We don't see truth as a liberal/conservative issue.  It would be a grotesquery to assert that just because The Honzman has been known to mislead us, that every other (or indeed  any  other) conservative would do the same in the same setting.  And while we are sure that there are many thoughtful conservatives out there thinking deep and subtle conservative thoughts, we'll continue to hold Fred's feet to the fire until be becomes one.  Goodnight everybody everywhere.  Goodnight.

						   First the mundane - Fred's show was a rerun again.  The program was from the 17th of May - go take a look at the posting from that date.  If time permits, there may be an elaboration on the Geneva Convention today.  And then the exceptional - We're in the news!  This week's (6/2/4-6/9/4)issue of the  urlLink Pittsburgh City Paper  has a short piece on this blog.  It's on page ten.  As soon as a link to the article can be found, it will be posted here.

						   Today (June 1, 2004) PCNC broadcast another rerun.  It was a show originally broadcast on April 29, 2004.  At present, I am pondering the ethics of deconstructing a rerun.  On the one hand, with hindsight anything that  seemed  correct at the time could later be proven to be wrong with no shame to anyone involved.  I mean, Newton is no less a genius just because he failed to intuit Einstein's theory of gravity.  On the other, if it can be shown that something in a rerun is internally inconsistent or if it can be shown that it was an obvious deception at the time, then it's fair game.  That being said, we turn to today's rerun.  Today Fred tried to debunk one of the 9-11 "myths."  He pulled out an   urlLink article  that was originally published in the LA Times and read these sentences on the air:  In one recent report, for example, the commission devoted almost a full page to addressing allegations that Saudi nationals including relatives of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden were allowed to leave the country on chartered jets in the immediate aftermath of the attack, while all other flights were still grounded.  In fact, six chartered flights carrying 142 Saudis did leave the country in the days after the attacks, the report said, and one plane had 26 passengers, "most of them relatives" of bin Laden.  But the commission cleared the government of any wrongdoing, saying that all of the passengers were screened by the FBI and other agencies, and that none of the planes left before commercial airspace was reopened.    The panel did say it had checked all of the names on the flight manifests against current government watch lists, and found no matches According to Fred, that proves there was no "special treatment" for the Saudis.  The commission said that there were no flights until after the ban was lifted and that the FBI "screened" all the passengers on those flights.  So there you have it - myth debunked.  Uh, not so fast.    As often happens with the Honzman, what he  omits  is just as important as what he says and he omitted this sentence from that article (It goes right after the word "reopened" and right before the words "The panel"):  The commission did not address reports in Vanity Fair magazine and other publications that Saudis were able to arrange flights within the United States before the ban was lifted so that they could gather at major airports for their overseas departure.   The Vanity Fair article, written by Craig Unger, was published in the October, 2003.  It's not available on-line as far as we can tell.  We were able to obtain a copy from Lexis-Nexis.  The public library has a copy but it's currently "at the bindery."  In any case, the article describes how jets were chartered to fly members of the Bin Laden and the Saudi Royal families to a number of the departure points  inside  the US while the flight ban was in place.  Some people were actually driven by the FBI to these departure points as well.  Once the airspace was opened up a few days after 9/11, the Saudis flew to Saudi Arabia.  Take a look again at the text of the LA Times article.  The reporter, Greg Miller, writes that  "none of the planes left before commercial airspace was reopened."   It doesn't say that there were no Saudi flights  inside  the US before commercial airspace was reopened, just that none of them "left" before commercial airspace was reopened.  This little bit of word-parsing allows the commission to appear to correct a "myth" while not actually contradicting it at all.  What happened, according to Vanity Fair, was that there were a number of chartered flights inside the US collecting members of the Bin Laden and the Saudi Royal families.  Few if any of them were interviewed by the FBI.  Miller and the Commission say that they were "screened" and their names had been checked against a current watch list, but is "screening" the same as "interviewing"?  Considering some of the recent news reports about the vagueness of the watch lists, they can not be considered a definitive list of "evil-doers" at all.    And anyway Miller points out the 9-11 commission did not address these reports.  So there was no denial and no explanation.    With Fred, what is said is just as important as important as what isn't.  Today was a good example.

						    First thing's first. Fred was back on the radio this afternoon. As ever, whatever our differences with his politics (and they are vast), we wish him good health.  Second, we heard an interesting promo during this afternoon's radio program. It went something like this:  A deep important voice is heard saying, "This is your brain." Immediately after that some basic run-of-the-mill chaotic cartoon sound effects are played. The voice then continues, "And this is your brain after listening to KDKA NewsTalk 1020." Within the sounds that follow, (and this is the interesting part) we hear a snippet from "The Wizard of Oz." It's from the end of the movie, when after the Scarecrow realizes he's smart, he spouts out some mathematical formula, thus showing everyone his Oz-bestowed intelligence.  The message of the promo is simple. Before listening to talk radio on this station, your thinking will be chaotic. Afterwards, you'll be smart. In itself, there's certainly nothing harmful about a talk radio station telling its audience that it will be educated by that stations programming.  The problem is in what the Scarecrow is heard saying. He says "The sum of the square roots of any two sides of an isoceles triangle is equal to the square root of the remaining side."  As a mathematical equation, this could not be any wronger.  urlLink Here's  a page that explains why.  We find the promo inadvertantly apt. The meaning we take from it is this: You might  think  you're smarter after listening to talk radio on KDKA. You might even  sound  smarter when you're repeating what you've heard. But like the Scarecrow misquoting the Pythagorean Theorem, you're  just plain wrong .  The fact that no one at KDKA has caught this goof is also rather sad. Didn't anyone over there ever take a math class?  But anyway even if the Tin Man got it right, Oz never did give nothing to the Tin Man, that he didn't didn't already have.

						      Since Fred is still recuperating...   Take a look at this  urlLink page  from the Government. It's from the Department of Labor Statistics and it shows the month-by-month employment numbers for the last two administrations up until June of 2004 (see graph below). Of course, if you are reading this much after July of 2004, our analysis below will be outdated.       Ignoring everything before 2001 for the moment, we can see clearly the damage done to the employment picture during the Bush Administration.&nbsp; It's not pretty.   If you add up all the numbers in the boxes (and we did) you'll see that they add up to a negative 1140.&nbsp; If we are reading this correctly, this means that&nbsp;there are so far 1.14 million jobs&nbsp;fewer jobs in America&nbsp;during the Bush Administration.&nbsp; That averages to a loss of about 27 thousand jobs per month.   With only 6 more months left in his administration, Bush would have to average 190 new jobs per month  just to break even. &nbsp; If he's looking to break even before the election,&nbsp; the economy will have to average 285 thousand new jobs per month.&nbsp; 285 thousand.   But we are nothing if not fair and balanced.&nbsp; So let's take a closer look at the numbers.&nbsp; We really shouldn't fault Bush for the dismal numbers of January 2001.&nbsp; As he was inaugurated at the end of that month, we'll start the count in February, 2001 and crunch the numbers from there.&nbsp;   Even then, his administration is still about one million jobs in the hole and the economy would have to create 270 thousand new jobs per month just to break even.   Bush has had 23 months of negative job growth in the&nbsp;42 months in office for which the DLS has&nbsp;information (22 if you discount Jan 2001).&nbsp; In either case, that's more than half, isn't it?   To be&nbsp;fair, the last 6 months (Jan to June 2004)&nbsp;have been pretty good.&nbsp; 1.2 million new jobs created at an average of 211 thousand new jobs per month.&nbsp; But widening the focus to the last year (Jul 2003 to June 2004) the&nbsp;lustre fades a little. 1.4 million new jobs at an average of 120 thousand jobs per month.&nbsp;   So&nbsp;even&nbsp;if the Bush administration can keep up that&nbsp;higher average (211 thousand new jobs per month) that's still not good enough&nbsp;for the&nbsp;White House to break even before the election.&nbsp; If the average keeps up for the rest of the year, the Bush Administration can proudly trumpet the fact that it would have a net gain of (now wait for it) 179 thousand new jobs in 4 years.&nbsp;   Remind us:&nbsp; We should trust this most untrustworthy man (and by that we mean George W. Bush)&nbsp;with the economy...why?   By the way, the numbers from the Clinton Administration&nbsp;offer a striking contrast.&nbsp; From Jan 1996 to Dec 2003, the economy averaged 238 thousand new jobs per month and almost 11.5 million&nbsp;jobs were created - with only three months with negative job growth.&nbsp;   All&nbsp;this while that impeachment&nbsp;thing was happening.   Something to&nbsp;think about.&nbsp;

						   We've done a little digging on the good Colin McNickle and found some interesting stuff.&nbsp; There's an adage about knowing someone from the company he keeps.&nbsp; If so the man that Teresa Heinz Kerry told to "shove it" keeps some very interesting company indeed.   So before we begin to think that Colin McNickle is some sort of kindly, even-handed, middle of the road editor of a Pittsburgh newspaper, let's delve into some history.&nbsp;   Let's begin with  urlLink Ann Coulter .   We quoted her yesterday.&nbsp; Like any good fractal image, Coulter becomes more and more detailed the closer you get.&nbsp; So here's some more prose from the column recently spiked by USAToday:   For 20 years, the Democrats wouldn't let Jimmy Carter within 100 miles of a Convention podium. The fact that Carter is now their most respectable speaker tells you where that party is today. Maybe they just want to remind Americans who got us into this Middle East mess in the first place. W've got millions of fanatical Muslims trying to slaughter Americans while shouting Allah Akbar!&nbsp; Yeah, let's turn the nation over to these guys. So  Jimmy Carter  is to blame for Islamic terrorism?&nbsp; Jimmy Carter - the born-again home builder for Habitat for Humanity who won the Nobel Peace Prize is to blame for the recent wave of Islamic attacks.&nbsp; Wow, Ann.&nbsp; That's a good one.&nbsp;   And here is what the good Colin McNickle  urlLink wrote  of the lovely Ann Coulter in 2002:    We don't need the Ann Coulters of the world to tone it down. And we certainly don't need fewer Ann Coulters. In fact, we need  more  Ann Coulters. And we need them to ratchet it up and throw more stones. For despite what you might be hearing from whiny liberals that conservatives control this nation's microphone of political discourse...  &nbsp;&nbsp;  Blah, blah, blah.&nbsp; Yea, yea, we've heard it all before.&nbsp;&nbsp; No wonder&nbsp;he was told to shove it.&nbsp; With columns like these, he should be told that more often.  We wonder if Mr McNickle has changed his opinion of the woman Al Franken calls "a nut case."&nbsp; If you wonder, too,&nbsp;drop him an  urlLink e-mail&nbsp; . Or you can call him. The phone number listed at the bottom of his columns is 412 320-7836. Tell him Mike Ellis sent you.   By the way, in the same column, Mr McNickle writes that global warning is science held hostage to an ideological agenda.&nbsp;&nbsp; We won't bother asking about how he feels about Creation Science, then.

						   Fred's still recuperating so we'll have to look elsewhere for stuff to comment on.  So&nbsp;we guess we'll have to say something about Teresa Heinz Kerry's journalistic  urlLink instructions  to&nbsp;Colin McNickle&nbsp;Pittsburgh&nbsp; urlLink Tribune-Review's &nbsp;editorial  urlLink page .  At this point all we can say is that if McNickle had responded by calling the Senator's wife a "fucking communist cunt" he would have been in good company with the owner of his paper, Richard Mellon Scaife.  Back in the early 80s, when&nbsp;asked about his financial support of&nbsp;what was then called "The New Right,"&nbsp; Richard Mellon Scaife responded in&nbsp;exactly the same  urlLink way .&nbsp; He then went on to&nbsp;disparage the physical appearance of the reporter asking the question.&nbsp; And then her teeth.&nbsp; And then her mother.&nbsp;&nbsp;We're not sure he ever said anything about the reporter's mother's teeth, so we'll assume he didn't.&nbsp; He ended the interchange with the veiled threat of, "Don't look behind you."&nbsp;   Nice guy, the owner of the Tribune Review.  Or if&nbsp;McNickle had called the Senator's Wife&nbsp;a  urlLink "sandal-wearing, hirsute, somewhat fragrant hippie-chick pie wagon"  he would have been in good company with Ann Coulter, one of the many Conservative pundits who routinely accuse the left of uncivil discourse.  What is a "pie wagon" anyway?  So before we let the right-wing complain about how the left is hypocritical in, on the one hand, calling for a more civil discourse while, on the other, telling a reporter to shove it, we should remember that Vice-President&nbsp;Dick Cheney told&nbsp;Senator Leahy&nbsp;to&nbsp;go fuck himself and that&nbsp;Candidate Bush, in 2000 called New York Times reporter Adam Clymer an asshole.  &nbsp;

						   This summer, Disney acted on releasing two remarkably different documentaries.&nbsp; One, Fahrenheit 911, they rejected.&nbsp; The other, America's Heart and Soul, they released with much fanfare.   Dan Glaister of the Guardian in the UK has  urlLink this  to say about the latter:   Nobody at Disney was willing to comment for this article, preferring to let the fate of America's Heart and Soul slip quietly into the night. But the film, whatever its aesthetic failings and its apple-pie sensibility, has been done a disservice by some of the misguided efforts to promote it. Although Disney denies that it was released as a deliberate counter to Fahrenheit 9/11, some of its promotion stressed it as a counterpoint to the overt politicking of Moore's film.  And the results? Get a gander at this:   urlLink Fahrenheit 911 &nbsp;has taken in $103  Million,  while &nbsp;  urlLink America's Heart and Soul &nbsp;has taken in $313  Thousand. &nbsp;  (Emphasis added) &nbsp;  And so Fred (and for&nbsp;the rest&nbsp;of you without calculators), Fahrenheit 911 has taken in roughly 300 times as much as America's Heart and Soul - so far.&nbsp;

						    (Maybe Some of Those Retired 58 Year-olds Being Sent to Iraq)    "What a big man Fred is for inviting me to do it because our politics are diametrically opposed." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Chris Moore ( urlLink WQED  &  urlLink KDKA Radio )  We couldn't agree more with the callers to the program who said that having Chris Moore host the show was a breathe of fresh air.  Friday's show featured a thoughtful, reasoned discussion of the 9/11 Commission Report with guest  urlLink Dan Simpson , Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Foreign Affairs Assistant Editor.  Ever the diplomat, Mr. Simpson--who is a former ambassador--does seem to lean ever so slightly left or right depending on the host so he was positively delightful on Friday.  He noted that the report was 'particularly blistering' about the need for diplomacy (which we think even Bush's most ardent admirers would not think is his strong suit).  He said what's needed now is:  1.  A clear timetable for withdrawing our troops. 2. Set up a conference to discuss the region and not just with the usual suspects, but with the neighboring countries in that region including the "bad guys."  Mr. Moore pointed out that Bush had to be dragged into calling for the 9/11 Commission--something I have to assume Honsberger would not have pointed out.  The program also featured Donald Scales, a steelworker and union member.  Mr. Scales personally supports Ralph Nader, though as he is concerned that US taxpayers are paying to support outsourcing, he should take a visit to John Kerry's website to see that Sen. Kerry would  urlLink end the tax breaks for outsourcing.     *************    Thursday's program had Louis ‘Hop’ Kendrick of the  urlLink New Pittsburgh Courier  as a guest.  The conversation largely centered on Bill Cosby's controversial take on poverty and African-American culture.  While taking personal responsibility is never a bad thing, referring to any child as 'dirty laundry' just doesn't 'wash' with me.  Apparently, I'm not alone in this feeling:

						   Once upon a time in a&nbsp;Local Cable Access&nbsp;Galaxy far far away, there was&nbsp;a planet called "PCNC."&nbsp; And they USED to have two&nbsp;different news-talk shows - one liberal and one conservative.&nbsp; John McIntire hosted (note the past tense of the verb)&nbsp; the liberal show and our Fred Honsberger hosts (notice the present tense) the conservative&nbsp;show.&nbsp;   Good idea?&nbsp; Bad idea?&nbsp; We report - you decide.   In any event, McIntire now writes for the  urlLink City Paper &nbsp;and by an odd coincidence, he also wrote something about our Junior Senator, Rick Santorum. The column can&nbsp;be found  urlLink here .&nbsp; Here is one salient point that McIntire makes:   We don't have Osama, Homeland Security lunkhead Tom Ridge says Osama's cronies are likely going to kill some of us soon, and what is Rick Santorum's obsession? Whether the gay couple next door has a piece of paper in a dresser drawer that says one can get the other's Social Security benefits in the event of death. Good column.&nbsp; Go read it.   And then there  urlLink this  from the Richard Mellon Scaife-owned Tribune Review.&nbsp; Honestly, we don't know where to begin.&nbsp;   On the first item, on Linda Ronstadt's exile from Alladin casino, they tell a very tightly-knit story - too bad they carefully omitted some important details.&nbsp; They say that "The audience went crazy" and Ronstadt&nbsp;was escorted from the premises.&nbsp;&nbsp; If one hadn't heard the actual story, one might think that the WHOLE audience "went crazy" and that's just not the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even the Ronald Reagan's favorite newspaper, The&nbsp;Washington Times, was a bit more even handed.&nbsp; They urlLink  describe &nbsp;the scene this way:&nbsp;&nbsp;  Near the close of her performance, Miss Ronstadt dedicated the Eagles' hit "Desperado" to Mr. Moore, producer of "Fahrenheit 9/11," and the room erupted into equal parts boos and cheers.  Equal parts boos and cheers.&nbsp;   They also stated that while there were almost 5,000 people at the concert, it was "hundreds of angry fans" who streamed from the show - some vandalizing and defacing Casino property as they went.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Hundreds out of thousands. Hardly the whole audience, we presume. You decide.   And the last sentence, "What would they [critics of the Alladin's decision] be saying if the hotel had allowed the offended audience to attack Ronstadt?" is very telling.&nbsp; Why would the hotel allow the offended audience to attack anyway?&nbsp;Wasn't there any security present?&nbsp; And if so, why didn't they go after the angry audience members vandalizing the casino?&nbsp; Is the Trib telling us that the Alladin  did Ronstadt a favor  by "protecting her" from the decent Americans she so rudely offended?   So much for respect for free speech at the Alladin.&nbsp; And at the Tribune-Review.   On to the second item, the Trib criticizes the full-page protest ad taken out in the New York Times recently by  urlLink Moveon.org &nbsp;. &nbsp;  urlLink Here  is the ad so you can read it yourself.&nbsp;   Mr Scaife's little newspaper that could, while calling Moveon.org "nuts," omits all the content of the ad.&nbsp; All they say is that Moveon.org uses some "comments" from Walter Cronkite to "prove" its case.&nbsp; Yea, comments like this one:&nbsp;  All the Fox News programs get daily marching orders from the top, specifying the days stories and slant.&nbsp; Says Cronkite: I've never heard of any network or any other legitimate news organization doing that."  And now the third item. We'll reprint it in its entirety for your edification.   Ascendant Santorum : Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist won't seek re-election in 2006. And the odds-on favorite to succeed him is none other than U.S. Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, should he win re-election that same year. And insiders tell the wrap that Mr. Santorum likely will make it his last term, what with his large family and longing to make more money. Of course, the specter of a Frist-Santorum or Chuck Hagel-Santorum ticket in 2008 could keep Santorum in Washington. Stay tuned.  So we guess it's a good news/bad news thing. The good news is that the Trib quotes insiders saying that if anything, we'd have only six more years of the Senator's presence  if  he is re-elected. The bad news can be summed up in four words:  Senate Majority Leader Santorum . And the really bad news can be summed up in two:  President Santorum .

						     I found something interesting at Reuters.com.&nbsp; Our junior Senator  urlLink Rick Santorum  had  urlLink this  to say about the Sandy Berger/Document situation:     "Right after the documents were taken, John Kerry held a photo op and attacked the president on port security. The documents that were taken may have been utilized for that press conference." The document(s) in question, according to Berger's attorney, Lanny Breuer, were the pages of a memo Berger had asked Richard Clarke to write as a review of the government's responses to the countries Millenium terror threats.   As a voter and a taxpayer, I'd like to know the Senator's reasoning here. It's a very serious charge he makes.&nbsp; How does he think this review of the Clinton Administration's response to terror in 1999-2000 was used to criticize the current administration? Undoubtedly there's a transcript of this photo op/press conference&nbsp;that the Senator mentions. Was there a reference to the document or its contents?&nbsp; Is there any proof that Senator Kerry knew&nbsp;anything about these documents?&nbsp;   Unless he answers those questions, we will assume that his use of the phrase "may have been" is just his cowardly way of attacking without having to back it up with any facts. If he fails to present those facts, then the "The Cowardly Attacker"&nbsp;label will stick.&nbsp;&nbsp; Remember, Bill Clinton "may have" fathered a child with an Arkansas prostitute.&nbsp; But that story turned out to be total crap, too.   By the way, Berger's attorney  urlLink said  on CNN:    &nbsp;  I've been told since October that he [Berger] was no more than a subject of this investigation. I was told to draw absolutely no negative inferences whatsoever from the fact that this investigation had been going on. I've been told by the Department of Justice that they couldn't be more pleased with the manner in which Sandy Berger and I have been handling this and have been cooperative. And I've been told that the Department of Justice had wanted to get this resolved.   The only thing that I had asked was that this not become a partisan affair and that people who didn't understand the facts would start making assertions. And, Wolf, that's exactly what happened this week when someone in the administration, some law enforcement person decided it was time to leak the document and treat this investigation not seriously.   So there it is.&nbsp; The Ashcroft Justice Department has been investigating this since at least October and is happy with the cooperation its received from Berger and Breuer.&nbsp; And yet this story is leaked  the very week  the 9/11 Commission report is set to be released.   Curious, don't you think?

						   We're in a bit of a quandry over here at HL.&nbsp; Now that Fred is off the radar screen for a while (and we still wish him the best of health), what do we do now? &nbsp; After some internal discussion among the staff here at "Honsberger is a Liar" we (both of us) have decided to expand the focus of this blog - just a bit. &nbsp;  Here's the plan -  &nbsp; In the course of writing for this blog, we discovered that Fred uses as a main source of his "news" a conservative website called  urlLink Newsmax .&nbsp; It's a pretty interesting site, if your politics are just to the right of Barry Goldwater.&nbsp;&nbsp; There's nothing to keep us from looking at the "news" they post at Newsmax and analysing that.&nbsp; Or the  urlLink Drudgereport .&nbsp; And so on.

						   A great many Conservative mouthpieces have recently been repeating&nbsp;a Republican talking point - one that says that John Edwards is "the fourth most liberal" Senator in the Congress (incidentally, the same story has John Kerry as "the most" liberal). For the moment, let's just look at the "Edwards" part of the story.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  As we are not sure whether Fred himself has ever used this line, we'll assume he hasn't.&nbsp; We wouldn't want to accuse him of something we don't specifically know&nbsp;he's committed.&nbsp; That just seems so, uh, Bush-like, doesn't it?&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  In any event,&nbsp;here's George Bush  urlLink saying  the misrepresentation.&nbsp;&nbsp;The AP story reports that:    Bush called Kerry the Senate's most liberal member and said Edwards was the fourth most liberal. "Back in Massachusetts, that's what they call balancing the ticket," Bush chided.&nbsp;  &nbsp;

						       First off - today's program was yet another rerun.  Bummer.  Second, we were reluctant to post anything new today.  Liz'  urlLink post  on the VNS was so good, we didn't want anything to get in its way.  That and we were just really lazy today.  Third, some good news.  Our employment status has changed.  It will now be impossible to post the daily analysis of Fred Honsberger's misreperesentations in the middle of the afternoon.  Liz may still be able to post during the day, of course.  We will try to keep up as much as possible.  We still looking for Fred Honsberger's denounciation of the RNC's Hitler Ad.    How 'bout it Fred?  Don't you think the RNC's use of Hitler-imagery to demonize American Democrats is just a little more offensive than Whoopi Goldberg's pubic hair jokes?  Unfortunately, your silence on this matter makes us think you think otherwise.  Bummer.

						   This post refers to the June 30th show which makes it very late indeed, but the events spoken about on that program refer back to Election 2000 so what’s a week or two more when we’re speaking about events that happened four years ago in the first place?   A caller--speaking of    urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11   --brought up John Ellis (Bush cousin who called the 2000 Election for Bush for Fox News). In chastising the caller for caring about this conflict of interest, Honsberger said that the Voter News Service (VNS) projects the winner of the election; that exit polls do not enter into VNS' calculations for predicting early calls; and that Ellis's call of a Bush victory made no difference in the election outcome.  Let's take a closer look at Honsberger's pronouncements:  First, as can be seen in the  urlLink testimony given by Ted C. Savaglio, Executive Director, Voter News Service  to The Committee on Energy and Commerce in The U. S. House of Representatives on February 14, 2001 VNS  DOES  use polling as part of their projection process:   "In addition to providing information to analyze election results, on Election Night VNS projects the outcome of contests to its members and subscribers. VNS' projections are based on complex statistical analyses that take many factors into account including, among other things: the actual vote in sample precincts, tabulated vote at the county level, and the exit poll. All of this data is reviewed and interpreted by VNS analysts who add their own knowledge and experience before making a decision that it is possible to project the outcome in a given race. Projections are made by people - not by computers."  So Fred Honsberger is either ignorant of the process here or disseminating disinformation.  Honsberger said that there was no conflict of interest in Fox News having John Ellis functioning in this position, but as reported on CNN, Ellis's other election night activities that evening lay well outside his job description,  urlLink  “He apparently spent the evening in constant phone contact with Florida governor Jeb Bush and George W. Bush, transmitting updated exit poll numbers and projections down to Austin.”   It was certainly reported at the time that the Bushes were confident that their numbers showed they would win Florida—did they convey this to Ellis at the time he was in constant phone contact with them and did this in any way reflect on his call of the election?  Even Fox anchor Brit Hume was less than confident about projecting Bush as the winner that night when he said,  urlLink  "I must tell you, everybody, after all this, all night long, we put Bush at 271, Gore at 243. I feel a little bit apprehensive about the whole thing. I have no reason to doubt our decision desk, but there it is."   Now to the important question as to whether or not the projection of Bush as the winner by Fox News made any difference in the eventual outcome of the election, urlLink  lets all take a step back in time and recall how the events unfolded that night:      With information provided from the Voter News Service, NBC was the first network to project Gore the winner in Florida at 7:48 pm.  At 7:50 pm, CNN and CBS project Gore the winner in Florida as well.” By 8:02 pm, all five networks and the Associated Press had called Gore the winner in Florida. Even the VNS called Gore the winner at 7:52 pm. At 2:16 am, Fox calls Florida for Bush, NBC follows at 2:16 am. ABC is the last network to call the Florida for Bush, at 2:20 am, while AP and VNS never call Florida for Bush.   Ten minutes after the top of the hour, network excitement was again beginning to build. At 2:16 a.m., the call was made: Fox News Channel, with Bush's first cousin John Ellis running its election desk, was the first to project Florida -- and the presidency -- for the Texas governor. Within minutes, the other networks followed suit. "George Bush, Governor of Texas will become the 43rd President of the United States," CNN's Bernard Shaw announced atop a graphic montage of a smiling Bush. "At 18 minutes past two o'clock Eastern time, CNN declares that George Walker Bush has won Florida's 25 electoral votes and this should put him over the top."   In other words, even by 2 am, no other network felt confident enough to call the election for Bush or Gore even though VNS had projected Gore winning Florida hours before. It was Fox News, under the direction of John Ellis, who first splattered the airwaves with ‘Bush Wins’ patriotic graphics that goaded the other networks to follow suit because—after all—we all know that the networks are in a race to declare the winner on election night. The public was left with the indelible imagery of ‘Bush Wins’ on that night and it was an uphill battle for Gore from then on.  Fox continued to amplify this message by a constant barrage of daily ‘Sore Loserman’ references on their ‘Fox and Friends’ morning show.    But after everything that has come out about this mess of an election, Honsberger would still have you believe that VNS called Florida for Bush; that VNS makes purely objective calls based solely on precinct returns; and that the other networks are in no way influenced when one of their brethren makes a pronouncement on the winner.  Bullshit or perhaps that should be Bushit.   * * *   In more recent news, here’s another story that we don’t expect the Honz to report on:   On July 8th, the Congress voted on an amendment to Section 215 of the USA Patriot Act to prevent the government from using this section of the act to go to the federal secret court to get an order requiring the disclosure of Americans' reading records.  After the 17 minute time limit expired the amendment had won 219-201 (with almost 30 Republicans voting for the amendment). But this wasn’t the outcome that Bush wanted so the Republicans kept the voting open twice as long as scheduled and twisted a few arms until they got a tie vote of 210-210 (which defeated the amendment).  The shouts of ‘Shame’ by the Democrats rising to their feet did not dissuade the Republicans from this outrageous overturning of voting because, as we know, the Republicans have a history of overturning elections. I guess if that tactic hadn’t worked they could have simply had the Homeland Security Office announce that the voting would have to be suspended due to terrorist concerns—but wait—they may be saving that trick for November.

						        Friends;  We can't say that our predictions were wrong for this mornings show.  The reason being, this morning's show was another rerun.  Our colleague Liz has already written (and written very well) on this program.  You can find them  urlLink here  and  urlLink here .  Way to go, Liz!  So it's a slow news day here at "Honsberger is a Liar."  Perhaps we'll struggle through an hour or so of Fred's radio show and report back about that.  Or perhaps not.

						                  Predictions for Today        First off, we have to say that our prediction record has not been very good here at “Honsberger is a Liar.”  But that does not stop us from trying.  Assuming Fred is live today, we predict he’ll go with  urlLink this  AP news story saying that there’s “no bounce” to the poll numbers after Kerry announced Edwards as a running mate.  He'll use it to undermine the logic of the choice etc etc, blah-blah-blah, yadda yadda yadda.  We’re sure that if Fred runs with this story, he’ll mention the “no bounce” part while conveniently omitting this from the end of the story:   Even though the race remains close, weekend polls found encouraging news for Edwards.  Almost half, 47 percent, said in a Time-CNN poll that Edwards would make a better president than the current vice president, Dick Cheney, while 38 percent said Cheney would be better.  When people were asked in a Newsweek poll who they would pick if they could vote separately for vice president, they chose Edwards by 52 percent to 41 percent for Cheney.    This part would seem to say that a larger chunk of American people disagrees (rather than agrees) with George Bush when he says that, when comparing Senator John Edwards to Dick Cheney, “Dick Cheney can be President.”  The interesting thing here is that the bounce story hinges on whether the Kerry-Edwards ticket would have produced a double-digit bounce in the first place.  And where did that prediction come from?  Take a look at   urlLink this  paragraph from gallup.com:   This past week, for example, George W. Bush's presidential campaign made an "expected Kerry bounce" announcement, distributed to the press and conspicuously posted on the Bush-Cheney campaign Web site. Bush strategist Matthew Dowd wrote that he anticipates a Democratic bounce that will leave President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney at least 15 points behind their Democratic challengers, Sens. John Kerry and John Edwards, by the end of the month, following the Democratic National Convention. As Dowd said, "Assuming that Kerry enjoys the average challenger's bounce … we should expect the state of the race to swing wildly to his favor by early August."  So the expectation of a bounce came from the Republican party – and accepted by their mouthpieces (including Fred Honsberger) in the so-called liberal media.

						       Since today’s TV program was a repeat, we decided to wade out into the murky waters of Fred’s radio program on KDKA-1020, Pittsburgh.   What an eye opening experience.    We should state upfront that we only got to experience the first hour of his three-hour rant-fest.  The complete first hour (excluding the necessary and non-political weather and traffic updates) was taken up by a discussion of American “values” and how debased they are.  Case in point (and this part took up most of the hour) was the Democratic fundraiser last night in New York City.  Fred, along with the rest of the right-wing media, was gravely offended by Whoopi Goldberg’s genitalia jokes.  He was also offended, it seems, that Senators Kerry and Edwards weren’t offended at all at the show.  We find this to be a curious window into The Honzman’s own set of values.  For a person to rant for an hour at a comedian exercising her First Amendment rights at a political rally while remaining silent about the rest of the day's news is rather telling, sorry to say.    The rest of today's news included a  urlLink report   released today criticizing the CIA over it’s handling of the pre-war intelligence,  the news describing Ken Lay  urlLink surrendering  federal authorities, and the  urlLink report  that the number of dead coalition soldiers has topped 1,000.   None of these got a mention in the first hour of the Fred Honsberger radio show.    What is more important, finding out that the intelligence used to justify the war (and subsequent deaths of thousands of Iraqis) is wrong or Whoopi Goldberg's vagina jokes?  Obviously it's the vagina jokes.  The arrest of Ken Lay?  Although he was George Bush's biggest campaign contributor and now he's been arrested for some corporate shenanigans, it's the vagina jokes.  The fact that 1,000 members of the "Coalition of the Willing" are now dead because of the Iraq war?  Again - those prickly vagina jokes are more offensive.  To be fair, Fred  has  denounced the Vice President's use of "Go Fuck yourself" on the Senate floor, but we can't remember hearing him express any outrage when George Bush made light of his administration's inability to find weapons of mass destruction.  Which  is  more important, Fred?  Vagina jokes or the deaths of a thousand men and women, sacrificed for a now-discredited cause?  The fact that you're focussing your audience's attention on one and not the other is telling.  And maybe that's the point.

						   Today's show is a repeat from June 24th.  For notes on that show please, check the following links:   urlLink Callou, Callay!    urlLink A Shout Out!   One throwaway line I just caught from Honsberger from this show: "As far as Laura Bush killing another woman in a car accident, she was a teenager.  A teenager having a car accident. Gee, that's unusual!"  Well first of all, she killed someone she had been dating, so unless Fred is breaking a story here that Laura is a lesbian, she killed a man, not a woman (some may think she showed rather poor judgment in the choice of which boyfriend she terminated).    Also, I would think that while many teenagers have auto accidents, a relatively small amount actually end up killing anyone (just a guess).   And, yes, I will get around to posting that "short piece on the Voter News Service" sometime soon now that Pittsburgh is (temporarily) no longer Election Central.  Though now I feel the VNS thing has been built up too much, so maybe that's a good excuse to bag it--or not--anyone up for a vote on it?

						       We won't be making any predictions today.  Not that we  can't , mind you, but just that we've decided to do something different instead.  So in place of our usual "We predict that..." posting, we are presenting to our audience a list of topics we'd love to hear Fred Honsberger address.  Of course, we do not harbor any illusions that he will.  If the recent past is any indication, he'll be ranting about either John Edwards career as a trial lawyer or Michael Moore's movie.  Oops, that was a prediction, wasn't it.  Sorry.   The List   The RNC's "Hitler Ad"       We're still waiting for Fred to try to rationalize the Republican National Committee's use of Hitler to discredit the Democratic party.   The Administration's "July Surprise"       The New Republic is  urlLink reporting  that the Bush Administration has been putting pressure on Pakistan to capture Osama Bin Laden before the November elections.  (Do we have to wonder why?)  The story goes on to assert that Pakistan has been told that the last ten days of July would be a great time to make any capture announcement.  Hmm...that's when the Democratic Convention is taking place.  What's up with that, Fred?  Can the current administration possibly be manipulating the war on terror for political gains?   The Saddam Statue Toppling        The LA Times has reported that the now-famous Statue-Toppling was, in fact, staged by US Military Psyops.  It was not a spontaneous celebration of Saddam's removal at all.  We wonder how many people are sifting through the Administration's comments on it.  Did they present it to us as "spontaneous?"  If so, then it's yet another lie from the Bush crowd.  What of it, Fred?  Any comment on how our country's military manufactured events for obvious partisan political gain?   Administration's Democracy-Promotion Funding       From the  urlLink Boston Globe : The Bush administration, while stating that democracy is the cornerstone of its Mideast policy, has directed more than half of the funds in its key democracy-promotion initiative to assist autocratic regimes in promoting free trade and education.  The piece goes on to say that $6 million went to the Kingdom of Morrocco "as it opens its markets to US competition."  Funny, it seems to be pointing to the queasy notion that, for this administration, opening up autocratic regimes to US markets might actually be more important that spreading Democracy.  Any comments on that one, Fred?  As we stated above, we have no illusions that Fred Honsberger will comment on any of these stories.  Or if he does, he'll certainly blame them all on the Clinton Administration.  Finished at 9:00 am

						       Today's program was, for the most part, a pretty blunt character assassination of Senator John Edwards.    We have to say upfront that Fred has yet to use any of the catch phrases we predicted he'd use (so we were wrong on that one).  However at our count, he did call Senator Edwards an "ambulance chaser" three times and that just about set the tone for the entire hour.  Like the rest of the right-wing media, Fred is looking to taint the Senator's reputation with the "trial lawyers are evil and greedy " charge.  The thing is, we are surprised that Fred (or anyone else) would use such a broad brush here.  Picture a court room.  On the one side is the Plaintiff (Fred's favorite today was a young cerebral palsy victim) on the other side is the Defendant.   Both  are represented by trial lawyers, aren't they Fred?  But the BIG clunker that Fred told occurred at the end of the hour.  He was discussing LBJ's "Great Society" programs and pointed out that while they cost $8 Trillion, the poverty rate has remained the same since LBJ's time.  This is just plain wrong.  Take a look at this  urlLink chart .  Scroll down to the second page and look for the words:  Percent Poor.  In 1957, according to the Government's own statistics, 22.4% of the American population was poor.  On the same chart, the statistics clearly show that the percentage of the population that was poor drops to 12.6% by 1970.  And that they've stayed relatively the same for three decades.  And as Joseph Califano  urlLink pointed  out some years ago,  from 1963 when Lyndon Johnson took office until 1970 as the impact of his Great Society programs were felt, the portion of Americans living below the poverty line dropped from 22.2 percent to 12.6 percent, the most dramatic decline over such a brief period in this century.  Perhaps Fred was trying to pull a statistical fast one and was comparing the  number  of people who are poor, as opposed to the  percentage  of people who are poor.    Sorry Fred, but that doesn't work either.    If you were to look at the chart just above the "Percent Poor" you'd see a chart called "Number Poor (millions)."  According to this chart, 39.5 million people were poor in 1959.  This number drops to 25.3 million in 1970.  The curious thing can be seen in the last column.  It shows that where 31.1 million people were poor in 2000 (Bill Clinton's last year in office, by the way) one would have to go all the way back to 1980 (Jimmy Carter's last year in office, by the way) to find a smaller number.  So even with two decades of population growth, Clinton's real numbers are  still lower  than the numbers from the preceeding two Republican administrations.  But we digress.  The point here is not to show that there were slightly more poor people under Reagan and Bush 41 than under Bill Clinton, but to show that Fred was just plain wrong when he said that the poverty rate remained unchanged from LBJ's time to now.  Unless of course, he meant to say that the poverty rate dropped during the Johnson Administration because of those Great Society programs and that succeeding administrations, by continuing to fund those programs, has stabilized the poverty rate to roughly the same level - slightly higher under preceeding Republican Administrations and slightly lower under Democratic Administrations.  Is that what you meant, Fred?  Please let us know.

						   If you're looking to write to someone about the Fred Honsberger show (either positive or negative) here's some info for you:  Fred himself can be e-mailed  urlLink here .  PCNC (the TV Station Fred is on) is the local cable access "arm" to Pittsburgh's NBC affiliate, WPXI.  Their general contact page is  urlLink here .  The "Public Affairs" person at WPXI also has an e-mail page.  It can be found  urlLink here .  And finally WPXI is owned by  urlLink Cox Enterprises  and their contact page can be found  urlLink here .  Although this blog is generally anti-Fred, we feel that it is in the public's interest to have the means to communicate with Fred Honsberger and the organizations he works for readily available to anyone interested.    It's only fair - we get to let Fred know when we believe he's misrepresenting an issue.  So if there's someone out there who disagrees with us, we feel that we should give them ample access to let him know when they believe he's doing a good job.

						       Fred Honsberger spent most of the hour with State Representative  urlLink Mike Turzai  discussing the recently signed law that allows slot machines in the state of Pennsylvania.  As we have stated previously, we do not disagree with The Honz on this issue.  We may not share the level of The Honsman's contempt for slot machine gambling, but we can not disagree with him on this.  Honesty above all else.  In the remaining non-gambling slivers of the hour (and these were slight slivers, to be sure) Fred did get in some Kerry/Edwards bashing.  Though in the spirit of full disclosure we have to say that he did not mention any of the catch phrases we were sure he'd use ("liberal trial lawyer," "flip-flop" and of course "McCain was Kerry's first choice").  Give him time.  We are planning on keeping track over the next few days, just for larfs.  Fred was up to his old tricks early in the hour.  He began by teasing the audience saying that he knows a good way to make $10,000.  He quotes, though doesn't name, an   urlLink article  in Time Magazine (here reprinted at MichaelMoore.com) in which Moore states: I'm thinking of offering a $10,000 reward for anyone that can find a single fact [in Fahrenheit 911] that's wrong.   Fred goes on to say that he's shown many facts to be wrong.  We disagree with this, of course.  Fred mentioned Michael Isikoff's recent  urlLink article  in Newsweek, that states that Fahrenheit 911 makes the claim that the bin Laden family was flown out of the country without being interviewed by the FBI.  Isikoff says that 911 Commission documents show that to be false.  And so there you have it.  One of Moore's facts is wrong.  Moore lies.  The Check's in the mail.  However, reality looks a little different.  As Craig Unger, author and source of a great deal of the movie  urlLink points out , neither he nor the movie claims that the bin Laden family was never interviewed by the FBI (and Fred, you'd know this if  you bothered to see the movie ).  The point Moore made is that the interviews that did occur were not the sort of inquiry that a murder investigation requires.  According to Unger, what Isikoff said (that there were no interviews) is "a complete fabrication."  Unger continues by saying that a  ...week after [the article] appeared, Newsweek apologized for [that] fabrication...in its print edition of the magazine. But the error remains uncorrected online where it continues to be desseminated by other media.   So Unger is right, Isikoff is wrong and an example used by Fred Honsberger to show that Fahrenheit 911 is a fraud, is itself a fraud.  Fred, you really need a better fact-checker.  It's embarrassing when you stumble like this.

						             Predictions for Today       We imagine the Fahrenheit 911 stuff will be pushed aside by the Kerry/Edwards story, although we won't be surprised if there's still some remnants of Moore-bashing on today's program.  While (as far as we know) Fred still hasn't bothered to see the movie, he does pull off sounding like expert on it, doesn't he?  Talented guy, our Fred.  By the way, he has yet to offer ONE EXAMPLE of something factually wrong about the movie.     We suspect that Fred will continue to parrot the party line on John Edwards.  Here's the current buzz from the RNC and its lackeys in the so-called "liberal" media:   McCain was Kerry's first choice Edwards is a "liberal trial lawyer" Edwards is young and inexperienced Kerry's choice of Edwards constitutes a "flip-flop" We'll be counting the number of times The Honz uses each of these phrases.  And we'll be posting the results later today - so stay tuned!  On a non-Fred note, today is Gustav Mahler's birthday!  A Krispy Kreme and coffee to anyone who can tell us where the texts for  Das Liede von der Erde  came from.

						         Sorry folks, no predictions today.  Also, we may not get to Fred's misrepresentations as we will be at  urlLink this  rally this morning.  Look for a guy in a Pittsburgh Pirates baseball cap and say hi.  Heeheehee.  Ok, maybe ONE prediction:  If Fred is on live today, he'll continue to malign Fahrehneit 911. BTW, the movie has made a  urlLink ton  of money, but we don't think Fred will mention that, either.  We will try to suffer through the afternoon repeat and analyse from there.

						   IN CONGRESS, July 4, 1776.     The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America,  When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.  We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world. He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good. He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them. He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.  He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.  He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people. He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within. He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands. He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers. He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries. He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance. He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures. He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power. He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation: For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us: For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States: For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world: For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:  For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury: For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies: For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments: For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever. He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us. He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.  He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation. He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.  He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions. In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.  Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.  We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.

						     How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,  Seem to us all the uses of this world!   For the Mighty Fred Honsberger repeats  A weary weedy weather-bitten hour. Tales of Clinton's "lies" he burps up past us Th'odious lib'rul media gets spanked, too. O, that this too too solid flesh would melt Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!  Then we wouldn't have to hear Fred's crap more than once.  (Our sincerest apologies to Shakespeare and any Danish Prince who happens to read this blog.)  Liz tells us that she will be working on a short piece on the Voter News Service, while we will be doing a short piece on something else.  Perhaps taxes, perhaps the weather.  In any event, we are sure Liz' posting will be much more interesting.  Posted 11:00 am

						             Predictions for Today   Just a short note today.  After perusing what we believe to be Fred's main news sources (Drudge, FoxNews, and NewsMax), we can't honestly come to any firm conclusion as to what The Honz will talk about today.  We're pretty sure he'll continue to rant about  urlLink Fahrenheit 911 .    He may also talk about Bill Cosby and  urlLink this  story.  The first sentence says that Cosby has gone off on another "tirade against the Black Community."  We're absolutely sure he won't talk about  urlLink this .  It's a story on how the CIA was ordered to redo analyses that showed no operational connection between Iraq and al-qaeda.   Oh, yea.  He still hasn't mentioned or repudiated the RNC's Hitler Ad on his TV show.  This is, what, 3 days now?  posted 8:20 am

						       There isn't much to analyze on today's Honsberger Live! program.  This is not to say the hour wasn't full of stuff, just that the stuff within the hour isn't much to analyze.  Most of the hour was devoted to talking about the pros and cons of slot-machines.  As much as it pains us to admit it, we can not find much to disagree with The Honz on this issue.  So The Honsman gets a pass on this one.  He should consider it a birthday gift.  HOWEVER, he did stumble back into Moore-bashing late in the hour.  Declaring on live TV no less, that "Michael Moore is in league with Saddam Hussein."  Owing to the McCarthyite tactic of demonizing by association.  This time, Saddam Hussein said something that Fred thinks Michael Moore would easily agree with.  So (drumroll, please) they're "in league."  We realize that while it's only a rhetorical florish, we don't believe Quintilian would approve.  After a brief monologue on Saddam Hussein's court trial, Fred Honsberger wondered aloud to his audience whether any of Saddam's victims were ever afforded the same rights that he is enjoying.  The answer is an obvious and resounding no.  Sean Penn is completely correct in saying that Saddam is "a beast among men."  We presume Fred's point was assert, yet again, how crappy life was in Iraq before the invasion.  The implication to any dissenting is then, "So you prefer we didn't invade Iraq?"  The argument being that if we didn't invade Iraq then he'd still be doing ghastly things.  No doubt all of this is true.  It is a great thing that Saddam Hussein is no longer able to butcher anyone anymore.  However, inadvertantly perhaps, Fred stumbled into some rhetorical dung of his own making.  By casting in stark relief our system of justice and Saddam's, he raised a  question that we'd now love for him to answer: 1) If our system of justice is so much better because the accused are guaranteed fair trials and automatic rights, then what does that say about the Justice Department's efforts to circumvent those same rights when dealing with the so-called "enemy combatants?   One last thing:  In responding to an "after hours" phone call questioning the validity of the 2000 election, Fred reiterated, in an exasperated voice, that liberals should "get over" it.    Sorry Fred, but we can't.  That "election" was such a profound insult to any concept of Democracy that it simply can't be "gotten over."  One of the primary definitions of a free and democratic society is that, for better or worse, the people get to decide who governs them.  In this case, the Supreme Court decided when the vote count would end, thus ensuring their preferred candidate's "election."  How can any democracy (or republic) that accepts such an insult be considered free?

						             Predictions for Today   Prediction:  We are not making any strong predictions today, beyond saying that Fred will probably continue in his attempts to discredit "Fahrenheit 911" and he will probably not mention the RNC's "Hitler Ad."  Go take a look.  It's at the Official Bush Re-election  urlLink website .  Just hit the link on the word "Pessimism."  Follow up:  Although we are more-or-less happy with our discussion of Steven Hayes' book ( urlLink here's  one and  urlLink here's  another.), we found some more great source info on it. Check  urlLink it  out.  Media Matters is a great source of info.  Posted 9:29am

						   Take a look at today's " urlLink Midweek Briefing " at The Tribune-Review. The last item reads:  The latest CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll of likely voters shows that the Kerry-Edwards ticket received no "bounce" from last week's coronation in Boston. In fact, the poll suggests the Democrat team has slipped farther behind the Republicans. All that kumbaya for nothing.  We can see where Fred Honsberger gets his ability to cherrypick the news. While the above is  almost  true (we can't see where the Trib got the "slipping  further  behind" thing - they were never "behind" in the first place!), the writer at Mellon Scaife's Little Paper that Could conveniently omits another poll that contradicts the CNN/USAToday/Gallup poll.    Washington Post/ABC  urlLink poll  shows a 4 point bounce for Kerry (and a 4 point  drop  for Bush) after the Democratic Convention. Take a look at question 3.   Before the convention the  Bush/Kerry numbers, among registered voters were 48/46 (a two point with Bush ahead) .  After the convention, they're at 44/50 (a six point difference with  Kerry  ahead).  Bush drops 4 points and Kerry gains four points and yet the Tribune Review tries to lead us to believe that there's "no bounce."   -----  We don't know exactly what this means, but it seems that California's  urlLink Peace and Freedom Party  has decided not to endorse Ralph Nader in favor of Leonard Peltier.  For those who don't know, Peltier is in prison (Nader isn't).  To be fair and balanced, CNN says the group respects Nader and feels he should be on the Ballot in many states.  We don't know what Ralph must make of this either.  Perhaps his massive ego is blocking him from seeing this fact:  A party that "calls for an immediate end to the military occupation of Iraq, the withdrawal and return of all U.S. troops, and the immediate release of all prisoners of war and detained civilians" has decided that, while he's is a candidate worth supporting, they're just not endorsing him.  They're going with the guy in prison.    ----  So the current occupant is calling for the creation of an "Intelligence Czar."  In reponse to a recommendation of the 9/11 Commission.  Didn't he originally resist the creation of that commission?  Wouldn't his acceptance of a recommendation of one (or any) of its recommendations be considered A FLIP-FLOP?    Fred would certainly think so if Senator Kerry did it.

						    We got to hear a few (very few) minutes of Fred on  urlLink KDKA  radio today. Just in time to catch the tail end of his take on the Teresa Heinz Kerry/Colin McNickle teapot-tempest. All we heard was Fred Honsberger calling Teresa Heinz Kerry "a stupid woman" or "that stupid woman." Maybe "one stupid woman." We can't remember. We weren't taking notes, we were walking across the 9th street Bridge on the way home from work.  But that is neither here nor there. The important thing is that the reliably inaccurate Fred used the adjective "stupid" to describe Senator Kerry's wife. At least he got the gender right. We'll give him that. Isn't she fluent in 5 languages? Just asking.  A popular conservative  urlLink spin  (this is from the Right-wing "Media Research Center") to this story goes something like this:  Cameras were rolling last night when Teresa Heinz Kerry falsely claimed she’d never called Republicans “un-American,” telling the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review’s Colin McNickle to “shove it” when he persisted in asking her to elaborate.   And here's McNickle's urlLink  take  on this:     A week ago tonight, I asked Teresa Heinz Kerry a simple question here: "What did you mean?" And a wicked firestorm was sparked. Incredibly, most of it was directed against me. Moments earlier, Mrs. Heinz Kerry had talked of "un-Pennsylvanian and sometimes un-American traits" that supposedly have crept into our political discourse. Her talk before the Pennsylvania delegation was, in part, a plea for a return to civility.   And here is Heinz Kerry describing it herself on CNN. She was interviewed by the CNN's Dorian Gray, Mr. Bill Hemmer:        HEMMER: OK, back up a little bit then. We need to turn back some of the creeping un-Pennsylvanian...    HEINZ KERRY: Traits.   HEMMER: ... and sometimes un-American traits that are creeping in to some of our politics.    HEINZ KERRY: Correct, and that's...    HEMMER: That the way you remember it?    HEINZ KERRY: ... absolutely correct. I would say that again.    HEMMER: And what did the reporter say to you then?    HEINZ KERRY: Un-American activities, which has a very different connotation. It's a political connotation of McCarthy implications, which I would not use unless it was very specific. And I would use it if it was correct, but that's not what I was talking about.     So already we know that Brent Bozell's Media Research Center is lying when it says she "falsely" claimed she never called Republicans "un-American." And we also know that whenever we read anyone trying to say that Heinz Kerry denied using the word "Un-American" we can be sure that person is lying. She did not deny using the term "Un-American", she denied using the term "Un-American activities" (which she didn't).  We'd like you to notice McNickle's own description of the incident. We'll try to parse it out for you. He begins with a clear ommission. The question itself has been shortened. "What did you mean?" was somehow shortened from "What did you mean by 'Un-American Activity'?" (which, according to  urlLink WTAE , is what he actually asked). Indeed, McNickle never uses the phrase "Un-American activities" anywhere in his column. In a sense, he's misquoting himself to spin the story.   Then he uses the word "supposedly" to call into question Kerry's assertion that there's a lack of civility in today's political discourse.  If McNickle is only willing to assert only that there's "supposedly" a lack of civility in political discourse, then presumably he has to be OK with the following description of contemporary journalism:    We live in an age of weasely corporate journalism in which boilerplate liberalism is passed off as objective coverage and reasoned discourse.   He should be ok with it. He wrote it.
