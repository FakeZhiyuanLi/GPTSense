        ok, i found this site lastnight while registering at jibjab.com.&nbsp; this site is pretty interesting.&nbsp; i also own an online diary at my uncle's website called  urlLink www.inthewire.com .&nbsp; that, too, is pretty interesting.&nbsp; the community is growing bigger and bigger over there.&nbsp; most people love the site.&nbsp; it's easy to use and the people there are interesting.&nbsp; that seems to be my favorite word today, "interesting".&nbsp; anyway, there isn't much to say.&nbsp; i'm 14.&nbsp; semi-average.&nbsp; i like video games.&nbsp; partially because i'm growing up with 3 younger brothers.&nbsp; i love photography.&nbsp; i'm thinking about becoming one when i'm older.&nbsp; i'm christian.&nbsp; i got back from a mission trip, to peru, on july 14th.&nbsp; i was there for 8 days.&nbsp; i absolutely love the place and can't wait to go back next year.&nbsp; ummm....i love guitar and am learning to play it.&nbsp; i love rock music.&nbsp; nothing hard core though.&nbsp; when they yell through the entire song, that just is stupid to me.&nbsp; i can handle some yelling.&nbsp; some of my favorite artists are: chevelle, the all american rejects, sugarcult, avril lavigne, linkin park, switchfoot and so on....you get the idea, i'm sure.&nbsp; i think that's all i have to say for right now.&nbsp; leave any comments.        &nbsp;    *ana

        well, summer is coming to an end on aug. 9th.     seems like yesterday we had gotten out. i'll be starting highschool and the more i think about it the more nervous i become. heck, i'm nervous about registering today there. i'll be taking honors english, honors algebra, honors world history, biology and spanish I. i was supposed to read three books this summer for honors history. regular english students had to read one. well, i'm not much of a reader. i haven't read one book. i'm only 60 pgs. into the one i'm trying to get finished before schools starts. all students were given a list of books to choose from. i think there were 10 or 11 books to choose from. i, myself, chose to read 'the count of monte cristo', 'the prince and the pauper', and 'a tree grows in brooklyn' (which i am trying to finish before monday. yeah, good luck withat that.). i'm trying. kind of. could be trying harder. this kind of thing has happened to me before, but it seems i still love to procrastinate and stress myself out. i know i'm going to learn my lesson this time. and this time, i'm sure i'll take it seriously because it's highschool. my plate is full of hard subjects. i'm going to be studying like crazy probably. i've never really had to study before. i did my work and i guess that was enough for me. i still amde some bad grades, but seeing from the classes i'm going to take, i guess they think i can handle it. i'm sure i can. i just have to be diligent. i have to be. my goal is to stay in NHS (National Honor Society. i was in NJHS in middle school) and get a scholarship to a university.           my uncle's website is down. i could care less. i like the site. it's easy to use, it's just that my mom's parents (my grandparents), her 3 brothers (my uncles) and my uncle's wives (my aunts) are on there. my parents and my grandparents had a major conflict on mother's day and i'd rather keep that info. private for now. i don't want to talk to them. i don't want to see them. for right now, i don't even want a relationship with them. when they apologize and ask for my forgiveness, we'll see. but, i'm afraid that'll never happen. honestly don't think it will. i'm not getting into that. i'm tempted, but that's a whole 'nother entry for some other day. anyway, i wanted to post my pictures of peru there. my couple friends from that site wanted to see them, and so did my grandma. i don't mind if she does. it makes it easier on my mom because of her trying to get in touch with my mom and asking her when she can see them. but, i'll most likely end up posting them on here. maybe on there some day.          but speaking of peru, that whole trip was an experience of a lifetime. we stayed in lima for a while and in cuscos (we also visited macchu picchu for a day). in lima, the sky is always grey. it's very polluted and dirty. the homeless children wander the streets, along with the starving dogs, asking anyone and everyone for money. the driving there is crazy. nobody (some do, but not a lot) owns a car. it's very inexpensive to pay for a taxi. the street signs and stop lights are more of a suggestion. nobody cares about them. people walk out into the streets coming up to cars trying to sell things to citizens and visitors. the people drive so insanly there. despite this, there's something beautiful about the city. in cuscos, the sky always seemed to be clear and blue with few clouds in the sky. kids still wander the streets and so do the dogs. the driving is just as bad. the city seemed more authentic though. everyone on the misson trip team loved it and seemed to enjoy it more than lima.           it was so awesome to see another way of living besides the one most of us americans live day-to-day. the people there are so happy and greet you with open arms. they were incredibly friendly. it was very weird. i hadn't even met these people before, but they seemed to trust you from the beginning. when it came time to leave, they gave all 14 of us a hug goodbye and a light kiss on the cheek....at least the girls there did. the boys gave a hug and usually didn't kiss you. one boy kissed me on the cheek and some of my friends got the same treatment. these boys were young though. nothing but innocence. they were so happy despite what they had there. we americans seem to think that if a little something in our life goes wrong, our whole life sucks and is over. nothing ever again will be the same. some of us even take the easy and selfish way out - suicide - but not these people. i heard some terrible, terrible stories of some of the kids at the second orphanage we went to. i was almost in tears. it's amazing the things we can all take for granted. myself included.           i leave for the beach next friday for a week. yes, i will miss some of the first week of school and 4 days of the second week. not a good way to start off, but i'm dying to go. i haven't been in almost 5 yrs. (unless you count that 15 minutes we spent at the pacific ocean in peru). i'm going my best friend, whitney (you'll hear more of her), and her family, a family they are great friends with and the family friends' husband's mother. did you follow that? *hehe* i plan on bringing a book to read during the spare time. i'll have a lot probably. we'll be laying on the beach and watching the kids from time-to-time.        sorry for bad spelling, if any. spellcheck would be too long because i didn't capitalize anything.   anyway, i think that's all for now. until next time...        *ana
