      After “Out in the World”, the CTA combed the city limits for permanent performing space, discovering the cockroach-ridden Masonic Temple above a downtown hardware store.  Artistic frontiers are rarely hospitable, and the Cosmic rebels didn’t know how many psychic-wars lie in store for them in their first year maiden voyage.

      I know, I know... ...I have nothing personal to say right now. I just got off work, I'm tired.  So, this email I got this week will have to suffice, because its more important than anything I can think of right now.  Pay attention... ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ An Email from MoveOn.org  ...Salon.com has just broken a major story detailing how the Pentagon created a special office to manipulate intelligence data on Iraq and WMDs.  It's written by Karen Kwiatkowski, a military offer who was part of this unit, telling us the inside story in her own words.  Click here to read the full story:  http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2004/03/10/osp_moveon/    The Salon story makes it even clearer than before that the Bush administration deliberately misled us in the run-up to the war in Iraq a year ago.  The problem was not bad intelligence -- it was deliberate distortion of the facts.    It's Congress' duty to hold President Bush accountable for misleading us.  Please call your Senators and Representative now:    Senator Ron Wyden   Washington, DC: 202-224-5244    Senator Gordon H. Smith   Washington, DC: 202-224-3753    Congressman David Wu   Washington, DC: 202-225-0855  Make sure they know you're a constituent, then urge them to:    "Censure President Bush -- formally reprimand him for misleading us    about Iraq's WMDs."     Give them some reasons why Censure is necessary.  Some good ones include:  - 553 American soldiers have given their lives in Iraq; - Tens of thousands of our troops remain in harm's way there; - A year later, we seem to have no exit strategy; - Thousands of Iraqi civilians have been killed; - The President took us to war based on assertions he knew were untrue -- for more info, see http://www.moveon.org/censure/ad-doc.html ; - Congress has a constitutional duty to act as a check on the president.  Please let us know you're calling, at:  http://www.moveon.org/callmadeall3.html?id=2459-3221821-OCAptdAOTA0o9VuPk07nqQ  The new Salon story is important, not only because of its revelations about how the Pentagon cooked the books on WMDs, but also because it's the first piece by Salon's new Washington, D.C. bureau.  Strong, independent news sources are more important now than ever, as  traditional media become increasingly concentrated under the control of just a few corporations, and with major outlets like CBS nakedly kowtowing to partisan interests like the Bush re-election campaign.  In this context, Salon's new Washington, D.C. bureau is a major step forward for all of us.   We hope you'll take a few minutes to read their important article today.  You can access it at:  http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2004/03/10/osp_moveon/    Thank you.

      “We want to create an audience-base that’s never exhisted before in Chico,” stated Artistic Director Denver Latimer in a video-taped documentary about the Cosmic ravel Agency (CTA) before launching their “space monkey”, the puppet-theater tour of the Chico café circuit with a show about the History of Jazz..  The economy was stagnant.  Graduates were stranded and (?) after a life-time of instititutionalized learning.  The name CTA came from jazz-musician Sun-Ra.  Inspired by the origins of jazz within the context of economic hardship, Denver hoped the theater would develop new forms and dialectics out of necessity, inviting the culturally-starving population to visit the worlds we would make out of card-board, duct-tape, and imagination, promising to deliver if hey only booked a flight.

      Once upon a time, in a far-away land which had never been bombed by forgeiners, there was a small cow-town with a state university in the Far West whose strangest law is that you can be fined up to $500 for detonating a nuclear-device within the city-limits.  What kind of things do THESE people do for entertainment?, one might ask themselves.  Aside from the usual Chico party thing? In the early 1990’s, a band of rebel English Literature graduates formed a theater company called “The Cosmic Travel Agency”, a distillation of storytellers of a cult-garage theater troupe, “The Butcher Shop”.  Due to space limitations, their first full-length production “Out in the World”, a jazz-spectacle with mythic dimentions, was performed at the Phoenix jazz-café.  I was invited to video-tape the live event by co-founder Tom Lamere, a fellow actor.  (VID#1 “Out in the World”: ((handheld 8mm)) A chorus of masked animal-women skipping circles around the Everyman-white-face character named Jack, who has just left home to go ‘out in the world’.  The women bark melodiously to the live band, and Jack dances, gazing into the future and smiling…)

      So its not REALLY hooky, but I've been accumulating sub-days and decided to cash one in today, Wednesday the 10th in Japan (the post-time gives the U.S. date, so its technically not correct), so I can just goof-off for a couple of days.  Nothing like 48 hours of daydreaming to get ones creative energy back.  I have it good for a forgeiner, and my timing was good, too.  The illustration part is the icing on the cake.  I'd probably complain more if that didn't fall in my lap.  I know I am getting ripped off, though.  I'm not blind to that fact. Getting hungry.  Might go get some Mexican food at Speak Easy, the "American Style" diner just across the street from the post office in my little prefecture.  They fly an Amercian flag outside of it, so you know its GOT to be "American style".  It was faded and a little rotten until they replaced it recently with a bright new one.  Think I'll try to catch CNN before the general news updates are over.  Today, I'm staying in the house and working on the web.  I have all day tomorrow to explore Kyoto some more.

      What do you stand to gain  insulting the last noble occupation in the 21st century?  Rod Paige must not be a R-E-A-D-E-R...  $$$  Rod Paige, the Secretary of Education, called America's largest teachers' union a "terrorist organization." Sign the petition calling on President Bush to fire Rod Paige.       Dear MoveOn member,  Last month, President Bush's Secretary of Education, Rod Paige, called America's largest teachers' union a "terrorist organization." Why? Because the union had the gall to insist that President Bush live up to his own promises to adequately fund education. Please sign our petition demanding that President Bush fire Secretary Paige.      http://www.FirePaige.org/index.asp?ms=1   This is typical behavior for the Bush administration. It says one thing - "no child left behind" and does another - under-funding its promises to our schools by $9.4 billion in its latest budget proposal. And when people dare to disagree with its policies, it questions their patriotism or labels them terrorists.   Secretary Paige uses insult to defend the indefensible. Not only did the president break his promise to fund the reforms, his current budget calls for cuts in support for schools over the next five years. And he still wants to take billions from public schools to pay for private school vouchers. So Paige resorts to slurs: even in his supposed apology, he dismissed teachers' growing concerns as "obstructionist scare tactics."   We teach our kids that name calling is not the right way to win an argument - in fact, it’s usually a sign that you don't have the facts on your side. Making our schools better is a tough job. We need a Secretary of Education who sees teachers and their representatives as partners in this effort rather than as enemies. Join us in calling on President Bush to find a better person for the job.      http://www.FirePaige.org/index.asp?ms=1   We thank the Campaign for America's Future for co-sponsoring this campaign with us. Please sign on today.   Sincerely, --Carrie, Joan, Noah, Peter, and Wes   The MoveOn.org Team   Tuesday, March 9th, 2004

      Senator John Glenn has said, those "who died following that banner, did not give up their lives for a red, white and blue piece of cloth. It would be a hollow victory indeed if we preserved the symbol of our freedoms by chipping away at those fundamental freedoms themselves."   Okay, on to another dangerous topic... teachers.

      Man, oh man.  Did everybody read this one? The only reason I don't fly the flag is because stripes make my house look fat. Read on...its our country for chrissakes!  $$$  From: Matt Howes, National Internet Organizer, ACLU  To: ACLU Action Network Members  Date: March 9, 2004   Despite the uproar around the federal marriage amendment, the Senate is holding a hearing this week on another proposed amendment to the U.S. Constitution –- one that would change the First Amendment for the first time ever.   The proposed amendment would ban the desecration of the American flag, and in doing so desecrate what the flag represents, and what millions of Americans have died to defend.   As Senator John Glenn has said, those "who died following that banner, did not give up their lives for a red, white and blue piece of cloth. It would be a hollow victory indeed if we preserved the symbol of our freedoms by chipping away at those fundamental freedoms themselves."   Take Action!

      Nearly the middle of March.  I'll be leaving this island in just under seven months.  Still living in my freezing-cold gai-jin house.  Quite a few of the residents here have left temporarily, but they all plan on coming back.  Doesn't matter how few people are living here at Jozanso House; someone always manages to sneak into the shower right after I find my robe. Yesterday at work, I was telling the design manager, Yoko, that she can copy and paste the stars I drew for a illustration of the American flag behind a Thanksgiving turkey.  I didn't want to draw fifty stars when we had the computer to do it for us.  "52 stars", Yoko says.  "Eh?" I said.  "Japan, 51.  Iraq, 52", Yoko says with a smirk.  She's practicing Western humor, I guess.

      Read and check out the clip...  ***********************  ...A year ago today, the Bush Administration was making its final push toward war in Iraq.  We know now that much of what we were told about the threat that Iraq posed was untrue.  And rather than own up to their distortion of the facts, Bush administration officials are denying they ever said such things.  But this Sunday, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld got caught blatantly contradicting his past statements, and we have the video clip.  You can check it out at:       http://www.moveon.org/censure/caughtonvideo/       Congress' responsibility is to hold President Bush and his administration accountable for this pattern of deception -- that's why we have the Constitution.  But instead, Congress today will debate a resolution congratulating Bush, for (they claim) making the world safer.  We must demand, at a minimum, that Congress censure the President. It's our Representatives' duty to formally reprimand him for misleading us. And we've got to demand it today, while they're debating their anniversary resolution.  Please call your Representative now, at:    Congressman David Wu     DC Phone: 202-225-0855   Make it clear that you are a constituent, then let the staffers know you expect nothing less than Censure.      Our campaign will be stronger if you let us know you're calling, at:  http://www.moveon.org/callmadeall3.html?id=2467-3221821-weqdhAs8kRW.KEJztjMV3A  Today, we're holding a press conference at the Capitol, unveiling a new TV ad calling for Censure, and a New York Times ad on the same theme.    And we're taking our Censure petition, signed by more than half a million of us, to Congress, hand-delivering it to each Representative's office.  The event is co-sponsored by Win Without War, True Majority, and Working Assets.  Please help reinforce this powerful message with a single phone call now.    Then, why not pass the Rumsfeld clip along to your friends?  Thanks for all you do.

      In the first solar-orbit, I documented the results of CTA’s explorations like a fly-on-the-wall, and I observed that it was diffulcult to convince good actresses that the CTA wasn’t just a bohemian frat-house that produces monthly plays (come to think of it, that is what they looked like).  Only a handful of brave women dared to share our mission and their names were Nora, Lacy, and Melissa.  In the coming orbits, Yana would eventually prove to have the most endurance.  But their were other forces binding the Agency together, and one force was known as “The Rock”.

      	Veterine stage craftsmen scoffed at the venture.  I intercepted a growing cloud of negative transmissions about the CTA in the early solar-orbits of their mission.  “What in the hell are they doing up there?…  What do they know about theater?…   He’s not one of us…  They’re just a bunch of kid playing with their daddy’s money…  No theater in this town has lasted more than three years…  I can’t wait to see them fall on their  face…”.  Some of the nay-sayers in this chorus eventually lent their skills to the mission, but most didn’t bother until it was clear that the Agency was tenacious and resilient and wasn’t going to give up without a battle..

      George Carlin Responds to Indecency Uproar     Fri Mar 12, 9:10 PM ET    By ANTHONY BREZNICAN, AP Entertainment Writer   LOS ANGELES - George Carlin (news) famously dissected "The Seven Words You Can't Say on Television" as a way to explore what everyone was so uptight about.        Thirty-two years later the same debate is still raging, now fueled by Janet Jackson (news)'s Super Bowl flash, the suspension of Howard Stern's raunchy radio show from six stations and new House legislation that would raise a performer's indecency fine from $11,000 to $500,000.    So what does the 66-year-old Carlin think of the current handwringing over what is indecent, profane, obscene, immoral, lewd or insulting?    "More of the same, more of the same. What are we, surprised?" Carlin told The Associated Press on Friday    He blamed it on religious moralism, media commercialism and election-year politics.    "The whole problem with this idea of obscenity and indecency, and all of these things — bad language and whatever — it's all caused by one basic thing, and that is: religious superstition. ... There's an idea that the human body is somehow evil and bad and there are parts of it that are especially evil and bad, and we should be ashamed. Fear, guilt and shame are built into the attitude toward sex and the body. ... It's reflected in these prohibitions and these taboos that we have."    Mix that with TV or radio, and you've got a problem, he said.    "What I always remind people is, radio and television and — as it happens — newspapers and magazines too, are advertising media. ... When you have commercialism involved you have the kind of fear that advertisers are very afraid of offending some potential customer. They don't want to lose a sale. So they have this need to inspect and clean up and watch the content in order not to hurt their own sales. It's based on success at the cash register.    "And yet, they're very inconsistent_ on that Super Bowl broadcast of Janet Jackson's there was also a commercial about a 4-hour erection. A lot of people were saying about Janet Jackson, 'How do I explain to my kids? We're a little family, we watched it together ...' And, well, what did you say about the other thing? These are convenient targets."    He also thinks President Bush (news - web sites) is trying to placate right-wing voters.    The U.S. Air Force veteran compared the recent tension with memories of his military experience.    "These bursts of interest and decency are just like when you're in the Air Force, Army and Marines, whatever — the discipline in your unit may get a little lax, people live with it, it's fine for months at a time then some colonel notices it and suddenly they crack down ... enforcing all the minor rules and regulations. Then what happens after these bursts of bothering people, that wears off and we get back to normal, relaxed discipline, but things still get done.    "Society can be counted on to let this fade."   ___   On the Net:   http://www.georgecarlin.com

      The Supreme Court heard oral arguments this week in three important cases addressing our constitutional rights to have a trial by jury, to remain anonymous and to provide religious instruction to our children without government interference.   On Monday, the Supreme Court heard arguments in a critical case that will determine whether the police can arrest someone merely because the person refuses to identify himself.  In a friend-of-the-court brief filed in Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial Circuit of Nevada, the American Civil Liberties Union urged the Justices to rule that the refusal to identify oneself to the police should not, by itself, establish probable cause for arrest.   Learn more about this lawsuit.  On Tuesday, the Court heard arguments in a case that raises important questions about the centuries-old right to a trial by jury.   Blakely v. Washington, is the latest in a series of recent cases involving state laws that permit enhanced criminal sentences based on factual determinations made by a judge rather than a jury.   "The right to a trial by jury and to sentencing based on proof beyond a reasonable doubt is fundamental to the American justice system," said Steven R. Shapiro, Legal Director of the ACLU.   Read more about ACLU's position on this case.  Finally, on Wednesday, the ACLU urged the Supreme Court to uphold a federal appeals court ruling that public schools are constitutionally barred from linking patriotism and piety by reciting the phrase "under God" as part of the Pledge of Allegiance.   As the ACLU noted in a friend-of-the-court brief, Congress added the phrase "under God" at the height of the anti-communist McCarthy Era. In signing the bill, then-President Eisenhower said that the phrase "under God" was added so that schoolchildren would "daily proclaim…the dedication of our nation and our people to the Almighty."   The case, Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow, was originally brought by a California man, Michael Newdow, against his daughter's public school district. Newdow argued that the district's Pledge of Allegiance policy directly interfered with his parental right to influence his daughter's religious development and violated the Constitution's prohibition against government entanglement with religion.   Read more information about the case.  In a move indicative of ongoing nationwide disquiet over the state of civil liberties since 9/11, Maine this week became the fourth state to pass a resolution asking Congress to revisit the Patriot Act and other civil liberties infringements. This vote is further proof that Americans of all political stripes want to stop terrorism, but maximize civil liberties.   The Maine resolution follows statewide measures in Vermont, Alaska and Hawaii. Statehouses in New Mexico and several other states have considered similar pieces of legislation. Most urge the U.S. Congress to revisit the USA Patriot Act, passed in haste a mere eight weeks after the attacks, and try to prevent local authorities from engaging in racial profiling and other civil liberties abuses.   Maine, like Alaska, has a strong conservative base, reflected in its two Republican Senators, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins.   The Maine resolution puts the tally of communities that have passed such resolutions at 275, encompassing almost 50 million Americans in 38 states. The list is diverse, encompassing large urban centers like New York and Los Angeles, and small towns like Castle Valley, Utah. The political makeup of the movement is also quite mixed, with many conservative-led resolutions reflecting the broad right-wing libertarian discontent with the Bush administration's civil liberties policies.   You can add your voice to this chorus for liberty by sending free faxes to your Members of Congress urging them to fix the PATRIOT Act.

      Evicting Einstein  A physics experiment on the drawing board for the International Space Station could help find the grand unifying "Theory of Everything."  March 26, 2004:  Sooner or later, the reign of Einstein, like the reign of Newton before him, will come to an end. An upheaval in the world of physics that will overthrow our notions of basic reality is inevitable, most scientists believe, and currently a horse race is underway between a handful of theories competing to be the successor to the throne.  In the running are such mind-bending ideas as an 11-dimensional universe, universal "constants" (such as the strength of gravity) that vary over space and time and only remain truly fixed in an unseen 5th dimension, infinitesimal vibrating strings as the fundamental constituents of reality, and a fabric of space and time that's not smooth and continuous, as Einstein believed, but divided into discrete, indivisible chunks of vanishingly small size. Experiment will ultimately determine which triumphs.  Right: According to Einstein's theory of general relativity, the sun's gravity causes starlight to bend, shifting the apparent position of stars in the sky.   A new concept for an experiment to test the predictions of Einstein's relativity more precisely than ever before is being developed by scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). Their mission, which effectively uses our solar system as a giant laboratory, would help narrow the field of vying theories and bring us one step closer to the next revolution in physics.  A House Divided  It may not weigh heavily on most people's minds, but a great schism has long plagued our fundamental understanding of the universe. Two ways of explaining the nature and behavior of space, time, matter, and energy currently exist: Einstein's relativity and the "standard model" of quantum mechanics. Both are extremely successful. The Global Positioning System (GPS), for instance, wouldn't be possible without the theory of relativity. Computers, telecommunications, and the Internet, meanwhile, are spin-offs of quantum mechanics.   But the two theories are like different languages, and no one is yet sure how to translate between them. Relativity explains gravity and motion by uniting space and time into a 4-dimensional, dynamic, elastic fabric of reality called space-time, which is bent and warped by the energy it contains. (Mass is one form of energy, so it creates gravity by warping space-time.) Quantum mechanics, on the other hand, assumes that space and time form a flat, immutable "stage" on which the drama of several families of particles unfolds. These particles can move both forward and backward in time (something relativity doesn't allow), and the interactions between these particles explain the basic forces of nature -- with the glaring exception of gravity.   Left: Astronomers use the light-bending properties of gravity to view very distant galaxies--such as the arc shapes in this image--in a technique called "gravitational lensing." [More]  The stalemate between these two theories has gone on for decades. Most scientists assume that somehow, eventually, a unifying theory will be developed that subsumes the two, showing how the truths they each contain can fit neatly within a single, all-encompassing framework of reality. Such a "Theory of Everything" would profoundly affect our knowledge of the birth, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe.  Slava Turyshev, a scientist at JPL, and his colleagues have thought of a way to use the International Space Station (ISS) and two mini-satellites orbiting on the far side of the sun to test the theory of relativity with unprecedented accuracy. Their concept, developed in part through funding from NASA's Office of Biological and Physical Research, would be so sensitive that it could reveal flaws in Einstein's theory, thus providing the first hard data needed to distinguish which of the competing Theories of Everything agree with reality and which are merely fancy chalk-work.  The experiment, called Laser Astrometric Test Of Relativity (LATOR), would look at how the sun's gravity deflects beams of laser light emitted by the two mini-satellites. Gravity bends the path of light because it warps the space through which the light is passing. The standard analogy for this warping of space-time by gravity is to imagine space as a flat sheet of rubber that stretches under the weight of objects like the sun. The depression in the sheet would cause an object (even a no-mass particle of light) passing nearby the sun to turn slightly as it went by.  In fact, it was by measuring the bending of starlight by the sun during a solar eclipse in 1919 that Sir Arthur Eddington first tested Einstein's theory of general relativity. In cosmic terms, the sun's gravity is fairly weak; the path of a beam of light skimming the edge of the sun would only be bent by about 1.75 arcseconds (an arcsecond is 1/3600 of a degree). Within the limits of accuracy of his measuring equipment, Eddington showed that starlight did indeed bend by this amount -- and in doing so effectively impeached Newton.   LATOR would measure this deflection with a billion (109) times the precision of Eddington's experiment and 30,000 times the precision of the current record-holder: a serendipitous measurement using signals from the Cassini spacecraft on its way to explore Saturn.  Above: The curvature of space due to the sun's mass caused signals from the Cassini probe to curve on their way to Earth. [More]  "I think [LATOR] would be quite an important advance for fundamental physics," says Clifford Will, a professor of physics at Washington University who has made major contributions to post-Newtonian physics and is not directly involved with LATOR. "We should continue to try to press for more accuracy in testing general relativity, simply because any kind of deviation would mean that there's new physics that we were not aware of before."  Solar laboratory  The experiment would work like this: Two small satellites, each about one meter wide, would be launched into an orbit circling the sun at roughly the same distance as Earth. This pair of mini-satellites would orbit more slowly than Earth does, so about 17 months after launch, the mini-satellites and Earth would be on opposite sides of the sun. Even though the two satellites would be about 5 million km apart, the angle between them as viewed from Earth would be tiny, only about 1 degree. Together, the two satellites and Earth would form a skinny triangle, with laser beams along its sides, and one of those beams passing close to the sun.  Above: A schematic diagram of the proposed LATOR mission.  Turyshev plans to measure the angle between the two satellites using an interferometer mounted on the ISS. An interferometer is a device that catches and combines beams of light. By measuring how waves of light from the two mini-satellites "interfere" with each other, the interferometer can measure the angle between the satellites with extraordinary precision: about 10 billionths of an arcsecond, or 0.01 µas (micro-arcseconds). When the precision of the other parts of the LATOR design are considered, this gives an overall accuracy for measuring how much gravity bends the laser beam of about 0.02 µas for a single measurement.   "Using the ISS gives us a few advantages," Turyshev explains. "For one, it's above the distortions of Earth's atmosphere, and it's also large enough to let us place the two lenses of the interferometer far apart (one lens on each end of the solar panel truss), which improves the resolution and accuracy of the results."   Left: The interferometer will be mounted to the solar-panel truss of the ISS, which automatically rotates to continuously face the sun. Image courtesy Slava Turyshev.  The 0.02 µas accuracy of LATOR is good enough to reveal deviations from Einstein's relativity predicted by the aspiring Theories of Everything, which range from roughly 0.5 to 35 µas. Agreement with LATOR's measurements would be a major boost for any of these theories. But if no deviation from Einstein is found even by LATOR, most of the current contenders--along with their 11 dimensions, pixellated space, and inconstant constants--will suffer a fatal blow and "pass on" to that great dusty library stack in the sky.  Because the mission requires only existing technologies, Turyshev says LATOR could be ready to fly as soon as 2009 or 2010. So it may not be too long before the stalemate in physics is broken and a new theory of gravity, space, and time takes the throne.  SEND THIS STORY TO A FRIEND   Credits & Contacts Author: Patrick L.

      As you may have heard, Richard Clarke, a former counter-terrorism advisor to Bush, and a registered Republican who has worked in every administration since Reagan, has exposed Bush's mishandling of 9/11 and the war on Iraq.1 In his book "Against All Enemies," Clarke does an amazing job of presenting the facts and connecting the dots. Instead of refuting Clarke's claims, the Bush Administration has launched a campaign of character assassination, hoping that the story will just go away.2  We're committed to stopping that from happening by making sure that the American public hears Clarke's extraordinary comments. Please help launch a hard-hitting campaign to get Clarke's message out there. You can see a rough story board of our first ad and donate to get it on the air at: https://www.moveonpac.org/clarkead.html?id=2524-3221821-08iD.8QBRJ72Oi.ceWANmg   When the World Trade Center was hit on the morning of 9/11, National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice dubbed Richard Clarke, the administration's top counter-terrorism official, "crisis manager."3 As the White House, which was thought to be the next target, was evacuated, Clarke heroically stayed on, coordinating the government's response from the Situation Room in the West Wing.4   Clarke is viewed by colleagues as a hawk, a "true believer" who doesn't play partisan politics.5 So the shocking facts he revealed about the Bush administration's approach to terrorism before 9/11 and its response after must be taken seriously. On Sunday, Clarke told reporters that the President and Defense Secretary downgraded counter-terrorism and ignored repeated warnings about an al Qaeda attack prior to 9/11. And, perhaps even more explosive, Clarke revealed that President Bush and senior administration officials wanted to bomb Iraq after 9/11 even though they knew that it had no connection to al Qaeda, and that al Qaeda was responsible for the attacks.6   Already, the White House spin machine is in overdrive. Since they can't rebut Clarke's facts -- which independent witnesses have confirmed7 -- they're trying to paint him as an angry partisan, even though he's a Republican. But Clarke's words remain a searing indictment of the Bush Administration's campaign against terrorism. Together, if we act today, we can beat back the spin by widely airing a TV ad which gets these uniquely credible comments directly to TV viewers.   You can view a story board of the ad and help us get it on the air now at: https://www.moveonpac.org/clarkead.html?id=2524-3221821-08iD.8QBRJ72Oi.ceWANmg   In his own words, here are some of Clarke's revelations:    Clarke repeatedly warned the Bush Administration about attacks from al Qaeda, starting in the first days of Bush's term. "But on January 24th, 2001, I wrote a memo to Condoleezza Rice asking for, urgently -- underlined urgently -- a Cabinet-level meeting to deal with the impending al Qaeda attack. And that urgent memo-- wasn't acted on."8 According to another Bush administration security official, Clarke "was the guy pushing hardest, saying again and again that something big was going to happen, including possibly here in the U.S." The official added that Clarke was likely sidelined because he had served in the previous (Clinton) administration.9   In face-to-face meetings, CIA Director George Tenet warned President Bush repeatedly in the months before 9/11 that an attack was coming. According to Clarke, Tenet told the President that "A major al-Qaeda attack is going to happen against the United States somewhere in the world in the weeks and months ahead."10   On September 12, 2001, Donald Rumsfeld pushed to bomb Iraq even though they knew that al Qaeda was in Afghanistan. "Rumsfeld was saying that we needed to bomb Iraq," Clarke said. "And we all said ... no, no. Al-Qaeda is in Afghanistan. We need to bomb Afghanistan. And Rumsfeld said there aren't any good targets in Afghanistan. And there are lots of good targets in Iraq. I said, 'Well, there are lots of good targets in lots of places, but Iraq had nothing to do with it.'"11   Also on September 12, 2001, President Bush personally pushed Clarke to find evidence that Iraq was behind the attacks. From the New York Times: "'I want you, as soon as you can, to go back over everything, everything,' Mr. Clarke writes that Mr. Bush told him. 'See if Saddam did this. See if he's linked in any way.' When Mr. Clarke protested that the culprit was Al Qaeda, not Iraq, Mr. Bush testily ordered him, he writes, to 'look into Iraq, Saddam,' and then left the room."12   The Bush Administration knew from the beginning that there was no connection between Iraq and 9/11, but created the misperception in order to push their policy goals. "[Rumsfeld, Cheney and Bush] did know better. They did know better. They did know better. We told them, the CIA told them, the FBI told them. They did know better. And the tragedy here is that Americans went to their death in Iraq thinking that they were avenging September 11th, when Iraq had nothing to do with September 11th. I think for a commander-in-chief and a vice president to allow that to happen is unconscionable."13   The war on Iraq has increased the danger of terrorism. In his book, he writes that shifting from al Qaeda to Iraq "launched an unnecessary and costly war in Iraq that strengthened the fundamentalist, radical Islamic terrorist movement worldwide."14   It's been well reported that President Bush intends to run on his record as a wartime President. Clarke's revelations show how deeply flawed that record is. But if we don't act fast, the public may not have a chance to evaluate the facts for themselves -- the story could go away quickly. With an ad, we can take Clarke's comments directly to the public. Can you help?

Richard Clarke had an intimate view -- perhaps the best view -- of how the Bush Administration responded to terrorism. So we should all listen carefully when he says:   "Frankly, I find it outrageous that the president is running for re-election on the grounds that he's done such great things about terrorism. He ignored it. He ignored terrorism for months, when maybe we could have done something to stop 9/11. Maybe. We'll never know. . . I think the way he has responded to al-Qaeda, both before 9/11 by doing nothing, and by what he's done after 9/11 has made us less safe, absolutely. I think he's done a terrible job on the war against terrorism."15  Together, we can make sure every American knows what President Bush's true record on terrorism really is.

The White House acknowledges this, but says "principals did not need to have a formal meeting to discuss the threat."

      As America's jobless economic "recovery" continues, President Bush is pulling the rug out from under working Americans.  He's trying to make it easier for employers to require longer hours without paying overtime, by making 8 million workers ineligible for overtime pay.  Your Senator, Gordon H. Smith, can stop him, but he needs to hear from you right away.  Senator Tom Harkin is offering an amendment that would protect overtime.  Sen. Smith is a swing vote on the Harkin amendment, and the Senate is expected to vote TODAY, March 24th.   Please call now:       Senator Gordon H. Smith     Phone: 202-224-3753  Make sure the staffers know you're a constituent, then urge Sen. Smith to:     "Demand a vote on the Harkin amendment -- Stop Bush's overtime cuts."    Please let us know you're calling, at:  http://www.moveon.org/callmade5.html?id=2486-3221821-dWAamttLrRswTU660ZmzTg       If President Bush gets his way, it will have at least three terrible consequences:  1. Eight million hard-working families could have a big bite taken out of their livelihoods.  People struggling to get by will have an even tougher time making ends meet than they do now.   2. Many people will be compelled by their employers to work inhuman hours.  That's because managers will have every incentive to stretch the hours of each employee whose benefits and other overhead costs they're already paying.  3. The same incentives will make it less likely that existing employers will create new jobs.  Fewer new jobs -- just what we need now.  Yet President Bush has already stopped the first attempt to protect our right to overtime pay.  We need to prevent him from doing it again by supporting Senator Tom Harkin's (D-IA) amendment to the JOBS bill which would prevent the Bush administration from stripping overtime eligibility for so many American workers.  The Harkin amendment will need every vote.  Please call Senator Smith right away.     One final note -- if you are NOT a labor union member, please say so when you call.  It's important that we demonstrate broad support for overtime and jobs.  Thank you.

      Labs say they have nearly all the tools to make artificial life  By Ronald Kotulak  Tribune science reporter  Posted March 28 2004   More than 3.5 billion years after nature transformed non-living matter into living things, populating Earth with a cornucopia of animals and plants, scientists say they are finally ready to try their hand at creating life.  If they succeed, humanity will enter a new age of "living technology," where harnessing the power of life to spontaneously adapt to complex situations could solve problems that now defy modern engineering.  Scientists eagerly talk of a new world of ultra-small living machines, where marvelously made-to-order cells heal the body, clean up pollutants, transform electronics and communication, and much more.  The researchers say it may be possible to make sweaters that mend themselves. Or computers that fix their own glitches.  Though some experts see this new technology as providing unlimited benefits, others worry about the moral appropriateness of human-made life and the introduction of new species with the potential to evolve into creatures that could run amok.  "It's certainly true that we are tinkering with something very powerful here," said artificial-life researcher Steen Rasmussen of Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.  "But there's no difference between what we do here and what humans have always done when we invented fire, transistors and ways to split the atom," he said. "The more powerful technology you unleash, the more careful you have to be."  Such concern is escalating as more than 100 laboratories study processes involved in the creation of life, and scientists say for the first time that they have just about all the pieces they need to begin making inanimate chemicals come alive.  Unlike any other technology invented by humans, creating artificial life will be as jarring to our concepts of ourselves as discovering living creatures on other planets in the universe would be. It also would bring into sharper focus the age-old questions of "What is life?" and "Where do we come from?"  "The ability to make new forms of life from scratch--molecular living systems from chemicals we get from a chemical supply store--is going to have a profound impact on society, much of it positive, but some of it potentially negative," said Mark Bedau, professor of philosophy and humanities at Reed College in Portland, Ore., and editor-in-chief of the Artificial Life Journal.  "Aside from the vast scientific insights that will come, there will be vast commercial and economic benefits, so much so that it's hard to contemplate in concrete detail what many of them will be," he said.  But the first artificial life also is likely to shock people's religious and cultural belief systems.  "People from many different backgrounds have special views about what life is: how it originates, the special sanctity it has, the special dignity it deserves," Bedau said. "The ability to make new forms of life will perturb all of that. We need to think through the implications and how we are going to react to them."  `Biology revolution'  Still, artificial life now seems so attainable that the number of U.S. labs working in the field jumped from about 10 four decades ago to more than 100 today.  Spearheading the drive is the European Union's Programmable Artificial Cell Evolution project, recently established with a grant of about $9 million. This month PACE is scheduled to open the first institution devoted exclusively to creating artificial life, called the European Center for Living Technology, in Venice, staffed by European and U.S. researchers.  "It's a synthetic biology revolution," said John McCaskill, professor of theoretical biochemistry at Friedrich-Schiller University in Jena, Germany, who is overseeing the European Union's artificial life program.  "We obviously don't want to be too polemic about how rapidly this is going to transform society," he said. "But I think that we are seeing a new feature of science and technology where systems are tonomously adaptive and that this is a significant component of the design process."  Scientists are trying to unravel the grand mystery of how life originated on Earth, and possibly Mars and other places in the universe. How is it that when atoms of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen are organized in the right way, for example, they make a carrot? Arranging far more atoms in a different way produces a human being.  Life is generally not thought of as being mechanical. But a cell basically is a miniature machine in which non-living atoms are constantly being rearranged to make the moving parts that imbue it with life.  The cell, the basic unit of all living things, becomes much more than all of its parts. New properties emerge that give a cell the power to repair itself, reproduce and adapt to changing environments.  A key element of all living systems is the ability to evolve through natural selection. Things that are successful survive, while those that fail to adapt die off. The idea is to incorporate this evolutionary design process into technology that people can use, making things that are complicated and well-adapted without having to figure out in advance all the problems that could arise.  "Our technology right now is facing a complexity crisis. We need to make things that are more complicated if we want to have new kinds of functionality," Bedau said. "We want to have better telephone switching networks, better computers, better spacecraft, but we don't know how to do it."  "If we could make life, we would have a new insight into how to make things more complicated," he said. "We could apply these principles in other areas. Life is very, very complicated, but it also repairs itself, it organizes itself and it adapts spontaneously to changes. It would be nice to have a space shuttle that can do those things or a telephone switching network that can grow and adapt in an organic way."  It is a dream long pursued by scientists who now believe that it may be possible to create the first artificial unit of life in the next 5 to 10 years.  "We've been saying that for the last 50 years," said David W. Deamer, a pioneering professor of biomolecular engineering at the University of California at Santa Cruz. "What makes it different now is that we have a critical mass of people interested in the field and some recent breakthrough discoveries."  Natural safeguards  From Deamer's point of view, the risk that artificially created life could get out of hand is "infinitesimally small."  "There's nothing we could make that could compete with the predators that are out there and have had 3 billion years to evolve," he said. "Bacteria eat anything. They eat jet fuel, oil deposits, chlorinated hydrocarbons, anything. They will eat anything that we put out there to compete with them."  Another safeguard scientists are designing to provide total control over artificial cells is to make their lives dependent on chemicals that do not exist in the environment. Withdrawing the critical chemicals would result in the death of the cells, particularly if they should escape into the environment.  What makes life possible, scientists believe, is the natural tendency of atoms to assemble into molecules, and for molecules to assemble into increasingly complicated structures.  All of the basic elements of life--the amino acids that make proteins and the nucleotides that make DNA and its sidekick RNA--have been produced in the laboratory from chemicals thought to have been present on primitive Earth: hydrogen, methane, ammonia, formaldehyde, cyanide, thiols and hydrosulfide.  Some of these elements are so easy to self-assemble that amino acids are found on meteorites originating at the beginning of the solar system. The Murchison meteorite, for example, contains a wide variety of chemicals, including simple amino acids and fats called lipids. When put in water, lipids spontaneously form bubble-shaped membranes that resemble cells.  Earth coalesced 4.5 billion years ago during the formation of the solar system, and it was too hot for life for several hundred million years. But it didn't take long after the Earth cooled for life to appear. Scientists estimate that fossils of primitive organisms appeared 3.8 billion years ago.  Researchers argue over the definition of life, but they generally agree that it must have three elements: a container, such as the membrane wall of a cell; metabolism, the ability to convert basic nutrients into a cell's working parts; and genes, chemical instructions for building a cell that can be passed on to progeny and change as conditions change.  Each of these critical elements has now been achieved in the laboratory, albeit in rudimentary form, and scientists say they are ready to try to put them all together in one working unit.  "We have quite a bit of knowledge about how these different systems work independently," said microbiologist Martin Hanczyc of Massachusetts General Hospital. "We are at a point where we can start taking these things into the laboratory and do experiments.  "Whether we'll be able to synthesize a living cell in the near future is a big question. But we can start exploring that possibility with what we have available now," said Hanczyc, who along with Harvard's Jack Szostak is able to make artificial cellular membranes grow and divide.  One of the tricks they learned is how to use the remarkable properties of clay, thought to have been abundant on the early Earth. Clay has natural catalytic properties--it speeds up the assembly of lipid membranes a hundredfold, for example, and also hastens the assembly of genetic material called ribonucleic acid.  The two researchers' findings indicate that critical chemicals can spontaneously be brought together to form membranes and genes that are essential for life. They have succeeded in creating cell-like containers that have incorporated laboratory-made RNA.  A genetic riddle  How the first genes got together is a big mystery. Many scientists believe that RNA may have preceded DNA because it can carry genetic instructions and, unlike DNA, make copies of itself. Today DNA preserves the chemical instructions for making and maintaining an organism, while RNA mostly translates those instructions into proteins. DNA and RNA are nearly identical in structure.  David Bartel of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research is trying to make RNA that can fully reproduce itself. So far he has gotten compounds to assemble into small RNA sequences that can make partial copies of themselves.  Bartel calls it test tube evolution. More than 1,000 trillion random RNAs are squirted into a test tube and allowed to assemble into millions of different sequences. A few of those sequences acquired the ability to make copies of RNA sequences, a fledgling step toward artificial life that can reproduce itself and evolve.  Key ingredient  Rasmussen of Los Alamos National Laboratory and Liaohai Chen of Argonne National Laboratory believe they have a good chance of making an artificial cell by using a slightly different version of DNA called polypeptide nucleic acid.  Unlimited variations of PNA can easily be made. They love to stick to the surface of membranes where they can suck up nutrients and hopefully churn out all kinds of novel chemicals, including more cell membrane lipids.  "We have all the pieces, and we have demonstrated that our metabolism can produce the container molecules," Chen said. The protocells that assemble are 10 million times smaller than a bacterium, he said.  The idea is to get all the parts working together so that the artificial cells would not only make daughter cells, but would also be able to manufacture custom-made chemicals now beyond the reach of engineers, such as self-repairing materials.  "Once we have self-reproducing entities that can be programmed, you can do all kinds of useful things," Rasmussen said. "You don't need to build the useful molecules--you can actually have them self-reproduce--you can grow them."  Physicist Norman Packard, who established the first company, ProtoLife, to capitalize on the new field of living technology, thinks of artificial cells as tiny machines that can be programmed to clean out arteries, deliver drugs to specific sites in the body and perform other jobs with great precision.  "The goal of the company is to realize the vision of producing living artificial cells, and also producing other forms of living chemistry, and then programming them to do useful chemical applications," he said. "The range of useful chemical functions we ultimately envision is vast."  Copyright © 2004, The Chicago Tribune

      from the Portland Oregonian...  Even blind old ladies terrify the cops   Sunday, April 25, 2004  She was 71 years old.    She was blind.   She needed her 94-year-old mother to come to her rescue.   And in the middle of the dogfight -- in which Eunice Crowder was pepper-sprayed, Tasered and knocked to the ground by Portland's courageous men in blue -- the poor woman's fake right eye popped out of its socket and was bouncing around in the dirt.   How vicious and ugly can the Portland police get? Ladies and gentlemen, I think we have a winner. This 2003 case is so blatant, the use of force so excessive, the threat of liability so intimidating that the city just approved a $145,000 settlement.   But all those gung-ho fans of the cops can relax. Nothing has changed. Nothing will upset the status quo.   The cops aren't apologizing.   The cops aren't embarrassed.   The cops haven't been disciplined.   And the cops are still insisting, to the bitter end, that they "reasonably believed" this blind ol' bat was a threat to their safety and macho culture.   Eunice Crowder, you see, didn't follow orders. Eunice was uncooperative. Worried a city employee was hauling away a family heirloom, a 90-year-old red toy wagon, she had the nerve to feel her way toward the trailer in which her yard debris was being tossed.   Enter the police. Eunice, who is hard of hearing, ignored the calls of Officers Robert Miller and Eric Zajac to leave the trailer. When she tried, unsuccessfully, to bite the hands that were laid on her, she was knocked to the ground.   When she kicked out at the cops, she was pepper-sprayed in the face with such force that her prosthetic marble eye was dislodged. As she lay on her stomach, she was Tased four times with Zajac's electric stun gun.   And when Nellie Scott, Eunice's 94-year-old mother, tried to rinse out her daughter's eye with water from a two-quart Tupperware bowl, what does Miller do? According to Ernie Warren Jr., Eunice's lawyer, the cop pushed Nellie up against a fence and accused her of planning to use the water as a weapon.   Paranoia runs deep. Into your life it will creep. It starts when you're always afraid . . .   Afraid and belligerent. "Cops have changed," Warren said. "When I grew up, they weren't people who huddled together and their only friends were the cops. You had access to them all the time. You weren't afraid of them."   What did Police Chief Derrick Foxworth have to say about the case? "This did not turn out the way we wanted it to turn out," Foxworth said Friday. "Looking back, and I know the officers feel this as well, they may have done something differently. We would have wanted the minimal amount of force to have been used. But I feel we need to recognize Ms. Crowder has some responsibility. She contributed to the situation."   Granted. But Eunice was 71. She was blind. That probably explains why a judge threw out all charges against her and why the city, in a stone-cold panic, settled ASAP.   "This was like fighting Ray Charles or Stevie Wonder," Warren said. "It wasn't a fair fight."   No, but it was another excuse to haul out the usual code words about the cops' "reasonable" belief that they were justified to use a "reasonable amount of force to defend themselves."   If you have a different definition of "reasonable," you just don't understand the Portland police. You need to remember the words of Robert King, head of the police union, defending Officer Jason Sery in the March shooting of James Jahar Perez:   "What sets us apart from people like most of you is that you'll never face a situation in your job where -- in less than 10 seconds -- the routine can turn to truly life-threatening," King wrote. "When that happens to us, when we have to make that ultimate split-second decision, we don't just ask for your understanding, we ask for your support."   She was 71 years old. She was blind. She was lucky, I guess, that these cops -- set apart from people like most of us -- didn't make the usual split-second decision and draw their guns.

      I have a great friend here in Japan named Chris Gifford.  He is a teacher at the same school I work at (Epion) and he is a great photographer.  Plus, he's freakin' hilarious.  I hope he considers a career in comedy or film.  By shear coinscidence, I was PR Director at Portland State University's Theater Arts department while he was a photographer at the Vanguard (PSU's newspaper).    Anyway, if you need a wedding photographer, email Chris.  He'll do it for free if you pay for the plane ticket!  The attached photo was taken in the Hirakata area in a sound studio with our friend Kirin Lather.  Christopher Gifford: giffordchristopher@hotmail.com

      We checked out Fushimi Inari Shrine today.  Fushimi Inari Shrine is the most famous of several thousands of shrines dedicated to Inari across Japan. Inari is the Shinto god of rice, and foxes are thought to be his messengers. Therefore, many fox statues can be found at Inari shrines.   Fushimi Inari Shrine is also famous for the countless torii gates, offerings by worshippers, that cover the hiking trails of Inarisan, the wooded mountain behind the shrine's main buildings. It takes about two hours to walk along the whole trail.   Kitsune Udon ("Fox Udon"), a noodle soup topped with pieces of aburaage (fried tofu), a favorite food of foxes, is served at small restaurants along the hiking trail.   Here is a photo of Jessie in front of a row of gates.      urlLink Fushimi Inari Shrine

      Last June, I was acting my last show in Portland at Lincoln Hall at PSU's Theatre Arts Department.  It was Trey Parker's "Cannibal: The Musical", directed by Ira Kortum, with permission from Lloyd Kauffman of Troma Films, and by extention, Trey Parker and his gang.  This Fall, Ira Kortum is collaborating with Lloyd Kauffman and bringing "Toxic Avenger: The Musical" to Portland.  I wish I were in it!  Oh well, I hope someone at least video-tapes it more than once. Below is the poster I rendered for the show.  I've never got more laughs just eating a powdered donut.

         1) Help Stop the Flag Desecration Amendment 2) Veterans Defending the Bill of Rights   Once again some Senators are pushing a constitutional amendment to ban desecration of the flag, a proposal that would infringe free speech in the name of protecting the symbol of that very freedom.     Click here to tell your Senators to oppose the flag desecration amendment: http://www.aclu.org/FreeSpeech/FreeSpeech.cfm?ID=9969&c=50  This amendment has rightly been defeated in past sessions of Congress. We need you to speak out now because the vote margin this year is precariously thin.  Congress is on the verge of amending the First Amendment for the first time ever!  Just last week a group of veterans visited Washington to talk with their Members of Congress and spoke out against this dangerous proposed amendment.  The veterans believe that they fought for the freedoms represented by the flag, and urged Congress not to infringe on those freedoms for the sake of the symbol itself.   Take Action!  Urge your Senators to oppose unnecessarily amending the Constitution, a document that has only been amended 17 times in more than 200 years.   Click here for more information and to contact your Senators on this important issue:   http://www.aclu.org/FreeSpeech/FreeSpeech.cfm?ID=9969&c=50  2) Veterans Defending the Bill of Rights   As in previous years, veterans will play a pivotal role in defeating this amendment. During earlier flag amendment battles, thousands of veterans wrote their Members of Congress to dispel the myth that veterans speak with one voice about the proposed amendment.   Gary May, a highly decorated former Marine who lost both of his legs during combat in Vietnam, spoke for many of his fellow veterans in his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee:   "Freedom is what makes the United States of America strong and great -- it is what has kept our democracy strong for more than 200 years," said May, who serves as the Chairman of Veterans Defending the Bill of Rights, a coalition of veterans who oppose the proposed flag amendment. "The pride and honor veterans like me feel is not in the flag itself, but in the principles the flag stands for and in the people who have defended them."    You can find out more about the Veterans Defending the Bill of Rights at http://www.aclu.org/FreeSpeech/FreeSpeech.cfm?ID=12009&c=50  or join them directly at https://forms.aclu.org/feedback/feedback.cfm?r=7&ia=1&ii=0

       urlLink  Faithful America Ad Clip   By refusing to hold senior administration officials accountable, President Bush has failed to fully repudiate the torture that occurred at Abu Ghraib. Every passing day brings new photos and new news of how these despicable techniques were sanctioned at the very top, but Bush won't even condemn Rush Limbaugh for saying that the tactics were "brilliant" and the troops were "just blowing off a little steam."   So it's up to us to try to make things right. Our campaign to hold Donald Rumsfeld accountable will continue. But today, there are two other ways we can help -- joining an apology from Americans of faith to the world, and helping pass a legal re-commitment to the Geneva Conventions and what they stand for.   First, an important new group called FaithfulAmerica1 is putting a very moving TV ad on the air in Arab countries. The ad is a montage of American religious leaders -- Christian, Jewish, and Muslim -- humbly expressing the regrets so many of us feel for what happened.   You can watch the ad, sign onto it, and help get it on the air, at:      http://www.faithfulamerica.org/adclip.htm   At the end of the ad, FaithfulAmerica will state the number of people who've signed on, so the more people who endorse the message, the more effective it will be.   Please sign on today.   Second, the Senate has an opportunity now to reaffirm our opposition to torture and our commitment to the Geneva Conventions, which ban it. The Senate is debating a bill authorizing Defense Department actions for this year, and Senator Richard Durbin (D-IL) has offered an amendment repudiating torture and re-confirming our commitment to uphold international human rights as specified in the Geneva Conventions.2   A vote on the Durbin amendment is expected early this week. Please call your Senators now, at:     Senator Ron Wyden   Phone: 202-224-5244     Senator Gordon H. Smith   Phone: 202-224-3753   Urge them to support the Durbin amendment to the Defense bill. Then say something about why it's important to you that we repudiate torture and support the Geneva Conventions.   Please let us know you're calling, at:     http://www.moveon.org/callrumsfeld.html?id=2944-3221821-jQYtKeIO.FBuQW12ElaPCQ   Thank you, for all you do.   Sincerely,   --Carrie, Joan, Lee, Noah, Peter, and Wes   The MoveOn.org Team   Tuesday, June 15th, 2004   Footnotes:   1. FaithfulAmerica is a new project of the National Council of Churches, "an online community of people of faith who want to build a more just and compassionate nation."   2.

      Back in the year 2000 (the good old days), I was still new to the city of Portland.  One night at Fellini's, I met the lovely and uber-talented Lisa Stringfield.  We hung out for about a year.  We even celebrated our birthday together.  Her band Carmina Piranha (since dissolved) was amazing; one of the greatest live bands in Portland that I have ever seen.  We were tinkering with an idea that never went very far, a film collective called Mezza Luna (spelling?).  Last year, one-half of Carmina Piranha, Lisa and Lara joined with two new members formed a new band, Carmina Luna.  It interesting to see how ideas congeal over time.  I haven't heard them yet, but I hope I will.  Thanks for keeping in touch.    urlLink Carmina Luna

      Last week Jessie and I saw a live butoh performance in Saiin, Kyoto.  We met some friends and entered a room on the eighth-floor.  In the center, rocks, two dead trees and a log.  Loud, dissonant, noise-core rises from a speaker somewhere at the back of the room, but the lights don't go down.  A gaunt, bald Japanese man in a black suit, white-powdered face enters slowly from behind a door like a break-dancing zombie, and with small, jerky movements makes his way to the rocks, takes off his clothes, and commenses to a 30 minute ritualized dance.  "Butoh is a contemporary avant-garde dance form which originated in Japan and which was first performed there in 1959. It combines dance, theater, improvisation and influences of Japanese traditional performing arts with German Expressionist dance (Neue Tanz) and performance art to create a unique performing art form that is both controversial and universal in its expression. It has evolved to become an international art form with artists and groups devoted to teaching and performing it in East and South-East Asia, North and South America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Hawaii."    The next morning (3:10am) our neighbor woke us up to help his wife who was had injested too many mushrooms.  They just moved out this morning.        urlLink Butoh: Dance of Darkness   urlLink Butoh.net

      Saturday night in Kyoto.  Jessie and I were planning on going to a party behind the old Shugakuin Imperial Villa just up the hill from our Gai-Jin (forgeiner) house, but it was cancelled again due to rain.  So, we set out to make our own party.  First, we hung out at Kamo River (Kamogawa in Japanese) watching fireworks and lighting in the sky as it began to rain.  Then Jessie took me to a bar called "Backgammon".  There is a loft above the bar.  Two other cool features:  you can draw or write on the wall (a grafitti-friendly bar), and if you need a beer, you don't have to climb down the re-bar ladder to get it.  They send it up to you in a dumbwaiter!  No one has to move very much.  However, the spicy chips (Doritos) and "avacado dip" was almost the equivalent of $10.  What the hell?  "Where do they get off offering escargo on the same menu that pawns off Doritos as 'spicy chips'?" asked Jessie.  And I can quote her! The night got weirder after that, but its not worth writing about.  Maybe it had something to do with the strange grafitti I found on the light fixture upstairs in Backgammon.

      The Yasukuni Shrine is a Shinto shrine located in Tokyo that commemorates Japan's war dead (the people my grandfather's tangled with while their friends&nbsp;fought the Germans).&nbsp;   The shrine was founded in 1869 as Tokyo Shokonsha, and was renamed Yasukuni Shrine in 1879. It was build in order to commemorate and worship those who have died in war for their country and sacrificed their lives to help build the fundament for a peaceful Japan (the meaning of Yasukuni is "peaceful country").   The deities of about 2.5 million people who died for Japan in the conflicts accompanying the Meiji Restoration, the Satsuma Rebellion and similar domestic conflicts, the First Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War, the First World War, the Manchurian Incident, the Second Sino-Japanese War and the Pacific War are enshrined at Yasukuni Shrine in form of mortuary tablets with inscribed names. The Yushukan, a museum commemorating Japan's wars is located just next to the shrine's main buildings.   A big political contravercy surrounds the Yasukuni Shrine because since 1978, fourteen class A war criminals are among the 2.5 million people enshrined at Yasukuni. Furthermore, the visits by several Japanese prime ministers to the shrine since 1975 have been causing concerns regarding a violation of the principle of separation of church and state.   For some people, especially in the Asian countries which suffered most under past Japanese imperialism, the shrine has become a symbol for Japanese militarism and ultra-nationalism, and many are taking the prime ministers' visits as a sign hat Japan's political leaders are not looking critically enough at their country's history.   Attempts to remove the war criminals from the Yasukuni Shrine have failed due to the shrine's refusal. Other discussions to solve the problem center around plans to create a currently non-existent alternative to the Yasukuni Shrine for commemorating and worshipping Japan's war dead.  &nbsp;  urlLink Japan PM's Visit to War Shrine Illegal   &nbsp;
