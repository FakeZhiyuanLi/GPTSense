      "It's really a great travel, i can never forget it and all my friends in our group." I wrote this&nbsp; on the position paper when this memorable tour finished. &nbsp; We started this tour from Adelaide on 7th, July, by a TOYOTA minibus... Our guide is a humurous man over 50 years old with a big beard, who is full of energy and never feels cold. We all backpackers should thank this guy, he has very good guiding experiences and has a special ability to organize us together. We never feel lonely or boring in these days.  &nbsp; The cabin where we stayed for the first night is really nice, very warm and comfortable. This is my first time to overnight in a cabin, with some foreign friends, in a foreign counryside. A family manges this hostel, it's in a clear field, 30 mins' drive way to the nearest town. You can easily find many kangaroos near their home. By the way, I tasted kaangaroo meat for the first time and I think it's like beef, a litte strong. Any way, it's not bad.... &nbsp; We sat around a elliptic dining table, talking every funny things happened to ourselves, share the happy air beyong us. The most funny thing is that we every one should imitate sounds of some animals, like rooster, sheep, pig, dog, cat,,&nbsp;in their own languages...ha, it's very interesting.. You can imagine, we come from China, England, America, Canada, Scotland, Switzerland,,,, make some sounds like animals in different ways.  &nbsp; Later that night, I asked the host of this hostel, " why are u living here, not some big city like Melbourne and Adelaide?" You know, it's a little desolate here. The cool man said," I love bush, I love living here. The air is so fresh.. Although a littel far to the nearest towns to buy some necessities, there is no traffice problem. The only problem is the bill of petrol." The man is about fourty, has a very&nbsp;beautiful wife and a lovely son. This family lives&nbsp;at the&nbsp;hill foot, enjoy the nature everyday! Do&nbsp;you envy them? Can you be like&nbsp;them? &nbsp; We continue with our travel the following morning, after had&nbsp;a very good breakfast. &nbsp; What&nbsp;would happen later?? &nbsp;

      Tow hours later,  the final match of 2004 Asian Cup will kick off, China as a host vs Japan.. Probably I can's watch the live, it means I lose a chance to see China being the Champion... I have been a crazy soccer fan for approximately ten years, I love this skillful, challenging, exciting, and brave game. In the past ten years, I didn't miss any important soccer match. However, the 2004 Euro Cup and Asian Cup are off my eyes. I can't receive any game by my TVset. It's really a big shame. Anyway, China will hot the Champion Cup tonight, in Beijing. It's such a long time for us... Cheers!

      Now im fixing my last semester. Since i've finished 5 in the previous two terms, there're only 3 courses left for me. Sounds good? But we can never avoid those assignments and projects.:) Two of them are focused on mathematical computations and thoeries. Another is about some front technology in the telecommunication field. Isn't it a good combination? You're going to feel boring some time obviously. Anyway, it's easy to go.. haha...  I'm used to hit the bed over 1 pm every night, and even later during weekends. Although it's not good for my health, and I do feel sick and tired of everything in daytime, I can't get over this problem.. Anybody can make some suggestions? I know no one comes to see my blog,haha...  So, I write to relax, to keep something fresh.. I think I will go on with this blog,,,maybe update it once a week, or one month,  it depends..Anyway, it's part of my life.  Ok, natural calling..  To be continued........
