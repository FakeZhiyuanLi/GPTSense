       urlLink      Like I'd do that?!?!    urlLink      How tempting it is to just go beyond the normal nice expectations and just walk up to a cute butt you see and give a little pinch  Oh don't mind me....I'm just a bit too mischievous for my own good.  And now you wonder if I really did this or not.  Hee hee hee....

       urlLink     I switched from MGD to Bud   urlLink      Well...break out the acid wash and wait....is that the faint smell of Drakkar Noir?!?!?  My tongue is firmly planted in my cheek and when I go out and about and see this...it takes all of me not to just get so viciously catty when I do. I gave up on the 80's so long ago. I don't know this guy but I see so many of them...and it scares me. The mullet will not die, nor will some fellas ideal of "back in the day".   I often wonder... underneath it all, is there a mullet man lurking inside every guy. "But Wait ....Duuuuude!" No way dude! I hope not.

       urlLink     I've got this to say &nbsp; urlLink     Usually, I always have something to say.&nbsp; I have been known to bite my tongue and save words.&nbsp; I have been known to engage in witty banter.&nbsp; I can give a wonderful&nbsp; and entertaining presentation. And I have been rendered speechless a couple of times. But I also have the tendency to have the last word... actually I will go to lengths to have the last word.&nbsp; Sometimes, I say something cutting or cynical.&nbsp; Sometimes it is a kind sweet word.&nbsp; And I try to leave it like a lady...with a little grace. Lately, too many things have been creeping up and I've had to watch my tongue, but I have gotten the last word in.&nbsp; And I was nice about it.

He will respect you until the day he dies. Congrats!!   &nbsp; urlLink    So... I had time to kill and needed a giggle...so I took this quiz  urlLink http://quizilla.com/users/ponygirl2008/quizzes/Which%20male%20celebrity%20are%20you%20going%20to%20marry%3F%20(14%20choices%20now !!)

Very married (but to a sweetie), nice ass, can do just about any accent,( Great "Pikey" in SNATCH)&nbsp;and did  7 Days in Tibet, &nbsp; because he felt it was the right thing to do and believed in it   and now&nbsp;is "uninvited" to China for life.

       urlLink     The Land of Lupines... &nbsp; urlLink     A few weeks ago... I dipped my toes in Lake Superior and proclaimed all was well with the earth. Since then...life has been pretty chaotic.&nbsp; That and the fact that for the first time in TEN years...I got a speeding ticket. I've been pretty frazzled about a lot of things lately...the speeding ticket was the wake up call for me.&nbsp; The literal meaning of ... You need to slow down . So I was talking to a dear friend and they gave me some advice.&nbsp; Being the music girl that I am, the first thing I ask...are those lyrics.&nbsp; No they are not...and I have permission to share them with you.    And listen to the voices of the summer night breezes; the whispering of the universe...

       urlLink     ROCK ON!!! &nbsp; urlLink     I was accused of being politically biased at work. EXCUSE ME! I have laws I have to follow. According to the older American’s Act and because I receive federal and state funding, I must have an "open door" policy for political candidates to visit the centers.  So this being the political season, I’m getting calls from candidate’s offices to come and "visit" our centers. Amazingly…I’m only getting calls from one party. I’m not soliciting, I’m not asking them to come, and I’m trying to keep my personal convictions to a minimum. I just have one rule…Don’t mess with my seniors. Most of them are pretty savvy and can see through the bullshit.  So, because one party is visiting…I was accused of being biased. To quote: "Martha, that’s not right of you to not have__________ come to the centers also." (Notice the wording…pretty Freudian) I informed them that I don’t invite…they invite themselves to the center. Well….. _________’s office hasn’t called me to drop by, but _____can come and have lunch at anytime with us. (Maybe I’ll have them on cabbage day. Being a politician can be pretty stinky business.) I’m getting tired of this political crap already and it’s only July. We have 3 ½ months to go. Well, goodie goodie. I think my soapbox is broken for the day…

       urlLink     Mugging with My Fave guitar player &nbsp; urlLink    Meeting Tommy Emmanuel was a thrill.&nbsp; Just because he's a superstar in Austraila, doesn't mean that he's a guitar god in the US.&nbsp; In fact, I feel pretty lucky to have had breakfast with him this time around.&nbsp; He's getting bigger and bigger and chances like this won't happen in the future. It's a long story, but I belong to the TE Discussion group and have chatted with fans and his manager.&nbsp; At his Bayfield concert, I met up with his manager, Gina and TE and Lizzy, his girlfriend.&nbsp; They are just great people.&nbsp; The conversation just flowed and we all found out that we have many things in common.&nbsp;  So here I am a name dropper and I wouldn't have changed anything in the world.&nbsp; I"m already planning for next year in Bayfield and if Tommy gets to Prairie Home Companion...I'll hide out with Gina if I'm allowed.&nbsp; ANd I"m taking them to Slippery's.&nbsp; And that is another story for another day.

       urlLink     Keep Smiling!&nbsp; urlLink     &nbsp;  Sad day for Martha Stewart...5 months in jail, 5&nbsp;months house arrest, 2 years probation and $30,000 fine.  She was led away in cuffs ( he he he - &nbsp;all you kinky people and your fantasies) and proclaimed that it was a shameful day. She also apologized and I think it was the first time that I have ever seen her show her true feelings.&nbsp; I'm kind of torn.&nbsp; I love her colors and she has nice things, but she's a&nbsp;poster child for psycotropic medications if&nbsp;I've ever seen one!&nbsp; Maybe a "break" will allow her to gain some new perspective.&nbsp;It's a high price to pay for $400,000 and a lie. Life is too short to be Karmatially challenged.&nbsp; Sorry, Martha.

       urlLink    Too touching for words...&nbsp; urlLink    Get Fuzzy is my favorite comic. It can be irreverent and just plain bizzare.  Sometimes, it can be just touching...like this comic when Ray Charles passed away.  Although, Sachel's (the dog) reaction is childlike, it really hits home when you think about it.  Sometimes, you just have to write a letter and send it off like that...

       urlLink    Wishin and Hopin&nbsp; urlLink    Oh Dear Dusty, What shall I do? I have a wonderful chance to sing for a gig.  It's a big break for me...and it's jazz.  But I have a problem of which direction to go.   You see...there's the "popular" way to go and then there's the artistic way to go.I haven't even sung one note and I'm already having some artistic differences.   So, I've come up with an idea...I'll learn some of the songs the piano player wants me to learn and he will have to learn some of the songs I want to sing.  Compromise.  Sure, Diana Krall is the way to go for jazz music right now and I'll sing her, but I don't want to sing Norah Jones.  To me she's not jazz...but I suggest ( and even burned) some songs and I get this nose in the air crap.  I've made my song list out.  He will make his and we will meet in the middle.  I'm only a "guest" vocalist...I get that "featured vocalist" billing.  That's where the greats ( Peggy Lee, Rosemary Clooney, Billie Holiday, Ella to name a few) started and I'm starting at the beginning, too. ( I just need a couple of songs that really showcase my voice and then ears will perk up... which may lead to other gigs.  I'm always thinking!) Dusty always had to deal with compromise.  Between her personal life and her musical integrity, Dusty was always making choices.  So now I invoke the Diva Wisdom of Dusty.

       urlLink    Really Pissed...&nbsp; urlLink    This is how I feel on Monday mornings.  I wake up and think..."What the hell... what am I gonna wear, what do I have to do???" I can wake up real early and have no problems.  I think it's got to do with my REM cycle - no not the band, the actual sleep cycle, people.  But I can also stay up till the wee hours.  I'm just not a morning person, but thank goodness I'm not like Glen Campbell in this photo,but this is how I feel on monday mornings.  Well, it's another day;another buck, $3.80.   Don't mind the phraseology here either...you'll get to hear all of my doozies one of these days.

       urlLink    What in the name of Kenny Rogers...?&nbsp; urlLink    I got a new favorite website…http://www.menwholooklikekennyrogers.com/ Yes…there are tons of men that look like Kenny Rogers.   The real Kenny  - I think  - is 60 something and just had twins.  The man still has got it.  You go, Kenny! And I think there are many men that want to get it…so why not Kenny.  This site is a multipurpose site too!  You have tips on how to look like Kenny, how to spot men like Kenny, recipies,  A Kenny of the Month…you name it and it has it. Did you know that Papa Smurf looks like Kenny?  Uncle Jessie from the Dukes of Hazzard does too!  I bet you know of a couple of men that really do look like Kenny. God…the silliest things amuse me.

       urlLink    Skyrockets in Flight!  Afternoon delight...&nbsp; urlLink    Sometimes you get a song in your head and you can’t get it out of your head.  If it is a good song…fine.  But if it is a bad song, your day is shot.  These are the ultimate in craptastic tunes – in my opinion.  To borrow from an annoying song (by the Partridge Family)… Hello world, there’s a song that we’re singin’! Come on…get snarky!  Add to the list!  I know you have a couple of tunes that you despise.   (Show tunes are not allowed.   Most people consider them annoying.  Some of us don’t)  THE ULTIMATE NOT TO GET IN YOUR HEAD Starland Vocal Band - Afternoon Delight 	  THE worst tune to get in your head and now a part of a new movie (Anchorman) Just when you think you’ve got it out of your head…it’s back.  Paul Anka - Havin' My Baby Michael Jackson - She's Out of My Life  	 Michael….she never was in your life  Captain & Tenille - Muskrat Love Billy Ray Cyrus- Achy Breaky Heart 	 Mullet head song….sung by a mighty fine mullet man.  BORDERLINE BAD ONES…  Herman's Hermits - Henry the Eighth  	 It’s just like the “song that never ends”.  It’s cute for a while then it bugs the piss out of you.  Glen Campbell - Rhinestone Cowboy  	 All you ever get is to the first line and you go no further…”Like a rhinestone cowboy…”  Elvis Presley - In the Ghetto  	 The chorus is the fun part…the fact that it is written by Mac Davis saves it.  Culture Club - Do You Really Want To Hurt Me?   Nice little reggae ditty, but Have this one in your head long enough and you really do want to hurt somebody.  Commodores - Three Times a Lady   Irritating as hell…but think of Buckwheat singing it  (a la Eddie Murphy) and its fun again…Unce, Tice, fee times a mady….  Air Supply - All Out of Love   Air Supply songs are all annoying… get one of these in your head and your day is long gone…they come back like a bad rash.  But I found out that Tommy Emmanuel was the studio musician for them, playing some of the guitar solos, and they are saved from BAD SONG HELL. (PS – I think they owe Tommy some “props” and royalty cash too.)  Hall & Oates- Maneater 	 “Whoa oh here she comes…” Catchy isn’t it? Gotcha!  SPECIAL HONORABLE MENTION CATEGORY Kenny Rogers – The Gambler, Lucille, or Lady  You get any one of these in your head and you get that Kenny ‘growl’ and his vibrato.  You get that stuck in your head just because it’s Kenny.  Chicago –You’re the Inspiration 	 Peter Cetera  - need I say any more?  Exile  - Kiss you all Over  The chorus is mighty catchy…and can be sung on the intercom system of your local grocery store by stock boys very well. (Another post…another time)

       urlLink    my "Favorite" teen idol.&nbsp; urlLink    I was reading the St Paul paper today and the front-page picture was of Matt Dillon and Lili Taylor filming a movie.  It jogged a memory and I’ve been waiting to tell this story. I haven’t told this one for a long time.  Years ago, they filmed “Beautiful Girls” in Stillwater.  I was working at the Minnesota Zephyr and they used the depot as a spot for cast and crew to have lunch.  Timothy Hutton and Uma Thurman were incredibly sweet and posed for pictures and gave autographs. Then in walked Teen Idol heaven…Matt Dillon.  He hung out with some of the crew and ate but didn’t pose for photos.  I asked a crewmember if he would be willing to give an autograph.  He looked up and then at me and then said (I read his lips) “no F’ing way”.  Well… The next day I had a day off of work and they were filming a scene across the street from my apartment.  My porch was Hollywood central!  The Crew and Cast had the caterers set up there, but they didn’t order a porta potty, so they asked to use mine.  No problems.  I had hot coffee and homemade treats and sat and watched the process of Mira Sorvino walk from the house across the street to her car all the whole day.  It took longer than expected due to the fake snow, and my phone and potty were used a lot.  So some of the other stars showed up to eat and hang out.  Lo and behold, my “fave” teen idol (heavy sarcasm here), Matt Dillon strolls up the drive to the catering tent.  After about an hour, his “assistant” comes to one of the crewmembers that I was hanging out with to ask me if Mister Dillon ( oh pullllleeeeezzzzeeee) could use my bathroom.  I looked at the crew member, the “assistant”, and then made serious eye contact with “mister Dillon” and then looked the assistant straight in the eye and said “no, f’ing  way”.   At that moment, I think mister Dillon remembered who I was from the day before.  I wish I had a picture for the look on his face.  I then proceeded to tell the story of the day before to the crewmember.  We laughed and that was my movie making experience.  ( I guess he showed his personality to her too.) I know that it is mean to deny people the chance to use a bathroom, but don’t be an asshole.  I understand the need for privacy and the perils of being a public figure, but don’t be an asshole.  The day before, I was nice and polite and was not intrusive to him at lunch, but don’t be an asshole.  And I feel that way about any person, star or not.  Don’t Be Karmatically Challenged.   That’s my brush with fame. An paybacks can be uncomfortable.  (I wonder how long he had to do the Pee Pee Dance. Hee hee!)

       urlLink    Not asking for much&nbsp; urlLink     When this time of the year rolls around...my wanderlust gets the better of me.  I want out.  Getting up in the morning is a beast - more than usual, because I am SOOOO not a morning person and just being at work is a drag.  Worse yet, the people I enjoy being around just get on my nerves even more. And when I start thinking of looking for another job...then I know that I really need to get away. Yes...it's time to take off of work for an extended length of time.  A thing called a vacation; a holiday. Sure, I went North 2 weeks ago to a concert.(That is for another post)  I dipped my toes into Lake Superior and proclaimed that all was right with the world - it's my little centering ritual. But 2 days does not make a vacation.  I need to stay away from work long enough to not think about it while I'm gone. So I'm open to suggestions...good cheap fun.  I could stay in my house for a week, but the sad thing is I know my seniors and work will find me. I GOTTA GO!  And I don't need to have umbrellas in my drinks.

       urlLink    One...Singular sensation!&nbsp; urlLink    My sister and I were having a wonderful discussion about our childhood.  We have come to the conclusion that we are warped.  No…not from abuse or horrific and traumatic events.  No!  Nothing of the sort.  Sure we had the typical family dysfunction, but nothing like “having a meth lab in your basement” kind of stuff. We have come to the realization that Broadway Show Tunes have shaped our psyches. I’m not kidding. What child would know all the lyrics to A Chorus Line, Godspell, Barnum, and Annie by the time they were 10?!?  (I’m happy to say I deviated from the mix and found the Manhattan Transfer and the Streisand albums.)   But we ran around the house happily singing  “Tits and ass…bought myself a fancy pair….”  And we were pretty cool little kids for knowing all of “Day By Day” for Junior Choir at church.  My happiest moment was seeing my sister sing “Tomorrow” for the school talent contest when she was in first grade.  And my proudest was when I was playing “Chairy” in Barnum and dedicated the role to my mom, who now has been married to the ultimate showman/Director, my dad, for over 37 years. I still watch the Tony Awards and sometimes I have a bittersweet moment.  But sometimes knowing that you are the greatest star in your own living room is a good feeling too. So if the moment strikes me…you better watch out, I might just break out into a Show Tune when you least expect it. PS – We shared this with our parents.  My mom whole-heartedly agreed and smiles about it when she hears a song from one of the shows.  My dad grandly tells the story of how his two girls would act out the parts of his favorite shows for him.  And they both proudly exclaim how they “warped” their daughters for life.

       urlLink    Merry Christmas!!!&nbsp; urlLink     WARNING: ULTRA CYNICAL POST WITH TONGUE FIRMLY PLANTED IN CHEEK Those of you who know me...know I dislike Christmas.  It was always a busy time for our family with the flowershop. And my birthday is so close...If I had a dollar for everytime I heard "Oh, I got your Birthday and Christmas Present together...", I'd have a large nest egg.  But alas..no.  Christmas time also really brings out the true nature in humans.  People can be rude assholes at this holiday.  Try Wal-Mart on Christmas Eve...  You ask "What, in the name of Kenny Rogers, are you doing at Wal-Mart on Dec 24th?"  Well, It was on the way back from visiting the relatives and we have to see if they have any more glass balls on sale. Now, the glass ball story will be saved for another posting with a picture of my parent's christmas tree...actually it is Henry's tree (my dad).  The tree looks like Liberace blew up all over it or a little piece of a Las Vegas extravaganza in the living room.  This past year's tree had over 500 balls and 700 lights...we asked him to tone it down.  I'm seriously trying to change my attitude about the Holiday season.  That's why I'm starting now.  I just might get to a "festive" mood when the day rolls around. Anyway...a friend sent me this to remind me that we have less than 6 months of shopping days till the big day. I think Grandpa really is sharing that holiday spirit.  This is my kind of Christmas. (and notice the nice sedate Chrismas tree...) Fa la la la la la

      Why do I adore dark-haired, dark-eyed boys?  Tony DeFranco.  Heartbeat is a love beat and when we meet it's a good vibration...  There was Tony, and John Travolta, and a young Scott Baio, and the guy that dated Valerie Bertinelli before Eddie.  (Am I  SO  TigerBeat or what!) And then there was my high school sweetheart. Then came the Englishmen!  (Don't even go there!!!)  Eric Clapton in his Armani Suits (English with Italian) the 80's Brit Boy bands - too dishy for words.  Even Prince Charles or Andy (I wanted to be a real life princess) I can even say I have my own personal "Daniel Cleaver" in my life. And Colin Firth can come over for a cuppa anytime. Why this now... I just finished the book, “Under the Tuscan Sun”. Passion, creativity, chances,  romanza  and living life to it’s fullest.  I’m listening to Andrea Bocelli and Eros and suddenly want to cook and create, buy food in an open market and move to a villa in Europe.  That and Tony DeFranco may be coming to the state fair.  After being in hiding in the 80's and 90's, he's back singing and performing.  Now...I just have to find Davy Jones for Mim (and I, even though I think Mike was the coolest one of the bunch) and we will be set!  Ciao!

      So all I wanted to do was make a comment on my sister's pic and I found myself here.  Maybe that's good, maybe that's bad...maybe that's just the way it is. Actually...a commentary on what is really going on is not so bad...then I can just direct people here and not have to retell the story a million times!  Such a clever girl! So...I'm here and I'm blogging. and now I have to add a bunch of stuff to this, which might be kind of fun. Welcome to the 21st Century!

       urlLink     good wishes   urlLink    I have a quality that is wonderful and it has also caused a lot of hurt and heartache. I am a blind idealist. I look to the good of everyone and everything.  And I always root for the underdog.  I'm a born caretaker and I want to save the world sometimes.  Thank goodness I have allergies otherwise I would have helped every stray dog on the planet.  I also believe in everything...I wear rose-colored glasses...and I always hope for the best. In my years, I have been hurt, heartbroken, messed up, totally disillusioned...you name it ...all because of this trait. I should be a jaded woman.  I'm not.  I'm still standing.  Still loving, laughing and learning. This is me and I'm not going to change it one bit.  I'll adapt, I'll fine tune, and I'll polish up.  But I will not change for anyone or anything... this is one of my most endearing qualities. And this is who I am. Don't postpone Joy...

       urlLink     The M&M Girls...   urlLink    I'm looking at the older sister and KNOW just what she had her little sister do! I know this relationship well... I love my sister. She has the biggest heart, can write better than some of the best selling novelists, and makes me so very proud. She hides some things about herself, but then again, we all do. But I know that Love will come to her and her world will be well. Not that things aren't good now. She's got the most funny friends...true friends too. She has a fantastic job that she loves...and she's wonderful at it. And she kicks ass in Karaoke. ( Her version of " Suspicious Minds"  and " Baby got Back"  hold a candle to none) She has beautiful eyes and a smile that is warm and inviting to all. I've seen her work a crowd and she has charisma. And she's great with her co-workers and customers. You should see her with the little kids during storytime...it's a whole new side to her that I love and the little ones just adore her. Ok...she's going to kill me for gushing, but I want to brag. And she deserves some "props". And when I saw this picture...it reminded me of the little girl that had long ringlets...and had no fear...and told ya like it is. She still does and I love her very much!  So...my baybee sista my baybee sista...can i borrow a copy of your "Hey Soul Classics?"   No my sista...you must buy your own.  Yeah MIM!

       urlLink     On a mission from God   urlLink    This movie is the best.  If you are in a funk...put it on.  If you want to laugh, put it on.  If you want to see the greatest car chase scene known to man in cinematic history...PUT IT ON! Had a conversation with a friend regarding singing the blues.  I love the blues.   And as much as I love to sing... this blonde blue-eyed girl really has no business singing the blues. When I saw Dave "Honeyboy" Williams in Chicago...I was so awestruck.  He is the last living link to Robert Johnson and the Crossroads.  Amazing...80 something and still going on tour.  I think the fun part was taking a friend that never heard the blues before to hear Honeyboy.  She was blown away and now loves the blues.   You just feel the stuff in every part of your being... Now here's some thoughts 'bout singing the blues.   Do you have the right to sing the Blues? Answer "Yes" if : a. your first name is a southern state—like Georgia b. you’re blind  c. you shot a man in Memphis. d. you can’t be satisfied. e. you're older than dirt  Answer "No" if : a. you once were blind but now can see. b. you’re deaf c. the man in Memphis lived. d. you have a trust fund or an IRA.e . you have all your teeth  f. you were once blind but now can see  Acceptable Blues beverages are:  wine, whiskey, muddy water, beer, black coffee.  Blues beverages are   NOT:  mixed drinks, kosher wine, sparkling water, Snapple, Starbucks Frappuccino, or Slim Fast. Although Rubber Biscuits and the Wish Sandwich are famous blues snacks, better stick to common blues grub like Greasy Bar-b-que, Fatback and beans, and Government cheeze. Blues food is never: Club sandwich, Sushi, or Crème brule.  The Build Your Own Blues Singer Name Starter Kit:  a. Name of physical infirmity (Blind, Cripple, Lame, Asthmatic) b. First name or name of fruit (Lemon, Lime, Kiwi) c. Last name of a U. S. president (Jefferson, Johnson, Fillmore, etc.) Examples: Blind Lime Jefferson, Cripple Kiwi Fillmore, etc. (Okay, maybe not "Kiwi"…)   Excellent names for female Blues singers:  Sadie, Big Momma, Bessie, or Fat River Dumpling.  Excellent names for male Blues singers:  Willie, Joe, Little Willie, Lightning, or Big Willie. Singers with names like Muffy, Sierra, Auburn, Alexis, Gwenyth, Sequoiz, Brittany or Rainbow are not permitted to sing the Blues, no matter how many men they shoot in Memphis.  My inner Blues Momma....Pale Cherry Clinton   ( Clinton...has a double meaning and I choose the George variety cuz I gots to have the funk) and order me up some dry white toast...

       urlLink     Foamy on a rant...   urlLink    Foamy is one pissed-off squirrel.  His favorite word is "f**k", he loves bagels and cream cheese, and he goes off on these rants that somehow make total sense.  The first time I saw Foamy...I almost wet myself I was laughing so hard.  He makes Strong Bad seem like a wuss.  Really.  urlLink http://www.illwillpress.com/vault.html  This is the site for Foamy and his buddies at "Ill Will" Here are some nuggets of wisdom:  On dieting...   * "stop doing all these unnecessary diets. cause ya know, once you get down to your goal weight youll say "sure, i can have an extra piece of cake! look at all the weight i lost!" then before you know it RWEEEET back on the diet cause your a$$ is fallin' out of your jeans."    * "I hate standing in line and in front of me, someone smells! And in back of me, someone smells! It's like being stuck in the middle of a funk sandwich!"   * "i hate it when a diet says you can have 3 hamburgers and a pound of bacon but you cant have an apple, because it has carbs,eeeeeeeeeee, f*ck that!!"    Dating Advice:    *  AND...  watch out for guys that call you by pet names more than they do your own name, and if they ever refer to you as "my girl" you drop that fucker like a rock     *  My only piece of advice to have a sound relationship is to leave each other alone. Don't be overly concerned. Don't try to domineer them, Let them be independent. Let them do what they want. You think you people can understand that?   *  I particularly hate are those fucking slime-balls ... that usually end up going to bars and shit like that on friday, saturday, sunday night, to see if they can pick up chicks. And all they do is walk around with these fucking stupid velvety shirts with their dumb-ass fat hairy chests exposed to the world, as if they were the sexiest thing on the face on the earth. You know what!, you're a middle aged loser, nobody wants to see your hairy chest. Either; throw yourself in front of traffic or overdose, please!. Nobody wants to hear this bullshit anymore, time for some revaluation of ones life.   * And in closing, you know it’s shit like this that pisses me off it’s just these types of people that have no "inner soul" no nothing, they just revolve around their own pathetic little world with no consideration for what’s going on around them. They have no sense or grasp of reality and really need to be taken off the face of this earth, they have no substance, they have no control over themselves...   This is one Bad Ass Little Squirrel.  Enjoy!

       urlLink     My BIGGEST 80's Influence   urlLink     A music consultant once told a friend of mine that music is the most powerful pneumonic device there is...a tune or even part of a tune can instantly transport you to the place/time where you heard that music...good or bad...AND that the music you are most likely to like or prefer is the music you grew up with between ages 17 and 22...Whaddya think? Oh heavens…there are way too many songs to even begin to make a list…  Terence Trent D’arby – Wishing Well  and  Sign Your name  – I hear this and I am instantly transported to Munich. Dancing in a disco with a bunch of people from Viterbo, walking through Marienplatz, Schloß Nymphenburg (my summer residence) and going record shopping in WOM and the playing of that CD all of May in Germany.  Talking Heads – And She Was : Hanging at DJ’s…listening to Jimmy Zons’ band THE URGE and scroggin with the keyboard player. Then taking the song and playing it EVERY Saturday from January till May of 1987 as the official theme song for the DHS Forensics Team. I NEVER GET TIRED OF THIS SONG  INXS – I Send A Message  – Sitting in the Dorms at St Olaf during music camp…and showing up all in black for the first day of class my senior year…new short spiky wedge haircut and a rat tail to the middle of my back. Sitting in the back row of study hall jammin with my walkman on, to this mix from "New Wave Mike" from camp  Violent Femmes – Blister in the Sun  – Road trippin…State Street in Madison…Putting out the hat andJoe Kaiser playing it on his cello for money…  Style Council – You’re the Best Thing  or  Welcome to Milton Keynes . Sitting in Annie Pipal’s dorm room making mixes, road trip to Chicago with Mattchew and oogling Sweet Willie in the hot tub in the burbs.  Bananarama – Cruel Summer  – Watching Live Aid with a major hangover.  Van Halen – Jump  – Jammin upstairs with the Youth Encounter Group at a Church lock in and getting into trouble for being too loud. Make a Joyful noise…  Elvis Costello – Everyday I Write the Book  – Babysitting and watching MTV and calling up a boy…  Marshall Crenshaw – Someday Someway  – Learning that there were new wave rockabilly boys from the US too…and loving jangely guitar tunes. Still do  HouseMartins, Eurythmics Police, the Pretenders Cure, Echo … – Realizing that Brit Pop is where it’s at and I was the strangest creature in DHS. Black peg legs…jazz shoes, blazers scrunched to the elbows, sunglasses all the time, bandannas, moussed hair…and then changing into Molly Ringwald, wearing v neck sweaters backwards, pearls with everything, and shopping at Ragstock.  Tears for Fears – Everybody Wants to Rule the World  – Ridin the Amtrak to Milwaukee and meeting my HS sweetheart on the train.  Modern English – Melt With You  – Freshman year PUNK/New Wave day for Homecoming week…BRIGHT orange bouffant hair and ripped T-shirt and a jumper made out of black trash bags…it had ruffles and a bow. I was SOOO cool. Freshman year in college…. house parties at the campus apartments and dancing till dawn. I’ve got tons of songs. This is just the tip of the iceberg…. We haven’t got to the 90’s yet!!!

       urlLink     Gettin the bad girl on...   urlLink     Being a bad girl isn't a bad thing...there's a bad girl inside every woman. Go back as far as you have to go to find the impish grin, the sparkly eyes , the girl with the rediculous outfits. Look for the smirk, look for the fire, and look for the little girl who didn't know enough to be afraid of her own wants. When you spot her, you'll know it. Being a bad girl isn't about breaking the law or being a bitch. It s about being passionate, being an independent thinkier and being yourself. Now...every bad girl has got to have a name...an alias. And having an alias is a way to go from frump to bad girl in 0 to 10 seconds. It can be silly, sassy, flashy, sexy , exotic, or whatever gives you the freedom to bust loose! Here's how.... "BAD GIRL NAME": FIRST NAME, LAST NAME "Dating Diva": Something sweet within sight, any liquid in your kitchen "Girl Detective": Favorite baby animal, where you last went to school "Barfly": The last snack food you ate, your favorite drink "Porn Star": Name of your favorite pet, Mother's maiden name "Soap Opera": your middle name, the name of the first street you lived "Road Trip": what you had for breakfast, where you last peed beside the road  Ok...I'll divulge my bad girl names... Dating Diva -  Jelly Bean Dawn  Girl Detective -  Fawn St Paul  Barfly -  Cookie Merlot  Porn Star -  Cherry Johnson  Soap Opera -  Emily Waters  Road Trip -  Muffin Phillips   Voila...instant Bad Girl!!! Now, just choosing who I am for the day...

       urlLink     I choose vodka and Chaka Kahn   urlLink     A few weeks ago...I dipped my toes and proclaimed that all was well. But...Sometimes you need to regroup and rethink some things.  A lot of things Like your job, your love life, your whole intent on where you want to be and where you want to go... Heavy stuff. And when a girly girl like me gets her nose bumped ( nice way of saying that I'm questioning my self-esteem issues at the mo...) I question EVERYTHING.  In fact, I know that I think WAY too much for my own good. Right now, I'm having a Bridget Jones' Moment... single women my age have them.  This is the time to watch a chick flick and drink a bottle of wine...yes a whole bottle.  And I'm skipping the Chaka Kahn...I'm going hard core - it's Barry White time - Bum shakin, blottoed, and busty.  That's me and my BJM.  So I'll have a headache, but I think this is a much better way to regroup at the mo... Now, I'll go home and... de-bunny.

       urlLink     Ahhhh sleep!   urlLink    Today was one of those days where you just needed to curl up and go right back to sleep. Hot, humid, muggy... the lazy days of summer, whatever you want to call it. Some people might think I'm a little off....no I'm just fine. Hate this sticky weather and what it does to your sinuses and how the day seems to drag by... But then again...To quote John and Paul:   When I wake up early in the morning   Lift my head, I'm still yawning   When I'm in the middle of a dream   Stay in bed, float up stream (float up stream)   Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me   Leave me where I am - I'm only sleeping.   And to quote the great Mim-lo   There is nothing better than your own bed. I swear to Pete that sleeping in my own bed has a Dali Lama like quality to it.    Nuff said my friend. That sounds like a mighty fine nirvana to me. S o I'm gonna be that sleepy little monkey.

       urlLink     Need I say more?   urlLink     So...I decided to park in a different spot at work. You'd have thought the world was taken over by crazed homemakers wielding cheeze-wiz with olive sandwiches and lime jello.  ALL HELL BROKE LOOSE! Jeez...to quote my sister... For the love of Pete..! It's just a parking place.  But no, we had a major international incident about how "Ive always parked there" and "Im the bus driver and I should have a reserved parking place" and my favorite...."Who are you to park there?" (That deserved a middle finger) I left my car parked in its spot.  Tough hop.
