						    That is what my boyfriend said to me tonight.  I mean, okay, I get the X chromosome and all but REALLY, who is he trying to kid here?  Do all guys think this?  Is this why the continuation of the species is up to the female side of the human creature?  I know that I am stressed about school (that's a WHOLE different subject to be tackled at another time) and that I want to move (again, another topic. . . ) so starting a new relationship during this period of time is KIND OF A BIG DEAL TO ME.  Okay, he is basically done w/ his Ph.D. in Chemistry and understands going back to school.  Okay, I flat out asked him if we were "OK" and he said "Yeah!  Why wouldn't we be?"  which begs the question . . . why do I have this strange feeling something is up in Smallville?  Superman seems to be acting a bit strange . . .  Guys, help a sista out here.  If you make a BIG PASS at a girl about 2 weeks into the relationship and she says - "Um, yeah, . . . can that wait a bit so we can get to know each other better?" does this immedeately mean that you guys take it on the chin as some sort of insult?  I mean, he's gotten away w/ more than my average boyfriends have.  And maybe that's the problem.  I let him and now he may think I'm pulling back when, in fact, I am just putting some HEALTHY PERIMETERS around the whole situation.  "Relationships are not stressful" my ass.  At least I am going to NC for a few days so I can clear my head.  My friend, and sister of my heart, has asked me to join her to see her parental units in the mtns.  Ahhhh.  You hate to be single when all your friends are paired up but when you get yours . . . yeah, you REALLY GET YOURS.  And to top the evening off . . . an old "almost" boyfriend wanted to do something tonight too.  Damn, when it rains it pours.  But, again, there is the rain and then there are the flowers.  I'd better start focusing on the tulips and let the clouds just pass me by :).  And my boyfriend is very dear.   I lost the owners manual and don't know quite what to do with him now . . . Hmmmmm.  Maybe that's the problem.

						   Well, since I am one of the worst computer users I know and I actually got this thing up and running, I must say, I am quite proud of myself. And I know friends will be v. grateful too b/c they will no longer get personal rants in the middle of the night due to lack of sleep. Does anyone else find their mind clearer at this time of day????  Anyway, b/c it won't last long, I might as well admit to having a boyfriend (see fav books - not like I didn't do my homework on this one). He's way smarter than me and hopefully will never find this site! He's too busy doing chemistry or whatever . . . I used to work in the arts so what do I know???  My father used to ask me when I was going to get over my hobby (arts) and get a real job. I guess the answer is NOW, since I am returning to school to get some classes done that should have been executed many, many moons ago and THEN hopefully joining the proletariat at large. Blue used to be my fav color but by necessity it has slowly evolved to green.  I have other friends who blog too. They seem to have very deep thoughts and a lot more synapses firing than me. I wasn't sure how I made it through a normal day. After reading some of their stuff, I'm kinda afraid for them now . . . :) But I don't want this to be just a diary of what I ate for breakfast and how many visits to the loo I make. Times are a changin' my friends and we better too. My best advice is to read, read, read LIKE THINGS ON PAPER and make it a point to listen to everything around you. It's going in your ears whether you like it or not. You might as well make a point of making opinions over it. We only live once my friends and that's not just a phrase. Ask anyone who has lost someone the desperately and dearly loved. Pet each moment as you experience it, b/c by it's nature we can't hold onto time . . . we can only cherish it as it passes by.  Friend of mine is going to play at Piatt Park tomorrow from 11:30 am - 1:30 pm. Janet Pressley and she rocks. Anyone in downtown Cincinnati - make it a point to come and hear her! Off to bed and hopefully to sleep, per chance, to dream . . .  But just before I leave, I'd better not get any flaming emails or posts about the title of this blog. I'm sorry if I may not be as sophistacated and "dictionary" as y'all are but at least it's the truth. I'm not trying to fancy anything up. Not to mince words but, life is life and alot of it isn't all that nice. We're all trying to hang tough together. Keep that mustard seed of faith :) And when you have to, just "bitch and moan" with the rest of us b/c one thing you will know - you are not alone.

						   "We stumble and fall consistantly, even when we are most enlightened." Thomas Merton  As the quote adaptly states, no matter how much we think we know . . . we're gonna fall on our ass anyway.  No offence to Norman Vincent Peale or anyone of that genre but sometimes we have to be real, no matter how much we wish we could pretend.  And Kenny, if I end up w/ no friends or family by the end of this excersize . . . IT'S ALL YOUR FAULT. (just sos ya know . . . ;)
