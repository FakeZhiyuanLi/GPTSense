      Alright..I'm gonna be gone for a week, so I won't be able to talk to anyone...for those few of you who read my blog, I'll miss you bunches!!! Isn't it weird how you feel like you have just seen a person when you haven't seen them in like a month..it's just knowing that you've talked to them for a few hours, and it seems to make up all the time...I'm glad I've talked to some of you though. I don't know what I'd do w/o MSN msg.  Well, I must go. Talk to you all later. Maybe sooner.  Much Love

      Alright. Wow! I'm up pretty daggum early! That's not necessarily a   good   thing, either... See, I'm one of those people who has to get their sleep. Beauty rest, if you will.  Anyways... Last night, I went to be around 2:30 or so..and then the phone rang at   6:30   this morning. Ughhh. And usually, after I'm awake, it's too hard for me to fall back asleep, so I'm stuck being the only one in my house that is awake. Well, Dad would be too, but he had to go do some work, and I don't know if Thomas is awake or not, considering he hasn't been here but maybe 3 or 4 days this summer, which would be completely fine with me, EXCEPT for the slight little problem that whenever I get in trouble for doing something, I have to blame it on the dog. Mom didn't seem to buy what I was saying when I told her that Jill bought a pair of Chuck Taylor's on eBay. Go figure... Yesterday was guite some day...First, me & Dweeb talked a while, actually, I think we talked all morning pretty much, although nothing was said. Isn't it funny how you can talk to someone for a few hours, and then you realize nothing has been said...   Well, then later that night, after a quick trip to Wal*Mart, I went & ate at the BV! Yum! Then, to the BlockBuster, to see if they have the Secret Window, but NO, they are ALL out...  So it's back to the house. Then I get mostly packed for Oklahoma...gonna be fun!! I get back on the comp, and start my talking with Dweeb again. Talked about nothing for a while. Then the weirdness/i-don't-know-what-else started...  I don't know. I mean, I'm not at liberty to tell you the happenings. I don't want to get anyone hurt, including myself. If you are a noteworthy person whom I think needs to know about last nights happenings, I will have my people call(or msg) your people.  I would tell you on here, but things could get intercepted & twisted, so it's better not to say on here. I'll tell you in person, seeing as how things are already twisted more than enough.  Well, I think that's about all I can say on here. I think I might possibly have one of the longest blogs. Maybe that will make up for the week that I won't be able to blog, because I'll be in Oklahoma.  Much Love

      Alright..unlike some ppl who already have blogs,(I won't call names..you know who you are) I'm not gonna be stupid & lie on mine, because anyone can read this, and you'll just dig yourself into a hole..a dark, deep one.  Yeah..ok,..just wanted to get that out..anyways..back to ME!!  Well..so far, today has been pretty boring. No one is on MSN msgr. so I haven't talked to anyone today. Since last Sunday, I've been at my grandparents, so I haven't talked to anybody for almost a whole week..and that's not a good thing, because that means I haven't been able to let my feelings and thoughts out..I haven't had a chance to let out everything that's bothering me. Some things are good, some aren't so good.   And I'm having the worst time trying to make decisions.. The hardest deisions are the ones where you have to decide to listen to your friends, who have good intentions and want the best for you, or listen to your heart and soul, which can make you the happiest person, or give you heartbreak. Now, normally I'd just listen to my mind, but of course, when I need my mind, it decides to take a vacation, which I'm supposed to be doing, but I guess the drama never takes a break, so in the mean time, I'm stuck trying to figure out what's the right thing to do..and it's not all that easy. Some days, I'm convinced that I should just go for it, and then the next, I lose all confidence. So, maybe it's a good thing I've been gone, so that way I don't screw my life up too terribly much.  This Sunday, early in the morning, I'm leaving to go with my church's youth group on a mission trip to Oklahoma. That should be fun, considering I've never been to an Indian Reservation Camp before! We'll see. I'll have to get back with you on that one.  Well, I think I'm gonna give this a rest for a while. Much Love

      Ahh.. *Relaxes*  Just thought I'd share some memories with you about my beloved Oklahoma... Sorry, but I won't go into detail about these things, b/c, as much as I detest inside jokes...you know, when you aren't included...these are really good...and most of the few ppl who actually read this know the inside of the joke...     So here goes:  Things I Have Learned from Oklahoma:  -Don't touch Aly's pillowcase...  (It's been forbidden by the law.) -Blair has a fascination with tugging _ _ _  (The name is blank for her own protection.) -Jake Brakes  (For Ann...She made it funny) -It takes  2  calls to housekeeping to get few necessities..  (It was  just  6 sets of towels, a blanket, and 2 coffee packets. -Sometimes it gets too heavy, and then you just have to let it hang..  (If only she knew we were laughing at her ride...) -You never know what you'll run in to at the Rodeo...  (I swear we left to go get a drink. Back me up, Katy..) -MAD ANGRY ATTACK  COWS  OF DEATH..  (Ahh..Good times!! We'll never forget..) -The Tall White Dude  (He knew about the killer attack cows..He saved us..Our "Thanks!" to you) -"Who's Joseph?"  "Your boyfriend??"  (Kids say the darndest things...) -VULTURE!!!.....  (Just a little jingle we picked up along the way) -Pepto-Bismol...  (No clue how you spell it, but we can sing it's theme song!!!) -Susie's continous crying  (*Does impression* Consists of screaming, crying, and going balistic..) -Hunchback..of CPC  (*Does diff impression* Consists of being hunched over, and acting retarded.) -Battle Ship  (A real war..I have wounds...But "I Came, I Saw, I Conquered." -Late night talks with my girls  (Katy likes _ _ _...thinks that Aly obsesses over him...Blair doesn't seem    to dig any guys yet...Jen has actually had quite a few guys...and I'm an idiot    for going out with _ _ _ and should get over him(according to the masses)...  **For the privacy and protection of ceratin individuals, several names have been       blocked out.  Much love..  --Aub

      Alright...after talking to PB for a while, and what music we liked...BTW, we both like basically the same stuff...we have a few differences in opinion, like his unusual, alien-infested opinion of not liking the Chili Peppers..yeah, that's a little wack...much craziness,..but I really can't blame him..I'll forgive him...one day he'll appreciate their music...I'll make sure of it..He just hasn't gotten ahold of the magic of their words, yet. Yeah, so..anyways...we're both into old rock right now...which, btw, is so cool!!! And we went on for a long while taking turns asking each other if they liked ____ or _____. Well, come to find out...He likes Bread!!!! OMG!!! I love it!!! Yeah, so I'm a little biased b/c I was named after one of their songs...but still..how many of you can say you were named after a song..??? Answer me ..write me a comment and tell me if you're named after a song...I'm serious....and I'm talking first name.. So...yeah..it really shocked me that this guy not only knows this,that I'm named after this song...but actually likes it...he likes my song...and he actually has listened to it...and has the CD!!! Craziness...!!! Honestly,I don't think I'll ever forget it..but what would truly be kinda a dream come true, is, say..for some reason or another, if we did start dating,...and it just happened to be the two of us..just me & him,...and we were cuddling...and it was late..and dark...and I was almost asleep,..and he starts whispering the song...singing it..in this quiet, hushed kinda voice...just looking into my eyes...you know, where I could see that he really cared...that he had love in his eyes... Ahh..but then again,..it's just a dream...  Lover Boy-- If you're out there, and you happen to stumble across this...that's a not-so-hidden little hint for you...But PLEASE!!! Don't ruin my dream!!! If you are out there,..and you do decide to do that...make it the right moment...make it romantic...and don't do it until you're sure that it'd make me happy...so, I guess I'm saying for you to wait a good long while before you attempt it...Make it just right..PLEASE!!!   Anyways..just my far-fetched mind dreaming up what would be great... *Sighs*  Well, just wanted to say that I love you all...very muchly..  --Aub

       Blah...   Anyways..gah, I'm so bored.. I am once again in a world of confusion..I think it's my mind playing tricks on me. I wish I wasn't the kind  of person who was constantly changing my mind..but ya know, I'm thankful for it, too. Otherwise, I would've made a few bad choices..nothing life threatening, but all the same, they wouldn't have helped anything either.  New subject..  Don't go making all these promises you don't intend to keep... NO!  You'll only end up hurting you & the one you love.  Alright...well, I don't really have anything to say, so I think I'll be going now.. Thank you for your time.  Much love--

      It's good to be home. I miss Oklahoma, but I was definitely ready to come home.  I'd had enough of some things. What? I'll tell you, because I know you want to know. ( In no specific order..just as they come to mind)  1.) ALL the JR. HIGH drama...I can't stand it...any of it is too much.  2.) Susan's constant crying...honestly, she's 13 now...crying more than once a day,      every day, is too, too much...  3.) Water that smelled worse than I did when I went to take a shower...that's just      not cool...nope..not at all....  4.) Having to share the shower with miscellaneous bugs, lizards, spiders, and giant      toads...for some odd reason, I enjoy my privacy...  5.) Having to sweep the cabin nearly every day, and on the days I wasn't the one to      sweep, it somehow ended up in mine, Aly's, Katy's, and Jen's side of the room...     coincedence, I think not..  6.) Being frozen nearly to death at night...women in menopause, need I say more???  That's all that comes to mind at the moment...if I think of anything else I'll add it to my blog...  I'm not promising that I'll write everyday...I'll try to when I'm here, but no promises...  Well, that's about it I think...  Oh yeah, I really missed some people...(some more than others..) Let's see..I missed: Flash, I really, really missed you...you'll never know how much... Thomas,yep...I actually missed and still do miss my big bro... my mom & dad...except them nagging on me, and me always getting in trouble by them...Ashley, even though I hardly ever talk to you anymore...we really need to get together sometime...hope your trip to the beach is/was alright...and some other ppl...but since not many ppl choose to read my blog, they aren't special enough to be added in it...and katy, you were with me, so I didn't really miss you any..  Well, I'm out.. I'll be back later.  Much Love,  Aub

There's not too many ppl that are actually reading this anyways..so I almost feel like I'm talking to myself, and if that's the case, then I fully accept my apology.        On to more important things..   DADDY'S HOME!!!      Friday, after Band Camp, Katie, Aly, Chelsea, & I went to the Sandwich Shop and had us some sandwiches... Then we went on over to Payne's, and had us some ice cream...

Then Katy &amp; Aly skiied..and then we went back up to the house..Katie Guess had to leave..then we decided we wanted to go to DCI..but I had no other changes of clothes, so I found some of Katy's to wear..

We went up to the church...got Hatherine AND Blair...Then we met Katie Guess at McDonald's...Aly & I got out there and rode with Katie &amp; Mr. Guess...So Mrs. Gibson had Katy, Hatherine, Sarah, Blair, and Thomas..

We met Pip, Poe, Tommy, Chelsea, Krysta, and Poe's dad and brother there..We sat with them..Then Ashton came over & sat with us...She LEFT her seat on the 50 yard line...STUPID...but w/e..   Then we finally got home around 1:30 - 2:00...   Got up around 6:30..got ready for Point Mallard...got to the church...on the rode at 8:32...Mom drove...Aly, Charles, &amp; I rode with her..and Claudette drove..with Holt, Ben, & Adam...We had a lot of fun..It was storming, so we couldn't get in..so we went and ate at WAFFLE HOUSE..NOT Huddle House...**Did you know there's over 70,000,000 ways to enjoy their Hashbrowns???**  Then we went to Cook's Pest Museum...Then we went to a park and played some UNO..then we finally went to Point Mallard...It really was fun..
