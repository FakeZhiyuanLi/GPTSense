       Before today, I'd never, ever met a person who was an outright racist.  I never realized exactly how hurtful it is, but I got a taste of that today.  While it wasn't the best thing for me to go through, I certainly didn't have any qualms about it, because now I know how to cope with it.  And hey, if people don't like me and they don't want my service, then I won't give it to them.  I've got too many other things of interest (to me) that I need to attend to.        I'm too tired and too bored to write about it.  So that's that.      Mmm...I had my first full day of work today.  And I loved every minute of it.  Like, really, it was soo much fun!  I definitely like my coworkers thus far; they're all older than me (I'm the baby of the salon, at 17), but all (with the exception of one) are soo nice to me.  Except for that one individual, they all treat me like a person, and not a teenager who doesn't know anything.  They, like my other employees, have discovered that I learn really fast, so they just show me stuff, and then they let me loose.  I have to learn certain things on my own, though.  So I managed to make the most retail profit for the store tonight.  I sold nearly $500 in products tonight...THANK YOU DAD FOR THE GIFT OF GAB.  THANK YOU MOM FOR MY GREAT STYLE AND LOOKS.        *tired*      And Tina looks stunning when she's all made up!  DRESS UP MORE OFTEN.

        Today I became living proof that God looks out for those who worship Him. Before I go on, however, I'd like to make it perfectly clear that I'm not extremely religious; I typically don't go to church on Sunday, and I don't even know how to pray the Rosary properly. I do, however, pray every night before I go to sleep; when I do pray, I don't take anything for granted, and I try not to pray for mundane things. Everything that I pray about are things that are particularly dear to me, and I do it with all my heart.      One of the things that I've prayed about ever since I started driving was for Him to keep me safe while I was on the road. I'm still a new driver, and I know that I have a lot to learn, and I just pray every night that He watches over me while I'm on the road.       Today, He did just that.      I was planning to take Grandma and Nicole to Arundel Mills today, but I had to get gas, first. I usually go to Reisterstown Rd. for that, so this time, I took Painters Mill. Right before the light at the Subway station, I was in the far right lane, with a truck in the left lane. I don't really remember anything much of what happened next, except for a brief glance up at the space over the truck, where I realized that something was falling. My reaction wasn't something that was instant, I was a bit slow on the uptake to realize what was actually happening. Half a second later, the corner of a plate of sheet glass hit the windshield in front of my face, then bounced off. The thing didn't go through the glass, but there are spidery cracks running through the glass that stem from a round impact point. I'm still reeling from it, and the fact that I could have died from it hasn't hit me yet, either. But I could have. I was hoping not to have gotten into an accident (READ - NOT GET ANY DAMAGE TO MY PARENTS' CAR) in the time that I had my provisionals, but this was something that Fate had in for me. Can't go back and change it, but I'm also trying to make a conscious effort to not take things for granted. Lord only knows if anything else will happen to me next. (The man who was driving the truck in the next lane was gracious enough to pay for the damage to my car. I'm having it replaced tomorrow.)      That news aside, I had my first official day at Trade Secret today. I didn't know if I was to be working today, because Shantel called me up yesterday afternoon telling me that Kara wanted me to come in this morning. Because I didn't know what was going on, I dressed in work attire just in case (my Aritzia pants, a simple black top, and black loafers)--which was good because I ended up working. After some stupid crap about my SS card, I finally got to working. The Beauty Consultant, Nic, who's going to get his license soon provided me with a vast amount of information about how to do the register and stuff like that (I'm trying to learn some products from some of the lines each week). He's such a good teacher! And such a funny guy, too ^_^ (NO, before anyone assumes anything, I'm not attracted to this guy.) Anyway, so he made me feel really comfortable about the job and suchmuch; I really had fun working, even if I knew absolutely Jack about the products. Therefore, I couldn't really help anyone with finding anything, only recommend some stuff that I knew (which was limited to a whole three products from two different product lines). At any rate, my first day was productive.      I really hope that come to like the job (or at least not hate it). This, simply for the fact that I want to maintain a steady job like so many of my peers do. Shantel, for example, has little Jayson, finished high school, and worked every day at Trade Secret. Shaina managed her Culinary schedule while working obscene hours at Panera. Then there's Megan, Julie, Nikki, and Elise, all of which manage to keep at least one job (if not more), while working. Don't even make me bring Devin into this (NSA, other work, school, college -- all at the same time). I don't know how these people can do this. In truth, I want to do it to prove to myself that even if I don't HAVE to do something, I NEED to. I want to maintain this job, mostly because I'm paranoid that, if I don't manage a steady job during my younger years, I'll end up doing the same after college when I actually need to support myself . I also have to learn that I cannot work simply to satiate my every whim, but to try and save up for meaningful expenses (like insurance, future apartment expenses, etc.)--this is not to say that I won't spend money on things that I want, but to say that I'll try and reserve a lot more money than I've been in the past. Which is essentially next to nothing (considering that I could have made nearly $500 from my job at Vacarro's, but have only $800 in the bank...and that's after a large graduation present from Aunte Nene &amp; Uncle Steve. Total, I've lost about $700).       Right now, I'm not even paying for anything (let's see how long this now lasts), and I really want to pay my mother back for all the things she's paid for me (I'll owe her at least $1,000 after my books are paid for), because she's been working so hard for so many things. I don't like knowing that I caused a significant dent in my parents' wallet. It makes me feel so cheap. It's not that I'm ungrateful, it's just that I have no means of paying them back (right now). So, in essence, I need to make at least $1,500 before I can start spending anything. I pray that's not as difficult as it was with my previous jobs.      Blah. I'm gonna go upstairs...nothing to do, cept draw. Crap, I need to do that, too.

       I reread the blurb about myself (to the right), and I realize that I sound relatively inarticularte.  I don't think I'm completely dumb, of course, but when I look back at previous writings from around my sophomore year in high school, I realize that I used to write a lot more dilligently.  There was a nice level of coherence and sophistication that I lack in my current writing style.      The value of a pencil, to me, is amazing.  I was infuriated 90 minutes ago when I couldn't find the pencil that I've been working with for the last two months.  I was SO mad.  Primarily because I've done two of the most amazing sketch pieces that I've ever done with that pencil.  How I miss it.  Ode to the pencil.    In my previous entry, I wrote about how I got a job as a Beauty Consultant at Trade Secret.  I would have never known about any job openings at that place if it wasn't for Shantel or Britanny (the latter quit after only three days on the job).  I don't know how Shantel and I got around to talking about it, but her and I were talking about our jobs one evening while I was working at Vacarro's (a Baltimore-based bakery next to Trade Secret), and I said that I wished there were some openins at T.S.  Shantel did tell me that there were openings there, and before she left that night, she gave me an application to fill out.  Later on that evening, Rachel (a manager at Vacarro's) called, and Britanny (her best friend) was on the phone as well.  I told Rach that I was quitting, and that I was thinking about working at T.S.; Rachel was really irked that I was going to leave, but I told her that I would do it anyway.  Britanny, on the other hand, was like, "OMIGOSH!  You should soo totally work there!  They're so cool!"  Anyway, I filled out an application, and I turned it in to Tiffany about a week later.  I was really worried that I wouldn't get a call back from the store, but about four days later, Cara, the District Manager calls me up and asked to set up an interview with me.  I went for it, and was slightly intimidated during the entire thing, primarily because of how Cara had seated herself (I felt like I was being placed before God and being interviewed).  Anyway, that was that.  After the interview, I was chewing on my nails for about five days because I was worried that I didn't get the position at T.S.  All the while, Shantel was trying to beat it into my head that I did get the job, and that I didn't have anything to worry about...her coworker, Patrice, reassured me and all that nice jazz, but I was still freakin' out.  This morning, however, I woke to the sound of my cell phone ringing, and it was Cara (I kinda stared at the number on the caller ID for a minute wondering who on earth was calling me at a quarter of eleven in the morning).  I GOT THE JOB.  I was uber-excited.  Anyway, so I went to T.S. today to fill out some of the paperwork needed for the job, and I expected to stay no more than an hour; I ended up staying for three just talking to Shantel.  It was nice.    So, Cara wants me to come in tomorrow at 10:30a and finish the paperwork part of it all.  Yaddayaddayadda.  I, as a new employee, am on a probation period of 90 days while they evaluate me, and I hope that I can get the job officially.  It seems like a very nice place to work.  ^_^    Mew.  Now that it's just Nicole and myself, we're going to go out to Panera and eat dinner :)  I can't wait.  I love Panera, and I'm really hoping that I see Jub-Jub there.  :)

       Oh this is just a good day...I snagged the job at Trade Secret as a beauty consultant!       T_T      I just don't know what to wear, though, because the dress code is white, grey, and black, and it's like...T_T I need to go shopping. T_T But I wanna learn the product lines really well so that I can take advantage of the incentives that the store has (COACH Bags, Amer. Express cards, etc. etc.) They got some GREAT incentives. And the pay's not all that bad, either. I'm really excited, but becoming more and more apprehensive. The District Manager wants me to come in tomorrow at 10:30a to get some more of the paperwork done. :) It looks to be nice.      I promised Shantel that if I made good money on my first paycheck, I would have her do my hair. I told her that I wanted some portions of my hair to go blonde. Because I constantly straighten my hair, I would want either the top or bottom layers to be a vibrant red, blue, or something else. I want to go wild with my hair, but I want it to be subtle. And now, I'll be able to start wearing my hair down again because summer is coming to a close. That means it's not as hot and not as humid as it usually is, and I luuuurrrve that.
