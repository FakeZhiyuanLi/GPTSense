						   When I finally got up this morning, I was still exhausted.  But now that I've been up for a little I'm feeling better.  It was a relatively scary feeling.  I've never felt so energyless.  I didn't even have the energy to get out of bed.  YUCK!  But now that I'm up and have cracked my back in multiple places, I'm feeling better.  Making plans too see people this weekend while I'm up in Northern Virginia.  It should be fun.  Though I still have yet to get a hold of the mysterious Doc.  *sigh*  Oh well.  I'll catch up with him soon enough.  But now I need to get to work, cause I'm gonna work tonight for J. R.  So I need to do laundry and get stuff like that done.  This way I can get to work on time and have a little extra cash to pay some bills with.  YEA!!  :)  But I'm gonna go do stuff.  Talk to you later!

						   Ugh . . . I'm tired.  It's tomorrow and I've been off of work just over an hour.  YUCK!  I really hate the restaurant industry.  Though I made decent money tonight.  I'm still exhausted and just completely worn down. I'd probably feel better if I just put my pajamas on.  But if I did that, I'd be passed out cold in a heartbeat.   I really do need to get out of the restaurant industry though.  It's starting to kill me.  Surely but slowly.  Err . . . Slowly but surely is how the saying goes.  I was telling R the other night . . . I think I have slight dyslexia.  Especially recently.  I'm getting mixed up everything.  (yes that was done on purpose).   OOH!!  I just moved my head and my neck cracked.  I so need to see a chiropractor.  When I get all my bills straight and quit bouncing checks.  (Damn it!  I hate when I do that!) I plan on going to see a chiropractor.  Get my back cracked and realigned.  Maybe then it will stop hurting.  Especially my lower back.  Ye gads.   Okay I'm in whiny mode.  I'm going to bed.  Good night.  I'll write again soon.

						   Well today kinda sucked.  Work wise that is.  I only had 7 tables and made $44.  I came up short for what I wanted to make but was thinking that would be okay cause I'd work the dinner shift.  NOT!  The storm we had knocked out the power for a couple hours and they sent me home.  Well apparently it came back on and they re-opened.  Grrr. . . . I know this?  Yes, cause I didn't go home.  I went across the street to this fantastic little coffee shop and had a pink lemondade granita, then called R.  He came down and we talked.  About me taking him back and stuff.  I think I made it clear that though I missed him I wasn't quite ready to take him back.  But at the same time I really really miss him.  At one point we were curled up together on a couch.  Like old times.   We took a walk for a little bit and then he hugged me goodbye.  For about 5 minutes.  I really didn't want him to let go or to say goodbye.  But we both had to go home and he had a bit of a longer drive than I did.  But he called me after we got on 95 and said he could still smell me!  Talk about turning all sorts of red.  I'm guessing it was the paste in my hair or something that he was still smelling.   *Sigh*  Who knows what's going to happen.  But my eyes are drying out and I'm going to go to bed.  I'll see R tomorrow.  We're gonna go see Stepford Wives then go to Bistro for dinner!  WOOHOO!!!  That should be fun.  Basically we're gonna spend the day together.  We'll see how things go.  OH how I wanted him to kiss me today.  Geesh.  Okay child get a hold of yourself and remember why you broke up with him and stay on that track.  Maybe tomorrow isn't such a good idea.  But the wheels are somewhat in motion already and I don't want to cancel and ditch out on him.  He's so looking foward to it.  And so am I.  So I'll just go in with the idea that I'm going out with a friend and try to keep that at the forefront of my mind.  The way it was before we started dating.   Anyway.  good night fair blog reader.  I'm off to dream land.  *SIGH*  more tomorrow about how it all went!!

						   Well I got off work and had 3 messages on my voice mail.  2 were from R.  One asking if someday, sometime I'd give him a second chance.  I'm really torn!  Among other reasons.  (Other than the ones I gave him), were the fact that I really think I need to be single right now.  I need to take care of myself and though I've taken myself off the market completely, I want to be available when I finally meet the guy I'm supposed to marry.  Not, oh yea, I'm dating someone right now . . . but . . .  Umm . . . no.  Like when I broke up with B.  That's where I was.  And hooking up with R that happened over a night of semi drunk passion.  But it had been building for quite a while.  He'd been chasing me for atleast 4 months at that point.  Of course I didn't realize that.  Silly me.  And for the 2 weeks before we finally hooked up, we were almost inseperable.  Not that we don't talk all the time now as it is.  I do miss him.  I won't deny it.  I miss being able to just go over there and cuddle up with him.  That was one of the things I loved about our relationship.  We are both such cuddly people and that was one thing that we did well.   R and I are supposed to go to the Bistro on Thursday night then to go see oh shit . . . what's the movie . . . The Stepford Wives!!  And he wanted to talk I guess some about the message he left and I guess there are some other things too.  I just need to be able to prepare myself for it.  *Sigh*  God, please help me.  Give me the strength, wisdom, and words.  I still care for him a lot.  More than I care to say.  And I do miss him.  But it bothers me that my family doesn't care for him that much.  Makes me wonder if they see something that I don't, can't see?  They like B much better.   Don't get me wrong.  I like B, he's a nice guy, but I don't know.  He woke me up Saturday morning and I found myself missing R!   There is something seriously wrong with me.   See now why I've taken myself off the market!  I need to get my head straight before I start even thinking about considering the idea of pursuing a possible dating relationship with anyone!! Ack.  Well it's 12:35 am and I meant to be in bed an hour ago.  Damn this awful internet.   Good night fair blog reader!

						   Ugh . . . I can't believe how late I slept.  12:30!!  I must have been tired.  R said that I looked it.  Well I did go pretty much non stop this weekend.  With B down and all.  I enjoyed having him down but by Sunday I was ready for him to go.  That sounds mean.  Especially since I hadn't seen him in 3 months.  But I've just broken up with R and am still trying to adjust to that.  Though I know that the break up was a good thing.  It's still something one has to adjust too.  And I realized how much I missed R this weekend too.  Now that's something I feel bad about . . . B came down all this way and I'm missing R!  But anyway.  R and I are going to go see Stepford Wives on Thursday.  It's great to have him back . . . when we were dating things were just crazy.  I think like he said cause we saw too much of each other and one of us had to drive about 30 min if we wanted to see each other.  So this is good that we're just back to being friends.  No obligations.  Just a good ol' time.  Though we each miss the other.  Mmmm . . . but he did give me the best back rub yesterday.  My back is like a rock right now from working all the time.  Well working period.  Yesterday I thought my whole left side was going to detatch.  I'm getting new fabric . . . that's all sorts of pretty!!  I'm gonna make a fancy jacket or something with it.  Hopefully M will help me.  I'm staying up there for Bn and Kthrn's wedding.  I think I might try to catch up with Doc on that weekend and see if he would want to go grab a drink or something.  Nothing too late, cause I'd like to see R and M some on Friday too.  Then Saturday morning is the wedding.  Well afternoon cause it doesn't start till 11.  My lazy ass just doesn't want to get up at 7:30 to be on the road by 8:30 so I can ensure that I'll be there in time.  Plus the D's have offered there home to me.  "My old room" if you can call it that.  I stayed with them while I was in school and it truly has become a second home.  But I need to get my lazy ass in gear and go get dressed for the day.  Truly a lazy day.

						   Well I'm back in Fred Vegas for the week.&nbsp; I'm house-sitting.&nbsp; Oh how I miss this town.&nbsp; Especially since my new home town is how do you say *yawn* severly. R came over last night.&nbsp; I made him dinner and we hung out.&nbsp; He stayed over and left for work at 4 am.&nbsp; Yes, we're back together.&nbsp; I don't know for how long though.&nbsp; Things seem to be drifting again.&nbsp; And I'm getting anxious to get on with my life.&nbsp; Though I do enjoy being with him.&nbsp; It's just like he's taking me for granted again.&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; But we're going to Canada next weekend.&nbsp; I've got a re-enacting trip.&nbsp; I so can't wait.&nbsp; I'm quite excited.&nbsp; Not so much that R is coming, but that I'm going to Canada and I'm going out re-enacting again.&nbsp; I haven't done that in a long time.&nbsp;  *Sigh* I had a slight scare the earlier this week and for part of last week, but thankfully it wasn't true.&nbsp; But I'm going to have to do something so that the scare doesn't happen again.&nbsp; It stressed me out more than anything and R was wondering what was wrong with me, but I wasn't going to bring it up and it be a false alarm.&nbsp; Though the chances are slim, they're there.&nbsp; Ugh . . .  I'm tired.&nbsp; I worked a double today and I have to be up early tomorrow so that I can let Kt's house cleaner in.&nbsp; She's supposed to be here at 8:30.&nbsp; Ugh . . .  OH!&nbsp; OMG!&nbsp; Kt's nephew came to clean the gutters on Saturday . . . or maybe it was Sunday.&nbsp; But I saw him both days.&nbsp; He's hot.&nbsp; And I looked awful, both days.&nbsp; :(&nbsp; Not good. Okay.&nbsp; I'm off to bed.&nbsp; Good night sweet blog reader!

						   So unmotivated.  But I'm going to Bistro with R again tonight.  :)  Yea!  That should be fun.  I'm quite looking foward to it.  I need to do laundry and stuff today though.  So I need to get that done like now.  Instead of sitting on my ever growing butt in front of this computer and go do my laundry.  Oh man, I so could use a full body massage right now.  Actually a hot shower will probably do the trick too . . . I should probably do that, then go do laundry . . Yea sounds like a good idea.  :(  We may have to put S down.  She's developed diabetes.  We're going to hold a family meeting about that on Monday when we're all home. :(  Part of me is ready to say goodbye to her.  The other part says, but she's feeling better than she has in a long time, and looks better, why put her down.  I'm severly torn.  If we do put her down, that will be a sad day.  I hope they don't do it on a day I have to work. I'll be a wreck that whole day I'm afraid.    But, I guess R and I are back together.  Not that I'm upset about it.  I quite enjoy being with him.  I just haven't told my parents and don't plan on it.  Mom asked if we were back together and I told her no.  I'm sure R would have a hissy if he knew my parents thought we were still broken up.  But you know what?  He and I got along great before I told my parents.  Once I told them, we were always fighting and stuff.  But things are better, we still fight and argue.  That I think is cause our personality's are so close.  We both stuff things till they really get to us.  But, we're working it all out.  It'll be good.  Just have to tread lightly on each other's toes.  And me quit showing up late to everything and give him time and attention on weekends too.  Ugh . . . That was his latest complaint to me.  He feels second class, cause I don't spend time with him on the weekends.  But 2 weekends I was out till 4 am with other people.  He doesn't seem to understand that I was right there with those people then,  and I didn't have to travel very far to get to where we were going!  *Sigh*  Oh well.  One day we'll understand each other.  If we don't kill each other first!!  But anyway.   I'm off to do laundry.   Have a good one fair blog reader!

						   Canada was awesome!!  OH my god I've never seen so many beautiful guys in one place at one time in my life.  It's true.  The French are a beautiful group of people.  *Sigh*  I wanted to take one home with me.  But I couldn't find any takers.  And I think the 'rents wouldn't have been to thrilled with it.  Mom actually asked me if I'd found anyone while I was up there.  I told her everywhere I turned there was someone.  One guy in particular stuck out in my mind.  He did the presentation at the diorama.  *sigh*  I saw him and thought he was good looking, then he came up to me (I was dressed in my 18th cent. outfit and he was in what I'm assuming the French military would have worn in the 18th cent.) and said that he would give his life for beautiful women like me.  At that point you could have mopped me off the floor.  I almost melted.  R didn't come with me.  We've broken up.  For good this time.  We broke up the weekend before.  He pissed me off so bad that he made me cry and everytime after I saw him I cried, I couldn't deal with it anymore.  And it was all sex.  That's all the relationship was anymore.  Not a good thing.  When we talked on Sunday or was it Saturday, well anyway.  We decided it was best if we not get back together.  It went suprisingly well.  I wrote down all my complaints against him, he read them and some he agreed on.  Things are better between us.  He misses me and though I'll never admit it to him, I miss him something awful too.  I think it's so hard because we fit together so well.  We had similar personalities and were in similar places in life.  *Sigh*  But there will be someone better for me down the road.  I just need to move on.  Which is what I'm doing.  Oh, I lost my job on Wednesday.  I am now unemployed.  YIKES!  R was bitching at me last night about his job.  I had to bite my tongue not to remind him that I didn't even have a job.  I don't know.  He's high maintenance.  But he also had a bug up his butt last night.  Sounded like he had one this morning too.  Oh well.  I'm gonna go.  Should go to the library and see what i can find in yesterdays paper.
