       Hello Everyone!  I'm not going to write about Friday, due to the fact that nothing exciting happened and I wouldn't want to bore you to death with details that are not really relevant to that day!  Anywayz thank God its the weekend! I know that this week is going to be a blast and it is my half term which means that I don't need to go to school for a week!  I have a lot lined up to do in the half term, but I will keep you posted about that later on!  Bye!  Stefan

       Hello Everyone!  Today I have added a Guestbook to my blog, however as I do not like the gigantic ads that accompany the guestbook, in the upcoming weeks I will try and find a guestbook which has either smaller or no ads.  If you know any sites that have guestbooks with no ads then feel free to tell me!  Bye!  Stefan

       Hello Everyone!  This is just a quick note to say that I have added the Tag Board to my blog!  At this moment in time the colours are not entirely 'correct' as they don't match the template of my blog, but this will soon change!  All I need to do now is add a guestbook and maybe a statistics counter!  Bye Bye!  Stefan

       Hello All!  My day today I would have to say was quite unusual! I will explain more later on in the blog!  I went to school today (As always) and was suprised to gain insight that I was nominated for an achievers break! This is where 20 people from the year get nomiated to go to the have a 'snack' of dougnuts and biscuits accompanied with drinks to celebrate your achievements in a particular area of school. This time it was because of our yearly reports and how well we did in them!  Anwayz the most unusual part of the day is yet to come. Third lesson was English and at this moment in time I HATE English. What I am about to write involves a teacher and our class but I will refrain from naming the teacher for obvious reasons! As me and my mate were at the achievers break we came into lesson late. We both sat down and listened to the teacher who was rambling on about how our work was not up to standard (As the week before we had a cover teacher because our teacher was at this ceremony thing to say goodbye to the year 11's). Anywayz as that day last week was 'special' because the year 11's were leaving we got out of lesson 15 minutes early! As the lesson started late we did not have enough time to do all the work (Which involved copying a whole page from the OHP as well as doing 8 detailed questions - which in my opinion is impossible!) Anyway back to the point after she lectured us about our work (As we are the 'top-set' and could do better) I stood up to our evil teacher and told her that we only had 45 mins to do the work and that it wasn't really our fault. Other people backed me and I felt good that we all united together to stand in what we fought for!  This is not really the unusual bit, but what I am going to write next is! The teacher started to argue with us and then snapped. She started to really get hyped up and told us she was leaving as she had had enough of our school! She then picked on this boy (Who will not be named) and started to say that the reason why she was leaving was because of people like him. She then went on to say stuff to make her sound 'big headed' like "This school will miss me and my expertise" and other crap like that. She started to get really 'hyped' up that she nearly began to cry! To cut a long story short she send this boy (That she always picks on) out of the room and we all started to protest! He hadn't done anything wrong but express his feelings, but by her account he HAD done something wrong.  The thing which I found unusual was what she did next. As quick as a flash she acted like nothing happened and started to teach the lesson 'normal'. I hate people that are like that who have split personalities and also people that pick on other people. It's just not fair! In my personal opinion I am glad that she is leaving tomorrow and can't wait for our new teacher :)  Anywayz I will post more later on tonight!  Bye!  Stefan

       Hi All!  This is just a quick note to say that it did not take me long to upload my photo to the server, so its now here!  If you click on 'View My Complete Profile' then you can see it!  The photo was taken a couple of years ago on a ski trip to Italy with my school.  The photo looks better as it was originally, however I decided that as this blog is about me, the photo will only be of me too!  I am not good at cropping so it looks a bid dodgey!  UPDATE: I no longer have red in my fringe! I have grown out of that stage of my life lol!  I will try and get a better picture one day. I just don't know when that one day will be!  Bye!  Stefan

       Hey All!  If you didn't know by now I am a HUGE telly addict and I can't believe that the last ever 'Friends' is on this Friday in the U.K!  I dont really want 'Friends' to end, but like the saying goes 'All good things must come to an end!'.  Nevermind...... maybe I will be able to compensate by watching Big Brother which starts straight after the ever last 'Friends' (On C4)  C Ya!  Stefan

       If I had to describe today in one word it would have to be...... boring!  This morning I woke up and felt a huge sigh of relief as on Monday and Tuesday I had some exams at school and this morning felt like a huge weight had been taken off my shoulder!  School was pretty boring today. We had an extended tutorial first lesson (Where we did a lot of stuff about our 'Yearly Reports') and that was quite boring, while second lesson we had to sit in silence and write essays (Which lesson am I talking about? English of course!). Third lesson was quite boring as it was science; my least favourite lesson. I went home for lunch and had time to 'chill' then I went back to skewl for my fave lesson I.C.T!  After having two hours of I.C.T I went home and began creating this blog! Not a lot has really gone on today - what a suprise, but I hope that tomorrow will be more exciting.  I have nothing planned tonight. I might go out but I doubt it as I have a lot of homework to do, but I keep putting it off as half term is next week! I dont really have anything planned next week. I might go to the movies and see the new Harry Potter movie if I can be asked too. I will talk more about it when the time comes!  If you want to know anything more about my 'exciting' day then go ahead and ask. I doubt you want to hear any more of my 'exciting' day lol so I am going to sign off now!  C Ya!  Stefan

       Yesterday was such a great day. I actually got to go to the cinemas to watch the much anticipated 'Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban'.  It was amazing! We (my mum, my brother and myself) arrived at the cinemas an hour early to just go and get some good seats. All the waiting I feel was worth it as we were the first ones in the cinema and got to chose some really great seats! It was unbelieable! It lasted 2 hours and 15 mins long but time just flew by!  The movie was just amazing. I wont go into too much detail as I dont want to ruin it for all of you out there that are going to see it. The special effects are absolutely incredible. The way in which the cast have 'grown up' within a space of a year is amazing, while the actual Dementors that are in the movie have been portrayed just as J.K.Rowling described them - scary, evil beings!  I feel that the movie did live up to the book and in some areas was better than the book itself. I really enjoyed the film so much and give it 11/10! My favourite section of the movie would have to be Hermione and Harry using the 'timeturner' to turn back time. The way in which the movie portrays this part of the movie is fascinating as the audience get to know some 'hidden' secrets which does not make sense at the beginning of the film!  All in all this film was fab and I can't wait for the fourth one to come out! Im not going to say anymore about the movie as it would ruin it for everyone else!  Im going to keep you all posted about Wednesday later on!  Bye!  Stefan

       Yesterday was Monday..... the start of the week. I usually hate Mondays because its the start of the week where a routine begins with school and all, but this Monday was different as I am off school for a week!  Not a lot happened really on Monday. I mean if you call 'going out' for a couple of hours something 'special' then I must admit that I did do something special, but in my eyes I didn't do a thing yesterday and was basically lazy :P  Yesterday was quite cool actually as I got to just 'chill' all day and did not have to bother with all things relating to school, but I must admit that I did do some coursework yesterday as these things don't just write by themselves you know! :)  All in all I suppose yesterday was an 'okay' day. Today I doubt that I will do anything special. I might go out with my mates but I doubt it as I am not in the mood to do so. Tomorrow I am going to see the new Harry Potter movie at the cinemas. I'll keep you posted with that!  Bye!  Stefan  P.S I will write about today (Tuesday) if I have anything exciting to tell!
