      Ok, so it seems that I am getting some shit from some angry family.  First and foremost, I am not still fucking my ex.  Secondly, I am not going to console anyone from that family when shit gets rough.  Ok with that said, let me say some more.  Yeah I am a bit spirtual, in more ways then one.  Some would like to call it witch craft, some call it a fucking religion.  A legal religion.  I am not a crazy fucking witch, I am a Jewish woman who is interested in a lot of other avenues of sprituality.  Get over it and broaded your minds.  I go to church/temple and pray too.  I loved Anthony and I never did anything to hurt him.  As a matter of fact when I worked for Guess, I would bring home tons of clothes for him and his little brother.  I always wanted to make sure that they had nice things and had a healthy relationship with their uncle.  I was the one that pushed for Mike to have Anthony over and spend time with him, being a male figure in his life other then his grandfather.  I may not have got along with Michelle, Mike's sister, but I always said that she was a wonderful mother to her children and I wish that we could have been on better terms.  Nothing that I would have ever admitted to her, but I always spoke with Jenny, Mike's other sister, about it.  I never asked for credit, I neve apologized for my actions and I never kissed ass.  I hear the Jenny is pregnant, I feel happy for her.  Should I be happy?  I hope that she is happy.    What I did in September of 2003 when Mike beat me and threw me out of the house half undressed was deserved.  It is great that his family was there for him but how can Michelle point a finger at me and say in the same sentance that she was beat by him too.  She knows what he is about, he never changed in life.  He just took out his agression on me then, not them.  He was arrested for beating his girlfriend.  Mike has problems.  I had problems when I was with him.  I own that part of my life.  I am getting better with help from a Domestic Violence counselor who is teaching me things about being in an unhealthy relationship for the last 3 years.  Do not fault me for making mistakes.  All I ever did was love him to the best of my ability.  I hear that Mike is on a lot of drugs now, perhaps it is not the best time for him to be acting as an uncle.  He means well though and loves the shit out of that kid.  I loved the shit out of that kid.  Everyone loves the shit out of that kid.  Except his dad.  That is reality, but people need to not speak that to the 8 year old child.  Love him, treat him well and protect him for the harsh reality of his life.  At least while he is young, he should be allowed to be young and innocent.  Not subjected to anger and drug dilluted minds.  About the hooker shit, the cunt shit and the crazy psycho shit.....that is more mud slinging and I will not dignify peoples angry, violent rants with a response.  Get on with your life and stop including me in this ugly melting pot of anger within your entire family.  I hated being involved then and I hate it now.

      I was not in the right frame of mind.....I was tired and delirious.  I can not figure out what the fuck is happening with my comments or how to delete that paqthetic post, but the comments are not showing and the post is fucking stuck.  Ugh, I will have to get some help with that.  Any offers.  Hey my counter is working though.  Keep'm coming!  Hollywood has this feel that is unreal.  Anchorman premiere was off the hook.  Hollywood Highland has some fucked up baking contest going down as we speak and I ate the best cannoli in the world.  Thankful to be home with my girl.  Oh yeah, I have the most awesome female roomie in the world, just got the keys to the new place 5 minutes ago.  May the world be as blessed as I am to have the inside scoop on what the fuck is going down, where it is going down and someone to get down with!  I love LA!

      Stop, Drop and Roll does not work in Hell.  Don't try to put yourself out, do not try to wash away your sins and be ok with the idea that you are living in hell.  Once you can accomplish this, you can be as happy as me!

      So I used to have this trunk filled with sex toys.  It had other things like a pair of leather bondage cuffs given to me as a gift and all of my massage oil.  Shit that basically belonged to me before I ever met him.  This is another thing that was not given back to me when I moved from my last house.  Turns out, the person who lives there still uses them on new girls in his life.  Hello?  What sort of nasty bitch lets a guy use already used toys on them?  I guess the kinda girl he can get now is just some skanky nasty bitch who will most likely pass along a disease.  Used toys?  Fucking DIRTY DIRTY DIRTY.  We always made the deal that if we did not work out, I would retain the toys.  Who else would want to use them right?  Well looks like he knows a few.  SICK fucking people! Makes me want to throw up....

      So.....I have started the replacement hunt for things to replace what I was not given back when I moved out of my old house.  I have come up on the following:  A new bed (even though I had my old mattress it is always good to get a new one to rid the old negative energy in your life) A new bed frame (It is sick, a solid mahogany platform bed for Cal King mattress) All new bedding (1000 count, I splurged) 2 new down pillows  Well it is a start and I am happy that I do not have to worry about that shit anymore.

      I found a house.....hallah fucking lougha.  I am officially moving in on July 1st, I will have my baby back and I will be in a house.  Damn right!  Now the only thing I have to think about is what color I will be painting the rooms.    There is so much that I will have to replace since I seem to not have certain things anymore that I bought.  I was thinking about this and so far I came up with this list....  I am missing the following:  Cordless phones Stereo Surround sound/DVD player system Curtains Sheets/Bedding Ralph Lauren Towels Down pillows All of my candles Some of my movies Frames recently purchased for my pics Wine glasses Shot glasses Cooking Pyrex My bongs (I would have liked to pass them on to people that I know)  Fuck a thief, people need to learn how to give back what is not theirs.  No matter what they think, it will always be mine and when they look at it, I can only imagine that they will think of me.  I suppose that is satisfaction enough for me.

      Never trust a drug addict....  Drug addicts lie, cheat and steal.....so I hear.  I heard the most amazing quote today, "It is like putting a band-aid over a wound that has already bled dry"  That sounds like my life.  I have been bled dry.  I am new life, I am a healing wound, I am new beginnings....I am reinvented.  I always said that once I lost the person most close to me that I would die.  That is exactly what happened.  I died in February only to be reborn and see clearer in the most beautiful of ways.  I do not know why I speak of her tonight, but I cried while thinking of her.  She was my mentor, the person I turned to when I needed guidance, when I needed a friend.  I could really use her friendship right now, her words of wisdom to comfort my heart.  I long to hear her voice again, only to know that I never will.  I have but a memory of that sound, a memory of knowing her and knowing exactly what she would want me to hear. My ears ring with that knowledge, my heart beats with her love and my body feels her presence.    I ache today, I feel alone though I am not.  I feel no comfort for my heart is not rested.  I feel like I am on a path, moving fast through life, moving forward and upward, positively....and she is not her to share it with me.  My heart is lonely......for my best friend is gone......

      There are things that I love about LA and things that I love about San Diego.  The hunt to find a place to live has faired well and I am tired.  I will be here in the city for a while longer tending to some personal issues, which I gladly obligated myself.    I have been a picture taken fool, yo!  I just forgot my computer cable to download them.  What the hell is wrong with me?  What I need to do is get pictures of my dog.  He at the moment is on a ranch until I can find a permanent place to live.  I asked to have some pictures that I had to be sent to me but they never did.  Oh well, it wasn't like I could count on it getting done anyway.  In the meantime, here is something that looks like him....     and something that looks like the other dog in my life that I miss terribly.....Oh wait that is her

      Band of Brothers is the fucking shit.       I love war anything.  I am a sadistic bitch who loves to watch gory, bloody war movies.  Something about killing the enemy that practically puts me on the verge of getting off.  Other honorable mentions.....   Braveheart  Gladiator (a man and a tiger....mmmmmmm) Saving Private fucking Ryan   I just came up on the Jay Z, Grey Album this week.  Something very eerie, I tell ya,  about hearing the Beatles behind a rapper.      Thanks baby for the CD, I will see you this weekend.

      Back pain is a bitch.  Neck pain is a bitch.  I went to see a doctor about my neck and they say that I will have to have it operated on within the next 6 months.  I have 2 hurneated disks pushing forward.  It will have to be an incision from the front instead of the back.  Ugh!  I have always been apprehensive about having anyone cut open my neck but this doctor seems to have a good way about him, so I suppose that I can trust he will do a good job.    My body aches like a 50 year old woman.  Does anyone see something wrong with this?  I do....

      Yeah you know who you are......  There is no need to sling mud, I am tired of doing that with you.  I will not participate nor will I discuss it further.  Why do people feel the need to take things personally?  I mean, I have learned that I do not have that much power to consume another.  If they are consumed, then it is within themselves.  Something that I can not control.  I have had to let go of a lot in my life, most recently a large part of my life that I thought was unique and special.  It was a part of my life that I cherished and neglected, a part that I valued and took for granted, a part that I had to walk away from due to my own pride and destructive actions.  I can not go back in time and change those events that forced me to let go, but I can move forward and better myself everyday so that I do not repeat those patterns again.  In the end, I own my actions, I own my choices, I own my life.  Now if only other people would stop pointing the finger and own what is there's.

        The last 3 months have been interesting to say the least.  Today is my 90th day being sober and to think that I came from smoking pot everyday, all day for the last 10 years.  Now, I do not even crave the shit to say the least.  My ex kept all my bongs when I left.  I was in this place for a couple of months where I felt like the most normal out of the bunch. Now you must know that this place was a million dollar home on the hill over looking the San Diego bay and it cost about $7,500 to $10,000 a month to stay there depending on what you are looking to achieve. It was fun, I was in a girl's house with 6 other girls by the time I left and the boy's house was a block away in walking distance.  When I first got there I was alone in this 7 bedroom house.  My first roommate came after a week and she was a crack addict, a wealthy crack addict.  Within 3 days of being there I woke up to her and some guy smoking crack in my room.  She left the next day, forced out by management.  My next roommate was cooler then fuck but I think that we did not like each other at first.  Once all that noise died down, she and I would sneak out of the house at night and go to the boy's house and swim naked.  We were trouble from the start. The other girls were fun and we partied all over San Diego together.  We rented limos, talked about men and women, went to strip clubs and snuck out to go to the bar and laugh at the drunk people.    One night one of the guys asked another if he could borrow his car to go to JBX.  He never came back.  About 3 days later I was able to locate him and retrieve the car and him.  He was smoking crack and shooting heroin in a cheap drug hotel.  The same guy had made a run over the border but two weeks earlier and pawned his wedding ring for money to buy drugs in Mexico.  This guy has more money then he knew what to do with and this is how he lived his life.  Anyway the experience made me realize that I never wanted to smoke crack.   I am convinced that Real World: Rehab would be an incredible idea to pitch to the Bumim Murray group.  Fucking drama!

      I woke up this morning and got laid, in addition to that, when we went to bed last night I got laid.  Fuck it, I have been getting laid for the last 48 hours with the exception of the Laker game, where we got busy at half time.  It was sooo fucking good.  When I say good, I mean it was fucking great.  Great like when you are screaming the persons name and your legs will not stop shaking, you are sweating and sticking together, rolling around all over the place and you break the bed frame.  When you know the persons body and they know yours and no matter what they go right to that place that always feels amazing and you get off every time.  Yeah, it was that good!  I have not had sex like this in about 3 years.  I thought for sure that I would never have sex as good as that but the truth is, it was way better then it ever was.  To think I forgot how good sex could be in the chaotic mess I was in called a relationship.  To think I faked it as long as I did makes me sick.  Never again....

      I have had a wonderful weekend.  I watched one of my closest friends get married and catch up with her daughter....priceless!  I am heading into Malibu in an hour or so and going to watch that band play.  Whoa, I feel like a VIP again.    So the wedding.....it was a surprise for most of the guests.  When it was officially announced, there was a gasp that was heard throughout the house.  I love that.  People thought that they were here for her 40th birthday party and there was only but a select few that knew the real deal.  I was one of the select few.  It was beautiful and I cried lie a baby.....yeah so fucking what, I cry at weddings.  There was a ceremony especially for the stepfather and her daughter.  I think that is what moved me the most.  Knowing that she will finally have a father that will treat her wonderfully makes me terribly happy.    Fuck I am tired.... slept too late.... off to take a shower and hit the road..... pictures later....  Oh, I have decided that I will be holding out for a love like Nancy & Ronald Reagan.....It is final, I never want to have anything less then an undying love where my man will be quoted saying that the only time he ever feels lonely, even in a crowd of people, is when I leave the room....now that is fucking love, baby!

         So I get this shit all of the time.  Do you know who you look like?  YES, I know who I look like. If you think that you are the first fucking person to ask me this or point this out then you are a fucking idiot....So STOP!  Truth is that I never meant to look like her.  I did not even know who she was initially.  I started with a short bob and was sort of wanting that edgy Uma Thurman thing from Pulp Fiction.  The hair grew...and this is what happened.....  Whoopty Fucking Doo  I am actually a natural blonde.  Yes blonde.  I have been dying my hair dark now for years.  I am smart, exceptionally smart.  Smart enough to know that the Lakers are fucking overpaid lazy fuckers without any real talent right now.  What the hell? They are playing like a bunch of Junior High lackeys.  Good luck to them.....

      This is my first post and it is going to suck cause my topic is not that interesting for the most part....but hell it needs to be said!  So today I may have made a mistake...I am sorry for that mistake!    I have decided that this is the place that I will say nothing but nice things about the ex.  A place where I can rant about him, rant about the shit in my head, talk about all of the Hollywood bullshit I put up with and the mess I love to call my life!    So here it goes, I love him....I love him so much it hurts to think of him with other women and I am sure that it is hurting him to think that I have been with other men.  We are moving on, I suppose that is what you can call it.  He still thinks that I am crazy....yeah I am still crazy, crazy in love with him.  Other then that, I have my old mood swings, from the all the pot I used to smoke, under control.  I want him to notice but I am not sure that he ever will.  It is sad really.  If I could take back all that I have done that has hurt him and start over I would.  I can not say that I would do that with anything else in my life.  I would change everything, I would do it all over a different way!  I love you,  urlLink Viking .... Mike.....I want you back but I know that I may never get that chance.  I am sorry for how much I may have hurt you over the course of the last 2 1/2 years and I want you to know that I will always have this special place in my heart for you and I hope that you can find in yours, a place for me!

      Shopping up a storm in NY.  I decided to drop a couple hundred on this guy I have been seeing back in LA.  He deserves it.  Come on now people, I may hate on my ex, but I am good to the new ones.  Mike was a new one once and he got it good.  Just ask him what he was doing on this day last year and the year before.....memories!  So it seems that people think that I bash my ex all too much....ok point taken.  I thought it over and I know that I am better then that.  Oh and in response to you, you know who you are right, I do own my own responsibility in life.  I am to blame, no more or less then the other party involved.  Show some respect though, cause no matter what I always liked and respected you and I thought that you did the same.  I take back the name calling, childish of me.  Additionally, it is not personal between you and me, so if I take an interest in what you write it is only because I enjoy your commentary.  Pure entertainment with a flare for expression.  As much as I am wanting to bite my tongue on this one, I feel better knowing I am doing the right thing by saying it.  It takes a lot of personal pride swallowing for me to want to acknowledge you today but I thought that my karma could use a boost and that the honesty of my thoughts would warm your heart on your day.....  Happy Birthday, Mike.  I hope that you have a terrific year and that you do not forget those that we shared together on this day.  You are in my thoughts in the best of ways and I wish you the best of luck for the 32nd year of your life.  I will always love you in our own special little way! The way only we could understand...kisses baby!      On this day a bit of history...  1890 - Artist Vincent van Gogh died in Auvers, France, at age 37, two days after he blasted himself in the chest with a revolver. The brilliant artist had exhibited signs of epilepsy and schizophrenia, for which there was little treatment at the time, and unable to handle his depressions and hallucinations any longer, committed suicide. The Dutch painter created more than 1,600 paintings and drawings in only ten years, of which Starry Night was one of his most important works.   Van Gogh's final words were, "There is no end to sorrow".

      been sittin in bed all day not wanting to get out.  I finally mustered up enough energy to get in the shower and get dressed.  I think that we will be hitting the Marquee tonight where Noah will have a table and Crystal waiting for us.    I was thinking that the time that I have been here I have had more fun in life then I have had ever living in LA.  One week here hanging out with a bunch of men I barely know has been more fullfilling then with a man I spent years with.  I had one guy drop more money on me in one night then my last ex did in 3 years!  PFFT.....  Not that the money is all that important but hey it just goes to show you what you can have in comparasion.  Considering my ex used to tell me that he was the best I could get......an even bigger "PFFFFFFT"

      Much has happened here in the city and I will be staying another week. Wooo weee....  Today it started pouring rain and the cab situation was a little scarce to say the least.  We were outside the Waldorf trying to hail a cab when this little business man in a suit came up and started to block us out of getting a cab.  He had no umbrella and looked like he could use some cover much more then we, but I still shook my wet umbrella all over his pushy ass and he didn't say shit as he walked away soaked.  All of a sudden this towncar drives up and passes us.  He suddenly puts his car in reverse and parks it right in front of us.  He rolls the window down and asks us where we were going.  We let him know where we wanted to go and he says "get in".  Immediately upon getting in he looks at us and says "Are you Russian"  Sabrina giggles and replies yes.  I do not even bother to admit my part in this as the driver is so fixated on how Sabrina looks Russian. He had Russian trinkets all over the car and begun to speak in Russian as though we would understand.  He proceeds to put a Russian DVD on the TV where it is the last 2 minutes of KILLING.  Russian KILLING.  Then if that was not enough, he rewinds it to see it again. As we get to our destination, he insists that we go to this nice russian restaurant.  When we say that we would rather eat at the location he was dropping us off at he freaked!  Turns out he hunts Russians on the street for limo service.  The only time I have ever been thankful to be Russian and ungrateful all at the same time......

      The Viking people....lets talk about the Viking.  He loves to beat women.  He beat me, he beat up his sisters and smaked around some other girlfriends in his life.  He is a total fucking sadistic pig who loves to hurt smaller people.  He is way too insecure in his own head to not try and cut down the people he feels are little to him.  I think that he feels like a bigger man even though he is teenie weenie.  You can say what you want Mike, just make sure to say it proud.  I don't feel one bit ashamed of my life now.  Without you it is glorious and peaceful.  You are a hateful person without any sense of reality.  Anyone out there want to know the real deal about the Viking....like pictures of what he has done to my body or a police report that I wrote about the few incidents.....just hit me up.  I will forward whatever you like.  Oh, and if you want the real story about what I did to him, well here it goes.  He woke up in the morning accusing me of sleeping with Anti, his cousin, cause he found a spot on the bed.  Caused by him, the Viking that is.  I would never fuck a slob like Anti!  He pushed me around yelled at me and grabbed me by my arms and then shoved me in a chair.  I snapped. He decided to video tape the latter part of the incident.  That of me with a knife and a stick in my hand ready to kill his ass if he came near me.  He lunged at me and he got smaked with a stick.  When you get beat up by a man that you think you love, or you think that loves you eventually it wears on you and you snap.  Compile that with a little bit of the fact that he was totally insensitive to the fact that my grandmother, who raised me, had just died and I was in mourning still.  Kept saying something to the effect of, "get over it, you are pathetic".  I told him that if he ever laid his hands on me again, I would kill him.  That is exactly what was going to happen.  If you ever get a chance to see the tape, look out for the part where Mike is screaming for his life like a little bitch.....it is something like "No No, don't kill me, please Courtney don't kill me"  Oh yeah, hey dumb fucks....you banned me from a NY hotel computer.....please, it is not like I would ever comment on my own at home.  Remember Mike, I am in hiding from you because you are dangerous and a threat to my safety.  You can never know where I live or much more then what I have been up to in my daily life by reading my blog.  You know that......Grow up little boys!

      do you call and reach out? This can be a touchy topic for me. I prefer not to call but at some point the thought crosses my mind. A couple of nights ago I think that I had a really touching conversation with someone that drew me to conclude that if you love someone set them free. Fuck the return shit. I have set them free. It was suggested that one day I may be able to return to being friends. I shook my head no and went about the rest of my night.

      The pigeons in NY are like wise guys.  They are not afraid of shit.  I swear I have moved out of the way for a pigeon more times then I ever thought I should.  Now it is revenge time.  The next pigeon that gets in my fucking way will get a swift kick back down Park Avenue.  It is like they tell you, "Eh, I am walkin here"  hehe     Looks like I got a job in NY.  I can not believe that I will be moving here.  I have to find an apartment and get my shit in order back in LA but the job is secure.  It will be a month or so before the company is ready for me, but I am all over it.  I do not miss LA at all.  I think that I will be staying a couple of extra days and meeting up with Noah Tuesday or Wednesday.  Noah being one of the most sought out after people in all of NY.  He took care of me last night and told me to make it down to the Marquee on Tuesday.  He will have a table and a bottle of Crystal waiting for me.  Love to that man!  Well, all is well here on the east coast, it stopped raining and the people are the shit.  I love this city and I will be anticipating my return so very soon!

      It is raining in NY City.  Does that mean that I will stop having fun.....hell no.  My old, old girlfriend is meeting me out here on Sunday and will be hitting the town at night.  I have actually been blowing time in my hotel room until it is time to go out.  Where?  I am not sure yet!

      I met a group of guys tonight and went off with them.  The men in Ny are gentlemen to say the least.  I like that fact that they open doors for you and say excuse me, treat women like ladies and do not have that attitude that LA men have.  Actually I like it here so much that I will be looking for a job on Monday with the hopes that I may be moving here soon enough.  Lets see.....I suppose I will talk about Joe tonight.  He was not my first flirting experience here in NY but he was the first one that I brought back to my hotel to hang out.  We ditched the rest of the men and took a cab back to the hotel and got busy like it was nobody's business.  I didn't sleep with him, though I could have.  Actually our clothes stayed on and I sent him off begging for more.  He was a total turn on, the kind that you would never have to instruct.  He was a biter, a spanker and a hair puller.  Fuck me, I love that in a man.  He got my number and plans on using it real soon.  Quote unquote!  He was fucking hot.  Actually most of the men on this end of Manhattan are hot and rich.  Interesting crowd.  My kind of crowd.  I don't pay for shit, I get comped no matter where I go and the men love women from LA.  I think that our faces look nicer and less jaded then those from NY.  More later.  I am awaiting a pic taken of my girl and me in a cab.  The cabbie has a website too and will be posting it soon enough.  In the meantime I think that I am just going to buy a USB cable for my camera today as I am feeling a bit too impatient to wait until I get home to retrieve mine.  The pics are too much for me to hold out.

      Turns out, I have a computer in my hotel....which is off Park Avenue and W. 50th...kuddos to me.....Only the best places for the best person!  I expect that I deserve nothing less then this loveliness......moving on to my next thought....  The New York Yankees love chicks from California.  Their sports agents too.  So with that said, let me tell you last night was off the hook.  Immediatly comped through the door and a bottle awaiting us at the table.  I was here for a total of like 3 hours and we we already being invited to hang with some serious sports people.  Did we pass it up, hell yeah.  We danced with them for a couple of hours before we ditched that crowd.  Why hang with those people when I really know what the hell they are about.  They even showed the MLB card.  Who the fuck cares, showing me that shit just makes me hate you even more....They are way beter when used and shown the treatment on our end.  Thanks Mike!  Heads up though, they do love us ladies, but the also love them some Jason Jones.  They say hello to him and brag about what a fucking amazing person he is.  So all the stories are true and I even got to hear about the chick and the cigarette story all over again.  I finished that story which made them love me all the more for knowing him and about him.  He seems to be pretty popular and they send their love his way.    Tonight, I will be taking Manhatten by storm.  Invited to a party by an old friend that lives here now and I plan on starting this evening off the right way.   Ohhh....Actually, I started this trip off the right way from the start...I was fortunate enough to be sitting next to a new artist whos album drops on Tuesday.  He invited me to the MTV Beach House tomorrow for some fun in the sun and to meet some of his friends.  He is there performing his new release.  I just heard it for the first time on the radio a week and a half ago.  His name is Kevin.....the song, Turn Me On.  Turn me on, Turn me on....  I have to say that initially I was disappointed to be sitting next to him for obvious reasons, but hearing his whole album and talking with him on a 5 hour flight kept me quite entertained.  I like that!

      In about 12 hours I am getting on a plane and going on vacation.  I am so fucking excited to hit a state that I have never visited.  I will be gone for a week and audio blogging the hell out of my shit.  I plan on meeting up with some old friends and relaxing east coast style.     I will take lots of pictures and hopefully by the time I return, I will have retrieved my USB cable to download them.  Those and a few other special pics I have taken in the last month....

      Is being sober that great?  I think it has its moments.  I would rather be here in my life then be where my ex is in his.  He does drugs everyday and he is failing in life.  He would rather point the finger at someone about their faults then look at his own.  He should worry though, cause I have the balls in my hand.  His to be exact.  Bring it on MIKE.  I will show you just how much you do not want to fuck with me.....I can't wait.

      Since when did Hollywood turn ugly.  People are flat out ugly now.  The women are mediocre to say the least, the men are pathetic and the service was lousy.  Additionally half of Sunset Boulevard is closed down.  It was just no fun tonight.  Some dude came into my house tonight and smacked my dog.  I lost my mind.  It reminded me of how my ex used to beat my innocent little dog.  My lovely pup has mellowed out now thanks to being away from that monster of a man I called my boyfriend once.  He does not deserve to be hit especially from some fucking loser man.  He left very angry to say the least.  I think he refered to me as a cunt on his way out.  Oh well, I think I can handle that.  In the old days I would have hit him back or thrown his drink all over him.  Now, I can be kinder as I throw someone out of my home without being a violent or beligerant person.    My ex used to beat my dog for every little thing.  Actually someone who gave testimony in my court case mentioned that she had seen him beat the dog and that it made her scared of him.  Funny, he would beat the dog in front of people, but when he beat me he would do it when we were alone.  Coward!

      I think that sex is great.&nbsp; There is not much that I have not done in my life......I am not into beastiality or bleeding/cutting.....but I have bled to say the least.&nbsp; I was thinking last night about all the times my ex would let me stick dildos in his ass.&nbsp; He would ask me to do it after the first time I talked him into it.&nbsp; I think that he enjoyed it, which brings me to my next thought.&nbsp; With all that time in prison, do you think that he enjoyed the dildos cause he got fucked like a bitch?&nbsp;  &nbsp; Quite the thought, I do say that it is a possibility.&nbsp; I mean he hates black people with a passion, ask his sisters.&nbsp; They date black men and all that comes out of his mouth is "Ni**er this and N**er that".&nbsp; Do you think that a black man had his way with him.&nbsp; He could take the bigger dildos in his ass.&nbsp;

      say this.....FUCK YOU BITCH!  &nbsp;  Now I can say what is on my mind.&nbsp; What is really on my mind.&nbsp; So here it goes...  &nbsp;      FUCK YOU YOU LITTLE BITCH.&nbsp; You don't have shit now.&nbsp; Nothing on me.&nbsp; Your little video, is nothing more then a memory, your lasting memory of me,&nbsp;wrapped up in a home video style shoot.&nbsp; I still have the police report,&nbsp;a written report, an arrest, and physical evidence that you are a batterer.&nbsp; You will always carry that with you until the next time you beat a girlfriend, your family, or some random individual.&nbsp; I can not wait for that day so I can be a witness in any case brought against you for battery or Domestic Violence.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  There was this time when I loved you, but I can not say that I feel that for you anymore.&nbsp; You mean nothing to me.&nbsp; NOTHING.&nbsp; You are an annoyance, a glitch in my past, a rotton person who will get his with the help of karma.&nbsp; I hate you, and that hate may one day subside, but for now, I can not forgive you for being such a lousy, unlovable, abusive, whining, lacky!&nbsp; You will never be the best at anything when it comes to me.&nbsp; Not even the best boyfriend or the best at being the worst.&nbsp; You are just pathetic at all you try.&nbsp; You were a pathetic boyfriend and lover (in the end).&nbsp; Send your references my way, I will let them know what a lacky in bed you are too soon to become!&nbsp; You are a pathetic son, brother, cousin, friend, boyfriend, and person in general!  &nbsp;  While we are on the topic of discussion, let me entertain the masses.&nbsp; I dated this guy, we picked up this chick on the corner of Hollywood and Highland.&nbsp; She was here for a convention, 17 years old at the time.&nbsp; My ex, whos name we will not say, but you all know who right.....well he fucked her.&nbsp; He is a statutory rapist, then he photograhed her naked, drunk and high on numerous drugs.&nbsp; He still has the pictures and his favorite thing to do is to show people.&nbsp; She iss a whore anyway, a whore&nbsp;who he thought would be a good idea to pimp out while she lived with us.&nbsp; She thinks he is her friend and he of her.&nbsp; She told everyone that he raped her and that he was a drug dealer piece of shit.&nbsp; He told everyone that she was loose and showed naked pictures of her to everyone that would look.&nbsp; Great pair.&nbsp; He is a drug dealer/user piece of shit and she is still just a junkie whore.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Get a fucking life the two of you.&nbsp; Stop trying to drag normal people into your drama.&nbsp; Get the fuck out of my life and stay the fuck out.&nbsp;

      Life is great, people are great.  I am winning in the game of life.  I am losing a little at some other shit, but oh well I take life with the punches it throws at me.  The new house is great, I love my roomate.  I can not say that about any other roomate I have ever had.  It is great knowing that people have your back.  It is great to know that there is a trust you can count on with your friends and family.    On another note, my dog is feeling sick.  He will not stop shitting.  I am getting a little worried.  I have to pick up all of the shit now.

      There was this night that I went to this local bar.  Now I have nothing on the whole gay and lesbian community, but fuck this place took the cake.  I was driving today and I drove by the Oxwood Inn and it brought back some memories.  I went there one night with this dude I was dating.  We thought that it would be a little hipper then it was.  There was one thing that I remember so well and it was the tranny.  His teeth.  Geez, it was awful and his karaokee was just intolerable.  I got the mental photo of this as I was driving by and it made me laugh.  A good memory of my past.....I like that.  I bought a bunch of shit for the house today.  I bought a bunch of shit for the dog today.  $300 later.  Here I am, getting ready to hit Hollywood for the night.  Hey stay the fuck out if you know that you are not welcome.  Oh and yeah, the court is still going on to the person who asked.  I am going to trial, if you feel like taking a vacation then that would be nice.  July 15, case may be dropped may not.....Who knows, I will probably go to jail, where other people who are real criminals wouldn't.

      Get over it, Viking.  I am gone, for good....but rest assured, you will want me back.  I know that for a fact, so I am in the middle of protecting myself from you getting that chance.  Getting married next year, yeah right.  Tell some more lies.  I am divorced finally, congrats to me.  Perhaps I will meet the "ONE" and he will treat me the way I should be treated and we will be married.  Unlike you, who took me for granted and beat me, verbally abused me and criticized me every chance you could.  Hey, you think I want that back, you back?  Post more about me, link me, do what you got to do.  But know one thing, I DO NOT WANT YOU BACK....hahahahaha, that would just be fucking ridiculous. I have started my life over and I didn't have to hit the floor to get here.  Sad really, you are just sad.  Your dad, your cousin, your sisters......you have no family left to alienate.  You have silly little girls that will one day grow to know you as I know you.  Looks like I am not the first girl in your life that you have had this issue with.  First your sisters, then you hit Bronwyn and then me.  All you got to do now is hit one more person and you are done in life.  It will happen.  You have no self control. You post no apology to me and the truth is, I will never forgive you for trying to ruin my life.  I saved your sorry ass for what?  For this, court, trial....fucking Domestic Violence.  Fuck that, you laid your hands on me one too many times and that morning, I was not going to have much more of your shit.  The best part is this, I have the pictures now of what you did to me in September.  I should post them here for everyone to see your hand prints on my arms and neck (not fingers, hands), the rug burn on my ass and thighs from you dragging me by my ankles, the cut on my back from you throwing me through the sliding glass doors.  Or how about the doctor bills for all of the mental pain you have made me to suffer.  I have totaled them at, $7,800.  I don't ask anything of you, but if you want to world to know what you are then speak the truth and stop lying.  Tell everyone what you did to me.  How you got drunk and crushed my face in your hands and cracked my jaw so bad that I could not open my mouth for a month, how you slammed my face into the Navigator window over and over again.  Tell them and your cousin the reason we got into the fight was because you accused me of fucking him all day while you were at work.  Yeah John, you were the reason we started fighting that morning he called the cops on me.  He found a spot on the bed and was positive that it was you and me.  Diluted mind Viking, fucking diluted.  Keep telling people that I am crazy, keep telling them that you were abused.  A 128 pound girl who abuses her 270 pound boyfriend.  Believable?  NOPE! Keep telling yourself that it was all me, keep telling them too, I do not give a fuck.  The real me, the one you tainted, that I finally got back, is loved and respected by her family, by her friends, by all of her ex's and by new people she meets.  You?  I do not think so.  I am not bored enough or crazy enough to love you again or much less want to see you.  Get off your pedestal or reality will bump you off sooner or later.

      I am all settled in to my new house.  YES it is a house.  Guess who I am living with, just take a guess.  Bet you will never know.  She is fucking awesome and is in the know about everything.  Thank you for the elephant foot, thank you for your stupid clothes.  Shall I throw them away?  Where is my Pyrex cooking set?  Where are my wine glasses, where are my curtains, where is my surround sound system?  Had to take what wasn't yours?  Needed to be reminded of me everytime you walk into your house?  Cool for me, I know that you need something to clutch on, don't you?  I replaced most of it now and the shit I have is better and not tainted with your touch.  I have officially started over.    Looks like you made some people mad, what else is new?  It is ok though, cause you know like I know.  It is like you said and I hope that you do not mind if I quote you.  "Once they get to know who you really are, they will run, run, run, just like I did"  Can't we say the same about eachother?  Funny thing about me though.  The people that ran from me have come back.  Everyone except you, who I am working hard on having you never find me again.  Read up though, cause this is what you have now to comfort you.  I hope that the drugs and alcohol start to treat you better cause you have been clinging on like they are your best friend.  After they are done with you, that is the only friend you will have at the bottom.  Ciao.....

Hey click on  urlLink this  for something funny.  Hey if you hate Techno as much as I do, you will get a good laugh.

        It is called real life. My ex, the Viking, called me the other day and said "Did I call you at a bad time" I just hung up and had to pull over on the side of road to get myself together while the person in my car was concerned about why my heart was pallputating.     Why do people just call and say random shit and then when you ask them what it was that they wanted they have no formal response or at least, they do not want to share with people on my blog the real reason they call. I figure, hey if you want to talk to me, don't be a sneak and block your number so there is this element of surprise. How about, hey if I want to talk to you, I will answer, at least give me that choice. I feel like it was a stupid effort just to hear my voice and for me to   HAVE   to hear his. I thought that was what I wanted not that long ago, but actually after he decided to share with the blogger world the e-mails we sent back and forth I realized that nothing is sacred with this man and I     can not subject myself to his cruel forms of punishment. One day he will get over all this hate that he feels, this need to chastise me. Perhaps then I can talk with him, but the truth is, as each day goes by, the further from him I feel. The further I feel from what love I did have for him.  He is the type of man that eventually becomes friends with his ex's. I always told him that I was not that type but he told me I can always count on him no matter what. That was a false sense of security cause when it came down to it and I needed him, he was too jaded and hateful to put aside those feelings and be a better person for 5 minutes. I can never imagine myself being friends with him in my life. I feel like I will always be running and hiding from him just to keep my life normal and on the right track. Mike you have said a bucket load of hurtful things to me with the direct intention to hurt me. Everything you have done to slander me, to try and make me cry, to try and make me feel like less of a person have not effected my heart in the slightest these days. Rather they have effected my mind and made me think less of you as a person. I am not perfect and you have a way with pushing my buttons, as I do with you, where I lash out too. I suppose I am better then all of that now. It just took me a moment to realize how much more I am when I am not being a bitch and saying things I do not mean to people that I once cared for.  The fact that I cared for you for 3 years says enough for me to take a step back and acknowledge that love I felt for you. That acknowledgement was enough for me to put a stop to this bickering between us. I loved you, Viking but I do not love you that way anymore. It has taken me 5 months to get over you but I am finally there. Not that is should matter to you, though because it seems that you have moved on in your life just as I have in mine. This grip we   TRY   to hold on eachother does not work for us anymore, we are too far gone for all of that nonsense. I hope that I can go on with my life and you will not continue to invade me like you always have.......

      Funny how getting laid is in the air tonight or this morning....  I just had the best sexual experience with one of the hottest, most erotic men I have met to date. He had me so wet, talking dirty to me that I came without even a thought. I can not remember the last time I have been that wet over a man. Where you are at a point where you never seem to dry out and the bottle of lube is not even in your thoughts. Where you cum over and over again and when you begin to cum you are saying the persons name as you are moaning to your heightened pleasure. I had the house to myself and man did I moan loud and proud. He brought me to cum 3 times in 40 minutes. He talked dirty to me like I have never been talked to before. He suggested things that made me so turned on and shocked at the same time. The things he was willing to do to make me happy were phenomenal. Things that I have never done with a man before, things that I have always wanted to do. These were things that made me want him more and more. Not only more but would bring me to want to satisfy him at any cost. Do whatever he desired. He satisfied my need to be satisfied as well as my constant need for experimentation. leaving me wanting more and more of him. The sexual frustration between us was eating us alive earlier, so this was the most perfect cap to our evening. I can not wait to see him on Sunday, so I can kiss his beautiful face and make sure he is as satisfied as he made me tonight. I know that all of my thoughts will be on him and his on me as we go to bed.  This is for you.....goodnight baby!  ****kisses****

         There are moments in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from your dreams and hug them for real!  Dream what you want to dream; go where you want to go; be what you want to be, because you have only one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do.  May you have enough happiness to make you sweet, enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to keep you human, enough hope to make you happy.  The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past; you can't go forward in life until you let go of your past failures and heartaches.     Just a few thoughts that struck me as things to live by. I am trying to get through my e-mail but it seems like it is a never ending process. I only have 13 more pages to go through. Ugh.....

      There was this song that this guy used to play on my voice mail back in the day.  It was when he was courting me and wanted to take things to the next level.  Silly I suppose but it worked on me and it still has the same power to make me go back to those days and smile.  Too bad things did not work out for us but I still like the song.    Funny thing, I was unpacking a bunch of my stuff from storage and came across a program that must have been given to me by accident in the move.  I wonder how much it is needed and if it would be desired enough for its return.  I wonder if it would be desired as much as some things that belong to me that never made it to my storage.  Something for me to think about.

      OK, so my roomate came home Friday night babbling some crazy shit and then went right to bed.  She had been bawling for the last 2 hours with her brother and finally cried her way into a place capable of driving home.  I wake up the next day and tell her that I did not hear her actually come home, which is irregular for us.  She mentioned to me that she wanted to enjoy her night at the club, watching a band play, so she asked this dude for some weed.  Now I know that I have been out of the weed loop now for like 5 months, I am actually approaching my five months sober mark in a week, but this I have never heard of or seen for that matter.  He referred to it as "Mush" or "Moosh".  I suppose all I could make of it was that it was a cross between cush and something equally as good.  When she asked him if it was cush, he laughed and said "No way, this is moosh"  Now, like I was saying, I have been out of the loop for a while but will have to admit that this stuff got me drooling over it.  I have never heard of such a thing but she told me it was like the first time she got high.  That totally innocent, natural feeling that we all got when we first smoked weed. We had just discussed this not but a couple days earlier about how we thought that we would never feel that way again.  Someone wanted her to feel really good and they did.    Something to look out for I suppose.  Fuck, being sober at this moment in my life seems shitty but hey, I can stick to this.  It is not so bad.  The high only lasts but a short time, but the high I get from sobriety can last a lifetime.  Hey, have you heard of this shit?  I think that we would both be interested if this has hit the market yet....

      Ok so today in NY was a bit hectic. I am sure if you are half witted or have half a brain you watch CNN or Fox News Channels.  You know that the threat alert has been elevated to a higher level because 3 buildings in NY have been targeted for terrorist threat.  Apparently they have been casing the joints for over a year now and they know when people are working and when they are changing shifts.  There were cameras and cops on every corner either hootin and holerin or actually working.  It was a bitch to get around and everyone here is actually thinking that they will be hit again.  Guaranteed that they would never hit this city again with the amount of military they have just placed in the city.  Look out LA you are about to be blasted into little bits.  They are fucking stupid to think that LA does not need protection.  Fuck the financial buildings, knocking out LAX alone would put our economy to shit.  Here is a cop with sis dog outside the NY stock exchange....     Eh, who cares anyway, I feel safer here.  I will be home soon enough to get Chai and then off again.  Looks like August and September are the months.  Too bad plans did not work out for us the way it was supposed to.  I would have liked to had been going on this vacation with the person whom I planned it with.  I will be leaving for Australia in the second week of September and at the end of August I may be in Cancun while they are filming Gilligan's Island.  Whatever, who comes up with that shit?  We will see about the cancun thing though, it just may too much time away from my dog.  I wonder if the flights are cheaper from Cancun?

      Decided that this would be a great part of our trip so we made it last night after dinner in a top rated italian resturant.  Food was amazing and service was on point.  Mama came out to say hello to me and if my meal was "Alright"  She was wonderful.  Too bad we missed Rocco, but ending up with Mike was not such a loss.  I actually made a business connection through him and will be getting a call on Monday for an interview.  Moving right along to the neverending line.  Go here when you have patience and when you want to see the best view at night*****kisses people*****

      blow your minds.  I will be devising a plan over the next 4 days before my return to LA.  Not that it matters much but I am already buying furniture and locking myself in on a regular basis.  The uncrazy way yo say the same thing.......You will have to pull me out kicking and screaming to leave this beautiful place only to return to the hell hole we call LA.  The plan will be unbfolded at the end of next week for all fun and entertainment, toon in then.  In the mean time, I am having a remarkable time here in Manhatten.  We spent some time in ChinaTown to shop and in Little Italy to eat.  Here to exactly to eat:    I met an adrable Italian Man with the hardest ass, whom has asked to take me out dancing with him tomorrow night.  I accepted.......ironically though, his name was Leo.......One fucking Leo after another in my life.....Hopefull this one is as gentle as a Leo Lion.  rrrrraaarrrrh
