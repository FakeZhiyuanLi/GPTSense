      I'm back! Finally! It has been such a long time since i blogged. Been either busy with stuff or too lazy. I've been sick recently, dealing with throat infection, fever and a bout of cough. I'm fine now. School's getting busier now, now trying to get along with the class. Some bastards are so damn noisy, can't stand them. They suck. The rest of the class is pretty fine though. I really miss the holiday time. Argh.. Hoping holidays faster arrive. When that time comes, it'll bring along fun and joy. LoL

      It's a break that all have been wishing and waiting for. The first weekend of school. The final time to rest before hell gets unleashed. Next week, dont bother to look out for any posts. There wont be any, as school starts at 9am and ends at 10pm. So tell me where do I find time? I feel that I've overspent. $140 in 6 days. Don't even know where all the money goes to. Never-mind, what's gone is gone. Just wondering how to survive next week with only ten bucks in my wallet. Either it's ciggs or lunch everyday. Let's toss a coin and see which one would I get. Just finished packing my stuff for school tomorrow. ITS GOING TO BE A LOOONG DAY. Tomorrow is potato cooking day.. Arghh.

      When my alarm rang at 6.30 this morning, I shut it off then I sat up. Soon after, I fell asleep in that position, so lame. I finally woke up at 7.45 after my brother woke up. Luckily I made it to school in the nick of time, or else it would have been half a demerit point for me. We had early lunch today, so I went and met Steve at Bukit Batok Central's MacDonald. Hang around for 45mins have to go back already. Today is practical day, and we get to go the kitchen and strut our stuff. I kinda screwed up though. Today both my handphones was down, bloody unlucky day.

      It's boring at a new school, especially when you have no mates in the same class as you, all alone whole day long. Finally I started talking to my new schoolmates, most of them are my smoking khakis. It's boring to smoke alone too. There was morning class today and I had to drag my ass off the bed. I knew it! There's something wrong with me on Monday! Shower, Online, School. Same old procedure just like the past two days. IT. My favorite subject, too bad my favorite teacher is teaching that subject. Mr Unique Hairstyle. Hahaha Smoking break after IT, and met Daryl and two of his classmates there. Only remembered one of their name. During FK class we watched a video of the slaughtering process of sheeps. CooL ~ School is getting interesting. Lunch time finally! Took free bus go eat with smoking khakis, kenna tork by the rice seller. After POC we finally made it to the kitchen. Got to see all the stuff there, getting to cook on Friday. Tomorrow is sharpening knives day, rox. Want to go gang fight can borrow knives from me.. Guranteed for slaughter. Hahaha Gotta run, gotta organize my notes for the day.  Be back tomorrow

      This morning I can wake up abit later, as there's no IT class today. Relax at home, but still have to go school anyway. Left home at 9.15 and off to school I go! Almost late for class though. Today just received my knives, flaunting it along the way home, caught many awkward and terrified stares. Hahaha School ended at around 5pm.. Anyway this is a short post.. Damn tired. Off to bed I go

        It has been a four months break for me. Doing the same old the for the past four months. Sleep, Eat, Play, Online, Go Out, Smoke ( Not In Sequence ). It has drained me financially, and left me weak and feeble.   Now drained physically, mentally and financially, I am beginning on a new chapter of my life. Back to school ! Pursuing a Diploma in Culinary Skills at Shatec. Damn. The uniform makes me look like a nerdish waiter, the textbooks are as thick as the Physics textbook in secondary school, but have to be covered in three measly months, unlike two years in secondary school. But what can I do? I chose the road myself, so I have to grit my teeth and bear through it. I will prove everybody who doubt me, and excel in it.   That was a little intro there, now back to what this page is supposed to be. Waking up early was never easy for me, but today I just got up with ease. Don't bother to ask me, I'm just as bewildered. It was after a quick shower then I got out of house. Daryl called me only after he left home, so he had to wait for me at the Yew Tee Mrt station for me instead. After that, we headed for school! Upon reaching school, he headed for his class while I headed for mine ( Different Course ). I was the first to reach class, and my first lesson was Catering Science. My trainer had the most unique hairstyle in the school man! He's nice, friendly and funny. He talked about the rules and regulations and prohibitions, then made us introduce ourselves one by one. That sucked.   Thirty minutes into the lesson and there was a break, or rather a smoking break to me. After his lesson was IT. Damn! I think that guy is the brother of my secondary school Physics teacher. He has the same surname and last name and talks just like him! Am I so unlucky?! We gotta learn basic IT stuff, ahh... Crap.   It was finally lunch after that. Met Daryl at the kopitiam near the school ( For your info, there's no canteen in Shatec ). Used only ten minutes of my one and a half hour of lunch, then walked around the school aimlessly. At 1, we went to Daryl's class to find no one there, we walked around trying to find his class, then it turned out he didn't check his timetable properly and his class was at another room. Hahaha   It was a three and a half hour lesson after that before school ended, which I finally headed home !

      Saturday was one sway day. So is today. Just after I lit my cigarette, I slipped on the stairs (raining), and the cigarette flew out of my fingers, and onto the wet floor. Could there be anything more sway then that for me? Another damn fucked three hours break, nothing to do also, walk around West Mall, play arcade, then head back to school. Fell asleep during demo, damn fuck. Just couldn't keep myself awake, and missed out the part how to do the bloody salad. Tomorrow confirm get fucked by trainer. No money, no ciggs, no nothing, no everything. WHAT ELSE COULD BE WORSE?
