      Well hi. This'll be my handy dandy journal during my day. I had used livejournal.com before... but it was far too annoying and cumbersome to use. Whilst at work, I'd love to have something easy to use... thus, we'll see how this goes.  Anywho... I'd go onto this big deal of who I am... but I am feeling quite lazy as of late. So let's go into what's happening so far...  I arrived at the office on time today... but! I was a little late, due to the fact... I was locked out. See, I work in downtown L.A., and the parking structure is across the street. So I get there... and all the good parking places are already taken...  miffed . Up on the 5th floor... and please be aware, there are no elevators in this parking garage. I get to my building... to find I'm locked out, since I don't have my handy dandy mag card which lets me in. This means... back to the car, I go. Again with the street and the steps... root for what seems like hours... and then I found it, underneath the seat! Grr... then down and across. And please also be aware, the crummy intersection... takes a good 5 minutes for the light to change so I can cross. Mmm, nice.  Get into my cubby hole... and thus the routine starts. Fire up the browser... open up the work e-mail... make any necessary replies... fire up the IM clients... read the news... and then chill. :)  Yeah though... decided to open this and um yeah... hopefully my days will be less boring. ;) I know... this entry suck... merf.

      Yeah, so it's been a little bit since my last entry. Not entirely my fault, well okay... it was totally my fault. I just haven't had oodles of time... at least that I realized I had - available for me to do this whilst at work.     Work has been well, I have a couple projects open - nothing complete yet, since I'm always at the will of the organization. Not too much is going on though... so it's cool.    Car wise... I've got four cars right now. A little too many. I'm looking to get rid of a few of them... just not exactly sure which ones I'm planning on getting rid of, yet! So who knows. My BMW is currently at the dealer... I should get to pick her up today. They replaced the TCU and screwed up.... my lights when turned on, made this huge "buzzing" noise/sound. It really sucked.    I had to do a lot of bitching, but I received a free loaner vehicle from them... a BMW 745i sedan. 2004 model, even. Out the door pricing on it, is probably close to 100k. Give or take. Knowing BMW, its really close... since most dealers jack up the price on them. If I were giving a review for this vehicle, I'd probably give it an 8. It's a real smooth ride, very elegant, and has decent power. It's meant for an older audience though. It doesn't have the zip, for someone who wants something sporty. This is more like a family sedan, or the senior mobile. It oddly enough, reminds me of one of those Lincoln Continentals or a Grand Marquis, just a whole hell of a lot more elegant. I have a lead foot though... and I love stick shift... it's just not for me. I miss my car... :)    In my personal life, I seem to be doing all right. I am quite behind on a couple things though. I need to get cars straightened out, I need to move stuff out of my father's room, and I just need to clean. I need to work out more. I'm just so tired these days. Bleh.

      Isn't so bad. Considering... I was out in Las Vegas this past weekend. It went fairly well... I didn't really go for any particular reason, just to relax and be one with sinning - I suppose. ;)   I barely won any money, I actually barely broke even. Due to someone telling me, just to gamble anywhere. Meh!! I'm sticking to where I gamble, and that is that!!  Took in the Tournament of Kings - which was pretty good. The meal in fact, was a lot better than I first imagined it would be. I was expecting something... worse. Took me by surprise!  Though, after it's all said and done... I'm low on cash funds! Not a great thing... since I don't get paid for another week, mind you. That isn't fun. Hopefully though, something good will come my way soon... and I'll be able to get rid of some stuff. Ah well, right? Right-o. Here's to tomorrow... :-)  I also believe I've finally got my head screwed on straight.... sort-of. :D Who knnooowwsss.... yeah though... :-)

      So it's another day. I know I've been a little slow with my postings... but it's not my fault, honest it's not!! Today, I had to do a ticket!! ACK!!  Silly users caused a paper jam, and needed to be saved. Meh. Then they were all weird about it. Not knowing how or why it jammed... when someone messed with the printer tray... but I guess it was a lil green fairy ;-)  Anywho... not much else going on. It's my lunch break. I've exhausted all my munchies... so yeah. Here I am... nothing really noteworthy to comment upon. No rants. No thoughts. I'm just half dead. Hehehe....   I'm going to go now.... and um... I don't know... but yeah... :-)

      So yeah. Especially caddies. Stupid thing is a POS. I'm glad it's not mine... and I have yet to actually GET to work on my car... and I've been wanting to the whole week... ah well. It's good, and then it's bad... you'd have to be in the situation to understand.  Other than that... nothing is happening at work. Actually got here semi early this morning, however; I did forget my mag card key to get in. Doh. It sucked... trust me. It sucked SO bad! Badeth, sucketh, Moo'eth!  Anyway... um yeah... I'm going to look at this on-line community thang and see how many people will lodge a complaint against me within one hour. Woot!

      So I skipped a day. It's not because I was busy... no, it was because I forgot I had opened this silly acount. My bad... or is it... YOUR BAD?!?!? Yes, it's yours... 'cause you forgot to remind me. For shame...  Not a lot is new here. Just work. Work is the same. Not much going on. I may go on a trip to Sonoma soon... that'll be fun. At least... it ought to be ;-) Drift show will be up there... always tight.  Um... in other news... my new alternator for my car is eating belts. I just got two new ones... so hopefully, these will last quite nicely and I can make it over to Hesperia to get my sunroof fixed. Damn project car is being SUCH a project ;-) Don't you hate that? :-P  Anyway... I suppose I shouldn't fill this up completely with moronic rantings...zzz
