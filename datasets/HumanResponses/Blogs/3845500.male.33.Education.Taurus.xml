       The final two bodies from the helicopter that crashed near Bario have now been found.  With such a community air is the predominant form of transport, and whilst it is taken as routine, events like this are never far away.  As well as the crash of a helicopter just after it left Bario mid-July last year, there is a memorial to a plane crash next to Bario's old runway, and several people now alive only just survived a crash in a fixed-wing aircraft that was fatal for many others a few years back.  As an outsider it is easy to bemoan the logging tracks that get ever closer to Bario, but the majority of the villagers would like road access.  Seven hour trips on muddy roads that can only be made by 4WDs may not be safer than a flight, but it is an alternative.  The  urlLink Department of Transport  is preparing a new website which should allow you to  urlLink plan a route between any two places in the UK  (also in  urlLink Welsh ).  It isn't fully operational yet, but will hopefully be useful when it is finished.

       The  urlLink wreckage of a helicopter has been found near Bario , and it is believed to be the one that went down almost three weeks ago.  The pilot's window is broken, but the passenger window is intact.  As I understand it, troops are on the way to the scene, but the passengers could not be seen by the helicopter that found the crash site.

       I know I may only just have got back, but I am thinking about where I will be going for my next holiday, and I intend to take it before the end of the year.  Mixing overtime and what I will accrue during this holiday year, I will have enough to take four weeks off, and have been tossing the ideas of either Nepal or the Patagonian region of Chile and Argentina around.  I would love to go to Nepal, and part of me wants to go there even at the moment to see the country in turmoil, but I would also love to go back to South America and this time it has won.  I have a meeting in the US in early November, so I plan to go to that, then head straight down to Buenos Aires, spend four weeks in Argentina and Chile, then come back to the UK.  Time to dust off my Lonely Planet "Latin-American Phrasebook."

       I'm going to learn to ride a motorbike.  It is something I've been thinking about now and again for some time, but towards the end of my holiday it is something I was increasingly keen on.  There was always the danger that it would be something that would just fall by the wayside, especially over the last few weeks, but I've been speaking to a training centre in Bethnal Green today and am going to see them tomorrow to get the theory test books, and look at when I can fit in my CBT and Direct Access courses.  Not sure yet if I am going to go for the full or restricted direct access, there doesn't seem to be much in the 250cc-400cc range other than motocross bikes, and that's not what I'm looking for, so I'll have a chat with them tomorrow.  If I think a CBF250 will last me a couple of years then I'll just go for the restricted course.  Otherwise I might try the full direct access and get a 500cc cycle (any suggestions apart from a CBF500?).  Since my Mum died I've been trying hard to keep it all together.  However I very nearly came undone on the way into work this morning.  Lying on the floor was the plastic container from a tray of watermelon chunks.  I know it sounds trivial, but during the latter weeks Mum was unable to eat much, watermelon was just about the only thing I saw her eat.  Still no news on the helicopter near Bario.  I have found out who was on it, and one of the local businessmen I knew, and who ends up on a number of these trips, has let me know he is OK, but that doesn't change the fact there are still seven people missing.

       It has been a couple of weeks since my last post here. The reason for this is simple. On July 8th I had a call from my Dad to say that my Mum, who had been in hospital for about a month, had deteriorated sharply. She passed away from the effects of ovarian cancer at 4:50pm on the 9th with all her family around her. She will be deeply missed by many people, including me. Rest well, Mum, you've earned it.   I learnt today that there has been a  urlLink helicopter crash in the Kelabit Highlands of Sarawak , one of the Malaysian parts of Borneo. Bario, the centre of the Kelabit Highlands, was where I did my teaching stint with  urlLink Trekforce  last year. It looks as though the village has been turned into the centre of an intensive search and rescue effort. It has now been twelve days since contact was lost with the helicopter, but if the passengers survived the initial crash there must still a good chance of their rescue.  Water is not hard to find, and that alone can increase the chances of lasting until found by the search operation.  Finally, very many congratulations to Caspar and Becky on the birth of wee (3lb 12oz, about 1.7kg) Susannah Rosemary Furner on Tuesday afternoon.

       One of the minor items in the news over the past couple of days is that the government is supposed to be about to  urlLink set a date for the turn-off of analogue radio .  It is bound to be at least fifteen years away, or at least I would hope so, but there are various estimates that around 100 million analogue receivers are in use in the UK.  I use four or five on a regular basis myself (one on my MP3 player, another very small pocket one, a clock-radio in the bedroom, and one each in the living room and bathroom).  I guess it is time to buy another gadget.  At least  urlLink Xfm  is available on digital radio in my area, I'd be much more upset if it wasn't.  Nevertheless, surely this is a monumental landmark in broadcasting?  More so, I'd say, than the switching off of analogue television.  Or perhaps I am just a sad geek and it is of no import whatsoever.  In tech news, both  urlLink The Register  and  urlLink News.Com  report that Cisco is buying an offshoot of Imperial College (where I studied for three years then worked in the computer centre for seven years).  As an aside, why does Amazon estimate that a delivery dispatched today by first class post will not arrive until the 12th?  Are they just being realistic about the state of the post office at the moment?

        urlLink Mark Morford  has written  urlLink an article  in the  San Francisco Chronicle  about  urlLink Fahrenheit 9/11 .  Seems to strike the right balance between criticising Moore for his propaganda and complimenting what he has achieved.  A friend sent me a link to a  urlLink flash game .  I don't get it.  Today's  urlLink Guardian  has an article on some  urlLink alternative treks to the Inca Trail around Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia .  I'm spending alot of time on the train at the moment, so I've just ordered a few CDs from  urlLink Amazon  to put on my new little  urlLink MP3 player .   urlLink Franz Ferdinand ,  urlLink Scissor Sisters  and  urlLink The Streets .  Hmm, they are all in Amazon's  urlLink top 5  sellers.  How "with it" am I?

       I've found a new bit of software that might encourage me to make use of all those GPS co-ordinates I took whilst travelling.  It is called  urlLink worldKit , but I'll need to have a closer look at the documentation to see how much use it will be.  I'll need to use it in conjunction with mapping or image data, perhaps NASA's  urlLink Earth Observatory ? Especially the  urlLink Blue Marble  images, if I can find the disc space to store them.  Also stumbled upon the  urlLink Visible Earth  page.  Some really nice TIFF images from parts of the world.   urlLink Michael Moore  has started a  urlLink weblog of his own .  Just one day before I started mine, although I wonder why someone as media-savvy as he is hasn't done it before, the nearest he has come is a mailing list with very sporadic posts.  I'm in two minds on the guy, I used to respect him, and I still want to like what he is saying, but he is getting ever more extreme and starting the use the same tactics as the party he is fighting against when it comes to diverting the media's attention.

       Always being one on the forefront of technology (evidence: home PC is a blisteringly fast Pentium 233MHz  with MMX technology , and PDA is a PalmPilot from when they were made by USRobotics), I've started this little blog.  Why, I don't know.  Maybe I am yet another sad, lonely geek desperately in need of attention.  Maybe I think this is a way to find geek-chicks.  Maybe I just can't be bothered to go to the vending machine for an awful cup of coffee and this is the latter-day alternative to a conversation around the water cooler.  Whatever.  Let's see what happens.  My money is that this will be the only post I ever do and in a month I'll just delete the thing and free up some otherwise valuable electrons.

       I am looking forward to the new Wembley stadium being finished.  This is not because I have suddenly become a fan of football (I haven't), but I spent the weekend in Swansea and came back on the train yesterday evening. Yesterday was also the day of the "Charity Shield" match between Arsenal and Manchester United, held in the millenium stadium in Cardiff. The match kicked off at 3pm and was finished by 4:45pm, quite a bit of time before I passed through at 7:30pm. Through the vaguaries of Great Western's pricing, I'd also managed to book a   first class ticket for about the same price as standard class. Between Swansea and Cardiff, tickets were checked. However, once we got to Cardiff the train filled up and there were passengers standing everywhere. Tickets weren't checked again, and I don't believe that most of the passengers that ended up in the carriage I was in had first class tickets. That may sound like snobbery, but travelling first class is supposed to mean something, and one of the things is a bit more room than in the rest of the train, but here I was with other passengers sitting in the aisle and even on the table in front of me. Almost like being back in Laos.  Apart from transport, there are other reasons to be less than fanatical about the UK at the moment.  Today's  Evening Standard , not a paper I generally read, has a story about  urlLink foreigners being questioned on the tube . I'm suprised this isn't a policy that the Standard supports, but if it is true and not just another example of poor reporting in the Standard, I find it appalling. Yet another instance of the creeping, or rather galloping, authoritarianism in this country.  Next year marks the  urlLink 200th anniversary of the battle of Trafalgar .
