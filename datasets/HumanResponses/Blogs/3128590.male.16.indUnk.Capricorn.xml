      Here it is, Part 1 of a new "series" [I haven't created a single Part 2 yet...I guess I better get started on that :)]. You may be wondering why I didn't put it under Religion. The answer: Cuz I don't feel like it. But seriously, it's because the Creation/Evolution [which I'm also throwing Big Bang in there too] debate encompasses so many things that I thought it deserved another series by itself.  Today's post isn't going to have a lot of raw scientific facts - expect that stuff later. But rather, we're going to look at the probability of evolution actually occurring. This shouldn't take too long.  Imagine 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000 [50 zeros] blind men standing in space, all holding a jumbled-up Rubik's cube. What are the odds of them all finding the solution to the Rubik's cube at the exact same time? The average odds against each success would be 40,000,000,000,000,000,000 (4 x 10^19) to 1. Multiply those two huge numbers together and we get:  4,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, 000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (4^69) : 1  Wow - now that's a big number. Those are the [generous] odds of   one   functioning protein molecule coming about by chance on ancient earth. Plus, take into account that you have to have lots of them in order to contain life, and it's not very likely that it's gonna happen.  Oh yeah, and I forgot to say where it came from. Just the Nobel-prize-winning scientist Sir Fred Hoyle. But you know, just minor details...  Cool Song: Focal Point - Homicide  P.S. I also added a Search function for my blog...it's on the right-hand column, you'll have to scroll a little bit.

      I am proud to announce that yesterday I made the greatest purchase of my life: a 15 Gig Apple iPod. I am absolutely in love with this thing....but, there is an actual story behind it:  Yesterday, when I made up my mind that I would buy one, I pulled some money out of the bank and headed up to Joplin, more specifically - Best Buy. I walk in and find someone to talk to [my words will be in red, other people's will be green]:   "I wanna buy an iPod. Do you know anything about them?"   "Oh yeah, which one do you want?"   "The cheap one - 15 Gigs."  [opens little glass thing and pulls it out]  "Now....I don't have a Firewire port, so I have to use USB. Is everything I need in the box?"   "umm...let's see. *looks at box* Nope, you're gonna need a USB cord. What size do you want?"   "The cheapest one you have."  [goes and gets a $20 USB cord, which I later found out that you can get for like $5 at WalMart]  After I check out, I head back down here. I open the box, get everything out, and start charging the iPod. And that stupid USB cord came in those plastic things that are impossible to open, so I had to take the scissors to it. Ripped it all apart. Well, it didn't work - it was obvious that I was missing something. So I had to head back up to Best Buy. I found someone else that was supposedly the iPod expert. I found this cord that plugged into the iPod on one end and the USB port on the other.   "Won't this work?"   "uhhh....no. You need to buy a dock."   "Why the freak do I need to buy a dock?"   "Cuz."   "Do you guys sell them here?"   "We're out."   "Oh great."   I go to Radioshack, Rex, Office Depot, and Target before I finally find a dock. That's another $40. I buy it and come back home. The dock does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. It's a pretty little stand that makes sure that your iPod stands up straight instead of laying down on a desk. So yeah, I'm kinda ticked that I spend $60 on stuff that does nothing for me, and I still can't hook up my iPod to my computer.  So....today in about an hour I'm heading back up there one last time. I'm going to get my $40 back from Target, and I'm going to demand that Best Buy take back my $20 USB cord, even if I ripped the shreds out of it. [their return policy says that they take back stuff containing all original packaging and accessories - doesn't say it has to be in one piece] And then I'm going to buy that cord that could've fixed it from the beginning.  Sorry that ended up being so long and probably boring for you, but it was something that I got ticked about, so I decided to go ahead and blog it. Hopefully something religious will be next....

      Well, I'm starting to get tired of all the political stuff I've been posting about, so I wanna move on to some religious topics. The first is that of abortion. Wow, what an easy topic to start off on. Lots of reasons why abortion religiously sux:    You are killing someone - does nobody realize this? Read Exodus 20:13 and Deuteronomy  5:17 - "You shall not murder". How hard is that to understand? You have a baby in your stomach. To abort that means you kill it. Killing is bad. Duh.   Several religious documents have blatently condemned it. Yes, yes, I know - the Bible never says directly that abortion is wrong. But look to several other ancient religious documents...here are a few:   Didache ( Teaching of the Twelve Apostles ) 2:2 -> "...thou shalt not kill a child by abortion..."   Epistle of Barnabas 19:5 -> "Thou shalt not murder a child by abortion"    The Apocalypse of Peter  2:264 -> "Those who slew the unborn children will be tortured forever, for God wills it to so."   Petition by Athenagoras to Emperor Marcus Aurelius -> "We say that women who induce abortions are murderers, and will have to give account of it to God."   Paedagogus 2 -> "Our whole life can go on in observation of the laws of nature, if we gain dominion over our desires from the beginning and if we do not kill, by various means of a perverse art, the human offspring, born according to the designs of divine providence; for these women who, if order to hide their immorality, use abortive drugs which expel the child completely dead, abort at the same time their own human feelings."   Tertullian  Apology  9:7-8 -> "...we are not permitted, since murder has been prohibited to us once and for all, even to destroy...the fetus in the womb. It makes no difference whether one destroys a life that has already been born or one that is in the process of birth."   There are more, but I think you get the point already. Abortion isn't a new thing - it's something that has been condemned for a long long time.   Our list wouldn't be complete without this one: POD says so. :) "Abortion is murder, there's nothing you can say or do, to justify the fact that there's a living breathing baby inside of you!"    Well, to be completely honest, those are the only religious reasons I can think of. But, since I have time/room/nothing else to do, let's look at some objections and questions:   It's not a human, it's a  potential  human.   Now, this debate usually leads into "when does a fetus become a human?" and all of those other questions. But it doesn't really matter. The fact is that it is a human being like any one of us, just a little younger. Pretty good odds say that if you let it live, the fetus is going to become a human, adolescent, and eventually an adult.  I would agree that a sperm is a potential human, and an egg is a potential human. But once it begins to form and starts that process, it's going to become a human [unless something goes wrong]. The fact is that this is a stupid Leftist argument that is thrown around in order to divert focus from the real point.   The baby has inhabited the mother's body without her consent. It deserves to die!   What the...? People that make this argument need to go ask their mommy where babies come from. They don't just pop into your stomach. It takes...S-E-X. *gasp* That's right, YOU have to do something to cause YOU to get pregnant. YOU chose to have sex, and you should have to pay for the consequences. Get over it.   What about rape and incest?   I'm sure that I'm going to get a lot of "nuh uh"s from this one, but I think that even in the cases of rape/incest, abortion is wrong. Yes, rape and incest are horrible things. They are wrong both legally and religiously. However, that doesn't give you the right to kill the child. Two wrongs don't make a right, and one wrong doesn't justify the allowance of another one. In addition to that, it is possible to avoid the whole thing before it becomes a problem. If you seek medical attention immediately after you get raped, it is possible to remove all the male semen from your uterus, and the process never begins, the baby is never formed, and you have nothing to worry about.  So despite how much people want to make this exception, I don't think we should allow it. The  only  possible exception to the abortion issue would be if it endangers the mother. That's it.  Well, that's it for today. I don't know what religious topic I will talk about next - maybe capital punishment or rock music. I guess we'll just have to wait and find out. :)

      Unlike my previous posts, this one is going to be more commentary instead of point-by-point. It's much easier to explain that way:  In my opinion, marriage should be defined by the typical "one man, one woman" relationship. We've allowed every possible marriage that involves this theory: different races, different economic levels, etc [the only exception being consanguinity relationships]. But then, the homosexuals decided that they wanted to hop on the marriage train too. If we were to do this, we'd have to completely throw away the "one man, one woman" theory.  So without a standard such as that, it would be chaos. What would stop everyone from screaming "We have a  right  to get married!"? Nothing. People would want to marry animals. People would want to have multiple spouses. People would want to marry inanimate objects [talk about a tax break]. And why shouldn't they be able to? After all, the "one man, one woman" standard no longer exists, so doesn't everyone have the right to get married?  Well, when we have polygamy and bestiality legally permitted, that messes up everything. You have custody battles involving multiple webs of marriages, trying to sue lamps, and attempting to collect alimony payments from the horse who won't pay. The entire marriage code would almost have to be thrown out the window.  Well, that's the main legal reason why not to allow homosexual marriage. Of course, it's almost impossible to talk about this issue without discussin the religious aspect of it. However, I will save that for another time - whether or not homosexuals wed is, in my opinion, a different issue than whether or not homosexuality is wrong. Expect that topic sometime in the future.

      Quite possibly one of the biggest issues when coming to energy or more specifically, oil. Ever since Jimmy Carter [yes, Jimmy the Demmie] set aside 1.5 million acres of it for potential exploration. This area was known as Area 1002. Now, we're gonna see why we should drill in this area:    Oil! Yay! The most recent study I found was by the USGS in 1998, and they said that the amount of recoverable oil in the 1002 Area was about 7.7 billion barrels. Yeah, that's a lot. But we've all heard the battle cry of "No blood for oil". Let's check that out next:   There isn't really a lot of stuff to kill. If I was an animal, I certainly wouldn't wanna live there. There's no trees, nine-month winters, over fifty consecutive days of darkness, temperatures of 70 below zero, and that's only the winter-time. In the summer, the ice melts, but all it does is attract a buttload of mosquitos. Wow - Area 1002 sounds like a beautiful place to live, doesn't it? Exactly, it doesn't. And that's what the caribou think.   Jobs. Over 700,000 jobs could be created nationwide by drilling in ANWR, both directly and indirectly.   Alaskans - over 75% of the Alaskans say to go ahead and start drilling. They know what they're talking about, they live there. Let 'em at it!    Well, that's it for now. I may add more later, I may not. I guess you'll just have to wait and see for yourself. :)

      Sorry I haven't posted anything of importance yet - I have been super busy with preparing for Debate nationals, I haven't had much time to blog. But since I'm debating current issues, you'll probably see a lot of political writings. :) YAY!  Here we go, the Electoral College [EC]. It was established in Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution, and has been complained about SOOOOOO many times, it's started to get annoying. So here are some reasons why we need to keep this mother:    It's worked for 200 years - if it ain't broke, don't fix it! In the entire history of the United States, there have only been three Presidential elections where the winner had less popular votes than the loser. In 1876, Rutherford Hayes beat Samuel Tilden for President, although Tilden had over 200,000 more "votes" than Hayes [but also remember that Hayes won because a special electoral commission chose him]. In 1888, Harrison beat Cleveland, but the popular vote had a difference of less than 100,000 people. And finally, in 2000, Bush beat Gore despite being down by over 500,000 "votes". hmmm.....3 "mess-ups" out of 54 elections? Not bad if you ask me...   Federalism, federalism, federalism - one of the great things about the EC is that it gives power to the states. The states conduct the elections, the states count the votes, and the states hold the electoral votes. If we have a system of direct elections, all of that would be bypassed.   Mess-ups - what do you think of when you hear the words "I want a recount"? That's right, Gore in 2000. And if you think that it was crazy then, imagine what it would be like if we didn't have an EC. Instead of being able to say "Flordia, recount your votes", it would have to be "United States, recount your votes". Talk about craziness.   Our government - anyone that has ever taken a government class in high school or college knows that the United States is a  representative democracy . That means that  the people don't decide things, we decide who will decide things. In other words, we elect  representatives . Get it? And of course, the primary example of this is the EC.    Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that our election processes are perfect. I think that there are several reforms that need to be made, but replacing the EC with a system of direct elections is 1) too radical and 2) unnecessary. And finally, I'm sure there are many more reasons to keep the EC than I listed above, but those are all that I can think of at the moment.

      You may be asking yourself - why is my friendly neighborhood bloggerman using a different format for his title? Well, because    I feel like it   I'm tired    Heck - I didn't even plan on posting tonight. Instead, I was getting ready to go to bed, and I decided I'd log into my GMail account one more time. I got in and at the top of my screen, in BIG  BOLD  RED   colors, I see "New Features!".  So, of course, I click it. Google added 3 new features to their GMail system:    Import Contacts from other places.   Signatures. VERY good feature that I completely forgot about.   Safari. If anyone uses this browser, congats. As for me, I'm stuck with Windows for now.    Unfortunately, those weren't on my "wish list" of GMail features. But it does show that Google IS reading our e-mails, requests, and responses and is actually doing something about them. Congrats Google!  Oh yeah, and I bet I'm like one of the first people to blog about it. BOO YAH!

      Once again, another update to a previous post. I realized that I needed to add some things that Google needs to add to GMail:    On the left of your screen, you have a list of your folders [Inbox, Sent Mail, SPAM, Trash, etc] If you have an unread message in your Inbox, it'll show Inbox (1) - but it doesn't do this for SPAM. They need to make it where it notifies you of new SPAM mail just in case it doesn't deserve to be there. I'd hate for an important e-mail to get lost in my SPAM folder without me knowing it...   POP support. Of course, this is something that I'm sure Google is working on. Also, you can download a third-party program to make it POP-compatible, called POP Goes the GMail. The site is here:  urlLink http://jaybe.org/info.htm    IE compatibility. I've heard many complaints from people saying that GMail sometimes won't load when using IE. I tried it in IE, and sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Of course, it doesn't really matter to me - it works awesomely in Firefox - but they could help gain public support by fixing that error, whatever it is.   Manual conversation merging/splitting/etc. This is probably really hard for them to do, but many times GMail just doesn't get it right and I would really like to be able to manually do it myself.   Give us more memory. Ha ha - just kidding. [wow - what a dry, crappy joke]    Well, those are the only complaints I have now. Of course, GMail is still the greatest e-mail service out there, and I would encourage anyone and everyone to get one if they can.  That's all for now - peace out!

      This is just a brief update for something I forgot to put in my other iPod post...  If you're going to but an iPod, don't buy in a store if possible. Buy online. Why? Tax. If you buy from a store, it costs over $20 in taxes. Online: Not a dime. So if you find a reliable online store that sells iPods [like Apple's website] and have a credit card, I would definately recommend that method instead.  Well, that's it for now - just something that popped into my mind that I forgot to say earlier.

      I'm sure most of you have already heard of Google's E-mail service, GMail. They haven't opened it to the public yet - you have to receive an invitation before you are allowed an account. Luckily, I was one of the first ones to have one. Some features are:    1 Gig of e-mail space. That's right, 1,000 Megs. You never have to delete a message again.   Awesome searching. Of course, if Google made it, there's gonna be a search. If you have 1 Gig of e-mails, then you've gotta have some way of finding them...the answer is a simple, yet effective, search engine.   No more folders. The problem with folders is that if an e-mail message falls under 2 or more different folders, there's nothing you can do. Instead, GMail uses Labels that you "stick" to e-mail messages, allowing you to put 2 or more on any one message.   SPAM. From what I've seen, they have a pretty good SPAM filter that'll hopefully continue to improve as people continue to report which ones are SPAM and not. I haven't had a single crap mail go to my Inbox yet   Conversations. When you reply back to someone [and they reply to you] on a daily basis, normal e-mail services can make it pretty messy. But GMail organizes them into one message that has them all....it's super convenient.   Very few ads. They have little text ads located on the right side of your messages that are relevant to what you're talking about. You hardly even notice them, and they don't interfere with your e-mails. Much better than Hotmail's crappy banner ad on the top of every site.    The GMail invitation system is a primary example of supply and demand. If you have a GMail account, sometimes Google will allow you to invite some other people to use the service. At the beginning when a lot of geeks wanted invitations but there weren't a whole lot of them to pass around [high demand, low supply], they were selling them on eBay for around $80 a piece.   Then, Google gave a lot of them out, and all the geeks were finally getting theirs [low demand, high supply], and the prices on eBay dropped from $80 to $20 to $1 to "I can't even get rid of them now". So now I'm stuck with 6 invitations that I can't even get a dime off of. Rip off.  But Google recently changed their policy. Now you can't sell or trade GMail invites for money or other things. :( So now people can't profit off of them [although they really couldn't anymore since all the geeks have one...]  Well, that was yet another boring nerdy post. I read the News article about Google's new policy, so I decided to blog about it. Oh yeah - and if anyone wants a GMail account, I have 6 invitations. Just e-mail me at  urlLink tonyr1988@gmail.com . I'll send you an invitation to the e-mail address that you send me the e-mail from [make sense?]. First come, first serve.  Cool Song: Frost Like Ashes - Notions of Insanity
