      Why do i say it is. coz  i'm here to start anew with my past left behind me. haha....this is also my first time writing a blog.  Today didn't do much. morning was suppose to meet antho. but ended up selling skool concert tickets. sold to laopa, ben con, antho and.........yeah marcus. then after that we attended mass. after mass i, macrina, antho, marcus and lester went heartland mall. skip rciy, reason because we wanted to take photo(the sticker kind) and write a card to father fred. so go popular and buy card and later spend 16bucks on those photos. after then go back church except for lester coz he needed to rush home b4 12pm. so the rest of us attended legion, then yet again, halfway, we go off and then go fr.fred's office. talk some cock then later when we going to leave that time, we gave him the card with the photos inside. dun think i'll be seeing him during this while. after that, went to 401. sitsit and eat lunch, then manuel talk to us and yeah abt me and antho. on the fucked up things we've done. i still treat he and marcus as my brother. as for mark.....i'm not sure. i hope that manuel and marcus still treats me as their bro..... i still love and care for both of them. its gettin' late.... checkin' out my book......   aAr0nJuDe  Heaven's Decree
