      Hey hey! I ended up not goin to school today. I didn't feel like gettin up this morning.. And then I woke up at 11:00 & took a shower & got dressed. Then I was gonna fix my hair & put on my make-up & mom said there was no use in goin because it was late anyway.. So I didn't go. I was only gonna go to see "somebody" though.. But they wasn't there anyway.. So everything is good.  I finished watching "Miracle" today, It's a pretty good movie. It's all about hockey though.. Kinda boring.  Other than that, I've just been sittin around bein lazy & talkin on the phone. I haven't been on here a lot because it hasn't been workin for the most part of the day.. That made me mad but oh well..LoL!  I stayed on the phone with Adam till like 11:30 last night! So I was really tired this morning!  But anyway! I guess that's it...

      Shew! I've had a long week!  We went to Alabama Tuesday. It was pretty fun! We got a DVD player for the blazer, so I watched movies.. But I slept some too. Infact, I slept a lot. LOL!  So anyway, We got there earlier than usual. It was about 8:00. At night. But we usually dont get there till like 11:30-12:00. But we hung out for a little while, then I got online. Haha. Wayne has a computer up there..Thank God! LOL! I wouldn't know what I would've done all week without a computer! Went crazy I guess, LOL! Who knows?  But anyway! I forgot what we done each day! We went shoppin one day tho! Then a couple days we just hung out..  Then yesterday we went to Owensboro. We had to go to WalMart & get a card for Misty{Sis} because it was her birthday. That's the first time I've ever got to get a card that says "Sister" so, it was awesome. =) haha! But my aunt, sister, & Wayne's mom lives in Owensboro so we went to visit them. We had cake & ice cream! It was good!  Then we went to Wilma's{Aunt} We sat around for a little while. Then me, mom, Wayne, Andy{Cousin, Wilma's son}, Wilma, & Carl{Uncle, Wilma's husband} played Pictionary. We tried to get Darrell{Cousin, Wilma's other son} to play because I didn't want to, but he wouldn't because he had to work. So, I ended up playin.  I didn't like it at first.. But the last little while, It was fun. I got pretty good. It was fun.. I cracked up.. It was so fun spendin time with them tho. Andy is crazy.. lol!  So we played that for like an hour a & half.  So by the time we were done Alyssa{Neice} was asleep on the couch. So I had to move her because *I* was sleepin on that couch! LOL! I love that couch! It's so comfy. I wish I had one... I'd sleep on it every night. Well, Not every night. I'd miss my waterbed too much! LOL! But most of the time I would.   Anyway! So we made them a bed on the floor & I sat down with Morgan{Their cousin} for a few minutes.  Then Wayne, Carl, & Andy decided to go fishin. Crazy people. LOL! I wanted a snickers & a pepsi SO bad. I couldn't stand it. LOL! So I told them whoever came back first better bring me a snickers & a pepsi.. Or I'll die. LOL! So Andy came back first, He said he was probably comin back early.. So he got me some! What a great cousin! LOL!  But anyway, When they first left to go fishin..Dakota{Nephew} was playin ps2! So then I played for awhile. I raced then I didn't like it anymore because I wasn't doin too good! Haha! So then I played some kind of snowboard game.. It was fun. I was pretty good too. Until Andy came back in & he took the controler thing! LOL! Then he played that game like a pro or something! I was like "Omg" LOL!   But anyway! After he got done & Dakota was playin again, I talked to Andy for a few minutes! Then he went to bed. I layed there & watched Dakota play that game then I went to sleep. I was so tired.  Then after a few minutes, he came & layed beside me. LOL! I was like "Will you please turn the lights off?" Every light in that house was just glarin in my face. I was about to go crazy.   While he was turnin the lights off, Alyssa woke up & looked scared so she got up on the couch with me & Dakota slept on the other end{It was like a 2 piece or whatever you call em! Haha!} But anyway! So then I finally went to sleep.. It was like 3:30 in the morning by the time I finally went to sleep tho!  I woke up like a million times though. I dunno why. I slept good tho, other than wakin up!   Onto this morning, Oh Lord..  Dakota kept pokin me & sayin "Sarah, Get up. It's time to get up. Sarah.. Oh Sarah" Omg. I felt like punchin the kid in the face. I mean, I just wanted to sleep & that's all I heard. I was like "Shut up & leave me alone. Let me sleep!" Ugh.. I was about to go crazy. So he left me alone for about 10 minutes.. Then here he comes again, "Sarah.. Get up!" LOL!  So around 12:00{It was 1:00 our time!} I finally got up. Mom had already got everything packed & ready to go. So I got up & got ready & we left!  It was too late for breakfast, So we went to Long John Silvers to eat. Wilma works there so we ate & talked to her for a few minutes & said bye. Then we had to drop Dakota off at his Nana's! Then we started back to The Big Lou! Haha!  Believe it or not, I couldn't wait to come back. It's been a long time since I've stayed gone that far away for that long. So needless to say, I was homesick!  I watched a couple movies! Then I went to sleep, We was 15 minutes away from Morehead. So I went to sleep & woke up when we were like 5 minutes from Ashland. I was like Yay!  I wanted to go back to sleep but I didn't. I was so glad to get home, Yall do not even know.  When we got home, I called dad.. Then Brittany called me. I didn't stay on the phone long tho! All I wanted to do was take a shower! LOL! That was my #1 goal when I got home!  So I took a shower. And called everybody & got caught up with everything.. Then got on here..  And now here I am! =)  Such a wonderful few days huh!  I just found out today that school starts back Aug 9th! I'll be a big sophomore! Shewie! Time goes by so fast. It seems like yesterday I was in middle school. I miss those good ol' days! But highschool is great! =) Only 3 more years...  Wow..  Anyway! I really dont know what Im doin tomorrow. Probably unpackin & gettin ready to go to my dad's!  I gotta stay with Jamie sometime soon tho! And I gotta get ahold of Amy! And Kim.. Shew Lord! Haha!  I guess that's it! Hope everybody's havin a great summer!
