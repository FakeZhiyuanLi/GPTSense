       I can't help you unless you help yourself.  It echoed through her mind.  "I am so fucking sick of hearing that."  It wasn't like she hadn't tried, it's not like it was so simple. They didn't know. They didn't understand at all.  No one could.   The phone rang a few days later.  "Hello?" "Emma? Is that you? It's only me." Emma slid to the floor and curled the phone in her lap. This would take too long to stand through.  "Hi Mum," she said.

      "Thanks, Shane." She stammered as he sauntered away from her. With nothing on apart from his denim jeans, he gave Emma an ideal opportunity to gaze at his perfectly sculpted body, his washboard abs and masculine six pack. Emma sighed softly to herself as Shane looked back long enough to throw the syringe her in direction.  She scampered like a hungry child to the needle. As the pin stabbed her skin, Emma closed her eyes and heard the front door shut in Shane's wake. She let the syringe fall, empty, to the floor and lay back on the bed where she and Shane had been, minutes ago.  She felt strange, suddenly, as if the world were spinning and then not. Opening her eyes, Emma couldn't focus on anything around her and eventually gave up, closing her eyes again. She began to enjoy the sensations running through her body as a small smile crept over her face as unconsciousness crashed towards her.  "Emma?" She heard someone calling her name, someone female and unfamiliar. Emma opened one eye doubtfully and looked around. Her apartment was like a junk yard and went unnoticed as she saw a tall, confident woman standing in the doorway of her bedroom door. "Who the hell are you?" Emma slurred.  "Don't you remember? It's me, Alana." Alana stepped into the depth of Emma's bedroom and noticed the unused condom wrappers around the bed. "What are you doing here?" Emma asked bitterly. "I was worried about you," Alana sighed, "So I thought I'd stop by."  "I thought that was against regulations." Emma spat sarcastically. "It is. But I'm putting my neck on the line for you." Alana sat hesitantly on the edge of Emma bed and reached out to put her hand on Emma's leg. Emme kicked her away and rolled over. She wasn't sure how long she'd been out, but she was certain she needed a cigarette.  Inhaling deeply, Emma glared angirly at Alana. "I'm fine. You can see that, can't you?" Emma challenged. Alana shook her head. "I wish there was more I could do to help you, Emma. But I can't help you unless you help yourself." She stood up and gave Emma one final, sad look before turning and walking away. Emma smirked triamphantly to herself. She heard the door shut again and began thinking of her next hit.

      ...closed her eyes, fighting to relocate herself in her own body.   just one more hit . emma heard the creak of the stairs, the clanging of metal as he swung on the railing. you never made friends with these kinds of people, but she couldn't help but feel a bond between her and her fellow...no, not addicts...Don't say that word. they'd warned her about shane.  said he was too personal.  said it was better to keep people like him at arms length.  the first time emma met shane he'd made her feel relaxed and important by basing the whole meeting around her.  after an hour she realised he knew everything about her, where she lived, her birthday, her mobile number, even her shoe size.  she knew nothing about him.  she opened the door, turning the latch slowly, giving her more time to back out.  shane smiled, 'how's it going, beautiful?' and stuck his foot in the door.  within half an hour he'd had her in tears, blubbering out all her problems into his lap as he stroked her hair.  how she felt useless, how she felt alone, how she had no money and no respect for herself.  how she was down to her last few dollars but was so desperate for a fix that hunger didn't come into the equation.  'word on the street is you've been visiting the meth clinic' he said, emma stared straight ahead. 'never saw you as a quitter.  always figured you to be a  customer for life.  in my line of business you get an inkling about people, i figured you as a stayer'  emma focused on the pile of dirty washing beside the dresser. each time he moved he pushed her face further into the bedclothes until she couldn't breathe, but still she didn't fight back.  he stood up, threw the junk on the bed and zipped up his pants.  'i'll take that as payment, cant have you not eating, can we?'

      The shoes came towards her and Emma tightened her grip on herself. She quivered in her seat as the man approached and couldn't bring herself to look up at him.  He cleared his throat and sounded strangely feminine. Emma finally gathered the courage to peer up at him. She saw not a man, but Alana, a concerned look on her face.  "Are you OK?" Alana asked. Emma shook her head. "I have to get out of here." Emma stood up, her entire body trembling. She hurried to the door, and found it locked. "Could you unlock this door please." "Of course. You know the methodone program is totally voluntary." "I vonlunteer not to be here." Emma announced as the other addicts looked at her with a masked approval in their eyes. She had the courage to do what they all wished they could.  Alana unlocked the door by tapping in a simple five-digit code into the pad attatched the wall. She stood at the door long enough to watch Emma leave and turned her attention back towards the other inpatients.   Emma burst through the door of her apartment and flung her bag to the wall. She kicked off her shoes and stepped over important books and papers that carpetted her floor. She managed to thrust herself into the bedroom in time for the tears to come crashing down her cheeks. She wanted a hit, something to make the reality slip away again. She wanted to feel the cool grass beneath her.  Pushing herself from up off the bed and wiping her face with both hands, smearing the tears across her face, Emma began to dig through the already messed up drawers of her wardrobe and vanity dresser. There were empty, save for a collection of clothing. Emma let out an angry cry and tore back into the living room.  She ripped open her bag and dug through the junk there, searching for her wallet. She found it, and a small amount of cash she had to last her for the fortnight. To hell with it all, she thought, as she picked up the phone and called her contact. She felt better several minutes later, a pick-up time arranged.   Emma felt a sense of forboding as she entered the park, as if she were being watched as she she spied her man, she swallowed thickly as she...

      as emma sat down, she saw the words from the floor float upwards and suck back into the mouths that they'd come from.  her eyes followed them from the floor, to the mouths, and up to their eyes, and for the first time in a long time, there were eyes looking at her.  not all of them were nice.  some seemed to look right through her, some seemed to look past her, and some, she swore, could see right down deep inside where everything was supposed to be hidden.  emma wrapped her thin arms around herself, trying to keep everything inside. she didn't want them to spill out. she didn't want to know these people, yet they insisted on rising within her, insisted on stealing her time which she so preciously kept so close to her.   her fingers strayed to the watch on her left hand, circling the face, feeling the ridges that she knew so well.  this scratch from the fall out of the tree, this dent from crashing my bike, this faint graze where she accidentally walked into the wall .  she closed her eyes and remembered back to when she fell.   .....opening her eyes, the grass is magnified, so close to her pupils she feels she could see the life pulsing through the blades. she can see her right arm, stretched out under her head, her left must be what's making it so uncomfortable to lay here.  a breeze stirs and gently lifts the skirts of her dress.  emma closes her eyes and when she opens them, instead of the cool grass blades before her, there is a pair of mans shoes.

      She watched as the man and woman continued to argue over the colouring-in book until Alana stepped between them and took the book away. Emma clutched her drink tightly and waited in fearful anticipation as she watched the man's eyes grow dark with anger.   He stepped towards Alana and raised his fists. Jumping up from her seat and ignoring the stares from the group around her, Emma rushed forward and threw herself between Alana and the man.  She closed her eyes and waited for the man's blow to strike her. Nothing happened, however, and she cautiously opened one eye. Peering towards the man, she saw that the anger had gone and a smile was on his face now as Alana had given him a few pages from the book, as she had done for the woman.  Alana stared strangely at Emma. "Are you alright, there?" Alana asked. Emma nodded. Alana gently guided Emma back to the group she had originally taken her to and sat her back down. "You stay here," She said, "And get to know these people. Ask them questions, talk to them. They can hear you." She urged as she disappeared into the crowd once again.

      "No problem," the woman chirped. She offered her hand, "Name's Alana."  Emma lowered her gaze, but said quietly, "I'm Emma."  Alana said the name over to herself once, then a look of recognition faded through her eyes. "Ooooh," she realised. "Right."  Emma was lead to a group sitting by the largest of the windows. "I'll be over here if you need anything," Alana grinned, then walked away to welcome another newcomer.  Emma sat down. The group was made up of 5 other people; 3 men and 2 women. They scrutinized her with keen yet cautious eyes as she did her best to smile politely and sit down.  "Don't want no trouble, see?" A shrill voice screeched from a group behind them. Emma glanced back to see two members of another group, a young man and a middle aged woman, fighting over a coloring-in book.  Emma groaned inside.  What the hell am I doing here?  she thought.

      Emma shuddered at the thought. Perhaps it wasn't that the words had fallen from the lips of those around her. Perhaps it was more the case that Emma's ears were filled with cotten wool. Regardless, she shuffled through the room, keeping her eyes downcast to the ground. She made it to the refreshment table and took the cup of punch offered to her.  "What's in it?" She asked. The woman behind the table gave a shrug. "I didn't make it, I'm just serving it." Was the curt reply. Emma nursed her cup as she moved through the room again. She wanted someone to say something to her, anything, even if it was someone telling her to leave. She hated the silence that followed her through the room, hated it so badly her hands shook. She cursed under her breath when the punch spilt over the sides of her cup and onto her hands.  "Here," Said a voice, "Let me help you." Emma felt strong hands close over her own and watched as the glass cup was taken from her and replaced with a white napkin, which seeped up the split punch. At that same time, the silence was seeped from the room and the conversations began to flow again. Before she could bring herself to look up to the woman who stood before her, Emma heard snippets of conversation. What was she doing there, after what she'd done. Who did she think she was?  "Thank you," Emma breathed softly, finally looking up at the woman.

      it was as if she had a super power.  the ability to quiet a room, once full of conversation, just by entering it.  Those affected by this super natural power could not meet the eye of its beholder.  perhaps their words were sucked from the air and slammed to the floor, where they were now nestled comfortably beside sneakers and boots, and everyone was engrossed in the same chapter. Emma subconsciously scuffed her feet.  maybe the words would come unstuck and find their voice again.  but did she really want to hear what they had to say?

      It seemed an eternity before he saw her again.  Like, a very very very long time. The kind of eternity people wait to hear of new chapters in a story....   Anyway, it seemed an eternity before he saw her again. But Barry thought of her every second of every day.  He began to daydream in class. Playing out in his head his fairytale. The nerd and the girl of his dreams.  "Hey Kotter, wake up," someone slapped the back of his head, and Barry snapped forward, bumping his nose on his desk.  Blood poured from his face.  His teacher glanced up, handed him a tissue, and sent him to the nurse's room. He opened the door, talking nasally as he held the tissue to his nose.  "Ekscues nme.." he sputtered, as he looked to the floor.  A kind hand reached forward and gently lifted his chin. "Well, fancy seeing you here."  He looked up into her eyes and almost cried. Happy to see her again, but also embarassed it was like this.  "How humilating," he thought.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      For the first time in his young life, Barry Kotter found that he couldn't recall a word the teacher had said throughout the entire lesson. Carrigan was the source of his distraction as he spent the entire forty minutes inhaling the sweet scent of her hair and wondering what it would be like to run his fingers through her hair.  At the end of the lesson, Barry quickly gathered his things to follow Carrigan out to the hall. He caught up with her as she stopped outside her locker.  "Carrigan, I was wondering if maybe you'd like to..." "Hey, look, it's Harry Potter's fuck-buddy!" The cruel taunt echoed through Barry's mind as he turned around to see the snarling faces of those who thought it entertaining to demean him. "Barry Kotter's got a little girlfriend!" Another taunt came, this one dripping with sarcasm.  "Why don't you all just piss off?" Carrigan asked fiercely, frowning darkly with her hands on her hips. The boys continued to taunt and tease, throwing random nasty comments at Barry. When they'd finally disappeared around the corner, Barry turned to Carrigan with a deep blush on his cheeks.  "I'll just go now," Barry shrugged as he walked away...

      Barry pushed his glasses back up the bridge of his nose. He was going to be late for his class, if he didn't get a move on. He glanced down at his Harry Potter bag and gave a slight smile. To hell with what everyone else thought, he told himself, he was happy to carry his HP bag, regardless of what cruel words where thrown his way.  Sitting at the front of the class, Barry pulled out his Science text book and then a note book, already half full with notes scribbled randomly throughout the pages. He pulled out his pens, one blue, one black, but never red. His mother insisted that using a red pen was a sign of rudeness and so he had left his red pens at home, sitting beside his computer desk.  Barry looked up as the classroom door opened. Instead of the teacher entering the room, Barry caught his breath as a tall, handsome GIRL entered the room. She had long flowing blonde hair and even from where he sat, way across the room, he could see the deep pools of chocolate brown eyes behind tortoise shell glasses.  "Is this seat taken?" She spoke to hime, her voice velvet. Barry swallowed thickly and pushed his bag to the floor. "Not at all." He smiled. She sat beside him and organized her workbooks, then her pens, one blue and one black. "No red pen?" Barry asked, struggling to make conversation as his palms began to sweat.  The girl beside him smiled and shook her head. "I don't like red pens, I think they're rude, don't you?" She asked. "Well, my mother thinks so." Barry said and instantly felt a fool. His cheeks began to burn and he swallowed thickly, looking away. The girl beside him merely smiled her put her hand on his.  "My name's Carrigan, what's yours?" She asked softly. "Barry Kotter." He replied, recoling as he waited for a snide comment to come his way. Carrigan said nothing derogative, however, merely smiled. "I'll bet that's a popular name with the girls." She winked as the teacher finally entered the room.

      "Yeah?"  "Yeah!"  The other boy pushed Barry into the wall, "Oh yeah?"  The bell went. Barry straighted his glasses and grabbed his bag. "Jerk," he muttered.  As Barry walked to next class, someone called out to him: "Hey nice schoolbag jerkoff... where's ya wand magicman? Ha! Look everyone 'Harry Potter' is so gay!"  But that's just another day in the life for Barry.  Barry Kotter. Though he may have looked like an ordinary schoolboy, he was in fact very special indeed... meaning he was a nerd with no friends and a name that sounded like a fictional character.  Apart from the name and the fact that he wore glasses, Barry was nothing like the famed book series. He was heavy set with blonde hair, and his school shirt always seemed to be hanging out. His school was no Hogwarts. His teachers barely entrancing. He was into Math and Chemistry, preferring science to spells. But nevertheless, since his first day at the new high school, his classmates had found his weaknesses right away and pounced.

      emma listened as her mother continued with her ramblings.  the next door neighbour was pruning his fruit trees and letting the leaves fall on her side of the fence.  the neighbour over the back kept letting her cat shit in her yard, and could she imagine what it was like to wake in the morning and step into shit??  yes she could  emma placed the receiver on the floor as her mum started to tell her about her fathers sister,  'you know the one' .  she pulled up the entire contents of what shane had given her into her syringe, supposed to last her at least three days. glancing around the room she saw what her life had become.  shit.  she wasn't strong enough to take the help offered, not strong enough to ask for more, only more to keep her heading down the wrong path. the path of destruction, she'd heard it called before.  she pushed down on the needle.  i wouldn't call it destructive, I'd call it finality

      P.S  For crying out loud, of course things get boring and slow - everyone gets killed off because we seem to loose interest in something that was so intriguing to begin with. Add more people, if you want, or else we need to start thinking up jucier story lines. Maybe if we had more sex on here, maybe that would grab interest....

      The flames leapt at the night sky, like skeletal fingers curling up from the grave. The stench of death enveloped the crowd of onlookers that had gathered to watch the burning infurno. Screams could be heard, screams of people trapped within the building, crying out for help that no one could give....  Lita Vaughan awoke covered in a cold blanket of sweat. Her hands were shaking and she couldn't seem to find the light switch. Staggering through the darkness, she made it to the bathroom and managed to stop her hands shaking long enough to splash cold water across her face. She glared at herself in the mirror's reflection and then heard her alarm clock singing out to her.  'And in the news this morning, an apartment block has burnt down, killing almost all of the residents inside.' Lita dropped her toothbrush. It clattered noisily in the sink and she swallowed thickly. Returning to her bedroom, she stood beside the alarm clock and listened intently as the anchor woman continued. 'Police suspect arson may be involved...'

      'im sorry it's had to come to this, barry' barry looked up at her, she looked so kind and she was on his side...someone on his side for once.  he'd waited all his life for someone to be on his side, someone to stick up for him and to make it all better.  'barry?' carrigan took hi hand while she dabbed at the blood on barry's face.   'life isnt fair, is it sweetie? all these people playing games with your emotions and your life. wouldn't you just love for it to stop?' it took all of his courage. barry sat up straight, sniffed away the dripping blood and spoke directly to carrigan, 'yes i would' carrigan smiled and barry felt as if she really could help him.  his heart swelled with happiness as she placed her hand over it. 'barry, i'm going to make it all go away' and with that, carrigan plnged her hand deep into barry's chest and ripped his heart out, killing him an instant after she held it up for him to see. as carrigan stuffed barry into the body bag she sighed. 'poor unfortunate boy, will they ever learn? if you're boring, thats the end of you.  i wish i knew why i always have to be the one to kill them off tho'  the end
