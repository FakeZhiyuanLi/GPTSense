      Sorry I didn`t do a written post yesterday, but it was hectic enough with trying to get all those pictures from Tokyo up during the Natsu Matsuri.  Yesterday and today was Oshima-mura`s summer festival. The BOE office competed as a team in the tug of war contest. Sadly enough we lost (and with all that girl power too!) But a good time was had by all.  I ate all kinds of good foods and had that cider drink where the marble is in the bottle neck but you can still drink if it doesn`t roll to the opening.  I had chocolate ice cream and bought a fat stuffed elephant (I named him Bernie, he lives on my couch, and has his own pillow.... what, I need company!)  I also got a couple of those cool paper fans called uchiwa.  The day before I went swimming with Ako and Tamura-sensei, who says I can call her by her nickname, Kyo-chan.  Everyone calls me Brooki or Brooki-chan for a nickname.  Just now, my neighbor and the Jr. High gym teacher Yoshida-sensei made us some lunch, some udon noodles.  It was very good. Later he may teach me how to make onigiri , which are rice balls or triangles with a food inside like salmon or plum or whatever you like, then wrapped around with a piece of seaweed called nori.  I`ve always wanted to make those! They feed you really well around here. I think I caught a little cold from all the swimming and exercise and getting so hot though.  It was hard to get up this morning and I missed most of the sports festival.  But I think it is better to rest longer so I don`t get sick.  I have much to do this coming week I think.  I brought grits the other day, and it was interesting to explain. More later. Hosha ne.

      Hello all, and welcome to another edition of  Life in a Small Japanese Town in the Mountains.   Today I read my bike to work and waved to all the staring people who kindly nodded to me and said ohayo gozaimasu. It`s really a pretty place, Oshima.  I`ve been studying some Kanji this morning as well. I wanted to know what the kanji on my toilet handle said as it can be turned both ways. One says Dai which is big and one says Sho which is little.  So you have the grand flush and the small flush. Interesting huh?  I made a grand meal of spaghetti for dinner last night with some eggplant and cucumbers in it that I got from a teacher at the Junior High School.  A huge group of elementary students carrying musical instruments in cases and flags just came in to the BOE so maybe we`ll hear some music shortly. In a way I`ve felt like a toddler again, although one who can cook for herself.  It`s hard to talk to people, I can`t read anything, and even the road is backwards! But it has been a very fun adventure so far.  I only wish there was a native English speaker here  to share it with.  But hey, ya`ll are all reading this so you can share in it a bit as well. So please come on this adventure with me! Oh, also my cell phone has a camera on it! Sugoi desu ne! But I have to find out about getting a cord to download it to the computer. Still it`s really cool.  I went to bed really early last night. (well by 10pm) even though I wanted to study and learn how to make a cd from my video camera, I was just too tired. As for losing weight in Japan.  Well, I don`t foresee that happening too soon unless I start biking a lot more and walking, but it`s chooooo atsui (so hot!).  As for those who are hoping to talk to me on the phone soon, I have my cell number if you want to call. But I can`t call long distance until my first paycheck is put in the bank and I can sign up for worldlink. At least I can email everyday (not sure about weekends). Tomorrow is the festival in Oshima. They call it Natsu Matsuri which is just summer festival. The BOE is supposed to be one team in a tug of war competition.   I really think everyone here is cute.  I hope that`s not rude to say, I mean, I do take them seriously, but they all have wonderful personalities and everyone in the office is very close. It has been a great experience. I hope I can learn to read more kanji so I know whether that other bottle of laundry stuff is detergent or fabric softener, or stain remover? As for you other ALTs, please come visit. My apato wa chisaii desu, demo I`ll put away the kotetsu table and you are welcome to stay in beautiful Oshima and go to an onsen with me. Feel free to leave comments on this site. Arrigatou gozaimasu.

      Hello everyone. I have been so busy. I keep having problems with this keyboard switching to Hiragana on me.&nbsp; I was taken out to dinner for sushi and beer and&nbsp; it was delicious. It was me and Masayuki~san, my supervisor, and Ako~san who works in the office and my neighbor, Yoshida~sensei who also teaches at school.&nbsp; Somehow they convinced me to sing some country music (I sang Patty Loveless ). Then we went to the supermarket (also know as the Supa)&nbsp; .&nbsp;&nbsp;I got some Cocoa Krispies, milk, OJ , and stuff for spaghetti. Really nothing Japanese, but Yoshida-sensei says he`ll teach me how to make onigiri (rice balls).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They taught me how to say &nbsp;sweet (amaii) and seaweed (nori). Today I woke up and washed clothes and learned how to use the hot water heater to shower and fill up the bath.&nbsp; I wish I was having as good of luck with this keyboard. I read my predecessor:s notes and learned about the satelite tv I have in my room (2 guys came and put it up my room along with my air conditioner yesterday). Today I got my Inkan ( or stamp/seal of my name to sign official documents with, like the power bill and bank stuff). I also set up a bank account and met many official people, like the headman at each of the schools. Hopefully I can get signed up for the calling program to call long distance so I can talk to some of you on the phone. (so far I:ve been relying on free phone cards from the orientation.) Oshima is really a very beautiful though very hot place.&nbsp; I may need stronger deoderant in a place like this.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been able to undertand some things people are saying in Japanese conversations, but usually I am lost.&nbsp; I hope I can practice and learn much Japanese and　be a good teacher while I`m here, but I`m not discouraged yet, cause it:s only my second day !&nbsp; Today also, I talked with Masayuki^san about traveling home for Winter holidays and also going to see the Kodo drummers on Sado island very soon in August. I said hello to some Jr. High students today, and they are so darned cute! There seems to be so much to do everyday, but mostly people are very nice&nbsp; and say relax! I haven`t driven my car yet, but I`m still learning where everything is. I have a desk at both the Junior High and the Board of Education and I`ll be working from 8:15 until 4:15 everyday. I think the hardest thing is learning so many people`s names. I admit, I don`t remember very many. My brain has a small learning curve right now with so much newness. But hey, I can get Sky Perfect TV where I can watch both Cartoon Network and Japanese anime so I will definately be okay. Everyone is excited that they will get to meet my family and boyfriend in the spring, as foreigners are a commodity. I am the first American here so I gots to represent! Now I just look forward to&nbsp; finding a Yukata (like a kimono only light cotton for summer), and going to natsu~matsuri (summer festivals) If I don:t get internet soon in my apartment ( I may want to see how much the first bills are that are automatically taken out of my account for rent, and electric and gas and car insurance, then I`ll work on putting images from my vid camera on a disk and bringing them to the office. I hope all is well with all. Please take care of yourselves, Please take care of my fish, Please send me email. If you want my cell phone number please write to my email address(if I know you that is). Hee hee. Much love from Oshima village!

      Tonite was my last night, and boy what a time it has been.&nbsp; Mary woke me up this morning and asked me if I wanted to go walking about and find a bag for sale.&nbsp; So we went walking, but nothing was open at 7am, but it was bright like it was 10am outside and not yet hot.&nbsp; It gets dark much earlier here.&nbsp; I was used to it getting dark around 9pm back home, but it seems to be dusk around 7pm here.&nbsp; I saw Tokyo's version of time square tonite.&nbsp; It was huge and crowded and beautiful and amazing all at the same time.&nbsp; There are all sorts of people there at night and the crowd is still bustling at 11pm even on a Tuesday night.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've decided those claw games to win stuffed animals are what fuel the economy because I've found myself putting about $20 worth of change in trying to win cute cat stuffed animals!&nbsp; Well, I guess it will be good to be away from the hustle and bustle of&nbsp;Tokyo and into the quiet country side where I'll have to start practicing my Japanese.&nbsp; I went to a little Italian/Japanese restaurant with Nicole (my friend from Columbia, SC and Mary and Robert, who intends to write travel guides at some point.&nbsp; I'm sitting here writing this in my hotel room wearing a kind of Japanese striped bathrobe... pictures later.&nbsp; I've made many a good friend here and I hope I can keep in touch with some of them.&nbsp; tomorrow at 8:15am (that's about 7:15pm for you folks at home on Eastern time), I'll be getting on the bullet train, called the Joetsu Shinkansen, to go to my host prefecture and into my town to meet with my supervisor, Masayuki-san.&nbsp; Please wish me luck in my new home.&nbsp; Love and miss all at home.&nbsp; Good-night.

      I'm here on my second full day in Tokyo. It's been really exciting so far, and I'm just getting over the jet lag.&nbsp; They've kept us so very busy at the conference here that there's barely any time to get out and see Tokyo.&nbsp; Up on the 43rd floor there's a great view of Tokyo from the Moonlight room where I had lunch yesterday.&nbsp; I'm really excited about everything and can't wait to get to my prefecture,&nbsp;though I'm going to miss being around all the other jets and having English conversations. Tonite, a group from my prefecture is going out for dinner and to get to know each other, so I look forward to that.&nbsp; So I've been taking some videos and&nbsp;digital pics and when I get to Niigata and get hooked up on the web and get to my luggage with my USB cord then I'll get those on the site.&nbsp; I still have some pics of my fish in their new home, and people at the jam, and family, and friends, and JETs and interesting looking people in Tokyo.&nbsp; Everyone has been very nice here, both the Japanese and the other JETs so it has been a good experience and I feel proud of what I'm doing, as in I feel like I'm finally doing a job that will make a difference in peoples lives and give some school kids some good memories of an American gaijin.&nbsp; My roommate is also going to Niigata and her name is Mary and she's from Mississippi.&nbsp; I love everyone at home, but luckily things have been so busy here (being&nbsp; bombarded with like 20 books to read) that I haven't had any time to feel lonely.&nbsp; I've gotta go run to another meeting now ya'll so I'll write more later. Je matta!

      Ohayo Gozaimasu!&nbsp; I'm in Atlanta about 1am in the hotel room with roomate Grace and her mom.&nbsp; We have a great view of the airport and can watch the jets take off out of our window.&nbsp; I saw my good friend Elaine tonite who lives in Atlanta tonite.&nbsp; I haven't seen her for a few years now and it was great to hang out.&nbsp; We looked at a bunch of pictures we took in India when we went on the trip back in May 2001.&nbsp; I had my last bit of beer and pizza and starbuck's coffee tonite so now I'm ready.....bring on the raw fish!&nbsp;&nbsp;5 or so in the morning and get ready and go to the airport and do check in, and the plane leaves at 10am.&nbsp; Then it 's off to Detroit then switch planes and go to Tokyo.&nbsp; I can't wait!&nbsp; I was saw off by many wonderful people today.&nbsp; Barbara and Jim came over and gave me hugs and Chuck calle d and wished me luck from all, and Mom and Dad said bye to me, then Phil kindly took me all the way to Atlanta after driving from Rock Hill and even brought me my favorite food in the world.... delicious cream cheese cinnamon rolls from Durango's Bagel.&nbsp; It's ben hard to say goodbye to everyone as I start this new adventure.&nbsp; But really it's not goodbye, it's just dewa matta, or see you later.&nbsp; I hope I might get home for a visit around Christmas and get everybody back in line. So to quote bad Laurens slang-English, "Keep skrait ya'll!" And send me a gosh durned email once in awhile, it makes me smile!

      I'm finally typing this on my laptop! Hooray for tech support!&nbsp; Today's been busy and most of it I didn't even leave the house.&nbsp; The hard drive came in the mail(though ended up I probly didn't need it), then online with the tech, then making peach preserves, packing, dying my hair kinda blonder with mom, cleaning up for company, installing software on computer, trying to look decent after being a shut in slob all day. My good buddy, Michael, came down from Rock Thrill to hang out with me one last time before my trip.&nbsp; I enjoyed a bowl of caramel coffee at the Coffee Underground in Greenville and a cream cheese fudgy brownie (yes it was as rich as it sounds!&nbsp; Good thing I had help with it.) I'm almost done packing.&nbsp; I hope to pick up some grits in town tomorow.   The gritsblogger must have grits!&nbsp;    Now I'm working on getting all my music onto my ipod, soooo tired, but music must prevail! I only have tonite and tomorow left to do.......

      I'm starting to feel like that quirky fan boy from   Almost Famous,   cause I keep saying to myself, "It's all happening!" Well, at least most of it is. I'm nearly packed and I've only got a few more things to do.&nbsp; Tomorow is moving day for my lovely fish, Bubba, Pearl, and Saki.&nbsp; They have been very good fish (they never complain!) and I wish them the best of luck in their new home at my mother's work place at the Assessor's office.&nbsp; Her boss will be taking good care of them. Now we will see what the lifespan of a petsmart goldfish is as&nbsp;I've already had the trio since November. Ganbare mina!   The only bad luck I'm having is with the new Dell.&nbsp; Got my new laptop but then the screen wouldn't load up after the Windows startup page. So after 2 hours of tech support (mostly on hold) the dude tells me he'll send me another hard drive. This was Friday. Today is Tuesday. No hardrive yet. Friday I go to Atlanta. I'm getting a bit antsy.   Other than that, I'm just getting around to see folks and gather hugs (like hokey anime has a jiggle counter, maybe I should have a huggle counter :)&nbsp;   Saturday Marshall held a great going away jam at his house.&nbsp; People who came: Ken, Cathy, Ronnie, Gail, Briggs, Nancy, John Fowler and his friend (was it Brian?), Andy Brooks, Lo and Mary, Danny, and of course Marsh and me.&nbsp; Gail made a killer cake... it was so moist and fluffy it about jumped off the plate before it got there. Also had some good garden fresh stuff, like Nancy's cucumber salad... mmmm, tastes like summer.&nbsp; And where the food was good, the music was mighty fine.&nbsp; Ken and Gail kicked off the first few tunes, both new and favorites of mine, and Andy rocketed away on some jammin pieces. Danny told stories about being in France for 2 years and Ken and Ronnie discovered they were siamese twins (joined at the cooler).&nbsp; Gail also taught Mary and me beautiful waltz fiddle duet.&nbsp; Fun was had by all, and some people were still having fun even after I left (had to go to TN the next morning).   Oh by the way   I GO TO JAPAN IN 4 DAYS!     &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      Two weeks until Tokyo, and only 12 days til I go to Atlanta are left. I've been getting ready though, folks.   Dude I got a Dell!  A cool little laptop. Not the absolute top of the line but pretty good for what the financing would allow! It'll still be running a bajillion times faster than my old desktop from before I started college. Also got the book "Making out in Japanese," which has to do with much more than making out.  I just had to get it after watching the making of trailer on "Lost in Translation" where Bill Murry using the book and was saying "Dare-ni mukatte mono itten dayo?" to everyone he met, (which means "Who do you think you're talking to?"), and asking the sushi chefs if they used protection. If you haven't seen the movie and want to see some pretty views of Tokyo, see an out of the normal affair/love story, and see some humor about the Japanese, then you should get a pizza and rent it tonite. However, it is done from a foreigners point of view on Japan and pokes some fun with that, so be forewarned about forming opinions of Japanese people based on this movie. Also, I learned how to play Texas Hold 'Em Poker today.  I need to work on my poker face! Oyasumi!

        ONLY 16 DAYS! (and 16 is my lucky number). So I thought today would be the perfect time to start my own kick *ss web page. Everyone should have a blog! I've been packing and shopping and studying and worrying and getting excited and emailing alot. How is there so much left to do? I got some new tapes for my vid recorder today so I'll be putting up some digi pics eventually. I hope I can get a laptop. It would make keeping up with this blog alot easier in Tokyo/Oshima!

      Hey everyone, I just popped onto my site to find a new picture there that just showed up on its own of my brother, Bryce with his auto show contest trophy. Okay, so maybe it didn`t show up on it`s own, maybe my mom posted it on my site instead of hers, but that`s cool. She`s got a few pictures going on already and I want to see the pictures of what you did to your hair mom! Is it drastic?  So today around noon I decided I would get out of the apartment and take a break from studying for awhile, and go see my town. I would drive over to Joetsu, but I figured alot might be closed on Sunday. As a matter of fact, I`ve been dying to try the little cafe at the train station by my apato, Cafe Cloud, but unfortunately it was closed. So I first went exploring. I found where the Niibori Guitar School is. Tara, the first ALT who was here who was from Ireland, she took lessons at the school. I also found a park with these shiny metal bent rod sculptures and a stream of water running through it. It was kind of fun. There was a mom and her kindergarten age son there, so I worked up the confidence to say "Konniciwa, Ii tenki desu ne?" Which is "Good day, nice weather isn`t it?"  With that confidence and racing my bike down a few hills (there are plenty around here, the hard part is going UP them!), I decided to go into the convenience store and browse. I found out that those trash bags for sorting your trash are in fact something you have to buy (though I had a bag of each at my apato when I moved in), so now I don`t have to ponder where to get those. I looked at some manga and magazines, then I bought a vanilla ice cream box, some Toppo (chocolate filled pretzel sticks), and talked to the lady who ran the store, or rather she talked to me. Of course she spoke in Japanese, and I was pleasantly surprised after I got past my first thought which is "oh no Japanese, I don`t understand" to it slowly registering that she was telling me that her son was in school, 6th grade I think, so I`ll probably be teaching him. I should really practice conversations more with people who speak absolutely no English, but I feel like my vocabulary is too small at the moment to try to get away with it, unless we`re talking about the weather.  So now I`m really and truly feeding myself. I went to the grocery store, Narus, in Uragawara last night. It was down to the choices of straight peanut butter without bread, plain spaghetti without sauce, udon noodles, or rice, or grits in my apato and nothing was sounding that good anymore, so I had to go shopping. Happily I bought both Japanese and normal food so I can go either way, eggs and bread and OJ for asagohan, bento for lunch at work, or a sandwich or spaghetti and coffee latte for dinner. Talking like this makes me think of Scarlett O`hara`s words "With God as my witness, I`ll never go hungry again!" Um, not that I`ve really ever gone hungry. A little hungry yesterday, but nothing a little reheated chicken and some noodles couldn`t help. I want to make the folks here some Southern style breakfast sometime. Maybe someone could send me some biscuit or cornmuffin mix.  Oh yeah, you can also get Aquafresh at the grocery, but only in a small tube. I was happy. I also got stuff to wash my dishes, wash my clothes, and condition my hair (I thought the water here felt kind of soft, but it really seems to be rough on my hair).  I`ve also been pondering things like getting sleepy after every meal.... did I always feel that way, or is that new to being here? Of course yesterday it was raining and I had a headache so I was kind of tired and sedate anyway. Also, beds in Japan (where there ARE beds in Japan) are really really hard, even with the extra futon mattress on mine I keep waking up with a crick, or a cramped shoulder, so today I pulled out a futon (really heavy and stuffed with down I think) that`s somewhat firm, but floppy, so on top of everything it feels pretty good, you almost sink in. So it`s airing out today.  So good work to Bryce and Chuck at the car show.  Check out mom`s site that`s  urlLink http://scmitchells.blogspot.com  , and more fun tomorow.  Same jap time, same jap channel.  Matta ne.

      So the trip to Niigata-shi was awesome.  It was kind of a nice break, to speak next to no Japanese for 2 days straight.  There were workshops on teaching with games in class and ice breaker activities.  There were regional workshops where we met fellow ALTs and learned where things were, such as Japanese classes and the movie theater in Joetsu.  We watched a video on Niigata prefecture and its many splendors.  There is a theater group that is doing an amateur version of a musical Peter Pan, that I may try out for.  They just meet on some weekends to practice.  I had fun with some guys and gals out shopping for the last few hours, where I got a cool skirt and Mr. Bubble, the elephant ball, and a kids manga for practice reading (okay okay so its for personal enjoyment as well!).  I made some great girlfriends over in Joetsu to hang out with, and bunches of people to see next week at the Kodo Earth Festival on Sado Island.  It should be way wicked awesome.  I bonded more with my supervisor on the way home as we stopped for hot dogs and fish sandwiches, and let me tell you hot dogs in Japan are not the same as a hot dog in America!  They look similiar, but the sausage is different, and the chili is made mostly out of tomato sauce.  We exchanged our favorite bands and listened to my ipod on the way back home too.  You know, Japan is really  awesome, and everyone should come for a visit.  You`ll remember this colorful place for a long time a comin`.

      Today is O-Souji, or Special Cleaning Day here at the office.  Being afraid of heights, of course I found myself hanging out of windows and cleaning them.  Yesterday, Ako invited me to go to Joetsu to go shopping with her.  It was much much much fun.  Guess what I got!  I am now a girl in yukata! Gaze upon lovely photos below... It`s got bunnies on the fabric!  Cute, ne? Also, got some fluffy towels and some other stuff at the hyaku en store plus some udon and sauce and caramels.  Also got some　t-shirts with some really bad Engrish on them.  Engrish is what happens when a non-english speaking country tries to use English words to look cool, without researching how to spell, or maybe even what they mean when you put it all together. Anyway, the results are usually hilarious.  These t-shirts were actually made in China but sold over here.  When I saw them, I just had to see them, as Engrish seems kind of collectable, and makes an English speaking person look at it and say, huh? So anyway it`s fun.  Also, saw an onigiri key chain thing in a vending machine and thought well I`ll put a coin in and see if I get that one, and what do you know, I did! So onigiri man appears below.  He had a conversation with Ako on the car ride home.  He said things like "my mother lives in a rice bowl," and "I`m delicious!"  Okay, so we were really REALLY tired after all that shopping. It might have made us a bit silly. Maybe. Then again, maybe  that`s just in our personalities.  I also demonstrated to the office today that I can do the voice of Golem from Lord of the Rings.  Creep, ne?  So tomorow I go to Niigata city for a ALT Jet program prefectural orientation. So I may not be on the email for 2 days or so.  This blog too, may go without for 2 days, but fear not, I`ll be back with new pictures of my Niigata-shi adventure. Props to those people who have been emailing me.... Michael, Ken Stott, John Fowler, Mom, Shinichi Shoji my Japanese teacher from Winthrop, Barbara, Aunt Joan.  To my old time friends, I hope you had a good time at Clifftop.  I wish I had been there, but next year we`ll jam out.  Keep checkin` in folks. Love and Peace!

      My remote control for the air conditioner. This one is the most frustratin`.  The pink one turns it on/off, some of the others control the temperature, and the direction of air, and the force of air. I think there`s a timer too. Sigh.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      This is the panel to heat the water.  If you push the green button it turns on and starts heating.  If you push the middle pink button it fills up the tub. I really don`t remember what the other two do.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      My first bento!  I stayed up last night and made it.  Bento means boxed lunch and there are many different shaped boxes made of plastic or wood.  My bento has a tomato, omelet, cucumber and onigiri.  I already ate one onigiri before this picture. The best part about lunch here, is that everyone takes a nap afterward. You just get a short futon and pillow and blanket out of the closet and spread out on the floor for 30min to an hour.  I`m still sleepy though.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      Yesterday was Saturday, and a free day for me.  So what better time to go exploring my enviroment, ne?  I tried to go to the mountains to Shobu Kogen, but I either got lost or the road was closed, cause I didn`t get there.  So I went and checked out Hotaru Road, which is known for the hotaru (fireflies) that can be seen there on a good night.  There`s this awesome bridge and a whole park with two ponds and a gazebo and some places to sit down, and even an outhouse.  When I walked to the end of the road in the park, I came to another road, so I decided I`d walk down it and see what was there.   I decided this would be my photographic pilgrimage and I would see it through. Though, after about 20 minutes of sweat pouring down my face and stopping to pry the jeans off my legs and roll them up, I began to ponder how good of an idea this was.  I felt I should go a bit further though, so up up up I went and it began to cool off, and some clouds came over and I found some beautiful landscapes.  After about 45 minutes of walking, I decided, well that`s enough of that and it might rain, so I hot footed it back to the park.   I decided to do some more driving after that (my first day with my car), and first stopped by a little graveyard I spotted on a hillside.  Then it was off to find another adventure, and somehow or another I ended up in Yasazuka town, where there is this big ski resort.  Then into the next town of Sugawa.  Unfortunately, I don`t have a good map of the area, but I did have alot of gas and some free time.  Luckily I got back home after making only a few wrong turns (this is not a new thing just in Japan, I did this back home too).  I had a bit of a headache after all the walking and getting lost, so I made some onigiri and took a nap.  Then, at 6:30 or so, Yoshida-sensei was calling for me to come out and ride over to the night walk starting line.  Disoriented and sleepy, I grabbed my onigiri, a hand towel and some tennis shoes and ran out the door.  This night walk is one of the many events in Oshima-mura and I thought it was a great idea to get to hang out with some people and see the area, and get some exercise.  Except this walk was about 15km!  And I was already tired!  I managed to stick it out through all 3 legs of the walk and make it sore and worn out to the cookout afterwards where I felt much better after gobbling down meat and veggies and beer.  In summer, apparently, there are many parties and cookouts and events to drink beer.  Good thing I like beer.  So today I don`t feel much like moving anywhere.  I did finally come down to the office to post this blog just cause I was tired of being in my apato.  A hot bath and another nap helped a bit, but I still feel worn out.  I`ll be sleeping good tonite.  A special shout out to Phil, who is 22 today, Happy Birthday.

      Tatsuo-san also played his pink elephant guitar at the tabiniku party after the walk.  Leg pain and foot pain and general tiredness can be cured with grilled shrimp and scallps and sausage and some yummy tomatoes and kuri and beer and good music. He plays the rolling stones and John Denver and the Eagles.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      It`s my car! Tiny ain`t it? It`s super fun to drive though and really saves on gas, cause I drove all over these hills and barely moved the gas guage. Sweet! For scale I put my video camera on top of it.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      I drove around yesterday, my first day to drive the car.  So of course I went exploring.  Somehow I made it to the next town over, Yasazuka town. There is a big ski resort there, and these snowmen statues, and pictures of these guys are on everything.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink
