      To all those who don't know where i am or what i've been upto, myy computer literacy is limited. So a computer geek put me onto this set where i've my own webpage to form a diary and comunicate with everyone. I expect there are numerous of these about all with differing items and if anyone can put me onto one that can upload photos that would be cool. I thought this would be an easier way to connect with people.  Anyway, as most of you will know by now, i've been offered a position at Ashfield Municpal Council in Sydney. It's a sponsorship deal with all the minor details to be finalised in the near future. I've already put my name down for a flat share with a lovely young lady. The two bedroom apartment is about 15 mins walking distance away from work, and only 5 minutes away from the train station. Ashfield is roughly 15mins train journey from Sydney centre, so the world is my oyster.  Am still at the Balmian Backpackers (3 months) have just finished my cleaning duties in the hostel, but am continuing with hostel reception work until i leave. The hostel is pretty much empty, its low season and a bit chilly, especially at night, and few people are staying. Many of the people that i've spent my time with here are slowly leaving, must be the impression i had on them!!!!! Many have gone up north to warmer climates.  Am very much looking to moving into my flat and starting work..............how sad does that sound!!!!!  England have been poor in the sport department recently, we're getting roasted at rugby, its a tad depressing!!!! Soccer was a bit disappointing, probably an understatement. The referee was a shocker!!!

      Right then, having been around to my new apartment again last night i am moving in either Monday or Tuesday of next week. It's ensuite and the lady im living with is sweet. Lena goes away for a week on friday and she's left me incharge of the flat!!!! Seems like a perfect opportunity for a huge house warming bash.......possibly not, who am i kidding!!  Bought a futon this week and sheets/pillows etc with the help of Aunty Liz's husband - Michael. They have been a great help with everything, by sorting me out with some necessity items and giving me help moving my stuff.  Start my job on Wednesday 7th and really looking forward to it. Going in on Tuesday to meet everyone and go around Ashfield with my new employer.........great  Will be sad to leave the hostel, but a fresh, new look will be good. Had a great time here and have met some great people and will definitely recommend the hostel to the long term resider in Sydney, the family/student atmosphere is great.  Miss the karaoke at the ..................oooooooooooo welcome to the Red Lion Hotel.........and the cheapest pizzas in the world from Pizza Haven, plus the Indian/Thai/Chinese takeaways, not that i've frequented them too often.  Will endeavour to keep in touch with most of the people and everyone should keep me updated on your travels and, of course the gossip!!!!!  Went ice skating for the first time in years the other day, another bit of useless information  ciao
