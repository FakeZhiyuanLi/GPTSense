      Everyone wonders why i am so tired, why i am developing dark circles under my eyes. Lets see, its 2:32 and i am still awake. i've been laying in bed for two hours, trying to sleep, with no luck. i'm supossed to go to dinner this evening, but right now, i just can't get any rest, i won't be able to. i am out of medicine, i'm now out on my last limb, i would do anything for a a pain killer right now, just anything to make it bearable. Even typing this is difficult, but i need someone to talk to, keep my mind off all this. It's been a pretty good day today, fairly relaxed, slept a little, still tired, but sleep will come, i am sure. My older brother's friend is still over, him and my two brothers, and Kyle stay up playing video games until god know's when, that also makes it hard to sleep. i just toss and turn. Restless. i'm listening to Finger 11 right now, usually music soothes me and makes me finally fall asleep, but even that doesn't help. i'm gonna go, give it another shot. Night.

      Ok, so i know i was going to finish my post from this morning, but i'm feeling quite a bit better, so i dont really see a need to. i went for a two hour walk and then i took a long nap, after that i baked cupcakes, and now, im pretty much ready to head to work. There is still some things that i need to sort out, and i certainly need to find a way to de-stress and relax, but, i'm getting there.  i have this sunday off work, which is wonderful. Also, i'm going out to dinner on Saturday and i'm really excited to put on my outfit and see the whole thing come together, i absolutely love the heels i bought. Then on Monday, its back to work, which isn't so bad, i should have just $500 (perhaps just under, but im sure i can find something extra to do for that extra little boost) by mid august, and thats my deadline, so i'll be really happy to meet that. it's so incredibly hard to save, but i'm doing alright. Absolutely no one has been on msn all day, so i've been sorta bored, work will be alright thou, its only 4 hours, and i have my discman with me, i'm sure i will find something to do. This morning i took a shower and it was just amazing, perfect pressure and heat, i loved it. Anywayz, should be going to work now. :) michelle

      Everytime i finally think that maybe i've gotten things cleared up, and as uncomplicated as things get in my life, everything manages to twist and buckle under the pressure, and then it's all screwed up again. i can't even begin to count all the mistakes i've made in life. The next one just feels so entirely awful, that i can't even begin to comprehend it, or even start sorting it out. i want to fall beneath all the pain and hardships, and just stay there, suffocating in my own mess. Damn, i'll finish this later... Must dash.

      This summer has become very crazy, the whole thing of summer romances, summer flings. It's just all so confusing. :S First, there's still Kyle, managing to still squeeze himself in after so long, after so many fights, after so much pain. There is good memories there too thou, and he was my first love after all, how could i leave? Last summer, wasn't like this, i did go out with a guy, but it wasn't just a fling to me, he really meant something to me, first time i ever got dumped too...i was so heartbroken. Time heals all, i no longer question why it happened, i cherish the memories, live and learn. This summer has been really good, i've met some wonderful people, gone on some spectacular dates, came out with a better self-image towards myself. Problem is, i care about each and every person i have met, and each of them are different. However, im not ready to commit to anyone. It leaves some people hurt, thats not my mission, i hate hurting people more then anything. Its inevitable in something like this thou. Sometimes i think i need isolation. Just to sort things out. One more year of high school, and then i plan to move away, then things will be easier. i will be counting down the days until then. i've been working really hard at saing money. If only money wasn't an issue, then everything would be perfect.

      So many times i try to bury painful memories, instead of staring them in the face, i cover them up, put on a false smile and move on. Or try to. Continuing on in my journey of life, the pain only rears it's ugly head, tearing me down. Making me want to give up, curl up and stay. Not moving on, not falling behind, just...there. Many times i wish i could be void, null, with no emotions, just existing. Numerous people have told me that burying past events doesnt help, to me, it does, to a certian extent. Now, i don't recall everything about it, i just remember bits and pieces. i remember being pounced on, i remember the pain of it, and i remember clawing at the carpet to get away, thats what i remember most vividly, my nails raking across the floor, pulling myself away under his weight. After that, i just remember crying, curling up and crying. i've forgiven the person, i've tried moving on, but the memories still haunt me, i still wake up scared. Perhaps after writing this, finally sharing it, i can move on. i know that it will still hurt, but atleast i will heal, understand it wasnt my fault. It wasn't. He has apologized to me so many times, i'm numb to it now. What's done is done. i'd rather not talk about it, thats like reliving it. It could of been a lot worse. i'm lucky.

      i just woke up a while ago, i love summer, i can just get out of bed as slowly as i want. i'm not one of those people who are driven to get up, just to get the first cup of coffee in their system, that jolt of energy. Actually, im not a huge fan of coffee, and i'm most certainly not really a morning person, i need to get up atleast an hour or two early, before i actually do something, so i can sit and relax, and adjust slowly, sleeping in and hopping out of bed is my worst nightmare. >. Hehe, thats cute. i was going to wake up this morning and go for a run, but it's looking pretty gloomy out, so perhaps i'll stay home and just do pilates or something. Last night before i went to sleep i lifted some light hand weights and did lots of crunches, and an excercise thats good for the legs, i dont know what its called, it was good, slept good. i have the day off today, i have a huge urge to go spend money...can't. Must resist. i'm stressed out, i think today i should make some time to meditate. Or take a nap, both sound good, maybe both. :P i feel like i'm stuck in the middle of a huge mess, like im a little plush toy, and people are tearing me apart, for my attention. For me. What happens when someone wants to change you, instead of praising the good things Your do, instead they focus upon what You should do better, Your flaws, what You lack. What happens when someone&nbsp;focuses so much on what they want, and what You don't have, that everything You look in the mirror, the reflection stares back at you. Mocking. Seems so be saying that your not perfect, and you aren't good enough. i hate mirrors, i avoid them when possible. Everyone tries to tell me what to do with my life. Where i should go. Everyday is a struggle. Things feel unrealistic, wrong in a lot of senses. So many hours i spend just thinking, wondering, am i really being true to myself, is this what i really want? Maybe everything is a lie, and i'm even fooling myself. Foolish me...

       urlLink http://www.angelrays.com/Cards/moon/in/you.html   i dont really have anything to say today. i'm not really feeling like really writing. Poetry seems like a good topic, i have some of my own, perhaps i will share it in time. i've been thinking about how superficial people are, how shallow our society has sunk, its sad. i would rather not think about it, but its something that is there, that is all around You. people shunned because of what they look like, what they wear, what they act like , ever who they are friends with.  Cliche. For all of those people who are feeling down...Carpe Diem (or is that ei? either or, You know what i mean) In summary, this has been a pretty good day, yes, pretty good. i ate too much at lunch, felt rather ill, but instead of complaining, i should be happy that i actually have enough food that i can eat so much i feel like im gonna explode...which at the moment, was a thought that i embraced. i wore heels today, for what? so i can be 3 inches taller? no...not that, i like being short, i just like the way they look, and they are actually excellent on the legs, and posture to a certain extent. However, now i have a blister on the bottom of my foot, makes me want to cry. i had a good cry a few days ago, it wasnt out of pain, or anxiety, or fear, or happiness...i just cried. a cleansing. Does anyone notice how wonderful it smells after a good rain, how that rainbow peeks out, how the birds greet the sun? That how it felt, i felt way better, clean again, it washes away all my hatred and anger and sadness, and leaves me with a clean slate.  Thats it for today.

      i've wasted a lot of time tried numerous times but, many times, life overwhelms me, and i just begin to take myself forgranted, forgeting the most important thing. How often do i really spend just reflecting? thinking back on past decisions? too much i think, too many minutes tick by, only half paying attention myself. Am the only person who has seriously thought about giving up? i highly doubt it, once, i nearly did. i consider myself very lucky to be here today to be honest, to just be able to type is a miracle. Not many people know.  i dont talk about myself very often, its always about someone else. When i do fall, its bad, i fall as deep as a person can get, and somehow, i still manage to dig deeper. my thoughts run together, never-stopping, ever flowing, perpetual....how long is perpetual? forever, but how long is forever really? Where do we go after it's all played out? Everyday is different, i dont like planning ahead, i dont like feeling committed, attatched to a previous agreement, what if something happens? What if when i wake up the next morning, i cant bear to face the world, cant stand the thought of having to put on a fake smile and pretend. Remember the song "Barbie Girl" (the one the seeped into Your mind, and played over and over again?) How true is that song. How many of us are walking around, molded plastic of stereotypes and media images of what is correct, what is beautiful. How many of us hide behind pretty clothes, and expensive cars. Credit cards and plastic smiles. If You were to walk down the street, how many people do You think You could actually say was being genuinely themselves? i think i could count them on merely one hand. i'll leave it at that tonight, i tend to ramble, what i say may be some pretty meaningful stuff, but You have to sift through the nonsense first. michelle

      It's difficult in times like these, ideals, dreams, and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. It's a wonder i haven't abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet i cling to them because i still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.  It's utterly impossible for me to build my life on a foundation of chaos, suffering, and death. i see the world slowly being transformed into a wilderness. i hear the approaching thunder that, one day, will destroy us too, i feel the suffering of millions. And yet, when i look up at the sky, i somehow feel everything will change for the better, that this cruelty too will end, and peace amd tranquility will return once more.                      -Anne Frank, in her diary, July 15th, 1944  It's amazing how this was written so very long ago, yet somehow, people can still relate to her thoughts.  i don't know, i guess that's how i feel right now, pretty hopeless. i don't know why this sudden turn for the worse. i'm struggling to keep happy...i just don't know anymore. i'm hoping with the new school year, things will settle down.  Sometimes it's a flash flood. Other times it comes on like a slow-building rainstorm, the kind that gives You enough warning you might even have time to get inside before the clouds burst. Once it starts, there it nothing You can do but let the sorrow pound You like the most powerful current, the strongest waterfall. When the sorrow hits, small losses come crashing over You in one suffocating torrent.  i'm trying so hard to keep from feeling like this. It's as if i've fallen overboard and spend so much time working at getting back in, when i finally manage to pull myself back into the boat, it turns out that the boat has a giant leak.  :( michelle

      Ok, so maybe that is a bit of an exaggeration, but, pretty close. i woke up this morning feeling pretty good, my parents made me breakfast, and i had time to chat online for a bit before work. Yup, even Nathan. i've been feeling somewhat lost lately, not really knowing what to do with myself, but it is getting better, and i'm slowly healing, what a recovery! :D Anywayz,  chatting got me somewhat down, nothing is very sure right now, but he came to see me this morning, and reassured me, im gonna be ok. i need to trust, and i need more patience, two things which i need to work on, and i will. i'm going to his house later tonight, he doesnt get off work until nine, but that's not so bad, summer is winding down, super fast, i dont wanna go to school anymore, i'm done, i quit. Hey, i still have those cartoons to watch, well, maybe tonight, yuppers. Oh yea, and i've been getting all these weird bumps on my hands and i couldnt figure out where they were coming from, well i solved the mystery, the crickets have been stinging me. :( that sucks. Anywayz, ive got nothing else to say, work was pretty good today, flew by, must go again tomorrow. :( :D:D:D michelle

       urlLink http://yamauchi.selwerd.nl/~d3/midigame/   Hey hey, Just have been wandering around, got close to 5 hours of sleep last night, but, im feeling pretty awake right now, my gecko is now sleeping, he seemed to be scurrying for shade so i put him away again. New things for him will be expensive but after that, it'll be alright, im not sure how putting a timer on the light exactly works, but i'm sure that's included in some sort of instructions. i'll put him on the same sleeping pattern as me, well, for school. Other then that i went to the mall and wandered for a while, and played video games, yuppers, its been an alright day. Oh, and the link is a game, a bunch of snippets of video game songs, and You say where its fun, yup, i've spent some good times playing that, good for when feeling bored. i talked to Kyle last night, it was really tough, it took me a long time to actually say something, i freeze up when there something important to be said, i just didnt want to break the news, he held my wrists and yelled until i actually spit someting out, of course he was angry with me, but i think its going to be ok. i'm really going to miss being held, and that sort of stuff. All self doubt and anxieties sink in. i'm feeling alone, like i dont belong anywhere. Things are going to be ok thou, i didnt lose a friend, things will be ok with time, it'll just take some adjusting. i'm feeling inspired, life's a twisted road that we unwind. Yuppers, things are pretty good right now, i just wish someone was online so that i had someone to talk so, i have to work tomorrow, and i'm really not looking forward to that. :( Nope, not at all. Hmm...even then, it should be ok thou. School is starting again pretty quick, and let me tell You, i am certainly not looking forward to that, then i'll have like no time to do what i want, stupid school. Hmph. Well, it's only one more year, then i am not exactly sure what i am going to be doing. Anywayz, i think i should be going :) later, michelle

      Good afternoon to all, yuppers, i slept great last night, feeling very well rested, its super. mmhmm, so i woke up and then i went to the mall, blew the rest of my money, atleast i'll be looking fine eh'? i got the coolest hat, yes, i quite like it. i think i am going to have to save up for glasses now. We'll just see. i feel at peace with myself today, i feel happy, yes, it is quite a wonderful feeling, been a long time i've felt so content. i wish i was a bit older, i would like to go clubbing, i want to dance, i want to express myself, perhaps i will paint this evening, i just love working with watercolors. i think more then dancing i want to sing thou, i wish i hadnt quit my lessons, i was getting better and better, its a gift, i should use it. He plays the guitar, perhaps i can convince him to play something if i sing. i'm shy about singing for other people. i feel modest about it, everyone says im really good, but You can't really hear what You sound like to other people, so its hard to say. We'll just have to see. Kyle comes home tonight, i'm feeling nervous about that, pretty anxious thou, i wish i could just get it over with. i played with his lizard, Dino, as i have dubbed him, i took him out and everything, he likes me, he didnt try to bite, his tummy feels funny, and he's claws feel like pins and needles like when You limb is waking up again. He's so adorable thou, i like him, i am going to read up on how to take care of them etc. Hey, Kyle is giving him away, i think i am going to take him, shout out to Damon, wanna help me build a new home for him? Well, i think thats about it for today. michelle

      Today i woke up early just so i could clean up, and have my house looking more ship-shape. Lol, it was alright, and i painted figurines with Kyle's little sister, Kaiden, must say, i actually had fun. Then i took a really long bath and totally relaxed. By then, i was already feeling pretty nervous,  i did my hair, and then did my make-up, and finally got dressed, i was ahead of time by like 15 minutes, so i laid in bed. i was feeling really nervous by then, but, it was good, he introduced himself to my parents, and then we went to dinner. It took forever to get a table, and the waiting was no good, we talked, which is always nice, finally we sat down and ordered, and while we waited, i kept the converstation going. He seemed to be satisfied to listen to me ramble on, and i had a lot of fun, the food was really good, and then we went for a walk, i hate misquitos, that sucked, but other then that, even that was great, the park was beautiful. Then we just sat in the truck and talked. Which is probably one of my favorite parts of the night, i like just talking, being totally open and honest. Yes, all in all, it was wonderful. But this entry is getting pretty boring to write. GTG

      i feel upset alone, and upset, i dont know what to do, i feel like i need someone to talk to i feel like everything i do is a mistake, i feel like all i do is screw up, i like everything is just one huge fuck up. i let my temper get the best of me, and yelled at someone i really care about, now they are really angry with me. im sorry i didnt mean to be angry, and hurtful. i didnt mean to be cynical and sarcastic. i miss like ive been pushing people away. im so stubborn. No wonder people leave me... i feel like i should just be more docile, and just do everything im told, to not fight it. Somehow that feels wrong, but, because i don't, i am filled with such heartache.

      Last night after going out for good ol' junk food and such, me and Kyle settled down to watch Butterfly Effect, it was such an amazing movie, i really enjoyed it, however, it did make me feel uncomfortable. i wish that i could go back and change some things in my life, it made me think, and it took me a really long time to settle down enough to fall asleep.  i wanted Kyle to stay after he tucked me in, but he couldn't. Since Kyle left this afternoon to camp, im going to really miss that, it's one of my favorite parts of the day. i get to take care of his lizard this week, im gonna try and make it nice, so its not mean and bites people, i dont like his lizard much. My back is so incredibly sore today:( But, other then that, today was pretty good, all in all. But, im getting bored of writing so i'm gonna go.

      Hey hey all! :P Today has certainly been a different day, i slept in a good deal, and stayed in my pj's for a while too, then i finally got my act together and went over to Kyle's. Of course they dragged me along shopping, but my stomach wasn't happy with me, and decided i shouldn't be there, so i went home feeling sick. From there on, i laid on the couch and watched tv. Then i decided to do my nails in a new color. Finally i felt good enough to actually get up, and i did my mom's hair for her. My parents left me to go out, so im feeling kinda lonely this evening, have had a lot of time to dwell on things. :( i moped around for a while, then decided to do a 30 minute work out, so now im tired, and somewhat more toned, but still feeling sick. Its not fair. i want someone to take care of me, and make me supper. hmph. So, all in all, its been an alright day, i just wish my tummy thought the same. :S Anywayz, i should get going.

      Lately has been just awful, i havent been able to sit still for very long for quite some time. i'm bored and antsy, i dont enjoy doing things i used to. i ever feel restless as i write this, but i have nothing better to do with myself. i don't feel like hanging out with people, i dont feel like watching tv, or eating, or sleeping, i just don't know whats wrong. i don't want to be held, and i cry for no reason, why am i so moody? However, i know it well pass, so i'm just trying to get through it slowly. i'm getting used to working, the time just seems to fly by, and i still feel like i have stuff to do. i'm really surprised that school is starting up again so quickly, it's scary to really think about it, i'm already thinking that i must pull together money to get a yearbook, and such, i just can't comprehend the idea that this is my last year. Then what am i do to with myself? :S Hmm...this is a rather short entry, but i am struggling to think of what to put next. i have been comtemplating things that have happened this summer, and let me tell You, it has most certainly been a crazy summer.  i think i may actually regret some things, and i am afraid of hurting some people, i've been biting my tounge, and waiting for the right moment, but i can't help but wonder, if perhaps my waiting is making it worse. i guess time can only answer that question.

      Yesterday was so great! i woke up and took a shower and just relaxed for a long time there, and then i got dressed at my own pace as i listened to Billy Talent, which was good by me. Then i let myself in to my neighbours house (back door was unlocked) and woke Kyle up, it took him ages to actually drag himself out of bed, and then we went to the mall to check out the new stitches store, looks good, i bought some stuff, and then we had lunch together, which was really nice, and then we looked at video games at EB, and knowing he really liked this one game, i bought it, along with a player's guide. We went back to my house and played for a good 4 hours. By then, i was really tired of playing games, and had quite the headache. i did my nails, and my hair, and got ready to go out. Then Kyle's mom came over and we had to do the dishes, and walk the dog, being the naughty person i am, we only did the glasses at his house, since he always eats at mine, so why should he do dishes, and then while we walked the dog, i loaded her up with slushie. Finally it was time for me to go and meet up with Nathan, we met up and i got to go on his motorcycle, it was so much fun, a little scary at first, but it really was great. Then we headed back to his house, we watched tv for a while to kinda feel more relaxed, and then we did a scene. Which went really well, it was excellent. Then i got home and cooked me and Kyle food at midnight, and we watched tv, and played our game together. When i started rubbing my eyes, he put me to bed. i think thats one of my favorite parts of the day, getting tucked in, i do wish i could be held at night thou. However, that was my day, and it was good. Lets hope today is just as good.

      Well, it's been a few days since i've written here, and it's not that i haven't wanted to, i mean, i have opened it up, and sat here  staring at the stark white screen for quite some time, but i'm just too confused and upset to actually put things into words. So, i', going to try and put it into words. On Saturday, Kyle cancelled on me and i was rather angry, and sad. We had planned to go out to dinner, and then he had to leave. Instead i went to movie, and as good as it was, i felt sick and wasn't able to really pay attention. It was nice spending time with Damon, but i can't help feeling that theres tension there, and things left unsaid. On sunday, i spent hours doing my hair and getting ready, and then we went to dinner, i had a lot of fun, our waitress was so sweet, and i liked talked to her, then we decided to rent a movie, instead of go to one. We watched Saving Silverman, and it was pretty good. On Monday, i woke up, and get ready and watched tv, and ate a pogo, and went to work, and worked till 5, and then i went home and changed, and then i went to The Village, and it wasn't what i expected, but it was really good. Then i came home and laid around till i was put to bed. Today, well today, i hope to get around to cutting a friends hair, and then im going to the mall to check out the new stitches and buy a b-day present for a friend. :D it'll be a good day i think. michelle
