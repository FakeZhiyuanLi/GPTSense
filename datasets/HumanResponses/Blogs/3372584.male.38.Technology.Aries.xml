      Had a pretty good long weekend despite the weather. It was a bit cold and rainy but there where a few bright patches too. Had some rough weather too even a small twister about 20 KM from my house, really small though only an F0, but there was a bigger one further west (about 50KM) that was about an F3. Glad I wasn't anywhere near that one!   Well that's it for now.

       urlLink Myst Worlds  I Just love this game. I have the whole set, Myst, Riven, Myst III Exile, and Uru. Can't wait to see Myst Revelation. The teasers look stunning. They always seem to be at the leading edge of high-end graphics integrated into game play.

       urlLink frontline: cyber war! | PBS  Watched this show about a week ago. Somewhat chilling but not unexpected. I suspect the true measure of how vunerable we are is somewhere in the middle between the nay sayers and the ones saying the sky is falling.  I have been playing and working with computers for nearly 25 years now and I believe that there is a great potential for disaster, how great is hard to measure but I think we could suffer a much more devistating impact financially then 9/11. A large part of our infrastructures rely on the internet, something that was not really designed to be secure, it was designed to allow for the free flow of information and ideas, but we are asking the internet to handle more and more traffic that requires security. Obviously the two ideas clash and we end up with problems.  Large distributed companies used to send their information over closed proprietary networks that only they saw. This in of itself lent a fairly high degree of security, but the internet provided a cheap alternative so the switch was made. Many companies probably began using the internet without a second thought to security, a lot still do. Unfortunatly alot of the time it's not until they get breached in a noticable way that they begin to think about security.  Anyway that's my two cents worth.

      Well this is day two of my foray into the world of blogging. So far I have changed my blogging to be hosted on my own web server. I also downloaded the Google toolbar to assist in picking web pages to add to my blog. I find I tend to get caught up in the whiz bang aspects but tend not to find actual uses for all of the stuff. It's all very neat but so far I am finding this rather pointless.  I guess I am not imaginative enough, or my expectations are to high. Still it's only my second day of playing with this. Maybe I will get into this maybe not.

      I finally decided to try this blogging stuff. I'll see how long this lasts. Well not much more to say at this time. It's now 12:36 A.M. and I need to get some sleep.

                     So much for the bureaucrats attempt at reducing SPAM. I have  only seen an increase in SPAM since the legislation that is supposed to curb and  control SPAM was introduced. If anything it has had the opposite effect. Typical  though when you have lawyers and bureaucrats who have no understanding of what  it is they are trying to legislate making the rules.      &nbsp;    Oh well it is&nbsp;one of the bane's that I must bear being  the assistant&nbsp;M.I.S. (Management Information Systems) manager of two  companies.    &nbsp;

      Almost blew up a printer today. Not a good thing at all. We got a new wide carriage porinter at work to replace an old worn out one. I unhooked the old one and set the new one in place, attached the power cord from the old one (same plugin to the printer) just like on the back of most monitors and computers. Turned it on, it did it's startup self test, all seemed fine, I was about to load the paper when I heard a pop and smoke started to come out of the vents. I quickly turned it off. After tracing the old power cable I discovered that it was hooked into a transformer that steped up the voltage to 220!! I decided to check and see how bad things were by pluging it back into a proper 120 V outlet. Everything seems fine. The printer functions, it's self test works and even prints properly from windows. Just not sure how long it will last.
