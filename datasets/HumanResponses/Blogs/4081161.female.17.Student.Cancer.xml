       I like surfers, but I do not like skaters. Skaters reach another level of annoyance within me that will not cease its wrath. Sure, they are attractive looking specimens but that is not enough to send a wind of calm in the ravaging fire that has become the subject of my rampage.       Skaters are stupid. I speak for the vast majority of them, but I'm sure at least 1.5% are not as incompetent as I presume. When you look up, past their Converses, past their Dickie pants, past their FOX t-shirts, and past their adorable beanies, you will see nothing but ungrateful, whiney, and corruptible behavior. Generally speaking they are but mere suburbian pre-pubescents who construct a paradise of concrete, rebellion, broken teeth. If anyone defies their "paradise" (i.e. parents, the government, "the preps"), they use their Superhuman Powers of Juvenile Insolence in order to get back at those who don't share their shallow and idealistic beliefs.       For example, I know a young man who went to biology class with me a few semesters ago. Everyday he would wear a navy blue kanga hoodie which had the screenprinted words "SKATEBOARDING IS NOT A CRIME." Of course it's not, you unhygenic baboon. However, skateboarding  is  a crime when abandoned lots and pedestrian walk ways clearly state "NO SKATEBOARDING" and yet you go ahead and do it anyway. Has the numerous injuries of past incompetence limited your reading skills?! Read it, BUCK-O. Don't even bring up the point that the government is secretly trying to bend you into its capitalistic tastes, you are just plain dumb. Use your common sense! Why do you think they posted up "no skateboarding" signs? Because you'll hurt someone!! Just as I'm about to hurt you right now!!!       Bikers, however, are almost as bad as skaters, but I guess the engineering flaws of the skateboard are much more flawed than a bicyle thus causing incalculable contusions and needless deaths of precious few braincells, which I doubt would be put into use even if they were rescued by a thousand lifeguards.       /end rant.       Today was rather uneventful. My sister will be gone for seven days. She's in Chicago right now visiting my aunt (my dad's older sister). That means I get the room to myself! Joyous relief. Now I can stay up as long as I want just as long as I go to sleep at ten! I expect to spend intimate hours playing my guitar and reading rejected books from a local high school. Or dancing.       I have taken a keen fancy to dancing lately. It's sort of like a mix between pop dancing, hip-hop dancing, and having a convulsion. Actually, it's not really dancing. It's flailing around like a monkey.            = Cristie

        Hello. If you have found this weblog, it is most likely from my recommendation in real life. I established this so people I know can see what I'm up to without actually having to ask "how are you?" thus saving time, energy, and sanity. I'm not the concise verbal type, so you can sympathize the innocent fool who actually does ask "how are you?" and gets slammed by a three hour speech&nbsp;pertaining to the injustices that are caused in the world, what sort of injustices are caused, and why the people who cause these injustice need to be neutered.      &nbsp;  I'm not sure how often I'm going to post, but it will be fairly frequent. It will mostly be about nothing or weird thoughts that I have during the day. Frequency also correlates to how many people are actually reading this. If no one reads my stupid words, then what use is it  really ? So if you do  indeed  read this, please post a comment or at least tell me. Pictures might be involved somewhat. Depends really.     &nbsp;  I forewarn you,  beware of my bizarre sense of humor quickly.  You will recieve no mercy from me whatsoever. I'll also try not to say bad words.     &nbsp;  Otherwise, let me reintroduce myself. My name is Cristie Pirote. I'm currently seventeen-years-old. I want to have a pet chihuahua so I can name him Mr. C and a pet hamster so I can name him M.C. Hamster.&nbsp;I listen to rock music (like Muse, Radiohead, Stabbing Westerwards, Pearl Jam, The White Stripes... etc). I am a workaholic. I like to draw weird pictures. I like write stories. I like sleeping. I started this blog to save me from boredom&nbsp;wrapped in summer vacation.     &nbsp;  "Getting-To-Know-You" hour is over.&nbsp;Whew. I'm glad. I was afraid we were going to start braiding each other's hair for a moment.     &nbsp;  = Cristie   p.s. Isn't this a great change from all these weird cards/letters I've been sending you people?

       Hi you. Haven't been talking to me lately, have you? Are you angry at me? Please don't be mad. I meant well when I poisoned your drink with anti-freeze. If it's any consolation, I hear anti-freeze really tastes good.       I had a gynormous sinus headache yesterday. I took two tylenol PM pills and that conked me out for about fifteen hours. I woke up somewhere between the eight and tenth hour, but I went right back to sleep. Lately, I've been having so many headaches. I think it's because I'm always outside in the afternoon, sweating my guts off, and I don't drink enough water.       Yesterday was school registration. Nobody except my old algebra teacher recognized me. If I wasn't so tired and typically irritated at waking up, I would've laughed very hard. People whom I've known since forever (probably two to six years) were there but they didn't say hi. That made me sad. Not really. I didn't say hi either because it takes up too much energy.       So yeah. Pretty much it: school registration, tons of homework, headache. Oh. And I'm on the verge of getting myself a job. I won't say much more than that because it's not final yet.       I'm boring myself now. Here's a picture I drew a while ago:          urlLink        Tell me if you can see it. If you don't, I'm sacrificing this computer to the technology gods. I'm sorry about my crappy handwriting ... and the lack of actual humor in this comic strip ... and the bad drawing-ness of the swing chain. I actually made six strips involving these two characters who have no names. I call them the Goth and the Preppy, even though he's not a goth and she's not a prep. Weird.      Have a nice day and try not to trip on the cow on the way out this time okay?       = cristie

      Ow, my sinuses hurt. I'm think I'm slowly getting sick. I always wake up with a sore throat or something. It hasn't completely gone away and it's always there. I don't like remembering to take my vitamins because most of the time I can't.   Today was such a nice day. It was breezy enough, the sun was hardly peeking through the cloudly sky, and it was all around good. It was a nice day to go outside ... and then go back inside ... so you can say "wow, it's nice to go outside" but you never really do. That's what I did. I actually went OUT with Sunday. My sister took my cousin and me to the Florin Mall and the Romano Macaroni Grill.   Florin Mall shouldn't even be called a "mall." It should be called "The Building Where Ghetto Stores Congregate." Half the good stores were closed like Walton's Book Store, K B Toys, and whatnot. JC Penny is closed down, Nordstrom closed a loooong time ago. Sears is still there. We went to Foxnoor, Catwalk, and all the other junior clothing stores where I'm sure local strippers and prostitutes load up on the latest fashions. Arden is doubly better than Florin Mall. I'm not even sure what even holds Florin Mall up. Passed by Happiness Is .. and bought myself a CD wallet for 6.75.   Romano Grill has alright Italian food. Our food took an abnormally long time to arrive so our waiter (a very nice looking thirty-something guy named Vince) and the manager (a not so looking forty-something bald guy who had a terrible sense of humor) came over and apologized profusely for the wait. On all tables were crayons and a paper placemat so dinners could draw to entertain themselves. The waiter and the manger seemed to appreciate my artsy-fartsy interpretation of the olive oil bottle, the pepper shaker, and my glass of strawberry lemonade. Food came and we ate ourselves full. Somehow food tastes better then you're starving. While we were waiting for our dessert, we complimented all the nice-looking waiters and busboys. We teased each other for a good ten minutes about how cute they all were. Y'know, usual girl stuff.   Otherwise nothing else interesting. This post has been boring so far. I think I'll do that later. Right now I have to look at Homestar Runner before lightening strikes me dead.   = cristie

       Greetings, earthwad.       No sugar and no caffiene makes Jack a dull girl named Cristie who sits at the computer all night, trying to squeeze out interesting anecdotes from a mundane life. I think I'll just ramble on and on about nothing-in-particular until something interesting spills out.       Got my bag. I scoured Arden mall for my bag. All the stops: American Eagle Outfitter, Abercrombie & Fitch, Other Stores, and Wilson's Leather Place. I don't even remember. Many stores I went to, vast lands I have traveled, many foreigners I have encountered. Be proud of me, I didn't insult anyone directly. I did find my bag though. A forty-nine ninety-nine leather messenger bag I got at the Wilson Leather Store. I hate cows. They need to die. (I'm kidding.) I got a free water bottle too. That was awesome.       I also got to be on the Channel 3 news. You know how there's the KCRA experience and Walt Gray gives you the news at Arden Mall? I was there. I got to be directly in back of Walt Gray behind the glass thingee and I WAS ON TV. Unfortunately, when the camera shot at me, I was trying to blow spit at my four-year-old cousin. Not an attractive start to a Hollywood career.       I don't like the mall, otherwise known as the Breeding Ground to Conformity. I don't like the stores and I don't like the people in it. I also don't like the fact I never have enough money when I go to the mall. That certainly hinders many things. Like purchasing for example.       = Cristie

       Tomorrow I shall begin the search for a perfect messenger bag. I searched the 'net for some ideas last night (ended up sleeping at two o'clock in the morning) but most of which were around sixty-dollars. Mmm.... I guess a well manufactured bag is a good investment ... right? I have about four hours and the entire Arden mall to accomplish my goal. Let's hope I have enough of patience and an iron tongue not to throw vulgar and creative comments at the slutty-looking consumers of today's brainwashing, capitalist media. My throat hardens whenever they walk past giggling and throwing about random words like "dude" and "Oh my GAWD!!" Uuuuggghhh.       Around two days ago I had my hair chopped off. Not all of it, but it was a good sized trim. It closely resembles the haircut I got the beginning of this summer, but shorter and more pixie-ish. Today I got my new glasses. I look like Uber-Girl Nerd 2000. Just saying the words  uber  and  2000  makes me a nerd even without the glasses. My nerd glasses and short hair makes me look like an effeminate Japanese guy with an oddly shaped chest. I have to try harder to make myself look more feminine, not like anyone cares, but then again what else shall I do with my hard-earned boredom?       Here's my  GAMINE GAMEPLAN  (catchy, no?):       Wear more lipstick.    Simple enough. I can wear the lipstick, it's just a matter of re-applying which I don't do that often enough because I don't bring a mirror around with me. Re-applying lipstick without a mirror means my lack of eye-hand coordination will kick in, and I will look like an absolute moron with lipstick all over my face, consequently with none on my lips where it's supposed to be.      Try not to tell sick jokes as much, if ever.  No more sick jokes, Cristie. My vocabulary and inflection should be that of a good ole Christian gal, not a drunken sailor on crack. No more hanging around demented people with limited vocabulary. For some reason, I feel as though I should not hang around people who welcome hygiene as much as a broken leg. Poor hygiene is a factor that quite possibly affects their verbal deficiency. So if you want to be my friend, please consider using soap once a while. Maybe all the time.     Hang out with girls more.  This is hard. It's not because I don't hang out with girls. I  do  hang out with female companions, but they're not really the type who discuss make-up and boys and whatever it is that females discuss nowadays. It's just that I need some positive, floral scented influences rubbing off on me. I need someone to chagrin me every time I do tell a sick joke. I need someone to compliment my clothing and teach me how to giggle. And no I don't giggle, I  cackle . There's a significant difference.     Accentuate chesticles and other womanly features with skirts.  After/if I get married and have kids, I will not have this curvaceous body that I am now blessed with (I know you're snickering... stop snickering). I will have gained weight that will be a pain to work off, and my chesticles will be sagging and my hips will span the entire state of Rhode Island. I am seventeen. I am at the blossoming zenith of womanhood. TIME TO SHOW IT OFF.      Stop swearing.  Actually this has nothing to do with being feminate, but I have to do this anyway. There's nothing more unattractive about a lady than having to add asterisks after the first letters of two particular four-lettered word if ever it's being transfering to paper. Granted I  do  know how to exhibit creative insults without profanity, but nevertheless I must harness the profanity when it tries to take hold of my tongue. It will be as hard as  shizzny winkettes , but I must try.     Enough of the subject. I will be the primary informant if my little experiment works.       Today was not too exciting. For one, I had to wake up. That always ruins my day. I don't remember much besides the searing 103 degree heat. My aunt, my four cousins, my mom and I went to William Land Park for the Annual City Employee Picnic. We got eight free tickets from Mr. Coons because he works for the City planning and creating traffic signs and such. We started off for the park about two, ate something, went around the park with our free bonus passes. We had free entry to the Sac Zoo and Fairy Tale Town. Again, still fuzzy on the details. I vaguely remember seeing oddities like the sun but otherwise I felt like I was walking around with a bag on my head.       Random thoughts: Send two letters by tomorrow.... Tomorrow is Friday, right? ... When does the bloody Olympics start? .... School registration is next Tuesday.... I'll bet no one will recognize me.... Mom needs help to get a digital video camera... Ecstatic... MUSE IS SO AWESOME...       Okay, I'm done.   = Cristie

       Last night evolved around drunkeness, Flamin' Hot Cheetos, a wheel-chair story and tears. After church, the Ways invited me to their place and we kicked it for a couple of hours. They're moving to San Diego without me and I'm extremely distraught. As a friend of mine wondered, Why does everyone live in San Diego? Because, dear friends, it is sooooo much better than this dry and hot dump we call "Sacramento." I digress. We talked until it was time to leave to go to Bob's apartment.       Sarah, Josh, Ashleigh, Paul, and Derek were already there. Obviously Bob as well. I tell ya, if there's one thing Bob has a lot of, it's booze. I was the only minor in the room so I wasn't allowed to drink anything. They were more than willing to fix me up a margarita or something, but my dad told me not to drink any alcohol. Because I'm a good girl, I didn't drink anything more than lemonade and root beer.       ...  or did I ??? Hmmm ...       A couple of people got wasted but overall it was a good night. No music at all, but it wasn't a party. I at some Flamin' Hot Cheetos when I wasn't supposed to and paid for it. Blluuurgghh. Almost felt like purging out my guts at one point. Josh and I were talking about suicide and the different ways to do it. He was talking about how stupid it was for some people to jump off the cliff to their deaths only to find out that going over the edge only means another level of cliff. So they end up mangled up at the end and surviving. I don't know what I found that hysterically funny, but I was cracking up so hard. I think the worse part about committing suicide is actually surviving. I think guys are the only people who would discuss this type of thing with me. Peh.       Anyhow, the Ways drove me back home and my sister was home from Chicago. I dragged her out and we said good-bye to them for the last time until we see them again in October. About one o'clock in the morning, I checked out all the cool stuff my aunts and grandmothers from Chicago got me. I got a super cool pink plaid watch from Guess (which is extremely swanky for me), a red sweatshirt that says "Columbia College of Chicago", and something else that I can't quite remember now.       I've been stuck in a conciousness of peach fuzz. Time is unlinear and my memory has gone down to the toilet. I think all that helium I've been sucking over the years has finally caught up with me. My brain cells are screaming as they die. I need to excercise the remaining cells with school this year.       My doctor says I need to have "fun" this year. "Fun". What is this "fun"? Such a foreign concept. Drawing constitutes as fun, right? If I draw enough pretty pictures, will that equal a sufficient amount of fun?       I'm going to continue drawing now. And screaming at the computer. Eventually I'll get tired and sleep.       = Cristie

       This summer's highlight (amongst other things) was going to San Franciso with the Way kids (yes, I'm calling you "kids" even though you all are older than me. Deal with my dorkness for now.) and taking pictures of the city. These are very, very, very random pictures and without context, it would be sort of hard to follow. ANYHOW! On ho!!! (No, I did not call you a "ho" ... I'm sorry you misunderstood.)      ^ Our first stop was the Coit Tower where it takes hours for a parking lot and only minutes to realize there really isn't much to see. The adventure we had involved the payable bathroom where you only have 3-12 minutes to do your "thing" before the portal-like door opens, leaving you exposed to the entire world. I had such a kick by watching a guy enter the bathroom, not knowing where to relieve himself. I was laughing so hard.       ^ This was the bustling part of Chinatown ... Not really. My sister had the audacity to grab hold of my arms and push me through the crowd, like I was her personal human shield. I nearly mowed down old people in the process.       ^ Also taken in Chinatown. We saw a guy playing the Chinese violin and I do believe he's giving me a dirty look. Can't you tell? Notice the interesting view of Yuri's back.       ^ I call this picture "Mr. Penguin Pants." While I was walking down the street a guy, wearing extremely low pants, walked right in front of me. And he walked very,  very  slowly. I believe he was genetically engineered to dress poorly thus causing him to walk like a penguin in his large pants. I couldn't resist taking a picture of his bum. I only wish I aimed the camera better.        ^ Our next stop was the Yerba-Beuna-Vista-Whatever-Building. I'm not sure what it's called, but it's a mall-like complex with five levels. It has restaurants, movie theaters, and many stores. They had a level where they had several arcade games. One of which was the DDR (Dance, Dance Revolution) Game Machine. A Japanese boy owned on it, getting about a 90 score. However, it probably proved he didn't have a girlfriend either.      ^ Walking back towards our Mode of Transportation, I saw this lady in the yellow dress who might've possibly been a hooker. I thought that was cool so I snapped a picture of her.       ^ We ate lunch about four o'clock and picked up some Japanese food. We headed over to the Golden Gate Park where the temperature turned frigid all of a sudden. We were freezing as we ate, but we glowed with warmth, laughter, and camraderie as we tortured the sea gulls. This was our fabulous view as we ate. I do not know the man in the picture.       ^ Last stop: The Golden Gate Bridge. I found this ... " Someday I'll be back here and I'll be in love ." Awwww.     Right now I'm focused on getting a digital camera so it'll be easier to post up pictures nobody really cares to see, preferably before I go to Lake Tahoe in October. I took all of these with very expensive cheapie disposable cameras and scanned them so ya'll can see my summer wasn't a complete bummer.   Okiepokie, phantom readers. I'm off to bed now.

       Dear You,       Hi, how are you? Right now I'm having those feelings like I want to erase all traces my existence. Have you ever had those? I just want to dissipate into the air like little vapours that float up from cups of Earl Gray tea. I think it would be marvelous to disappear or become someone else every time you get tired of yourself. A sort of ... Chronic Reinvention.       Right now my name is no longer Charlene Cristie Ann Ramirez Pirote. I am known simply as Ama. I have flaming white hair cut short close to my skull. I'm delicate and tall and I always wear platform shoes. I wear lots of mini-skirts made of leather and butterfly pins.       I work at a record store where they sell classic 45" record singles. Sometimes the shop gets slow because not a lot of youngsters know what 45" records are. It's a sad generation we live with. Some old timers come in my shop and donate some of their stuff. Mostly it's because they are moving to Senior Citizen centers and don't know where to place their memorabilia. None of their children want it, none of their grandchildren don't even know what they are. I accept them happily. I don't get a lot of money from this job, but I get by. I find having a small budget slims down my figure.       I live Mid-town where all the houses are old or falling apart. Mine just happens to be falling apart. I plant a lot of rambling rose bushes which have more natural beauty than the store-bought roses. I collect blue vases and line my six-foot wide, three foot high living room window. When the morning light comes in, it creates a euphoric mural of blue swivels, wisps, and tendrils on my wall. It makes a great contrast with my large and cushy red couch. On the weekends, I go to indie shows where the music is loud, the kids are high, and their hair is higher.       That's all for today. I think I'll be someone else tomorrow.

       Gonna cry gonna cry gonna cry gonna cry      I went to the doctor today. I bloody have acid reflux, thanks to not eating every day for four years. "Your body is starved," says my doctor. "You have to eat breakfast." But my doctor is cool. She's new and she's younger than the last one. She's actually pregnant and she treats me like a normal person, not a little kid who should be scolded for being sick.       No caffiene, no greasy foods, no spicy food either. Breakfast  everyday .       I am going to die.   Actually, no, I'm sleepy. I'm going to sleep my pain away.       = cristie

       I really can't remember what day it is sometimes. More often than not, I have to remind myself outloud. If a certain person is around me, they start to get offended because they don't understand I'm saying it outloud for my benefit, not to insult them.       I'm sleepy = I don't make any sense.       If today is Monday, then yesterday was Sunday. Yesterday was the farewell party to our beloved Way family. But the highlight was riding a horse. (w00t w00t)      My mom and I arrived an hour early to help with the preparation. This party was a barbeque at the Coons Ranch which is a nice little ranch situated at the heart of In-The-Middle-Of-Nowhere-But-With-Lots-Of-Cows. My mom bought balloons which took forever to purchase. My mother has bad bouts of indecisiveness. But yeah, anyhow, I played the piano and read "The Complete Works of Shakespeare" while the other guests arrived. Even when the other guest arrived, I was still reading "As You Like It" pretending I was a large, human-sized pillow on the couch. Alas, I was found and I actually went outside to "socialise" with the other people. It was .... okay. There were a lot of other people from church milling around, drinking beer and whatever whatnot. I don't know. I wanted to drink beer but it's not a good influence on two of the pastor's children. But I really wanted it. I really wanted to drink beer. :(       After a while, Christine Coons came over and told me to tell her if I was ready to ride her horse, Isabelle. I was all "NARF!" Last time I rode a horse, I had a hurtin' on my butt, but for some odd reason I wished to repeat the experience. (I'm weird, I'll admit that.) I wolfed down my desert as much as possible and helped Christine lug the saddle to the horse on the otherside of the ranch.       Her horse is a Philly, and I have no idea what that means but that's what it is. She has a long Spanish name but Christine just calls her Isabelle. It's a nice name for a horse. If it were up to me, I would've named it something obsure... like "She-nana" or whatever. We brushed her and put oil on her hair to make it all shiny. That took about two hours. We were taking her out and I was about to get on her (what do you call that anyways? boarding a horse? loading myself upon it? be-saddlement?) when Mr. Coons came along and told us to put her back because they were going to take a group photo. We did as told and went back to the group.       A speech was taken place, so were a lot of pictures, and I pretended I was the model for 7-Up in the picture. I sat next to Tressie, the pastor's four-year-old daughter, and held my can of 7-Up while holding a thumbs-up. And of course, my trademarked cheesy smile. I am Uberdork 9.0 Optimized to the Max.       Harold Junior Way accompanied Christine and me back to the horse. But before I went on, I just stared at Isabelle, completely unknowing of what to do.       "What do I do," I said to Christine.    "Well, you put your foot on the (whatever it's called) and you swing your foot over to the other side," she said.    "Are you sure," I said, more of an accusation than a question.    "I think you lack confidence," she said. I just stared at her. I mustered up the confidence within me, which might've been gas who knows, and stuck my foot on that accelerator peddle thingee and ---      WHOOSH! Isabelle started without me.   "HOLY SH**!!"" I screamed. Harold Jr. stopped Isabelle before she could pummel into the gate, me included. By the time she was calmed, one foot was on the foot thingee and the other one was hanging freely. I was hanging on to the horn for dear life and I had almost wet myself.       "I saved your life!" Junior said. I just started laughing hysterically. I righted myself enough to actually get on the stupid saddle and then I hunched over, trying to ignore the previous urge of wanting to wet my pants. I had cussed in a  church picnic . If I was Catholic, I was sure I was going to hell.       That incident was almost forgotten as I needlessly held on the reigns even when I had the inability to actually stir the horse. I started singing cowboy songs, but I didn't know a lot of cowboy songs so I just made up my own. I sang something about riding into the sunset or wanting to drink beer or something. I really can't remember. Oh! I forgot to say yee-haw.       My butt started to hurt a lot so I got off. More like fell off, but off. I went back to the house and got myself some soda. Neda and Yuri were petting the kitties which roam so freely on the ranch. I didn't quite  pet  as I did  antagnoize  but I scored some helium balloons and peer-pressed Neda and Yuri to suck some. YES I AM A BAD INFLUENCE. My good-bye gift to them was a long-lasting addiction to helium. It's priceless, I tell you.       We all sucked a balloon and Tembra Way came over to try. Bob Jones chagrined us for doing it, saying it will kill our braincells. I don't have much braincells to kill, what's a little bit more for the pot? We were like the "bad kids" in the corner, doing all the naughty stuff. It was funny. Sounding like a chipmunk is fun. Next time I suck helium, I'm singing "La Chucaracha." Weee, good times.       People started going home and I helped Christine put back the horse and feed it and other stuff. While we were doing that, we ranted how much guys are bad and icky. I also made the realization that the ranch life is not for me. I'm more into dressing up chihuahuas and hamsters for my own entertainment much to their nonverbal disgruntlement.     Then we went home and I took a shower, trading the stench of horse and kitties with a fresh ginger scent of an exfoliating gel.     I got to go to bed now. See how late this post has been time-stamped. I have to go to my stupid doctor who embarassed me in front my mother just so she can legally tell me I have acid reflux. I don't like her. I will fall asleep and wrap myself with the blanket of RESENTMENT.     = cristie    P.S. Letterman's audience are annoying. They clap too much.
