      I watched the clocks in a foreign room. There were two: one on the VCR and the other sitting on the dresser. In pitch black, I felt the numbers were taunting me. One was a minute off of the other. The other would turn and what seemed like hours later, the other caught up, only to turn again seconds later.  I waited for so long, for just one minute to pass.  It's incredibly odd that minutes can feel like hours. Certain moments in time, one wishes could last forever. Upon this realization, certain moments in time only still exist by being replayed within my mind. Why is it that time can also erase these moments? I don't have to forget, if I keep rewinding. But life forces us to fast forward.

      I had a wonderful day with Chris. We went to the park and sat out in the sun and we went to the mall. I didn't care where we went, I was just so happy to be spending time with him. He held me and looked at me with such love in his eyes. I can't replace that feeling with anything else.   I'm so happy he drove all that way for me. Even after being disappointed today, he still kept me happy.   I found out how many people are actually in Jewell Tones this year. It's going to be as bad as chorale. Anyone can get in. It's as if all my hard work was for nothing. I sang my heart and soul and I guess it was as good as people who don't even care. Hopefully, most of the stupid people won't show up and Mrs. Jewell will realize her mistake of letting these people in.   I'm so dedicated and determined this year to prove myself. I just wish it wasn't so tiring and I wish I wasn't let down again and again. I hope all my hard work will pay off again. Otherwise, minoring in music might be completely out of the question for college. I guess, it's silly to continue on with dreams of singing. I mean, I don't want to be famous. I don't care about that, I just want to perform on stage and sound wonderful. I want to be heard...   If Mrs. Jewell wanted more dedicated people in Jewell Tones and in chorale why did she let more people in? Doesn't she realize she's leading herself to a let down?   I'll never understand ignorance.   [edit 8:45 PM]   I'm going to district solo and ensemble this year. I'm going to do a solo. And guess what else?    I'm going to get a I rating.

       As of June 30, 2001 state and federal prisons and local jails held 1,931,859 men and women behind bars â€“ more than ever before. (U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics)   Many of the people behind bars have an ethical view that their actions are OK "as long as I can get away with it." Like a child, watching out for Mom, who pulls a chair up to the kitchen counter. Stands up on the chair and grabs a cookie out of the cookie jar. Puts the chair back and quickly leaves the house to eat their cookie. It's OK as long as "I don't get caught." ( urlLink http://home.flash.net/~bob001/teaching-ethics.htm )   Since when is society so easily brainwashed? It's as if human-beings are becoming even more fragile then they were 50 years ago. Would people have different views if they always were caught within their bad actions? Our society is going down-hill and no cares to do anything about it. What am I going to do? Sit and complain. As long as I don't get caught...   The futileness within disipline seems to suffice for too many human-beings. How hard is it to know right from wrong? Who decided what's right and what's wrong in the first place? I'm assuming many humans no longer have common-sense.

        urlLink      I feel it's necessary for me to post this a lot. I was having a conversation earlier, of how annoyed I am with people's presentation of the english language. Granted, I don't type perfectly, but I at least  attempt  to present myself decently.   I find myself so often, getting a headache trying to comprehend what the hell people are typing. I am done with that. Now I just ignore any stupidity that is blown my way.  I finished  The Five People You Meet in Heaven  earlier than I thought. I liked that book. It seems to me, I'm not too picky with books. Although, I still can't get myself to read  1984  and I still haven't finished  Ten Theories of Human Nature . Oh well.   I have nothing inspirational to speak of. Then again, is anything I ever say inspirational? I copied down a few quotes from things I have read recently, this has stuck out the most:   "Holding anger is a poison. It eats you from inside. We think that hating is a weapon that attacks the person who harmed us. But hatred is a curved blade. And the harm we do, we do to ourselves."   I find it so true. I think my peak times for thinking are around midnight. I'm going to miss this time for late night reflection. I'm silly to ramble on, especially when it's about nothing in particular. I just like the fact that I'm exercising words, but then I also hate when the words I utter are breathing, out there for everyone to view. I keep many entries private though, for my own viewing.   G'night world.

      ... and today is all you'll ever have.  I started reading, The Five People You Meet in Heaven today. I'm almost done.  I'm lonely during the day. Everyone in my house is gone and I keep singing to myself. The summer is going by faster and faster and in seconds, I know the peaceful stress free days will vanish. Soon I'll be sitting in school, wondering what the person sitting behind me is thinking about.  I should be more assertive. I should call people up and ask them if they want to hang out. Or even call, just to see if they're still breathing. Some people's numbers I don't have, or I've lost.  Who cares. I won't see them after senior year anyway.        And me, with no one to call...

      I took some sleeping pills, knowing I wouldn't be able to sleep tonight. I finished a book for my summer reading. I enjoyed it, and I found the book lovely.  My monitor is making my room glow. I tried sleeping with a fan facing me, blowing a cool air on my feet. It isn't humid tonight, as it's been all other nights. I hear a high pitched buzz, perhaps from my own ears. The buzz of the city.   I looked out my window and I see a pool of glowing light from the street lights.   I ran outside earlier, as my window let in a yellow light from the setting sun, letting the sky glow. I wanted to capture such a sky. I don't know why, but that sky calms me. And gives me relief knowing that such beauty can be held in the world; all I have to do is look up and take it in. It's still ingrained in my mind. It turned from blue, pink, yellow. I saw so many colors within small intervals.   I ran barefoot and the wet grass and puddles from rain didn't bother me. I had wet ankles and the grass was so green. I ran with my camera in my hands, holding it excitedly for the moments I'm about to capture. I felt like a little kid again.   Such simple moments create peace within me. One must make their own happiness.

      Is one naive if they admit to their ignorance?  Is one spoiled if they admit to being spoiled?   I have it easy. This has gone unrealized by me, for too many years. I can twist words to deceive other humans. Easily, my life might seem horrible. My existence could be merged without hardships and suppressed memories. Oh, how easily so much is assumed.   I need to mark my realizations. My recognitions of my own existence need to remain shining bright. I cannot become another complaining individual.   I remain dewey-eyed. Open. I will help however I can. I will try to keep my own emotions out of the way, while attempting to make the world right again.   As the world reconciles, I create my own disharmony for my soul to deal with. I assume I can bring my mind to ignore any emotions in which I do not desire to feel. I want to pretend it's easy to not feel, to not care. Yet, I remain inside wanting to burst. I can still say, any emotional downfall from me, is in my mind. It's just hard to ignore any feelings of hate, anger, jealousy, lust.   I remain discouraged. I have sudden longings for certain moments in time from the past. Just so I can relive that ignorant little happy feeling of mine. However, when I speak it becomes nothing more than words stringed together. No meaning, no figure, no future, no past. There's no where to go from here.   I can continue to try to find more pieces, make the string longer. Try to make forgotten links stick and hold on. Yet the string remains twisted and everyone is fooled by my counterfeit words.

      My dad is home. We won't know anything for sure for a week. He has cancer in his stomach now, I guess. And tumors on his liver.  I don't even know what's going on for sure, yet. He might have to go through chemotherapy. Hopefully, not.  I still don't know what to say, or feel.

      I spent the weekend with Chris. Sadly, he worked all weekend. I wish I wasn't so emotional the entire weekend, then maybe it would have been better.  I found out my dad has cancer in his liver. We don't know what stage it's at yet.  I don't know what to say, or to feel.

      I'm only writing about this for future referance.  My dad is at the hospital now. He's bleeding interally,  somewhere. My mom just called, they don't know anything yet. I can tell he was sick, because he wasn't talking.  I don't know how to react. I'm worried. I'm always worried when this occurs. It happens to be something that happens often. It's hard sometimes, living with a dying parent. I suppose, it's something everyone has to deal with sooner, or later. In my case, sooner. I don't want to worry too much, because then it would be just added stress I don't need.  My mom is having a horrible day. She might get fired. It would suck, if all we had to live on was my dad's social security.  I had a good swim practice. I'm tired and hungry, though. Today overall, though just wasn't a good day when I got home.   I wanna hold you high and steal your pain away.

      I made the swim team. I think this will be a great experience for me. I was very happy I was able to participate.  Yet, I can't help but feel guilty. I can't help but feel as if I want to quit right now. Maybe, I shouldn't have even considered.  Practices will be hard and long. Especially, when school starts. I know I can do it, though.  Maybe, I should just quit. I'm sorry, Chris.   current music:  oasis - stop crying your heart out   P.S.  Jewell Tones practice tomorrow. Then the next day, a performance. I have swim practice every morning, until Friday. Yay.

      I hate thinking up titles. They seem like a waste.  I didn't find solace tonight; I tried looking at the sky, nothing but clouds.  I'm bored.  I'm restless.  I keep thinking about school and life in general. I keep having these irrelevant thoughts, streaming through my mind one after the other. I should change my header, it really holds no significance. Tonight the internet connection is slow. I haven't looked downstairs at how my dad has the network setup. I think he just plugs my ethernet cable straight into the modem. I have no objections to that, though. I have a feeling, he found out I was right about the ethernet cards. He just didn't want to admit it. That's how he usually is, though.  Oh, it's almost three AM. Grand. I should have read during all this time. The Fixer pisses me off. I find myself yelling and talking to myself about how idiotic some of the characters are.  What angers me most is, that human beings in our society today, actually portray this ignorance. To lie, because at the time, your government (etc) doesn't like a race, ethnicity, religion, and so on. It still goes on today and it just makes me so angry, that ones intent for a human being can be so greatly full of hate; they don't care if they die. What the hell is wrong with people?  I've really enjoyed reading about Buddhism, because of their philosophies. Even if I'm not a Buddhist, their concepts are still worth reading and even practicing. I've also grown fond of meditation. Buddhists teach us that war, hate, greed are all created within your mind. One does not have to succumb to such "temptations" if the will is not there. Don't kill a living create and do not hate another.  I suppose, that's all. Water shouldn't keep one up. There's NOTHING IN IT!  "Everyone goes through this stage where they realize the stupidity of other humans. When in reality, it's the denial of their own ignorance. "- Weird late night thought.  [Edit 11:34 AM] Finally changed my header. Meh. I make no sense at night. [/edit]

      Chris is the only person keeping me going.  I don't care if I'm not heard anymore. I'll just sing the correct notes and be done with it. I should read, but I just want to sleep.  By some miracle, my computer is online. My dad hates me now though.  Big loss.

      I finished  The Famished Road , finally. I've had a migrane for almost two days now. Nothing I take weakens the pain. I'm so disoriented. I sat out in the sun and it made me weak and far too warm.  I splashed cold water on my face and it didn't suffice to the heat. I'm drinking cold water, but the coolness quickly fades.  The book opened me in ways I cannot explain. I'm going to quote a section, so I don't forget that it holds much significance:   "There are strange bombs in the world. Great powers in space are fighting to control our destiny. Machines and poisons and selfish dreams will eat us up. I entered a space ship and found myself on another planet. People who look like human beings are not human beings. Strange people are amongst us. We must be careful. Our lives are changing. Our gods are silent. Our ancestors are silent. A great something to come from the sky and change the face of the earth.       We must take interest in politics. We must become spies on behalf of justice. Human beings are dreaming of wiping out their fellow beings from this earth. Rats and frogs understand their destiny. Why not man, eh? My wife, my son, where are we going? There is no rest for the soul. God is hungry for us to grow. When you look around and you see empty spaces, beware. In those spaces are cities, invisible civilisations, future histories, everything is HERE. We must look at the world with new eyes. We must look at ourselves differently.       We are freer than we think. We haven't begun to live yet. The man whose light has come on in his head, in his dormant sun, can never be kept down or defeated. We can redream this world and make the dream real. Human beings are gods hidden from themselves. My son, our hunger can change the world, make it better, sweeter. People who use only their eyes do not SEE. People who use only their ears do not HEAR. It is more difficult to love than to die. It is not death that human beings are most afraid of, it is love. The heart is bigger than a mountain. One human life is deeper than the ocean. Strange fishes and sea-monsters and mighty plants live in the rock-bed of our spirits.       The whole human history is an undiscovered continent deep in our souls. There are dolphins, plants that dream, magic birds inside us. The sky is inside us. The earth is in us."   There's more, but that is the just of it. I found it so beautiful and eye-opening. It's amazing how if the right words are applied it can open one's mind further than expectations. I'm going to start  The Fixer  now, either that or lay down. My head is swimming with thoughts I can't let breathe. I will reflect on the writing once my mind clears.   current music:  The Living End - Who's going to save us?

According the history channel, that's what Magda Goebbels believed. So, she killed her children and herself. The link provided above, is more comical rather than factual.

      I'm just warming up. I want to say something explosive.  My mind is a blank. I'm tired. I don't want it to be August. That means, school and a loss of time. I hate how the days go by so quickly. It makes me feel like I can't control anything. Time will move forward no matter what I do.  Sometimes I feel as if I'm in a trance. I will continue to repeat the same actions and make the same mistakes. Any horrible actions I've done in the past continues to play in my mind in slow motion. I live out the days in monotony and expect the outcomes to be different. I leave myself on repeat and hope no one notices I've run out of words.  "Don't conform and don't try not to conform. Just live life as yourself. Don't worry about clothing, it's merely there to cover one up. Don't smile and laugh too much, people think happiness is ignorance. Don't let your mind take over and become that giggly little girl. Don't try to rebel if the feeling is there, just do what is right. Don't hang out with people, they're only there to break you. Listen to music if it sounds good and don't pay any attention to the radio or television. It's simply an annoyance and entertainment for the bored idiots. Read as much as you can, and try to expand your mind. Don't let your mind flow, it's a contradiction. Don't try to make decisions, or you'll indecisiveness will shine. Imagery only comes to the gifted. Don't listen to your parents, they'll make you worse.  Forget your dreams, they're only for the weak. You don't need dreams to keep your soul alive, it's simply for naive children. Don't speak your mind, everyone will see you're a coward. Keep to yourself, because life will only bring you down."  Such thoughts become a choir in my mind. Repeating their chorus. I wish I could breathe words out as easy as thoughts come to my mind. I feel like a worthless excuse for a human-being. What I hate even more is I'm regressing back into what I was. A complaining child.  I wish this chatter would stop. It's moronic.
