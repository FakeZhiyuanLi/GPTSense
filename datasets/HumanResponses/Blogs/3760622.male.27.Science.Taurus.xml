       Well this will be the last installment for my report to Honduras. I have also include a album, see the attach  urlLink link  at the bottom to see more of my pictures!    As I embarked on this mission, I really didn't know what to expect. Many times I have heard missionaries and their stories about how exciting the mission field is, or how God is doing great miracles in their ministries. However, to be honest as I look back, my ministry was basically providing dental care, as I would've here in the states. Granted that the villagers don't usually get this type of healthcare, but somehow I felt that I was not doing anything special, especially for God. In addition, the language barrier was a big factor, as I couldn't communicate or evagelize to them. Thus, in some ways I felt that my mission was a disappointment or at very least, limited. But as I really begin to reflect of the things we did there, I realize that its not about me or my feelings. Rather its about God, and I see that we did extend God's love to them, as many of them did the same for us. By seeing how they worship during the services and gratefully giving their hearts to Him, sometimes I felt like they were the ones ministering to me! They didn't have much, but they gave sacrifically. It was amazing to see how God's work has no boundaries or barriers, and that He is faithful, just, and gracious there as He is here. Furthermore, I learn that the mission work doesn't have to be some far off place to make a difference, but every Christian have their mission field, in their home, school, work, as well as family and friends. And one of the best way of witnessing is by living our lives as a shining example and reflection of Jesus Christ! If we put everything in perspective, we are so bless here in the states, and we are all call by Jesus in the Great Commission (Matthew 28:16-20)"to go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age." God is good and I pray that if you are ever considering any type of mission to just go for it, because He will provide and remember "God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them." (Hebrews 6:10) So as for me, I can't wait to go back and maybe some of you will join me next year! God bless.

       Last month I had the chance to join BMDMI (in my favorite link) down to Honduras, where we spend a week ministering to the people through medical, dental, VBS, and evangelizing ministries. Above is a picture of our clinic, and under my profile is me and one of the kids, they are all just so precious and sweet! Also, I have a video in which you can check out our mission  urlLink site . It was a great experience, and I really just wanted to share with you all some of the things I saw and learned. And hopefully through my testimonies, you may be encouraged and may even open to the idea of mission.  Honduras is a very beautiful country comprised of 2/3 mountain ranges, filled with green pines. Most of the people there are living under impovished conditions, but they were very kind and grateful. The predominant religion is Catholicism, so most have some idea of God and Christianity. Each week a new BMDMI mission team minister to a village to provide medical and dental care. This is because Honduras only has 2 main freeways, and the majority of the peopel have no way to reach a medical facility. In fact, most don't even see a doctor or dentist for years, because of the remote area they live from the city. So they are always thankful and happy to see teams come. Our village is called Atima, and it was a 6 hour drive from the mission home (mind you, most of the path is mountain roads). When we arrived we immediately setup shop. we had 38 people on the team, divide into medical, dental, pharamcy, ophthalmology, VBS, and  evangelizing ministries. Because I am a dentist, obviously my ministry was to provide dental care. Unfornuately our time was limited and because of the overwhelming number of people seeking treatment, the only service we can provide was extraction. The way we reach them was that they are require to attend services, which was provided throughout the whole day at the local church, and then they would receive a ticket to see us. Again, most of the villagers were so thankful and gracious, and the children were just so precious, that it made our jobs that much easier to accomplish. I never felt tired even though we work long hours, and we have to also thank God for His grace and strengh throughout the entire mission. There are just so many other stories and things that I can't describe to you all, unless you were there. But God was definitely there working, despite the fact we couldn't speak their language, we can see that God works the same way there, as He works the same way here. He is faithful and just, and His love is never ending. Even though most of the villagers didn't have much by our standards, it was easy to see that their hearts were filled with the joy and peace of our God! In my second part I will talk a little more about what I've learned.

       Hi! Everyone    Thank you for visiting my blog.  This is my first time posting my own blog and I'm very excited to share my life and my views with you all. Also, I would appreciated any comments and inputs.  A couple of things about me before we begin, I am a doctor as well as a Naval officer. But more importantly, I am a Christian. One of the main reason why I started this blog is to reach out for Christ, and have discussion of every sort about this faith.  My goal is not to convert everyone that comes to my blog, but to present the gospel in its purity and truth.  In addition, I will be deploying to Iraq this coming fall and I would like to keep everyone updated on my journey as much as I can.  With that say in mind, I pray that God will bless this site and everyone that visits. <>

       They finally confirm about the date of my deployment, only after a hundred different times. But I will be deploying around the begining of September. In which, I still have some time to pack and will be taking another trip back to Seattle to see my family and friends. So please disregard my last blog. Otherwise, I'm very thankful for all the support and understanding that LBC has shown to all of us military personnels. Its very encouraging to see God's love manifest in the hearts of people, especially fellow brothers and sisters in Christ! And I'm grateful for all the good food and friendships you guys' provide, I'm definitely gonna miss it very much while on deployment. I will continue to update as news come, again thank you for your love and support, it really does make a big difference!

       They finally comfirm my deployment date, which will be a month from today.&nbsp; Can't say that I'm surprised but I do have a lot of things I need to take care of before. I will continue to update and let you all know how things are going in the up coming days. However, I do have some things I want to express today. As you know I recently took a trip back in Seattle, it was a good trip getting to see family and friends again, but it was also bittersweet. For the last 5 years I have been living away from Seattle, but have always considered it my home. I am grateful for all the experiences that I had over on the east coast and now in California, but sometimes I miss the camaraderie I had in Seattle. And I think to myself what if I had stayed, granted I didn't leave Seattle on the best of terms, but I rather not getting into that right now.&nbsp; In any case, I feel like each time I visit, I am drawing further apart from my brothers, sisters and friends in Seattle. Now I know changes are inevitable and is a part of life, but its still&nbsp;sad, especially if&nbsp;you miss a good friend's&nbsp;"big moment" in their life (again congrats L&J).&nbsp;However, that's not the worst part, it is people that pretend to be your friends, or maybe once they were, but in reality they really could careles about you. Not to say that I never did it too, but it really shows me that most people&nbsp;are out only for&nbsp;themselves. Which is sad because many claims to be Christians, yet they don't&nbsp;demonstrate God's love. I for one, want to break this cycle of selfishness and&nbsp;show love&nbsp;not only to my brothers and sisters, but also to strangers and poor.&nbsp;Jesus stated in Mark 12:33 "To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices." I hope we will all be a little bit more compassionate next time, for Jesus shows so much grace and love to us, how can we not extend that to others! I know I got a little bit off the topic,&nbsp;but I think its an application we can all work on. God Bless. &nbsp;

       Like my last blog stated I was back in seattle for a week visiting family and friends. It was bitter sweet as I got to goto 1 wedding, but missing another because of my flight. But I wish Jeanette and Lawerence with the warmest regard and a happy marriage. May God bless you and your union be glorifying to Him. As with all my brothers and sisters back in SFCC and seattle, you know I'll miss you all until I return from deployment, it definitely brought back memories while I was there and I do wish I was home more often! Please keep me in your prayers as I will with you all. I will try to update as often as I can, so please check this site periodically. Love, Tim.

       I apologize for my laziness, but I'm in Seattle right now on my vacation visiting family and friends. I will put some more pictures up and blogs once I'm at home. Please be patient as this may be my last visit before my deployment, not to mention I have 4 days of training next week, where I'll be spending out in the field. But I do want to express my appreciation for all you guys' prayer, love and support. I will keep you updated soon enough! God bless!

       Over the weekend, one of my good dental friend living fairly close to me got married, and I was able to see all my school friends. In which, for most I haven't see over a year, it was just good to see and catch up on how everyone is. I will include some pictures on my photo album. Its always good to see how people have changed or remain the same over the years. In any case, I wish my good friends, Linh and Cheri my best and congrats again on your special day!!! God Bless.

       Alright most of my topic previous to this post is pretty much straightforward. But I have a lingering debate that I wanted to put out for the longest time. Its about the "seeker sensitive" church movement versus the traditional church. If you don't know what a seeker sensitive model, Pastor Dan of Grace Sovereign church gives a pretty good definition as follows:  "In order to attract our target audience (i.e. "the lost"), the church must change its approach to presenting the gospel to the world. We must take a more "needs-centered" approach to the lost. Since it is obvious that our society is overrun with problems in the family, marriages on the rocks, financial distress due to excessive credit and borrowing and spending, massive depression, stress, and other such ailments, the church must step forward and meet these needs as no doubt Jesus would do were He here today in the flesh. This can best be done by tailoring our message to the world in such a way that these "needy" unsaved."  To me, I feel that as long as you get the gospel of Jesus out to people whether is through some methodology or simply presenting the gospel, just get it out there. Since I believe we all have different season of our faith, I believe we all need to start somewhere, and instead of jumping right into apologetics or exposition, which turns a lot of people off. Everyone need to begin from the basics of the gospel. Now some may argue that the seeker sensitive churches offer very poor doctorine and teaching of the Word, which I'm sure some traditional churches does the same thing. I'm not saying to idly sit quiet if the gospel is being butchered, in fact, we are all called to defend the Word, but I guess my point is that the seeker sensitive churches have often got a bum wrap, because they use stragies or people driven, instead of God driven messages. However, even the apostle Paul stated in Philippians 1:15-18 "It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill. The latter do so in love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel. The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while I am in chains. But what does it matter? The important thing is that in every way, whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because of this I rejoice." I pray that Jesus Christ is preached and always the focus of every church (his bride), but rather than criticizing one another, I hope the American churches can come together in unity honoring our Lord and savior, Jesus Christ! For only through Jesus Christ and not men, one is saved.   Please give me some comments or inputs to your thoughts! Happy July 4th. God bless.

       As my deployment gets closer and closer, I been ask many questions regarding my feelings about deploying, and usually I don't have a real good answer. But I do know that I don't feel bad or sad about it, even though a lot of people consider it as an unpleasant circumstance. Despite the fact that war is a terrible thing and there are inherent risks associated with it, it is justified to perserve the sanctity and freedom of life from those who want to take it away. And I feel privileged to serve not only as an United State officer, but also as a Christian! I believe we often forget how blessed we are living here in the states, I had a chance to goto Honduras earlier this year and saw how the living condition there is just so poor, and there are many other countries that are worse off. I feel that many people living in the states have become too comfortable with their lives that they forget about the concerns of others, and especially as Christian we must not comform to the patterns of this world! Rather we need to continue to strive and press on towards the goal that God has for each one of us. I am still anxious because I don't know what to expect, but I know I can put my trust in God and have the joy and peace of knowing that He is with me! I hope this will be an encouragement to all of you, and that we will continue to keep one another in prayer. God Bless!!!

       Good morning! I feel refreshed after a 5 day weekend with special liberties and comp. days from work, now don't be a hater! I really can't complain too much, even though Iraq is just around the bend, I'm anxious to see what God will be doing in my life during this deployment.  In any case, today's passage that I want to share comes from 1 Cori. 9:27, here Paul is trying to appeal to the Corinthians to be discipline in their spiritual walk, "No, I beat my body and make it my slave so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified for the prize." I believe we often get discouraged because we don't see the struggles we face each day is really between the flesh and spirit. This is one principle we need to come in grips with, because even as Christians we are still living in the flesh, though we strive to live in Holiness. The flesh is very weak and limited, just think about our daily routine of eating, sleeping, drinking, sex, all these are limited because our flesh crave it, and ultimately it becomes sin for many. The apostle Paul understands this principle very well, thus, he talks about our daily discipline in the flesh. We need to prepare not just our spiritual side, but also our flesh when doing the work of God. So that when the times comes, just like a professional athlete who trains his/her bodies for that moment in time, we are also able to perform our duties as a Christian when the opportunities present itself. And please understand this, this is a challenge to all of us, because the flesh loves comfort and laziness, and discipline require preparation and training! Remember this, it is not a mere suggestion or formula to become a better Christian, but rather it is a COMMAND from God to discipline our flesh and spirit. I hope no one gets disqualified because of their idleness and ineptitude, especially not when it is life and death! Please any comment is appreciated!

       I just want to share with you all what I learned from church this past Sunday. Instead of reflecting and mediating on the messages, I think often times we goto church just for the sake of going because its the "Christian" thing to do. We forget that we are there to worship a living God and to learn and live out the Word! I hope Sundays just don't become another check off list we do in our daily lives, but rather we go because we love the One who loves us more than we can ever imagaine. I think this will also be good for me! I will simply categorize the epistles of apostle Paul, again I know many times I get lost reading the bible, and this is just a broader perspective on the letters of Paul.  I will give the letters in canonical order, theme and key verse.  Pauline Epistles - In Thematic Divisions A. Soteriology - Doctrine of Salvation          - Roman: Righteous of God, Rom 8:1          - 1 Corinthians: Correction of church, 1 Cor. 3          - 2 Corinthians: Defense of ministry, 2 Cor. 11          - Galatians: Legalism, Gal 2:20  B. Ecclesiology - Doctrine of Church          - Ephesians: Practice your position, Eph 2:8-9          - Philippians: Joy, Phil 2:5          - Colossians: All sufficient Christ, Col 1:15  C. Eschatology - Doctrine of End time          - 1 Thessalonians: Model Church, 1 The 4:13          - 2 Thessalonians: Comfort/correction, 2 The 1:4  D. Pastoral          - 1 Timothy: Leadership, 1 Tim 2          - 2 Timothy: Soldier's manual, 2 Tim 2:1          - Titus: Godiness, Tit 2:11  E. Personal         - Philemon: Bondage to brotherhood, Phil 3  Well hopefully I won't forget the letters of Paul from this point on. Have a great week!
