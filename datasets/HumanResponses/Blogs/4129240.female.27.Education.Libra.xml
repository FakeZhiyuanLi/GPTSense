      Nothing deep or meaningful from me today, as I only got about five hours of sleep. Guh...  Why does every woman in corporate America have to bring a sweater to work? Why are all places of business like meat lockers by mid-afternoon? Is there some sweaty, obese guy in the basement cranking up the  air conditioning  so the rest of us have to suffer? Although that blast of cold air does help wake one up when you stagger in hung over. Maybe the sweaty guy is just trying to help us alcoholics out.  On another, almost-completely unrelated note,  ponchos  in summer are wrong .  I understand that some of us want to hide our pudgiferousness in this body-revealing season, but the hippie overtone of the poncho does not play when underneath you're rocking Corporate Casual.  Ponchos also look incredibly stupid with shorts and most skirts. Save the ponchos for Fall, will you? They might look nice over jeans or a short skirt and boots. (I'm not promising anything, though.  Ponchos are fairly annoying as a fashion statement - or lack thereof.)  The upshot is, I know it's freezing in your office, but leave the Jessica Simpson look at home.

      I tried to stay away from politics today (see below). I really, really tried.  But then I read both these articles on the AP feed and just had to say something.  SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- A Nebraska man who once weighed more than half a ton has lost 321 pounds in a Sioux Falls hospital, with a goal of losing another 450 pounds. Patrick Deuel, 42, of Valentine, weighed 1,072 pounds when he was admitted to Avera McKennan Hospital eight weeks ago [...] "If we hadn't gotten him here, he'd be dead now," said Fred Harris, Deuel's lead doctor [...]A  group known as the League of Human Dignity helped arrange for Deuel to be driven to a local livestock scale, where he could be weighed.       How does human dignity involve being weighed on a livestock scale?  And what led this man to gain 1,000 pounds before deciding to lose weight? Where were his friends and family as this man slowly committed suicide by cheeseburger? It's not the overweight man who upsets me, it's his support system - or lack thereof. Shame on them.  It's enough to make you feel really sad for this lazy, overfed, understimulated country...until you read something like this:  PHOENIX -- Junk food is out and healthier meals are on the lunch menus at eight Arizona schools this year. Over the summer, the pilot schools stocked their snack bars and vending machines with healthier choices such as granola, sunflower seeds and bottled water. Cafeteria managers took out high-fat foods, and teachers developed nutrition lessons. Health Model is a semester-long pilot through the Arizona Department of Education. It's meant to provide students with healthier choices and allow the department to study the financial impact of removing junk food amid rising concerns over childhood obesity. If the pilot is a success, state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Horne hopes other schools will follow the pilot schools' lead. Pilot schools in the program are in Phoenix, Tucson, Yuma and rural areas of Arizona.  YAY!!!! See, people? Hope  is  on the way. Perhaps the children of Pheonix will never know the shame of being weighed on a scale intended for cows and pigs. Now, if we can just provide public schools everywhere with enough funding that they don't have to rely on fast-food advertisements and snack vending machines to generate the revenues they need - why, we might not have to pay for thousands of government-funded emergency stomach-staplings twenty years from now.

      So I went to my reunion and it was all the things that reunions are. There was heavy drinking, talk of marriage and babies, reminiscence of parties past. I spent the next day vomiting - feeling almost like I really was eighteen again.  To take a break from all the political ramblings of my previous posts, I would like to make a list of the things I did not do while in St Louis because I was too hung over:  1. I did not go to a "real" thrift store where prices are still under five bucks for almost everything (unlike the "vintage" stores here, where everything costs as much or more as that crap they sell at the Gap.) I did get some cheap crap at Target, though. More on that later.  2. I did not eat a greasy taco from Jack N' the Box. This truly makes me sad, as I do so love a good greasy taco. However, I did have the Chili Five-Way at Steak'nShake, which my boyfriend (a stranger to the ways of S'nS) prounounced "spaghetti and ketchup on a plate with chili on top." Philistine.  3. I did not take my boyfriend to see anything even slightly scenic, other than driving past the Cahokia Mounds on the way to a classic car showroom with my dad. The cultural commentary consisted of "Hey, Paulo, those hills are made of dead Native Americans." To which he replied, "Nuh-uh, really? Can you see any of the dead people?"  4. We went to Target (no small feat here in NYC, as they cater to those with cars and also kind of suck compared to the giant megastores back home), and I did not buy the giant econo-bottle of Dove shampoo for $5. That was a mistake. We did get a nice bathroom rug, however.  5. I did not watch "Grosse Point Blank" before we went. At the reunion, during which I sucked down about a pint of Johnnie Walker Black, Paulo made a reference to sniper rifles that would have been hysterical had I not I missed the point completely.  Eh. There's always the twenty-year. I'll probably still be broke, living in sin with my boyfriend in little box-apartment in NYC with twelve cats and nary a kid in sight...I'll be sure to remember to snag me a couple of Jack N' the Box tacos then, even if it's just to reassure myself I'm not a total failure.

      I admit that I might be a little over-excited about this corporatization of journalism thing. Whatevs. At least I'm excited about something, which is more than can be said for most of America.  ("Oooh, there's a new reality show on tonight called 'Growing Up Gotti'!" or "Can you believe there's another magazine coming out devoted entirely to my craven consumerism?" seems to be the epitome of conversation these days among my fellow transit-takers.)  But I digress. I found this in the Archives of the Binghamton Press and Sun Bulletin from July 31. The link follows below, but I have included the whole editorial here. Hope nobody gets too mad about legal nonsense such as publishing rights. Journalism is dead, remember?   Network television tunes out conventions   "During the 1968 Democratic National Convention, demonstrators chanted 'the whole world is watching.' It was a politically charged time when America was involved in a war that many questioned.  "Fast-forward to 2004's Democratic National Convention. America's again in a war. But this one is being fought on many fronts: Afghanistan, Iraq and wherever terrorists gather. The country is again polarized about our involvement. But is the 'whole world watching?'  "Apparently not. At a time when choices made by our government in response to the threat of terror or on many, critical domestic issues are being debated, prime time network TV tuned out much of the convention in favor of reality TV leftovers. Score: capitalism 1; democracy 0. The major networks seem to assume that most households have access to cable TV where they can watch all news networks or even better, C-SPAN's pundit-free, gavel-to-gavel coverage. That's not always the case, and their selective screening of the convention left out Tuesday's convention lineup. That choice shut off the voice of a promising political star, Illinois state Sen. Barack Obama -- who delivered a speech many considered on par with or better than former President Clinton's.  "This is a perfect example of how public television fills a necessary void in America's communications industry. Those without cable are usually able to access public television. PBS provided live prime-time coverage all week. Public broadcasting obviously likes to celebrate the fact we live in a democracy.  "Should TV only be about ratings (and income)? Apparently the major networks think so. The whole world is watching, though, and won't soon forget where their priorities lie."   urlLink http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=1043F1B0F2996A0C&p_docnum=1&amp;p_theme=gannett&s_site=pressconnects&amp;p_product=BPSB

      I promised you a diatribe about the state of journalism today, and here you have it. On the heels of "Outfoxed" finally gaining a US release (after the DVD became one of Amazon's top sellers, ha ha ha), I join forces with my man Ted Turner in a true "wild-eyed liberal," Jane Fonda moment...  Where are the trustbusters when you need them? Probably counting their stock options somewhere with "Fox News" blaring in the background. This article by Ted Turner ( urlLink http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2004/0407.turner.html ) details his struggle to hold on to Turner Broadcasting amid the FCC's increasing support of media consolidation.  Some compelling thoughts from Mr. Turner's article:  "Ninety percent of the top 50 cable TV stations are owned by the same parent companies that own the broadcast networks. Yes, Disney's ABC network has lost viewers to cable networks. But it's losing viewers to cable networks like Disney's ESPN, Disney's ESPN2, and Disney's Disney Channel. The media giants are getting a deal from Congress and the FCC because their broadcast networks are losing share to their own cable networks. It's a scam. "  "The top 20 Internet news sites are owned by the same media conglomerates that control the broadcast and cable networks. Sure, a hundred-person choir gives you a choice of voices, but they're all singing the same song."  "The FCC says that we have more media choices than ever before. But only a few corporations decide what we can choose [...] Different voices do not mean different viewpoints, and these huge corporations all have the same viewpoint--they want to shape government policy in a way that helps them maximize profits, drive out competition, and keep getting bigger."  "Consolidation has also meant a decline in the local focus of both news and programming. [...]In early 2002, when a freight train derailed near Minot, N.D., releasing a cloud of anhydrous ammonia over the town, police tried to call local radio stations, six of which are owned by radio mammoth Clear Channel Communications. [...] it took them over an hour to reach anyone [...] By the next day, 300 people had been hospitalized, many partially blinded by the ammonia. Pets and livestock died. And Clear Channel continued beaming its signal from headquarters in San Antonio, Texas--some 1,600 miles away."  "Consolidation has given big media companies new power over what is said not just on the air, but off it as well. Cumulus Media banned the Dixie Chicks on its 42 country music stations for 30 days after lead singer Natalie Maines criticized President Bush for the war in Iraq. [...] Disney recently provoked an uproar when it prevented its subsidiary Miramax from distributing Michael Moore's film Fahrenheit 9/11. As a senior Disney executive told The New York Times: "It's not in the interest of any major corporation to be dragged into a highly charged partisan political battle." Follow the logic, and you can see what lies ahead: If the only media companies are major corporations, controversial and dissenting views may not be aired at all. "  Why aren't people more angry about this? Is it because even the most informed, liberal people I know work for major corporations, some of them the very media conglomerates mentioned above? I've been there. It's hard to say, "I quit because I disagree with this company's politics" when that fat paycheck keeps rolling in - and does one person's dissatisfaction really start off a  Jerry Maguire  moment where other people are inspired to up and quit? Hells, no. Best to keep your mouth shut and hope the government eventually wises up - to hope that we will manage to elect a president who doesn't have corporations' best interests at heart.

      So my high school reunion is coming up - this weekend, in fact. I wasn't really planning on going, but since my parents have moved to FL I don't often have an excuse to see anyone from my hometown. In honor of the reunion, I decided to update my website.  The site was two years old, so my boyfriend and I re-did it, and that's when I decided to start a blog. I spend half my time on the Internet reading blogs, and they're just starting to treat bloggers like real journalists (more on the decline of American journalism to come), so why not?  Unfortunately this blog is just a test-run, so it's kind of boring. I promise to talk more about sex &amp; drugs in the future....
