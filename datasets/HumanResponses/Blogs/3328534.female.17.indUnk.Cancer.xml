      Hie peeps,  I'm rather new to this, read about it in the newspapers but only stumbling across one through my lovely older cousin's page. So hence, i 've decided to burn more or my precious time by setting up my very own blog page for you peeps to get to know what actually goes one in this weird little life of mine, my feelings ,thoughts,likes ,dislikes and whatever else that particularly concerns me. I don't know what,but just you wait and see......  Mayflower

      Went to watch Harry Potter with Shammy ,Yong Pei , Jo Q., sheep and Pui Ting yesterday. My verdict : I'm totally, entirely, undoubtly ,disgustingly dissappointed!!!Urrgghh, they made my favourite book out of the series into a total crap and cheesy movie , with a crap plot and crap characters. Gosh , when did Malfoy ever turned into such a sissified pest? The only thing i find worth watching is the fact that Daniel Radcliff turned out to be a total hunk! Other than that , my fav character Ron has been so down-played .And what's a harry potter movie without OLIVER WOOD!!!!!!???!! And it ended so abruptly , i was like WHAT? IT ENDED ? And Sirius is so totally not SIRIUS!!!! They should have gotten Johnny Depp instead! HAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIHH! I'm SO NOT watching another Harry Potter movie, or at least i think so...!

      Could you whisper in my ear The things you wanna feel I'll give you anything To feel it coming Do you wake up on your own And wonder where you are You live with all your faults   I wanna wake up where you are I won't say anything at all So why don't you slide  Yeah were gonna let it slide   Don't you love the life you killed The priest is on the phone Your father hit the wall Your ma disowned you  Don't supposed I'll ever know What it means to be a man Something I can't change I'll live around it   I wanna wake up where you are I won't say anything at all So why don't you slide  And I'll do anything you ever dreamed to be complete Little pieces of the nothing that fall Oh may Put your arms around me What you feel is what you are And what you are is beautiful Oh May Do you wanna get married or run away  And I'll do anything you ever dreamed to be complete Little pieces of the nothing that fall Oh may Put your arms around me What you feel is what you are And what you are is beautiful Oh may Do you wanna get married or run away  I wanna wake up where you are I won't say anything at all

      Today ain't good..have been checking out other people's blogsite  Stumbled upon a friend's who've just migrated to Australia. Read about some bad crap that fella wrote about my family when we visited them..gosh , it wasn't nice bcoz it wasn't true. It certainly ain't nice reading about ppl crapping about your parents behind your back. I feel like throwing up......
