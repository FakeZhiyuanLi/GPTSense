       Din't write for the last two days, so here's a combined post...  Wednesday (16th) was a holiday (Giru Arjan Dev B'day, i think), so woke up pretty late - 11.00 am. Of course i slept around 5 am, that's another thing. Hang on, you dont know about that, do you? I went to see the Germany vs. Holland Euro Cup 2004 league match with the trainees (with the land lady's son, in their house of course). They compare it with an India-Pakistan cricket match, a bit mildly though. Result: draw 1-1; the first goal by Germany was pretty funny; the second one i din't really see - sorta dozed off... :)   Anyways, so i woke up at 11 and was planning to leave before 2 so that i can go to the bank. But my bro needed some help with installing a game and finally when i got free, it was 10 minutes to two. So i waited till 3 pm and then went to the bank and got some money out. Then i went to the British Library, had to return a book and get a new one.  Leaving the library, i decided to go eat something, realising that it was almost 4 and i hadn't had any breakfast or lunch. Plus i felt a movie would be a good idea. The stupid Tele-booking of Fun Republic wasn't working and i was pretty sure i wouldn't be able to get a ticket, but i drove to FR nevertheless. Of course it was house full - movie being Harry Potter 3 and the day being a holiday. But i already knew that was gonna happen.  So i just went to McDonalds and had one Chicken Maharaja Mac with medium glass of Fanta. Having eaten that, i realised i was still hungry and had another Chicken McGrill. Was still a bit hungry, but decided not to eat any more over there since i'd already spent enuff for the day.  By this time, i was a bit tired also and was in my 'Comfort Mode' - drunk sorta high without drinking and with an almost full stomach. So, din't do much after that except going home. Dont really remember after that.   Yesterday was the standard-busy-day. Work - lots. Tired - quite a bit ... etc etc...  In the evening was thinking about you and wanted to go to the Cyber Cafe(CyC) to write somethin for you, but got stuck with some things. By the time i was about to leave, in fact i was at the door, you called. Loved to hear your voice. For a moment din't seem like you were so far away... Anyways, after your call i went out of my house and was about to leave on the bike when i realised that i already talked to you and the whole thing about missing you and writing to you was taken care of. So came back in, smiled at the look on my bro and my mom's face (oh, mom was after me to get my anti-rabies shot which was due for the day), got the shot and then played some games on the comp... Ohh ohh... also had two packs of Maggi (Tomato) - my style...(i've made a few additions to the procedure...;P )

       Well, yes, i went to the lake las' night.  The air was realy clear and as i was coming back from the trainee house, i could see the lights from Kasauli. That's when i decided to go to the lake to see it from there.  I passed the little roundie near your house. Had you been there, i might have stopped by to pick you up too...  Passing the Bougainvillea Garden on the way, i caught a glimpse of the lights again (the same when i was coming back too). I din't really stop for long at the lake and sort of did a driveby. The lights looked really pretty and even the ones at Mansa Devi and Saketri joined in.  I dint exactly do it on purpose, but it so happened that i arrived at the lake at exact midnight (give or take a few seconds)...

       Well, i guess i've wanted to say this to you for a really long time. At first, i dint know if i know you well enough to be able to say it. But recently i've realised that its time to say it before it gets too late. I guess i cannot be really certain as to your reaction but i cannot take it anymore. I've kept this inside me for soooo long that either i say it or i'll explode. So, here goes...  Its just that i wanted to ask that can you please...  USE PUNCTUATION .... SOMETIMES....!!...  Man, reading wat you write is well, a bit of an effort. Sometimes its quite clear(like this time), but at times it just gets plain irritating. Can you please sometimes act as if you're not writing an SMS in which you need to write a lot so you disregard all use of punctuation marks, capitalisation and even spaces between words !!... oh oh oh... sorry, there's one punctuation mark you use liberally - !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ;P  ... Thats it for the stupid-Kush-joke of the week...  But whoa, that WAS quite a sight - the one i told you about. I'm pretty certain the girl isn't from this part of the country, i.e. if she's from this country after all. That reminds me - i REALLY NEED to buy a camera... i miss all these great pictures every now and then...  And hey, you seen the "Kabhi Aar Kabhi Paar" remix video?? Extremely sltty (deliberate misspelling to avoid censure by a profanity check) females. However, in one part, the lead girl's wearing this white (dont start) kurti with embroidery. Pretty cute thing to wear, even if wasn't actually white !! (although the embroidery colour wont go that well then..:)   IMP I've given you admin access to the blog, so be careful with any menu items or sections you dont know about. mmmuuuuaaaahhh...
