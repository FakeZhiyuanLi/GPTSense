      I dream often and can usually remember my dreams.&nbsp; I've been&nbsp;thinking a lot about the meaning of my dreams lately.&nbsp; Here are a couple of my&nbsp;recurring dreams.&nbsp;&nbsp; Where's Freud when you need him? &nbsp;   Assailant Dream    assailant&nbsp;Dream&nbsp;Lately I've had the same dream over and over.&nbsp; No matter if it's a nap or at night, it is the same recurring theme.&nbsp; It is that there is an unknown assailant trying to get into where ever I am.&nbsp; Most of the time it is my parents' house, otherwise my apartment.&nbsp; Each time, I become aware of the assailant and try frantically to secure myself and my family inside.&nbsp; There is always something that hinders my attempts.&nbsp; It might be a garage door that refuses to close or a window latch that won't work properly.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I just woke up from a nap and another assailant dream.&nbsp; This time it was at my parents' house.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was sitting in the sun porch and saw what I thought were two falling stars.&nbsp; A friend of an ex-boyfriend was there and he said they were helicopters.&nbsp; We came to realize there was a massive search going on from the air for some sort of fugitive.&nbsp; I ran to the garage door to call my mom in from outside.&nbsp; She was on the phone with someone and wouldn't listen to me.&nbsp; I screamed at her frantically to get inside.&nbsp; When she finally did, I explained to her what was happening and shortly afterwards, I woke up.  &nbsp;  These dreams are driving me nuts.&nbsp; I don't usually have nightmares and when the occasional one comes along, I experience  urlLink lucid dreaming  ( which I love the idea of ) and am able to tell myself that I am dreaming and should wake up.&nbsp; However, each time I have had one of these dreams, I haven't been aware that I&nbsp;am dreaming until afterwards.&nbsp;  &nbsp;   Can't Walk Dream   &nbsp;  I often have a dream where my ability to walk is limited.&nbsp; I am usually in a crowded room&nbsp;and have to walk to the other side for various reasons.&nbsp; The thing that is always the same is that my legs don't want to move properly.&nbsp; It is as if they are stuck in hot tar and I have to sluggishly pull them along.&nbsp; I usually try to make my disability unnoticed.&nbsp; I act nonchalant about it.&nbsp; The feelings of frustration are very strong in this dream.&nbsp; Lots of times I wake up to legs that have fallen asleep. &nbsp;  Slow-mo Fighting Dream  &nbsp; I used to have this dream a lot but haven't had it in awhile now.&nbsp; In these dreams, I am fighting someone but my punches are always in slow-mo and when I strike the person, it doesn't make much of an impact.&nbsp; I am always confident of my ability to kick the other person's ass if only my blows don't gooooo sooooo sssssslowwwwwww.&nbsp; A lot of frustration accompanies these dreams as well. &nbsp;  Wet Dream  &nbsp; Yes, this is what it sounds like.&nbsp; I have within the last couple of years started having "wet dreams".&nbsp; I am able to actually have orgasms in my sleep without ever touching myself, induced solely by my dream.&nbsp; When I first started having these, I was not sure if I was just dreaming the orgasm or if I was actually experiencing one.&nbsp; Through lucid dreaming, I now usually make myself wake up immediately afterwards to determine whether it is real or imagined.&nbsp; I have found they are real!&nbsp; I can wake up while it's happening.&nbsp; Wow! &nbsp;  Flying Dream  &nbsp; I don't ever have flying dreams anymore but as a child I&nbsp;often had&nbsp;very vivid flying dreams.&nbsp; I remember fearless swooping.&nbsp; I wished with all my might that I could actually fly.&nbsp; Now it scares me.&nbsp; I am TOTALLY afraid of flying in airplanes as well.&nbsp; Weird.

      Kind of a weird topic for my first blog but I just wanted to jot some things down quick about my Xanax feelings.  What I mean is the feeling I get after I take my nightly Xanax.  I took 2 pills tonight instead of one so that I will hopefully sleep.  I feel floaty and light.  Tired and calm.  I quit drinking and replaced that with Xanax I guess.  I am good with it though, only take my daily allotted amount unless an emergency calls for more.  Rambling, rambling.  My typing is taking forever because I keep making typos.  Enough for now then I guess.  Tomorrow I get started on myself and my history.   Night for now...
