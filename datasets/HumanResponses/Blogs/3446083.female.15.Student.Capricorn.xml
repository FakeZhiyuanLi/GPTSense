       Well tonight has being so fucking shitty i can';t even say how bad i feel. i'm so dissappointed in myself i can't even explain it. i lost my moms debit card. that may not seems like something that big to you, but for me it's HUGE. my mom ACTULLY trusted me not to lose it AND I DID! i fuckign lost it. I fucked up once more. i am such a fuckup. i dont' care how other ppl see me, thats how i see myself. and stupid pointless fuckup. I hate how i'm so stupid sometimes, i hate how i drink, i hate how i tell ppl i love them when i don't, i hate how i'm so mean to ppl when i shouldn't be, I Hate Me. No, just sometimes. what i REALLY hate is when i get suicidl thoughts. I wish those would leave. i dont' think i would veen actulyl do it, but even the thought of it sounds REALLY good sometimes. i wanna do it. so bad.

       I Love You. does anyone REALLY know what those words mean? And when the actul right time to say them is? I've been goign out with Jamie for 10 days now. ANd i was with him last night he said those little words. like, actully whisperd them into my ear. Like, what the fuck am i s'pose to say to that?! i can't say it back, cuz i dunno if thats how i actully feel. I think people just throw the words 'i love you' around liek nothing. and i'm not saying I don't do i either. ANd i mean, how do i know Jamie isn't jsut syaing that to get in my pants? like, UGH! i wanna be single again! WEll no, i don't. just i love being single having the freedom of not having to worry about any of the shit liek this *this is off topic, but toothaches really suck, my tooth is freaking out in the back of my mouth* When Jamie said that to me i didn't know what to say back. I just asked him how he could love someone he's only known a little over 3 weeks. i can't remember what he said (and it's driving me crazee) but i never said it back, and i really dunno how he took it. And, i like him, alot. I just... don't think i'd be able to actully say the words out loud, if i was sure I loved him. Maybe if i wasn't so confused abotu the whole thing, and i knew for sure how i felt i could say them. but right now i couldn't. ugh this is confusing and stupid.

       OK I officially HATE making out with Braces. U can not makeout with them without some way or some how getting hurt. If they're not digging into your lip, your clashing teeth. when the fuck do i get these peice of shit things off!?!?  But like really, no one really needs to have there lip cut off from making out with braces, i swear i almost got my lip cut a billion times tonight! so i had to keep re-shifting to avoid losing my lip and all circulation through it. I wonder what it feels like for Jamie... like, do they hurt him too? Ugh these are the stupidest things ever.     And OMG, Curtis jsut asked Mom to marry him. Wow. This is weird. I thought 4 sure that they were gunna break up. and he was gunna move out and now their engaged! this is wacked. i'm not really sure what i want to think. should i be happy or not care or mad cuz he annoys the crap outta me?  Like, this is boggling my mind right now. I'm really happy for mom tho, i knwo a while ago she wanted this, i think it was one of the last things she was expecting. Wow. i wonder what mom is thinking right now. my mind is whirling. i think i shoudl go to sleep now.

        First Off: Drinking without Guys blows. Or maybe it's just the fact that i'm really horny when i'm drunk and this weekend me n brit drank without any guys around...? anyway it doesn't matter cuz i don't wanna do it again. The best part abotu getting drunk is makign out with guys :) it's even better when u get to do MORE than make out;) if your catching my drift. ahah see how my dirty mind works? thats all i ever think about. anyway. why do ppl get horny when they drink? i've never thought of that b4. But everyone does. unless maybe ur a hermit and well... that woudl suck to be a hermit.    Drinking is fun. i wish i always had some moeny or a drink around with me :P then i coudl be drunk 24/7 :D hell yes. wow, that woudl be awesome. Except 4 the HUGE hang over you woudl have after :p lol hangovers suck. i've only actulyl ahd one really bad one, i was almot pukign in the returant... then again the night b4 i was the most pissed i've ever been. yea, i never wanna get drunk like that again. Even tho i know at some point i will. i can't even drink vodka anymore. i had this little sip of some vodka and sour apple shit and it was jsut rank, then mom let me try her martini and it had vanilla vodka in it and it;s all i could taste outta the whole thing. ick.

      Cut.   Bloods dripping from my finger tips Oozing from my cut Self inflicted pain Not hurting anymore.   The razor blade is sharp Cutting in my wrist  The skin peels apart  Pink flesh is underneath  The cuts are getting deeper As the anger builds inside me Annoyance makes it worse Driving me to cut more  I don’t wanna deal with this anymore.  I wish it would all stop The pain is all that helps But I continue to  hurt inside  The urge is much to great I’ll fall back in  I want to feel that blade As it rides over my skin

       AS much as i thougth i would NEVER do it. I did. and now i'm not really sure i can stop. The cutting eases all my other pain. i feel liek i'm in control of all my emotional pain. Changing it into physical pain that i can control and i can stop when it become too much.    I'm going to draw a picture,  a picture with a twist,  I'll draw it with a razor blade,  and draw it on my wrist   Exactly how i'm feeling. the cutting doens't hurt. It's the pain i'm cousing everyone else by doing it that hurts. so you think i'd stop. u wouldn;'t think it but it's addictive. I get a high everytime i run the blade over my skin. i have a about 20 cuts now. The cutting keeps me from being suicidle. i hate thinking about dieing more than anything. sometimes it feels like the only way, but i hate it. more than ANYTHING. i hate being a teen and i hate thinking that there are other ppl out there that feel the same as me. i dont' want ppl to have to do this, i mean.. to some extent it makes me feel better but it also makes me feel worse. i dunno how that works. ugh i have so much bloddy homework. better go do that.
