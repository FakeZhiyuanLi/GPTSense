      Today, the second day of VirtCamp, has been a exhilarating, tiring, and fun day.&nbsp; I can not believe all we have accomplished in one day.&nbsp;We created a robotic lego machine to accomplish a task as a group, we learned how to start a webpage through dreamweaver, we learned how to video edit, we discussed how neard ropes relate to our cadre, and finally we learned how to blog.&nbsp; As we learned each new application, we realized that we all could contribute differently.&nbsp; We started to trust one another, allowing others to help us navigate through and lend their expertise for each particular task.&nbsp; I have had so much fun , especially creating my webpage.&nbsp; I can't wait to finish it!   Although I am having fun, I started to get homesick.&nbsp; I really miss my family.&nbsp; Right when I felt like I was going to loose it, we started to do the webpages, and chatting through AIM.&nbsp; It was fun to connect with my cadre mates.&nbsp; It took the edge off of my feelings of missing home.&nbsp; I am excited to see what new experiences we will learn, but even more so, to learn more about my cadre mates, what they are about and how we can work together.&nbsp; It is nice to have a community to belong to, eventhough it is outside&nbsp;anything I have experienced in the past.   I only wish I could get to know the other members as well as I am getting to know my video group.&nbsp;&nbsp;   I am tired, tapped out mentally, fried even, but I am excited to see where we go tomorrow!&nbsp;

      Well, I have been really thinking about my ARP. I, like Colleen, (as she stated in TI) have more than one passion, so how do I pick one. I decided that what is the topic that I know that will make the biggest impact long term? I think that is the key. It has to be something that I need to change, or I think I will explode! For me at this moment it is professional development, or even more teacher's education. It was from a post that Chris put in Blackboard. He was asking about professional development, and I needed to explain my point. I realized that what needs to be done, is new teachers need to be taught to look at education in a different way,. Right now, I cannot make that happen, however I can try to create a community of learners within my building. That is one step in the process, and maybe when I graduate, I will be able to affect more change in the teacher ed programs. I don't know how right now, but I really want to make it known that we need to look at education in a completely different light.

        As I read more and more about Action Research, I have a feeling we all do it on a small scale, with work, friends, homes, ect. As you try something, and it doesn't work, don't we all try to find out how to fix it? I do. I also keep trying until I get it right. This can be applied to all walks of life, not just the educational field.    I am slowly thinking of changing my action research project. I first thought about literacy, which I still may do, however I am also interested in professional development, maybe teaching teachers. I feel that this is what needs to be done to affect change. Maybe after this program, even going into a teacher education program, to really change the way teachers view education. We'll see.....

      Well, all the books are in, and I thought I felt overwhelmed before! The one good thing, is that all of the readings have been interesting so far, so I am sure the books will be the same. I am finding that I really like studying subjects I am interested in, maybe a correlation to the way we teach....I know it is simple, yet something we sometimes forget.  It is also crunch time for getting ready for school. I don't know where to start. That is really overwhelming. I am starting to teach next week and I haven't even started my classroom, let alone getting my computers ready to go.  Luckily I have a wonderfully supportive family. Johnny and the kids are so good. They actually leave me alone during class time, and understand why I have to read or research on the computer. I hope I made the right decision to start this at this time.  For now, I am taking a deep breath, writing my reports for my grant, deciding to take action in school, and researching, reading and posting for the class....

      Well, VirtCamp is over, and I am home. It is overwhelming, scary, yet exciting at the same time. I have realized that I need to be very disciplined with time management. This is going to be a crazy year.  Not only am I feeling overwhemled, I also feel sad that the incredible people I have met at VirtCamp are not close by. I hope that the members whom live close to one another can get together. It is an incredible opportunity. I am lucky to have Janet, I think we will work very well together.  I did enjoy our first class, it was exciting to talk to everyone again. I was nervously anticipating the class, however, my nerves were quickly calmed as I had the chance to discuss issues with my cadre mates and Paul.  We will see where this goes.....

       I just got finished with my first online class, and it was really very cool. I feel much better, however I feel very behind with the readings and posts. I need to become more aware of the goings on within the community. Because there are many different ways to get information from school, I really have to check them all out on a regular basis.      Paul was really great, he made us think about our action research project. I am really thinking about doing technology as it effects literacy. I am not sure though, there are so many problems, I cannot pinpoint what I need to address first, what is my passion, ect.      For now I will get back online, read the journals and figure out what comes next...Thank god we have a supportive cadre!
