      Sorry for lovin you the way that i do. Sorry for caring so much. Sorry for givin u my trust. Sorry for wantin u more then ever. Sorry for w anting to have you forever. Sorry for all i have done. And now i know that love isnt fun. You think u know how a person feels. Then you figure out your wrong. And it hurts a ton. Thats why i figuered out love isnt fun.

      I sit here in bed late at night with thoughts of you I wonder when I'll be able to look in your eyes To look deep inside you and see your soul The hours pass, then days and weeks go by Are your thoughts of me as fond as mine of you  I sit here in bed and smile with my thoughts of you Everyday my aspirations center on finding the one The beautiful love who brings out the best in me The girl who enlightens me with her existence I wonder if you might be the end to my search  I still sit here in bed late at night with thoughts of you Has fate brought us together or kept us apart Because I'm sitting here writing these words for you to read I'm taking a chance that I feel I must take For two people in love is a goal worthy of kings  Maybe I'll lay here, sleep, and dream thoughts of you  -troy this is for a special someone

      Suddenly you turn around and you're all alone No one's as close to you as they used to be You never thought it could happen to you Until you realized it already had You never thought that you'd lose all the people so dear to you You never thought they'd all is gone After everything that you'd done with them You thought that they didn't care Now that it's too late you realize they did You wish that you had been nicer Every day that you spent with them Now that theory not with you any more You wish you had done a lot of things differently

      I see you most different, than some people do.  I stare at the stars, then I look at you.  I see a twinkle, in you beautiful eyes. I sit there staring, I'm hypnotized.  I then start dreaming, of what could be.  I see true love, I see you and me.  Our love is strong, can't you see.  I was meant for you, you were meant for me.  -troy

      Today sucks..July 11th 2004 will always be the day that i remember i lost my first nephew..i was looking forward to see this lil guy grow up..wanted to be there for him like my daddy should of done. But i didnt even get a chance to hold him in my arms for now hes gone. Didnt even get to look at his delicate hands or his delicate toes. I was looking forward to being a big brother to this little lad. Things happen for a reason..or so i was once told by a wise woman. But this how could a live of a baby be ok to just suddenly go? I dont think its right..and i cant handle this anymore..I cant lose another.  I just want to curl up in my bed hide all day never show my face durring the day.. god you better be taking good care of.. Jack Daniel Anderson..my buddy..               -troy

      Remember me when I am gone away, Gone far away into the silent land; When you can no more hold me by the hand, Nor I have turn to go, yet turning to stay. Remember me when no day by day You tell me of our future that you planned: Only remember me; you understand It will be late to counsel then or pray. Yes, if you should forget me for a while And afterwards remember, do not grieves: For if the darkness and corruption leave A vestige of the thoughts that once I had, Better by far you should forget and smile Than that you should remember and be sad.   -troy

      I'm just an outsider looking in Seeing pass the obvious Knowing what could begin Seeking the love and closeness Looking for the right friend I'm just an outsider looking in Seeking safety and comfort With someone who won't pretend I'm just an outsider looking in Hoping for happiness With a long lasting friend Looking for a relationship Without any possible end Searching for my soul mate Who will protect from the hate I'm just an outsider looking in Seeing what the future holds With that long lasting friend. I'm just an outsider hoping to come in

      This pain is staying with me I can't get rid of it I can't get it to leave I can't put up with all of this All this pain is blinding me, i cannot see I've lost my way on the path of life I'm not sure if this is right I have to think about what you put me through I really want to spend time with you All these thoughts are making me lose sight On all the things we used to do We used to laugh and hang out all the time But you are no longer mine I want to tell you how I feel But i don't know how you would deal With all the things I'd be telling you But now we're here this is the end I'm so glad that we're still friends

      Cold I'M cold So very, very cold. Heart and soul frozen,  and afraid. What once was warm,  lie after lie has turned cold. What once was, was more than enough to thaw any man's heart. I await the sun. The warmth. The feeling still lives, in My heart and soul. I am afraid, I long for warmth, but  I am afraid if the chill comes again. I will not survive.

      To say you are all that counts in this world of all the towns, in such a city that is so pretty, would not be saying nearly enough. That which seems so far, yet you're so near, to lose this love I have no fear. There is nowhere, not near or far,  that can make a brighter star,  You shine above all others, that sets you apart. I look in your eyes and they melt my heart. There is no light that shines stronger,  with all that can last longer with all the need, want, and hunger that your beautiful love brings. Star bright your eyes with magic they shine, with in-depth love I want for mine, deep, so deep, hidden from day,  yet the love you've shone me so divine. Beautiful you are inside and out,  your love is all I need; of that there is no doubt.   -troy

      Can I Borrow Some Hope I 'm having trouble looking ahead because I can't stop seeing the past It's hard to not fall hanging by a thread How am I supposed to stand fast  Can I borrow some of your hope I've seemed to lost all of mine Can I have some of your trust  Offer me Your presence, your heart and your love they shine  Recovery seems so far off in the distance The road of healing is a long and lonely one Through the hard times I feel Your existence  And the promises you made shines like a midnight sun  Can I borrow some of your hope I've seemed to lost all of mine Can I have some of your trust  Offer me Your presence, your heart and your love they shine  Pain and hurt are no longer my only friends You lent me your hope and I felt healing and freedom And now through me the victory extends  Your always there strong for me whatever may come

      I'm glad that we were once togethor. I honestly i thought you were gunna be mine forever. But i was  mistaken for what i said was wrong. Every time i try to figure out what happend to our love and how it ended so suddenly. And all i have come up with is the one to blame is me. I'll move on sometime not real quick but slowly keeping every little memory in my head till the when i wake till the time i go to bed. Help me forgive my self for the mess i put us in. Cause hurting you is a real big sin.  NOT FINISHED YET

      When I met you I was Hypnotized because I saw the beauty inside  I didn't know what to do I just knew I had to be with you  so I wrote you a letter asking if we could ever be together  you said ok I'll give it a try and I said I'll be there to dry your eyes  and all these years you are still in my heart it would just tear me up if we were apart  so let it always be me and you I promise I'll always stay true  by troy

I just was so attached i couldnt think about my life without you having my back. But things are different now i finally figured out was missing in my life and thats just no pain no agony. WE sure have been through a lot over these couple of months. I apoligize for the way im doing this and they this is going down. You dont deserve this u need a betta man around. Sorry bout all of this hope you can forgive me adn we can go bak to just bein friends..                  sorry                      troy

      You are the nicest caring person i have ever met not to mention the FUNNIEST! I have known you for the past 5 years of my life. You have never left my side. When i was sad you somehow made me laugh. When i felt like nobody in the world cared you always showld me you cared. When i lost people with whom i loved you out of all the people who i knew always came and never left my side if it was in the early morning again right there anytime i needed you you always were right by my side. I love you more than any other person and i value our friendship more than anything in the world. WHen ever you need me call me at any time and i will be there adn i will visit you at any given moment and go to COLOMBIA and learn how to do the salsa dance thing and speak spanish!!! TE AMO MUCHO DIANA!! yes im learning! love you and forever your friend                          troy

      WEll this is how my day went so far i woke up took a shower got dressed when to see how everything was was it still the same or did it all change. My thoughts were correct when all this mess was scatterd here and there. No longer was this room mine. I cant seem to figure out waht to do with my life but to sit and wait till this pain someday ends. I am the person who tries to be nice to evveryone polite and kind and helpful and over all i want to be a nice guy to everyone but for some reason pay back for being so nice is me getting hurt. I lose my mom how hard is that SUPER hard im still not fully over the fact that shes gone and never will be. I lose my family im alone im forced to lose the gurl that i like. Forced to say goodbye and hope that shes gunna be allright. life so complicated the hardships just keep comming faster then ever i sure hope this will someday end and i will be happy once again.

      I see a reflection in the clear Of a soul that matches the one of myself But has trouble expressing the minds' near And keeps thoughts deep in stealth Of how she feels that words can't explain Which makes my mind wander and often complain I care so much and I just want to help But the only way I can is to let her help herself

      The Best Grandfather There was a man I use to know From my younger days. He loved to laugh, joke and tease  In his special ways. Although he's gone I'll not forget The man he use to be  Because he was the best grandfather  That there could ever be.   I miss you love you and will never forget you. You helped me be the man i am today and for that i thank you and will remember you for ever..

      Leaves and Lives A lonely leaf makes its way across the concrete driveway. Leftover from fall, it was not carried by the winter winds. Now it makes a journey with the fresh, new spring. Who knows where it will be led to with these winds: If it will be dumped somewhere to disintegrate, or If it will continue to be blown until The Day.  We are each a leaf during our life. We bud out, and eventually break away from the foundation Which formed us. From that point on, we are our own. We can fall to the ground and decay, or We can go with the wind and never stop.

      Infatable Truth Searing black flames licking at the toes of my past. Suckling tasting teasing, it infects my most intimate thoughts. My eyes fill with dry painful tears for the lost unfortunate believers. Memories gently beat me into submission as I curse reality. I deny the facts and preach the only significant truth. But does it fall on deaf uncaring ears? Take off your mask. Let me see your naked inner child. Could you survive without your lies? Twist and contort the pain into a comfortable sedated numb with the doctors love. We must all realize and endure the rancid stench of mortal truths. As my pen confides in the paper I still refuse the terms of reality. Revealing my raw emotions and weaknesses to myself the mirror becomes a window of turbulent embrace. Can the injustices be exposed in time or are we destined to live in societies forgotten cage. Rotting in our own innocence. A killer walks among us while you cheer the victory of the mislead masses.  Where do you fit in?

      NIGHT AND DAY I was a lost soul Who found you in love, Not by chance we met But by he that's up above. I had asked him for guidence And he led you straight to me, He said, "my lonely child I have brought unto you thee. Take and love her Cherish her in every way, For she shall be your night And you shall be her day. Be in love forever And be of one heart, And what god has joined together Let no one take apart..."

      This is about missing sombody.. I miss you already. The flame which burnt for us has about come  to it's end,you can't even be a friend. Where did everything go wrong? Hours spent together,are now only minutes. Soon,will be only seconds. Time has drifted,with it, so have we.  The pain of separation to be. What's going to hurt the most,  the thought of you in someone elses arms. The intimacy that was once ours, now belongs to another. I never gave you the things that you wanted or needed. I dragged you through a fantasy dream,only to fail in that too.  Things won't be the same, but I hope our paths cross again, I do.  Maybe our friendship will last longer, because, I miss you already.

      Candle Light The illumination of life that dwells within. Slowly dims. The shell of protection withers. Outer beauty that once attracted. Now repels. The gifts of past memories, slowly dulls. A creative imagination that once came with grace, becomes exert. The inure signs of ripeness, pries it self into existence. The will to live slowly subsides, until the light that once shined so bright, finally flickers out.  This was my first thing ive ever written yes indeed lata

      Thoughtless nights tears I shed Concentration of deep thoughts While a blanket covers my head Countless questions are calling But no answers to grab To stop me from falling I think back to a day not long ago A star had fallen in my hand And there was no letting go She was more beautiful than the universe  The power of affection trailed with a curse So many times I think back If I could have changed a minute in time Or switched from this to that But as everyone must find out Love is but a word  That must have feeling behind each mouth I tell this out of courtesy just because For everyone will go through this For this is My First Love  This is a poem of wut i thought bout my first love ya fun huh sweet lata
