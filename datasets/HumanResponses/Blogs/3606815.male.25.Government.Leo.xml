       This is just a note to let you all the Blog has been having problems. The last few days of postings are not showing up. For some reason the pictures sent from the phone are bouncing back saying undeliverable. I believe this is a problem with Blogger, the service that runs this blog, and not my phone. I'm looking into it.

         Here's a rather bad picture of the sunset Sunday night as seen from the drivers side window as I drove home from Sunday evening meeting. This was actually taken from the bridge over the Arkansas river looking back on down town Little Rock.

         Here's what we had for dinner. Chicken and shrimp chimichangas with a tasty basil white cheese sauce pored on top. Michelle did the chimichangas and I did the sauce. It was yummy.

         We redid the front flower bed around the mail box on Saturday. This picture really doesn't do it justice. It's actually very cute.

         Here's Noah in the new Honda Odyssey Mini-Van. It's so much easier to get him in and out of the car now. A Mini-Van is the only way to go with children.

         This is my friend Jason. We were standing outside the movie theatre waiting to buy tickets. We ended up seeing The Day After Tomorrow. It had an interesting idea for a plot, but over all the movie wasn't very good.
