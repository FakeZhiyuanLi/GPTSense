       nirvana: (nîr-vä'n-na) (noun)     An ideal condition of rest, harmony, stability, or joy. The ineffable ultimate in which one has attained disinterested wisdom and compassion.     I wish achieving nirvana was so simple. Life would be so easy to those tired of worldly pleasures and requirements. A pill perhaps that would cure forever. No addictions. No hangovers. I'm tired. I'm exhausted. Clocks tick. Sleep deprivation. The idiot box menacingly grips my head. I'm numb, wide-eyed, trying to inhale the moisture from the air around me. A tear drop evaporates. It is a half-life, a soul existence I crave.    But that was yesterday.   Today is different. Today, I'm Neil, techno, clueless geek and a hopeless romantic. I love all things about life - the good, the bad. Nirvana would be good... but not a requisite. Kurt Kobain would be pleased. I opted for 'Smells like teen spirit' instead...

      Was in Dubai this weekend along with some friends. Just chilling and some shopping were the order of the trip. Although the trip was shabbily planned we made the best of it.  Anything interesting?   Well  yeah. I tried by first bluejacking on someone at the mall. It was fun to see their reaction. In case you're wondering what bluejacking is try looking up this site  urlLink BlueJackQ.com  for what this nifty art is.  I also had the time of my life cheering for the Portugal team (supported along with the cute looking bar tendress!) while watching the Euro 2004 Football Cup at an English pub. I swear I would have been gobbled up by the English if by chance Portugal had lost the quarterfinal game, but fortunately for me Portugal defeated the English at the penalty shoot outs.   I also predicted Beckham not scoring the penalty and the lovely blonde English fan was not amused at my opinion.  Well, hey. Beckham blamed the football pitch!   For some, life is tough, isn't it?

      My personal favourite artist has been Picasso for a long time now. I'm not much of an art afficianado but somehow a single look at Picasso's work takes me beyond the canvas and into the frame-of-mind of this great artist.  I remember seeing his works first, in print form within the pages of the World Book encyclopedia. He was called upon to depict the brutality of fascist aggression in the Spanish Civil War with his monumental "Guernica". The image clearly was a distorted form of life but it spelt hatred, anger and unnecessary violence. Despite this, there was something about it that drew my attention towards the piece of work.  Over the years I have read much about his personality. What is covered in art books and alike brings out his character - true - but sadly that is  all that it does. He was known as a rebel from the start and, as a teenager, began to frequent the Barcelona cafes where intellectuals gathered. He soon went to Paris, the capital of art, and soaked up the works of Manet, Gustave Courbet, and Toulouse-Lautrec, whose sketchy style impressed him greatly. Then it was back to Spain, a return to France, and again back to Spain - all in the years 1899 to 1904.   And this was before he even struck upon Cubism...  There is a lot to read about Picasso on the web. A simple search at  urlLink Google  will reveal tons of repetitive entries to browse through. Some have focussed on parts of his life. Others, his entire living years like  urlLink this one .  Picasso was quite an individual it seems and his life is what is left behind through the form of a painted canvas.

      That's Feng Shui (pronounced Fung Shway) for those who are wondering. It's all about 3-legged toads and mystical stuff like that.   Anyway, I've been doing up some reading on Feng Shui and Chinese Astrology in general. I find it very engrossing not to mention interesting enough to stick me up for 3 straight days. I'm a distracted fellow and 3 days is quite good for taking up a fancy to Feng Shui.  Yesterday I walked into a Chinese Furniture Shop around the corner to my place and bought myself some Chinese Coins and a Dragon table piece. The coins are extremely intricate in design and they too have dragons on them. I'm on the look out for the Phoenix symbols. Soon...   Not decided where to use them but I'm sure I'll get around it by the week end. What is interesting that each of these symbols has a history behind them, which sadly not many people have bothered to read up on. Most of us find our Kua directions, arrange our furniture and maybe hang a few wind chimes around the place.  Sorry, it doesn't work that way. That's why the study of Feng Shui is an education by itself. By the way, if you have a wind chime and if you haven't placed it properly you could be in for some bad chi. Look up at Google.com and do some research on this. Better still buy a beginners book by Lillian Too.  BTW, the 3-legged toad has a coin in his mouth. When placed inconspicuously near your front door, facing inside, is believed to bring in fortune  Luck, Wealth, Health could be yours using Feng Shui. It's the supernatural forces, thats all.   The truth is out there.  Now listening...  Norah Jones - Sunrise

      Everyone has a story to tell. It may be about his/her life or the influence of someone on them, or simply about their apologetic past.  Can you tell me the story of your *future*? As easy it may seem, I seriously doubt it. And as soon as you make a statement, you'll doubt its authenticity. You'll doubt your present status, your family. The reason for life will be shaky just like the house built on sand (Matthew 7:21-28).  Not all of us can be like Jim Carrey and write a self-payable cheque for $10 million post-dated after 10 years (yes, it did not bounce), but if we try to undertand the logic behind this, we'll probably put all of it behind us. The logic though is the toughest! Trust me, chess is easier!  The easiest step is the very next one. Just remember that!  Now listening: Marc Cohn - Walking in Memphis

      I came across an article on the CNN.com website today. It was old but got me thinking. Some of us have been in touch with the Kobe Bryant case in the news.   What I read was that after the alleged incident between Kobe and the woman, there was an SMS sent from the phone of the woman. The authorities were out to try and find out what the message was since it would be stored on the server of the mobile service provider (yes they apparently save SMS messages also) so that certain details in that SMS message could point the investigation in another direction.  All in all fine. Till it got me thinking to what our private lives have been reduced to. Our lives are governed by the services of so many individuals, companies, organisations. The public works dept, the library, the hotels, the mobile service provider, the internet service provider, the newspaper guys, etc etc.   If every such service starts saving messages, emails and god knows what else into some sort of database, we all probably will have encyclopedia sized catalogs on our life open to the eyes of a few who can and will at any time use it against us.   Just imagine the possiblilites of blackmail, extortion and even plain vanilla pressure tactics  to get what they want.  There is no way we can even back out of this. We cant do without the service, we cant be technologically astray. So all we can do is sacrifice our born right to privacy. Not something I like!  I'm one big fan of conspiracies and I smell one here. This one is going to be pretty dirty if it ever leaks out that 'information harvesting' is taking place at this very moment. I'm sure it's good movie material too and will be pleasanly suprised if someone uses it sometime soon. Saying that maybe I should send Spielberg an outline of this idea!!

      I have been pondering about this ever since I finished  urlLink   Dan Brown's  The Da Vinci Code  . A fantastic novel and a must read for all conspiracy lovers.   FAITH is a very important part of our lives. Entire religions have been sculpted by the faithful. Millions of people now follow these religions. How is it that such stories of the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve, Moses actually travelled so far without it being written? Till someone would put it down on paper for the future generations. Surely it was through the word, through stories and through parables.   But the question I am posing and something that has been 'posed' for a long long time. What makes us believe all of what we have known, as true?   Gossip can travel far and fast. Is this gossip?   Or are we just trying not to get ourselves into an awkward situation with the religious?   Or, do our minds go blank while accepting certain facts?  I think it is related to the mind more than anything else. Our 'blind' reception must become active when certain facts close to our beliefs come into the picture. We absorb whatever has been told to us regardless of whether it is true or false. Like if a lie was told by a holy person, I would surely believe him. Why? Because of my *FAITH*.   So believe it or not, it is actually *HOPE* that has been created by us to counter the cruelty of life. And the FAITH in objects and people that surround us so that we are not alone. Shed this requirement for HOPE and you will truly be amazed at the possiblilities. But then life will be dull and a chore, wouldn't it? No direction no purpose?  Is it so possible that everything that we know exits, is a fabrication by some upper echelon? Your immediate reaction should be 'No'. But think about it, leaving behind your HOPE and FAITH.  Scary?
