      Eduardo Calasanz was a student at the Ateneo Manila University,  Philippines, where he had Father Ferriols as professor. Father Ferriols, at that time, was the Philosophy department head. Currently he still  teaches Philosophy for graduating college students in Ateneo. Father Ferriols has been very popular for his mind opening and enriching  classes but was also notorious for the grades he gives. Still people took  his classes for the learning and deep insight they take home with them  every day (if only they could do something about the grades...) Anyway, come grade giving time, (Ateneo has letter grading systems, the  highest being an A, lowest at D, with F for flunk), Fr Ferriols had this  long discussion with the registrar people because he wanted to give  Calasanz an A+. Either that or he doesn't teach at all...Calasanz got his  A+.Read the paper below to find out why.  PARTNERS AND MARRIAGE By Eduardo Jose E. Calasanz  I have never met a man who didn't want to be loved. But I have seldom met  a man who didn't fear marriage. Something about the closure seems  constricting, not enabling. Marriage seems easier to understand for what  it cuts out of our lives than for what it makes possible within our lives.  When I was younger this fear immobilized me. I did not want to make a  mistake.I saw my friends get married for reasons of social acceptability,  or sexual fever, or just because they thought it was the logical thing to  do. Then I watched, as they and their partners became embittered and petty  in their dealings with each other. I looked at older couples and saw, at  best, mutual toleration of each other. I imagined a lifetime of loveless  nights and bickering and could not imagine subjecting myself or someone  else to such a fate.  And yet, on rare occasions, I would see old couples who somehow seemed to  glow in each other's presence. They seemed really in love, not just  dependent upon each other and tolerant of each other's foibles. It was an  astounding sight, and it seemed impossible. How, I asked myself, can they  have survived so many years of sameness, so much irritation at the others  habits? What keeps love alive in them, when most of us seem unable to even  stay together, much less love each other?  The central secret seems to be in choosing well. There is something to the  claim of fundamental compatibility. Good people can create a bad  relationship, even though they both dearly want the relationship to  succeed. It is important to find someone with whom you can create a good  relationship from the outset. Unfortunately, it is hard to see clearly in  the early stages. Sexual hunger draws you to each other and colors the way  you see yourselves together. It blinds you to the thousands of little  things by which relationships eventually survive or fail. You need to find  a way to see beyond this initial overwhelming sexual fascination. Some  people choose to involve themselves sexually and ride out the most heated  period of sexual attraction in order to see what is on the other side.  This can work, but it can also leave a trail of wounded hearts.Others deny  the sexual side altogether in an attempt to get to know each other apart  from their sexuality. But they cannot see clearly, because the presence of  unfulfilled sexual desire looms so large that it keeps them from having  any normal perception of what life would be like together.  The truly lucky people are the ones who manage to become long-time friends  before they realize they are attracted to each other. They get to know  each other's laughs, passions, sadness, and fears. They see each other at  their worst and at their best. They share time together before they get  swept up into the entangling intimacy of their sexuality.  This is the ideal, but not often possible. If you fall under the spell of  your sexual attraction immediately, you need to look beyond it for other  keys to compatibility. One of these is laughter. Laughter tells you how  much you will enjoy each others company over the long term.  If your laughter together is good and healthy, and not at the expense of  others, then you have a healthy relationship to the world. Laughter is the  child of surprise. If you can make each other laugh, you can always  surprise each other. And if you can always surprise each other, you can  always keep the world around you new.  Beware of a relationship in which there is no laughter. Even the most  intimate relationships based only on seriousness have a tendency to turn  sour. Over time, sharing a common serious viewpoint on the world tends to  turn you against those who do not share the same viewpoint, and your  relationship can become based on being critical together.  After laughter, look for a partner who deals with the world in a way you  respect. When two people first get together, they tend to see their  relationship as existing only in the space between the two of them. They  find each other endlessly fascinating, and the overwhelming power of the  emotions they are sharing obscures the outside world. As the relationship  ages and grows, the outside world becomes important again. If your partner  treats people or circumstances in a way you can't accept, you will  inevitably come to grief.Look at the way she cares for others and deals  with the daily affairs of life. If that makes you love her more, your love  will grow. If it does not, be careful. If you do not respect the way you  each deal with the world around you, eventually the two of you will not  respect each other.  Look also at how your partner confronts the mysteries of life. We live on  the cusp of poetry and practicality, and the real life of the heart  resides in the poetic. If one of you is deeply affected by the mystery of  the unseen in life and relationships, while the other is drawn only to the  literal and the practical, you must take care that the distance does not  become an unbridgeable gap that leaves you each feeling isolated and misunderstood.  There are many other keys, but you must find them by yourself. We all have  unchangeable parts of our hearts that we will not betray and private  commitments to a vision of life that we will not deny.  If you fall in love with someone who cannot nourish those inviolable parts  of you, or if you cannot nourish them in her, you will find yourselves  growing further apart until you live in separate worlds where you share  the business of life, but never touch each other where the heart lives and  dreams. From there it is only a small leap to the cataloging of petty  hurts and daily failures that leaves so many couples bitter and  unsatisfied with their mates.  So choose carefully and well. If you do, you will have chosen a partner  with whom you can grow, and then the real miracle of marriage can take  place in your hearts. I pick my words carefully when I speak of a miracle.  But I think it is not too strong a word. There is a miracle in marriage.  It is called transformation.  Transformation is one of the most common events of nature. The seed  becomes the flower. The cocoon becomes the butterfly. Winter becomes  spring and love becomes a child. We never question these, because we see  them around us every day. To us they are not iracles, though if we did not  know them they would be impossible to believe.  Marriage is a transformation we choose to make. Our love is planted like a  seed, and in time it begins to flower. We cannot know the flower that will  blossom, but we can be sure that a bloom will come.  If you have chosen carefully and wisely, the bloom will be good. If you  have chosen poorly or for the wrong reason, the bloom will be flawed. We  are quite willing to accept the reality of negative transformation in a  marriage. It was negative transformation that always had me terrified of  the bitter marriages that I feared when I was younger. It never occurred  to me to question the dark miracle that transformed love into harshness  and bitterness. Yet I was unable to accept the possibility that the first  heat of love could be transformed into something positive that was  actually deeper and more meaningful than the heat of fresh passion. All I  could believe in was the power of this passion and the fear that when it  cooled I would be left with something lesser and bitter.  But there is positive transformation as well. Like negative  transformation, it results from a slow accretion of little things.  But instead of death by a thousand blows, it is growth by a thousand  touches of love. Two histories intermingle. Two separate beings, two  separate presence, two separate consciousness come together and share a  view of life that passes before them. They remain separate, but they also  become one. There is an expansion of awareness, not a closure and a  onstriction, as I had once feared. This is not to say that there is not  tension and there are not traps. Tension and traps are part of every  choice of life, from celibate to monogamous to having multiple lovers.  Each choice contains within it the lingering doubt that the road not taken  somehow more fruitful and exciting, and each becomes dulled to the  richness that it alone contains.  But only marriage allows life to deepen and expand and be leavened by the  knowledge that two have chosen, against all odds, to become one. Those who  live together without marriage can know the pleasure of shared company,  but there is a specific gravity in the marriage commitment that deepens  that experience into something richer and more complex.  So do not fear marriage, just as you should not rush into it for the wrong  reasons. It is an act of faith and it contains within it the power of  transformation. If you believe in your heart that you have found someone  with whom you are able to grow, if you have sufficient faith that you can  resist the endless attraction of the road not taken and the partner  notchosen, if you have the strength of heart to embrace the cycles and  seasons that your love will experience, then you may be ready to seek the  miracle that marriage offers. If not, then wait. The easy grace of a  marriage well made is worth your patience. When the time comes, a thousand  flowers will bloom...endlessly.  *I'm no a hopeless romantic ok? hahaha*

      Just for the record, I'm not really that much into politics or international  relations. You'll have to excuse me if my opinions are misguided hehe....   Anyway, I was watching the news this morning, and it looks like the Angelo  dela Cruz issue isn't over yet. Ok, maybe it is over but it's definitely starting  another bigger issue-that of our involvement in this world wide war on  terrorism. It would seem that this Mr. Downer(?), the Australian ambassador(?) is really pissed off with the Arroyo Gov't for saving Angelo's  life by withdrawing the humanitarian contingent from Iraq. Thus giving in to  the demands of Islamic terrorists. This, Downer said, gives these terrorists  more power to terrorize more nations. BLAH BLAH BLAH, you know the  story anyway... hehe...  Others will argue that the war in Iraq is over and withdrawing our  humanitarian contingent from Iraq has nothing to do with the war. They were  only their to help rebuild Iraq. Well, the war in Iraq is definitely over but the  war on terrorism, which the Phils. is a supporter of, isn't-and this is clearly  an act of terrorism! GMA gave in to the demands of these terrorists... maybe  GMA shouldn't have joined the war on terrorism in the first place if she  couldn't hold her ground. Hmm...  What would she have done if  Angelo was held in Philippine soil by the Abu  Sayyaf? Would have she negotiated as cooperatively? Maybe we should give in to all the terrorists' demands? Maybe she is more  concerned on what the Filipino people will say to her than what the  international community will say to her ..  Well, drastic situations lead to drastic actions. Its tough being the president!
