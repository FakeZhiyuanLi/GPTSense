      Art class, mixing black and white tempera paint in a over used plastic container, a container made to hold my cheap paint, my fume paint I smell at 9AM in a small town, in a high school, I remember this. In a way I hate memories, I don’t want to be the woman staring off into the sunset, re-collecting, re-fragmenting the high school memories of America with hurting knees. That woman sits somewhere over filling her mouth with hypnotic stories that aren’t really true. Her brain is lying to her. I will remember those white plastic containers, sprinkled with other peoples past paint, color of high school creativity. However, with memories aside, the woman and I have something in common, my knees do hurt and they do creak.  Making the perfect gray scale, from black to white and in between, a rectangular piece of paper with my sloppiness, I had no patience within me. I couldn’t do it, I could picture it yet I couldn’t do it.  I am consistently aware of the weather/environment, I will write about it. The city is different with a micro-environment as structured as the social structure that checks and balances us. Micro-environment through micro-environment. So my old art class grey scales are my days, grey in the beginning, grey in the evening. Its my bell curve, peaked lightest in the middle then back down to subtle color. This is so optimistic. This is nice probability.  Cockroaches have been around me these days and not in the physical sense, but around me spiritually. With all seriousness, putting my logic in my back pocket, this is what I say and its true. I keep dreaming of cockroaches, and all this week, as I walk the streets, dead ones on their backs or on their belly’s with legs lay wrong sneak their way in my line of vision. In corners, near public garbage cans they lay near me. The nerves in my spine send error messages to my fingertips, making them jump on their own if they really could. Leg messages signal me to move faster. I try to forget.  This Mornings Walk  I am the weasel. I am the sleek long mass that conspicuously goes from one environment to another, the eyes on my weasel face aren’t as beady but still hold my heavy face like pin-tacks on the memo board. I love this in me.  Today I felt proud. I do seek opportunities and do what I have to do to get those met. Holding my own, I have proven my lie to be true making my lies reality. This lying, I don’t like however I also don’t like over-cooked squash, city dirt and puddles, and mean girls.  The weasel walk was walked this morning, sometimes looking but not looking too hard for the dead cockroaches. I found none but what I did find was a pigeon, dead. Cuddled to a corner of a cleaned entry way on Post street, it lied on its side, almost asking for more blanket due to a hog of a lover. It was gentle and tucked. It’s pink-red claws which showed years of electrical lines and city air were resting in its feathery bed of the birds stomach.  It lay almost asleep, it looked asleep but you see, birds don’t do this. My weasel instinct at first didn’t want to contemplate but opportunity arose and I beamed. What everyone considers dirty and disgusting has been lying dead before me. The cockroaches, the pigeons and her I am the weasel, opportunist. In all optimism, the well adapted, these beings have finally fallen and here I am one step up.  Today I wrote. I took the opportunity and love and life go hand in hand today. With a over used pencil in hand, barely able to fit in the palm of my hand, I keep laughing and observing this. Everyone says if you make a fist, the size of your fist is the size of your heart. Here, I, the weasel, small pencil, so used and small, fitting clumsily in the palm of my heart. How fucking beautiful and wonderful that the opportunity has been taken.

      Grey, Gray, cold shoulder air. My walk to work was blurry. There must have been objects along my path to my office, uneven pavement, sidewalk cracks, other hurried persons, speedy cars and loud buses. However, I can’t remember them. All of the sudden through a maze of objects, I am here, in this chair, which I swear gives me what you call ‘bed sores’ cause my ass is on it all day, staring at a monitor hoping to find excitement at what I stare at. Nothing more, nothing less. I have been blessed to have a vivid imagination, which does allow the time to pass. If only those objects that I go through everyday where of a tangible sort, something organic, alive and maybe colorful. Green? Tropics? Animals? Sands and rock? How did I become accustomed to these other lifeless objects of the ordinary path of me? Why do I ask open ended questions?  I fidget with my hair, finding what’s left of it and the pink bumps named mosquito bites I was given the other night. My five dollar haircut will not leave my mind. Five dollars! I came out looking better than a 45 to 50 haircut. The lady didn’t speak a word of English, I motioned what I wanted not knowing what I wanted. She did it beautiful. The first comment I got was that I looked like an elf. I didn’t mind that. Most people these days like elves and elf attire due to Hollywood. The fidgeting also involves the fact that I have been habitually scratching my mosquito bites from the night before. I saw her. She was a female mosquito and I knew this because female mosquitoes are most aggressive. I sort of believe reproduction induces violence in nature, female mosquitoes need blood to nourish their eggs hence aggressive biting. I wanted to get West Nile disease. Why would anyone want a disease? One weird answer comes to mind, because I could fight it. I could win the war, nature verses me. I suppose it’s foreign and unthinkable but I need to be honest. Yes, I did turn this over in my mind.  Realizing my horrible idea which probably wouldn’t amount to any mental fame, was odd in nature, I didn’t really shake it off. I kept wondering why a person would think that way. Writing this I look down at my thighs laying in this black bulky office chair, I think to myself how thick and unpleasant. I weigh about 105 pounds, yet, I feel obese. My job despite the glory of litigation lawyers and some of the interesting aspects of research and law libraries, I still find myself in a low shallow dirt hole, hibernating like a shrew eating what I can on the forest floor called grey corporate carpet we all know too well. I walk consistently looking or trying to find a reflection, trying to see if I am what I really think in the outside world. Is it the weird face mongrel with the large thighs and hips, short in height and shy in the face really me? People look so happy when I see this in me. I see girls free from any evils, guys happy with Starbucks Frappacino drinks in one hand and with glittery cell phones that light up their faces in the other. Everyone is content. The outside kills me.  At home, I am different. The apartment is free of clutter, clean and hospitable made by me. Joseph adds the comfortableness to the home. We are an equation. I am free there. The mirrors are soft. I don’t like to find my reflection there either but when I do half closed eye in the morning, it doesn’t seem so bad. It is until I reach the brisk air, the slamming of the front door that I crawl inside myself waiting for the next box to come out in ease, the warm, the security, the ideal.  Back to my box called office, I work busily, moving around, paper this paper that, making vague conversation with co-workers hiding the true feelings I have about life, nature and the mind. Sometimes I let out my true ideas or Ideology, I forget where I am and start speaking opening accompanied with nervous fidgeting. In a flash I see myself, standing their moving about, smiling, speaking, feeling everything I say with excitement only to look over at the other party, seeing their blankness expression or half cocked smile seep out. I stop myself immediately. Excuse myself by saying “Who am I to think this”, walk away. In these moments I think of all the nature documentaries I have seen on so many different species. Their lives are engrained in my mind, their movements, their clumsiness at times and their love. These living organisms are what they are, nothing more. It all seems so simple for the mind to be this way but hard on the body just to live in environments with nature violence, different than human violence. I find so many parallels in life that make sense, and when I see this I am ashamed on how I act in my mind. How dare I see myself in these ways, how dare I entomb myself. So you see disease makes sense. I can finally escape for one second, and be part of those documentaries that I watched in the soft blankets and pillows, as body v. nature. Nothing more, nothing less.
