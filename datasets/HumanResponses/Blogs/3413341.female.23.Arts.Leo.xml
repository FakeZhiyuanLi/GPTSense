       Yeah, so I have a blogger now.  Again.  Not sure how often I'll be updating it, but I'll try to keep it often for the masses, hungry for news of My Interesting Life.  Yes.  So, what's up with me?  Well the job's going great.  The car wasn't, I had to get about $600 worth of brake work done on it last week.  Good news:  aforementioned Job lets me be able to pay for this stuff without too much heartache.  So yay, my car is working.    Let's see, what else?  Looking forward to the BBQ this long weekend, and hopefully seeing some people from school on Monday.  But that's about it!  Last night I had a dream I was on Survivor with Rupert and everyone from the All Stars season.  Turns out, they all HATED him.  They made fun of him and made him cry.  I was like, "But it's RUPERT!  He's the people's favourite!"  So then they hated me too.  It was lame.  Okay, until next time!

       Yes, this weekend was good.  The BBQ at Paul's was a blast, I had lots of fun.  Thanks Paul!  Can't wait for the PJ party.  :D  Friday was fun, I saw Van Helsing (terrible movie, btw) with Sabrina and Mike, and then we played video games at his house.  I met them downtown after work and Mike bought us dinner (thanks Mike!) and a failure of a margarita.  Man, I didn't know you could make them taste that bad.  Egh.  Still, we had fun and there was lovely rain.  I like when it rains hard all night and then you wake up having dreamed of rain.  Today I went to the dam at Capilano river, and it was gorgeous.  Spent some time with people from school up there, laughed at people getting too high for their own good.  General good times.  I thought I'd never been to the dam before, but as we were walking up I had a flashback from some elementary school fieldtrip there...it was very odd.    Tomorrow my mum leaves for England (she'll be gone for 2 weeks), so I better say bye to her tonight since I'll be at work tomorrow when she goes.  And I guess I should go to bed early tonight to get my schedule back in order...I gotta get up at 5:45am if I want to go to the gym tomorrow.  Bleh.  I hate mornings.  Well, that's it for now!

       Melinda (see above) graduates from SFU today!  And there was much rejoicing.  Well...tomorrow, anyway.  Unfortunately I can't be there today, but we're going to party it up tomorrow night in her honour.  Work is still good, and now it's sunny so I am happy.  I've been SUPER tired all week for some unknown reason, so I'm going to try to recover this weekend between games and fun things that have yet to be planned.

       Over the weekend I got to see Harry Potter, which was really good.  Fun BBQ at Paul's too, and I even managed to fit in a bubble tea in there.  So all in all, a successful weekend.  This week is my 5 year anniversary with Mike.  We're both pretty busy, him especially, so it looks like we're just going to go for dinner Friday night, if he's got time.  There's a possibility of going to Whistler for a weekend in August once he's not so busy, so I'm trying to figure out where we should stay and such.  I've never actually been there, but he's too busy to plan it so I'll have to see what half-baked thing I can come up with.  So yeah.  Work's going well and my cat's killing birds like there's no tomorrow.  Things are good!   P.S.  If anyone knows of a good place to stay in Whistler, let me know!  I'm not sure what I mean by "good", so just suggest anywhere that you know of.  Thanks!

       K, so I've had my gum surgery scheduled for a couple of months now, to be done in a couple of weeks.  Well on Thursday I called them to ask about getting that medication that I got last time perscribed, and they called me back and left a message saying "Um, you don't need gum surgery.  Call us back."   So I did, today.  Turns out they have no record of me needing further surgery and I need to come in next week so they can figure out where to do it.  Wtf?!  I asked them why they scheduled the surgery in the first place, and the lady was like, "I don't know, I didn't do it.  I have no idea why you are scheduled to have it done."  I told them I found it a little concerning that I didn't even find out about this until  I  called  them , and they had nothing to really say to that.  What The Hell.  I guess I would have just showed up there ready for my surgery, and  then  they would have said something?    What is wrong with people?

       Well this is my last week on the show I've been working on.  It's been fun but uncommonly rocky, from everything I've heard.  Which I guess is a good thing for me, since it means the next production should go a lot smoother by comparison.  In theory.  :)  I've got next week off since my next contract starts on the 26th, so it will be good to relax a little.  Hopefully get some camping done, if I can convince anyone to go with me.  Unlikely, but hey.  You never know.  Looking forward to a little surgery on Monday, and maybe a trip to Whistler if Mike ever ends up booking it.  Should be good!

       My week off rocked.  The Casbah.  Basically, it was great.  Thanks to Mike for a fantastic 2 days up in Whistler.  We didn't cheap out at all, which hurts my bank account but I'm glad we did it the way we did.  We had  tons  of fun, and I'll never forget it.  Yay!  :)    We went camping with Sabrina and Des when we got back, and that was lovely too.  Saw the northern lights!  Apparently there were bears but we didn't see any of those.      So now it's back to work, but my new project looks cool and the new people I'm working with seem nice.  And it's my birthday this weekend, so I have  no  complaints.  Well, except that I must've hit a pothole when we went camping, because I bent my tailpipe and now it rattles and makes my car sound like it's going to fall apart.  But other than  that , no camplaints.  :D
