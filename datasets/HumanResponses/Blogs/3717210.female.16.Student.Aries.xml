      Does anyone else find her annoying?  I mean, she's a fraction better than her older sister Jessica, but admit it, they are both ditz's.  I mean, neither of them know how to use a broom, let alone hold it.  I mean, it just makes me frustrated that some stupid person like that can make it big in this world.  Why do people like that get their own tv shows and their stupid record deals and everything when that's all they can do...and hardly that.  It's like any actor these days that makes it big, is just not happy enough with the odd millon or so that they make.  They need to put out a record album so they can make even more money so they can sit on their ass and pay people to take a shit for them.  Really now.  Hilary Duff did it, Ashley's doing it, and before long some other new young, 'hottie' will be doing it as well.  I guess it's a blonde thing.  Just kidding.  I have nothing against blondes.  Just people who really are dumb.  Not like, the mentally challanged...I mean the people who dont even bother to learn anything, like 2+2 and how to hold a broom and how to not cry when they brake a nail.  You know, the simple things in life.  Anyways...enough about them haha.  I never did watch Big Fish.  The preveiws looked dumb and no matter what I hear from anyone who's seen it and liked it, I just don't think I would.  I don't know.  Maybe some other time I will watch it.  But untill then there is this movie called EuroTrip.  That's a funny movie.  I was surprised that they showed a mans penis in the movie.  Well, actually, many men's penis's.  But they were all old and wrinkly and it was sort of yuck.  But a huge improvment from just a naked ass that was probably a womans anyway.  Its disgusting how they only show womens breasts on movies now a days.  Youd think that with the way the world is progressing things would, well...change.  Like I mean, we used to and some still do look down upon people with body peircings.  but more and more people are getting them, proving that we aren't all prudes.  That though some people can't learn to take change in their stride, most others can.  Which is good because I myself have a nose ring and plan on getting an eyebrow ring.  My friend Leslie has an eyebrow ring and she plans on getting another.  Trust me, they look pretty good with two of them...we seen this cute guy at the movie gallary and he had two eyebrow rings and a tounge ring and that inbetween the lip and chin thing done too, and he was mighty cute!  Serisously.  But yeah, we are of course, the only two in our group of friends that have anything other than our ears pierced (yeah we have that done too).  Leslie wants to get her bellybutton peirced just for kicks...not to show it off or anything, but just to have one.  Shanna (my other friend) wants to get her bellybutton pierced too.  Shanna just has this thing called an uncooporative father.  Me and Leslie on the other hands have what you might call, cool parents.  Well, I have a cool mom, she has the cool parents.  My dad is a whole nother story Ill tell you about tomorrow.  That reminds me, I was supposed to drop off his father's day card...shit.  Ill do that tomorrow too ahha.  This whole my friends have a job and I don't thing sort of sucks because, while they are at work, I am at home thinking of things to do when they get off of work or am babysitting which is cool because that is a job, technically.  Cats are suckers man.  I was just torturing mine (not really but I was trapping her under a blanket so she'd stay by me and it didn't set well with her) and she darted so fast when I let her go...now I was like here kitty kitty kitty kitty...and she came, as always.  Her name is Fred...my mom says its short for Fredriqa (something like that) but it's really not, she just says that because Fred is not really a girls name so she sort of feminized it.  We have two other dogs as well...Tess, and Old English Mastiff, and Angel, a Land/Rotweiler mix.  Tess is huge and Angel is fat.  Sam, my evil younger step sister has a mini weiner dog named leah (the spelling on that just doesnt look right so ill pronunciate it for you...lee a...thats how it sounds when you say it) she's pretty cute though...her and the cat always hold an all star wrestling match in the living room...you can catch it at 8 pm on sundays haha just kidding.  But my pussy can kick her weiners ass.  Haha I like to say that because it sounds perverted.  That's another thing about me...Im sort of a pervert.  Not bad...just the funny haha jokes about perverted things.  So anyways, im bored, your bored, we are all bored...im gonna get the hell out of here.  Maybe watch EuroTrip yet again...or maybe my all time favorite movie the leauge of extradinary gentalmen. (that was naughty...haha...thats like my favorite saying from that movie).  Catch yall later! (yall as in who ever might be reading this considering I havent told anyone about it yet so I might actually be talking to a virtual wall for all I know...go ahead and leave some comments or something...so I know im not alone in here haha).

      My name is RobYn.  I live in Nekoosa, Wisconsin.  Unfortunatly this is in the USA, and, as you will soon learn, I am no longer a 'proud citizen of America.'  I have long Brown hair, blue eyes, and am about 5'6.  Oh yeah, and I have a nose ring that I absolutely love.  Im not much on school, but I survive.  I get pretty good grades.  I take German as my foriegn lang. class, and ich liebe es.  Lol, I love it, German is a great langauge to learn, and contrary to what people say, it is an easy one to learn.  Anyways, in winter I like to snomobile, and in summer I like to swim.  I love to read and write.  I write a lot of poetry, and am actually being published.  I also would have been published again, but I waited too long and never sent in the stuff, but oh well.  I got a whos who for school and never sent that in either.  I guess I just didn't really have the time to sit down and do any of it.  Being a 16 year old girl with her license and a car, there isn't much time for anything these days.  Although I don't have a 'job' I do babysit a lot, which is nice because it pays for car insurance and gas money.  I always have plenty left over for shopping and movies as well.  So the way I see it, I don't need a real job.  Im content being an irresponsible teen spending my summer and money on things I don't really need.  Some people say there is plenty of time to be dead, so live life to it's fullest.  I say there is plenty of time to be responsible, so take advantage when you can!  Lol.  If I've come off as a flaky brat who likes to shop and go to movies, your partly wrong.  Shopping is alright, but definately overrated.  I love to go to the movies and do whenever I can.  (For example, yesterday my friend Leslie and I went to Stevens Point (Wisconsin Rapids was just to boring) to see the movie Dodgeball.  It was hilarious).  But Im not a flaky brat.  I'm an outspoken person who fights for what I believe in.  I don't just jump on the bandwagon whenever some new fad comes out.  If I don't like something I don't pretend to.  I believe in being honest.  Too bad if it hurts someones feelings or goes againts anothers beliefs, the truth is better than lies.  And don't get me wrong, I am not a completely honest person either.  There's the whole mom thing.  I don't exactly lie to her, I just don't tell her everything like I used to.  I used to tell her everything when she didn't freak out about it.  But now that I have my license, I'd just rather keep some things to myself.  I am a responsible drive, but sometimes a little crazy.  Don't worry, I never put anyone in danger.  But if some dude with a mustang (*cough cough, not mentioning any names, Cough*Dustin*Cough) decides to tailgate me, Im not going to drive like a saint ya know.  But anyways, ever since I got my license, she worrys too much.  She freaks if she hears me say something about what happend this time when I was driving, or what happend that time when I was driving.  I think that as long as I have things under control, there is no need to tell her.  Everythings cool, ya know?  Anyways, I put in a movie about 15 minutes ago and now am missing it.  It's Big Fish.  I heard it was a pretty good movie, so I am going to go watch it now.

      So, I know I haven't blogged in a while, but I am making up for it now.&nbsp; Well, not much has happened since I last wrote in here.&nbsp; My mom and step-father might be getting a divorce.&nbsp; Well, I am pretty sure they are, this next weekend they are leaving for the weekend to discuss things.&nbsp; My mom doesn't want to fight around us anymore, and I thank her for that.&nbsp; I hate it when they fight.&nbsp; I just hope they get this done and over with because I am sick and tired of feeling like a stranger in my own home.&nbsp; Anyways, I was at my cousins graduation party today.&nbsp; She obviously doesn't have many friends, because it mainly consisted of family, friends of the family, and a little group of her friends.&nbsp; I almost feel bad for her.&nbsp; Almost.&nbsp; Anyways, I seen my father there and I gave him his late, late, late father's day card.&nbsp; He didn't mind.&nbsp; Next weekend while my mom and step-father are gone I am going to go to my dad's and we are going to put new brake pads and stuff on my car.&nbsp; I am sort of excited.&nbsp; We don't do much together and it is nice to sort of develope a relationship with him.&nbsp; Man I really need a job if I am going to keep up with this stuff.&nbsp; Babysitting pays well, but not well enough to pay for insurance, my cell phone bill, and then car crap plus gas money while having anything left over to save.&nbsp; Jeez...I am hoping to get a job more around when school starts because then all the people who wanted a job for the summer only will leave and then the people going back to college will leave, giving me more opportunities...I hope.&nbsp; Wow it is getting late.&nbsp; I am tired, so I think I am going to hit the sack.&nbsp; Guten Nacht!&nbsp;
