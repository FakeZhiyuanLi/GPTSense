      Hello once again friends. I don't know if any of you have, but I have been noticing many different people bashing Halo, complaining about people liking it, saying it is a gay game and such. I, quite frankly, would like to know where the hell this is coming from. Halo is one of the best games I have ever played, and I am seriously not exaggerating. I don't say this because of "great" graphics, for as it is now, the graphics are nothing compared to those of more modern games. I am saying this game is so great because of the gamble. That is really ALL that matters in a game. Of course the graphics affect the gamble itself a bit, but when it comes down to it, gamble is all that matters. And as a matter of fact, Halo completely revolutionized gamble for first person shooters on consoles.  Halo was the first game to scuffle include vehicles in a console video game in a manner that was fun and actually added to the game, rather than detracting from, or not doing anything for it. Vehicles add a whole new element of strategy to the FPS genre. And Halo planning out the vehicles amazingly, including just what was needed, and for me just what was wanted. It inelastic a tank, a jeep with a mounted machine gun, and a hovering alien vehicle with from mounted plasma cannons. The alien vehicle, the ghost, is the fastest vehicle in the game, able to simply hover over many obstacles otherwise unavoidable for other vehicles. It is prefect for the annoyance vehicle, as it makes it difficult for vehicles and people to turn around, a strange side affect of its plasma weapons. If someone is in a tank, you could probably take them out with the ghost, and could most certainly make it possible for some one else to, by plains the part of the wasp and circling about the tank, stinging it with your plasma, barely eluding its cannon, while someone else on your team uses some well placed grenades, or rockets, to finish it off.  The tank is your all out assault vehicle, able to fit many people, and quite defensible for the pilot. It has two weapons, it's main assault cannon, and it's machine gun, which is mainly used between cannon fires, as it take a while for the cannon shells to reload. Tanks are mostly used for either a head on assault of the enemy, or hiding out on a hill and sniping with the tanks cannon. If you have a whole group of enemies running with your base's flag or something, the tanks is the perfect tool to take them all out at once. It is also a wise choice for a distracting, as you can park it right next to a wart's at the enemies base, and have someone get the flag, run, get in the tank, and you could fire a tank shell, and in the confusing of the impending explosions the flag carrier could switch from your tank to the near by wart's, and drive away while you fight off the enemies to the death, giving your friend time to score a point unnoticed.  Now, speaking of the wart's, it is my personal favorite vehicle of the game. It allows for the most strategy, and when properly used, the most affective assaults in capture the flag. The wart's sports three available seats, one of them being the driver, another being the side passenger, and the last being the top mounted chain gun, one of my favorite weapons in the game. The wart's has so many uses, I won't even bother to name them all, hell, I won't even bother to name more than one, because one is all you will need to see the awesome effectiveness of this vehicle. What you do, is you get the wart's fully loaded, the side seat guy preferably having a pastor and shotgun combo, because he will only be close range. You then drive over to tea enemy base, using the hills for cover, and start to circle the base, your chain gunner firing every which way to suppress the enemy, your side seat passenger throwing all the granted he has but one. You don't want to go around the same way the whole time, so try to switch it up, and after one or two times around, have your side passenger jump out and into the enemies base, using his last grenade and putting his pistol/shotgun to use. He then grabs the flag, and times his exit of the base so that he exits right into the wart's, and by this time, you should have gotten some backup, and should be able to drive the artist away Farley safely.  Now folks, that was only a tiny bit of strategy in this immense game, and it was only to get you to see the picture of great this game truly is. The maps are designed perfectly, and all the strategies I gave apply to just one of these many great, and amazing maps, blood gulch. Now folks, there is so much more I could go into about why this game knocks the socks of all the other fps of its kind, such as the great weapon variety, and the AWESOME LAM parties, but quite frankly, I have a life, and would like to get to it. Now, if this hasn't convinced you, I don't know what will.

      Well folks, I figured I would start off my blog on a light note, something unimportant, and hey, what is more unimportant than anime(okay, so there a few things, oh well..) Anyhow, Akira is about a set of children on which scientific experiements were preformed, giving them amazing powers of death and destruction, able to bend reality with their minds, tearing things and people to shreds, and controlling the minds of others. These children were horrible mistreated, and one by the name of Akira, went insane and killed many people, ending up destroying tokyo. It ends up being up to a kid in a biker gang to fight the children and kill Akira before he can repeat his past massacre. Well, people say that the animation of this film is poor, and that the plot is weak, but I strongly disagree. I believe the plot to be strong, and quite gripping, leaving you on edge. I also find the art to be mezmorizing, constantly amazing you with giant spurts of blud(always a good thing) and great character design. I also love how the motorcycles were drawn, and the drama encompassing the motorcyle gang fights. I pretty much just can't see how anyone could not like this movie, and believe it to have been revolutionary for the anime scene.

      Well, I am just now starting up, and want to get the correct impression across before any assumptions are made. I do not think the world of myself, however much it may look it, and I certainly don't think I know everything. I will admit that I tend to have a hard time accepting different opinions than my own, but hey, this is my blog ;) Anyhow, I plan to post my personal opinions on everything from politics to anime's, and if I happen to get any reader's than more power to me! Hope to talk to you soon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Sincerely,                                                                                                                                                     Jeff Graham
