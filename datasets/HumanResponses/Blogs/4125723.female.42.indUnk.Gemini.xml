      Well I'm finally done at McDonald's for the school year! I only have to make an appearance once a month to keep my manager status until my return next summer.  I'm only slightly excited about my return to my school job, mostly because I spend sooooo much time in the main office the first month.  I would rather be in my room with kids.  That is my job and I don't feel like I get paid to do secretarial work.  Plus my boss (the principal) can be a difficult person to work for.  She sometimes jumps the gun and draws her own conclusions on things and then reacts without finding out what is  really  going on. On the lighter side....I had a nice day on Tuesday.  I was invited to go on a picnic with 3 of my friends from McDs.  We had a really nice afternoon!  They are all younger than me but they all make me feel like one of their peers.  I have a real problem lately with people treating me like a "mother figure".  Which is understandable since I work with teenagers and I'm old enough to be their mom, but it just bothers me....I wish they would just see me as an...equal?? or hmmm I don't know,  I just don't want them to see me as different because I'm older.  Not sure if that makes sense or not but that's sorta how I feel.

      Lots to rant about today.  Like I've said in previous posts...I don't know what I would do with out my Zoloft!  At the end of the school year last year my husband bought me a jeep.  Well I haven't seen too much of it because my 17 year old has it 85% of the time.  That really doesn't bother me too much but it drives her step dad INSANE.  I personally think both of them are about nuts.  He actually goes out and writes down the mileage and calculates the cost of gas that she should be putting in it!  *sigh*  I personally give up.  I could really care less anymore.  It's like everyone is running around and not seeing what all this is doing to me...and how totally impossible it is for me to cope with the tug of war that is going on with my emotions.   Chelsea has no idea what the big deal is...she just wants to look cool driving the jeep....and Jack is....well Jack is just being himself....trying to prove that Chelsea is getting away with too much.  I just want to crawl in a hole and hybernate for this entire year.

      Going school clothes shopping today. Also stopping by to see my godson in the hospital. He recently threatened to commit suicide and is now receiveing help for his drug dependancy and emotional problems. Taking him a big mac and fries...(now that's gotta cheer him up!) I love shopping! It lifts my spirits just thinking about buying new clothes!

      I hate dieting.  I love food too much!  My husband always makes fun of me and says that food means way too much to me.  I can't stick to any way of eating.  I used to love doing low carb, but it's so hard to keep the food around.  Or I wish I could just be happy with my body, but when I take that approach I just get bigger and bigger over time.  I would truly be happy at the weight that I am at right now, if only I would just stay there.  I feel so overwhelmed with everything else that is going on around me that it just seems like too much to have to concentrate on what I eat too!  Here's a list of things I have to do this year...   get chelsea ready for college  participate in chelsea's basketball and soccer teams (concession stand help, etc...)  keep my body from falling apart (as I feel that it is doing right now!)  get allyson on track so she doesn't fail 5th grade  go back to my school job and all the stresses that are associated with that.  get the house ready for chelsea's graduation party   etc.  etc.  etc.   It may not seem like much but it overwhelms me.  Good thing for zoloft!!!  It keeps me sane.

      I've never done this before (blogging).  I thought this would be an interesting avenue to put my feelings down....and believe me, I have the full gamat of feelings!  One minute subdued and the next a raging lunatic.  Today I am sleepy as usual.  My work as a manager of McDs has me on my feet for 7-8 hours and working until 1-2am.  so my sleep schedule is far from being normal.  i'll be back on a more "normal" schedule when school starts and I start back at my job with middle school kids.  I wanted to save this wonderful quote I found yesterday about those wonderful wiskers that start popping up on our face/neck during these years...  "I refuse to think of them as chin hairs.  I think of them as stray eyebrows!" Janette Barber (once the head writer for the Rosie O'Donnell Show)
