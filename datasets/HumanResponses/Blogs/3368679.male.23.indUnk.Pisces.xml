      Montgomery Brin. Chandler Scott. Jim Glaub. I drop these names in conversations as if they were commonly used prepositions in the English language. To people who know me, they know what they mean. These are all major ex boyfriends, lovers, flings or whatever you might like to label them.  All of these men have left major impacts on me. They haunt me. They torture me. They come to the forefront of my mind after a bottle of wine, or my fourth martini. Sometimes they appear as soon as my second martini.  Two things can be said of all of them. One, they were all passionate and intense. Two, they were all brief. The longest weighing in at a grand two months. Yet they are still with me. The influence they wield over me today is much greater then when I was with them.  My relationships are much like earthquakes.  The actual event is quite quick, but the aftermath can last a lifetime.  These men have become institutions in my life. They each represent grand ideas and concepts. I use Montgomery Brin to symbolize eternal love and love in its purest form. I use Chandler Scott to represent my struggle with not being able to want what I really need. And Jim Glaub is the representation of my wanting what I should not have and don't need.  I hold onto these men. I keep them close and I refer to them with shocking consistency. They hold me down and haunt me. And in looking at how they have latched onto my memory I am given cause to worry. I worry that I will not ever be able to move on. I worry that they will hold their massive sway for the rest of my existence. I ask, are my hands too full with the past to be able to catch the future?    Names have been changed to protect the week and frail.

      My good friend Jill Pua recently broke up with her boyfriend, Frances, of nearly eight years.  For her the relationship had just dwindled off.  She still loved him, but she just did not want to date or have a relationship with him anymore.  The relationship had, much like an appliance or bottle of champange, run is course.  It was empty, no longer heating up and had lost all fizz.  Upon coming to terms with this, she politely informed Frances and ended things.  Then came the interesting part.  She told only me of this occurrence.  Three days after the fact, I might add.  Her family and especially her other friends were not to be told for fear of how they would react.  Slowly word got out and the reaction was quite impressive.  Tears, cries of "why!", to complete devastation rippled throughout her inner circle.  This reaction merely made her experience with the breakupeven worse.  A month after the earth-shattering event, still not everyone was aware of it.  She was at her sister's baby shower and relatives and friends of the family were questioning the absence of Frances.  Jill's sister pulled all of the women into a separate room and broke the news to them.  The cries could be heard in the other room.  The baby shower for a moment took on the feel of a funeral.  Composure was regained and it was decided that they would not tell the men, for fear of how they would take it.  The party continued with an undertone of loss and regret with no one speaking a word on the subject of the horrific breakup.  The question that this situation creates is: what is a boyfriend?  Is a boyfriend someone you love, who supports you and listens to you?  Is he someone who makes you feel whole and complete?  Is a boyfriend all of those wonderful, beautiful things that society has made them out to be?  Or is a boyfriend merely an accessory?  Is he a social accessory used for adornment in the same vein as a Rolex, diamond ring or mink coat?  I ask this because in looking at the breakup of Jill and Frances, the calmest, most sane  and coherent reaction came from Jill herself.  The relationship was over so she let it fall off and be done.  While the people around her were the most devastated.  So one asks, was Jill dating Frances for herself or for her friends and family?  Was he really no more then an accessory to her societal wardrobe?  Do people date for the sake of having a boyfriend?  Someone to show off at dinner parties and nice restaurants.  Do people really look better holding someone's hand as they walk down the street or watch a movie?  Maybe they do.  And if this is the case, is it not perfectly acceptable to date for what many consider to be superficial reasons?  If your boyfriend is really your social accessory shouldn't he be beautiful, drive a nice car, dress well and have a high paying job?  One must stop and think this through as well.  Ask yourself, just as you would at Tiffany's, is this really the accessory I want?  A boyfriend isn't cheap.  You have to feed them, buy them gifts on the holidays and it costs money to parade them around and show them off.  So before you settle on a boyfriend make sure you really want him over a princess cut, tiffany set, platinum, diamond ring.

      I opened my refrigerator today and suddenly my entire existence became completely clear to me.  I was putting a bottle of champange in for chilling for future consumption.  I know that I usually drink only red wine, but it is getting warmer and sometimes a glass, or bottle, of chilled sparkling wine is quite nice.  I was placing the bottle in when I realized I had no room for it.  This is odd because, as anyone who knows me will attest to, I do not eat.  Well, I do eat, just not frequently, and never to the point where I would have food in my refrigerator.    I looked through the mess that was in there and found absolutely nothing that was actually able to be consumed.  There were four empty bottles of fruit punch, empty containers of capers and an empty Britta water filter thing.  I realized that I do have this amazing habit of not throwing things away when I am done with them.  I find it easier on an emotional level to just put back the empty bottle of fruit punch into the refrigerator rather then throw it in the garbage.    After clearing out the debree from binges long since past, I realized that my refrigerator is a metaphor for my existence.  I never throw anything away.  Long after I am done with something I am still clinging to the remains of it, the empty packaging.  When a relationship is over, I am still there.  I never let it fully go away.  I am haunted by my past, but only because I keep my past in my present.    I realize that it is time to clear out my past.  Like my refrigerator.  Because, like my cluttered refrigerator, when I am ready to place a new item in it I might not have room for it.  Although I do like pretty packaging, it really serves no purpose once the contents are gone.  Also, the small remnants sometimes begin to mold and stink up the rest of my life.  So, I really must learn to throw things out when the time come.  It is something to work on for sure.

      My last posting, months ago, dealt with memory.  Specifically my memory of past loves.  I looked back on these affairs with great admiration and spoke of the lasting impact that these people had on my life.  I read the essay and thought it was quite eloquent.  I took a stance early on that I was not going to change names of people.  I wasn’t defaming anyone or degrading their character or lack there of.  I was simply discussing and musing on my life and life as a whole.  And I felt there was no reason to change names.  Protection was not needed in the life of Nathan Cann.   I recently returned to my blog after an absence.  Upon revisiting there was a comment from one of the ex’s mentioned in the previously mentioned posting.  He told me to remove the posting immediately.  I was shocked.  I was shocked for several reasons.  First, that he had found my blog at all, which is nice that he is still looking into me.  Second, that he wanted it removed.  I at no point said anything negative about him, and was in fact quite nice.  And third, that my memory was so inaccurate.  I at once remembered the truth about this boy.  That he had stolen from me.  That he had cheated on me.  That he was an all around flake.  He was someone that no one that I had ever met that came into contact with him had anything flattering to say.  He was really an all around looser.  Yet my memory of him was of love and of regret.  I realized at that moment that hindsight is not 20/20.  It is blurred and tinted with colored lenses of the emotions of that particular moment.  And that memory is only really real when you are not yearning for it to be the present.  You must separate yourself from it enough to actually look at it.  So I realize that maybe I shouldn’t use real names.  Some people are far to week and far to smarmy to be able to handle it.  So I will go back and change the names of the others.  But here is my message to that commentator (whose name will never again be mentioned, but you know who you are).  I will be leaving your name intact until you return the items that you stole from me.  You know what they are, if not I will give you a list.  I had long since reconciled that I would never see them again.  With this comment knocking reality back into my memory of you, I want them back.  You are far too much of a disappointment for me to allow to get away with steeling from me.  So, that is the offer, and this is your chance to fix the place you hold in my real memory and have your name removed from my blog.
