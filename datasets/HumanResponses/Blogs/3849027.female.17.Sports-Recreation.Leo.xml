       Dreams are just dreams When they're stuck inside your head And all it takes is a little help from you You know it's true That dreams are for real When you see what I see And you feel it too We took the longest road Just to make it harder Let's do it all again   It only makes us stronger    &nbsp;   Dreams I guess we're just made of dream Nothin' else matters As long as we believe      I'm lookin' at you And I see my life Passing before my eyes And when the journey's over And all my dreams come true I'll dream of you        &nbsp;   What do you see When you look inside your heart A little thought Can walk a thousand miles And change your life When dreams lead the way The impossible is suddenly in sight Every step you take Just brings it all together You gotta keep the faith        &nbsp;   When all seems lost forever You're the one That keeps my hope alive My vision clearI'll spend my life with you Conquer fear We'll make it through Nothin' else matters As long as we believe I'm lookin' at you And I see my life Passing before my eyes And when the journey's over        &nbsp;   And all my dreams come true I'll dream of you I'll dream of you I'll dream of you....
