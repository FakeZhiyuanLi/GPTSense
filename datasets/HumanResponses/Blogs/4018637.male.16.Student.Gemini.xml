      You ever think about someone or something all day long, you just can't get it off your mind. It haunts your every thought and dream. You cant get it out of your mind. Well for the past few days I haven't been able to sleep at all. About three hours every night, I really don't like it, its really wearing on me. I guess its because I've been thinking so much lately. We went out to the rec-center the other night. The rest of my family went and swam, I stayed out and I found some people playing volley-ball. So after they invited all the people that came after me they finally invited me. It was fun to not have to worry about anything for a while, and hang out with people my age, and just have fun... It was cool. We're going later tonight. There's also an awesome skate park, with some really stupid people there. Oh, one thing about my blogs I'm never directing them at anyone( UNLESS I SAY SO SPECIFICALLY), all I write about is what's on my mind. Sometimes specific are but I never really direct them at anyone. Yeah so there... I like doing this though, I think its a good way to get things off your mind. That's one of two reasons I write, I also write because I think(In my own opinion) some people need help. They may not notice it, but I'll always tell or show the truth on here. I would do nothing more or anything less. And I know that I may not always be right or have a just reason for doing so, but that's why I want feedback. Its nice to know what you people think. Yeah so enjoy (if you like), and if not then what ever, everyone has an opinion. The more and more I think about it, the more I think Blink is the band for me. They've gone threw all the same things, and have all the same fellings as myself. Plus I can play a lot of they're music. Ah the simple things in life...

      You ever wonder if(or when) it'll all end? Just stop, the whole world just collapses. Everything is in total chaos. The fact that you may not live to see another day, that you could get into a car accident or get attached. Or if you'll ever find "the one", like your true love? I mean look at how many people are in this world, very few ever find "the one" in there life. That's why no body should ever take life for granted. You do life will pass you by, and your left wondering where it went. Never think that you like (or love) someone, and not give it a chance because of a mistake they've made. Because chances are if you do, you'll never run into some one like that again. That's why I think people who don't want to date because they've been hurt before, and they don't trust people because they're scared of being hurt are not very nice at all to say the least. You have to give people a chance because if you don't give people a chance, you take a chance at missing your(or there) chance at life and all the joys that go with it. People who don't want to date because they don't want to be hurt, it goes with the territory. Plus not everybody is going to break your heart. You have to give them a chance, its just not fair not to. That's cutting there life line before they've even tried to use it. Life is a giant chance don't hide yourself and miss yours. It will destroy you sooner or later. Yeah but that's my look one it, obviously you have your own look on it. So post a reply Id like to know what you think.

      If anyone ever finds the way a girls mind works, it would be a great life saver for the rest of us. Really if anyone dose it would save the rest of us a huge hassle. I thought these friends of mine were goin out and I was in the way, but they weren't, now I feel stupid. They lead you up to something then make you jump off the deep end with out lookin down first, most girls play games, and most guys don't. I suppose it will never change. Oh well. So we went to the beach today, I was so bored everyone sat down for hours. I walked up and down the board walk at White Rock with my brother for a little over an hour and a half. When we got back I was fairly tired so I took my back-pack off and used it as a pillow I slept for a good while, when I awoke I found I had burnt my nose. It really hurts. Then we went to eat at this really cool place right on the water. I have to take the time to get my picture on here, along with all my new crew. Me and my brother are thinkin of goin to this paintball game/tournament, its 24 HOURS LONG. That's a lot of paintball, but its really fun, and it doesn't really hurt. Yup trying to figure out these people, there so confusing, Canadians I mean. Got some good pics of the water when I was at the beach.

      The ("") marks mean that im talking to someone.   What if in making things easier for others, you hurt yourself in the process. What if to let love between two people florish you take yourself out of the picture, leaving yourself hurt, alone and a firm wanting for the person still. In helping others you hurt or patensually distroy yourself. That knowing the one you love would be so much happier with another person. It is the best thing for the one you love, to let them go. But what about yourself, you have to evensually think about yourself. But in thinking about yourself you further hurt the one you love, making it even harder on them, and confessing yourself to them, making things even harder. Then reallizingit was selfish for you to do that and hoping that the one you made things so hard for..... will still want you. But through wanting you they hurt someone else. It really sucks for people. "I am so sorry Rachelle for doing this to you, in removing myself from the picture I hope you and Davis are happy together. I sincerly hope that you two are happy together. Just know that you are the only one I'm willing to do this for. Please forgive me for what I have done it was wrong and I am sorry".

      We can always picture our selves doing the most romantic or creative or best thing in love, but we never truly understand what to do went we get into the situation&nbsp;that we acually planed or dreamed about before. Like we can't comprehend what the best thing to do in the situation is, when we planed or dreamed about for so long. Its there, where the truly brave come about. They acusally put the plan to the test or into action. Not when someone is just looking to get into another's pants, but in true love/like relationships. The people that you like the most are the easiest to be with but they are the hardest to exsplain your fellings toward them. Or its people that have been hurt from past relationships that have the hardest time taking chances with love. If your in a relationship were your with someone like that, its not that they don't really feel that way about you, its just that don't what to be rejected, or hurt again. But being introduced to true love has a feeling like no other. You feel like no one could get you down, no one could ever hurt you because that love is always there to give a supporting hand when you've lost all others. That love can act as extra legs to your table when you've lost the others( like friends or family that have died or abandoned you). Love is the strongest thing there is, it can also be the frailest. It needs to be supported by both ends of the bridge otherwise it collapses, under the stress that this world has. Love is also a very strong word it should never be miss used, if so many could fell the effect. So this is what love is to me, it is many things to many people but this is my interpretation of it.

      Why do some people do the things that people don't want or things that will intentionally hurt someone else? They feel the need to hurt someone else to compensate for what they feel. Maybe its because they where hurt they where hurt themselves or that they didn't get some thing they wanted that they wanted from someone else. That in doing so that it will some how make the pain go away. That in destroying some one else they would lift themselves above the pain that was inflicted on them. But the truly indistinct thing in every case is that, it wont go away. You cant hurt someone else and expect yourself to feel better about being hurt. The truly sad thing is that everybody that's experienced it does it. And no one trys to stop the cycle that they go through. Even people who are the sweetest, nicest, kindest people will do it and they don't even know that they're doing it. THE PAIN DOESN'T GO AWAY, IT WILL ALWAYS BE THERE, UNLESS YOU FIND SOMEONE TO MAKE IT GO AWAY. In that I mean that, to get rid of the pain you need someone that you treasure higher, or come to like more. Love from another is the only thing that will make it go away, that's why I think its a bad idea to not date if you've been hurt. Because life will go on with out that person. You just have to give it a chance. People will hurt you but they will love and care for you.        Yeah but we were supposed to leave for China on Thursday(actually 2:30 flight out on Friday morning), but that day my dad got a kidney stone. When he went to the hospital they found that he had a dozen or so more. So he's having them blasted on Monday, we're going to Vancouver hospital for that. I finally got my Ipod... IM SO HAPPY. Its so cool and a really cool surprise, the guy sent the wrong one. I ordered a 15gb Ipod and he sent a 20gb, which has way more options. So yeah just hangin... As always I would appreciate feed back. Always like to know what you guys think, so if you guys have some differing thoughts throw some my way. Ok bye guys.... and girls.

      Its been a while since I bloged, I apologies. First the Internet was down for about a week, then everybody had excuses to get on before me, then they wouldn't let me get on so its not entirely my fault. Yeah well there's goin to be a rather large gap in my blogs, Ill try to make up for then by takin notes and stuff. Because I'm leaving for China on the 12th of this month. Ill right a journal over the period for you of my fans that like to read about me. I'm going with my Dad who is over there a lot on business so he decided to take me this time. Should be cool... Hmmm, I hate not being able to get your mind off of things. It gets really to be a real big pain in the ass. Especially when you want things to happen but they wont, or there trying to be stopped. They try to stop you from finding your way into there heart because there scared you might hurt them, and you cant convince them in all honesty that you wont. It sucks this is really hard. If young loves just a game then I must have missed the kick off. Yeah that's reminds me I cant wait to see football again. GO PATRIOTS... Yeah that's my favorite sport, In case you didn't know. Best sport on earth. So what do you guys think about my blogs tell me, I'ld like to know. I cant type as much as Id like. Hey I've got an Idea, you guys tell me what song I should learn and ill learn it. Ok thanks for reading.
