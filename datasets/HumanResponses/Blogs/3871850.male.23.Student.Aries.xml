      Yesterday when I on the way home.. I manage to see one of my sec sch Frenz-B.. When he ask me abt our the other Frenz-A.. I was stunned to heard that my Frenz-A's dad passed away becuz of illness.. I and Frenz-A were reali veri gd frenz in our sec sch days.. Yet he did not told me abt it.. I think the incident happened 2yrs le.. It was kinda disappointed.. We are frenz for 10+yrs le.. In the end, it was someone else who told me.. After thinking for one night, I finali begin to realise that he reali treats me as a gd frenz that why he did not wan me to know abt it.. Knowing that I will be worried abt him.. Nevertheless I reali hope that if there is anything that cropped up in the future again, he will let me know.. That I do..     In The End.. Its Only The Fittest Survive In This World.. If You Are Strong You Live.. If You Are Weak You Die.. That's The Truth!!    *MerQu&#124;s3*^^ aka *yeKai*^^

Edwin and Andrew.. I reali like them alot as they reali are my confidant especially Edwin.. Edwin reali know what I thinking most of the time and he understand how I felt.. while Andrew make a good kaki for me.. I hate to admit that in the end I loses both of them.. I guess so.. Actuali I alreadi cool down long time liao.. But I duno why I still can't open my mouth to talk to them.. I reali hope that time can turn back which is impossible.. so that I can patch up with them.. Anyway everything is too late.. I am sorry Edwin and Andrew.. pls forgive my childishness.. =(     There Once Were Two Men.. Who Travelled The Same Path For Ten Years..

      Sian ar today.. sibei boring lah.. LOLx.. I everyday also sian.. LOLx.. Anyway I today having a hard time writing that boliao essay lah.. Aiyo I write till chim xin le lah.. Then today see the Happy Fish last episode, ending quite lame but sibei sad.. Stay tune for Happy Fish II ba.. Maybe the ending much better.. After knowing red cheek missy name from my frenz on friday, I go on an island wide search in friendster see whether can find her bo.. Then today I finali manage to find my secretly admired red cheek missy friendster account.. Kinda heng and fately ba.. LOLz.. But sad loh.. status showed attached d[T.T]b Weepz.. Anyway the result is what I expected long time ago le.. Me like toad lusting swan flesh loh.. *Sigh*.. But hor she reali veri sweet and demure especially her rosy cheeks.. Except maybe abit short oni ba.. Anyway I think maybe the age chooses her dear over someone else in this era.. I always believe this "If it's yours then it's will be yours, if not force also no use.." But this saying is only true to some circumstances.. I think pursuiting what you want is the one and only best solution.. Let's hope that I will make it in the next era ba.. Bucks up and stop dreaming le lah YEKAI!!!      If You Should Lose.. Not Only Does Your Future Ended.. But Also The Future Of The One That You Are Trying To Protect.. The Fate Of The One I Protecting Is Depending On Me!!    *MerQu&#124;s3*^^ aka *yeKai*^^

      Today again is a peaceful day.. LOLx.. Anyway when I saw the news earlier this evening about that driver crashing into lots of cars and killing two people, it was kinda sad.. I mean they really very suay loh.. bo tai bo ji kena killed for nothing.. I always believe in this chinese phrase, "Shi Fu Bu Shi Huo, Shi Huo Duo Bu Guo" in other words it's means "If it's a blessing then it's not a disaster, if it's a disaster you want to escape also cannot." Haiz.. Anyway all lives are fated ba.. When it's time to go then you really need to go.. Who knows tomorrow what will happened.. To all my frenz out there.. pls take care especially those whom I really cherished alot one.. They should know who they are.. =p     In The End.. Its Only The Fittest Survive In This World.. If You Are Strong You Live.. If You Are Weak You Die.. That's The Truth!!    *MerQu&#124;s3*^^ aka *yeKai*^^
