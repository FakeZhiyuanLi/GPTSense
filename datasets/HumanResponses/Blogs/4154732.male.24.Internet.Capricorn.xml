I'm gonna need a new hard drive, I'm totally out of room again. World of computrs is doing a 200gig drive for 100 quid, will have to invest in one of those.   Looking back now I'm up to date on Season 5 of West Wing. Never did et that Hard Disk though.

      Wow i'm so easily dragged into stuff. Big brother has me again :[ Its a house full of wankers but i cant help but watch, thank god i dont have E4 any more. Ultima's chew up large portions of my time too, although i'm finally a bard and finding that my bard skills are pretty good in combat. Just need to learn some magic now, and how to fight, and get my strength up *groan*   Damn i'm still playing ultima

      Typical boring day at work. Having some trouble with shtty CSS implementation, nothing worth bothering abuot though. Found an old site that is well funny (tardblog.com). Unofrtunatley it seems to have been taken down but you can still get to it on archive.org. Spent some time looking for old sites i had done. Steve sent me the new alien vs predator trailer, cant wait to see that. Went home and installed AvP 2 again, will have to try and arrange some deathmatch fun.   Shame the tardblog went down, was worth a giggle

      Okay guys, i've updated the website to use XML insted of ASP now. Also my main webhosting is due to expire soon so i'm back to the good old blueyonder hosting again. What else have I been up to. Well airsoft is lots of fun, you can read more about that on www.bobzsquad.co.uk. Still working hard, and playing, well, kinda hard. Still lazy :] That'll do for now, catch you later.   Thought it would be worth posting to the blog again since i went to the trouble of fixing it

      So once we got everyone out the office last night I went and bought a few beers and me and dave toasted the office. Those few beers soon lead us to the waterside for a few more. The end result was me dave and bob drinking a bottle of tequelia.  Good Times :o)  If only my head didn't feel like someone was kicking it all nite (looks suspiciously at clare)

      Video games rule my life  Not only have i been obsessing over doom 3 and spending way to much time playing ultima, but the coutner strike source beta has edged in now too. It looks absolutely astounding, theres a video benchmark mode which shows off the best bits of the source engine, and they look good. It even supports surround sound. Can't wait to play half-life 2 on it. Thing is, CS:Source just doesnt look right. I think it's the player skins, they look a little too cartoony, too polished. The ragdoll physics looks a bit out of place too. Maybe I just need time to adjust, but overall I felt like i was watching Inflitration on the unreal engine. Still it is only a beta.  It's my last day at Aurora today. Can't really say I'm sorry as I'm sure most of you know how downhill this place had become so it's probably best that i'll be out of it real soon. Still I can't help but worry about the new place......

      Just got out of bed. Having trouble getting to sleep. Maybe a brain dump will help.  My boss caled me about half seven tonight, the deals all done, I'm starting work in Bellshill on Monday. I know that it's full of good opportunies/people/cash, but i just can't think positively about it.  The phone call took all the fun out of the night. Spent it perched on my bed watching TV, a film called "Three to tango", Neve Campbell is very cute. Had a few drinks to try and chill, but didn't help either way.  Wouldn't it be excellent if one of the jobs I applied for hired me tomorrow, then I'd move to a new job and feel good about the whole thing. I always find job hunting a daunting task, and starting at a new workplace quite intimidating. But I never dread it this much.  I like being quite a laid back person and hate to find myself moaning like this, just goes to show how much this is bothering me. Suppose I'm the only one that can do anything about it though.  to be continued ....

      Got the urge to LAN game again, maybe its doom 3. Find myself wanting to blast a few rounds of couterstrike with my friends, some team play on UT2004, and some good old DM in Doom. Could go a nice long game of rise of empires too.  Anyone fancy setting a date for one ?

      Went to see the office of my new prospective employer today. Eveyone was really nice, the office was very openand spacious, felt like a nice place to work. Still I don't know, something is beginning to feel very wierd about this whole thing. I mean I haven't enjoyed this process since it began, but the experience is leaving a very sour taste in my mouth. I think I'd feel more comfortable just washing my hands of it and moving onto something new.  Lets see if any of those jobs get back to me now.

      11 frames per second  I think it's time i upgraded my PC, Doom 3 is not my friend. Could use a nice new shiny P4 with DDR400 memory. With recent job/cash situations though looks like i can afford a P133 with 32Mb.  So, Half Life 2 finally starts streaming to steam users tommorow, and Counter-Strike Source unlocks for Condition Zero users wednesday, looks like the game drought is finally over.  I'm applying for jobs like crazy at the moment, so much so that i'm having trouble keeping track of which ones i've applied for. I have to find something closer / easier to get to than bellshill every day. Since I can't really afford the driving lessons at the moment I've managed to rope my dad into teaching me in a hired dual control car, or at least he will when i get my finger out and book one. Although before I do that I have to get my driving license renewed, it stills says I live with my parents which would invalidate any insurance. Even when I can drive will I be able to afford a car ? And if i get a car and a license then that still won't help with Bellshill cause as soon as I get that I'm applying for the police.  I'm getting dizzy now.

      So that's the weekend over then  At Janines 18th party on Saturday, got to witness my baby sister pissed on Apple Sours. Completed Knights of the Old Republic on Snday as a full Dark Lord of the Sith, it's always more fun being the bad guy. Sunday night went to see The Stepford Wives, not quite the laugh a minute I was hoping for, very dark comedy.  A now it's coming up on Monday again. Got to go back to work not knowing how long I have left in that office, or how long i'll still be working with Dave. Then I'll be sent to an office in Bellshill which means my travel time is upped to three hours a day. If I'm working 9 till 5 then i'll have to leave the house at half seven in the morning and get home about 7 at night. Plus theres the fact that I just don't want to do this job any more but i'm not qualified or experienced to do anything else. Suppose i'll be sending some more S1jobs applications today.  The immediate future looks pretty unhappy.

      So our fates were decided.  Aurora is no more (in about two weeks anyway). It's hitting liquidation. Theres a company willing to buy the client base and poach some of the staff (myself included). Daves out of a job, and I've got to resign before they'll offer me the position. Daves the only one that isn't going (since they already have web designers).  So here I sit, confused. My heads swimming. I feel soo shit for dave, kind of lucky for myself. But I dont want to move to a new job, or a new company. That Friday feeling has definately turned sour.  Fuck.

      So Friday the 13th ?  I wonder why Friday the 13th is supposed to be unlucky ? I'm pretty sure the number 13 is something to do with Jesus and his desciples, Judas being the 13th ?? And if that is the case where does come into it ?  However it came about, it is supposed to be unlucky. Now i'm not too superstitious, but I always find myself a little more cautious on one of these days. Today seems different though. It is after all a Friday so I should be relativvely relaxed and cheerful in anticipation of the weekend. Something feels wrong with today though. Theres a feeling of menace in the air, it's too tight and claustraphobic, too dark and close. It's like the feeling before a thunderstorm but without the static in the air, just the pressure that comes with it.  It just feels like somethings going to happen today, something bad.

      Dug out my old Magic the Gathering cards ona whim the other day. The visit to Ivors had made me think about them, and I fancied a game. Took them into work today and managed to sneak a couple of games. He beat me once of three, so not a bad start for a first timer.  Other than that today was dull as feck, nothing to note. No word from my boss on whats happening with our jobs. He's an asshole.

      My baby sister has just turned 18  Now while i'm glad that she's growing up, i'm still forbidding it. You see when I turned 18 I though "cool, i'm 18". However, now that she's turned 18 I think "Christ i'm getting old".  Anyhoo went for dinner with my sis (and her bf) and the parentals which was scrummy. Retreated back to the parentals house for a couple of beverages and a little celebration. Parentals are having a large BBQ on Saturday in her honour. Took my gun up to my mums last night to shoot at Del (the bf) but for some reason there was mass objections. I'm not doing it to be mean. You see this way we can find out if he's a pussy or not, it's all for the best.  Work finally paid me  some  of my wages and gave me a post dated cheque for the rest. This place is getting well beyond a joke. We grouped together and had a chat, and it's good to know that I'm not the only one thinking like this. What should we do ? Not much we can do until we get a straight answer as to what's heppening with the company.  And it's still raining

      So freaky weather we're having eh ?  Finally wrapping things up with AD. They're swapping my dud 9.6 volt battery for the 8.4v stoo was originally supposed to get. They'll cover my late bank charges, P&amp;P on the battery, and the gun hire that came after the 90 days (I compromised on this, clare was going for three - one for each time they told me "it'll be here")  So Stoo, you should be able to use your P90 soon !  AD are very appologetic and fairly helpful after the fact, but i'm still worried that they couldn't find their arse with both hands. With the opening of fire-support (retailer of the year 2004) and airsoft scotland theres plenty of other options now.  Wonder if  urlLink FFS  will start selling guns ????

      I honestly think AD are trying to kill me  Turns out the three batteries I ordered (2x9.6v and 1x8.4v) are all 9.6's. And one of the doesn't work. I've now to send them the fucked one and they'll send me an 8.4 instead. what's with these people ?  As for them being 500mAh (when the site clearly states 600mAh) the reply was "I'm confused, I don't know how they work"  I have to stop now, there's blood coming out of my ears .........

      Oh well back to work tomorrow ........  Wasted much of this weekend playing Knights of the Old Republic again, it's very satisfying making a dark side character and killing or toturing small animals. Hope KOTOR 2 lives up to the first one.  Still having problems playing Doom 3, it runs okay but after 15 minutes i'm a gibbering wreck. Will take me months to get through it at this rate.  Still haven't been paid yet. Will see just how much my boss gives me on tuesday. My dad said something about forcing him into bankrupcy if he can't afford to pay wages., and the old mans usually pretty smarts when it comes to money. Could always threaten my asshat boss with it. I really resent working when i know hes gonna continue to fuck us about, but the works just piling up and up.  Looks like its time to go begging for a new job again.  Got bob to check that other battery for me too, it's a goner. I could rant about Airsoft Dynamics, but frankly, I think from previous posts my view on them is well documented.  Off to bed i go ........

      New Gun So was it worth the cash and the wait ? I'll come back to that later. The gun is awesome, it's got everything i was looking for in an AEG. Lots of upgraded systema internals, sliding stock, nice big G3 Hi-caps, and most importantly looks cool. but ........ Having spent so much cash on it and waited on it for so long it'd never be able to live up to my expectations. All the shit with AD and it's courier has put a fair dent in the joy i can get from this. Appart from that the gun itself has a couple of niggles. It's not all new parts. The SD foregrip has definatly seen use somewhere. The rubber on the foregrip was dirty and the sling hook has looks of scratches as if having been used. The metal on the trigger and fire selector are tarnished, that might be down to cheap monkey metal though. All TM guns come with loading rod &amp; low cap, and cleaning rod. Not this however, came with a hi-cap. Considering it took two guns to make this one, what'd be the trouble in including all the usual gubbins. Oh and it looks like one of the batteries I ordered is dead, will have to get a second opinion from someone (bob).  New Place So my mate Stoo is a huge comic fan, and my Mate dave is a huge illustration fan. It was Stoos birthday on friday so as a gift dave introduced Stoo to Ivor. Ivor runs a comic mail order company called "red hot comics", ran out of two large business park warehouses. So we all went down and had a look around. There must be literally a million comics in the place, and so much cool stuff you wouldn't believe it. It's the mail order equivilent (or better than) of A1 comics. For anyone interested you can check it out here ( urlLink http://www.redhotcomics.demon.co.uk ), site's not much to look at, but you should really check the place out yourself, a wonder to behold.  New books So from Ivors place I got some new graphic novels. Was well chuffed at getting the megatokyo volume one, in the original Studio Ironcat print too. If you don't know megatokyo check it out here ( urlLink http://www.megatokyo.com ), it's more than just a webcomic, it's got a plot too. Other buys included "30 days of night", a cool comic about an Alaskan town that gets no sunlight for one month a year , and a cool one about a teenage runaway that can slow down time.  Today was a good day.  Appologies to steve BTW, I hate being a no-show when i've said I would.

      Wow  After "aquiring" a copy of Doom 3 i can tell you, i WILL be buying this game.  While it recommends that my PC run it at 640x480 on medium settings (with surround sound) it still looks good. Without Anti-Alaising jaggies do show up a bit, especially if you get close to something with the torch, but beauty isn't skin deep. In the case of doom it's more skin rotting and flapping off a persons face.  Doom 3 has got it exactly where it counts. It scares the shit out of me. I jump at every nosie, peek round every corner, and have a friggin heart attack every time the wind blows the damn blinds behind me.  The controls are great. It's good to get back to game that doesn't need ten fingers on each hand, something that most modern games should take notice off (I'm looking at you Joint Operations).  I'm telling you, close the blinds, turn off the lights, turn up the sound, and keep fresh underwear close to hand.

       urlLink http://forums.ukairsoft.net/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=50579   So back in April of this year I decided to buy my new airsoft gun. It's a very nice G3 SBS, which is basically a g3 body with sliding stock and MP5 SD front end. The gun is all upgraded and spanking nice.  Tried emailing the order on the 20th but AD (that's Airsoft Dynamics) were having email problems and they never got the mail. I gave in and called them on the 23rd (it's funny how guys don't like using phones). I ordered the gun itself, two 9.6 volt small batteries, and an adapter so i can charge the batteries with my current charger. On the phone i was told there would be a 25% deposit (£80 quid, the invoice for which arrived shortly afterward) and would take 30 days.  At this point i should send you here  urlLink http://www.airsoftdynamics.net/shop/ADSstore.cgi?user_actio...........  Note how it quotes "up to 90 days". "Maybe they're on the ball or had a cancellation" I thought. God my cheerful optimisim is a handicap.  24th May (around the 30 day mark) I call the shop after having had no reponse on the forum and they tell me they'll call me back. Never happens. I chase them and I'm told "Assured they'll have it in June".  19th June Still no word from airsoft dynamics I enquire if i'll have the gun for a game on the 4th July. I'm told it's fnished and just has to be sent. "I will try my best to get it to you for the 4th". At this point I raise the issue of paying the balance on my Visa (and not the switch that i paid the deposit with).  5th July "Been away for a week. I'll chase it up"  7th July I ask "for the 11th ?"  12th July No reply, I get sarcastic. They say they'll get the gun tommorrow, to me by late next week or the week after.  22nd July 90 days  28th July "I'm playing 1st August, can I have it by then ?" "Yes, we should be able to get it to you before this weekend"  30th July I call them and get told "It came in yesterday, working on it today, will send it out monday for a tuesday delivery" Bummer, no gun for 1st Aug game. I add stoos battery to this order, bear in mind stoos birthday is friday 6th Aug.  4th August Still no gun, they will "check it out for me"  5th August Still no gun. Notice that the balance for the gun has been removed from my bank account leaving me overdrawn and skint just as all my bills (morgage, insurance etc) are due to come off. Get clare to yell at them lots (chicks are great at yelling). They eventually refund my switch and take my visa details. Tell clare that the gun will be with us today. Get home from work, no gun and no delivery card. I cry a little.  6th August Phone up Paul at AD again. He chases the courier who claims to have "carded" us yesterday. Unless he's delivering betterware catalogues then he's a fucking liar. I phone the courier and get told the same thing who also adds "the driver says he delivers to you all the time and this always happens". Um the only other delivery I ever had from these guys (NCN) was my LAST gun from AD which the daft cunts managed to loose. "What am I meant to do" I yell. "Well what do want us to do ?" he asks, "We can redeliver Monday". Great idea, redeliver WHEN I'M AT WORK ! "We can redirect it to your work" "I work in Strathaven" "We don't deliever there" So I'm gonna have to get the details and get down to the depot in Hilington for "nine or half nine" on a fucking Saturday morning to pick up a parcel.   I swear to god i'm getting an ulcer.

      I've moved my blog entries over to blogger.com. Turns out the fancy flash/XML one i wrote wasn't showing up in Mozilla. Beside blogger offers some better stuff anyway.  I'm gonna include some old posts just for consistency and back date them, so while this is the first, it won't be the earliest.
