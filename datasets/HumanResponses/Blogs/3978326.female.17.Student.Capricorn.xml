      Everyday is a good day indeed. Yet, in my case at least, everyday is just like the day before, with the same routine. However, after almost drowning myself with self-pity on that fine Thursday as I was stuck in the house without anyone with my intellectual capacity to talk to, the phone rang. I dashed, with anticipation, hoping someone would save me by adding some spice to that fateful Thursday. Sure enough, I heard a familiar sound from the other side of connection. My saviour happened to be my old schoolmate back in secondary school. She goes by the name “Kamala”. Little wonder to why I found such joy for finally being able to fill up my Thursday evening with such a company for she is known as “ALAMAK” (Kamala becomes Alamak if it is read out the other way round!).  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Alamak” is probably the best word to describe how I felt just under 5 minutes of conversing with her. First, I forgot that her birthday had just passed. After receiving a nice sounding for it, we resumed our conversation in which she gave me another blow. She told me that the coming weekend, she was going for a ‘medical camp’ where she would be a volunteer. After hearing the ring word ‘medical’ I gave her volleys of questions. I had always wanted to be a doctor since I was a kid that spent most of her television time watching the TV-series “ER” or emergency room. Of course it is hardly a reason enough for me to commit me life to the profession that is associated with sweating blood and slaving for at least a decade before becoming a ‘specialist’. Imagine the look on the faces of the admission officers for university when they hear my reason.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To cut a long and winding conversation short, I agreed to come with her to volunteer my services to the society. I had been looking furiously for the past few months for a concrete reason as to why I want to be a physician. Medicine is a field where there has to be passion for what you are doing. And that is precisely what I am looking for. By searching myself now, I would not be making any wrong turns in life by entering this field blindly only to discover later that medicine is not for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The subsequent days left me in fits of anticipation. Would I like it? Is it going to be under the hot sun? I knew a few things though. This medical camp was organized by the Pusat Satya Sai Malaysia. They are a religious organization that does voluntary services. This medical camp is conducted for the villagers of Kampung Sungai Kayu Ara. The irony here is, this ‘village’ is actually situated in the city itself. Moreover, it is so near KDU. The residents of this village are mainly Indians. That is about the only information Kamala could give me and I was suppose to be contented with that. I did ask her what kind of volunteering we were going to do and she told me that there would be the ‘eye-chart test’, measurement of height and weight and also ‘urine test’. She added that I should not be in such high hopes because as a volunteer, we could be asked to pick up rubbish or control the crowd. Being more of a technical kind of person, I hoped that I would not be doing something I do everyday. I want some experience in the medical field to add colours and dimensions to my personal statement when application for places in university comes along.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That day finally came. On the 3rd July, I woke up in the morning, took my breakfast and with a deep breath left home and hitched a ride with dear Kamala to go to “Charity Medical and Health Camp”. When we got there, it looked more like a political rally camp than a medical camp. There were banners and there was a continuous stream of people walking towards that area. That ‘area’ turned out to be a Tamil school after all. It is sad because its condition was bad, nearly dilapidating under the watchful eyes of the city. I did not even manage to get the schools name. Kamala then spotted a fellow volunteer and asked her where we were suppose to meet-up and finalize matters. We then moved in the direction shown by her, to find ourselves in a room. There we met the other volunteers, which included Saras, Supriya, Dhanya, Michael (a white guy who unfortunately was not good-looking) Raj, Kala, and Pravin. Subsequently we were given identification tags and divided into groups by Dr. Wong. Kamala, Michael, Raj and I was in-change of the ‘eye-chart test’, while Supriya, Kala, Saras and Dhanya were told to measured the height, weight and BMI (ratio of the weight to the height of a person). Then, we were shown in a room where the booths were set up for us to carry out our respective tasks.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This room is where I spent my entire day of this camp. My booth was in the middle, separating Dhanya’s booth and the “blood-sugar level test”. Dr. Wong then gave us instructions on how to conduct the eye test. First, patients would stand behind a line&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (approximately 2 meters from the charts) on the floor marked by tape. We would then close one side of the patients’ eye to test its acuity. The patient would then be asked to name the alphabets In the report papers carried along by the patient, we would write the smallest font size the patient can read based on the chart. The font sizes were from the biggest to the smallest: 60, 36, 24, 18,9,7.5,6,and 4. Eye acuity of 60-9 would be categorized as “red”. Within this group, those with eye acuity of 24 and above would be sent to see the ophthalmologists next door for further medical evaluation while those below 24 to 9 should consider wearing spectacles. On the other hand, font size below 9&nbsp; would be termed “blue” (more like an no-need-to-worry sign). In the report papers, we must write the results by ratio, which was 6 per the font size patients could see (ex. 6/36). According to Dr. Wong, this test would enable us to spot those people who actually never come to realize that they are partially blind. Some of the older patients would also come with cataracts and myopia.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By that time, residents of Kampung Kayu Ara were streaming in steadily, wanting to take this once in a lifetime chance to get their medical check-up. An elderly man, aged 103 came on wheel chairs. This shows that they took this medical camp seriously. My job was to write out the results on the report papers carried by the patient, Michael in controlling the traffic, Raj and Kamala got to play the models on “Wheel of Fortune” by doing the alphabet pointing. Now, it took me a while to get warmed-up to the task of getting it right. However, I managed to memorize the reactions on the patients face when they could not see anymore and jot down the font size without being told by Raj what the results was. I realized that this test was well adapted to suit all kinds of patients. For those who were illiterate, symbols was used. The patients would use a card to turn in order to show us the shape pointed on the chart (the letter E laid in different angles).   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The height and weight measurements were carried out in this manner. Patients would come in to have their weight and height measured. The numbers was than recorded in the report papers. Once this was completed, a scale was used to see if their weight was proportional to their height. This scale made the work easier as in actual fact the BMI can be counted by this formula: weight per unit square height (weight in kilograms and height in metre). If this scale showed a number larger than 24, the patient would than be considered to be overweight and obese if the number was larger than 27.   As time passed, call me naïve, but I was certainly shocked when many requested for the symbol card. It was a hard blow because most of them were middle-aged women. This clearly shows that there is still the prevalent attitude among the Indians that women are useless if not for being a good wife, a loving mother, and a productive baby-making machine. Then again, I must not forget to say that some men could not read too, noticeably among the elderly ones. The kids were joyous bunch to work with. Some were so shy to even tell us what they see. They keep glancing at their mothers. On the other hand, some found it as an opportunity to showcase their intelligence. They practically shouted the alphabets to us and we appreciable gave them the “bagus” hand-sign.&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the more medical side of my evaluation, I noticed that these villagers had a serious eyesight problem. Many were given the “red” label. There was a case where this teenage girl, who was wearing glasses, recorded a result of 6/36 on both eyes. This shows how badly in need these people are. Her parents probably could not help her because of their financial constrains. I can safely say that 90% of them needed spectacles to see clearly. Far more saddening was fact that this group included a large number of school-going kids. I also learned that those who were considered overweight or obese had a high chance of having bad eyesight. Of course this would be then a clear indication the patient suffers from diabetes. When we were conducting the eye-test, we were told by Dr. Wong to refer those who were above 40 years of age to the ‘blood-sugar level test’ booth. We were also to keep our eyes open to those who were overweight to refer them to this booth. Patients who did not belong to either of this group would then be cleared for the subsequent check-up, which was physical check as I was told.&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moving on, I cannot avoid saying that I suffered the most violent slap on the face that day, metaphorically that is. Although I am an Indian, I do not know to converse in my mother tongue, but I do understand it. Every time I try, I sound very odd. That is precisely how I sounded that day. I had to direct the patients to the next destination once the eye-check up was completed. As most of them were Indians, they all expected me to converse with them in Tamil. I suffered needless to say. The worst was yet to unfold until I had to explain to an elderly illiterate lady how the symbol card mechanism worked in the most retarded Tamil sentences ever spoken. I managed to pull off some words and I am proud to say that by the end of the day, the most frequent sentence structure I had to use was mastered quite well. Prior to this, I have never been ashamed of my disability but now, I sincerely regret that I never bothered to master this intricate language that requires such complex and multidimensional tongue movement.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, after all the hard work, the volunteers were allowed to go for our first break on a rotational basis after nearly 6 hours of non-stop work since 8.30 a.m. There was specially prepared food waiting for us. The food was vegetarian, since The Satya Sai is in fact a religious movement. I heard the food of excellent. I decided to skip it by downing some sponge cake to take a look around at the other booths available in the camp. I spotted a dentist room, pharmacy, and a common area. I also heard that they were conducting pap-smear test and breast examination for the ladies. How wonderful I thought to myself as I walked back to me room. It was then that I decided to infiltrate into the “blood-sugar level test”.&nbsp; As I said, I wanted some technical experience and I was sure going to go and look for it. As the volunteers manning the booth had left, I decided to help out.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First thing first, I was brief by a fellow volunteer how to conduct the test. The steps are : 1) dab some ethanol on the tip of the patients finger with clumps of wool &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) insert the lancet in rectangular shaped injector &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3) place the tip of the open injector on the tip of the patients’ finger &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4) press the button which would release the lancet for penetration of epidermis &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; layer of the patients’ finger &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5) once pricked, finger then pressed to facilitate blood flow to produce a larger  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drop &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6) blood glucose test strip inserted in glucometer &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7) drop of blood dripped on the strip  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8) wait for the reading on the glucometer &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9) offer the patient some wool to cover the prick Of course there were a few precautions that had to be taken to ensure the safety and the validity of the results. I must remember to change the lancet in the injector and the blood test strip each time. I find that the injector helps a lot especially for those with injection related phobia. They would be spared the trauma, as the insertion of the lancet on their finger cannot be seen. This test would yield a better result if the patient had fasted before the test was conducted. Only then would the sugar level in the bloodnot fluctuate as when it does right after a meal. For a person who had fasted, the normal sugar level in the blood ranges from 3.0-6.0, measured in mmol/l (milli moles per liter). In lay mans’ term, this would mean the concentration of sugar in the blood.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what did I discover? Many things actually. Although it took me some time to get used to the idea of pricking people, but I was thoroughly enjoying it. It was quite hard to get a nice drop of blood from some patients as they either had to little or watery blood. Some of the men had such rough skin, I had to injected a few times to get a puncture. I presumed that these men were labourers. If once was not enough, I had to face another slap. I could not explain to the patients their results other than delivering the reading on the glucometer to them. I had difficulty applying my classroom knowledge in the real world. I had to keep on referring them to a rather nice lady volunteer who assured or chided them gently, depending on the results on the meter.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All good things have to come to an end. And so, my day as a medical camp volunteer ended with me being a more knowledgeable person. I went home at around 3.00 p.m. By that time, the common area was almost empty. I could safely say that at least a thousand people turned up that day and this camp was certainly a success. It proved that although impoverished, these people had a clear understanding on the importance of being healthy. They took up the opportunity to evaluate their health level. At least now I know efforts like this actually help those in need.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most importantly, this experience gave me a clearer picture of myself. At least I know now that I do in fact enjoy helping people. That is a step closer to being a passionate medical practitioner. Furthermore, I realized how foolishly disillusioned I was in assuming that it was a disgrace to speak my own mother tongue. Nothing beats the joy of knowing more about your very own roots and culture. I had blindly dismissed any attempts to cultivate a clear understanding in the Tamil language. Now, I have to pay the price.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the brighter side, I had a chance to meet and see things and sceneries previously hiding in the blind spot of my eyes. As a human being, I just got too comfortable with my surroundings that I never thought of displacing myself. Now that I did, I am proud to say I have exposed myself to the reality of the world.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, wouldn’t you agree that that was a great day spent? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      &nbsp; I received my present with open arms. I was drenched with happiness. My mom’s absence left me wondering aimlessly. Like a dear little puppy in a dark, dirty, wet back lane of a city centre. It could go forward or just back track into nothingness. Both the ends looked exactly the same. I was like that. Of course there was papa. Dearest papa who made me feel like I am the real princess behind every other wondrous but amazingly dreamy characters in fairy tales. He tried to replace mom when she left for a few months to pursue her studies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  She came home a new person. Much slimmer, radiant, prettier and she didn’t have the irritated look every mother has after a long days work. They come home, all tired, drained of all their precious energy, wasting their true potential on some menial job they are demanded of. Just for a few dollars for the family of course. I could see papa at the corner of my eyes. He had a very stupid grin on his face. Was he surprised to see his wife all new, groomed, and splendid after a leave of absence? Maybe he felt happy for his dearest princess, who finally saw her mother again.  A hug. A warm envelope of arms stamped with love and felicity wrapped itself around my frail body. I love mommy and mommy loves me. Simple and yet the term itself is able to crumble an iron wall and what not, a country. That was all I thought about that very moment. It’s been sometime since I felt her body against mine. Her scent reminded me of newborn babies. Strangely, during this bear hug, images from the television formed in my head. Like long forgotten memory, I recollected one episode in National Geographic when a mother panda grabbed a branch of bamboo, a young one at that and gave it to her cub who sat smugly between it’s mother’s out stretched legs.   Reality hit back when someone threw a question at me. It was my mother, I later found out. She kept talking or rather I would call it jabbering and searching earnestly for something in a bundle of bags. Frantically, her eyebrows arched, her nose wrinkled, lines formed on her fair, smooth forehead, grim lines stretched and contracted around the periphery of her lips. Suddenly, I saw a smile broke put. I watched it stretch, literally from ear to ear. Wow, I never thought it was possible. Maybe I was dreaming again like the mother panda episode that vividly passed through my mind.   Then, I saw it, a green box. It must be something special. After such a long time she must have gotten me something that I would really adore. Where could her common sense be if she didn’t get what her daughter wants. I don’t recall telling her what I wanted specifically. I could do with an assorted, branded, high in quality colour pencils from States or maybe some article of clothing that could only be found in the northern hemisphere. I got to show it to my friends just like how that vixen of a neighbour I had. Her mom got her some sort of collectors edition on Barbie in a prom gown. God, she couldn’t help herself. Drooling right in front of teacher, telling everyone how much she loves it. Can you imagine?? This girl went nuts about dolls!  Anyway, it was a green box, covered on the sides and also the base but the top was transparent. The thing could be seen then, without me having to rip of some fancy wrapping paper. I cursed myself for being half the height of my mother and why was she holding it above my head. Just hand it down to me mother, it’s very simple, slowly now, hand it down, down to me. Would she stop bragging, a hodgepodge of news can be told later. Papa can wait. Give me the present mommy. Should I jump for it? Wouldn’t dearest elder brother find me a trifle too desperate and give me that popular smirk of his?  Finally, she bended over, pecked me on my cheek for the hundredth time and handed me the box. The floor underneath my feet rumbled, it moved discreetly at first, gaining momentum and speed by the second. Ferociously the ground began cracking up. My whole house quivered, cringed like a scared little child. The rumble under my feet spread like the attack of a thousand crickets in a cornfield. Fast, greedy, unyielding and horribly deadly. I saw my brother, he was shouting, screaming, pleading for his life. He asked me to save him. I sneered. I chuckled for now I had my redemption. He was the first and foremost person that made life dreadful, scary and totally unattractive. Who but him should be suffering now? A thunderous laugh burst out of my lungs.   Steam rose, clouding the sky in hot, muggy, wet vapours. The smell, pungent and miasma tic. Anyone has a facemask? I looked down, in my attempt to search for the source for all this special effects. I noticed the red, languid, lurid colour. So that what teacher meant when she talked about the corona of the earth. Semi-liquid. Hotter than any human being could ever live to feel. Lava sprang forth upwards like hot geysers. Waves soon developed, pouring, washing everything on sight. A great earthquake must have happened underneath, I said to myself. A tsunami of ponderous magnitude took place or is&nbsp; taking place in there. Wow! Why go through all the trouble to epitomise my anger. All done in my honour….  A watch? A WATCH? Why mom, don’t you remember, only on my previous birthday you gave me the most beautiful watch I have ever seen. Why go all the way, across the ocean, leaping over all those countries to get me, your only daughter, to get a watch? I was in for an even better surprise. Before I could say a word on what I thought about her gift, she commanded me, in her sweet, melodious voice…. “Common now, run along, give it to your brother,”  I am betrayed beyond belief. How could she do this to me? Why doesn’t she have compassion, or even pity for me? Had I not come from the very same womb as him?&nbsp; Am I not a being that grew from seeds contributed by both you and papa? Why treat me differently? Why go through all they trouble buying that rascal of a son ten gift? That’s right, ten, I counted meticulously.  You, who taught me not to look at differences between men. You, who made me, see the world in a pair of unbiased eyes. You made me treat my friends equally. You told me to divide those delicious cakes you made for my friends proportionately. You denied me the right to invite my best friend for my birthday party because I said I only wanted to spend it with her and none other. You are the one who told me justice was blind. She could ‘see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil’. She gave out verdicts, punishments to those bad people without any leniency. Not looking at looking at skin, creed, beliefs and even a person’s preference for colours, ice-cream flavour, fruit and game.   What’s the point of teaching me to be a monk that does nothing but pray and seek purification of thoughts, body and soul to reach Nirvana when you are allowed to commit those blasphemous conducts? Mommy, I’m ashamed of you. Why do you have to break my heart? Oh no, not you mother.   I walked smugly to my brother, shoved the present to him. I didn’t say a word. I didn’t dare look at his face that would have imprinted that sneer that would make my cry. I don’t want to be called a crybaby by him again. Mom and dad never noticed anything. They couldn’t read what was on my mind. They were chattering happily, telling each other what they missed out on. Catching up with time. Rekindling the fire of their marriage. Lovemaking politely, obediently, they wouldn’t want to make a scene in front of brother and I.   Dinner was horrid. I had to wear a clown’s face throughout dinner as to not offend the heart of my family members. Had anyone thought about mine? I had to eat granny’s cooking today. Which was a blessing. It got things out of my mind. It consoled me. I loved her cooking. Rice, fish and vegetables. Unlike many kids, I loved vegetables. I can eat raw carrots, celery, salads, cabbage, asparagus, tomatoes and the list goes on. The fish was cooked expertly that I had a hard time trying to figure out whether it was fried and shimmered in curry or simply just sprinkled with curry spices. There could be a thousand different opinions.  Before I knew it, it was bedtime. I climbed the stairs like a worn out peasant. I never knew that climbing up 24 steps was such an arduous task. My energy just evaporated, that was the only explanation I could come up with. Life was meaningless to me, again. I hate it when only my life turns topsy-turvy and my brother has got plenty of luck to go smooth sailing through out his damned life. Step upon step, I literally carried my legs up. It reminded me of my evening chore with papa when I had to carry pots around to suit his taste. The man couldn’t make up his mind.  “Put it here, no wait. Perhaps, it’s better if it stays put”. “Hey, don’t run away, I think you should help me to put it somewhere around here. Mom would like it here…….” I have to add, his taste his horrible. No sense of direction or space. He was creating a complicated maze out of our lawn. The gardener did a better job. God, his life must be boring.  I made it to my room. My head pounded. My eyes moistened. My breath was constricted. I couldn’t breath anymore. My ribs were tightening its grips, making breathing a troublesome and impossible task. Air couldn’t be supplemented for my cells. I was choking, crying, sobbing. Why did a person I love so much betray and crush my tender heart? I felt like running to my bed, covering myself with the blanket. Enclosing myself in the warm, comforting shelter just like a cocoon to a butterfly. I don’t want that pest of a brother to see me like this. That would be the downfall of the century.   My room was dark. I have got to use my remaining energy to switch on the lights and fan. It was painful. I felt my life draining out of my body as I stretched my hands to turn the light on. I realised how granny must be suffering. Her skin that no longer has the power of elasticity and bones that are robbed of calcium giving her osteoporosis. How could she have the energy she has, helping papa take care of brother and I? I felt my pity for her overwhelming me. But she need no longer be alone. I’m a demented child with a throat that is parched dry and direly needs replenishment from the Fountain of Love and Care.   There, the lights are on, I get to crawl into bed now. My God! Bless the Virgin Mary. Am I dreaming? Is this my room? Is that my bed? I can’t believe this. I shall pinch myself for assurance. Are my feet on the floor? I got to thank mommy…

      Of Spiderman and Nighties  Approximately 2 weeks ago, on Friday, my nose couldn't stop running. Not walking away literally, but simply leaking, and uncontrobaly at that! My sinus was at its peak, I had finished my daily ration of tissue paper,my nose was red (thanks to the constant rub and friction between numerous tissue papers and the epidermis, my head throbbed, and my shoulders were aching. I could sense a huge headache forming, from my temples and slowly but painfully slithering towards my forehead. It didn't help that I had to endure 2 hours of biology practical with a very very strict lecturer ( sssshhhhh!! ) and self-obligatory/self-induced study in the library for another 3 hours before going to my little space of the off the ground (my condominium unit).  OKAY! I was about to be sick and I needed a break. "I want to go and see Spiderman", I exclamed loudly. "I heard that", answered my bio lecturer.  After that, I minimised my sighing, and decided to brave through all those hours, there's no other way out.Once I got home, nearly 15 minutes later, the phone rang!!  My initial thought was that my mother was on the other side of the line, just wanting to give me some instructions on some menial task. "ALAMAK", it's Kamala, my very very plutonic friend was the one in actual fact.  Our conversion : brief. Why? I was to go with her for Spiderman! YEAH! I was sick, and I didn't care for I wanted to spend sometime with her. National Service on her part, college on my part and then Form 6 on her part, seperated us all this while.  By 8.15p.m, we were already at a nearby shopping mall, standing in line,hoping we could get a proper seat in the cinema. Unfortunately, Friday was the day everybody wanted to catch a nerd in a blue-red tight suit. We settled for a fourth row from the screen seat which only aggravated my slowly worsening back pain. While the advertisement ran, we kept each other up-to-date with all the 'world news'.  The movie : horrenduous. And we both agreed on that (FINALLY)! The tension-of-opposites in the movie was strained far too much to be entertaining. We complained about everything about Ms. Dunst and mesmerized by our mutual thought of how manly Spiderman's friend looked instead of Spiderman himself.  As the movie reached its conclusion, we were bought laughing like hyenas on how stupidly Dunst, wearing a very pretty wedding dress, runs with bright sunlight on the back and white dove flying around, to Maguire's dilapidated appartment, after ditching the alter.  So, much for a stupid movie, we left the cinema at around 11.00p.m to get to the entrace were our pick-up was. It was then we passed the famous lingerie shop-BLUSH. Just giving a pasing glance, I spotted an innocent white, cotton nightie, and exclaimed loudly,  "Hey, wait, look, it's so nice" Suprising, she giggled, far more notoriously than could be imagined to come out of her. "Yah, IF Huge Jackman peels it of you..."  I burst out laughing. I knew she wasn't the Kamala I knew back in school. A few months ago, things like that would only come out of me, not her. I guess NS changed her...too much. She learned how to climb up fences to run to the mall although her camp was situated in Sabah, near the fringes of the jungle. She even accounted to me how she and her fellow mates hid under the bed when the trainers came knocking on the door in the morning just to skip the days events. The dust underneath didn't matter at that instant.  Change she underwent certainly made my day, I was pleased that, finally I got a friend with the same level of filth in the head!  p.s- my sinus proved to be quite a formidable enemy. It made me sick for the weekend, rendering any attempts on my part to prepare for the term test hopeless!!

      The Case of the "MAU SHI SHI"   Yesterday, as I was just ruminating to myself how ordinary things were, things took a sharp turn, 360 degrees you might say.   It was a daily routine, (more like alternate days, with current circumstances) to utilise fully the gym at my new condominium(yah right, mostly, I would be lucky if i were to get I drop of sweat on my pimpled forehead!). Besides I was getting pretty touchy about how people saw my habit of successfully eating at every class in college, regardless of subject and lecturer.  "Selamba je", as my friend put it.  Added to that my lecture had improvised the quoth "I think, therefore I am, to "I EAT, therefore I am"(referring to me,of course) THAT'S IT, I'm dragging&nbsp; myself to the gym!   Back to the story,  I was working on this huge equipment (no idea what it's called), then came a boy, approximately 3 years old, wearing his red and yellow pre-school uniform. What was remarkably was his head.&nbsp; Yes, his head! Like a round football, almost flattened face, with cute humps and bumps where the nose and cheeks was and hollow at the eyes. He had almost bald haircut and he had the look of a shy child in front of an adult. And his transport? The cutest little tricyle while a little pink-white basket.   This little boy tickled my heart, I continously stared at him although I was working on a rather dangerous piece of equipment. I wanted him to at least respond to my friendly gesture. I smiled, but like with any child in front of a stranger, he just continued staring blankly at me, like I was a monster from out of space... Just when I was losing interest, he shrill cry came out of the tiny orifice on this flattened face..  "KAKAK, KAKAK!! ".  I thought he was calling me, so I looked and expected more to come out from the mouth which was lined with such tiny, healthy, red lips.  NOTHING.  Then this guy ran out. After a few moments I heard the same voice resonating the same words. Surely, he was calling someone else. So, I continued with whatever I was doing.   This boy then came again, and he looked forlornly at me, "KAKAK! KAKAK!", ke kept saying.  Quite unexpectedly, he grabbed his pants. Where? Where his genitals were suppose to be. I stood, shocked, then forgave him, almost instantly,for his age.  "KAKAK, kakak, mau mua, mua",  WHAT? Okay, first the grabbing, now the mumbling, GOSH!   "KAKAK!! MAU SHI SHI!"...   hahahahhahhahaha, so much for all the hype, after a few moments, the mysterious 'kakak' turned up. She held his hand and took him back door, that's where the toilets were, I think.   I walked back to my little piece of place on the third floor, very much enthusiastic, after meeting such a cutie, in the form of the perfectly white, moon face.   So much for orndinary! &nbsp;

      At 2015, Malaysian time on Tuesday, the silly ring tone of my handphone persistantly demanded my attention. I had to put on hold a bunch of sentences for my biology lab report just to grab that idiotic piece of equipment which was on my dressing table. Dragging my sticky body after my jog around the nearby park, I reluctantly pressed the button with a green coloured receiver on it. Just before I did, I recieved an impulse from my brain..    Brain : You are avoiding the number that ends with 28..    When I took a peek at the blue screen of my bloody NOKIA I saw 82 at the end of the number.    Brain : You scape-grace of a fool BoNdI, was it 28 or 82 you were avoiding?..      Unable to decide, with the failure of my brain memory system, I reluctantly pressed a button with an emblem of green receiver tarnishing its silvery hue.  Unknown : Hello?..................Hello?   Brain : Think, think, THINK! Is that the voice you are avoiding?    Me : I don't know, it's kind of deep, that voice I heard...... wasn't deep. It had the pitch of a    woman's...   Brain : Don't say anything. Just be silent.   Me : WHAT! Leave the voice to entertain itself....okay....I really can't decide..   I then pressed the complimentary button with a red reciever emblem.  Almost immediately, the phone rang again..   Me : I'm going to pick this up. And if it's that the salesman that sent me a very weird message,   I shall just say wrong number...    Brain : WAIT you mutt!    Unknown : Hello Me : Hello? Unknown : Is this BoNdi? Me : Yes... Unknown : I'm your doctor.   Brain : MAYDAY-MAYDAY! ALERT! ABORT PHONE CALL! ABORT!   Me : Huh? Huh? euh...euh....I think you got the wrong number....   Brain : ABORT! You want to talk to a maniac selling, god knows what? ABORT!   Unknown : No, this is BoNdI, right? Me : Yes , (oh gosh, what am I DOING?)  Unknown : I'm your family doc. I'm returning your call on the rabies you contracted?   Brain :   See. SEE! GO ON TALKING SOMEMORE! SEE WHAT YOU DID. THAT DUMB      MANIAC IS SAYING YOU HAVE RABIES NOW. AND GUESS WHAT, YOU JUST     WROTE AN INCRIMINATING ARTICLE ABOUT A DOG! HE'S STALKING YOU!   Me : HUH? Unknown : Remember a dog bit you..   Brain : BoNdI, BoNdI! It's  urlLink YingKs!  YingKs!   Me : YingKs! YINkS! What the hell, you scared me like shit! CRAP YOU! OH MAN!! YingKs! : hahahahahahhah  Emotionally tested, I was really tired after conversing with YingKs!. He gave me a pointer when avoiding someone. Instead of relying on your brain,    Brain : Hey, what the heck! I'm the one that helped you ace....      save the number and name it as DANGER. Don't delete it and apply some memorize the last two digits technique.

      Welcome to the 2nd edition of the supposedly sad account of my examination experience. Today, however, I'm going to turn the tables and burst the dam that holds all the water simply because I'm HAPPY! I woke up refreshed at 5 a.m in the morning. Yes, I wanted to snuggle in bed again but I had promised myself to get over Robert Ludlums' 'The Bourne Identity'. Upon completion, I'm convinced Ludlum is a maniac. No,no,no, I did enjoy the book, but it was so intrinsic. Back to my point, I'm currently munching on my second breakfast, my first was 3 hours ago and am damaging my ears with 'Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go' by WHAM. How can I not be filled with felicity?  By the way....  Fourth Day :  Biology was written on the schedule that I looked at forlornly after my Chemistry test. I read all my notes approximately 2 weeks ago. By now, nothing was on the surface of my head, where I need it to be to facilitate fishing facts out during the test. I had about 5 hours more of Tuesday for revising before the birth of Wednesday. After studying for 2 hours, I proposed a 15 minutes nap, which of course lasted for 5 hours. I woke up at 5 a.m on Wedenesday, with 1 more hour before I must hit the showers and I had 4 more chapters to look at. SCREWED! Short and sweet, but true,SCREWED!   When I got to college, I was more interested in Maroon Five's 'She Will Be Loved' than the process of Mitosis and DNA replication. Logically, watching a man practise himself on 2 girls was far more exciting then Transport in Plants. In the back of my head, The Cardiac Cycle was bidding with the others for attention. I therefore had dug a grave deeper than 6 feet....  5 minutes prior to the start, my Biology lecturer walked out of the staff room cradling the precious papers lovingly. She looked at me, smiled, and said terrifying words.  "I still remember what you told me BoNdI....so I prepared a special paper for you..."  OH SHIT.....   "I got the Room 401 and sat down, making sure the aura was right. That was all I could rely on at that moment. It was then my lecturer had to interpose.  "BoNdI, you must sit here", pointing to a table in directly in front of mine. "No, I refuse to move", already at the brink of tears. "But, this paper here is specially for you". "I don't want it, Ms.*a*a..."  With feline precision, she toke the paper on that empty table and switched it with mine.  "NOOOOO, Ms. *a*a, your are disturbing the aura. I'm dead, I'm dead and buried..."  The whole class erupted in laughter.  "BoNdI, you're going to be a doctor. Don't be silly. Well, it's your foult. What did you tell me the other day? You would put me in your very VERY long waiting list for treatment, right?"  After 2 hours, it was done. DONE! It wasn't so bad. Thank god! With the absence of our dear biological pump, I think I managed to kick the sand of my feet....   Fourth Day :  Schedule : Thinking Skills  Plan of Kill : Do some questions from specimen questions. And read some story book to kill the time.  Outcome : 1 of the question in the paper came from the specimen questions. The rest was about pre-heating the oven to roast a chicken.   Fifth Day :  Read 200 pages of Ludlums' 'The Bourne Identity', wrote 'Of Rabies and Wagging Tails' and anticipated the holidays...  Well, still am happy, listening to 'Dancing in September' by Earth Wind and Fire. Currently, 'Sweet Home Alabama' is blaring with my brother doing the guitar mimic of Lynerd Skynerd.

      Much to YingKs! disappointment, I have decided to for-go my initial plan of continuing my ramblings with 'Lowly Situations 2', but instead write on my earliest memories....  Have you earhtlings out there wondered why we can only remember things that don't strecth far back from the day we were born but instead only start at maybe 3 to 4 years of age. Surely, a memory as horrenduous as coming out from dear mommy's womb is not something very attractive. However, why is it that our brains are rewired intentially?  I was reduced to conversing with myself the other day, thanks to boredom, my very,very close companion.I started thinking about what I could remember from my days as a very little child. Somehow, I could only make out three, vaguely that is. I simply concluded these golden three were my earliest because I couldn't precisely make out my age from them and because they were as brief as a bolt of lightning. I have chosen to speak of only one though.  I woke up on a misty morning still shy of the sun. The windows were still dark in my grandmother's house and I was blinking repeatedly to get the blotchy feeling out of my eyes. I rubbed my them rather vigorously and heard the birds early morning chatter on the world news. My grandmother's powder room had the lights on, a clear indication that she was up and about. I reluctantly flipped my blanket and was welcomed by the cold breeze of the fan. Standing up, I dizzily walked to the kitchen knowing without a thought that she would be there.  I saw her, standing near the sink. She was peeling something or another and I went closer with the intention to help. Odd = somehow as a child we accept our roles outlined by the respective gender more readily than when we are adults. She handed me the white miniature pumpkin with a severe case of dry skin but refused to give me the small knife. She then briefly disappeared.   I heard the screeching of a chair being lifted up far off and then put down again very close to me. With one mighthy movement, I was carried and I soon found myself on a raised platform. Previously, without the chair, I could only reach the sink if I was standing on my toes.  Within a few minutes, I was dismissed. My little fingers couldn't compensate for the speed she wanted to work with..  That's all...unfortunately. I wish I could remember more on the time when I was a little child under the watchful eye of my grandmother. Those days when life was so simple should have lasted longer and cherished.   Having accounted mine, what's yours?

      Well, throughout the history of my dearest blog, I have so far restrained myslef from any mention of deeply personal matters. Today, I am about to break that long held traditon, I'm going to spill it out, everything...  I am fresh out of my first examination in college. I don't know why but the whole idea of being in college is all..well...bed and roses...birds and the bees. Only four months and we had to sit for the term test. So I guess reality ain't in synchrony with our presumptions.  The exams only lasted a week and I can tell you, it was a LONG week. I was basically prepared, I believe even the librarian(who actually memorised my student identification number) can attest to this fact. (I had made the library my second home).Nevertheless, life is filled with many suprises and pot holes full of shit that will claim your perfumed feet once in a while.  The First Day:  The schedule included two papers, both of which required the left side of the brain to work with. Pure Mathematics and one of its progeny, Mechanics. I remember sitting down getting myself comfortable and slowly assimilatiing myself with the atmoshpere of the dark Auditorium. I said my prayers, cluthing my holy chain thightly, hoping with the damnest that I will remember solving methods and use the right one to unravel the questions. When the invigilators said "Begin", I took a deep breath, and the battle of Students against all that Evil represents begun...........  The Second Day :  It was to be the most horrible day of all, if only I took my feelings as a forewarning seriously. The schedule was like....SHIT. Forgive my outburst, but I am not lying. I had Physics, followed by Chemistry. And the gap between the two? 15 minutes. I was in a quagmire, of faeces, germs and everything else. I can safely say the worst paper I had was none other than Physics. How do i explain this and claim your sympathy? Relatively easy! The paper was to be done over with by one hour. And the questions, it required two hours. Please refer to Sighting : Episode 2 : Teachers from Hell.  Whatever would be, would be, right Sarah? I walked down the stairs, literally stoned. I vented my anger on two unfortunate souls, and got ready for my Chemistry.  Chemistry, oh dearest, my illicit affair with this branch of science(only a privilaged few knows...). The paper, it was a JOKE! I am not saying it was easy-peasy. I'm saying it was a plain joke. Never in my short life have I sat for such a paper. The question began with a characther, Ah Long, who had a compony, called 'Chem R' Us'. The whole paper gave us an account of his life. It was enjoyable, and you know that you are suppose to laugh, but how do you do it in an examination hall? Not only did the lecturer put us in conflict with our human emotions, he made it a struggle for us as there was no way we could skip a question and 'go-astern', we had to attempt the question as they appeared, simply because it was a story, without using any creative afforts like flaskback. If your curiosity tickles you, the paper ended with the marriage of Ah Long and his long-time girlfriend and they produced some Ah Boon and Ah someother...  I have decided to keep the third and the fourth day for tomorrows' edition..  p.s - it is just too painful...

      Most of us would have the unfortunate but rather necessary experience of a ferocious cur wanting, waiting and anticipating a move from you as an excuse to pounce. These impertinent mutts with unwarranted fury always seem to be on their heels, flushing their anger at the wrong direction. Which ever way you see it, they suffer nothing in turn of their despicable character, unless you count all those irritance emancipating out of the pores of their previous victims.  Well, to those who haven't meet a dog with ultra-sensitive smell reseptors on their smooth, black nostrils, you might be suprised that you can actually find them anywhere. Not only do they guard houses owned by sufferers of OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder, in terms of security in this case), but, thanks to this era of globalization, they can be found even in office premises....  That brings me to the discussion of the day...  Has anyone been to the Centre of Pre-University Studies staff office without getting clearance from the dedicated 'watchman' (in this case, our security guard in question has to be promoted)? Then again, the bigger question is why do students need clearance to meet mentors, their only guide in the seemingly never ending bower of dreary theoretical facts. However unrelevent all these facts are in the real world, students need all these facts to get pass this hurdle. This hurdle of course starts with a mere height of a millimeter to the height where only the   escape speed   can take you....(  the minimum speed required by a space craft to escape the earths' gravitational   field  )  Back to my point, since this 'watchman' is after all human, it is not exempted from partiality. Well...let me put it this way, if you throw a big, fat, juicy bone to a dog, it would most certainly lick you, but if you were to step on its tail, you'll be visiting your local doctor for your rabies vaccine injections........  Thus, students tend to give various accounts of the accountability of the security system in this little secluded office.   "Who? Oh 'watchman'? Well I'm mostly lucky. It's always busy when I walk in. Like the other day it was having a bone wedged between its paws and its ears, muttering non-stop in a highly serious manner. So I simply mouthed the name of my lecturer to it and with the wagging of its tail, allowed me enterence to it's lair..."  "Gosh, don't remind me. Why is it so difficult to let us in? We can't be giving away bones all the time. All I needed to do was to put the book on my lecturers' table. But it went on barking, denying me entrance...."  "Apply Newton's Third Law lah my friend. To every action there is a reaction. I just walk in equiped with a bag of fresh chicken bones for its inspection. I mean, you need to apply the psychology of the 'opposite-sex' to get your way sometimes.......in your case, it can't be applied..."  "It let you in without having a bite of your flesh? That's not fair at all! **ry, **ry, what a contrary!"  "Of course it won't let you in, you didn't pay your fees for the next semester right. Your friend did, that's why it was sniffing her instead of you..."    Examples shown, it would be pointless to go on. Remember, if you venture to the staff room in the fourth floor, you have been forwarned!

       WARNING : THE FOLLOWING EVENTS ARE TRUE.       Sigthings 3 : Teachers from Hell.    Incognitos spotted a commotion outside the Auditorium. Situated at the 1 st floor, it was a place where functions were held. As it was a multi-purpose building, it was currently in use for examinations. Upon further enquiries, it turned out that the students enrolled in the Centre for Pre-University Studies were having their term and also trials for the upcoming Cambridge A-Levels examination. Consequently, or maybe not, high levels of abnormality was recorded in our electromagnetic wave device. We then went closer, for a through examination of the events ongoing while the students sweated out in the dark, unfriendly atmosphere...  "That teacher was born and raised in hell!! "Precisely, how are we suppose to complete a paper with 2 hours worth of question within an hour?" ....."I couldn't finish that #$*%ing paper!" "She purposely did it....remember what she said..."I would give you 2 long questions where you have to balance accounts with no objective questions...how's that? It would be easy! " "Those accounts couldn't be balanced....I'm going to fail it...." "Oh screw it man!"  Not far away, we heard another group of students..  "Sir, there's no time. How can you do this sir?! "Was it hard?" "No, in can be done, but, there was NO TIME!" "Sir,....our grades, 100% from this paper?" "Yah..." "NO, sir....NO!" And with a sly smile, he said, "Just take this as an experience, go back home and try it out again...we will see how...this paper...." and left, with the doors swinging back. "How could he do this, I DIDN'T complete so many questions!"   In another case,  "I'm so tense, how the hell am I suppose to hold this up? I missed an exam because of some time table mix-up. Ms(--) told me that this paper would be now, but when I went there, the place was empty", "Oh, another classic case of teachers from hell..." "NO...SHE WAS BORN AND RAISED IN HELL!" "You should calm down, you got another test in 10 minutes..." "Gosh! I'm so dead man, so DEAD!"     Point  : It is rather interesting how much of pain those 'creatures from hell' can incure to these students. If they were truly from hell, wounldn't they carry and emblem of some kind, like two horns, projecting upwards like the rather over-americanized devil - Hell Boy? Incognitos had many reasons to believe that these 'creatures' had been suited with many disguises....then again....maybe not...      Sighting 4 : Zombies.    Many complained of being dead and only present in a vaguest way possible. Incognitos found this an interesting fact. In many conversations that we overheard, many references were made about death and the cycle of life, in rather interesting ways. For example :   1) I booked the incinerator last week and decided to keep my date with it after physics paper. 2) What are you guys talking about?..huh..amoebic movement...multinucleic? I'm in the    twilight zone right now.... 3) Twinkle, twinkle little star, how I wonder how close you are... 4) I am so dead,I'm twelve feet underneath.. 5) I would be lucky if I could see the day light 6) -I am dead -If you're dead, I'm already eaten and digested by animals -And through amonification, I'm already a nitrate -You can't beat this! I'm denitrified and already in the air as N2 (nitrogen gas)      Point  : The students still managed humour although they claimed to be dead. Are zombies     capable of human emotions while facing physical erosion?

       WARNING : THE FOLLOWING EVENTS ARE TRUE. VIEWERS DISCRETION IS ADVISABLE.       The Sightings visited KDU, a college in Damansara Jaya, after receiving information that KDU has been recording unusually high frequencies of paranormal occurances in its campus. The crew members went incognito as to avoid giving indication that the campus was on close watch. Some of those activities, deemed appropriate for public veiwing, are as follows...    Sigthings 1: THE GRAB  At about 3.30 p.m on a Wednesday evening,(dates will not be mentioned to protect anonymity of subjects), the cafeteria of the campus was dimly lit. The sky was dark, forewarning students and crew members alike of an approaching storm. Students dotted the cafeteria, randomly that is, in small nucleus like groups. Then, a group of students, dressed in aprons, complete with the hair cap and little knives slid up their arm pockets, came and sat on a table very close to counter while some of them chose to stand and munch on their grub. While they were enjoying their meal, one of them, stood up from the chair, and in a swift motion, grabbed the buttocks of his friend! With quick reflects, the guy subjected to such an act quickly turned his body to avoid further contact. He also gave a nervous glance to the Incognitos (since they were only a metre away) to see if such an act was seen. Unknowingly to him, this incident went as far as to be published...  Sightings 2 : THE PLOT TO LOCK  At the dark ground floor of the campus, there are clumps of rooms, strategically placed as to form a nearly perfect hexagon. There are six rooms, and all of them functioning as science laboratories. Incognito crew members turned their attention to one of these labs. On that Tuesday evening, the students in the class were in a jovial mood. Just that moment, they decided to play a trick on their Biology lecturer. Upon further investigation, Incognitos found out that that lecturer was the last one you would play a trick on. Surely, some mythical powers were working on these students. Sly yet very much aware of the consequences, they locked the doors to the lab. Meanwhile, awaiting impending disaster, they continued their noisy chatter. Soon, the 'click,click,click' of the door knob refusing to allow the entrance of a person was heard. Everyone hushed. Outside, cars were passing by casually, the trees were swaying lazyly and the sun was slowly dimming. Apparently, only this shiny, everlasting orb was aware of what was going to occur. A student then briskly ran,unlocked the door, and sat, all in under 2 seconds. The lecturer rushed in, and asked without much ado.  "Which one of you locked the door..?"  Her facial expression was enough to let the cat out of the bag. The students knew that she was a trapped dam about to burst.  ".....(the name)....".  Thankfully, oh, thankfully, she turned her attention to something else...much less devastating...  *****  With that, Sightings would return with more paranormal activities in our next edition...  Remember..."the truth is out there, and the Sigthtings will know...each and every time..."

      I remember this joke every vividly, as if it was brand new.  Fifth Form was quite hellish for me and some of my friends who wanted a guarenteed results of nothing but a unsploit string of gleaming A's. This might seem like an easy enough wish. Just add a table spoon of hard work, a pint of sweat, a drop of blood, a kilogram of sacrifice, a pinch of heart break with many failures in not obtaining A's in trial exams, and well....bits and pieces here and there that comes along the way.  Certainly, the sum of it all (being scalar quantities) proved to be quite an overwhelming amount. The price? Our SANITY!  And prove ?  After physics, we returned to our class room and started chatting.  "Hey, what's Hooke's law again?" "The force applied is proportional to the extension of an elastic body until the elastic limit is reached," "Wei, don't give such ambiguous descriptions to me! What's the elastic limit thing?" "The maximum stress that can be applied on a elastic body after which it will not return to it's original size once the strees is removed....." "HEY, it's easier to remember it this way!" "And, what's your master plan?" "Hooke's Law, it's applicable to virtually any body, where the extension is proportional to the force right?" "Yes, where are you getting at? I recognise that smile Elaine" "Apply it to the penis"...  Needless to say, our minds went into a brief moment where we tried to stimulate the actual case in which this law could be applicable, and it left us in a high and delirious mood for the rest of the day. I even snorted during Additional Maths ( a subject in which the look in the teachers face would tell you, any form of noise was not acceptable ).  Carrying on the tradition of my class, I'm passing this around.  P.S - Just learnt about Deformation of Solids today....don't try this at home!
