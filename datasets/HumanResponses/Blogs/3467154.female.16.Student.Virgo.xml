      I've had a great weekend. Haven't blogged in like ages but am back. Anywayz, I went to enchanted kingdon yesterday with Nina, Julienne, Jona, and Franz along with our moms and dads and it was really fun. (LOL-hit me if that was a run-on sentence). Saturday we went to Divisoria-it was allright, stinky but fun. And that day I heard my favorite song-by Lisa Loeb (Stay-I Missed You)3 times!!! LOL. I'm waiting right now in this really cool bookstore just enjoying life.

      Ok...I saw this movie 'The Day After Tomorrow.'  It was good, kinda freaky though in a sense that if we do destroy our environment, it could affect us in a way that we can't explain in words. In some cases, we may freeze to death. The weather can just kill us.  So the next time you use styrofoam, don't think "Oh, just one. It won't hurt." The truth is, I believe it can and it will. I love our earth, and we must take care of it. I sure wouldn't want to move to Mars or Venus soon. We are the human beings put on this earth-let us take care of it-all of us, both young and old. The movie, I guess, should convict a lot of people for the actions they may have done in the past, or even now. By the way-totally out of topic-I love Jake Gyllenhaal!   Another part of this not so stressful day-(I am on the go for a stress-free life now that school's over)-Story of: Frankie and Jen  So today Frankie and Jen chilled in the mall..."Hmmm...is there a point to all of this (LOL, inside joke?)," says Jen. "Ummm..." Frankie remarks "I dunno." A really weird conversation is sprung up then between two look-alike (maybe relkatives) people close to us-(listen if you care observe if you don't) Lady 1: So ur son is going to university in England? Lady 2: Yes, in Worcester. He got a full scholarship... Lady 1: I'm happy...he's such a smart boy. Lady1: Yes-but I feel like he's not smart enough. (By this time, Jen is laughing) Lady 2: How can you say that? Lady 1: Because...I feel it. He's a straight-A student, but slacks of and drinks a lot, parties till midnight. I hardly know how he does it... (Ok, Jen stops laughing) As if the conversation wasn't weird enough...Kris, Miko, and Leilana came...nope, just kdding it wasn't weird they just LOOKED weird cuz they had their hair dyed in pink-all three of them. They looked like they could be back up singers for Gwen Stefani.  So..think about it-absorb it LOL just kidding but odd? Take it or leave it.  Peace  And love mother earth.

      Well my life doesn't suck for the moment-(hopefully it never will) but I'm pretty tired right now...It's been an okaish day, I guess one of those days when you can go up to ur crush and kiss him madly, passionately on the lips-then leave with a smirk, thinking, I did that. Amigos, amigas, that was not a brag, nor was it pride, it was simply-taking the next step. Of course, most of my pals wouldn't see me doing that-hehe ;P.  But Faith guys may push me away, and go, what the "he** are you thinking!" No-just kidding. Prolly half of the guys in the school really dislike me anywayz-who knows? But as Van would probably tell me, who cares? LOL I want to write a book one day on the significant differences between girls and guys. Besides differences in about EVERYTHING or most things, what else? '"Sometimes I wish I were a leaf flying away, falling asleep". I guess on the emotional side, girlss will feel that. For guys? To takcle the male mind is like going inside a dark room where you're trying to find the switch. When you do find it-you can either like it, find it interesting, or find it empty or boring and leave. Kung puede ko lang isipin yung iniisip nila, well, I guess it'd be easier. Well enough of my guy theories now, I'll prolly end up single and living it up in New York, in a loft with 2 gay guys as my roommates-them teaching me about the world of the gay, and me teaching them the world of the straight! Hehe-lol that would be funny. It's like mixing ice cream and sausages ending up with funny epxressions on your face. But I like to enter the non-conformist, idealistic world. I think my mom would kill me to do so, but I have to find my niche one way or the other in this world.

      My weekend has gone fab with a capital F. Today I went to church and attended this really cute party for this one-year old kid, and yesterday....I went to Em's party!!!! LOL it was Ian's party too and Katie made a cookie cake for him LOL. At Em's party we played all these really funky games like "I never" and also a psychology game lol that would have even lost Ms. Chrystman. I think Ian won that game, he got the jist in like less than a minute or something. I didn't do it...Becca's prolly was the funniest. She was in a semi-twist postiion trying to do a push-up...it was so funny. SHE LOOKED LIKE A MERMAID IN DISTRESS LOL. Also, Steve-O acted like a complete drug-high-Haight-Ashbury hippie when we went on the Scavenger hunt. It was me, Steve-O, Cindy (our beautiful chaueffer), Emily, and Abi. LOL it was so funny cuz Steve was hanging out of the windows yelling at cars which less than severely jokingly pissed me off. And I had to pee really bad in the middle of the Scavenger hunt so it was really funny when I had to use a complete stranger's bathroom (don't ask) and she had no soap so I had to use the shampoo! Would that have been a sight. Anyways, I have to pack for the week..am leaving for Cebu tomorrow late afternoon or night...will be back Friday. Plus, I think I overate today but oh well.

      Today is Saturday!!!! I love the feeling of the weekend. Yesterday was aiight...I GOT A HAIRCUT!!!! I was on the verge of tears then, but it turned out ok LOL. Am leaving for Cebu Monday so I might not be able to blog in a week. And today is Em's party. It looks like will be doing indoors stuff instead of outdoors cuz of the rain. Anyways, if you are in an insufficient relationship these are in a joke-manner way to dump your boyfriend (for ladies only):  1. Tell him you want commitment 2. Tell him your pregnant

      I woke up and I thought about the weirdest things. I am in a happy, confused, state. I am not a psycho. I still know my name.  Ok that was retarded but who cares. I was wondering about many things today. Why are people obsessed with their weight. Why do people spend millions of dollars each year or whatever amount of money just to make themselves beautiful. I think the answer, ladies and gentlemen, is that people are so wrapped up in image. I know a handful who aren't. I'm not wrapped up in image. Why spend millions of dollars trying to perfect faces when we're all going down the six-feet hole anyway? The answer is, in this life, there is no sure thing. That is the beauty of it. We are all *creatures* chasing the wind and we all end up in the ditch and then the afterlife. Our life has to be meaningful-and chasing the wind can be enjoyable. We shouldn't kill ourselves becuse a problem comes along the way. There is always the chance that you will breath again the fresh air of hapiness. I hate when war comes and destroy's people's order of lives. People should just love each other and you know I'm right. So there.  Dear Mark, You are my bitch.

      1) I'm out of estrogen, and I have a gun. 2) Next mood swing, 6 minutes. 3) So many men, so few who can afford me. 4) All stressed out and no one to choke. 5) If they don't have chocolate in Heaven, I ain't goin. 6) My mother is a travel agent for guilt trips. 7) If you want breakfast in bed, sleep in the kitchen. 8) Warning, I have an attitude and I know how to use it. 9) Dinner is ready when the smoke detector goes off. 10) Don't start with me, you WON'T WIN.

      I love Madonna. I love french fries. OK!!!! This is soooo pissing me off....my day is going by unexpectedly horrid, in a sense. I have cramps from my visitor-my lovely period. LOL I know that may sound nasty to you but I am feeling particularly *%$#! as of now. LOL that was a joke and I don't want to end up treating anyone. Like Jen Lin would say (and this is a joke so don't call Scotland Yard Mikey), "Don't mess with me cuz I'm running out of places to hide the dead bodies." LOL. A particularly funny quote by Margaret Cho, (a Korean-American comedian?): "If men had periods, every bachelor apartment would look like a murder scene." Isn't that, in a way, true? I am so not anti-men though...
