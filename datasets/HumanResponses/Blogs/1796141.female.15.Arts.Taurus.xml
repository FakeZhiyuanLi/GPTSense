      Abunai: *huggles Legato-chan*  Legato: Let me go! *struggles*  Abunai: No! I own you! Besides, you'd get killed out there...! *points to rabid fangirls throwing themselves against a barrier*  Legato: *gulp* I think I'll just....stay here...  Abunai: Good boy!  Legato: -_-'  posted by Abunai at 12:33 AM  Legato: *sitting on the floor* That's it! Where's my trenchcoat!? Give it back!  Abunai: No, it's too spiky and stuff, besides, I like what you're wearing now.  Legato: B-but! Trenchcoats are cool! I want mine back!  Abunai: You're right, they are cool. *hands him a trenchcoat* There you go!  Legato: This is not mine, it's dark forest green.  Abunai: So? I like it, and it's not spiky or...um, skull-ish. And it matches your dark blue shirt and your brown pants.  Legato: It does? *looks in full-length mirror that...appeared* Hmm... I guess it's ok.  Abunai: Yay! *huggles* You look great! *squeezes and lets go, then skips off into a field of flowers that...appeared...(hmmm, I see a connection)*  Legato: O.o *sigh* Never...  posted by Abunai at 12:37 AM  Abunai: Legato-chan, what'cha doing?  Legato: *twitches at the pet name* Eating...  Abunai: Oh... What'cha eating?  Legato: -_-' Hotdogs...  Abunai: Really? Yum! *grabs a hotdog, tries to run away with it, but is tackled by non-other than Legato himself*  Legato: *snarls* It's mine!  Abunai: o.o Ok ok...sheesh, here... *hands it back*  Legato: ^-^ Yay! *eats it*  Abunai: O.o  posted by Abunai at 12:38 AM  Abunai was bored. She decided to sing a song.  Crawling in my skin,  These wounds,  They will not heal,  Fear is how I fall,  Confusing what is real...   There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface,  Consuming,  Confusing,  This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending,  Controlling,  I can't seem,  To find myself again,  My walls are closing in,  (Not a sense of confidence,  I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take)  I've felt this way before,  So insecure...   Crawling in my skin,  These wounds,  They will not heal,  Fear is how I fall,  Confusing what is real...   This comfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me,  Distracting,  Reacting,  Against my will I stand beside my own reflection,  It's haunting,  How I can't seem,  To find myself again,  My walls are closing in,  (Not a sense of confidence,  I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take)  I've felt this way before,  So insecure...   Crawling in my skin,  These wounds,  They will not heal,  Fear is how I fall,  Confusing what is real...   There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface,  Consuming,  (Confusing what is real...)  This lack of self-control I fear is never-ending,  Controlling,  (Confusing what is real...)  posted by Abunai at 12:39 AM  Legato: Why did you sing that song?  Abunai: 'Cuz, I felt like it. Duh.  Legato: I see. And what connection does this song have to your pathetic excuse for a life?  Abunai: ... *bursts out crying* You insensitive jerk! *runs off*  Legato: O_O' Wha... What'd I do?! *chases after her*  posted by Abunai at 12:40 AM  (After running awhile, Legato comes upon Abunai in a tree overlooking a meadow.)  Legato: Oi, get down here!  Abunai: *shakes head*  Legato: Fine, I'll make you. *uses his telekinesis*  Abunai: *just sits there*  Legato: o_o' 'I can't control her? Impossible! Yet... Oh no... This is quite a confusing matter, how shall I get her down?'  (unbeknownst to Legato, Abunai is watching him intently.)  Abunai: 'Hmm... He looks quite perplexed. *smile* I should just go down there.' *appears behind him and sits there*  (Legato had no idea of what just happened, and sits down in front of Abunai, unknowingly, of course.)  Legato: *sighs as he looks into the tree, only to discover that Abunai no longer occupies the tree's branches* 'Where'd she go?' Abunai?  Abunai: *stifles a laugh as she sits there* 'I know what I'll do! *grin*'  (Legato is glomped from behind, startling him.)  Legato: *oof* Ahhh! 'No! It seems that I cannot move, though it is probably just her.' *sigh*  Abunai: *giggle* Je t'adore, aussi, Legato. ^-^  Legato: 'What did she say...' O.o Um, ok...  Abunai: *squeal*  Legato: >_ posted by Abunai at 12:40 AM  Legato wandered in a seemingly aimless way, but the person who he was following seemed to know where she was going.   He yelled above the semi-roar of the teeming hallway.   Legato: Where in Gunsmoke are we going!?   People stopped and stared at him as if it was the first time that they had even noticed he was there.   Legato looked around nervously, then made his way through the hall, following his, um, Keeper.   Legato: Wait up, Abunai! I can't follow you with all these midgets cluttering around me.   Abunai: Oh, shut up, Legato-chan, they're not midgets.   Legato: Yes they are! They're short, and they're everywhere!   It was true. From his point of view, all the people around him would be short. Except for some. Legato caught up with Abunai, his face sporting a sour look.   Legato: Where are we going, Master?   She gave him a strange look. He'd never called her that before.   Abunai: We are going to EITE. And why did you call me 'Master'?   Legato: 'EITE?' Oh, I see. 'Not.' And I call you that because you have replaced my former one. And I hesitate to call you my Mistress because I'm not sure how your people would react.   As it was, Legato had noticed how normal words had made people laugh and joke. He didn't understand, what was so funny?   Abunai: *laugh* You'll get used to it, Legato-chan.   She gave him a bright smile as they entered a classroom.  posted by Abunai at 12:41 AM  Legato stepped into the open door tentatively. He just didn't get it. Why was he being so careful? He had discovered that the humans could not see him. Abunai had explained that he was from an anime, whatever that was, and therefore, not real. Only to her, and maybe others. She beckoned him from a desk, and he sat in juxtaposition on a counter to her left. The teacher mentioned something about 'modules' and then they were once again on the move.   Legato: Blast it, Abunai! Why do you carry so much stuff?   Abunai gave him a sideways glance.   Abunai: You never know what you'll need or when you need it. I find that if leave something at home and fret over whether I should take it, *sigh* that it will come to a point in the day that I will need it.   Legato: Oh. Very wise, Master. 'Oh, that is just it!'   He was beginning to become unsettled by the stares from the pale boy at the other side of the room. It surprised him when his Master started towards the boy.   Abunai: Hey, Sutebenu!   The boy now identified as Sutebenu remained quiet, and continued to stare at the tall psychopath.   Sutebenu: Le...gato? Abunai, WTF, is he real? Or did I take some baaaaad acid...?   Legato started. He could see him? He'd have to ask Master.   Legato: Master, why is it that this human can see me, yet the others remain oblivious?   Abunai: He likes the anime that you are in, Legato-chan, that must be why.   Sutebenu looked a little deranged for a moment before he spoke.   Sutebenu: He is real! Dude! I don't know how, or why, but... And why is it him and not Sesshomaru? I would have thought that you would bring him out of anyone else...   Legato had to shut him up. He just continued on and on. And who was the Sessho-what guy? And why was this puny human saying that his Master was expected to bring him? Legato was about to make him kill himself, but Abunai noticed.   Abunai: Legato, stop it. You shall not harm him. He'll shut up, eventually.   Legato stopped himself at his Master's call. He need not destroy the waste of life, his Master acted as if she knew him well.   Abunai: Sutebenu, calm down, sheesh. I've been sayin' forever that I own him. 'At least he's not being perverted, that's a relief...' *turns to Legato* Spare him, for he knows not your mannerisms well enough.   Legato noticed how his Master's tongue had been looser while speaking to the human than when she spoke to him. He smirked. It could only mean that she held him in higher regard.   Legato: Very well, I shall not harm him. Unless...   Legato moved closer to Sutebenu.   Legato: ...he decides to be inappropriate around my Master.   Sutebenu looked nervous at the close proximity of the known-killer.   Abunai: HA HA! That means that you can't be a hentai, eh heh heh...   Sutebenu: WHAT!? You do it too!   Abunai took on a haughty tone.   Abunai: Only because I am surrounded by it in this class, and I adapt. So nah.   Sutebenu looked at a loss for a moment.   Sutebenu: Sooo... Whattawe do now?   Abunai: Good question. Legato, any input on the sit?   Legato: Sit?   Abunai: Yeah, the situation.   Legato: Oh, well, excellent question, Master. What is this?   Legato had pointed to the computer.   Abunai: It's a no-go, Legato-chan. We've tried. No internet. No fanfiction. No nothing. *sigh*   Sutebenu: Well... I have my books.   Abunai nearly jumped out of her seat.   Abunai: Yay! Give 'em up! You have King of Hell, right?   Sutebenu: Yeah. And Kyo and X.   Abunai: W00T! Hey, give Legato X/1999, he might like it.   Sutebenu gave her a weird look, but gave her King of Hell and Legato X. He kept Samurai Deeper Kyo for himself. He seemed to enjoy the pictures most. (-_-' ...)   And so they entered their happy places. All but Legato. This book, it had pictures. Every page had pictures. He had expected more of his Master than that. Oh well.   Abunai: Legato-chan, read it, it's good. It's called a manga, or a graphic novel. I have some of my own, but... you don't want those, eh heh.   Legato: Yes, Master. If you say so.   And so Legato entered the world of X/1999. This reminded him very much of all the non-human or super-human people he had come to know on Gunsmoke, only the characters were much more stunningly equipped with abilities. He quite liked Kamui, he would be a very formidable foe.   Time passed, as it always did. This was the norm for Abunai and Sutebenu. They never did anything in this class but relax. It was almost like a study hall. The minutes crawled by until it was 'cleanup' time. Abunai snorted in half-amusement, half-disgust.   Abunai: 'We never do anything that requires cleaning, really.'   Legato: #It seems that way, since we haven't moved almost at all.#   Abunai: #AHHH! Legato! >_  It was then that she started to hum Rem's song. Then Sutebenu joined in. Legato's head snapped up. It was just the same as the one that he'd heard in Vash's head.   Legato: How do you know that song?   Sutebenu: It's Rem's song and it's annoying as hell, but you can never get it out of your head. Especially once she starts humming it. -_-'   Abunai: Ha ha. You know you love the song! Even though we can never find out the words or download it... Tch.   Sutebenu: Whatever.   They began to gather up their things. For Abunai, it took longer. She carried everything that you could possibly need, it seemed. The bell rang.   Abunai: Lunch time! Tho' I never really eat... okay then, MOOCHING TIME! W00T! ^_^'   Sutebenu: PIGGIES! ^o^   Abunai: No! Bad!   Sutebenu looked down in mock shame.   Abunai: Omg... Stupid monkey... Come hither, ye shall!   And so they left the class, and entered the commons.  posted by Abunai at 12:43 AM  Legato sat next to his Master, Abunai, in the center of the gathering place known as the commons. Soon, there were many gathered around in the spot.   Abunai whispered to Legato;   Abunai: Legato-chan, I'm not sure how many people will be able to see you, but be assured that some will.   She gave him a bright smile and ate some of her sunflower seeds. A few eyes strayed to Legato's form, but quickly looked away.   Legato: 'Heh, they must think themselves crazy. After all, it's not everyday that you see a tall man like myself in this grade, so says Master.'   Abunai nudged him in the side.   Abunai: Eat up, we don't have all the time in the world, you know.   Legato gave a small smirk.   Legato: Oh? Heh. I thought otherwise, Master.   Abunai smacked his arm lightly.   Abunai: Yeah yeah, Mr. I-Can-Make-People-Kill-Themselves-And-Eachother! Ha ha ha.   Legato:... That's my name, don't wear it out.   Abunai looked at him for a moment, a look of confusion.   Abunai: Um, yeah, maybe you shouldn't hang around the eight graders, Legato...   "Master!"   A shout was heard from the left side of the commons.   Legato was perplexed.   Legato: 'Master? She has other servants?'   Abunai read his expression.   Abunai: Oh, don't worry, that's Mary-chan. I marked a few people with my Minion Mark, so some of them call me Master Midget Naraku, or just Naraku. She may be able to see you, though she's never seen Trigun. Mary-chan!   Mary slid in near them.   Abunai: Mary-chan, do you see anyone near me? Remember the guy I described?   Abunai 'pointed' to Legato with a shake of her head. Mary's eyes widened.   Mary: Faintly, but ooooh... He is hot!   Abunai blushed.   Abunai: MARY! Ok ok, you can see him, good, let's hope Palmer can't.   So they ate their lunch.  posted by Abunai at 12:47 AM   Abunai: Soup soup soup soup! I hope it's soup, Legato-chan!   Abunai seemingly loved soup. A lot. Soon, though, disdain filled her face.   Abunai: Whaaaaaat!? No soup!?   She sobbed into her hands. Okay, so maybe she liked soup a little too much.   Legato wondered.   'What has gotten into Master?'   She had never cried before in his presence.   Legato: Master, what ails you? Are you all right?   Abunai looked up and smiled at him. She wasn't’t crying after all.   Abunai: I'm fine, I'm fine. No need to worry, silly! I just wish that soup was for lunch today...   Legato: Master, I can easily persuade them to make soup for you. It will only take a thought.   Abunai: No, no. That's ok. They may have some tomorrow. W00T!   Sutebenu was busying himself with purchasing two cookie cones, a Snickers Ice Cream Bar, and an ice cream sandwich.   Abunai: Oh god, he really likes those. Almost too much... Dun dun dunnn! Ha ha. Well, it seems like I won't be getting any food...   Abunai reached over and grabbed a cup of shelled sunflower seeds.   Abunai: ...Almost. Yay! I love these!   She was supposed to buy them, but...   Abunai: Legato, do you want anything? I know how much you like to eat.   Legato looked at Abunai before nodding slowly. He didn't want his Master to waste money on him. But food...   Abunai: Ok then. What do you want, ham or turkey? It comes with chips.   Legato pointed to the ham sub.   Abunai: Squirrel's gonna jump you for that ham, heh.   Legato: Thank you Master. But you don't have to-   Abunai cut him off.   Abunai: Nonsense. You can get anything you like, and we could steal some ice cream. Only, you have to hide them in your trench, kay?   Legato: Yes, Master. I shall hide them in my 'trench'.   Abunai: Good. Okay then.   She took one of the ham subs from the salad bar and also some more sunflower seeds. Next, she went to the lunch lady and paid for the meal. She then gave Legato the lunch to hide.   Abunai: Kay, we have to wait for some other people to get in front of the freezer- there we go!   Abunai went to the freezer and covertly snatched a Snickers and shoved it into Legato's pocket.   Sutebenu: Let's go.   Abunai: And don't look guilty and crap.   The trio headed back to the commons.  posted by Abunai at 12:46 AM   Abunai: Now is the time of the lunch! Mwahahaha!   Legato looked on as the small group made their way to the middle of the commons.   Legato: The middle? Why are we going there?   Abunai turned and looked at him as if it was the most obvious thing in the world.   Abunai: Legato-chan, ever since I joined my group, our goal has been getting into the middle of the commons. Alas, we were not sure if this was allowed, until that fateful day *cough* yesterday *cough* Ms. Piggy, aka, Buta-san, moved us here! There was much rejoicing on my part.   Sutebenu nodded.   Sutebenu: She practically screamed "ALRIGHT!"   Abunai laughed.   Abunai: Indeed I did! ^__^ The only reason she moved us was because we never cleaned up! Yeah right! We always did, and I'm on permanent clean-up duty for the whole commons! Crap! But oh well, it's not like I have anything better to do.   Legato: I see... So you were all falsely accused?   Sutebenu: Yes, but this place is much better, now we can, like, spread out. YAAAAAAAY!   Abunai: Yeah. Actually, I was wondering where you would sit. We were kinda squished together in the old place. If I couldn't find a place for you, I might have sat in your lap...   Legato observed in disbelief the blush that stained Abunai's cheeks. Was she embarrassed of him? No, it couldn't be...   Abunai: Ok then! Hmmm, what's for lunch...? Well, lessee...   Abunai took a long whiff of the air. Legato watched as she did so.   Abunai: Um... I...I can't tell... Smells like everyday... Darn. Oh well, not like Buta-san won't be prowling around for victims. Alas, bringing food is not `acceptable'.   Abunai snorted in contempt.   Abunai: Come, Legato-chan, let us see what is for lunch, and, oh, heeeey, Legato can hide the food in his trench! W00T! ^__^   So the trio walked across the large room with many windows to the `salad bar' line.  posted by Abunai at 12:45 AM  Since Abunai did not have much food, she finished her sunflower seeds fairly quickly and got a few handouts. No one ever had any food in her group, but they fed each other. Yay!   Abunai picked up her sketchpad and drew another installment of Chalk It Up To Boredom. She was glad they made everyone laugh. And the security guard had said that she'd one day be famous, after telling her that she should visit the counselor, of course.   This one installment featured a satanic monkey mauling a poor, unfortunate person. He deserved it, though. He shouldn't have been throwing popcorn at them. She scribbled in some words to the side describing what happened when you were bored this time. She really hadn't meant it to be a series like it had turned into. It had started in her first hour Biology class while they were reviewing, and hey, she was bored.   The poor dude's head and stomach had exploded from trying to remember all the facts from the class, oh, and he was hungry too. That's why his stomach had exploded. She had proudly shown off the picture of the boy's bloody body to her friends and teachers, even. She had then shown it to her friend Kegan-kun, he said that she should make more then sell them. He was funny. Yet, she did continue them, and had two more done by her fourth hour class. They really weren't very time consuming, and she noticed that it was easier to draw pictures of people being mutilated. Go figure.   Putting her sadistic side away for the moment, she scanned the people of the surrounding area for someone she loathed with all her being.   Palmer.   To her dismay, he was coming towards the 'circle-of-friends'. More like 'circle-of-insane-trash-can-worshippers'. He did not understand at all the complex society of freaks, ne, pyschopaths, and their traditions. What little he had learned, he overdid to a point which made her sick with rage and loathing for the pathetic waste of life he was. True, you should not hit a man when he's down, but her group at one point in time, did kick those unfortunate enough to be in the middle of the circle.   But that was old news. They no longer did that. The middle was a place of honor, and the occupier should be treated with somewhat respect, then shoved out unceremoniously. Yet, never kicked. Palmer, though, clung to his old knowledge like a fly to flypaper. Times change and move on, but Palmer remained in his old mindset.   Sutebenu was now occupying the center, thus Palmer acted himself.   Palmer: He's in the middle! Kick him!   Oh, how Abunai would love to pry the little fly that Palmer was from the sticky paper and rip his little legs off.   Legato sensed his Master's obvious dislike of the newcomer.   Legato: #Master, do you wish for me to end his existence?#   Abunai nearly jumped up. She remembered her mind-link with Legato and gave him a mental hug.   Abunai: #How I wish that you could kill him, Legato! I HATE HIM! Alas, I cannot allow you to destroy him. *sigh* But, you could make him hurt himself!#   Abunai mentally whispered her ways of torture into her minion's head. Legato winced. His Master was a truly evil and sadistic person sometimes, but not so very much as Knives. She had told him that he was a good person, he just needed a hug when he was little. Yeah...   The unknowing Palmer stood, shock clearly written across his face.   Palmer: W-what's going on?!   Palmer's squeaked response to losing the control of his body amused Abunai. She laughed evilly.   Abunai: What is it, Palmer? Feeling... Helpless, perhaps? Heh heh heh...   Palmer's eyes widened in fright as his hand raised into the air, formed into a fist, and struck himself in his non-goods.   (well, yeah, I'm evil....)   Abunai: #Legato, you can let go of his mind now. People might get suspicious.#   Legato: #Yes, Master, as you wish.#   Legato let the fine link of his mind control slip and he released control over the pallid form of the human now laying on the ground.   Abunai: Serves you right, and be thankful that it wasn't I that went apeshit on you like I did last time. You've none to blame but yourself, freak.   Abunai glomped Legato from his side. To some, it looked like she was hugging air. To others, it looked like she was hugging a tall, dark, and handsome man. (*drool*)   Legato: I-it was no problem, Master, really...   Abunai: Nonsense! It's wonderful to watch him writhe in agony, thank you, Legato-chan...   She gave him one more quick squeeze, then rose from her seat on the floor.   Abunai: We are leaving, Legato-chan.   Abunai looked around the now empty commons area for any large trash. What she spotted was a red box laying under a bench.   Abunai: I wonder what that could be... Shayna-chan, come here!   And thus, another one of Abunai's friends entered the picture.   Shayna: Yes Abunai-chan, what is it?   Abunai wandered over to the box.   Abunai: I think it's a lava lamp. Hmm, is it empty?   She picked it up. It was so not empty!   Abunai: OMG! It IS a lava lamp! And there's no one around to claim it... It's mine now! Ha! But, an alibi I need, yes! Um...um...Josh!   Said Josh came over to Abunai.   Josh: Yeah? What is it?   Abunai: Josh, if anyone asks where I got this, say you gave it to me.   Josh: Ok, what is it?   Abunai: It's a lava lamp that I found, and it's mine now!   Josh: Ok then, hell, I'd jack it too!   They all shared a good laugh at this.   Abunai: Thanks, Josh. Heh!   Josh: It's no problem, eh?   Abunai: No problem.   Josh turned to Legato.   Josh: Way cool trench, man. See you guys later!   Abunai: Hmm, seems like he can see you too, Legato-chan.   Shayna: Who are you talking about- OH GOD!   Shayna had just noticed Legato.   Shayna: Wow, it's Legato! Oh god!   Shayna did a happy dance.   Abunai: Yeeeah... Let's go to art, Shayna-chan...   Abunai dragged her friend to their art class, which they shared.   Shayna: It's Legato! OMG!   Legato: I believe you've said that numerous times, Shayna.   Shayna: It really is him!   Abunai: ...Yes, it is...   And so, Abunai dragged her friend to class with Legato trailing shortly behind them.  posted by Abunai at 12:47 AM  Legato followed Abunai and her friend, Shayna-chan, into the small hall which led to a classroom with many colorful objects adorning the walls. A few boys were at the front of the room playing with a seemingly fabric ball that sounded as if contained many tiny pebbles. Legato remembered this as hackey, his Master had explained it before. Abunai half-dragged half-led her friend to the table in the middle of the room. Abunai growled which was followed by a short exclamation.  Abunai: Why is my chair always moved?!  The fuming girl went to the back of the room and pulled a seat from near a large desk, which Legato deduced was the instructor's.  Abunai: That better be the last time, or I'm suing. Ha ha.  Abunai looked at the table and her eyes widened. The surrounding tables were full... Where would Legato sit? Abunai sighed as she gently tugged on Legato's sleeve. He looked down.  Legato: Yes master? I wonder what she wants...  Abunai's eyes lit up.  Abunai: What I want? ... Nevermind. I need you to sit between Shayna-chan's chair and my chair.  Abunai motioned to the floor.  Abunai: You can kneel there and rest your arms on the table. Ok? There's no room for another chair, I'm afraid, and the teach would get suspicious if there were three chairs anyway. Or he might just take it away...  Legato nodded in agreement.  Legato: That seems fine Master, but are you sure that there will be enough room for me in the middle?  Abunai shook her head.  Abunai: I thought of that, too. If it doesn't work...  The seconds were ticking by and not much time was left to spare as the three settled into their spots.  Legato looked uncomfortable for a moment before he spoke up.  Legato: Er, Master?  Abunai glanced at him.  Abunai: Too close?  Legato nodded.  Legato: Sorry. It almost worked.  Abunai sighed. It seemed that she was going to have to after all...  Abunai: Legato, it's not your fault. Ok, on to plan B.  Abunai slowly got up from her seat and motioned to the now vacated spot.  Abunai: Legato, sit there. Just do it, ok?  She had successfully cut any excuses that Legato had even thought to say. He settled into the chair and was quite surprised when he saw Abunai move to sit in his lap. She had angled herself sideways so that Legato could still put his legs under the table. She looked at his face for a moment before turning her head back to the table which was covered with her stuff.  Abunai: I'm sorry if you're uncomfortable, Legato, but this will have to do. I really don't know how we have gotten this far without raising suspicion. I guess, all's well that ends well, right?  She looked at his face and laughed. It looked so cute and funny. He looked so confused. She straightened up when everything went quite.  Abunai: Crap, why does he always have to choose me to be the victim of his 'Be quiet I'm trying to talk' stare?!  She shut her mouth quickly and looked around sheepishly before leaning back against Legato lightly.  Legato was at odds. How was he supposed to comfort her in her nearly obvious state of embarrassment and unease? A thought struck him and he reached a hand to lightly pat her on the top of her head. She looked up at him for a second, confusion written plainly upon her features, then smiled. Legato mentally sighed. That seemed to do the trick. They both turned their attention to the teacher drawling at the front of the classroom. Sumifu-san was his name.  Sumifu: Now, as most of you do, most people use lines to make the faces that they draw. But I'm going to teach you how by using shading and those of you with a mechanical pencil will find it more difficult than those of you with a regular pencil blah blah blah blah... And then you put in the shape of the eyes making sure to blah blah blah blah... As you can see, the lips are made up of many lines, the top lip has more shadow than the lower blah blah blah blah... And now I want you to practice.  So the teacher let them practice for the remaining amount of class time, unless he wanted to say something else along the lines of uselessness.  Abunai leaned a little to the side so that she could rest her arm on the table as she drew. Slowly she sketched out bangs that covered the person's right eye, and drew an ear that would be the basis from which the side of the face grew downward. On to the chin and over lips curving in a soft smile which resided under a prominent nose. Finishing the hair, she drew in the one eye that you could see, it shining with some unknown emotion. Well, as much as she could show through pencil. Over it was a finely sculpted eyebrow. Shayna-chan looked over at the picture.  Shayna-chan: 'Tis Legato-chan! Yay.  Legato looked down at what his Master was drawing. His own face stared back at him. It was a somewhat strange feeling, something akin to deja vu. He decided to speak up.  Legato: That is very good, Master. I didn't know that you had such talent.  Abunai blushed as Legato smiled at and praised her.  Abunai: It's nothing, Le-Legato... Really...  Abunai shifted uncomfortably under his gaze. It was almost time to go, anyway. Shayna-chan had been unusually quiet today. Maybe it was because that there was a psychopath right next to her. Oh well. Abunai sighed as she stood up.  Abunai: Time to go, Legato-chan.  Legato: Yes, Master.  She reached for his hand as he stood and pulled him along as she called Shayna to bring back whatever she had captured today to make Abunai hurry along.  posted by Abunai at 4:52 PM  Abunai pulled Legato along by his hand as she half-ran half-walked down the hallway, dodging people as she went. A group of preps were walking hand-in-hand down the hall, further blocking her passage. Abunai's mind screamed in rage.  Abunai: GET OUT OF MY WAY YOU DAMNED FREAKS! I'M GONNA BE LATE! Oh no oh no oh no!  Legato, being the psychic he was, sensed Abunai's rage and heard her comments. He allowed the feathery web of his mind link to sooth her rage and tell her his plans.  Legato: 'Master, I shall make this easier on both of us, ne? Those who are in our way shall part, leaving us a clear path.'  Like wind rippling the surface of water, the teeming masses of teenagers rippled to the side of the halls, vacant eyes unseeing. Time seemed to stop, all but for the two making their way down the now clear path. Abunai glanced inside a classroom to the digital clock on the wall. The red numbers flickered slightly, a strange occurrence. Abunai's locker drew closer as the seconds stretched out until they seemed taut like a rubber band wound too many times. Her unease grew as she relinquished Legato's hand and set her bag on the ground next to a locker, hers being the one-thousandth two-hundredth and eighty-fourth one to grace the walls. Sighing as she fiddled with the combination lock, she opened the door on her second try.  Abunai: Stupid combos and their preciseness-ness... Legato, what time is it?  Legato looked down at the watch Abunai had given him, it being set to the exact second, as per her orders.  Legato: It is 42 minutes and 22 seconds past the 13th hour of the 23rd day of the 1st month of the year 2004, Master.  Abunai glanced at him and gave him a wry smile.  Abunai: Now that's what I like to hear, heh.  Legato gave a small smile and held out a hand as she pulled her Literature book from the locker. He quickly bent down and picked up her backpack, slinging it over his shoulder, while Abunai placed her battered blue jean purse over hers. She looked over at Legato with a smirk adorning her face.  Abunai: Wanna race?  Her eyes sparkled with mischievous light as her proposition hung in the air like the smell of sulfur after a chemistry lab explosion. Legato slowly nodded his head in agreement, a smirk also finding it's way upon his visage. Without a reply, Abunai grabbed her purse by its extremely long strap and rushed down the hallway, taunting him with a grin, and whispering a challenge into his mind.  Abunai: 'Last one there is the underlord to the winner, the overlord! Bwahahaha!'  Legato sprinted after his Master while he calculated her distance from him.  Legato: Underlord, eh? We'll see who is the Underlord is in this match!  Abunai quickly rounded a corner, nearly running into the zombie-like form of some teacher whom she didn't have a class with. She smirked and saluted them, then continued on her way. Seeing the English hall right in front of her, she put on more speed and - nearly crashed into Legato.  Did I say nearly? I mean she crashed into Legato, and vice versa.  The two lay sprawled out in the middle of the hall, items strewn to the left and to the right, surrounded by vacant eyes staring listlessly and unaware of the current situation. Abunai slowly sat up and shook her head a few times. She turned her head and looked over Legato, shook her head slightly, and gathered up the things that had flown out of her purse. She kneeled near Legato's prone form and sighed before shaking him lightly.  Abunai: Legato... Legato, wake up... Grrr...  The prone Legato mumbled before opening his eyes and looking around warily. Suddenly, he clutched his head in pain. Had he hurt himself? Abunai placed her arm around his shoulder and looked him over. He wasn't bleeding, that was a good sign...  Abunai: Legato-chan, what's wrong, I can't help you if I don't know what's wrong with you!  Hearing the panic-filled voice, Legato's hands lowered from his head.  Legato: I... I used a time stop so that possessing the humans wouldn't interfere with their schedule. I guess that running wasn't such a good idea...  Abunai pulled him into a fierce hug.  Abunai: Don't do that ever again without telling me, and especially if you're new to trying time-stops, Legato!  Legato sighed and nodded his head and shakily stood up. That was the last time he would try something new without telling his... Wait... Legato looked at Abunai, who was now pulling them the rest of the way to the Advanced English room.  Legato: Master... How... How did you know that I wa-  Abunai: I just did, ok? Now, I'm going to make you really comfy, because it was partly my fault for making you run while you were stopping time. Speaking of which, you can stop stopping it now, eh heh.  Legato sighed as he let go of the strenuous hold he had upon time as Abunai directed him to a desk. She let go of his hand and he stood there, letting all the thoughts that had been plaguing him drift away. The trouble with being telepathic was that others’ thoughts could come unbidden unless you had a barrier up. Lately, he had let it down more so he could practice the time-stop, but it also meant that he was being sent useless mental thoughts and images by hormone-ridden teenagers. He shuddered at the thought. Scary. He felt himself being pulled downward, toward the floor, and then kneeling and leaning against something. He looked up and saw his master smiling at him. Apparently, she was sitting in the desk with him to her left in the most comfortable position he could take in such a small space and no spare desk. She continued to smile brightly at him and patted his head in a loving manner, as a mother would to a child.  Abunai: Comfy?  She gave him an impromptu hug as he nodded and blinked a few times. His life had changed so drastically since he had met his new Master. First of all, he was alive. Hadn't he forced Vash to kill him? Shouldn't he be in oblivion, away from all the voices? From what Abunai had told him, Vash had defeated Knives, and he was no longer needed, besides the fact that he was supposed to be dead. So what was his purpose? To serve his new Master, yes, but she had no plans of world domination, at least he thought. She was content having him by her side. If that was what she wanted, then so be it. He would stay with her undoubtedly. Gingerly, he put an arm around her, and faced her.  Legato: Master... Shouldn't we start class now and let the people go?  She sighed and nodded, all he needed to release his hold upon the unknowing minds of the school's inhabitants. There was silence before everyone started to move again. Luckily, no one was in the room when they had arrived, so no one would be surprised at their, or rather, Abunai's, sudden appearance. Soon, the entire class had filed into the room, and moments later the bell rang. As always, the teacher started right away.  Sutsurinjiru-san: Turn your Lit books to page 630, Romeo and Juliet Scene 2 of Act II, Capulet's orchard.  Legato watched as the teacher pushed a button on a piece of lost technology that Abunai had not yet explained to him. He was about to ask her what it was, but she quieted him with a finger to her lips and a softly whispered "Listen..." Legato nodded, and stared at the pages of her books with eyes slowly glazing over as he was lost within the words...  Romeo: He jests at scars that never felt a wound. But soft! What light from yonder window breaks? It is the East, and Juliet is the sun! Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief That thou her maid art far more fair than she. Be not her maid, since she is envious. Her vestal livery is but sick and green, And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off. It is my lady! O, it is my love! O, that she knew she were! She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that? Her eye discourses, I will answer it. I am too bold; 'tis not to me she speaks. Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, Having some business, do entreat her eyes, To twinkle in their spheres till they return. What if her eyes were there, they in her head? The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That the birds would sing and think it were not night! See how she leans her cheek upon her hand! O, that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek!  Juliet: Ay me!  Abunai sighed and tenderly ruffled Legato's hair. He also sighed. It was then that she realized that he was sleeping, and smiling softly, too! How cute! Maybe it was her imagination, but he seemed to like the story of Romeo and Juliet, if his thoughts and feelings were anything to rely upon. The sweet, untainted thoughts of someone softly slumbering with an unadulterated smile upon their face. Pure bliss. A dark angel of destruction was sleeping, and his mind was free to dream and remain blissfully undisturbed by thoughts not his own. 'Kirei...' Abunai turned her attention to her book once more.  Abunai: Now... Where were we...  Romeo: She speaks. O, speak again, bright angel, for thou art As glorious to this night, being o'er my head, As is a wing-ed messenger of heaven Unto the white-upturn-ed wond'ring eyes Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him When he bestrides the lazy puffing clouds And sails upon the bosom of the air.  Juliet: O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.  Romeo: Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?  Juliet: 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy. Thou art thyself, though, not a Montague. What's Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face. O, be some other name Belonging to a man. What's in a name? That which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet. So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name; And for thy name, which is no part of thee, Take all myself.  Romeo: I take thee at thy word. Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized; Henceforth I never will be Romeo.  Juliet: What man art thou, that, thus bescreened in night, So stumblest on my counsel?  Romeo: By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am. My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself Because it is an enemy to thee. Had I it written, I would tear the word.  Juliet: My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words Of thy tongue's uttering, yet I know the sound. Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?  Romeo: Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.  Juliet: How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The orchard walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.  Romeo: With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do, that dares love attempt. Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.  Juliet: If they do see thee, they will murder thee.  Romeo: Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye Than twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet, And I am proof against their enmity.  Juliet: I would not for the world they saw thee here.  Romeo: I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes; And but thou love, let them find me here. My life were better ended by their hate Than death prorogu-ed, wanting of thy love.  Juliet: By whose direction found'st thou out this place?  Romeo: By Love, that first did prompt me to inquire, He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes. I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far As that vast shore washed with the farthest sea, I should venture for such merchandise.  Juliet: Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face; Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou has heard me speak tonight. Fain would i dwell on form-fain, fain deny What I have spoke; but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say "Ay"; And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear'st, Thou may prove false. At lovers' perjuries, They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully. Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won, I'll frown and be perverse and say thee nay, So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world. In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond, And therefore thou mayst think my havior light, But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true Than those that have more cunning to be strange. I should have been more strange, I must confess, But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware, My truelove passion. Therefore pardon me, And not impute this yielding to light love, Which the dark night hath so discover-ed.  Romeo: Lady, by yonder bless-ed moon I vow, That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-  Juliet: O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circle orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.  Romeo: What shall I swear by?  Juliet: Do not swear at all; Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.  Romeo: If my heart's dear love-  Juliet: Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract tonight. It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one cans say it lightens. Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast!  Romeo: O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?  Juliet: What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?  Romeo: The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.  Juliet: I gave thee mine before thou didst request it; And yet I would it were to give again.  Romeo: Wouldst thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?  Juliet: But to be frank and give it thee again. And yet I wish but for the thing I have. My bounty is as boundless as the sea, My love as deep; the more I give to thee, The more I have, for both are infinite. I hear some noise within! Dear love, adieu!  [Nurse calls from wittin the house]  Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true. Stay but a little, I will come again. [Exits]  Romeo: O bless-ed, bless-ed night! I am afeard, Being in night, all this is but a dream. Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.  [Juliet enters again]  Juliet: Three words. Dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If thy bent of love be honorable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.  Nurse (within): Madam!  Juliet: I come anon. - But if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee-  Nurse (within): Madam!  Juliet: By and by I come.- To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief. Tomorrow will I send.  Romeo: So thrive my soul-  Juliet: A thousand times good night! [Exits.]  Romeo: A thousand times the worse, to want thy light! Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books; But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.  [Enter Juliet again.]  Juliet: Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falc'ner's voice To lure this tassel gentle back again! Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud, Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine With repetition of "My Romeo!"  Romeo: It is my soul that calls upon my name. How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night, Like softest music to attending ears!  Juliet: Romeo!  Romeo: My sweet?  Juliet: What o'clock tomorrow Shall I send to thee?  Romeo: By the hour of nine.  Juliet: I will not fail. 'Tis twenty years till then. I have forgot why I did call thee back.  Romeo: Let me stand here till thou remember it.  Juliet: I shall forget, to have thee still stand there, Rememb'ring how I love thy company.  Romeo: And I'll stay, to have thee still forget, Forgetting any other home but this.  Juliet: 'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone- And yet no farther than a wanton's bird, That lets it hop a little from his hand, Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves, And with a silken thread plucks it back again, So loving-jealous of his liberty.  Romeo: I would I were that bird.  Juliet: Sweet, so would I. Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing. Good night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night till it be morrow. [Exits.]  Romeo: Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast! Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest! Hence will I to my ghostly friar's close cell, His help to crave and my dear hap to tell. [Exits.]  (End Scene 2)  Sutsurinjiru-san switched off the tape player with a few minutes to spare, explaining this and that as was wanted by any pupil. Abunai looked at the peacefully sleeping Legato, not really wanting to wake him, but knowing that she must. The smile still graced his lips and made him the picture of perfect serenity. Regretting having to wake him, she shook him slowly, also not to draw much attention. Abunai smiled when he mumbled something incoherent.  Abunai: Awake, sweet Romeo, for the morrow is upon us, and I await your counsel.  Legato stirred slightly, then looked up into Abunai's face. He looked around a little before whispering something. She bent down and caught a few words.  Legato -was dreaming, you were in it, yawn, and you were on a balcony, too. Strange...  Abunai looked at him confusedly for a moment and then laughed softly. He was dreaming about the play, the silly guy.  Abunai: Ha ha, come Romeo, I mean Legato-chan, we still have one more class to complete, then we can go home and I'll make you a nice comfy pallet on the floor with lots of pillows and blankets and let you pass out for the entire weekend, sound good?  Legato blinked sleepily at her for a moment before yawning and nodding in agreement.  Legato: Sounds good to me, why did you call me Ro-  Ding ding ding, the bell rang and Abunai whisked Legato off to the next and last hour of the week, History, while Legato struggled somewhat, still in a sleep-produced stupor.  posted by Abunai at 12:01 AM  Legato walked behind Abunai as they traveled down the corridors. She didn't seem in too much of a hurry as she walked through a pair of metal double doors after saying 'hi' to M.C. Continuing on, she rounded a corner and also said 'hi' to a group of teachers and the security guard. Quickly turning into the first classroom, she looked at the whiteboard and sighed.  Abunai: Thank Kami that we don't need our books today, Legato-chan. We're watching a movie, 'The Grapes of Wrath'. Joy.  She sighed again and sat down. Legato automatically kneeled next to her desk. Abunai glanced behind them as the bell rang. The seat behind her was unoccupied. She poked Legato's shoulder, and he turned his head to her in response. Just as he was about to ask her what she wanted, the teacher spoke. Legato quieted and looked in her direction, as did Abunai.  Rei-san: Okay! Today is the exciting conclusion to our movie! You will also answer questions 7-9 on your worksheet. Let me pass these out and, happy day, you don't have to do number 10!  Everyone gave an enthusiastic 'Yay . . . ' as they received their papers. Rei-san pushed a button on yet another piece of lost technology, and this time Legato decided to use telepathy instead of speaking.  Legato: 'Master, what was that piece of lost technology in the last class, and in this one as well?'  Abunai: 'Hmm, last hour, you say? That was a 'cassette, or a tape player,' Le-chan. In this class, that is a VCR, um, a Video Cassette, er, Recorder, I guess. You can record things on 'video tapes,' the black rectangular boxes, which, as you can see, can also be played.  Legato's mouth opened slightly in a silent 'o' and he nodded once before turning back to the 'TV'. Abunai almost couldn't take it. It was so fun teaching him about things. He was so curious! It was just kawaii! She smiled and wrapped her arms around his one that was resting on the desk. Sighing as she lightly tightened her grip, she rested her head upon their entwined arms.  Legato was stunned. His Master was being so fond and affectionate to him. He sighed as he shifted into a more comfortable position. His gaze traveled over her form, and across the table top to land upon her worksheet. Legato decided that, if his Master dozed off, he would have to write the answers. His eyes took in Abunai's handwriting and found it to fluctuate quite often, at times being printed, and at other times being cursive. Most occurring, though, was a mixture of the two. He smiled at its semi-sloppiness. She had told him that her handwriting had once been very neat, that is, until she had reached her 7th year of school. It was then that she had begun to write notes for class. 'Either write neatly and slow, and not copy it all,' she had said, 'or write sloppy and fast, and get everything down.'  Abunai tucked her head into her arms and yawned. Maybe she shouldn't have stayed up all night. Oh well. She hugged Legato's arm closer to her as her eyes stared blankly at the television screen. This movie, it was kind of interesting, she guessed. America was a country that started out with a rough start, but it turned out ok . . . Sort of . . . Yet it was so horrendously BORING! She was grateful to Japan for anime, and for Legato, of course. She continued to watch the movie, eyes trained upon the peoples' expressions, and ears tuned into their words.  Abunai unwound one of her arms from Legato's and scribbled in an answer after picking up her pen. After studying the other blank questions for a moment longer, she wrote in answers for them as well. Basically, she was finished. Dropping her pen on the desk with a soft clatter, she one again wrapped her arm around Legato's arm. She soon fell into a light slumber.  Legato took this as a chance to converse with her freely, as she no longer needed to finish her worksheet. Stealthily infiltrating her mind, Legato strolled over her dream scape where she was laying down, surrounded by grasses and tiny, yet fragrant, flowers. This 'scape was so tangible, either she had such a great imagination or she had-  Abunai: Been here before? Yes . . .   Abunai gazed at him with a smile gracing her lips. Bright eyes sparkled when the sun glinted off of them, though, as Legato could clearly see, they held sorrow. She patted the ground beside her and Legato took his place there, laying down on the soft grasses as well. A warm summer's breeze blew and the grasses swayed to its rhythm. Abunai sighed as soft-spoken words issued forth from her mouth.  Abunai: This is how it used to be, Legato . . . This is how it might still be, though I highly doubt it. With urban development, this place is probably gone . . .   Legato's ears heard a faint roar from the intangible distance. Wisps of smoke rose from the field, growing closer and closer at each passing second. He quickly reached out and grabbed Abunai's arm.  Legato: Master, we must go. The field is on fire.  With force he didn't know she had, Abunai pulled Legato back down to her side. Facing the now near smoke, she sighed and once again wrapped herself around Legato's arm.  Abunai: It won't hurt us, don't worry. If anything, you will feel a slight breeze. Frightening, but not harmful in the least.  She said this to him with saddened eyes. The scene before him was being created only for his sight. Legato was sure that Abunai had seen it before, or it might have just been a creation on her imagination. It mattered not. If his Master, or rather, Mistress, said it was safe, he could trust her. After all, it was only a dream.  The fire moved closer to Legato's outstretched legs, it had traveled quickly, and he couldn't help but cringe a little. Abunai looked on impassively, idly watching the flames lick harmlessly at her outstretched hand. As if it had a mind of its own, the fire ran up his Master's arm, and soon encompassed her. Legato, too, was covered in the brightly burning flame, but, as Abunai had said, he only felt a slight warmth, akin to the feel of a summer's breeze. Abunai made a small growling noise.  Abunai: This bores me. Hurry up.  To whom she was speaking was unknown, but her command was seemingly heeded as a bright flash of light briefly took over Legato's vision. His refocusing eyes cleared to discover, not the remains of fire, but freshly turned soil. Not far off to the right, there stood a giant yellow earthmover, it being encrusted in dirt and very well-worn. The tracks of it were strewn across the soft loam, showing that it had been the culprit to destruction.  Abunai: This is what that field has become, Legato-chan. I would also like you to know that this was indeed one of my memories.  She gave a long sigh before standing up and brushing her clothes off. Abunai reached down and pulled him up as well, inspecting him for dirt. She briefly brushed his shoulder.  Legato: Master, why are you brushing me off? This is only a dream scape, and it wouldn't affect the real world.  Abunai: Ah, there you are very much mistaken, my friend. Sometimes . . . My dreams become reality. It is in much the same way that I acquired you, dear. Only, I planned on that happening, but this is just a random annoyance. You know, like having wings. Boy, that was awkward. Thank Kami it was on a weekend. Or the Legions. Creepy. Anyway, it is time to go.  Abunai reached out her hand for Legato's. As he took it, he turned to her, and quizzical look adorning his features.  Legato: Though you portrayed fire destroying the field, I see now evidence that it actually happened. Care to explain?  Abunai smiled at him brightly.  Abunai: Oh, that. Well, that was for drama.  She laughed as the surroundings faded to leave them back in the classroom. The movie was just finishing, the credits rolling along the screen as cheesy music from the thirties played. Abunai yawned and stretched before she stared at the clock. 3:29, she mused, only one more minute . . . Packing whatever she had taken out of her bag back into it, she threw it over her shoulder and turned to Legato.  Abunai: I guess she's not going to say anything to end the week off, hmm, oh well. Not like it's a big loss.  Legato nodded as the bell rang. Abunai waited until everyone had left, except for M.C., who quickly left after saying that she had to meet someone. Abunai, seeing no reason to stick around, asked the teacher to have a good weekend, and left, once more attached to Legato's hand. Turning to the left, Abunai muttered something about 'going out the back door' and led them down the hall, in the direction of her French class. When they were merely feet away from the door to the class, she turned once again, and then exited through a pair of glass doors. Walking across the small field that bore no paths, she turned to Legato.  Abunai: So, what did you learn today?  Legato thought for a moment. What had he learned?  Legato: I'm not sure, Master. It is true that I learned some things, but nothing of any importance.  Abunai sighed. Yes, as every other day. That was all right. It didn't bother her if Legato didn't learn anything. He was, after all, an adult. Oh, what was she talking about? He needn't learn anything, as long as he knew how to survive in this world.  Before she realized it, Abunai was already halfway home. She hugged Legato's side. Time was shortened when you had someone with you! She smiled as they walked the rest of the way to her house. She suddenly found herself wishing that someone could see Legato, besides the random otaku that were becoming more common, to show the world that she did have someone. Abunai sighed. It was such foolish thinking that would one day be the end of her.  Legato: Ano, on'nashujin?  Abunai giggled at the word and Legato nudged her in the side softly, smirking. Stifling her laughter, she inquired as to what he wanted.  Abunai: Yes, Le-chan? Something to ask of me?  It was she that smirked this time. Legato shifted uneasily for a moment before focusing on what seemed to be a very interesting tree.  Legato: In English today, while I was resting . . . I stray though came into my mind. Kirei . . . Was it you?  Abunai looked at him and blushed, for his gaze was now fully upon her.  Abunai: Yes, Legato, that was I. And what I said, I still adhere to. You are, indeed, kirei, Legato.  Giving him a random hug, she sprinted forward to her door, and entered her home. Legato looked after her with a kind smile upon his face. He was glad that this one particular person was his Mistress. Walking into the house, he shut the door behind him.  posted by Abunai at 2:12 AM

						      I'm sorry for the following expletiveness of this, but I’m pretty fucking mad.  Oh...My...God... Ok... It is 6:24 AM... I have not slept. I could not sleep. And guess what happens when my mother finds this out? Well, it's the summer, so I don't really have to go to sleep, so she doesn't get angry if I'm awake. But lately, she's in a really pissy mood. I think it's because of my room... *screams* DAMN HER! *another frustrated scream* As soon as she finds out I'm awake, she calls me. And what does she call me for? To find a hair tie. A...fucking...hair...tie... And she can't just have one of the hair ties I find for her, oh no, oh GOD no, you see, that's blasphemic. She makes me turn over the fucking couches, crawl on my knees, and look for a SPECIFIC hair tie. As she put it, 'My black hair tie that the fuckin' cat had! I put it on the table, and now it's gone!' And, of course, she can't look for it herself, oh no. She makes me do it. Answer me this, mother: You know the cat likes to play with the hair ties, why the HELL did you leave it out on the table!? HUH?! *screams again* So I find it for her. It was in her shoe. Then she has to smile and act all innocent like, as if she wasn't just yelling and screaming her head off at me, saying that it was my fault that it was missing. Nay, I say, it's her fault. She says that it's my fault, because it's my cat. But she's the one who left the hair tie out in the first place. ... Oh great, now she's yelling because I slammed the door. That was not slamming. That was angrily pushing it closed, but not slamming. If you want slamming, I'll make the house shake. I've done it before, I'll do it again. God, I hate her, I really, really do. Yet again I wonder why she has friends at all. Supposedly, she's all fun when she's out with them, but I, oh, I dunno, embarrass her because I am who I am, or something completely idiotic like that. Before, I was glad that she was already gone when I left for school, because she couldn't stop me from wearing what I wanted to, but I noticed that when I was going to summer school, and she had to take me with her to work first, it was always 'Take off your chains, why are you wearing those straps, can't you wear something besides black all the time?' Schließen Sie Ihr Gesicht, Dirne! And now, she's yelling at me again. She asked why I 'slammed' my door. I said because. 'Because? I'll show you BECAUSE! If your room is not clean when I get home, I'm turning off your fuckin' internet BECAUSE! If it's not clean, I'm sending you down to your dad's for the rest of the summer, BECAUSE!' Sie ist solch ein Weibchen. Ich hasse sie. Ich HASSE sie. People probably wonder how I could hate her, oh, it's easy. Très, très facile. You can ask my friends who have met her. Met her, met her, because if they've talked to her on the phone, then she's nice, and even funny, then. Mary knows. Apparently, laughing is forbidden when she sleeps. So, if only once our laughter would get a little loud, she'd storm into my room and yell/growl/speak, 'If you don't be quiet, I'm going to send Mary home...' 'But it's 1 AM, you can't...' 'Oh, believe me, I can, and I will...' Then she storms off and goes back into her room. The same room that she always compares to mine, somewhat. 'If I can keep my room clean, so can you.' Oh really? And she spends, what, maybe 3 hours tops in there awake, and the other time in there is when she's asleep, or laying on her bed. I, on the other hand, spend all of my day in my room. All of it. I leave to get food and use the bathroom, or sometimes I even go out with my friends, when my room is clean. And that's like... Once or twice a month. On average... Probably about once... So, of course it's going to get messy. Also, she won't get another phone. Another PORTABLE phone. I try to explain that I have a busy schedule, and I have more than one person to talk to, and usually, that involves the computer and phone at the same time. Therefore, I cannot be in the kitchen to talk to my friends. Plus, if one of my rare TV shows is on, I'll have to watch it, too. But she's usually on the couch, watching some stupid Law &amp; Order episode that I've seen twice, and I know she's seen because she made me watch them with her. But she can't let me change the channel, because she is ABSOLUTELY sure that she hasn't seen it, then I'll tell her the outcome, and she'll say 'oh yeah...' and change it to another station with the same exact show on it. If she's asleep, I can't change it, because she's either laying on the remote, or she'll magically wake up say scream 'I was watching that!' Tch. *yet another frustrated scream* I just don't understand why my room has to be clean! She's shown everyone the house, and she's always like 'Oh, you don't want to see in there, it's a disaster area...' ...You know what? It's just like the other room. Go straight down the hall, take a right at the very end and boom. You're at my room's theoretical clone. Theoretical because it doesn't have the same furnishings, and it smells like an old person's house in there because no one ever goes in there, and mother keeps her jars and crap like that in there. Plus, I have a bathroom to take care of. It's MY bathroom, supposedly, but everyone uses it. And no one puts the lid down, and mother cuts her bangs in there, and she brushes her hair, and primps, and yada yada yada, even though she has her own bathroom in her room to do all that crap in. I tell her that she's going to die sooner than most people, and yeah, I'll probably be sad and stuff. Whenever I tell her that she's going to die soon, she gives me this nasty look and I'm like, 'Hey, it's your fault and I was only trying to help you' because I usually say stuff like that after I talk about her smoking. I know that it's sounds like I hate her, and I do, don't get me wrong, but I'm only trying to protect her and myself from lung cancer. My friends who have heard me sing say that I have a good voice, but after I sing for like... Thirty minutes, my voice starts to die because I feel as if I have phlegm and crap in my lungs, because both her and my father have smoked all of my life. That's also another reason why I stay in my room. It's smells better, though she always has to comment on the way it smells. Well, it smells better than outside, because it smells like cigarettes, and crappy perfume, and aerosol air fresheners that make me want to hurl. I don't know why, but unnatural scents and smells usually make me want to vomit, and they nearly always give me a headache. *sighs* I have to go clean my room, or I won't have any contact to the outside world for the rest of the summer if I do not. *turns music up loud and begins to work*  Well, I think i shall write a lot today, for I have not written in...forever... I don't see the use of short posts... Anyway, so, I was supposed to go see Spiderman 2 today with everyone, but, alas, my room is not in top condition, I have no money, and no one was around to get money from. Also, I'm just lazy. On a brighter note... I drew Malcom, a character from one of my friends. He's a kitty-person!    urlLink   www.abunai-updates.blogspot.com      He's the kitty guy with bubbles surrounding him... Yeah, so... So... I also updated A Perfect Night's Dream, though, on which day I have no clue. As I said, the days just blend together. I was sure that I had updated here not just a day ago, but I come to find that it has been 4... It's sad how my brain doesn't work, isn't it? I still have made no progress on my room, and I was distracted yesterday by my old school papers, mostly from art class. As I was looking through those, I realized something: Wow, I really am better at drawing anime/manga things than I am at real stuff... 'Real stuff' does not exist to me. Well, maybe a little, but not in my art area. The more I look at the picture of Malcom, the more I get the impression that he's...high, or something... Or on an acid trip, but let us not get into that, shall we? U'n... As much as people say that I can draw well, I still see that I...can't... That's also sad. I wish I could improve, maybe go to a school, but I don't think that any of my art teachers have ever thought of Anime and Manga as art... Blasphemic fools that they are. I always see what I want to draw so clearly in my mind, but it never turns out the way that I want it. A while ago, I realized that my imagination was seemingly deterioratiing, and it kinda scared me that it would happen so soon. So, in order to grow up and continue to have my imagination, I think I've strayed a lot from TV. The only time I ever watch it is when [Adult Swim] is on, and sometimes when some show happens to catch my eye. Though I don't watch TV often, I still listen to music, and sometimes it inspires me... I guess... Ew... The Justice League is on... Stupid Marvel... *scowls* Give me anime, sheesh! I want to get Anime Network so very, very badly that it's not funny. *sighs and yawns* U'n... Anyway, today is [Adult Swim] Comedy! Yay! I wish they'd put Space Ghost Coast to Coast back on, but they cancelled it! Cancelled, after a ten year run. Damn them... I loved that show... It was so stupid and funny. And the Brak Show can't exactly fill in for it. More often than not, Brak is more stupid than funny. Aqua Teen Hunger Force is always classic. Baby Blues... No, I would gladly say goodbye to it. Mission Hill... Is okay... Well, it's 10 'o clock... Do you know where your brain is? I don't... Yay, Family Guy! I'm never tired of it... The fat kid episode. Heh. Lol. Damn you, Mop and Glo! Yay. Anyway, again. I'm kinda bored... Maybe I should draw? Damn you, ice cream! Come to my mouth... How dare you disobey me? *snore* Ah ha... Yeah. Maybe I should get into a rant. Those are always fun, right? So desu ne... Alright. What shall I rant about? What makes me angry... Suprisingly, nothing has really gotten on my nerves today... I want a guitar. Or a keyboard. I like music, so I want to make it... *sighs* Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata is so pretty... So very, very pretty... But,- OMG, did they just say that Harvey Birdman was CANCELLED?! WTF MAN!? Ok, ok! Now I have something to rant about! They keep cancelling all my favorite shows! It's stupid and blasphemic to me! Heh, emu... HA HA HA! Off-topic. I love Sea Lab 2021! Ha ha ha ha! I'ma go, Shay's on the phone and we're watching [Adult Swim]... Bye!  Well, I think I might turn the TV off and listen to some music. Du Hasst again... Hmm... Yeah... Let's see... I think I'll put my CDs on shuffle, but I'll take out Evanescence first... German should go with German, yes. So, E Nomine and Rammstein it is. Hmmm... Summer will soon be over... Kind of sucks, though... I hate school. But I love it too, it's a dilemma. *sighs* You know what? I should draw, or write, or do something productive with my life. Yet, as soon as I feel like I want to do something, I think to myself 'Naw, I'll just sit here and do nothing...' I have quite a pitiful life... Oh well... I want to clean my room as well... I actually started to clean yesterday... Or someday that was before today... I'm not sure anymore. I have a weird schedule, so things kind of run together. I'll find myself waking up at 3 PM or so, and going to bed at obscenely early hours... Or I'll actually go to bed at a decent time and wake up early, or late... Depends on my dream. If it's good, then hell, why not finish it? I'm starting to regret the whole 'phone in my room' thing. It's really annoying. I hate the phone. Hate it hate it hate it. It's one of the most annoying creations ever, however useful it may be. If it had a more soothing, less irritating sound to it, I might like it. But when your day consists of sleep, you don't like to hear 'BRING BRING BRING' an hour before you wake. Or at 2:32 AM. It makes me furious and I want to kill people for calling at such obscene hours. I mean, really. I have no choice but to sleep. Sleep is good for you. Sleep is bad for you, too. It's just like breathing. You have to do it, it's just not always healthy. I can't wait until my mother gets off her vacation. Get her out of the freaking house. Just because it's her vacation doesn't mean she has to do anything improving around the house. It's her choice, just as it is my choice to sleep the day away. It's my vacation, and, no, mother, I'm not going to spend it doing housework. Sleeping, eating, talking to my friends, and being on my computer are my 'vacation time' options. Stop making me do things for you. Ha ha, look at me, I sound so very cynical. Oh well... Though I suppose I should do something... useful... I don't have any kids to babysit, therefore no cash flow... And therefore nothing new to speak of. I think I'll take out my mangara, set them on the floor, and stare at them a while. Just for the hell of it. Because I'm bored, or something. I wish I could find that book that I've been looking for. It's annoying the crap out of me. I borrowed it from someone for so long that they just gave it to me, and now I can't find it... *sighs* I also wish that I could find Fruits Basket vol. 2... I have no idea where it went, and it makes me angry. Angry. Roar. I wish everyone would just get along. It makes me just... Furious... I wish that I could learn every language in the world so that I could understand everyones' side. Our society isn't as perfect as most perceive it to be, and other societies aren't as bad as everyone in our society sees them as. *sigh* I'm sick and tired of hearing such hate in the media, too. A song entitled 'This Is War' was playing the other day on my station on LAUNCHcast, and I thought that it sounded good. I was liking it until I heard 'I'll knock your door down and blow your fuckin' head in for my country'... It appalls me. And that jackass, what's his face country singer, 'We'll put a boot in yer ass.' Oh, go to hell, you chauvinistic pig. Really. I think it was Allan Jackson. Or whatever. And I think a Dixie Chick made fun of his song, and so he went around and bantered (though it wasn't the friendly type of bantering) her about as a bad person. Oh, come on now! If you sing a song about 'putting a boot up someone's ass', do think you'll not get a little disagreement from people about it? Huh? I'm sure that the song will give our country a good name. 'Oh, sure, sure! Everyone's free here, but if you question us, we'll shove our foots up your ass.' Hate... humans... they... should... die... (especially over-patriotic ones)  I swear, lights are playing tricks on me. I think that there are little...things...crawling around me... But it's just the sun... Damn you sun! Well, I'm out of school as of... Friday, the second of July... I passed my test in Summer school... Man, I should fail my classes more, John was right, that was fun! Now, I'm sitting in the middle of my floor, where the mess has spread from this central point like a viral infection in one who has a weak immune system. Papers are littering my floor, with empty coke bottles strewn about, along with bowls, chopsticks, and assorted types of pencils. And I can only think one thought; Ah, this is truly life. Though, my mom is pestering me about cleaning it. Hey, it's my room, and I live in it, so leave me alone. Jeeze. Anyway, my mom seems to like to take things that I don't 'use' anymore and give them to her friends... Man, she annoys me... And I, of course, don't have a lock on my door, so she thinks that she can just come in here and take whatever she pleases and rummage through all my things looking for 'something' that I have no clue of its whereabouts. So she makes me find it for her. A few weeks ago, I got a new internet (which sucks, it took three weeks just to set it up right), thus rendering my old modem useless. And so, she wants to take my old modem and give it to her friends. My response: Why can't they just buy their own damn modem, huh?! So I have to search my room, which is a disaster, for a freaking CD and a tiny little freaking book/guide thing! Urh! And she yells at me about it, of course. God, I just don't see why she has friends in the first place, or maybe they're all just idiots like her. I know Suzy is. I want to kill that woman. What my mother doesn't seem to understand is this; when she's old and decrepit, I'm the one who's going to take care of her. And guess what? Old folks home. Screw her. Just screw her. ... Oh great. Now she comes in and asks for masking tape. *twitches* Does she have to be such an idiot? I have no idea where I get my 'smart' genes from, because it's not from the person who fried his brain with meth or the one who joys in spending her time tormenting me. But I know that my life's not that bad, and I loath pity parties. So... So...

        You are a  PHOENIX  in your soul and your wings make a statement. Huge and born of flame, they burn with light and power and rebirth. Ashes fall from your wingtips. You are an amazingly strong person. You survive, even flourish in adversity and hardship. A firm believer in the phrase, 'Whatever doesn't kill you only makes you stronger,' you rarely fear failure. You know that any mistake you make will teach you more about yourself and allow you to 'rise from the ashes' as a still greater being. Because of this, you rarely make the same mistake twice, and are not among the most forgiving people. You're extremely powerful and wise, and are capable of fierce pride, passion, and anger. Perhaps you're this way because you were forced to survive a rough childhood. Or maybe you just have a strong grasp on reality and know that life is tough and the world is cruel, and it takes strength and independence to survive it. And independence is your strongest point - you may care for others, and even depend on them...but when it comes right down to it, the only one you need is yourself. Thus you trust your own intuition, and rely on a mind almost as brilliant as the fire of your wings to guide you.You are eternal and because you have a strong sense of who and what you are, no one can control your heart or mind, or even really influence your thinking. A symbol of rebirth and renewal, you tend to be a very spiritual person with a serious mind - never acting immature and harboring a superior disgust of those who do. Likewise, humanity's stupidity and tendency to want others to solve their problems for them frustrates you endlessly. Though you can be stubborn, outspoken, and haughty, I admire you greatly.    urlLink   *~*~*Claim Your Wings - Pics and Long Answers*~*~*     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      Abunai fidgeted underneath Legato's piercing gaze. He had quickly lost his look of shock and surprise, and was not about to skirt around the subject at hand; how Abunai already knew his name.  "I will ask you again," he said in a terse voice. "How do you you know who I am? I have never even met you before, and not too long ago, I was labeled as dead. Answer." Legato's tone was starting to wear at Abunai's nerves. 'Who does he think he is?' She thought angrily, 'And I saved him, too!'  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  'And I saved him, too!'  The thought rang through Legato's mind. She saved him? Why though? Examining her mind yielded no answers; her mind was one of the most guarded that he'd ever seen. It was almost as if she had prepared herself for circumstances such as this... He turned away from his musings to stare into her eyes. He didn't need to be a mind reader to know when someone was lying...  "Ok!" Abunai said in an exasperated voice. "Let's play twenty questions, alright?" "Twenty questions?" Legato asked, confused. He wasn't sure if he was on the same planet anymore... "Yeah, twenty questions. I ask you a question, then you ask me a question, and continue until we've each had ten questions each. But I think I will shorten it to Ten Questions... Understand?" Legato scoffed. "Of course I understand, I'm not a child." Abunai looked at him with a small frown adorning her face. "Do you want to go first?" Maybe if he was allowed to ask the first question, he would relax, Abunai mused. Legato looked down his nose at her for a moment before nodding.   "Fine. First question: Where are we?"  "Simple," Abunai stated. "We are on Earth."   Legato looked stunned. "Earth? We cannot be on Earth. It was abandon-"  "Now, now, it's my turn. Further questions will be allowed afterwards." The teen chided. "Okay, my turn," she stated softly. "Um..." Abunai's eyes wandered around, searching for a question. "How long did you work for Knives?"  Her question floated through the silence. 'So she knows about that too...' He thought suspiciously. Nevertheless, he would answer. "Most of my life, I suppose. As soon as it was found that I had powers, he came to me and asked for my services. Not that he would have let me refuse." Abunai's mouth formed a small 'o'. She had always wondered about that. She also knew what her next question would be.  Legato shifted slightly on his mat and once again looked Abunai in the eyes as he asked his question. "Why is Earth so...inhabitable? I thought that the humans had overtaxed it?"  "Hmmm..." She looked thoughtful for a moment before her expression brightened. "Well, I think that the entire SEEDS ordeal is actually in this Earth's future. On the other hand, it could be an Earth from an alternate reality. Though... If the humans don't realize that they are harming the planet, SEEDS could possibly be a not so far away future..." Her expression saddened once more. "I see..." Legato stated simply. "Your turn." Abunai nodded and proceeded to ask her question.  "You said that you have worked for Knives for most of your life, correct?" Legato nodded and she continued, "I'm assuming that it was most likely a long time... I assume that because of the left arm you now possess. I also know that arm once belonged to Vash. Yet, what I want to know is this: Is it prolonging your life?"  Legato remained silent. This girl knew more than she should... He was starting to feel like his life was some show to her. Though, in order for his questions to be answered, he had to answer hers. "In a way, I would say that it does allow me to live longer than other, normal people. Now, my turn." Legato smiled as he sat in a cross legged position and propped his elbow onto his knee so that he could rest his head on his hand. He was beginning to feel tired again. "How do you know so much about me?"  "Ah, so we come to that question at last. Truthfully, Legato-chan, um... I've been stalking you?" She grinned as she sensed his distrust. "You're lying," Legato stated in a firm tone. Abunai raised her hands in mock surrender. "Oh no, you've found me out!" She giggled slightly when he raised an eyebrow at her antics. "Ok, ok... Well, I guess it's the dreams..."  "Dreams?" He questioned. "Yeah... It's like some kind of movie that goes on in my head at random. I was confused at first, I mean, I can have some very farfetched dreams, but never without me in them." Abunai grinned as she looked up at him. "I must say, you've done some twisted things, mister." She laughed softly. "But I digress... I began to 'follow' you around in the dreams. You were intriguing, so I would often be around you whenever you traveled. You couldn't see me though... So, that's how I know so much about you."  "I see..." He mused thoughtfully. He hadn't heard of having a dream of someone's life before... Much less living some of it with them... "Your turn," he remarked offhandedly, too engrossed with the information he had just received. "Aha!" Abunai said cheerfully. "What to ask, what to ask..." She placed a finger to her chin in a thoughtful manner. "Oh yes... Was Knives the one who put you up to making Vash kill you?" She asked with a slightly vehement tone. Legato snapped out of his reverie and looked at her. "Yes, he asked me to do it... Yet, I was the one who came up with the idea." His eyes shifted as he began to think of other things, thinking that she had accepted his answer. Now he needed to think of a question of his own.  "Why...?" Abunai asked in a soft voice. "Why what?" Legato sounded slightly perturbed because of the interruption. "Why did you come up with that idea? You knew it would result in you death, didn't you?" Her voice was barely above a whisper, but he had no problem making out her words. "I was tired..." He shrugged it off as if it were nothing. "I wanted to rest, to not hear voices, just to sleep..." Abunai looked saddened at his words. "And you would go so far as to kill yourself?" After a pause, Legato nodded. "Oh, it is my turn, is it not?" He asked, seemingly unfazed by Abunai's now gloomy expression. "I've been meaning to ask you, why am I alive? I know that Vash killed me, so why am I here?"  Abunai looked at him before standing and kneeling next to him. Even though she seemed depressed by his thoughts of ending his life, she exuded a feeling of peacefulness that he was comforted by. "You're here... You're alive because..." Her face was covered in shadow despite the sun's attempt to spread light upon it from the window. "I didn't want my dream to end, either." Abunai leaned against him in a tired manner and closed her eyes. Legato was stunned yet again, and silence reigned throughout the house.

      Legato smiled as he stared down the barrel of Vash's gun, waiting for him to pull the trigger... Telling Vash to pull the trigger... Legato knew that he would, for Vash's precious companions were being threatened. Or would Vash sacrifice their lives so that he could keep his so called 'clean' slate spot-free...?   Vash was a fool, bantering on and on about never killing a soul, when he was indeed at fault. He may not have killed anyone intentionally, but after every city he destroyed, people were left homeless and devoid of food, of shelter, of peace. Filled with madness they would kill each other off, fighting for scraps like stray dogs in an alley.  How Legato hated this wretched planet.  So here he was, commanding Vash to pull the trigger on his gun. Vash's trigger finger twitched as one of his companions screamed, and Legato could see tears welling up in Vash's aquamarine eyes.  'Fool,' Legato prodded into Vash's mind. 'Why don't you just kill me and end this? You know you want to...' Vash made a small noise as another cry of pain came from his friends. Legato could see his resilience slipping every second. 'Yes, that's it Vash. You want them to live, don't you? Come on... It's not so bad, killing someone...' Vash's mind rang with Legato's laughter and he snapped. "NO!" He cried just as his finger slipped and the gun rang out.  Legato's last thought lingered on in Vash's mind...  'I'm finally free of them...'  Legato's lifeless body slumped to the ground as tears fell from Vash's eyes...   ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~   'I feel so warm...' Legato thought sleepily. It was not often that he had the chance to sleep, and to sleep so blissfully was a rare occurrence indeed. He stretched and yawned as he rubbed his eyes. Suddenly, he froze.  'Why... Why am I alive?!' His mind was panicking. He had failed his mission! Vash must have had the will to move the gun, and it must have only grazed him... Maybe he had just been knocked out... No... It wasn't so... It couldn't be... He had felt the bullet hit him, had saw it coming... Time had slowed, he was sure of it...  Then, why was he here, alive?  Light flashed into his eyes from an open window, and he shielded them from its brilliance. Having two suns really was annoying sometimes... Yet, this light was not as intense as he had imagined it, and why was it so... green, outside? Legato stood and realized that he was previously laying on a bed. 'I must have been too shocked to realize it,' he deduced. 'It's been a while since I have slept in a bed.'  Legato yawned as he shuffled over to the open window. A gentle breeze blew by and lifted the curtains, the newly revealed view they concealed astonishing him. Plants... He leaned against the sill and looked all about him. 'There are plants everywhere...' He had never before seen the like. He knew that there were Geo Plants scattered over Gunsmoke, but none as large as this one. It seemed to never end...  He could hear the birds chirping and see other creatures he had never laid eyes upon scurrying about. Three large trees lay before the window, covering the ground and Legato in greens and whites that danced about in the breeze. Legato's only thought was, 'Beautiful.' He smiled as the soft beams hit his face. He closed his eyes and basked in the light, being for once in his life at peace with his surroundings.  "Ah... So you're awake at last. I thought I heard you earlier," said a soft voice from the door. Legato pivoted around wildly to see who had disturbed him. 'No,' he thought. 'I don't want this dream to end...' He rarely had such peaceful moments, and he didn't quite want this one to cease yet. His eyes widened at the sight before him.  A young girl stood, leaning against the door's frame. She carried a tray in her hands that had an assortment of food upon it. Her blue-green eyes sparkled and danced with slight amusement as he studied her. Light blonde hair was pulled back in a loose ponytail that was resting over her shoulder in a careless way. If she were not leaning against the frame, the top of her head would have reached just past his chin, and she looked for all the world to be sixteen or seventeen years of age. She laughed softly as she sat the tray on a low table to the side of room.  "I made you breakfast... I hope you're hungry, I prepared a lot. It was just too fun to cook for more than just me for a change, I guess." She smiled and scratched the back of her neck in a slightly embarrassed way. "Anyway... Good morning." Smiling brightly, she sat the table as Legato looked on.  She didn't seem worried in the least that he was there, in fact, she had made a meal for him. 'I might as well make the best of this situation...' he thought idly. 'She may even be able to answer my questions, she seems nice enough to help... I am kind of hungry, too...' Legato smiled as he kneeled next to the short table. There were no chairs, so he took his place upon a soft mat in front of it. The girl sat across from him on a similar mat. 'I wonder who she is...'  "Oh my!" she suddenly exclaimed. "You don't know who I am, do you?" She beamed him a bright smile and gave a short bow. "I'm very pleased to meet you, my name is Abunai Mori." She held out her hand, which he gingerly took. "It is also nice to meet you as well, Abunai. I am-"  "Legato Bluesummers, I know!" She grinned slightly and gave his hand a nice shake. "I know all about you, Legato-chan, and believe it or not, I've been waiting..."  The fork he was holding in his other hand clattered to the plate where his now forgotten food lay.  "How did you..." His words ceased as a wave of confusion overwhelmed him. "How..."  "Let's just say that it's for me to know and for you to find out, Legato-chan." Abunai smiled brightly once again as Legato faced her happy visage with confusion and shock written over his own.

      Legato sat in silence, with Abunai leaned against him. She must have been asleep. His mind was once again dwelling over all that had happened in the short span of time since he had awoken.   'She didn't want her dream to end?' Legato was confused. Those words were nearly his own, he had thought the same thing when he first heard Abunai walk into the room. 'If I had died... Her dream would have ended as well... Maybe...' No, that was preposterous. He couldn't be dreaming her up, he was dead. Or he was alive. Either way, it was not plausible.  The figure beside him stirred a bit, and he was drawn out of his musings. "Le...Legato? Where are you?" Her mind must have still been clouded with sleep, for he was right there. "You weren't in my dream... Vash shot you..." Her voice sounded tearful, so he spoke up. "Abunai, I'm right here. You are not sleeping any longer." Abunai turned towards him and her eyes widened. "Legato-chan!" Legato almost jumped when she attached herself to his arm, acting as a child would to a favorite stuffed animal. "Uh..." Legato said in a very uneloquent manner. "What are you doing?"   Abunai looked up at him, and said in a small voice, "Oops... I'm sorry, it's just that..." She stopped and moved away from him slightly. "Nevermind, it's not important." Moving to stand up, she was stopped by his hand on her arm. "It's just what, Abunai?" She looked at him in a strange way, but sat back down. "When I sleep, you are always there, you know? Yet, when I was asleep just a minute ago... You were not there, and it...it frightened me... When I awoke, I saw you and... I just had to..." Abunai sighed and looked away. "Like I said, it's not important."  A voice floated in from just outside the room. "Kei-san! Did you fall back to sleep? You know that sleeping during the middle of the day is bad for you!" Abunai groaned and covered her face with her hands. "I hope he's wearing something...normal, this time..." Legato looked toward the door with a slightly puzzled expression on his face.  A young man with light brown hair and ice blue eyes walked through the door, carrying another tray of food. "Kei-san, I made brownies! I thought maybe you'd like some..." He seemed to spy Legato at that moment. "Well, you're a new face!" He smiled happily and offered the tray to Legato. "Brownie?" Abunai sighed in exasperation. "Val... What the heck are you wearing?" Val smiled again. "It's an apron! It's to keep food from getting on your clothes when you cook. Do you like it?" "Val... That was a somewhat rhetorical question... I know what it is, but why are you wearing it?" He looked unabashed as he said, "I was cooking! Would you like a brownie?" Val seemed almost anxious for one of them to eat his creation.  "Um... Sure, Val..." Abunai tentatively picked up a brownie as Val fervently looked on. She took a bite and smiled, "It's good, Val." He looked overjoyed. "Would you like one as well... Um... What is your name?" Val gestured towards Legato with an oven-mitt clad hand while Legato looked at him. "I am known as Legato Bluesummers, and I suppose you go by Val, correct?" Val grinned, "Yes! Also by Nox, I don't know why, though..." "I see..." Legato said quietly. "And why did you call Abunai 'Kei-san'?" Val looked thoughtful. "Oh, I dunno... Everyone else does for some reason, so I just did too..." He shrugged and walked away.  "Well..." Abunai said with a sigh. "I guess I'll show you around the house..." Legato nodded, it sounded like a good idea. He stood and looked down. Abunai did not move, and she was staring out the window. The bright light that once filtered through was now a hazy orange color, though. "Abunai..." Legato said softly. Still, she did not stir. 'Lost in her own reverie, I assume...' He thought. 'I think I'll try something different this time.' He smiled and tapped her shoulder. "Kei-san, you were going to show me around, right?" Abunai's head snapped up and she looked at him. "I suppose, alright then." Legato reached down a hand, intending for her to take it. She smiled and gently put her hand in his. "Thanks, you're a lot nicer than some of the others around here." Legato lifted her to her feet. "Others?" He questioned. "Oh, yes, of course! There are a lot of people here, most of them are off doing their own thing, though." "Ah..." Legato intoned and wondered how many other people there were.  "Oh, I lost count long ago!" Abunai smiled and pulled Legato out of the room. He was bewildered yet again.

      Legato followed Abunai out of the door. Rather, he was pulled slightly. Going down the corridor, they would often pass people at random intervals. Each passerby would greet Abunai in a cheerful manner, but some wouldn't, and only afford to her a look. Some ignored them completely.  Arriving in what looked to be the main room in Abunai's home, Legato saw a few people lounging on the couches, or laying on what seemed to be very squishy bags in front of an arrangement of lost technology. Two of which seemed to be fervently punching buttons on some sort of hand held devices that were connected to another piece of technology. Their eyes were glued to the screen and what looked to be a battle was playing on it.  Abunai smiled as she let go of Legato's hand and sat down on one of the couches. The young man whom she sat next to moved over slightly to give her room. Abunai grinned as she said, "What's up, Sieg-chan!" The person now identified as Sieg inclined his head to the pair that were on the floor in front of the TV. "Oh, nothing much, Kei-san. I'm just watching those two idiots play their games."  "I see..." She stated slowly. "Kyo-kun, Yuki-kun! Who's winning?" The seemingly infuriated red-head yelled back at her, "The damn mouse, of course!" Kyo growled lowly, "But he's cheating!" The lavender haired other did not seemed fazed as he quipped, "I'm not cheating, you stupid cat, you just suck at this game." His blase attitude only added fuel to Kyo's fire, and the angry cat jumped up without warning. "Let's take this outside, kuso nezumi!" Kyo shouted at the seated Yuki.  The mouse did not look up at him, instead he stated calmly, "I win." Kyo whipped his head toward the screen that was flashing Winner! 2P! Kyo dropped back into the bean bag defeatedly. "Best two out of three?" Yuki offered. Kyo snatched up the controller. "You're on!" He challenged, and the two began another game.  "Well..." Legato said slowly, "This is a very lively place." He watched as two more of the house's occupants passed him, talking about 'alchemy'. Strange, though. One was wearing a suit of armor, while the other was very short.  "Don't let him hear that." Legato jumped slightly from his reclined position against the wall. "Ke-Kei-san! I didn't hear you walk over. Ah... What was that?" Slightly flustered, Legato inquired as to what she meant. "The one who just walked by, you know..." She leaned in conspiratorially. "Don't let him hear you call him short."  "WHAT WAS THAT!?" A voice shouted from where the two had left. "Oh, no..." Abunai covered her face with her hand, "How does he hear so well?" Another frantic voice shouted to the accompaniment of angry feet running over the floor. "Nii-san! Wait! You know she didn't mean it!" The young blonde rushed in, and almost into Abunai. "WHO'S TINY AS A GRAIN OF SAND AND YOU NEED A MICROSCOPE TO SEE?!" Abunai put her hands up in a disarming manner.  "Edo, Edo! Calm down! I was just warning our new guest about not saying..." She looked at Edward's fuming face. "Well, you know..." Edward growled lowly and nodded. 'Oh, great. He's a beanpole...' He thought, looking at Legato. Huffing, he asked, "Who's he?" He glared at Legato.  Abunai smiled in an attempt to cool off Edward's hot head. "He's Legato. He arrived Earlier today, Edo-kun. Legato, this is Edward and Alphonse Elric." Edward eyed Legato warily. "Is he staying?" "Nii-san! Don't be rude!" Alphonse interjected. Abunai smiled and looked thoughtful. "It's ok, Aru-chan. He can ask, but..." Abunai hummed. "I do not know. That's up to Legato." She said.  Legato looked at the three of them and shrugged in a neutral way. "It doesn't matter. I'm dead, anyway." He looked outside of the glass double doors to a flowering tree. "I can't go back..." A lone pink blossom floated from the tree and softly hit the ground. 'There's no way I could go back, the dead do not walk among the living...' At this thought, he felt very lonely, but he thought, idly, that maybe, just maybe, here... He would find a place to be.  As the two Elric brothers walked away, Edward muttering something about 'research' before leaving, Abunai again took Legato's hand. Leading him away to a door, she opened it and they walked outside. The sun had just set, and there was a pinkish glow over the horizon. She lead him down a path, and into the middle of the three trees that he had seen earlier.  "I noticed how you were staring at the trees..." She looked up at him. "Gunsmoke was very barren, so they surprised you, yes?" Legato nodded. "It was very beautiful to see." He stated as he watched Abunai walk over to a tree and sit against it. Looking to his left, he decided to do the same. Settling down, he noted that it was quite comfortable. In the past, he never had time to relax like this. It was a nice feeling.  "The stars are coming out..." Abunai said as she looked to the sky, "The moon, too. It's full." Legato looked at said moon. "You only have one moon?" Abunai nodded. "Yes. There is only one sun, as well." Legato's eyes continued to scan the heavens. They sat in silence. "It's nice here." "Yes, it is."  "Indeed." Abunai's head snapped up to look into her tree's branches. "Dae! What are you doing up there?" She smiled as she said this. 'Dae?' Thought Legato.  A shadowy figure dropped from the tree, landing in a swirl of black cloth and... 'Wings?' Legato's mind questioned. "It is always pleasant to see new faces here." The stranger named Dae intoned. "Well, then..." He bowed slightly to Legato. "I am Daemeon Rothchilde the Third. It is a genuine pleasure to meet you..." Daemeon held out his hand to Legato. Taking the offered hand, Legato answered, "I am Legato Bluesummers. It is also nice to meet you, Daemeon."  Abunai clapped her hands together. "Now that everyone is introduced, shall we go inside?" Her ever present smile was back in place. "I'm sure you are tired from your latest journey, Dae-chan." Dae gave a small smirk in return to her smile. "Assuredly, Kei-san." He stretched his arms, and his vast wings moved with them. "It's always nice to rest at home after a hunt."  "Hunt?" Legato inquired. "Oh, yes." Dae answered. "I-" Abunai gave him a pointed look. "I'll tell you later..." He said sheepishly. Walking to the door, Abunai opened it and allowed them inside before walking in herself, and shutting the door behind her.
