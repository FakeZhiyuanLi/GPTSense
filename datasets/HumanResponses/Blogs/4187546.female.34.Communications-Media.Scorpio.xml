      I was informed that no one could make comments on my blog entries. That's been fixed. Not that I write anything that demands comments, mind you.  But ...  If you wanted to ...  It's there.

      There are two things that frustrate the crap out of me: waiting too long for stoplights and waiting too long for people to get assignments back to me.  The stoplight issue has been life-long. Evidently my parents broke a lot of minor traffic laws when I was a child in an effort to avoid the squeals of frustration that would come out of my mouth whenever we’d stop for too long.  I’m not sure exactly how long is too long at a stoplight, I’ve never timed myself before my feet start tapping and I start grousing about the light just sitting there, all stupid and red, mocking me.  As far as waiting too long for people to get assignments to me … well, it’s been developing over years.   Call me nutty, but I think that six hours is plenty of time to get six tab pages proofed and returned. An hour a page, that’s all. Yeah, I would have liked to have the proofs back earlier … but after reminding people that I, too, have work to do I got my proofs.  It only took 15 minutes.  Maybe it’s the nature of the business that I’m in. The paper carrier who drops the newspaper on the driveway of the guy who works in the bank is probably the last hand in the process of creating my particular item for consumption. But before the carrier delivers the paper everyone in this building (and some out of it) depends on someone before him to get his particular step in the process out of the way. It’s one long chain and I’ve got a weak link.  I know I’m impatient. I’m not irritating about it. I don’t take my impatience out on other people; I just simmer a bit. The thing is, I sort of understand why people sit on tasks. I was a bad student during my student days, procrastinating to the point I thought that maybe teachers would forget that they gave me a homework assignment.  Yeah, I was quite the silly git — still am in some ways.  But now, I just get it done. Get it done, have it done, be done with it. It’s so much better this way.  Now, how can I get some more disciples to the Church of Get It Done? Weak links are making me cranky.

      The boyfriend is coming to town and for some reason, I have been having the urge to take him to do something a bit more “touristy” than our normal fare of shopping at Trader Joe’s and having late breakfasts at The Omelet House.  (Not knocking The Omelet House. If you ever get a chance to visit it in Las Vegas, please, stop in. They have omelets the size of your head. Really. And they’re delish. And the atmosphere is … well, it’s kind of like grandma’s house — if grandma lives in Vegas.)  The sad thing is that I, the  tourism edition editor , cannot think of anything to do. I look at show guides and restaurant reviews every day and I can’t think of anything to do. You would think that I’d have a wealth of options at my fingertips, but I’m blank.  I’ll just take today’s edition home and let him sort through it for something to entertain the two of us.  Yeah, I know. Nothing earth shattering to report. Nothing snarky. What can I say? I’m sleepy and waiting for his plane to arrive.

      When I was in high school (way back in the day) I and other of my more creative, yet socially outcast friends read a book by Daniel Pinkwater called, “Young Adult Novel.” It changed our little lives.  One of these days I’ll explain the book, but for now I’ll just give two points: (A) The protagonists of the book had an organization known as “The Wild Dada Ducks” and we copied them down to the last detail that we could (ah, those were the days). (B) One of the major aspects of “The Wild Dada Ducks” was the Kevin Shapiro: Boy Orphan story.  (Perhaps I should say “stories” as they were many.) We adopted Kevin and loved him. … and usually killed him in highly humorous ways. (Again, this is one of those things that I’m going to explain some other time, just understand that Kevin was horribly abused by whoever was writing the story, and often came out in a bad way — like, dead, eaten by weasels, that kind of thing.)  Whenever I get myself into a state where I can’t think of anything to write … say, like … today … I sit down and compose a Kevin Shapiro story.   Kevin Shapiro, Boy Orphan Chapter 87   Kevin woke up in a cold sweat.  Did Natasha suspect him of indiscretions during the lonely hours when she would take in tennis instructions from Helga, the 12-toed tennis pro at the club? Did she know anything of the shame that Kevin felt oozing from his pores like Sunday morning tequila-sweat after a Saturday night at The Pescado Loco?  Kevin didn’t think so. He had kept Rebecca as his one, true secret.  He had never intended for things to go so far. Really it was only a simple matter of coincidence … of timing … of chemistry.   He had hit Rebecca with his car. He did feel guilty, at first. But, as he nursed her back to health, he fell for her … hard.   It was so easy to stare into her big, brown eyes,  to listen to her chatter away about nothing in particular, to admire the obsessive/compulsive way that she washed her food before eating it. Oh, she was a delight!  It was only after that damned raccoon bit him on the wrist that he became really nervous.  What about rabies? What about roundworm? Distemper? What about AIDS?  Oh, Kevin was really stupid.  But, he was bringing us down, so we dropped a crate of bananas on his head to put him out of his misery.

      The rush to get everything done for the rest of the weekend and into next Monday started a bit early for me (thus nothing from yesterday, and not much from today), and I did so want to yammer on and on about Kerry’s and Bush’s respective visits to town.  A friend of mine wrote me one of those “I don’t have time to write an email right now, but let me get this one thing done and then I’ll write a nice, long email to you” kind of emails. You know what happens next. No other email. I’m not complaining. I find it more amusing than anything.

      The day began with me out of focus. I blame the heat. At 12:45 p.m. today it’s 104°F (40°C) and it’s supposed to get hotter. It’s hard to be motivated to work today. Luckily I work ahead and could give myself a little break.  I’ve been listening to Adagio for Strings, Op. 11 by Samuel Barber … yeah, I know. That’s an odd work to listen to, it being the big mourning soundtrack for every presidential funeral and every war dead scene on PBS or on sentimental movies.  But it’s cool. Not cool as in “hip and happenin’” — it’s a piece of music that sounds like a cool, quiet, watery place. (I’m going to have to start listening to more stuff by Barber.)  What got me started on this, strangely enough, was an NPR interview with DJ Tiesto about his plan for the 90-minute set he’ll do during the opening ceremonies of the Olympics. He’s sampled the Adagio, synthesized it, and revved it up to a sports/dance beat. And it’s not bad. It’s an odd choice, especially for an event that’s supposed to be so celebratory instead of somber, but it kinda works. Maybe it is “hip and happenin’” cool.  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+   Plans for the weekend   Ah, it looks like I’ll be taking a trip to Bryce Canyon National Park this weekend. I’ve had enough of the heat. I’ve booked a room at the lodge, and I’m just going to go. I just want to be able to sit outside and smell trees and cool air.  +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+   News of the day   Is Porter Goss a huge Bush suck-up, or does he know something that we don’t?  The guy’s been defending W. for months on all things intelligence-related. During the Joseph Wilson-Valerie Plame scandal he said the exposure of an undercover agent’s identity wasn’t a form of political retaliation against her and her husband and that there was no evidence of “willful disclosure” — which I think was pretty clear at the time. You would think that a guy who was a former CIA agent would … well, would at least keep quiet on the issue.  But, no. Time and time again he leaps up to defend Bush. Goss is a perfect guy (from Bush’s point of view) to take over George Tenet’s position as CIA director. He’s extremely loyal to Bush, and he’s very much for a strong, active, in-your-face kind of CIA. Goss is also the worst guy (from the Democrats’ point of view) to ally himself with the president. He’s extremely loyal to Bush, and he’s very much for a strong, active, in-your-face kind of CIA. (Yes, that was a repeat.)  I’m reading a lot of opinions on Goss that say he’s too “political” for the position.  And, I do think that intelligence and politics never coalesce (hold for polite laughter).   I’m not saying that the CIA director should be someone at odds with the commander in chief. Certainly, the two should trust and understand each other. One of these guys should not be the lapdog of the other, though.  Thing is, the Senate committee that would have to confirm Goss’ nomination couldn’t do so before November. After November his nomination might be a moot point, as Kerry wouldn’t keep him. The timing is weird. Is Bush trying to look like he’s taking one of those “proactive” stances he likes to take where he offers a fairly hollow solution to a problem? Is Goss toadying himself to Bush in a pre-election push, hoping for a win and a better position for himself?  This always gives me a bit of a queasy feeling.

      Is it very wrong of me to watch the Obama/Keyes race with so much interest? Springfield is over 1,000 miles away from Las Vegas, but … it’s such a soap opera.  This is the first time that two major party African American candidates are running against each other, and I find it intriguing that Keyes appears to be trying to make himself more black than Obama, what with the whole “slaveholder’s” comment.   "I would still be picking cotton if the country's moral principles had not been shaped by the Declaration of Independence," Keyes said. He said Obama "has broken and rejected those principles — he has taken the slaveholder's position."   Which sounds like rhetoric, but not insane rhetoric (OK, not insane if you ignore the fact that Obama  *a-hem*   is black). No, the comment takes on a surreal twist when you understand that the principles that Keyes was talking about dealt with abortion.  Obama has taken the slaveholder’s position on abortion.  Um, wouldn’t the slaveholder be anti-abortion? I mean, hey, more slaves.  And remember what a stink Keyes raised when Hilary Clinton ran for Senate in New York? Now he’s being commonly called a “carpetbagger.”  Today I read a little bit of the online version of  The Southern Illinosian  (a paper I was invited to work for, but didn’t). There was a Q&A segment that included his answer to the whole Maryland/Illinois issue.   ”I think that folks here who believe as I do will join with me because at one level we are part of the same community because we share a community of values, a community of beliefs that makes us one people.”   I expect much better speechifying from Keyes. That comment doesn’t even make sense. How can you have community of beliefs? But, if you ignore that, what he’s basically saying is that the people who agree with him will agree with him.  And the newspapers that are made out of wood pulp are made out of wood pulp. And the kittens that meow make meowing noises.  Hardliner Republicans will vote for Keyes, there’s no doubt. But I tend to think that any moderate would wonder about how much Keyes  really  cares about Illinois and it’s other residents, you know, the ones who have lived there for longer than 90 days.  Also, as a friend of mine pointed out, Illinois is divided pretty much into two parts: Chicago and the rest of Illinois. Chicago, with all it’s alleged machinery and alleged corruption is fairly solidly Democratic. The rest of Illinois is pretty much rural, conservative and white. I’m thinking the only advantage Keyes really will have there will be that he’s got a more “regular”-sounding name.

       A friend of mine and I were passing emails back and forth across the Atlantic Ocean and discussing “geeks.”  Now, “geek,” has two basic definitions. The first is a two-parter: 1. A person regarded as foolish, inept, or clumsy. -or- 2. A person who is single-minded or accomplished in scientific or technical pursuits but is felt to be socially inept.  The second is the one I remember from my childhood: 1. A carnival performer whose show consists of bizarre acts, such as biting the head off a live chicken.  Needless to say, I’ve adopted the first definition as my own. I’m not really a geek, to be honest, because I’m not focused enough, and I am socially adept.  But geeks, you see, want to find out how things work. They want to break down components of … whatever they’re investigating … into the most basic parts.  My boyfriend (who has some geekish tendencies, but who is also not a geek) has become quite the coffee authority over the last few years. It started with an article about roasting coffee. Then there was a book. Then he decided to buy a home roaster, and with that came the Internet searches for green coffee to roast. Along the way he’s learned quite a bit about varieties and processes. And, he makes the best cup of coffee I’ve ever had (and I used to be addicted to Jamaican Blue, so that’s saying something).  Getting back to the trans-Atlantic emails — we started mulling over what the opposite of geekish tendencies might be, and came up with Zen Buddhism.  “Zen”: 1. A school of Mahayana Buddhism that asserts that enlightenment can be attained through meditation, self-contemplation, and intuition rather than through faith and devotion.  OK, so it might not work entirely; but where the geek is active, the Zen master is introspective; where the geek wants to find out how something works, the Zen master wants to … ignore it.  My friend and I decided that we’re much closer to “geek” on the whole “geek-Zen” continuum. Then he stated, “Zen is irritating.”  And I shortened it.  I think it works for those of us who have a less spiritual mindset.
