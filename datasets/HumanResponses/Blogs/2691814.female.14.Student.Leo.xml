						   well...i went to school today feeling miserable. But seeing everyone kinda cheered me up a bit. In chorus we got into our groups to sing and our group did the best we've ever done. But anyway, Something kinda took me by suprise during 5th in mr.hunt's class. But I'm not telling cuz Its really not my place to say. Um...lets see went to SAA and we did very well. We had a different judge than expected which didn't really matter cuz I hadn't even met the expected judge. Grandpa and Michelle are at dinner with dad. I haven't gotten to see them cuz i was performing. We're dog sitting Hershey lol. Right now she's just plopped down sleeping. From what I've heard Pangy and Hershey actually remembered eachother lol. The cat's just hanging out with me like usual lol.  Oh ya just wanna say hi to Ryan...i know he'll be reading this lol. Well I have another headache so I'll post tomarrow so bye.

						   well..i stayed home today feeling worse than yesterday. I had a terrible headache. Dad and I went to this PGA golf thing...we saw Paul H.(a friend of the family's)We found out that he has a new golf course in...TOKYO! i am dead serious!..Yatsuki (i think)...but he still has a house in Hilton Head. He used to be a trick shot golfer. He visited my dads golf course in WV and my Grandpa's golf course many times before that. I think I might have to fake sing tomarrow lol...I literally can't sing nothing comes out of my mouth lol. I mean, I was on the phone talkin to deidra and she was asking if i was going to SAA thing tomarrow cuz i didnt sound like i normally do...i don't have a raspy voice.    I went to Dr.Phillips High School tonight for the VPA magnet thing. The school is awesome they have 2 dance studios!This guy performed and he was amazing. He was singing and acting and he was just...like holy cow. The dance magnet program focuses on ballet and modern which is great. When i audition i have to perform a dance already taught by the teachers and then i get todo a 1min. dance of my own choreography of any dance form. yay...modern or...hip hop still deciding. But anyway..big day tomarrow and im still drowsy so i'll post tomarrow after my performance.

						   well...im stayin home tomarrow. which is good so i can rest some more. Probably going to do my stupid poetry assignments *ugh* hey em-ewww the SQUID yuck omg i totally was like about to faint when we had to disect that thing. The whole time Brandon was like 'dare ya to pick it up' ewww...like hell no lol.  But anyway...not much atall has been going on atall lately just watching Angel. I never really watch it but i just decided to. Ya know what...i think i've become a school bookworm this year...i care way too much about school..ppl even ask me to help them with hw! That is like waaaay freaky...That should never happen I mean last year i could care less about school...All i wanted to do was go to the movies,hang out with friends,or just do other stuff. No one here knows that tho.  I don't care tho...I should do school work and stuff but anyway I'm tired so im gonna go to sleep.

						   hey im sick so I'm stayin home today. Not much going on tho i am missing practice,Big 25, and a History test today lol. Oh well...I'll make it all up like I usualy do. I really think Ryan gave me his cold since he came back to school the other day. Also one of my other friends had pink eye yester day and i am very scared cuz i've had that 2wice in my life. Illnesses are just attracted to me i guess lol. I'm always sick or something. Always need to go to the hospital or get a shot or something. But anyway, yesterday at chorus we were practicing infront of mrs.brown and we did so much better than ever before! yay for us. Lets see....Friday-SAA and grandparents coming and Saturday-going to the golf thing at the convention center.(My family is big on golf...not me even tho i was told i have a very strong hitting arm lol) ya dad taught me and my brother how to play but I think my brother picked it up more since he's been in tournoments(can't spell) I don't care for it. But anyway I guess i'll post later if im not asleep or throwing up lol.

						       SAA is coming up soon. We all got into 3 groups and we have to sing for a judge that will be looking at posture and just about everything in a 'musician.' Anyway, alla the other groups get songs that actually have great harmonies and sound cool but our song is more classical and not fun atall to sing. 'Oh its just so beautiful'mrs brown would say to us. Bull crap, first of all its in a different language that no one in the group knows and 2ndly I just hate the song lol. And on friday i have to wear my frikkin dress the whole day! I really don't want to plus I have to miss 6th which would be alright if it weren't my favorite class! I so do not want to go to this thing.     Anyway nothing has really been going on. Just the usual Jeremy being a complete Dumba** and Francesca got back from California today. She said she got grounded or something but she wont tell me why>i really don't care anyway. I've been kinda down lately..not quite sure why, just something feels wrong. I felt like I was going crazy last night cuz i kept waking up with my eyes WIDE open. I didn't understand lol.     Grandparents are coming on Friday which yes, is my SAA day. Ijust hope they wont talk about PaPaw the whole time....i feel so uncomfortable around my family when they talk about him. I'm still sad about last year and him dying.(it just really made me crappy feeling) still does when i think of him. Man, now i feel like cryin.

						   well...today nothing has happend so far but last night was pretty cool. I went to deidras party and had a blast lol. Thalia was there too and we talked and stuff and danced around and entertained some of the little kids (neighbors and cousins) that were there. I got tons of pictures of deidra opening presents, blowing out the candels, and just hanging out. OMG her mom got her shania twain concert tickets! (I got so many pictures when she opend the card that they were in. she was soo shocked lol. One of the funny parts that me and thalia thought were hullairus was when the phone rang,now they have many antiques around the house but a normal black phone so dee's aunt goes up to one of the really old phones, picks it up and says hellllo? and she just didn't get it she was like...hello..hello? lmao everyone knew it was the other phone but i don't know it was just so funny. After the party me and deidra went to Old Town which was fun. I rode a rollercoaster lol....It wasn't that bad..it just had a few drops that kinda made me freaked out. I think I've overcome my fear of rollercoasters actually. Just as long as they have no loops. well...I guess I'll post again later if i have a chance.

						   today was terrible....went to school. Today was deidras "school birthday" we sang the b-day song 2wice but not in chorus when your supposed to. Almost everyone canceled on her execpt me Thalia and someone else but i just feel real bad for her right now,she was actually gonna cancel her party but she wasn't aloud for some reason. Anyway we went to another party tonight to say goodbye to Tia cuz she's leavin for Maryland. By the way that place sucked! alla the preps were there and me deidra and keith just walked around and stuff. I didn't really know what todo cuz i haven't been to one of those kinds of parties down here b4. Anyway..i didn't dance much..after a while i called mom and wanted to leave sooo badly. Me and deidra just didn't fit in that crowd. Just another reason i can say 'i hate it here' SOMEONE GET ME OUT!im serious someone come and get me and bring me back home to WV! Hopefully tomarrow will be better.

						   well...today's thursday...ALMOST FRIDAY! yay..can't wait cuz im goin to a dance down at osprey lake. I haven't been to a dance down here but i heard they were fun. People actually dance lol. Anyway, Tia's last day is tomarrow cuz she's goin back to Maryland :(..lucky her...she gets to go back to were she lived. So, Tia is going to the dance and invited me cuz Krystals on the committee. Deidra got an "ok" from her mom but she'll probably have to ask again cuz her mom was half asleep when she asked. I hope she cheers up cuz she's been pretty down about her party lately. But I just talked to her on the phone and she sounded alil more excited about it i guess. I just hope gabby goes cuz if she doesn't then cindy can't..or wont~ so im not sure cuz i have to pick them up. Thank god that fence is broken again so they can walk over and we can give them a ride.      I had soo much history homework but luckily it was only on Texas becoming a state so it was easy. I had about 31 questions and i had to write alla the answeres in complete sentences. plus i have a science test tomarrow but...i think i'll do okay.

						   well..today was a normal day thank god. lol...I met Matt today for the first time. He's really cool...if your thinkin there is some attraction think again. Don't get me wrong he IS cute but...one thing...he's gay. Yes he's gay and there's nothing wrong with it. He'll be at the party on Saturday with his boyfriend Luis. I haven't met Luis yet but lookin forward to it:) Anyway,other than that i was so happy to hear from Brittney and Chrissie today! Our conversation was quite funny but im not gonna get into that now lol. For enlish class we have to write poetry. I love writing and all but I just don't like what we're doin right now. I had to write about 5 cheezy poems that really aren't any good cuz I didn't have any fun with it or have emotion with me. To me its just a school assignment right now. But it doesn't matter. So far...ppl who I know who are going to the party:Gabby me matt luis cindy(maybe) carlos of course there's gonna be family and other ppl that i don't know..but thats okay.

						   You know what I thought was just so funny?...Jeremy's mom cut his hair reallllly badly due to his bad grades lmao! It looks so...there isn't a word for it. yesterday he came to school and showed the back of the bus but almost everyone including the sixth graders in the front saw! lol...right when we got into school, he went into the GIRLS bathroom and showed Tia and probably Crystal his hair...well he got caught. He also got ISS for the whole day. He didn't go to 1st period so I thought he had skipped class or something. So I asked around and I heard that he got ISS. lol..so funny. I'm sorry but I can't stand anything about jeremy he's just so....annoying in every possible way. He talks alot of *u know what* and talks bad about everyone except Cindy. Cindy's like a really good friend of mine and she's also very pretty.(I envy her and I'm not afraid to admit it lol) But like...he drools over her every time we're on the bus and of course I'm the seat between them and have no Francesca to talk to. She's in California by the way. Atleast I can talk to cindy and gabby. But I always notice jeremy talking about her and like...looking at her...in the wrong way. He's just alittle pervert I swear cuz he has no chance with Cindy. First of all she can't have a bf till she's 15 but she kinda wen't out with this really hot guy for like a few days then felt guilty and dumped hun lol. Anyway...cindy's sane. I think I might have been on drugs or something when I went out with Jeremy. I think I went crazy or something. Anyway...lets see what happens at school and I'll post later.

						   Ever have those dreams that feak you out?...No I mean really scare you to were you can't control it?..Last night was just...unbelievable!...My dream was that Dee was bein stabbed or shot or just..being killed by a shadowy figure. It was in my appartment complex and I was just there watching her in a hold with that shadowy person or thing. I walked towards them after that thing tried to kill her and it disapeared. Mom woke me up cuz she said i was beatin on my pillow. Now, when she woke me up I was okay...then I got outa bed for a water or something and i just start cryin my eyes out! I did't know why-maybe cuz it was Dee being killed or me having to see her being killed by something that didn't exist? Today I found out that the same thing happend to Dee. She couldn't sleep...just lay awake in her bed then she started crying and sayin she missed her friends and she missed me and she wanted her dog(who died a while back ago)Nikki. She was tellin her mom she wanted to go home when she was in her kitchen. We told eachother that we didn't get to sleep peacefully till about 12:00 in the morning. All day I've been feeling miserable tryin not to day dream in class..keeping my eyes opened...their irritated as I type this right now. My dream was bad...really bad and scary. I had to eventually sleep in the livingroom. I swear that I've never had a dream so intense and vivid before. I knew it was Dee suferin in my dream because of the color and length of her hair. I've seen her cry before. I knew it was her.  Could this dream mean something?..I need to check my cards and I'll let anyone who reads this know what it meant. I hope i NEVER have a dream like that again.

						   Today was pretty uneventful. Probably one of the most laid back days I've had this year. I'm usually at school or at the mall or somewhere other than home. If not i'm usually beggin my mom to take me to Barn's and Noble just to read a book on Paganism or Wicca lol. Plus theres like a caf'e inside so I just love it there. Sometimes my parents just drop me off there and they go next door to Best Buy lol. But back to the uneventful day..all i freakin did was watch buffy and charmed then worked on my blog all day. My day's work is what you see right now lol. I know not much but these code things just put me thru loops. Then AOL time lol..i always hafta add that into my day just to keep up with everyone up in WV. Everytime I talk to a friend from there I just get homesick cuz I miss them and some of the drama lol. Not too much drama around here. All the drama I hear about in my city is on the news. All I hear is channel 9>in today's news a 19yr old driving in her car was hit by a Linx bus due to the blinding fog early this morning. (that really happend by the way) thats as much drama I usually hear about. Sometimes its good sometimes its just stupid. But I don't care. I like hearing about things.

						   Em- what kinda guitar do you have?..I think my dad might get me this really really nice blue one. I never had my own guitar before I'm used to tryin to play my dads. But anyway, I also have nothing much better todo. I checked out a couple of dance places but they are way too expensive for right now. I wanna try something new anyway. I mean i love dance but...I think i should try different things than to do only one thing. I'll post later cuz its only morning so many many things could happen today lol.

						   k..Em> acoustic isn't really hard to play..you just need the right guitar. Ones that don't hurt your fingers when you press on the strings. I had that problem when i was learnin in 4th grade with my dad's guitar...the strings hurt. You need a guitar that fits you. Dad told me it takes alot of practice and todo your own thing and find your sound.

						   somethings gotta change. I sit here wondering what my next move is. I have absolutely nothing todo but listen to Jason Mraz's cd all day long. There is so much stuff that i could be doing right now but then again my parents wanna stay home. Maybe I should go write a story or something lol. Well tomarrow might be alittle more eventful due to the fact that i'll be watching Charmed  and Dawson's Creek in the morning Buffy the Vampire slayer in the afternoon and more Charmed at night lol. Anyway..Last nights Buffy the Vampire slayer was alittle upsetting. I saw willow(the witch) turn frikkin evil>she may have had a good reason to cuz the character SOB Warren had to shoot her girlfriend. But I was totally happy when she tied his arms and legs to a tree and skinned him.(when i mean skinned him i mean...ALL of his skin came off lol) Too bad those episodes go on air only on weekends I'm already watching season five everyday and i havent' even watched 1-4 yet lol. Oh well i don't care. Im not really a fanatic(well maybe just alil bit)im just a fan of James Marsters who plays Spike(yummy)lol. The show that im a freak about is Charmed...I've seen almost every episode:) I think my mom's worried about me with that cuz today she almost made me watch TV Mass which is a catholic TV show..FIRST OF ALL..im not catholic to begin with second of all she's startin to make me worried that she hates what im doing..(some ppl know what im sayin right?) But anyway, i don't care.

						   Its like...mind reading that was so weird..just talkin to Em and im like...i have a mission to learn to play guitar..she's like dude Im learnin too. That was sooo weird...yep..my mission for 2004 is to learn guitar..i wanna write me own songs and play them too. I have soo much free time i can teach myself but dad's gonna teach me how. Fact: Avril Levign taught herself how to play guitar when she was 13! so did my dad and he bought his first guitar for $13 lol so if they could do it so can I! lol

						   today...was kinda hectic.  I went to the mall at 10 and didn't leave till like 1. Mom piled up the jeans for me to try on...plus about 3 shirts. I got Dee a birthday gift ..she's gonna have a party which the era is 50's so i need like a poodle skirt or something of the sort. I think it'll be fun since almost everyone will be there. I actually get to meet Tyler and hopefully Jacka** number1 lol. I've been wanting to meet them forever but i never got to. Anyway, after the mall we went to go meet up with my brother at Vans Skate Park. I thought it was cool to see him doing something other than playin video games or hangin out with David and Kevin alla the time. Since it was his first time skating at the park, he didn't do much so i watched alla the other guys skatebording and  blading. Some of them were actually pretty good thank goddess that i didn't see Jeremy there. I wouldn't of mentioned it to mom anyway if i did see him. But i didn't so its all good. Keith's pretty worn out from skating right now and i don't blame him either. Plus he's back so I'm gonna go.

						   I can't believe the votes were rigged by our own teachers! It really makes me and my friends mainly advanced students won best and most. The teachers took votes after us meaning they didn't even count the ballads. Well, what did we expect...Our school is getting worse and worse by the day.

						   today was terrible. The weather was perfect, the house was nice and clean, the air was fresh, Not a cloud in the sky.  Yep it was terrible alright..the day went by to fast and i stayed inside. I know your thinkin..whats she doin inside?..Well i'll tell you, I was on the internet reading depressing poetry..writing poetry and wrote more poetry...Yep that wa my day...but then i went outside. Cindy and Gabby were outside. I felt so unwanted and worthless. Gabby brought up last night and she just pulled me down. I had a knot in me..so i went to see if bill was home. Then i turned around and decided not to go. I stayed behind in the pool area just tryin to relieve my stress. I sat down and just about fell asleep. Gab said she'd be back but i knew she wouldn't be so i just sat there for about an hour. It was nice and cool out so i had no problem with it. I'm glad i was alone. I needed to be. I felt so terrible about yesterday and how gabby wont believe me. I dont' even care anymore...I know that i didn't talk alla that stuff about her. I know her brothers made everything up. Then gabs said i was fake crying...ok..i don't fake cry...and i rarely do cry..only when things get BAD. I thought of what i could do...thought about how i wanted to be back *home* so badly. I don't know why ppl would make up lies about me or thalia..they're not true..not one word of it. I want todo something about this but i can't. I feel so unhealthy and worthless right now. I feel so ugly and repulsive to myself. All I want todo is just go to sleep cuz FCAT is tomarrow and plus im tired. Yep staying inside just wore me out. Well mom just got back so i'll post tomarrow.

						   well...today i sence that its going to be alil awkward. Gabby wants to talk to me about something about last night*ugh* i seriously can't take anymore of this. I don't want anymore of this drama lol. I'm a reformed drama queen lol. Last night after everything happend i felt centered but now im iffy. Maybe i should...nevermind..not gonna say it on here. Tomarrow is FCAT..and if ms.bitch from hell dempsey didn't want us to bring our holocaust stuff then i wouldn't have to bring anything to school. grrrr..makes me pissed. All of the other teachers are letting us relax and stuff and watch movies. But NOOOO ms.dempsey just has to have her holocaust packet done for a grade. They tell us to relax...Like history is relaxing..its FREAKIN DEPRESSING!..Everytime we watch a movie or look at pictures of the holocaust i feel like crying. Anyway...emily hope you feel better.     Well i'll post later on today.

						   I think now officially id give anything to go back to West Virginia!...I hate all the drama down here...Ralph cut me down so much he made me cry which made Thalia cry. Actually it wasn't so much the cutting down part it was the lying. One lie after another about me. I can't believe him! ..Every single person that i know at the two apartment complexes were there to see the show. Even Bill but he was cool cuz he gave me some insight on why this is happening. And it all of this just has to happen the weekend before FCAT. Great! How can i relax now?..I have a huge knot in my stomach and i can't consentrate on even writting this. I wish everything would be okay. Drama in WV is NOTHING  like this. They called me a ho and came at me with these sticks while i was on a bike. I don't know why all of this happend. Oh and by the way David (the cause) pulled the fire alarm this morning. Everyones saying he didn't know it would go off! ya right...he knew exactly what that thing does.      Me and Thalia both need to calm down..I don't know what i'm gonna be doing tomarrow cuz usually i go to gabby's but...i guess im not going tomarrow. Everything was fine until tonight when Bill was feelingn weird. While Ralph was lying to gabby..Bill told me"Hey after all this is done we need to talk...theres a bad bad spirit around here i can feel it." I said ok and what does it do. He said"It causes problems and something bad is going to happen tonight." I guess he was right...I'm so mad im hungry. I can't believe this...I just wanna go back to everything that was good. Its so messed up right now.

						   well..today i found out that Tim and Raddy,best friends, almost got in a fight but Kahn broke it up. Anyway it started when Tim got the ashes put on him...i can't remember what religion does it either christian or catholic but Raddi started to make fun of it and tim's religion. Well from what i've been told Tim hit Raddy and now they both have ISS for a week. I think that Tim did a good thing by hitting Raddi..knock some sence into that kid my gosh. lol...I don't think its right for ppl to make fun of a religion..whatever it is. I mean..almost everyone of my friends has a different religion. for ex:..bill is wiccan, ryan is jewish, deidra's catholic. And I really can't stand how much s*** some of my friends go through,including myself, over religion,like if your not this sertain religion your not cool or you believe in satan and his being or ridiculed. It's just not right! I don't like it one bit and it just needs to stop. It's really starting to piss me off how ppl can be so stupid to make fun of what someone believes in.

						   OMG! haha...yesterday was cool i was outside ALL day. Me,Gabby, Keith, Josh, and lil kev, hung out for a while then decided to ride to 7/11. Keith rode on his skateboard, I rode on the back of josh's bike and Kevin rode on the front of gabby's bike. We got back and we just sat on the curb and talked and acted stupid..just a fun 'ol time. Then we met Billy...he's 19 and really hullairius. He hung out with us for the rest of the day while Cheston, Cindy, and Carl came outside. Well, we mainly just stood around or sat around doing nothing but talk and we went over to the lil playground and just talked and played basketball.    It got dark so we all went over to my complex and hung out for about 10 mins till Kevin G. came. (he's a big pervert) I can't stand him but it didn't really matter if he were there or not. Cindy had to go home so from her house she called me and i gave the phone to gabby...she walked away from the rest of the group. Then all i heard was billy goin 'you either leave her alone or you leave!' to Kevin G. I guess he was talkin bad about me as usual. So he left...that gave alla us a sign that he wasn't going to leave me alone. I went over to tell gabby what had happend and guess who i see lookin at me over the bushes. KEVIN G.! I was sooo pissed off. He started walking so I followed him. I got to him and I went  crazy im like LEAVE ME THE F*** ALONE NASTY PERVERT. he's like..'im leaving' im like..no im not done.' don't talk about girls like that...and you wonder why they hate you so much?' I said some other things but its all just a blur. i remember the last thing i said was'AND IF YOU COME BACK HER AGAIN I'LL F*** YOU UP..i'LL KICK YOUR SORRY A**!!' i swear i said that and everyone was like you'll have back up with that lol. And after that..billy goes..' i could literally f*** him up.    That was my night. very eventful lol

They didn't cuz the busdriver pulled over the bus. We almost tipped over. Ralph was like 'shut up harriette tubman..i'll **** u up!' lol..she was like'ralph wats the problem'..he said 'i'll..tell..you..what...the...problem...is!' in this weird voice. It was very funny..i was laughin so hard. Well after the bus i went over to gabby's and found Chasten and alla them there playin basketball and skateboarding. I had a really bad headache after alla that running and stuff so i went home when it was turning dark and fell asleep. Keith came in and was like stacey..get up Chasten and Gabby are outside. Well it was like 8pm and i rushed out of the house. I was cold and tired for the first 10mins but then i was havin fun. Ralph came over also and we all listened to..rap music lol. Chasten was teachin me how to ride the skateboard with 2ppl on it lol..that was FUN lol although we kept falling off..well i kept falling offlol...anyway...he's training to be a lifeguard at disney. So I wont see him till like 3 tomarrow :( lol...I met this other guy carl...he is HOT im sorry but he is. Blonde hair green eyes...really cool. He was doin card tricks and stuff and I had just mentioned tarot cards and he was like..you got tarot cards too? I was like...uh..ya 2 decks he was like...i only have one standard deck. (now i thought that was great)But anyway...I just had so much fun tonight! Byes

						   today was alright...we had substitute teachers for math and geography classes. The math was funny cuz i was just...surrounded by idiots lol. Ryan, Tom, Juan, and Nick. They're just really stupid. Juan said i look at people weirdly..like i don't look straight at them just kinda off to the side. But the funny part was geography. We had an old geezer for a sub and he just took everything the wrong way. Someone would like...not even be talking and he'd think they would be sayin bad things like cuss words or something of the sort.      But, I was glad that Mr. Hunt wasn't there so i wouldn't have to hear his loud breathing. I wish you could just hear it lol. And his come-over!!! omg its just terrible. He thinks he's like so cool with that hair "don't" lol cuz one day we were all just sitting and he was like..combing his hair to the side. I can't stand him. He's just probably one of the most weird teachers I've ever had in my life! lol...I'm talking about the main geography teacher(not the sub)...anyway...In history we're learning about the holocaust and its just depressing. Everyone was seriously in awe of what ms.dempsey had to say for ONCE!     After school I hung out with the guys plus gabby. We were all skateboarding and just being weird. I met Josh's brother. He's pretty cool i guess. He like jumped in the bushes for some odd reason lol. Even gabby wouldn't jump in there cuz it has like snakes and things there. But anyway, I'm gonna go and get some rest for tomarrow. CUZ tomarrows FRIDAY! yay...later gatorz lol

Its very pretty..we're in 3 parts and the last measure is just....tear jerking lol...really it is cuz i have to hold this note for like 8 seconds..its usually not a problem but i had to gasp for air after it lol. in History i had to take a test...the rode to civil war....i think I did very well on it. Except for the essay question..my answere had nothing todo with the question lol but anyway....i g2g  i'll post back laterz

						   hey um...lets see nothing much has been going on this weekend. Saturday and Sunday I went shopping with mom. And then I hung out with Gabby,Cindy,Kevin,Kevin,Keith,Josh, and these other ppl. I just got so bored...everyone was outside. I mean..it was a nice day Sunday. Me and Cindy got super bored one day and so she got out gel and rubberbands and just did my hair. It looks really good. Anyway, I talked to Tia and she's having a good time being back with alla her friends. She's soo lucky, i mean I have friends here but i'd do anything just to go back to WV. Sometimes, or most of the times i just hate it here. But sometimes its alright i guess....I'm really not used to alla the different kinds of ppl. I just think I left a bunch of loose-ends when i left. Things might have worked out..I'm sure some how they would've. I just really wish that I could go back. Nothing is really working out here. There has to be a way. I mean...Ryan moved here from NY and he gets to go back every summer but summer is too far away!

						   well....its the 14th meaning its Valentine's Day! not such a big thrill to me lol. Friday was just so terrible...bad luck. heres what happend:I couldn't lock my stupid door cuz the key wouldn't budge, Keith had to go to the hospital, My cd player wouldn't work on the bus, I got marker all over me and i didn't know it until i looked at my hands, my lollipop fell to the ground(i have no idea how). But there was one good thing, got to go shopping and go to the mall. But of course something scared me and my family so much that i just yelled the F word infront of my family. Yes...this taxi van pulled out right infront of us while we were driving and we almost hit. Thank goddess i had my seatbelt on lol. I was very shaken up but i didin't let my parents know. I kinda just laughed it off. My dad was like"ok i need a cigarrette" and he doesn't even smoke lol. I was like "pass me one too" but...i hope they knew i was joking lol.    The rest of the time driving we were jumpy because of what happend. Another taxi van kinda pulled up to us so we kinda swerved over. I swear i was about to flip off those mo'fo's lol. It really made me pissed.     But the rest of the day was fine i guess...enough of the bad luck already...now i really believe that Friday the 13th will haunt me the next time it comes around.

						   well...today was boring.   Um...lets see, i found out that jeremy wont be coming back to school this year. What i mean is, is that he's going to an alternative school. His mom sent him for some reason. I probably know why but im not going to say.    And something else kinda froze me up..me and ryan were walking to the bus and deidra comes and tells me that Matts boyfriend commited suicide!...i don't know why or how or what happend....i need to find out. Its hard to believe. I mean..he seemed pretty happy today. But the whole time on the bus ride home me and Francesca were talking about suicide.    Thalia called and we talked for a while...i told her about matts boyfriend but she doesn't know what to think...neither do I. But anyway i have about 20 poems to write lol...i've been putting it off forever. So somebody call me or something so i have an excuse to not write these stupid school poems lol. Byes

						   hey...well today was pretty boring yep..same ol' story lol. Deidra was at school today...she went to the hospital for tests on the days that she was absent. She passed out three times from what she told me. She has this thing where if she doesn't eat she gets moody and passes out. But anyway, tomarrow is Florida Writes. We are given a prompt and we have to write about it. My english class has been studying writing skills for 2 weeks for it. So far the schools highest marks were 3.9 everyone wants a 4. Hopefully our team will win for the attendence thing for tomarrow. Supposedly its a big accomplishment for teams.    Well anyway...a person from DPHS VPA dance magnet program called me tonight. She sounded about 16 or 17. She called to answere any questions that I had, which i did, and I guess i'll see her at the audition. She's just auditioning for placement cuz she's already in the program.      Okay well anyway, I'm watching 7th H. and will be watching EVERWOOD yay lol..so i'll be aposting tomarrow.

						   so...today was kinda boring. History was soo easy all we did was watch more of the Civil Rights Movement. lol Quite boring if you ask me i think it just causes more controversy at our school. im not getting into that right now. In chorus I found out were singing an actually good song. It's very pretty and we have some great harmonies and stuff going on. I'm feeling better today...i still can't hear very well. Math was pretty funny tho. Everytime mrs.daniels would call on Ryan and Tom they would be totally clueless cuz we're talkin and stuff. luckily she didn't call on me or anything cuz I had no idea what was goin on lol. OMG and Mr. Hunts hair today was just so funny cuz me and Ryan were talkin about it yesterday, and today it just made me crack up lol.     Gosh and I hated the bus ride home although it was kinda funny. First off, the sub.bus driver just cranked up the volume on one of these rap songs. It was...Eminem..and guess who got up and started rapping...Jeremy of course. Omg he's such a wannabee. I can't STAND him. Then one of MY favorite songs comes on and then he starts sing...now that got me really mad lol. But anyway...after francesca left Jeremy started flirtin with Cindy...like he has the slightest chance with her. She hates him too! I don't know....I might be alil overdramatic today lol. Just being myself.    Okay and I need to find out what time that skate competition at Vans starts. Ryan-if you read this let me know.

						   well...today was alright besides the fact i had to take 2 big 25 tests and another quiz. I missed almost all of chorus and of course we were learning 2 new songs! Oh well..can't sing anyway cuz my voice is always going out cuz of my stupid cold and im all stuffy and i can't hear myself talk in one ear lol. Sounds fun right? lol...anyway I went outside after doing makeup work. Maybe once a month i'll go outside to see Gabby and Cindy. But anyway, I went out there and we rode around on scooters,bikes,and skates for a while. Pretty boring but as time passed a bunch of funny things happen but im not gonna post it. Jeremy is being such a jacka** as usual, thank goddess he didn't talk to me and Francesca as much as he usually does. Whenever he does talk, however we just tell him to shut the **** up and turn around. Eww and omg, Ms. Dempsey...she was wearing this totally grose green dress that was way too short! it botherd me..it looked like the rest of it was cut off. I mean...It was just weird seein an old history teacher wearing that 'thing'. OH ya  and CONGRATS to mrs. Walker on her newborn!!! yay im so happy for her...she was my fav. teacher for wheele class. Well anyway...hopefully something more exciting will happen later on. so ttfn!

						   hey...today i felt misserable! History was just...boring as usual and chorus..don't even get me started. I couldn't hear myself sing and i didn't wanna sound bad so i faked singing hehe. We're singing a really great song called "To be young" and i hate that i can't sing it right now. I'm all stuffy and feel tired and I'm always frowning cuz i feel grose lol. I feel all tangly up inside. I got another letter from poetry.com just a confirmation that i ordered one of the books. Ya know what...I've really been neglecting my tarot cards lol...i think later i'll do a celtic reading or something. Oh ya on the bus today, everyone had to face the front and basicly shutup. Well lil kevin(gabby's bro) just 'moved his arms the wrong way' and got a referal. Jeremy and Myra already got 2. But it was pretty funny cuz gabs and cindy were makin noises lol..and they sit behind me so i tried not to laugh but some ppl know me well enough to know i can't stay quiet when the room or a place is silent lol. Its impossible. Everytime I do a staring contest with someone i blink or when we do those laughin contest im the first one to crack up lol. Anyway...I'll be on AOL later if anyone wants to talk. *Pumpkins? lmao*

						   hey  i know I know you've heard about it a bunch of times but that halftime show lastnight was crazy! lol. *I need help with History!* anyway...today was alright but the most fun part was in math. I got to work with Ryan, Tom, and Deidra and it was pretty funny. I don't know what it was but i think i was really hyper lol. I felt weird cuz i havent been hyper atall this year. Maybe its just from me bein sick this past week. I'm not sure but right now im feeling a bit *blah* ya know lol. Right now i want nothing todo with Jeremy. I cant stand him. He's such a jerk! Ya know, why cant any guys down here just be nice?..I mean Ryan Mark and Tom are nice...(fla.guys) there needs to be more of them lol. But anyway...FCAT writin is coming up soon Liz is freakin out, i said to her just chill cuz its no big deal. Nothing really counts on that anyway.I feel like im about to crazy, not cuz FCAT just cuz i feel like it lol. Anyway nothings really goin on..i'll be on AOL later hopefully if my brother will let me lol. Byes

Also knowing my luck my parents have already forgotten about the yellowcard concert and then when i ask if i can go they'll be like...no we don't have the money right now. its only 17.50 to get in so they wouldn't say that anyway.

I was actually kinda nervous cuz we haven't sung our MPA songs for anyone except the compser and some music teachers from the highschools lol. But it went well..i hope we were good. But anyway....nothing really has been goin on...i really wanna hang out at bills lol...he's the only one without parents so we hang out there. Its really fun but not when EVERYONE is there lol. It beats staying home over the weekend lol. I really wanna see...u know who for somereason....hehe. not gonna tell.  haha i don't know what ryan had in his mouth in mathclass but he stuck out his toung and it fell out! hahahahaha omg it was just so funny.

But i don't even care...as long as i get to see bill and cheston i'll be A ok! ...that was kinda cheesy but oh well. I can't believe it is friday..already. It seems like just yesterday we were heading off onto the bus longing for the hours and hours of notes,quizzes, and bitchy teachers. yep...it friday alright!  Well..i'll post later....

						   today was pretty good. I went to dance rehearsal...its so corny those moves. lol...its kinda funny. Anyway, Nothing has really been going on but....gabby is just really frusterating me. What the hell does she have against me?...i've been nothing but nice to her...just bcuz her brothers SAY that i was talking about her(which i WASNT) she gets so offensive..whatever to 'if they don't like me then screw them'the whole get on with your life thing. Its not that hard to GET OVER IT and stop holding a grudge with out me know how she feels. but whats the point anyway if she doesn't even care what i say. she'll believe anything her 11 yr.old brother and her stupid 15 yr old brother say. its like...she cares but she doesn't want to. Plus i heard her talking about me to cindy on the bus. Cuz i heard cindy say'well your puting me on the spot and your making me choose' well...thats really not fair atall to cindy and...isn't alil weird how i didn't even talk about her to begin with and she goes off and starts yaking to bill and cindy? thats not cool. David(her lil brother) makes up things all the time especially about me. He spread a rumor that i flashed josh and that i talk about gabby all the time. Everyone believes him! whats up with that?...we're all 13,15, and 19 yr olds here...we really shouldn't be relying on david for information about another person. He just has to be the one to cry wolf. What will I do when something really bad happens...i prolly wont believe it if david is the one to tell me. David pulls the fire alarms, david always gets hurt, david makes up rumors, david makes so much noise and disrupts the apartment complex(S). Should ANYONE believe this lil kid?...gabby will believe anything her brothers say and deny anything we tell her about them..how the REALLY act!!! This is NOT fair atall. I am nothing but nice to gabby, i never have talked bad about her, about looks personality or her living style. NEVER!...and she will believe her family. Im still trying to think about where the whole 'live and let live' thing went. I have friends and family around me 24/7 and not once have i talked bad about gabby.     You know what...i think me and gabby have been friends long enough to know that I dont talk about her that way....how can she think that i talk bad about her. Just one lil comment that her lil brother makes and everything is HELL! whats up with that??????? Plus...we need Kevin one of her other lil brothers likes witchcraft and wants to do spells with me bill and keith but gabby (of course) wont let him. we need him for a circle dammit!...I try to be calm...but...why is it that when i walk and i see her she gets all pissed when i haven't done SHIT! whatever....I dont' even give a shit about what she thinks. As long as i got alla my feelings out right now...i'll be totally centered when i see her. Which i hope i wont.   I was supposed to go to see bill today also to see....someone but...when i called bill he was in traffic...i could tell by the rain and the cars. lol...but anyway...i need to go to the book store so i can get a BOS. If you don't know what that means...i'll tell ya later.   invoke fire element:(this works) Fire i call upon your heat to aid me in this magkal feat Give me what i ask of the As i will so mote it be.  u need fire to do this.....no wind!

But being as stupid as she is she erased all the grades so she can't right me a recomendation dammit! i don't even care anymore..high school is gonna be totally fucked up for me.   francesca...im not in LOVE with a dumbfuck. i know what love feels like and this aint it lol. But i do like cheston alot. But.....he's complicated...i don't see him very much cuz he works and plus he stays home...but....oh well lol...maybe we'll get to play truth or dare again lol.

I said all the words in the spell and i looked into the crystal. We also invoked dragons. I'll post about that later. It was a very cool experience. Even bill was suprised to see her so close to keith and SMILING...yes she was smiling lol.   Also..cheston and i were on the couch watchin a movie at bills when bill takes out the crystal orb and looks into it. Now im serious because it works cuz i saw it too. SEX. yes..he saw something about sex. Me and him both held the orb or crystal w/e without us knowing what he was doing. Then he tried to cast a passion spell lol.

						   Its still morning so there isn't much to talk about.  My aura is BLUE!!!  ----Don't worry blue doesn't mean a life full of sorrow.But those with blue auras are some of the most emotional people on the planet.Blue's are quite sensitive to other peoples feelings-they can cry at the drop of a hat even if they sence another person's pain.They use their incredible intuition to help other people whenever and however they can--by feeding their bodies or lifting their spirits. If you are an empathetic people person who finds satisfaction in giving love and caring for other people surrounded by a blue aura.--- Yes that is my aura...and i kinda believe it too. I'm not afraid to admit that i am very emotional with things.But the funny thing is is that I try to help people with problems and i can't even solve my own! lol  Also on the job thing...my possible jobs are  consultant psychologist-yes!!! speech pathologist entrepreneur actor teacher counselor massage therapist-hehe i already do that lol politician or diplomat->? writer or journalist television reporter-neat computer programmer,systems anyalist or computer specialist-umm...okay? scientist-uh..no engineer-cool

						   good morning everyone!good morning Florida and good mornin West Virginia!i remember when the news ppl came to our elementry school and we had to say 'good morning west virginia' lol..i know...its stupid to think about but just the whole good morning part reminded me of it lol. So anyway...yes it is morning..josh and keith went to sleep around 2:30 HAHA me and Francesca beat them. 7:45 AM!! lol. She didn't stay the night so i was up playing SIMS (building houses) my fave part. But while they were playing cards and playing games on the computer, i was safely tucked away in my bed. Although the fan was on and it kept waking me up.  I keep having dreams that i am drowning or getting swept off into current. I'm checking my dream cards as I type.  Questions on the card: 1.Are you the person drowning, if not who is it?...i am the person drowning 2.If someone else is drowning are you trying to save them?...they're not drowning 3.Is the dream set in a river, lake or at the sea?...the sea...and a pool Now for the reading:This is about being or feeling overwhelmed so look at your waking life to see what you are feeling threatened by. If  someone drowns, it may meantsome of your feelings and creativity need to be taken care of. Much of our anxiety comes from situations that existonly in our magination. Response to Questions:A person or animal drowning suggests an aspect of your personality needs to be cared for. 2.(doesn't apply) 3. All water in some way signifies your own inner world of feelings but the sea often suggest meeting urges and wisdom lying beyond the boundary of your own conscious mind. What is it that you feelin the sea or river. Put it into words.  Hmm...i was at a beach...looked like daytona but at sunset. i was facing all the people and i was in water waste deep. I couldn't step forward to get out of the water. I could only go back if i wanted to move.I felt like i needed to get out desperately and join the people who were waiting for me. That was it. Blah.

						   I do understand why my parents do all that stuff. And i always see how keith acts. But....he wants things so badly and nags my parents for it and its so annoying because i don't ask for anything...except to maybe see my friends or go to the mall or bookstore. HMMM....leprechaun lol a TALL leprechaun. i can't get over that lol. its so funny...he had like red hair and a shamrock on his shirt. lol  Something is up with gabby and ralph. Not that i care about ralph...i can't stand him but something is wrong with gabby. She's acting differently. Yesterday i asked her if she wanted to see what alla the guys were doin accross the street and There ralph is standing like a body guard and said'me and gabs are hanging out'  i'll post more about this later. But josh keith and david just got back.....isn't it sad how i hang out with guys younger than me?.....well josh is 13 but still.

						   im pissed im sorry but i am TICKED OFF! keith always gets what he wants but i get the things i love taken away. Its not fair! First we move here...keith gains  what he wants-living in beautiful florida and meeting girls while i get my friends taken away from me...i can't see them anymore. Many other things that I enjoy  are taken away from me while keith gains everything. When i found out i was moving again! I can't go to DP and my audition was totally gone, every chance that i had of making myself into a great dancer was down the drain.  And today, ya, my guitar is taken away from me. I didn't do anything and their like...we're gonna have to put your guitar in the shop for a while. DAMMIT!   But i kinda understand>i shouldn't be saying this. My family is struggling with money and my dad's like working two to 3 jobs just to make enough money to pay just the bills. And if dad doesn't get enough money to pay the lights we wont have them. Ya just a bunch of total bull shit is goin on. I can't see ppl in wv i can't dance i can't play my guitar. How am i gonna get good at guitar if i don't have one? I learned a Jason Mraz song and i was getting better at it and now my guitar is gone. NOw im stuck at home....cuz the parents are away. I have to watch the freaking house. I wonder if i can apply for a job at publix....your aloud to work there you know lol.  I just wish my dad had a better job. I hear the same thing over and over. We're moving for dads job. He'll make more money so we can do more things. Gosh they've lied to me more times than i can count.  its just sad.

But anyway, One of the guys oooh my god he was HOTTTTT! lol I know i know, its HOT TOPIC, not exactly the place to meet guys...HELL YA! But i mean...i only kinda thought the first two guys were hot but.....Franny liked the leperchaun lmao! Probably becuz of the eye liner lol. j/k franny.

						   well....even though keith spent the night at josh's house (hehe) josh was over here allllllll day cuz it was rainy. We played Bull Shit like 50 times...i actually won! lol....he looked like he was about to fall asleep on my couch lol. That woulda been fun,,,if only my mom weren't there! damn lol.   Hmm...i feel sad. im inside....and all of my friends finally came out. See i have more responsibilities than keith. When the parents go somewhere...i have to watch the house and take phone calls and just stay home..plus cook my own dinner tonight. It just gets kinda lonely. I have no one to talk to face to face. The only real friend i have is Francesca and she lives a walking distance a way but too far to walk by myself.Oh how i wish i were outside. But im alil off when i walk over there at night. It really freaks me out. Not because there's crazy people out or rapists or whatever but because....its just weird. Things in the trees the full moon(too beautiful to believe) and just...a cool wind. I always have to look behind my shoulder just to see if anyone was following.  Ya...i'll go to the mall with ya. Maybe I could 'maybe' ask my mom if she'll take us to Avalon...its a store full of wicca and witchcraft..celtic u know..the works. That would be alot of fun.  Is thursday alright?..u need to call me-franny   So bored and sad.:(

						   Yes Francesca it is the curse of florida! But you know..even in WV i was still bored when it would rain. Always so gloomy. But sometimes it would match my mood.   Isn't florida supposed to be sunny and bright? Guess not lol...None of the lights are on in my house. Its always like this on rainy days and i hate it. I hate looking out the window then looking back inside just to see the same colors,Grey. My room is the only room in the house with the lights on. And I mean..its so boring...i have to wait for Thursday.....is that alright with your mom and dad franny? Cuz josh is stayin over on Thursday as well lol. That'll be fun j/k lol.... I need to check the moon calendar to see if Thursday has a full moon.    Weekends in wv either rain or shine would be fun i guess. I remember going to the movies alot during the weekends. I even remember this one time we played a trick on steven at the movies. That was fun lol.  Francesca-if i show you how to change the colors are you gonna turn it all black?...that would be cool j/k lol. Oh and if you get to stay over on Thursday we're not having any type of finger foods lmao.   Nothing has really been goin on....Keith is over at Josh's house..he stayed the night....UH OH! lol....ew..i hope my brother isn't that way lol j/k.  So how is everyone?...c'mon i need something to talk about. How bout......Yellowcard was on the Sharon Osborn show on the 1th but the show wont air till the 22nd...so I gotta watch that! yay... I talked to Brittney last night!! i was so happy to talk to her...i havn't talked to her in forever! but i wasn't aloud to talk till nine cuz it was long distance(i had to call her back)...well i guess i'll post later.

						   Your right emily...no one really is a true individual at your school. (Only the lucky ones are) some ppl there actually FIND themselves...they look straight into their hearts and pull out all of the emotions. Its hard todo that when your in a school full students wishing to just get out and take control of themselves. ONly the lucky ones  no not lucky ,passionate ones get to do that. But its kinda weird cuz, Many have moved here from all over and i guess its a type of 'learning to find yourself' experience. You dont' have to fit in to be excepted. We should all try to learn that...i have. I guess you have to like yourself and 'fit in' with yourself before you make any type of friend. Why should the board take that away from the people who have found who they really are? Take them away and put them in uniforms to look like everyone else?  OK now for my post:  we have so many talks They always end with crying First we talk about love Then we talk about dying A love so strong a bond so tight It ruins us all that we wake up at night we walk around the complex sad thoughts,not a sound After those talks Our true voices are not found So next time we talk Lets not be afraid to look or tap into eachothers souls and see what pieces of our hearts we both took.    ~ya this is one of my poems if your wondering~ this is NOT dedicated to anyone.  Someone unexpected always helps you in the most unexpected ways.

I sooo want to see the Yankees train down here!...The Mets are in kissimee and the Braves are like 3miles from us!..My 2 fav teams are yankees(hehe) and Mets. I used to watch baseball games with my great grandpa. He'd always make me sit down with him drink coke and watch the yankees.(tear lol) I guess ryan is going to see one of teams train today.

Hopefully we're not doin anything tomarrow so i wouldn't have to go to school but I have dance rehearsal for chorus and i can't miss chorus CLASS. she's like making us comit to it. but thats alright cuz MPA festival is coming up and we're gonna kick some serious ASS if only we weren't in those long black dresses.

						   nothing's been goin on.   Friski is like...really starting to make me scared. She found a protractor in mr hunts...lol...i also have one but not for harmful reasons. No wonder she wears alla those braclets...hides her scars. I've already seen them but she added more today. If your wondering how i've been doing:im okay....i guess. Somethings are still hard and i do still cry and WANT to hurt myself but i don't. We had an NRT..don't ask what it means cuz i don't know. It was boring boring. but back to Friski, she was really mad. This morning me and her were talking about moving to different places and how are parents expect us to make friends real easy. So ya...she did'nt get over it and then her friends pretty much ignored her today. Even i could see she wasn't doing well. But anyway, all i said was "lifes a bitch then you die",,she was like"don't say that to a suicidal person". she laughed but i didn't. I mean...it was a joke but i could REALLy see her commiting suicide. Whats with the word commit?...how can u COMMIT suicide. commiting your life to death?...sounds alil weird. (I've had way too much time on my hands lol)...But...when Friski says she's gonna do something She'll do it. Her and I have alot in common but...i wish we didn't have suicidal thoughts in common..she's gonna call me tonight and we'll talk about it.

						   hey everyone...  today was so boring. Stupid FCAT testing was today again and then we had to go to 5th and 6th. Which mine would be Mr.Hunt(ew) and Mrs.Ferrer :) In Mrs.Ferrer we got to talk all period and relax. I was still bored but it was fun. My mom is still searching for the 'perfect' high school for me to go to next year. It WAS DP but nooooo we're moving to sarasota so i have to go to like a manatee high school lol. I don't know..it has VPA. The teachers are making highschool sound like a torture zone. You have to take a billion classes that really have nothing todo with what you wanna become. Actually i don't even know what i want to be so turns out that dance is really my only option..im not that great at other things.    I'm feeling better. But the thing that kinda made me ticked was when carl(the druggie) said i wasn't worth his time. Well screw him...atleast im not the one on drugs lol. i really don't like him. What am i gonna do over spring break? Probably..nothing. Just sit in my closet lol. j/k parents are taking me to where we MIGHT live. Whats the use? I really don't care what happens anymore...lost all hope. Even though i feel better there's just things that are missing. (I really don't feel like talking about it.)     I hate it here.

If i keep feeling this way i'll be talking to my parents to get me medication or to see someone. I heard they lock you up real good.lol Also I'm asking bill if we could do a recall so i can see the root of why im feeling this way. Last night we did a recall of my old house. he really freaked me out with some of the things he said about my room and the kitchen!..just..weird but fun.    Hopefully he wont pick up some of the 'bad'things we did at school(some ppl know what im talkin about) lol But he wont care he's done worse believe me lol.   I don't know where i'd be with out all of you...probably dead. '    Thanx!

						   man o man last night was terrible.   I cried so much last night its not even funny. I was thinking so hard about just giving up (if you know what i mean). I hate all of this stress and tension. I hate making people sad and it just shows that im only around to cause harm. I should have a warning label saying:CAUTION:emotionally disturbed don't mess with me.    Why am I even here?...Almost everyone i know has hurt me in some way. I hope ryan understands..i don't expect him to but i feel so bad. I need to curl up into a corner and cry...but I have no tears left,im completely out.    Francesca has had so many friends commit suicide that if one more,including me, does it she'll deffinately go crazy. I mean...(i really shouldn't be sayin this) she used to cut herself, i dont' know if she still does but, I looked on her arms to look at alla her bracelets she had on and, there were just a bunch of healed scars. I looked at her like what the f*** and she just smiled and said'u should see the marks on my waist' i was so angry,but she kinda gave me ideas but i don't think cutting yourself will do any good. Just causes more pain...some ppl cut because they feel numb and they have no emotion so they cut so they can feel pain. Others cut to punish themselves, some cut for fun(dumbasses), and others just are so depressed taht all they wanna do to occupy their time is cut.(that would be me) But see, my aunt is dying because she cuts. Supposedly she's doing better which is GREAT but, i don't want to follow in her footsteps.   I try to take a walk or listen to music to get all of my emotions out. I don't want anyone of my friends to hurt themselves. But...then why do i want to hurt myself? So confusing.      To top it all of i think today will be awkward...I'm goin to Festival Bay with ryan and i think hes mad at me. But hopefully we'll have fun and get through it. I'm looking forward to talking with him. He knows whats going on with me..but not the whole story.   Elizabeth also knows whats going on but its just part of whats happening. If anyone talks to her on AOL she'll just say to figure it out yourself so i wouldn't bother lol. She knows that im upset about DP..which the audition would be today and she knows that im sad. Jeeze im so messed up right now i don't know what todo with myself.    In song.~

						   today was alright.   I feel bad for elizabeth cuz her audition for theatre was yesterday and she forgot some of her lines!..But atleast she gets to audition, i don't. She said the dance magnet was really awesome cuz she saw them dance. I just kept thinkin i could do alla that stuff if i weren't moving. But one of the highschools i might go to has a VPA program but...I REALLY wanted DP. I mean i REALLY REALLY wanted DP. But...I guess you can't always get what you want, especially me. This really sucks. I'm still not convince that my life is worth living. I know its not good to think of bad things but i can't help it. Nothings going well for me right now. I have a D in math that im tryin to bring up. No one really cares so whats the point in telling you.    One good note:Yellowcard is playin at House of Blues April 11!!!! me and Francesca are going (me hopefully) I can't wait! Personally, I haven't really gone to rock concert b4. lol. I think it'll be so much FUN! I got they're cd Ocean Avenue and Its THE best cd i have. Like, everysong on that cd is my fav. lol   Well i kinda learned a song on the guitar! Behind Blue Eyes...its a great song. Its not even hard to play.   Lets see..in chorus Mrs.Brown made everyone audition for dancing in the spring concert. And yes, i was picked. Unfortunately i have to do lil corny dance steps lol like last year(for those who remember lol) But it'll be my time to goof off again and be stupid lol.    Speaking of chorus, MPA is coming up VERY soon lol. I mean i have rehearsals in the morning! We're singing To Be Young and Rise Up Singing. and guess what, the person who composed To Be Young,Dr.Brunner is coming to my school to my chorus class and is going to work with us! I really think its honor for him to come back to FLA. to just work with us.    But anyway, I guess im gonna go and see if Bills outside so i can talk to him. Toodles!

						   ok..   I'm gonna hate highschool so much. I don't even care anymore!...If i weren't moving then my audition would be on Saturday and all i'd be thinking about is dance! im so mad. I see Elizabeth rehearsing her lines for drama VPA and i get so sad cuz i can't go to DP. THIS SUCKS! gosh i really can't stand my life right now. Too much goin on. I found out that Cheston is doin weed and the person who provided it was Carl. That made me pissed and josh is tryin to deny that it happend. Poor josh...why does he have to put up with cheston.     Today..we were reading Night..the holocaust book...and its just too depressing. I can't stand that book. If only Dempsey would soften her heart and let us take a break from that book. It causes too much controversy and saddness. But OTOH...it is good for us to know about what happend back then.     OH YA and i saw a ghost today in the girls bathroom during 6th. That freaked me out. It looked exactly like Samantha had said cuz she saw it too. I was like...scared out of my mind but i didn't run for some reason. So im gonna ask bill what alla this is about. It was too weird..im telling the truth!    So anyway...I'm gonna go now and see if bills out so i can ask him.  Byes

						   well...today was better. I'm still not over the whole 'guess what we're moving' deal.     Today i found out on the news that a teacher bet a student that if he jumped out of a 2story building he wouldn't make it! Well he jumped and he was fine lol...he went up stairs to get his money and now the teacher is in BIG trouble lol. Shows how some ppl can be stupid lol. Well lets see here...FCAT was boring as usual except for the 1hr. brake...those are fun lol. But anyway....yes....im goin to the movies with ryan this weekend...i think it'll be fun. I suppose after the movie we're goin to vans but its up to him. I'm just really sad that i wont be auditioning for VPA program. Really sucks.    Ya know...im just really pissed bcuz i haven't even been in Orlando for a year and we have to move...I'm sick of moving!!!! Of course you've probably read all this from my last post. But ya...im really ticked lol. Not much going on really...i kinda wanted to go outside to see josh...he's like the only guy that i like'as a friend' who lives accross the street from me. Alla the other guys except bill are just dumb. But bills gay so ya lol.      Ok here are the bands that im listening to right now-Yellowcard (hell ya!), Mest, and H.I.M. If you have any other suggestions on any other Punk Rock or just Rock bands tell me...i wanna hear them! lol..I'm also listening to Jack Johnson and Jason Mraz(luv him)lol.Well...i guess i'll be leavin...  Buh byes lol

I was so mad...i AM mad!I have never been more pissed off in my life! Well they already ruined my life by moving here so it wont make much difference now will it?!    Its bad enough that I miss everyone back in WV now i have to leave AGAIN...im just screwed. oH YA AND INCASE SOME PPL WERE WONDERING 'what about Dr.Phillips magnet?' THATS DOWN THE DRAIN...I'M SUPPOSED TO BE AUDITIONING FOR IT ON SATURDAY BUT NOOOOOOOOOOO IM NOT GOING TO THE FUCKING SCHOOL ANYMORE. that was THE school that i was set on going to besides Freedom. This is so messed up. I have so many other things goin on the last thing i need to find out is that im moving again. This sucks.

						   last night was terrible.... we got home from disney..and grama starts talking about how crystal(my cousin) and Tracy(my aunt) have really weird intuitions about things. and how my uncle bill's girlfriend is a witch. So mom and dad start talking about how im a witch and all this stuff so they call me over and i start talking about somethings that have happend. Like the tarot readings i did with *someone* about a friend and how everything was pretty much dead on. Well....turns out that....grama starts saying "im sorry to tell you this stacey but tarot and witches are.......well..evil."My face turned bright red...i was so angry. She says have faith and stick with God..believe that jesus died for our sins. >then she says how Crystal is a real christian and how she was down the same road i was I worked for everything i've done ....god had no part in it. I went to church maybe a few times in my life....i never understood it. And to tell you the honest to goodness truth...when i was little and i'd pray b4 bed...id get terrible terrible unearthly dreams. I'd wake up sweating and crying. I totally stoped praying after that. And then i come to find out that my friend went to a baptist church just to see what it was about...(he's methodist) and they start saying 'god doesn't love you...your evil' shit like that..do i want to be apart of that?....hell no.   Plus....the bible says not to hate and love thy neighbor.....what if your neighbor is wiccan? or jewish?......whats gonna happen then. don't hate.....what about ppl who are gay?......illegal for gays to be married? thats a load of bull shit to me.  I don't want to be apart of that. I want todo what i want...be myself my own person and not follow someones rules. How do we even know god exists...like francesca said..some drunken person coulda written the bible and just sold it to someone. I'm not trying to bash anyone elses religion even though it may seem like i am but im just trying to stick up for what i believe in even if i have to lay it down for grama...my own blood doesn't even except me for what i believe in...im the same person that i've always been....just..wiccan. My friends understand what i believe....and i understand them too. I mean....has she even read the wiccan rede? 'An ye harm none, do what ye will' in other words...do what you want just dont hurt anyone in the process?....I don't care what religion you are...catholic, jewish, satanist, voodun.............frankly i don't give a u know what......as long as your doing what you think is right...go for it............question is why cant my family feel the same way?   great....they're back now so im going...

She's so out of it....she'd fall asleep when she'd be in the middle of a sentence....she'd say things are somewhere but their not...she'll make up things in her mind and like just completely make no sence. Atleast the nurses are nice...they drew blood from her and the nurses actually talked with me and keith lol. That was maybe the good part...plus we all watched jeopardy.  i had a prreety bad day. I mean...it wasn't ALL bad but just the lil things lol. I skipped dance practice today...i wanted to take it easy...i didn't want anyone to get on my case about not knowing the dance...so talked to mrs. walker about stuff...she still has my poems in her classroom lol. But...in math i have a D so thats gonna be on my mid term....and i cut my arm on the bus...and then in the hospital i spilt coke all over me lol. It makes me laugh at it more than mad at it.

						   Not all who wonder are lost. For example, sometimes I just wonder and I'm not lost. Although, sometimes I wonder and get lost, then I'm just lost and not wondering. And yet, what if you are wondering because you are lost?  Then, you would be wondering to find your way back. And what if you keep wondering to find your way back, but you never find your way back? Then you'd just be lost.    hehe...confusing huh?

Oh ya and Ben(guitarist) came off the stage and handed out picks and i got one...it says YC on it! Oh ya and Francesca...I moshed! lol and i did very well lol. Keith and Ryan fell on their asses!...I almost did at one point buts someone picked me up. I almost snapped my rist cuz of the crowd surfers. In the front is where the security guards take them and they kept coming on top of the ppl in front. That sucked but....just seeing yellowcard made me so frikkin happy! They let the audience back up sing in Ocean Avenue. They even played Empty Apartment :)   but now...im sore...this is morning...going off to school on a rainy day.

Then dee turns around and goes stacey i am tired of your bullshit so stop fucking around and then she pointed to ryan and thomas and she's like 'same goes for you two' we just started laughin but then, Ryan was like 'what the F*** did i do?' She was like 'your just a white jew' everyone got quiet and was like 'ooomg' lol. I think Mr. Moser heard it too lol. I even thought that was disrespectful and I usually don't care about it. But she didn't have to say it infront of the whole class. I was like 'omg dee yours screwed' lol.  Anyway...ya Franny came over for a while. It was fun...better than being stuck at home doin nothing...wishing i were hangin at bills with 'some ppl' ...dammit which one! brothers suck! lol Went out at night while josh,david,kevin,jordan and keith were racin on skates and bikes and what not...playin my guitar...im getting better....im starting 'empty apartment' by yellowcard. It sounds better when my dad plays it tho...cuz all i have todo is sing plus he can pick...i can't and he can keep with the beat.....i can't lol. But u know dad's been playin since we was my age..so i can't really be so negative about my playin guitar.   Well hopefully bill will be home so we can play the smoke game or just hang out lol. I'm gonna go play me guitar somore...Franny..u should really think about playing again...my dad could restring your guiatar if you want.

						   your right francesca...im in some deep shit! I like cheston..i haven't even seen him in like 2weeks. Ya this really sucks. Liz says i shouldn't date any of them and she has a good point. Cheston....i don't even see him much plus...if were ever to date...i know he'd do something with another girl and would ignore me all the time. And ryan....i love him as a best friend..he doesn't even know me that well so how could he love me. I know i can't tap into his feelings(well theres a spell for that) but anyway...i know i can't do that but....its not love. Thats just the way it works for me....no one is supposed to...u know love me here, well no guy anyway. I don't want to date anyone right now and I don't wanna be involved in a mixed up triangle thing. YA I'm screwed.

						   howdy,  back in Sarasota..joy. I liked miami, being with my aunt. She's really cool, i learned alot about my family history. She did a tarot reading on me, we lit a white candel for protection and purity and then i picked seven cards from the spread. I'm not saying what the cards said but, i guess some good stuff is going to happen but, yet some stuff about loneliness(what else is new)...so anyway, we went to the beach in Venice and I got a bit of a tan but, not really, im so pale its unbelievable. Not as white as ryan tho lol but close. I'm going to call Franny tonight (its her b-day)..plus i want to talk to her anyway. She moved to her new place on saturday.-i think- but anyway, there were some uber hot guys at the beach...yummy, but um, ya ANYWAY. hehe, Yes, new Degrassi starts June 4th and i guess it'll be good. I mean, Manny gets pregnant (supposedly if they show that episode) but i know what happend oh ya, and i couldn't believe it when i read it. I swear i'll never be able to watch One Tree Hill the same way again. Ryan totally ruined it lol, but it was bad timing cuz the show got alil too dramatic lol. But ryan just thought it was funny, therefor he started making me crack up while watching the show so, i really can't watch drama shows the same way. Crystal was on Entertainment Tonight!!!! ya, and i didn't get to see it cuz grama didn't tell us!! grrrrrr.....she was on there for 5 mins talking about how she's gonna be the new model for Lane Bryant. (HUGE clothing store) great job for her. I'm really happy for her, i mean, she's not a stick anymore, she's healthy and she's getting these major jobs.  Ok well im gonna go...just catching up oh ya and the move Day after Tomarrow is AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!

						   Hello...im here in miami right now..Aunt Tracy's house. Moms getting out of the hospital TODAY!!! yay...the surgery went great they even said it went better than expected. Im really happy that moms okay. The thing is...im staying for another night here. Which is cool cuz we're bringing out the tarot deck(yep tracy's into it) So yep...im so happy that i have an aunt or relative that wont lecture me on witchcraft but, makes it easier for me. I have so many new stories to tell now. I've been learning so much about my heratige that i had no clue about. But i knew about my great great grandmother(i think its 2greats) how she was cherokee indian and she wouldn't talk about it to anyone in the family. Cherokee indians had a nature based religion practice (Wicca)..so apparently i have Wiccan blood in me. Isn't it weird how alot of my family experiences things that no one else does and that we're all into researching religon. But we always come to Wicca. I guess its just ment to be or something like that or we're different religions but when we find wicca and research it, we always understand it, we like it and we keep wanting to read into it because it is so real. The only thing Tracy said to me was, be protected by the light. She said think of yourself as a star, your drawn to help people but there is so  much darkness around you. I told her i always go out at night to look at the moon(if i've been with you at night you'd know) but she said well maybe you want to be brighter than the stars that surround it and that is one of your gifts. ...she is very cool, but she told me that i need to pray to a higher beeing before i envoke a spirit or do a spell but i knew that i just, never do. Wow, this has been so awesome. I love this. ..my aunt is so awesome, and she'lll tell me things about our family that no one else in our family knows, well some of the stuff they do, they just wont talk about it.  Okay well im going to go so i'll post later.

						   yep...just sittin here....bored. Mom left for Miami today for surgery...we'll be leaving tomarrow WITH topanga...great. I'll have to sit in the back with this huge dog just looking out the window, laying down, barkin at other dogs...what fun. But i guess it'll be worth it..i want to see mom but not in a hospital. I wish she didnt have to have surgery...she even said 'if anything happens always know that i'll be with you in spirit' omg..and i was watching a sad show so, ya it just made my life hell lol. Oh well, anyway, ya, nothing really going on other than what i just told you. Oh ya, I don't have a door to my room..reminds me of 'Freaky Friday' where they take off her door. Yup everytime i go to my room now im so used to having a door i just swing my arm like its there and then i feel so stupid cuz its not there. Its pretty funny tho.

						   >sooo, after ryan left :( me deidra and keith went back to the apt. and we actually started to help out. We orderd pizza cuz we were starving, plus i knew that deidra had to eat soon cuz of her hypoglucimia (can't spell) yep, then after a few more hours she left. Then Cindy came over *yay* and started playing the guitar(yes i got it back!!!) Then she left after helping us pack summor boxes. Then after everything was packed up and vaccumed and cleaned, got in the car and drove off, pangy in the back seat and key in her cage in the truck. We drove for 2 hours, and the whole time i listend to Yellowcard over and over.Yes i was sad , Empty Apartment gets me everytime lol. We stopped at gas stations maybe twice. We came to this city, smaller than Orlando for sure, but it was pretty. I look out the window and I see a small tan house. Big driveway, a white mail box. I didn't say anything, i was silent. And before i even went in the house i met some skaters, they were actually nice people, some were going to Riverview(the highschool i'll be going to) and some were in keiths grade. So I walked into the house and everything was tile...very cold. You could tell it was still a new house because of the paint smell(which i love) lol. But, it was lonely. It didn't look 'alive' as some would say. So we tried to unpack most of the truck. I fell asleep for about 5 mins, i was freezing and really tired. I had to take a shower but the water was like ice. I made my bed and because i was so cold I put on a sweatshirt. During the night my parents had to make sure i was still alive because they said that i looked like i wasn't breathing. (weird) but, oh well.  Our cable is hooked up and i dont have any of my spooky channels. Travel, and AND I DON'T HAVE FUSE!!!!!!!!! I seriously love that channel and im so mad that i dont have it,grrrr. but, oh well, i can deal. >Im not going to die with out it lol I'm still freezing, and im wearing a sweatshirt. I've been playing my guitar alot and i've gotten better at it...i can finally play that song that ryan tought me over the phone without messing up! YAY. haha, and this one girl is still on this one subject and she wont get over it lol, its really funny if you know who im talking about.  okay, so i guess thats it.

Then...we got to open our letters that our parents wrote us at the beggining of the year...and i cried so much..i was really sad. Then i left to go to the bus, when i walked down the stairs alot of ppl were waiting for me u know>for hugs but i didn't see ryan anywhere. I looked all over the place for him at the bus loop but..he was no where to be found...i even went over to his bus and i couldn't find him!!...i felt so horrible...i started crying. then i quit..u know tryin to hold it in but after francesca got off the bus i just...really started crying...i just really can't believe im leaving so sudden...i didn't get to say goodbye to Ryan :( *tear**** and im gonna miss francesca soo much. *sigh/tear* *sobs*...im really sad. really really sad.

						   today is Friday..d-day whatever u want to call it...this is my last day. I woke up this morning and felt horrible. 2 minuits after that, i started to cry. The crying has not stopped. Today, will not be happy, nor tomarrow. I feel very sad right now. I don't want to cry around my friends but i know its gonna happen cuz i know that sam is going to be ballin. But, maybe our sex ed teacher will make us laugh today. There must be a moment to laugh. or giggle. and i really hope that eddie doesn't get in a fight on the bus today. I mean..me and franny were trying to tell eddie 'remember, you get suspended and it'll go on till next year' which is true. and its not worth the fight anyway. But oh well, i may hold him back if necessary or i'll let keith do it cuz he sits next to him. But ya, a fight wouldn't suprise me one bit.  and hopefull my phone will still be hooked up today. and hopefully the computer will too. That would suck if its not....sigh....

Im never going to the bathroom at school again tho...omg...i mean...they totally missed me but francesca will tell you otherwise lol. I got really pissed off tho. But towards the end of the day it was alright. I saw ryans pics...omg i looked so stoned and ya..it was funny and there was one at the dance and he looked like he was having an orgasm lol..and i was infront of him!! haha good times tho. I need to get my pics developed. hmm..what else happend today..oh ya i got best dancer in chorus lol. I was actually suprised. I though ashley would get it but she got it in notables..which is a different class. But...that was cool. Oh ya and our bus broke down so we had to get a different bus and then..when we past our busdriver we all flipped her off. It was funny..but i think we'll be hearing about it tomarrow from her. Oh well i dont care.  Last night i was sad...yup..listening to the beautiful sound of Yellowcard...'Empty Apartment'...haha i told ryan over the phone how to play it 'A,C,G,D,F' lol easy.  well i guess i better be-a going.

						   well..guess i was wrong..today wasn't as emotional as yesterday but...it was still sad. Samantha wouldn't stop crying...my gosh..i think she is actually over-reacting just a tad. And Paola was actually crying today...:(I've never seen her cry poor thing. Everyone is leaving. Everyone is going to different High Schools next year. This week so far hasn't been going well...in 4th when paola was crying i went to go give her a hug then i started tearing up and i was like 'this is too much' so i sat back down and went back to work. Then in 5th..me and ryan were partners for the Japanese Dialog thing and we were writing in japanese when i just start crying for some reason...i just..put my head down. Grr..i tried so hard not to.   *i hope everyone in WV has a grand 'ol time in DC*-and when you get back...i  might be on the road to sarasota...depending on if you get back on friday or saturday.  Sadness

						   hmm...hopefully today wont be as emotional as yesterday. Im cryin 'on the inside' haha ryan.  *sigh*...i wonder..when i move what am i going to be doing for the rest of my summer?...probably calling everyone like ryan, francesca(when i get her new number) Samantha,Jesica,Deidra,Paola. Everyone gave me their numbers and told me to call them so i will. I'm going to miss everyone so much. I'll miss the 'grrs' in mr.mosers class lmao, i'll miss the dumb blonde jokes, the name macey(dont ask), Im just going to miss being here. I actually started liking this place just a while ago and now i have to move. This is the time where everyone gets the closest then someone has to move away. I hate moving...Even if im still in the same state, same town, i move to a different house or apartment every year. Signing yearbooks gets to me also...and everyones bringing their cameras and taking pictures. (i gotta get my film developed) and ya. I'm gonna miss this year. haha good times 'ghosts in apt.101' lol..we were so scared. 'This feels nice..' (dont ask) lmao. This year has been filled with so many funny things...never a dull moment with my friends. Barely any tears...but now...sadness. just remember 'Franny luvs you' and so do i!!   D-day:::4 days

While i was dancing...i tried to fight back tears but when i got deidra up and we put our arms over eachother and walked off i just busted out crying. I felt awful all day. Everyone i saw..i just kept thinking'this could be the last time i see this person for a long time' and i mean...i was just...omg it was bad. I felt bad about Francesca too...i shoulda told her sooner. But...we're good now..listend to Rooney on the bus. Im just gonna miss everyone..its been a good year with friends. All of us have really grown up.(not pervertedly)franny said 'i hate signing yearbooks,its so final'...i agree. Everythings so sudden i mean..im moving saturday and Francesca's moving the saturday after mine. I just feel so sad. *tear*...i hope someone calls me cuz i feel like talking. :(

I want this week to go by reaally slow....I wish Friday wouldn't come, i'm gonna seriously cry at school lol...walking down the hallway then bamb..start crying. lol...But..im more sad about Friday cuz thats the last time i'll see alot of ppl.>Like Francesca cuz she's moving too Going to school early tomarrow.

						   ya well...its the morning after lol.  No Im really happy for some reason...in a good mood. Maybe cuz Courtney called last night at 10:30 and we talked till 12!! I was so happy to hear from her but the weird thing was i was going to call her today to tell her i was moving and stuff. Well when she called I told her that i wasn't going to Dr.Phillips and that i was moving. She was like 'THATS INSANE!'...I reallllly don't wanna move. I'm gonna dread this last week of school :( I mean...my parents might even make me stay 'home' on the last 2 days of school. My house is pretty much packed except for some stuff that we need. My room usually has a bunch of stuff on the walls...its all down. And I don't even know what school im going to...or what house we're living in. Ok..now im sad lol. I really wish that i didn't have to move....im gonna miss everyone so much. And Franny's moving toooooo...NO! *sadness* It was really hard for me to move last year...when i got down here...i went to my room and sat for about 2 hours alone. Now i gotta move again just when i started to think things were going ok now. I know im gonna cry the last time i see everyone....god dammit im crying now just thinking about this. I can't believe this....only been here for 1 year and im moving.

						   the dance was GREAT!!! alot of ppl dressed up for dress-up day. Took pictures in class...and ya...it was so much fun. Me Ryan and Samantha hung out for an hour after school..no point in going home so we just stayed then went to the dinner...which was cool cuz they had the tables decorated. Then we went dancing!...it was soooooo much fun! Everyone was just shakin it(including me)and it was just awesome....danced with ryan on the slow songs  :)  andthen on the fast songs all of us would just mingle around and just dance with guys and stuff. Lemme tell you, Carlos is an awesome dancer...bump and grind lol. And once we got Tim dancing he was really good too + ryan was actually good too! There were about 2 slow songs. Then the rest were like hip hop and maybe 1rock song lol. But when the spanish songs came on..deidra,ryan,sam,tim and I all danced..it was funny cuz we're all white lol. We got caught by the same chaperone maybe 4 times cuz we were all dancin so close in a 'sugestive' manner lol. And i think one of them thought me and paola were gay cuz we were dancing together on one of the fast songs lol. It was funny tho cuz she was like 'u need to have space' lmao.     It was alot of fun...The gym had some cool purple stuff on the basketball hoops and stars and stuff. Everyone looked great...almost all the girls wore dresses. Some of the guys wore tux's and looked like pimps lol. And some guys kinda dressed down...not really formal. But anyway..ya it was alot of fun actually dancing.lol And im glad deidra decided to dance as well.  well....i think im gonna go to sleep cuz my feet are killing me from those shoes!

						   hey, today was alright. i mean, besides the fact that i didn't get to see Ryan today. :( But i guess...deidra was in a better mood for the most part. Sandy was throwing up blood yesterday and now Shadow is throwing up blood. I think it musta been something in the food. So...ya..we couldn't practice today cuz we didn't get a cd player in chorus and then mom made me cancel with deidra cuz we were gonna pick her up then mom remembers that she needs to wait for the doctor in Miami to call. She's goin in for sugery on Friday...or tomarrow i can't remember. I don't like the idea of her going for surgery. Scares me.   The dance is Friday..which is also Dress Up day. I don't know what im gonna wear. The only dressy stuff in my closet is black. I might wear some nice pants(black) and a pretty shirt(black and white) lol. Tomarrow is Tacky Tourist day but i dont think im gonna dress up for that.   My room is packed up pretty much. Just ask ryan, I hadn't been in my room the whole day then when i was talking to him i went to my room and i was like 'omg' lol...the walls were so...blank. It was really scary. And now all my pictures that were in frames are packed...the only pictures in my room is the big colage(can't spell) of everyone in wv. Oh ya and (for anyone who's been in my room either in WV or FL) my big mirror almost fell right on top of me. Yep...I was putting away clothes and u know hanging them up well some of them fell...so i went to pick them up and i get alil feeling like somethings gonna fall. U know...everyone gets those where somethings gonna fall right on you and u get really scared lol. Well I had that feeling so i put my hand up and i lifted the mirror up right b4 it hit me. I was so frikkin scared lol.   Last night i couldn't sleep. I had some mixed emotions. First i was happy to talk to Ryan on the phone and we were watching One Tree Hill and laughing our asses off! It was soooo funny!!! But then when we hung up...i got into bed and started tearing up. I didn't know why. Just kinda looking at my room>it looked the same as my old room when we were about to move  Much Luv...(JKK lmao) what about WKK?!? lol

						   mellow greetings ladies and germs. all i've done today is sleep sleep and more sleep. Well i watched TV but i dont wanna go into detail on THAT right now lol. Found out i dont get my schedule till August 4th!!!! thats a long time. I dont like the highschool...its kinda weird...but weird could be good...uhh hmmm i dont know. I just wanna go to a school of the arts...i coulda gone to one in Manatee, but the parents hated the area. Oh well...just another year of torture right? I think everyones just been through too much and we should all do away with school. but then again thats like my place to get away ya know?...well sometimes..other times its hell.  Pangi,Dad, and I went for a walk last night...talked..family problems>not going into detail, cuz its no ones buisiness.  hmm..seems things are really fucked up right now, everything i think might have a potential to be good, always turns out to be bad. Story of my life. I still dont have my guitar back :( i need to play that thing cuz its like the only thing i did when i was bored. Now i watch tv...send e-mails on the computer..those huge quizzes and such.lol I've noticed that i've been very observant lately...i see everything that goes on nowadays. Ugh and i do that because im bored also. I got the Gary Jules cd...its good...kinda weird tho..i really like that song Mad World. oh god..the Lizzie theme song is playing *stop the insanity!!* im crazy. and loving it. i think im going psyco...i wanna dieeeeeeeeeeee, hmm not really but hey, its worth a shot right!?!?! lot more fun then being here and doing all the things listed above.

						   well, woke up...really tired, and i started thinking of the band Sleeping At Last..dont know if you've heard of them. but, i saw them when we went to see yellowcard/SoCo..they opened for them. They were really good so anyway, i was just u know thinking about that band so i found their website and it had they're e-mails so i just u know...emailed Ryan O'neil-guitar/vocals/keys. So after watching all the hot guys at the beach..hehe..came home and checked my email..well he e-mailed me back. I thought that was really cool cuz i didn't expect it. I'll  post the e-mail later. So ya, that was pretty nice. My face is pink lol..well just parts of it... we watched the Blue Collar Tour on tv..its 4 comedians that call themselves 'rednecks' lol...and the lovely Jeff Foxworthy was on there and did the famous'you might be a redneck if..' thing. Ya it was really funny.

						   well, the dance class was fun. We warmed up and learned a combination. My parents met this girl i think she's going to be a sophmore next year but, i guess the school is holding auditions for dancers for a dance team. Which they'll be going to the Macy's t-day parade!....i think im interested now lol. Anyway, the warm ups were similar to courtney's so it wasn't very different. crunches, push-ups, stretches. But everyone else in the class just quit doing them half way through, like push ups, everyone quit and like me, this other girl, and the teacher were the only ones left doin them. frankly i dont care about pushups or crunches or situps whatever. But anyway, good news-she said i should go to like level 6jazz/hip hop which is the most advanced until the adult classes. They're not having modern this summer :( thats my fav. But, I'm really sore, i have a hard time sitting down and standing up lol. Atleast it wasn't as bad as the whole week i had classes....chorus,sitting up standing down having to get your friends to almost lift you. But, its worth it to me. I might go to Prestancia with dad(its a golf course) and of course, play golf. I went there today for the first time and its huge!! its sooo cool...but alot of things were the same i mean, c'mon i practically well i did live on a golf course lol. Both dad, and granpa had they're own golf courses. There were alot of nice ppl there too, everyone was just all chatty and smiling. lots of ritzy ppl...and the houses..the houses are amazing...its like a huge resort...well duh, it is sarasota, and it is like the retirment capitol of the world lol j/k. but i mean, it was cool. Sunday we're going to Kasy Key...i love that beach.  I want to see 'The Notebook'..really bad...Ryan Gosling~yummm~

I really want to talk to her about some stuff. uh...i've just been on Elite Skills all day. Incase you didn't know its a poetry site, its fun. I have 3 poems and 1 story submitted.

Well nothings going on...i've been on a few dream sites tryin figure those dreams out but nothing is really coming up, uh except for the running and the woods. oh ya and houses, represent ourselves lol. So i drempt of a.....ooook, i understand, not really, but i get it. anyway, thats not the point. I've had enough time to myself....i cant take it anymore, im starting to think about things i shouldn't be. grr, i hate being by myself, its like im trapped in alil box they call a room. I miss alot of ppls but i really miss francesca because well, i mean, we need eachother right now and we both need someone to talk to in person, and i havent seen any friends in a long time. *sigh* ....ahh the sweet sounds of coldplay ..so sad, the lyrics are just so, thought provoking.

						   just got back from Miami. My aunt totally hit the roof about whats coming up in my life. I did a tarot reading and hit something dead on. But on her side of the cards they're all turned up and i was reading reversed from my side. So while i was reading what i thought where hers...she was reading my cards from her side. Everytime she'd talk about changes in my life she'd look at the cards and try to hide it. At the store we went to we'd start talking about dreams and things*francesca* and she kept giving me these stares that were just...wow. I'd be like 'what?' and she'd say 'nothing, just your eyes' what about my eyes? she'd be like 'well it runs on our side that we all have vibrent looking eyes' she also said to start reading body language books. But she knew what i was thinking the whole time I was with her. Scary.  God francesca we have so much that we dont know about our families but atleast your mom will tell you about it...i have to have my aunt do that for me. These dreams are getting scary for me. Last night, i had a dream that i was walking down a long hallway looking at paintings. And then i saw a friend *not saying who* flickering on and off like she's not there and then she's there. Which has happend in alot of my other dreams so i wasnt suprised by that. But, i dont know...its just...weird. Francesca..u have to tell me what your mom said...you told me when i came to your house that your mom is hiding something, im dying to know just like you are. okay well now im gonna write back on the e-mail.

BUt ya. That song by Muse is actually really good francesca...i listened to it while i was reading your other e-mails.....it went together...freeaky. I liked it, its very cool. Franny just write something, what you feel...i wrote 3 things and all of them have gotten good comments from other users.

I'm wearing my usual green pants..and im wondering(for the ppl who have seen my green pants)...are they jeans? or some type of....contraption...they might be jeans....they dont look like the regular blue jeans i always wear. You'll never find me in shorts thats for sure. Its either jeans or a skirt. ...but are jeans jeans?..or just baggy pants? hmm....francesca..what would you say..you've seen them? They have zippers every which way and pockets on the lower leg. Hmmmm....ok ya this is really stupid. But yes...i am going to the mall...yay for me right?...i dont even know why im going to it...mom wants to go. I really dont want to...i want to read my new books. I have to read them for school...has anyone read the book 'Cut'?...its good, very descriptive. And I also got the book 'You dont know me'..i was going to get like a book on teen witches or some other you know books with some cool stories in them but 'cut' and 'You dont know me' struck me as good. Plus i heard cut was a great book from some friends. So ya....some light reading with heavy subjects to them suits me fine. So yep..going to the mall. Nothing else to say about it...still wondering about my green jeans. sounds like green beans lol. Ok im slap happy as of now.

But the problem is...would my parents let me fly by myself? Probably NO!...so we were also thinking...they could fly down here and i'll fly back up with them and then come back home somehow. It would work tho. I reallllly hope that i can come to wv to see everyone. And I know Ryan is going off to Buffalo in late July..that'll be cool.  *Excited yet..frustrated*...i got my dad kinda thinking about letting me go. But im not even going to bring it up with mom yet. lol  Deidra's going to be here on Sunday yay!! She told me she cut off her hair and got it layerd and all that shizz...she had such long hair and now its GONE! and she even said that her hair is shorter than mine...now thats very weird cuz...uh this is the longest my hair has EVER been..i always cut it..and im trying to just...bare with it lol.   thats all for now.

Ok..well, luvs everyone...and ya, im not feeling well, cant speek, im coughing alot and i have chain headaches..hopefully you DONT know what those are...they're very painful and hopefully u dont have to put up with them.   * Everyone  is lost, in one way or another*

						   mom's been hobbeling around due to her surgery. I have todo alot of things for her because she's not really supposed to lift anything. I carry the heavy stuff from the grocery store, laundry, dishes. I'm mean i really don't mind, its just that im not very used to doing alot of this stuff.  I went to the highschool. we picked up registration packets and now today we have to return them. I dont really like the school. Its old...got some stories to it i bet. But, i guess its okay. I dont care anymore about it tho.  I just want to be back at my aunts house. I liked it there..i liked being back in Miami, seeing my old school and OJ simpsons house lol. I got to see the house that all of my aunts uncles and just everyone in the family grew up in...even i lived there. Old house, i miss it...it was just so pretty and grama had so many different things to look at.  Like the huge ass sword fish my dad and uncle donny caught. But anyway the ppl that own that house now...yes everyone who grew up there, we're gone but the ppl that live there now painted the doors white and it doesn't look all that great. They used to be brown and pretty. I only stayed there a few years until we moved to WV but, i LOVED that house lol. But enough about that. Enough about all of it. Im going todo my regular routine today:sit and watch stupid television shows that have no meaning to my life....nice huh?

						   well, tried calling francesca to wish her a happy birthday, (happy-sure with her moving and all) But i kept getting the wrong number.   Anyway, yes, i went to the beach yesterday, came home and watched TV. Watched some degrassi, old episodes of course. The U.S. version of the show, edited out. Nice.  Stayed up till 12 to watch Higher Ground-good show, i especially like the reformed gothic. (enough about that tho) ya so, nothing atall is going on in my life and i kinda like it for a change. But i constantly have to move around and since i've been in my new place i have done nothing but watch tv. My house is getting scarier by the min. due to all the writing on the wall. With a big cursive 'S'. in the middle of it all. Ya thats a lil scary.Also i keep seeing little lights..u might call them orbs but now that i just got back from Tracy's i see them all the time, i hear noises, things fall off my desk and bed without explanation. And, I've been watching my cat. Cats can pick up things just as well, or better than dogs and she looks off into no where land. she's lucky tho. Not a care in the world, she just sits, watches, loves. Thats It. Thats all she does. She'll meow when she see's me as always. She'll come to me when i call, but she acts really strange. hmmm..oh well. I have nothing on my wall except for the weird writing that's next to my bed. There she goes again staring at something(the cat)My room is still a mess, haven't touched anything since i moved here,,,things on my desk. I have my candels set out nicely. But i have yet to speek to my cards or, my cards speek to me, which ever one. So, ya sorry you had to read this, its very boring but, i just want to keep up with me blog so i dont lose touch. *Tornwings*

						   today was actually eventful! i finally fell asleep at 3 am but then i heard mom talking about how she's going over to seans because of the yard sale. So i woke up and got dressed and got the skateboard and rode over to seans. I stayed there for a little bit, helping out then he came over and keith and sean plus me all watched this thing on crop circles. Then he left and my parents were gonna go out somewhere, and asked me and keith if we wanted to go. I said sure, and got my cd's and sketch pad ready. But keith, of course, wanted to stay home. So we left, and we drove to st.petersburg. Then we stopped at this outdoor mall. We went into this realllly cool store called The Buzz, its got all of these great clothes for everyones style....very smart because everyone has different tastes in clothing. They had, uber preppy clothes then they had urban and then they had goth/punkish clothing-they had just every style. I tried on some jeans-and everyone knows i love my jeans, but i didnt seem to like any. Then we left that place and went into a shoe store...okay get this - sandals that look like you could get them for 20 dollars at Wal-Mart are exactly: $275!!! thats crazy if you ask me. But supposedly they're really comfy and last for a very long time. So ya, and then we went to this other mall called DeSoto. I wasnt really having a great time with clothes but, oooh this is a good part. (Best part of my day) i went into the Fye store and just looked around at some cd's and groups and accross from me i hear this singing, and it was funny singing like not trying at all, and i look up and smile, and its this reallllly cute guy. And he's like 'sorry' an i said 'oh its okay' and looked down at the other cd's and one of his friends was like 'dude your freaking people out' and walked a bit and smiled and he's like 'what?she liked it, see i got a smile outa her' , then he said 'im from Alaska so dont mind me' and all of his friends were like 'ya dont mind him' .....so after that encounter i picked out some new ear things for my walkman and left. After alittle bit, i decided to go into Spencers, and guess who i see?!!? the same guy in Fye. Well he saw me too, and i was looking at some jewlery, but u know, kinda looking at him too, and he passed me and said hey and went over to the card section. (the cards there are so grose) so yep i walked up to him and i said 'why do all of these people bring they're kids in here?' and he's like 'yeah i know what you mean', and we both looked at this grose card and laughed at eachothers reactions. So then we started talking about how he's down here for a baseball camp and stuff and all that, and then he dropped the bomb with the question...'so how old are you?', so i said 14,, being honest and he's like 'darnit' and i asked 'well how old are you?' ....he's 17! WHHHYYY ME?! gosh he was cute, funny, great personality...but i mean he's from alaska and of course he'll be gone in a while but, why does he have to be 17? or why do i have to be 14?! aghh. I swear, he's is the cutest guy i've seen all year, and talked to. darn, oh well, more fish in the sea...but, boy did i have a great day lol. yes francesca we shall go to the Vans Warped Tour '05, i talked to the cashier at Fye and he said he went to the show yesterday, and he said it was realllly hot there and he couldnt stay there because it was hot, he was even under a tree.. and i know that if i went this year, i would have gotten overheated because that always happens to me when im out in the sun for a long time or in a hot building or something.  So yep thats it, and i'll probably be going to that mall again tomarrow.

I feel very blessed that my friends are thinking about me by putting stuff in their blogs(renee and franny)&nbsp;and sending me e-mails(ryan in buffalo) and sending me cards(deidra and ryan)&nbsp;and calling me (Courtney and Justin)! I got some more cd's including Something Corperate....i really like their cd...i remember seeing them in orlando with yc. Mom and dad got me a Sugarcult cd and a Linkin Park cd.

						   i guess things are going well for the moment.My birthday is tomarrow yay! And yet, i have no idea what i'll be doing. No big deal really. Right now im watching the rock countdown on Mtv2, and so far its been Breaking Benjamin-so cold at 10 and Franz Ferdinand-Take me Out at 9 and Yellowcard -Only One at 8.&nbsp; I love that song,&nbsp;i like all of they're songs, but&nbsp;I can relate to Only One very very well. &nbsp;So anyway, i've been working on another song on the guitar&nbsp; its called 'Say Anything'&nbsp; by Good Charlotte all the chords are like C F C F so its pretty easy. Last night i thought my fingers were gonna fall off cuz i was playin the guitar for like 3 hours straight. Dad helped me on the first verse: i kept listening to like the drums instead of the guitar part so i was messing up pretty badly lol, but thanx to dad now i dont really mess up anymore on that song. Oh and franny- that song by Mest, its really good and its super easy to play but, i havent really listend to the song very much so i dont know the beat or whatever. its like C D G kinda chords. ok now Blink-182-Down is at 7. I might as well just list the countdown today since i have nothing else todo but it gets boring after a while....once you've heard Linkin Parks-braking the habit about 10 times at 1, you get bored of the countdown lol. ouch,,,im still sun burned by the way i just wore a tank at the beach walking around for about 10 mins and thats how i got sunburned and it sucks. Oh ya and GREAT NEWS!!!!>>>>>Crystal (my cousin) got the job for Lane Bryant and she's on this HUGE poster thing in the window of the store!!! She's like in a phone booth holding a phone and looking out...its so great. If anyone wants to, just go on the website, it is:  urlLink http://lanebryant.charmingshoppes.com/  she's on the front page of the site. She's on a few other pages as well like 'new arrivals' and the ponchos page. And grama even told us she's going to Africa soon for a photo shoot with this designer. When keith saw the poster, he was like 'omg!!!' it was funny. Im really glad to see that she's doing so well now that she's over that 'straigt modeling' she looks so much more...normal. thats a good thing.  Beastie Boys-Triple Trouble:6 ok well&nbsp;i'll write more later. bye for now.

I wish it were over.....well it will be in a few days. But i cannot express how much i hate summer.  ok well&nbsp;i guess im just venting a bit but wtf i dont care. Anyway, to add to the torture, i went to the beach today and go burned......nice going eh?  I think im going to IOA for my b-day, i wanna ride Dueling Dragons fire...due to the fact i already rode ice in may. But ya, so we're thinking, get up really early and just go to orlando and then drive home again at the end of the day.&nbsp;Im all alone....... :(&nbsp;&nbsp; as usual, i need a&nbsp;hug *haha*  Deidras leaving for New Jersey soon...2 days after my b-day so i KNOW i wont be seeing her any time soon.

						    I went shopping today..i bought 2 cds...GC and SOTY. There are so many cds i want to buy, but oh well, keith wants me to get the Lost Prophets cd, so i might later. I didnt find anything that i really liked today, jeans, thats all i wear so i went into wetseal.....its sooo colorful, i always feel weird in that store, cuz well i wear black and stuff but nothing compared to what francesca wears lol, i remember going into wetseal with her and it was just like she was this dark object in the middle of all this color. lol but anyway, tomarrow theres this new series coming on called 'The Days' it looks good from the previews, if anyone wants to watch it comes on Sunday at 10 on like, ABC or one of those channles. I will be watching degrassi again (the new one) because, i seem to understand things the second time around lol. Plus i didn't get to watch My So-Called Life yesterday. Tomarrow i have to go to a cookout accross the street. I dont wanna go but oh well,i'll live. I'm trying to act happy now, i read somewhere if you act happy eventually you will be happy..........i dont know if thats true or not yet but what the heck. I met a guy in the bookstore looking up psycology or something and we started talking about new age and how he probably wont find anything in that section, he was actually pretty cute. lol   Ok so i was reading this article in Twist Magazine how Lindsay Lohan and Hilary Duff are at it again....so anyone who has a blog this question is for you: Lindsay L. or Hilary Duff?.......i heard from deidra hil was a bitch to her aunt, long story, and Lindsay L. just looks like a bitch so, im torn lol........ooooh or how bout Ryan Key or Sean Mackin...or Ben Harper?...that ones tough!    im seriously losing&nbsp;it. Go Emma Go Emma,,she kicked alex's A$$$$$$$ that was just tooooo good, i just need to watch it over again.

						    yawn,....yesterday I had to go to Tampa, we went to the mall since this mall in Sarasota sucks! Anyway, ya, i bought some stuff, clothes, and today im going shopping again at the lil mall. ya, so at the mall, when we were close to being finished, the alarm goes off in the store. Okay well you think i'd be used to it because in HCMS the fire alarms are like Super loud but these matched it. So when we finally pay, we walk out of the store and it turns out that every alarm in the mall is going off! It was just one huge beeeeeeeeeeep at that time mixed together with all the little beeps in each store. We went into spencers while the alarms were still going off, but you couldnt hear them in there due to the loud music...i like the workers there now, i mean, they blasted good music so you dont have to listen to the shrieking. lol, ya but then we left&nbsp;and got home around 9:30 ish.    I watched the new Degrassi, Emma kicked Alex's a$$ lol, it was a good fight haha. Ok well i guess thats it and Ryan finally wrote in his blog...its about time!!

Mom has a temperature. Shes sick, and i feel bad. Especially because she's watching the news. yuck...i dont watch the news anymore unless its super important. I've had enough of this talk about Kuwait and all of those other countries...i just dont wanna hear it lol. Ya so, wat day is it? I think its a tuesday...oh i have dance class dont I. i dont wanna go...i did 30 sit ups and 30 push ups last night, and not those girl push ups i did the real ones  >>Im not sore..so im happy. I have another funny story, but its one of those 'ya had to be there'...well me and deidra were at Osprey Park at a party for a while and when we decided to leave, deidra got out her cell phone and started calling random family members...we were outside at night so, yes I love the night time and I do anything at night but, anyway, All of the sudden someone starts saying something to her and she about throws a fit. Well, I had her camera and while she was making an "OMG!!" face...mouth open and all..i snapped a picture. She stil has and and no one was there to really get the full affect on how funny it was at the time. Plus she's pretty dull...haha j/k...bipolar. Its not really funny funny, but me and deidra still laugh about it. yat yat yat.

Anyway, here I'll tell the story. Me and Francesca were looking out the bus window and all the other kids were walking to their buses and this kid looks up at out window, looks at francesca and says '5 dollars'....well we started laughing a bit and i yelled out 'Giver her 10 and she'll do tricks' and he heard me!!! so he looked back and walked off and francesca was like 'im gonna kill you'....she keeps her promises lol, it was uber funny though. And, whatever happend to that kid?hmmmmm, oh well.  Ok well im bored cuz its 11, i havent been able to sleep lately, i hate it when you want to sleep but all you do is think about things, ugh and like, the slightest noises or whatever will wake me up. grrr.

						   im bored.....the usual. I spent the day watching tv...the dumb shows and then i went to dance. I can feel every muscle build up again..i was shaking when i got out of the class. I felt like i could run a mile or something. But ya, it was a good class this time, a longer combination but this cheerleader girl (by her shorts) kept wanting to change the ending after everything was done. so ya, i was like....gosh darn it, just change the whole frikkin thing already. And plus it was her first class and she like made the mistake of wanting to change it. arg lol but oh well its just a stupid dance so screw it. It was fun anyway but ya i was just shaking i mean we did a lot of crunches and push-ups which are fine with me cuz i like doing them but, i dont know....i've noticed that i've gotten way stronger.

						   im sad. i talked to some people today on the phone, after I slept in the afternoon. I was so tired from all this crap thats going on. I mean, i really only have one major thing i really enjoy is dance, and im not really enjoying that either cuz there is no challenge for me. Im not working. haha, i could apply for a job at publix but I have to wait until after my b-day and i probably wont even apply cuz im way too lazy. Plus school starts on the 9th so I wouldn't have time. hmm...maybe i could go out and skateboard alittle tomarrow. ok well thats my plan, and sleep of course. Theres nothing else todo.Ok well sorry, you must be bored, go read someone else's blog or something cuz nothing interesting is happening here in Sarasota. *sigh*

						   well school was interesting.....i walked into the hallways and went to my locker and put my lunch in there and went to go find my first class....critical thinking, everyone was really quiet, no one talked, but i wanted to talk lol. so anyway...yes a few cute guys...one i know franny would LOVE...nice hair lol. so anyway, my 2nd class was Algebra and, i got grouped up with 3 other girls and one of which i am now friends with. :)  i dont really like the teacher tho. 3rd, was Acting....that was sooooo much fun i loved it! Right when i walked in the auditorium i knew something was going on...and the teacher was on the stage just looking at everyone, so i sat down and we all just waited for other people to come in. Little did we all know was that she was studying our body language to see if we're nervous or not. Then she started like staring at each one of us smiling, and some people just cracked up and some people looked right back at her, like me. So then, after all that, she called us up to the stage...my home!!! j/k lol, so we got in a circle and she said well we're all gonna make the ugliest faces and pass them to eachother..like copying them and stuff....and of course i was next to the guy who had to most expression lol. so ya, it was funny. after that i went to English honors and i almost got lost...i had to walk around the building and it took me forever but i got there and we just talked about the different books we'll be reading and projects. Lunch...i went back to my locker to get my lunch and i went to the cafeteria and looked around for my new friend, but she was no where in sight...but that was okay so i saw this guy sitting alone and he looked like a nice guy so i sat next to him and we talked about alot of stuff and then this other girl sits next to me and then we started talking, and now we're gonna sit together during lunch...we're all from different areas so we all dont know anyone. perfect. so after thaaaaat, i went straight to chorus....and looks like i will NOT be going into advanced chorus because...she started saying...how many of u are not beginner and me and a few people raised our hands(note:i've been singing classical for like forever) and then she started asking if like anyone could read all this music and it just blew my mind...and no one could do it so ya...im better off in the class im in and we did warm ups and these like gothic kids behind me started laughing for no reason, and i started to get mad...c'mon guys, take it seriously. but ya, we just sang scales to see who was alto and who was saprano...i will probably get saprano because i can project my voice loudly while singing a high note, but that alto part is hard. then i went to integrated science, and i have a seat in the back...and that was it, then the last bell rang and i waited for like a half hour for mom to pick me up and i was outside so it was realllllly hot. so ya, i guess it went well, i mean, for the first day of highschool, but i cant wait till Acting tomarrow!

						   read my title.....i wish love could last forever but if that happend alot of people, like myself wouldnt have very much inspiration to write, and no one would really feel anything. Francesca sent me her questions and one really got to me...it was very personal and i couldnt say the whole thing on the survey but, i e-mailed her back on a private e-mail telling her everything. It seems alot of people, are falling in love, and i feel abit, lonely, i mean i know how they feel, honestly i do..but now a days, i just dont feel like.......me. Seriously i've just had the worst of luck this year, besides meeting good friends the whole relationship thing just isnt working. I mean, there was Jeremy, oh god..dont get me started lol, and from him on i really didnt go out with anyone, then cheston and josh came along, what can i say lol...but they were total jerks and i failed to see that until my buddy franny helped me realize. thanx for that. Then ryan, nothing changed,,,that whole rule about not dating your friends came into play. I just didnt feel the same as he felt for me. but, of course we're still great friends. So now here I am, meeting hot 17 year old Alaskan guys while being single at the same time. So im gonna go back to listening to my All-American Rejects cd....right now im listening to Why Worry.....i love this cd, it states exactly how im feeling.

						   Schools about to start on Monday. Its already started for Francesca....so ya, Francesca? how'd it go? Im not sure if i want school to start. I've forgotten everything I 'learned' in math in middle school which totally sucks. But i'll be okay. Yesterday i went shopping AGAIN for a bookbag...and i got this grey messenger one with flare.hehe. Moms helping out at a yard sale again with my neighbors. So she came into my room while i was sleeping and told me that she was leaving.....i heard her...thats weird, cuz usually i dont hear anything when i sleep. Oh ya and i had the weirdest dream last night. Lemme tell you, its taken place in some of those teen horror films.....i was locked in at school.......alone!!! well i wasnt alone......but anyway i was alone!!! and all the lights in the hallways were out!! and all the doors were locked to classrooms so i couldnt go hide in a little corner. so i just basically wonderd around the entire school..alone.....not alone but alone......ya know? :p it was weird but anyway!!!,,,,,,,im tired and i hate summer, every year something bad happens, or i just dont like it. I want to be with my best buddy franny, i didnt get to visit....but, there will be times where i will get to, so ya. um............deidra called....i think you can figure that out for yourselves. bragging,,,,,yucky. i know shes like excited and all but she doesnt have to rub it in!!! i've always wanted to go to school in ny....i still kinda do. for designing stuff. or just something. omg and guess what!!! i got All American Rejects cd, okay well its not that exciting>im just trying to sound like im excited when i write stuff lol. okay well i'll probably post later, im gonna go watch Ellen Deghenerouselakjdf;laskdjfs; however you spell her name cuz shes funny. and oh ya did anyone watch that blue collar tv?, they had Ron White as special guest...omg he's sooooo frikkin funny...cuz every stand-up i watch of him, he always has a cigarette in one hand and a scotch in the other!!>>>haha

						   yep, like franny, i as well went to orientation at my future highschool. alot of people knew eachother.....ya that sucked. but, they had the drumline playin and it made me wanna boogie but i contained myself lol. but then they had you know those rule things.then i got my schedule...not in order: critical thinking English Honors Acting 1 integrated science English honor chorus......anyting else....hmmm i dunno, but i bought a shirt there, for like a game or something cuz dad loves going to games. And we took a tour of the school and i saw were my classes were.....and francesca dont worry, i stuck out too, but i talked with a few people, then moved on. oh ya and we had seniors give us the tour but before we left the classroom they asked 'well are you guys excited about the new year?' and we're all like shrugging our shoulders and saying'not reallllly' lol they were like 'cmon guys your freshman that should be exciting.'---ya we're freshman thats exactly why we're not excited lol.but i signed up for Ram Page which is the school newspaper....i'll probably feel like cooper from The Days if anyone saw the last episode. and yep, i got acting...so im happy about that...something alil new. okay well im gonna go....i havent gotten my bag yet for school....im getting like a roxy messenger bag, i love messenger bags...they're more fun.

High schools coming up soon, frannys is like in 3 days....mines in 7.
