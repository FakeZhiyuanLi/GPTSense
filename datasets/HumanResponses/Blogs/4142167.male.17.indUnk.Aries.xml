      Does anyone ever wonder what it would be like to be confined to the same 20 square foot space for the rest of your natural life? I think it would be boring.  Also, i feel that the root of all problems branches from the inability of most people to keep the trunks of their cars empty. This leaves much to be desired. (if u dont catch what is so cool about those sentances, think tree)  GIANT PANDAS  o, and that bag of skittle does not count toward your bundle deal.  leahciM

      Once upon a time in a hole under a bridge somewhere in madagascar there lived a troll named Urthor. Urthor was no ordinary troll, being just bigger than the average great dane. He did, however, have quite a knack for croquet. Unfortunately trolls were barred from croquet tournaments (for various reasons, the foremost being their smell). Also there were no troll croquet tournaments since most trolls enjoyed attacking other trolls with their mallets rather than playing a nice game of croquet.  to be coninued i guess. i sitll just dont feel like writing.

      What in gods name is going on. This blog has apparently eaten my last post, then threw it up all over the other blog.... I am most definately going to have to chain this guy up for a week now. The other blog is never going to be the same... right now it is currently in the corner shuddering violently. Thats odd.  Has anyone ever wondered about why people wonder so much? Why is it that everytime i have extra time i wonder? I wonder why this is. This is a wonderful topic to ponder, if you happen to have some time to reflect. Wondrous things could happen to a man or woman if they were able to figure out this quandry.  No, im sorry, The Big Bounce is no longer available for the dollar credit.  leahciM

      Someone once told me that "familiarity breeds insecurity." I think he was high or something, but it makes a lot of sense. Cuz like right now, i know all there is to know about this blog, its movements, its speach patterns, even its favorite food (yams). And all i can do is worry about the fact that i know it is so flawed. And yet... i find myself irresistably attracted to posting on it time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time again. Well maybe not that much.  THE LONGEST RUNON SENTENCE I CAN COME UP WITH  Once upon a time there was a man who was looking for a cart which had many golden diadems on it which glowed brightly in the moonlight on days that start the letter "T" and the cart had also two wheels which carried it along the cart path which was long and windy and rugged and stuff.  Wowee that was fun. Anyway it seems apparent that even the squirrels have to sleep, which is a good thing because i dont think i could deal with there scheming this late. Although their flying brethren are of the nocturnal sort, they only do light air recon, nothing to worry about. I will have the death sentrys posted by the end of this week so that should deal with my little... "infestation"  Ill go check the box for you  leahciM

      ok its time to give the randonimity a couple days break, im gonna start trying too hard soon and its gonna screw it to hell. so ima make a new blog, with a more real basis... not as serious as the last one, but it should make some semblance of sense.  no... hidalgo is not guaranteed in stock...  leahciM

      I really like pizza. Although the present piece has a few too many mushrooms to truly constitute the euphoric experience i was looking for, it is quite good. O and the squirrels have retreated back to the forest to set up their next plan of action.  we can hold a movie for you for an hour  leahciM

      Ok guys, sorry bout this but i gotta make one thats not entirely random so amanda can have SOMETHING to comment on.... o who am i kidding, just looking at the title of this blog makes me go into an epileptic fit wherein all i can do is spew forth random things...  Have you ever watched a squirrel? i mean REALLY watched one. They are buggery lil fellers. I can see the plans they are forming in there little mind, almost like watching someones brain. All they ever want is to get on that damn feeder, and are constantly finding new ways to do so. I think the whole human race could take a page out of the squirrels book, and learn to adapt.  All movies in VHS video library are only 1.99, 2.11 with tax  leahciM

      I would just like to point out something about the road that this blog has been traveling down. It appears that the northern side of the road is covered with a wierd bluish greenish muavish moss that can only be the lost moss of atlantis.  But on the other hand, things like that are all to common.  Yes, starsky and hutch comes highly recommended.  leahciM

      I do not know what to do.... it seems that a true travishamockery has occured. i have seen the lemurs, and they were beautiful... but... they were imprisoned like simple monkeys in the cage at that fair. We must rescue them. All of us half-naked, standing bloggers have an obligation, nay, a moral responsibility to save these lemurs. so someone must threaten the life of whoever organizes the 4-h fairs and get them to release these lemurs into the forest at my house.... so i can keep a close eye on them.  Please people, no more than 6 movies at a time  leahciM

      Yes... the time is right... the time has come for all of us half-naked, chair dwelling bloggers to rise up out of our chairs and TYPE STANDING UP!!  The reasons for this are manifold, and i will spell them out.  ONE: no more spider veins from our legs being bent!  TWO: it is different, and as gothic people can attest, different is GOOD.  THREE: because my blog is better than your blog  If these three things are not enough to get you to rise up out of your chair and type standing up, consider the following TRUE* story:  A man named jose was sitting down typing his blog when suddenly he died.  WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED???!?!??!!!?!?!?  o, and we are all out of hidalgo... sorry  leahciM  *ok not entirely true, but it could have happened!

      Ok as some of you may have noticed my other blog is gone... and i know all of you are asking why in the name of all that is holy did u delete it?  WELL... for your information i did not delete it. This blog went a little insane and violently attacked it with a rabbits foot. And no, it did not shoot to maim. So there goes that.  And as for you alex, i hope you become hopelessly addicted to this blog so that without a new post at least once a week or so you will go crazy upon which time i will be able to control you through the use of this blog... or something like that.  (ok seriously tho? the other blog cause a few problems and i thought... screw it. o and i dont think im gonna do a serious one again... that road is currently under repairs)  your movies will be due back tuesday by midnight  leahciM

      Ok just got done with the other road, but it sucks.... so im going back to this one and... O! hey look its my blog lying there twitching uncontrollably... apparently it cannot go for more than 5 minutes without a post.... this may be a problem. Luckily this will bring it around... wherever that is.  someone cover that damn antelope...  leahciM

      Ok so this blog got tired and collapsed in a heap on the side which is that of randonimity, craziness, and an utter lack of purpose. In other words ill make a different, more serious blog... seperately.  Ok so i went bowling tonight and it quickly became a game of "see who can make up the best comments with sexual undertones."  heres a quick play by play review  -"Hey alex! Rub my balls for good luck!" -"I have been thrusting my balls down this ally for over two hours... nice stamina eh?" -"Haha... u have blue balls!" -"Where's my damn salad?" -"I thrust my balls so well that i can score mutiple times in rapid succession!" -"I've seen many people get their balls stuck in the alley"  and so on and so on... it was great....  leahciM

      Alrighty, gotta make the first one funny, cuz after this i got a feeling its gonna get mighty serious for a while. Which sucks, cuz serious isnt always fun, which is always fun instead. The time comes in every blogs existance when it must decide which route to follow, the serious one, or the absolutely hysterical, im falling down the stairs with laughter one. Mine follows neither. Mine does a barbarian's leap (ok so only 1% of you (aka alex) out there get this, well trust me, it makes sense) from one to another, soundly trouncing reason and sanity while its at it. So have fun.... except when im serious, cuz fun and serious violently react.                                                                           leahciM

      Ok, here it is. For those who arent in the know, this is gonna be a blog dedicated to the quest of the squirrels behind my house to reach the feeder.  First you must realize that this is no ordinary feeder. This feeder is 6 feet long, handmade, with a god-forsaken thatched roof. I kid you not.  And the squirrels want it.  In all honesty, they have no problems whatsoever getting up there, but thats not much fun is it?  so heres a list of characters.  Gus- This is a flying squirrel, who wears goggels. And is mentally retarded. Jose- This guy is in charge of the squirrel underground, and wants the feeder for his own purposes. Dorothy- Leader of the squirrels, she has made it her lifos goal to reach the feeders seedy goodness. Joe "Lucky" Shmoe- Called lucky because of the 37 bb gun wounds he has sustained, he is missing an eye, half his tail, and most of his hair. Also his buttock is 72.47% metal.  Ok, ill edit this as i think of more stuff, hows it sounding so far?

      I just wanted to tell everyone that i do know how to spell. I know that diserve is actually deserve, and on and on.  These spelling errors are out of impatience, not ignorance, and i just wanted everyone to know that i am not a moron.  Thank you.  Michael

      Well apparently all of you out there are allergic to comments (which isnt fair cuz i havnt commented on any of gus's posts recently, and i believe many of them diserve something), because i was hoping for something, good or bad, about that poem. I do know that alex thinks it is the shit, and kevin and chelsea dont understand it (simple minded people... pshaw).  So i implore all of you to comment on it, and tell me how it is, thank you kindly.  O and ima be revising it soon cuz there a few lines i dont think flow (specially that one aobut shakespear and poe, its just kinda there)  So anyway, i will cya all around  Michael

      Well I was reading my book, Hyperion, earlier and felt kinda inspired to write a lil something... and it turned out to be pretty cool, least to me. I dunno, tell me what u think:  The Muse  It is lost. The muse, the rhyme, the Word. All gone in the blink of an eye. Man has sought for eternity, yet few have, or will, find. The Bard found It- as did Poe. But can something that one never had truly be lost-and therefore found? Can that which never was be sought after? Reason says no. Yet millions toil daily in search.  It is around for fleeting moments, yet a lifetime It encompasses. It is only present when one, one with a gift, one can coerce It to their medium. It exists- then ceases to be.  It is power. Power to explore, to create, to destroy. Power to be as God, in His omnipotence.  It is freedom. In it one can rest in utter tranquility. Once can lose themself in relaxation, reach nirvana, find peace.  It is death. It consumes the soul- the soul that seeks, but cannot find.  It is perfection. A flawless glory unto itself. More than the flawed normality of common art.  This is why It is sought after. This is why It is not found.  Those seeking It for themselves will never find. And few seeking It for others will even get a glimpse.  For It is Not.  -Mike  Well i dunno, its pretty crazy. If u dont know what It is, sit down and try to write the PERFECT poem. You will realize what It is, if u truly tried.

      k im bored and feel like writing. Couple groundrules first. -Dont comment on grammer or anything like that, i dont care thats not the point  i guess thats the only rule  ::Mind flowing into a state of freenessicitation::     All this talk of breathing in bowties and bags and such has got me into thinking about my life, where its been and where its now going. I cannot decide what i want to be, where i want to go to college, or anything like that.  This poses a major problem as i do not have a whole lot of time to decide. My mom is like frieking out cuz i dont have any college visits planned out yet and its a big problem.  ok new subject.  The ability to fly would be great. Awesome. Stupendous. That kind of freedom is something that would make me more happy than a bug in a rug. Or a dog with a 300 lb bone and a lot more than 10-13 years to work on it. Or something like that. Anyway freedom would be great. My parents are currently suppressing me in a way that i find claustrophobic. Since they own my car i have to listen to them for fear of getting that taken away. Since i live under their roof i have an obligation to do whatever they say for whatever reason they say it. This would not be such a problem if they werent so damn crazy. And i mean the "IM STUCK IN A GLASS BOX OF EMOTION" kind of crazy. So my life is essentially a stream of endless tasks that they wish i would perform.  I am also never good enough for them. I can get great grades, change my entire life so i dont smoke/drink/do drugs, and even get a job and they still arent happy. My grades could be better. I sleep into late. My job sucks (ok so they are right about that one, but still). And on and on and on and on and on and on. It drives me up the friggan wall.  Why is it that i still just dont feel like writing. When i first made this blog it was all i could do not to sit in front of my computer (half-naked mind you) and just write and write and write. Maybe its the fact that no matter how much i want to be a writer i constantly see examples of people who arent interested in making it their career yet have a far greater ability with the craft than i do. Maybe its cuz im so upset with my parents. Maybe its nothing like that. Maybe i am just a wacko with too much time on his hands. It doesnt matter.  Ima write a crazy story in the other blog, so tune in.  Mike

      Well, i hate my family. My mother is ridiculous... beyond belief. She grounded me today for saying fucking... im almost an adult for christ's sake. In all fairness the grounding probably wont last, but its still a heap of bullshit.  I dont feel like writing, sorry.  Mike

      Sorry, i needed to move my freewrite. It doesnt belong on the other blog. I actually need to make a blog dedicated to my writing, but im too lazy right now. For the record on my freewrites.... Do not comment on grammer, spelling, or sentance structure. I realize it is shit, but in a freewrite that does not matter. The point is to get something on the paper and let your thoughts flow. No thinking, just typing. That also means no proofreading. I am sorry if i seem kind of naive to think i can be a writer using words like neway and lol, i realize this is not true. I will use abbreviations in most of my posts just out of habit, but once i start writing essays that will change. Yes, i said it, essays. I am crazy. I love writing essays. On anything. As long as they arent being graded, cuz that sucks.  So work sucked. We were far busier than i had anticipated, although it wasnt out of control. The problem is that all the assholes came in today. Which sucks. O and i need another job. Its another week with a measly 12 and a half hours on the schedule. That along with the pay is almost a waste of my time.  So alex, ask ur manager if he wants/needs/can handle another busser. Cuz im his man/guy/dude. Thanks  You stay classy.... world  Michael

      I just read Theresa's post, and it got me to want to write poetry again. I used to write all the time, but not ne more. This will probably be more of a free write, and not all that random anyway so deal with it. this blog is tired, confused, and no longer foaming at the mouth (and it is unarmed since i took away the rabbits foot) I usually only write when something hits me... call it inspiration, fate, karma, whatever u feel like, but the fact of the matter is that without some leaping point, some proverbial diving board, i will get nowhere with my craft (in case anyone is wondering writing is at the top of the shit heap when it comes to what im thinking about doing with my life). So ive decided that my lil "thing" is gonna be the thing that i need to write about in the first place.... inspiration.  Inspiration comes in many forms. First and foremost there is what i like to call "wham". This is when something hits u in such a fashion that it is crystal clear, and there is nothing u would want more than to express that idea in some artistic manner ( i personally have found myself almost in a state of depression over the fact that a paint brush in my hand is about as useless as a glove on my foot). I write, or used to neway. I now have a lil book i take around with me just in case i ever get a wham, and need to write something down. IMO everyone should do this. It is really enlightening, for some obscure reason.  Another way people are inspire is through other people. Whether it be heroism, sadism (which i dont know if it is a word but think sadistic with it guys), or just the simple act of being nice, other people are oftentimes the most influential factor in inspiration. For example, when the whole 9/11 thing happened more people than i can name where struck with a sense of pride in their country when they saw all the men and women who toild endlessly to clear the rubble that was once the symbol of our great nations power, all to save a person or two who might or might not have been alive under all that twisted metal.  A third form of inspiration is that of the divine. This is rare, almost nonexistant, although if one could believe everything they hear they would think this happens with regularity. Why so many people will go out of there way to fake divine inspiration is beyond me, but i personally do wish that god would talk in a more clear and understandable manner than he does now. It is a very rare occurance when i am even aware he is there.  I hate freewriting.

      Well amanda wanted me to make a blog about her, and its much better that i do one here than on the other blog i have, cuz  that blog tends to warp things.  Apparently Amanda is under the impression that she is very interesting. Whether or not that is true is upto you to decide i guess, but i cannot think of anything to write about here... lol im just messin amanda. Your a great person and i could probably type until my fingers fell off about you, but i dont think many people would be too interested in my feelings for you.  Suffice it to say that i am quite happy with the current situation and really cant wait to spend time with her.  Michael

      Its been a whole two days since amanda and i started going out, its our record... lol. That means that everyone should buy me something pretty... so i can give to her.... u know... not pawn it or nething like that... no.... stewpid noobs. Anyway today work wasnt all that bad. I was on register pretty much the entire time. That is 100% better than running returns or straightening. I did have to straighten the entire dvd categories but it wasnt so bad cuz i knew when i was done i would be able to go. O and on my lunch break i had 2 cheesy gordita crunches, a side of jalepenos, and a small soda (Sierra Dew, or Mountain Mist, whichever u prefer), in case anyone was wondering.  My parents have not said nething to me about last nights fiasco, which is a good thing. I was afraid i would never see the light of day till i was 18. Unfortunately for abby, it appears to be that way for her. O well, stuff like that happens.  I gotta work tomorrow same hours, it shouldnt be too bad, sundays usually arent. But since the fair is gone we will be more busy so im not real sure what to expect.  Im going to church in the morning, first time in 2 months or so. I feel really bad because i used to be a pretty pious person, but anymore im the antithesis of that. Its actually an issue im struggling quite severely with right now, because a lot of things have happend that have made me doubt everything i was raised to believe, and i do not know what to do about it. Eh, such is life. I havnt stayed up thinking about the meaning of life in about a year now, so that is good, i used to not be able to sleep about twice a week because i would get so stressed out about what happens after people die. Anymore its not like that, i keep myself busy until i pass out from exhaustion.  Wow... i just realized something. The whole reason i read at night is so i keep those thoughts out of my head. I never used to read, but now i cannot go to bed without at least 5 or 6 pages under my belt for the night. And i just realized why. Who said blogs were pointless.  Although i must say the idea of a diary that anyone can read makes me a little uneasy, i guess people just have to speak their minds sometimes in order to clear things up with themselves.  Stay cool people.  Michael  O... and i got a quesion for everyone, how does a blog dedicated 100% to the quest of the squirrels to reach the feeder sound? Im thinking it might be fun.... as long as i can stay creative. adios
