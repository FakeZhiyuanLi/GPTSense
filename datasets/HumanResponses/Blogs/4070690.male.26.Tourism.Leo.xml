      It's 5:22 AM, this is my second post of the night (morning). (now it's 5:23) I want to talk about the phallus. I want to talk about it in relation to sound. For the last few nights in front of the house I live in there has been a man (boy) who shoots up and down McKinley (the street I live on) at about 1:30 AM on an unmuffled, motorized skooter. This, to say the least, is incredibly annoying. I am always awake at this time. In fact today I was wandering up to the 7-11 to get 2 22oz bottles of Mickeys, which I downed entirely too quickly. But, the fact remains that, for those people who are trying to sleep this must be about the most annoying thing imaginable. The sound is incredibly high pitched. More so than a Honda Civic with glass packs. The sound resembles a weedwacker more than anything else.     Hi. Just stop for a second and imagine what you would do if you lived in a house with no air conditioning, in the middle of the city, where you had to keep your windows open to even THINK about sleep, and a person was running up and down the street in front of your house with an amplified weed wacker. Not very positive. Nope. So, this brings me to the real question: why do people do things like this?     I have a theory. I was recently characterized as a guy who makes theories. I can't remember the exact wording but that was the jist of it. It made me feel like a crackpot, someone in a Philip K. Dick novel, but that's OK. I've been thinking about it and that's what I do. I come up with theories. That's about all I do. The practical side of things bores me unless I have enough speed. So, anyhow my theory, which I had actually formulated goes about as follows:     Men, as in Guy guys, if you know what I mean, men whose goal is to spread their seed and their "essence" (web of power and connections) far and wide use sound to fulfill this. There is something about sound and the captive audience that just intrigues a man. I mean, I like to crank my music as much as the next music lover, but there is a step beyond love of music where the main goal is to impinge on another person's auditory space. It is a form of personal (sexual) imperialism if you don't mind my saying so. The guyguy aspect of sexuality is about spreading out, about spreading seed and power as wide as possible in order to maximize the imprint that is made either genetically or through the ego. This seems to me to be the only way to explain phenomena like glasspacks and the annoying skooter the kid who rides down my street at 1:30 AM has. It is an expansive act, like that of writing a tag on a wall. Granted there is a lot of  urlLink amazing graffiti  around, but the basic tag is a way to expand and multiply the self, to make a mark if you will, to emulate the genetic expansiveness of the orgy in a textual manner. Some is part of a larger semiotic system, such as a gang sign, which is a turf marker, but the individual's tag is part of an individual semiotic system, also a system of power, and, to some extent, of territorial markings. Not necessarily a territory of space but an ego terrotory if you will. It is an expansiveness past protocol. A transgression that yields its own evidence.

      this isn't the first time i've tried this. i had a blog a little bit ago on my site ( urlLink questioning.info ) but i decided that silence was the best communication. So i left my site as a manufactured space. It is formed emptiness. Or, to be more concrete it is questions. Questions I have formulated in such a way that they do not lead you to answers. So, to the best of my ability I have manufactured an emptiness for you the reader/interactor to fill with your perspective. I'm presumptious enough to call my site an artwork. It is an artwork in the sense of  urlLink Komar and Melamid's artworks . It is an artwork based on a minimal amount of creativity. The creativity it entails is basically a form of creating a collection. In a way this makes Q&A the ultimate capitalist artwork. It is beyond DJing in it's simplicity. The DJ collects records and arranges them in such a way as to create (sometimes) beautiful music. My web based thingy (artwork, if you don't mind my presumption) does not entail the mixing element. Borges, in one of his essays, considers genius the ability to organize already created elements in a novel way. If I remember correctly Borges does not really believe in any other kind of novelty. All thoughts have been thought. All new forms are based on the novelty and meaningfulness of the patterns one can arrange the forms into. With Q&amp;A there is no arranging. I created a set form for people to fill. So far, aside from the fact that I don't have many people interacting with it, it has gone as well as, if not better than planned. It was created as a way for me to learn the basics of DB programming, which I did. And I also saw a few other perspectives and articulations. I would like to get more perspectives. I would like to get more thoughts that are far from my own. What I have so far on the site betrays a certain ennui, a certain jaded relationship with authoritative structures. This is awesome. I am worried, however, that possibly either the way the questions were written or the user's reading of the previous answers is homogenizing the responses. This is the worst thing that can happen.
