      A believer receives God's forgiveness when he repents his sin and places his faith in Jesus Christ for salvation -- all of his sins are forgiven forever. That includes past, present and future, big or small. Jesus died to pay the penalty for all of our sins, and once they are forgiven, they are all forgiven. However, when we stumble, we are called to confess our sins - "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness". Yes, Christians do sin, but the Christian life is not to be identified by a life of sin. Believers are a new creation. We have the Holy Spirit in us producing good fruit. A Christian life should be a changed life. A person who claims to be a believer yet continually lives a life that says otherwise should question the genuineness of his faith. Christians are forgiven no matter how many times they sin, but at the same time, Christians should live a progressively more holy life as they grow closer to Christ.   Christians continue to sin after they are saved - we will not be free from sin until we die or Jesus comes back. However, becoming a Christian results in a changed life. A person will go from producing the acts of the flesh to producing the fruits of the Spirit. This change does not happen instantly, but it does happen over time. Paul tells us, "And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God".

      God hates sin, but He loves the sinner. The price for God's forgiveness is high, but He paid the price Himself. By Christ's loving act of grace, believers are eternally freed from the penalty and guilt of sin. Once we're covered by the Blood of Christ, God doesn't keep a record of our sins. Our forgiveness is total and complete.   "Blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven, who sins are covered. Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord doesn't count against him and in whose spirit is no deceit" (Psalm 32:1-2).   "I, even I, am he who blots out your transgressions, for my own sake, and remembers your sins no more" (Isaiah 43:25).   "It is possible for the Lord to look at us without seeing our sins because when he forgave us, he removed our sins as far as the east is from the west" (Psalm 103:12).

      Yesterday, I've gone to play at the playground near Miwaza's house with bunch of kids. It was really fun, because our future pastor was playing with us. We played frisby, athletics. And the thing I thought is..." Man! Japan is getting very warm..." Its summer now:( I will never be able to concentrate in studying.. well, our house is three stories, and I'm always at the third floor, and the third floor is really hot. Sometimes over 30'C.  How bout your country? is it very cold, normal, or is it very hot?
