						   ok so im sitting here and i can hear music coming in through my window and i look outside and people are having a church ceremony in the damn baseball diamond behind my house and they have a live band. That's another thing that this village is big on....god. Me myself, i dont believe in god, jesus, the bible or anything of the sort, and i dont have a problem with people who do. But i have a problem when people try and tell me I'm wrong for the things i believe. I am my own person and I can believe whatever i want to believe. Anyways, when i was younger my elementary school was called "Virgil Public School". The school was full of Mennonites from Germany and also Mexican mennonites. They didnt like each other much and one day in the middle of the football field there was a huge brawl between the 2. It got out of hand really and some people got hurt pretty badly while i just sat back and laughed at them all. The sign on the local church says "CH__CH, Whats missing? U R", i find that kinda funny because i dont feel like im missing anything at all, but i guess im missing church? oh well

						   So like i said in my earlier posts i ride bikes..it's my true passion.. I even tattoo'd it on my body     Only picture i could find right now... it's healed now so i will get some new pictures  anyways.. back to what i was gonna talk about.. riding. So the other day i was riding at the skatepark and i was the only kid on a bike and there were 4 or 5 skaters there. I'm riding just minding my own business.. i have more skill then the average person when it comes to bikes and skaters dont seem to like that. I guess they think im trying to show them up or something, i really have no idea. So the other day im riding down the box at the park when one of the skaters cuts infront of me and says *I* cut him off...hes yellin at me and all this shit and im just ignoring him....until he whips his skateboard at me and cuts my leg open. I jumped off my bike and grabed the piece of shit. He punched me once in the shoulder and then i punched him right across his face. By the time he got up i had continued riding... unbelievable how ignorant some people can be. Yesterday for instance i was riding over to the park and there were 6 skaters walking to their car...they just had to drive by 3 times to flip me off and yell such things as "fuck you" and "eat shit" to me... ahhh well thats life eh

						   Hello all, I'm here to tell you about my wonderful experiences of living in Virgil. I'll keep you up to date on all the local events and whatnot. What? So you have never heard of Virgil? ..... figures.... if you don't live in Virgil, you usually don't have a clue where it is. Virgil is a small town in southern Ontario... wait scratch that.... It's not even a town, it's a "Village". The Wonderful Village of Virgil. Kinda has a nice ring to it, eh? Well guess what? Living here absolutely sucks. We have an old rundown skatepark (ill get pictures), a grocery store, 2 arenas (ill get to this later), a pizza place and that's about it. The local high school is full of fools so I switched to a school out of town 2 years ago. Back to the arenas...this town is full of jocks and skaters and I cant stand it. If you don't play hockey or lacrosse or skateboards you have dick all to do. All the money in the town goes towards funding these sports. Since there is nothin to do around here I started riding about 6 or 7 years ago. I constantly get harassed at the skatepark by the skaters but I've learned to ignore them. 2 weeks ago I got in a fight with one... he threw his board at me and cut my leg open, I knocked him out... that was interesting. Anyways ill share more later, i gotta grab some breakfast adnd get this day started later all
