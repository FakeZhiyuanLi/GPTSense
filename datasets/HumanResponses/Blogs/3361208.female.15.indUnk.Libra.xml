      Wow. I don't know what my problem is.. Well, I have many but I mean my one with guys. It sucks. Okay I have a boyfriend right. Well, I have an x right. Well, I haven't seen my boyfriend since 2 fridays ago and it sucks. I saw an x at Kings Islad just the other day and now I like him again. I had a dream about him last night too. I don't know whats wrong with me. I went out with this other guy before and I eneded up breaking up with him. I know that he probably doesn't like me anymore but it's so weird. I just want him so bad. I'm not sure about my boyfriend anymore. I can't act weird around him. How unfun is that! Well, GR! This sucks. I hate having mixed emotions. I think that I might tell my x and se what he thinks about it. And if my boyfriend ever gets enough time to call me or talk to me then I'll talk to him about it too. I hate this!!!!!! Help me if you can!! PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!

        Today is a beautiful day. It started raining a little while ago. I love it. It's so calming to me. I like to listen to it fall and hit the windows. This is the time where I think the most about stuff. When it's raining. Tomorrow I'm going to PKI. It's gonna be fun. I kinda hope it rains but then again not cus i wanna actually get to ride my rides. But i also like to play in the rain alot. I just hope i have fun. I need a break from working. It's been tough. This whole Summer Vacation so far has been nothing but work for me. Gr! O'well. Lets not get in a bad mood now. Well, I'm goin now so I'll write later. Fairwell!

        I met Doug Robb,  from my favorite band Hoobastank, today!!!!! It was so awesome. I'm still in shock. I mean it's not every day that u meet a celebrity; especially one that is the lead singer in your favorite band! AHHH! I'm soooo happy! I went to the radio station and he was there! He asked "What's your name?" So I'm like "Julie!" and he asked "How old are you?" And I said "15" He's like "You look like ur 18" I giggled (haha) and he signed my cd. Then he said "Well, thanks for bein such a good fan and listening to our music." i said "Thank you so much for actually signing this. Hoobastank will be my favorite forever" then he left! It was the greatest day ever! He smelled so good too! I was kinda disapointed that the rest of the band wasnt there but whutever! I MET DOUGLAS ROBB!!!!!!!! I can still smell the marker on the cd! Wow. I'm so like.. wow! This is such a great day. Wow! I'm gonna be dreamin about this for a long time to come! AHHHH! This is so awesome. I wanna relive that moment a million times!! Well, i'm gonna go smell my cd some more! Haha! BYE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

        Hello everybody! Today, suprisingly, wasn't that bad. I got on the bus and talked to Kyla (bff-lil sis) about her Dinner Dance. I was very disapointed that she went with Trey... she can get better. Like i want her to go out with this boy Marty, they're friends and he is alot nicer than any other boy she knows.. at least i think. According to her she had a great time and it was awesome. I was happy for her. I got to school and ran up to Tanya to give her a huge hug cus she had been suspended and i hadnt seen her in a while. We went to the pop macheines and Brittany did too. Brittany's a really funny person. Well, we were walkin down the hall and i saw Chris so i started walkin with him. His leg was still hurtin him from baseball. O'yea, well Chris is my b/f.. hes a really nice guy and has everything going for him. He is really smart and from whut i hear he is a ReAlly good baseball player. Well later after 1st period, we kissed for the first time. Lets just say i didnt hate it. Well, during 2nd, me and Cydni talked and worked on sum stupid review for our final on thursday. In 3rd i talked to Licia (my twin haha) and she told me about some hipicritical thing that was really confusing me so i kinda tuned out a bit. Then she asked me about me cuttin myself. I didnt wanna explain things to her, so i just told her that it was a cat. Of corse she didnt believe me. She said in a note "well u can just call and whine to me next time u need to talk about something" i thought that was really nice. Shes a good friend. Then i talked to Donald about all kinds of stuff. Hes a cool guy but really perverted. He's my "daddy" and "god". Yea, pretty weird. Lunch was pretty boring. On to 4th. Thats another class that i have with Chris. Its kinda fun if u subtract the teacher and the work (haha). We're a really rowdy class. I hafta do some stupid make-up crap tonight so i can get my grade up. At least i dont hafta take a final in that class. On the bus it was fun. Kyle kept on lookin down Kyla's shirt(haha) and i kept yellin at him. Then he told me about his cuzin dying yesterday in a wreck. that pretty sad. Kyla took the last picture on her camera so she can get them developed soon. Her mom is coming up from Georgia Wendsday for her 8th Grade Graduation. Thats cool. She don't get to see her alot. Then she'll leave and come back up later in the summer. AH! only 4 more dumbass days of school left! HELL YEAH! Crap, i just memberd that my dad's b-day is thursday.. i need to get him sumthin.. well, i'm gonna go now and munch on sum grindage! later!

        Hello! Today was a very boring day. I sat around and ate. I don't know why, but when I'm bored i eat. Pittiful. I've been thinking alot lately. About mostly my two "best friends" Manda and Jessie. I really don't know how strong our bond is. I mean, sure I like to hang out with them and stuff and they know everything about me, but sometimes I just wonder why I bother. Lets start with Manda. I've known her for about 4 years. We started out just talkin and next thing i knew i was at her house every weekend. Ever since we've been in highschool though, it seems that we're drifting apart. She's involved in all this after school stuff and i just go home. Theres also this girl Caitlin. Her and Manda have been hangin out alot. I dont have a problem with that really, its just that i feel manda is startin to forget her other friendships. And Caitlin talks about me behind my back so I'm not really her biggest fan.. haha. Manda forgets alot I guess. Like a couple weekends ago, at school she kept on sayin "we're goin to see a movie tonight okay Julie" she said it like 7 times. After school I sat and waited for her to call and tell me the whole plan and everything... she didnt call. I called her and get this.. she was on her way to go to the movies with Caitlin and Justin (x-b/f). I mean i wouldnt have been very mad but she didnt even bother to tell me. Stuff like that she does really ticks me off. Jessie, on the other hand, i've known all my life. Shes always been there for me. Theres nothing really wrong with me and her. I get kinda jelous sometimes though. I mean I'm only human. Shes so beautiful and she just doesnt see it. She also has a pretty good relationship with her 4 sisters and her parents. I've just wanted that for so long, but all that ever goes on in this house is fighting. I've been thinkin alot and i think that I might just stop callin manda and jess. I mean i'm the only one that trys to keep in contact since we have no classes together. I have a feeling that i'm just waiting for something new and different to come into my life.. but i cant find it... I hope i find it soon though.. well, i'm goin to take a shower cus tomorrow starts the last week of hell.. i mean school.
