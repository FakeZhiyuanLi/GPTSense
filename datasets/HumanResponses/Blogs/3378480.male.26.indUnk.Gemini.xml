      This game I found in an educational store, so that must mean it is boring, right? Well, the theme isn't the funnest in the world, but the game is actually pretty fun.  Each player is trying to set up a 10 day trip by walking, driving or flying. You can move to another state next to a state by walking. By driving, it allows you to skip one full state. Flying, is even better, allowing you to fly to different states of the same color as the airplane's color.  There is a lot of luck in playing this game. After each player takes cards one by one to fill their iternery (as I like to call it,) players take turns drawing a card from one of the 3 face up piles or the face down draw pile and then the card drawn is discarded into one of the 3 face up piles or takes the place of one of the days, and the card replaced gets put in one of the three discard piles. There always have to be a card in each face up discard pile, so if you take the last card from a pile, you must place the one you replace it with in the same pile.  How you set up your cards in the beginning is key to the game, since you can never move your cards during the game, except by placing a card you want to move onto the discard pile and hoping the other players don't cover it up before you can pick it up and put it on another day.  The game plays quickly and usually the hard part is getting the last state you need. It can get pretty competitve at times and you probably will have to change directions sometimes to get what you need.  I think this game fits well as a "filler game" and especially as an educational game for our youth. They'll much rather learn their states and capitals from this game than any other way.

                     When someone invents a boardgame, they should seek out  this game first (if they have not played it already) and then design a game that  meets the goals of this game.       &nbsp;    These goals include:      &nbsp;     1.   Playable with any number of  players (2-6*) (*6 players with the expansions)      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not only is it playable with different  amount of players, but it is a complete and different experience with varying  players.      &nbsp;     2.   Easy to learn, simple to  teach      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It takes less than 5 minutes to teach  this game.      &nbsp;     3. Great amount of strategy      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the strategy level is high, it  only takes a game to fully understand the strategy involved in the  game.      &nbsp;     4. Different game every time you  play      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The game is never the same two games in  a row. It seems fresh every you play it.      &nbsp;     5. Players do not feel out of the game at any  time      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can change the outcome of the game  on the last turn and almost every turn you do something that is  important.      &nbsp;     6. The game moves at a good  pace      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turns usually are not very long and it  doesn't take long to see all of the different moves you can take in a  turn.    &nbsp;     7. The basic game costs&nbsp;$20 and the  expansions cost around $13      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't say much more than  that.    &nbsp;    So what do you do in Carcassonne? Each player uses the  tiles he&nbsp;or she has in their hand&nbsp;or the tile that they&nbsp;just drew  and plays it next to a tile that is already&nbsp;in play. Sounds easy enough?  The tricky part is the fact that a tile&nbsp;can have one or more of&nbsp;the  following:&nbsp;city, road, farm,&nbsp;and/or monastery.The tile played must  connect in all ways to the tile(s) is next to. That means all city parts must  match with city parts and the same for roads. Farms surround cities and roads  so&nbsp;the farm part&nbsp;must match up with the farm parts on the&nbsp;already  played tiles.&nbsp;After you play a&nbsp;tile you may play a follower on that  tile, on one of the parts previously stated. You can only play one follower per  tile.    &nbsp;    What do the followers do?&nbsp;Basically they show your  hold on the city, road, etc. When a city is completed (the walls surround the  city and there is no part of the city without walls) a player scores&nbsp;2  points&nbsp;per tile.) Normally another player cannot play a follower in that  city when you have one in it. A player can play a follower into another city and  connect the two cities together, therefore&nbsp;both of you gain points for both  cities. In fact, if a player cleverly&nbsp;adds more followers in a city than  any other player, he&nbsp;or she gets all the points for that city. Roads work  about the same, except that they are only one point per&nbsp;road and roads are  completed when both ends of the road go into a city, monastery or a crossing, or  if the road makes&nbsp;a complete circle.      &nbsp;    Monasteries&nbsp;only occupy one tile&nbsp;and are not any  bigger than that.&nbsp;Monasteries are completed when you completely  surround&nbsp;them with other tiles. You score one point for the monastery  and&nbsp;each tile surrounding it, which is a total of nine points if  you&nbsp;complete it. Farms are the most difficult to understand at first,  because they are hard to tell where they end.&nbsp;Roads, cities and  monasteries&nbsp;end&nbsp;all farmland.&nbsp;Farms are never completed.&nbsp;At  the end of the game, a player scores 4 points for every completed city that the  farm touches.      &nbsp;    Farms and roads follow the same rules for cities, where  you cannot place a follower in a farm&nbsp;or&nbsp;road that another player has  a follower in. The only way to share farms and roads is to&nbsp;use the same  technique as in&nbsp;cities,&nbsp;by making a new road and connecting to the  road another player has, and the same for farms.      &nbsp;    You only start with seven followers and need to make  good&nbsp;use of them, which means you need to complete your&nbsp;tiles when you  begin to run out of followers to play. Farmers never return to you, so you  cannot farm too much. When you complete a&nbsp;city, road or monastery,&nbsp;not  only do you score points, but you also get all of&nbsp;your followers  back&nbsp;that you played.&nbsp;You may&nbsp;then play them again after you use  them.      &nbsp;    That's&nbsp;pretty much all of the&nbsp;rules for the  game. The strategy is getting the best parts or trying to share as many tiles as  possible to get the most points.      &nbsp;    I love this game and play it a lot with my friends and  family. It is a great introduction to&nbsp;German style games. I&nbsp;would  recommend this game to almost anyone.      &nbsp;    One thing about the original rules I never liked and  thought needed to be changed before I got the game was the&nbsp;fact that the  rules state that every turn,&nbsp;you draw a tile and&nbsp;put it in front of  you, allowing all of the players to help you pick where it should go. This  sounds like it would make it&nbsp;more&nbsp;fun and&nbsp;more like a party game  and maybe it would&nbsp;be somewhat interesting, but I&nbsp;never really  understood it. So, we decided that players kept a hand of 3 tiles and drew a  tile at the end of their turn. This&nbsp;has given the game a little more  strategy and no one feels like the game is too lucky. I would recommend using  this rule instead of the way the rules&nbsp;were written.      &nbsp;    Other than that, the game is one of the best&nbsp;board  games ever made. Everyone should have this game. What are you waiting for? Go  buy it now!  &nbsp;  Rating: 9.5/10    &nbsp;    Other helpful sites:      http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/822       http://kumquat.com/cgi-kumquat/funagain/11110 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

      The last game I bought was called Spy. It's by Reiner Knizia, who is probably the most famous and award-winning German board game designer (in his own country of course, but gaining fame in the states as well.) He has designed between 150 to 200 games, so he has been around the block many, many times.  Spy is a 2 to 4 player card game, which each player is trying to get rid of all of his or her spies. In order to do that, you must play multiple cards with the same kind of symbols. Each card has 2 symbols on them, an item and a continent. There are 12 cards, 6 items and 6 continents that start with one spy on them. When you play your cards, for every card you play with the certain symbol, you put spies equal to the amount of cards played minus the spies on the symbol card that you are playing. For example, if you play 4 Africa cards, and there is only one spy on the Africa card on the table, you put three spies from your pile on the Africa card on the table and discard the ones you played.  Unfortunately this is the only fun part of the game, the rest is repetitive and not very exciting. And the spy laying part only gives you tension when the game is almost over. This game, however, feels like an idea that didn't get enough work or was meant to be aimed toward Americans who like a lot of luck in their games. If it was, it is being sold too expensively for Americans to even consider. Even board game players who reach out of the normal American games (Monopoly, Risk, Scrabble are good examples) would not be too interested in Spy.  So what went wrong? The cards and components are very nice and well done. Their is a little competition but very little player interaction. The theme, which should be the main part of the game, could have been for anything. Reiner Knizia is known for making games that are abstract, with a very small theme tacked on (abstract games are theme less and more puzzle games than anything.) The Spy part of this game seems more tacked on that usual, although I'm sure he came up with it himself.  I don't know how to make this game much better. If there were only 5 continents and 5 items, there would be some more competition but it would make it more luck filled. There doesn't seem to be much of a strategy in this game, except to block your opponent as fast as possible and don't allow your opponents to do the same.  If this game was a little quicker it would have been a good filler game (a filler game is a game to play in between other longer games.) As it is, it's a game I probably will only pull out to teach to new people who aren't discouraged by it yet.

						   It's all or nothing now,  It's all we have left, inside It's my life, it's all my dreams,  And now I got to get it going now  Chorus: And I wanted to say, thank you for another lovely day You're always there for me And I needed to pray, whisper words to you You're always listening to me So here's my words of love...

Bridge: You carry me to every height, you let me see this world you made  And everyone living today, and everyone ever lived,  Wish they knew you, like I know you today,  But I don't know you enough, and it's all i need But I get so distracted by this world, and I can't see your face You're always there for me, you're always whispering my ear You're breaking down the doors, holding them open for me And it's now I'm ready to see, your face shining for me But I want you to know I love you so...

						   Where she sees, is where I am, and there's no one but her who understands Now there's nowhere she cannot become found And I look into her eyes, find the shadows that can't be denied And I wonder if she'll let them slip away, but I can't leave her today  Chorus: Now it's time to show her the way Now it's everything I have to say Now it's this life we need to save I'm just a measure of all she gave  Flashes turn our heads, wondering if we're the next dead But as I give you life, you give me back mine And now I see your eyes, they match my own  (Repeat Chorus)  (Solo)  Bridge: You know me now, oh... Do you know me now? Once we're gone, dead and gone, we're never gone...  (Repeat Chorus x 2)

						   If I saw, the things you do, when you're alone, it'll make me feel just at home, if I prayed, like I do, when you're holding on If I taste all your life, and your eyes, could it make me know what I am missing?  Chorus: I just wanted to let you know that I'm feeling you And I just wanted to say I'm on my way, I'm on my way...  If I bleed, enough to cover the world, I hope I would not miss you now, and the anger, and the sadness falls...  (Repeat Chorus)  Bridge: You wished to see my face, but I turned away from you, But never in anger, just didn't know what I should do...  (Solo)  If I see a way to find you shining and happy always, If I never know what it means to hurt again, it'll because Of you, and now I know you've given me so much and I just keep Dreaming of a world I never ever ever knew, and I float far above Instead of falling, you win me over and over and over into you So let it come down, and take me again and again and again To the place that you know where we begin to see And now I just don't understand but I feel And that's all I need right now  So come with me don't stay Tell all I want to hear Breathe in my ear Tell me it all Lay me down Become me Tonight

Chorus: No one needs to know the way you feel right now No one needs to bother you for these things But now that they are and now that you've seen Won't you give them back to me?  Don't speak the words you told me a million times It's all I know now and it's not going to make this right But don't worry it's not your fault you didn't mean to change And I wondering if you can see the sky now so clear  (Repeat Chorus)  Bridge: It's so clear in my mind but I can't make it out now It's so clear in my life but I can't make it right this time  Won't you stop and listen and know how I feel Cause it won't do you no good going on to bed Without first knowing that I love you and always will And that you don't have to turn away when this is so clear  Won't you give them back to me...
