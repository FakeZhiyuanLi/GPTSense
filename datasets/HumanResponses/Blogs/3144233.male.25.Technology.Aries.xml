       Day Ten:      Well we made it.  Howling wind, driving rain and kung fu bandits. Quite a trip.   We set off for our final thirty mile section feeling suitably dreadful but after covering the first ten miles and a short break it got a little more bearable. It was a long hack with a lot of night walking some of which was on some busy A road.  By the time we saw the signs saying robin hoods bay wasn't too far away we were all feeling a fairly exquisite sense of pain in our feet and knees so it was into zombie mode for the last few miles.   We made quite good time considering our collective states of unwell-being getting in at around six thirty.  It was a shame we couldn't finish as we started, with Jim, but at least it's done. Hope your knee's better soon mate!  We would like to thank everyone who sponsored us and everyone who sent us emails along the way. The encouragement was good for morale.   No doubt we'll see you all soon, until then, take it easy - Ed, Joel, Leo and Ben.

       Day Nine:      Hello!  Waking up this morning wasn't too easy as it was utterly freezing. It stayed pretty cold all day and we got through another hilly part of the trek which again was tough going. We were unwelcomed at this little café in the hills by a tutting woman.  We knew today was going to be a long trip with an extended section into the night. It was hard enough to navigate in darkness but we had thick mist to deal with as well. Joel navigated us through pretty well though and we got to a pub in the middle of nowhere for some food.   We had yet another stage to the walk to get to where we are staying. Odd place but nice enough.  We plan to finish tomorrow evening after another night walk and thirty miles.   See you all soon.

       Day Eight:      Hello!  We woke up this morning in a very nice little camping barn which was more of a flat really it was so well equipped. The very kind Rose ran it and we managed to get most of our kit relatively clean and dry.  We'd have thought that packing in the mornings would be a very quick exercise by now but it has been getting systematically slower and no one can work out why.  Setting off the weather seemed to change it's mind every few minutes by eventually settled on "a bit dull", at least there wasn't much wind and rain. Leo was feeling his legs a bit and everyone was finding it all a little heavy. After around ten miles we got to a village, which seemed a bit like a ghost village as the only sentient life was a cat. We found the village pub and knocked on the door. We're constantly surprised with how nice and helpful people in the grim north are as she let us in, hung up our water proofs and made us tea. After vegetarian paella we headed off again and felt a fair bit better.  The scenery has gone from the stunning hills and views of the lake district to field after field of mud and poo, so it's all a bit of a trudge.     After about 5 miles the bottom fell of my (Ed)'s boot (see picture) and Joel had to get zealous with the duct tape as we only had an atom of super glue left in the tube. We are still unsure about what to do about this but hopefully we can fix it tonight. We have arrived at a campsite, which is fully equipped with tech computers connected to the Internet. Seemed quite strange but I'm glad for it now.  I have a blister the size of Belgium on my toe.  See you all soon.

      Day Seven:     Hello!  Last night we stayed in this ghastly place where we felt as welcome as gangrene. You win some. But we made a good start for the bad weather and even that soon cleared up and it turned into quite a nice day.  We were semi-attacked by a heard of starving llamas at one point but they seemed more interested in Joel than anyone else.  Ben was suffering from quite a nasty toe injury he started to feel last night. He had to go off and find a doctor who gave him a few pills which will hopefully let him carry on the walk. We met up again at the next stop and tried to look for somewhere to stay. We found that the best place would be a barn four extra miles on. After covering twenty miles we weren't keen on the idea but moved on regardless and made in fairly swiftly. "Like ripping off a plaster quickly" as Joel put it. We made it to the barn and it's very nice.  We are eating much better these days; a little more than the two table spoons of rice we've had some nights. We have some crazy plans for the last few days that we are talking over and I might go into them at a later date.  Leo has rod chafing near his "special area".  Ciao.

       Day Six:    Hello all...   Despite having the worst weather since day two we made a good deal of progress covering around twenty three miles, which with blistered feet and heavier packs was quite a push. We were a LITTLE unlucky trying to find somewhere to stay and thought we might have to spend the night in a public toilet but thankfully it was only an hour or so. Obviously our kit is pretty well soaked again but with any luck we will be able to get it dried by tomorrow.   The day was all a little rushed and with the weather so bad we were not able to get a picture for you. Sorry about that.  Leo fell over again and the wind is howling.   Hope to send a better update tomorrow. Tired now!  Speak soon.

       Day Five:      First of all we have a little bad news. Jim has had to quit the walk due to the knee injury we mentioned yesterday. It had only got worse overnight and he soldiered on all morning but by the time we got to the next stop he had a very bad limp and was unable to continue.  Send us a message Jim and we hope you are fit again soon.  Morale was obviously slightly depleted after Jim’s departure but we made some good progress in leaving the Lake District and heading over the flatter land towards the dales. The weather got a little rough again, raining, generally damp and very foggy. Leo fell off a style into a patch of "manure" but was OK after he had cleaned himself up.  We got to the next stop wet and cold just in time to see all the cafes closing. However we were lucky enough to call on a very friendly pub where they agreed to get us all in the one room for a good price. Tonight we have the benefit of a proper hot meal and a warm room.   Speak soon!  P.S. Injury list:   Ed: Cuts to hands Ben: Cuts to hands Joel: Ankle sprain Jim: Knee damage (forced to withdraw) Leo: Ego

       Day Four:       Hello!  This morning we were lucky enough to get a lift back to where we had left off with the very kind Matt and Emma.   With the much better weather we had today we made good time for the nine miles to Patterdale. We then set off to the hilliest part of our entire walk which included the highest peak. It was very hard work but we all seemed to cope quite well.   During the day we suffered a couple of injuries with Ed cutting his hands and Jim having a swollen knee which slowed him up at times. We will see how he is after a night’s sleep and the use of a knee support.   We have found a very nice place to camp wild for the night in a copse of sorts. We hope the rangers don't catch us. We will let you know. We are all very tired after a good eight hours trekking so I’ll say goodnight now.  Speak soon!  P.S. No signal in this woodland so you may get this update a little late.

       Day Three:      Hello again.   All that weather seems to be continuing so another day of soaked kit and lashing rain for us. We are all happy enough though and had some of the best sights so far as we passed on through the Lake District. Some of the terrain can be quite a challenge as streams and paths seem to merge in this climate and climbing up water falls is as difficult as it sounds.  There were a few scary moments as Leo and Ed almost slid off a ledge into a river but managed to scramble to safety. It was fun to have Joel point out our river crossing errors only to immediately fall in himself.   We have taken a slight detour to Ambleside to get to the only place to stay in the area. It’s not the season for campsites and hostels and as camping wild during this stage can get us a one hundred pound fine each we decided to give it a miss.  Ben and Ed's home cooking, some friendly locals and radiators have made up for tramping through bogs and our other hardships.  Speak soon!

       Day Two:   As forecast day two met us with 70mph winds and horizontal rain which made light work of our "water-proofs". It felt like something out of a film about mountaineering. After a very difficult and slightly dangerous 15 miles we made it to the very nice hostel from which we are making this update.  Since several of our group had wet feet we have had to set up here for the night to avoid blisters which would course some serious problems later in the trek.   Ed, Jim, Joel, Leo and Ben.

       Day One:   Sorry for the delay but we're out of signal range for the moment, we're sending this update from a coin-op pc in a hostel.  Day one went very well especially considering having to wake and pack in the freezing dark, we covered a good twenty miles. The main difficulty was the rocky terrain which covered that 5KM under Ennerdale lake. It was more irritating than difficult but slowed us down a little.  Good luck at the end of the day though when we managed to find a barn with a working stove and an experienced hiker to give us some advice about our route for day 2 (thanks Robin). We were all the more grateful for this when we heard the winds howling outside during the night but we knew there would be more in store for day 2...  Speak soon - Ed, Jim, Joel, Leo and Ben.

      Hello everyone...  This is Joel, Ed, The Byrnes and Ben.  We are now setting off for the sponsored walk from St. Bees to Robin Hood's bay, which you may or may not know about.  For more info on the walk see,  urlLink click here .  Some of you have sponsored us some have not but either way you will be receiving progress reports over the next two weeks or so.  Unfortunately not everyone who has sponsored us has got onto this mailing list and so if you know anyone who should be or would like to read the updates please forward them on.  We're in a real rush to catch the 2058 train up to Bristol so that's it for now, well send you an update of progress when we make some :)  Cheers  Bye  P.S. If you would like to wish us luck do so at  urlLink ed@generic.org.uk  or reply to the (hopefully) daily updates.

       Hi  I'm back in Butwol, for the mid term training period held by spw. although we only have 9 weeks left now. This is a really short time in which to do the work we now understand. As plans are taking shape we realise the limitations of this short period of time remaining.   We have elected our five leaders for the school youth club (Green Club) They are great kids and have taken on the responsibilities brilliantly. Our work put into teaching has paid off in terms of trust from the kids. They have already organised there own after school activity. What remains for us now, is to train them up as much as possible in the art of fun learning. In the green club there are seven units. Health, Environment, Out of school Youth, Library, Juniors, Creativity and Games. The principle is to orchestrate activities which blend many or all of these sections. For example a puppet show. This can involve a health related plot theme, litter picking (for building resources, props, stage etc), encouraging out of school enthusiasts to join in, acting, singing for cretivity etc etc. With the help of our nominated guide teacher, the children will soon be able to run their own sustainable youth club once we are gone. Fun creativity and learning. Development bliss I say. However, getting this club on its feet and running properly in 9 weeks or strikes, scholl management squabbles and monsson is going to be a challenge.  We also have to set up community commitees, which I have previously described. It is quite fun to feel ourselves becoming more and more liked and respected in our community. Our mantra must always be catlysing and faciltating  as opposed to doing. Clearly more effective in the long run but quite a challenge.  I saw another snake a few days ago allegedly more poisonous than the cobra, but was a lot smaller. It got into a room on the outside of a neigbours house, and was set upon by a dozen villagers with sticks, I felt quite sorry for the little blighter but couldnt help thinking that i should where my boots when outside at night. Maoisits have apparently blown up ambulances driving on strike days. The combination of power cuts an strikes does not make for hopeful rescue if bitten. Some snake bites here kill in fifteen minutes. Lovely. I would like to see a cobra before I leave, having seen only shed skins. They are pretty big I gather.  My health seems to be improving as i am eating well and excercising again. I am also enjoying very early starts and three washes a day. I am becoming very accustomed to washing at a hand pump in the open outdoors, and have taken to doing so three times a day. When its hot it is the only relief, as there are no swimming pools.   The team dynamics are volatile here, and i find myself playing manager. trying to balance the motivation, with the communication in our team is a consant struggle and is proving to be an important part of my experience. More detail and less tact for those I see on return.  bye  love Joel   From Joel's Napali Adventures.

      Considering this was my first proper day of using this site, I was determined to make a post. Actually, I was determined to make a post about something slightly interesting, but considering that part isn't even nearly finished I thought I'd say how contented I am with the jar of mixed olives I just brought back from the shop.  Sometimes it's the little things you know.     Sometimes I really don't think I could live without olives.

       Half way has come quite fast and in fact passed us now. Our remaining three months of time in which to complete the desired work looks to be interrupted by strikes, training, school holidays and such, which is causing us all to feel a real time pressure.  And as the pressure mounts, we becomre clearer in our objectives, more settled in our daily lives and more thoughtful of life after the Terai. I personally am looking at a short period of volunteer work elsewhere in more northern nepal, where i can experience the other dimension to national life and also give my sel acothe world from which to apply fo a job.   Our work here and now is going well. We are currently establishing ourselves in the school, endearing ourselves to teachers and students, learning to teach english and manage big groups of children in activities and becoming accustome to rising at 0530. After school we have time off inside away from the heat, and from four to seven do community work and planning. The general objectives are to establish some community infrastructure from which significant members can work together to source development change from local NGOs, in the form of traing advice and funding on health, education and aricutural issues. The girls of our team are currently trying to strengthen the weak aammaa's groups around the area. Like the Indian system this involves Social workers and mothers tring to implement basic change amongst the families through the mothers. Currently this is disfuncntional where we are but potentially a great agent for change. Santos and I are looking at trying to improve the sustainability og forest management along canalsides and pondbanks, in the interest of natural resource maintenance and reliable firewood supply for the poor families.   As is the season we are constanly being dragged off into the night to celebrate the wedding ceremony of some pubescents we don't know. Because we are white and so celebrities being seen at weddings is of prestige to the family concerned, and of course everyone is very friendly. Weddings are a curious event and of course are a mix of Indian and Nepali traditions. It involves sitting around waiting to be fed whilst watching young men hurriedly assembling scary framework from which to hang brightly coloured banners. (Things are always late here)   Food when it does come is usually quite good but I am often keen to leave soon after as the only other entertainment is rather diabolical. After the young couple have driven past in a car a procession will follow. This means a band of brass drums, all banging and smashing with no kind of plan, topped by the distorted reverberating sound of a man singing and playing an organ effect on a touch insensitive keyboard. This characteristic cacophony can be heard all over from as early as 0530 at this time of year and is quite dreadful. If I sound terribly parochial, please understand that I do in fact love Hindi music and have recentley discovered Ravi shankar on the Sitar. But back to the procession. Following the man, with his microphone and his maraude you will just about see through the crowd of fascinated on lookers a young nepali boy dressed as a woman, being circled by a handful of bold or inebriated men barely controlling their frustrated impulses.   Speaking of circling we saw a dead buffallo with its organs exposed through its chewed up ribcages smelling like (a dead buffallo)  and about a hundred huge vultures each with a wing span of at least two metres. However when ever we tried to get close to a vulture it squawks and flees scaring the flock away. Cowardly beasts.   Hope this wasnt too boring :)   bye   From Joel's Nepali Adventures.

      Last night a friend of mine was telling me a story about, what seemed to me, a particularly nasty character. The story was followed by his, the character in question’s, justification for his behaviour, which was simply:   ‘Well life’s not fair either.’   Presumably the intent for such a statement is to show that, since life is generally not fair, certain unfair practices are justifiable.   Given that this statement is used relatively often as a justification for unfair practices or behaviour, when it really is nothing of the sort, seems to call for its classification as a fallacy.    The Life’s not Fair Fallacy.    The fallacy is committed when an appeal to the ‘unfairness of life’ is used as a justification for some act or practice. However, the normative status of the practice in question obviously stands irrespective of whether or not similar instances of unfairness happen in the world.    An example:   Lenny bought a car with an engine full of sawdust yesterday. He took it back to the dealer and protested that this was simply not fair. The dealer replied, “well that’s life for you”.   Note:  The Life’s not fair fallacy is a variant of the two wrongs make a right fallacy, however, the former uses a fallacious appeal to common unfairness in life, the latter to another wrong action.   Although it may seem that, an appeal to the unfairness of nature, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, disease and other natural disasters can be used as a reminder that one should not protest at their car being crushed by falling trees, it must be remembered that this is because nature is not in the business of fairness. An appeal to the unfairness of nature, however, may be used in an attempt to justify some human practice or act, in which case, the fallacy is committed.

      It could very well be the case that to indulge in child pornography may satiate the sexual desire of a paedophile and consequentially render that person less of a threat to other people; however, my argument is neutral to this. It merely relies on the fact that if there is greater consumption of such materials and therefore greater production, people will be harmed inherently by this production if not necessarily its consequences.  It is true that bad people could use any tool, absolute liberty included, to do bad things. Yet rational persons would never argue in favour of absolute liberty as it essentially entails a return to the Hobbesian state of nature. The prevention of the negative factors that it is possible for a state of affairs to bring about, by no means necessitates prevention of the positive. This is quite aside from the point that the Freenet tool itself is not specifically what is being challenged here, but the idea that the total and absolute negation of censorship will result, both directly and indirectly, in harm to people. If a tool is created specifically to further this end, then that action is ethically indefensible; or so the argument goes.  The examples of actions given, and asserted as showing the harm principle as unworkable, are, ironically enough, the very kind of actions that this principle seeks to protect. If harm is thought of, as you seem to suggest, as an almost infinitely broad and causally irrespective concept, of course it will be unable to offer rational ethical guidance; but the concept is far more specific, and relates to ideas such as the frustration of autonomy, security, basic human rights etc. So, under the harm principle, as long as your actions do not frustrate these interests in Bill or George (presuming you are not, by these actions, actively and directly defending your own such interests from frustration by these specific individuals), they are perfectly permissible. But of course, a means whereby child pornography, terrorism and other similarly harmful activities are able to operate relatively unhindered, does, directly or indirectly, violate some or all of the core tenets of this principle. It is also worth noting here that the harm principle is neutral to law, politics and economics; it is strictly a foundation of ethics.  I neither hold nor assert that all forms of government control should be tolerated. However, in an attempt to clarify my argument let me ask you to consider the following consequence:     C1 : The unintentional provision of an authority with the ability, but not necessarily the intention, to abuse a power in such a way as to suppress legitimate free speech and distribution of content; two of the most vital means of effective democracy. And secondly, the following two sets of circumstances:     Sc1 : This set of circumstances harms people. In allowing an authority to prevent  Sc1  we unavoidably invoke the consequence  C1 .    Sc2 : This set of circumstances harms people. In allowing an authority to prevent  Sc2  we unavoidably invoke the consequence  C1 . If we simply hold that the consequence  C1  is absolutely unacceptable, then one should assert that both  Sc1  and  Sc2  be tolerated despite the harm they cause to people. However, if one does not believe that such harm to people is worth such an absolute guarantee of free speech and distribution of content then one should assert that both  Sc1  and  Sc2  be authoritatively suppressed.  The following are descriptions as to what these two sets of circumstances are:     A : Child pornography, terrorism, etc. operating through electronic channels.   B : The acts of rape and murder. I will let it remain unclear however, as to which set of circumstances ( Sc1  or  Sc2 ) definitions  A  or  B  pertain.

       P1: Total and absolute free flow of information will result in some amount of harm to people. This result will be indirectly causal in some cases, such as the case of child pornography - It would be difficult to argue that the existence of an undetectable method of distribution for such material would not increase the demand for it, and this demand increase supply; a supply which inherently harms people.  Its not central to my argument, but have you considered the possibility that the existence of child pornography might act, with a pedophile, in a manner similar to that in which methadone acts with a heroin addict?  In other words, have you considered the possibility that access to child pornography might actually reduce the likelihood that a pedophile will assault a child?  I do not claim that this is the case, but I do not take it for given that it isn't either - and it demonstrates that even this most emotive of issues is not black and white.   In other, more direct cases, for instance those of free flow of information for terrorists, drug cartels, prostitution rings, etc., such a channel would make these activities feasible to entertain without fear of legal consequence and infinitely more difficult if not impossible to detect and effectively suppress; again resulting harm to people.  It is true that bad people could use any tool, Freenet included, to do bad things.  You have not shown that the harm caused by these bad things is greater than the good that comes from good people using that tool to do good things.   P2: [The Millsian harm principle:] is that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. - John Stuart Mill - On Liberty (1869)  I don't find this principle particularly persuasive.  If one was to accept this principle, or at least the application of this principle as you seek to use it, George W Bush (for example) can legitimately take action against any individual that criticizes him - since such criticism could be said to harm him (specifically, harm his chances of reelection).  There many ways one could harm someone that are perfectly legal.  For example, I could harm Bill Gates by creating software that competes favorably with his software and giving it away.  Despite this, it would not be appropriate for the government to prevent me from harming Bill Gates in this way.  What P2 misses is that there is no universal "harm", often one person must be harmed to protect another.  The question is which will lead to the least harm overall.  My argument is that the benefits of making government censorship impossible far outweigh any disadvantages.   E1: The only way rape and murder could be suppressed is by providing an authority with the ability to monitor and control behaviour. E2: Since supplying such an ability will invariably provide that authority with the opportunity to abuse it, by controlling arbitrary behaviour (including free speech and distribution of content), it cannot be allowed. EC1: Therefore, rape and murder should not be suppressed.  You are correct that some forms of government control are tolerable, but it does not then follow that all forms of government control, including control over our ability to communicate, must be tolerated.  Government control over the means of communication is different to other forms of government control due to the nature of how governments in democratic countries acquire the right to exercise any control in the first place.  Governments in democratic countries gain their legitimacy from the fact that they were chosen and are answerable to those they govern.  If such governments have the ability to control the ability of those they govern to acquire and exchange information, then they have the ability to prevent the population from holding them to account, and indeed, prevent the population from knowing that they are being prevented from holding them to account.  Thus, to safeguard the legitimacy of a democratic government, that government must be prevented from controlling the information its citizens have access to.   B: Reject the harm principle and in turn reject all forms of effective controls of liberty.  No, I reject one form of effective control of liberty for reasons outlined above and in Freenet's philosophy document.  You cannot imply from this that I reject all forms of control on liberty, and thus your argument collapses.

      From the  urlLink Freenet FAQ ,  urlLink Section 1 :  "Freenet is free software designed to ensure true freedom of communication over the Internet. It allows anybody to publish and read information with complete anonymity. Nobody controls Freenet, not even its creators, meaning that the system is not vulnerable to manipulation or shutdown. Freenet is also very efficient in how it deals with information, adaptively replicating content in response to demand. For more information, please read  urlLink What Is Freenet ."   This afternoon I wrote an email to Ian Clarke, the main developer of  urlLink Freenet  and the author of the philosophy behind it. This message included the argument below; in which I highlight what I believe to be fatal problems with the justifications presented for such a project. I suggest you at least read the  urlLink Freenet Philosophy  page before continuing.     Preface : To move for the total and absolute removal of censorship or to directly provide a means to cause censorship to be unenforceable, as with the Freenet philosophy, is an ethically indefensible stance, or so I will argue.   "Belief in democracy, however, like any other belief, may be carried to the point where it becomes fanatical, and therefore harmful."  Bertrand Russell - Ideas That Have Harmed Mankind (1950)        P1 : Total and absolute free flow of information will result in some amount of harm to people. This result will be indirectly causal in some cases, such as the case of child pornography - It would be difficult to argue that the existence of an undetectable method of distribution for such material would not increase the demand for it, and this demand increase supply; a supply which inherently harms people. In other, more direct cases, for instance those of free flow of information for terrorists, drug cartels, prostitution rings, etc., such a channel would make these activities feasible to entertain without fear of legal consequence and infinitely more difficult if not impossible to detect and effectively suppress; again resulting harm to people.  For the sake of argument I will take the Millsian approach to liberty, an approach which seems to be the most liberal, generally accepted and closest to the Freenet philosophy from which it is possible to work. Although it is worth noting at this point that there are also strong arguments for even stricter controls on liberty. The basic framework of the Millsian model is the harm principle:       P2 : "[The Millsian harm principle:] is that the sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection. That the only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others."  John Stuart Mill - On Liberty (1869)      C : At least some control of liberty, including that of free speech and distribution of content, by a government, is necessary.  Of course, if you accept  P1 , which I do not think it would be reasonable to reject since the Freenet website itself makes connotations to these consequences being necessary evils, you certainly do not agree with  P2  and  C . This would seem given as you hold that in providing an authority with the power to uphold the harm principle, one must take the unacceptable risk that such an authority may abuse that power. These objections can be summarised with the following argument:      F1 : For an authority to uphold the harm principle it is necessary for that authority to be attributed the power to successfully monitor and control behaviour.    F2 : The attribution of these powers would, by necessary consequence, make it at least possible for such powers to be abused to prevent legitimate freedom of speech or distribution of content.    FC1 : Since this is an unacceptable risk, the harm principle should not be upheld.  The problem with such an argument seems to stem from the fact that any authority given the task of upholding the harm principle must, consequentially, have at least the ability, if not necessarily the intention, to suppress legitimate speech or distribution of content; two of the most vital requirements for effective democracy. But in rejecting the harm principle for the reasons stated in  F2  and  FC1 , and given that you hold that some level of human harm to be an acceptable factor as a means to the end of absolute assurance of legitimate liberty, it would be very difficult to reason as to why you do not subscribe to the following:      E1 : The only way rape and murder could be suppressed is by providing an authority with the ability to monitor and control behaviour.    E2 : Since supplying such an ability will invariably provide that authority with the opportunity to abuse it, by controlling arbitrary behaviour (including free speech and distribution of content), it cannot be allowed.    EC1 : Therefore, rape and murder should not be suppressed.  This seems to leave you with two very distinct alternatives:      A : Support the harm principle (to some extent if not absolutely) and in turn the attribution of powers to an authority, powers that it is at least possible will be abused to prevent legitimate freedom of speech or distribution of content.    B : Reject the harm principle and in turn reject all forms of effective controls of liberty.  If you choose  A  the problem for the Freenet philosophy is self-evident. If you choose  B , as a means of affirming the principle that an absolute guarantee of free speech is all important and overrides the rights of some people, it is not possible for a society to enforce any conventional models of human rights. To do so would require an authority to be granted the necessary power to achieve this end; a power that such a principle of absolute guarantee deems unacceptable.

      Consider the phrase:  "I always lie" . –  Prima facie , it seems like an unfathomable paradox, but maybe it isn't.    Since, if we accept this statement is true, it would involve a contradiction whereby the speaker has refrained from lying on at least this one occasion  and  because no such contradiction is employed if the statement is false, it must be false.  Therefore this person does not always lie.  It also must be true that this person does not always tell the truth, as they have just made a false statement (a lie).  So, we can safely conclude that this person must at least sometimes tell the truth, but also has lied at least once.  Of course, there may be problems with this. If you believe there are, feel free to raise them in the comments section.

            urlLink Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall  (the cook who had several series on the  urlLink BBC  and  urlLink a number of companion books ), recently released a new work; a  urlLink book on cooking meat . Nothing too alarming about that in itself but unusually, as Jim rather excitedly informed me a few days ago, this book contains a preface (entire first chapter to be exact) dealing with the ethics of the meat eating practise. It’s encouraging to see a chef/cook with this level of recognition take such a step. I had never imagined chefs really gave the issue any serious thought at all. And Hugh seems highly intelligent. You might find this chapter interesting whether you eat meat or not, and his arguments in either direction could certainly challenge you if you have not explored the issue to any significant depth.  I believe though, that his arguments are not as strong as they may appear to be. Perhaps we can communicate this to him soon.

      This morning, while having a look through the “ urlLink What’s New? ” section of  urlLink snopes.com , I came by the following entry:&nbsp;&nbsp;      Was a five-year-old Peruvian girl  the youngest mother    on record?   The concept of a  urlLink five-year-old girl giving birth  seems so bizarre I’m fairly sure I shouldn’t believe it. However, I understand snopes to be fairly credible and they cite a fair few sources as well.      Regardless of our squeamishness, we have to note that the claim of a five-year-old girl giving birth is apparently true. Her name was Lina Medina, a Peruvian girl from the Andean village of Ticrapo who made medical history in 1939 when she gave birth to a boy by caesarean section in May 1939 at the age of five years, seven months and 21 days.    While having a look around myself,&nbsp;I found  urlLink one  or  urlLink two  other reports from seemingly reputable sources. Very odd.

       “I open up my wallet and it's full of blood” – Godspeed You! Black Emperor    After having had a brief conversation among a few friends about the ethics of charity, or to what level of humanitarianism we are ethically commited, in a horribly noisy and unsuitable environment I thought it might be a good idea&nbsp;to mention it here where it's possible to think a little more clearly. The main question was this:  Can we justify choosing to do nothing at all towards charitable causes which affect human life or death?  – and if not –  Are we presently doing enough?    I think it is all but certain the answer to the fomer is  “no”  and, for the vast majority of us, I believe that the same is applies to the latter.   If you are not convinced though, you may want to read through what I believe to be a very strong argument for why the majority of us are commited to do more;  urlLink Famine, Affluence and Morality  by  urlLink Peter Singer . This paper was written in 1971 and uses as its case study the  urlLink famine which affected East Bengal  at the time – the famine itslef, along with the civil conflict which caused it, was repsonsible for at least a million deaths.   Of course, this subject matter is directly analogous or at least predominantly applicable to certain problems the world faces at present. Most notably, there is the&nbsp; urlLink situation  in  urlLink Sudan , which is currently the main concern of  urlLink Oxfam ; and the AIDS epidemic affecting Sub-Saharan Africa along with a number of&nbsp; urlLink other developing countries .  urlLink UNAIDS  (The Joint  urlLink United Nations  Programme on HIV/AIDS) predicts that by 2010 there will be 45 million new infections; of which 29 million are avoidable if the necessary preventative measures are taken now. Exactly what is necessary for such prevention is by no means prohibitive; simply money, money that is not vital to the lives of those who have it.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; For further information&nbsp;about organisations related to these matters, or to look for those which deal with a specific issue, the  urlLink UK Charity Commision  hosts a very useful website where charities can be searched by  urlLink name ,  urlLink number ,  urlLink objetive  or  urlLink area in which they operate , along with plenty of information to assure even the most cynical; income, expenditure, trustees etc.

       Dear family, friends and sponsors.  With only two weeks left on placement we are trying to finish all our intended work whilst religiously counting the days. Now that we can taste freedom, we have all become very thirsty. Speaking personally, I enjoy much of the lifestyle here and am happy working with our green club, which is growing in strength slowly but surely. That said I also can't wait to leave the village now. I find myself finding more and more excuses to stay away for evenings here and there, for a little respite from village life our host family.   What most people think of when they hear the word monsoon is of course rain. There is indeed a lot of rain and often it falls for more than 24hrs without stopping. The real problem for us four on our particular placement is mud. We are living deep in to the rural village area, far away from grit stone or paving. This means that getting anywhere takes three times as long and is five times as difficult. On the other hand I don't sweat when I eat now. I only have to wash once a day and only need to drink twliterses of water. After the blazing heat stormy weather is a real treat but the mud makes life very difficult. And lets not be shy about it; its not so much the mud as all the feces and urine swilling around amongst the grey, brown slime beneath your toes, which puts us off the idea of leaving the house. Indeed the sisters of our family don't leave the house at all for two months, not that they do much anyway.  Like I said the rain isn't much of problem, its nice to listen to and everything looks wet and green and like a jungle. I even like wading through the newly formed thigh deep lake outside our village on the way to the rest of the world.  Except there is always that niggling panic at the back of your mind that you might have to pull a fat bloodsucking leach off your leg once you get to the other side. Speaking of scary wildlife, my snake count is now seven; four alive and three dead. I even touched a dead one the other day. With each encounter I become a little less anxious. And no I haven't seen a cobra yet. Although a friend of mine has a photo of two huge cobra making love in the night. This was quite a sight even in a photo. The cobra were in a long line on the ground, intertwined except for the heads which were raised high holding each others gaze. Quite remarkable. It was a beautiful sight and completely unthreatening apparently. It was learned that later that evening somebody was bitten a mere 15m away by one of the snakes, and had to be rushed to hospital.  The work itself has been hard but fun and satisfying sometimes too. We all feel that we have only begun a project, and are far from finishing anything with the community or with the children.  If everything goes to plan, there will be another two placements in the coming two years, and our work wont all have been in vain. However it is not definite with the political situation as it is that there will be the follow up placements intended. Even if there turns out not to be, we have given the kids a great time, taught them a few things and increased their confidence a good deal. Personally I have learned quite a lot in my time out here and would recommend  urlLink SPW  to any young gap goers looking to do such work.  From Joel's Nepali Adventures.

      Today I can finally resolve what has been something of a bone of contention for quite a few years now. I can categorically state that  urlLink Red Mill  brand  urlLink Transform-A-Snack  crisps are  not  pre-assembled in the factory.     Background:    The retail bags of these items contain three main components; a spaceship, a space hoop and a meteor ball. As suggested on the face of the bag, as what I can only imagine is a serving suggestion, one could take four space hoops and attach them to the spaceship component which would then act as a chassis and thereby create what I believe it's reasonable to assume is a "space buggy". For some years a great debate has raged over whether, during the factory production of these extruded maize treats, great quantities of workers were employed for the sole purpose of building these space buggies to exacting standards before they were dropped into the bags where they immediately fell apart again. One can explain the existence of the seemingly arbitrary meteor ball component by assuming they were added as a complimentary gift from the manufacturer to the customer or were included as a result of over-production from the  urlLink Tangy Toms  line.   Proof:   I have done quite an amount of research into the matter, and found that, in a detailed description of  urlLink Transform-A-Snack production methods , there is not a single mention of the pre-construction of space buggies. I hope that this should be enough to put the matter to rest once and for all.  It is now important that you play  urlLink Snack Attack . A space invaders game that is somehow relevant to crisps.

      That most peculiar of spectacles the  urlLink Fiesta de san Fermín  (Running of the Bulls) seems to still exist and will be going ahead tomorrow.     The event is held in parallel with  urlLink Feria del Toro  (the Bullfighting Fair); the run itself seems to be in the interests of transporting the bulls to the fair while getting them good and  urlLink angry, confused, scared and weakened  in the process. Being that the event is in honor of  urlLink Saint Fermín , when the  urlLink San Fermín  church strikes 8am, the bulls are released and the runners get underway, trying to avoid them on their  urlLink just under 1km trip . On arrival at the Plaza del Toro (Bullring) they are herded into corrals and later released so the crowd can watch the matadors kill them in traditional bullfighting fashion  [ urlLink 380k  |  urlLink 150k  |  urlLink 56k ] . Of course, many people are  urlLink not really so keen  on this event; and it seems  urlLink PETA  will be holding one of their typically  urlLink daft protests .  Can't people just  urlLink throw tomatoes at each other  or something?   Photo from the  urlLink San Fermín website .

         So, I head off for  urlLink Bath University  tomorrow to take part in an  urlLink Open University  course and hopefully learn a thing or two about an  urlLink interesting subject . Fifty-six hours of lectures, debates etc. in one week; which, while they’ll be no “lazy student” jokes here as they’re far too clichéd, seems to be about three-and-a-half times the quantity of the same as one could expect to be given at a “non-distance” university.
