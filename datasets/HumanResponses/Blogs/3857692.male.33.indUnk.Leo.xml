      Okay, so here is a brief... family is out of state, on vacation for 2 weeks.. this is day 5... Every night you try to be close to the same routine with your pets as if everyone were home, cept I am the only one home... Now imagine waking up every morning to find 1 or more items chewed to shit because of one dog.. and this particular morning, you find an out of print hardback book laying on the floor looking eerily like a dead shredded rabbit. So anyway, I cant exactly throw the dogs outside cause its storming... and I cant really hang the dogs by thier tail either... so what do i do... I picked up the mess, called mom and left a voicemail, and proceeded to go back to my room where I log into  urlLink Legend of the Green Dragon  and the MUD, and hack and slash things until I am tired enough to go back to bed... but while I sit here and write the blog, I am worried about later today when I have to go to class... then I ponder the dogs existance for tomorrow when I got to class from 8am til 4:30.. and I am gone for 12 hours. Well, perhaps things will be better Sunday... Maybe when I beat the crap out of the dog, it was enough for him to get the hint that that particular behavior isnt going to be tolerated by me. oh well.. in a week or so, I can go back to my routine, and I wont have to worry about what the dogs chew up...

      a couple months ago, I visited  urlLink www.stopfcc.com  and filled out the form to submit to my senator my beliefs and thoughts on the FCC and the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act. Today I got in the mail, a letter from Senator Charles E Grassley it goes as follows   "Mr.Stan Pickle  Knoxville, IA 50138  Dear Mr. Pickle  Thank you for taking the time to contact me.  As your Senator, it is important for me to hear from you.  Please accept my apology for the delay in my response.  I appreciate hearing your concerns reguarding the Broadcast Decensy Enforcement Act of 2004.  This bill would amend the Communications Act of 1934 to provide that, if a violator is determined by the FCC to have broadcast obscene, indecent, or profane language, the amount of forfeiture penalty shall not exceed $275,000 for each violation or day of such violation, to a maximum of $3 million for any single act or failure to act.  This legislation is awaiting consideration on the Senate floor. Please rest assured that I will keep your thoughts in mind as the Senate considers this issue.  Again, thank you for contacting me.  I appreciate hearing your views and urge you to keep in touch.  Sincerly   Charles E. Grassley United States Senator."   All is sorta find and good, but what exactly is the definition of Obscene, indecent, or profane language?  According to the Act, and its predecessor, its subject to interpretation. Which means basically if someone reports to the FCC that they heard something on the radio or TV that they didnt agree with, the radio station or tv station, its affiliate, and the personallity that was on the air at the time, can be subject to fines.   Here is a copy of the email I sent back to Senator Grassley.    Dear Senator Grassley,  I appreciate your written response regarding my concerns about the BDEA2004.  While I do agree that a level of regulation needs to exist for radio and broadcast television, I still have concerns with the definition of what is ‘obscene, indecent, or profane language’.  Not everyone has the same opinion of what is obscene, indecent, or profane.    I would also like to express my concern about the level of the fines for such an incident.  High and low profile radio stations,radio personalities, and broadcast television personalities are going to be subject to fines 10 times greater than any fine any other individual must face for the same incident.  $200 for swearing aloud while walking in downtown Des Moines does not compare to $275,000 and up.  I can’t exactly remember where I heard this, “an educated man has no need to be profane”.  This statement is very true, but the problem we are facing with indecency is not about what the children hear, it is about how are children are taught to handle what they hear.  Money needs to be found to increase the effectiveness of Public Education so that our children can have the same levels of education that you or I had when we went to school.  Please consider the following as you research for your decision of this act. o	Reduce the level of the fines, they are too excessive. Or, determine if the money acquired from these fines can go towards a budget designed to enhance public education. o	Define what is Obscene, Indecent, or Profane Language to current standards of communication (as of 2004 not 1934).  o	Define what would be considered questionable content as far as topics of discussion or allowable viewing.  This act, and its predecessor need to be well defined, unquestionable, and absolute.  I thank you for your time.  Stanley C Pickle Jr.  Knoxville, IA 50138    Please, if you read this and agree with some or all of what I wrote, feel free to visit the link at the top of this message, sign up, write your congressman, and tell them that something needs to be done to protect free speech.
