       Today was a good day.  I had been waiting for some news from the surgeon for a few weeks and the appointment was this afternoon.  However, just before that appointment I ran into Robin Williams quite by chance.  He was standing outside the hotel I had just left.    "Hello Robin."  I offer my hand.  He is waiting for someone, standing in front of an old racing push bike propped against a pillar.  "Oh hi."  He takes my hand.  His face has that enigmatic smile, but you can tell he is wary (after all, being well known has to have it share of weirdos like me grabbing your hand and drooling all over you).  I can't make true eye contact due to the Oakley sunglases, but I like the handshake.  It shows me a genuine regard.  "I love your work and your humour, and it's great to meet you!"  I step back a little to give the man some space.  He looks very much like he does in the movies, only maybe a little smaller (that must be a cliche by now).    "And I hope the weather gets warmer for you!"  I start to head away to hear him speak again.  We are surrounded by about a foot of snow from the previous days snowfall and it is still sub-zero in early May.  The poor guy looks very cold.  With an expression of happiness that would look perfectly in place in Patch Adams or What Dreams May Come, he laughs and says, "And I hope it gets better for you too!"  ***  Well, sitting back at the end of the day I wonder at that moment of synchronicity.  It turns out that my biopsy of 3 weeks before shows no sign of cancer.  We still don't know what is wrong with my health.  But I think Robin had the right idea...  ...the weather did indeed get better today.  Thank you Robin.  Cheerz, Carmien

       Amazing really - I have been hearing and reading about Blogs for a very long time.  Oh well, like the proverbial sheep here I go...or do I?  Life is good.  Life is also full of some very interesting lessons.  Today I am working once again with the idea that we are here for one of three reasons: - To be a lesson  - To learn a lesson  - To both learn and be a lesson  Then there is the idea that all choices are based on one of two emotions: - Love - Fear  I love it when a simple idea sounds simple when you read it over again.  I currently have a health issue that could easily be looked at in fear.  I am not certain whether I am learning from it, if I am there to inspire others through it, or a mixture of both.  How much easier it is to live in fear though.  I recently had an old friend tell me to 'not' focus on what this health issue might be all about.  At first, I looked through the lens of fear and contrary to my deepest wish, found myself making a choice to look at it all in fear.  Following uncertainty, denial and then an openess to think about it some more I came to a simple conclusion:  - Focus on what matters to you now.  And so I am.  My wife, bless her heart, is the soul that shares this journey with me.  Following the most recent events I have no doubt of her love for me.  There, that's easier.  A good start to what matters...and look, it is a thought based in love.    I used to be very involved with LARP (Live Action Role Play).  I got carried away with the organizational side of things and took on roles like Storyteller and even a coordinator for the world wide group that pulled a bunch of chronicles together.  After a few years of this I needed a break.  I stopped playing for a year.  I am now back at the LARPing again.  I missed the social interactions!  I mistook what I really enjoyed for what I thought I might enjoy.  Next time, I have to remember to focus on why I got involved in the first place - the people I interacted with.    Work is brilliant.  I work for a great company, and within a very progressive organization.  An opportunity lies before me that is very exciting.  Career development is your own responsibility.  Take charge of that, understand where your company is going, and be positioned with something of value when the company moves.  If you can't find a balance between your vision and that of the company you work for, you may be in the wrong place.  It took me 15 years to work that out.  WOW.  That's a very long time to learn such a simple lesson.   That is clearly move than anyone needs to be subjected to at any one sitting, so I shall stop reading my own words now.  Anyone else who made it this far, thank you.  I am not quite certain where I am going with this particular journey of blogging.  I am also not certain if I will remember to post again.  It will be wonderful to look back on this post 5 years from now after hours of struggling with remembering the password, to find how amazingly dense my thoughts were 5 years ago.    But who knows, I might actually remember sooner...and who knows, I might actually post again.  Cheerz, Carmien

        The new desire for political debate is a good sign.  We are evolving from apathy into a western society that seems to have a hunger for democracy again.  Until someone comes up with a better political system, I always try to suggest that we make the most of this one (no matter how helpless it may sometimes make you feel).  It is a time where one can reflect and consider what it must be like to live in a country where democracy is a new thing; where everyone gets a chance to have their say.  And yet here we are, spoiled by years of complacency, only slowly rising from a deep slumber.  On the back of this new found energy is some interesting commentary.  In fact, perhaps my favourite commentary at this time is the conversation around Fahrenheit 9/11.  The responses in conversation appear, in my experience at least, to fall into one of two camps.  You either love Moore, or you hate him.  For my part, I find the answer “It is such a biased film…” to be the most interesting.  Particularly given that Bush has had 3 years to present his bias to the world, and that the media has followed him like a sheep on morphine.  The latest salvo from Moore is stunning.  Here is a man who turns up at the city hosting the democratic convention.  During that convention he gives a speech in which he lambastes the media.  Couldn’t have said it better myself, Michael!  For further commentary, go to  urlLink http://www.michaelmoore.com/   Big corporate media is killing the integrity of journalism.  Perhaps we are coming full circle, where years of political apathy are now catching up with the collective conscience?  Perhaps it is time to hold media, and the political arena accountable?  Perhaps it is time to hold ourselves accountable?  Accountable for the one vote we do have.  Instead of sitting back and pretending that it is not worth while, we might consider the impact of many people saying the same thing.   But then, I look to the example of Bush.  And then I consider the Enron scandal (amongst the many it stands out the loudest due to the number of bank accounts it hit).  We chastise the executives (and the auditors) and rightly so.  However, when the CEO of America sets the example that he has over the past few years, why should we be surprised to see blue chip companies follow such a lead?  The currency of conscience is accounted for in our own pockets, and in the return on investments we gain from the most profitable of businesses.  For as long as profit continues to dictate the swaying of our conscience, we will continue to have ethical examples such as we have been subjected to these recent years.  Perhaps it is time for us to ourselves accountable?
