      Ok Guys, this story's worth hearing. So Monday morning I'm woken up at 6:15am by this really loud beeping noise, so I tried to turn off my alarm clock, but thats not what was beeping. So I laid in bed for a few moments, blinking stupidly, then heard my mom yelling somehting from what seemed like really far off, and I realized all of a sudden that it was the SMOKE DETECTOR going off!! So I jumped out of bed and opened my door, and this WALL of smoke came pouring in! I quickly woke up my brothers and got them outside, then went back in to investigate. I hurried over to our kitchen, and arrived just in time to see out microwave melt and fall into pieces!! Our kitchen was in flames, the walls, the counters, the floor, the stove, microwave, refridgerator...Oh man. My dad somehow put it out, and I am now practically living in my basement, while about 500 people come over every day to repair or clean our house. Wow. So that was my adventure for this week. Peace out, A-town!!  ~Chel~

      Let's see... what to write, what to write. Ok, last night I was at the house in Florida with my friend Kendra. She was in the kitchen filling waterbottles with iced tea for the next day, and I was in the bedroom with my earphones on. Suddenly she appears in the doorway to our room with this frantic and terrified look on her face, so I dropped my music and ran after her as she sprinted back to the kitchen. We tried to whisper since everyone else was asleep. "What?" I whispered. "IT'S A F***ING ROACH!" she scream-whispered. "I just stared at her, uncertain at which I was more surprised at- the roach or her language. Then I just started laughing. Man, the look on her face. Ha. Peace out, A- town. ~~Chel

      I really don't want a blog, but Kendra is MAKING me one so I guess I should write SOMETHING for it. I hate blogs. I think they're dumb and pointless and no one ever wants to read them. I mean, seriously, most people don't want to sit there and read about what someone else did all day long. So why would you be interested in what I've been doing? So my blog is going to be unusual, hopefully somewhat interesting. Talk to y'all later!!  Peace out, A-town!   -Chel
