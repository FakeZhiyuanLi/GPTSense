        last night was pretty chillin. I went to Ryans for a bit then he went to the pub with his brother and shiet and I went to Sarahs and we got so fuckin high! lol I actually bought weed for the first time this summer! haha... yea I was SO high we mixed 3 different types of weed in this big joint and yea the rest is history. Then Ryan came over and we couldn't even think of smoking more weed we were so high. So I'll get him baked today. I wish I could've gotten him a present but oh well I will when I get money. But I have to meet his parents next week! Ah! I'm so scared lol I hate having to meet peoples parents... but his sound chillin like they get drunk and stuff... I also have to meet his other brother but that will be alright cuz he's apparently a big stoner. But anyways gotta go get high!

       Last night was the shiet! lol. Well I gotta say what happened first. I went for my 2nd interview at Chillis but the manager that was supposed to interview me was in a fuckin meeting! And Trina told me that those "meetings" are just them drinking beer and what not! I was like FUCK it was so gay cuz its such a hassle to go down there!But anyways my mom piched me up from there and she gave me $50 for Ryans birthday! It was so nice. My dads being such a jerk he still won't give me money for her present! But anyways then I hooked up with Ryan and Lynsey, Sarah and Fran(finally!). Then we went over to Ryans friend Chrises house and there was this guy Andrew there as well. So we all got drunk and I invited Sophany, Sophana and Trina over lol there was SO many of us! It was awesome though! Oh yea and it's Ryans Birthday today!

Caleb came back to Calgary and had a hotel party that me and Ryan and Sarah were going to go to but then me and Ryan ended up having a fight so only Sarah went. but thats okay because we made up. I didn't even see Caleb the whole time he was here lol oh well. But yea and Lynsey and Jason did some coke with me and Ryan but it was SO annoying because Lynsey would NOT STOP TALKING! Ah! I wanted to die! lol Shiet... but yea anyways I don't really have much else to say except its Ryans birthday on Wednesday! I can't really buy him a present... but i'll buy him booze and I burnt him a bunch of cd's. Shiet I can't believe he's gonna be 22! Oh well..

       so this weekend has been pretty sweet... got to drink MGD on friday but i didn't get drunk. we were out drinkin by the couch lol again. but this time was different. Lynsey and Jason got into ANOTHER fuckin fight! which was SO annoying cuz i was tryin to talk to Jasons friends Jeffette(hahahahaha its a guys name!) and Tristan and shiet Ryan and me weren't really on good terms lol but ne ways I just went up to talk to Lynsey after she called me crying and blah blah blah, so then I came back and told Jason to go talk to her. Oh yea and Lynsey was real pissed so she was all knocking over signs and what not but yea, so Jason goes up on the road to talk to her and hes just like "COPS! COPS!" so we all fuckin jet into the bushes and we were standing there, we could see the cop car it had the high beams on and everything, and then it was just like a movie lol Lynsey calls me up shes like "stay where you are. don't move. they're looking for you guys right now. I have to go I think they can hear me." lol so then everyone of course  doesn't  stay where they're supposed to, we all jump this fence, there was 5 of us. Then we get to another fence, and just stand there in a line with our backs against the wall. it was hilarious! then we saw the cop car and knew they were coming to look for us here so we all ran into the dirt piles in an attempt to hide. Jeffette and Tristan and Trevor all ran off and hid under this trailer that was there. But eventually the cops got me and Ryan but he also got Tristan and Jeffette. it was quite a good night. Oh yea and that night Ryan was so fucking hammered he drank a 6 pack of MGD, a 8 pack of Cold Shots (he shot gunned 2 in less than a minute lol) and I duno how many Lucky's he drank. lol it was quite entertaining. And yesterday was good. Me and Ryan hooked up with Sarah and Chenko and got really hammered and I was so baked I had one of my laugh attacks hahaha. But yea good weekend all together.
