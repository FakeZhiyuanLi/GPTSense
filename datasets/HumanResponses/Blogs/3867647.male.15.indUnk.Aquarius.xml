      It's raining, the powers out, and you're by yourself, well. Try A game called sleeping bag. The rules are simple just take a sleeping bag put your head on the seam at the bottom of the sleeping bag. Get a timer time yourself on how long you don't bump into things. Well how long can you not bump into thing.
