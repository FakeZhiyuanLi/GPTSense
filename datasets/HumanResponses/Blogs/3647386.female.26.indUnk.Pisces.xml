      Again, I have another week full of stuff to do.  On the bright side I do not have to go back to the place of  urlLink marginal employment  until Saturday, and I am contemplating calling in sick.  The  urlLink Festival of the Lights  begins tonight.  Four nights of craziness and lack of sleep, as I live directly ajacent to the concert venue.  I love how this is supposed to be a celebration of Canada, yet two of the three the headline acts are American;  urlLink Hootie and the Blowfish  and Live.  This only saving grace is Sam Roberts on Friday night we get Sam Roberts, some nice home-grown Canadian talent. I have VIP passes to all the concerts and events, all I had to do for that perk was go to a bunch of meetings and bitch about security and crowd control on behalf of my neighbours.  Not to be crass, I am doing some actual work during the event, I wouldn't want to get a reputation for being on committees just for the perks.  I hope they have free drinks in the VIP tent.

       Sunday  A day of relaxation and pop culture.  Went to see  urlLink The Stepford Wives , I have not read the book, nor have I seen the original movie.  It wasn't so much a horror movie, as it was a social satire.  It was pretty subtle, which I like, but I am not sure if the movie worked overall.  I plan on renting the original sometime this week and seeing how the two of them compare. I also read Helen Fielding's new book  Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination .  This was not even in the same league as  Bridget Jones's Diary .  Too improbable, too flaky, and not what I would consider a thinking girl's kind of book, but I am an admitted book snob.   Monday  Running in the morning.  Okay while this daily journal seemed like it was going to be a good idea; it is now a week later and this the first time I have been back to my blog.  Last week flew by, lots of time spent at the place of  urlLink marginal employment  and that was about it.  I didn't even go out on the weekend.  On Friday, I did volunteer at the  urlLink Lucy Maud Montgomery Institute Conference .  A friend of mine is the director of the Institute at UPEI.  Some of the topics were a bit insane; but I love how invested academics are in their topics.  I just can't get that excited about anything.  This week is going to be all about the  urlLink Festival of the Lights .  I am on the steering committee, for the Canada Day celebrations in Charlottetown.  I am supposed to be representing the needs of downtown residents, but mostly I am in it for the VIP concert passes.  Today is election day in Canada, and I am a bit scared of the possible outcome.  As a young and educated, left-leaning person I have to say that  urlLink Stephen Harper and the Conservatives  frighten me.  I want a happy, socialist Canada with free healthcare and no American missile defense system.  It will most likely be a minority government, hopefully Liberal (not that I am a huge Paul Martin fan) and in the best case scenario propped up by the  urlLink NDP  .  That will mean no weapons in space and having to adhere to the Kyoto Accord and maybe Stephen Harper being incapacitated via the apopletic fit he will have when he gets his income tax assessment next year.  I am off to the polling booth, and to all you other Canadians out there, you should take a few minutes and go out and vote too.  My soap box for the day.

      It had become abundantly clear that Jenny did not want me anywhere near her "great work" and it appeared that Cindy had tried to make some changes before I had been hired and had not been successful.  I liked Cindy, she is an aging hippy-chick, but was not terribly well-suited to being a manager.  She was a definitely a peace, love and happiness kind of lady; Cindy did not deal well with conflict.  In the first attempt to work with Jenny and her great "opus", the three of us sat down together to try and work out how the timeline of the curriculum would work.    It seemed to be working, I re-worked a lesson plan template I had used as a teaching assistant to fit the content, it would change a few more times but it was a good start.  We now had a day by day plan for the curriculum to fit into and I was trying really hard to include Jenny's rambling work into the new format and curb my inner control freak.  Jenny took a few sick days and Cindy and I got an amazing amount of work done.    I was obviously deluded, and thought that Jenny would be pleased with the progress we had made.  Instead, she freaked out.  This happened, of course, on a day when Cindy was not in the office.  Jenny raved for a good hour about how she couldn't work with the new format because it was "social work" and she was not a social worker.  This social work thing is even more interesting, as I later found out from two of my other co-workers (who I am getting to know and like more and more) that Jenny had said she had worked in the social work field during her interview for the job.  The plot thickens and my nerves are starting to wear thin.

      This is basically going to be a list of things I did this past week, nothing very exciting just what was going on in my little world.   Monday  Started an actual running program, if I get really ambitious, I might actually post my progress. Went sailing, first time all season, the weather this spring has been terrible and the more than full-time work has not been conducive either.   Tuesday  Again with the running. The rest of the day I enjoyed the state of my marginal employment, I did nothing.  It was fabulous.   Wednesday  I went to visit my old editing job (see the adventures in editing posts) to do a final copy-edit and make sure none of the unreferenced garbage had made it into the draft binder.  I did have some shredding to do. Went sailing again.  Only five of us on a  urlLink J/35  for a club race, it was a bit hairy and I would have preferred to be deck-fluff.  Despite a terrible spinnaker set we still managed to place third.   Thursday  Planned on job hunting on the internet did nothing until it was time to head to my place of marginal employment,  urlLink Canada's favourite bookstore .  It was not busy at all so I bought a CD  urlLink Ryan Adam's  and ordered a book  Bad Behavior  by Mary Gaitskill.   Bad Behavior  is the short story collection that has the story that the movie  urlLink Secretary  is based on in it.   Friday  My plans were to do absolutely nothing.  Go for a run and work on my Adventures in Editing, but I got called into the place of marginal employment.  I am not really complaining, I need the money, but it was really nice out. Went out with Leanne for drinks.  Had yummy Sour Apple martinis served by an equally yummy bartender.  He even topped up my drink for free, drinks taste better when those serving them are attractive.   Saturday  Another full day of customer service, I have a new pet peeve, old people shopping for computer books.  Not fun at all.  Convinced the highers-up to put the  urlLink De-Lovely  soundtrack on the playlist.  You can't argue with Elvis Costello singing Cole Porter. I baby-sat this evening, a few hours with a 10-month old can be a lot of fun and an excellent reminder to practice safe sex. Now I am going to go to bed and get ready to have an exciting week and be able to tell all you nice people about it.

      I am currently living the life of marginal employment, back to selling books in a huge chain retailer for barely more than minimum wage. To assuage the boredom I am going to tell the story of my last job.  The saying goes that the truth is stranger than fiction, my last job was certainly a case of this.  The characters are unbelievable and the plot takes incredible twists, but it actually happened and someday the actual sordid details may be laid out on the National or in the Globe and Mail, but for now you can only take my word for it.  I have changed the names of the characters and the location of the events have been left to the imagination.  I have just finished a contract job with a not for profit, I was hired to edit the curriculum that had already been developed for a craft training program, but it turned out that they had hired a "writer" who did not know how to write, she had no knowledge of style guides or reference standards.  In fact, she was the scariest kind of "writer": a low level of education combined with attendance at some creative writing seminars.  Before I go any further, I am not claiming to be Shakespeare, but I do have a university education and an academic publication to my credit, I know the difference between 'its' and 'it's'.  As I said, I was supposed to edit Jenny's and prepare it for presentation to the government agency funding the project.  Well, within the first minutes of meeting Jenny and reading her work, I knew I was in trouble.  What was supposed to be a technical document was full of typos and spelling errors, she was using contractions and there were no citations.  This was only my first day, how was I going to survive 10 weeks of trying to fix this disaster.  I had already counted seven exclamation marks and I was only on page 2.  My head was precariously close to thumping against the desk in frustration and it wasn't even lunch yet on my first day.  Here I was in a new office, with people I didn't know, and a job that was going to be very difficult.  Jenny was very possessive of her work and the project manager, Cindy, was only in the office three days a week.  I did not have my own computer.  The office was in a small town 40 minutes from where I live, it had a mud driveway and I had covered my Ralph Lauren boots with mud getting out of the car. All I had been trying to do was make a good impression on my first day, and I was so over-dressed I was making my new co-workers uncomfortable.  What had I gotten myself into?

      Wow!  I have been contemplating doing this for a long time, and now I finally have.  This is a bit scary, putting my own words out into the world for anyone to read.    What I would like to do with my brand new blog, is to practice writing and letting other people see it.  If you like what you see, or even if you don't, I want to know about it.  Amy

      This week I have been working in my Dad's office, nothing really difficult billing and receiving invoices.&nbsp; In fact, it is incredibly boring and easy, there is a problem; they have the radio tuned to the country music station and it is driving me insane.&nbsp; I would rather work in stuffy silence than listen to Garth Brooks and other 'new country' all day long.&nbsp; The best part of the local country station is that at lunchtime they read the death notices, makes for an uplifting lunch.&nbsp; I am only there this week and I don't feel like I should be asking to change the radio station.&nbsp; It is almost as bad as the crap they play at the place of  urlLink marginal employment , Josh Groban will also be on heavy rotation in Hades.

      It has been a very long and busy week here in my little part of the world.&nbsp; This past week was Race Week at the Yacht Club I belong to.&nbsp; Basically a week of alcohol fueled debauchery with some sailing thrown in as the excuse for everyone's behaviour.&nbsp; I didn't get to sail all four days because of the place of  urlLink Marginal Employment , but the two days I did manage to hit the water were pretty good.&nbsp; We had a second on the last day, and because we were consistent ended up third in our class.&nbsp; Socially the week was kind of slow for me, I was subjected to several hours of listening to a girl who makes Jessica Simpson appear to have the IQ of a Nobel Laureate.&nbsp; I have known J my entire life and have always thought she was a spoiled brat; early on it was because I was friends with her older sister and we had to "include her" when playing together and later on it was because of how blatantly her parents showed their preference for her over her nicer and far more pleasant sister.  &nbsp;  There was an incredible sight on Wednesday night, a huge, and I mean huge sailboat, came in under sail.&nbsp; It was a stunning sight, the sails glowed pink as it arrived at dusk and I am a total sucker for navy blue sailboats.&nbsp; The  urlLink Destination Fox Harb'r &nbsp;is a stunning sailing vessel, now if I had a spare $16 million US, I would want one just like it.&nbsp; The boat belongs to Ron Joyce, co-founder of  urlLink Tim Horton's , the owner was aboard (apparently he actually likes to sail, not just a status seeking wannabe and he even sailed from New Zealand back to Canada after the boat was built).&nbsp; I didn't get invited aboard for cocktails, despite my generous donation of time to the Tim Horton's Camp organization this past winter.&nbsp; A week on a bus with thirty underprivileged children and having to stay at  urlLink Kamp Krusty  should have garnered me at least a beer and a tour of the boat.  &nbsp;  As you can tell, I am easily distracted by shiny and expensive objects and have completely digressed from what I actually did last week.&nbsp; But I have to call it quits now because of what I did do last week and what I have to look forward to this coming week.&nbsp; I am going to work for my Dad, eek!!!&nbsp; I need some rest and maybe a few episodes of  urlLink Six Feet Under  to fortify me for the coming week.

      Another day at the place of  urlLink marginal employment  yesterday.  It was a stunningly beautiful day, making it a stunningly boring day at work.  All the potential shoppers were at the beach or enjoying the other outdoor splendor that is PEI.  Of course, today being my day off, the weather is only mediocre.  I have to look on the bright side of this, season 2 of  urlLink Six Feet Under  is out on DVD and crap weather is an excuse for me to watch hours of Peter Krause.  I love the show because it is so fucked up, it invites the audience to laugh at death and all the sick things families do to one another.  All of that and Peter Krause is really pretty.  I went sailing last night, a regular Wednesday night club race, the wind died on the way home making for a very long night of too much family togetherness.  I am torn, next week is Race Week (a combination of competitive sailing and drinking) I want to sailing with Dad, but the stress of sailing with some of the other people on that boat may be too much for my mental health.  I am a terrible person, I have all four days off but Dad doesn't know that.  If things are not going well for me I am going to say that I could not get Friday or Saturday changed and I have to go into the place of  urlLink marginal employment .  I think this is a fair trade off, if things are sucking on the boat, I will just pretend to go to work and go to the beach instead, lessening everyone's stress and working on my non-PC tan.

      I found my own little blog on Google this morning, highly amusing trying to come up with the proper permutations of words to get a hit.  I did manage to do it.  So my challenge to you is to try it for yourselves, find me or even Google yourself and see what you come up with.  The number one hit for my own name is a pro golfer, followed by the president of the Virginia Dental Health Association.  On another note, I have registered to take a TESL course In Ottawa in August and from there I want to take my happy little certificate and go teach the mother tongue in Eastern Europe, preferably Prague or Budapest.  I truly do not believe that I am suited to living in Asia, I think the culture and climate of the former Soviet Bloc would be far more to my liking.  I also have far more interest in travelling in Europe than in Asia, although given the chance to go to see Sarah and Xiao Tian and their new baby (arriving in September) I would jump at it, but I don't think I could live there or even come close to ever wrapping my head around the language.  At least I can already order drinks in Russian.  The other bonus is, this means I will get to spend two weeks visiting friends in Ottawa, I know Em just wants her own personal chef.  That is my excitement for today.

      I am very glad to say that the Festival of the Lights is over.  Having watched more closely this year because of my role on the Steering Committee, I have to say that I am disgusted with people in general and right now feel that no one deserves the privilege of having this event put on for their benefit.  I firmly believe that a few people can ruin something for everyone else, the booger in the punchbowl syndrome, and those people were certainly out  last night.  Disrespectful of property, disdainful of authority and ungrateful for the opportunities offered to them; the general public is disgusting.    The private security which was supposed to be patrolling Water Street, between Great George and Prince Streets was nowhere to be found last night.  On the other hand, the City Police were prompt and extremely helpful in responding to three calls; the first and third relating to property damage, and the second relating to a physical assault.  This morning, there is much evidence of ripped up flower beds and broken glass on Water and Great George Streets.  The police cannot be everywhere at once and it is not fair to ask residents and local business owners to put up with this kind of behaviour from so many people.  It is a mixed use neighbourhood, but with many permanent residents and many of the businesses directly on the waterfront are seasonal.  The Festival has evolved and grown over its nine year history, and it is perhaps time to take into account the needs of some of the other area stakeholders when considering the directions of the Festival's continuing evolution.  Not all growth is positive and marketing at only 18 to 25 year-olds does have a number of drawbacks in a big-picture scenario.  There are other models that can be examined, which may provide some guidance as to how to proceed, one of which may be Peterborough, ON's  urlLink Festival of the Lights .  Bigger is not necessarily better and it is time the City of Charlottetown started thinking about how it really wants to be perceived.  A frank and realistic revision of the Festival format must be undertaken, and this revision must include all stakeholders.  Mixing the genres of musical acts or not serving alcohol on the site are possible options to be considered for the future, but most importantly the neighbourhood needs to be addressed.

      Last night I attended, and I mean I actually went to the concert, I was not there as a volunteer or on some fact finding mission.  I went strictly to the Festival of the Lights for enjoyment last night.  The rain held off for the first act and just as Sam Roberts got on stage the sky opened and it started to pour.  It was not soft summer rain, it was a full on downpour, complete with sky-splitting lightening and roaring thunder.  The set was stopped after the second song, but the crowd stayed put and the crew rearranged the stage to move the band to the back where it would be drier and decided to proceed.    In my humble opinion, it was a great show of professionalism on the part of  urlLink Sam Roberts and his band  to go on with the show.  He put on a truly rocking set that included familiar tunes from last year's  We Were Born in a Flame  and some new material that I am now looking forward to owning on CD.  The crowd showed great enthusiasm and appreciation for having the show go on despite the rain, there seemed to be very few people leave despite the unrelenting downpour that endured for the entirety of Sam's set.  I do have a few comments about the management of the site itself.  I and my companions had purchased beverages that were served in plastics cups.  I will mention also that the beverages were extremely reasonably priced compared to other similar events, I think this can be attributed to the generosity of the sponsors.  After finishing our beverages, I went looking for a garbage bin and when I couldn't find one I approached a security guard and asked where I could find one.  Instead of telling me where I could find a garbage bin, he took the plastic cups I had a tossed them over the security fence.  I have to say I was incredulous, I was not asking for him to take my garbage only for direction to a bin.  I know that the site is cleaned by volunteers and that the security guard was being paid to be there.  This was incredibly shoddy behaviour on his part and a very poor reflection on whoever hired him.  I could have dropped my cup, I choose to look for a bin to put it in and when I asked for help in keeping the venue and community clean my efforts were literally thrown in my face and in the faces of the many volunteers.    I also had the privilege of having access to the VIP tent.  This was a highly valued privilege especially considering the weather.  Before I continue, Prince Edward Island has Smoke-Free Legislation, it was enacted last year to ban smoking in public places and within 15 feet of the entrances of public places.  Not that it is enforced everywhere to the full degree of the legislation, but in my own experience it is generally abided by.  This was not the case in the VIP tent at the Festival of the Lights, to the discomfort and disgust of many, people were smoking in the tent.  While I am not certain of the specifics of the legislation, because the venue was serving alcohol and it was enclosed I believe the Act applies and it was not being enforced by the hired security.  The private security were supposedly local bar staff, and from this it can be presumed that they are aware of the Smoke-free legislation.    It is up to event organizers to ensure that the staff they hire abide by the laws of the province and municipality.  Setting a standard of decorum and behaviour among staff and volunteers does have a positive effect on the crowd attending the event.  Disregard for individuals, the environment and the law by staff and volunteers will only add to already present mob mentality that exists when 8,000 to 10,000 people gather in a confined area with the added effects of loud music and alcohol.  This is not to say that the event should be cancelled in future years, but there are factors that do not appear to be under consideration that would improve the Festival for all stakeholders in the community.

      I just realized that today is that oh so creepy day that happens rather infrequently. As I have been away, I really haven't been paying attention to the calendar. It was sort of a surprise. Aside from being a day regarded for its rarity I have to observe today for two other reasons. The first is that it is the first anniversary of Sarah and Xiao Tian. They were married last August 13th during the Blackout at a lovely resort in the Kawarthas. It is also the first birthday of my cousin Madeline (yes, just like the book, but no red hair). I hope my gift made it to her... I am not very original I sent another  urlLink Madeline  book.  Also another first for me is that this is the second post for today. You must all revel in the glow of my ambition... I think I will have a nap before I cook dinner.

      On Wednesday night I went out for drinks with a friend of mine here in Ottawa.  L took me to a pub on Bank St that had the strangest client mix I have ever seen, at least recently.  There were highly polished government types through to a pair of old (I am going to go out on a limb and say border-line alcoholic), smelly men.  We had one drink and decided that the atmosphere was not all that cool and it was a bit odorous.  We picked up a bottle of wine and headed back to L's.  The major topic of the evening was blogging.  L is a veteran  urlLink photoblogger  and actually knows the 5th Muse that my other friend E is rather obsessed with.  I am making a vow to be a more dilligent blogger.   I am so enjoying my time here in Ottawa.  I love seeing people who I have not seen in a long time and I love the fact that I can wonder around all day and not see a single person that I know.  So different then Charlottetown, where you see and get seen constantly.  Last night (Thursday) I had dinner with a friend from university and kindergarten, and her new husband.  I had been at their wedding back in June.  They have a really nice appartment in the Glebe.  Neither of them are very domestic and they are still waiting for their sofa to arrive.  If it arrives while I am here I am invited to their sofa warming party.  Hanging out with married people is kind of weird, I don't have all that many married friends and most of them do not live anywhere near me, so there is no hanging out on a regular basis.  It was actually really nice, we had a good gossip about people we know from school and from PEI and I really do like her husband.  They were set up by a mutual friend two years ago and now they are married, so to anyone who wants to set me up I am all for it.

      So, I am actually here in Ottawa. My course is going well and it is great spending time with E. Today was a good day, I went to the  urlLink Museum of Civilization  in Hull (I stand corrected, in Gatineau). I had never been before and I did really enjoy it. The aboriginal exhibits are amazing. I really liked the  urlLink Bill Reid  work and the Haida art.  I walked from Hull back to Ottawa over the Alexandra Bridge, the city is so pretty.  Ottawa is very pretty even in the rain.  I left E's at about 10:00, just as I was getting to the bus stop it started to pour.  I went to the Rideau Centre and bought an umbrella and a new purse (I am a shopping monster, I can't help myself).  I think tomorrow I am going to continue being a tourist and go to the National Gallery or the War Museum. There is an exhibition of works with clowns on at the National Gallery, but I think I will give that one a miss. Clowns freak me out and all I can picture is the clown in the movie  urlLink It .  The course is going really quite well; there is nothing surprising or difficult about it. As in every course there is a woman who is annoying the crap out of me. She is about 45 and I do believe that she is recently divorced and she has commentary for everything. She is a self-proclaimed expert and has a personal anecdote for everything. I hate people like her. The rest of the people seem quite normal, there is a really interesting man from New Zealand taking the course. He is going to work in West Africa. His wife has been posted there with her job. He is a totally interesting guy, he was a stay at home Dad while they were living in Paris. I hope that I can adventually start leading such an interesting life.  I love being here in Ottawa; the anonymity of being in a city is so liberating. I think it would get a little bit tiring after a while, but right now I love it.  On the subject of anonymity, this is pretty funny (well it is to me).  I read a blog called  urlLink 5th Muse , E hooked me up to the link and I am addicted to reading about her life.  I aspire to being as dedicated to blogging as she is, she blogs everyday.  The thing is that she lives in Ottawa.  Today E went to Bridgehead to mark papers for her class and when I got home from the museum E's big news of the day was that she had been at Bridgehead at the same time as the blogger known as  urlLink 5th Muse .  E is really enthralled with the idea that she could have been sitting next to her in the coffee shop.  Not that E actually wants to out 5th Muse, at least not right now.  E is far more into the anticipation of maybe some day figuring out who 5th Muse is.  I think the whole thing is highly amusing but the idea of meeting her and not knowing is very tantelizing.  I promise there will be more on this.

      If manners are supposed to be free, why do so few people actually use them?  Saturday was a terrible day at the  urlLink place of marginal employment .  I don't know what gets into to people that they feel they can yell at members of the service industry for no good reason.  The sad thing is that my service industry job usually involves really nice people.  Saturday shattered that; one woman had a screaming (she actually screamed) fit because she was asked if she wanted or needed some help.  While it was not me she was actually yelling at, it was really disheartening to see someone be so boorish in the face of a polite question.  A simple no thank you is sufficient to let me and most of the people I work with that you just want to browse.  If you are bitchy to service people, you are contributing to the general decline in good service everywhere.  I have no problem with customers wanting things promptly, hell I am a demanding comsumer, although much nicer than I used to be (I have received a taste of my own medecine).  If you are not happy, ask to speak to the manager but for the love of god be polite.  People will, generally, do everything possible to solve your problem if they have been treated like a human being.   I am so glad that I am going to have some time away from being in the service industry.
