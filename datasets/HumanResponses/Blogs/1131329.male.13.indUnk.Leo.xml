      Hello again. It's about 9:13 over here in the puny little town of Valley View, Texas. And I tried to download a Windows XP update that was over 20 MB to no avail. I'm sittin' here watchin' TLC seeing babies get born. It's kinda sick to see them guys come out of there all bloody and stuff. Well, I'm starting to get dissappointed in Blogshares now. My blog has been listed but hasn't been indexed yet. That's ticking me off. I went to Houston last week, and I went to a geek's sanctuary, the  urlLink Johnston Space Center . It was totally awesome! In the meantime, see ya and read a  urlLink good blog  or two.  From YOUR geeky guy, Zach

      Hi all! I found a neat new site today. It's called  urlLink Blogshares . You join, and then you can buy ficticious shares of certain blogs in a ficticious stock market with ficticious money. I have just joined and it's a lot of fun. I'm here at home right now, about to to to my grandma's next door for lunch. She's making homemade soup. MMMMMMMMMMMMM. E ya' later!

      I just bought a new keyboard for 5 bucks at the Office Max while shopping for school supplies. Guess it works too. School starts in about two and a half weeks. And I'm ready. I got these really cool looking pens and a binder with countless pockets, (for $9.99, thanks for asking). If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna laugh by butt off at a site called  urlLink Homestar Runner . It has great flash animation and funny characters. Characters that you can imitate the voices of at the office. I'm gonna go see Strong Bad make fun of peoples e-mails.

      I'm about to head out to a family reunion tonight. There's gonna be a barbeque and everything. My relatives from the U.K. are here and that's one reason of throwing this party. And they're moving to the states this winter so that's gonna be cool. I think I'm gonna make some changes to the site so keep posted.

      I'm in Norman, Oklahoma at the moment. At my cousins apartment on the east side. The DSL out here is amazing! I still have dail-up and it's nonthing compared to this. I've been playing around with my aunts' old iBook. The new OS 10 on it is just about to kill it. Were about to go to Wal-Mart and buy her a microwave and grocries and 409. Man, her PC is a lot louder than mine.

      My geforce2 is working perfectly today. And all of my games look better so today's a good day. I just watched that Verizon commercial where that old guy that's always on their ads get's funky and gets this dance paty a dancin', (I got that phrase from Jimminy Glick). I'm going to Norman, Oaklahoma with my aunt tomorrow. I'm going to see my cousin's new apartment. She's a student at OU and has been moving around there pretty frequently. I hope they have Wi-fi somewhere in OU, or network jacks installed frequently in campus buildings. I feel sorry for  urlLink Leo  . He is the only person left on Techtv that's been there since they first went on the air, as ZDTV, in May '98. I'm gonna go sit in awe in front of my Sim City 4 game.

      I just finished putting in the video card I bought today at  urlLink Fry's . And talk about a pain! I had to download new drivers of the motherboard, then the instructions were written wrong in the book. Finally, after three hours trying to get this offbrand nVidia working, it works perfectly! I sure was starting to wonder if it was even going to work. But I learned a lot from the experience. One tip for ya'll, DO NOT buy video cards by Best Data. Simple as that.

      The RIAA has just started to send out lawsuits to people that download HUGE amounts of music on P2P networks. And Greg Berman wants to pass yet another bill that makes even people that download one song from P2P networks be vulnerable to lawsuits. I downloaded music very rarely, but now I have stopped completely. It's too risky. But for people who download HUGE amounts of songs, (100-500, I dunno), look for a letter from the RIAA. Ouch.

      Today's the day, I'm gonna get the cash for my video card! Ok, I'm just cashing in my coins today. As I told you, grandma's goin' to UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas for a pre-op for Glaucoma surgery. Chris Pirillo is having his Gnomedex convention on July 25 and 26 in Iowa and I know I'm not going, (seemed kinda boring according to the schedule). I wish ya'll could post comments to my messages, but I guess I'll have to find another service to do that.

      I'm here watching the Drew Carey show right now. Tomorrow me, my mom and my grandma are going to Dallas. Grandma is going to pre-op for a Glaucoma surgery. I'm gonna try to talk my mom into going to the  urlLink bank  and cashing in my jar of measly coins, into very useful, and pretty, wads of greenbacks. If I get enough, I can get my nVidia video card. Gonna take a shower.

I got my TigerDirect.com catalog yesterday hand have seen it cover to cover.  urlLink Neat stuff  in there, neat stuff. I'm here at my desk now watching the Peterson case on Courttv. Boring, but something to watch.

      Hi all! I just came home from the fireworks stand down the road and used all of my smoke bombs in 15 minutes. The 4th is just around the corner, and boy do I have some good stuff to fire up in the sky. If you think I smuggle fireworks into the city limits where it's illegal to st them off, you're wrong. I live in a rural area near Valley View, Texas and it's fine and good to fire 'em off here. I hope to have a good Independence Day, and I hope you do to. Until then, e ya' later!

I am only a few dollars away from buying a TI-83 Plus Silver Edition calculator, and I can't wait to buy it. I guess I'll see you later.  P.S.

      Hello there. I'm posting from my friends house and I am having a great time. I think the Germans are taking over my schools network. I saw a computer go nuts and show a wierd German phrase. Oh well. Our clueless network guy can't do anything about it so I guess the network will be taken over by Germans. Well have fun out there, go see your local High School battle it out this Friday night, and LONG LIVE KAZAA!!! :-)

One of my friends that I invited to my b-day party can't come, so now I can fit everybody in the car without somebody sitting in the back of my mom's 4Runner. I'm sooooo excited.

What a great way to celebrate tour birth by going somewhere you really don't wanna go. my cousins  urlLink blog  still hasn't got on a roll yet. I got it up liive for her but new messages have never been posted. Southwestern Bell (SBC), is now getting ticked off at the RIAA. Just one thing to say,  I love you SBC.

      Our Homecoming sucked yesterday. A guy got hurt and they had to bring a Careflite over, and we lost by who knows how much. But I'm going to work at the concession stand at the Soccer games, a little calmer down there. Who likes Linux? I know I do, but I don't have Linux on my computer, and I have a dilemma. I do not know which of the many builds of Linux to buy! If you know a good make of the Open-source Linux program, please say it in the shoutbox in the sidebar.

      Leo Laporte's new book came out this Tuesday, hat's off to him. I've been thumbing through my TAKS Study Guide. Useless crap. TAKS has  NO POINT WHATSOEVER  and I think it should just be a test that is taken at exit level in High School. I'm looking forward to going into the second week of my job this weekend. And I'm planning to bring a stereo. But me and my friend, when we were bored in the concessions stand. We had a good conversation about Linux and Mozilla and other stable alternatinves to Microsoft products. That made the time pass by quick when business was slow. Good times, good times.

      So far it appears that the kid saying he made that game, was a lie. But I'm not totally sure. My friend says that the game really sucks but I want to see it for myself. Out Junior High football game was canceled due to the rain over here today. All of the palyers were extremely ticked off. There's a new Foley's and Barnes & Noble in the local mall and I'm going there after work on Saturday. I guess I'll see you l8r.

      Hello there! There's this kid at school that has made a video game, or at least helped. It's called Septerra Core, (say something in the Shoutbox if you know anything about it). He's gonna give me a copy of it. I hope it's worth it. I'm starting my first major job on Saturday, the concession stand at the Cooke County Soccer Association. Hey, if you're reading this right now and your'e going to be at the Soccer games on Saturday, go to the concession stand and say hi to me. I'll be there all day.

I'm not exactly sure if that one has Wi-fi or not. I would have bought Leo Laporte's new book if it hadn't have cost so much. But please, support this excellent bookstore now in the Golden Triangle Mall, you'll be glad you did. VERY IMPRESSIVE! Have a great evening!

Well, I can see what happed back in the ultimate decade on VH1, so I'm covered.  I apologize for not posting in forever. School has just been a huge load so I haven't had time. I will try to go for a few posts a week. I haven't heard much news lately about Kazaa and the RIAA, and I'm getting worried. I hope the RIAA runs out of steam in the next couple of months.

      MOVIE REVIEW: "Good Boy!" Rated PG, was pretty funny, I liked that Molly Shannon and Kevin Nealon played in the movie, but the kid that talked to the dogs and stuff, was a horrible actor. It seems like the movie crew just slapped this movie together. Good movie, bad actor, I give it 2 out of 5 stars.

      Man, last night I bet I didn't get but about 3 hours of sleep. But you know whenever you think you've only been sleeping for a few minutes it's really a few HOURS. Well, I just got the DesktopX Version 1.99, the last version released before the real DesktopX 2 comes out, and it's really fun. I have a uptime timer, RAM usage meter, and a analog clock. My friend is staying the night tomorrow, and after work, we'll head out to the Texas Sate Fair. That's gonna be a blast. Well, gonna get more widgets for DX.

      Today marks the end of a truly excellent Thanksgiving holiday. A small and rushed thanksgiving party, a trip Dallas to my grandma's Glaucoma check-up, a day at the Denton Crossing shopping center, and then building a fence. Well, now that you mention it, it was just half and half, half great, half crap. But, a week off from the repetitive grind of school makes a man feel good. One of my best friends has probably went to another school now. I didn't see her online to find out, so I guess I'll see tomorrow. Now, to mourn the loss, crank up the Tears for Fears.  "Shout, Shout, let it all out..."

       urlLink Chris Pirillo  now officailly hates Microsoft Outlook 2003. I am surely not going to buy it, good or not. I just don't like Microsoft period, but I'm stuck with this Windows powered PC until I get the cash for the Apple iBook G4 I've been in awe over. Did ya hear?! Apple Power Mac PC's are banned in Europe due to the government thinking that Apple Computer Corporation is lying when they say that the Power Mac G5 was the fastest PC ever. Well, it's their loss. Keep the flu away y'all.

      Now on my third keyboard. My last one only cost me five bucks. I got this one for free. My dad found this one in the network room at a school he went to to reboot the phone systems. I've got to overhaul the site again, lost the Blogger logo now I have to revamp the site to get it back. I'll post again after the site redo, (should take a few minutes).  Behold the power of an Apple, Zach

      I stayed home last Friday couse I had a dad cold and a fever of 100.But now I am better and closer to my iBook goal. I'm listening to Billy Idol on ITunes for WINDOWS! Can you believe it? Just scoot on over to the Apple web site and get the new version for your Mac or PC. Keep on the look out for a new article on  urlLink Zachville  called: "Battle of the Browsers". It will showcase some of the best browsers out there and which one is worth the download. Stay tuned.   Lovin" the '80's no matter what, Zach

      I'm here listening to my favorite  urlLink radio station . I'm out of school of a whole week for Turkey Day. I'll love that, except for my favorite Thanksgiving party at my aunt's in Dallas isn't going to happen. So the only time I'll have to stuff my face with a dry, tasteless bird is at my Grandma's in Justin. My E-mail has been resurrected after being down since Friday. Thank you for that. (Hey, that's one thing I'm thankful for.) Well, time to send corny thanksgiving e-cards to everyone on my address list.

      Having second thoughts about buying the iBook. Too darn expensive, and there are some other, smaller items I would like. (Hmmmmmm, Doc Martens shoes? Palm Zire? TI-83 Plus SE? Cheese?)  I would also wish all of the veterans of America a happy Veteran's Day. I would have put up fireworks on the site but didn't have the time. As Pres. Bush says, "God bless 'merica."  Now for my list if Bush-isms: Nukeular- Nuclear Substantionable- substantial How much is this many?- His counting system. Gakkk! Ugh! Bleaccch!- Pretzel choking incident.

      Sorry, I got carried away in that last post. This Saturday, I'll have nothing to do since work is over. I might go to the new Best Buy in the Denton shopping center, (even though they do not sell Apples). But other than that I guess I'll do nothing. I need to think of a strategy. I'll see you next post.

      Finally, after twelve to thirteen weeks of waiting, getting mad, and gouging my eyeballs out, I FINALLY got my video card rebate check for ten dollars at Best Data Products, INC. A few months ago, I purchased a nVidia geforce 2 video card from Fry's Electronics and then sent in the rebate crap, then I finally got it, WEEKS LATER. Well, the week has started in a positive tone today, how 'bout yours?  Good. Now, TIME TO CLIP FINGERNAILS!!!

Leo, look at what they're doing to your glorious book, CHEATING people out of their money with it, TRICKING people with it! It's horrible Mr. Laporte, DO SOMETHING about it. I'm upset , I'm gonna go cry now.

      About to go to work. Today is my last official day of work, then I may work at the soccer tourney, that's next week if I'm not mistaken. My grandma needs new memory in her old Gateway Essental that's about five years old, and it's slower than Christmas. Our varsity football team was beaten to a pulp last night. I am  deeply dissapointed . Dunno what I'll do after work today. There's a new Best Buy in Denton now, I'll see if I can stop by there. I'll be back next post when our subject will be,  eggs .

      NEW YEAR'S UPDATE: Approx. 35 min. 'til midnight, (CST), NY is celebrating, w.bloggar still isn't working, computer still working, ABC is on the air, time for a new blog posting tool, I'm tired, Dick Clark is still old, so the world hasn't come to an end.

      I had to post the last post and this post with the web-based Blogger client due to my w.bloggar program being on the fritz again. 10;06 in Texas, 11:06 in NY. Does Dick Clark sound a little corny this year, like he doesn't care? Well, maybe he cares, he's just corny, but he's cool, (I guess).

      The countdown to 2004 is ticking, and in Central time, there's approximately three hours to go until the new year. I saw a entry in Leo Laporte's book, (yes, I did buy it, thanks for asking), and I saw a program that could copy copyright protected CD's and DVD's called  urlLink Alcohol 120% . It looked like a great program, but I didn't want to pay fifty bucks for it. Before I end this post, I want to say that Leo has one wopper of a book. It's great. I can't wait until next year's version.

      Mail-in Rebates. Stupid, pointless, and a waste of paper. Why couldn't they sell the flat-panel monitor for $250 bucks instead of $450 with a mail-in rebate. These rebates vary from big ticket items to a Sim City 4 expansion pack. Best Buy is the worst when it comes to this retarded business practice.That's why I go to Fry's, because most of the time they just have rebates given by the MANUFACTURER, not the store.  In the meantime, I wish all of my readers a prosperous new year!

      Last hour of the Help-A-Thon. Boy has it been great! I want to congratulate Leo Laporte, Cat Shwartz, Roger Chang, Kevin Rose, and all of the others for putting this 12 hour extravaganza together without collapsing in the proccess. Man, I bet Leo is ready to go home right about now. I remember when Chris Pirillo did 18 hurs of endless questions and other crap. Pirillo is now living in Los Angeles without his dog Sprocket and his wife Gretchen. To wach the last hout of the marathon, go to channel 191 on Dish Network, or 394 on Directv.

A straight twelve hours of Leo, Cat, Roger, and many others in a live San Fransisco telecast. I have also got a new program that you import old, crackling, popping, hissing albums on your PC, clean up the sound, then burn them to a CD, witch is absolutely AWESOME!

      It's amazing how the peer to peer file sharing programs have increased and decreased in populary in the past few years. Last year, I saw a article in  Smart Computing Magazine  about what P2P program was best! That's back when it was legal but the RIAA was just getting rustled about the situation. Now the P2P program's populatity has steadily decreased because of the fartknockers at the RIAA. What made me say these things is that I was at this website of a European ISP and saw a ACTUAL AD for Morpheus. I thaught that was cool because they're still spending the money they have to get more customers. Even though it's illegal, I still think it's the best way to get sinle tracks of music. Well, gonna see Conan

Leo Laporte just got back from CES, and he seems like he doesn't want to go back to Vegas for another million years. I just got another book on Saturday, Windows XP Hacks from the king of computer instruction books, O'Reilly. On by bookshelf, it's making a great companion to Leo's Tech Almanac. Google Hacks would be great, too.

      The first day back to school, a wierd new teacher, and a friend moving away, today has kinda been crap. I am glad, however, that the Detroit car show is now underway. I also got my Popular Mechanics magazine. NASA has finally done something right for the first time since the earlier Mars rover that flew off into the depths of space without even getting close to Mars. The new Mars rover, known as "Spirit", has landed safley, and is bringing back great pictures of Mars. Kudos to NASA! Our new building at school is now officially DONE! It was due at the beginning of the school year, but they got way behind. Move-in will start next week, then we'll be in in around two weeks. LOVE Leo's new book, and I expect to get next year's version. Still saving for a flat panel monitor, and I'm getting pretty darn close. You can run, monitor, but you cant hide.

      I'm starting a new segment of news every week on Friday that covers tech news, fun stuff, and my special technology finds in the internet during the week. So here we go!  Bill Gates is once again the richest man in the world with a net worth of $46 Billion. What else is new?  Yesterday, Clear Channel, one of the leading owners of radio stations around the world, dropped the Howard Stern talk show put on by Infinity. Now  that's  good news.  If you haven't updated Windows XP since you bought your computer, (like me), you can now get a Windows Update CD for free from Microsoft. This is for people who have lots of updates to download but have only a dail-up connection, (once again, like me), I've requested mine, you may want to. (It includes all of the updates through Ocober 2003.)  On this day, Apple Computer discontinued their PDA, the Newton, in 1998.

I've just found another great game in the under $10 aisle, it's called Capitalism 2 and the only problem is that there isn't anyone in the Online play EVER. I may find someone. Oh! and I was in the background of a live news shot when the news people were here.   And don't forget, Bonham Chrysler sucks.

      Today was quite a crappy day, for us and for Bonham Chrysler. They didn't get the sale and we didn't accept the lame deal they gave us. The dealer even tried not to give us the keys to our truck back until he came up with another idea. I'm going to get groceries today, so I'll look at the Gamecube games whie I'm at it.

       urlLink Brookstone  is the best store on earth. The men's cologne is hard to find in the Foley's. They play good music in the hall. Not enough bathrooms. Gamecube hasn't been available at Gamestop since after Christmas. My visit was heavenly.

      Here in North Texas it snowed around 4 inches yesterday, a blizzard in our book. I'm headed to Vista Ridge Mall tomorrow, that doesn't happen very often. The mall I usually go to is the tiny,  very tiny  Golden Triangle Mall in Denton. Today might just be your regular old boring day.

      Source code for Microsoft's Windows XP operating system is now being seen on P2P networks. It has also been found that there is profanity in the notes in the source code. The code is probably available on Kazaa but the file, (uncompressed), is much over 600 MB. Ouch!

      Thursday, February 12, 2004  CAPPSII report ships, head of program resigns   The General Accounting Office has released a report on the CAPPSII airline-profiling system that is so damning, the head of the program resigned before the report shipped.  The Supreme Court decided in Bowsher v. Synar that the GAO is part of the legislative branch, not the executive,1 and therefore Presidents and their legal advisors consistently maintain that the GAO can have no role in executing the laws. That conclusion follows naturally from the earlier Chadha decision, which held that the only way in which the legislative branch may affect the legal rights duties or responsibilities of persons outside the legislative branch is by legislation&acirc;&euro;&#8221;passage in both houses (bicameralism) followed by presentment of the act to the President (presentment) for signature or veto (which can then be overridden).2  In light of these very clear precedents, the White House announced at the time GW Bush signed the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2004 that it would treat the report as advisory only. This is a reasonable legal position, and probably the one a court would adopt, although one could also argue that the favorable report requirement can't be severed from the appropriation and that therefore the unconstitutionality of the one implies the invalidity of the other.

      You got that right. Well, I  almost  killed the computer. On Techtv I found a neat new program that changes the Windows shell called  urlLink Litestep , (basically, it makes Windows look pretty). It may work on your computer if you try it, but on mine, my internet quit working, and I wasn't very happy. Also, a computer at school crashed at the least convenient time, (they always pick that time), and that sucked. We dearly need new computer systems. I wonder if you can recall a superintendent like a governor.

      Another good day today, but something very unlucky happened. I was going to the bathroom at school, not big deal, right? Well, I needed to take a #2 when there was nobody in the stall, but the door was locked. SO I had to crawl UNDER the stall door into the stall to get in, (nasty), and when I praised myself for my good thinking, about to sit down when I noticed, NO TOILET PAPER! So I got out of the stall and decided to get some paper from the hand towel dispenser, only thing was, the handle to dispense the paper was STUCK. There was a wad of paper stuck inside and was blocking the handle from moving. So I had to go to another restroom accross campus to relive myself. But all is ok now. I'm, thinking of a computer project to do, I've had a huge itch to do one, but I don't know what to do. But before I go I want to say that I'm so thankful that I have toilet paper.

After the walk there will most likely be mounds of FREE FOOD! Come and help the cause of MS research and creation of a cure for this deadly disease.   urlLink Google  has been heavily simplified.

It is extremely easy and you can pay with check, credit card, or a Wal-Mart shopping card, (gift card), and it downloads fairly quickly on a dial-up connection. There were a few glitches in the beginning, but I'm pretty sure that it was my computer's fault. Now it works perfectly. I give it a 4 1/2 out of 5!

      Go ahead, arm yourelves with knowledge.  TechTV could be on it's way to its end. Comcast, (the evil, crappy cable company), has purchased the now declining tech network. Comcast is expecting to squish their gaming channel, G4, and TechTV into one big fat channel. In my humble opinion, this puts TechTV even farther into the crapper.  Leo Laporte is leaving The Screen Savers, after six years of comitted service to geeks around the world. He will announce his leave in just minutes form now.

A internet worm called Witty, overthrowed coputers and servers at one company today. The worm died off quickly after infecting over 20,000 machines.  Last week there was a big rumor that Microsoft was going to buy the shrinking internet giant AOL. Ity is now proven it is not true.   Intel is going to start re-naming their chip names with 300, 500, and 700 model series. Intel says it will better organize their proccessor speeds, cache size, etc.

      If you have Dish Network, you're probably ticked off right now due to MTV, VH1, Nickelodeon, Nickelodeon's Nicktoons, Comedy Central, and your local CBS channel being off the air. This is because the parent company of these stations, Viacom, wanted to raise the rate of Dish Network's contract with these channels by 40%. Dish Network didn't want to go through with the deal because they felt that the raised fee would raise the customer's bill by atronomical amounts.   Please notify the following companies your opinion:  MTV Networks: 212-258-8000 Viacom: 212-256-6000  Contact the CEO of DIsh Network via CEOofdishnetwork@dishnetwork.com

      President Bush has made a statement that he wants to make all internet tax free and slackoff on regulations in order to make high-speed internet availabe to everyone by thge year 2007.  CNET has done it again! They have released a FREE music download service that contains music from independent artists.  AT&T, the phone company from that really hot place downstairs, is being sued from SBC, the angel of the phone companies. AT&T is in trouble because they have falsely shown long distance calls as local calls and didn't charge the local phone companies enough to cover the bill. I'm on SBC's side on this.   FUN & GAMES:  urlLink Internet Scrabble Club    This site was a lot of fun. I really suck at Scrabble but it really does drive you to increase your vocabulary. You can access the game by a java applet on the site of downloading a program. But it's not a very graphical interface. You have to use commands to access most features. I give it a 3 out of 5.

But there is a program that can lock your Windows 98 machine by using  urlLink System Lock .  System Lock is an amazingly small and simple program just over 100kb. I was impressed by is sheer simplicity. Just set a password and you're done! There are a few more options, but they don't really need to be changed. The website said that on 2000 and XP the program was easily bypassable, but I found no way to bypass the password screen. This program will definately get rid of your Windows 98 security problems.  5 OUT OF 5

The software in question is MySQL and JBoss.  Four days after the merger of G4 and TechTV, ("G-Day",) and it is still not appealing. Their  urlLink website  really sucks. Don't be suprised if you are bomabrded with errors when you get there, and the navigation is horrible.  Apple's movin' on up. The angels sing as a new Apple store is built at The Carousel Center in Syracuse, NY.  In observance of Memorial Day, this is a fun program called  urlLink Deskflag  from Tiger Technologies.

Microsoft will release SP2 this summer, and the software giant is planning on spending $300 million to deploy it. It's a whopping 100MB and and it will be able to be purchased as a Cd for $10.  A demo of Call for Duty for the Mac is now available from the games publisher, asparagus.  Eharmony.com, the dating service made by Dr. Niel Clark Warren, has patented their matchmaking test that matches people on 29 different dimensions.

I am trying to set up a message board to be ready soon.   The first two file sharers sued in South Dakota are two women that are being sued by FIVE record labels. Ouch.   TechTV's final day is here, tomorrow TechTV will be merging with gaming channel G4 to create G4TechTV. I give them a year.  As of now there are over 100 legal online music stores on the net.

      Ok guys, time for another update.  Legend of Zelda fans, it's time for another awakening.  The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures for Gamecube is here!  There are so many awesome features!  Let's start with the new single player mode (oh, and the graphics are all like Legend of Zeldas for Gameboy, only with a little more real-life 3-D and a bit of cartooning from Wind Waker.).  In this, you'll be able to control all 4 Links as you battle through hordes, and I literally mean HORDES of monsters, mights, and magics in one setting to reach your goal.  Not to mention the different formations that you can use.  They are as follows: wide (horizontal), long (vertical), cross, and box.  The plot is like this:  You meet Shadow Link and he tricks you into pulling out the Four Sword, releasing Vaati, that wind sorcerer that you all met in GBA's Four Swords.  You go throughout the land of Hyrule searching for him and try to put him back.  As for multiplayer, enjoy stabbing your teammates in the back!  After going to Tingle's tower, you'll be able to play many multiplayer games with your GBA's, all connected to the GCN of course.  Well, that's all I got for now.  Next time I'll come back with Sony's PSP:  Sony's version of Nintendo DS.  'Till then!

After Microsoft crunched the numbers of licensing and support, Windows Server 2003 was cheaper than Redhat Enterprise Linux and Suse Linux. When it comes to OS's, Microsoft, more is better.  ATTENTION ALL APPLE USERS! OS X 10.3.4 "Tiger" is now available from the update preference pane.   Apple's Japan division has leaped from sixth to second in the PC category. First Japan, then the world!  Good news for gamers! Playing Dance Dance Revolution actually has been reported helping people to lose weight. I can't see how people don't go into cardiac arrest palaying that game.  BBC says that more people are spending money on their cell phone these days. On an average, people spend &pound;45, (in Britian,) on their cell phone coverage.

      Happy belated birthday Bob Dylan! Bob turned 53 Monday.  Over the last quarter, Tivo added 264,000 subscribers to it's service. Yay!  Toy's 'R Us is pretty mad right now. They are suing Amazon.com, their online sales provider, for showing their arch competition's prices on their website along with Toys 'R Us's prices, causing them to lose sales.  Spam messages now account for over 70% of e-mail messages. Ouch.

      The RIAA is at it again! The music recording industry has sued another 493 illegal file swappers. Kazaa is like smoking, it's hard to quit, but I went cold turkey. I've been Kazaa free for almost a year, I buy on  urlLink Walmart.com  now.  Talk about helping the community. A North Dakota company is looking for used computers to refurbish and donate to disabled kids. Jay Gunderson does thas service non-profit and out of his home.  Microsoft is ticked. Lindows, a crossbreed of Linux and Windows, is being grilled by Microsoft for copyright infringement. Lindows, quivering in their boots, changed their name to Linspire. They'll be crushed by the flabby arm of Microsoft.  John Kerry, democratic presidential hopeful, has the Bush campaign on his back, using Google. Try this! If you go to Google, type in waffles, you'll get John Kerry's website as the top result. John Kerry has been Google-bombed by his republican foes.

      I finally got my old aggregator back so the news is back on track.  A small canadian computer manufaturer is suing CPU giant Intel because Intel used the company's patented circuitry in their Pentium proccessors. THe lawsuit is at $500 million.  This is a slap in the face for all Apple users. Apple released one of their first security updates concerning the help viewer in Panther and Jaguar.  A judge in Baltimore, Maryland has ruled for Microsoft to search its computer systems to explain an executive's instructions to employees to erase old e-mails.   A mostly deserted California small town, Bridgeville, was put on eBay a year ago. But when it's bidder, and his $1.8 million dollars didn't show up. The town was sold off of eBay for $700,000. It just prove to you that you can sell anything on eBay.

      I have a news aggregator now so I can continue being the bottom sucker of the news world.  Owners of hybrid cars such as the Toyota Prius have been dissapointed in their gas mileage, probably because they were speeding. How much a person punches the gas dictates how much gas the vehicle sips.  Symantec is buying anti-spam company Brightmail. I believe this is a good move.  This  urlLink news aggregator  sucks. I'm switching.

      Leo Laporte and the gang buried  Call for Help  today. The final episode will air tomorrow. I will miss CFH, and I blame G4 for their stupid idea to get rid of it. I hope G4TechTV will suffer for this. G4 is trying to sell the show to another network.  Apple is sending iTunes to China. They will also distribute iTunes in all HP computers and HP will sell a pretty blue iPod with the HP logo.  Microsoft has released a date for the new version of Windows. The new version, codenamed  Longhorn , will be released in 2006.  The Queen can now download her favorite Elton John song. Napster has been released in the UK.

      Google is teaming up with Microsoft to make a software that assists in finding files on personal compuers. Google, why do you do this to us? Billy Gates says his company needs to catch up in the search business. MSN should crawl under a rock and die.  Dell is pulling out the red carpet for their new line of Axiom PDA's. Dell's new toys include Bluetooth technology and proccessors boasting speeds up to 624 Mhz.  AT&T throws a curveball once again. The phone company that everyone loves to hate has pulled out of local services in Ohio after SBC, the owner of the cables AT&T leases, raised their rental rates.  It's official! Cingular has now purchased AT&T Wireless and  will  merge. They agreed after they lost 250,000 users last quarter.

      Wal-Mart's test of their new RFID tage in merchandise has been quite successful. The RFID tags were used in stores and warehouses in the Dallas area. They say that the electronic tags will lower the amount of thefts, and keep their stores better stocked.  Apple is a clever group! They are attempting to get a patent on the translucent widow effect that is planned in the new version of Windows, (code named  Longhorn .) This is a big punch in the face for Microsoft.  This is a great move for Apple. Apple is planning to slow the intervals of releases of new versions of OS X. They are going to show off their new version of OS X, "Tiger", at the Worldwide Developers Conference next month.  Nasal rap singer Eminem sued Apple for copyright infringement, but the judge overruled it, so Apple is back to their spotless record.  We may even have ANOTHER contributor soon, Heather Cheney will be providing us with Mac facts and tips. Expect her to make her debut this weekend.  This has been a Mac filled day!

      All right guys!  Time for another Update!  Ok, this is whats the latest in the underground:  You know GBA SP?  Not anymore!  Check out this blast from the past: SP is going retro!  Nintendo has decided to give SP a makeover which looks like the old NES controls!   Not only that, but they're reviving the games for it too!  The release date is to be July 7th and the Classic NES series has been estimated at a retail price of $19.99.  Oldies RULE!      Next up, it's spring time and you know what Mario's thinking:  Golfing for cash?  I'm game!  Mario Golf: Advance Tour is coming to the GBA.  It has a RPG type story mode and you'll enter tournaments, practice your skills, boost your stats, and, this is the best part, earn the right to play AGAINST Mario and his pals.  Camelot did it this time!      As some of you may noticed, GBA videos are starting to hit the scene!  Pokemon is the only one that's been mentioned so far, but there's more on the way.  Nintendo has set up some awesome contracts with developers to bring you these titles: Yu-Gi-Oh!, Sonc X, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, The Fairly Oddparents!, Spongebob Squarepants, All Grown Up!, Dora the Explorer, and Strawberry Shortcake, all published by Majesco.  Some of the other Pokemon episodes are planned to be released on June 21st, not May as was previously thought.      Sega Fans!  Remember Puyo Pop?  GCN's giving it a makeover.  Here's the lowdown on the new features: a new fever mode that accelerates combo actions(Better have nerves of steel for this, or you'll break under the pressure!), new puzzle pieces including triple an quadruple sets, and 13 new characters.      Going on down the list, EA Games has gone for another motion picture: Catwoman.  The game will be for GCN and GBA, debuting later in the summer.  I'm not too crazy about the graphics, but overall, this looks like a fair game with some nice combat.      Dragon Ball Z is taking over GBA this summer as Banpresto and Webfoot(who else) bring you two promising titles: Dragon Ball Z: Super Sonic Warriors and Dragon Ball Z: Buu's Fury.  Both are fighter games, unlike the Legacy of Goku series, but the graphics look fairly decent, considering all the different things to display and the limited memory.      Racing fans, check it out: Room Zoom for the GCN puts you in control of an RC car and allows you to drive around in a mansion(think of the possiblities!)!  The graphics are all excellent and this looks to be a very promising game.      Don't tell me there's more!  But oh yes.  I should have more info next month, but these titles have entered the spotlight:  Killer 7 by Capcom, Second Sight by Free Radical, Ribbit King by Bandai, and I-Ninja by Namco(along with 5 other great titles).      Halo fans, I recommend that, if you have the right computer, you buy Halo for the PC.  You can do sooo much more with Halo for PC than for X-Box.  Not only that, but there are more built in features.  Halo for the PC allows you to use the Fuel-Rod Guns in multiplayer, along with a Flamethrower, and you can use the Rocket Launcher Warthog.  Not to mention the great mods that you can get.  A good site for them is http://www.halomods.com  Just recently added was Halo Custom Edition and the Halo Editing Kit.  Custom Edition is for multplayer only and has it's own dedicated server.  Not to mention the ability to use custom-made maps.  The HEK allows you to create and use your own maps, with any weapons on your computer, any vehicles, and you can put them any place you want and use any decals you wish.  To download both, go to http://www.gearboxsoftware.com and go to the Forums section.  From there, go to the Halo CE and HEK discussion thread and from there, to the obviously named thread.     Well, that's it for this Update!  Until next time!      P.S. Hey, give us some feedback!  Tell me if there's something your interested in, or something you would like to see me get some info, or give my opinion on and I'll be happy to oblige.

      The new version of w.bloggar is on it's way. Users who donate to the makers of w.bloggar got a sneak peek. The new version, 4.0, sould be here by the end of May.  Some German guys came up with what I think is a revolutionary piece of software. They have created a program, named PearPC, that can emulate Mac OS X on a regular Intel or AMD computer. Despite the excellent idea, the program is extremely buggy and excruciatingly slow. The creators say that you shouldn't use it with important files, or it will over time screw them up.  GREAT DEAL: I was at Fry's Electronics on Saturday when I found a Hitachi 90GB HD ranging from $90-$100 new and $80-$86 refurbished.  We are expecting a new contributor as of June 6th. Seth Stockton will be making consumer reports, web site reviews, and will dabble in XBOX news. Please give him a warm welcome!

      We've been around for over a year, and since our excellent provider, Blogger, has improved their services, we have totally re-vamped the site, and there's more to come!  We are expecting to get more contributors to submit articles to the site.  You can expect more pictures to be placed on the site because of a new software we have just recived to allow us to do so.  You may now also place comments on posts because of Blogger's new comment service. Please no vulgar language or offensive remarks in your comments.  Expect to see posts on more frequent intervals because of more contributors.

      Hello one and all!  As previously stated, I am Jace.  I'll be your guy for all your video gaming needs, keeping you up-to-date with systems, games, and anything else you can think of.  So, to start off, let's go to this year's E3(Electronic Entertainment Expo) convention to tell you off the latest systems, or should I say, systEM.  Yes, this is it ladies and gentlemen:  The Nintendo DS!  Check it out!  This thing has 2 LCD screens which allows you to view your game from 2 prospectives at once!  For example, you could be playing a racing game.  The lower screen would have your racing view and the top would have a map and position listing.  Not only that, but they can reproduce a 3-D view and, like SP, are backlit.      Next we have the new Touch-Screen capability.  This thing will allow you to operate your games like a PDA!  Now you don't just have to rely on buttons!      That's not it!  This thing now has a Microphone port!  This means that you can use voice-commands to hand-clapping to perform basic operations!      Guess what!  Wireless networking!!!  You can now perform multiplayer tasks on a local wireless network with up to 16 players!  Quadruple the fun!  You have a range of up to 30 feet, but later you'll be able to go far beyond that, possibly by nationwide hub connections.  Also, there will be a LAN connection on which you could allow, theoretically, an infinite amount of players to connect at a hot spot and compete.  The protocol by which the wireless communication operates allows high response rates for real-time play and low battery consumption.      Messenger capabilities!  You can use a touch-screen keyboard or microphone to chat, send drawings, and more!      Wireless Game Sharing!  Certain games will be able to compete on wireless networks, even if only one person has the game!  Some will even allow you to test-play games!      As stated earlier, the system will have 3-D capabilities, which can surpass images similar to the N-64!  The 60 fps rate will allow details like fog effects and cel shading!      Speakers are now 16-channel and allows for a wider variety of voices, music, and enriched SFX.  A headphones jack is included for stereo sound.      Power management is excellent, using a rechargeable battery with low-energy consumption design.  It has Sleep mode functions as with SP, but also a new Standby mode!  The Standby mode is used mostly for multiplayer if the other is sends an IM.      The processing will be two processors: 1 ARM9 and 1 ARM7      The media format is new also!  They are now making compact cards with a semi-conductor memory, allowing lower cost, shorter manufacturing time, and more than 1 Gigabit of mem!      Finally, we have dual slots!  It will be able to read GBA games and developers are working on a way to connect between DS and GBA games!      Tell me this is not awesome for a portable sys!  But if you want to check it out yourself, you can learn just about everything I've listed here and more at http://www.nintendo.com/e3_2004/ds/index.jsp  Tomorrow: More about games displayed at the E3 convention!

      I've been working all day trying to upgrade my XP home PC to pro and to no avail. I even spent a hundred bucks on a HD and it still didn't work. At least I have a decent slave drive now.  Yahoo is trying to compete with Google's new e-mail service. Yahoo announced that they were going to expand the size of their member's storage from 6MB to a wopping 100MB. I still doesn't even come close to Google's 1GB of storage.  CNN changed their on-site search engine to Yahoo from Google. Traitors.   urlLink Blogger  changed their look this past week. The newly streamlined site now contains a comment system, (thank God,) and many more great-looking templates. I am truly impressed.  Hope you like the new look of the site.

      The House of Reps. is thinking about altering the DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act). The Movie Industry isn't very happy about this, but it will improve the way of life of geeks one and all.  A high school in California has banned the use of the ever popular camara phone after a student was caught using one to cheat on a test. Uh oh.  Last week, Apple's iTunes music store reached a milestone, thay sold 3.3 million songs last week. I'm proud.  Symantec is issuing paches for four very serious flaws in their Anti-Virus systems.

      I will be heading off to San Antonio tomorrow morning and they're will most likely not be a computer readily available so I'll most likely be posting a few audio posts from the city of the Alamo.  Sun Microsystems and Apple both have products code named "Tiger", and both have big release parties in Vegas. Apple has their new version of OS X, and Sun's new version of Java. This will cover the gaping wound that the Comdex cancellation ripped into Vegas.  Not much else happening in the tech world as of yet. Oh! What! Have you heard that Call for Help is starting back up? Leo Laporte made a deal with G4TechTV Canada to tape a new show in Toronto weekly. The new Call for Help will not be available in the US.

      After one week of little sleep and a small bout with minor strep throat, I am finally back and doing well.  Sorry, everyone, Comdex '04 has been cancelled. This has been decided due to a lack of interest. Comdex what?  Internet Explorer users are in big troubles. IE contains a flaw that could lure malicious code into your system. In my humble opinion,  urlLink clicking on this link could solve the problem .  On June 22, Bob Bemer, a Texan and creator of the escape key died at his home after a fight with cancer. When I had my old computer, escape was the most used key.  Hotmail, in the spirit of their evil monopoly ways, raised their free membership storage space from 2 to 250 MB. Still not even close to Gmail.

      You will not see any new posts on TMS from now until Saturday, June 26, because I am going to church camp in Madill, Oklahoma. I will not have any access to the internet or a phone so I bid you farewell for a week. You can expect a post the day I get back.

      Gmail is a high demand email service that isn't available to the mainstream just yet, but you can get an account by being a nice, giving person, or just plain lucky.  I've heard some rumors that people have been selling Gmail invites on eBay. Selling invites to a free service is just an unfair way to make a dollar.   An easier, and free way to get a Gmail account is a website called  urlLink  Gmail Swap  . You can get a Gmail invite by giving something in return. One guy offered me his mom's brownie recipe and is thanks, I just took his thanks, but I told him he could send the recipe anytime he wanted.  Another way to get an account is with luck. Some people, on message boards, like to give an account to a random poster on a thread, I did this today at Leoville Town Square and it went over quite well.  Giving a Gmail account is the ultimate way to make you feel like you did something good today, and you didn't even have to pay a dime.

      The lottery of the state of Texas has reached a record high and still hasn't been won. The jackpot has now exceeded the new "Mega Millions" program's jackpot and is now at a whopping $145 million. I wish I had a good 50 quick picks on that one.  The jerk I was talking about in my last audio post, a former youth minister, has decided to give the little boy the foul ball he stole from him two nights ago at the Texas Rangers game.  I am giving away a free Gmail invite to the lucky Leoville Town Square member that posts on the "Free Gmail Invite Raffle" thread between now and noon central time. Good luck!

      Dave Winer, creator of Weblogs.com, suddenly disabled 3,000 blogs the website listed last weekend, and no blog owner is happy. I owned one of those 3,000 blogs, and I am infuriated at Winer at this moment. The cause of the event was the extreme load the database was putting on Dave's servers, and his pocketbook, so he unplugged the servers.  Tablet PC's, the biggest flop of the PC market, is said to be growing in popularity in some places, but is still not taking of in the business field.  Sprint workers are mad right about now, the cell phone giant cut 1,100 workers from it's payroll.  After being mashed to a pulp by video game and movie companies, 321 Studios, makers of DVDXCopy, may be at death's door. The company that had once 400 employees is now down to 20.   Maxtor and Lynksys are getting married! Well, they're at least teaming up to create a wireless hard drive.  Apple's stock, (APPL), has reached an all time high of $32.74. Way to go, Apple!  Camera manufacturer Nikon has announced they may move away from film cameras. The little roll of brown plastic is finally going out of style.

      It has been a while since the end of TechTV, and the last reminder of what a great network TTV used to be will soon be gone. As of July 2nd, G4TechTV will close the old studios in San Fransisco, and relocate all operations to Los Angeles. Then the full change will take effect, enveloping TechTV into a mass of immature programming and corny hosts and topics. TechTV will be gone, for good. There's been a murder on Cable road, and the pigs at Comcast commited the crime.

      The FBI has arrested suspects in several countries to charge them with the theft of the Half-Life 2 source code. Now that it needs to be re-coded, the release is expected this summer.  In Germany, all McDonald's locations will use Suse Linux for their operations.  Gateway is dying, they have shut down all operations in Sioux Falls, S.D. in order to save money.  I've heard the new "Chronicles of Riddick" movie was  urlLink bad . So watch out and keep your expectations low.  Yesterday, Griffin Technologies released their FM transmitter, the iTrip, for the iPod mini.

I am here for a PC repair and upgrading class with stuff I pretty much already knew. Its been a lot of fun ripping apart old computers just to put them back together.  I'm gonna play Stick RPG now.

      Eighteen illegal file-swappers in the UK have squeezed out of the firm grip of the IFPI by settling in court. The International Federation of Phonographic Industries has sued over 200 swappers. This was a close one.  Nokia is shriveling like a prune. Due to tough competition, Nokia's share of the market shunk to 28.8% in 2003.  Fred Anderson, former CFO of Apple computer, has been named as one of Apple board members. I have no idea of how this is going to affect them.  This is out of this world! Toshiba is including Napster on their laptops. Odd, very odd.

      Our site has been here for over a year, and I have never told you about our roots.  It all started in January of 2003, when I joined Blogger. I had ran many weak websites in the past that had failed miserably, but I was determined.   My first blog was Zach's Geeky World, (you can still see its remains at geekyzach.blogspot.com,I got rid of the fancy template,) it was popular among my classmates, but didnt fly as well as expected. In March of 2003 ZGW arrived at death's door when the school's webmaster blocked all access to web sites made by free hosting programs, my site was killed. On March 28, I shut down the site for good.  After that, on May 1, 2003 I started the website that you see today. I first started it as a relaxation place for internet surfers called "Zach's Web Resort". I realized that this format would never get any hits, so I moved to a tech oriented field, I would never make a better decision.   I renamed the site to "Zach's Techie Hangout", closely based on ZGW. I put mostly personal things on the site, and it was weak, but did well.  I first got into the actual tech news format a little after January 24th. It was then that Zach's Techie Hangout went uphill.  Shortly after I switched the name to "The Main Server". Traffic has been good, and I have plugged the site on Leoville Town Square, Leo Laporte's personal message boards.  The future is bright, and I invite you to join us in it.

      Sorry about all of the abrupt template changes. I'm trying to make everything look good. The neat blue template made unvisited links be invisible because they are blue as well. And the fancy blue and white one was just ugly the more I looked at it. This looks good though.  A went to lunch and when I came back all of the loud kids were gone.  I am going to make a personal blog very soon. Stay tuned for that.

      It's a dreary, rainy day here in Lake Dallas. There's some sort of kid's day over at the childrens section. I've never seen so many such unruly children in my life. And answering a small child's question, small in spanish is pequeno, (the n has a tilde). There's cookie crumbs on the floor and children whining about her shoes keep falling off.   This library has an impressive video collection, but their DVD collection has much to be desired.  My audio posts are much better quality than I expected, I will be posting those for a long time to come.  Jace hasn't posted in a while, I wonder what he's thinking of next? I'll be putting up a poll soon about what information you want us to post.   All of those kids are over there painting, drawing, drooling, screaming, please make it stop!

      ATTENTION ALL LYNKSYS OWNERS! There is a new patch for Linksys WRTS54G 802.11g wireless router. This has been released bue to a flaw that allows hackers to go into your actual configuration page, caos ensues.  Apple's UK version of the iTunes music store is making it's debut next week.  Nike is putting blogs to work for their advertising. Their new blog will contain short films related to speed and the blog will be called  Art of Speed . Just a big adverising ploy.  This is a super slow tech news day, I will most likely be at the Lake Cities Library tomorrow so stay tuned for that.

      I have once again given TMS a new, fresh look. This one looks a lot more "tech" oriented. Big storms have went through just now. Our friends at Coserv energy have restored the power. I should be getting the "I want my TechTV" banner, and other things back up in the next few hours. Enjoy the new look.

      Eddy Hartenstein, vice chairman of DirecTV, stepped down from his position in the Tivo board of directors. He has been reported wanting to spend more time at DirecTV after the satellite giant was purchased by News Corp.  Whoo hoo! Apple is opening a new store in Austin, Texas on June 12. It will be located at the Barton Creek Square Mall.  Apple is also planning to open a new store in Santa Rosa, California.  New evidence in the Kobe Bryant case could include text messages sent by the accuser to her previous boyfriend and other friends. Bad news for Kobe. Or is it?

      Microsoft has nabbed a patent for the double-click feature on PDA's. How much farther will they go?  Toshiba is releasing a 60 GB version of the super tiny hard drive that is used inside Apple's iPod this fall. Apple's largest iPod as of now is 40GB.  Akio Morita, the founder of Sony, has a biography that states he was the man who created the Walkman, Sony's flagship portable music player. This has been proven after over 20 years in court.  Good news for low-power radio stations. Senators John McCain and Patrick Leahy have proposed a bill that would allow low-power FM radio stations to broadcast legally by issuing licenses. Awesome move.  Chris Pirillo still lives! Discover him  urlLink here .

      A new WIndows virus, Korgo, is known to steal credit card information and computer passwords. This isn't good for consumer confidence.  A study reports that the more hi-tech gadgets you use, like laptops, PDA's, and mobile phones, increase your stress in the workplace.  Sony's music download service in conjunction with McDonalds will give away free music downloads with every Big Mac combo sold.   Dell is expanding their printer operations to Asia. Asians don't want Dell's crap. I hope they crash and burn.  Also not good for customer confidence, Microsoft let go of 177 employees in Ohio. They are also going to close their facility in Findlay, Ohio.  Some very good news, Google has added Safari support to their new Gmail service, still in it's beta phase. Now Apple users can use their Gmail in peace.

      This is the fourth time I've been to the library today to use the computer. Am I wearing out my welcome? I surely hope not. I think I should volunteer here.

      I am going to vent about this whole debate that Gmail is against anti-privacy laws. Google is trying to do a good thing by giving Gmail users a whopping 1GB in storage for no charge whatsoever. The only reason they want to scan your e-mail is to put ads related to the mail you're reading in order to pay for this outstanding service. I, personally, do not care if they scan my e-mail, because I will do almost anything in order to get a free e-mail service worth using. California needs to calm down and accept that in order to do business, you have to  do  business. Thank you for your time.

      It's comin to us, a big storm headed straight to the pathetic little town of Valley View. I hope you'll be able to see Thursday's report.  Sony gave up on its Cli&eacute; line of PDA's. Lagging PDA update markets and the growing popularity of cell phone/PDA "smart phones" are focing the tech giant to step out of the PDA business.  USELESS FACT: When it comes to cell phones, men download games while women download ringtones. Interesting, don't you think?  More than 500,000 songs have been downloaded legally in the UK. The british appreciate music so much more than we do.  Seagate, a leading manufacturer of Hard Drives, MoBo's, and the like, has dropped their prices. So head to the store, kids! Get you some little goodies.

      I looked at MSN's new news site, Newsbot, today. Two words: IT SUCKS. Oh well, my home page is still, and always will be, Google News.  The GOP is giving media privleges to around 10 to 20 bloggers during the Republican National Convention. I wish I could get a pass, I would bring in a dozen of eggs to throw on Donald Rumsfeld's face.  The new fourth generation iPods have been getting rave reviews, except for a small flaw in the headphone jacks on some of the new iPods which results in slightly lower audio quality.  Struggling computer manufacturer Gateway has a new CEO to spark their image. All Gateway retail stores have been closed around the nation, and they have set-up a deal with Best Buy to sell their PC's. Gateway has also just recently acquired eMachines, an economy computer manufacturer, also struggling.

      Apple has made a deal with Motorola for the iTunes Music Store to become available an all Motorola cell phones. You can also import songs form your computer into your phone. I remember when my Grandpa had a old flip Motorola phone with a one-line display.  If you want shares of the soon-to-be-public Google, you'll have to shell out major bucks. The range of price for the highly anticipated IPO is from $108 to $135 per share.   Microsoft, in their lame attemt to compete with Google, has released a site to compete with Google News. The new site will start testing today and is called "Newsbot". It's basically a web-based news aggregator like Google News, except with Microsoft's name scrrbbled on it.

      Ladies and gentlemen, I am glad to announce that the Lyoko Network will still be owned and managed by the original owner.&nbsp; Why am I glad?&nbsp; Because I didn't lose a dear friend of mine.&nbsp; However, the main site is to be dismantled and made a forums only.&nbsp; However, after some discussion, we decided to merge our anime sites.&nbsp; We do not yet have a name, basic setup, or website address, so please, bear with us.&nbsp; The programming will&nbsp;be none other than phpBB.&nbsp; Also, we are working on better customization for the site.&nbsp; I'll tell you more when we release the site.&nbsp; We are doing all that we can, but the Lyoko Network changes must be made first.&nbsp; So, remember to check back often for news on our site.  Let's talk games.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there still is nothing outstanding in the gaming world.&nbsp; As I've said before, things have really cooled down since E3.&nbsp; If I do find anything, I will notify you as soon as I get the chance.&nbsp; However, here's a tip for online gaming:&nbsp; Don't do it unless you are using a computer.&nbsp; Online gaming platforms, such as Gamecube, X-Box, and Playstation 2 (actually, they are the only online gaming platforms&nbsp;as such) are easier to, and yes it can happen, hack.&nbsp; Hackers can access your memory cards and games via a connected online game.&nbsp; They can totally mess up your system or your memory card.&nbsp; The only safe online gaming is on a computer, and preferrably with some anti-virus and/or firewall software installed.&nbsp; Unless of course, some one comes out with similar protection later.  Want some earn some cash without even leaving your computer?&nbsp; Go to the  urlLink Nintendo Street Team &nbsp;website and learn how to become an Honorary Street Teamer and get $5,000 dollars in cash!&nbsp; What do you have to do?&nbsp; Simply go to the site every week, look over each team's photo albums of the event, cast your vote on which team you think did the best (and don't be prejudice and only vote for your local team), and come back the next week!&nbsp; Not only that, but there is a calendar with a list of events with times and places so you can visit one near you!&nbsp; Check out the wheels they travel in, play a few games, check out their sweet swag, and meet the team!  As for the anime world, your cable or satellite provider most likely will not offer it, unless your current provider can use the forward and rewind functions, such as Tivo.&nbsp; What a bummer.&nbsp; Either way, if you can watch it, you ought to get it.&nbsp; 24/7 anime...can life get any better?

      Stanford University is studying how to fold protiens in cells in order to cure diseases faster. Only one thing is holding them in the way, computer power. You and me can help SU by downloading a  urlLink small program  that runs in the background, (not spyware), that uses the idle proccessing cycles on your computer to work on files that SU sends to your computer on protien folding. Your computer is teamed up with thousands of others to make one big supercomputer for SU's research! If you want to join Leoville's computing team, our team number is 35054, or you can help individually.

      As Zach has already mentioned to you all, the current owner of the Lyoko Network is considering making me owner of the site.&nbsp; He still has not decided, considering I and one other person are valid candidates for the promotion, but I'm preparing in advance.&nbsp; I will also continue to search for space for my other forums, however, my time will be consumed with managing both.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to clarify a bit on the details of the transfer:&nbsp;  One-I am in no way ensured an administrator position.   Two-If I do attain an adminstrator position through the other candidate, I will have to clear all policy changes and additions through her.&nbsp;   Three-If I do attain administrator position with full site access, then I will require&nbsp;a temporary, but quite possibly permanent, a volunteer web coder/master (Sorry, but I'm a little low on cash at the moment.).&nbsp;   Four-Sending messages to me will require a stricter abidement when composing in sending (Again, I apologize, but I'm one of those people who get's frustrated and explodes if I get overwhelmed from being unorganized.).   Five-My time will be very limited to each site I manage, including this one.&nbsp; I will do my best to keep you all up to date with the anime/gaming world.&nbsp; Any volunteer help will be appreciated (Perhaps once I get some more cash, I can begin paying people that help, but at this point it doesn't look likely.).   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, let's get back to what I'm here for.&nbsp; Sorry guys, but nothing outstanding in the gaming world.&nbsp; As for the anime world, check this out:        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A new television station is coming soon to Cable & Satellite!

      I have just recived the honor of being a moderator of Jace's Code: Lyoko forum. Even though I have never seen half of an episode, I will try to squeeze in a episode or two.   Here's the story. The owner of the forun Jace was working at is soon to give all operational powers and ownership to Jace, and he has to get things in gear, and quick! He has to get a coding book, get editing permissions, and assume command. I just love it when stuff happens.

      Microsoft is looking for potential buyers for their magazine company, Slate. Five to six companies are vying to buy the struggling magazine company, and MSN's spokesman says that they are only in the beginning stages of selling Slate. If the deals do not go through, Microsoft states that they will not stop production of Slate.  In the next twelve months, Microsoft expects to hire 7,000 workers. Get those resumes to Redmond, people!  Google may soon have a new competitor on their tail. A new start-up company, Blinkx, has released a program that searches for information on the internet or your PC related to what files you are viewing on your computer at the time. If available, I will get a copy of Blinkx and give you a review on a later post.  Please excuse the new look. We have been experiencing problems with our old template so we repalced it as quickly as possible.

      I'm my personal news, I now have a wonderful 3-month-old Chocolate Lab simply named "Buddy". He's due for his Rabies vaccine tomorrow so I may be taking a trip to Dr. Stucky tomorrow. Yesterday afternoon  urlLink our phone company  ran into a few problems with our phone and our phones were dead all of yesterday afternoon and this morning, but all is well now and the news shall go on.  Call for Help 2.0 with Leo Laporte in Toronto will start taping August 3-6. The new CFH will only be broadcast on G4TechTV Canada.  From Leoville:  The Chicago Tribune, which hasn't missed an issue since the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, crashed yesterday. A software glitch left 40% of subscribers newspaperless. The rest got truncated editions with weird page numbering and washed out colors. The publisher says it will cost "under $1 million" to fix the problem.    Electronic Arts, (EA), has reported huge success of their series of Harry Potter games. EA says profits have increased 32% compared to the same time last year. EA just keeps belting 'em out, don't they?  Gateway continues to srivel ike a prune after they posted a loss of $339 million. The sruggling computer manufacturer has reported that they are approaching better time since their deal with Best Buy.  Sony will release a 7.2 megapixel consumer digital camera that is an inch thick and is poket-sized. The Cybershot DSC-150 will be released this September.

        Video Games Info?&nbsp; Got it the hard way.     &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, it's good to be back.&nbsp; I realize that I lacked posting as a Video gaming correspondant, mainly because of the lack of released info since E3, but after many months of digging, I finally found a little more detail for upcoming games.     &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let's start with a recap on the Nintendo DS (and note that I don't fathom about Nintendo, they just seem to be the most popular):&nbsp; Dual Screens, both backlit, pushing 2-D and 3-D graphics that will actually  exceed  the quality of N-64 (most of which will operate with a 3-D person view and a 2-D map view); Touch Control which can be demonstrated on WarioWare, Inc. DS and Bandai's Mobile Suit Gundam Seed.&nbsp; WarioWare, you can use the stylus to play games that require you to rub on the screen until a picture appears underneath the streaks.&nbsp; Gundam Seed, you can use the stylus for targeting operations and jabbing enemies.&nbsp; This won't do away with buttons, but will allow a new connection with you and the game; Worldwide wireless connections:&nbsp; Just as a starter, you can connect with up to 16 people in a 30 ft range,  but, &nbsp;it will also be WiFi compatible so that you can go to&nbsp;a Hub, such as a cyber cafe, and connect with people across the nation, or even globe!&nbsp; Nintendo has dubbed it their "Third Pillar" because of the amazing new softwares that they were never able to create before. Prices have also been determined.&nbsp; As a pre-order, the Nintendo DS ranges anywhere from 189.98 to 209.98.     &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now let's move on to the games.&nbsp; Metroid fans have been drooling over Metroid Prime 2: Echoes.&nbsp; Well, here's some more details: Guess what?&nbsp; If you liked fighting yourself in Metroid Fusion, here we go again.&nbsp; Samus will be traveling between two world now:&nbsp; The Light World of the Luminoth, and The Dark Wold of the Ing.&nbsp; Because of this, you will have two new beam weapons, each aiding you for each environment:&nbsp; The Light and Dark Beams.&nbsp; As you can guess, enemies in the Dark World tend to be damaged more by the Light Beam or grow from the Dark beam, and vice versa.&nbsp; Dark Samus will be an exceptional challenge, especially since it will be the first real  boss  that will not be bigger than you.&nbsp; Oh, and a Metroid first?&nbsp; 4 person multiplayer!&nbsp; More?&nbsp; How about the new Hacker upgrade for it?&nbsp; It allows you to, as Nintendo put it, "upload a virus to competitors" that will disable their suits, shut off their beams or limit them to Morph Ball form.&nbsp; Truly amazing.&nbsp; Oh, and for those of you who feel your GBA is too dear to you (or you just can't afford the DS), wireless attachtments will be available for GBA September 7th.&nbsp; Nintendo and Bandai have announced the development of wireless GBA games.&nbsp; As to whether or not DS wireless connections will be compatible with GBA, I have no information, but it more than likely will be as long as both systems have the same Pak.&nbsp; Also, Yu-Gi-Oh! and Dragonball GT has been announced for GBA Videos!&nbsp; Wireless Messenger will be made for the GBA also!&nbsp; Again, I'm not sure whether or not it will be compatible with a DS connection, but it most likely will.     &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are some of the upcoming titles: Mario Kart DS, Animal Crossing DS, Pac-Pix, Pac 'N Roll, a Sonic DS (Title not yet made), Yu-Gi-Oh!: Nightmare Troubadour, Bomberman, Egg Monster Heroes, Mobile Suit Gundam Seed, Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, Resident Evil 4, Star Fox, Geist, Paper Mario 2, Donkey Konga, Pikmin 2, Advance Wars: Under Fire, Donkey Kong Jungle Beat, Odama, Viewtiful Joe 2, Prince of Persia 2, Def Jam: Fight for NY, Need for Speed: Underground 2, Tony Hawk's Underground 2: World Destruction Tour, King Arthur, Catwoman, The Lord of the Rings:&nbsp;The Third Age (GCN), Second Sight, Timesplitters:&nbsp;Future Perfect, Starcraft: Ghost, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon 2, Call of Duty: Finest Hour, Tak 2: The Staff of Dreams, Amazing Island, Dead Rush, Goldeneye: Rogue Agent, The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap, Pokemon Firered and Leafgreen, F-Zero:&nbsp;GP Legend, Mario Pinball, Donkey Kong Country 2, DK: King of Swing, Kirby & The Amazing Mirror, Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, Nicktoons, Cartoon Network Block Party, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Gundam Seed:&nbsp;Battle Assault, Astro Boy: Omega Factor, Megaman Zero 3, Racing Gears Advance, Madden NFL 2005, Banjo Pilot, The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age (GBA), Boktai 2: Solar Boy Django, and Tron 2.0.&nbsp; So, as you can see, the industry will be hard at work this year making some awesome games (most of the anyway).     &nbsp;    Expressing my love for Anime?&nbsp; Looks like it's going the hard way.         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I'm working on Installation 2 of my series, for those who have read the first one (again, the address is  urlLink http://codelyokostories.cjb.net  under Code: Lyoko-Chaos Factor) and have made it to Chapter 4.&nbsp; I still am not sure how long it will be exactly, but it will at least have 6 Chapters.&nbsp; Questions, comments, custom character submissions, or suggestions?&nbsp; Please send me an  urlLink email  or register at the  urlLink Lyoko Network  forums and send me a Personal Message (PM).     &nbsp;

      As you can see, Jace Walker is back on TMS and will be our Video Gaming and Anime correspondent.  Apple has released a new, lower cost iPod. The new 20 and 40 GB models are $100 less than the previous generation.  In the second quarter, eBay's international revenue rose 76%. I just sold a Harry Potter book to a lady in Carlsbad, California.  Microsoft is paying a huge dividend of 32 billion dollars split among all shareholders. I wish I had a few hundred shares.  Dell's recalled power adapter has been redone and is now being sold for your power needs.

      You will NOT believe this.&nbsp;Today on our local classic rock radio station  urlLink 92.5 KZPS , the normal morning DJ's were on vacation. Bo Roberts and Jim White were somewhere enjoying their vacation whole-heartedly while Mondo Mike, a lousy filler DJ, kept the seats warm. Mondo Mike was doing quite well and in his third hour of a five hour slot. He would soon make a mistake that would ruin his career forever.   NOTE: This is completely and solemnly true. I heard this just this morning&nbsp;my way to Lake Dallas. Back to the&nbsp;story.  When the commercial break came along, poor Mondo Mike forgot to turn off his microphone, and started talking to the traffic guy sitting next to him. During a commercial for GMC, Mondo Mike yelled the f-word three times in a row so loud that you could hear him over the loud background music on the GMC Sierra commercial. They kept talking as if nothing happened, and we kept hearing them in the background of the commercials for a good two minutes. All of a sudden the jabbering stopped, and the commercials continued. Then, the station returned with a song, then to reruns of Bo and Jim's best moments.  Mondo Mike has most likely lost his career at KZPS, and his FCC license revoked. He'll never return to this town again.

      I apologize for not posting in a while. I have just bought  The Sims Deluxe Edition  and I can''t stop playing it. I'm at the library once again and the kids reading session is about to begin on the other end of the room. &nbsp; My former contributor and good friend, Jace Walker, has  urlLink written a novel  based on the hit French anime series, Code: Lyoko.&nbsp;On the home page,&nbsp;it's the first installation of Code: Lyoko - Chaos Factor. Jace is also constructing a forum on Code: Lyoko, so when that premieres you'll be some of the first to know. Heck, he's getting so successful I think I'll bring him back, if that's okay with my readers. Please comment on this post with your opinion. &nbsp; I also want to thank my readers for being with me this whole summer, making my website a wonderful palce to be. When I was thinking of giving up this site, people came to read and comment. After August 11th, don't expect a whole lot of posts during the weedays, for my first year in high school will be a busy one. Thanks again and keep visiting, because I think we're gonna be here a while...

The one hunderd-millionth customer of Apple's iTunes music store, Kevin Bitten of Kansas, won a Powerbook, an iPod, and 10,000 free songs. Lucky.  Michael Dell is leaving his post as CEO of Dell Inc.

      I sold most of my Nintendo stuff for a grand total of 55 bucks, and I may sell my N64 tomorrow.  American Airlines is testing a new technology that allows passengers to use their cell phones during flights. The president of Qualcomm made the first in-flight cell phone call on a flight from Dallas to west Texas. During the tests, some calls were dropped, but the quality was pretty much average.  Our presidential candidates need to get more tech-savvy. All of the candidate's websites have been said to be lackluster and mediocre. I agree. The Kerry-Edwards site hasn't even put the new Kerry-Edwards campaign posters up yet. I WANT THAT POSTER!  Martha Stewart has been sentenced to five months of federal prison, (Disneyland), followed by five months of being confined to her home, and a $30,000 fine. Message boards are heating up about the sentence, Stewart, on her site  urlLink Marthatalks.com , said:   "The sentencing decision in my case is in. As horrendous as it is, it was not unexpected, and I am not afraid of what the future holds."    XBox Live has surpassed the 1 million subscriber mark. This just means Micrsoft has brainwashed another 1 million people.

      I was just looking on eBay when I searched to see if people were still selling Gmail invites illegally. Well, they were. I saw bids from 90 cents to over 6 dollars, and they act like it's a perfectly legitimate thing to sell on the world's online marketplace. Well let me tell you account selling money hogs something! Selling Gmail accounts that should be a free service on eBay for your own personal profit is the stupidest thing I have ever seen. The invites were not created by the good people at Google to exploit and worst of all, SELL. I think every user of eBay that has sold or is selling a Gmail account should be permanently banned from selling ANYTHING on ebay that is technology related. Better yet, eliminate them from eBay completely!   There are some nasty people on eBay, and I don't want anyone to be taken for a ride on such a beneficial sales network.

      I was here before all the lights were on today. Just shows you how much I love my internet! The kid's reading session is going on in the childrens section. It's a small library so I can see most of the action. This lady brought her  huge  Yellow Lab and her guitar, what fun (snickering).  Cat Schwartz posted on her blog that she has moved to LA but is not working for G4TechTV. She says that she is doing some things on the air but not working full time. In her post, she seems so positive and happy that her old, trustworthy company was purchased by a ruthless cable giant that probably doesn't pay her half as much as she was being paid.  Now they're singing Old MacDonald, a song about a scottish farmer, wow, that's the first time a thought about that.  Yesterday a copy of  My Life  by Bill Clinton was on the bestseller rack, but it has been swiped off the shelf today. Bill, unlike our current president, could read and write, and also eat solid foods.

      Today started as a regular summer weekday. I went to work with my mom, brought by bike, and was going to the local library to use the computers to ease my net addiction. Well, when I got to the library, I pulled out my card and said, as usual, "I would like a computer, please". And to my astonishment, well, more like severe shock, I was notified that the Centurytel, (Lake Dallas' phone and DSL provider), had had a problem with their servers and had to bring them down for the whole weekend. Of course I was infurited, me being an evangelist of DSL availability to the masses, and walked off in a calm manner, but rode away cursing the name of Baton Rouge based Centurytel. Now, at 4:55 in the afternoon, the servers are back up and all is well. If I look on the bright side, I didn't have to hear all of the screaming little kids at the morning book reading.

      Broadband internet through power lines could be closer than you think. An itty bitty company called Intellon, in Ocala, Florida, has created a chip that could make power line pump enough power to make this internet revolution possible. If this passes, anywhere there's power lines, there's high-speed internet.  For the lazy golfer, there's the RoboKaddy. The motorized golf bag carrier is $1,499, and saves your back from the paining of a flimsy manual golf bag carrier. Attachemnts include a seat/storage compartment, an umbrella holder, and a sand-and-seed bottle.  A wi-fi cell phone? Yep, some leading cell phone manufacturers are planning to make cell phones that use regular cellular and 802.11a technology. Interesting...

         Do you like this? Amazon is taking orders for it. It's the Samsung Yepp YH-999 and is a portable media center. That's right, you can view full-length movies on this baby, and by the looks of it, runs on Windows. The Yepp ships in September.    The MPAA says that one in four internet users have downloaded a movie illegally, puleese.  Firefox users have a security update to download, it's easy to get and is at  urlLink Mozilla Update . Mac and Linux users are not in jeopardy, for this is only a Windows flaw.  Matt Hartley has a  urlLink great explaination  of how bad AOL really is. If you have AOL, you NEED to read this.  IBM is releasing an e-mail server that is made for medium-size businesses that demand a e-mail network. Not a bad move. Even the little guy needs joeblow@joeblowrepoagency.net.

      Mozilla Firefox has taken the internet browser market by storm, and I could not be more satisfied with a browser ever.  I was using Mozilla 1.7 almost since it came out, but when Firefox 0.9.1 was released, I jumped on the bandwagon and was very suprised with the huge improvment from 0.8.   Firefox is an extremely light web browser that is the next generation of Mozilla browsers. The interface is clean and sleek and has crisp lines. The transistion from IE, for those who may be considering moving to Firefox after the security slip-ups of Microsoft, is very smooth. If your switching, do not be afraid that everything will be diffrent, all that will be diffrent is the look and the security issues of IE will not be a problem.  So if you're thinking of changing your browser, go with Firefox, it's a best bet.

      New news across the board. Let's get to work!  Michael Moore, creator of popular documentary  Fahrenheit 9/11 , is happy that his movie is being downloaded on illegal file sharing networks. He says that the mre people who see it the better.  The Kerry-Edwards ticket, get used to the name and practice saying President before Kerry, and Vice President before Edwards.  Netflix membership has increased 82% since this time last year, which makes about 2 million people renting DVD's via snail mail.  Microsoft is turning back on itself. Microsoft's internet magazine Slate is recommending Mozilla Firefox instead of IE. How's that for free speech?  Something I thaught Dell would never do, sell Linux PC's. Dell could be selling PC's with Linux in Europe via a reseller. Hmmmm. Plane ticket, anyone?  The iPod mini is expected to go international July, 24.

      What Micosoft should have done 20 years ago they're doing today. Miucrosoft is planning to improve their customer service. They are contacting customers and asking them about what they want in new software, and now have a situation room where they constantly monitor for security threats. At least they're trying.  The iPod could be in trouble. The senate is passing a copyright infringement act that would involve all companies involved with digital content. This could cause entertainment companies to sue makers of mp3 players, DVD recorders, oh , and CD recorders too. The senate is kinda getting carried away.  Another slow tech day.

      Here typin' the news and wachin' I Love the 70's, is this a great Saturday or what?  Microsoft finally came to its senses when it comes to the IE disaster. The makers of the worst web browser ever released a temporary security update yesterday to partly fix the gaping hole in IE. This is almost like patching a nuclear power plant with bubble gum.  To make it worse for Microsoft, Paris City Hall is looking at Linux for it's computer systems. Microsoft, in a attempt to beat Linux, slashed prices to tantalize Paris's taste buds. This a huge reminder of a battle of two car dealerships, and one customer.  Apple's stock went down by $2.28 on Friday due to the delay of the release of the new iMac. Better be careful, Apple.

      Oh, you havent heard about it? Well, how can I announce this without everyone laughing? The granddaddy of all geek television shows is going to the movies in a live-action feature film. International Rescue will never be the same. In the preview, it looked like a huge dissapointment slathered with over-the-top special effects.

      MSN, in their attempt to catch up with Google in the search engine wars, has a simplified their search page and has given it the URL of www.search.msn.com. It still looks too fancy.  An era of Apple is over. Apple has abruptly, but politely, stopped filling orders for their iMac system. But never fear! Apple plans to release a new line of iMacs in September.  Just what I wanted to hear. Gmail has banned users to sell Gmail invites for profit. I don't think  urlLink  Gmail Swap   is owtlawed, but I'll keep you posted.  WINDOWS SP2 UPDATE: The latest service pack from Microsoft is set to release in about two months. Last time I heard, people that had a dial-up connection could get a CD of SP2 for $10.  ATTENTION ALL DELL LAPTOP USERS: Very important! Dell has recalled their Auto/Air Power Adapter for Inspiron and Latitude notebooks, due to the adapter making an electrical shock if it is used with a cord that isn't the cord that was packaged with the adapter from the factory.  Mozilla is feeling its oats today after IE's constant slip-ups of the past few weeks. Downloads of Mozilla have significantly increased in the past week. This is a great day for Microsoft bashers.

      The news train is back on track!  Sony is stepping up to the plate in the fight against Apple iPod. The entertainment giant has announced two new hard drive-based players that will be added to their Walkman line. Conideribly smaller than the iPod, weighing less than four ounces, it's hard drive is huge for the system's size at 20GB. Battery power on the new Sony players surpass the iPod by 22 hours. Apple has some work to do.  The Blackberry, one of the most popular mobile communication devices, is raking in the profits. Between January and March this year, Research in Motion, Blackberry's creator, has made $55 million with their product. Dare to compare that to the loss of $8.2 million in the same span of time last year.  ATTENTION ALL PALMONE TREO USERS: There is a software update for your Treo 600 handhelds now available. The update increases the reliability of your device.

      The city of Lake Dallas has some pretty lazy workers. No, I'm not talking about the Public Works department, they're the hardest working bunch in the county. I'm talking about the city manager, his secretary, and the police department. Heck, the whole freakin' Municipal Complex is screwed up. My mother wanted to know the city sales tax a few weeks ago. Just call the city hall. No problem, right? Ha! She first called the city hall front desk, got an automated prompt, was directed to the city manager, and the dork didn't answer. Lake Dallas isn't a town where everyone is busy all of the time. The city manager was probably playing solitaire with a deck of 51 while he hummed to his phone ringing. In a second attempt to acquire a sales tax quote, my mom called the police at their non-emergency number. Figuring that the police would surely know, the police didn't answer our question, just said that this is the police depatment in a very stupid tone. Then my mom called the city jester, I mean, manager, and left a coarse message, and ended up calling the local hardware store for the sales tax.   Ah, the pleasues of city government.

      I have just discovered a new program acclaimed my  The Screen Savers . It's called  urlLink Sphere XP  and it makes your desktop look like it is a 3-D sphere. It's really hard to explain without looking at the screenshots. Check it out.

The computer will retail for $599 and an additional $299 for a flat-screen monitor. This PC addition accompanies Disney's line of TV's, radios, clocks, and DVD players.

The city of Munich has converted all 14,000 workstations to Linux. Ah, the satisfaction.  Now it's just getting stupid. Microsoft has yet again dleayed the release of the eagerly anticipated Service Pack 2.  Not much more interesting new today, so I guess I will  urlLink link something .

      All right!  I've finally found something worth talking about for gaming.  I know it's not much, but still, hear me out.  Nintendo has finally decided on an official name for the DS.  What will it be?  Why, the DS of course!  Also, they have redesigned the look from it's orignal E3 debut design.  It is now much sleeker and sharper, also having a slot for the stylus now as well as larger buttons and stereo, yes, I said STEREO sound even without headphones!  To check it out yourself, go  urlLink here!

         What is this? I see the G4TechTV logo on the wall, but not on the mic. If a company pays millions of dollars to buy a company, you would think they would want to flaunt it by putting the new logo on their mics.  There's a rumor spreading about that says that G4 will get rid of TechTV from their image and just call it G4. This is stupid. By the looks of it, TechTV has been flushed down the crapper.  The above picture is property of it's owner, G4 Media.

      I lost the auction! I lost the auction to some dweeb that bid 50 cents higher than me. I guess I'll look at the ZDTV cap three pack.

      As of 7:00 tomorrow night, I will be a owner of a Techlive Baseball cap. I have been the lead bidder for a few days on eBay, and I expect to win. If I don't, I've been eyeing a ZDTV cap as well. I'm just trying my best to get one piece of old TechTV memorabilia before it all goes away and is replaced by cheap G4TechTV stuff. I also saw a TechTV promotional packet given to cable and satellite networks to persuade them to carry TTV. I thaught about bidding on that but I decided I would get something I could wear and take everywhere with me. Ah, I can imagine it now.  My first year in high school will start on the 11th, and I may not post as often as I do now. During the school year, please excuse me if I do not post for a day or two in a row during the weekend. I will post every weekend.  When Labor Day weekend comes along, I will be gone to a family reunion . The reunion is in the middle of nowwhere in west Texas and cell coverage may be scant, so don't be suprised if I don't leave an audio post.   I am trying to get two new contributors to  The Main Server , but Blogger has a problem with their invite, which I hope they get fixed in the near future.
