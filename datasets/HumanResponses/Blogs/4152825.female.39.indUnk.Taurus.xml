      i'm an emotional basket case...tonight is the gathering.   he's in l.a. and taking a nap at his hotel.  i can't figure out why this gets to me so much.  the writer probably wont' be there, so it looks like it's the girls and jason and his other buddy.  he promised to call me afterwards.  at least he's listening to me about it and not getting angry.  he said not to make up a fake reality about what's going on, but he understands the fears i have.  he promises that it will all be okay.  i hope so...i guess i just worry that he'll drink too much and not be rational, then get himself in a position that could be misinterpreted.  i know it's irrational of me to think like that.  and the reality is that i do trust him...i don't trust others though.  there will be pictures, and i'm sure they will be up on fark.  so i'll see just what happened.   he said i can ask him anything about the night too...and i really don't think he'll do anything that will upset me, or lie to me again.  it really affected him when i told him how it made me feel like i did when i was with jeff.  and i think he realizes that i won't stick around like i did with jeff.  i'm smarter now and will not live a life of lies ever again...  with that said, i just feel like a wreck....all because of one stupid gathering that will probably turn out to be nothing spectacular but a bunch of drunk losers.  let him get it out of his system...i hope he sleeps through it all....that's mean.  i want him to be happy, but i don't want her to be there.  i told him it's hard because she's with him and i'm not and i should be the one there with him.  that's when he told me not to make this out like it's something that it's not.  i think he'll honor his promise to stay away from her.  i hope he doesn't lie anymore when he's finally here.  it would be devastating to our relationship if he did....

      so i started this blog with a bunch of depressing, relationship centered junk. i guess there is room for that, but things are getting better and the fog is lifting...and now i can see how f***** boring my sadness is. it's definitely time to get things back on track and start new. jason's and my reunion in a few days will be great and will be the beginning of a new chapter in our lives. it really is all very symbolic. i think we go through things at particular times in our lives in order to shed that skin and move on. some people just get stuck, but fortunately jason and i are moving forward. as long as he doesn't continue that behavior, and as long as i am not obsessed with it all that is...  new beginnings...scary. we have moved thousands of miles from where we started. we have gone through more in the 6 years we've been together than most people go through in 40. through it all, we continue to fall in-love all over again. i would count us as some of the lucky ones. sometimes that's difficult to see though....and sometimes i don't want to give up that much of myself. but i think this last episode made me realize that i can't continue to hold back. i need to give my all to this relationship if i expect the same in return. i'm not saying that i hold back my love for him...that's never been a problem. i hold back parts of myself though. i protect myself from hurting too much...from being too disappointed. i still get hurt, and i still am let down...but i never fall completely apart anymore...i used to be a mess when i was sad.  now i know i've built up this protection measure, but it really holds me back from experiencing all that i can as well. i'm not like most people...this i've known for a very long time. i think differently than most...i feel things more intensly i think (just based on how others deal with stuff). what i mean by that last statement is that i believe myself to be an empath. niki thinks so too. i tend to take on the emotions of those around me. sometimes it's quite overwhelming to be in a room full of people because the vibes are just so intense. i also confuse things alot and that makes me feel emotions that i probably wouldn't feel under normal circumstances. when i hurt, i really hurt. when i'm happy, i'm really happy. i wouldn't say i'm manic/depressive though. my emotions don't fluctuate that much. i'm sure there is some wierd chemical imbalance somewhere in me...but i think that spiritually i have some big lessons to learn. i dont' really trust people...why, i don't really know. i've been hurt all through my life, but i still like people...i just dont' trust most of them. anyway, all this leads me back to what i started here, i need to give in and allow myself to open up to my husband....i need to allow myself to feel every aspect of this relationship and to allow him to share in that. i need to be more vocal about my feelings instead of being afraid of them. i want to live life...i want my daughter to see me as someone who isn't always afraid. i want her to be honest and open with her emotions and to trust. i want my husband to know all of me and to enjoy it as much as he does now...i trust that he will love me even more...i will trust him...i will continue to help him learn to be honest...i will continue to strive to be the best i can be and to have the best marriage possible. i will love with everything in me....i will dance and i will sing and i will laugh. i will just be....

      so jason and i finally had a real honest to goodness talk about everything.  he wasn't happy with my email, nor with the fact that i still questioned him.  we discussed how he felt and i told him my fears, etc..  it started out awkward and sad...with alot of frustration.  but it ended very nicely with some understanding.  the next day was better...and the day after that even better.  last night we had a great talk, all night actually for me (5 hours difference is really messing with us).  he was 100% open to discussing the party and who would be there...and who wouldn't, namely her.  i guess his friend said she wasn't going.  so we'll see if she shows up...but i won't make an issue out of it because i know he'll be honest about it.  i am trusting him on this one.  he told me the place he'll be staying - a hotel near the club.  he said he'd call...then he said he wanted me to get on a plane and meet him there.  was really insisting that i go and said he missed me and wanted me to be by his side so we could have fun together that night.  i told him i couldn't leave lola all night just yet.  she still nurses at night.  he was really wanting me to think about it and look into the possibility of it happening.  i won't be going of course, but just the fact that he really wanted me there and i could hear it in his voice, made all the difference in the world.  i don't think i'll be invisible anymore to others in his life...and i don't think he'll keep things from me, and i don't think he'll keep secret friendships or even start friendships like these last.  he eased my mind on so many issues and i feel that he really wants to make another attempt at gaining trust.  i felt like i was falling in-love with him again last night and was really missing him.  10 more days...   lola has been really voicing her objections lately to everything.  she has mastered the word "no" and "don't" and uses them freely.  she's a full blown toddler.  i think jason is going to be shocked when he sees her.   she's so cute and smart and knows how to use her charms already to make things happen.  she is very loving when in the mood too.  but man, if she's pissed at you, then she's pissed for awhile.  she's not happy with me leaving her sight for even a moment, no exaggeration.  it's funny most of the time, but can be frustrating at other times.  i love her so much though and i know it's just her age, so i take a deep breath and smile and kiss on her...hehe  usually helps me feel better and will get even a small smile out of her when she's mad..;)  well...now that i feel better i can move on to other things in my head and work on my writing...  did i mention i was pmsing last week too?  quite the surprise, but makes me understand more why i was so weepy....life goes on...

      so i am having flowers sent to j for his last day at work.  i found a nice tropical arrangement at a local florest in hawaii, so he shouldn't have any problems getting them on time - friday.  he is so anxious to get out of there.  i feel for him...i felt the same way when i was leaving for here.  couldn't wait...now i am thinking i should have stayed longer...considering all the problems we seem to be having now.  i sent him email today.  this is what i said:  "hey...i am really missing you this morning and feeling kind of down. i really need a hug from you - 2 weeks feels like such a long time.  i guess i'm just feeling emotional after everything that has gone on and it's just so hard to deal with without seeing your eyes or feeling your arms around me, reassuring me that it really is all okay and that we won't have to go through this kind of thing again.  it seems whenever we have a problem, you holding me tight always makes it better.  i am emailing all this to you because i can't call you right now and wake you up...and i woke up with it all on my mind and i feel like crying and don't want anyone here to know that i'm sad right now.  it all invaded my dreams last night...so i guess i believe that if i talk to you about it, i will feel better somehow.  i just don't know what to do with all these emotions.  nothing so bad happened that it's the end of the world, but enough happened that i just feel worn out i guess.  and i know it doesn't help that you and i are apart right now.  i just love you so much jason and i don't want to lose you...i feel like i've lost some of my sense of direction and i'm struggling a little to find the path back, you know?  i don't know what to think, where to go or who to talk to.  i feel alone and hurt and sad and all i want is you here telling me it's all okay...i want you to run your fingers along the inside of my elbow and help me fall asleep at night.  i want to feel your kisses and see the truth and love in your eyes. i want to see your face when you say i am a priority, because it always makes me feel better when i see how soft your eyes get and how much you really do love me.   it's just the emotional aftermath that is catching up with me.  i'm sorry.  i don't want there to be an awkwardness...i don't want there to be a wall...i know it's in me and i have to deal with it.  i'm really trying...it's just so difficult at times to push it out of my head.  i am hoping all this will bring us closer, but i'm afraid of being pulled apart too.  i'm a drama queen, i know...it's no wonder our daughter is so dramatic.   i also believe that it isn't fair to either of us for me to keep my emotions bottled up because they are valid, you know?   you always ask me what is going on...and i am telling you now.  i love you jason...you and the kids are my life.  i just want to feel okay again..."  it's a bit depressing and i am now regretting that it was so long.  he commented on it, said he was sorry.  we really didn't have a chance to talk much about it actually.  maybe he'll email me later when he has a chance - although somehow i doubt it.  i think he just wants it to go away.  so how long to i dwell on this?  i'm beginning to bore myself with it all.  i guess i'm afraid of letting it go because i still don't trust that he is 100% honest with me.  what a terrible wife i am.  he's really trying i think...i think...i guess time will tell.  i'm going shopping tomorrow...

      so it begins i guess.  i'm having trouble believing in someone who i should be believing in...and i'm a bit sad about that.  nothing earth-shattering occurred, but enough of a deceipt was present to shake me up.  now i'm trying to build back the trust that was taken out of me.  i miss him...i love him...i can't wait until he is home again in my arms - 2 more weeks!  but i also doubt him because of a friendship that was forged by him with someone else, that while harmless, was kept a secret from me - his wife.  he is 98% innocent of any wrongdoing...but that 2% deceipt is 2% that was taken away...and i can't seem to stop thinking about it.  plus there is the party coming up...and she'll be there with him, while i'm here with our baby girl.  we are in the middle of moving several thousands of miles from home and i'm where we are settling while he is finishing up some loose ends.  it all started with some pictures from a different gal...and to make matters worse, the pictures were accompanied by several email exchanges between my darling husband and the whorish looking woman flashing her entire body to him.  she said she felt chubby...he told her she was beautiful...then he told me he said it all out of pity for her.  what?!  i didn't believe any of that, but i let him talk and use it as an excuse.  the intimacy of it all just cut me.  the anger in his voice over my finding out and his defense of her - she lost a child, no a mother, no is feeling fat, no is just an attention whore.  he tried to make her feel better, but was making me feel worse.  i didn't feel like i came first, and she was just some freakin stranger trying to cause trouble.  i let him listen to me cry on the phone, not because i was trying to be manipulative, but because i couldn't stop crying.  he felt really badly about it and we started moving forward.  and it wasn't mentioned again.   then the new one came along, or rather had been there for awhile unbeknownst to me.  nothing harmful in these exchanges, but they were almost daily...and for several weeks/months...and were not mentioned to me while all the other male correspondences were told to me in great length.  i didn't get mad this time...i just hurt.  which brings me to the party.  several of these internet aquaintances are apparently getting together for drinks while my love is in that part of the country on his way to me here.  it was originally just one guy and him...then all of a sudden it was a party.  when the new "friendship" came out, he told me about the party and told me she'd be going, but that he'd just found out that day so he had decided he wouldn't go.  i knew that was a lie, i know he invited her himself...it wasn't a surprise for him.  and i know he won't back out of it now, even though we've been dealing with all this yuck!  he did tell her that he couldn't talk to her in im's anymore...i emailed her as well, thanking her for understanding.  she wrote back a very nice email and i appreciate it alot.  he said he wanted me to know that she meant nothing to him and that he would do anything to make our marriage the best it could be.  i thanked him and told him that i too had emailed her and that i hope this situation didn't have to come up again and we could just move forward and be happy again.   i still am not comfortable though with it all...and i realize why, because he lied...and kept lying.  what was he trying to hide?  he told me he was afraid it would be wierd for me...hmmm...but he kept it going none-the-less...hmmm  now i'm stuck with all these emotions about it all, knowing full well that there was absolutely nothing going on, but am still struggling.  he thinks it's over, at least until the party comes up next week.  my confusion is because of many reasons.  it's because of the pics gal...it's because of my first husband and all his secrets (which is one of the reasons he was my "first" husband)...it's because i feel betrayed, even in a small way, and i didn't see it coming...it's because i love him so much and i KNOW he loves me just as much - but he still hurt me...it's because he's so far away and i can't see his eyes telling me the truth...it's because i know he changed his email account, but says he's letting it die so i'm not sure what to believe...it's because i've been reduced to feeling like a snoop, even though he's given me full access to his other email account...it's because i don't want him going to the party, and i know he's going and i know she'll be there....it's because i've seen his comments online about other naked women....it's because i'm scared of losing him...it's because my heart has been broken over and over and i'm afraid that one of these days it won't repair itself...it's because i've been left before and i've left before...it's because i'm insecure, sad and lonely right now....it's because i can't seem to lose the baby weight and i feel like an unattractive cow next to these other women...it's because i'm tired...it's because some days i feel unworthy of a lasting relationship...it's because i want so badly to talk to him about it and to really understand, but am afraid to open the wound back up verbally...it's because he's not here with me, but will be there with her - even if it's just having a beer together.   i'm hoping that this will help me sort some of this out.  i'm hoping that as soon as he's here, it will all go away.  and i'm hoping either he doesn't go to the party, or she doesn't go.  more to follow, hopefully not as depressing....
