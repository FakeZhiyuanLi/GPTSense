      I'm gonna be honest here. The song performances weren't good. Reason?  1) The vocalist was soft.  2) The band was too loud. 3) The vocalist should have expressions.  4) The vocalist wasn't singing the right tune. 5) The vocalist was a bit pitchy. Next, the fashion show. It was good. Two thumbs-up. But the only problem has to do with some of the revealing clothes. There was a costume that looks liek it will fall anytime. There was one which shows 50% of the body flesh. Okay, I'm being a little bit conservative here. But it's a school.   ~ The dance performance was good. I liked it. But I have a thought. Christina can dance, Chou Yee can dance too, but Kim Vee's partner wasn't flexible enough. What else? The drama by the 4Sc1 was cancelled because the storyline of their sketch was Mr. Pong being accused of murdering Mr. Ah Lim. Their name sounds fmailiar huh? Next up is the food. It was good. The salad was delicious. The fried chicken was okay. But they didn't give us a spoon for the fried rice. I love the drink. Nestea rite? Or whatever it is.   The Prom King and Queen were so predictable. Everyone was placing their bets on Aaron and Pei Lu since the beginning. Aaron was brave enough to say that the thing that inspires him most in SSG is the girl of his dreams that is Chai Sin Cher who was there too. She was shocked, you can look at her face at that time. Astonished, yet happy. Julia was the runner-up for the Prom Queen. Well done Julia. Go for the Prom Queen title this year for the Form Five Prom Night. You can do it!  ~ Overall, well done to the Form Fours. They had put a lot fo effort and sacrificed their energy and time to make the event a success. Here are some of the pictures from the show. Captions are included.    Who is that? Kelly  lar ... looks like...     Kah Ming showing his talent. It's a nice pic, don't you think so?     Lie Peh with her own rendition of Colours of The Wind!     Kheng Loon and Christina...     Doctor and nurse, they must be havign some affairs!     Whoa! D.I.Y. isn't bad after all!     One of the best costumes.     What a lovely couple!     Heard that they spent a lot on the wedding gowns. Its worth it anyway!     You're in. You're the ultimate! It's automatic...      Yes... this is better. The Reason!     The Prom King accompanying the Prom Queen!!!

      I don't know why it had been down since Saturday morning. It was pissing me off. Can you imagine life without internet for 3 days? Living hell. But at least it's over now. Thank to those who had made this happen. Thank you Lord.

      It wasn't a bad last day of school for the first term. The trip to Melaka starts today. How nice to those who are following the trip. It has been 9 months since I last been to a trip organised by the school. Here are some of the pictures showing the Form Ones, Twos and Threes busy chatting with friends while waiting for the buses to arrive.            ~ Went back home by taxi today. for the first time in my life, the taxi-driver's a lady. She was friendly and considerate. After getting into the car, she asked me which radio station I would like to listen too. She said that she has Hitz, Mix and others. Cool.   The second half of the day should be cool as I'm attending the Prom Night.  Lolz..  I'll report on that later. Hopefully something stupid will happen.

      Finally, the new American Idol is crowned. Fantasia Barrino, the 19 year old single mother who proved to us that she can sing absolutely anything has finally won the reality tv show. I can't wait until she releases her first album or single(I Believe).  Moments of American Idol 3...     Though they're competing each other, friendship grows at the same time.      Diana giving a hug to Fantasia right after the announcement of the winner.      The ending of the American Idol 3 Finale with Fantasia, Latoya, Jasmine, Jon.

      Many of my clasmates weren't here. 95% of them  ponteng , as usual.But their reason for playing truancy was to finish their moral project which should be handed up this friday! As the attendance of students wasn't good, many of the teachers didn't teach today. For the first time, we find it boring for not having any proper classes conducted. The only subject that I have to study was Additional Maths. The results for that paper pulled down my average results a lot. I only managed to score 58 marks for the whole paper. But spotting my mistakes in the paper gave me a lot of inspiration to improve my careless mistakes and to study harder for that subject next time.   ~ Overall, I think I did badly for the exams this time. Maybe it was due to my participation in extra curriculur activities. But I just shouldn't put all the blame on it. My time management was lousy this time. Still, I managed to struggle through the whole process of examination. 2 more trials then the real SPM is in the store for me. It will be very pressuring. Live will be a living hell by that time.   Prom Night is just 2 nights away. I have a feeling that it will be a successful event, hopefully. It is until 10.30, as I said, a little bit too late for me. Inez and gang will be performing. Let's cheer for them. I think their act will be one of the most entertaining performances of the night, next to the live band by Kheng Loon and gang. Hm... I still haven't figure out what clothes shall I wear to the event. Colours of harmony... what a theme!   ~ The Day After Tomorrow opens tomorrow in all the cinemas. I want to watch that bloody movie! It is one of the most anticipated movie of 2004! But, I'm really scared of the effect of the movie in my life. I might really think that one day, the world will end like that eventually. But hopefully, that only happens after I actually die.  Haha.  Harry Potter 3 will be coming out too. The movie reminds me of the book that I have not finish. Lolz. Momo will be scolding me for that. Can you imagine that I fell asleep after reading a few pages of that book?!   The new American Idol will be crowned tomorrow! I can hardly wait with patience anymore. Of course, I'm on Fantasia Barrino's side. But if Diana wins, I will still be glad as she has the talent, and the voice. Fantasia will still be a star in my heart, and she will still get a record label and release her own album. She reminds of Macy Gray that I used to like when I was in Form One...     Everyone's a winner in American Idol. Best of luck to Fantasia and Diana!

      Today is one of the best day I've ever had so far in May 2004. Although the day started off badly when I was sleepy in the bus, it moved on with surprises.  ~ Many of the teachers were involved with the meeting today. It was important I guess because they actually missed their classes for it. And from there, the prefects come in, taking the place of the teachers temporarily. Luckily, Mr. Wong gave me a chance and I was sent to 1D. It wasn't bad overall after comparing that class with 1G. Got to know a few more Form One students again. Hm... let me think... Faiz, Tengku something Zainal, and 7 more students whom I didn't ask for their name. Chee Yeong was in that class for a while, then he went out to  kau lui  I think.   The class was damn noisy. The students are very playful, giving me a hard time controlling them. Tengku was a bit hyper. He's just like Julia. Halfway through, Michelle asked me to look after her class as well. Her class was totally different from 1D. Not just the name, the students in 1E look more 'hardworking' then the students in 1D. Some of them were drawing, 1 was studying, and 3 prefects were looking after the class. Sigh, looks like the senior prefects are useless... hm... As in 1D, all they did was chatting and playing a fool on me. It was a great experience afterall. I would love to have a chance to do that again one day but the odds of that happening again is very very low.  ~ Using my fingers, I can actually count the days left to holidays. 3 more days! And at the same time, I will only have to do my prefect duty for 3 more days. It's kinda sad to me to step down after the holidays. I find it fun to become a prefect especially when your duty place is in the 4th floor or the staircase in the canteen. Looking back, I had been a prefect for 8-9 months. Sigh... good times end fast!  Today my family and I went to Oishi in Mid Valley City to celebrate my future brother-in-law's 31st birthday. The food there was quite okay. I liked the tempura and dessert. Going to Mid Valley is giving me a headache. I was there last Thursday, Saturday and today!  Haha...  went to bread talk and bread story to stock up the bread in my house. And this time around, my mom made the payment. How nice of her for doing so...   ~ Finally, my mom knows that I'm joining Malaysian Idol. Even my sister just only knew about it today. She was like so shocked. She had always thought that I'm a coward and I will easily freak out. Yes, she's right. I don't really know how am I going to face all the pressure and the 3 judges. I'm not good at communicating with strangers. Shit!  It's getting late. In fact, it's already too late. I have to sleep... ZzZZzzzzZ!

      Avril's "Under My Skin" and The Calling's "II" are releases today! I can't wait to add those cds into my collection!  ~ For the first time, people respect me as a prefect. Some I guess. Being appointed to guard the 3rd staircase in the canteen turns out to be an interesting duty. Unfortunately, I think I pissed one student off today. How sorry am I... but they were still polite. Looks like the discipline of the students in SSG did improve this year.  I noticed that people hardly listen to me. Maybe I just interrupt their conversations quite often. Or maybe my voice is jsut too soft? But still, that is fine to me as I get that a lot. I'm used to it.   ~ Form One students are friendly. I've been to 1E and they were so cooperative as they helped me with my survey. Got to know a few students in Form One through my house and the prefectorial board. Sometimes, I just feel that it is more comfortable to hang out with them. I'm just childish I guess.  Talent Night has been renamed to Prom Night. Yes, PROM NIGHT. I wonder why they call it a Prom Night. Heard that there'll be dances, songs, games, lucky draw and prom king & queen contest. The theme is Colours of Harmony I think and we have to dress according to the theme. So, does that mean that we have to wear something colourful or harmonious. By the way, it is happening in the SSG school hall this Friday from 7.00p.m. to 10.30p.m. It's a bit too late...

      School holiday is coming. I haven't plan my holidayz yet. I bet it will be the same routine again. Eat, sleep, watch tv, play ps2, go online... Things had not change for me.   ~ Went to Sungei Wang today to collect pictures and to pass the digicam to Shook Yee. It was very crowded in front of the entrance of Sungei Wang. The crowd was made up mostly by girls who are desperate to see Toro. Met Hui Yee in the Hang Tuah Star LRT Station. She was there to see Toro too. Then, I went to my mom's shop. There, I met Christopher. Phew! Everytime I go to town, I will meet someone. I wonder why...   Hm... 17 days more until my Malaysian Idol pre-audition. Finally, I have narrowed down the songs I plan to sing:  1) Nobody Knows It But Me by Derek McDonald 2) This I Swear by Nick Lachey 3) If I Let You Go by Westlife 4) My Love by Westlife 5) Stigmatized by The Calling 6) The Way by Clay Aiken 7) Drift Away by Uncle Kracker 8) I Do by 98 Degrees 9) One More Try by A1 10) Belaian Jiwa  11) For You by 5566 12) Boyfriend by 5566  I guess that's all. Feel free to leave some advice for me. I really don't know what to sing. My mind is still not focused.

      Went to Mid Valley Mega Mall today. Finally, I watched Van Helsing. The movie wasn't that bad at all. Some said that it was kiddy, but what can one expect from a fantasy show? Kate Beckinsale is cool. I can never imagine her doing something else other than killing and fighting. But there were some scenes which didn't make it through our Malaysia censorboard. So, it affected the movie a lil' bit. Before the movie started, they showed the trailer for The Day After Tomorrow again. It opens on the 27th of May. I can hardly wait any longer. I expect it to be one of the movies of 2004!  ~ I saw Sze Ye today in Mid Valley. Suddenly met her around MPH and she told me something. She brought her friend along. Can't remember the friend's name.  Wah...  reached home at 10.15 today. I broke my own record. I think my record last time was 9 something only. But I just realise that 9 out of 10 times I go out with Jerry and gang, we'll eat Japanese food all the time...

      Jon was tired! Jennifer was down(again)! Looks like everyone is giving up their lives these days... it's bad. Life's precious. Why waste it like that? Having negative thoughts, corrupting your mind.  ~ Things are getting complicated to me nowadays too. Results are proving that I didn't give it my best this time around. The burden of finishing the Interact Annual Report is giving me a lot of stress. Luckily, the deadline for the submission is postponed to 15th of June. Hopefully, we can compete with other schools in at least 1 of the awards.  Sau Mei and Rachael and I went to Montaine Fitness and Health Centre in Menara Weld today. The people there are so friendly except for maybe 1  le...  All three of us tried the foot reflexology. It was painful for me. I tried the body relaxation massage too. It was quite relaxing... Rachael is even planning to go for a work-out session this Friday....  ~ Just got back my english paper results. I scored the same marks with Kelly and May Yenn. How nice. Amber as usual got the highest in my class with 91 marks. Congrats!  "What we anticipate seldom occurs: but what we least expect generally happens" - Benjamin Disraeli

      It was entertaining enough to me. All the teachers teamed up at the opening to sing a few songs. The Blacks and The Whites (Inez, Kelly, Kevin+Julia, Rachael, Sammi, Eric) sang a medley of I'll Be There (Jackson Five) and  Jeng Tian  (Jay Chou). Ms. Khoo collaborated with the new teacher singing Dilemma 2003.  A group of Form 1 and Form 3 students played some instruments (recorder and piano) led by Yee Xin Le(F3S). 5 malay girls danced through the song Can't Take My Eyes Of You right after it was sang by 2 teachers who are Cik Halimantun and one more teacher. Then, students from Form 5Sc1 sang the song  Lang Hua Yi Duo Duo  by Ritchie Ren. Kah Hor played the guitar. As usual, Pn. Zakiah did her thing where she sang a malay song.  ~ The class party was okay. Encik Samzari wasn't there. Don't know why. We did it for him and he wasn't there. Could have called someone to look for him. The teacher's day celebration became a mess when everyone started throwing cakes at each other. For example, Form 4Sc1.. the prefects were playing with cakes. They dirtied their shirt, with fancy colours. Our class was a mess too. Kheng Loon wiped some cream on Rachael's hair. Wow!  Here are some of the picture taken on this very day...     Ms. Lim and Shook Yee at the field in the morning.      Class picture... but someone is missing...      Yes. Another one.      Ms. Lim again but this time around, she is accompanied by Ai San and The Kat!      Yummy... only after we arranged it properly. No wonder we'r ein commerce class.      The cake... with the word 5K2 on the chocolate topping!      Our basic economics teacher!      Yes. The Blacks and The Whites performing together... for the first time... and the last time...

      Exams over. Lessons are conducted as usual, but we were allowed to do our own work for most of the periods, or in other words, we are given the permission to talk to our friends, making noise.  ~ Today is the last day to practise for the Teacher's Day Celebration tomorrow. I guess it will rather be a tiring day tomorrow. There will be games, performances and class party! For the first time, we go to school to enjoy, and not stufy all day long!   Practices were good. We had a great time practising. And we even made our own version of Avril's latest single 'Don't Tell Me'. And now, our version starts like this:   You are my friend, in SSG, and I love to kick your ass Some big, some small, some fat, some thin, I love to kick them all I kicked your ass, you kicked my ass, and we're both kicking ass It was joyful, yet was painful, but we kept on playing that...   ~ It's not done yet. Lolz... Andrew's party is taking place tomorrow! I haven't even get him a present. Hm... any ideas of what I should get for him? I'm out of ideas for the 564th time in my life.   Something is wrong to me after exam. I feel lost. No more loads of work. Life's becoming boring. Haha, but I actually have lots of work to finish. Annual report, moral project, Joint IU Day... well, something is still missing. I wonder what could that be...  Here's another picture of my fav idol of all time>>> Beyonce

      It rained today! Finally!!!  ~ Exam is over for me now. I'm so glad that it is. I had my last 2 papers today for Additional Mathematics. They gave me hard times. The questions were tough. So, as usual, I didn't manage to do all. :)  I just realised that if one falls down on the floor, no help will be offered and one will have to stand up straight again all by himself. It describes the attitude of most of the people in this world right now. They are stingy and only think about themselves. But of course, it is a good thing too. People learn to be independent and not relying on others all the time.  ~ Teacher's Day celebration is so close. I can't wait to see all the performances on that day. And on the same day, Andrew will be celebrating his birthday too! What a day then. I haven't get a present for him.  Sei lor!    This Thursday there will be a F3 card member sales preview in Mid Valley Mega Mall from 3-10! Members get to enjoy an additional 20% discount on top of the sale discounts ranging from 30%-50% and a 10% discount on regular items. There will be specially arranged activities such as Hair Makeover, Tattoo Art Painting and Nail Art Painting too! Hm... I'd better save up some money now. Anyone wants to follow?  ~ Just recently I realized that I'm a bit annoying to some people.  Haha...   *If everything is under control, then you are moving slow*  Btw, here is a picture of my idol, Beyonce. She recently launched her own fashion label I think. Congrats!

      It was a fine day!  ~The practice in school was funny. Kelly, Julia, Eric and Rachael were there and not forgetting Encik Iskhandar too. We have chosen the songs>>> I'll be There and Jeng Tian(Jay Chou).   Went to Times Square again. Got a haircut. Now the solon like so high tech ledi. Or mebbe I'm just outdated or something. They provide internet surfing for the customers. So you can actually log on into internet and browse through it while you have your hair done by the barbers. And bought some stuff. Saw Nian Shao in Sungei Wang. In English, the local canto band is called um... Island something ar... I can't remember. The Calling's brand new album called 'II' will be released internationally on the 24th of May! 9 more days to go!  As for my update on Malaysian Idol, I heard that the contestants should prepare 1-2 songs and in different language if possible. Sounds tough. Shit.

      Hm... Hopefully today will be great. Going to school in the morning then to Times Square to get a haircut and the latest DVD from Shakira. Wanted to get it yesterday, but the Salem Power Station shop in KLCC didn't have it. Lousy.  ~I'm starting to be afraid of the Malaysian Idol autition. I don't know why. Mebbe cuz I haven't choose my song and I'm not prepared at all.   2 more exam papers to go and that is one of toughest paper of all time. Additional mathematics. Er...   ~Teachers' Day is coming. I can't wait to see the celebration in school as this is my last year in SSG!!!  I'll be back in the evenings, tell you what happened after that!

       Sunday, 27th June 2004   Woke up at 6.30a.m. today! Yes! You might think that I'm crazy for waking up that early on a Sunday. But I have no choice because I ave to meet up with Ms. Lim in the Putra Indoor Stadium, Bukit Jalil at 6.15a.m. When we were there, there was nobody else except some security guards and cleaners. People only started arriving after 7.30a.m.!   ~ 35 schools joined the Cheer 2004 this year. I'll just cut short of everything. I met Cheng Han, Ming Kee and Phoi Ying there. And um... Shewanaz wasn't in the top 3. The winner was Shirtliff again, the winning team from Sekolah Bintang Utara(SBU), the 1st runner-up was Dynamitez followed by Xavier from Convent Bukit Nanas(CBN) whereas the Best newcomer was the All Boyz team Vulcanz!  I won't include any pictures as all the pictures were quite blur. But I'll post the one with Bellefire! And Vince from Akademi Fantasia performed too. But uh, I don't really like him. And Jien was the host again!     Bellefire performing their hit single, "Say Something Anyway".     Jien caught in action!

      Sorry for not updating my blog for quite a while.   I'll start with Saturday, 26th June 2004.   Woke up quite early today. Had to go to Dynasty Hotel near Titiwangsa to attend Jalan Ipoh Girl School's 11th Annual International Understanding Day. That was the most expensive I.U. Day that I've been to. They charged everyone RM18 nett! Well, can't blame them as they're having it in a hotel! But I heard that they have it in the hotel every year. Hm...  richnya !  ~ Some of the higlights of the events were: 1) The dance performances.  2) The food. 3) The decorations. 4) The fashion show.  Well, I thought I was attending a dance fiesta more than an I.U. Day as most of the performances were dances and they even had a dance competition! But overall, it was still a good one. I guess that will be the final I.U. Day that I will attend.  ~ Here are some of the pictures that I took:

      Time passes so quickly and it's already Wednesday. This morning  urlLink May Yenn  came into the class with a miserable face and she cried today. I'm not sure why, but that's kinda normal... sorry to say.  ~ Well, we copied notes during Commerce class today again. Then, all the students from K classes were asked to go down to attend the Basic Economics Seminar with Mr. Karthikeyan. He's a really friendly and nice person. He gave us a lot of tips. As usual, Ee Vonn (Miss Tidur) slept again during the seminar. Haha...   Nothing much happened during classes for the rest of the day. But something is going to happen to the Form 5 prefects! We're in trouble again! And to make things worse, there's a problem in Boys' Brigade too! I'm in deep shit right now. I'm shattered!  * Can't help fallin in love... *

       Tuesday, June 22, 2004   Highlights:   ~ History was fun today. Mr. Rama talked about a lot of things.   ~ Fire drill happened at 9.30 a.m. and everyone essembled in the field again. Then, we were taught how to use the fire extinguisher.  ~ Kezanne is angry because she didn't get the post of the President in Interact Club.  ~ Encik Iskhandar had something to do after lunch. Therefore, we had free lessons since lunch because the subjects after lunch were CSA and English.  ~ Oh yea, I bought a new shirt from last Saturday. I love it, it's nice enough to me.

       Monday, June 21 2004   Highlights  ~ Received a badge for being the monitor for my class during assembly. Ai San received one too. I'm just so fortunate to have her as my assistant.   ~  urlLink May Yenn  was talking about being herself. Therefore, she's becoming a bit sarcastic sometimes.  ~ Inez is back! She now looks like Christina from Form 4. Everyone says that and she's getting annoyed by it!  ~ Had a great time during Commerce class. There was only 9 students in the class after lunch. Others were involved with the cheerleading (practice or decorations).     Yes. The badges that I have so far. The top one is the Interact Name Tag. The monitor badge is on the bottom left while the right one shows the prefect badge.

      Happy Father's Day to all fathers who is reading my blog!!!  ~ Went to Sungei Wang today and ate at the Hong Kong Style Noodle House. It was hot. And I witnessed something really terrible. There was a table behind me with 4 persons, 2 middle-aged men and 2 ladies. All in a sudden, one of the guy slapped the girl in front of the public. Then, the 2 ladies left, and the food was just served, they were not even touched when that happened. The 2 guys kept on eating as if the guy just now just did the right thing to the girl! What a horrible scene!  After lunch, my stepmom, sister and I went to do a little shopping that lasted for an hour. My stepmom bought a clothe while my sister went to a ringtone shop and purchased some ringtones. The whole outing was boring. I met Chee Yeong there. He went to collect his prefect uniform. My stepmom then asked me how old is he as he looks quite young. She was shocked when I told her that he's only Form 1. She has always thought that I don't mix around with younger kids. Sigh...

      Planned to wake up at 7.30a.m. today, and of course, the alarm did woke me up, but I went back to sleep again for another 30 minutes. In the end, my mom woke me up when she said that she had prepared my breakfast! Although in a rush, I spent quite a long time thinking of what I should wear. I just bought a new shirt from TopMan yesterday just to use the bloody RM25 voucher that expires tomorrow! Well, I went out today to SMK Puteri Ampang, near AmpWalk to attend their International Cum Installation Day.  ~ It starts at 9.30a.m. and I was late since I woke up at 8.00a.m. as I left my house at 8.45a.m. to take LRT. It doesn't go right to the place, so I had to change to Putra at Masjid Jamek. The school is quite far from Ampang Park. Walking there made me sweat a lot. So I decided to stop by AmpWalk to get a drink and to dry off my sweat. When I reached the school, it was quite empty from the outside as everyone was in the hall already. I was greeted by 2 interactors at the registration counter and they asked me to register. I wrote down my name and my position. The girl was quite shocked when she knew that I'm the President. And she asked me am I the only one who will be attending, and as usual, yes. They charged me RM6 as I'm interactor, although I wasn't wearing my Interact uniform. And they gave me a piece of tissue also, how kind of them to do so!  The theme for their event was Vision Through Darkness. For that, the hall was very dark. When I entered it, I could hardly see a thing except the stage. I simply sat at my place and in coincidence, Cheng Han was just 2 rows in front of me. When I was there, I already missed out the roll call, the singing of the national anthem, the interact song and speeches. Luckily I didn't miss the opening ceremony. Right after that, it was time for entertainment. Oh yea, I noticed that the backdrop was really nice. So, the performances started with a drama. It was nice. Better than ours. It was quite meaningful, but the story seems like a paste from a story that I read from electronic mail. After that, they had a dance by Britney and Madonna wannabes. So the song was none other than "Me Against the Music".  ~ Time for refreshment came and everyone went to the canteen. They served fried mee hoon, curry vege-chicken, normal chicken nuggets, spicy chicken nuggets, jellys and cin cau. The nuggets were finishing very fast and we all took about 50 of them! Then, I went to their exhibition hall. They did a lot of research and work on it. But I have a thought. Once I entered the room, I thought I entered a sauna or something as they lit up a lot of candles in the room. Being in the room for 5 minutes made me sweat a lot. So I decided to snap 1 or 2 pictures and ciao as quickly as possible.   After that, I went back into the hall for more entertainment. This time around, a girl sang "There You'll Be" by Faith Hill. She's a really good singer, but the mic went on and off. So the performance wasn't that good. Then, I think it was time for the African Dance. It was awesome. I wished I could have joined them. Hm... what else. Oh yea, the fashion show. It was a short one but antertaining enough. The performances ended with a song and dance performance by a group of incoming and outgoing interactors. And guess what, they used the song "She Bangs" by William Hung. Of course, everyone laughed at them.   ~ Then, their installation took place. And right after that, it was time for presentation of souvenirs to the guests. The fellowship was canceled, so that was the end of it. Before I went off, I got Ee Vonn's contact. She's the new President for that Club. She's cool, smsed her for quite a while and she sounded very friendly to me.  Here are some of the pictures taken during the event:    Hot! Hot! Hot!     But the idea was still brilliant!     Draculas attack!     Angel of Sadness!     Angels of Love!     Angels of Happiness!     Angels of Beauty!     The last angel!     This is their souvenir. Not bad at all.      The program book (the butterfly stick), the bracelet (souvenir to the guest) and glow-in-the-dark stick.

      Hm... didn't update my blog yesterday simply because I was busy playing o2jam! My character is now lvl 5!!! Phew!  ~ These days, I noticed a change in  urlLink May Yenn's  character. She has become a rather horny person, and hyper at the same time. Not mentioning her screaming from time to time in class. She just talk about sex all the time as if she's desperate for it. No offence, you might say that I'm conservative, but it's just not the right time to be talking about sex. Sometimes when one talks to much about sex, she can be addressed as a slut. That's what I think. ;p  So, tomorrow 19 interactors will be going for interview session with Cik Kasmariza, Amanda and I so that they can be elected as the new board of directors. Kezanne and Darren must be going for the post of the president... I think Chao Ying is going for that post too. Sze Yin is wishing for the Funding Director while Rebecca wants to be the Publicity Director. Christine is opting for either the Treasurer or the Club Funding Dir. That's all I know. Luckily I didn't have to go through all these interviews last year or else I won't be the President for 2003/2004.  ~ I saw my report card today. My average score was 84. It was a major drop from my average percentage for my last exam. I think I did better last time. But, I still manage to set a few highest score for 2 subjects which were Mathematics and Science. Hopefully, I'll do better next time and I could have put in more effort this time to get at least 12 more marks in the exam so that I can beat Kelly. Anyway, she's very competitive as she always stay at home and she attends tuition classes.   Lately, I've been getting quite lazy. I don't know why. And Inez isn't around. Life's boring in class. Well, at least I get to focus more in class I guess. But still, I love my life more than anything else. I just remembered that May Yenn said that my life's boring, unlike hers. Maybe she's right... However, I believe everyone has their on way of living. Some are playful all the time, some are calm all the time like me, some are in the middle. So which groups do I fall into? I always ask myself.

      I was way too busy with the Interact Club Annual Report yesterday until I spent all the time on it without sacrificing a few minutes to update my site. Anyway, nothign much happened yesterday. First day of school, it wasn't screwed up. I love school, but only for this span of time.   ~ Finally, I finished the annual report and handed it up with Amanda in Menara TA today. Cheng Han and Arroon were there with us, handing up their club's annual report too. We saw Sekolah Bintang Utara (SBU) Annual Report there too. It was fantastic. The decorations... whoa! Cheng Han kept mentioning Maxwell all the time. He's kinda looking down on them. But who knows, they might give us a surprise. Well, I think we stand a chance to win at least something this year... hopefully. I heard that the Form Four interactors might throw a farewell party for the ourgoing members of the club! Yeah! That means lots of fun and free food. But I still feel  berat hati  to leave the club so fast. And I only need to attend one more ICC meeting only. I might never see the other interactors again. That's kinda sad to me.  We had a fire drill during mathematic lesson today. Ms. Lim tricked us by saying that we can rest starting from 9.30a.m., making us happy for a while. Then all in a sudden, the fire bell alarmed us and we had to go down. Jon said, "why don't this happen during economics?". And when we were down in the field, Ms. Khoo suddenly teased Jon about that. Somebody must have told Ms. Khoo about it... who could it be? Traitor... Lolz!  ~ Out of all the subjects I had today, I liked English the most. Simply because Encik Iskhandar was very sarcastic today. And he was joking a lot today. Other than that, the other lessons were still okay. During history lesson, we talked about many things as usual, such as National Service, politic issues, etc. Mr. Rama is just so informative. He knows everything. What a good teacher!  Nothing else to blog about for today. I'm sure tomorrow will be a brand new day!   "Success is a lousy teacher; it produces smart people who think that they can't lose" ~ Bill Gates

      Yes. School is going to reopen tomorrow. Well, everyone is sad about it. But I'm a bit excited as well. I mean, I really hope that something could happen the next term. I love changes in my life. But not all.   ~ Tomorrow will be a rather different routine to me. No more Interact Club, no more prefect duty, no more extra curriculur activities. Damn. I hate to study, study and study all day long. Studying everyday is just not the right style to me. Maybe I'll accompany my friend, PS2 more the next term. It shall be entertaining enough to keep me busy and awake.  Did this stupid thing just now when I visited  urlLink May Yenn's Journal.

      Woke up at 5.45a.m. today. No, I did not mistaken today for a school day but it was actually a big day too as I have to attend the Joint International Understanding Day held in St. John Institution, Bukit Nanas. After all the preparations at home, I finally left at 6.30a.m. by cab and reached the place at 6.55a.m. It was very quiet there as if I'm the only one there. It was quite freaky. But at 7, at least somebody came after I heard the barkings of a dog in that school. I was afarid that the dog might bite me as I was an 'intruder' in that school. For one day, I became a student from Setapak High School. Why? As the Joint Installation consists only 4 schools, where SSG is not included, I was there to help out as an interactor from Setapak High School.   ~ Their I.U.Day was indeed very successful. It did entertain the audience and worked their asses very well. Unfortunately, due to insufficient of time, the line dance and fellowship was canceled. Out of all the I.U. Day I've attended so far, I admit that this is one of the best so far. Congrats! The bridge that they built was quite unstable... looks like the one who actually crosses the bridge must take risk as they might fall anytime. But, the bridge was a good idea. The program book was nice too. Colourful enough. As for the souvenirs, 10/10! Briiliant idea, artistic work! The fashion show was quite messy but overall, I'll say good job to all of them. Or to me too, as I'm involved. Haha...  Amanda for the first time went to other school's I.U.Day this year. What a surprise! But she left earlier with the reason that she had to go to church. But she also stated that the I.U. Day was good. :) She was quite a coward during the roll call. She knew that she might be the only one standing to represent SSG, so she didn't stand at all. It was quite embarassing. And someone booed too. I wonder which school doesn't like SSG. My sister and my stepmom came to the event too. And they left earlier, like Amanda. Aaron from Form 4 was there too. So surprising.   ~ The cleaning up session after the show was damn exhausting. Not only we have to carry the chair and sweep the floor, we had to carry all the timber to the scout house too. The woods were very heavy and there were like 40-50 of them I guess. The distance was far too. But it was a great experience to me. I learned how to carry wood properly, and even had a free work-out although it didn't involve some parts of the body. Sigh... luckily Ivan helped me with it. And the Vice President of the Setapak High was resting, relaxing and listening to music in the hall when we're doing that. How unfair. But he's the boss, what to do.   Here are some of the pictures I took with the other interactors from other schools.     Dora and I. She was my partner during the Sports Wear Fashion Show.     Yvonne, my partner for halloween costume.      Jung Kuan's sister!!!!     That's Adrian from Sri Sentosa.      Michelle from SAB. She's good at singing.      Man(left) and Iris(right) from SAB, our neighbour school. The both of them always call me BS(budak sesat) or Arabi...      Interact Club of Setapak High School's Annual Report!

      Slept at 1.30a.m. and had to wake up at 7.15a.m. this morning to go to SJI again for rehearsals. Not enough sleep since it's still holidays. Nothing much to blog about. I'm too lazy. Tomorrow, I'll have my last I.U. Day. It will be my last time spending time with people from other school as in big groups in a big event. Sigh... I feel quite sad for leaving the board soon. I had been having so much fun by meeting new people. Well, life moves on and things will change. But it was too quick. I wonder how many friendships will actually continue after the break-up...

      First of all, I'm going to post a few more pics of Malaysian once in a while. Okay, now back to my day.  ~ Woke up at 9.00a.m. today. Pretty late. Stayed up yesterday until 1.30a.m. to watch Magic Kitchen starred by Sammi Cheng and Jerry(F4). The movie was great. It deserves a 9.5/10 from me. The only problem was that they dubbed Jerry and Maggie Q's voice. They can't speak cantonese that well. Lolz...  Went to St. John Institution(SJI) by STAR Lrt today. The journey was quite surprising as I saw Kheng Loon, Jeremy, Bryan, Azlan and Fendi in Bukit Jalil station. They told me that they are supposed to train for the national team... hm... is that true?! Good news then! Reached Masjid Jamek station at 11.55a.m. and I met up with Michelle, Iris and 2 more girls at the Putra Lrt entrance. It just proves that I'm lucky at meeting up with people. By the way, when I was walking in Parkson Grand in Sungei Wang yesterday, I saw a local artist too. That's the fourth time I see him in public including my friend's house. SJI is far from the lrt station. It took us 10 minutes to walk to that school. It was tiring. I just noticed that the vending machines in that school sell the drinks at only 1 buck for 1! It's so cheap, compared to our school canteen. Sigh...  ~ We rehearsed the fashion show, singing and dancing the whole day whereas some of the committee members stayed back until 6 something to finish the backdrop and souvenirs I think. But I left quite early, at about 4.p.m. Here are the details for their I.U. Day:  Date   : 12 June 2004 Venue  : SJI Time   : 10.00a.m. Theme  : ??? Tickets: Should be RM8... but bring more money, heard that they're going to sell stuff.   To May Yenn, I don't know why you're afraid to face the fact. Love comes and fade away due to some reasons. Take it as a challenge. Just get over it and keep on living happily. There's always a solution to every matter. Just be patient and stay calm while waiting for the solution. With that, the problem will be solved eventually. And thank you for hating me. Thank you for being honest too. And please accept my apology for making you cry. I never meant to do so. But we can still be friends, can we? But I'm already the one you hate. Never mind, one day, if you need me, I will still be there for you. You're still my friend.     Jonathan dancing and stripping... I'm there clapping, can see me?     Hui Wen and Affina. They rock!     VCD Front for Magic Kitchen!     VCD Back for Magic Kitchen!

      Yes. I wasn't chosen. So what? I gained more than I lost. Most important is that I went through the whole process of it. It was cool. Yet tiring.  ~ I reached Times Square at 9.00a.m. Although it was early, many people were already there. Thank god I met Hui Wen. I wonder how am I supposed to wait without boredom if I hadn't met her. Well, the group got larger when we talked to Fairus I think. After that, our group got a new member who is Affina. She's cool. She wore this jeans that was very attractive as many of the camcorders holders shot her. I bet you will see her on TV. Just when we haven't get into the waiting area, we were joined by Eunice(studying in a music academy) and Jonathan(17 but looks like 20+). So at that time, we have 5 people in our group. Well, later in the audition waiting area, we were then joined by another 3 fellas, all Indians... but I can't remember their names. That's not the end of it, later on, our group got larger when a group of Penang folks joined us. Allow me to count. That will make our total number of members to... 14! We're like the most active ones in the whole room! I can't imagine going there all by myself, thinking that I can survive without anyone to talk to. But now, I admit that I'm wrong. Life's so much nicer with people to accompany you all the time.    Okay, I'm gonna sum up what other people whom I know sang: 1) Fairus - Belaian Jiwa by Innuendo 2) Hui Wen - Everytime by Britney Spears 3) Affina - Reflection by Christina Aguilera 4) Jonathan - A Frank Sinatra song...  ~ While we were patiently waiting for our turn of audition, many things happened. We had a free live dancing, games, and dancing class! The process of waiting was very memorable and shall be humming a sweet and lovely tune in my mind whenever I think about it. Anyway, the hosts for the show have been chosen, Jien and Aleya. Jien is quite okay, but the girl seems too goofy.   Why do I say that I gained more than I lost? Here's the calculations... lolz... 01) Free live dancing and it was raunchy!                 +2 02) Played spin-the-bottle-cum-dare                       +2 03) Jonathan did a strip tease                            +2 04) Affina had to sing in front of the whole crowd        +2 05) Getting free dancing class by a professional trainer! +4 06) Having the chance to make an advertisement for MI     +3 07) Playing a really lame game (passing the bottle)       +1 08) Jokes                                                 +2 09) Free mineral water                                    +1 10) Meeting new "friends"                                 +5 11) Getting good luck messages (1*no. of msgs)            +10 12) Had to wait for 6 hours (1*no. of hours)              -6 13) Not chosen                                            -5 14) Choosing the wrong song                               -2 15) Being nervous                                         -2 16) Not responsive                                        -3 17) Receiving a call from Jiu Wei and Ee Vonn             +2  And the total is... +18! In the end, once again, the process is more important. It has taught me lots of things. Why do I say I'm not responsive? Lolz... the lady called my reference ID for 4 times, and I didn't even respond to her. And yes, I was nervous when I sang the song. As for the advertisement, our group had to say,"Watch Malaysian Idol, Friday Night, on 8TV". What else, thank you to those who wished me good luck and they are:  01) Rachael Ong 02) Jonathan Tan 03) Jennifer Lim 04) Kelly Loh 05) Shook Yee 06) Cheng Han 07) Lisa 08) Amber Ho 09) Ivan Lai 10) Phang Jun Hoe  And of course, orally, those people who wished me good luck are none other than Jonathan and Fairus because we were in the same batch for the pre-audition. Thanks a lot to y'all! If I missed out anyone, please forgive me as my memory isn't that good afterall.  Well, my audition started at 3 something. It was late. The judges weren't Fauziah, Roslan and Paul as it was only pre-audition. Well, the indian guy said that I'm good. Maybe I sounded sucky, he said that just to make me feel better only. Anyway, it's over now and I'm back to my normal daily life. Hm... I guess I have to find other ways to lift my stardom. As for now, I shall concentrate on SPM... but before that, I have so many unsettled business... homework... annual report... and lots of tv programs that I have to watch!     The envelope that I received from 8TV on the spot.      The sticker that I had to stick on my shirt at the chest level!     Having a dancing class! It was fun! Look for me! Front row, 2nd from right!   I just received an sms from Christopher stating that I was shown on 8TV just moment ago. Damn, I always miss myself on TV!

      I have been working on the annual report for the whole day. But at least, it was worth it bacause I'm 95% done with the report on I.U.Day. Anyway, I just received an sms just now stating:   Congrats! Ur application 4 Malaysian Idol Audition is successful. Ur audition is on 9/6/04, 9am-5pm, 6th flr Berjaya Times Square. Make sure U arrive on time.   9am! I have to go there before 9! Oh my gawd! Sigh... hopefully I will be the first few ones so that my audition will be earlier. I hate waiting although I do have patience.  A short one today, because I have nothing much to say. Tomorrow shall be the same routine, wake up, bath and eat, work, work, lunch, work, work, dinner, work, blog, sleep...

      Stayed at home the whole day today. It was dead boring. I just read that Harry Potetr opened at 41.2 million in the U.S. box office. Bravo! It might break the all time weekend box office record I guess. It might now, but the record will be broken again by the opening of Spider Man 2 next month.  ~ Since I didn't go out, I have nothing much to blog about. I'm feeling nervous for my audition now. I'm so unprepared. But at least I have finalised my songs, If I Let You Go by Westlife and Belaian Jiwa. Hopefully, the first song will bring me luck.  I hereby include some of the pictures I took last year with my friends. It might be a bit blur, so don't strain your eyes.     Meng Yen, or known as Momo, is a very emotional person. You would never want to criticise her or her idol, Danieal Radcliffe or Harry Potter!     Shook Yee, or known as Fish, can sing very well and is a very sweet girl. She can take joke, and will fight back sometimes!     Jennifer, or known as Nixie, is a very smart and independent young lady. She's a survivor!     Inez, or known as Inez too, is heavier than me and rocks on her guitar all the time. She's like the female version of Eminem+Linkin Park!

      It has been exactly a week since school closed. And what does that mean? Our holidays left back a mere 8 days only! Time passes so quickly until i didn't notice that I have so damn many unfinished homework especially the Interact Club's annual report. I have been a lil' lazy lately, sigh...  ~ Went to Petaling Street just now with my sister and her lover. I got myself the box II for GetBackers which means I only have one more box to get before completing my collection. Petaling Street is damn crowded. It is such a busy market from morning to night, attracting hundreds of tourists to that place everyday I guess. Lots of pirated discs... a guy even asked me whether I want some pornographic vcds or not. I wonder why that happens to me everytime I go there. It's either I look mature, or I look horny! Sigh...   Still, I had a great time there. Saw many gays there... or maybe they are just friends who are holding hands for the fun of it. Btw, there was one of my favorite food there which is fried wanton! It was expensive though... 20 cents for one. Bought ten, ate all. Thinking about food, it reminds me of some pictures I took last year. Can you guess where all those food came from?           If you have guess our school canteen, then you are right! Our canteen food has never look any better I guess...

      Went out today again. First, I went to Plaza Ampang with some interactors. I don't think I'm sociable today. Got to know their names, but didn't really talk to the new ones whom I met today. What a loser! Haha... By the way, Ms. Charanjit suddenly called me. She said that she has rejected my picture and called me to send a few more to her. But I'll do that tomorrow, I was way too tired today and I was home only after seven!  ~ After Plaza Ampang, I went to Montaine again today. The instructor, Mr. Golbie (forgive me if I spelt your name wrongly) taught me a few more exercises. It was cool. I started off with 2 instructors helping me with the bicycle machine. it was quite embarrassing. Lolz. And one again, I didn't get to try the sauna and the jacuzzi. I'll try that this Sunday, hopefully.  Then, I went to my mom's shop again to have my lunch at 3.30p.m.! Had wanton mee. After that, I went to Sungei Wang again, as usual. Bought a face towel and a body towel. Sungei Wang wasn't that crowded today. But the jam was terrible when I went home.  ~ Yesterday, I bought the new issue for Newman and Rodale's Men's Health. Argh... when I flip to the page about new gadgets in town, it reminds me of my dream phone, Nokia 7200. I wonder when will I get that phone. I'm just short of money nowadays! Anyone wants to donate some money to me?!

       Lolz...   Like what Jennifer said, she and I went to watch The Day After Tomorrow at 10.45a.m. before watching Harry Potter: The Prisoner of Azkaban with Kin Hong, Julia, Adeline's brother(Kevin), Adeline's mom, Sin Cher, the fanatic Momo and Adeline of course. In my opinion, both movies are good. If you asked me which movie did I prefer... I would answer, both too! It's hard to choose. Both movies have their ups and downs.   ~ I had not have quite a good laugh in the cinema since the movie Spy Dad. Harry Potter did include some sense of humour in it. I laughed too much during the fat lady part. It was too entertaining to me. Whenever they show the hallway, I kept on thinking about that fat lady. Loved her. It was one of the best moments in that movie. And of course, I liked Hippogrif too. Is that how you spell the name of that animal? Emma has grown up a lot since I last seen her in the previous HP movie. She's hotter than ever for now. Heard that she's dating Daniel Radcliffe. Is it true? But I think they will make a lovely couple anyway.   I was looking at all the pictures I took last year. From now on, I will post some of it once in a while. Here are some of my sweet memories in Form 4K2!    Oh my gawd, they are gambling in class. According to SSG Rules no. 16.0 Prohibited Activities, it includes i. Gambling. This situation reminds me of by not-that-good memory that I had in Form 2S when I got caught red-handed by Pn. Alina for gambling in class. Sigh, and that was the first time I joined the group. Luckily, I won RM1!     She's Kelly, one of my classmates that has been around for me for like... 10 years!     Lolz, she's funny in class. Haha... she's one of my close friends too.

      At last I bought the VCD and watched the movie. Overall, I'll rate it 75/100. Why?  1) Beyonce is the lead actress in it. 2) The gospel songs were nice. 3) Beyonce's song was featured in the movie. With just those 3 reasons, I would have rated it 99/100 if I'm being bias.   ~ Anyway, it's already Wednesday and finally, I've made up my mind of the songs I will sing for my audition. The songs are: 1) My Love by Westlife 2) Belaian Jiwa by Innuendo 3) Leng Feng Guo Qing by 5566 Sigh. I'm not sure whether I chose the right songs or not. ~.~  By the way, Harry Potter opens tomorrow. Nothing to cheer about though. Haha...     Avril Lavigne's new album rocks. I give it a 6.5/10. She is more mature and no more a young skater girl.     Don't fight temptations. Support by buying the original!

      Haha... looks like I have nothing else to write but to write crap. Anyway, I went to school today for the Basic Economics extra class. Ms. Khoo was late, she arrived 30 minutes later and our class ended 10 minutes earlier! How fortunate! Later, I went to Montaine and has my first workout session. It was tiring. And I saw people learning yoga I think. It's quite funny looking at the way they stretch...  ~ Back to the topic, I cry a lot. I admit it. It's just weird for a guy to admit that he actually cries over movies, tv shows, or anime. I wonder why. But all these years, I had been crying over tragic stories or even happy endings. The followings are the futher information:   Movies/Dramas/Anime that made me cry:  01) Titanic - The famous dying part of Leonardo. 02) Lilo & Stitch - When Stitch was caught. 03) Pokemon: The First Movie - When Ash died, and Pikachu cried. 04) Love on a Diet - When Sammi Cheng cried. 05) My Left Eye Sees Ghost - When Sammi Cheng was parted from her husband. 06) Moulin Rouge - When Nicole Kidman died. 07) The Passion of The Christ - When Christ fell, and the mother reached for him. 08) Ice Age - Can't remember why I cried. 09) Daredevil - During the ending... 10) Pokemon 2000 - Don't know which part already... 11) Land Before Time - Same... can't remember... 12) Deep Impact - When the astronauts sacrificed their lives... 13) Brother Bear - When the older bear regretted of kelling the younger bear's mom. 14) The Duke on Mountdeer - When the princess died in the end(I cried for 6 times just for that part!) 15) The Amazing Race 4 - When the overweight lady got eliminated, it was sad to me. 16) The Amazing Race 4 - When the gay couple won. Don't know why I cried. Lolz. 17) Fushigi Yuugi - When they died one by one. Cried the most when Tamahome's family was murdered. I cried throughout the whole episode!  18) Yu Yu Hakusho - When the main character died at the starting. I haven't watch finish. So I'm not sure whether will I cry in another part or not. 19) Darker Descendents - Cried during the final part I think.  20) Meteor Garden 1 - That show brought me to tears a few times. One part was when Dao Meng Si protected San Chai from being hit by a chair.  I guess that's all I can remember. Lolz.

      Gosh... I have not been updating ym blog for quite a while. Sorry folks.  ~ Anyway, I jsut came back from Seremban with my family. We went all the way there to eat crab. They're like that, going to far places to taste the delicacies. The food didn't turn out as what we expected. We still prefer another restaurant that is in Kepong. The journey to the bloody shop was long, about 45 minutes from KL.   A week had passed. And of course, I watched Malaysian Idol yesterday. The third group tog o through the workshop wasn't that bad. Here's my own recap:  #01 Mimie - too much grinning, her ring doesn't suits the show, good voice #02 Keith - his smile is weird, too old, a safe performance though #03 Hana  - boring, out of tune, a bit plum #04 Yin   - legs are short, bracelet sucks, boring #05 Eddie - lousy shirt, pitchy, too still, and didn't say thanks for the comments! #06 Farah - fashion disaster, stuggled at the starting and chorus #07 Jac   - best performance, sounds like Fantasia, oversang #08 Fahmy - simple, pitchy, fashion disaster #09 Karen - originality, pitchy, bad rendition of song, necklace n jeans don't work #10 Zehra - package was bad, choose better shoes next time, boring #11 Saiful - Arab-style, traditional costume ar... , pitchy  Well, I've gotta say I think Saiful, Jac and Keith will move on to the next round. My predictions suck anyway. Like last week, I didn't even think of Victor to be one of the chosen ones. Sigh...

      Hm... lots of comments by the 3 judges:  1) Mostly about pronunciation. 2) Then, about appearance. 3) Then about voice. 4) Last but not least, their package.  I do agree with them sometimes, but not all the time. Here are my own personal comments on all the ten contestants, but I can't really remember all of them, especially their names. So, here it goes:  Contestant #01: Amanda - Thin; sounded like Anastacia. Contestant #02: ?????? - Ok-ok ler... Contestant #03: ?????? - Nice voice; the 'face'... Contestant #04: ?????? - ?????? Contestant #05: Andrew - Ok also, a bit nervous; a bit dull; looks like a HK star. Contestant #06: Anis   - A controlled performance; but looks old. Contestant #07: Rinie  - A bit too short although she was wearing heels; good voice. Contestant #08: Victor - English can be improved; his teeth; his performance? argh... Contestant #09: Rydee  - Sexy voice, but out of tune... Contestant #10: Aisha  - Didn't like the way she walks and her pair of shoes... Contestant #11: Fazly  - His outfit sucks; his teeth; english; hair  My choices: Andrew, Anis & Rinie. Least favourite: Victor, Rydee & Contestant #2.   Anyway, I did a quiz just now again.      Rabisu: The Devourers   Devourers are the warriors among the fallen, given charge of the beasts of the wilderness and infused with the nature of the predator. They are fierce and impulsive by course, favoring action over long-winded discussion. They incite, ravage, annihilate and move on.       urlLink   Choose your Place in Hell.     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      To take this test, kindly visit  urlLink Tickle.   Zzzzz... Wake up! You're guilty of SLOTH. Based on what your answers tell us, we're surprised you even managed to finish this test. Perhaps you only took it as a way to get out of other, more pressing tasks? We thought so. In fact, it looks like your life centers around avoiding work. Do your weekends consist of short excursions from the your warm, cozy bed? Do you think TV Guide qualifies as great literature? Remember, the remote control may very well be one of mankind's greatest achievements, but someone did have to do a little work to invent it. Why don't you try your luck and put a little effort into something, too? You might be surprised at what you can accomplish when you commit to something besides napping.  Why is sloth so bad? Well, according to early religious scholars, sloth destroys zeal. When we cut ourselves off from life's vitality, we'll eventually fall victim to complacency. We should fight the deadening of our spiritual senses by responding to the zeal and energy of our inner nature. It could be worse: Medieval Italian poet Dante Alighieri thought sloth was only the fourth deadliest of the seven sins, behind pride, envy, and wrath. (Of course, that ranking was based on Dante's own love of sleeping...)    p.s. ugh.... i don't think its accurate...

      I have often asked myself why am I born in this world, things that happened to me, and of course, thought about how my future would be in a few years time, as usual.  Sometimes, life's just so stuck up as if the world's ending for you.    Thought #1: Our parents were given the chance to decide whether to born us or not, but we didn't have the right to choose to be born or vise versa.  Thought #2: We were raised up the way our parents wanted, without given any choices.  Thought #3: Some parents think that they understand their children perfectly, but the truth is they know nothing at all.  Thought #4: Parents are just like parrots, repeating the same thing over and over again, or nagging.  Thought #5: With or without love, we'll still grow up. Unfortunately, the one brought up with love will eventually succeed in his/her life.   I'm not quite sure the reason we're born in this world, but I have a feeling that everyone has thei own 'star seed' and they are to shine in this world. Unless we live in darkness, we'll be able to make a difference. What I believe is that we are suppose to lead the world to a better future. We are to live, inspire, then die off, and would be remembered by the next generation.  You might be offended, but like what my friends call me, I'm just a optimistic guy that would never know when I hurt someone else.    Love and hatred, they are the same. They are feelings that are kept in our hearts and only we ourselves know it. And being independant, we're our own doctor and we could heal any internal wounds within ourselves. Let out the pain and hatred, let them be sucked into the black hole, and live with 'the sun'.  That's why I love sunrise, where it marks a new beginning. Sunset isn't that bad either, because it will reflect what we did in the past.

       Kevin, you're single because you don't want to settle    You, more than others, have a fairy tale fantasy of how things should be. Ever since you were a kid, you've probably dreamed of the perfect wedding, coming home to a white picket fence, dog, and 2.2 kids (how does that work, anyway?). When someone asks what you're looking for, you don't skip a beat: You're likely to have a handy checklist that details your perfect partner. Hair and eye color, height, religion, education, career, interests, the list goes on.  While it's great to have standards — Hey, you shouldn't have to settle, after all — there's one slight glitch in your master plan: No one has made the grade in real life — at least not yet. Next time you're out with someone, keep yourself from mentally checking that list, and give love — and others — a chance. That special someone who you've written off may be perfect for you after all...

      Ever thought about buying an SUV and joining a tennis club? You should, because you were made for the elite. We can tell that you enjoy many of the finer things in life, but for some reason you just can't make the leap to "millionaire material." Sure, that's a step down from the top of the money pile, but it's probably all for the best. Why? Perhaps because, when it comes down to it, you enjoy fun more than money. Cash is all well and good, and we can tell that you're pretty good at saving your dough when you put your mind to it, but you'd rather spend time outdoors, hang out with friends, or plan your next big trip than drool over your bank balance. After all, what's money for if you can't enjoy it?

      Many things happened since Friday. My friend from a far place was back. Koki replied my mail. Well, I went to my friend's place in Old Klang Road and his place reminded me of all the good times I had there. I could still remember the times when we played this computer game where we had to create our own pizza. It was cool. Then, I remembered the times when he taught me how to play basketball, playstation especially Dragonball where we challenged each other a lot when we were young, the times when he brought me out, chowed me things, etc. I had spent 40% of my precious childhood there.  &nbsp;  Anyway, his family had now migrated to Perth, Australia. So, I don't see him that often since he went to England to futher his studies last year. Well, I still remember I used to go to his house and spend weeks there during holidays. Never mind, I guess this is the process of growing up.  &nbsp;  Now back to today. Nothing much until evening. My family brought me to the Bon Odori Festival in Shah Alam. The journey was long and boring, but the festival was hot and sexy in a way that it rocks. When we entered the field, we were given a fan each. But, we actually took all the designs in the end. Haven't heard of the Bon Odori Festival? Here's a brief history taken from  urlLink http://mothra.rerf.or.jp/ENG/Hiroshima/Festivals/50.html .  &nbsp;   July 15 (Lunar calendar), or August 15 (Solar calendar) is celebrated in Japan as "Bon" or Urabon, The Feast of Lanterns, especially by the Japanese Buddhists. It is said that during the year, on this day only, the iron pot in hell is opened for the deceased. Buddhist services are held at temples and private houses for ancestors, relatives and friends who died in the past, and particularly for those who passed away during the past year.  The particular feature of Obon is the offering of various foodstuff to the deceased, and of course all those who as emble for the service will partake of special food prepared for the day. This is because Obon originated in a Buddhist legend.  Obon used to be quite an important social event, and for attending the family Obon service, such persons engaged in works away from their native places invariably returned home. To factory and shop apprentices or household maids, Obon and January 15 were only two holidays in the whole year, when they were permitted to return home to their parents.  Eager to guide properly the spirits of ancestors on the day, it is customary to light lanterns at all houses. Some such lanterns were formerly very elaborate, especially made for the occasion. The most important feature of the service is the offering of food. Therefore to the ancestors are offered rice, vegetables, fruits, cakes, sweets and flowers. There are prepared special foods to be served to invited guests and friends. It is the spirit of giving food to fellow people that lies under this religious service. It is religious day, but also quite a ioyful social occasion.  In the Hiroshima area, colored paper lanterns are lighted at the ancestral graves. The white ones are for those who passed away during Aug. 16 of the previous year till Aug. 15 of this year.  "Toro-Nagashi" or lantern floating is the picturesque ending to the Obon service. To guide the ancestrial spirits back to the other world, littel floats are lighted with candles and floated down rivers or on the sea. People eagerly watch them float down the river or carried by the wind far away from the shore.  "Bon-Odori" or Bon dance, a religious folk dance, was originally given to comfort the spirit of the dead during the o-bon season. It is enjoyed by men, women, and even little children. It differs naturally according to locality, as each district has its own songs and styles of dancing. Recently many modern or even foreign songs and dances have been introduced to these programs. It is generally held in temple or shrine compounds sea or river shores or other convenient public places. A raised towerlike stand is erected and around the stand the people dance all night with the music.     &nbsp;  Well, the food was delicious. I spent about RM40 there. Thank god my mom sponsored me. I tried the beer too. It was just like Carlsberg. But the fella told me that it's the most popular beer among the Japanese.  &nbsp;  Here are all the pictures I took during the event!&nbsp;  &nbsp;     My, myself and I!  &nbsp;     With my sister!  &nbsp;     With some Japs!  &nbsp;     More Jap!  &nbsp;     And more Japs!  &nbsp;     All together, we took 16 fans!&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I'm feeling a bit miserable today. I don't know why. I had my first nap at home in 2004 today. I was in my room, watching Bulletproof Monk, and suddenly, my eyes went tired and I slept for 2 hours. Haha... bet I can't sleep early tonight.  ~ Well, there's nothing much to say about today. I'm a bit pissed off when they canceled the movies tomorrow. I was just thinking that after the trial, I would rather watch Catwoman and King Arthur. Anyway, the last minute cancelling disrupted my weekend schedule. Now, I would have to follow plan B, where I would go to Wesley Methodist School or SMK Bandar Baru Sri Petaling tomorrow for their Installation Day.  Went to McDonalds today and tried the fried prawns. I can't remember the name for the food already. I didn't like it. It wasn't crispy enough and not fulling at all. Next, I would love to try the McPrawn, the one that comes with a burger.    SPECIAl Joke of The Week:   This is a real story and it happened on the 8th July 2004, during lunchtime, in front of our school hall. Jon and I was there, with  urlLink Meng Yen  and Shook Yee. Pn. Siti was so happened to pass by us, eating an ice-cream.   Meng Yen : Wah teacher, eat ice-cream ar. Pn. Siti : Haha... this is not for people like you! Meng Yen : Wad!  At that time, Jon and I burst into laughters.  In random, the Japanese Festival is back.

      First of all, Happy 17th Birthday Dexter! I've known you since standard 1 i think and you introduced me to Magic The Gathering at that time. Haha...   ~ Today, as usual was another tiring day to me. All teachers came, so there wasn't any free lessons. But still, I rather to have something to do than to have nothing to do. Lunchtime was boring! Unlike the olden days, I had duty to do. And now, I would have to sit in the canteen, waiting for the bell to ring. It is just a bit weird for me to be sitting, without any work to be done. Hopefully, I'll find anything that can fill up my empty slots in my time-table!  The weather these days has gone crazy. One moment, the sky is bright and the sun is burning the earth, then the next moment, the dark clouds hid the sun away and poured acidic water on us. Luckily, not many people fell sick for that because usually, we tend to get sick then the weather is 'unstable'.  ~ When I was passing the corridor today, I read the article on the results for the Cheer 2004. I thought that if Melani didn't fall, they might have got more points and would be ranked higher. Maybe 8th or 9th. But the number of teams that participated in the competition this year had increased. Therefore, it is okay to get 11th out of 35 schools competing for the title.   This  urlLink Nixie  and  urlLink Amber  were very  kepoh  when they asked me why I put 'confused' and 'blushing' in my nickname. Of course, there's a hidden secret beneath it that can't be told to anyone at all. I'm just shy... way too shy...   In random, I'll qoute Encik Iskhandar. "This was ONCE a good class" (referring to 5K2)!

        PASSIONATE LOVER. You love to love, always looking for a relationship. You cannot live without it. Your lover must be passionate  and you want that you and your partner melt into each other. He/She should not try to take the domination . You dont want a relationship without passion, and the sexuality plays a big part. The first moment you meet him/her is one of the most important. There has to be something between you , you cannot explain. From the first moment on everything must fix. But when this passion disappears you disappear to. For you it is better to leave than to see your love restrained.  PLEASE VOTE, I want to know what you think about my quiz, I worked hard on it.You can always message me or tell me how I can improve that quiz. Ill sure write back.    urlLink   	~THE big LOVE TEST!!

        Youre the wolf of fire! You are the one who is most likely to be a leader. The wolf of fire has a deep passion for almost anything and is very noble. They are athletic and rough but are still tender on the inside. These are probably not the most rare type but they are still very special. A fire wolf is such a cool being the way they eat and hunt together. If you are the fire wolf then you are very social and proud although you are not always loyal. But, still being the fire wolf is a good thing because they are strong and do most things independently.     urlLink   What Elemental Wolf Are You?

      Wah! I've not been updating my blog for quite a while. Sorry guys. I'll just skip to what happened today.  ~ Well, I went for my last ICC meeting. It was a bit saddening but still, I feel that the burdens are gone by now.   After that, I went to Sungei Wang with Darren, Annjoe, Sieu Theng and Jovann. Darren of course planned to  pak to  there with Annjoe. Sieu Theng wanted to have her ears pierced whereas Jovann wanted to cut his hair. We broke up in front of Guardian Pharmacy. Then, I went to my mom's restaurant for 2 hours to have my lunch there. When I was back at Sungei Wang, I went to Low Yat to get an MP3 player. Wah, I just spent my own money on unnecessary things.  Tungz!  Met Arroon in front of the HK Movies shop before I went home.  Oh yea. Some of the things that happened this week. I bought The Calling's new album, 'II'. Ai San had her birthday bash on Monday. I appeared on TV for approx 1 second in the show, Malaysian Idol!

      I had finally finished  Onimusha 3: Demon Siege  for easy mode. Hehe... yeap, I played the easy one. Now, I would love to try the normal mode and that would take me another week I guess. I would leave that for the holidays. Right now, I shall start playing  Bujingai: The Forsaken City.    ~ Had a few surprises today. First, it has to be the marks for my  History  paper. I was expecting 75 or so. Then, I actually improved for  Commerce  paper. And guss what, this is the first time I get an A2 for the subject this year. I got 3B for that subject during the first 2 exams! As for  Additional Maths , I actually scored 93 for my paper 2, which was above my expectations. Haha... a great day I shall say.   Random topic for the day  ~ Underwear. Clothing worn under other clothes next to skin. Underwear includes boxer, brief, trunk, jockstrap, g-string, etc. Actually, why is underwear important? Some believes that underwear protects our important organs. Some believes that it prevents certain diseases, for cleanliness.   Some people choose not to wear it at home, but I would say 99% of the people who's in the public wears an underwear. I myself prefers not to wear it, but I'm force to wear it everywhere, at home, in school, in shopping malls. I just can't imagine not wearing underwear when I'm out. It might be more comfortable, but the thang will not be 'placed' well as nothing holds it on to something. Can you imagine a guy that doesn't wear underwear suddenly gets an erection out of nowhere? That would be funny and hilarious as well as embarrassing. You can just see a tent in the trousers or something. Even worse, when a guy's erect, pre-cum stage occurs and that would create a wet spot in the touching surface. WOuldn't that make things worse?  ~ In conclusion, wear underwear in public, but it's not necessary to wear it at home I guess unless you have guests in your house. Haha... and I think briefs suck. I prefer boxer briefs... Lolz....

      I nearly fell off the stairs in school today. Then, I injured my toe at home. It bleed, and it scared me!   ~ Anyway, nothing much happened today. Received back a few more results today. I think it is time to set my targets for the next trial. Perhaps, I should start studying already, but I'm way too lazy. All I care now is to finish Onimusha 3 as soon as possible! Maybe I would just start revising during the holidays...   Random topic of the day  Quite a few people often thinks that I like Kelly or Julia. I might be close to them, but I just like them as a friend. Besides, they already have a boyfriend... It's just funny how rumours are made up.

      Great day I had. Why? I had a few surprises over my results. I mean, they're good. Suddenly, I see all the hope coming back. I got  98  for  Maths , but I'm still not satisfied with it. Luckily, there is one question that might help me boost my marks so that I can maintain my record. Before that, I received back my  Moral  paper too. Got an  80  for it. Not bad, she counted  86  at first... haha... she's so kind to me.   ~ Then, during  Science , we discussed the objective paper. I got a  42  out of  50  which is good enough for me. I remember that I got  35  out of  50  for the objective paper during Mid-year examination. After that, it was time for  Commerce . As usual, we marked our objective papers as well. I got  30  out of  40 , which is fairly good. My  Commerce  isn't that good, but the score did improve compared to the last exam where I got  28 . Finally, it was time for  English . I got  91  for the paper. It was a shock. I thought I would only get  85 - 88  for it.   Tomorrow will be my dooms day, with  History ,  Additional Maths ,  Malay  and  Basic Economics . I'm not really confident in thsoe subjects. But as far as I'm concern, there's always Trial II.

      Life after  trial  is awesome. No worries, no pressure, no tension. I can't wait for  SPM  to be over now. Anyway, I stayed at home the whole day today.  ~ Nothing much happened today. Morning, had tuition. Afternoon, went online. Late afternoon, played  Onimusha 3 . Evening, watched TV. Night, which is now, online again. Haha...  I'm kinda afraid right now. Afraid of getting the results for my trial. Afraid of going to  Genting  next week where I have to stay with strangers. Afraid of another problem which is occurring. But still, I have courage. Sometimes I just feel that life's better if I had done better things, that leads to a better life. Don't get me wrong, I'm still enjoying my life, haha...  ~ Congrats to  Kelvin Kam  for getting into the top 8 for the um... O2Jam tournament held in Penang yesterday. He's qualified for the  national  level which will be held in Kuala Lumpur! Congrats to the 9 newspaper that won the NIE Newspaper 2004. Although we're not one of them, but we tried our best. Congrats to  Zero  for getting a new  girlfriend . Hope you all will have a  steady  and  long-lasting  relationship. Anymore, I think that's all... haha...

      Yeap. It's over. And it's already August. It is just roughly 3 months away before the real SPM. And I'm here, blogging, after playing my PS2.   ~ Started a new game called Onimusha 3:Demon Siege. Heard of it? The game uses the faces of Takeshi Kaneshiro and Jean Reno as their main characters. It's a cool game. The settings are in France and Kyoto, Japan. The story's a bit complicated, but the samurai(Takeshi) is way too cool. So far, I've discovered 3 swords that can be used. They are thunder sword, wind sword, and fire sword. Sounds cool, huh? Overall, I give it a rating of 8/10. (It's given a 8.3/10 in gamespot.com)  Here are some of the screenshots from the game.

      Watched I,Robot today in KLCC... Here's the info for the movie taken from  yahoo.com    Action/Adventure and Science Fiction/Fantasy    1 hr. 55 min.  Will Smith stars in this action thriller inspired by the classic short story collection by Isaac Asimov and brought to the big screen by director Alex Proyas (Dark City, The Crow). In the year 2035, robots are an everyday household item and everyone trusts them, except one slightly paranoid detective (Smith) investigating what he alone believes is a crime perpetrated by a robot. The case leads him to discover a far more frightening threat to the human race.   ~ Well, the show was hilarious and thrilling. I'll give it a 3.5 stars out of 5.

      Yes, here I am again feeling fresh and charged up. I had a good sleep and a nice dream as well. Guess what I dreamt... I can't remember everything, but the main idea was about Sailormoon. Haha, I guess Bloody Roar 4 had made me think of anime a lot.   ~ Skipping school again as I have no exam today. Today, I'm determined to start a new PS game and revise my Mandarin, Japanese followed by Econs and Commerce. I don't know whether I can finish the syllabus, but I'll try my best. I don't think I would have time for Gunbound today. Even if I have, I would only play for an hour or so.   Hereby is the lyrics for the song 'Believing' by The Calling from their brand new album II: (I like this song a lot, the lyrics are meaningful too)[Thanks to http://www.azlyrics.com for the lyrics]   Believing    I'm one man to  make a difference   I'm one soul all  persistence   In a  dark world , just trying to make things right   Choices  we weren't given  Any heroes, and  our decision   Is to  stand up  and  fight for ourselves    [Chorus:] To be  free   Is  all we want  to be  When everything  seems so far  out of reach  But  I know , no matter where we go  I'll  never stop believing  in me   Woke up  bent  and  broken   Just to find that  fate has spoken   And I call out I call out for a  change   For every  moment  that remains  For every  sinking stone  to find its place  Long before they're  washed away    [Chorus]  We've been  waiting  for too long  We've been  giving  in to wrong  And we've been  broken to pieces  one by one   We're  gonna know   We're gonna know   When the moment comes    [Chorus]

      Skipped school today and woke up at 11.00a.m. That's late huh... yes it is late. Usually I will wake up at 8.00a.m. even though there's no school. I guess I was a bit exhausted over the exam. But, it's not over yet, sigh... Friday's the last day. Well, I can't wait for the exam to be over...  ~ I downloaded GunBound yesterday but didn't start playing it until this morning due to technical problems yesterday night. The game is not as bad as I've thought. My nickname? shijuanzhu again. Haha... Jon taught me how to play the game.  Thanx!  Then, I challenged Kelly. I had a hard time trying to win her. After that, in the afternoon, I met this girl who teamed up with me. She was a rather friendly girl and added me as her friend. I'm not sure where she's from, but at that time, it's already nighttime at her place.   Other then playing gunbound, I also started back my playstation fever. Well, I played back Bloody Roar 4. Heard of that game before? Here are some of the screenshots from the game.  [Pictures are taken from gameshot.com.] It's a very cool game, with sexy characters. Haha...

      Finally, I've sat my Additional Maths papers. It was tough. I prefered paper 2 more than paper 1. And I do realise that I don't like to take my exam paper in 3rd floor in the new wing. The atmosphere just isn't suitable for me to think properly. But, it was still nice there. I got to meet many teachers at the end of the day. And guess what, 2 girls were caught copying by Encik Nazri and they had to call their parents or something. I left quite early so I don't really know what happened to them in the end.  ~ Today's is my first day to a Japanese class. I was blur when I entered the class. There were 7 students all together, including me. 3 girls, 4 guys. The teacher was a guy, named Fujimori-san. He jokes a lot, and calls me Lee-san, which is weird to me. I prefer people calling me Chee Sheng or Kevin. Kevin is a bit weird to me too cause not many call me by that name, but nowadays people in my class call me Kevin, after a fella added me in Hi5. Anyway, back to the Japanese class, I learned the simple grammar and a few vocabs with some conversation today. It was cool. I hope I can master it soon. But for now, I should remember the katagana and hiragana first. Katagana is the simplified japanese words, whereas hiragana is the normal wordings. Katagana is mostly used for those english words translated into japanese. For example, television in jap is called te-re-bi. Weird huh?  Malaysia Mega Sale is on. I can't wait to go to KLCC this Friday, and Mid Valley this Saturday. Here's a list of the things I plan to get: 1) Slippers 2) T-Shirts 3) Cargo pants 4) Short pants 5) Polo tee 6) Tie 7) Underwear 8) Show 9) School-bag Haha, quite a lot huh. I didn't even think of the budget when I listed down them. Well, I don't think I can get all the stuff I want, I guess I'm able to get about 45% of them. Haha...

      Quite. For once, my predictions were 66.6% correct. Fahmy was good, but I thought those racists will vote for Keith. Anyway, 9 are in the finals now and out of the 9, 7 of them are guys. Weird huh, the odds of our first ever Malaysian Idol to represent us in World Idol most probably would be a guy. But Jac stands a very high chance too. She still sounds like Fantasia to me, though Fantasia is far more better than her.  ~ Finally I finished reading a 355 thick Science reference book after watching:   1) Guess   2) Fight Club   3) Who Will Win   4) Malaysian Idol Hopefully, I can touch on the tips he gave to us later.   So, I gotta go now. Sayonara!

      I had a dream yesterday. It was a pleasant and rather a non-frightening, sweet dream. Nevertheless, it's a good start for August. I can't remember the night I last dreamt. It must have been a few weeks already.  ~ Anyway, Beyonce is nominated for 5 MTV Video Music Awards!!! Some of the nominations include Best Female, Best Dance and Best R&B.   For you who have a STAR newpaper at home, feel free to turn to the last page under Education. Look at the picture and pay attention to the newspaper on the hands of the three judges at the left hand side. Familiar huh? yeap, it's Sri Garden News newspaper! We are one of the 50 newspapers that are chosen for the final judging. Hopefully, we can win something this year!
