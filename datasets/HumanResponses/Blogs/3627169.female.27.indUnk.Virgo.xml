      Thank you for the comments and e-mails.  I've been enjoying the messages, and have had a good time exchanging e-mails with you guys and girls. It really makes this fun when I get to make friends with new, adventurous people.  Please, thought, if you write to me, I only ask 2 things:  1) Be nice, not pushy and not rude 2) Don't ask my real name. I'm not your wife, I'm not your sister, I'm not going to tell you my name.  Other than that, let's have some fun!! :)

      It's late.  My husband is asleep, and I am so very lonely. I am so very, very lonely for the touch of a man, for the scent of a man, for the amazing feeling of a man next to me, on top of me, inside of me...  I slip out of bed, and tip-toe to the closet. I reach back, past my prim sweaters and blouses and dresses, to find it... The black skirt, the leather one that barely covers my ass. I slip off my wife panties and pull on my black thong, then step into the leather skirt. I exchange a black leather halter- the perfect mate of my skirt- for my night shirt, and step into my Manolo Blahnik stillettoes. I let my hair out of its ponytail, and brush it with long strokes, letting it spill over my shoulders and neck. A touch of red lipstick, and I am set. The transformation is complete.  The club is on the other side of town- nobody knows me in this place. I stride slowly through the crowd, trying to draw attention, and find my way to the bar. Some kid fresh out of college is tending bar, and I lean over the bar and wave to get his attention. He smiles at me, and hurries over. I try to pay for my Jack Daniels, but he waves the money away. I blow him a kiss.  On the dance floor a couple is standing, arguing. They're oblivious to all the motion surrounding them. Dancers spin and gyrate around them, but they just stand there arguing. Interesting. She's pretty, plump, and about his age, with short, dark hair and dark eyes. They're both younger than me by a few years, in their early twenties. He's gorgeous. His hair is closely cropped, and he's dressed nice in slacks and polished shoes and an expensive looking shirt. He's no punk. Finally, she pushes his shoulder and steps past him, headed for the Ladies' Room.  I leave my drink at the bar, and move towards him. He's still standing there, in a daze, and doesn't notice me until I'm right in front of him.  "You look sad," I say. "I hope it's not something I've done."  He's confused for a moment, and replies, "No, it's my girlfriend. We're just fighting about something stupid."  "My husband and I have the same kinds of arguments," I say. "I am so glad he's not here right now."  "Where is he?"  "Home, sleeping."  "What are you doing here?"  I smile, amused, and lean to him. I rest my arm on his shoulder and whisper in his ear, "I'm looking for somebody to fuck."  He laughs nervously for a moment, trying to determine if I'm joking. I'm not.  "I think you're very sexy," I whisper. "Why don't you take me home?"  He blushes, and stammers, "I came with my girlfriend. I can't leave her here."  "Even better," I say. "Let's bring her along."  I tell him my name, and ask about them. He is Danny. She is Heather. They're engaged.  Heather arrives, looking none to happy to see me. Before any fun can happen, I need to get her on board.  "Hi, Heather," I begin. "I hope you don't mind me interfering, but I was just telling Danny to stop being so rude to you. If there's one thing that I've learned in my marriage, it's that no man should treat a woman that way."  She laughs, confused by relieved.  "Anyway," I continue, "Danny and I were just talking about going back to your apartment and having some drinks, then sorting out this whole mess. Are you ready?"  Heather nods, completely shocked. I put my arm around her and tell Danny we'll follow him in my car. She'll ride with me. "Time for the fun to start," I think to myself.  We settle into the car, and I compliment her outfit. She really does look hot. She's wearing jeans and a tank top. Her breasts are plump and firm, and she's got beautiful dark skin.  I question Heather about her relationship with Danny. It turns out they were fighting over one of his ex-girlfriends. She discovered he had been talking to the girl. "The problem," I tell her, "is that he's supposed to be jealous of you. We need to find a way to make HIM jealous."  As I talk, I make it a point to gesture with my hands a lot, occasionally patting her arm or thigh. I want her to get comfortable with my touch. She tenses the first few times, but seems to relax over time.  We arrive at their apartment, and Danny pours us all a drink. I push him into an easy chair in the corner, and settle on the couch next to Heather.  "Danny," I lecture, "you're not giving Heather the respect she needs. You're not giving her the affection she needs. She tells me you don't even kiss her properly anymore."  "What? I kiss fine," he protests.  I turn to Heather, and gently caress her cheek. "She's such a beautiful girl, Danny. You need to let her know that." I lean to her, close my eyes, and kiss her softly. Our lips part just a little, and the tips of our tongues brush against each other for almost a minue.  "That's how you kiss a beautiful girl, Danny."  Danny looks down, unsure of what to say. Heather is staring at me, obviously wondering what I plan to do. I guess there's no reason to delay. I kiss her again, pulling her to me, my arms around her back and shoulders. She returns my kiss, our tongues pressing together. My fingers dance along her shoulders and back, glorying in the touch of her bare skin. I kiss her her ear, and her shoulders. She leans back her head, to give me access to her neck. I nibble gently on her throat and bosom, and her breath quickens.  "Pay attention, Danny," I say. "I'm going to show you how to make love to a beautiful girl."  I reach for the bottom of Heather's top, and she lifts her arms without a word as I pull it over her head and toss it to the floor. She reclines on the couch, and I spread her legs. She hooks her left leg over the back of the sofa, and the other hangs onto the floor.  I begin with her stomach. I taste every inch of her torso, breathing in her sweet perfume, loving the texture of her warm dark skin. I nibble lightly on her breasts, small painless bites. She caresses my neck and shoulders and back, and runs her hands through my hair. I tease her nipple with my tongue, then take it into my mouth. I suck each nipple gently but firmly. She gasps with each suck, loving the sensation.  I trace my way back, and kiss her stomach while I open her jeans. She raises her hips to let me pull them off of her, and I do. Her panties are cute, small and black and silk. I take her hand, and slip it into the front of them. She closes her eyes, and begins to touch herself while I massage and kiss her thighs. She's lost in the pleasure, rocking against her fingers.  I glance at Danny, who is leaning back in the chair and rubbing his erection through his slacks.  "She's beautiful, Danny. She's a beautiful sexy girl who just needs the right attention."  Heather's fingers make a wet sound as she rubs her clitoris, and the pace of her rocking increases.  "Watch, Danny. She's going to have an orgasm without you. She's going to cum, Danny, and she didn't need you to help."  Just then, Heather climaxes, letting out a low moan as her back arches... I reach for her wrist, and slowly pull her hand from her panties. It is very wet, and I slip her fingers into my mouth, savoring the scent and flavor of her orgasm. She raises her legs to slip the soaked panties off, and I lay her hand back between them.  I stand, as she begins to masturbate again, and stand in front of Danny. He's still rubbing himself through the fabric of his slacks.  I step out of my heels, and remove my halter and skirt, so I'm standing in front of him in just a black thong. I glance back at Heather. She's lost in her own world, having orgasm after orgasm as she masturbates on the sofa.  "Stand up," I bark at Danny. "I'm going to teach you the right way to make love to a woman. I'm going to teach you how to fuck."  He stands, and I order him to undress. He throws his clothes on the chair, and instinctively begins to stroke his hard cock.  "Stop that, Danny. That's not for you, it's for Heather." I lead him by the hand to the sofa. I bend over and kiss her on the cheek. "Come on, cutie. Danny has something for you."  She opens her eyes, and looks at him hungrily, like a wild animal who hasn't eaten in days. I help her to her feet, and guide her toward him. He wobbles on unsteady legs, but manages to embrace him in a kiss. His erection is pressing against her stomach, her breasts smashed against his chest.  They look at me, not sure how to proceed. I tell them both to kneel, then I help Heather recline on the floor. She is so beautiful, so sexy stretched out in front of me. I want to make love to her for hours, I want to taste every atom of her body, but I hold back. This is Danny's treat.  "Go on, Danny," I say. "Explore her. She's so sexy. Learn every inch of her body."  I lie back on the couch and watch them. He licks and nibbles on her calves and thighs while she touches herself. He massages the muscles in her legs, before finally lowering himself to her wetness. He goes down on her, and she reacts instantly. She must be so sensitive, after nearly a dozen orgasms. I slip out of my thong, and begin to caress my nude breasts and stomach and pelvis. He attacks her clitoris with complete abandon. His face is wet. She cums, and cums again, wave after wave of orgasm engulfing her. I reach between my legs, and find myself very wet, my labia swollen with desire.  Danny looks at me, unable to think for himself. He is soaked with her sweet, wet perfume. "Make love to her, Danny," I say. "Fuck her, but slowly. Savor her. She's so beautiful."  Danny rises between her legs, hovering over her, then enters her slowly, bit by bit. Heather moans softly, spreading herself wide to receive him. He thrusts in a slow rhythm, and she pulls her knees toward her shoulders, opening herself for him. They are gorgeous. Her, beneath him, legs clenched, breasts swollen and aroused, eyes closed, mouth open, gasping with each thrust of his cock, her fingertips digging into his back, pulling him into her. Him, inside her, his wonderful young ass tight as he pushes himself inside her. Sweat covering their bodies. Lost in each other. Lost in the desire.  Their fucking intensifies, quickening. Danny is on the brink of orgasm. I am wet and overcome with arousal. I am going to cum, but not this way. Not alone.  I stumble off the sofa and crawl to them. I kneel beside Danny, and bend to his back. I kiss it gently, then kiss his buttocks. Then, wanting him, needing him, I bite him roughly on the ass. He moves more quickly, fucking, fucking, fucking Heather. I wrap my arms around his waist, and pull him, forcing him away from her. He tumbles to the floor, and I take his place between her legs. Heather grabs the back of my head, and pulls me to her wetness. I devour her, pressing tongue and lips against her sweet, wet clitoris.   She screams. "Ohhhhh, yessss, ohhhhhhhh."  Danny is behind me now, He seizes my hips in his hands, and quickly, roughly forces himself inside me. Such a great cock, so big and so hard. I move in rhythm with his thrusts, raising my ass and hips to meet his push, while Heather bucks and moans beneath me. This is Heaven. This, the taste of a beautiful girl on my wet lips and the cock of a gorgeous young man inside me, is Heaven. My breasts bump against the floor, and it hurts, but I love it.  Heather's body rocks with ecstasy and she struggles for breath. Danny fucks me, faster, faster, faster, and I can tell he's going to cum. "Yes, baby, fuck me. Cum for me, Danny, cum for me!"  He thrusts again, pulling me onto his cock with all his strength, and his body shakes as my orgasm meets his. His hot cum fills me, and covers my pussy and thighs and runs down my leg.  We collapse, the three of us, naked and spent and covered in sweat and semen, and sleep until morning...

      I have never been to a strip club. Sorry, I forgot, "gentleman's club".  I drive past two of them on my way to and from work each day, and I've been thinking about them a lot.  I wish I had the nerve to take my husband to one of those places. He's been to them before, but I think he would die if he knew I wanted to go.  I would love to see his face as a beautiful, sexy young girl dances for me. I would love to get his reaction as she rubs her wonderful nude body over me.  Then, I would love to make him watch as I kiss her right on the mouth...  Curiosity. It's something, isn't it?

      I sit on the edge of the tub as the water pours from the faucet. I close my eyes and let the steam surround me, as I think about what happened earlier today. I can still see you, your muscles shining in the sun, covered in perspiration as you worked in your yard. I can still see your smile when I waved to you and called my hello, and of course you waved back.  What were you thinking then? Were you just being friendly to your neighbor? Were you just being courteous to another man's wife? Or was there something else behind that smile?  In my soul I want to think that you smiled because you saw me looking at you, because even across the street you could sense the desire in my eyes, and because you wanted me like I want you...  I turn the knob to shut off the water, and slip out of my robe. I light a candle and set it on the shelf next to the tub. Its sweet smell washes over me, the smell of flowers, the smell of Springtime. I step slowly into the hot bath, easing myself into the steaming tub of water, and lie back. The water brushes against my ears and my neck, wetting my hair which floats on the surface, some of it clinging to the skin of my shoulders and breasts.  I close my eyes. You are there, in my mind, in my heart, in my flesh. The warm water relaxes me, and my knees fall against eithe side of the tub. It soothes my back and my stomach and my thighs, and they loosen and tension escapes. I wish you were here.  I wish you were here, or I were there. I can still see you pushing the lawn mower up the hill, your legs straining against the weight of the machine, your back tight. I can still see the sweat covering your magnificent chest and arms. If only I could have given you myself, let you dry yourself on my body, let your muscles work with mine, in rhythm, in delicate rhytm and harmony, to bring us both to ecstasy.  My hips begin to move, almost involuntarily, slowly twisting from side to side under the water. There's something between them, between my legs, that's crying out for attention. My clitoris is aroused, and a bit sore from the warmth of the water, so I use just one fingertip to gently caress it. Yes, yes, that's nice. Gentle and nice, the way I imagine your hands would be on my naked body. Your hands, so strong, moving me to suit your needs, holding me while you give yourself to me.   Yes, yes, that's wonderful, that's sweet, this gentle sensation in between my legs. I raise and lower myself in steady rhythm, pressing against my hand, wishing it were your mouth tasting me, bringing me such pleasure. My first orgasm is a gentle one, soft as a schoolboy's kiss, pleasurable and lovely, but it doesn't satisfy my desire, it intensifies it.  I squeeze my thighs together against my hand, wanting more than just my fingers, wanting you, wanting you deep inside of me... My breasts rise and fall with the motion of my hips, my erect nipples rising from the water like twin goddesses of desire. I squeeze one breast roughly, my hand a poor subsitute for your mouth, wishing you were here to suck on it and taste its warmth.  It must be the temperature of the water, it must be the steamy air, but I gasp, struggling to breathe. I explore my body with one hand, while the other pushes inside me, pushing into the hotness, pushing where your cock should be. Yes, yes, yes, your cock should be inside me, pushing in farther and farther until I am about to fall apart, your cock reaching all the way inside me as I tighten myself against it.  It is almost real. I can almost feel you inside me, making love to me with your wonderful cock, my legs clamped around you, my fingers digging into your back, pulling you into me, letting you have me, letting you make love to me, letting you fuck me...  Water splashes over the sides of the tub as I work towards another orgasm, needing it, needing to cum, fucking myself with my hand, needing relief, needing you...

      I finally got to watch the Tony Awards.  My husband had no interest in watching them when they aired. Thank God for TIVO.  Thank God also for this piece of man-flesh:

      I suppose I should warn you, I will likely only post on this blog when I need to. By that I mean when I am most desperate. When I am full of the desire to be a dirty girl. This isn't all the time. Not even most of the time. It is enough of the time, though, to make this blog necessary. I don't know if anybody will ever read it. I don't know if those who do read it will enjoy it. I hope so. But really, I want to be a whore and this is as close as I will come to that.  All day I have had dick on my mind. At church today (yes I go to church with my husband every Sunday) I couldn't quit thinking about how cool it would be to turn to the guy next to me, when it was time for the handshake of peace, and instead of saying "Peace be with you", just lean in and whisper "I want to swallow your cock." This is how my mind works. I'm supposed to be filled with the Lord's grace and I'm thinking about getting fucked by a complete stranger in church.  He was an older gentleman. Pleasant enough looking, but not unusually handsome. Just an average, well-kept guy in probably his early 40s. His wife and son were with him. My husband was with me. Oh, my sick mind...  As we all sat and listened to Father J, I wanted to just rest my hand on his leg and gently caress his thigh. I wonder how he would have reacted to that... I like to think he would have set his hand on top of mine, and guided it in between his legs, to his penis. To his hardening penis. While his wife stared into the distance, bored, and my husband tried desperately to stay awake, I would have gently rubbed the man's cock through the fabric of his trousers until he couldn't take any more. I would stop before he could cum, leaving him frustrated and aroused and wanting me... I reach into his pocket and slip a small piece of paper with my cell phone number.  After church, just moments after I walk into our house, my cell phone rings. It's him.  "I need you, now. Meet me at the church in 10 minutes."  I tell my husband I have to run to the grocery store, and hurry out to my car. Once behind the wheel, I slip my panties off and stash them beneath the seat.  He is waiting for me in the parking lot, and without a word he motions for me to follow him. We drive for a few minutes, to the park near my house. I pull up next to him and step out of the car. He pulls me to him, roughly, and kisses me. I can feel his hardness pressing against my stomach.  "Are you some kind of slut?" he growls.  I can barely speak. "Yes, I am your whore."  He puts his hands on my shoulders, and shoves me to the ground. I kneel on the asphalt between our cars, and quickly unbuckle his belt. He is so big, so hard. I kiss his erect cock through the white cotton of his briefs, then pull them down to expose his cock. I kiss its tip, and he shudders. I slowly take him into my mouth, all of him, slowly, slowly, slowly.  "Suck me, you slut," he growls, and I do. I begin to go down on him, faster, I gently cup his balls in one hand, squeezing slightly as I let his wonderful cock fuck my mouth. My free hand reaches down between my legs, touching my wetness. I press my fingertips against my clitoris while I suck his cock. I am so wet, I need him inside me, I can't live if he doesn't fuck me, I need him to fuck me now... now... NOW!  I pull away, shaking with desire and fear. "Fuck me, please fuck me!"  He grabs the back of my head by the hair, pulls me to my feet, and spins me around. He forces me to lean against my car, bent over. He lifts my dress, and presses his hard cock against me, agains my ass, teasing me.  "Please, fuck me," I beg...  He puts the tip of his erection against my wet lips, then pulls away... Again, touching me with his hard cock, then he pulls away...  "Oh please just fuck me, FUCK ME!" I croak, my body shaking.  Then, in one thrust, he pounds inside me with his cock. It hurts, it's so big and he is so rough, but I need it. "Yes, that's good, fuck me!"  He pulls my hair, pulling my head back as he pounds into me, fucking me with his big magnificent cock. I brace myself against the side of my car, my breasts bouncing against the window. I am so wet, he slides easily in and out, despite the size of his cock.  I can feel it starting. My ass tightens, it starts at my ass and my legs clench together. It's like electricity running from my thighs, through my ass and up my spine. My body shakes, and I let out a low moan, trying not to scream. I bite my hand to stifle the noise, as wave after wave flows through me, my body in convulsions as I cum, this incredible orgasm as he fucks me fucks me fucks me fucks me, oh yes he fucks me so hard, yes, fucks me fucks me and I can't help it any more, "Oh god yes," I scream, "You are so fucking good, fuck me with that cock!"  He moans in response, and as I come down from the orgasm, he pulls out and I hear him groan as he shoots his cum, his wonderful hot cum, all over my ass and my thighs and my back. Oh, I love to feel his hot cum on my skin, on my ass....  When he is finished, he grabs my shoulder and pulls me around to face him.  "You're a dirty slut," he says, and slaps my face. He buttons up his pants, buckles his belt, and drives away...

      Call me Ivana.  I am a 27 year old happily married woman. I love my husband and he loves me.  This blog isn't about that. It's about the other part of me. The part nobody ever sees, not even my husband. My fantasies.  I am a good girl. Always have been. I was a virgin until I was 20 years old. I have only slept with one man besides my husband and that was after dating for almost a year in college. I am not a slut.  But I want to be.  I want to be a dirty fucking slut. I want to have sex with strangers. Strange men. Strange women. Groups of men. Groups of women. Groups of men and women. I want to be a slut.  Call me Ivana.
