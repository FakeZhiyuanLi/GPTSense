      I always thought of myself as an easy, outgoing, conscious, passive, lighthearted, funny kinda guy. I never imagined that, deep inside me, I had such strong feelings of hate towards another individual. I may use to term loosely, I hate this, I hate that. But in truth I only meant that I disliked it. And never though, had I thought that I actually feel so strongly towards another, one who I despise so greatly that I have often thought of snapping and beating the shit out of him.   Hate, such a disgusting word, one that can only be described as the root of all evil. I am ashamed, even appalled, that I could harbor such feelings. And I wish to apologize for my feelings, but I can't help how I feel, and I can't change how I feel either. What I can do is try to live, and reason through my disgust for another.   I'm not openly mean towards this person, this infectious disease that has violated my existence. Nor am I nice, I am indiffered to his presence, I hardly even speak to him. But it is scary, I hate him for the exact qualities that I find present in myself. I make up excuses, ones that separate him from me, but in truth he and I are alike.   I despise his laziness, that fucking leech, one who can't hold a steady job, one who just sucks and sucks and sucks money without ever giving back in return. I hate that mother fucking lazy prick. I despise him.  I can't stay that I wish him dead, I would never, could never, wish death upon anyone, no matter what mistakes they have made in the past.  But I know that I am just like him in regards to his actions, in more ways than one, he works harder, much harder than me, in fact I am much more lazy than he is, but in differnt ways. But I still can't forgive that fucking lazy prick. He works hard, has done so much for the property that I live on, but I can't forgive him. I hate him...  But with everyone, I will encouter others I can not stand, ones who I can not bare to even stand in a close proximity with. It is just another difficult aspect of live that I sometimes feels is too overwhelming.  And as with everyone, it feels much better when I am able to express how I feel. Even if no one visits my sight.

      I have been working pretty hard, making some good money. Looks like I will be getting back wednesday night around 7 or 8 p.m. I can't wait. I don't want to spent my summer working. I havnt even had one day to sleep in yet. Today I had to go on some service calls and go under some decks to help service the spa's that wern't working. There are so many fucking spiders down there... I hate spiders.   It's only 3p.m, only 2 more hours of work and I am off for today, then only two more days and I am back. I can't wait to be back home. It's nice seeing my dad, don't get me wrong, and I never thought I would say this but I miss Ukiah... Or maybe I just miss my friends. I'm hoping to get a job with Grant on friday, sat, and sunday. That will be fun and I will be that much closer towards my car.  And one more thing I think I should add. JESUS CHRIST is fucking blazing down here. It is so fucking hot I think I'm gona have a heat stroke. It is only 94 and I know it will get a lot hotter later in the summer, and even hotter up in Ukiah. I hate the heat I just fucking hate it!

      Today is my first day off, but It doesn't even feel like summer. I had to wake up pretty early this morning and go down to Novato to work with my dad. I will be spending the next few days with him. I'm really happy to work, I need the money, but it sucks that I have to start work the first day off from school. I didn't even get to sleep in which is a drag, but I like working with my dad. It's fun, even if he trys to cheat me out of pay.  I did a lot of grunt type jobs today, mostly cleaning. My foot as still been really bothering me, but I took some advil to help control the pain and now it isn't so bad. It may hurt, but I don't regret jumping off the roof. Its about time I started to live my life doing stupid shit instead of sheltered in my house watching t.v. and playing computer games like I have spent so many summers before this.

      After I got home from school I went over to Grant's and I chilled with him and Tony. It was pretty fun, but they wanted me to get onto the roof. I'm... Let's just say that I am not fond of heights. But after being persuaded and helped, I got on the room and just chilled with Tony and Grant, watching North state street and 101. It was fun, but of course, how could I go ontop of a roof without jumping off? Its a given, if your on a roof, you jump off. There were only two sides to jump off and Grant wanted me to jump off the one that he jumps off of.   And fucking A, it is a pretty high jump. Now... I'm no measuring expert, but I will say it was atleast 15 feet high (I think, maybe even more). When I landed my foot bent in and I collasped instead of being graceful and now I'm walking around limping. It didn't hurt horribly bad when it first happened, or afterwards when I went bike riding and jumping on the trampaline, but now that I'm sitting here walking around the house without any shoes on instead its killin me. First I fuck up  my arm, back and chest, now my foot.  It feels fucking great to be alive

      Nothing that great happened today. I had a lot of fun at school and I got the last laugh between me and a friend of mine. We always used to fuck around and say "You wanna go?" and then we would slap the top of eachothers head, well today I walked through my math class while he was in there as a TA and I hit him and I ran back all the way to my bio class with him right on me. I made it inside before he could get me, and he left. When my teacher let me out he was right outside and he got me. After awhile I got him back and then I spent the rest of the day dogging him. I had to run through some classes and through the A building. It was a lot of fun.  Last night I experianced something amazing. The experiance left me feeling alive, more so than ever before and I don't think that I will ever enjoy a feeling like the one I felt last night. I can't exactly go into what happened last night, but I will just tell you I'm still hurting from it. I think I fucking cracked my sternum, but it was totally worth it.
