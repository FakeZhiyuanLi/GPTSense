      I must say that writing a blog is very liberating.  I felt so good to have some kind of outlet, besides music, to express my inner thoughts.  I don't know if this will go anywhere, but I know I'm gonna have fun with it.  It's my time to shine...  On the music front...      I was just bumpin' the new Writer's Block album and I must say that it's more than I expected.  Not to say I thought it was gonna suck, but DAMN, it's got some tight production on there, courtesy of KeyKool, Rhettmatic, Mum's The Word and some new cat I haven't even heard called Omid.  The two songs he did, Sunset Limited and Situations, are SICK!!!  I would definitely keep an eye on this kid.  He got fire.       I've been findin' myself keepin' it old school lately, so I've been listenin' to A Tribe Called Quest a lot.  To those that don't know, do the knowledge.  And to those that DO know and ask what album was their best, I got two words for you...Midnight Marauders.  From beginning to end, classic.  'Nuff said...      Also, check out Time Machine's "Slow Your Roll", one of my nominee's for album of the year, no doubt.  They take the old funkiness of early nineties Hip Hop and make it sound new.  Not too  many cats can do that.  I met them at one of their shows not long ago and they are some of the coolest muthafuckas I ever met.  They are definitely holdin' it down.      Speakin' of classic material, if you find ANYTHING by my man J-Zone, buy it.  Don't even second guess yourself.  But especially make sure you cop "Pimps Don't Pay Taxes."  Life changin' stuff... He is one of the most original dudes I've heard in a minute.      I got some other heat, but that's comin' later...  On the gamin' front...      I've been playin' Prince Of Persia (again), and Metroid Prime (again).  I can't wait for their respective sequels in November.  Speakin' of which, is it just me or is this gonna be THE MOST craziest year for games.  Let me break it down for ya...besides the two titles I just mentioned: Metal Gear Solid 3, Halo 2, Gran Turismo 4, Ratchet And Clank 3, Doom 3 (XBox), T.H.U.G. 2, KOTOR 2, Half-Life 2 (eventually), and not to mention the ton of quality games that are out now that I don't even know when I'll get to play.  So little time...  On the romance tip...(maybe)      I work in an environment where I'm constantly on the phone with people.  But today I spoke with someone that was special.  Her name is Giselle and she is one of the sweetest girls I've spoken with in a while.  I've never met her in person, but I've seen her before and WOW.  She literally took my breath away when I saw her.  She is that beautiful.  I had to place an order with her company and I got the lucky chance of speakin' with her and she is something else.  I just tried to make small talk with her and we started to talk about other things.  It was cool the way she let me joke around with her, too.  Maybe she speaks like that with others during the day, but we spoke for a good while and she is mad cool.  I'm not sayin' this is going anywhere, but only time will tell and I must say that I'd be a fool not to try.  I was gonna ask her to lunch on Monday, but I thought maybe she would think I was bein' pushy.       I must admit that it is a breath of fresh air to meet a girl that is so beautiful physically, but yet isn't so conceited or thinks she's the shit and feels that she is too good to talk to someone.  And when I say beautiful, I mean model beautiful.  No joke.  Like I told my friend, there are probably some girls that I might find attractive, but he won't like 'em and vice versa.  But this is a girl that definitely would turn ANY guy's head.  On a scale of 1 to 10, she's 25.  I was tryin' to find out if she had a man, but I couldn't get the goods.  My gut tells me no, but maybe that's just what I'm HOPING for.       Wish me luck...  One last thing...      If ANYBODY reads this, I'll be at Elements here in L.A. (Hollywood, to be exact) on Sunday.  For those that don't know, it's a Hip Hop club that goes down the 1st and 3rd Sunday of the month.  Anyway, I don't know what I'll be wearin', but most likely look for a San Diego Charger throwback jersey with #21 on it (my man L.T.!!!).  If for some reason someone reads this and just HAPPENS to be there, keep an eye out for me and say what's up.  It's my birthday the next day, but I won't be able to party then, so I gotta do it this weekend.  Lord help me... Hold ya heads and PEACE...

      Hello...and welcome to my blog (obviously). I hope this is the start of somethin' special that will change some things in my life as I am in a state of transition (more on that later). This is somewhat new to me and I will try to be as entertaining as possible. I am not computer illiterate, but I am also not completely computer savvy, but I know enough to get by on. I will (hopefully) add some new type of content later, like a moblog, audio links stuff like that for you guys if you want to get a peek at my life and what makes me tick (if anybody out there cares...). My name is Ricardo, but mostly everybody I know calls me Rick or Ricky (I prefer Rick). I am a true Hip Hop head. I mention this because it is truly a lifestyle. KRS-One said it best, "Rap is somethin' you do, Hip Hop is somethin' you live." And that is what it all comes down to. I truly love this art form and to me there is no more beautiful music in the world than Hip Hop. Sometimes I may take it too far, but throughout my life, Hip Hop has always been there for me when I felt I had nothin' else. I try to spread this to others, and while the numbers have been small, I know that many people I know have come to know and love Hip Hop the way that I do. That explains my title (one of my nicknames, so don't bite it). It's a play on words. I'm Ill AND Informed. But I'm also ill informed, get it? I know everything, yet I know nothing. Wasn't that line from a movie? Dunno... And I guess, in a way, that is why I wanted to start this little project. Not just for me to let my thoughts and feelings out, but to speak to everyone out there and maybe meet some like minds that understand. I know you're out there... I don't want to blow my load on the first day, so I will cut it short for now and save the rest for what I hope will be many days to come. It will be a slow process, but I hope to meet as many of you as possible and I promise I will read any e-mails you send my way. Hold ya heads and I will return to burn...Peace   " I wrote the shortest jazz poem ever heard.  Nothin' about huggin' or kissin'.  Just one word...

           I finally finished my jury duty today.  The trial went pretty smooth and it was done quicker than I expected.  I can go back to work now and get things in order.  From what I hear, they needed me around the office.  The good thing is that I don't dread goin' to work like with my previous job.  I actually have fun during the day, so it's not so bad.       I went to see Lexicon last night and they rocked it.  The other 2 acts I saw were wack and I really wasn't feelin' it.  I got the lucky chance to meet Lexicon and from the Fantastic 4our I met C-Minus, who was DJin' in Cheapshot's spot.  They were all cool peeps.  I don't know of any upcomin' shows goin' down, so things are pretty mellow right now.  I'm sure somethin' will come up though.  Wait, now that I remember, there's a festival goin' down in San Diego next weekend w/ A Tribe Called Quest, Dilated and some other cool acts.  Too bad it's in S.D.  If I had the time I would drive down there, especially to see Tribe.  I've never seen them in show, so that would be somethin' else to see some livin' legends like that.       If anybody got info on shows in the L.A. area, pass the word on.  Straight up Hip Hop shows, though.  I like my shit commercial-free, if you feel me...      I'm out like Shout...Peace        "On these 73 keys of ivory and ebony/I swear solemnly/that I'll forever rock steadily"   -Black Thought of The Roots "100 % Dundee"

      Hey everyone, (well...really just me) I haven't had time to post anything cuz I've been away on jury duty these last couple of days. We (meaning the jury) should get the case sometime tomorrow, so I hope to be back at work and school by Friday. I'll give the details of the case when it's over... If anyone happens to read this (or really even cares) I'm probably headed down to the Key Club in Hollywood to go check out Lexicon tonight. If anybody's interested, doors open @ 9 pm and the cover is $10. Not a bad deal if u ask me... Come up and say WHUT UP!!! I don't think anybody's even readin' this. Anyway, I gotta run, but like always take it easy and hold ya heads. Peace...

           Hello people, wherever you may be... Today is (was) my birthday and it was nothing special...Just went to work, then to school, then to dinner, then back to school, and now I'm here expressin' my sorrow.       Now, normally I don't make a big deal about my birthday, but this year I kinda wanted somethin' special to happen.  I guess I feel low cuz this is my first birthday since me and my ex broke up.  She at least called me to say hello, but that was it.  She actually just left me a voicemail and it made me feel kinda bad.  I wish she would have at least called me in person and spoken with me to say it, but whatever... I guess it's the thought that counts.  Anyway, there's always next year...      On a lighter note, I was at ELEMENTS yesterday and it was aiight.  My homeboy C-Los from Stacks vinyl was there and we chilled for a second.  He spun a dope set and got the party started.  He threw on "Quiet Storm" and you knew the shit was gonna hit the fan.  Needless to say, the place went bananas.  The b-boys (and b-girls) set it off on the dancefloor and showed the crowd real Hip Hop still lives in L.A.      I met a couple of these cuties dancin' and DAMN they were cool.  I still remember their names...Wendy and Michiko (I think that's how you spell it).  Michiko is Phillipino and normally I don't go for girls that ain't Latin, but I had to admit that homegirl was kinda fly.  Her friend Wendy was the one that caught my eye earlier that night, and dammit if she didn't flip me out when I saw her start breakin'.  Girl was ill.  My boy Los was rappin' wit one chick and I saw Michiko by herself.  I started a lil convo and took off from there.  She was cool and we talked for a bit.  No flames between me and her, but I swear that Wendy was givin' me the eye, but she was there wit this dude, but I couldn't tell if they were together.  I might see her somewhere else later... Wendy, I got my eye on you, girl.      Anyway,  I just noticed it's 10 pm and I gotta check out Time Machine radio, so I'm out like Shout.  Remember, hold ya holds.  I will return to burn... Peace.

      What up, peeps? It's ya man back in the house! Seriously, hello. I had a pretty uneventful weekend, and DAMN I'm depressed. I thought somethin' would come up, but it was not to be. Anyway, I did cop some new heat at Stacks today... The new Masta Ace is in stores, and all I got to say is run out and get it. Fan or non-fan, you got to hear it, it's pretty slammin'. It's worth it just for 9th Wonder's beat alone, but runner-up for best track on the LP was "Soda & Soap" produced by my man DJ Spinna. DAMN that beat is hot!!! Anyway, cop that there, it's a dope album. I also got that new 7L &amp; Esoteric, but I haven't heard it all yet. I peeped it at the store and what I heard was pretty good. Truth be told, I saw my main man J-Zone had a track on there and I had to get it, but there was some other heat on there, but I'll report on that when I hear the rest of the LP. B4 I go, I want to let y'all know that goin' down at Naga's in Long Beach is my two personal favorite DJ's, J-Rocc and Melo-D of the Beat Junkies on Wednesday the 25th. There'll be some other acts, but I'm gonna go see my boys spin. I met J-Rocc once, but I really didn't talk to him, but I talked to Melo-D a few weeks ago and he's a REAL cool brotha (and he represents the Latinos). If anybody's got the time, do yourself a favor and CHECK THEM OUT! I guarantee you they'll both rock the hell out da party and you won't be disappointed. I gotta jet, but I will be back. Hold ya heads... Peace      GO PADRES!!! (Even though they lost today...)        J-Zone: Yo, Celph, you better think twice before firin' that cannon, man      Celph Titled: I always do, Zone.
