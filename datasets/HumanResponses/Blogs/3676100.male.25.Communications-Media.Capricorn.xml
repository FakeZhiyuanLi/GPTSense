      Today I am faced with a moral dilemma that most people would ignore.  In today's society, there seems to be an ever-expanding region between what is right and wrong.  The gray areas are expanding, and soon will cover the complete spectrum of morality.  I feel that celebrities are in no position to force their views and followers to vote for a certain political party.  Yesterday I received an e-mail from one of my favorite artists, the  urlLink Dave Matthews Band , announcing that the band would be playing at a John Kerry benefit at Radio City Music Hall in New York City.  If you have been reading my previous posts, you are aware that I am an avid conservative supporter, and a firm supporter of  urlLink President George W. Bush .  Hence, my dilemma arises.  What should I do?  Is it wrong to support someone who leads others in the opposite direction?  Hopefully if you are reading this, you understand my concern. What gives a celebrity any more political expertise than the common working man?

      I have been completely turned off to the liberal media lately.  It seems that everywhere you turn, there is someone blasting the conservative government leaders.  The majority of news sources are bent on getting the Bush administration out of the White House.  Here's my question.  If Bush had known ahead of time about the severity of the 9/11 attacks, and he went in and completely leveled the mountains of Afghanistan, would how would the media react?  Why is it that we blame the government for being both  proactive  and  inactive ?  I was watching Michael Moore on  urlLink The Late Show with David Letterman  and I was blown away at the amount of rank propaganda that was spewing out of his mouth.  Even someone as liberal as Dave Letterman was shocked at the view of Moore's "documentary" on Bush's response to the 9/11 attacks.   urlLink Bill O'Reilly  says it best in his weekly news column, " urlLink The Evolution of Michael Moore ,"   Any skilled filmmaker, and Moore is that, could fashion a movie making any American look like a pinhead. That's easy to do. Just get a bunch of video, some people who hate the guy, some factoids that may or may not be true, heat it up with sardonic rhetoric and serve. Presto, Fahrenheit 9/11.   I do not understand how Moore can be considered a documentary film-maker.  In order to be categorized as a documentary, a film  "must present facts objectively without editorializing or inserting fictional matter."   Mr. Moore has publicly admitted to presenting information in a bias manner, and in doing so he has taken all creditablity away from his liberal film."

      I found a guitar that I want on e-bay.  (I'm not really a big e-bay fan, but you can find some really neat stuff on there...)    It is the  urlLink Martin DM3MD  Dave Matthews Signature edition.  Too bad its selling for over five grand.  I've got some big dreams, like getting my pilot license and building a  urlLink Titan T-51  Mustang replica.    "But rushing around seems what’s wrong with the world Don’t lose the dreams inside your head They’ll only be there til you’re dead Dream..."  ---Dave Matthews Band - You Never Know   Sometimes its hard to take things one step at a time.  I'm still working on finishing up some elective hours for my Bachelor's Degree.  As of now, I'm 26 hours away from having a Bachelors in Organizational Management from Tusculum College.  My goal is to have them completed and graduate in December.  Well, to sum up, I guess its time to start working towards something.  Stop fluttering through life and come up with some dreams, and work toward accomplishing those dreams...

       "Celebrate we will, for life is short but sweet for certain..."   Monday was the first full day of summer.  I can't believe how quickly time slips away.  It brings to mind how precious life is.  It seems that I spend most of my time angry or upset about someone not being fair, or doing things correctly.  It seems that we spend most of our lives stressing about things we cannot change.

      Just received news from  urlLink CNN  E-mail Newswire...   -- Al Arabiya TV: Al Qaeda militants behead U.S. hostage Paul Johnson. CNN working to confirm.   I am utterly confused by the terrorist mentality.  I understand that we are democratic and they hate everything we represent.  However, I will never comprehend how their mind works.  How on earth can you not see that we are making every attempt to rebuild their country for them?  How lazy can they be?  They have people willing to rebuild their broken country, but kill them for their help?   "They have no shame, not a shred of decency, and no mercy. America will hunt down the killers, one by one, and destroy them."   - Vice President, Dick Cheney   I pray each day for President George W. Bush.  The media is out to get him and his team of government leaders.  President Bush has had to deal with more garbage than any president in the last 20 years.  I just wish people would realize how much he has done for this country, and how harmful the liberal leadership has been in the distruction and demoralization of this great nation.

      I have been challenged.  My  urlLink wife  created a blog yesterday, and challenged me to do participate also.  So, this is my first blog.  Everything is well.  I've got a couple of new  urlLink DMB  songs that i'm listening to right now.  Life is good.

      OK, so it's hit me lately. What am I going to do with my life? I'm almost finished with my bachelor's degree in Business, so what's next? Do I want to continue my current path to become a technician, or do I want to try to make it as a business executive, sitting behind a desk for the rest of my life? I guess the question is, which path will provide the best outcome for my family? I know that I will never reach my professional potential where I am currently working...  In other news, the Democratic convention finished up last night. I have learned that I am not cut out for politics. Every time I watch something about the presidential election I end up more and more frustrated. I get so angry at both the liberal and conservatives. It seems like they spend more time criticizing each other than working on solutions and furthering the country.  that's about all I've got for today... Hopefully our house will sell this weekend so that I can have a little more to write about next week.

      Do I live a boring life or what?&nbsp; I haven't had anything to write about in two weeks?&nbsp; Well, maybe I've had things to write about, but no time.&nbsp; Its hard to sit down during a busy day and find something to write about on the spur of the moment.&nbsp; Maybe I should start writing things down when they come to mind.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Anyway... Lots of stuff in the news...  urlLink Martha Stewart  goes to jail for 5 months, Shaq goes to Miami, Lance climbs the standings in France, and wildfire&nbsp;is taking over the Western United States.&nbsp;&nbsp; It isn't like there is a lack of topics to discuss... &nbsp;  On a more personal note, I am 23 hours away from having my  Bachelor of Science in Organizational Business Management  from&nbsp; urlLink Tusculum College .&nbsp; I should be&nbsp;finishing up around December - just in time to receive my diploma.&nbsp; I am heavily considering studying for my  urlLink MCSE  Certifications starting at the beginning of next year.&nbsp; Hopefully by this time next year I'll be a  urlLink Microsoft  Certified Professional.&nbsp; &nbsp;  That's it for this week... Tomorrow is Saturday, and I'm sure I'll have a full day of work at home.&nbsp;

      I was listening to the radio this morning, and something hit me that was quite interesting.  Someone mentioned on the radio that it is impossible to live the perfect life.  The idea of having the ideal parents, going to the right school, meeting the right mate, getting the right job, finding the right retirement... is all wishful thinking.  Is this true?  Is life just a game of chance?  I am so undeserving of my current situation.  I have the greatest  urlLink wife  in the world, and each day I love her more.  It doesn't get any better than my parents and sister, and I am healthy for the most part.  All of the important aspects of my life are covered, and none of it can be attributed to anything I have done.  The more I think about it, the less reason I have to complain about anything.  So the moral is, don't take anything for granted.  We never know what tomorrow holds.  Love like you've never loved before, and have as much fun as you can!  What's holding you back?

      It is somewhat difficult to find something to write about every day of the week.  That may be why I have not posted in a while.  Not a lot has happened...  My  urlLink wife  and I painted the cabinets, and are getting ready to hang cabinet doors tonight... FUN STUFF!

       What if God Shuffled By?  I recently had the opportunity to have lunch with a friend from several years ago. It isn't that he hasn't been around, but life has just consumed all of our time - his time is now taken up by a wife and two children, and mine by my  urlLink wonderful wife  and my job. While at lunch, I found that we still had a lot in common.  We met in church, and still go to the same church. We had a very interesting discussion about what it means to be a Christian, and what God really expects out of us as human beings. I feel that the church in general has such a distorted view of what God wants to do in and around us. I feel that a lot of the time people try to "do Christian things" -  such as go to church, not drink, not smoke, do the do's, don't do the don't's...  I am so tired of people telling you how to live, how to do things... God isn't about that. Jesus never prayed for us to be separated from the world... In fact, he did quite the opposite. He prayed for us to be in the world. He wanted us to spend time with the dirtiest, smelliest people on the face of the earth.  I was surprised to see that I wasn't the only person who had the same theological view. I have thought for so long that I had some distorted view of reality, but on the contrary... I am beginning to see that maybe my view isn't so wrong after all.

      Well, what an eventful week! I have had the last two days off of work, and today is Friday, so it seems like it is dragging on forever and ever. I had the opportunity to attend the  urlLink Dave Matthews Band  concert in Nashville on Wednesday. Having been to the last two DMB concerts at the Starwood Amphitheathre, I have to say that I was disappointed by this year's performance. However, I still feel that the show was definitely worth the drive. I may post a review a little later.  We sold our home on Tuesday, and we got more than asking price! We've done everything we can to get the house sold in the last few weeks, so this is definitely taking some stress off of  urlLink my wife  and I. Our agent has done an incredible job with our home.  In other news, it seems as though more and more performers are throwing their two cents into the media, pushing to oust  urlLink President Bush  out of the White House. So far, there has been a "Rock the Vote," and a "Concert for Change" scheduled by performers who think they should persuade people to vote for their favorite politician. Quite honestly, I'm extremely tired of everyone telling us for whom we should vote. It is my belief that we be told where each candidate stands on the issues, and the history of that candidate's political actions. Let the public decide who they want, don't try to make them vote for someone they don't know.  That's it for today... Time to get back to the vigorous labor of fixing other people's problems...
