      If you have a need or just have a desire to have a machine hosting multiple operating systems and use either Windows 2000 or XP as your main operating system then you should definitely take a look at  urlLink Microsoft Virtual PC 2004 . Basically, this allows you to create Virtual Machines having virtual hard-drives that can host 'guest' operating systems.  This means that you can for example run Windows 98 and 2000 on an XP Pro machine without having to go through the pain of partitioning the hard-drive and installing the Operating Systems in the correct order.  I've installed and use it often and have to say it is definitely worth it's $129 so go and have a play with the 45 day trial, I don't think you will regret it.

      And here's why:       More often than not, a CD is cheaper or at most only £1 more expensive.  How come?  Why are on-line purchases so expensive, material costs are virtually zero?  As an example, Thin Lizzy - Live &amp; Dangerous - £9.95 on Napster, £7.99 for the CD at Amazon.co.uk.     You can pretty much play a CD on any damn CD player you choose, you can't do the same for your DRM protected download.     The quality of music from a CD is better because the downloaded music is compressed using a lossy algorithm.     You can - usually - rip your CD to mp3, wma, ogg or whatever you fancy and again play the non-DRM'd rip wherever you please.    After my experience with Napster, (I was unable to restore music I had purchased because it was no longer available on their catalogue) I shall never ever again purchase downloadable music, instead I shall always buy the CD at least for as long as they continue making them.

      Welcome to my blog. On these pages I hope to pontificate, rant, rave and generally have a good time sharing with you my thoughts, feelings, discoveries and lessons about life, the universe and a lot of other things. I hope you enjoy what I write, but if not feel free to do whatever floats your boat and leave me in peace, but if you really must tell me how crap my prose is, then go ahead, that is why I have decided to enable comments on all my postings.    Right now I am listening to the Police (Greatest Hits) and being dragged back to my youth oh so many moons ago. I am stunned at how good they were, it is only a pity that at the time I was (or thought I was) a 'rocker' and sadly the Police just did not fit into that genre. Still, they remind me of those alcohol-free teenage discos at the youth centre in my home town of Thetford in Norfolk and I smile, it's only a pity that I never realized how good those days really were. That's not to say that days are not good now, just different, with two wonderful kids to take care of, days just cannot be so carefree again.     For now, sleep calls.
