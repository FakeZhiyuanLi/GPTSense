KAYTI- i have to apoligize to you the most, i have lied to you and i never wanted to do that, your a great person and you should have better. thats why i'm telling you if you havent already, to get over me, i'm not worth it... you knew from the begining and i kept telling you different, i met you through Ben, and i dont regret it either, i just never wanted a relationship... i was just a horney teen male and i'm here to say sorry. i did talk to Jamie and i can understand if you never want to talk to me again, i do care about you and i hope we can be friends.  ALLEGRA- your kayti's friend and i never meant to drag you into anything, i'm sorry for using you for my own gain. this was wrong and i hope your not made. you were a friend when i needed you and i never returned the favor so this is me saying i'm sorry. your suck a cool person, you say that yu have problems but just look at me, i got a whole lot of little ones. so i hope that we can still be friends, i'll be here if you need any help.  JORDAN- your a great friend we kinda drifted away since you moved and i feel like an ass for not talking to you much, i want you to know that no matter what i'm here if you need to talk and dont worry if i'm away talk anyways, i wont get that mad, lol. i hope we can get together soon your a great friend and... i dont know what else to say, your the best. if i ever hurt you... sorry and if i ever do hurt you... sorry in advance. you will never lose me as a bestfriend.  DEAN- i know for a fact that i'm an ass to you, and i'm sorry. its just something i do its nothing personal. you've been my best friend for as long as i can remember so never change. your cool in your own sense, like i'm a loser in mine. i can tell you anything knowing you wont make fun of me, your great and i know i will never lose you as a friend.  JEREMY- your a great guy and you always know what to say to cheer me up. even though a times i feel like killing you, just becasue you get all the girls. but you know thats a good thing, i just hope you dont become like your dad. you know hes a nice guy, hes trying to set a good example for you... you should look up too him, not hate him. you say that hes an ass, an that may be true. he loves you and i know that you love him. just get along for your moms sake. and for kims, bens, and mine, we dont want you to leave for the rest of teh summer. peace man.  KIM- your may friend and i dont want to lose what we have, i know i can be an ass, and i'm sorry. i never ment to hurt you (if i did) plus you've helped me so much that i need to give something back... i dont know what yet, but i'll find something. nothing will change how i feel towards you, your a great friend... i cant give you any advice because 1. its not my place to say anything. and 2. you dont need it your perfect in every way. to us in the future, friends.  BEN- man for some reason i dont know what its is but your still my friend. i treat you like dirt sometimes, i treat everyone at pine lake like dirt, and i'm sorry. please forgive me, i know i have been an ass, and i know that i will fix things sooner or later. your a great person and you can do whatever you want. disregaurd my feelings toward anyone,if there your friend i'll deal with it, because your mine. and i know you would do the same for me. Anti-God! you got me into that, and i started to listen to Cradle Of Filth. and all those other bands because of you, thanks for everything.  ALYSSA- you've changed me for the better. i've started to read and write... i'm going to learn how to play an insterment.... i hope. you just gave me a great perspective on life. as i said out at the lake befor you left, i like you. i have for many years. i never realized it till i saw you after so many years... you make me want to be happy. if i've ever been rude to you i didnt mean it. and if i ever am rude to you i'm sorry. i just want to say a few more things to you, i hurt to find out you liked Jeremy, (dont get mad at him for telling me) [i kinda already knew{because you look at him the same way i look at you}] your perfect, and i dont want you to ever change. i feel like a whole new person when i'm around you. the reason i was acting weird out at pine lake, was becasue i liked you, and knowing that you liked Jeremy and not me kinda made me mad. but i know i will never be with you, your too good for me, and i'm not really your type, (from what i've seen). i just thought you should know. your an awsome friend.  NICOLE- i did like you in grade 10, but i never knew you liked me. thats why i never did anything about it. knowing that you still like me after 2 years is kinda weird but i can deal with it. i just feel really bad for Phil because he is my bestfriend. i also know what hes going though, haveing a girl he liked, like someone else. its hard an it hurts, but knowing Phil hes a strong individual. he will make it though. just give him some time and he'll come around.... i hope. but i would like to talk to you more, so you will always be my friend.  TYRA- your so great... and to let you know i do like you. your a friend and i'm happy for you and dustine. i cant write much right now so. sorry in advace to anything i do thats stupid and immature, which is everything.. lol. sorry and have a happy life. if things go your way or if they dont i'll be here. your a great friend.  All of you may not want to talk to me because i have prolly lied to you some time or another, but if you still want to be friends it would make me so happy, i want to help anyone in need. i'm always here for anyone that need to let things go. i would like to talk to you all more in person if you have any questions. you ask anything anytime and i will try so hard to answer them. your all my friends and i love you all to the depths of my heart, i hope all can be forgivin. i may sound like a faggot but thats the risk i'm willing to take. if anyone has any questions dont be afraid to ask, i'll try to give an answer.

      i just found out that i prolly messed things up with both the girls i like... and some how i still feel like killing myself. i like Jen yet, i cant ever have her... and Jones she great also.... we fit together so perfectly that is scares me, i found out that i totaly fucked thinks up with Jones so... yeah lifes a bitch, some days i want to die more then others.... Jones will not take me back and for some reason i'm happy because i dont want to hurt her anymore then i already have. if we did date i cant see it going anywhere... shes the kinda girl i like, she doenst do shit out of hornyness, she does stuff out of love, or so says her friend. and because i am a teenage guy, thats not so good for a short relationship... and as for a long relationship... i'm in grade 12 i need to start thinking about my future and what i'm doing in life, wasting 3-13 months on a relationship is not what i'm looking for.. yet Jones makes me so happy thati wouldnt at all mind just being with her, if i could actually see this becomeing something big i wouldnt be so scared. knowing that she has other guys after her hurts a bit, but knowing that i cant hurt her anymore is kinda nice... but not being with her hurts... life is so confusing, why cant i just like one girl... but i guess everything happens for a reason. if she takes me back the yay, and if she doesnt then thats okay too. thinking about Jen hurts because i know that Jones wouldnt like me tinkning about another girl... so its all up to her.  ttfn Cody

      Once Agian i will try this thing out.  some how i feel no need to live, i want to die... some of it is stress and some of it is girls (why girls? i dont know just because) i tryed twice in the past week, one was over a girl (once again, god damn why over a girl?). it is that Jen person i was talking about earlier... she just so great and knowing i cant have her make a part of me die over and over agian... i could never have her.. i dont know if this feeling will ever go away. but prolly the main reason that i want to die is stress to do good in life, every parent puts it on their child... mine seems more then others, all my uncles, Aunts, Cousins, Parents, and even my own Brother gave up on school, they never went to collage or university, yet all of them count on me to make something out of my life... everyting is up to me now. i dont think i can take it anymore. stress is such a big part of my life now that i dont know what to do without it... its weird, i use it as a scapgoat whenever something goes wrong.. when in fact it may not be stress. it helps me through hard times and even through easy times... i cant really think strait at all anymore. some part of wants to die, but another part of me wants to live... to see what i do, do with my life and see if i could really get Jen. life just is so messed up right now i dont know what to do... i could just end my life right now and be over with all the stress and everything. but then i think of who i would hurt if i died... i have 4 really great friends and of course my parents... plus all the other people that care about me, like Jen would she really care, or just think "oh well, too bad" and move on like she never knew me? Everyone out at pine like might be sad... but also maybe not. talking about killing yourself kinda makes you think... why do i want to die... but once you think about that you think "why do i want to live" and they both have their pro's and con's. its an evenly balanced scale "should i or shouldnt i?". i've been talking to my friends resently and they keep saying the same things... "dont just think about yourself... you think killing yourself over a few things would b best?..." like really you dont know what i'm going through and what kinda stress (theres that scapgoat again) i'm under. i know a few people that would gladly kill me, no because the dont like me.. but because they know the feeling, the feeling of being alone, of not living up to your parents standerds, of not living up to anyones standerds.. not even yours. everyone you talk to about killing yourself will tell you not to, with good reason... but sometimes you cant see their reasoning. and some how you still want to, eveything just doesnt add up in my head. i also just realized another reason i would want to die, "thinking about others befor yourself" i've been doing that for ???? i dont know how many years but its just getting to me.... making them happy befor me? why... that makes no point in you excistance then to make your self unhappy and others happy?, you just never know who will leave or who will care.. thats why i'm going to hold back for a while, hoping someone can show me the meaning of life.  ttfn Cody

      God, my friend told me about this and told me to try it out.... so here we go. I'll just start from about a week ago, just so i dont ramble... i will anyways, lol.  I went camping at pine lake about 10 days ago, me and my family go up there alot, just to relax and do a bit of golfing (yes i golf, i would say i'm pretty good at it.) but for some reason the past 10 days, for me, wern't very relaxing... befor i left i had feelings for this one girl i met out there about 5 weeks ago, but after about 3 days of being away from her (we were dating) i began to think about life and what i would be missing out on if i stayed with her. Also the frist day i was up there i met this other girl.... i've known her for about 5 years now, shes a great person... and of course i like her, i never really realized it till i saw her again, she made me forget totaly about the first girl... (i know thats bad, god i hate myself). So i've like this one girl for 5 years.. and i dont get to see her often, i dont even get to talk to her often. I prolly see her once a year for about 10 day... lol. so yeah she was up there for the most part of 10 days, and i couldnt help but.... i dont know, really, really like her. I introduced her to one of my other friends that was up there at the time, and we hungout for the day. we woke up the next day (saterday, july 24, 2004) at around 5:30 a.m. (long story, cut short [ Jeremy {other friend up there at the time} and I were hanging out with this girl and security came by and kicked us out, so we had to go back to our trailers, then the security gaurd mentioned "why dont you guys wake up at 5:30 a.m. because we cant do anything aout that" so sure enough we did] and thats the story) anyways, we woke up and hung out that morning. i started to notice that she liked Jeremy and it was hard to deal with, but hey i might have been wrong. So since i thought that she liked him and not me i felt pretty shitty, once we had to go back to our trailers, i hung out with my uncle and hes a great guy... he gave me alcohol!, yeah... i got drunk that night trying to forget everything.... i had about 11 beers, and for someone that doesnt drink i think thats aalot... i was wasted, but i can still remember the night, so i wasnt that drunk. I woke up at around 1:30 p.m. the next day with a bit of a hangover, got together with the one girl (lets call her Jen), so i got together with Jen and Jeremy that day and yeah it was becoming more and more aparent that she liked him.... to skip ahead a few days, i think it was Tuesday August 3, 2004. Jen told me to tell one of her friends that was playing pool at the time that they needed something for supper, so i left Jeremy and Jen alone... of course i knew that there were going to talk about her liking him, hes a nice guy (he knew that i liked her) and of course she talked about cheating on her b/f (yes she has a b/f) with him, once i got back i told him i was going to get something to eat and he came with me. He told me all about what they talked about (well not all but some). the next day i didnt feel like waking up at 5:30 a.m. so they came and got me at around 8:00 a.m. instead. later that day when Jen went to eat lunch Jeremy was talking to me and told me what had happend well i was asleep (hes a true friend) he told me that she came onto him and he didnt do anything (of course i wasnt there so i dont know what really happend) but he said "I was laying on my bed with my eyes closed and she began to run her finger along my lips, then i opened my eyes and she smiled at me and bit her bottom lip, i told her that i couldnt, and she said " you dont have to touch me" and i said i still couldnt" so he went up and had a shower. then i came and yeah.. you know nothing else happend. this kinda hurt me inside knowning that he could have her and i couldnt... but no matter wha i still couldnt have her. I'm not her "type" or so i think, plus we've been friends too long that she would never look at me in that way. i just dont ever see it working between us, she so perfect and i'm just there.... she sings and she extreamly beautiful... and talented and everything... shes got the best personality and just... eveything, i'm just a bum, and she could do way better. i dont know what to do.... i cant stop liking her and yet i dont want to stop. very confusing for me..... (i sound like a chick here, lol) just knowing that i cant have her makes me insane. yeah.... once talking to the first one (call her Jones) talking to her after 10 made me start thinking again.... how i really like her also, but now i know i messed thinks up so i should get over it..... anyways, i'll prolly put in another addition today but thats enough about this topic  ttfn, Cody

      change is a good thing Right????? if it is then why doesnt anyone want me to change? i think its for the best... you its better for me. i found someone that has inspired me to change... well theresmore then one, but yeah. i feel like learning how to read and write properly. and i want to learn how to play an insterment... a hobby that wont get me into to much troble...lol. right know i'm reading a good book, fiction... called Diablo. lol, lame i know but its interesting. soon i will try to get into bigger and better boooks but right now i think this will do, its about 300 pages... i'll be done in about 3 months (lol). i'm learning how to write... as you can see, i started this because i want to change and i feel the need to. peoplehave been so nice to me in the past i just think people should know how i feel. i'm going to try runnning every morning befor work and befor school... to get into shape. i might start working out in a gym after school, (when it starts). but for some reason i dont want it to come. i love seeing my friends that dont go to my school and i never want to forget them. once school starts i wont have time for anything... trying to get good grades and studing hard. i want to make a good life formyself. everyone knows what i mean. so if i dont talk to you dont ever forget that i love you all. dont ever forget me, talk to me sed e-mails... anything to keep intouch.  ttfn Cody

      One thing that i noticed, is that my mood changes alot. when i get an idea in my head it just wont leave, well thats untill i sleep... i love sleep. sleeping helps me alot in life, i just forget everthing well i'm asleep. when anything goes wrong in my life i just sleep on it and the next morn i feel much better, i find out what to do, and i'm not as stressed as i usually am. but if i feel really crappy one night, and i so stupid things, i will sleep then the next morn i'm like WOW what i just do that for. i kinda kick myself... but whats done is done. sometimes i wish i could go to bed at like 7:00 p.m. just beccause then i dont have to put up with doing anything stupid. man what an idiot i can be.  i have to work like everday this week, and its going to be hell. work gets my mind off soemthings, but puts it on other problems. me and my co-worker (Luc) talk about what a shitty world we live in. we talk about his problems and mine, its great to get things off you chest... i've also noticed that you can never have one person to tell EVERYTHING to. well at least i havent found someone like that, prolly because i never show who i really am.. i want to but something always holds me back. some of the time its my parents, they dont want me dressing the way that i want because they already have one son they are not proud to be seen with. my brother totaly wrecked everything for me, he does drugs, is out of the house, has 2 kids (with 2 different girls), and has no job. my parents think that i will turn into him, when i wont. when ever i do something stupid the say that i'm my brother, this can get very... umm... pissy. but i think that i will try to find the person that i want to be... i havent ever been him, because i didnt want to disrespect me parents. i dont really know who i want to be... but i will find out soon, i hope. another thing is that i found out... i dont really think about anything, i realized this at work today. i dont think, i'm just here... nothing goes through my mind. And there i go rambling so i'll just stop for now  ttfn Cody

      I went out shopping with a good friend of mine today. shes great and has a good attitude... when around me. but yeah we went shopping and SHE never went to the stores I did.... i'm becoming a girl *shivers*. yeah i was more excited then she was, weird eh? a guy more excited about shopping? makes you wonder eh? but yeah i got some things like those "punk braclets" and a cap with a little pink flower on it.. lol. (god i might be gay) but i looked so weird walking home... i was wearing skater shoes, white jeans, white T-shirt, 2 "punk braclets" on the left arm, a gay braclet with them, 3 peices from a sink on my right hand, a pinky ring on the other hand, a chain neclace, big ass earphones, preppy "cool" sunglasses, and a backwards hat with a pink flower in it. thats weird... i just wear what is comfortable. yeah i'm going to look like a total fag, but i dont care.  ttfn Cody

      I found out today that one of my friends is so close to actually being me its scary. she thinks almost the exact same, and shes a great person all in all. shes everything anyone could look for in a girl... well at least me anyways. i found out that she wasnt really being herself... so i hope that nothing will change too much with her (shes talking about changeing too) wow were so alike. anyways off to another topic... i think i sacred one of my friends off witht this whole blog thingy. i shouldnt talk so quick but... maybe i'm just afraid to hear from her (i gave her the blog link... and yeah i dont want to really know what her reaction is to what i've been saying) so far everyone that has read it is giving me positive feed back, so maybe i'm just over thinking things like i always do anyways...  ttfn Cody

      After talking to ppl and listening to their problems.. even reading them. its seems like my life is a cake-walk... they make my problems seem minimal. but to me my life sucks! the thing that gets me the most is how i have like the nicest parents in the world yet... i dont like them, well its not that i dont like them its the way i was brought up. it seems to me that my parents are so hard on me... yet their really not, compared to some ppls parents. but everyone sees their parents as being tough on them. i wouldnt even think about giving up my parents for someone elses. it would suck, but knowing that other ppl have it worse then me makes me think... why am i complaining, and it comes to me......... its human nature. there are so many things that can go under that heading. like; watching someone get hurt, or talking behind someones back, or finding the easy way out... there are so many things that ppl do and dont even know it. but lately i havent really had any problems besides the ones with a certain someone i would not like to mention. but even others they dont seem like the person they really are. its really werid and it makes you wonder if everyone is like that.... keeping the real them inside and showing what ppl want to see. i know for one thing, I did it... not proud of it but i did. i'm trying to show me... not what ppl want me to be. but i'm at a crossroads i want to show the "real me" yet i dont know the real me... i've been hiding for so many years.  ttfn Cody

      i've noticed everyone id out to make an easy buck... even me. why is that? i got a raise today from $8/hour to $9/hour... but yet i'm still not happy. when i started i was all like yeah 8 bucks... but once i found out that my brother started at $10/hour doing the same damn thing... it kinda got to me, he was a lazy ass that didnt do anything... i'm better then him at my job, my boss and co-workeres tell me so... yet i'm still getting less then he started at. again why is that?  But also i've noticed that everyone is in a rush... no one takes the time to do something properly. even my boss, he rushed this one job and fucked it right to hell.. all the mesurements are wrong. and even me doing simple around the house things... yesterday i had to cut the lawn, i had nothing to do all day so of course i did it. but i tried to do it so fast that when i was done i'm like why the hell did i go so fast. i had nothing to do yet i still rushed it. its like that one country song goes "in a hurry to get things do alot. rushin', rushin' till lifes no fun. all i got to do is live and die but i'm in a hurry and dont know why." this is so true to amost everyone i talk to... they have no reason to do things so fast. i think is human nature again. what is with the human race?  ttfn Cody
