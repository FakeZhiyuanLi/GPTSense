      I just saw the A&E Biography about Bill "Bojangles" Robinson.  He coined the term "Copasetic" which means "something that is good."  He onces said about Henry LeTang, "That boy's staging is copasetic."   The documentary had many interviews from Fayard Nicholas and Gregory Hines, two people who were an impact on Henry LeTang's life.   There were many great film clips of Bill Robinson dancing, espeically the scene where Darryl F. Zanuck (big time Hollywood Producer) took out the scene because they had to shortin' the movie.  It was Bill Robinson's great tap dance solo and Zanuck took it out, after promising Bill Robinson that he was going to help shape the world by using Bill Robinson as the guiding light.  Of course that was a bunch of bullshit.  In the A&E biography, they showed the deleted scene and even though it was only a minute long, it was a great minute.   Also in the documentary was a clip of the Nicholas Brothers.  MAN, OH, MAN!  They are soooooo freakin' GOOD!  I HAVE to put that clip in the documentary.  There were these HUGE steps, I mean HUGE!  One of the Nicholas Brothers jumped onto the steps, but jumped and landed while doing the splits.  Then, the other Nicholas Brother jumps OVER him and lands on the steps, again, landing while doing the splits.  They did this about 4 times.  AMAZING!  I tell you, AMAZING!   Henry did meet Bill Robinson and I'm sure Henry has lots of stories with this man before he died in  on November 25th 1949 at the age of 71.  Henry was 34 years old at the time.

      Today I went over to Jackie's mom's house and talked to her about Henry's birthday video and the documentary.   She let me borrow lots of video tapes of  Gregory Hines  tap dancing,  Buster Brown ,  Jimmy Slyde, Savion Glover , and  Fred Astire .  I really liked the Tap Special hosted by  Gregory Hines .  He does an incredible solo and it also features Savion Glover when he was 15 yrs old!  But a great moment was when the legends of Tap ( Bunny Briggs, Buster Brown, Jimmy Slyde , and  Sandman Sims ) including Gregory Hines come together and each do a solo.   What a great moment.  SO FREAKIN' TITE!  Pam (Jackie's mom) also let me borrow the "Dancer" magazine featuring  Henry LeTang ,  Gregory Hines , and  Fayard Nicholas  on the cover with Henry holding an award for Educator of the Year.  There is a WONDERFUL picture in the article where Henry is sitting on the piano looking over his shoulder at Gregory Hines as he talks about how brilliant and wonderful Henry is.    NOTE: get that footage and put it in the documentary!  A MUST!!!!!   Since these are my thoughts and I'm writing this so I can remember.... I need to get interviews with  Jimmy Slyde !  He's a GREAT tap dancer.  His style is original and i should really use the TAP Special for archival footage to insert in the documentary.  Also, I need to get an interview with  Savion Glover .  Remember that he's really shy and reserved especially after  Gregory Hines  past away.  He was a father figure to him and he's been devastated since.  I still have to watch more tapes like Fred Astire and find the one when the cast of TAP comes on to the Phil Donahue show!!!
