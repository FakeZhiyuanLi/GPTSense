        We looked out at the sky  Full of dark gray clouds  They seemed to follow us   They opened up  The rail fell  So hard   You held me tight  Never to let go  I held you back   I hope you understand  That just cause a cloud follows us  Doesn’t mean we aren’t meant to be   So I pray that you see  That we are supposed to be  Not just me  But you and me

        You hate me  And I love you  Isn’t there something wrong with this?  Shouldn’t we both love or both hate?  But I couldn’t hate you  I could only love you   The fact that all this happened  we used to be so happy  But now I’m so sad  I wonder how you feel  I know you’re over me  But can’t you give me another try  I know I messed up  But things change people don’t you wonder if this has changed me   And it’s not the fact that I love you  It’s the fact that I do  I always have  Since I met you  Probably before that  I haven’t ever wanted anyone like I want you   I’m lost in your eyes  In your smile  In your voice  In your body  Lost in you  I am lost within  Lost within the love I have for you  And the hate you have for me   I don’t know anymore  But it’s times like these that you learn how to live  And learn how to fix the mistakes you make  But this mistake is unfixable   Unreliable, I am  Untrustworthy, I am  Unforgiving, I am  Unbelieving, I am  Loving, I am  Caring, I am  But one thing I’m not, I’m not for you  I won’t ever be  will I  I’m just not good enough

         You know I used to not be able to stop thinking about you  Nevertheless, today I rarely notice your presence in my mind  Just because I have finally given up on you  I used to always think to myself maybe ill get back with him  Now I know I cannot have you  You have now gotten over me  I say I do not feel for you any more  However, it is not true  I will always love you  However, I will try to let you lead your own life  I just want you to be happy  With or without me

        I thought I didn’t like you  Then you started talking about her  And I realized that I did  You said that when I kissed you  That I sucked  And that she was better  Now that I told you that I like you  You come up with a real clever comeback  In the back of my head I like you  But in the front I like her  So I don’t know what to do  I don’t know whom I like  Then you came up with some stupider thing  You want to know how I feel inside  I do like you  But not as much as I used to  Everything you did either was good or it hurt me  And I responded well  I like you Mikel get used to it.

        A tear rolled down my cheek  You looked at me and said you were sorry  and, I didn’t know what else to say then it wasn’t your fault  But it was  You were the one that cheated on me  You leaned closer and I looked up at you  And told you to get away  I got up and ran  And kept running  I couldn’t stop  I didn’t want to remember the good times we had for there were no bad  I don’t know what to do but cry and say  It wasn’t me it was you  I know it was  So, don’t blame this on me  Don’t tell me its all my fault  Cuz its not  It was you  I sucked up my tears and looked you in the eye  And told you  That it was you  You were the one that messed this up  Now you know  I won’t ever cry for you  Ever again

        Walking down my street like I do everyday, kicking the rocks so they get out of my way, thinking of what life would be like if I still had you, you know I say I go on these walks to loose weight, but I really go on them to think, I think about everything ive done wrong in my life, every lie that I’ve told, and I come home more depressed then I left, I feel as if the world is on my shoulders, weighing me down, and every time I take a step someone falls off the earth, and something bad goes wrong in my life, if only time could turn back, and I could be a good kid, re-take the steps I took with a smile on my face and frown in my back pocket, I still wonder what it’d be like if I wouldn’t have messed up in my life and if you and me wouldn’t have ever happened, but you know, sadly enough I cant go back in time, and I cant do good what I did bad, so I’ll walk the streets of my home town thinking about what life could or would be like.

        I look in the mirror each morning and I truly hate what I see, its just me, I want to be more to myself then just me, I used to be so interesting, used to be happy, but now I’m just me, I guess being myself is a good thing, but why’d I have to be me, I could’ve been a supermodel that travels all around the world, I could’ve been a 10 year old genius, but no I’m just me, as you can see I’m really not all that satisfied with myself, but you know, at least I’m someone, right.

        5-26-2004   The color in your eyes starts to become cloudy as you hold my hands and plant your feet, this must be important  You start to tell me about how much you love me and how long we’ve been together, 4 years, 2 months, 14 days to be exact  So were standing in the middle of this deserted parking lot your spilling your heart out to me and I just don’t feel right, are you lying to me  A sullen silence comes over us, you look me in the eye and a faint tear rolls down your face, I didn’t know what to do, I took a step closer, held you hands tighter its ok you can tell me anything  I love you more than anything is what you said as you let go of my right hand, reached into your pocket of your favorite blue jeans  A gun Came out with your hand, I immediately backed away what’s going on, the last words you said to me tell everyone I’m going to a worse place, you tried to kiss me good bye as you put the gun to your forehead and screamed I love you  Boom, I cried I knew I couldn’t of stopped you but why’d you have to do it here why now, why  I love you that’s all I have of your voice  I love you, I love you, and I love you too  I walked to my red Chevy truck that you helped me buy  I got in and saw our picture taped on my dashboard from the first time we went fishing you sitting behind me kissing my cheek as I smiled at the camera  And I cried.

        My bodies getting dreary as I stare into your eyes, your telling me that we cant be together any longer. You’ve found someone who meets your needs to a standard, and that if I love you I will understand. Left there speechless, I started to cry, I let go of your hands and turned around to walk away, I looked back for one last glance, and saw a tear coming from your cloudy gray eyes, and thought to myself maybe you miss me already, but I wiped it from my mind. I walked to my red Chevy truck, got in and ripped that picture of me and you off my dashboard, started the car and looked at the picture as I drove away, you were still standing there, coming up on the park, where we first met, I pulled over with a screeching of my tires and killing the clutch, I turned the truck off got out and slammed the door with the picture still in hand, I walked over to the swings where we had our first encounter, and I began to cry, once more. I sat on the swings with the picture in hand and thought about how much I did love you, and how much happier you’ll be and of course all I wanted was for you to be happy, but why couldn’t it be with me, I know that sounds conceded but I cant help it, I love you to death. I got up from the swings and started to slowly walk back to my truck, I got in and just sat there, I feel as if I cant go on much longer, but ill last another day. I start the car and start to drive home, unfortunately I have to drive by your house before I get to mine, so I took take the long way home, I pull into my drive way at about 8 at night, and my mom runs out and she is in tears, she looks me in the eyes and grabs my hands and leads me to her car, I get in and she takes me to the park, I looked at her and asked her why we had to come here, she said look, and I looked up and all I saw was you laying there on the ground, with a Police line Do not cross, surrounding your body, selfless, and dead, the gun not to far from your body, I didn’t know if I should cry or just stare, so I ran, I ran as far as I could, and I still haven’t stopped.

        They are in the car waiting at a stop light, three minutes is way to long to not be moving, were about 30 miles away, home sweet home, where both of their families live, they cant wait to visit, about 10 miles down the road, they stop at a gas station to get some gas and snacks for the next few miles, one girl walks in and looks at the food, and grabs some chips and a coke, the other girl pulls the car around and parks on the far right, she waits, gets out and walks to the automatic doors of the market place, they open silently, and she walks in, she looks at the food and grabs some Twinkies and a diet Pepsi, she walks up to the counter and her friend is there also, they check out and walk to the car, they hop in, and the girl with the chips starts to scarf down her food, when she realized the other girl is just looking at her food, she asks her, what are you doing, aren’t you hungry?, yes I’m starving she replies but I don’t want Twinkies and a diet Pepsi. So they head for the main road back to there trip home, and she still doesn’t eat, finally about 10 minutes away from there destination she gets out of the car and goes to the restroom at the Mile High rest stop, she takes her food with her, she walks into the bathroom, bright blue and smells like shit, she takes it step by step and gets to the trash can and throws her food away, she goes pee, and then comes out and washes her hands, she looks in the mirror, and looks at her body she doesn’t understand why she’s so fat, she walks out of the bathroom back to the car, and they get back on the road, they arrive home not to long from there, and there parents are over joyed to see them, the one girl walks to the restroom at home and looks at herself, opens the bathroom mirror, looks for pills, she starts to cry, but only a faint tear comes, she finds aspirin, opens the bottle, pours them on the floor, takes the cup next to the sink and fills it with water, sits down on the floor and starts taking them one by one, and then she got out the scissors from under the sink and within a span of 10 minutes she took her life 2 different ways, not only on the outside but on the inside as well, she hadn’t eaten in 27 days.

        My waters getting deeper, as I tell you more and more, How far you have to go, when there are people right here, Your really killin’ me, I love you so much, And he’s killin’ you from the outside in, how can’t you see, I know you can hear it, hear it in his voice,  The way he talks to you, I know you know, Now just realize it, you can’t just sit there, Cutting your wrists, that wont always be okay, You’ll have to grow up some time, just leave him there,  He’s not for you, your better then him, Stop sitting in the corner, and seeing your blood,  Sam I love you, and one day it will be too much, And you are going to be crying in that cold corner in your room, And you’ll take your life, with that knife, And cost yours and my lives, so please, just get rid of him.

         You ever liked someone so much,  But you knew you didn’t have a chance,  So you finally gave up,  You erased them from your life,  Even though you didn’t know them,  But you liked them so much.  &nbsp;  You ever cut for someone you liked so much,  But you knew it wouldn’t help,  And you continued,  Just to see the blood,  Cause it made you feel good inside.  &nbsp;  You ever wanted to shoot their partner so you have them,  That one that you liked so much,  Just shoot them dead,  So you can have them all to yourself,  Just to make you feel good,  Cause you liked them so much.  &nbsp;  I have.  &nbsp;  By: Jordan Ashley Barrows      Dedicated to: Christopher King, Matthew Walker

        I would do any thing to have you,  I don’t know what I’d do with out,  And yet i'm sitting here and were miles apart,  You’re always on my mind,  And it makes me untwine,  But what unscrews me is what you say about me,  Are you enjoying this?  The feeling I have inside,  Me i've just about died,  And trust me I have tried,  I’ve tried so hard,  But I, I feel like i’m inside out,  There’s nothing I can say to you,  That will make you feel the same,  And I know you meant what you said,  But now i’m dead,  With one shot to my head,  And the blood was shed,  My one wish, I wish I could have you.

      The wind blows through the trees and the shadow covers our bodies And we hear the music in the background, slowly fading, as we drift into each other Thinking of nothing but the love, that is felt Feeling nothing but the motion of each other  Feeling lifeless as I hear your voice on the other end, Almost scared as to be your next words, I know you’re ashamed, and I know you’re angry, This was my ultimate mistake  As I felt him kiss me, I knew it was wrong But all I wanted was you The smell of your skin and the taste of you tongue Never once was a kiss felt like this  The rain pours, as I walk myself home Tears streaming down my face, as I realize what I have done I know you’ll hate me, forever and more, This was my ultimate mistake  I hate the way you talk about me now, And I hate the way I can’t have you now, And I hate the way you forgot about me, And I hate the way I can’t forget you  But him, he, he was my ultimate mistake, And one day, hopefully you’ll forgive me, Because everyone makes mistakes, And this was my ultimate mistake,I’m sorry.

      And I broke the glass And I slit my wrist, Just inflicting pain I don’t want to die  I turn out my light, And I lay down to fall asleep, Into my nighmarest dreams,  With the wind blowing through my hair, And the stomping of your feet behind me, I can hear you coming, Faster and faster, im getting scared,  With things the way they were, And the way I want them In this nightmare, I will scream  I’m cutting my wrists, Once again, The blood is flowing like a summer stream, And I lay my head back,  I start to count back from one hundred and three.
