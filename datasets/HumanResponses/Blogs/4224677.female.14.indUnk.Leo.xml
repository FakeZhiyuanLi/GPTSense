       Me and John were bestfriends. Then we started going out. Which was a BIG mistake. Because I told him everything before. Even more than I told Alia or any of my other friends! Which is alot! And I really wanna be friends with him again. But I doubt that will happen because I sent him a big long letter telling him how much my life sucked after he dumped me. But the only reason why I wrote him that letter is because he dumped me on my b-day. But before we started going out... We hung out all the time. I told him everything about my relationships... And I sometimes even ditched my boyfriend to hang out with John! And I really miss doing that... We used to basically e-mail each other about everyday. The only thing we didn't do was call each other. Then we were hanging out at our 4th of July Parade. And we hung out that whole day and thats the day that I found out that he liked me. We went up to Amanda's Grampa's and went swimming and jumped on the trampaline. It was SO much fun! Then we went back to Amanda's house and hung out there for about 1 hour. We played video games and hung out in Amanda room. Then Amanda invited me and John to go to the Fireworks with them. And we ended up going. And me and John and Amanda were all cuddled up underneath a blanket watching the Fireworks. Then me and John ended up holding hands. Then the Fireworks were over and we all got in the car and John was in the middle of me and Amanda. Me and John ended up holding hands again and I almost fell asleep on his shoulder! I've loved John to death even when we were JUST friends. And then 2 days later (on the 5th) we started going out. That lasted 1 month and 4 days. But when we were just friends he also even made up a song about/for me! It was awesome!! lol But after we broke up we haven't e-mailed each other and we haven't talked to each other. Actually I called him to see why he broke up with me. But thats besides the point. Then a couple days later I heard that he went on 2 dates when he was down in Mass... While he was still going out with me... But, I aso did stuff with my friends brother... So I'm not gonna hold complain that much about that. The only thing that pissed me off was that he broke up with me on my b-day. But whatever... I really hope John see's this. And I really wanna be friends with you again. I'm sorry for whatever I did to have you brake up with me and go on 2 dates with a girl. But anyways i g2g. And I hope we become friends again and Luv ya!

       Eli is so cool!! lol I've liked Eli so much last year! It wasn't even funny!! The only thing that kept me back from him was Alia because she seriously asked him out everyday for me... And it really pissed him off.... But now I think I like him again. But this time I think I'm gonna go for him!! Because I've totally given up on younger guys!! lol But I heard from Richard that Eli liked me at the end of the year. So maybe I'll have a chance with him this year. And totally take him away from Krystal... Not to be mean or anything... But seriously... lol I WANT HIM AGAIN!!! lol HELP ME ANNIE AND NESSA!!!!! lol When you see this... Post a comment and also e-mail me!! got it?? I NEED HELP!!!! lol WHAT SHOULD I DO??? Well bye!

       Mike's so awesome. He's also John's bestfriend. But that ok. We were in the same class together when he 1st came to our school, when we had mixed classes. I always used to give him answers when we were in math class because he sat right next to me and when he didn't know an answer I wispered it to him! I did his homework for him basically. And also in social studies he copied my worksheets, that I copied off of Annie!! lol I make him cd's all the time too!! But now that I'm in high school and he's still in 8th grade we're prolly not gonna talk to each other very often. That and the fact that me and John aren't friends anymore. But.... I hope me and Mike stay as good of friends as we are now. Which isn't very close but he's awesome!! lol But he's not gonna have a fro anymore!! I liked his fro too!! lol But NO!!! He had to shave his head and say that he was never gonna have a fro again!! GRRRR!! lol But anyways LUV YA MIKE!!! hehe

       Megan is awesome! Now that we're friends again... We got in this really big fight on out e-mail. Because I wrote her this HUGE e-mail bitching her out because she went out with Herman not even a week after we broke up. And I was super pissed. So I decided to e-mail her and tell her off.. Well that went on for about 1 week and then we finally just quit and then about 1 week later I e-mailed her and basically said I was sorry and I'm totally over Herman and all this shit.... And she forgave me and then we became friends again. And now we're friends again!! lol But before all that happened we were really good friends. I went to her birthday party and hung out with her all the time. It was lots of fun! And I told her alot of stuff and she told me alot of things that she didn't tell anyone else. But now we're friends again and I hope it stays that way!! LYLAS!!

       Krystal.... She's cool... She's knows everything that happened between me and Herman... We were good friends at the end of last year but I haven't seen her all summer... I only saw her once and that was with Amanda. And we really didn't get to hang out much. But she left a scar on my forhead because she decided not to tell me to duck on the 4-wheeler and I ran into a branch!! It hurt SO much!! But I got over it. But no one else can forget it!! lol But the only thing I really don't like about Krystal right now is that she need to get over Eli. Sorry if you read this Krystal but you do! I'm just telling you the truth. But anyways i g2g lylas

       Meghan... She comes up every summer. Last summer we weren't really good friends until she knocked on my door and asked if I wanted to come down to the river and help her baby sit her little brother and his friend. I said sure! So ever sence that day of last summer we hung out. Then she had to go back to Washington State, where she lived. Then this summer she came up and we hung out basically everyday. I lived at her house and she sometimes lived at my house. But we tell each other everything. I've told her everything I've done. And she's told me everything she's done. As soon as she got up she called me and we were talking on the phone and the next day I went up to her house and we went swimming in the river! It was SO much fun! We had sand and mud fights!! I LOVE YOU!! lol But the thing about the sand and mud fights were that Carl was right there!! And he thought we were total freaks!! lol We'll... Not me but he thought Meghan was a total freak! Because this summer I found out that Carl liked me!! lol But ya know... I never ditched Meghan for Carl... We watched so many movie's together! And we watched so many movies together in Carl's room with Carl and his friends!! We played basketball together and went swimming together and hung out with Richard and John and Annie together! We have done so much stuff together... Well not like that but ya know!! lol jk She's my best friend besides Alia. And used to be John but not anymore. So she's like my 2nd bestfriend. I can also trust Meghan. If I tell her something that I don't want anyone else to know she won't tell anyone. This summer I just showed up at Meghan's and she didn't even know I was coming. When I got there I was crying and she came up to me and gave me a big hug. Then I told me mom and Paco I could stay and they drove away. She cheered me up and made me smile again then I called John and told him that I was grounded. Then right after we went to Pico Slides. And the next 3-4 days I stayed at Meghan's and stayed happy and got to do whatever I really wanted. Because then I was grounded and the only place I could go was up to Meghan's. But that's the only place I wanted to be! But this is why I love Meghan!!

       Amanda is also one of my bestfriends! When I cry I always have to call her or have her over to my house so I can STOP crying! Like when Herman broke up with me I had to have her over so I could stop crying and start laughing! That night she spent the night and I never started crying over Herman again! She's always backed me up. When I got in a fight with people she was always on my side even if they were her friend too. Like when I got in a fight with Megan Pratt over Herman. Amanda was on my side and not hers. This is why Amanda is 1 of my bestfriends! She's always been there for me and we're always gonna be friends. She even got my ears pierced for me! And we have SO many memories together! Crying, laughing, being bored, and shopping together!! We have basically the same circle of friends. But alot of our good friends are moving away! And we're gonna be sad together! Steph's moved to Randolph and Jeanelle is gonna be moving to Sharon and Alia moved to Florida... And prolly different people are gonna be moving away to. We always dance together and spend LOTS of time together and shop together and even swim together! We have SO many memories together. Good and bad... But anyways I hope me and Amanda stay bestfriends forever!

       I've had many awesome times with Jeanelle! One time I was over to her house with Amanda and we were all laughing SO hard and I started crying and I couldn't breath for like 1 min or more! And Jeanelle and Amanda started laughing at me! We were so hyper that night! But unfortunatly Jeanelle's moving to Sharon. Which isn't that far away but it still really sux! She knows alot about me and I know alot about her. And basically everyday like a week before school ended I borrowed a skirt from her! Because I actually fit into her clothes! When I'm with her we laugh so much! She stayed at my house for like 3 days in a row once! And I usually invite her to the movies with me! We've made up so much stuff! Like before we get outa high school we're gonna make out with someone with pop-rocks in our mouths!! lol I've had so many great times with her and none of them include crying! But we have the same taste in guys, clothes, and guys!! lol But every summer she goes to Alaska and we all miss her bunches! But I'm not gonna be able to see her that often now because she's moving! And it really sux! But at least she's not moving outa the state! But This is why Jeanelle is 1 of my bestfriends!! LYLAS!!!

       Annie!! She's awesome. She's always been my bestfriend! From like 4th grade and up! I know everything about her!! What her home life is like, who she likes, who likes her, who doesn't like her, her family, her horse... I could name so many other things! And she knows all that and more about me! I know she's been in a fight with Alia like everyday of last year but they love each other to death! I also know Annie HATES wearing dresses and skirts and make-up!!!! lol But I love her for that! The only thing I hate about Annie's life is that in the summer she works EVERYDAY and in the winter she works on the weekend. It bugs me because she never spends anytime with her friends! Especially me!! lol But a couple of days ago she took off a day of work to go shopping and she invited me to go with her! Because she knows I missed her!! But I love Annie so much! But this year we have no classes together and thats gonna suck because last year we had so many good memories together!! Like that time Mr.Chadwick seporated us... But at the same table with NO ONE inbetween us! So we still kept laughing and talking but he never noticed!! That was a great day! But anyways there isn't much more to say! So I g2g!  LYLAS!

      NESSA I LOVE YOU!!! Nessa is 1 of my bestfriends! She's awesome!! She laughs with me and she cries with me! And she always listens to me! I love her to death! And I hope nothing ever comes between our friendship! At first we weren't really friends, then we came closer and she used to come over to my house all the time when we were younger. Then I went into 6th grade and she was still in 5th grade... So we got split up and we weren't really friends. But then she came into 6th grade when I went into 7th grade and we started hanging out again. And now that she was in 7th grade and I was in 8th grade we have become REALLY good friends. Now we hang out all the time and talk ab9out guys and still cry and laugh alot together!! But I laugh alot with any of my friends as long as they are like me!! lol Right now we keep writing back and forth to each other because we are both online and checking out e-mails! Most of the time we are online at the same time! But anyways I hope Nessa will always be there for me because I will always be there for her!! But I g2g!!   lylas!

      Yesterday I went to Great Escape! It as SO much fun!! I went with Steph, Alex, Nessa, Toni, Sid... And I think thats it! But I road over with Steph and Alex. It was fun! But I accidentally shut Alex's hand in the door... Because he had his arm around me and I opened the door when we stopped for gas and ya... So I accidentally shut his hand in the door!! WHOOPS!! lol But I felt bad! Then when we got there it was raining and it was still fun because we were all running and splashing each other in the puddles and it was alot of fun!! hehe Then we went to the wave pool! And the water was actually warm!!! YAY!! hehe Then later we went on a ride that was dark and it had strobe lights and things and me and Alex sat together and he was trying to rape me!! lol But it was still fun! And then Steph started to like him again... But Alex and Nessa got me and Steph to go on the Comet. It was ok. But it was surprising that I went on a Rollercoaster. Because I hate Rollercoasters. But thats ok. Now my neck and shoulders hurt though. Alex wouldn't go on the Swan Ride thingy with me and Steph. We were sad!! lol We walked around so much and my feet hurt so much and they still do. And so do my thighs and ankles and calfs! GRRRR!! lol But it was worth it!! hehe When we were all in the Wave Pool my boob fell out of my bathing suit!!! Lucky me, Alex didn't see or anyone else besides Steph and Nessa! lol But I don't care about them seeing!! lol But then Alex was trying to get me and Steph to go on the Boomerang!! We were to scared so we didn't go on it!! lol I'm such a chicken. But when I said "NO!" Alex didn't bother me again! hehe He just kept begging Steph!! lol haha! hehe! Then on the way back me and Steph were holding Alex's hands and we kissed him on the cheek! But then we went to the Rutland Mall and we ate food. And Alex came with me and Steph to look at thongs and in Victoria Secret! It was funny!! hehe And Alex was gonna buy me a thong in Victoria Secret!! But only if he could see me in it!! lol But then he didn't because I didn't answer him. I shoulda just said ya i would show him and then never do it!! hehe! But then when we got to CVY we went to call our parents and when my mom and Alex's mom came Alex gave Steph a hug 1st then he gave me a BIG hug and picked me up!! lol But I don't like when people pick me up because I feel like they are gonna drop me and also if they can't pick me up I feel fat! But he could pick me up so it's all good!! lol My mom thinks he's gonna be my next boyfriend and Steph thinks I like him! But I don't and I'm not gonna because I gave up on younger guys or guys that aren't in my class or higher!! lol But anyways Great Escape was SO much fun!! hehe

      This summer i decided to go out with my best guy friend. I hasitated to go out with because I wanted to still be friends with... Even after we broke up... But I went for it because I liked him. Things were going great. And my mom even liked him. But... My mom decided to leave me and him home one day... ALONE! And she left us there for about 1 hour and 30 minutes. I'm a teenager so we start doing things. And then my mom finds out everything. I'm grounded. Even though it wasn't that bad, my mom still didn't like it. I was grounded for about 3 1/2 weeks. Which meant no anything... Then I finally got to watch TV. And that was about all. And my mom didn't even trust me alone at my house. I had to go everywhere with her. Then on my birthday I called him up and was talking to him for about 5-10 minutes. And he told me to check my e-mail as soon as possible because he had an urgent message... And it sounded like it was and I thought it was a braking up message. Well later that day I was checking my e-mail and I read that one and he did brake up with me... ON MY BIRTHDAY!!! What kind of person does that to someone?? I don't! Then the next day I went to my friend Steph's house and I told her all about it and that I didn't know why he broke up with me. And we decided to call him at his friends house and ask him. So we called him up and he told me that "You are grounded and we never can hang out or barely see each other" Well... He was the one who got me grounded... So I don't know why he said that. But then I was like: "Why did you brake up with me on my birthday then?" Then he told me that he didn't know it was my birthday. Which I know he did because he wrote it on his calender! Because I saw it there when I went to his house!! But I wrote him this big long e-mail telling him how much my life sucked right then and how he made it worse. But then later on that week my friend Vanessa told me that he went on 2 dates when he went down to Mass! And 1 of the dates was going to her HOTEL ROOM!!! And how did she find this out?? His bestfriend Mike who was there that whole week! When he was going out with me. Now I think there's some other reason why he broke up with me. Vanessa told Mike that he cheated on me and his response was: "It's not cheating if it's not the same area code." !!! So I could have 2 boyfriends?? Just each one from a different town?? That's so stupid. Cheating is cheating! So now I wanna know the WHOLE truth about what he did down in Mass.! And I wanna know it soon. And my friend invited me to her "party" and she also invited my ex-boyfriend. And I wanna go and make him jealous and also see if he says anything to me!! Anyways thats my sucky ass story! Got anything to say?? Well go ahead and say it!! Hopefully JOHN reads this!! To see how much of a DICK he really is!
