      Well, hello everybody.  Seeing as a bunch of thoughts tend to pop in and out of my head on a minute-to-minute basis, I thought I should probably write some of those thoughts down so I don't forget everything.  :^)  So read on if you'd like to hear what I have to say about various topics.  Mostly, I'll probably be ranting & raving about anything from politics to space to computers.  And for all of you geeks out there, don't worry, there will be plenty of dorkiness to go around.  Oh, by the way, if you'd like to know more about me & what's going on in my life, just view my  urlLink journal blog .  Enjoy!....        ....or don't!

      Well, we left from New York on Tuesday, June 1 to visit some friends from my Stanford days. Mike was another M.S. student with me at Stanford. We worked in the same lab, under the same professor, and took classes together. Needless to say, we were good friends. His wife Sue has got to be one of the nicest people you could meet.  They have two awesome kids, Sam &amp; Sarah. I had seen Sam when he was just a month old. He was born just before I graduated. But I hadn't seen Sarah at all. They're both a couple of great kids. Sam &amp; I had apparently kept in contact with through some sort of telepathic connection. Although, I wasn't aware of it. As soon as we got there he decided that I was his best buddy. I carried him all over the place. And if I set him down, he wanted right back up again. It was actually a lot of fun. Although, getting pee on your arm isn't my favorite past-time. :-)    urlLink     Here's a picture of Mike &amp;amp; Sam.  Gotta' love the baby backpack!  urlLink      West Point had to be the most relaxing portion of our trip. I was really impressed with how beautiful the area was. There are rolling mountains, tons of trees, the hudson river. It was awesome. And the base itself is built in a very neat way, lots of block &amp; stone. It would be hard to visit there as a young man and not want to become an Army officer.  Besides just hanging around the house &amp; relaxing, we took a tour of the base on a bus. They told us some neat little bits of history and gave us a good overview of everything that goes on. The place has just as much history as Boston.     urlLink     Here's a picture of the front of the cadet barracks.  Notice the beautiful Cadet Chapel further up the hill.  urlLink     I guess that's pretty much it. It was great to see Mike &amp; Sue again. I hope we can meet up from time to time as we get older. They have a great little family going there.

      Well, I guess I'd better start by letting everybody know how our vacation to the east coast went last month.  Jen had a few weeks off before residency started so we figured we should probably take a vacation before she started working 80 hours a week.  I had never been to the east coast so we decided to make a little trip out that way to see some friends.  First up was New York.  Jen's cousin Rachel lives right in Manhattan.  She has an awesome apartment at 34th & Park Ave.  It was originally a two bedroom apartment but they converted the dining room into a third bedroom.  They put up a new wall & it looks really good.  I wouldn't have even noticed if she hadn't told me they put up the wall.  I was pretty amazed at how large it was.  Even with the dining room converted they had a ton of living area.  Definitely a difference from what I've seen in other cities.  Although, she says that it isn't common.  We got to New York on a Friday about midday.  We moved all of our stuff into the apartment and then decided to start in with the tourist stuff.  We had to park our car in a garage.  It cost $29 a day.  Ouch!  But since Rachel was so nice to let us stay at her place for free it didn't hurt too bad.  It's so nice to have such good friends.  First thing we did was walk around downtown Manhattan for a while.  That was awesome!  I felt like I was walking through a movie or something.  You couldn't walk 100 ft without running into something you'd always heard about but had never seen.  We saw ground zero, wall street, the statue of liberty (from afar), a really neat church, china town, and on & on.  Here's a couple pictures from that day:  At one point we went to lunch down in Chinatown.  We went to a place called Joe's Shanghai.  It specializes in something called a soup dumpling.  It's this little dumpling filled with a yummy soup of some sort.  I didn't necessarily want to ask what was inside, but it sure tasted good.    Rachel was working about as much as Jen is now, if not more.  Luckily, though, she got some time off to hang out with us.  She got to go to dinner with us down in Little Italy.  Let me tell you, I would be in heaven if I could get an apartment down there and just eat for the rest of my life.  There are about 50 restaurants down this one little street.  The street is blocked off, the restaurants set up tables outside, and there are lights strung up all over the place.  People are eating & drinking wine, waiters are speaking Italian & trying to get you to eat at their restaurant, other's are selling stuff.  It's really neat.  We just picked a place and sat outside.  We sat there for probably 3 or 4 hours before we realized what time it was.  It was just so relaxing & the food was awesome.  We went to the Empire State Building, which sucked.  Not that it wasn't neat once we got to the top, but it was pure hell trying to make it there.  We waiting in probably 6 or 7 different lines before finally getting up there.  It took over two hours.  Ugghhh!  But we got some neat pictures (see below) & we get to say that we did it.  Word to the wise though, be prepared!   urlLink    Here's a picture of Jen & I on top of the Empire State Building!&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    This is the entrance to the Empire State Building.   I thought it was really neat.  Of course, this is only about 10 minutes into the 2 hour wait.&nbsp; urlLink     Next up was Central Park.  It's huge.  I took a picture from the Empire State Building that you can see below.  It's very pretty & clean.  I was impressed.  People were out running & walking, just hanging out.  There are lots of little ponds & gardens.  A nice relaxing time.   urlLink    Central Park from the Empire State Building.&nbsp; urlLink     Probably the most comprehensive thing we did was to take a tour around Manhattan island.  It was a 3 hour tour that took you all the way around the island, with a guy pointing things out & telling you stories along the way.  It was really interesting & gave you a good flavor of the island.  Be warned though, make sure to wear sunblock!  I got burnt so bad on my forehead that I blistered the next day.  Ouch!  I'm all healed up now though, so no harm done.  We went to Bronx zoo with some friends from West Point.  It was a neat zoo, but I've seen better.  The trip out was a bit of an adventure, since we went the wrong way on a subway twice.  Oops!  At one point we had to go above ground to change trains, in Harlem!  Kind of scary for a couple of whities from Indiana.  :)  While we were in New York we had our first anniversary.  I can't believe it's been a year already.  In some respects it seems like it went fast, but it also feels like we've been together forever.  Any woman able to put up with me for that long deserves a medal.  I'm thinking a purple heart for our 50th anniversary.  :)  Anyway, we went to a nice dinner down in Little Italy again (which was even better this time).  Then we went to see Rent on Broadway.  Then we decided to pretend we had some money & get a hotel downtown.  All in all, a very nice first anniversary.  Well, I guess that's it for the part of our vacation to New York.  We were there for 4 days all together.  It was a blast and I'd definitely recommend going to anyone interested.  What a great city.  Don't know if I could live there though.  Check back later for the rest of the vacation.  See-ya!

      Well, I've finally decided to start myself a little online blog-action.  For those family members out there that may not know exactly what a "blog" is, I suggest checking  urlLink this  out.  By the way, if you ever need to look up something real quick, try out  urlLink WikiPedia , it rocks.  Anyway, I plan on this blog just covering general stuff about Jen & I.  Hopefully you can check back here once in a while and see what's been going on with us.  I'll try and keep my ranting & raving about current events limited to other blogs.  But hey, if you interested in  urlLink what I have to say .  I guess that's it for now.  I'll start blogging our life pretty soon & hopefully you enjoy what I have to say.  See-ya!
