      A GOOD WEEK FOR TIPPING    Well, I've looked over the stats, the lists, the form, and even the injuries and yes, this is a difficult week to tip my friends. It will certainly sort the men from the boys, and he who comes out on top will be a great victor. I've made some tough decisions and gone with the heart. Hopefully you too have all been careful in selection and entered your tips for week two. Goodluck, and good tipping. And remember, football will be the winner this weekend.

      Bangas will take the lead  A prediction, Bangas will take the lead in the footy tipping this week. He is primed and has picked his roughies strategically and methodically. Once he takes the lead he will streak ahead. There is no question about that, Bangas is a ruthless tipster when Richmond is winning.  NB://How about we play soccer on the sunday?

      Players Play Like Hacks  Another poor performance by the Players last night. We must wonder how we can turn from butt kickers to butt sniffers in the space of a few weeks. We played like dogs. And not even good dogs, poodles or something. It was miserable and we need to lift for the finals. Kizza raises a good point, the basic skills are down, (missing easy goals and easy goal keeping for example) and we need to practice. Hows about we get together on Saturday afternoon and have a knock around at Royal Park. We could even go to Victoria St park and have a kick there and then go over the road for a set or two on the astroturf at Brunny West. Let me know what you think, and get pumped lads! The finals are on the way and we all know we can be good enough to take the flag, we've done it before!

       Poor Performance   I agree with White-y, last night was our poorest performance to date and our skill level and commitment was not convincing. We looked underprepared in all facets of the game.  It is time for the Players within to rise and gain strength, we need to recall the inner belief we had prior to the last couple of games.   I think a training session on the weekend would be a good idea, curtain square sounds as good a place as any and might I add, pizza can be followed up with after a hard hit out earlier in the day. We may need to wear a bullet proof vest when we go for pizza though, I think the famous pizza store in Rathdown St could be the site of the next underworld killings.  Bangas

       Indoor Soccer - what a disgrace!   Well, I can safely say that last night was a shithouse performance.  The blame can't be placed squarely on any one person's shoulders.  We lacked structure last night, and worst of all, our foot skills were pathetic.  Passing to feet was atrocious, simple skills like trapping the ball just weren't there (I was terrible in this regard).    I propose we meet up at some stage, possibly over the weekend, and have a quick kick (an hour or so), just to practice a few of the simpler skills mentioned above.  Maybe at Curtain square (park at the end of my street), or Royal park?  Let's hope that we can pull our fingers out for the next game, our first final.  We may have to recall Remy for a little more fire power up forward.  Come on players, it's now time to rise up!  Word out - Kiz

       Match Review:   Last week we had a lot of passengers. In response to Mr Whitten'c comments about Bangas' poor performance I would like to add that Bangas' kicked all 3 of the goals last week ya mug! I would like to add that Bangas' is once again way ahead on the golden boot award as he continues to kick 2 to 3 goals a game for his side, so why does he have to play in defence? Because all the rest of yas don't push back and help out ya mugs! He admits he was a little flat last week but as all star players do, he will lift and provide once again for the Players cause.  As for Te-Hahn's performance, I would like to publically announce that it was the worst performance of his career and if he doesn't improve for finals he will be ommitted from the side. You can't live on 2 goals in last years final forever!  White-y will be a valued addition and will work well with Bangas, Statsy, Sutto & Fletch around the back line and through the middle of the court.   As for Assthol, he had a poor one last week but the three previous weeks was on top of his game. As with Te-Hahn, he could be a questionable starter for the finals if he puts in another performance as he did last week. Little support in defence is no excuse for 10 goals going through the back of the net, 8 of which can be attributed to Assthol's name. He will lift though as all "Players" do and will be cool, calm and collected to cement his spot in the team.  Statsy needs to lift in offence, too many balls are going wide and he has not scored a goal for a number of games. He is strong in defence however he must provide some results up forward. Bangas and White-y need support up there from Statsy and Te-Hahn.  As for Moe, last week he was a passenger, the couple of games he played prior to last week were on the money. Must show a greater commitment to the Players in defence and when he gets in range have a shot at the goals as he possesses a penetrating strike. It is now a question if Moey can harness that right boot of his.   What times the game again, I am pumped!  Signing off - Bangas

       Players Match Preview   Tonight the Players will line up for what promises to be an exciting and challenging final match for the home and away season. Coming off an embarrassing loss to 'Old School Flavour', Stats (Captain) and his troops will be looking for an improved performance. Lets hope they can recapture previous form and cap the season off with a win.  With his killer goal scoring boot the return of Whitty should bolster the side, and an improved performance from Bainbridge in defence will be required to assist Whitten whilst keeping goals after their disappointing performances last week. Teehan played within himself last week and will be keen to make an impression before the finals. With H.Whitten out injured (ankle) the surprise packet of the last few weeks M. Verhoeven could once again be called to duty. Having already ensured a spot in the finals, a win should lift the spirits of the players and set them up for a successful finals series. Go Players!

      Footy Tips Round 2  Boys, this week is one hell of a hard round to tip. There is around 6 out of the 8 games that may go each way.  Especially, Hawthorn v Kangaroos  (I believe an inspired Kangas on a high can match it with any team. Hawthorn is one of the better Melbourne teams and has twice the fitness the Kangas will have) West Coast v Port Adelaide (The game is at Subiaco and West Coast is young and love playing at one of the biggest grounds in the southern hemisphere. Port Adelaide is a class act after inhilating Essendon with Hird & Loyd in the line up) Essendon v St Kilda (The Dons will be wanting revenge after what is their worst effort in a decade. The Sainters are all class and have a list that will match it with any of the top 4 sides) Carlton v Geelong (Well, I would have pencilled the Catters down for this one but injuries to their 3 key big men and a couple of reports don't go their way they will be in trouble. Carlton will field their best side as they will think this is a game they can win and win well. Match of the round I reckon)  Bangas

      I would like an inquery into Athol getting 8 for round 1.  Firstly, I don't think it is possible because he is too short;  Secondly, His mother thinks his gay but doesn't know it yet. We know differently though after Athol told us so passionately about his love for lustful breasts;  Thirdly, He is a Richmond supporter. Do you have any idea of how hard it is to tip 8 when you are a Richmond supporter; and  Finally, well...............He likes animals. You might think that this is normal but when I say it like.....No, he really likes animals. That is right, the reason why he is doing zoology is because he has a thing for gorillas.  I think that is enough evidence to hold an inquery or at very least an audit of his tips for Round 1.  Bangas

I will proceed to jump on and off the bandwagon as I please throughout the year. After round 1 I have decided to jump on the bandwagon and see where this season takes us.  Contraversies of the week I would like some discussion in is:  "Is James Hird gay?" and, "Is Michael Voss weak?"  Bangas

       MOVIE REVIEW   I had the misfortune of going along to see the Butterfly Effect on Friday night. My advice for the rest of you is to not follow suit. The story-line had its positives and was actually quite interesting at times but Ashton Kucher should stick to playing the dorky funny college boy character and steer clear of drama roles wherever possible. He was useless, and the movie suffered for it. Other than that the incredibly hot chick from Road Trip was in it and once again she was awesome. Also the fat guy from American History X played a cool character and did a good job. Most of the others were however a bit weird and the movie was weird as a whole. Not recommended. Two Stars.

      I cannot believe the time that you guys have. I do note that the most significant contributors are of course the working men. You are obviously very stimulated by your own jobs.  Anyway, I just put my tips in and I thought I should let you know I have tipped all eight winners this week. Good luck catching me.  Moses.  PS - the reason I know I have tipped all eight winners is that I have stumbled across a time portal in my room. Between my desk and wardrobe I noticed a glowing swirl (much like that in the Austin Powers movie - freaky how Mike Myers always gets it right). Anyway, I ventured in and was pleased to find that all away teams win this week and that Athol grows two feet (not new appendages at the end of his legs, rather two feet in height, a unit of measurement).

       Football & Other Important Topics   The Players can hold their heads up high. Last nights performance was both spirited and committed. WE played hard, smart and strong football and should be proud. It has been another very successful season for the Players who only twelve months ago came together as a rag-tag bunch of spritely young men, some with little to no soccer experience at all. We matched it with the best and came out on top on many an occasion. Well done boys.  In other news, whilst we celebrated with a beer or two at the GN last night, James Hird let rip at Scott McLaren on the footy show. And may I just say, Bloody good on him. McLaren is one of the worst umpiores in the league, second only maybe to GoldSPANK. For someone who is said to be one of the AFL's finest, McLaren has been favouring sides and tearing others apart for years. Though it pains me to say it, Essendon and in particular Lloyd and Hird have copped a rough trot from him on many an occasion and I for one was happy to hear that Hird had the balls to say something about it. I do believe however that he would have been put up to it by the club, who will be I'm sure, happy to pay the fine that will no doubt be presented to Hirdy for his comments.  Finally, REMEMBER TO ENTER YOUR TIPS FOR ROUND THREE ! And I have been thinking... Rather than requesting an entry fee for the tipping and having a cash prize, hows about we simply have a Top Gun Night for the winning tipper. I propose that he who wins shall be shouted dinner and beers for an evening at the Pub of the winners choice, by the four "runner ups" or shall we say LOSERS! HEHEHE  OK, Lads, if I don't see any of you before the weekend... HAPPY EASTER and if any of you are travelling, PLEASE: Be Safe and Take Care.

       Soccer Review   "Players, a gallant effort but fall short in Semi Final"   Well guys, what can be said about a game that promised everything. We played an exceptional first half full of strong committed defence and continual attacks at goal. Second half was good but when they got their 2nd goal with 5 minutes to go to hit the front and scoring was tough we had to push hard to force something. We had some fantastic chances in the second half particularly early on when we were peppering their keeper but couldn't convert, if we had I dare say we would have been talking about an emphatic victory not a gallant defeat.  What will happen to the Players??? Will they play on for another season??? All these questions will be widely discussed and answered in the next couple of weeks.  Thanks for the good times and sweet memories fellow Players.  Signing Off - Bangas

       Soccer   "Players to dominate Semi Final 1"   I agree with facets of Tehahns analysis. I do think we need to play to strengths and playing a more central game plan does enhance that although it does make it more difficult to score as we are cluttering up the goals. Therefore I do not think we discount playing wide to make passages/corridors for players to run into infront of goal for that illusive strike.   I agree with Tehahn & White-y, we need to play smarter. Play stronger defence when required, push hard to cover defence when not in attack. Kick & don't hesitate to passages/corridors where players are running - this opens up play. Quick passes are essential as well as position. Do often we have been chasing arse instead of keeping position - we have been giving position up too easily. In defence we can not get illiminated - we must talk and let each other know where to stand and cover passages and the line of path instead of attacking the ball all the time.   A good start is essential tonight so lets be on the ball, no early goals and strong on the ball to set a precident for the rest of the game.  Also, I will share goal keeper duties throughout the night as the Short Man needs relief, especially after the last couple of weeks. I suggest White-y also does a couple stints. Maybe Athol be the main man in goals but Bangas and White-y have a couple of 3 minute stints throughout each half.  Lets be positive tonight - "Attitudinal" aspect of Tehahns analysis. Believe in your skills and ability because we can be a very skillful team when we put it together. Lets put it together tonight!  Go Players!!!  Signing Off - Bangas

Switched on we must be, agressive, strong and smart.  Btw, what are we doing after the game?  I was thinking of going to the commercial club, it's paper scissors and rock night.  Or we could try to crash the eng ball at San Remo...

      Greetings all,  As this is my debut blog, I do not propose to travel too far outside the parameters of normal blogging behaviour.  So today my special topic is indoor soccer - specifically, my theory of what we must do to turn around our form.  first, it is important to note that our problems are both attitudinal and structural.  that is, our forwards (initials myles tehan and michael verhoeven) are bone lazy, and their general lack of fitness makes them unwilling to defend.  On the structural side, we play too wide.  Now, I have had many heated and passionate encounters with Bangas.  In addition, I have talked to him about indoor soccer.  You may record that as my first attempt at a joke.  It didn't go as well as you might have hoped.  Nevertheless, this is the problem:  1. We are not skilful enough to play a game that revolves around passing. 2. Thus, we must use our general strength (obviously not mine, but others) to bullock our way to goal. 3. By using the sidelines, we open up the middle of the court for our opposition, and make our own attacks inefficient.  "What should we do?", I hear you blog.  We should focus our attack towards the centre of the field, always ensuring that someone (Stats) is back in defence to guard against the fast break.  Of course, we have to mix it up (i.e. go wide sometimes), but our predominant line of attack must be central.  In this way, we can push our way towards goal, and even if we turn it over, the opposition's only clear space is towards the sidelines, making their attack slower and thus allowing us time to run back.  You may think, fellow blogheads, that I am focussing on only one of our problems.  No doubt I am.  Hence, I am making this pledge:  "I, Myles 'Te-hahn' 'Geek-boy' 'Phanta' Tehan, hereby promise to run like buggery tomorrow night, and in the grand final when we make it.  This running will not only be in attack, but also to help out in defence."  I call on all of you blogheads to join with me in ensuring that we shit all over our opposition tomorrow night.  I remain yours in blogging,  Teeza.

       LUNCHBREAK ALERT   Lads, disaster has struck... Carlton United Breweries have just announced that all Carlton Draught and VB products manufactured in the past 3 months could possiblly be contaminated with the deadly 'lustiger witz' bacteria strain and should be therefore returned to the place of purchase for a full refund. Whats more they have had to close down production for the next month or so, AND, discontinue the sale of all tap beer for an unspecified amount of time. As a precaution, other breweries have announced that they may follow suit, especially if as expected the infection stems from contaminated yeast cultures, of which all companies use  some of the same types. A victory beer would have been on the cards after tomorrow nights game but who knows what we can trust now huh? Apparently the first warning came when some poor bloke had to go to hospital last night after drinking lots of VB and then spewing up blood...  By the way, when is the game, has anyone had a call.  Anyway guys, just thought I would warn you... Be alert. Your country needs lerts.

       Lunch   I am tired after a lunch fit for a king and was pondering Wednesday nights "clash of titans" Semi Final 1 game.  I am a little concerned of the moral and belief of the side so I thought a few words of motivation could be employed to lift the spirit of the Players for this very important Semi Final match.  "People may doubt what you say but they will believe what you do."   "Light the fire within."   "Nothing happens until I make it happen."   "We are all equipped with a gift or talent, which used correctly, will lead us to fortune and success."   "Individual commitment to a group effort-that is what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilization work."   "The ratio of We's to I's is the best indicator of the development of a team."   "Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence wins championships."   "If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door."  “Motivation comes from within.”   "Set your goals high, and dont stop till you get there."   & one from me,  Lets go get em boys, eat em alive!

       NEWS BREAK "White-y gets 2 in Rd 2 of AFL Season"   After observing the Rd 2 results for the Top Gun Challenge this morning I can confirm that Mr Kizza "White-y" has scored 2! hahahahahaahahaha  Lucky it was in a round where the best result was 5.   This was the week where someone could have made a big move, instead we all scored medioca results.  Assthol still on top with 12 with Bangas and Te-Hahn closely behind on 11 tips. Moesy on down is a further tip behind on 10 (winning most consistent with 2, 5 tip hauls) and who would have thought but White-y is holding up the arse end of the competition on 8. hahahahahahahahaha  Signing Off - Bangas

      JAMES COPS 20K  Yo yo yo, what goes down in the TP Hood? All you diggy dogs got your tips in for round four gee?  Looks like another interesting week in football. Some really tough games to pick so we should expect some close results and the odd biffo as was seen previoulsy, and duly noted by Ben. Ben has also made a relevant point regarding contact, I think someone oughta tell the AFL it ain't bloody soccer and that if a guy gets smacked it's just gonna happen sometimes. Though I was a little suprised to see Kane Johnson cop a full fist to the face on Monday, bit out of the ordnary thats for sure.  Anyways, good tipping, good footy and hopefully we can all catch up for a brew over the weekend...

       Tough Week for Tipping   This is going to be another one of those rounds that will sort the boys from the men. An extremely hard round to pick - Good Luck to you all!  I would like to place on the record that I have picked Richmond this week in the hope that they beat an undermaned and underskilled Geelong.   You would have heard that Crawford has got himself off, maybe because he didn't really do anything wrong apart from give away a free kick. I believe that there is currently a belief by the Umpiring community that every bit of contact that occurs on the footy field is a reportable offence. A reportable offence should have the intent to do harm eg. Baker, not merely through yourself at the ball to try and create something.   I would like to finish by stating "Football is a contact sport and by nature will always be a sport that has a lot of injuries, why should someone who has been involved in the injury be punished for what is a result from the nature of the game"?

       Weather, Essendon, Kizza and Lara Warm Up.   Well what a big week it has been in football. I must agree that the game from Essendon and particularly James was one of the best I have ever witnessed, would have been a cracker to be at. To think someone like Hird could be removed from the competition is purely preposterous, what a talent! When he banged that goal through with seconds to go, he showed the world why he is one of greatest ever to grace the field. I felt priveleged to have seen such a display of football genius.  Lara too, a genius amongst mere men, showed us why he is and will always be known as one of the greatest. A great knock against the country that began it all must surely be sensational, 400 NOT OUT. WOW.  Kizza too has warmed up, just as the weather has today. 29 and windy, weird. Well done on getting 8 mate. The rest of us too performed well, 7 a good score, but with the round the way it was, nothing less than 6 would have been acceptable.  Goodluck with round four lads, and if you want to catch up tomorrow night for a beer or two then let me know... The GN perhaps???

       Hird   You need a team of 18 not 1 to wrestle with supremacy mate, you proved that when you played the supreme teams of Port Adelaide and St Kilda. Maybe we can join up, the Tiges and Dons. Together we may have a chance. Imagine Kane Johnson, Hird, Brown, Coghlan, Hille & Ottens in the centre of the ground. Unstoppable! Also the forward line talls would look like Lloyd, Richardson, Stafford & Lucas.    Sending messages to Moey "Play golf on the weekend with Bangas, Comon"   Signing Off - Bangas

My lord, I would have to put that performance down as one of the best single efforts in all of my watching of AFL football. Well I think it probably equals Gary Ablett's 1999 Grand Final performance. Pitty we don't see these performances from Richmond. Also the tipping from the Top Gun lads was first rate and it shows that this is no micky mouse competition. It is obviously the "cream of the crop" that have turned out for what will be a year of punch for punch from each of the 5 tipsters.  I hope you all enjoyed your Easter, I was painting a house in Portland sinking brewskies with Ryza. Wasn't that bad although I think we both broke every OH&S rule while doing it. Particularly the half drunk painting on the roof.  Look forward to reading more Bloggers this week although I am probably the only one to be working and therefore probably the only one that is going to contribute.  Signing Off - Bangas

       Too Much Time on Your Hands   Now coming from a public servant this would have to be one of the biggest insults to a person but I think it is most appropriate I direct a big "Too Much Time on Your Hands" to Assthol. The last blogger sent by the little man rivaled the best public servants in the business and I have seen a lot of them pass through here. You may have missed your calling Assthol, its not too late though, you can become a public servant at any stage throughout your life, you just have to be the "Best Man" at the Premiers wedding.

       Brotherly Love   The television show you are thinking of Moses was called "Brotherly Love"... It was about Mr Joseph Lawrence and his two younger brothers, who were in fact his real brothers, Matt and Andy.   Now to show you how far my research skills have developped MOE, I have come up with some interesting links...  Here Goes.  Mathew Lawrence, brother of Joe and co-star of "Brotherly Love" recently starred alongside Rob Schneider in "The Hot Chick" that wacky comedy that no-one bothered to see about a sexually disorientated man (or was it a woman). Schneider is most famous for his role as Deuce Bigalow, but what you may not know is that he once appeared in an episode of a show loved by us all that goes by the name of "Seinfeld". You may have heard of it. Anyways, back in 1996 he played Bob in the Friars Club episode. Beautiful. Whilst we speak of Seinfeld, may I mention that Jason Alexander, the actor behind the loathable yet lovable character Geroge once appeared in a short lived show called E/R (1985-86).  Now this show believe it or not was based upon a character named DR SHEINFELD. And still my friends the links keep on coming... E/R also starred one Mr George Clooney who ten years later played a lead role in the current day hospital drama E.R. (A different show but also based in Chicago) And here comes the finalé. E.R. introduced the world to a star in the making. She played the character of Charlie for a full season beginning in '95, and is today famous for many roles, most notably as Mary Jane Wilson in SpiderMan. Being born in New Jersey USA and with a last name beginning with D she is Miss Kirsten Dunst.  AND MOE my dear boy she brings us back to the beginning by sharing with you the date for your REAL birthday on the 30th of April. And to top it all off she was actually born on the exact same day as you back in 1982.   Wow, that felt good. Oh, and its all true, feel free to check.

      Thanks for the heartfelt apology bangas. You are a good man. As you are all now aware, it was not my birthday on the 20th of April - it is indeed on the 30th of April.  After a close reading of Bangas' blog, I noted a name that I so easily forgot - Joey Lawrence. What a star. That guy was the bloke with the mullet on a tv show that wasn't really that funny. I can't remember what it was called though, but I remember something about him having younger brothers and part of it was set in a garage. Great TV.

       Moey    "A heartfelt story of a man whose birthday was forgotten from their peers"  Moey, we didn't forget we just did not quite get around to saying happy birthday to you because we were saying happy birthday to a more notable and powerful person who also graced the 20 April:  In 1889, Adolf Hitler was born in Braunau, Austria.  Also after Adolf we were going to give you a call but other more notable celebrities come in the way:  Singer Johnny Tillotson.  Actor George Takei ("Star Trek").  Actor Ryan O'Neal.  Keyboardist Craig Frost of Grand Funk Railroad.  Actress Jessica Lange.  Singer Luther Vandross.  Actor Clint Howard. Actor Crispin Glover.  Actress Carmen Electra.  Actor Joey Lawrence.  You see, after saying Happy Birthday to all of these people the 20 April past by and it was the 21 April. Not to worry, we will see if we can get around to you next year.

      Well, what a big week in blogging it has been.  Richmond  Not worthy of discussion  My birthday  Thanks for forgetting guys. You're all good friends.  Molly  Athol, I don't know why you have taken it upon yourself to start wearing an acubra and pretending for a long time that you are not gay (and of course professing your great knowledge of all things musical) but I appreciate the updates and reviews. If you can provide a concise history of the great band Radiohead in the next few days so those of us lucky enough to be attending their concert can brush up on our knowledge, I'm sure it would be much appreciated. As a side note, while I agree the Dissociatives single is good (and I think I've heard a little of the album) it still does not mean that they didn't come across as complete weirdos last night on Rove. Either they were both stoned, or Daniel Johns is an absolute tool and Paul Mac simply wants to kiss his arse.  Editor's note - correction  It has been brought to my attention that my great sense of humour may be being misunderstood. My gag in the last blog: "Gentlemen... (and any unsuspecting web-surfing women who have stumbled across our blog - go and do something useful with your lives)" The 'go and do something useful with your lives' only referred to any sad women who stumbled across our blog. It was not a negative comment towards any of you (unless of course 'you' are a random person who has yet again stumbled on our blog). Anyway, it is all getting confusing, but you can take it as granted that I have taken to the blog and no longer view it as a waste of time.  Final note  Nothing. Must go to class.

       BUY NEW MUSIC - IT IS GOOD FOR YOU   I have recently bought plenty of new music. Over the past 4/5 months I have purchased many CD's both new and second hand. Since then I have learnt two things; the CD man at the Uni Union market has much to offer and at JB HiFi you can always find what you want and often for quite a bargain.  The following CD's I have both highly enjoyed and reccomend to you...   The Dissociatives  A kooky mix of rock and chill-out style tunes, with silverchair's Daniel Johns on vocals and dance legend Paul Mac on most else. They have written, recorded and produced the album themselves and have done a fine job of it. Track highlights include the first single "Somewhere down the barrel" which has been released with a really funky video clip, "Lifting the Veil from the Braille", a lovely piece of instrumental whimsy with whistles and "Thinking in Reverse", which is so '80s it should come with its own hair gel.  All up:4 Stars. GO GET IT.    Crack in the Wall EP - The Panics  The beautiful follow up to their senstional debut album released in 2002. Much anticipated (by me) the new EP does exceeds expectations. Though only 7 tracks, each is as good as the last and I've not stopped listening since the purchase was made last week. Favourites would have to be "Cash" the catchy and pleasing tribute to Johnny Cash and "Crack in the wall" (spot the irony) which is so soothing you could fall asleep at lunch time. The album is still very new, released just last week and thus is still expensive, particulalry for only seven tracks. Only reccomended if you were a fan of the album, though if you've not heard it ask me for a copy. You will not be dissapointed. 5 STARS.

       Happy Birthday Moe!   I would like to extend a big Happy Birthday to Moey for yesterday. I hope you had a fantastic night that included a hot, passionate session with your lover - Kizza.  Assthol, stay true to the cause, we will bounce back. It isn't Johnson's fault, yes had played badly but it is the whole bloody team playing a pathetic brand of football. They do not open up the play, their disposal is poor and they over use the football. If they can begin to do these three things correctly we will win, it is as simple as that.

       RICHMOND GET BLOGGED   Hey Guys. Dissapointing week in the tips I must say. I have cracked under pressure with my equal worst performance of all time. A miserly two tips, quite embarressing really.  I am beginning to hate Richmond. Not only did they lose to Geelong, a team yet to break through with a win, they didn't even try. You heard me right, they played bad for the first half, tried gallantly for the first part of the third qrt and when Geelong broke to a sizable lead, THEY GAVE UP. Ben was there and I am sure he'll agree, RICHMOND GAVE UP. It is disgraceful. Whilst young players Newman, Roach and Hartigan all earnt their stripes for the night... the rest played like a bunch of old women. I make special mention to Kane Johnson. NEVER BEFORE HAVE I SEEN SUCH A PERFORMANCE. He did not chase, he did not tackle he did not make space, he did not even run. HE DID NOT TRY. And just when I thought maybe he was inured, he TOOK HIMSELF TO THE BENCH, sat down, and did not seek the assistance of a physio or trainer at all. ABSOLUTELY PITIFUL. I've said enough, they are a DISGRACE.  I agree with Ben that a kick of the footy would be a good idea. Perhaps we follow it up with a boys dinner at the GN and have a night of quiet beers. Lets make arrangements.

       Sorry Te-Hahn   I do apologise Te-hahn, I worded it wrong, I meant to say that I am 2 ahead of all the serious contenders.  I am ahead of my family competition - equal leader, and that is worth over $500. This is fierce competition because no one in that competition has a heart so I am always up against calculated tipsters.   I will not choke like Lonhro did on the weekend though, I am not only a sprinter but a stayer. I will win and win well so lift the standards guys because the only way you are going to beat me is if you lift and tip beyond yourselves because I have raised the bar once again.  On another note, Maybe we all should catch up for a kick of the footy this weekend, what do you think?   And Moey, maybe if we find time, we set up a golf game? The others could be invited but I don't think they are good enough and I do not want to be waiting for sub standard golfers.  Signing Off - Bangas

      Gentlemen... (and any unsuspecting web-surfing women who have stumbled across our blog - go and do something useful with your lives)  I am sad to see I am only sitting on 21 tips for the top gun challenge. However, I'm sure you will all be pleased to know that I am sitting pretty on 23 tips in my work competition, in a tie for 12th place and only 2 from the leaders. I feel $1500 coming on. I have a renewed focus in life - winning the tipping competition. From now until late August, I will be devoted to scouring the form and watching every possible game of football to ensure that I meet my true destiny.  Mo.

      It's hard to see where Bangas reckons he has slipped two ahead in the tipping.  My rudimentary mathematics skills would indicate that in fact there is only a difference of 1 tip between 22 and 23.  Please let me know your thoughts.  The form analysts are all jumping on Te-hahn.  Without winning a week, he has turned in consistent performances to leave himself just behind the leader.  As opposed to the Lonhro-esque Bangas, who is highly regarded, but will crack under the pressure.  Let's not make too many cerise donuts hey mate.  Also, I have the fortune of being able to tip Brisbane with both my head and my heart - a happy change since the days of tipping Fitzroy in 1996, when they won only one match.  However, tipping Fitzroy to beat Adelaide in Adelaide in 1994 did allow me to pick up a quiet $250, which in today's money is about $250.  Must go - must analyse the performances from last weekend in detail.

       Bangas goes to Lead   "What a performance"   And Bangas has run ahead by 2 tips in the Top Gun Tipping Competition for 2004 by scoring a 5 under the extreme heat of Rd4. And this was in the face of a demoralising Richmond defeat against Geelong that almost had me jumping off the West Gate Bridge.  It will be hard to catch me, now that I have the lead as I am a supreme tipster. However my heart does get the better of me now and than and that can often let others into the mix. I am also going overseas for a good part of the end of the season but will be tracking the form while over there very closely. I will probably have a big enough lead by than to not tip the last 4 rounds anyway.  Also, a well done to Assthol for scoring 2 and relinquishing the lead to Bangas. He just cracked under the immence pressure exerted on him as Richmond did on Saturday night.  Signing Off - Bangas

      This one's for you Kizza,   Aussies smash squash rally record   May 5, 2004    A GROUP of top juniors in Perth have smashed the world record for squash's longest rally.   The young Australians recorded 2067 shots in 51 minutes 34 seconds to smash the old record of 1533 shots recorded by the Old Pats Club, in Gloucestershire, England, on World Squash Day last year.  - I thought everyone should be aware of this feat, another World Record owned by the Aussies.  Also, Go Sainters! 19 players on the field, there is a rule against that Tehahn. The Sainters should have been penalised. Although, the goal umpire wasn't actually on the field.

      A number of points: First, that is where Essendon will finish.  Second, the phrase is 'white man can't jump', not 'dunk'.  Third, the use of blogger for individual challenges seems a little strange. Why would I want to read about such meaningless duels? I may as well issue Athol with a challenge to see who is the shorter.  Fourth, that is where Brisbane will finish (must give credit where credit is due).  Fifth, the finale of Average Joe is on tonight. If anyone happens to read this before 10.30, 29 April 2004, it is must see television. Go watch it. If you have indeed missed it by now, I hope you are eagerly awaiting my rundown of what happened on it.  Sixth, gambling on horse races is a hopeless pursuit. Much like riding on a unicycle around and around in perfect circles - it gets you nowhere.  And last, but not least, that is where Richmond will finish... actually they will be least as well.

       Short Man   Shortman, why are you known as shortman while everyone else is known by their first name. When Kizza, Moey, Tehahn & myself post a blogger it says that Keiren, Michael, Myles & Ben have posted the blogger, however when yourself post a blogger you are known as shortman.  Why? Is it because you want to incriminate us and you want to be unrecognisable. I am moving a blogger motion that Nick Names will be assigned instead of first names so everyone is unrecognisable to outsiders.  Signing Out - Bangas

       Whitey's Challenge   As the white basketball player once said to the black basketballer, I can dunk! & since than you can see giant white basketballers still scaling the heights to dunk basketball after basketball, day in day out. Because White Man Can Dunk!  In light of my analogy above, I will accept your challenge whitey, & I will dunk. I do however wish to sleep in a little bit if that is possible. I will need to borrow Statsy's racquet unless you have another one handy.    I would also like to add, are you sure you want to do this? You realise that every sport you think you are better than me at, I always seem to be that little bit, well better, at it. That is why I won the sport allrounder reward at school mate. You may think I am full of myself but every sport I have played, especially those ones that consist of balls and bats, I have been good. Squash is no exception to the rule, I have never lost a match. Sure I have not played for years and the competition was not exceptional, but I still have not lost. Squash is one of the only avenues you have got left mate, do you really want to jeapordise this?

       Radiohead = fantastic    Just to reiterate what the other boys have said so far, the Radiohead concert was bloody good, fantastic even.  This is the first time I've checked Blogg in a while.  So while I'm here, I want to throw out the challenge to Bangas, let's have a game of squash soon.  Maybe this Saturday Morning, (if Moe's birthday celebrations go well, we may both be hung over, but equally so, so there'll be no excuse).  I feel it's time I kicked your arse... Do you accept?!  If he is too weak to, maybe one of you other boys would be interested in a game?

Geez I must be a real Twat. Personally, I would have rather gone to see Shannon Noll, the heart and soal of today's music. Shannon's version of "What about me" is mind blowing and "Drive" is a classic that will be sung 20 years from now in pubs around the world. Shannon is rivaled to be bigger than names like - Prince/or the man formerly known as Prince (which one is it now), Michael Jackson, even the Beatles. I don't know if he will ever eclipse the heights of Jimmy Barnes though.  Today, I am busy and do not have much time for this nonsense so I am signing off, see you Friday Night!

       Bangas Radio Dick Head   Aaaahhh, Ben Ben Ben, my poor boy. How silly and insipid you are. You may laugh all you wish becasue we went to the RadioHead concert on MONDAY NIGHT YOU TWAT. The second show was cancelled, the first show was absolutely brilliant, and we were there to witness it. The cancellation of the second show only makes the significance of Mondays nights performance that much greater. It means we were there to witness the final show of a world tour, and boy was it a beauty. WE all had a great time whilst you sat at home, probably listening to Guy Sebastion.

       Radio Head   Sorry to hear guys that the last concert was cancelled. You guys have had this planned for months and to have it cancelled must have been heartbreaking. It is cruel but I can't help it..........hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaaha!  Sorry, I apologise for my insensitivity. At least you get your money refunded.  In response to Moey's invite and Andy's invite - twice, that is 3 invites, I guess I will make the journey to the Kent to celebrate the not so significant birthday of 22. After 21 it is often a more mellow affair that first starts out with dinner with the missus and then catching up for drinks with mates afterwards. Quite enjoyable evening all in all.  I would also like to note that Tehahn, contrary to Assthol's comments in his earlier blogger only scored 6, not 7. Therefore he is equal with Bangas on 28. Tehahn, don't get ahead of yourself buddy, champions like me take the set backs on their chin and bounce back harder and better than before eg. Voss, Hird, (Searching for a Tiger champion who displays these qualities, can't find a current player with these qualities, Ian Stewart - Richmond dual Brownlow Medallist & an absolute gun).

      Yes, the one-year anniversary of your pool exploits looms Tehahn. (I'm not actually sure that that was my birthday, but it'll do.) Anyway, I'm having dinner with Andy on Friday to celebrate my reaching (for the second time) of a great ongoing event - both digits of my age will be the same. Planning on heading to the Kent after said dinner for a couple of beers (9.30-10ish) and any of you who can tear yourselves away from other interesting aspects of your life are welcome to attend. Tell any people you think would be suitable (and who can offer witty remarks, like those being exhibited on the blog).  Come on the Dons. As a side note, please note Essendon will this year atone for their inadequacy in 2000. I speak of course of winning a Brownlow in the same year as a premiership. James is a certainty. (No notice will be given to any comment from Tehahn about his adopted team having done this twice.)

       NEWSFALSH: Mylesies Head Poised to Explode.  Unsurprisingly, further development was encountered today in what has become known as the TripleC or Continual Crest Crescendo, the ever increasing size of Mylesy's Head. Having successfully picked 7 correct winners over the weekend, creating a miserly one point lead in the TopGunChallenge, Mylesy's head seems sure to explode. One can only wonder how big a human cranium can get before it will succumb to the pressure within and explode into a cerebral catastrophe. More news tomorrow.

      Well, well, well Bangas,  It was clear that you did not want to address the real issue in today's blog - my stellar performance in the footy tipping.  The footsteps grow louder and louder, as Bangas slumps to a dismal 5.  statisticians will note that the site average for round 5 was 5.6: thus, Bangas' performance was "below-average".  Another interesting fact - if you look at the site leaders, the bloke (I assume) who is coming 16th out of 89,000 is also named Teeza.  Clearly, it is the footballing pedigree that I share with him that allows us to tip with clarity, wisdom and foresight.  In the same way that Lonhro (until last race) sprinted away from his opposition, so Tehan will loom up at the 400m mark to streak away to another famous victory, a la the time when I potted seven consecutive balls at the Great Northern to beat Bangas in pool.  Now that I think about it, it may well have been on Moe's birthday last year - we should celebrate the one-year anniversary of such a dominant performance.  Yours in insightful football analysis,  Tehahn.

       Craig Stevens: “F--- Thorpie”    This has been writen by a friend from my old cricket club "The Tigers", I thought you guys would enjoy this interesting prespective on the Stevens Thorpie saga.   Australian swimmer Craig Stevens has announced his intention to swim in the 400m freestyle at Athens, ensuring Ian Thorpe will miss his chance at a gold medal in his pet event.   “F--- Thorpie,” Stevens told thebladder.com. “I know he’s much more likely to win gold than me, but he was disqualified from the event. So, f--- him.”   Stevens went on to say that those who were calling for him to stand aside and let Thorpe race could “go f--- themselves.”   “F--- the fans, f--- Australian swimming, f--- Forbes Carlisle and f--- you too,” he said. “F--- Ray Martin and the rest of the f---ing hacks in the media. I may not be a medal chance, but I qualified and I’m going to swim.”   Asked if his long time friend Thorpe had offered any words of advice, Stevens said: “Thorpe’s just a f--king two faced hack. He’s all like ‘ooh, Craig has to decide for himself’, because he knows damn well that everyone else in the country is in his corner. Well, f--- him and f--- them too.”   Stevens went on to claim that Thorpe had been holding him back for years, and insisted that Thorpe step down from the 1500m in Athens. “I am the future of Australian swimming, Thorpe’s just an overrated hack with mutant feet,” he said. “I’m sick of pretending we’re great mates. Ever since he got disqualified, he’s been nothing but a f---ing sooky la la about the whole thing. But when the media's around, it's all: I'm over it already. My arse he is.”   “I’ll step down from the 400m when Stephen Bradbury gives back his f---ing gold medal from the winter Olympics. Huh, how about that? He got lucky and so did I. I didn’t see the Aussie media getting all upset about that.   “How you lika me now?” he added.  Signing Off - Bangas

       Foresight   Myles, I am sure foresight will enable you to determine a good and bad grandfinal. For example, last years GF was a bad one because Brisbane & Cwood were in it. Obviously a one sided encounter. Lets say Brisbance & say St Kilda were the GF'ists this year, now that would be a cracker - good GF. Only exception is if by some miracle Richmond get in the GF. That is a must tape whether good or bad.  Friday is a slow affair today. Nobody in, coffee not working, & homework interferring with work, making my days hell. I wish not to complain but rather ponder a life without this hassle. I only have 2 months until this life of leisure will be available to me and I can't tell you how much I am looking forward to it.  I have a cricket presentation night tonight, a night which will consist of me winning nothing for one of the first times in history. There is always next year, or I could go back & play golf. Hear there is more money & trophies in it.  Must go, enjoy your day & I will add that I have picked 8 winners this week so please do not be disheartened when I take the lead in the footy tipping once again.  Signing Off - Bangas

      Bangas,  I promise that I will tape the grand final if it is a good one.  However, it is very difficult to work out  before  the grand final if it is good...  My brilliant logic wins the day again.  Tough tipping round again - time for the Tehahn cream to rise to the top.  That is all - clearly my crunch time is lacking a little bit of crunch.

       "Limited time to give to Blogger"   I apologise, I am finding it hard to find the time to get to blogger. Very busy in the Tehahn called "crunch time". Finding out that kryptonite is starting to get a hold of my super human powers and contributing to my continued fatigue.  In other news I have found it quite disturbing that George W-yah has had to apologise for the actions of his soldiers and not himself. He states "theis does not represent America". I think it is a pretty damn correct dipiction of their arrogance and behaviour over the last 2 years.    Army abuse: Bush appears on Arab TV   May 6, 2004 - 8:37AM      US President George W Bush told a sceptical Arab world today that the actions of soldiers who mistreated Iraqi prisoners "don't represent America" and pledged that "justice will be served."    In other news, Prue and I have booked our tickets overseas, so it is done now, we are leaving you guys for a while. I know you guys are sad but hey, it won't be for too long. I have a request though, I need someone to tape the footy grandfinal if it is a good one.  Signing Off - Bangas

      I have very little to say, yet I feel obliged to write if only to fill up space.  Unlike Apple, those of us who have a gruelling full university load are beginning to enter what I like to call "crunch time".  I have also christened it "the business end".  It is at this stage of the year when I do more work outside uni than I do at uni (where I have a hectic 11 hours).  I also have a joke for you all, courtesy of my (filthy) cousin:  What is 6.9? Great sex interrupted by a period.  Filth.  See youse all on Friday (when I say all, I don't mean Bangas).  P.S. I am retiring from football tipping until the AFL uses four goal umpires.  Absolute travesty.

       Where has all the blog gone?   What's going on lads, where has all the blog gone? No-one seems to be writing this week, have you all finally knuckled down for the last month of uni, have you settled in for a long winter of coffee and bickies at the desk, staring at your homework with hazy eyes?  It's raining outside, Melbourne winter weather sux. I'm thinking of moving back to Shepparton, we have great winters up there, I love them. Warm winter days, with the breeze in your face and sun on your back at day and the warmth of a toastie open fire on your back at night. Aaaaahhhh.  Anyways, enough about the weather. You may or may not be aware of the crazy new virus going around called Sasser, anyways, if you've not read about it, you should, latest news at theage.com.au. Other than that I've not much else to say, except that Friday night should be a cracker and Bangas it is dissapointing that you won't be there!

       Football   Go Tiges! F... talking about something different the Tiges got up! Up yours Hawthorn, at least you are not on the bottom of the ladder, Collingwood is hahahahahahahahahahahaha!  I am a little pissed off about the footy tips though. How can 3 games be decided by 1 point - 2 of which I lucked out on, in 1 week of footy. Unhappy.  Also, I would like to voice my pleasure in seeing the lions go down, heartbreaking isn't it Tehahn & the catters and demons demolishing their opposition. I don't know what has got into Daniher's men, they are playing well above themselves at the moment and to be sitting pretty in 2nd position is unbelievable. I am on their bandwagon now, go demons!  As for the weekend, I need a holiday from watching or listening to too many close games.   Signing Off - Bangas

       This one's for you Ben   Well well well what a big week it has been in football. The End. Football is hereby banned for this week.   Instead I propose that we challenge ourselves to discuss some new subjects, things we would otherwise never have bothered with, just for some fun. Here are some ideas.  European handball, crochét, learning the greek alphabet backwards, naked yoga, the handicap olympics, fish, the way coke feels fuzzy on your toungue when you take a big mouthfull and then how good the burp feels when you let it rip, japanese tea ceremonies, talcum powder, the three toed sloth, polka music festivals, laxitives, striped pyjamas, big brother and little sister, teeny weeny incy wincy yellow polka dot bikinis, elmo and grover, shave your head, swing whilst you're winning, parachute out of a perfectly good aeroplane, sperm, play scrabble, ball lightning, spontaneous self combustion, metatheria, bald tyres,  frappacinno drinking, trekking through the amazon in a pair of thongs, driving a ferrari in reverse on a one way street, jump on your bed give it up to the crowd wave your hands in the air and sing along loudly to your favourite song whilst shaking it around like your just don't care, bake a cake, kiss a frog, write a poem, smoke a bubble pipe, sail around the world, acupuncture, large spoons, trichogramma, botox, falling leaves, the labrynth, be nice to strangers, learn to juggle, wear odd socks, pinch yourself, smile and be extra happy for no good reason, have an afternoon nap, give someone a copy of your favourite book, cane toads, beetroot, anything.  What Im trying to say is that we should live a little and learn about something new or try something different, variety as they say is the spice of life and though the football is quite entertaining it would be fun I think to hear what you guys have to say about any of these topics or any of your own.   Blog away... I'd love to see how kooky you fella's can be, write something short, something super long or just throw some ideas around like I have, whatever you post this week just make it interesting.  Have a good week, it was good to see everyone in one place on Friday night, I miss our get-togethers, if nothing else the soccer was good for keeping in touch. TTFN.

      Like the new format? I worked oh-so hard to design* it, so I hope you appreciate my efforts. I have played around with the blogger settings also. As you can see by my example there is a new field for both a title and a website link if you feel so inclined. I have provided a link to a site I stumbled across the other day to set the standard.  Also there is now a "comments" section, here you can click and place a quick comment, either as a member or anonymously. Such comments could be as follows...  MYLES: Your parma review was both entertaining and informative. Thankyou.  KIERAN: I agree with you. The Richmond theme song is excellent. Thankyou for your post.  MICHAEL: Only you would provide such brilliant news as coles online. Thankyou for this information.  BANGAS: Glad you got on the bandwagon early. Seats are filling fast. Thankyou for your enthusiasm.  Please Note: Comments do not always have to be so polite. But I'm in a good mood.  One more thing: We can now have a profile each. Please update your profile whenever you have a chance so others who stumble across our website (it is now on the site-listing on blogger by the way) can see who we are. On that, perhaps you should be a little non-descript... or you could just bullshit completely if you like. I have.  * "Design" actually refers to the fact that I selected a fancy template from a list of 25 others.

       Tiges Theme Song   I really love Richmond's song.  Even reading it to myself just then (thanks to Banga's post) really got me going... for were from tigerland...   Only time I don't like that song is if it's played after a Richmond v Essendon game, but that doesn't happen often so it's okay!  Also, work is boring...just had lunch.  Looks to be another tough week with the tipping.  I see that I'm falling further and further behind.  Oh well.

      Skinny Dog Parma - a review  Your reviewer walked into the Skinny Dog in a high sense of excitement.  Local knowledge meant that he entered not from the standard entrance, but rather a smaller entrance closer to the dining room.  This allowed an insight into the tight-knit, welcoming community that is the Skinny Dog parma brigade.  A good start, to be sure.  Better was to come.  Your reviewer's dinner companion knew one of the barmen, and as a result we received free drinks all night.  Sadly, your reviewer was driving, so had to settle for a couple of quiet lights.  Nonetheless, free light beers taste almost as good as a free heavy, so nothing lost there.  But now to what you have all read down this far for - the parma.  Did not have to wait too long for the parma to come after ordering, which was a surprise.  It was surprising because once the parma arrived, I guessed that they must have had to undertake urgent genetic research in order to join two chickens together to create it.  Put simply, it was enormous.  At first, though, I was slightly disappointed.  The only side dish was salad.  Or so I thought.  After a couple of bites of the chicken, I realised that the chips were in fact hidden  under  the parma.  A devious move, but an excellent surprise.  I likened it to the chocolate that sits at the bottom of Cornetto cones, and still gives me a little thrill to this day.  The parma itself had a full and complete covering with tomato and cheese, though no ham (which would have given it the #1 rating in that survey).  To be truthful, I think the lack of ham is a bonus.  For one, it allows Jewish people to experience the delight that is this parma.  I can hear the entire suburb of Elsternwick revving their engines to trek to Kew now.  But look, it is easy to say that the chicken was good, the tomato was good, the cheese was good, the chips were good.  As I like to say: "A champion team will always beat a team of champions".  In the case of this parma, the sum of its parts managed to combine with what I like to call x-factor to come up with a brilliant meal.  If you have read this far, I would hope that your tastebuds are saying "take me to the Skinny Dog, take me to the Skinny Dog".  I can only agree.  A stellar parma indeed; I am willing to say the  best parma I have ever had the privilege to eat .  Big words, I know (one of them has 9 letters), but completely justified.  In the words of Molly Meldrum - do yourself a favour, and eat this parma.  P.S. The cost of a parma is $16, but you would happily pay twice that for this meal.

      This is madness. What has happened to the familiar old blog? This will take some getting used to...  Acerbic = sour, bitter, harsh in taste, etc.  Now, I must introduce you all to my all time favourite website (apart from this wonderful blog). Get ready to be introduced to www.colesonline.com.au.  This is incredible. They deliver to your door for the small fee of $5.00. Nominate a two-hour window and they will appear. Simply login and shop away. You can save personal lists for quickfire shopping, taking the away the stress of walking up and down aisles. Tehan, you will appreciate that you can sort items by price per unit, eg dollars per 100g. This may take the fun out of manual calculations (eg 43 cents per can of Coke) however it is gold for the shopper nerd amongst us.  I am yet to actually commit to buying, but I have prepared a list or two. Very tempting to take it that step further. I'm sure you all understand the hectic life I lead and every second I can save is very valuable. This could just be the find of a lifetime. Bangas, even if you don't use it, I can highly recommend it as the sort of thing a public servant could while away his time on.  As a side note, you may be interested to hear that 50 Cent, the rapper, was struck by some water (not contained in a bottle or any hard vessel) while on stage. One would think this is something you could ignore, even appreciate (given how hot it gets on stage). But no. Our 50 Cent removed his gold chain (no doubt very large) and passed it off to a friend before jumping in the crowd and starting a fight with the guy who sprayed him with water. Now that is a rock star.  Peace out.

      Gentlemen,  You will notice that my brilliant computer skills have allowed me to change the name under which my witty, and sometimes acerbic, posts appear.  I have nothing to say - I am about to go to the Skinny Dog Hotel for a parma: it was voted the second best in Melbourne by the guys who did that massive survey.  I will let you know my thoughts tomorrow.  For now, I will let you all go and look up the word acerbic in the dictionary.  From the artist formerly known as myles

       I Happy Tigers Supporter - Tigers Back on Track!    "Oh, we're from Tigerland, A fighting fury, we're from Tigerland, In any weather you will see us with a grin, Risking head and shin, If we're behind then never mind, We'll fight and fight and win.  For we're from Tigerland, We'll never weaken 'til the final siren's gone. Like the Tigers of old, We're strong and we're bold. For we're from Tiger yellow and black, For we're from Tigerland." (Sung with Gusto!)   I would like to add that I am firmly back on the band wagon after taking a brief step off it to abuse Danny. I believe if the rest of the season is a wet one we will do alright because our wet weather football is second to none.   Could not break away from the rest of you guys in the footy tipping this week. I will however be making my move in the coming weeks so watch out for the wounded tiger because you have seen what us tigers can do when we are down and out. We bounce back and steal the show.  Go Tigers!  In other news......I hope you all spoiled your mother's on mothers day and also.......I pranked called a number of you guys last night in my state of boredom. Very Funny although I did not appreciate Kizza picking up as it cost me money. Bas...d. However I did think it was extremely funny when Tehahn called me back and it cost him money. You win some and lose some.  Signing Off - Bangas  PS:// New format of Blogger - I like it.

      My failure to tip Richmond this week will be my downfall. A tough week to tip guys particularly the opening game. I have decided that the game of tipping in 2004 is a stressful exercise and that if we don't get some easier rounds to tip I am going to skip the country. hahahahaha  Fantastic going on holidays isn't it.  I look forward to catching up for the game on Saturday night. You guys may be watching the game but what I will be doing is watching the scoreboard because I hear they will be having a Richo Goal Count up on the big screen all game. I have tipped Essendon however my allegiances lie with the Catters.   Now let us all hail Richo!  Signing Off - Bangas

      Tehan, I hope for the sake of all of us that the creation of those acronyms took a signifcant amount of time. And I am talking in units of hours rather than minutes or seconds. Unbelievable. Your criticism of my acronym is also unfair - it does flow, but does not constitute a grammatically correct sentence. There should really be a comma after guru.   I just saw Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Great movie - I highly recommend, although it is a little freaky.   Now, I don't think any of you realise that I have a cousin called 'Lop' (I don't really, but bear with me). I saw him/her the other day, and spontaneously said 'glance the gun, lop'. Seeing that the glancing of the gun didn't actually do anything (or mean anything) I commanded lop, who was holding a rubber g-string in his hand, to 'engage, thong, pull!'  Then I walked past a lightswitch and thought 'glance the plug on'. So I did.  Fairly impressive anagrams if I do say so myself.  Now, I don't want to spoil the fun, but I thought you laid down the six-acronyms as a bit of a competition so I deliver to you now:   These Omnipotent People Give Useless News .  ...to the stellar collection of fruit available before the game:  the orange papayas gave unmatched nourishment  to the players.  ... the original plan garnered unusually nice  feedback from the team, and worked a treat.  ... three of Peter's goalkickers understand understand nous  as a concept; they run around like headless chooks most of the time.  ...If I could end by saying that  this original post gravely undermines normality .   ...Bangas in the game of scrabble). Let me just say about Scrabble (rather obviously) that  truly 'onest players give "unplait" normal  meaning, rather than cheat their way to an undeserved victory.

      Moses,  The idea of an acronym is not to merely think of a word that starts with each letter, as you (only just) managed to do.  What you're looking for is something like this:  These Omnipotent People Give Useless News.  In other events,  The Stars football team had a well-deserved moral victory over Kendall on Sunday.  For those of you who weren't there, we didn't score all day, until we kicked a goal after the final siren.  Everyone swarmed on the field, hoisted the goalkicker on to their shoulders and sang the song.  Kendall, who had  technically  won by 12 goals, stood speechless, trying to figure out if they had won or lost.  The moral victory is put down to the stellar collection of fruit available before the game: the orange papayas gave unmatched nourishment to the players.  Many of the great stars plans came into play, including the braveheart (for the uninitiated, it involves lining up your entire team across half-back for the centre bounce, and then charging into the centre square as the ball is bounced).  This original plan garnered unusually nice feedback from the team, and worked a treat.  Watched the Hawthorn vs Freo game - Peter Schwab, despite a win, has some severe problems with his team.  To start with, only three of Peter's goalkickers understand nous as a concept; they run around like headless chooks most of the time.  If I could end by saying that this original post gravely undermines normality.  If you look closely, you will find the acronym t.o.p.g.u.n used 6 times.  Happy searching - I'll reveal them on Thursday, if no one spots them beforehand.  I'm sure you all will, though: I have faith in your abilities (although I don't trust Bangas in the game of scrabble).  Let me just say about Scrabble (rather obviously) that truly 'onest players give "unplait" normal meaning, rather than cheat their way to an undeserved victory.

      My march towards footy tipping glory continues onward. While not fairing so brilliantly in our little comp (OK, second), at work you will be pleased to hear I am on 46 and tied for the lead with one other person. Incredible.   Athol, regarding your previous posts, you have too many ideas in that little head of yours (albeit not a flat head at the back).

      Here's something that should keep you busy for those procrastinating moments over the coming hectic period of study. I put out the challenge, the top gun challenge; to come up with an acronym for top gun, similar to the one I have created in the title bar. Perhaps an acronym of 'challenge' would be good as well, or better still, (and myles you'll probably be the only one excited about this), an anagram of 'top gun challenge' would be awesome. Happy wording.

      Hello Boys  I hope everyone enjoyed their weekends. Bangas, it sounds like you had a good trip, but if you're going to claim scrabble superiority, then I suggest you learn to spell. (Look over your recent post). Also mate you missed a great session of footy watching on Friday night, we should do it again soon. Especially now that Moses has joined the ranks of crazy footy fans and began to take much more interest in proceedings.   The tipping was once again an impressive affair, I still happily wear the yellow guernsey as leader but must say that the next few weeks will sort us out for sure. This week is probably going to be the hardest week thus far to tip.  One more thing... RICHO YOU LITTLE BEAUTY !!!

       Life if a highway & I want to ride it all night long.   That is what it was like on the trip up to & back from Adelaide. Well not quite, it is a bloody long way to Adelaide & both Prue & I were & still are buggered.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Moey for letting me know Richo had kicked 10 goals and in doing so stear the Tigers to victory.  Secondly I would like to make mention of a game called scrabble. Scrabble is a game which you well know I am a master. My skills were again tested as I took on Aleisha Robertson who scored in the 99's as a number of you boys did. Prue decided not to play as she knew of the embarrassment she would endure as she lost yet another encounter against I. Aleisha plays a hard game but once again I dominated in the first encounter & than again in the rematch. I demolished the respect once shown to Aleisha as I did you guys on New Years. I am a champion, the heavy weight champion & have now set my sites on a fellow creditable scrabble player who also scored in the 90's - Seb. Seb has a lot of experience & likes to own the scrabble board when he plays. As a champion I am not daunted by this opponent but wish him luck as I will be playing harder and fiercer than ever. No passangers here.  I will leave by saying - James Hird is a sook! Which I am guessing will encite some debate.  Signing Off - Bangas

      Bangas: You raise a very valid point. Why do Richmond have to travel half way across the country one week and then all the bloody way across it the next week? It really doesn't seem like common sense to me. The guy who decides the draw is probably the guy who decided that the umpires would be best suited to wear yellow when officiating in a game involoving the hawks. What the hell is going on with the AFL?  Quiting: The resignation of CEO Campbell from the Tiger line up is probably for the best. As I understand it he cetainly was not pushed and left because his heart was not in it. And my friends we all know that unless you enjoy doing something there ain't much use being there doing it. Good decision. A better appointment of a CEO is now required by the Richmond board.  Tipping: I continue to lead the tipping competition and am making the bold statement that by the end of the week I will still be leading. Go Short-Man Go.  Drinks: Tonight I believe Mick will be hosting a footballing get together for the excitement that is the pressure cooker game; Essendon vs Freo. Not only will it be a big clash but it will be viewed with SCYCAM. GET THERE! WOOOHHHOOOOO.

      Rex, I have been trying to download a picture of He-Man from Hello to the Blogger site but am have trouble. I complete the process however when I go to log in there is a system era that comes up. And then when I go to access it via the desk top it can't find the document. Let me know if you can give me any advice on how to fix it.  On the other hand, the Tigers have a big road trip for the second week in a row. Not happy, how can you one week travel to Adelaide and than follow it up with a road trip to Perth. What was the AFL thinking. I think it will be a miracle if the Tigers got up but I am not losing hope.  There are a few games that may go either way: Essendon v Fremantle (although Jimmy Hird is back) Sydney v Western Bulldogs (@ the SCG, if only the doggies could kick straight) Brisbane v Melbourne (depleted Lions line up, will they drop 2 in a row?) Hawthorn v Adelaide (Tail end of the competition, Hawks will do it for Thomo)  I would like to advise everyone that it will be my Birthday next Friday and as usual on a Friday after work I will be having drinks. I am thinking @ this stage the Brandon Hotel. A very nice pub on the corner of Lee & Station St. Stay tuned to blogger for further details.   Review/ Face Off - Even after the third to fourth time of watching this movie I still get a kick out of it especially the final scene in the Church and the boat chase. Fantastic spectacle and a very intense battle between two of the best in the business Cage & Travolta. I still, to this day, believe Travolta should have killed his daughter after he shot him.   Review (2)/ Reservoir Dogs - A fantastic sound track, movie not as great. You can see that this film was the inspiration of such films as Lock stock & 2 smoking barrels & snatch. The movie is cut up in pieces providing little insights into the story of how all these gangsters come together in a finale that involved lots of guns and a lot of blood. Wasn't bad, but wasn't great, worth watching for the soundtrack or even better, just listen to the soundtrack.  Signing Off - Bangas

      Good observation on TopGup Tehahn. The reason I put it in there was to test how long until you bastards decided to contribute to the Blogger site. It took over a week! Get your act together lads.

       What another big week in football. ©Eddy McGuire.   Well the short man jumped ahead of the pack this week in the tipping. Michael, Bangas and Teeza try ever so desperately to catch up by tipping outsiders and Kieran can't get his head out of the books long enough to enter any decent tips at all. Poor bastard. I can't complain though, I will be happy to revel in my own delight when the rest of you shout me drinks and dinner at the GN when I take out the competition.  In other news I have decided to have a birthday bbq/drinks night. Though it will be the middle of winter I still think it will be fun, especially considering that the house-warming never got off the ground. Perhaps it can be a combo party, we'll see what happens. Whatever the case, keep the night of the 25th of June free, it is the day of my birthday and conveniently enough a Friday also. Yeehaa.  Oh and may I say thankyou very much to those who participated in the acronym challenge. Despite the wailings of one surly individual who we shall call only Mr.BB, the challenge was a success, with particularly impressive efforts from Mylesy. Good job Teeza. Stay tuned for the next challenge, coming to you soon from the short man with too many ideas in his head.

      I wish only to write one thing - Bangas, your acronym from last Thursday actually spelt TOPGUP.  That's all from me, except to say that I will tip 8 winners this week.

      Thank you for all the Birthday wishes, I have been overwhelmed by all the text messages and emails and phone calls. I have to admit that I did expect it as I am a very popular man. Or should I say a very popular He Man.  I would also like to comment on the current blogger heading - I like it!  Signing Off - Bangas

      I would like to say that I am 24 today, contrary to the belief of all of you who think I am 44. They say 24 - 27 is the best time of your life. I have no reason to disagree with that.  I noticed one of my fellow bloggers - Tehahn (Gangster name - Phanta) joked about not turning up. Might I add I don't really care if nobody turns up because all I need is the bottle. You know I make my own fun especially when I have beer by my side.  I will be trying out my new digital camera tonight. I am a very lucky guy to have a girlfriend with the ability to gain funds from her family & my family as well as save enough out of her own funds to buy me such an extravagant gift.   On that note, I look forward to taking many pictures of you all drinking beer tonight at the Brandon Hotel. AFL footy is boring tonight - Collingwood v West Coast, so there is no excuse for not turning up.  Signing Off - Bangas   PS:// I don't believe your story of events over the death of Benji. Reasons: 1. Gato's finger prints would have been all over the gun and the Coppers would have been able to notify that it was Gato's gun.  2. If Gato shot him in self defence and he was not holding a gun how did he shot him. 3. Phanto, you were not there, how do you know what happened. I suppose your information comes from a credible source.

         Dominic 'Mick' Gatto  Mick 'the Don' Gatto, a fellow who runs an "arbitration and mediation service", is a lynchpin of the Melbourne underworld.  His favourite forms of arbitration and mediation are via use of excessive force.  He was a supporter of the now extinct Moran family, who had a massive rivalry with Carl 'Babyface' Williams (more on him in coming weeks).  However, Mick has recently been waylaid by a pesky murder charge over the death of Andrew "Benji" Veniamin.  Here's the inside story, as Phanta heard it:  Benji and Babyface had spent the morning at the Melbourne Magistrates' Court, sitting in on the hearing of an application by police to get DNA from Victor Brincat.  Now Victor "no nickname" Brincat is facing trial for the murder of Michael Marshall (and was arrested on the Phanta's own turf - at the Elsternwick Hotel).  More importantly, however, No Nickname is also the major suspect for the murder of Mick Gatto's close friend Jason Moran.  So...Benji and Babyface leave the Magistrates' Court (where Brincat escaped having to give DNA) and decide, elated with the result, to go and give Mick a bit of shit.  They go to the restaurant where he eats every day (La Porcella) and Babyface waits in the car while Benji runs inside to give him shit.  But while Benji ran inside at a rapid rate, his exit was a fair bit slower - it's very difficult to run quickly when you're deceased and in a bodybag.  But the question - what happened in La Porcella?  Mick suggested to Benji (who is not the sharpest tool in the shed) that they have a discussion out the back, away from the customers.  So they go out the bank, Mick pulls out a firearm, shoots Benji twice (in the eye and throat), but then realises that it wasn't the smartest thing to do.  So, he puts his gun in Benji's (dead) hand, aims at where he had been standing, and shoots the wall.  Then, he waits for the cops, and tells them that he shot Benji (twice) in self-defence, and that the bullethole in the wall is evidence to support his claim that Benji shot at him first.  You heard it here first.  Thus ends the first instalment of the Chronicles of Phanta.  Next week: Graeme "The Munster" Kinniburgh.

      Like Splinter, I am now as flash as a rat with a gold tooth.  Bought a digital camera today - small, black, stellar (I call it David Rodan).  In other news, I forgot my USA visa interview - woke up at 9:30 (which was when the interview was about to start).  Very impressive.  Got mum to drop me in, and they didn't have any problems with me.  Love those Yanks.  In response to Moses' post, I also received an invitation to Bangas' drinks via Short Message Service on my mobile cellular device.  It would be unbelievably humourous if nobody turned up.  I can just picture poor old Bangas standing alone at the bar, saying "Maybe Moe was right.  I should have used the skywriting".  Also Moe, the public servant who was John Howard's Chief of Staff (now an executive with Macquarie) is Max Moore-Wilton (aka Max the Axe).  Sensational nickname.  Rivalled only by Dan the Man as a generic first name-nickname combo.  Clearly, I should be studying - hence my willingness to procrastinate.  I am going to do another post in one minute, beginning my "Gangster of the Week" contribution to the blog.  By the way Athol, if you're going to do a radio show like I remember you mentioned, I am more than willing to be "Underworld Correspondent", but you will have to refer to me by my underworld nickname - Phanta (mysterious like a PHANTom, memory of an elePHANT).

      Bloody hell. I think Bangas has found a new calling in life. Give up that desire to one day become chief public servant in the mould of Max the Axe (that was his name, wasn't it Tehan?). No, Mr Bainbridge should become a publicist. How many forums does one need to advertise a get together. I look forward to the skywriting: 'Bangabirthdaybrandonfriday'. I would imagine it would cost a shitload for that many letters.  Only joking, Bangas. Of course we wouldn't want to get the wrong date for your birthday - that would be terrible. Who could ever forget the birthday of a mate?   Footy tipping update  I know you are all sitting on the edge of your seat every time you check the blog after the weekend to check how old Moe is doing in the footy tipping. I have great pride in telling you I wrested the lead back from my colleagues at work and sit joint first on 58 tips correct. Now, to not crumble under the pressure...   Other news  Have none. Study is the flavour of the day/week/month.

       Event:   Bangas' Birthday Drinks  Where:   The Brandon Hotel, Carlton (Cnr Station & Lee St)  When:   Friday, 4 June 2004  Time:   As soon as you can get there after work. (Nb:// Julia & I will be walking there after work)  Entertainment:   Robbie Williams (Known as Ryza) & side kick (Known as Julia) Also Sonia Dada may make a fleating appearance.   A little bit about the venue:  The Brandon Hotel is a fine drinking establishment recently taken over by Maggie's (Margie's Boy) mates.  The Brandon reminds me of a little pub in Newbridge, has that small town feel about it. A real traditional Aussie Pub. The front bar menue is very affordable. $10 pub grub.  Also, Jacko (Wheres Wally?) is often seen there however never really seen anywhere else. Gin & Squash is served there.  I'll see you there.  Signing Off - Bangas

      It is indeed a sad day when study takes up so much of our time that the blog is monopolised by Bangas as an advertorial posting board.  Never fear - I have had a premonition that Athol is about to post a blog about study. Call me nostradamus.

      Hi fellow Topgunners.  Don't forget, today is Prue's Birthday so make sure you send her a line.   (Imagine picture of plane flying in the sky writing out  "HAPPY BIRTHDAY PRUE" ). Sorry guys, I couldn't quite book the real thing because of bad weather.  Prue has an exam today from 2 - 4:30 and than we will be having dinner with the family at the Brunswick Sporting Club, which might I add, has a fantastic menu and good beer. We will be having an early dinner, around 6:30. After than, we will be having a drink as you do on birthdays. I am not sure where at this stage (maybe at the comfy chair) but please feel free to come by for a quick drink as I know you guys have exams to prepare for.   I let you know of where the venue for drinks are, I'm sure Prue will send a message out anyway.  Signing Off - Bangas

      Hey Gang.  Firstly, I would like to say that I am looney. But I feel better about it when I am hangin out with you other looney bastards. So the motto of the story is, lets all get together soon... How's this sound?  THE MYLES AND ATHOL AND END OF EXAMS EXTRAVAGANZA. (And Bangas?)   Friday Night: 25th June  The Oxford Scholar: Swanston Street  Come for a meal anytime or come later on to have a quiet drink.  Come to help wish Myles a safe and successful trip to America.  Come to help Athol celebrate his 22nd Birthday.  Come to help Bangas tie up just a few more loose ends.  Do not remind Bangas how good looking he is. He Knows.  Come to relax and enjoy that end of semester and exams feeling.   Come to do any combination or none if you wish of the above things. Just feel welcome to join and tell everyone you know who might be interested that they are welcome to do the same.  Seeya Gang.  From the Short Man.

      Do yourselves a favor and go see Shrek 2. I don't want to give too much away apart from the fact that it was very well done and received by the audience on night 1. A must! Andy rated it 5 stars.  Shrek 2 is more tailored to an adult audience rather than the children but the kids still will get a lot out of this one. Amazing how cartoons have changed - they work on so many different levels and audiences these days. Far cry from the Bugs Bunny days. Graphics are fantastic and the movie itself will have you in hysterics.   Also, a hint - Do not leave the cinema while the credits are still running.  Bangas rating: A cool 4.5 stars. I have to leave myself some leeway.     Signing Off Bangas

      I will be posting a review on Shrek 2 tomorrow if Prue & I don't get knocked back a ticket tonight at Crown like we did last night for Troy. We will be lining up in about an hours time to make sure we score tickets to the showing at 7 - 8pm.  In other news:  * "Bangas found by world to be most good looking........again". Bangas is reknowned around the world to be the most good looking male to ever walk the earth. His popularity astounds many. How can such a nice guy also be that good looking!  * "Tehahn - I am the most enthusiastic at sport, so why am I not good at it". Those words were uttered by Tehahn after having hit another ball into the water at Kingston Links on Saturday.  * "Moey cooks up a storm". What a meal, I was fortunate to experience a very apitising indian dish cooked by the Moe & Andy on Tuesday night. Not only did we eat very good Indian, we also demolished what seemed to be a never ending supply of waffles and ice cream. Quantity & Quality, what more can you ask for.

      In a bold move, seemingly to counter the affect of hype surrounding new appointments to the Labor Party, the National's have made moves to recruit rival Oz Rocker James Blundell. James could only be quoted as saying 'I'm just livin'and a workin' on the land'. This reporter suspects that things could get nasty.  urlLink

      Given that our roving reporter has not filed a 'Gangster of the Week' story for a couple of weeks, I think it is fair to assume that he has become the latest victim of the underworld war. RIP Phanta. Either that, or he has not been able to continue living following his disgraceful performance on the golf course the other day.  In light of a lack of other posts, I will now provide a brief summary of important news that I know none of you will be aware of given your current posture of 'arse in the air, head in the books'.  * Damien Peverill  was fined $3500 for pushing over fatty Dr Connell. Half of the fine went to charity, the other half went to Telstra Dome groundsmen who had to repair the crater during the half time break.  * George Bush still plans on handing over Iraq to a democratically elected local government on June 30.  * It is Amanda Leen's birthday today, 16 June 2004. She is 22.  * Athol is still short. Tehan still has a large head. Whitty still has an afro. Bangas still thinks he is good looking. I am still fat (I am willing to lie for the sake of humour - self depreciating humour I think it is called).  Good luck to those with exams (and those pretending to tie up loose ends at work before they leave on their travels). I'm sure with all this study that one day you will all be as smart as me (this time, the humour is sarcasm).  Mick.

      Bangas & Prue will be having farewell drinks on Tuesday, 29 June 2004. We will be drinking at a different pub than the usual locals we find ourselves at in Brunswick and Carlton. We have decided on a place in Greville St, Prahran called "The College Lawn Hotel". This place will no doubt open your eyes up to a different culture of drinking and good times.  Built in the late 1800's, The College Lawn is situated in one of Melbourne's most fashionable precincts. The hotel features a Lounge Bar, Restaurant, Vinyl Lounge Public Bar, Bottleshop and two sundrenched courtyards.   Beers on Tap include: Becks, Guinness, James Squire Pilsner, Tooheys New, Tooheys Old, Hahn Premium Light, Hahn Premium, Carlton Draught.   Website:http://www.collegelawnhotel.com.au/index.htm   So come all to the College Lawn and enjoy a final beer with Ben and Prue before they head off on a trip of a life time. Because you will not see Ben for 3 months and Prue for 6-7 month and we know hom much influence we have over all your lives. I am doing some jedi magic as we speak to make sure everyone is there.  Cheers, Bangas & Prue

         That's right, I'm back again.  While many have feared for the safety of your correspondent, Phanta, I have merely been lying low recently.  The latest attempted hit took place in Brighton (very close to the heart of the underworld, the Wick).  While police were very happy to carry on a charade that the intended target was Mario Condello (more on him later), it doesn't take a genius to figure out that the Phanta is right at the top of the list.  As a result, I have been keeping an extremely low profile.  But for the good of the blog, I am prepared (once again) to risk death to report on another gangster.  While I promised in my last report that this time I would talk about Graeme "The Munster" Kinniburgh, recent events would indicate that Carl "Babyface" Williams is a much more relevant subject.  So, without further ado, here is your correspondent's insight into the mystery wrapped inside an enigma that is Carl "Babyface" Williams.  First things first - Carl Williams is an  extremely stupid individual .  He is a product of the Western suburbs, and has a fairly strong criminal pedigree.  His father, George Williams, is currently facing drug charges with Carl.  That's very nice - a father wanting to relate to his son, so commits offences with him.  The Father of Phanta was never so accommodating in my youth.  Now, Babyface got himself in a bit of trouble with a few rash comments about other members of the underworld.  Yet his biggest mistake came in the aftermath of those comments.  As you would expect, and as he deserved, he was shot in 1999 in his ample gut.  Yet instead of keeping silent, as all good gangsters should, he cried out "No, Jason" as he was shot.  Jason, of course, is the now deceased Jason Moran.  As payback, Babyface ordered the deaths of Mark Moran, Jason Moran and Pasquale Barbaro.  It is a reflection on Babyface's character that he did not accept the punishment that he deserved, and instead decided to initiate a cycle of violence that continues to this day.  Carl also ordered the recent hit on Mario Condello, but it was foiled.  Fair dinkum, the coppers have got every car, phone and home of anyone who could be a gangster bugged, yet Babyface still thinks it is a sensible ploy to arrange killings over the phone.  Then again, as he has been banned from the casino and all of the licensed premises in the South Melbourne, St Kilda and Armadale districts, he is finding it difficult to obtain a location from which he can do business.  The detention facilities at Barwon Heads Prison will have to do, for now.  A final point - Babyface loves to wear label clothing.  When Andrew "Benji" Veniamin was killed (described in last week's instalment), he was wearing Polo Ralph Lauren.  When he was arrested, he was wearing Gant.  Just the sort of publicity those businesses would desire, I'm sure.  Till next time - I cannot promise a date, as it is safer for me to not have a routine; after all, Mario Condello walked his dog on the same route every morning, and that was where he was going to be shot...  The Phanta.

      What happened to the reignition of the top gun flame? Will we simply sit by and let the last bit of light die out or will we try our best to burn bright?

      Thank you to Moses for reigniting the top gun flame.   For those of us that are still in the country, you may have seen "The Sleek Geeks"tour advertised. If not, you may have heard about it on triple j. Anyways, I have created a link to it in the title, and I suggest you check it out. It is on the 7th of August at Wilson Hall, and is part of a national annual&nbsp;tour by Dr Karl and Adam Spencer. Seeing as how the Melbourne show will be occuring right in our own backyard I think it is&nbsp;a great thing to get along to. Tickets are free, all you have to do is go into an ABC shop or centre and pick some up. I have already done so, but the limit is two per person so that sorted Tommy and myself out. Read the website for more important info about distribution of tickets if you are interested.  To the travelling two, Bangers and Mylesy, we miss you but hope you are having a sensational time on your adventures. Please drop us a line to the blogger and let us know what you are up to.

      So much to tell...  Firstly, the man with the fro picked up last night. However, I have not yet had a chance to talk to him - he did not come home.   Funniest of all, though, is the fact that I have been informed his father made a visit to our house this morning. At about 6.00 am. Whitdog was not about. I don't think Lou could come up with a convincing reason for his absence. Very, very&nbsp;funny. When I find out more details, I will let you all know.  For those of you&nbsp;travelling the world, uni started today. What a joyous occasion.  Weekend action - Brisbane beat Adelaide by 23 goals, Richmond got smashed by Melbourne by ten goals. Essendon will remain unmentioned. I tipped 7 but fell further behind in the work tipping. Now on 97, 3 off the pace. The tension is palpable.  Given that you are reading this, it might be a good opportunity to add a post. Things have been waning. I know that if I was travelling, I would not like to be sitting in an internet cafe punching out boring tidbits like this, but if you get the opportunity, please do.   Stay tuned...

      How can this be, White-y in Love. or is he just looking for a regular shag. No Prue & I are very happy for you Kizza.  It is good to hear from you guys via Blogger. Good to type on him again.  Prue & I just sent an email so read about our travels there.  We caught up with Mylesy last night and drank lots of beer. He is putting up with Bonge's ego very well although Bonge has got good hair, kind of like me with the resciding hair line.  Must go, Bangas

       Kieran   Congratulations. You are clearly excited about your love interest and are MORE THAN HAPPY to broadcast it to the world before it seems you are entirely sure she is your girlfriend:  'I   may   have a new girlfriend' (previous empharsis removed, new empharsis added)  Sometimes, it is good to clear up these uncertainties at the early stages. Although, I suppose I still only think I  may  have a girlfriend (now that truly is a joke, because I know one of you will see some sort of remote truth in that, tell Andy, and then all hell will break loose. I can report I still live in happily partnered bliss). In all seriousness, Kieran, it is good to hear the news, even if it is only by way of electronic communication (even though I live with you).   Everyone else   Now for my weekly update: I was in a state of shock late Saturday night when I realised I had only correctly tipped 2 winners of the five matches that had been played. Adelaide beating North? Sydney beating Brisbane? Fremantle beating Carlton? Unheard of... until this round.  However, my angst abated by Sunday evening when I picked up the last three, tipping a respectable 5 for the round and moving to only 2 tips behind the leader. I approach my destiny with both excitement and trepidation.   The OC  Athol frowns upon it to the extent of cutting short a "boys' night" after only 75 minutes so as not to subject himself to viewing it. I, along with others, believe it is a great show and it should never have been axed over summer. Admittedly the storylines are all very predictable, and the ongoing sexual tension and unrequited love between the two main characters (Chino, aka Ryan, and Marisa, aka hot mama) has been seen before (for example, Dawson and Joey, Pacey and Joey, me and Joey, Romeo and Juliet, Tehan and every single fresher girl under his leadership, etc). Any thoughts on the subject would be appreciated, if only to annoy Athol with its infringement on another part of his life.  Moe (on this occasion, pronounced 'Mow', as in 'Mo', not 'Mao').

      Well, seeing no-one is blogging, I might as well add something to the fire.  It seems that I may have   a new girlfriend  ! Things seem to be going quite nicely with Sophie, but it is only early days yet. However, I think it is pretty safe to say that I have a new lady on the scene!  How's that for news?
