      Today I woke to someone handing me a phone, its was Ian calling me to work for him today, so I did. I got up showered then went down to work, its wasnt very fun, quite boring, no one really showed up but enough little kids were there that we had to stay open all day, better for my next paycheck... I dont know, we talked about trying to get some more people down there, none of our ideas made much sense, or werent legal at all, so we wont try any of them, after work I came home and ate then got online, talked for a little but then I just started watching a Tremors marathon, which consisted of tremors 4 and tremors 3 but, still there funny movies, Im probably going to be online most of the nite, nothing better to do in this house, I was sadly reminded that its been about 4 months and I still havent even attempted to get my permit, not my choice, but still, well thats enough for now, now I wait till a friend gets home, and tells me how Catwomen, and Dodgeball are

       Well today was just another day in my life, in which i accomplished nothing, cept realizing that I need a life, Ive beaten everygame ive ever owned, and lately all of them in under a week, which is sad of course, other than that I managed to get yelled at because my sister decided to try adn take her place as number 1 bitch, so I said something to her along the lines of her death bringing me great happieness, harsh, yes but she really pissed me off. I dont know anymore, Ive been thinking that the less I try in this house to be free, the better, I guess I'll just start doing everything I'm told and no is no, give in, make everyone happy that they won....I hate letting them feel that way, o well, lose my happieness in hopes better times will come...sometimes thats how its got to be, wont be the first time ive done it. well other than that I really didnt do anything today, went to work, but we closed early, but we get paid friday, with my pay of&nbsp; 2.50 an hour, I think my paycheck will be about $50, no to bad.&nbsp; well thats about it, dont got work tomorrow but im getting up early to go for a run, then probably go to the pool for awhile, maybe you should stop down, if its nice out

       Today was like most days, I got up around 10 got ready for work and work got cancelled, so I sat around all day doing nothing,&nbsp;I couldnt do anything today anyways, cause my mom was home and my dad is visiting his parents in Scranton, who knows when he'll be back.&nbsp; Probably be like this all week, maybe the weather will get better and the pool will stay open. Tonight so far hasnt been exciting, talked to someone for awhile, most fun all day, other than that I was just thinking about getting a drink, trying to get rid of liquid refreshments we shoulnt have, Ill let you know how the nite ended tomorrow

       Walking through an empty room watching memories before my eyes thinking about that smile of yours how it always made me smile too  I lay down on the couch thinking of the last time you were here trying to move on tho Im standing still  When I want to be alone I sit down on this couch thinking of that smile of yours and smiling on of my own  Im feeling lost trying to find myself only to open my eyes in this room of memories

      Well, like Ive mentioned a few time before I dont have much time to myself to think, but in the last couple days Ive been thinking, and Ive come to realize something. That is I dont really know who I am...what I do know is this. I spend my days keeping myself busy so I dont spend a lot of time dwelling on a certian past subject, but I always end up thinking about it.  The only time I dont is when Im playing soccer, because when Im on that field I can prove to people Im someone. Out there Im confident, and dont worry about things Ive done, just make up for my mistakes. I dont care what will happen I just do it. Something I cant seem to do off the field. Off the field Im more concerned about everything I do, Im not confident at all.  Im scared... not easy for me to admit, but its true. For what seems like forever now, Ive spent a lot of my time thinking about a past relationship, one that I cant seem to move on from, yet, tho it seems she has. I dont know why, but I cant just give up the fact that I thought things were good, that we were happy. I dont really know what happened, tho on some level I do.  If she reads this I know she probably wont talk to me for a few days, cause that seems to be how it goes.  I dont know.  Soccer season will be fun this year, and Ill work my ass off, cause if people notice me out there, then maybe they will notice me again, somewhere else. Then theres always track season, Ive been more of a competitor lately, tho no one really notices, till they see me ahead, I hope itll be a good year for me and my 300 hurdles. Well, thats all.

      Its hard to say, lately if things are getting better, or worse. Sometimes things will be ok, but most of the time its bad. I seem to be more confused now than I have ever been, too many thoughts in my head, and never enough time to think them all through. Time is moving too fast. I wish I could step out of this life for a moment and think about everything, but I know I cant. I think Im trying to hard to feel like I did once before. Its really just pushing me further down this hole I seem to have fallen in. No matter how hard I try I cant seem to hit bottom, cause atleast when I do, Ill know what I have to do to get back out. Im not telling much of my storie here, because people just seem to pitty, not try to understand. Words arent comming to me now, I cant seem to write a simple sentence, so Ill leave you with the clipnotes version of my little storie, I feel lost, as tho I dont belong here anymore. I guess this is my way of trying to find help.

      Today was one of those days where it starts out at a point in which you wish it was over already, waking up only proved to be more stressfull then all the pain I still felt from the nite before. Walking wasnt an easy task, then work, well work was a bitch, I still couldnt walk very good because all my muscles tensed up, so I was late, and my boss, Dave, had a stick in his ass today. He didnt leave me alone the whole time I was there, always yelling. Then we closed early so I went home, I hid, cause well I didnt want more shit.  Bryson came and he and his dad picked me up, he has his permit now, not really a bad driver. I went to soccer, and well, I dont like a few people there, one inperticular, he doesnt try hard at all, till it counts, which is bull shit, cause the rest of us give it our all, all the time. He said something to me that really pissed me off tho, I let my friends joke with me, but he went to far, so tomorrow, he may end up on the ground for awhile, because he'll slip, really hard. Well other than that, not much has really gone on. Ive realized tho, what drives me to be better now, its not that I think Im good, its that soccer is really the only thing I have right now, and its has to do with me being very pissed off at a lot of stuff, manly myself tho. Its making me better, and soon that drive will be gone, and I'll find something else. Till then, let those who told me I never could, think what they want.

      Well today started out pretty shitty getting yelled at then I had work, which I welcomed. I had to leave work early because I had soccer tonight, Soccer is great, tho all this pain I feel sucks. Its alright now, I guess, everything is numb. Well after soccer I didnt think going home showering and changing would be smart so I changed in the truck and put of lots of deodernt and colone and went to the festival tonight. It wasnt the greatest but it was better than my house. Saw a few people, like Zac, hes cool, a few others, and some more. Again tonight I didnt feel like I should of been there. Tho lately theres so much on my mind the only way I can describe it is to tell you what I see when I close my eyes, and that is that I am falling, I was standing on a cliff, balanced then all of a sudden I feel. If you understand it, let me in on what it means. Tho, Im so cofused lately, I probably wont understand what you say anyways.

      Well, today began like everyother day, kinda, I got up, got ready for work and went to work all day. I didnt feel bad at all, everything was out of me before I went to sleep around 5.  Tho when I got home things took an odd turn, my mother's car was gone, tho she was home, finding out why turned out to be bad idea, the van my sister drives, apparently died, or so I hear. That didnt make my mother happy, nor did the cleaning she decided to do, of course my brother and I got sucked into cleaning. After that, well I didnt do anything cause I, well, I couldnt, plain as that. I didnt go to the festival, which sucked, I missed some of my friends tonight, but I guess theres other nite, Soccer is tomorrow nite, too, thats good. Well, Im online now, and will be probably all nite.

      Tonight wasnt all to bad, till i had that bowl of ceral and puked...a lot. well, it may have been what else i drank too, but i was feeling fine till the milk hit my stomach...lets just say it was an odd nite.  Other than that it was payday, i got like 56 dollars or something, it doesnt seem like a lot but considering my pay is 2.50 an hour, its enough. after that i had to go get some shelf unit and then i went to the festival, it could of been funner, but it wasnt all to bad, saw some friends, talked to a few people. somethings were odd to see, but i wont say anything more about it. When I got home I drank some, and then didnt feel to well, as I metioned before, o well, too late to regret it now. Tho, it wasnt my greatest idea, ever. well thats about all, i still dont feel to well, but im talking to some friends, it makes things better.

Saturday nite was my grandmother's wedding, it was short  and the food was bad...Sunday, well I have work, and its suppose to be nice...what are the chances of the only day I work and it being really nice....there goes my tan...well, im to lazy to post everyday, maybe something will happen and Ill want to post before next weekend, but im guessing not....o yeah soccer starts next monday, I think, that is so awesome to know, I really cant wait

      I just posted, but I got to thinking, soccer is starting soon, and I remembered coach boyle, and coach john(aka coach sexy) telling us how soccer will teach us things we'll need in life, such as teamwork, defeat, respect, then I started realizing how other things would help too, such as not jumping in becuase you'd only get burned, always have someone behind you before challenging something, and something boyle once told us at a game, "someone once told me that there was no such thing as luck, that you used what you had to put yourself into a good situation, you make your own luck, but you got to work hard", I dont know if thas an exact quote but its close enough, It makes a lot of sense if you think about it, Boyle, hes a great coach, I hope he doesnt step down for someone else, well, I just felt like posting this before I forgot

      Well first, I want to explain my post from yesterday, I got dumped like 2 or 3 weeks ago, I cant remember, funny how that works, but yeah, it was hard, I really liked the girl, and well I still do, I hadnt really talked to her in awhile so when she imed me I was excited, it started great till, she asked about this other girl I've been talking to, she asked how it was going, and well I didnt know how to answer cause I like her, but yet I still liked my ex, so what I said she took wrong and said she was sorry for trying to be nice, it pushed me over the edge, and I totaly broke down last nite, and I wrote that when I felt like my heart was ripped from my chest, well after the other girl got offline so did I, I spent 3 maybe 4 hours thinking about everything, coming to the conclusion I still liked my ex, but had to see what could happen with this other girl, so I dont regret never trying, I dont how it sounds to anyone else, but thats how I live....Now for my day, today was boring to say the least, work felt so long, and we even had to stay open an extra 30 minutes cause people didnt understand our situation with the chlorine and we didnt feel like trying to fix the levels so its good for them, so we let them swim for a little while longer then they all left, after I got home, I ate some sausages, or whatever they were, you know, hot dog looking things, they were good, my little cousins came down, they are very annoying so I went out back with my soccer ball, but they followed, after like an hour or two they left, I showered and then got online, I've been on since, probably wont sleep much tonight like usual, but thats ok, no work tomorrow, but I think I'm going shopping, what fun! not really, my mom wants to go cause derek has been bugging her, I dont have much money, so I'll wear what derek buys...all in all it should turn out interesting, always does...I'll just take my cd player and hide in the music

      Today was not so much a great day, sure work was easy, but after I got home the mood changed, after what seemed like a long time, I went out back with my soccer ball, usualy helps blow off stress, after that I did my little workout, and ended up just hurting myself, after that I took a nice long hot shower, and laid down, waiting for my sister to let me back online, so I got on sometime around 12 started talking to a friend, then around 1 sarah got online, and she imed me, but after what seemed to start as a good conversation, I guess I said something stupid like usual, and well maybe what she wrote in her profile was right, maybe she did just waste her time on me, I feel like shit, I didnt even tell her that I missed her but its to late now... So now I guess I'll just fade away like before, no one needs to notice me, its not like too many people do anyways... people deserve better than me,  I havent done anything right in years, I dont know who my friends really are...if only i could of told her I missed her...I just need some to sleep, maybe things will be better tomorrow, another day of work...

        I've lost my way   though this path is not new to me   I've traveled it many times before   but it's different now   without you      In your eyes I found my way   with your smile you showed me truth   your voice carried me softly from disaster   and your kiss kept me going each day    Since I lost sight of you I've stumbled   and fallen      So here I lie and leave my silent plea   for you to find me once again
