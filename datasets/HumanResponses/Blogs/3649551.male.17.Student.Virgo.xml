						   I figure I might as well put the word out there ... I have a few basic beliefs which tend, as such things do, to influence all my other ones. Before you run screaming into the night, I'll lead into things with this statement: I define faith as an extension of reason. I don't believe concepts because they don't make sense. I think about things logically; it's just the way my mind works. And as we all know, we can't KNOW anything for sure, philosophically speaking. So we believe everything we "know," if you catch my drift. This being the case, I believe in God. Let me start by saying why I don't believe in Big Bang, or evolution, or any other such rubbish scientists have tried to push on us. If everything in the universe is cause and effect, and EVERYTHING in existence is bound to cause and effect ... what caused the universe? If something didn't cause it to exist, then some people say it's been around an infinite amount of time. How does that work? I thought that the amount of usable energy in any system decreases over time. If the universe is infinitely old, wouldn't all usable energy be unusable by now? So I think the universe had a beginning. Well, if it had a beginning then something not bound to cause and effect must exist. Something that IS infinitely old. Something that exists, but was not caused ... but was able to cause the universe to be. That's right, an uncaused cause. The term 'supernatural' is useful here: it describes something that isn't bound to natural laws. A Supreme Being, or simply, God. I'm going to say a few more things about scientific theories on the nature of the universe. There are some things that science cannot decide. Scientific processes depend on testability. Concepts like the Big Bang and evolution cannot be tested, and therefore, are not scientific at all. Those theories are speculation and philosophy, created by scientists. Just because a scientist says something doesn't make his or her statement scientific. This would also mean that the existence of God cannot be scientifically proven. That's fine with me. Remember what I wrote about faith being an extension of reason? This is the point where faith comes in. I know it can't be proven - just as any logical scientist would know that evolution cannot be proven conclusively. But there is enough logic in it to believe that it is true. Hmm ... truth ... interesting subject. I'll have to discuss that later. I've got more on the existence of a Supreme Being, but I'll leave it at that for now. I don't want to lose the theoretical readers who really aren't actually reading this.

						   Many people seem to think better of the individual than society in general. I think they fail to see that the problem with society is that it is made up of individuals. We are all inherently flawed - this effect is magnified when individuals are examined as a group. If society is apparently more evil than good, that says a lot about the nature of an individual. Of course, there are exceptions - there are very good people, and there are very evil people. In any case, we will never achieve a perfect society until every person in the society is perfect. I don't think ANYBODY will say we are perfect now, in any sense of the word ... except perhaps 'perfectly monstrous.'

						   Doing the opposite of what I consider logical sometimes thrills me. Everybody loves a good rebellion, so why not rebel against my better judgement? After all, it wouldn't be my better judgement unless I had some kind of inferior judgement, which I must use every once in a while. It's not a big deal, in any case. But small concessions have an unfortunate habit of uniting and turning into rather big shortcomings. So perhaps I should put down my short rebellion against reason and live peacefully within myself for a time. I am, of course, rambling about my starting this "blog" scant days before I embark on a two-week mission trip to Mexico. There's really no assurance that I will continue this thing after I get back, but you never know. By the way, the 'useless trash' I referred to in the description only really includes stupid daily routines and usual occurrences. This post would be in the 'ridiculous rambling' category, and is therefore valid and does not violate my no trash policy.

						   Well, I'm kicking off my August California Tour tomorrow. First, I go to Lake Shasta with the youth group until Friday. I get back and have a couple weeks at home, then leave again on the 14th and will be gone until the 26th. That's the short version, because it's unimportant and nobody cares. It'll definitely be interesting at Shasta. I mean, the youth group is already teeming with hormones: it's only going to get worse in a bathing suit environment with basically no schedule. And you know what that means. I get to study people in interesting situations again. I will certainly have paper and pen on hand at all times. I want to work more on my short story, which is in major need of help in the dialogue area. I'll be paying close attention to the way people talk while on this trip. Because odds are nobody will ever shut up. I also have much reading to do. I haven't picked up  War and Peace  for a while, although I like it a lot. I'm simply too caught up in  1984  and  The Count of Monte Cristo . I should easily be able to finish both of them if I can catch a few moments' peace while down there. Anyway, I'll cut this short before I get any more trivial or unimportant.

						    But I'm getting tired of people claiming they're carrying the banner of my religious tradition when they're doing everything possible to undercut it. And that's what's happening in this country right now.  Amen. Makes me want to act and prove that I'm not one of those people. I can't wait to go bumhunting tomorrow. It's a game that I've been wanting to play for a while: you find a homeless person, you treat them like a person, and you take them to lunch. That's it. It's a lot better than just throwing money at them, in my opinion. You know, a lot of people throw the line around that 'you shouldn't be judging me.' And it's true. I just wonder where judging ends and criticism begins. Criticism intended to move to action is wonderful if you ask me. Even sarcasm works in that context. Even heated ranting works ... like what I often do here. Sure, it's supposed to cut you - but it's more the kind of cut that makes you realize you already had a wound there. Then it's time to get out the bandaid. I don't think I'm judging when I generalize and make statements about 'Christians today.' I'm not accusing anyone specifically, I'm painting a picture and then attacking it. And it's all designed to spur on some kind of thought or reaction in the reader - biblically then, I think I'm within my rights. Now, if I named individuals and started condemning what they do and how wrong I think they are,  then  I'd probably be judging. But then, where does rebuking come in? Damn, there's a lot to explore on this subject. I think I'll break out the Bible on this one, because I need to study this further.

						   I'm hungry right now. And that got me thinking ... People place entirely too much importance on food. I mean, we all like to eat - some say it's a natural thing to do. And it is completely necessary, don't get me wrong. But I don't think that what we eat is so very vital that we should conform our life to it.  'Is not life more important than food ...?' Let's look at this new form of gluttony. CS Lewis writes about this in  Screwtape Letters , if I'm not much mistaken. He points out that a glutton is not merely someone who eats a lot or lives in excess: if you're going to great pains and causing trouble for other people simply to get a certain type of food, you're a glutton. That means if you're on some crazy diet that only allows you to eat ______, you're a glutton. You've lost the point of eating and you've placed entirely too much importance on it. Food is meant to sustain life, not dominate it. It is for this reason that I refuse to diet ... ever. I'd rather live a 'short' life and not have to worry about what I eat than to live a long miserable one that's centered on food.  I'll eat what I have to, maybe not because I particularly enjoy it, but because I'm simply sustaining myself. This is why I am going to be eating macaroni and cheese for lunch today. I don't especially like it, but it's food. The point isn't that I like food, but that I like life.

						   Sorry, Krispin the Poet, but since you didn't use  truth in sarcasm  as your title I had to take it. I guess Ashley the Girl thought of it, but you told me about it: therefore the ripoff credit goes to both of you. Anyway, the new motto in these parts is  truth in sarcasm . I should look that up in Latin. That'd be sweet.The other motto is  being tired is fun, as long as it's not morning.  Don't worry, though. You can rest assured that this is still the outlet of my insanity. It's just not explicitly called that anymore, even though the url is the same. It can be more of an endearing nickname for this blog.

						   I really do. I didn't really care through most of last school year. Then I tried to educate myself on politics and I abrubtly started hating them. I've probably said this before, but here's the thing: I really don't think any act or legislation is really going to change things. I think that the kind of thing that will actually benefit a nation occurs in the hearts of individuals. If neighbors won't take care of each other the federal government (presented here as faceless and impersonal) isn't going to do any better. I know what you're thinking. How very hippy of me. That was for the benefit of whoever it was that was infuriated by my past use of the word 'hippy.' I'm here to offend, it's true. Anyway, John Kerry gave a speech tonight and it was televised. So I watched it. I actually turned on the TV (a rare occurrence, these days) as he began talking. Before I go any further, understand that Bush or Kerry, it makes no difference to me. I've stuck up for Bush in the past, but only because I think people attack him for a lot of things that he doesn't deserve. I also think people hate him for reasons unknown even to them, but I'll get to that later. So Kerry starts talking and I feel this dull ache in my stomach that usually foretells vomit. It wasn't so much what he was saying ... it was more that he wasn't saying anything. For the longest time, he was just talking about himself and how great and moral he is. Then he started talking about how great and moral middle class America is. And then he began ranting on how evil corporate America is. And finally, he made the inevitable leap to how evil everything is about the current administration and how great and moral his own would be. It was the typical presidential candidate speech from as far back as I can remember: "things suck now, but I can make them better." And there were actually signs that said "America can do better" as well as "help is on the way." Which brings me around to the part that really disgusted me - the crowd. I was struck with the same horror that I feel whenever I see footage of Nazi rallies. The blind and widespread fervor for ... what? Empty words? I mean come on, how much of what Kerry is promising to do can he actually pull off? Look at how vague most of his promises were. How much can any one politician do? People were chanting "Kerry, Kerry" and going into hysterics whenever he said anything that  sounded  good. Sure, it all  sounds  great - that's the story of any semi-successful politician in history.&nbsp;Grain of salt, please. There are three kinds of people when it comes to politics: there are those who don't care at all (except when they're bitching about the government), or there are those who don't really care what is possible or realistic, who allow themselves to be completely brainwashed, and who take on a fanatic zeal that idealizes everything about their chosen belief and  attacks everything else  ... or there are those who really look at what is possible or not and how much these things are actually worth. I cannot stress how vitally important skepticism is when it comes to politics. I'm going to be voting in the upcoming election. I don't think my one vote is going to make a difference, and I'm not going to be outspoken for whoever I end up voting for. I'll choose the less-unsatisfactory candidate and hope things turn out for the best. Don't be shocked by my cynicism - I told you I hate politics. I'll try to do my homework and find out who I think is full of shit and who I think might actually do what they're promising, or even if what they're promising is worth my time. But in the long run, I really don't give a shit. If I want to change things, I'm not going to sit back and vote. I'm going to go out and change them. And the cause I stand for is spiritual, not political, so to hell with politics.

						   I've been thinking about something. Teenagers have this insane tendency to repress a lot of emotions when they have a crush on somebody, and consequently they treat it like a secret. Why? It makes no sense to me. Being attracted to someone shouldn't be a secret and it's certainly nothing to be ashamed of. I mean, people get so concerned that they're going to ruin a friendship if they tell the person that they  like  them ... if that's going to cause the person to freak out and not associate with you, they're probably an asshole anyway. It's a good way to test if that friendship you're talking about is such a great thing. If it can't survive a few hormones, it wasn't so great after all, now was it? This being the case, I'm thinking about revising my new strategy toward girls. If I do develop a crush on somebody, I will tell&nbsp;her at some point: just at a wiser juncture than I have in the past. Before, the words would just kind of tumble out of me without my wanting them to. If I take better stock of the situation, I might save myself some pain. So if I don't see any hope of success, I will not spill my guts to some girl that's just going to arrange them in pagan symbols and set them on fire. Ahem ... But no, I will not hide behind some cowardly strategy. Damn, I guess I'm more dramatic than I feel tonight.

						   I suppose I'll just start writing and see where my thoughts (and fingers) lead me.  The Count of Monte Cristo  is an awesome book. It's been criticized for being very unrealistic (as in highly coincidental at times) and overly dramatic, but then again ... it's melodrama. That's the idea. Personally, I think it's a good old-fashioned story. I love every page because there's never a dull moment. It's one of those aged and enchanting books that just captures you. There's just something about it that makes it very fun to read. I had a similar experience with Bram Stoker's  Dracula , which a certain Becca the Beauty Queen has finally started reading. I swear, people should trust me when I recommend a book. They seem to think I'm joking when I talk about how good it is. Hey, now I've finally landed on a subject I can talk about for a while. People with sarcastic senses of humor get a bad rap. Just because I say things that are bitter and cynical doesn't mean that&nbsp;I  am  bitter and cynical. It just means that I find such things humorous. There's a difference. See, people always talk about how bitter and world-weary I am. I don't feel that way at all. I've been alive just under eighteen years for God's sake, I have no right to be world-weary. As for bitter: I'm certainly bitter on&nbsp;certain subjects (like my father or maybe women), but besides that what do I have to be bitter about? Nothing at all. Life is good. You hear me, ye of little faith?! I'm happy with my life so far. I just come off as negative because I'm always looking to grow and expand and learn. I think if we're not always striving to be a better person, we're not living. We're existing. Life is not meant to be static: that's why God subjected us to existing in Time. Oh by the way, Josh the Philosopher started a blog. I hope you're not offended by lambsticks.   urlLink http://lambsticks.blogspot.com/

						   That title has nothing to do with this post. At least it doesn't right now ... it might by the time I finish writing. You never know. Horse camping is a lot of fun but it leads to soreness in very unfortunate regions. I think I'm sterile now. It is very cool, however, to experience what was the major form of transportation for thousands of years. It reminds of how much things have changed in the past hundred years or so. Not when it comes to humanity itself, mind you. I don't think the nature of man is&nbsp;any different now than&nbsp;it was&nbsp;four thousand years ago. I went to a concert on Sunday night. It was the first actual concert I've ever been to and, to use common speech, it freakin rocked. Thousand Foot Krutch was the&nbsp;main event, but three other bands played: two local and one from Southern California. They were all awesome, but out of the three openers I have to say I enjoyed Dizmas the most. They were the Southern Cal band and they played Christian metal: lots of screaming and jumping around. It was a lot of fun to watch. The lead singer had dreads and screamed so frequently that his face was a violent shade of red. I thought he was going to have an aneurysm right there on the stage. Then Thousand Foot Krutch took the stage and the small crowd went nuts. I've never been that close to a moshpit before - we kind of formed the perimeter, although Nate the Kid and Darby the German jumped in a few times. It was pretty crazy for a Christian concert. On a side note, I started reading  The Count Of Monte Cristo  a few days ago. I urge you all to go read it. Right now.

						   I shall be gone for a few days. Weep, wail, and gnash your teeth. I won't be updating until Wednesday. I'm going camping with A to the J and we're going to montar los caballos. At least I think that's 'ride horses' in Spanish. It should be interesting ... I've been on a horse at one other point in my life. Anyway, AJ is going to teach me how to ride and I'm going to teach him how to throw a spear. Then we're going to combine the two and chuck spears from horseback. Damn, I wish I was born a few centuries earlier.

						   I think that everybody has a subconscious (or maybe even conscious) list in their mind of who they see as important. It's a ranking system that controls how we react to people. For example, if I asked someone to go to a movie but I wasn't high on their list, I'd be turned down. Even if a whole group of people were going. Now, if they actually liked someone else that I mentioned was going, they might go along with it. But they'd be much more likely to go if someone they were fond of asked them. It's a general rule that if a person you really like wants to spend time with you, you'll try and make it happen even if it's not all that convenient for you.&nbsp;For somebody you don't like all that much, it's the opposite: you'll find any excuse possible to get out of it. Now, when I say 'somebody you don't like' I really mean 'somebody you like, but not as much as a lot of other people.' This is all pretty obvious, but I am always amused by it. Sometimes when I'm trying to recruit people to go do something together, I know that So-and-So is going to turn me down, not because of what I'm asking but because of who I am. But I ask anyway, probably because they're higher on my list than I am on theirs. It's too bad that we as humans can't be less biased when it comes to dealing with other people. It's incredibly arrogant of us when you think about it. This is another obvious fact about human nature that I'm wasting words on anyway. Oh well. I never claimed to be revolutionary. I'm just writing about what I observe in others and myself.&nbsp;

						   So I was thinking something before going to church. I was thinking about theology and how, while it's fascinating and useful and all that, is an extremely limited venture because we can't comprehend God. We can hardly deal with the information he has explicitly told us. Anyway, I had this sudden thought about how God&nbsp;might view theology. I thought of a bunch of people (mainly nerdy men with specs) arguing about how what they believed was really the truth. They all had in their hand a little piece of a model car, and they all swore that their piece was the only one worth anything. While God is watching this, he looks over at the actual car that represents the truth: complete,&nbsp;with all the bits and pieces that the men were squabbling over. Then he looks back over at the separate parts&nbsp;held by&nbsp;the men, who are&nbsp;screaming that&nbsp;the one they have is&nbsp;the entire car. This is where God gives a shake of his head, but&nbsp;loves them for trying to understand. Is it weird that symbolism naturally yet consciously appears in my thought processes? Truth as a car? So anyway, the point is that we can all only grasp some small idea of God. The key is to recognize this fact and avoid the arrogance that would stem from claiming that I have the only piece of the model. Someday we'll see the whole car, even though, right now, we can't even begin to envision what a car would look like.

						   It's a feeling of freedom. It's a relief. Not having a crush on anybody is a very nice place to be. I have finally regained that state of mind. Celibacy is not so bad. Okay, so I'm not a monk yet. Maybe someday. Seriously though, it may not be as interesting for any readers out there, but not having anything going on romantically is bliss. Because by 'romantically' I mean the only thing I have experience with: one-sided crushes followed by a flurry of flak, no parachute, losing radio contact, deep in enemy territory with no hope of rescue ... getting shot down. I'm a teenager, though. I'm sure it will pass and my raging hormones will flare up again at some point. Like, tomorrow. And when that happens, everybody else will be excited because I'll be another pitiful kid with another hopeless crush. Don't feel guilty about it. I love to experience that from an outside perspective. Makes me feel better about life in general. But for now, I'll just enjoy the peace of mind that goes with being in control of my emotions. Under lock and key. Die, feelings.

						   Guys can relate to this. Ladies, this post doesn't really apply to you. Reading it will waste your time and make you dumber. Now that I've ensured&nbsp;all the females are reading this ... I'm a doubter. A skeptic. And sometimes I question things. Today I question the vertical placement of urinals in public restrooms. I mean, it's been a while since I've had to stand on tippee toes to do my business, but come on. I don't like to aim parallel to the ground. It ain't natural. That's right, when I urinate I want to go  with  gravity. It's just more satisfying. So why on earth are so many urinals so high up? Personally, I prefer the kind that are set right into the wall. I don't know the correct term, but you know what I'm talking about ... they run all the way down to the ground. This design eliminates most height-related problems and is a much more sensible approach to urination. Automatic flushers amaze me. We take them for granted now because we've got them all over at the high school. But how sanitary: the possibility to go  completely  hands free, for the adventurous types. Okay, maybe I should quit while I'm ahead. I don't know what possessed me to actually post this. But to cut things short, Taco Bell's urinal (singular) is just a bit too high to be comfortable.

						   I had almost forgotten how artistically intolerant some Christians are. Anything with guitars is the music of the devil. Doesn't matter if it's Christian music or not. Don't you know, if it's not on KLUV or KLOV or whatever it is, it's not Christian music? God cannot be praised with distorted guitars and any amount of bass! Neither can Christian music focus on anything other than how wonderful and holy God is. How about singing about our struggles as humans trying to be like him? What about directly and honestly addressing topics of sin through music? You know what it is: it's that mistaken modern Christian stance of isolationism. We'd rather not think about the lost or anything unpleasant about life. Forget real struggles. We'd rather pretend that everything is all right, everything is great, everything is perfect. 'God will take care of us.' And then we act surprised when people doubt God's purpose because he allowed them to suffer. Hello?! If we convince ourselves that God is going to step in and protect us from all suffering, of course we're going to be pissed when he doesn't rescue us from the normal pains of life. At times like those, we like to forget that we all have free will and that our suffering is due probably to a choice of ours, or a choice of another human. We like to forget that if God stepped in and prevented every wrong thing from happening, we'd be mindless zombies who simply exist and obey. We also arrogantly assume that any suffering we go through will not be outweighed, in the end, by good. Growth does not take place in comfort: growth is always uncomfortable. It's like working out at the gym - it really doesn't feel good when you're sore, but you know that you'll be stronger for it. We also forget that we have no idea what we have been protected from. Think of it this way: for every bad thing that happens to you, there is an infinite number of bad possibilities that  could  have happened to you. We simply&nbsp;don't know&nbsp;what we've been spared. There's a lot deeper material to discuss when it comes to suffering, but I'm feeling far too lazy to do it any justice. I think I'll leave it here for now. I hope people read this stuff and think about what they believe on the subject. These posts are worthless unless they inspire some thought in readers. Don't be so foolish as to think that I've got my crap together on these subjects.

						   Well, it's nearing two&nbsp;in the morning. This is usually when I write, for some reason. I've heard being really tired is like being stoned - I guess I just like to see what comes out of my head when I'm in a half-conscious state. I don't really have a clear purpose for this particular post. I was just feeling guilty for not posting on Wednesday, and then only posting once for Thursday. Of course, to me Thursday is today, rather than yesterday, so while to you, I'm writing this today, to me, I'm writing this yesterday ... which is really today, but is actually tomorrow ... to me, that is. This just in: I find it difficult to believe in (or at least find significance in) people speaking tongues. You know, when somebody is supposedly filled with the Holy Spirit and consequently rattles off a bunch of gibberish that nobody understands and can't learn anything from. Something tells me that if God literally spoke through someone, he would make his message clear. I think that it would be easy to fake, anyway. Same with exorcist-style demon bashing. Maybe it's terrible of me to say, but when I hear about people supposedly having these experiences, it sounds like a joke. These things sound like a hoax designed to be 'proof' of spiritual forces and demonic influences. I think a lot of times, some sickos use theatrics to try and get into a position of influence over gullible Christians. But I could be wrong. Then again, I have been to&nbsp;many church camps, retreats, and mission trips, and I've never seen a demon cast out of someone and I've never heard anyone speak in tongues. Now don't get me wrong, I believe in the existence of demons: I just think that their influences are much more subtle and unseen than is often portrayed. The Enemy thrives on deception and is therefore not going to appear as obviously evil. So vomiting all over the place and talking in strange voices, I think, is closer to lunacy than demon-possession. I think that he would greatly encourage thinking such misconceptions about him ... the more confused we are about his nature, the easier prey we are. As for the speaking in tongues: I don't buy it. Sounds like theatrics to me.

						   First off, I know: I didn't post yesterday. Terrible. Sickening. Take your pick. Krispin the Poet and I began the process of raising our brainchild today. It's a kind of splinter youth group called Finding the Plot. It's from the Newsboys song that I think is titled "Missed the Plot." The&nbsp;lines we were looking at were something like:  Are you listening? Because we're obviously not We've forgotten our first love We've missed the plot  Basically the 'plot' we're talking about here is following Christ, as opposed to just going to church or 'just believing.' We're focusing on getting focused on the things we need to be focused on. We're focused on fellowship, studying the Bible together and forming closer relationships with each other, but we're very outwardly focused as well. In addition to the Bible studies and discussions, we're planning on serving people in the community through Habitat for Humanity, volunteering at the mission, or merely helping neighbors do yardwork. Whatever needs doing, really. By the way, I don't want to give the impression that I'm anti-church. I think I came close to doing that today, as well as in a previous post. Church is a great thing and is a wonderful way to learn, grow, and serve. It's a fantastic place to form lasting friendships and is supposed to model the Kingdom of Heaven. But going to church in itself is not enough, which is where Finding the Plot comes in. We've got to reach out to people outside youth group or church, and when I say 'reach out' I don't mean coerce into believing what we do. I simply mean forming friendships and meeting needs. I jokingly refer to Finding the Plot as 'Christians for Christ.' I just think that a lot of Christians get wrapped up in everything&nbsp; except  the&nbsp;main point&nbsp;of what Jesus was trying to get us to do. They go to church, they pray, they read their Bible, but they don't associate with non-Christians. Jesus reached out to people in need, so I think I should be doing that too. Simple concept, but pretty difficult to live out.

						   It was great. The music was very good and I enjoyed it, but the crowd was so much more interesting. Imagine a small sea of hippies: bearded, tie-dyed, pierced, stoned, drunk, stinky, stoned, drunk, and ugly as sin. Now imagine these people doing Snoopy-dances song after song. When I say Snoopy-dances, I'm talking about the dancing in ... oh what's the title ...  Merry Christmas Charlie Brown ? I think that's it. Anyway, the characters do  one  dance move which is then looped for a long period of time. Did I mention that one move is absolutely ridiculous? That's what the hippies were doing. For a  long  time. It never really got old. These people were just spinning around, swinging their arms, jumping up and down, happy as could be. And drunk, in most cases. As a matter of fact, there were&nbsp;a few&nbsp;requirements for joining in: one, you had to be drunk, stoned, or mentally retarded. The place reeked of body odor and alcohol. Two, you had to be way too old to be dancing. Well, you didn't  have  to be, but it seemed to be the norm. Three, it helps if you're gay. Two very overweight lesbians were dancing in a very disturbing manner. Very lesbian. Very ugly. I shudder to think ... Ok, I call them hippies, but mainly they were just freaks. But they were having fun. And I do respect the fact that they were comfortable enough to dance like that. Whether or not they had reason to be comfortable with themselves, I won't say. But they were a happy bunch. Oh man, were they happy. I wish I could get that much enjoyment out of reggae. I like it and all, but ... I guess I'm just not a dancer. I can recognize that and refrain, while others ... never mind. I think alcohol really adds to the experience, though. And marijuana, but I didn't smell too much. Mainly it was the booze. Here's&nbsp;the halfshell in a nutshell: people you don't know and would rather not see, and&nbsp;people you do know and would rather not see. Other than the people I was with, I only saw a few people that I was happy to see. Like two. I saw a  lot  of people that I don't like, though.  I do love living in a small town. You just can't escape charming personalities. Charming, in this sense, can be interpreted in any way you please.

						   Today is the one year anniversary of my dad walking out the door and destroying my family. I remember July 20th, 2003, very vividly, and I'm very glad that it's a year later. The further I get from that date, the better things seem to get. I'm not going to write a bunch about it, by the way. No point in depressing myself or anybody else. This may sound odd, but I'm thankful that it happened. I wouldn't be who I am today if my dad hadn't left. My parents' divorce opened my eyes to a lot of things and I'm grateful for it. I don't know if I'll go so far as to say I've attained some semblance of maturity, but I'm sure that will come at some point. I really don't feel like writing about this. I've talked about this stuff so much that I don't feel the need to write about it. I've dealt with it and there's really no need to continue whining about it. Something that is never hard to keep in mind: I've had an easy life compared to most people. It sounds cliched, and maybe it is, but a lot of people have a lot shittier lives than I do.

						   I don't go nearly as much as I should. Lots of times I sleep through it just because I'm too lazy to get up. But I don't place nearly as much importance on church attendance as most Christians seem to. There seems to be a very common and very incorrect view about Christianity these days. I'm not talking about merely non-Christian perceptions of church, but of a mistaken viewpoint shared by a lot of Christians. A couple weeks ago, I was telling somebody about how I would like to go to church more, but don't feel inclined to force myself. The person I was talking to asked me something like, "Well, don't you think you should practice your religion?" If I hadn't been thinking long and hard on that subject for a few weeks, I probably would have made the same mistake as the person who asked the question. (Not to tear&nbsp;him down at all ... he simply illustrated what I already said is a very common view.) Practicing Christianity does not necessarily take place in a church. A practicing Christian is out mingling with non-Christians and extending love to them in various ways. Meeting physical needs, emotional needs, by just being there and not judging. That's what practicing Christianity is: loving and witnessing, but accepting and not condemning. And certainly not foolishly pressing people to believe what you believe. Church is training for real-world application of Christ's love. It's a place to grow in your own faith, but to focus on brothers and sisters in Christ. It's a place to practice the extension of God's love. It's a place to practice servitude. A very big part of it is learning more about God's Word.  But (and this is the major point I'm trying to get across, so it's italicized):    &nbsp;  Listening to a sermon does not mean you are practicing your Christianity. Just showing up is not good enough. Your own faith is&nbsp;just the starting line for your ministry to others. Don't be selfish with the knowledge you have. Do not, do not be content with your own salvation! Getting saved from death is not the goal of a person's life - the focus is not death, but LIFE, so live a life that strives for Christ. Spread His love and prove that you believe.  &nbsp; If you just show up at church, you're training for a game you have no intention of playing. Start playing.

						   How much crap should I put into my head? When it comes to the content of movies and books, where should I draw the line? I'm not one to walk out of a movie. I always give it a chance to justify why it was necessary to include any unpleasant stuff. Swearing, violence, nudity, drugs ... if it serves a purpose and contributes to a theme, I'll sit through it. A lot of people disagree with me on this. A lot of Christians probably think I'm going to hell for some of the movies I've watched. A lot of these same Christians tell me to read my Bible and to 'know what kind of devices the Enemy has' to pull me down into sin. Well guess what? Literature or movies that deal with the darker side of human nature are damn fine training for learning what kind of evil exists in the world. In  The Art of War  by Sun Tzu, it talks about how you will sometimes win battles if you know yourself but not your enemy. If you know both yourself and your enemy, you will always win. If I know nothing about evil, how can I overcome it? How can I see it for what it is and combat it with righteousness? If I don't know what nightmares people have to go through, if I've never been introduced to anything like their suffering, even if it's from a movie, then how can I possibly talk to them about suffering? What right do I have to talk about how Christ can fix problems when I don't even know what the problems are? I don't think naive Christians are going to do any good. Even if my knowledge about certain evil things comes from a movie, it's better than nothing. At least I've been introduced to the concept and I've had time to think about it and form opinions. Then, when I come across someone who was molested as a child, I have some inkling of how it might have messed them up. I can at least  guess  at how painful that evil must have been. Feeling discomfort while watching a movie is not a reason to walk out. It's a reason to sit it out and think about it later. Why did it make you uncomfortable? Now, put yourself in the shoes of someone who has gone through something like what you were watching. Imagine how they would feel. And then imagine how you felt too high and mighty to watch a fictional representation of their actual hell. We're all little Pharisees. We're too afraid to burst the protective Christian bubble we've wrapped around ourselves to get out there and tackle this stuff head on. We'd rather sit back and condemn the people who try to bring it to our attention. We'd rather not think about it at all. Well sometimes this stuff needs to be considered. We need to&nbsp;sift through the&nbsp; shit  that people go through so that we can be there for them. We need to understand some of this so that we can better love people. And if I write that and don't change my behavior, I'm a hypocrite. Therefore, action is called for. Action beyond my fingers hitting keys. I'll report in later. This is interesting because as I've been wrapping this up I've been hearing from Krispin the Poet about a lot of the same stuff. He and I think similarly in a lot of ways but often take slightly different perspectives on things. We've just started planning some plans. I think that, together with the people in my youth group, we need to take things into our own hands and start changing things. Once again, I'll post on some of this later.

						   Today I was intending&nbsp;to just sit around the house and write all day. I succeeded wonderfully at sitting. I did write, but not nearly as much as I wanted to. I knocked down about four pages, hopefully a couple more before I turn in. Pathetic. I hate to break this to you, but I really don't have much inspiration from today. My story was a vortex that consumed what little inspiration I could gather. Well, I guess inactivity really is when inspiration takes place. When something is happening you don't think of how inspiring it is. You decide that later on, looking back. So I really don't have an excuse not to write anything here. I'll try and think of something. Hmm ... nothing new on the romantic front. Shoot, I discuss that stuff with so many different people I forget what I've said to whom and when I said it. Consequently, I don't know if I've posted anything about my recent shift in strategy? In a nutshell: I'm giving up. Not just on Greeneyes - I gave up on her the second time she rejected me. Well, probably before that, but I'll keep that private. Which is why I just wrote that. Anyway, I'm giving up on trying. In other words, I'm going back to my first strategy, which served me well for many years. Basically it's the kind of strategy that will prevent me from ever having to mess with romance as long as I stick to it. It goes something like this: whatever stupid crush I develop on some stupid girl, I just keep it to myself. I don't do what I've been doing for&nbsp;the past&nbsp;year and tell her that I'm attracted to her. That's right, I'll never have a relationship unless some poor girl pursues  me . The word  never  just jumped out at me.&nbsp;But I'll save myself from a lot of unnecessary pain. I better comb through my past posts and make sure that I haven't already written something exactly like this. If so, this may or may not disappear from the record. But you never know ... it might amuse me to have two very similar posts.&nbsp;So I'll probably leave it anyway. While I'm trying to fatten this post, I might as well throw in another excerpt from today's labors: &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Anyway, after I had taken in my first view of the city, I began making my way down the hill toward the outskirts. The buildings out here were mainly houses, most with light streaming from the cracks of doors and windows, all locked up and hiding from the world. Other than the crunch of my footsteps on the dirt path, the only sounds I heard were the muffled protests of children who were fighting to stay out of bed, matched only by their parents, who fought back just as vehemently.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One house was different, I remember. Light fell across the road in front of my feet, causing me to look up at the source. It was just a few candles shining through an open window, but compared to the darkness outside the glow was brilliant. I was struck by the open window: it had to be the only open one I had seen yet. Unable to resist, I glanced inside -&nbsp;I caught a momentary glimpse of a man sitting beside a bed. Tucked beneath the covers was a small boy, obviously the man’s son. Just as I turned back to the dark road before me, I became aware of a soft voice singing. The father was singing over his sleeping son. I was suddenly aware of a stirring deep within me, a yearning for something I had thought I could never have again. I became tired, so weary that I felt like sitting down then and there. Better yet, I felt like going up to that open window and asking the man to open the door and let me in.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I kept walking.    &nbsp; By the way, the setting is basically a fictional version of 18th century Britain. Just thought you'd like to know. And I don't know how much of this story I should post on here. I mean, it's not like it's going to get published or anything, but there's always the chance that&nbsp;I could get ripped off. Tell you what, if you're interested in reading this when it's done, send me an email. &nbsp;  urlLink freakish_midget@hotmail.com

						   So here are&nbsp;the first two paragraphs, for any interested parties: &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The ruin of a once-great man is a terrible thing to behold. Of all the things I have seen during my wanderings, the shell of a proud man is by far the worst. The closest thing I can compare it to would be a lion with a shaved head. One knows the mane was once there, and was beautiful, but that’s where the beauty ends: a memory.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There comes a time in a man’s life when he runs out of battles to fight. When that time approaches he will do one of two things: he will lay down his arms, or he will fight battles that are not his.  &nbsp; I'm just beginning to realize how much my writing style was affected by  Catcher in the Rye . Not quite so much in that excerpt, but in other areas. Like this paragraph, later on: &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Anyway, I was in my typical state: dirty, tired, and hungry. My appearance must have been greasy and borderline intimidating. I wouldn’t know for sure … I try to avoid seeing my reflection if I know I don’t look good. Some people have a dread fascination with bad reflections, but I’ve never liked those kinds of people. They tend to be both depressed and depressing.  &nbsp; Definite J.D. Salinger influence, I think. I enjoy writing in first person - it's so much more interesting to read than third. It gives me a chance to write with some tone, rather than a detached, apathetic kind of narration. By the way, this stuff is rough draft material and is therefore likely to change. Anyway, that's a sample of my crap. I don't know how interesting it is, but oh well. I'm not forcing you to read.

						   I disgust myself in a lot of ways. When I say this I don't mean it in an unhealthy, self-loathing way: I'm using it to express&nbsp;the fact that&nbsp;I do indeed have faults. But anyway, I can't stand how selfish I am with myself. Now, I know this is typical human behavior but I don't think that excuses me or anyone else. Why is it that we expend love and affection on people that we already know and care about, rather than people who we don't know and/or don't like? It's egotistical. We're usually friends with people who share a lot of our own qualities or interests, right? In a lot of ways it's an extension of&nbsp;my love for myself.&nbsp;I think&nbsp;my friends are&nbsp;more worthy of my affection because they're  better  than people&nbsp;I don't like ... because they're more like  me .&nbsp; Why should I treat my friends differently than I would treat a complete stranger or an outright enemy? I know it's normal to do this, but it just doesn' t make sense. I hate being bound to my humanity. It's one thing to spot the things that are wrong with human nature, but they're impossible to fix. They're too deeply rooted. They're too big for me and it's a humble reminder that I'm not God, which is probably why it's important to recognize those faults. I just thought of another egotistical human tendency that is pretty unrelated to what I was just writing about. (Aside from the 'egotistical' connection, that is.) Whenever I'm not good at something, I'll excuse it with a statement like, "Well, it's just not my gift." But if I'm really good at something, I'll either praise myself&nbsp;or downplay it so that people will praise me more. "No, I'm not that great at _____." Notice the use of the term 'gift.' My talents are no great accomplishment of mine. I was simply born with a tendency toward certain things. God gave me certain talents along with the knowledge that I&nbsp;damn well better&nbsp;put them to use for him. So to downplay my talents is to belittle God's gift to me, but to praise myself is giving myself undue credit. I can no more take credit for my talents than for the color of my hair. What's more, I envy other people's gifts. Being human is an absolute nuisance. I wish I could get a move on and become perfect. You know, I just looked over what I wrote and realized that none of this should really be a revelation to anyone. But that's the problem with our American way of thinking: if it's not new material, it's probably outdated and untrue. Well, while this may not be revolutionary or spectacular, it is what it is.

						   As much as I enjoy this kind of senseless journaling, I feel that it has been taking away from my other literary pursuits. My passion is writing fiction and I feel like I should be doing more of it. This being the case, I'm going to pick up some of my other projects at this point in time. I will not abandon this blog by any means: as a matter of fact, I might post pieces from my other projects on here. Up until a few months ago, I never really wrote every day. If I didn't absolutely feel like writing then I didn't. This is not a good system for writing fiction. Luckily I've gotten a lot better about scribbling things daily, so I think I've matured enough as a writer to tackle fiction again. Other than some plans for a novel that have been stagnant for nearly a year now (which I will revive at some point), I've just started a short story. On the surface, it's a story about arrogance, self-righteousness, and honor. Anyway, I think this might work out for the best. If I don't mention anything about what I'm working on, post a comment and see if I'm still keeping at it. If I'm not, call me lazy and worthless. Sometimes I need a little accountability to keep me on track.

						   Maybe I'm an idiot, but I found out today that C.S. Lewis was born in Belfast, Ireland. You know what that means, of course: he was an Irishman. Do you know what else that means? He's one of two intellectual Irishmen ever to exist! (Oscar Wilde being the other, of course.) And if you're really on a roll, you know that they both spent most of their lives in England, anyway. So they hardly count as Irishmen. But it's a close enough call that I'm amazed by it. C.S. Lewis is an incredible thinker. I've just started reading  Chronicles of Narnia  for the first time since about first grade. I've read  Mere Christianity  and  Screwtape Letters  and would highly recommend them both. The man's work is deep no matter what he's writing about. Even  Narnia  is deep, which I'm coming to realize. I was far too young to appreciate it in first grade. I don't really know where I'm going with this. I'm still in shock that he was Irish. Irish ... how could it be? I heard a great and very random statement by one of the kids at that junior high camp. It was completely out of the blue at the time: 'I'm Irish. I mean, I like drawing leprechauns and when I find a four-leaf clover, I eat it.' Oh that is classic.

						   Good golly I'm glad I'm not in junior high anymore. After spending a few days with&nbsp;a rowdy pack of middle school savages, I feel mature. I'm sure it'll wear off soon and the truth will replace the fantasy, but for a while I felt like an adult. Where to start? One thing that I really enjoyed was the bathrooms on the campsite. Hear me out. You could hear everything being said in the adjoining rooms in that little building. That wasn't the fun part. The fun part was trying to tell if the voices were coming from the boys' or the girls' bathrooms. The voices were the same high pitch; indistinguishable from one another until you heard one crack. The guys on the older end of the junior high spectrum were fascinating. They were all at that stage where they can be squirrely at times, so that they enjoy running around and getting sweaty and dirty ... and smelly. Most of them were not quite used to this stage of development and as a result I saw no deodorant being used. Showers were neglected as well. Needless to say, our very cramped tent had a very disagreeable odor. Luckily I have the use of only one nostril. So I didn't mind that much ... I just thought it was interesting to note. Despite the amusing aspects, and aside from the very annoying ones, junior highers aren't such a bad crowd. In some ways, they're not yet being corrupted by the nasty things about our culture. In other ways, they're just beginning to be corrupted and are still at a stage where they can avoid certain things more easily than they could down the road. Only the adventurous (and early blooming) ones really interacted with the opposite sex. And when I say 'interact' I mean a kind of flirting that lacks any semblance of confidence. But that belongs to the 'amusing' category, not the redeeming one. The thing I liked most about them was that they have a very refreshing faith. They ask questions about God that I sometimes take for granted, or once wondered about but haven't reflected on for a long time. Like, "What happens to people who die without ever hearing about Jesus?" I realized that it's one of those things that I need to look into because I don't quite know where I stand. Sometimes I love being asked a question that makes me realize that I do not, in fact, know the answer. In simpler ways, annoying middle schoolers are philosophers. I don't even know how many times I was asked, 'Why?' One kid walked into the bathroom while I was taking a piss. I'm standing in front of the urinal and he asks me, 'Jacob, what are you doing?' I was too shocked to respond, 'What the hell does it  look  like I'm doing?' That's completely unrelated to what I was going to begin writing about, but I thought it was a worth mentioning. Anyway, they're all philosophers. Freakin little versions of Socrates. I was asked 'Why?' so many times that I ceased to know 'why.' This kid had me stumped as to why I was going to take a shower. &nbsp; Kid: What are you doing? Me: I'm going to go take a shower. Kid: Why? Me: Because I feel unclean. Kid: Why? Me: Because I  am  unclean. Kid: Why? Me: Because I'm dirty. Kid: Why? Me: Because I need a shower. Kid: Why? Me: Because that's what people do when they're dirty, except for little snot-nosed punks like you. Kid: Why? Me: Why do people shower or why are you a little punk?  Kid shrugs and runs off.  &nbsp; Note to self: the only way to get somebody to stop asking you questions is to question them. But on another note, I've sworn off showers until I've convinced myself (or been convinced) that it's not a waste of my time.

						   I have been unexpectedly called away to duty for the week. That's right, I get to be a small part of Boot Camp 2004. It's basically a camp for my church's junior high youth group. It's sure to be interesting ... I haven't been around junior highers since I was in junior high. So what I'm getting at is that I won't be updating this until Friday. Yeah, boohoo, I'm sure all you ficticious readers are very put out. Signing out ...

						   Some of you may have noticed how I refer to people in my writing: I don't just supply a name, I give the person a title. This may seem a little odd. Well first of all, I stole the idea from an incredible book called, "Blue Like Jazz." I don't remember the author's name, but I highly recommend reading it. But back to the tagging system. That's really how the mind works isn't it? You connect the person with a concept even if they're really not connected with it. Like how I refer to Scott as Old Man Scott. He's really not an old man. I just think of him that way. I don't know why. But I do. I think it makes writing about people more fun. It gives the reader a better impression of them. I mean, if I didn't give someone a title, you'd be left with your preconceived notions about people with that name based on experiences you've had with them. Anyway, I thought I'd just explain the ideas behind my weird titles in hopes that the system will spread. It'd be interesting to see how many different titles could be attributed to the same person. Like if I told a bunch of people to think of a title for a specific person, and they all came up with different ones. That'd be great. I wonder what title people would give me ... nothing flattering, I expect.

						   There's this terrible malady that afflicts some teenagers: it's an incredible urge to be perceived as artistic without actually practicing any art. I know a lot of kids who call themselves poets and they never write a line of poetry. I also know a lot of 'writers' who never write a word unless they're forced to in school. It's all about the image of being  artistic , because chicks dig artists. I used to be somewhat guilty of this. I allowed people to call me a writer when I really wasn't writing anything. Now, other than the fact that I actually do write, I often try to clarify the meaning behind the term 'writer.' Here's the deal ladies: if a guy tells you he's a writer, he's coming on to you. (Especially for the older crowd - college-aged and such.) He's obviously just trying to impress you. If he was honest, he would tell the truth. Here's a bit of dialogue to illustrate this:  Girl: "So, what do you do for a living?" Guy: "Um, I'm a writer." Girl: "Oh how  interesting ! What do you write?"  Here I'll save the guy from answering and supply a translation:  Girl: "So, how much money do you make?" Guy: "Um, I'm unemployed." Girl: "I don't quite know what to say. But I might sleep with you, anyway."  When somebody asks me, I tell them that I don't have a job, but that I write stuff. They ask what, and I say something like, "I write crap." I'd rather they have low expectations before reading my stuff, anyway. Of course, this all applies with music, fine arts ... basically anything that can be passed off as artistic. The worst offenders are 'writers,' with 'poets' coming in at a close second. Some kids call themselves poets in the sense that they've written a poem before. Others use the title because they actually  do  write poetry ... it's just really  crappy  poetry. But there are a select few who have the right to call themselves poets. Actually, I only know of one, and that would be Krispin the Poet. He denies being a poet, which is exactly why he is one. Very good with metaphors, that one. And satire. Like our co-writing of the poem, "Green," or whatever we ended up calling it. It's all in the delivery, by the way: you have to read poetry in a dramatic, mystical voice, with candles lit, someone banging on a drum, maybe throw in a bass, and you have to wear a hood. Or eyeliner, in Krispin's case. Emo kid. But I digress. Actually I don't, because that's all I've got. I just wanted to use the word 'digress.' So I did.

						   I mean, there's so much rubbish to amuse me in this dirty place! There are some truly brilliant people out there. Some websites just blow my mind. Like  urlLink this  one. Pure genius, no? I can see somebody sitting around thinking about how it might be kind of funny to do something like that. But to actually spend the time to do it? What kind of maniac spends time making a cartoon like that, and then pays money for the domain? The truly funny thing to me is this: that's all there is to the site. What you see is what you get, aside from some links to the creator's real website. I haven't checked it out yet ... maybe I should give it a shot. Anyway, I just thought that was amusing and exquisitely random. Credit goes out to Michael the Crazy Asian for discovering it.

						   So a few days ago, my car went on strike. It's prone to these stubborn streaks as it's not quite twice as old as me. I love it dearly, though; my little 1970 Volkswagen Bug. But it does annoy me when it decides it no longer needs a clutch cable, and therefore snaps it. And poof! I'm without a car for a few days. Without transportation of my own, without the ability to go anywhere whenever, without, in a word, freedom. Now, when I use the word 'freedom' in this context, I am talking about the lesser sort of freedom that only involves choice, and not truth. It's not vital to my free will, but I like it anyway. My current situation reminds me of that terrible age of 15, when you're oh so close to being able to taste the freedom of driving. Now, when I was fifteen I was in my recluse stage. I call it my isolationist period, like the US before the Great War. I just didn't like people: I preferred to be by myself and slip deeper into some ridiculous depression. I think back to that time period because my situation now is very similar, but very different in a very important sense. Back then, my inability to drive was an excuse to stay at home and avoid people. These past few days, on the other hand, I have been bumming rides every day so that I can do things and be with people. Rather than spend the whole day at home, I spend the whole day with whoever is kind enough to let me ride in their car. Yesterday, it was A to the J. Today, who knows? Anyway, not having the ability to leave home on my own accord makes it that much more difficult to stay here. It would be fine if my car was waiting in the driveway, because then I would have comfort in the knowledge that I was here on my own free will, not because I couldn't leave. It's strange how inherently rebellious we humans are. We can't stand feeling like we're not choosing our own paths. If we're denied something, we try and attain it ... simply because we hate being denied. It's like the basic flaw with legalism. The human mind can't process negatives. If I tell you, "Don't think about a zebra," what do you automatically think of? The part that matters to your brain is "think about a zebra." So if you tell somebody not to slam the door, you're just making them think about slamming it. They probably wouldn't have given it a second thought if you hadn't told them not to. It's like those booklets they always hand out during the first few weeks of school - something about Standards for Discipline, or some such nonsense. In that little booklet are hundreds of things students are not allowed to do. I would never have thought of most of those things if they weren't specifically listed in there. Those problems are the reasons why I think so many Christians have the wrong focus. We get so caught up in  not sinning  that all we think about is  sinning . It's important not to try to process negatives, but to think about what we  should  be doing.

						   I know the whole event is about old cars and generally being old. But it gets really old. I mean, how long does it take to verify that yes, all these cars are old and expensively restored? About thirty seconds. And then it gets boring. The worst part is that the whole town turns out for the endless cruise, the never-ending procession of brightly colored vintage cars. The crowd is usually more colorful than the cars, however: all sorts of people show up for the festivities. That's really the only interesting part, but even mullet-spotting loses its luster after a while. Along the course of things, I find wild thoughts flitting through my mind. Crazy impulses, mainly directed at spicing things up a bit. Like when I see a black, very mobster car, I think of how  cool  it would be to have guys with tommy guns hanging out the windows. And then I think of how  sweet  it would be to have them turn those guns on the crowd and fire blanks. And then I think of how  awesome  it would be to have people strategically placed on the sidewalk ... people with fake blood packets and white t-shirts on. People who would trigger small blood explosions, grab themselves and scream in apparent agony. Now  that  would be exciting! Shoot, they should let me plan some of this stuff. I'd get the thing national recognition. Those are honestly the kinds of crazy daydreams I have. I even smile to myself while I'm thinking them. So if you ever see me grinning to myself, don't ask. The other thing about Graffiti Night is that every teenage girl in the area shows up wearing the sluttiest apparel they own. Well, I don't literally mean  every  girl, because the girls I was with don't do stupid things like that. (Which is something that I really respect about them.) But anyway, I can't stand seeing what has to be a 13-year-old girl walking around in what I guess is supposed to be a skirt and wearing what I take to be a shirt that would look more at home on a toddler. I saw some females there that I knew but could hardly recognize through all the makeup and desperately artificial 'beauty' that some call cosmetics.  I love seeing girls who don't wear makeup. They look so much more beautiful when they're themselves, not trying to conform to some ridiculous standard or to fool anybody. It shows that they're comfortable with themselves and have more important things to do than worry about how people will perceive them. That, or they just didn't have time that morning to apply the crap. Makeup seriously freaks me out. It's disgusting: all greasy or powdery, disgustingly colorful, and nasty smelling. I'm glad I only wear it for really important events. But back to Graffiti Night: the guys are just as bad. Guys, eyes combing the crowd for girls to look at. Guys, dressed in their Abercrombie best. I noticed a very amusing phenomenon that occurs when a guy is walking around with his shirt off. He always has this look on his face that says very clearly what he's wondering: "Do I look hot?" I can't really explain the look, except that it also seems defiant: "Yeah, I'm not wearing a shirt. So what?" I actually saw a no-shirt man walk almost a block while caressing his chest. You can't blame me for watching. I thought, no way is that guy going to continue walking like that. So I kept watching. But this guy was all over himself; he even looked down at it sometimes. He was completely turned on by his own nipple. I think it goes to show: the only thing a man loves more than women is himself.

						   Josh the Philosopher told me he checked this site today. He said he was very disappointed to see that it was not updated. Ha. I have a fan. No but seriously, I'm shocked that people read this stuff. I don't know how much I really enrich people's lives with what I write here, but it's nice to have someone read it. Even if just a handful of people do, that makes this site more useful than a mere private journal. Honestly, what's the point of writing what will never be read? Writing isn't writing because it's written ... it's writing because it is read. Anyway, I'm looking into the rules and formats of writing a screenplay. I figure I should do my homework for the sake of Josh the Philosopher, who wants to co-write a screenplay. It's a whole different ball game from the stuff I write here, so I'm excited to broaden my horizons. Maybe once we start we'll post some of it here. While I'm on the subject of writing, I thought something today. I'm not really sure what to think of this thought, as I haven't quite had time to examine it and the validity of its claim. I was getting really annoyed at our two dogs: an old chocolate lab and a young dachsund. They were barking continuously at the dog next door, who barked back just as constantly.  Annoying as hell . I kept thinking, "what good do they think it'll do? Barking isn't going to accomplish anything." And then I compared literature to a dog's futile barking. What good does it do, beating the air and screaming our pain to the night? Will it make a difference or make things better? Will it fix the problems it's addressing? No, it will not ... ... in and of itself. But then I started thinking, what if somebody heard the noise and went to go check things out? And what if they slapped the bitches around a bit and solved the problem? (Sorry, I couldn't help myself. It was there and I had to take it.) My point is, barking doesn't do any good at all unless it motivates someone to go and figure out what's wrong. And that's what literature does. That's what makes a book great: it changes the way people think about things. If it doesn't motivate someone to change things, then it's just useless bitching. (Once again, I could not resist.) So if I ever write a book, I'm going to make absolutely sure that it says something worth saying. If I fail to change the reader in some way, then I'm a failure as a writer.

						   I had a minor revelation today. I was in a car with Josh the Philosopher and Krispin the Poet for a few hours, and we were swapping stories about some of our past experiences ... most of them (mis)adventures in romance. We were laughing at each other and having a good time, when I started to realize how necessary it is to laugh at your stupid mistakes in the past. If you really learned something from that stupid thing you did, it should become funny to you. Your past self should seem foolish to you because you're smarter now. You can  see  how dim you were because you learned from it. It's like seeing an old picture of yourself. You laugh because you're thinking, "Why the  hell  did I cut my hair like that?" And it's a good sign if other people laugh at your past self, as well. It shows that they think you're smarter now and that they wouldn't expect you to do something so ridiculous. If you can't laugh at your mistakes, it shows that you're still a bit too stupid to see how stupid you are. It shows that you haven't quite developed beyond that experience, so you can't see the humor in how stupid you were. It's not funny to you: because you're still stupid. I wouldn't be laughing, either. But I'm sure I will later, when I someday read this and think of how much of an idiot I was when I wrote this. Hindsight is arrogant, that way. Of course, if I run around laughing at my past self, I'll probably trip up when I reach the future. It's like walking backward through life. You're inevitably moving in the right direction, but you're looking the wrong way. I'm not one to waste time thinking about the future, but it's always a good idea to glance that way every once in a while. Most of the time, though, I think it wise to either be looking straight down at your feet and focus on the present, or to check the past to make sure you're not repeating some moronic error. The thing about the future is that it's completely undefined and up for grabs. The past has a value that can be determined upon reflection, and the present is when we actually live and make choices. But the future? What does it really have to offer? Uncertainty. Nobody knows, until it becomes the present, at which point it should become our focus. It's like when people talk about the way they might die. Somebody once told me they would never commit suicide because they wouldn't want to 'die like a coward.' I replied, 'I'd be more afraid of living like one.' I think we all die the way we live. If we live fearing death, then we'll die afraid. That's why I think the present should really be our chief concern. TODAY, I am alive. 'What am I going to do with my life?' should be a question about today, not tomorrow. That's why I hate it when people ask me about college and a future career. I'd like to say, 'I don't know ... I'm just trying to decide what to eat for lunch.'

						   I was asked this question about my Christian beliefs, earlier today. My mother was the one who asked, so it was more of a question to get me thinking than to show her disagreement. What if I am? Well then, I guess I'm too stupid to realize it. It's not like I don't question what I believe every day. Honestly looking at your faith is a daily process. Faith is not something that you just  feel , it's something that you think about, question, and maintain every single day. And if I've come to the wrong conclusions every single day, then I'm just a fool. People seem to think that the day I became a Christian marked the day that I closed my mind to any other possibility. I haven't closed my mind at all: I examine every possible explanation that I come across in relation to the nature of the universe, philosophical issues, etc. They just don't add up like Christ does. I look at everything skeptically, and so far, Christianity is the only thing that has withstood that scrutiny. I think people are fools if they don't doubt their faith at times. You should always ask the tough questions. Of course, if you don't look for answers, you're not doing yourself any good. But I believe that sometimes the best way to grow in your faith is to doubt it. Every time I've doubted something about Christ, I've looked into it and realized that I doubted out of ignorance, not knowledge. I doubted because I didn't understand something as completely as I should have, not because it didn't make sense. I just couldn't make sense of it because I'm an idiot. Which brings up another point: it doesn't matter what I believe. What matters is the truth. This is why it is so incredibly important to constantly question why you believe what you do ... you need to strive to find what the truth is, and find out if your beliefs match it. Of course, we're tiny human minds. The truth is a concept that we can never be completely sure of. But I think that the more you look for it, the more you'll learn about it. We can never fully comprehend God, but we can do our utmost to try. So if I'm wrong, then I'm a fool. If I'm right, then I'm still a fool ... but I'm a fool who realized the only thing worth realizing. Have I come to the wrong conclusion every single day? It's possible... But I doubt it.

						   I'm just wondering if I can seriously harm my bladder by urinating every five minutes or so. I'm not talking just a trickle, either. There's some serious fluids moving through me. I drink way too many carbonated beverages. Somebody research this and post a comment. I want to know if I can permanently damage my bladder through overuse. This is audience participation. Actually, this is me testing to see if the audience actually exists.

						   I want to conduct a study. The topic is simple: "what percentage of a person's jokes come from movies?" There are several difficult aspects to this, however. For example, what constitutes a joke? Do people have to laugh? What if it's a bad joke and nobody laughs? I guess, then, that I could figure it to be an attempted joke by the sheepish expression on the speaker's face. I get sick of listening to the same movie moments repeated over and over. Yeah, the gasoline fight in Zoolander was great. Don't ruin it for me. Sure, Johnny Depp is a genius, but the 'human hair from my back' line from Pirates of the Caribbean can only do so much for me. Don't make me hate it. I'm guilty of this, sometimes, but I try very hard to avoid movie humor. I mean, sometimes it really can be funny. If the situation is right. Rarely. But sometimes. The bottom line is that people are simply uncreative when it comes to humor. When somebody says that someone has "a great sense of humor," they usually mean, "they've seen a lot of the same movies as me." And if you haven't seen that movie, or you thought it was stupid, you're a killjoy or an asshole. You don't have a sense of humor. You're too serious. Lighten up. Go watch a movie.

						   Oh, it was so much more than I bargained for. Cars, weirdos, people with microphones ... and belly dancers. Yeah that's right. Belly dancers. It was the most disturbing collection of freaks I've seen in a while. Naturally, I'm extremely glad that I went. I can handle the Graffiti Weekend crowd: old people, old cars, same old, same old. But old belly dancers? Oh God, the images in my mind... I might be fine with the whole belly dancing concept if the dancers were at least  somewhat  attractive. I still wouldn't see the relevance to vintage cars, but hey. I think my favorite part was the ancient, scantily-clad woman balancing a sword on her head and prancing around with her arms raised. She looks around in challenge and the crowd applauses appeasingly. It was classic. People in Roseburg are desperate to prove how "cultured" they are, of course, so this crowd that's gathered around is acting so damn  interested ; all in an attempt to impress their neighbors with how impressed they are. And then there was the stuff leading directly into the look-alike contest. A local radio personality enjoying the power of holding a microphone, because then everybody has to listen to him. Unfortunately, and he's probably on the radio to avoid this, everybody is also  looking  at him. Anyway, he's giddy with his power and everything's fine: he's droning on, and I'm still too busy looking at him to listen to what he's saying. But then he has to let somebody else talk. This guy is completely unwilling to relinquish the microphone. I was reminded of Hillary Clinton finally having to leave the White House. He tries to hold the mic for this lady, but she snatches it away. His face contorts in suppressed rage, then his hand reaches out and grabs it back, he adds some superfluous comment that was supposed to be funny, and then the lady grabs it again. At one point, they were both clinging to the thing, like they were seriously fighting over it. I don't know why, but it was hilarious to me. As for the contest itself, there was one contestant. I was impressed, though: he did look like Rupert. I don't know what else he has going for him, but he definitely looks like Rupert. A shnark too thin, but oh well.

						   If I could learn to play any musical instrument, it would probably be the violin. Not only does it have a beautiful sound, the way it looks is ... enchanting. But then I think about how long it would take to learn to play a violin well. Just think of how absolutely TERRIBLE new violin players sound! The thing about violins is that they make the most awful noises if you don't know what you're doing. That's really the reason why I don't try to learn. I'm not afraid of the work it would take to get to a high level. It's the fact that I would sound terrible that prevents me from really trying. The reason why I don't want to play is that I think it would depress me, trying to learn. But the reason why I want to play is that I think it would make me happy, being able to play well. If you didn't already guess from the title, that was me screwing around with some symbolism. I don't really know why; I just felt like doing it. And no, I still haven't gotten that phone call. This is me wasting time. This is me ceasing to waste time.

						   ... and WHACK, your head's gone. I'm just preparing myself for the rejection I am sure to experience tonight. Remember Greeneyes, that girl I talked about in an earlier post? I'm awaiting my second rejection at her hands. You know, that's really my problem when it comes to wooing. I have absolutely no confidence in my chances of success. Whenever I've decided to try and start a romantic relationship, I've honestly never believed it would happen. I have self-esteem issues in this area. I think that maybe if I believed I'm good enough, she would believe that, too. But somehow, I can never think positively about these things. Whether or not I should think this, I don't think it will happen. There's just something about me that makes it impossible for girls to see me in THAT way. I always end up in the friend role, and then eventually I'm shafted altogether. But you know what, I'm probably a stronger person for it. At least I do stick my neck out. At least I care enough to risk getting my heart torn out. At least I have the strength to make myself vulnerable in the future, knowing full well the kind of pain I'm likely to experience. I think I'd rather experience the turmoil of rejection than the uncertainty and regret of never having tried. And besides, there are a LOT more painful things than teenage romance, or a lack thereof. I have such an easy life it makes me sick. I'm very thankful that this is the worst pain I'll be experiencing at this point in time. Because it's not that bad. I'm still awaiting a phone call that isn't likely to come tonight. I'll know whenever that accursed cell phone rings. The news isn't likely to be good. Bring it on.

						   They're everywhere out here. It's creeping me out. Every five minutes a FLOCK of pigeons wings by my window. And then they try to intimidate me by aiming straight for my window, then veering off onto the roof. It's my house, dammit! I'm not leaving and I have a twenty-two! See, now it's dark so the alternate species moves in as reinforcements. Flies are covering my window. They want me to panic and run outside so the pigeons can frickin gouge out my eyes! I really need to urinate. Mountain Dew wreaks havoc on your system. If carbonated beverages were liquor, I'd have liver disease. Is it bad if I just saw some pink sandals of my little sister's and was tempted to put them on? Is it worse to feel temptations like those in the first place, or to deny them? It doesn't really matter ... they wouldn't fit, anyway. Crazy image for you: a guitar without strings. Trippy. It's like some kind of sick symbolism, but I can't really figure out what it means. I'm not really that tired, this is just the terrible truth of my thought processes. I'm going to let it flow for a while longer. Nope, it stopped. Because now I'm actually communicating with other humans. Oh well, it was fun and disturbing while it lasted.

						   Lots of times I lapse into this strange manner of thinking. I begin to think that this town gets kind of a bad rap when it comes to being a 'hick town.' I almost start thinking that it's not so pathetic, after all. And then I see stuff like this. The News-Review publishes The Currents once a week, which it describes as "The News-Review's guide to arts, entertainment, and television." I checked some movie times and then flicked over to the weekly calendar. Oh boy. Let's see, how many times is karaoke listed as an event on these two pages? Let me count ... 14 different karaokes going on this week alone. But it gets better. There's all kinds of weird stuff happening. Like the "SOLID GOLD DOO-WOP." I have no idea what that is, except that it's happening a couple times at Seven Feathers. Oh here we go: "THE ART OF TIE-DYING" was at Mystic Earth on Friday. Shoot, I missed it. How about "BELLY DANCING" at Alexander's Greek Cuisine? Bring the wife and kids! "SUMMER TROLLEY THROUGH WINE COUNTRY." All-day tour of local vineyards. Also known as "OLD PEOPLE DRINKING FAR TOO MUCH WINE AND GETTING SO CRAZY DRUNK THAT WE DRIVE THEM AROUND ... UNTIL THE RIDE'S OVER AND THEY ALL DRIVE HOME." Shoot, missed that one too. I think this one is my favorite, though: "RUPERT LOOK-ALIKE CONTEST." (You know, the fat pirate guy from Survivor.) There's no need to make fun of this, I'll just type out what it says here: "RUPERT LOOK-ALIKE CONTEST" - 7:30 p.m., Sherm's Thunderbird Market on Stewart Parkway, Roseburg. Local politicians and business leaders will determine who most looks like Rupert on the television show, "Survivor." The winner and a guest will earn a seat at a tribal table for a Winston fund-raising event Nov. 13, which will feature a seafood dinner and visits by "Survivor" celebrities. The look-alike contest is being sponsored by KRNR. 673-5553." That's Wednesday, July 7th. Mark your calendars. I know I'm going.

						   I hate politics. It's a game without rules, where the general consensus is there is no right or wrong. It's anathema to everything I believe. I really don't think any act or legislation is going to do much to improve the human condition. The only changes that will make a difference occur within the individual. If we weren't so concerned with AIDs in Africa, we might realize that our nextdoor neighbor has a drug problem, is considering suicide, and doesn't know Christ. If we weren't so troubled about oppressed Iraqis, or whether or not our nation should be helping them, we might realize that just spending time with someone at home can make a difference. Worrying about people across the world isn't noble: it's an excuse to get you out of doing something of worth for someone you DO know. And despite what the theories of democracy would have you believe, your one vote only really counts in the sense that you're making yourself feel involved. The only people that can convince large numbers of people to vote a certain way are the politicians themselves. They have financial backing. You don't. You're just part of the mob. I'm not against voting or caring about political issues. I just don't think it's as important as people seem to think. If we started caring about things that we can fix, we'd make more of a difference than voting a certain way ever could. Christians who become highly passionate about politics need to realize one thing: Jesus wasn't a politician. He never preached about the political situation in Rome or the civil war in China. What He did was meet the needs of those around Him. Maybe if we sincerely tried to follow Christ's example we wouldn't be such useless windbags.

						   There's an ad at the top of this page that says something about taking a quiz about how well you know God. What kind of moron makes a quiz like that?! I really enjoy apologetics (basically looking at Christianity in a philosophical and logical light), but God is not something we're supposed to understand. In reality, the human mind can barely wrap itself around the idea that such a being exists. I'm not talking about theorizing and reasoning about God, I'm talking about actually understanding him. We can't. We have these irritatingly little minds. I just don't appreciate it when people sell a belief system. I mean, an advertisement for how well you know God? Come on: how very televangelist. Some people don't realize that when you sell your beliefs like that, you just come off as false and you destroy your chance to make someone understand what you're really trying to say. Forget talking about it, live it. That's how you advertise what you believe: by what you do, not by the bullshit you throw out in fancy religious talk. I don't know how many people read this stuff, but it's probably not very many. I couldn't care less. I write this crap for myself - I'm not trying to prove anything to anybody. So when I talk about my religion on here, you can bet that I'm being genuine. I've already admitted that I don't live out my beliefs enough. I'm disgusted with myself in that respect. At least I'm honest about it. I can't stand greasy-haired televangelists who make profits off Christ. They also give Christianity a bad name. But then again, so do Christians. My God, forgive our failures! We are such bad representation!

						   High schoolers look at college kids like slaves look at free men. It's a kind of awe mixed with fear, worship mixed with envy. This phenomenon is most easily spotted (for me) by observing high school girls around college guys. Maybe it's because the younger crowd just assumes college kids are more knowledgeable and cool. Anything the college guy does has the high school girls reacting exactly the way he wants them to. If he wants them to buy some lie he just told, they will. If he wants them to laugh, they will. (Of course, this happens so often that some girls get a little confused and laugh at something that is obviously not funny at all.) I think it's as simple as a desire to be considered cool by someone you consider cool. This all happens in same-gender situations as well. I just find the guy/girl dynamic to be more interesting. Maybe that's why college students seem so superhuman to everybody else ... they spend a lot of time, not with the opposite gender, but with the SAME gender. It's the dorm effect. Guys spend so much time with other guys that they're just oozing masculinity. As a result, girls go wild, and vice-versa. And we all know the secret to being cool. It's evidenced by the foolish rappers who are becoming so freakin rich. You have to be ridiculous. But you have to be ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENT in your own ridiculousness. And then you're cool. That's all there is to it.

						   The Fourth of July. Woopty frickin doo. Ever since I started thinking for myself a few years ago, this holiday has become the equivalent of a funeral. This is a day for grieving for our nation. I think of what it was intended to be, what it should be ... and then I realize what it actually is. Most people's interpretation of the Declaration of Independence focuses on "Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness." The last four words are the ones most often remembered: the pursuit of happiness. Agh! Pursuing happiness means you will NOT find it! (See the post entitled, "The media, happiness, and Christianity.") People assume that happiness = money. Therefore, the American Dream became perverted into an endless chasing of cash. Self-serving materialism. But that isn't life, and that sure as hell isn't liberty. The concept of life is simple, but not as simple as people seem to think. Living and existing are very different things. Most Americans just exist. We're a young nation and therefore don't have a lot of history. You'd think, then, that we'd focus on the present, but we don't. We focus on the only thing not worth focusing on: the future. Worry about the present, the future falls into place. Worry about the future and the present gets away from you. This is why so many Americans waste their sorry lives working Nine-to-Fives that they'd really rather not do at all. They're busy packing money away like squirrels with nuts, not realizing that there won't be a winter. Liberty and freedom are terms we've really screwed up. Freedom isn't just the ability to choose. Everybody has that ability, it's what makes us human. No, freedom doesn't equal choice. Freedom is making the RIGHT choice. Freedom is knowing what is right and doing it. Freedom and Truth are very intertwined, in my mind.  Truth isn't just a singular concept, either. It's a relationship between the way things are and the way they ought to be. Truth has to exist in order for something to be false, right? But Truth must also exist in order for something to be true. If one thing is called true, and another false, then those things are being compared to a higher standard: Truth. I think that higher standard is absolute Truth, or the way things were intended to be; the origin of all good things. In other words, God. Freedom, for me, is seeking Truth. It isn't buying cool toys and making myself comfortable. It isn't doing whatever I want. As Five Iron Frenzy sings, "Sorry for my lack of faith, I'm not the greatest patriot/ If this is all there is to freedom I don't want it." So shoot off those fireworks and celebrate simply because we're supposed to be. I'll probably enjoy the flames just because they're burning. But at the same time, I'll be grieving because nobody knows what freedom is, anymore. On a less serious note, I'm reflecting on some of the taxes leading up to the American Revolution. Remember how Americans got pissed over some ridiculous tax on tea? Well, gas prices, although lower, are still just under two bucks. Let's frickin rebel! Want to really celebrate Independence Day? Let's go dress like Cow Creek Indians and dump gasoline into Coos Bay!

						   Old Man Scott told me the other day to read The Art of War by Sun Tzu. (He's not really old, but for some reason I can always see him as an old man.) It's a book about ancient Chinese military strategy. It sounds obscure and very boring, but this stuff can easily be applied to everyday life. All one has to do is view the battles it speaks of as daily struggles. It's great stuff. "Being unconquerable lies with yourself; being conquerable lies with the enemy." I like that one. I can't control other people, but I can control myself. "Thus the army does not maintain any constant strategic configuration of power, water has no constant shape." People should always be changing - stubbornly holding to views that no longer make sense isn't being strong, it's being stupid. Somebody whose views change over time is not a hypocrite. "Thus the pinnacle of military deployment approaches the formless. If it is formless, then even the deepest spy cannot discern it or the wise make plans against it." The advantages of staying mysterious until you choose to make yourself known. I find myself using this one in social situations. Anyway, it's a good book and isn't very lengthy. Cut out the commentary and boring drawl of the preface, introduction, historical introduction, another introduction, notes on the translation, blah blah blah, and it's deep stuff.

						   I was just writing something. (That's not the end of the story.) I made an allusion to The Great Gatsby and his worship of Daisy. And then I thought of the very teenage male tendency to create an idealized version of a girl and to then worship the image, rather than the reality. I know that creating an obsession begins with daydreaming too much about the person. You start inventing little scenarios, and you half-begin to believe they actually happened. You begin to feel an unreciprocated affinity with the object of your affection. And then you feel embarrassed, so you bottle everything up and slowly lose your mind. If you turn a girl into a goddess, all you can do is worship her. Forget talking to her, forget being equal with her, forget getting her to like you. If you think she's above you, then she will, too. It's odd how often this stuff happens to people who should know better. I think that's what being a teenager is all about: knowing what you should do (or not do), and then turning around and doing it.

						   The media doesn't want us to believe in one wrong thing. They want us to believe in so many different things that we don't really believe in any of them. It's a weapon used to render us useless, inactive, and unconvicted. Is it really a surprise, then, that 90% of Americans surveyed said they believe in God ... but don't live like it? Sure, they believe in God. But they also buy into self-serving materialism and the endless pursuit of "happiness." What is happiness, anyway? Finding happiness isn't about trying a bunch of different lifestyles, it's about dedicating your life to a single goal and gaining satisfaction from getting closer to it. Those who go looking for happiness never find it. The ones who find it don't set out looking for it; they are rewarded with it. If you're seeking pleasure, you're only going to find pain. But if you look beyond yourself and your own comfort, you'll find something that will make you content. Life doesn't become easier, you just get more satisfaction out of it. I won't say God is that thing FOR ME, because Christ is for all of humanity. (As my friend once said passionately in a crowded Mexican church.) I say these things because the way Christ lived is the way we should live. Of course, we can't. We've already failed. But the closer I get and the harder I try, the more satisfying my life becomes. And I'm not the only one. The strongest Christians I know are also the happiest people I know. I believe we're supposed to live like Christ because we're happiest that way. Christianity isn't about following a bunch of regulations. "Don't do this" rules are worthless. It's about genuinely striving FOR God, not AWAY from sin. Does this mean I'm labeling a lot of church-going, Bible-believing Christians as having the entirely wrong focus? You bet I am. But I also recognize that I've been guilty of the same thing for a long time. Staying out of trouble, for the most part, is not enough. And neither is just believing. I really need to work on acting out what I believe. Scratch that - if I don't act out what I say I believe, I must not really believe it. The truth is not something you can just believe. If you really understand it to be truth, you cannot help but act on it. Faith is made complete by action. I'm sick of being inactive.

						   Wouldn't it be great if this blog thing became the chronicle of my march into madness? That'd be awesome, if every time I posted some worthless rant I slipped further into the clutches of insanity. And then when people started to wonder, "What went wrong with that kid?" they could just get online and say, "Oh." The funny thing about this is that once I start posting something, I just follow my thought process and write everything down. New post, new post, new post, okay, done. I mean, these posts may be pointless, but it's good practice at not censoring what I say. Like right now, if I was honest, I would write that I'm thinking about that green eyed girl. Not in a creepy, horny, eyes-glazed-over kind of way, but just in the screensaver of my mind. Like commercials to my scheduled thoughts. It's hot in this house. Why is there a spoon in the bathroom? I'm hungry.

						   Writing prose just doesn't impress girls. They couldn't care less what you write, as long as you call yourself a writer. Girls don't like art, they like artists. So why is it that poetry is such a goddamn romantic form of expression? Especially bad poetry. The thing about poetry is that I could write a terrible poem and nobody would criticize it. "Wow, that's very ... genuine." What the crap does that mean, anyway? Someone needs to have the guts to say, "Wow, that really sucks." I mean, nobody really gets into poetry because they actually enjoy it. They write poetry to get laid.  It's like playing the guitar. What makes a guy with a guitar so irresistable to girls? It doesn't even matter if he can play it. As long as he sits around with it and strums it every once in a while, he's an artist. It's the same deal as poetry. Sure, you might start to enjoy playing once you've been learning for a while. But initially, you want to learn because you'll suddenly become sexy. Next thing you know, you've grown out your hair, started saying 'dude' a lot, and have taken up surfing. Maybe teenagers have less patience with prose because it's not immediate gratification. You have to, like, READ a lot. Poems are short: it's their chief charm and only redeeming aspect. Prose can ramble on for pages, like this kind of stuff. No, high schoolers like poetry because it doesn't have to make sense. Incoherent poetry is artistic; incoherent prose is irritating. We all know that teenagers (girls in particular) are infatuated with EMOTION, rather than REASON. That's why prose is less exciting, then. It makes sense. I suspect this is how people lose their minds. They allow their mind to wander too much, and then they try to make sense of things that have nothing to do with sense. This must be why more mathematicians lose their minds than poets. (Or because poets start off insane.) I really have no delusions about people actually reading this stuff. I wouldn't read it. That is, of course, why I write it. If anybody does, post a comment about how random and pointless this crap is.

						   Let's face it, respect for women is highly unfashionable these days. Men don't respect women, and as a result, most women don't respect themselves. And then those women raise men who won't respect anybody. Okay, so maybe it's not as bad as all that. But I can't stand seeing the way guys my age treat girls. If a guy's hands aren't all over them, his eyes are. And girls not only allow them to do it, they encourage it. If there was more intelligible dialogue between teenage guys and girls, it would go something like this: Guy: "What's your name?" Girl: "Hee hee." Guy: "Sweet. Would you like a superficial relationship in which I will disrespect you physically, mentally, and emotionally, and will eventually and unsurprisingly break your heart and drive you into the arms of another asshole?" Girl: "Okay! Hee hee." Guy: "Sweet, dude." I'm sure both parties involved are, deep down, more intelligent than that, but high school kids aren't very open about intelligence. It's something they'd rather hide and be ashamed of. Maybe if I start throwing the word "ho" around and call girls "my bitches" I'll be able to get a girlfriend and have a superficial relationship. But I won't call it superficial. I'll deceive myself into thinking I'm in love.

						   I used to be very much a loner. This may have been due to some unfortunate combination of personality flaws, but mostly I was happy with it. I still like keeping to myself, but now I have learned to do it in small doses. I have slowly turned myself into a more social beast. And here's why: You lose your frickin mind if you don't interact with other people on your own free will. School doesn't cut it, and neither does the Internet. Eventually, you spiral into the ridiculous (yet very real) abyss of depression. Thinking too much is a problem. And people don't think. A person thinks, but people don't. This is why it is so vital for a person to spend time as a people. Okay, so people think from time to time. Small groups of people are capable of thought, at least to the extent to tell you when you're losing your mind. That's what friends are for, after all: to make sure you don't think too highly of your own fanciful ideas. An unhealthy amount of thought leads to an unhealthy lack of action. Lack of action leads to a lack of normal emotions. Lack of emotion leads to a numbness that renders even thought useless. The person becomes a shell. They lose the ability to communicate because they don't care enough to try. I don't especially know why I'm writing about this right now, other than to fill this woefully inadequate blog with material. I take it back, I'm writing about this because it happened to me once, and now I see it happening to someone else. I love writing when I'm tired. It makes me feel so much more intelligent. I'm writing stuff that would make me throw up if I was well rested. That's what the Internet is for; airing our moral prejudices, or lack thereof. That's completely unrelated to anything I just wrote, but I had a sudden impulse. I'm not one to censor myself.

						   I returned from my mission trip about three days ago. I won't say what I learned in this post: I'll be posting that stuff in little bursts as I go through my journal from the trip. No, this particular post will serve to reflect on my wonderful ability to make an idiot of myself. You see, I'm a guy. And as a result, girls occupy a certain portion of my thoughts. Well, I usually keep it to one girl at a time, but you know what I mean. After returning home from the trip, I wasted no time in demonstrating my uncanny skill to repulse women. When I'm attracted to a girl, I just up and tell her. It's just my style. It hasn't served me too well so far, as I've been rejected every time, but I think that's just who I am, not what I do.  There was this girl with deadly green eyes that I got to know better while on the trip. Yes indeed, it was once again time to cause myself unnecessary pain. The bottom line is I was, once again, rejected, and shall remain alone. It's terrible how some girls can reject you so subtly and kindly. It's just enough to give you false hope, but not enough to give you any real hope for a relationship. I didn't initially plan on writing about this crap (girls), but shoot, I might as well. This is what people come to these sites for, right? Some stupid teenager bitching about the opposite sex? People will lap it up. Anyway, I think this is the world's way of reminding me that monks still exist. If it becomes too much, I'll just shave my damn head and wear some of those stylish robes. And a cloak. I've always wanted to wear a cloak. No, it's not that bad. I'm far too used to rejection to be too affected by it.

						   Tomorrow I will leave for glorious Anaheim and Disney Land. Expect no posts for a four day period. I will return for a brief time and will then leave for a week in beautiful San Diego. I might have Internet access down there, so I might update a bit. Not that anybody cares - I'm still convinced that this blog is not a matter of life and death to most people. By the way,  Adventures in Missing the Point  is a brilliant book. The cover reads, "How the culture-controlled church neutered the Gospel." Great stuff. Farewell blog, for a time. I shall return to you if I don't meet my doom along the course of my travels.

						   I just read Krispin's post and I can identify with a lot of it. I like the brutal honesty of that Pedro the Lion song.   urlLink http://randomyousay.blogspot.com/    Some days I don't love you at all.  I'm too busy loving myself.  I too would like to spend some time honestly reflecting on my unrest. I often feel like I can't really begin living until I get out of college. I convince myself that I'm trapped in a kind of limbo because school dominates what I do. It's a weak excuse that I use to pardon my lack of living. Of course I'm not to blame, right? It's not my fault I'm not living the way I want to. I'm calling my own bullshit. You know what they say: the way you go about your day is the way you live your life. So what the hell am I doing? Nothing of much consequence. I won't say that everything I do is useless because I think relationships are important. I've built a lot of new and better friendships this summer and I think that's worth something. Cliched, sure, but what else am I here for? Spiritually I've grown a lot this summer, but only on the intellectual side of things. And I don't feel like I've really affected anybody else spiritually. If I don't do that soon, my faith will fester like a sore and then fade. I need to grow my faith outside myself or I'm going to suffocate. So what to do? Where to start? It starts in my thoughts, I know. So I actually think I've done well training my thinking: but that's only the beginning. It is only training for the action that should be flowing out of me and from my genuine faith. I'm going on vacation for a couple weeks. I'll be around crowds of complete strangers - a spiritually target-rich environment. This should be a proving ground for my faith. Now, I don't mean to say that I'm going to prance around Disney Land proclaiming God's love. Not with words, anyway. There are plenty of other ways to affect people in small ways and if I can't even manage those, what the hell good am I? How can I expect to show love if I can't show common courtesy? That's really what I'm talking about, because the 'happiest place on earth' often makes one turn into an asshole. This is what irritates me, though. I want to be doing bigger things than being nice to people. How easy is that? I feel so useless. I think San Diego, the next spot on my tour, will offer me some better opportunities. I should have the chance to go to my cousin's youth group there, so you never know what will happen. Maybe I'll find my inspiration there. Mainly though, I need to find it within myself. I always expect to be inspired, rather than to inspire. Maybe that's why I'm so spiritually ineffective.

						   Why post when I feel uninspired? Good question. I've debated it with myself at length, and I finally convinced myself: if I don't post unless I feel inspired, I'll never feel inspired and I'll never post. Sometimes you have to just start writing and hope for the best. If I don't make it a habit, I'll never do it. So anyway, there arose a funny (immature) situation today. Josh, AJ, Krispin and I were chilling in Josh's computer room. Josh was at the computer, engrossed, while Krispin stood and fidgeted with his ... jeans. AJ looked at Krispin in horror, then looked at me as though appealing to me for normalcy. I had my finger in my nose at the time. Needless to say, he didn't find the support he was expecting. It was a pretty ridiculous collection of happenings and I thought I'd share it with the world (i.e. the few people who read this garbage). I wonder, do other people write on their blogs with the mentality that they're writing  for  someone? As though they're writing for someone else's benefit? I never do. I go in with the assumption that anything I write will probably not be of any consequence to anyone else but me. But I write anyway, because it helps me think about things. Most of the time I'm merely typing as I think and what surfaces, does. That's the end of the story. I'm certainly not here to impress anyone, so what does it matter if I write pointless crap 99% of the time? And besides, if I didn't write trash on so many occasions it would give you a wrong impression of what I'm really like. If I didn't post something unless it was brilliant, people would read the successive brilliant posts and think, "Wow, he's brilliant." And I'm not. Just look at this post. It's obvious. Okay, I don't think I'm in any danger of being mistaken for brilliant on the best of days. And right now, I'm dog-tired and hardly know what I'm typing. I could delete things that are stupid or unnecessary or stupid, but it's far more interesting to leave them. I find that whenever I write late at night, two things happen: one, I never have much of a point and two, I put commas, in really weird places. That one was on purpose, though. I swear. I'm sick of this. I'm leaving.

						    "Whenever people talk to me about the weather, I always feel certain that they mean something else."  ~Oscar Wilde  It's too sunny outside. It's too freakin hot. One of those days that I'd rather spend in the shade, or inside. And yet, I went on a walk earlier. The sun is an absolute nuisance, sometimes. It makes me sweat, which then makes me realize that I stink. It even burns me if I'm in it too long. It's a relief when night falls, really; that is, until you realize the sun isn't so bad. Sure, its heat is uncomfortable on days like this, but at least you can see what you're doing. And you can see other things for what they are rather than guessing at vague shapes and shadows. I don't like electric light at all. I used to, but I've since changed my mind. It's so fake. It just doesn't feel right once you learn to appreciate the sun.

						   So a couple guys at the News Review were talking about this paper in Colorado that wanted some freelance crap. Get this: this paper paid $50 for a 13-inch story, which is about 500 words! Fifty freakin dollars! I've written somewhere around 20,000 words on this blog. Divide that by 500 and you get 40. Multiply that by 50 and you have $2000. Too bad I don't get paid for this - I'd be rich. Richer at least. Like $2000 richer. Which is a lot of money compared to what I'm sitting on. Child support money isn't so bad, though. Free money. Ha.

						   I wonder, in what way did you interpret that  ugh ? I've been slacking off on that short story. Everybody send me angry emails so that I'll get back to work. I'm tired, I have to get up tomorrow, and I'm feeling ill from the cookies I just ate. Just thought I'd get all the negativity out of the way so that I can be my usual cheery self for the rest of the post. Don't worry, it'll be short. It has no purpose yet. I guess I can write out something that I was saying earlier, just for the sake of being supercilious. I was talking with Josh the Philosopher and Krispin the Poet about a wide variety of subjects, and were discussing all these things that we  thought.  Finally, the conversation got around to thought itself. Our deepest, darkest thoughts don't really have words, do they? We don't naturally subvocalize, I don't think. It might seem like we do, but think about it: we were taught language, not the process of thinking. Language becomes the expression of our thoughts - our inner dialogue is really just another outlet of something deeper. To put it simply, if someone was raised without learning language, they would still think and feel and be human, wouldn't they? They would just express it differently. So what is thought? Good question. The answer? I don't know. Which is a comforting thought, I think. Which is exactly the point: I think. Yeah, that's it. It's a verb, not a noun. Difficult concept to grasp - maybe impossible. It's late, I'm tripping.

						   I'm extremely tired. And it's only around one o'clock. Then again, I had to get up like at eight today - life is so hard. Whatever the case, I thought that being really tired and loopy is a great time to write .... about nothing of any consequence. I wonder how many posts like this I have. Many. Crap, now I feel obligated to write. But I'm all writed out today. I wrote some prose, as usual, and I even wrote a song. Once again, Josh the Philosopher and I teamed up to create a new summer hit. I write the lyrics, he writes the music and plays the guitar. Of course, this second song is meant to be performed by a band, whereas the first is a solo acoustic piece. The first song is a cautionary tale about a raccoon and it's a ballad. We wrote it on Lake Shasta and performed it for the camp. It's titled  The Myth of the Greener Grass . It's about a raccoon trying to cross the road to a new land, but he gets squished. The second song is a Weezer/Green Day/other stuff inspired piece. I call it  My Cynical Love Song . It's a great song for anyone who has ever gotten sick of the countless love songs out there. And it's a very catchy tune. Lots of fun to write - plenty of bitterness to draw on. Well, that's all I feel like writing for now. If anyone has any good ideas for a song, post a comment and maybe I'll write it tomorrow.

						   If you haven't at least seen the movie  The Fellowship of the Ring , you may want to skip over this. As a matter of fact, if you haven't read the books or seen the movies, don't burden other people with your presence. You're useless to society. Anyway, I watched  Fellowship  last night - extended edition, of course. I hadn't seen it in a while and I was struck anew by the character of Boromir. He is such a great representation of the double-edged sword of patriotism. On the one hand, he has a beautiful love for his country and his people. He has dedicated his life to protecting those things and he genuinely considers his people above himself. But that's exactly the problem. It's the reason why so many atrocities have been committed by people in the name of their country. Oscar Wilde described patriotism as 'the virtue of the vicious.' Bertrand Russel said it is, 'the willingness to kill and be killed for trivial reasons.' You can't let yourself be blinded by a false ideal that think is your country. Then you're just using it as an excuse to compromise your own morals. Boromir had a genuine desire to protect his people, which I think is very admirable. But the means by which he wanted to accomplish that was where he stumbled. He wanted the Ring for himself so that he could  destroy  those who wanted to destroy Gondor.  Destruction  would have been the embodiment of his patriotism. That's the problem with loving your country: it leads to hating other ones. George Bernard Shaw sums it up well: "Patriotism is your conviction that this country is superior to all other countries because you were born in it." (And yes, I did stumble upon a list of quotes about patriotism ... I was trying to find a particular Oscar Wilde one, which I did  not  find.) Not surprisingly, my examination of an unsatisfactory subject has led me back to pride. It convinces me further that arrogance is the root of all sin. It is really the  original  sin ... it's what caused sin. Thinking you know better than God. It's what turned Satan, one of God's most beautiful creations, into the Father of Lies - a rebel and an abomination. Pride is certainly something I struggle with. I'm the most arrogant person I know. Well, I suspect it of others; I just can't prove it. Like the people that refuse to admit that they're prideful - now  that  is arrogant.

						   There's a basic flaw with blogs: no matter how you slice it, it's an ego trip. Even if people don't read your stuff, you convince yourself that they do. And if they do read it then you have even more inspiration to be arrogant. What do I write about, anyway? Me. I write about me and my thoughts. Even when I write about other people, I'm writing words that will be attributed to me ... that's why I'm writing them. One, so they'll be read. Two, so people will know they were written by me. Writing is prideful by nature. Blogs especially. It's intellectual bragging, even if your thoughts aren't good ones. No,  especially  if your thoughts aren't good ones. It's funny how people rarely brag about what they have reason to brag about: we prefer to vainly compensate for our weaknesses. Writing is basically self-centered. It's all about the author's ideas, what he or she wants to communicate to the reader. Writing isn't so much about expression as being understood. There's a difference, I think. What good is expression if no one can identify with it? Writing is the extension of one lonely human mind to another, desperately trying to share thoughts and experiences with another soul. Because when you think about it, we're really locked in our own little worlds. Our only window to what we call reality is our senses. It's like looking at the neighbor's backyard through a hole in the fence. You can see parts of it, but you realize there's a lot more there, that just because you can't see all of it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Another human mind is like the neighbor's house: you can get a general idea of what it appears to be, and you can make guesses as to what it's like inside. But you can never enter it so you'll always have to wonder. We have such a limited perspective on the world. I guess that's why writing is important - it's a window into that neighbor's house. It still doesn't allow you to see much, but it's better than nothing.

						   I look down on people who do drugs, drink excessively, and have sex outside of marriage. I hate that I do but it's the truth. Disgustingly enough, I tend to think I'm better because I have not just morals, but  the  morals we are meant to live by. I firmly believe that following Christ is the path we are supposed to follow. I think that it's insane, however, to apply a Christian standard to people who believe differently. It's finally beginning to sink in how completely ridiculous and prideful I am. Hedonistic and atheistic people are not necessarily stupid because of what they do: as a matter of fact, based on their disbelief in God, it makes perfect sense to live the way they do. I would too if I didn't believe what I do. Think about it - if life really is meaningless, there is no life after death, and there is no divine accountability for our actions, why not fill your life with pleasure and excess? Why not do whatever you want? Of course, these types of people often fail to see future consequences for their actions if the effects are not immediately apparent. This isn't ignorant at all in most cases, because a lot of the time it appears to me as though such lifestyles go without extraordinary suffering. I'm no fortune teller, either. I can barely see past my own nose. So, although I believe these people are wrong in what they do, it is much more important to recognize that they are wrong in what they think. But what they think is logical based on their basic belief that there is no God. It is ridiculous for me to explain to them that what they are doing is wrong if they think the term is relative. When I'm dealing with an atheistic non-Christian, then, I must appeal to their reason, not their morality, and I must make a case for the existence of a Creator in the first place. Basically then, when I'm saying people are wrong for their beliefs, I should ignore that fact entirely and zero in on the origin of their mistaken yet proceedingly 'logical' beliefs. For clarity's sake, I shouldn't think of their secondary beliefs as right or wrong at all. It is of no consequence. It is only important for me to think them wrong on one count, and that is their disbelief in a Supreme Being. Everything else stems from that all-important fact. If someone grasps the enormity of that fact and they genuinely understand it as far as a human is capable of, then they will act on the truth. It is an irresistable force, the truth: once you know it, you  know  it, and you lose the ability not to do something with it. So for somebody to say, "I believe in God; I just don't care," means they don't  really  believe. He is irresistable and infinitely convicting, and if you know him you cannot help but love him, and if you love him you cannot help but do what he says. Above all, you cannot cease to know him. The truth can be masked by lies, but it can never be destroyed by them. Once you know the truth, you cannot unknow it. You may convince yourself otherwise for a time, but it will find you again.

						   I attended the Oregon Junior Miss thing tonight and I must say that the judges were out of their minds. Becca the Beauty Queen played the piano like a champ. It really was incredible, and they didn't even make her a finalist. I wanted to rough them up in the parking lot. I mean, if Becca really doesn't represent what Junior Miss stands for then the program is bunk. That's right, bunk. Looking at the other girls, I got the feeling that Becca just isn't fake enough for that sort of thing. She's entirely too genuine to fit their sickening mold: poise and current events and all that crap. It's like training to  pretend  to care about things without caring at all. It's like they want these girls to be able to appear perfect, whether they are or not. If that's what you call being 'proper,' I think people are better off being savages. I think that in actuality, Becca is too good for Junior Miss. And I mean it. I don't have much respect left for the program, really. So die, Junior Miss. The program ... not the girl.

						   I'm back (obviously) and discovered that our DSL finally works. Ah, the glories of civilized surfing. No more vulgar and primitive dial-up. I broke it in by downloading an entire cd - Emery. It's some strange blend of hardcore and emo that some refer to as 'Screamo.' Got that suggestion from Krispin the Poet, or Krispin the Emo Kid, whichever you prefer. Shasta was a great experience. It felt like a lot smaller group this year and I liked it better that way. The temperature never got unbearably hot,  much  unlike last year. I got some reading done, too. I finally finished  1984 , which is so depressing and hopeless that it inspires hope in the reader. Very cautionary story. Anyway, I'm also reading  The Case for Faith  by Lee Strobel, and I highly recommend it. It addresses some of the toughest objections to Christianity (for example, how can God be good if he tortures people in hell?) in the form of interviews with different 'specialists' on the varying subjects. A lot of people turn their noses up at books like  The Case for Faith  simply because they think it's Christian propaganda - some one-sided, cheap, manipulative advertisement for Christianity. Well, it ain't that at all. The author's role in the interviews is to bring up the best arguments against God, basically, and force the person to refute them. It's good stuff and most people (non-Christians included) could really enjoy it. As a matter of fact, I think it's a perfect book for anybody who has heard what Christianity is about and isn't so sure about it. Speaking of Christianity and books, I'm trying to obtain a really cool translation of the Bible called  The Message . It's written in a very modern and informal style and is infinitely more interesting to read than  NIV . It really gets the sarcasm across. I'm serious - especially in the New Testament, things are very sarcastic. Here's James 1:26-27.   Anyone who sets himself up as "religious" by talking a good game is self-deceived. This kind of religion is hot air and only hot air. Real religion, the kind that passes muster before God the Father, is this: Reach out to the homeless and loveless in their plight, and guard against corruption from the godless world.     I just grabbed that at random from  urlLink http://www.biblegateway.com/ , but you get the idea. I love seeing phrases like 'talking a good game' and 'only hot air' in the Bible. But think about it: the New Testament in particular was written in a simple style meant to be understood by the average person of that time period. It wasn't meant to be fancy or formal, but personal and convicting and in-your-face. I can't wait to get my hands on  The Message  in the form of an actual Bible. Reading online just isn't as satisfying as holding a book in your hands.

						   The word 'lazy' is tossed around carelessly. It's shameful.  Wait ... I've already written about this in my journal. I'm going to cheat and copy stuff out of it. Never mind. It's too seriously written. My mom says I'm lazy because I don't have an actual job. I point out that I  will  have a job when school starts, that I'll be gone most of the month of August, and that even if I did get a job I wouldn't get paid until the end of the month. Yet I am expected to pull money out of my ass, I guess. True, I spend more than I need to and I don't earn what I spend. What can I say? I'm pretty apathetic toward work - I only care about money in terms of food and gas. Those things tend to allow me to interact with the people I enjoy being around. Lazy is a strange term. Is it knowing what you ought to do and not doing it? Crap ... according to James that's a sin. I'm a sinner. But wait: ought I to be working and getting paid? James actually said that he who knows the  good  he ought to do and doesn't do it sins. Now things get subjective. Is it good for me to generate some cash and take the pressure of my mom? But my dad pays child support and my money comes out of that. My mom doesn't even have a job. But that's irrelevant because this is about me working, not her. I think that if I worked I would feel too busy for youth group stuff, as well as Finding the Plot. (Which was spectacularly undermanned last meeting.) I find fellowship and spiritual growth to be a lot more important than work, but I can still see the value in working harder. Oh well. None of it matters, anyway. I'll be working once school starts. This was really just an excuse to ramble on senselessly.
