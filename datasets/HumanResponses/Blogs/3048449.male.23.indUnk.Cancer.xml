      Ahhh...another day of total boredom and nothing to do. As usual I am just surfing the net, downloading movies.  I have just recently given up smoking, and for all you smokers out there you will know that this is no small feat. I'd kill for a smoke right now. I have take to smoking the last drag of every smoke I can get my hands on...and I know that's a little bit disturbing.  I decided to give up because I cannot afford it anymore, and I would rather eat than have a smoke. This morning I was out playing with my two puppies to make giving up easier...and one of my puppies (ho) decided to bring me a little present.  It was a dead Joey...Some road kill that he had found.  Every time I try to take it off him he has a go at me...So I'm just going to let him have his prize.  Little does he know that he is being locked up today.  Me and my partner have  a lot of trouble trying to lock our puppies up.  It all started a couple of months ago...They were pretty young and never left the property...So it was fine to let the rome the three acres we have. But then Ho's ball dropped and all hell let loose. Now nomatter where he goes princess is sure to follow...which isn't good. Now all they ever do is annoy the neighbours catlle...and princees always bring home a piece of cow shit to show us that she has bee on a wonderfull trip.  She is so poud of herself...i wish she wouldn't do that.  They are currently sleeping on the matress outside (their bed) and for once they are not fighting, or chasing possoms...so i'm finally getting some peace and quite.  Which is hard to do around this house.  Well that's all the shit i have for now.  All i have to do now is get a job, and get the car fixed and i'll be set...

      Shit comes with life and all it's little insecurity.  Over the past 14 months i have endured the most painfull crap that anyone could handle.  Including many relationships, broken friendships, and have been dissowned by my family members (who still owe me money).  I Been through countlees court cases, because of my driving record and yet, i find myself back in the same situation. These are the stories of those time.  Some being funny and some being donwright nasty. i hope you enjoy...

      Insomnia and insanity seem to fit very well together... I find myself getting more and more insane.  I cannot sleep because of all the pressure and stress of life that I have been put through lately.  Life is like a box of chocolates, everything is shit and you never get what you want. This is one thing that I used to believe with all my heart. Well I no longer believe that. After all that I have been through…and my loud mouth approach to things, (in my last blog entry)… I have been looking at things a lot differently since I got proposed to.  I’m getting married…the date is not set yet, but it’s a working progress.  My partner and I have managed to sort out al my differences and my life has never been better. I have myself a well paying job and will be able to get my car back on the road, pay off some bills and hopefully be able to shout my Fiancé to some well deserved meals.  I have some other good news, (while I’m at it). My two puppies are now locked up.  Which happens to be a good thing as the Park ranger showed up at 8.15 this morning. I’m holding my housewarming party as once planned and I have cut the guest list down quit a lot.  That means not as much food and grog to buy…  Just something out of the blue here.  I was talking to my mother on the phone today…and she bought the most wonderful thing to my attention.  I would not be the person I am to if I hadn’t of gone through all the crap in my life.  If you get to know me, you will find out that I have a good heart, with no bad intention, just a lot of empathy for those around me.  I have not got many friends left…But I made another one tonight.  She works at the local Bp Servo down the road…and though I have seen her a lot and talked to her…I never got to know her.  My partner gets along with her very well and finally I am starting to feel like my life is getting back to what it’s meant to be.  So to you all…I offer you a drink of goodwill, to all the old times, the old life I once lived…and to the new life I have made for myself.  So I offer you this glimpse into my life, and this little chunk of advice. Cherish life, all the good times, the bad times and everything that comes with it.  It is the only one you get.

      If i offended people with my last post i ami not sorry. It has been bought to my attention by my "So-called" friends that all i am is a piece of shit.  I will not justify my thoughts to those people, if my so-called friends liked me for who i was..they would not criticise me for my actions.  I do no want to be friends with them anymore.  They can all go to hell...block me on there Msn lists and never hear from me again, and that's all i have to say on the situation. Why should i have to defend myslef to the likes of them?   So to all you others out ther i bid you goodnight. Be sure to keep reading.

      Memories are usually what dreams are made of... I have some news. For those who tell you that talking cannot solve anything..i bid you wrong. After a long hertfelt decussion with my partner (who i thought was kicking me out), i have resolved my differences, which happens to be good news to me. I don't have to leave the person i love, the dogs i love or the new life that i have made for myself up here. Yay.  Last week i decided to invite one of my closest friends over for the weekend.  Bad idea. Rob (an old mate who i went to school with) bassically insulted me, the way i live, and told me that i was a worthless bum who would not be able to achieve anything in life. I have justhave to prove him wrong. I am trying my hardest to make a better life for myslef and my partner.  I have just managed to find myself a well paying job doing Nightfill at the local Safeway...and for those of you who do not know what that is...it's a certified Shelve Stacker...lol :p I start in two weeks which will hopefully help my finacial situation out.   Not much has been going on in my life at the moment. The bills aren't getting paid...i'll be 23 on 16th July, My partner lost her job before she even started it...and my two dogs got out and nearly got shot.  Where to start? Yesterday morning after a long night on the Dope (figure of speech)...i was awoken to a person who was our next door neighboure...who i had never meet before...well it seems that my two dogs have been getting out for the past couple of week and annoying his cattle... Which is in there natural instinc. Well to my surprise he told me "lock them up, or by the end of the day...or i will shoot them". I was quit angry...so i have spent the past two days locking them up... If he shoots my dogs i will shoot his cattle.  All this happend after i had a car accident, i backed into a tree and smashed the car...they say things happen in threes...well here is the third. My partner was recently given a job at Telstra..weel she was over the moon..and so was I...well i day before she started the rang her up at !0pm...and said to her that the position she had applyed for was no longer avalable....and this was done after she had signed an employement contract. So i thought i would take them to court....well it seems that this lovely phone company has screwed us over again...she has no legal rights to them doing this... So now we are back to square one, she has no job and the bastards always seem to get away with shit like this.  Well seeming that it's past 4am i better be off....hope you had a good read and i'll be updating this more regulary from now on.

      When life becomes shit, you become insane.  I was told this by a very wise man once and never took him to seriously. Well after the past week i believe it more than i belive the stars shine at night and the sky is blue.  Over the past two months my partner has been telling me she wants to have my kids. So we made a decision together for her to go off the pill, And low and behold...she fell pregnant. Well After that shit hit the fan. She said that we would make a decision together. Well that didn't happen. One night I was walking through the bath room and she told me to sit down because we needed to talk.  She said that in all reality we could not afford a kid so she was having an abortion. I felt that I had no part in this decision, and that is why I told her I was going to leave, and now everything is screwed.  I felt that I was led on, and that in one week she basically told me that she was not ready for a commitment, and that I have lied to her time and time again.  That is why I got so pissed off and acted hastily, broke the window (which on my part was wrong) and royally fucked life up as i know it.  Did i have any right to say what i said? or was it just "emotional Blackmale" as she love to say?     So now it's all over, the dream i once dreamt is now shatered...with nothing but memories remaining. I have a week to move out..and no place to go...so i do not know if i will have a net connection to finish this...but i hope i will.

      This is just a general Bitch Session...  It has taken me a while to come to this conclusion...but my life just keeps on getting more boring.  I find myself being stuck at home and typing on the computer. Not a life that i once imagened... Well i know one thing, I have figured out that i'm going to do something with my life, i just haven't figured out what that is yet?  Over the past week i have been form a couple of job interviews, payed the rent and payed to get the phone reconected.  money is a little tight at the moment if you hadn't of geussed. I find myself counting every cent that i have...and not eating because i cannot afford to.   And the beat goes on... I acctually do have some good news.  My puppies are no longer getign out...it has been nearly two weeks and they have tried countless times, but to my surprise they are still locked up in there yard where they are ment to be.   The wedding plans are going good and my partner and I are trying to decided on the flowers...and of course the date... We don't know when it will be yet, proberbably about 4th December 2005. I'm looking forward to it. (But don't tell my partner).  She has a new hobbie now...we are going into bird breeding, which i hate. Well hate it such a strong word...i have always had a fear of birds and it has taken me about foru months to get used to Lucky (the pet Budgie)...and now we are going to be breeding Finches.  I hoop it all works out in the end.   Well there's not much more to say realy...i hope you are enjoying your life...and i hope you keep on reading.

      I'm trying to figure out a name for my mentally insane rabbit... And on that note you may be wondering what the hell I am talking about?  After weeks of concept and enduring pain i have finally decided to start my own web page. This website is taking a hell of a lot to get up and running, but basically it's about a rabbit who is suffering from depression and has A multipul personality disorder. "The idea came to me one day when i fell off my toilet seat and hit my head on the tiling", to Quote a very famous movie...  Not realy, I was sitting down, thinking about life and all that comes with it, and something reminded me of the old Tiny Tunes cartoons that I used to watch many years ago. Basically it all stemed from that.  Well...enough about me, and more about me.  I have good news that is of no relitive importance. After all the fucking around and all the countless interviews...or interigations as i like to call them. I finally have myself a high paying job. But that is not the best part. How's this for Ironic. I am currently signed up with a couple of Job network companies. At one particular place  they bought me a new $400 suit...and sent me for a shit load of job interviews... I have never got a job through them...after months of trying, a job network palce rang me out of the blue and said that I start at a job on Tuesday. No interview..nothing. Makes me a little happy inside.  And of all palces i work at a hospital. For those who dont know me.  All my life i have feard and revolted hospitals..now I work in one...doing what i love the most. I repair circut boards on the Iv drips all day...and I know that it might sound a little boring to you, but to me, this is ablessing...because i love electronics so much.  All that i have to say about that is: "He's a working class man".  And on another note. B-Sharp.. I finally proposed to Sarah (my partner). It was a cold winters night...and i finnally sold my car engines...I got the ring earlier that day...so out of the blue i decided to take her out for a nice meal.  At this point i think she was starting to catch on...so I told her that we were going for a drive for the hell of it. I drove to geelong (which is about an hour from my place). and took her to a nice resturant for coffee on the waterfront. It was about ten ten minutes to 11 on this Tuesday evening...and I took her out onto a pier...with all the city lights in the backgroung, i got dowh on one knee...and asked her to be my wife.  I made her cry. It was the most special night of my life...  And with that soppy note...i think i will end it...and the next time i post i hope i will have a link up to my webpage with the insane rabbit.  "Life is what you make of it, so don't make it too much. Someone will end up killing you for what you have"...  :P

        The last week has been total pain and suffering for me.   After recent events that has caused stress levels beyond belief, I was recently hit with a bout of  Conjuntivitis   . This I get often,  but  it does not usually have this  effect  on me. I have lost all vision in my left eye. I have gone blind.  This is no doubt my fault.  My   urlLink   Princess     was trying to get me to the doctors for a week before I went.     Well enough with all this self pity crap , And onto all the other  self pity crap  . Just a quick update. My court date is coming up soon and i'm pre-paring like mad. I have to get back in contact with my soliciter becuse he is the only one that has some very important documents that might help me in my case. I was only charged with 5 traffic offences...which is realy good considering that was going to be charged with 18 traffic offences. The Cops  seem to think that i will be slapped with a small fine and will lose my license for 6 months. I hope so. On top of all that they put my   urlLink   Princess    ' car off the road...which we cannot aford to get it back up and running, so we are stuck running around in the corrola (the crappy car). I have been talking to a mate who is a lawey, he seems to think that i will be able to sue the police force for putting the car of the road, because I live so far out of town and the other car has been deemed un-reliable by a machnic. So if everything works out (which it often doesn't), I will be able to get the other car back on the road. (fingures crossed).     I have recently become a regular reader of my horiscope. I do not believe in them, but i use them to have a laugh at and to lighten up my day.      This is my weekly  urlLink horiscope:       Sure, you could buy a new car, but you'd need to get a new garage to store it in. At a certain point, you just have to put a halt to the shopping. Sure, it's fun, but so is a lively conversation. (And when was the last time you had one of those?) Get all your friends together sometime during the middle of the week and just hang out like you used to. You're going to wind up spending so much time at home this weekend (there are all kinds of issues brewing at home) that you'll be glad you did.    I found this very funny considering I have no firends or money. I thought i might just leave you on that good note. And i hope you keep on reading...

      It's official.  Life couldn't get much more insane. After recent events, such as, loosing my job and not being able to pay the rent. The decision of me giving up smoking has been made for me. I have no money, so I can't smoke.  This in itself is making me go insane.  But to make matters worse, after all the cleaning that  urlLink  My Princess   and I have done...the place still doesn't seem to be that clean.  Well i geuss i better get on with the cleaning then....this would be a hell of a lot easier if i had a Fucking smoke or two...  To ease the pain of having to give up I have always listend to  urlLink  Metallica  . you should try it sometime. It's very relaxing.

       Hit me with you best shot.  Although this is a very popular song it is a worry when you haven't had enough sleep and all you hear is that...   Yesterday  out of  all days  I have run out of Smokes, Coke and petrol money.  All I want to do is go for a long pointless drive.  After getting about 3 hours sleep today...it was a bad thing that I had a sleep in. I woke up at 9am....Wow I hear you say? But the fact is that I had to be down in Sunbury at 10.10am to drop  urlLink  My Princess   of at the doctors.      Time Vs. Fuel   So the question is, what do you do when you don't have enough time to make the trip (normally taking 2hours), in under an hour and only have enough fuel to go at 80kms p/hr?  The answer is floor the peddle and hope to hell that you can make it there on time!  We made it with 10 minutes to spare.  After getting there pretty much with a time to spare we waited Two Fucking hours to dsee the doctor, and the we had to try and make it back home...Luckly we were left some money in sunbury (by my other halfs Parents).  So now after absolutly no sleep and coke. It's about 11am and i'm going crazy. We don't get paid 'till wednesday and  urlLink  MY Princess'   mum is coming over tomorrow. If it weren't for me being so insane i would think that life couldn't be any better.  Well that's it for now. Thing's are going to get realy fun over the next couple of days, so i will keep you all posted. So I Hope your day is better than mine...and always remeber that if you have trouble doing things in you life. Pass the Buck. That what our  urlLink "PM"  has done.

      For some reason when you think you life is going to get better, it always has a way of fucking you over.   As some of you may have noticed in a few posts back, I got myself a high paying job, working at the local hospital fixing all the IMED pumps (I.V drip's). Well I knew it was to good to be true. They fired me. Why? I hear you not ask...The simple fact that the boss man was intimidated by me...and I was late for two days out of all the days I worked.  I saw it coming.  One delightful morning I was confronted by him "you know I can't stand it when people that work for me are late". I told him why I was late (none of your business), and he backed down....I thought that was the end of it.  It wasn't, later that day he pulled me aside and told me that I have to stop intimidating him....by this point I was getting really worried...then it hit...he came to me at my desk....gave me half an hors warning...and then fired me.  Funny how life works, isn't it. So now down here next to me (on the computer Desk) the bills seem to be getting bigger and bigger as the days go on, and I have no way of paying for them.   The phone and power have been disconnected so many times I cannot count...and what's even worse than that...I have to try and find money to get the car back on the road.  It's getting me really paranoid.  paranoia is a normal part of depression, But what I'm going through at the moment seems to be more than that.  It has  consumed my life and I couldn't be fucked taking the pills...But I'm going to have to. "it's the only way to beat depression", I was told by my doctor. I must admit the do make me better. Sometimes.  It's my birthday soon. And for those who know me. I don't want a thing. Apart from a visit maybe :P   So on that note I'll leave you, and say "enjoy staying at home...don't move out, and you'll be fine"...

      A new look for an old Subject...  After recent criticism I decided to get out of all old my habbits and Look up to life. Many of you who saw my last blog, must admit, that it wasn't the best of things to look at. So on that note...a new blog, a new lease on life...and hopefully, A good read.

      Insanity at it's finest...       A idyllic life is what man kind has dreamed of since it was first thought of.  It's what we all want, and what we often don't get.   over the past week I have had to deal with a lot of past issues. My nanna is going to die very soon...and though you might think that is harsh, it is a good thing. She is close to 70...has had many heart attacks and a few strokes...now her heart is giving out...I think it is about time that she should be able to rest in peace.   Some of you may think that what I am going to write in this post is very harsh, but I feel you need to know some background information before you come to that conclusion.  For most of you who know Sylvia and for those that don't, taking a first look at her, you would think that she is the most mild mannered woman on earth.  This is not true once you get to know her.  I have never liked her that much for the way she treated my mother, and all the things she let happen.  Many years ago, when I was 16, a truth came out about her views on myself, my mother and my sister.  The way that the truth was revealed was by her giving her diary to my aunt Lisa and told her to publish it. In this diary, she revealed that, and I quote, "Annette was a failure as a daughter, and neglected me as her mother." end quote.  In other parts of the diary, she commented that Lisa as such a good daughter, whilst continually attacking my mother. Whilst she was thinking and recording these thoughts in her diary, Sylvia was using my mother as an on call maid and chauffeur.  Her one sided treatment did not end at my aunt and mother. As a child she punished my for the mistakes she believed my mother had made. On top of that there was the favoritism. If my sister and I were at Sylvia's house with my cousin Aaron, my sister and I would be feed the minimum amount, with no treats whatever. On the other hand, Aaron would be given the best food, and all the treats while we looked on.  Sylvia always said she lived a good life and never regretted a thing she did. Maybe it was the way she was brought up, or maybe she just looked at life differently...But for the actions she took when I was younger, I can never forgive her, I can just say goodbye.

      A simple life is what the fairytale say that you should have. With that notion, the phrase “Live Happily Ever after” comes into my mind. But soon, an overwhelming thing called “Reality” crushes the innocence and beauty of life.  All hopes and dreams have to given to the wind, and more important things are given your time and attention.   The self-indulgence of food when it comes to a hypercritical hypochondriac Anorexic is not a very smart way to live life.   "Ogie The Insane 2004"...    At the moment there has been a lot of things going on in my life. As some of you may have noticed by my last couple of posts, a very small thing called “money” has been guiding my life. The fact that I have is always a thought I have in the back of my mind. This has not been by my choice. My circumstances have played a major roll in this, and my actions I cannot be proud of.  Well that’s all I have for now. I guess I better leave you…
