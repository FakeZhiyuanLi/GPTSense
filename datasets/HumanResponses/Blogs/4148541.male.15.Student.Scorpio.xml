      Everything worked out. I am going to meet up with Katie and (she seems very interested) I will get 2 have dinner with her. It wasn't easy but i managed to negotiate with my parents. I am going to meet up toomorrow...(looks at clock) today....at 1:30 and we will hang for about an hour and a half.  Then I go to the riverdance and she goes shopping with her friends who are in town.  after the RD i meetup and go to dinner with her somewhere.  She seems very........permiscuous. Which is a plus.....the accent.....another plus.....likes me for my personality......another plus.........we will see what tomorrow brings.  I beat doom 3 on expert, wasnt hard. Now I am playing it on Nightmare, you lose your life points automatically.....this will be fun.....  Found my school finally Wesley College. Yes yes I know it's my name.  They want me to help manage and secure their wireless network. They have an OC line it seems so I will be able to abuse that quite nicely. I can open ports for common p2p networks and use it. just bring my Iriver to school.....leave my laptop online in a locker,  I get a good upload speed and thus a fast download speed since all the  networks I use dont allow leechers (which is a good thing). There is a downside, I have to have my computer fill up on filtering software. I will just install a keylogger whilst i do it and get the password for it.  Thats the easy way......I have others....but if I get caught I get holy hell...(religious school)  Sooooo I probably wont do it at all.....  Peace

      Well had another crapydodah day. Dad couldn't make up his mind weather he needed me to stay or not to go look @ cars. (needs to make sure my teenage legs fit in the back) Cars here are awesome they look small but they have a large amount of room inside actually. Its an optical illusion  This girl I met on Teesnspot.com is gonna meet /w me in dublin city centre on Sat. maybe something will happen. But at least I will have 1 friend in ireland.  Found out im not going to that school I posted about earlier. Now i gotta go to some other one. I think the site it www.oatlands.net .  Whatever as long as it's co ed.  Still waiting for my graphics card to show I wanna play d3 BADLY! I played it at the LAN on saturday and it was hella fun!!!!!!!!  Didnt get lunch until 4 pm and didnt eat much bfast. Meh...tomorrow will be better I hope.

      Figures...I went to this LAN thing but I couldn't play jack didly. My graphics card didnt show up. Darn that annoying. So I got to sitby while everyone else had lotsa fun :). I at least got to try doom 3 and I made some friends with common interests. Everyone was exchanging porn and illegal movies. For legal reasons:I did not participate in any of this swapping.  Having dealt with the lawyers.....  Its good to have some friends now. I still just wanna get into my house.  I am trying to coax my dad into letting me get a camera.   I am wiped it 2 am and I didnt sleep 2 much last night Im beginning to pick up misc slang. And I am getting used to the accent...I hope I get the accent before I come to visit Hope something interesting happens tomorrow.  Peace

      I went to the city centre today with my dad. It was so much fun.  First my mom dropped us off @ the Luas Line the Train that runs around dublin  which took us right to St.Stephen's green which is right next to the BIG shopping plaza. I went and looked @ digi cameras. My dad might buy 1. So yay!:)  Some ladies were checking me out....or laughing at me I couldnt tell. But they looked @ me twice. At least I am "of interest". I found a place I might be able to work its a gaming cafe where you can pay to play games on computers for Euro's.  I have to work under the table though. Anyway it was fun. I saw an adult toy shop (didnt seem like one at first) it had samurai swords and misc cool stuff and there were other kids inside so it obviously didn't look like what it was.   My bro saw the yugioh movie and was wowed by it...how suprising. My brother is such a dweeb. ERGH!  Peace

      My family just put a deposit down on a house in Leopords town. Finally.  I went and saw the entire house today. It was awesome, nice attached livingroom/sunroom with the kitchen 3 stories. I get the entire upstairs maybe :)  I will attach pictures ASAP! We can't move in until AT LEAST the 24'th when our furniture clears customs (marujana in the couch cushions? honestly)  Anyway, its a cool house lots of room.  I found out some game convention is coming to the hotel on saturday I will have my graphics card on Sat or Friday so I can go it seems :) going to meet up with a few guys I met on a Game website at the tournament.  So that will be fun.  Brother is being an asswipe as usual. Bought these stupid toy guns and he totes them around everywhere. He looks like he is part of the Irish Republican army.  He wont even let me touch them I picked them up and he immediete began crying and yelling and hitting me DAMNIT i hate him.  Peace

      I went a looked at another 2 houses. One of them was good 5 bedrooms up top (one of which quite tiny) but my dad liked it minus location. At least it is close to the luas line. A train that circles dublin.  I hope this is it cuz then I can go to dublin town center whenever I can bike to the Luas Line.   I already hate this hotel I can't wait to get out. All there is to do is computer and run on a treadmill downstairs.  I want out ACK!  Brother still being....a brother....buggy as usual....any way.  hope my stuff gets here soon. I want to go biking.      Sorry i didnt post yesterday but the internet was out for the last 24 hrs. So that sucked.  peace

           Today sucked the big one…REALLY…..I  was awake till 4 in the morning last night so invariably….I wanted to sleep a  while….          Dad woke me at 9:30 had to go  eat…mom yelled at me because she wanted me to go with her to City Center….but  for obvious reasons I declined…I was just too tired  and I did not want to be  seen in public with my brother either seeing as he does karate in the blink of  an eye for no reason…          My family is about to go see I,Robot  which I already saw when it came out in the states (it wasn’t TOO good btw)          So I am going to get some peace and  quiet time yay!          I hope I get some peeps to msg me  soon I need someone from IE to talk with! I keep running into 30+ year old men in chat rooms who want me to meet up with them in dublin and have sex for $$$        its getting creepy........              I hope you all have a good weekend      J              Peace

      Well for the first time  I had a good day since Ive been here. I got doom 3 Downloaded(after purchasing a legit copy I just wanted a DVD edition)  and as soon as my computer and it's misc parts come along.  Looks like cool game (demonic too) hopefully I will piss off some reverend's if I go to a Catholic School :).  I looked around at some houses today one of em was still being done...All I want is a room for 7.1 Surround sound speakers :). One of em smelled potent of smokers....and was in a wonderful location but my room would be like 7x7....  Im trying to get some irish friends but I am never anywhere to make a friend :(.  I ate some wonderful indian food for dinner and now i am full :) im going to go run on a treadmill now :)  Well I gtg now peace

      Here I am writing another blog on the same day...nothing much has changed.....my dad wants to take my sweet knife that I got off ebay.   urlLink Here is a picture of the knife   It flips out like a switch blade sort of so that's why my parents are a little paranoid.  I need to get some AIM buddies.....all my ones from home dont get onlin till late @ night. Which is a pain in the ass sometimes. Wish I could get a butterfly knife they look much better....:)  Anyway...Im gonna go to dublin town center tomorrow and maybe get a cell phone and digi cam so that might be good.  I hope my bro doesnt go....hes too annoying....all he does is make up excuses and whine over who gets the front seat(despite me having longer legs). He fights and bickers with me over crap things....it pisses me off so much! Argh.!  I downloaded Farenheight 9/11 the other day which michael moore gave explicit permision to do so, it was so great....I learned so much more about bush. 42% of the time during 2001 he was on vacation. When he learned of the Terrorist Attacks he stood there with a book for over 10 mins not doing anything....it was so funny......  Personally I am glad the 9/11 Attacks happened...it made people realize that there are other cultures out there and that we have enemies and that we are not totally safe....  but....it did cause the US economy to crash and gave bush an excuse to attack iraw which BTW will get him all the votes from Racists....    and...fuck......just now I have some of my best friends @ home pissed @ me cuz I was trying to help....I cant give details for OBVIOUS reasons....just what I need...my only links with home pissed at me...  look at this chat line..   well listen u fucker if u try and fix anything else i wont ever talk to u again       sure blame me fuckin wonderful....  Now im getting blamed for rumours spreading etc...  ergh  im 5000 miles away and getting fucked over in the ass........  Oh well  Till later times  -Wes/Prometheus

      Hey all this is my first blog post  EVER!  i am finding this very destressing and that is good with all the shit going on concurrent with this post. Any who a bit about myself..... I am 15/m/ireland as of august 2004.  I am currently trying to: 1.Not kill my brother 2.Find a house 3.Find a school 4. Entertain myself  all in the next 4 weeks....damn...thats hard....  I traveled here form Seattle Washington on my own so that was cool at least. I felt slightly independant. The only bad parts were in Heathrow airport when I was:  1.Stuck behind an old woman in line for half an hour 2.Running through the airport with ALL my stuff trying not to miss my flight. 3.Sitting on an airplane for 3 hrs without taking off due to thrunder storms 4.Having no food....  It was hell.....  But I finally got here and now I am living in a hotel trying to do everything I listed above. I am looking @ houses, schools, cell phones, misc electronic adapters...meh!  I was so sad to leave but in many ways I was glad to leave.   I was sad to leave because I had a job which was my social life. I worked at the Pro sports club in the day care center. Which I was going to switch out of anyway to a Computer Job since that is what I am most proficent in.  But I was happy to leave since I want my old school to blow up and burn to the ground. My old school is nothing but preppy spoiled brats. They all think they are black, when they are acutally White Upper Class acting, "Gangsta" pisses me off. Whenever they said G,g,g,g,gG UNIT! I wanted to just yell G,G,G,G,g,g,g GET OUT!  Damn...glad I am gone!  Any who...my friendship is up for anyone willing to accept it....if anyone wants to AIM or Email me look in my prof.....  Peace  -Prometheus
