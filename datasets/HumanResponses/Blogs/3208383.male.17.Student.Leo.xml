      Didnt post blogs for the past few days.. not in the mood to.. Said the wrong things at the wrong time.. Choices really have consequences.. People always say"if only i hadn't this hadn't that" there is no point doing so now.. Damn it.. JUST DO GO AND CHANGE WHATEVER YOU CAN CHANGE NOW!!! GO REVERT THE SITUATION LAH!!! Thats what I thought lah.. But now i realise that doing so i damn difficult. He doesnt even wanna tok to m.. what can i do.. I was blaming Farzana at first lah.. but after some thought i realised it's all my fault damn it.. Know that she is feeling bad la.. but dunno whether can tell her that.. :( hope that he can forgive me. dont think there's a chance for that. gonna go talk to him asap.. but can i stand the feeling of getting hurt if he reacts in he manner i expect him to.. :( haiz.. Life.. Gootta do so.. though both of us were like so close for only 7 mths, i felt like i'e known him for the whole of my life.. really treasure this friendship.. but he says it;s over.. how to revert the situation? Hmmm.. I really dun know.. First time i cried because of friendship that day.. Damn remorseful.. if only i hadnt came out with a lame excuse.. if only i had told him the truth.. if only... too many if only to say.. too many.. yet wat will happen in the future.. he isnt gonna bother abt me.. I'm like closer to him than to anybody lor.. even my parents.. I am NOT BLAMING ANYONE FOR THIS.. just me.. can anyone tell me what can i do.. have seen him angry before.. took him like dunno how many months did he take to forgive the people who incured his wrath.. will it happen to me? or will it take longer???? Hope he noes that i really treasure this friendship.. Gonna find a way to apologise soon.. oh one more thing.. know she is going to read the messages..  MJC concert on monday: was not very good.. Made a terrible mistake(again) when can i stop making mistakes???????????? Am I a loser?? I noe the answer already  Got my maths result back.. expected..i failed.. Badly.. Darn.. 2/30 definitely sucks.. gotta do better in the exams.. Nth much more to write.. or is it that i don't want to.. anyway.. dunno how long this i gonna drag on.. Just want him to know i really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really regret and am sorry for what i have done.. starting to cry again.. gotta go.. :(

      Today woke up at around eleven and went to school for PW Lah.. den i reached there around 1250, and i was late.. After listening to some comments from mr audi, he said he had to leave.. DAMN! Wasted my time and money to go to school.. Well at least i know what i had to do for PW and didn't waste it so much haha.. After that went to play pool with polar bear boon siong isbandi and adrian.. Surprisingly jasmine turned up as well.. So play lor.. haha won a few rounds then lost.. Felt shoik.. Didnt want to go actually as i had no money.. Got the msg he wanted to convoy.. No money dun play pool loh.. However polar bear say he will pay and say if he and isbandi play very sian.. Pathetic.. I didnt know that Adrian and Boon Siong An d Jasmine will come so i mian jiang go play with them lah.. Furthermore he called me in the morning at 8 where i am sleeping.. So to end the call i said ok.. Well after pool, when it came to paying up, i didnt pay lah.. The guys go bastard Boon Siong.. Kanina.. All say they no money.. Only Polar Bear paid... ISBANDI CLAIMED HE HAD ONLY 3 BUCKS! Fucking liar.. People like will have no money?? My god.. Den nvm Boon Siong had to come out with his very last cent to pay his debts to Classic Pool.. So I told him to meet me tomorrow when we go discuss about 404'03 BBQ On next tuesday(YAY!!) he said he not going.. Offered to pay him back on tuesday.. He never answer.. So i just gonna bring bring the money to pay the both of them lor.. But i just want to say this.. ISBANDI FOR GOD SAKE HAVEN'T YOU HAD ENOUGH OF BULLYING BOON SIONG IN YOUR SECONDARY SCHOOL DAYS????? FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLS LAH.. YOU ALL ARE POLY STUDENTS ALREADY?? YOU THINK YOU STILL SECONDARY SCHOOL KIDS!!?? FUCKING STUPID RIGHT?? AND TO THINK YOU SAY THAT YOU HAVE NO MONEY.. THEN HOW YOU PAY FOR THE CAB FARE?? THE GAMES?? HUH?? TELL ME LAH.. STUPID FUCKER... AND TO THINK POLAR AND BOON SIONG HAS TO COUGH UP THE MONEY TO PAY FOR THE REMAINING COST.. AND FOR YOUR INFOMATION THEY ARE NOT HALF AS WELL OF AS YOU LOR... GET THIS INTO YOUR NUMBSKULL AND IN YOUR BRAIN(IF YOU HAD ONE) PAY YOUR SHARE! As for polar bear.. I salute you for your generosity.. i am gotta pay for your bbq   Ok having blabbled enough abt the little(or huge) ass.. I am currently waiting for my PW mates to come online.. Waited like hell for them.. Still not online.. Wah lan.. They tink phone bill cheap ah??? Hahaha.. Shall call them now..  Oh ya... Read his blog.. Dunno what to say.. Stunnable.. Shows how cheapskate felix is eh? Ya well i just have to live with the very meagre hope him forgiving me now lah..  Apparently he is dissapoint in another one person.. Haiz.. People keep letting him down.. I really don't want someone else to be like me.. 1st it's she. den he, then me then he.. haiyo.. you all noe wat he expects then you all still go and do it.. Yet is it his part that is wrong?? hmmm.. Is his expectation too high??  Or is it he doesn't know the meaning of To Err is human..... I really dunno.. but thru my days with him i think this is true.. Even he has made mistake? Then why can't others?? In my point of view he has to learn to overcome this dark side of him.. I know i am in no position to critisize him.. But this what i truely feel...   Darn they are still not here yet.. Dunno if they are coming not.. I beginning to feel like benedict on that day of my birthday celebration with my buddies at cafe cartel.. Well going to continue to wait for them nonetheless.. Going off now..

      Just got back from JYSS Symphonic band concert.. Was ok lah.. Shouted like crazy for Miss Wu Ruoting haha.. Went to a prata shop there after that.. Thats where all the rubbish started  Before I say anything.. I just tell you guys something.. When you pierce a nail through a piece of wood, and remove it, there will be a hole which you will never be able to remove.. Thus it is that same as impression.. good or bad.. Particularly bad ones though.. It will be left on you and you'll not forget... Secondly, chinese say that the bad things will spread of a thousand miles.. Thus whatever wrong you do will be remembered for life..  Lemme go into my main topic.. As most of you from pyss-spf band will know.. I have done a great wrong to Mr Poh.. detailed one too long lahz.. Anyway..At the prata place in clarke quay.. I had no money so i didnt not order any food.. All was fine.. everyone started to tuck into their food.. They had not have dinner.. All were eating like pigs.. :D..Well.. Then the huy suddenly came with a roti john.. no one ordered that.. And now i've let one of the seven deadly sins "greed" got the better of me.. Forbbiden fruit taste best.. Thus i ate the roti john.. anyway daniel told me we could cheat thru them and get away with it.. Pls take note i am NOT blaming for my misdeeds.. Therefore i ate it.. Though i taste best..   Then came the bill.. When the time came for the accounting of the 2 roti john(jun xiang ordered one as well) I claimed that we did not order the roti john.. Den as you know they keep claiming that we did(in actual fact we didn't, but i ate it anyway) Then Kenrick step in.. We eventually told him there was but we did not order but we ate it.. So he left and apparently he went to pay for us the cost of the roti john.. Thus this is all my fault lah.. This will add to the list of my greatest mistake in my entire life..  1) Took cigarettes and burn it for fun when i was in pri 4 with Lionel(My pri sch best buddy) Note:I DID NOT ATTEMPT TO TAKE A PUFF OF THE CIGARETTE) Got caught and punished badly by the principal 2) Stole Dad's money for the things i wanted(Greed got the better of me again) 3) Fought with my closest cousin.. Now he and i, though on talking terms, are not as chatty as before 4) Lied to Kenrick on 23-5-2004 5) Attempted to cheat at prata shop at clarke quay on 4-6-2004   When can i set things right? What is wrong with me??? I could hav borrowed money from someone there to pay? Why do i have to lie?? Why!!? What IS WRONG? IS IT MY STUDIES? MY MUSICIANSHIP? MY LIFE? MY CIRCLE OF FRIENDS? KENRICK? OR IS IT JUST IN ME TO LIE.. I really don't know.. Maybe I lost the very friend who brought my interest back into band music already.. The very friend who i had spent one of the happier times with.. The closest friend in this short time i knew him.. Gone.. Is this how life should be? And why can't i find the courage to tell him i am sorry for the things that i've done?? WHY!? ARGH.. It's killing me.. Even people find it hard to swallow the fact that he and i are not like before.. Thanks for your concern Siew Li, Lisa and Benedict.. But this i think will have to go on for quite some time.. I hope not though.. When i have mustered enough guts and courage to talk to him or when he finally forgive me, thats when it will stop.. But wil things be the same as before? I have no idea.. The sky is gloomy.. I need a bridge over troubled waters.. yet who is able to provide me that? Benedict? Ruoting? Lisa & Co? I really dont.. Perhaps the bridge is Kenrick himself.. For now i will stay the same as i was today.. Trust is perhaps something that you have to give but yet you can't.. Sad.. The last time someone did the same to him he took 4 mths to foegive them.. For me?  I really don't know... Longer? Shorter? Seems like the former is the more probable one.. For now i just have to live with the feeling of guilt, the feeling of being a liar, the feeling of sadness, the feeling of being left out, the feeling of suddenly thinking of means of saying sorry to him, the feeling of being lost, the feeling of lonliness, the feeling of letting people down..   What will he think of me now? A liar? A loser? A sinner? A jian huo? A person who cannot be trust? I think is all of them being added up, forming a phrase called Felix Yap Kaiming.. Thats me..  In his dictionary, Yap Kaiming Felix probably means: A person who lies with his eyes open, loser, and a person who cannot be trusted(Noun)..   Anyway, i thanks siew li, lisa, and benedict for their concern again.. ya.. to farzana.. i dunno if you're feeling sown these days because of this matter.. I wanna tell you i DUN BLAME you for what has happened ok? so cheer up lah.. It really makes me feel bad you noe.. So if she doesn't sees this.. Convey this message to her ah.. Thanks people.. =p  Well having said enough.. i tink he probably will not read my blog anyway.. I see you soon.. one last thing.. Members of PYSS-SPF Band.. put in all your effort for this very last month.. I am sure you will not want people tosaid that we are a tyco-gold banmd rite?? SO WORK HARD AND PROVE THEM WRONG.. SO TK BOWEN DEYI BUKIT PANJANG AND THE WHOLE OF SINGAPORE TAHT WE'RE THE BEST!!!! Chao pple..
