        First Private Manned Space Flight  Today is supposed to be the launch of the first privately owned spacecraft.  The craft, SpaceshipOne, is supposed to launch at 6:30 am in the Mojave desert.  A plane will carry the craft into the Earth's atmosphere and then release it.  If the flight is successful, this could be the beginning of a new era of private space flights.  UPDATE:  The Mission was a success!   Spyware Illegal?  A U.S. House subcommittee recently approved what could be the very first federal law to make internet spyware illegal.  The SPY Act (Securely Protect Yourself Against Cyber Trespass) would force companies to warn users that spyware is about to be installed on their computers.  Would companies who provide spyware follow the law?   Hotmail Stepping it Up  Companies who provide free and premium e-mail services are currently responding to the new Gmail service from Google.  Gmail provides users with 1GB (1000MB) worth of e-mail space for free.  Yahoo! recently upgraded their free e-mail service from 4MB to 100MB, ten times less than Gmail.  Yahoo's premium e-mail service provides 2GB worth of e-mail space, double that of Gmail.  MSN's Hotmail has not released any information about how much space they will be providing.  It is rumored that they will upgrade their free 2MB service to 25MB, one-fourth of Yahoo's free e-mail service.  It is unknown how much space that will be provided with Hotmail's premium services.   Weblogs.com Free Service Stopped  Dave Winer, head of Userland's Weblogs.com website, provided 3,000 users with free weblogs.  Dave pulled the plug on the free service last Sunday without warning.  He states that he has health problems and can no longer provide the free service.  Many users were angry because they received no warning.  Users will have access to their archives in the next few weeks.  Mr. Winer hopes to connect users of Weblogs.com with other services that provide free weblogs.

       It seems that the new Beastie Boys album will install copy protection software on your computer silently (without you knowing it).  It is unclear what the software does right now.  It looks like I won't be purchasing the album or any albums from Capitol Records.  Check out the article  urlLink here on Security Focus .

       With the recent purchase of TechTV, Comcast merged the channel with G4 and called it G4TechTV.  This new channel obviously had a new website created.  The problem was that TechTV had thousands of articles on products, tips, tricks, mods, and more for technology.  All of that was lost...until now.  Head on over to  urlLink g4techtv.com  and click on the TechTV Vault.  That is where you will have access to all of the past articles that were on TechTV.

       The  urlLink Gmail  hysteria continues on every day.  Still looking for a free  urlLink Gmail  invite?  urlLink Kevin Rose  is giving them away every now and then.  You could also check out  urlLink eBay  if you are willing to pay for one.  The  urlLink Gmail Machine  seems to be off and on at the moment.  On the other hand, you could just wait until  urlLink Gmail  launches to the public, although I am not sure when that will happen.

       What if you could have internet access without the wires.  No, I'm not talking about a wireless home network, I'm talking about an actual wireless internet connection.  A new internet service provider,  urlLink Clearwire , is launching a wireless internet access plan this summer.  It is only going to be in two locations: Saint Cloud, Minnesota and Jacksonville, Florida.  Hopefully if the provider is successful, the coverage area can be expanded rather quickly.  What makes this service exciting is the connection speed is the same, if not faster, than broadband access at a relatively cheap price.

       I just saw the movie The Village this evening.  Let me say that it was better than I thought it would be.  The only downfall was that it wasn't scary.  But the movie was extremely creative.  It is one of those movies where at the end you go "ohhhh, now I get it."  Something is do obvious during the entire movie but you can't figure it out until the end.  The movie is a must see.  Go see it!

       Many of you have probably played the free games available on  urlLink Pogo.com .  They also have a premium service with great premium games and weekly challenges.  I didn't think Pogo would be worth the $30 a year, but I'm telling you it definitely is.  There is a free trial available for those who want to give it a try.    The premium games are ad free.  They are also of great quality.  Pogo is always adding new games both to the free and premium services.    Take a look at  urlLink Pogo.com

       There is this really cool photo management software called Picasa.  Unfortunately it cost a little bit of money.  Fortunately Google has acquired Picasa and now it is available for free.  I use this program now to edit, share, print, and manage all of my photos.    The program is easy to use and is a must for people with a lot of digital photos on their hard drive.  The only dillema for me now is to find a good digital camera...     urlLink Download Picasa

       Today is the first day when the political campaigns for the presidency gets heated. The Democratic National Convention starts this evening. On every news channel, all they are talking about is politics. Don't get me wrong, politics can be a very good thing because it what makes America great.    Jay Leno hit it on the nail when he was talking about how the election will not be delayed if there was a terrorist attack. Leno stated that they should just have the election today and get it over with. I agree, this year's political atmosphere is sickening. All that I see from all parties whether they be Democrat, Republican, or Independent, is mudslinging. The candidates are focused on downing the other guy that I can't figure out what their goals are.    I want to know what a candidate can do for our country not what the other guy can't do. Put your seat belts on because from now until November, it is going to be one wild ride. All anyone will hear is politics. Don't let it get in your way and more importantly don't let it ruin relationships.

       American Lance Armstrong has won his sixth Tour de France today, doing what no man has ever done before.  Armstrong was given just a fifty percent chance to overcome testicular cancer that had spread to his lungs and brain only eight years ago.  Now he goes down into history books as the only man in the Tour de France's 101 year history to win six times.  Four athletes have tied for the previous record of five titles in the Tour de France.    Read news articles about Lance's win:   urlLink FoxNews.com    urlLink USA Today

        I am finally back and better than ever! With a new version of Blogger out, and no more work in sight, I should be able to now blog with ease.        Dusty's Word is a daily newsletter, that is, a daily guide to the internet. With the advent of blogging on the internet, it has become easier to share information whether it be news, opinions, links, and more through a blogging system. Hopefully this newsletter will both inspire and keep you informed.        Users are encouraged to share comments about different posts. If you have other suggestions either about the blog or something we suggest, feel free to post it.        There is no longer a set schedule of postings (EX. Monday tech news, Wednesday downloads, etc.). So please come back every day 'cause you'll never know what you may find. And another thing, this site is safe for kids, but if you see anything that is inappropriate, let  urlLink Dusty  know.

       I have returned from vacation.  Sorry I have not posted in a long time.  I had a lot of work to do when I got back.  The past few days here in Minnesota has been strange, even for Minnesotans.  The weather here is always odd.  One day it is 90 degrees, the next it is 70.  Yesterday, the temperature hit a high of 59 in our area.  It didn't even make it past sixty.  Last time I checked, this was August, not October.  Anyway, school is catching up to me.  I go back on September 8, only to report to work, study, and less sleep.  Hopefully I can get out of my "sleeping in" routine.  It is very hard.  Maybe if I stay up all night, I will be very tired the next evening, go to bed early then get up early.  Too much work.  After reviewing what each candidate has to offer for the presidency of our great nation, I have determined that Bush is the best candidate.  I am not going to get into why he is or why Kerry isn't.  It is my personal opinion, and what is great about our country is that we can have our own views and opinions.  I have seen politics tear families apart.  When you start to get into a political debate, run or change the subject.  Anyway, back to the candidates.  Both of them have pros and cons.  In fact I think that Bush was wrong to go into Iraq so early.  It needed to be done.  Saddam needed to be thrown out.  But I personally believe that there are bigger threats.  Now Kerry would be a good president with his health coverage plans.  The only thing is will he ever be able to do them.  Thats enough with politics.  About my vacation, I had family fly in from Ohio.  It was very unusual for them to experience 50s and 60s in August.  The weather kind of scared them, but they still loved the area.  We had a good time.  Now back to the regularly posting schedule...

       An interesting thing is happening in Davenport, Iowa.  Usually these things rarely occur in any city, let alone Davenport.  Senator John Kerry and President Bush are both campaigning at the same time in this Iowa city.  Today the city is divided three ways: pro-Kerry, pro-Bush, and the Undecideds.  urlLink  Read article at Foxnews.com

        This posting is a community experiment started by  urlLink Minding the Planet  to see how a meme represented by a blog posting spreads across blogspace, physical space and time. It will help to show how ideas travel across blogs in space and time and how blogs are connected. It may also help to show which blogs are most influential in the propagation of memes. The original posting for this experiment is located at: Minding the Planet; results and commentary will appear there in the future.     Please join the test by adding your blog (see instructions, below) and inviting your friends to participate — the more the better. The data from this test will be public and open; others may use it to visualize and study the connectedness of blogspace and the propagation of memes across blogs.     The  GUID  for this experiment is: as098398298250swg9e98929872525389t9987898tq98wteqtgaq6 2010920352598gawstw98qwrt189849813907azq4 (this  GUID  enables anyone to easily search Google for all results of this experiment). Anyone is free to analyze the data of this experiment. Please publicize your analysis of the data, and/or any comments by adding comments onto the original post at Minding the Planet; Note: it would be interesting to see a geographic map or a temporal animation, as well as a social network map of the propagation of this meme.

       Apple's CEO Steve Jobs underwent surgery this weekend to remove a cancerous tumor from his pancreas.  Jobs sent a companywide e-mail from his hospital bed on a 17-inch Powerbook stating that he had a rare form of cancer that is much more curable than pancreatic cancer.  Jobs goes on to say that he will take August off to recover but will return in September.  He has appointed executive vice president Tim Cook to be in charge while Jobs is out for the month.   urlLink View CNET News Article

       There is a hole in Mozilla and Firefox that allows malicious web sites to spoof or take over the user interface of the browser. This is a serious flaw that will hopefully be fixed soon. What is nice about Mozilla browsers compared to Internet Explorer is that a fix will be released soon. Microsoft usually knows about a flaw for awhile before releasing a fix. Mozilla has a large community of developers that tries to fix any bugs or flaws right away.   urlLink View Official Bug Report   urlLink View Secunia.com Report

It is expected to bring more competition to the already fast growing digital music business. Apple and Microsoft are only a few services that offer pay per download music. Most other services provide subscription services with a limited amount of downloads.   urlLink View Silicon.com Article
