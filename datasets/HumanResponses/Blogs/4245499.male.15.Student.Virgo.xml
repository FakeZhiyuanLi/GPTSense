      Good day for family. Spent the day at Doug's to celebrate my cousin Diep's birthday. What is she now.. 24? We're all grown up! Had a big water balloon fight just like when I was a kid.. But now its fair because I'm bigger than everyone. Good food........ Good people.... Played poker.. took everyone's money. Just chillin and shit... I like that.  Yesterday was cool too.. spent the day with Dianne. Paul and Thuy came over to play games... we didn't play anything and watched movies. Collateral was good.. funny though cuz it extracted weird.. think the file's corruted... but i had to do it like 3 times.. and we missed out on like the last 2 minutes.. but that's ok.. Then the other cousin came over... and something happened that will change my life forever...  Ever here of Veet????? That stupid shit for shaving ur legs!!! Omg. They used me as the guinea pig... and it turned out it didn't work very well.. And my leg was all fucked up and weird.. so i had to shave it all off.... But, iono.. my legs are kinda nice and smooth now. Feel kinda sassy and shit.. HAHA!!! Don't make fun!  That's All for right now... I am the Walrus; g00 g00 g'j00b.

       Look, I have a better banner. Thanks to Hubert for creating this accurate representation of me, Jimmy Huynh. Look at how hot I am..     Anyhow, I took a nap at eight... and just woke up. I read somewhere that sleeping before your usual time of sleep makes sleep worth more. Like if you sleep during the after noon for 3 hours. 20 minutes of sleep during that time is worth 1 hour of sleep during you usual routine. If this is true, we could all save a lot of time. And stay up all night.. doing things... anyways.. my banner rocks. I bet someone we know would be attracted to that sort of thing... *laugh.  I am so hungry I could eat at Arby's... *laughs. So, I microwaved five corndogs.  And that's my time... I am the Walrus; g00 g00 g'j00b.

      We all had a good day today. Went to the block to catch a movie. We had to decide between AVP or Without A Paddle... AVP... Without A Paddle... I didn't really care. Both of those movies didn't seem that good. We all ended up watching AVP; it was better than I thought, but it was still bad--- especially because of the ending. I present an alternate ending. One that I know everyone would enjoy:  Anyways instead of that one predator dying from the alien queen and getting impregnated by her alien seed, he, with the help of the black human chick, defeats the queen in an awesome display of agility and strength. The predators accept the chick as one of there own, and she then travels to there native planet where she is preserved within the alien atmosphere---which is good for your skin---for the next hundred years. She comes back to earth one hundred years later to experience her own hunt. The planet Earth is now more technologically advanced and the human reace was fully aware of the Predator's arrival and intentions for there planet. However our technology could not come close to that of our Predator counter-parts, so it was apprarant that they would die. The incoming Predator fleet was aware of the welcome party they were going to receive when they arrived on earth, and prepared to meet they attack with their own offensive strike. The black former human chick, now evolved and carrying subtle predator features (like hair, denser skin, and bigger hands), hears of the predators plans for attacking her former human companions tries to stop the violence and explains taht she will go down and try and convince the humans not to interfere with the predator's goals. When she meets the humans, she finds that human nature has been corrupted and the government is a worldwide dictatorship under a woman named Lan. The human-predator artificial half-breed meets with Lan to discuss the matter, and she is disgusted to find that she is met with prejudice and is considered a filthy traitor. Now, she holds no sympathies for the human race and her once partial loyalty for the Predator race is solidified on the basis of humans now being corrupted and evil, and her spending more of her life as a predator. Well it turns out, humans are now non existent, because 74 years ago, there was a premature awakening of the Aliens, and they were able to get a hold of a couple of humans, slowly taking over the entire planet. If you watched the old Alien movies, you would know that Aliens could take the form of humans.. INCREDIBLY HOT HUMANS. Lan.. was really hot... really hot! She had a pale complexion blended in with dark features.. like her black eyes, hair, and lips. The predators did not know this and came ill-prepared to defeat what they thought were humans... The first wave of predators sent in mysteriously were defeated. Then they sent in more and more.. and they were defeated. Finally, they sent in the half-breed/former human and her loyal crew, including a punk-ninja predator guy who was like her right hand man. Her husband, that one guy she met on earth a hundred years ago, was now the Predator President: President Mualuapoteaisimbabweikunamatata (NOTICE THE AZTEC SOUNDING SHIT.) They eventually find that they were facing Aliens, and figured out what had been happening these last hundred years. Alien VS. Predator 2: The End War. Long-story-short, the predators win over powering the Alien's with they're big photon cannons and shit. Sorry, I'm getting tired of writing all this shit...  Anyways.. that's the ending... IT'S BETTER HUH.. THE ENDING WOULD BE LONGER THAN THE REST OF THE MOVIE... but it's ok..  Anyways, after the movies we went messing around at the arcade, and played this super cool game where all six of played. We felt like power rangers, we all were in one ship with our own guns to operate. I was Player Red. I started strong, taking the the number one rank.. slowly i fell in rank from 3 to 5... but then towards the end.. I fought my way back up to 2nd rank, while steven took 1st rank. That.. was good..  Then we ate at the Markey Broiler... it was really expensive, but the food was good, and we all had a good time. Hoang got his cool gifts, including a Scar Face Lamp me, Lan, and Thuy got him... THAT IS THE COOLEST LAMP.... it's ok that he didn't watch the movie yet... he will, eventually. This was a good day!  And that's my time... I am the Walrus; g00 g00 g'j00b.

      Ok this is not funny. Very embarrassing. And intimate! But I chose to blog this for your entertainment. Ok the situation might seem suspicious: its 130 in the morning. I'm alone on the internet with my computer and the chair is blocking the door to my room. STOP RIGHT THERE, YOU DIRTY BITCHES! No I was not doing that looking at.. stuff! I was bored.. everyone went to sleep.. I was about to read The Sun Also Rises. I decided to check on my dream girl on ratethisasian.com and see if she was keeping her position on the top 25 list! On this page there were pictures of pretty girls.. and girls that are HALF-naked. Ok the chair was there, because me and tommy were gonna play games on the floor, and moved the chair out of the way. And it ended up there. So anyways, I am a guy.. and chose to look at one of these half-naked girls... ALL OF A SUDDEN MY DAD WALKS IN.. and I get startled! And turn around! HE LOOKS AT ME.. AND THEN THE SCREEN.. oh shit! THIS IS NOT PORN.. "Oh wtf! A pop-up! Don't you worry, father. This shit happens all the time! I just have to click this button here to make it dissappear..." "Jimmy, why do you look at dirty things? It is bad stuff, you like bad stuff? You dirty boy?? You dumb dirty boy!" Ok it didn't happen quite like that. It was an array of akward stares... But you got the idea right? Anyways, I figure this happens to a lot of cool guys out there.. and this helps me minimize my embarrasment. In fact, I know believe that I am totally innocent... I AM YOUR TYPICAL TEENAGE KID.... I have not done a crime here.. it is a crime done against me! Who's with me! HUH??? WHO'S WITH THE WALRUS?   And that's my time... I am the Walrus; g00 g00 g'j00b.

      Ok! I like adventures! And today was a cool adventure...  I woke up at 1230 and then Lan called me to go eat.. but I didn't want to. Because I had no money. But anyway.. Lan called me to go on an adventure and I couldn't refuse...  First, we went to get an oil change... Lan was looking for a hot chick, but he was checking out this old chick and I laughed cause I'm used to Lan's taste in girls. We saw a signed that read "Kid's World." And we went into the car building area.. Honda World. And saw that it was just a room with a tv. They were watching Brother Bear... Brother Bear is the shit. Then we checked out cars and stuff... went over to the Lexus lot and guessed how much each car was worth. That was cool... We went back because we realized that was retarded.... Then...  We went to that one guy's house... I don't know how to spell his name... I'll sound it out: Vome. And then we went to costco to freeload off of the free samples. That's always good. Ran into those chicken nuggets like five times... iono how that happened. Lan was acting like a little baby in the stupid shopping cart. "Baby! Baby! Baaaaaby!" Stupid bitch, Lan. I should've parked him in some aisle and left him there. I will come out the victor in the war of the swollen cheeks! Anyways.. the thingy.. with the thing inside.. raviolli. That was good.. we ran into that twice.. iono how. Oh and we met steven's family friend, Wesley. I like him, he's funny. Just one of those guys that are naturally amusing. Not like Lan, who is a stupid bitch! Stop making fun of me... you are poking at my emotions... These wounds are the hardest to heal. Yea I slap you upside the head a lot.. but it's an affectionate slap, like the friend nudge. You bastard.  Then we went to Fry's for some reason i forgot. But it was just me and Lan looking at Michael Jackson videos from the 80's. They're funny... the beat it video. Where he dances alone in the hall and stuff.. when no one's there.... I like Michael Jackson. He's naturally funny too. Everything about him is natural..........  Then we went home... so i could go shopping for hoang. I like Hoang, he's all natural too. Like Breyer's Ice Cream. And we all love ice cream....  And that's my time... I am the Walrus; g00 g00 g'j00b.

      Something else on my mind. Fucking Javier. Remember how you listed all of our friends and gave them cool roles and stuff.. I do!! You bastard... ".. and Jimmy, he keeps Lan company." You jipped me, fool! And Lan sorta, too. But its ok..... anyways... I would like to announce the official release of our new status! We are the  Mercenaries .  Statistics:  It may not look like it, but when it comes to food, these two are an even match. It may not seem like it but Lan can probably eat as much as Jimmy. And Jimmy can eat a lot. These two are a dangerous pair to have around, because I, Javier, know for a fact that their loyalties do not lye with the team but with the food that we have to constantly feed them in order for them to commit to the job. You can bet your bottom dollar that these two can get the job done! I shall explain:  Lan (A.K.A. Dr. Lan) You know why they call this motherfucker Dr. Lan? Because when you are in his range of attack, this motherfucker is like a surgeon with his teeth that can most likely take down a team of ten. He’s not very fast; however, being fast and being quick is two very different things. His fighting style is a beautiful to watch, because his masterful skills with his teeth make him seem like not only a surgeon but also a chef. Let’s just say that you’re gonna look better when you’re dead than alive. You think you see this motherfucker coming at you? Might as well say your prayers you stupid motherfucker.. because your ass is Lan-food; you along with your friends.  Jimmy (A.K.A. The Walrus) What do you think of when you hear the word walrus? Besides the obvious (you stupid motherfucker). The Walrus can be looked on as a gentle beast perhaps; but I warn you do not take this motherfucker lightly, because if you get on his bad side I can tell you that you’d be better off with Dr. Lan. His strength is incomparable (within our  clique ) and his intelligence is on par with even that of  Bill Clinton . A master of the spoken word and of the written language and armed with a massive array of persuasive skills, he would double as a major diplomatic weapon if only we could tame this wild beast! Instead he uses this unique skill as a tool to get girls. AND IT WORKS, TOO. YOU STUPID MOTHERFUCKING PIMP.  CAUTION: ONLY REFER TO THESE TWO AS A LAST RESORT. KEEP SURPLUS SUPPLY OF FOOD IN STORAGE.

      Damn it! My bloggerings got erased again. Fuck this thingy! O well, there wasn't that much written...  Anyhow, I finally decided to sleep at 8 in the morning and woke up at 230. That was nice.. I'm gonna do that again. I watched Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle today, and I think that was the best movie I ever saw! I am now motivated... I am now inspired... to live out my life to the mother fucking fullest (while I'm high [or while I'm full...]). Poor Asian-Americans.. met with so much adversity and roadblocks. And that korean guy... developing multiple epiphanies throughout the movie, each getting shot down by a greater dissapointment. But in the end, they came out winners.... INSPIRATIONAL, I TELL YOU. And now to go on my adventures... and the road to victory and happiness. And that road starts with a fuck load of pot.. and will end with a fuck load of little tiny burgers. Join me and my quest for greatness.....   And that's my time... I am the Walrus; g00 g00 g'j00b.

      My head aches. My shoulders are tight. The lids on my eyes heavy, but I don't let them close--- not even to blink. I said to myself, "I got to make this work, I just have to..." Damn you, Blog! Damn you! The hours went by slow.. or did they go by fast? I can't tell, but I know I saw every number from one to seven in the hour's slot on my digital clock. However, it seemed each and every hour held its own eternity. Each hour had its own goal (THE ETERNAL HOUR'S GOAL I WOULD THINK TO CALL IT!). Hour one consisted of me figuring out what the hell I was dealing with.. I haven't used HTML in so long! MONTHS! YEARS! I had become dependant on FrontPage and DreamWeaver.. what a shame.. And now, in the first eternal hour, I had none of these programs to do the work for me, I was lost. But soon enough, I figured it out... took me a while though, didn't it? Even with those labels.. it took me a while. DAMN YOU WRETCHED BLOG.. AND HTML.. what a dirty language it is.. like one of those African dialects... or Vietnamese. So on I progressed towards the second eternal hour: the hour of brain storming. Braing storming through ideas: color schemes, images, organization.. I did not make very much progress. In fact, I had only decided on T.G.I.F colors during the last couple minutes of the second eternal hour. Until then, green and brown was in my head. It couldv'e worked, methinks. METHINKS... On to the third eternal hour i trodded along. The hour of image creation! THE BANNER TOOK ME FOREVER. I couldn't replicate it if i tried. I can only render work of art through pure luck! I ran into better images.. but my fucking Photoshop closed damnit! But eventually i ran into this image.. and there it is. And the forth hour? Haha. That is for me to know! And for you to find out that you cannot know! And the fifth eternal hour? The fifth????? I don't remember. But i ended up with the background image, which went on the background, including the my self-portrait (of myself) which I slapped on. Then the sixth hour! The sixth hour was the hour of festivities.. among... me... and myself! It's a celebration, bitch! Enjoy yoself! Oh god... and now I've broken into the seventh eternal hour.. the hour of the explaning of the previous eternal hours and their goals... All this! And i Come UP WITH THIS layout!!!! I AM SO.. PATHETIC....... nods.... nods... noooddss............  And that's my time.. I am the Walrus; g00 g00 g'j00b.

      Cool, I started a new blog. Now you can explore the exciting world of Jimmy Huynh... I'm pissed though cause I just spent like 15 minutes writing up my first post and I accidently erased it. FUCK. But it's ok... I'll start over.  A lot of things on my mind lately. I've decided that I don't like highschool. I want to get out of here and leave all this mess behind, ya know? I just don't want to deal with it all. You don't realize how much I want to go to college right now... Leave. Somwhere far away from my parents, somwhere real.. somewhere I am free from any restrictions. I feel only then can I become the person I'm suppost to be, no limitations whatsoever. I don't want to deal with pety highschool drama or go through the same damn routine anymore. It's all just so ridiculously stupid. Even when I get caught up in the drama, I find myself thinking " ok, what the hell is this. i don't want to deal with this, it's so damn stupid. why am i wasting my time and my effort on something so meaningless. stupid bitches... " We're not gonna have time for that stuff in college, I can tell you that. We're gonna spend our time getting drunk stupid, getting high, and partying (when we're not studying, of course). No time for beef, no time for drama! And no time for stupid bitches!  On another note, Happy Sweet 16, Tiffany! I hope you like me and Hubert's gift. Sorry that you couldn't find the poem. I spent a lot of time and effort pouring my heart and soul into that! Each and every word held so much meaning and passion... And Hubert spent alot of time folding that crane-envelope shit the poem was in. But don't feel guilty! Cuz the point is you're 16, and that's cool. And.. of course.. I have the poem saved on my hard-drive, and it is available upon request.   And that's my time.. I am the Walrus; g00 g00 g'j00b.
