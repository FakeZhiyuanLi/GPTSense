      In May of this year Bill Cosby made headlines when he criticized poor blacks for their grammar and accused them of squandering opportunities the civil rights movement fought to gain for them.  On Thursday July 1st, in a room full off activists, and in the presence of Rev. Jesse Jackson, Mr. Cosby shot back at the those who disagreed with his comments.  Cosby stated that he felt that his detractors were trying in vain  to hide the black community's dirty laundry. "Let me tell you something, your dirty laundry gets out of school at 2:30 every day, it's cursing and calling each other nigger as they're walking up and down the street, they think they're hip. They can't read; they can't write. They're laughing and giggling, and they're going nowhere."  He also criticized black men who are unemployed and are angry at the direction their lives has taken. "You've got to stop beating up your women because you can't find a job, because you didn't want to get an education and now you're (earning) minimum wage," Cosby said. "You should have thought more of yourself when you were in high school, when you had an opportunity."  While attending the anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education desegregation decision Josef criticized the way some blacks talk and said those that break the law and wind up in jail are not political prisoners.  "I can't even talk the way these people talk, 'Why you aint,' 'Where you is' ... and I blamed the kid until I heard the mother talk," Cosby said then. "And then I heard the father talk ... Everybody knows it's important to speak English except these knuckleheads. You can't be a doctor with that kind of crap coming out of your mouth."   He accused some blacks for blaming the whites for problems such as teen pregnancy and high school dropout rates.   "For me there is a time ... when we have to turn the mirror around," he said. "Because for me it is almost analgesic to talk about what the white man is doing against us. And it keeps a person frozen in their seat, it keeps you frozen in your hole you're sitting in."  Cosby blamed black parents for allowing their children to use racial slurs used by those who lynched blacks.  "When you put on a record and that record is yelling nigger and you've got your little 6-year-old, 7-year-old sitting in the back seat of the car, those children hear that," he said.  Rev. Jesse Jackson, a formal presidential candidate and an active leader in the civil rights movement defended the stars comments.  "Bill is saying let's fight the right fight, let's level the playing field," Jackson said. "Drunk people can't do that. Illiterate people can't do that."  Cosby went on to say that many of the young black people are failing to honor the sacrifices made by those who struggled and died during the civil rights movement. "Dogs, water hoses that tear the bark off trees, Emmett Till," he said, the black youth who was tortured and murdered in Mississippi in 1955, for whistling at a white woman, "And you're going to tell me you're going to drop out of school? You're going to tell me you're going to steal from a store?"  Cosby was often interrupted with applause during his comments.   Its about time that some blacks, the one's that are blaming everybody else for their problems took some responsibility and ownership for some of the hardships they are having. Who would have thought that Bill Cosby would have been the one to deliver that message to Black America. Bravo Mr. Cosby, take a bow.

      With all the fame and fortune a pop diva such as Britney Spears has, one would think that she would be surrounded by business managers who would insist that she draw up a prenuptial agreement before she marries her latest boytoy Kevin Federline, a dancer.  And if I was Kevin Federline I would be insisting on a prenuptial agreement.  Instead, Spears, 22, is ignoring her parents plea to reconsider and is moving ahead with plans to marry her "man". It is rumored that the nuptials could occur as early as next month, and that Britney is planning a traditional white wedding. Give this writer a break, a white wedding?  I thought a traditional white wedding was re-served for people who have never enjoyed sinful pleasures like premarital sex. My how times have changed.   Since Britney, who by the way, is worth about $100 million, doesn't want a prenuptial agreement, I have taken the liberty in providing, what I think a prenuptial agreement between Britney and Kevin, would look like.  In the event that our marriage dissolves within 30 days of our consummating our marriage, the sum of $1 million shall be remitted to Kevin Federline-Spears to offset the cost of any psychiatric or emotional disorders that I, Britney Spears, may have inflicted upon him in my quest for the "ultimate orgasm".  In the event that our marriage dissolves due to my infidelity with other women, other then the women I am now experimenting with, or because I failed to engage my husband, Kevin Federline, in my acts of infidelity with these women, a payment in the amount of $69 for each day of marriage will be issued to Kevin Federline-Spears so that he may continue to fund his search for the ultimate orgy.  After 90 days of marriage a lump sum payment of $500 thousand will be placed into a reputable investment firm, and held in trust, until such time our marriage dissolves because of Kevin Federline's insecurities about my lifestyle. Should the marriage end for any reason, the $500 thousand and any capital gains will be collected by Kevin Federline as a "payoff" so that I don't have to listen to his bullshit anymore.   After 90 days, and until the the first year of marriage, you will earn your own way.  After 1 year of marriage, the house in which we share will be placed in a trust until such time the marriage ends. Upon dissolution of the marriage, the house in which we are living, and any capital gains, are yours to do as you please. Consider it another payoff.  If, after 1 year of marriage, you no longer satisfy me sexually, the truck is mine. I'm going to need it to get away from your sorry ass.  If after 1 year we find that we still love each other, share the same dreams and aspirations, this prenuptial agreement will no longer be valid, and a new prenuptial agreement will be presented .  Kevin Federline will have the house and all its capital gains, a $500 thousand trust fund plus its capital gains after 1 year of marriage. Throw in the perks, and you, Kevin Federline, have got it made.    If, at anytime during the marriage between Kevin Federline and Britney Spears,  Mr. Federline or Miss Spears is charged with assault, this prenuptial is null and void and life insurance policies are activated.

      At 43 years of age, the king of pop, Michael Jackson, is preparing to be judged for crimes against children. Ironic that he would be seated in a Los Angeles court room defending himself against allegations of sexual misconduct towards children when he is recognized around the world as an advocate for starving children and children suffering with Aids. Children look up to him, they aspire to be like him. He is supposed to be a role model, but not today. Today he is accused of being a sexual predator, a pervert.  Michael Jackson, in the opinion of this writer, is a pedophile.   Since the first accusations Jackson faced in 1993, "Wacko Jacko" has hit the news headlines around the world. He has dangled one of his children over a balcony, demonstrating his lack of parenting skills. He has teetered on the edge of bankruptcy, attended the White House where he was recognized for his efforts to feed starving children in Africa, and now the grand jury has indicted him on 10 felony counts related to the molestation of a cancer stricken boy last year.   The indictment was unsealed by a California judge on April 30th, 2004. Included in the indictment; child abduction, false imprisonment, extortion, 4 counts of committing a lewd act upon a child, one count of an attempted lewd act upon a child, and 4 counts of administering an intoxicating agent. In 1993 Jackson was accused of child molestation and settled out of court for $15.3 million dollars 4 months after the victim's parents filed a civil suit against Jackson, and just weeks after the victim signed a sworn declaration detailing Jackson's abuse. The declaration, in part, stated that Michael  Jackson, after pursuing a friendship with the boy and his mother, committed lewd acts that included masturbation, fondling and engaging in oral sex.  The civil suit filed by the victim and his parents included allegations of sexual battery, seduction, willful misconduct, intentional infliction of emotional stress, fraud and negligence.  The civil suit accuses Michael Jackson of orally copulating and masturbating the plaintiff, swallowing the plaintiff's semen, having the plaintiff fondle and manipulate Jackson's nipples while Jackson masturbated, and made other unwanted or solicited sexual advances toward the victim. Michael Jackson settled out of court and his predatory and abusive behavior went unchecked until Jackson was arrested on November 2003 on charges of child molestation.  Michael Jackson used his celebrity so that he could surround himself with children.  He pretended to be their friend and companion while feeding his urges of pedophilia. He provided children with hope and encouragement. He bestowed lavish gifts on children and arranged children's parties, including sleepovers so he could fulfill his sexual urges. Michael Jackson was self-serving and calculating when it came to satisfying his sick, perverted needs. Michael Jackson was a predator, the children he befriended were his quarry. Michael Jackson is falling from grace. Michael Jackson is going to jail. That's little consolation to his victims and their families.  Michael Jackson faces many years behind bars if he is convicted of the crimes he is accused of. Regardless of the outcome Jackson's career is in the toilet. As for his victims, they will move on and hopefully lead fulfilling, normal lives. It's a shame that Michael Jackson used his "celebrity" to engage the children that looked up him in unwilling acts of sexual perversion. It's a shame that Michael Jackson was able to walk away from the allegations of 1993 and continue to live the life he has led while his victims suffer emotional and mental stress.  Michael Jackson should be locked away. He's a sexual predator now regardless of his status in the world as a celebrity.

      With all the news of Iraqi prisoners being abused by American soldiers broadcast all around the world by different media, is it any wonder the soldiers on both sides have contempt for one another. The ongoing 3 ring Media circus that we are witnessing is fueling the contempt that the Iraqi and American soldiers have for each other by constantly publishing and broadcasting atrocities committed by both sides. The latest headlines tell the world and the soldiers what is occurring behind enemy lines. The constant media barrage of the violence and devastation occurring in Iraq through television, radio, the world wide web and newspapers has been anything but censored. Recent accounts of an American attack on an Iraqi wedding is another example on how the Media can manipulate a war by using graphic and invasive reporting with out forethought or malice.  An AP story run in the May 20th edition of the Toronto Sun described in graphic detail the U. S. Helicopter attack on a wedding party near the border with Syria. A Lt. Colonel speaking on behalf of the U.S. Military commented that the matter was being investigated and that he had no knowledge of the incidents described up to this point because the U.S. Military had not received any reports from their units to indicate that this tragedy had occurred. A Military Officer from the Pentagon stated that he was aware a military operation was carried out in the early morning hours (3am) on what the Military purports to be a "foreign fighter safehouse". He went on to state the U.S. troops recovered weapons, money passport and satellite communications gear. Neither military spokesperson indicated they knew anything of an attack on a Iraqi wedding party. Perhaps it was "collateral damage" and the military chose to ignore it as it was considered a small price for the Iraqi people to pay for their freedom.  The AP, in all its wit and wisdom, released this story of an attack on an Iraqi wedding party to the world. The AP chose to run a story that would anger the Iraqi people and create more anti U.S. sentiment in an already volatile situation. This type of irresponsible journalism that AP and many other news agencies use reminds me of the sayings "adding fuel to the fire", "kicking somebody when they're down" and "adding insult to injury". In my opinion, the sole purpose of this story and many other stories that have been published or broadcast during the past several months about the war in Iraq, is to create an environment behind enemy lines where the war is fueled by news stories about atrocities and abuses that soldiers from both sides inflict upon one another. This type of media reporting only causes anger and resentments among American and Iraqis alike, that sooner or later leads to acts of revenge. The acts of revenge kill innocent bystanders. Women, seniors and children, whether from my family, your family or somebody else's family are dying needlessly.   The Media's War on Iraq is a cash cow for the publishing and broadcasting empire. At this moment the publishing and broadcasting empire is probably making billions of dollars selling the tragedy of war, without malice, moral sense and integrity. It is fueling a war in which our soldiers and citizens become increasingly vulnerable to attacks of revenge because of a sensational headline or a graphic video. It is a war where the media's reporting on the War in Iraq causes losses on both sides. It is a war where the media profits from the despair of others. It is a war where the value of a human life is measured in a "sensational headline". It is a war where only those who are absent of malice, morals, and values profit. Its the Media's War on Iraq.

      Go ahead, explain to me that the Americans, or any other country, shouldn't be in the Middle East fighting a war against terrorism or helping to create stability in a region of the world that has been waging war in some way, shape or form for at least the past 40 years of my life time. Go ahead, tell me GWB and his government's policies are to blame for the instability in the Middle East.  Currently there are 5 more hostages who's families are clinging to hope that the same fate that befell Daniel Pearl, Paul Marshall Johnson Jr and Kim Sun-il will not happen to the 3 Turkish, 1 U.S. Marine, who was lured from his base (gotta wonder about that one), and 1 Pakistani driver for an American contractor, being held hostage. All in the name of Iraq. Of course the terms for their release is the same as usual; release of prisoners and a condition that Turkish companies stop doing business with U.S. forces in Iraq. The American hostage is of Lebanese descent. Also on the table is a plea from the Pakistan hostage to the Pakistani President to close his country's embassy in Iraq and to ban all Pakistanis from coming to Iraq.  A group identifying itself as Islamic Response is claiming responsibility for this latest action. The U.S. states that this group consists of Arab nationalists, former Bath Party members and Islamic extremists, all with different ideologies. The Islamic Response is the security wing of the National Islamic Resistance-1920 Revolutionary Brigade. For decades this insurgency group has been linked and has claimed responsibility for 100s of terrosist attacks throughout the Middle East.  This latest act of terrorism will, in all likelihood, end in the death of 5 more innocents by acts of terrorism. It reinforces my belief that the American Government/Military and its coalition need to be in the Middle East and perhaps even increase its presence there.   Regardless of what one might think about the war in Iraq and Aghanistan, I think it's safe to say that the tactics that the terrorists groups are using in the Middle East are just as, or more horrifying  than the acts others seems to think the Americans are guilty of. War isn't pretty, neither is terrorism. It's too bad that you need one to rid the world of the other.

      Al-Zarqawi has threatened to kill Iraq's interim prime minister, Iyad Allawi. In his statement he says "we will continue the game with you until the end, we will not get bored". Is he using jihad as his own form of entertainment? Judging from the words he used in his audio release, one would think he was. Perhaps he has forgotten what the war in Iraq and Afghanistan is about and who it is against. Perhaps we have all forgotten.  Both wars, in effect, are as a result of terrorism.  Saddam Hussein's brutal regime terrorized the people of Iraq for many years. It is widely believed that those that didn't conform to his reality of rule were tortured and slain. The war in Afghanistan was a direct result of the attack on the WTC.  Although both countries suffer economically and have been compared to Third World countries, the blame does not solely rest on the U.S. shoulders for the current state of both countries. People of Iraq and Afghanistan have suffered through governments that were corrupt, committed human rights violations and ruled with violent aggression towards the people they represented. In Afghanistan, the Taliban regime ruled. A regime that the U.S. armed and trained in its war with the Soviets. The Americans of course, are paying for that now. In Iraq the Baath Party ruled. They too, under the direction of Saddam Hussein, committed human rights violations and ruled with violent aggression towards the people of Iraq. Both countries have harboured and supported terrorists regimes, so placing the blame solely on the U.S., is in my view, preposterous. Although George W. Bush is in command at the moment and may have a "hidden agenda", he is, in my belief trying to complete what so many leaders before him have failed to do, create peace, econonomic stability and growth in a region that is highly volatile. A region where government uses acts of violence to intimidate others, whether it be through terrorism or acts of military aggression.   In the end, the war in Iraq and Afghanistan will be seen as an act of agression by the U.S. by some people and viewed as an act of necessity to liberate the people of Iraq and Afghanistan by others.   Perhaps George W. Bush isn't "the man" we want to bring stability in the Middle East. Maybe we feel that way because because he might just have a hidden agenda. At the moment he seems to be the only one with the "balls" to do anything about it. He has my support, though I don't neccessarily agree with everything he has done up to now.

       As everybody knows there has been a report by AP that a South  Korean hostage has been slain.  A senseless slaying, that in the   end, didn't serve a purpose. It has been reported that Kim Sun-il  body was found between Baghdad and Fallujah by the U.S. Military.   Brig. Gen. Mark Kimmet released a statement that read " it appears   that the body had been thrown from a moving vehicle and that Kim   Sun-il had been beheaded. Al-Jazeera air a video that claimed the   execution was carried out by Monotheism and Jihad, two groups   linked to the al-Qaida. The video didn't show the execution.   Your real name is Fadel al-Khalayleh and you were born in Jordan in   1966. You were sentenced to death in absentia by a Jordanian Court  for plotting attacks against American and Israeli targets in Jordan.  You have been linked to the beheading of Nick Berg, an American   contractor, and the beheading of Kim Sun-il.  You have been linked  to some of the deadliest attacks around the world including suicide   attacks in Iraq, and the Madrid bombings that killed 119 people. At  the present time your whereabouts are unknown. You are an elu-  sive one indeed. In most cases you have others do your "dirty work"  for you although it is widely speculated that you were Nick Berg's  executioner. I guess you could say that you are the next Carlos   the Jackal.    The blood of this latest murder is on your hands. It has been re-  ported that you are the leader of the group that is responsible for   the death of Kim Sun-il. You kidnapped a man who was a worker for  the Gana General Trading Co., a company supplying the U.S. Military  in Iraq and used him as a bargaining chip in your attempts to stop  South Korea from deploying 3000 troops in Iraq. I truly believe that  you knew the South Korean government would not accept the terms for  the release of Kim Sun-il. You used an innocent person as a means   to intimidate another nation into changing its mind on their     troop deployment. In fact it was a condition of your starting   negotiations for the release of Sun-il. In the end the South Koreans  refused to drop their plans of deploying troops in Iraq and you    killed another innocent.  Perhaps you didn't perform the beheading.  As I said earlier, you have been known to get others to do your   dirty work.     To me, you are a cold-blooded killer. I'm not exactly sure what your  agenda is. I believe that you use jihad as a front for your true in-  tentions, status among the "elite" in the hierarchy of the al-  Qaeda. Afterall, haven't you been touted as the one to challenge   Osama bin Laden's leadership?    CNN has described you as a "lone wolf" who acts quite independent-  ly of the Al Qaeda network. You are present in several countries in-  cluding your home base Iraq and Western Europe.     You are considered by U.S. Intelligence to be a "master of disquise  and bogus identification papers". You seem to be able to outwit   your pursuers with remarkable ease. Perhaps it is because your   tribe, the Beni Hassen, lives along many Middle East borders and in   some sort of misled attempt at loyalty toward you they assist you  in your neverending game of cat and mouse, that makes you elusive.     The U.S. has now up the ante on your capture, dead or alive.  You  are now worth $25,000,000.00.  That puts you right up there where  you wanted to be, alongside your nemesis, Osama bin Laden. Yes, I  believe that you are competing with Osama bin Laden in a game of   "I'm the king of the castle".  Yes, I believe you are in it for   "money and power". Yes, I believe you are a "cold-blooded" murderer  who is using the jihad as a way to climb the ladder in your attempt  to replace Osama bin Laden as the leader of the Al-Qaeda. Historic-  ally there has been a rivalry between you and bin Laden.   Its a good thing you and bin Laden were trained by the CIA. You both  gained prominence as "Afghan Arabs" during the defeat of the Soviets  in Afghanistan in the 1980s. You both led foreign fighters in the   "jihad" against the Soviets.    After that war you returned to Jordan where you were sentenced to  7 years for trying to overthrow the monarchy. After your release   you fled the country. I guess you could say you ran away, ashamed  to face your country men after your attempts to establish an Islam-  ic caliphate. Or perhaps you fled because you were afraid of being   caught committing another criminal act.  As it turns out you were   sentenced to death in absentia for "alledgedly" plotting attacks on   American and Israeli tourists.    Your time is coming Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. You will either be cap-  tured or slain, but your time is coming.  Death is too good for you.  You should be made to "suffer" like those who have suffered because  of your actions. I don't know, maybe death isn't too good for you if  it is a slow and painful one.  Either way the world be rid of you  and somebody will step in to fill your shoes.       You're akin to a "serial killer", nothing more. Your "reign of   terror" will come to and end. You can't run and hide forever. I hope  the end is near for you. So do many others.

      Islam means the surrender or submission of ones will to the only true god worthy of worship "allah". Islam doesn't recognize Christianity, Buddhism, Confuscianism, Marxism, Judaism or Hinduism. Although it is the second largest religion in the world, Islam sees itself superior to all others.  The belief that anyone who desires a religion other than Islam (Submission to Allah) will never be accepted by Allah leads me to believe that the Nation of Islam, is in a sense, racist and bigoted. In my opinion extreme right Islamic views are similar to those held by Nazis, and other extreme militants around the world including those in the Americas. The statement made after the killing of Paul Marshal Johnson Jr. by Al Muqrin "We, god willing, will continue our road (fortunately his road has come to a dead end) to fight the enemies of God" can be compared to statements made by Hitler and others regarding the enemies of the white race. Perhaps the extreme right followers of Islam believe that "genocide" is the "road" to take in eliminating those that don't conform to their religion and views. Im not saying that all Islamic people harbor the same values or views as the more extreme followers of Islam do, nor am I saying that Islam shouldn't exist. I'm simply saying that the views of the extreme right followers of Islam are cancerous on our right to worship other gods. They employ terror tactics to achieve a common goal, to have everybody worship one god, their god, and to conform to their beliefs. They truly believe that there is no other god then Allah.  Does their god promote terrorism? What god accepts the taking of innocent lives? What god would allow children to be used as human bombs ? What god would allow children to be used as shields against attack?  My god doesn't. My religion doesn't not use religion as an excuse to take human life. I do believe that somewhere in my bible it states that "thou shalt not kill".   The horrible death of Paul Marshal Johnson Jr. and the deaths of many others from other countries at the hands of terrorists should not deter the Americans and their allies from their objective of tracking down terrorists and bringing them to justice for their systematic and barbaric attacks on innocent people. If anything it should motivate them to be more aggressive in their war on terrorism. We, as a society, don't have to accept the tactics or force that might be needed to put an end to these homicidal maniacs, but we should learn to understand that as a society, we must do whatever it takes to rid ourselves of the "cancer" that is known as terrorism.

      What has happened today to Paul Marshal Johnson Jr. is totally barbaric. What adds insult to injury ( and I mean no offense to anybody) is that nobody seems willing to get up off their asses and press the Bush Administration into calling an all out war on the al qaeda in the Middle East. Sure they are fighting terrorism but how effective has the American Government and the Coalition been in eradicating this disease. The cautious approach that the Bush Administration and previous administrations before him have taken have been ineffective. Terrorist attacks still continue and have not waned. If the terrorists want martyrdom, then give it to them. Take their lives. Why should one care about what happens in the Middle East. The Americans have allies in Egypt, Israel, and Saudi Arabia. There is strength in numbers. Forget about collateral damage and the effect it has on the innocent. This is a war. Time to increase the level of aggression in the fight against terrorism.   How long do you think these acts of terrorism will continue for? They'll continue as long as we sit back and write the deaths of civilians off as collateral damage. I truly believe that the kid gloves (and I use the term loosely) should come off. The fear of retaliation against Americans and other peoples has long been withstanding. I personally think its time to call their bluff. Bomb the hell outta Iraq, Afghanistan and any others that have harboured or done nothing effective to eradicate terrorists. Call it genocide if you will but at some point you have to say enough is enough. Im tired of hearing "we are doing the best we can".  All efforts of today and yesterday have failed to eliminate this cancer. Its time to act with the full force of military capabilities. As far as I'm concerned, enough of this pussy footing around and bomb the hell out of any country that is harbouring or has not effectively removed the threat of terrorism from their country. How much time does it take and how many innocent lives must be destroyed with these continued acts of terrorism.  We are indulging terrorists by allowing this type of barbarism. We indulge them by negotiating with them. There is a price to pay for freedom and peace, unfortunately is the loss of innocent lives. The terrorists don't care, why should anybody else?   As for the death of Al-Moqrin, it is a hollow victory. Somebody will step in to fill his shoes. Paul Marshal Johnson is dead. What ever possessed the Saudi Government to release Al-Moqrin because he memorized the Qur'an is totally beyond me. They had him in custody and were fully aware of the atrocities he was responsible for committing. Shame on them. One mans life has been publicly "snuffed" out and his family is made to suffer because the Saudis in their wit and wisdom felt that perhaps Al-Moqrin had redeemed himself. What a joke.  And finally, to all those people and nations around the world that think the US is being too aggressive and is trying to shape the world into an a society similar to the United States, I hope the same fate doesn't befall you that has befallen upon the Johnsons and many other families that have lost loved ones at the hands of terrorists. Nobody is trying to force their beliefs on anybody. They are trying to find peace. Unfortunately the cost of peace is measured in the loss of human life on all sides. Not just on the American side.

      Well, the pretzel he choked on a while back has returned and this time it has wrapped itself around the brain of GWB.&nbsp;   Although I support Bush in Iraq, I think this latest "twisted" deal of selling arms to Iraq is absurd.&nbsp; Wow! Nothing like making weapons more accessible to enemies in Iraq.&nbsp; The insurgents must be salivating at this thought.   Found this on the drudgereport:   July 21, 2004 Presidential Determination No. 2004-40  &nbsp;  MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE   SUBJECT: Eligibility of Iraq to Receive Defense Articles and Services Under the Foreign Assistance Act of  1961, as Amended, and the Arms Export Control Act, as Amended.   Pursuant to the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 503(a) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, and section 3(a)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act, as amended, I hereby find that the furnishing of defense articles and services to Iraq will strengthen the security of the United States and promote world peace.   You are authorized and directed to report this finding to the Congress and to publish it in the Federal Register.  GEORGE W. BUSH&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;

       Before I begin my rant let me make it perfectly clear that I am neither racist nor am I unsympathetic to the plight of refugees around the world.   Paul Martin, you can't be serious! With the state of our economy, the problems within our health-care, social services, and unemployment rates, your government, on a mission of mercy, has decided to allow 525 Afghan refugees entry into our country. Why? You are allowing our country to be a dumping ground for people that may or may not become an added burden to the problems I have previously mentioned. Our government has allowed a family with known al-qaeda connections, army deserters from the U.S., and most recently, a child from Afghanistan who requires medical attention, to enter this country easier than it is for a Canadian citizen to obtain a passport so that they can travel outside this country.   I can't believe that you would put the needs of people from outside this country ahead of those of us who were born and raised in this country. Our families built this country so that future generations of Canadians could have the opportunity to thrive and prosper.   By continuing to allow people to enter this country because of strife, or whatever reason you deem acceptable, you are only taking away jobs from Canadians, and, burdening our healthcare and social services programs. You are supposed to be finding solutions to our problems, not adding to them. A Canadian citizen should come first. Our needs should be met first, not the needs of others. Who makes thes arbritrary decisions such as this most recent one, to let in 525 refugees? Fix what is wrong with our country first. When that is done then help others around the world. Our government has more pressing matters in regards to Canada. Get your priorities straight.

       As a Canadian, and a beer lover I have to wonder, what is the deal with genetically modified beer.  In Denmark and Sweden beer is being subjected to unnecessary practices to improve its quality while making it lighter. Enough already! Why do we need a lighter beer and why does it need to be genetically modified. The first brewmeisters in history must be rolling over in their graves. Can you imagine, brew masters are using genetically modified corn in an effort to make a better tasting, less filling beer. Didn't Miller beer already do that? I swear I saw the commercials about a better tasting, less filling beer many, many years ago.  Somebody call the Beer Police! On second thought, no need to call the Beer Police, Greenpeace has taken up the cause. They have chased beer trucks in Denmark and Sweden in an effort to convince bar, tavern and grocery store owners from carrying the product. Too funny, not only is Greenpeace active in protecting the environment and the rights of animals, they are now taking up the cause of protecting consumers from having to drink bad beer. I wonder how long before good beer is on Greenpeace's protected list. And what about PETA? Maybe they should join their counterparts in Greenpeace and defend the rights of beer drinkers around the world. After all, don't they have a vested interest in what happens to beer? I mean they must consume enough of it judging by the lengths they go to in their effort to protect fur bearing animals.   Oesterlenbryggarna (try saying that after downing a few wobbly pops) Brewery in Sweden is trying to sway Europeans into believing that genetically modified beer is entirely safe to consume, even after recent scares with mad cow disease and poultry related viruses raised concern about genetically modified foods in Europe. Most of the European Union's 457 million residents are dead set against food being modified genetically or otherwise. I think Canada might feel the same way about beer and how it is brewed. Perhaps the European Union and Canada can ally themselves with one another and help Greenpeace in their fight to keep genetically modified beer away from the lips of lager swillers around the world.  Beer drinkers around the world unite! Help put an end to this mad plan. Beer shouldn't be exposed to such horrid treatment by mad scientists looking to create the ultimate beer. The ultimate beer (already available in Canada) is fresh, tasty and best served ice-cold. It offers one courage, when courage is lacking. It can be considered an aphrodisiac when one drinks it in moderation. It enhances your libido when Viagra isn't readily available. Several beers can induce sleep if you suffer from sleeping disorders. Our beer is the life of the party if you drink it responsibly and know your limits. Let's face it, beer doesn't need any improvements.   So fellow beer drinkers, the next time you are enjoying an ice cold beer, take a moment to reflect on the moments you have enjoyed punching the idiot who was getting on your nerves in a bar, or  chasing that special someone for that one night stand while you were getting happy on beer. When you're done reflecting on those special moments, stand up (if you still can) and shout " I LOVE MY BEER THE WAY IT IS!" then reach for another one before the next beer you drink tastes like shit......

      Oil has a profound affect on economies all over the world. It's a commodity that has divided nations, enriched nations and destroyed nations. We all know that oil is a major export out of the Middle East and that many countries around the Middle East rely on the dividends that such a commodity provides. The revenue from oil production, a state run venture influenced by both government and major oil companies is tremendous.  Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and  United Arab Emirates are all members of OPEC.  There are 11 member countries in all. The United States isn't one of them. Member Countries hold about 75% or the worlds oil reserves, and supply about 40% of the worlds oil.   After the Iran-Iraq war Iraq was heavily indebted to several Arab countries including a $14 billion debt to Kuwait. Saddam Hussein had hoped to repay that debt by  raising the price of oil through OPEC oil production cuts. Kuwait, who was having a border dispute with Iraq wanted to gain leverage in the border dispute and raised production of oil thus lowering the price of oil.  Also, Saddam Hussein claimed that Kuwait had taken advantage of the Iran-Iraq War to drill for oil and build military outposts on Iraqi soil near Kuwait. Hussein also claimed that Iraq had performed a service to all Arabs by acting as a buffer  when it went to war with Iran. Hussein felt that Saudi Arabia and Kuwait could at least renegotiate the Iraqi debt or cancel the Iraqi war debt all together.    During the war with Iran, Iraq enjoyed good relations with the U.(George H. W. Bush). The U.S. leaned towards supporting Iraq despite earlier Soviet influence in Iraq. The U.S. supplied weapons and economic aid to Iraq during its war with Iran.  After the war the U.S. Congress moved to isolate Iraq diplomatically and economical over concerns of Human Rights abuses in Iraq.   In July of 1990 Saddam Hussein amassed troops along the Kuwaiti border after negotiations regarding the Iraq-Kuwait border dispute stalled. Iraq summoned April Glaspie, an American ambassador, to meet with Saddam Hussein where Saddam presented his grievances regarding Kuwait while promising not to invade before one more round of negotiations.   On August 2nd, 1990 Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and set up strategic posts throughout the country including the emir's palace. Kuwaiti forces were overwhelmed and offered little resistance.  Fortunately, the Kuwaiti airforce was able to flee to Saudi Arabia. Iraqi troops looted medical and food supplies, detained 1000s of civilians and took over the media. Thousands of Western visitors were taken hostage and the Iraqis tried to use them as bargaining chips.   After the initial invasion U.S. and Kuwaiti delegations requested and were granted a meeting of the U.N. Security Council. It was during that meeting when Resolution 660 was drafted and implemented. It condemned the Iraq invasion of Kuwait and demanded an immediate withdrawal from Kuwait. The Arab League would draft a similar resolution the very next day but included in their resolution that a solution to the conflict come from within the Arab League. Saddam Hussein did not withdraw his troops and on August 6th a resolution (661) was passed and economic sanctions  were placed on Iraq.   The U.S. was also  concerned about Iraqi troop buildup close to the Saudi Arabia border and there was concerns that the Iraqis would invade Saudi Arabia.    Saddam Hussein had been given directive by the U.N. Security Council to remove his troops from Kuwait or face the consequences. His refusal to remove troops from Kuwaiti soil and his declaration that parts of Kuwait were extensions of the Iraqi province,  Basra,  was a firm indication that Saddam wasn't going to give into U.N. Security Council's demands. Iraq has never accepted the legitimacy of  Kuwait independence. Saddam Hussein's intention was to reclaim its "province" Kuwait at all costs.     From August through to November the U.N. Security Council and the Arab League proposed and  passed a long series of resolutions regarding the conflict. One of  the most significant resolutions passed occurred on November 29th.  Resolution 678 gave Iraq a withdrawal date of January 15th, 1991 and authorizing all necessary means to uphold Resolution 660, a resolution authorizing use of force. Saddam Hussein had a month and a half to comply with the demands of Resolution 678 and he failed. On January 16th, 1991, a coalition of 34 countries launched Operation  Desert Storm, air strikes on Iraq.  On February 24th, the ground operation, Operation Desert Sabre, began.  On February 26th Iraqi troops began to pull out of Kuwait, sabotaging oilfields along the way. 100 hours later George H. W. Bush declared a ceasefire. Iraqi troops had withdrawn from Kuwait but the war was far from over.   After a peace conference in allied-occupied Iraq, Saddam Hussein encountered resistance in the North with the Kurds and Shiites in the south.  Both the Shiites and the Kurds were hoping for U.S. support after the U.S. stated that they would support a peoples uprising against Saddam. However, once they began fighting to overthrow Saddam Hussein, the realization that no American support was forthcoming in their attempted coup, Iraqi Generals loyal to Hussein, crushed the Kurdish troops.   After the uprisings in the North and South, no fly-zones were established by the U.K and U.S. to protect the Kurdish and Shiite minorities.  Both the U.K. and the U.S. combined for more sorties during the 11yrs. after the war then were flown during the war. Economic sanctions were kept in place after the war, however, Iraq was permitted to exchange oil for food under those sanctions. The sanctions would be later identified as the reason for increased deaths in Iraq (90000).  The sanctions and the U. S. military presence in Saudi Arabia fueled the United States negative image in the Middle East.   A United Nations Special Commission was established to monitor Iraq's compliance with restrictions on weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles.  Saddam Hussein was extremely uncooperative when it came to weapons inspections. In fact in 1997 Iraq expelled all U.S. members of the weapons inspection team, claiming that the U.S. was using the inspections as an opportunity to engage in espionage.  Evidence of biological weapons programs was found at one site and non-compliance was found at many other other sites during these inspections.   Today, a coalition is once again waging war in Iraq. Because of Saddam Hussein's non-compliance to resolutions passed during the Persian Gulf war,  the Iraqi people, and much of the Middle East, is in turmoil. Saddam Hussein has managed to take his "war" and further drive a wedge between middle eastern countries  in their attempt to move towards democracy, freedom and economic stability. Saddam Hussein has fueled the instability in the Middle East.   Saddam Hussein's rise to power was fueled by greed and tyranny. He has committed human rights violations, ruled the people of Iraq with intimidation, murder and torture. He has used religion, promises of healthcare reform, and anti-american sentiment to retain his hold on power. His sons are guilty of the same thing. While others lived in squalor his family  lived in the lap of luxury. He has harbored and supported terrorism while claiming he has no connections to terrorism. One need look no further then Iraq to find one of the most wanted terrorists in the world, al-Zarqawi.   In a few years Saddam Hussein will be likened to some of the biggest despots this world has come to known in the last 40 years.  In a few years it is hoped that stability will win over in the Middle East.  Hopefully in a few years all the world will be able to look back on what the U.S. and its coalition is doing  in the Middle East today and say "it was right thing to do".    The war in Iraq didn't end when GHWB declared a ceasefire in Iraq in 1991 and it didn't end when GWB declared the war over in Iraq.  This war has been going on for 13 years. The war started because Saddam Hussein wanted Kuwait's oil. The war started because Saddam Hussein wanted to reclaim Kuwaiti as an Iraqi province. The war started because Saddam Hussein was desperate. He needed to protect "his" interests, Iraq was his empire. Nobody was going to tell him what to do, especially the Americans and the United Nations.    Saddam Hussein will get his due. His time is up. George W. Bush, his supporters and his allies have seen to that.

      Of the 80 or so oilfields that  have been discovered in Iraq, only 22 have been developed. Pre-war levels of production amounted to about 3 million barrels per day. In comparison Saudi Arabia is currently producing 10.5 million barrels a day. Saudi Arabia is, at the moment, the only country in the Middle East that is capable of moderating world oil prices by using it's excess oil producing capacity.  It was the British, who in 1918, under the advisement of British War Secretary Maurice Hankey, that led to  the development of a new oil state under British Patronage in Mesopotamia. It was oil that brought on the birth of Modern Iraq.  In 1929 the Iraq Petroleum Corp. was created. It was a Western consortium (The Seven Sisters) that was led by four of the seven largest oil corporations in the world. Those corporations were the British predecessors of Shell and BP, the American predecessor of Exxon/Mobil and the Future Total of France. When the Iraq Petroleum Corp. gained control of this prized oil supply the Wall Street crash in 1929 reduced demand for oil. It was around this time that huge new oil fields were discovered in the U.S. and there was a sudden glut of oil on the world market. This inspired the consortium to limit global production. Because of this action development stalled, exploration was reduced and Iraq Petroleum shut out all competition by obtaining all remaining concessions. This was considered a freeze on the further development of new oil fields. With the rising demand for oil in the 1950s and the temporary nationalization of Iran's oil, Iraq Petroleum resumed development. This created another period of over production. Since The Seven Sisters controlled all major oil concessions in the Middle East, they conspired to limit production across the region. This was not shared equally between Iraq, Iran, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia and as a result Iraq was penalized more for violating restraints on development and production of oil. Only 8 of the 35 oil fields discovered in Iraq had been developed by 1960. This did not bode well with the nationalist government in 1961 and as a result the government expropriated The Seven Sisters undeveloped holdings, about 99.5 percent of the total holdings. The new leaders in Iraq did little to develop the oil themselves. Because of political turmoil in Iraq the national oil company, which was formed in 1964, was unable to match the large gains in oil production made by other states in the Middle East.  In 1972 there was relative stability in Iraq. With rising oil prices, Iraq was able to increase its daily oil production from 1.5 million barrels a day to 3.5 million barrels a day in 1979.    When Saddam Hussein rose to power in 1979 the economic boon that was on the horizon for Iraq, faded away. He diverted oil revenue from development to imperial goals and never bothered with newly discovered oil fields.   To those of you that think this war in Iraq is about oil, you're partially right. It is a war caused by oil, a war that Saddam Hussein started when he failed to continue to develop his nations oil fields. He chose instead to divert the funds gained from oil productions into palaces and business ventures for himself, his family, his most loyal advisors in his government and their families. Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and was briefly an occupying force there. His goal, in my opinion, was to take control of a country that is recognized as a power in oil production and seize their assets in an attempt to make up for the gains his predecessors had achieved and that he had  squandered with wreckless abandon. He chose to invade a country that could offer little resistance to the Iraqi military forces. Let's face it, he was being a bully. His inability to continue developing oil fields at a pace similar to that of Saudi Arabia, Iran, and Kuwait drove him to take desperate measures.  How long did Hussein think he could continue to steal from the country he led before "his" people rebelled against him. How long did he think he could remain unaccountable for his actions. He obviously felt that his world was closing in around him and he needed to act fast. With the outside world monitoring human rights violations, and the conditions in which the Iraqi people were living, it is in this writer's opinion that Saddam Hussein, in an act of desperation and an attempt to prolong his leadership in Iraq, elected to invade Kuwait. It was an ill-fated plan in the end. As a result of his actions and his unwillingness to abide by conditions set out by the Americans, and approved by the United Nations, sanctions were levelled against Iraq. Those sanctions, unfortunately only caused more suffering for the people who had been suffering under the rule of Saddam Hussein's regime.   Saddam Hussein's failure to comply with the United Nations protocol resulted in the war that the Americans lead in Iraq today. It isn't about oil for George Bush, hell the U.S. and Canada produce enough of their own oil. This war started out as greed in Kuwait. Since that time this war has grown to include terrorism. It has created more anti-american sentiment in the Middle East and continues to cause dissention among many governments in many nations.  The war in Iraq was necessary. Saddam Hussein's ironfisted rule was no longer acceptable in the Modern World. The atrocities that he and his regime are responsible for were crimes against humanity. Saddam Hussein is a tyrant in the eyes of most of the world. George Bush, though he isn't doing himself any favors, is helping the nation of Iraq into becoming a democracy. He is attempting to help the Iraqi people form their own government, police their own nation. He is attempting to help the Iraqi people gain economic stability and prosperity.   I agree that innocent people are being slaughtered by occupying forces and insurgents. And I agree that the U.S. should pull out of Iraq. When is the right time for the U.S. to pull out of Iraq? Will the killing of innocents stop when they do? Afterall, the insurgents are killing more innocents then the americans at the moment. As long as the insurgents are resisting, the longer the U.S. is likely to stay.  Do you think George Bush is fighting a war in Iraq for the oil?

      On any given night, three hundred and sixty five days of the  year, the lake was a magnet. It could suck you into its bosom like a lint to a vacuum.   The lake offered a calmness, a kind of "utopia" for the people that lived in and around it, yet the lake never slept. From locals to tourist, whether hunter, sledder or sun worshipper, the lake was an inviting chance to release the free spirit from within us.  Those of us in the community that lived on the lake shore took advantage of every available moment that time would spare, to soak in all that mother nature and small town life had to offer. It was easy to become absorbed and wander aimlessly until you were "lost" or in a "daze", stoned from the air, and whatever you had in your pocket.  People from all walks of life, live or visit in this town. A town where the highway that runs through it, is the one of the major links between Northern and Southern Ontario.  The lake is known in these parts as one of the largest, landlocked, island free lakes in the world. Whether Spring, Summer, Fall or Winter, you can be sure to find life here at the lake.  I could be found at the lake at any given moment, it didn't matter about the weather or time day. Each season offered a different mood, in spring it was energy, in summer it was vibrant, fall was kind of lazy and laid back, and winter was celebration and freezing your nuts off. I could never figure out why people would venture out in -30 degrees celsius weather just to go snowmobiling. Then again, I could never figure out what I wanted from life until I moved from the city to live near a lake.

      My mother can be quite a handful sometimes. If you knew my mother long enough, you would know what I mean. She is a master manipulator, a saboteur, and acts without malice when she wants revenge. It's a great quality to have in a mother, you learn about survival at a very young age. You would think that after living under my mother's roof for 16 years, that I would have learned a thing or two about my mother's motivation, and to what lengths she would go to get what she wants. Well, in 1998 she got what she wanted, me living closer than 2000 kilometres from my mother's hometown. There was a reason I lived that far from home. She was the reason. But in 1998 that all changed.  For several months in 1998 my mother had been dogging me to move closer to her. She knew that my personal life was on rocky ground. My mother is privy to what went on in my personal life, afterall she is my mom. In fact, my mother knew so much about my personal life that she was able to use some of it in her scheme to get me to move back home.  At first I didn't take the bait, but then my mother informed me that she had cancer and asked me what it would take to get me to move back home. I said "a job", preferably in the Hospitality Industry. When she told me that the local resort/hotel was looking for somebody to run the bar, I thought, that's right up my alley, afterall, I had been moonlighting as a manager and bartender for 19 years, and working at a resort on the lake seemed like an opportunity for me to have a working holiday, help my mother out and decide what I wanted to do with my life. I was 37 years old at the time and if I was going to make some changes in my life, now was the time to do it.  After a couple of phone calls to the resort owner regarding the manager's position, and a week of tying up loose ends in Calgary, I loaded up my black Firebird with my cat, a black Turkish Angora named Pookey, some tools, and a hockey bag full of clothes and started my drive across the country. I was headed to mom's place.

      Living around a lake all year round doesn't come cheap. In the winter there's snowmobiling and ice fishing. In the spring and summer, fishermen and cottagers begin to arrive weekend in and weekend out until Thanksgiving and then the hunters arrive for deer and moose season. People fleeing north to escape the cities are considered tourists around here. To this community tourism was their bread and butter. Without it times would be tough around here.  Tourism is the major industry around here. Its the gateway to the northern part of Ontario in Canada. After tourism you have a 2 large car dealership and 2 smaller used dealers. Logging is always popular. With logging comes saw mills, lumber yards, and construction, too bad the employment was only seasonal. Add to that, government services, convenience stores, a gas station, supermarket, hardware store, about a dozen restaurants and any small commercial venture created through self-employment and you come up with; a community of about 1000 people, smalltown rivalries, gossip like you wouldn't believe and a hangover every damn weekend.   I guess I should tell you that my first opportunity was managing the local bar and helping out at what was supposed to be "the place to be" for tourists and locals. I have to tell you, opportunity knocked more than once while I worked there. Its quite a story.

      Man, Summer is finally here. The day started out fine, it was warming up, sky was getting clearer, and it was a good day for golf.  The second hole on a nine hole course faced, the lake. The three of us would be heading in that direction ater a quick game of golf. A few beers at the beach, enjoying the sights and a bonfire later on was all we wanted. All over, by maybe 2am at the latest. Didn't turn out that way. I know what you're thinking, but it's not that. You were guessing a party, right? Well, too bad. The party didn't happen. First sight at the beach was 18 and blonde. Now most of you would think thats a good start, but me, at 42yrs. of age, that is so wrong.   On a day like today the Lake is quite a sight. Bikinis, bikinis and more bikinis. Be still my beating heart. It used to be a "meat market" for me. Hanging out at the beach was a great way to "hookup" with girls and a great way to "score". I can't imagine it being any different today, though the type of guy who is hanging out at the beach now is young, inexperienced and usually "fucked" up on drugs and alcohol. I guess that's every girls dream date now. Afterall, the girls in the bikinis seem to cling to that type of guy nowadays.  Yes, there are some real classy guys between the ages of 15 and mid 20s hanging out at the beach.  You know the type, the macho, too good to work type. The kinda guy that lives for the "party" and stumbles around the beach looking to find that one special bikini clad girl he can hang out with for a few days. And the girls, what is wrong with them? If I behaved the way some of these guys behaved towards the girls today, when I was their age, I would have been slapped, kicked in the nuts and told to "get lost". I literally would have been crawling away with blue balls. But nope, the girls play along, hoping that sooner or later the guy will just go away. I guess the young girls on the beach have forgotten, or never learned that the more attention you pay to us, no matter how much of an asshole we can be, the more likely we are going to hang around. The funny thing is that the girls will bitch and complain about the guy that is being the asshole, yet encourage him to stay. Is it for their amusement or is because they just don't know how to get rid of guy like that?  Then there's the nice guy, like myself, honest to a fault, polite and a little cheeky. Getting laid isn't the first thing on my mind. Making sure I didn't offend the girls in the bikinis was the only thing on my mind, afterall we were enjoying the view. A little respect might go a long way in forming a good, healthy relationship with a girl. Who knows, it could lead to romance or a very good friendship, neither of which I was looking for. Either way, I'm not crawling on the beach, moaning and groaning because I just got kicked in the nuts for something I said or did. I'm walking away with my head held high instead of my hands on my aching balls. And the girls in the bikinis, I'll see them again and they'll remember me as the "nice guy" instead of one of the drunken beach bums that wouldn't leave them alone. Guys like that give guys like me a bad name. Guys like that deserve a whole lot more than a kick in the nuts. Don't you think? Afterall, it was the guys at the beach today that killed our party. We spent too much time keeping them from getting into trouble. Yes, we were babysitting at the beach and trying to keep the girls from buggering off. Its a tough job but somebody has to do it.   So you see, it wasn't much of a party afterall. A day that started out fine turned into a day of making sure that the girls in the bikinis stuck around and the drunken idiots didn't get too close to them. Hey, at least nobody got kicked in the nuts.

      As I headed east along the Trans-Canada highway from Calgary I couldn't help but wonder what would possess me to drive half way across the country to a place that didn't have very many opportunities for me. After a couple of hours of driving I spotted a hitchiker who was headed to Ottawa. As I passed by him I thought to myself that the scruffy looking guy looked harmless enough, and I could use the company. Somebody to shoot the shit with on the drive to Ontario, so I pulled over and he hopped in. It turns out he is on his way to Ottawa to visit with his mother.  The guy was barely 20yrs. old and he had decided to collect his last paycheck and hitchhike to Ottawa to see his mother. A few minutes after meeting each other for the first time, we realized that for the time being, we had a lot in common. The fact that we were both going to see our mothers was eerie. Maybe it was some sort of sign or omen. Maybe it was coincidence or fate, who knows. We became friends fast and the friendship would end once I arrived at my destination in Ontario.  Six hours later we arrived in Regina. After slamming back a few beers on our way to Regina we were glad to be pulling up in front of my father's place. The cat wasn't so happy. The eight and a half hour drive, for a black cat, in a black firebird with the t-tops off, on a hot autumn day, left kitty in a very scared and pissed off state of mind. The fact that I had her in a small pet tote didn't help much either. She never ate or drank anything offered her during the entire drive to Regina. In fact, she didn't eat the entire trip to Ontario. She drank some, but only when I encouraged her to drink from my water bottle. She didn't like this trip and she showed it.  I introduced Brian, my hitchhiker friend, to my father and his young wife, she was 38 and my father was 58 or 59 years old. They had a daughter, my half sister, she was 14. My dad met his wife when she was 17 years old. He saw her drinking in a bar one time and fell in love with her. At the time, my dad figured she was in her early twenties. He later found out how old she really was and he didn't seemed bothered by it. They moved in together when she turned 18 and married 7 years ago. Today, my stepmother is a survivor of breast cancer and works as a nurse in Regina. My father is semi-retired.  The overnight stay at my father's home did not go without incident. First my father confronted me about moving closer to my mother, he thought I was making a bad choice by moving to Ontario. He couldn't understand why I would care enough to look after mom while she was battling cancer, since she never really gave a damn about anybody else but herself. My mother would later say the same thing about my father a few years later, though he wasn't ill at the time. Once my father finished putting his two cents in, he wished me luck and we sat down to dinner. It wasn't often that I was able to sit down to dinner with my father, this was a rare occassion.  After dinner it was time to figure out what the hell was wrong with the cat. What normally was a brave, fearless cat, was now a scared, big ball of black fur. I spent the better part of an hour trying to corner it so I could grab it, feed it, and stuff it back in the pet tote. When I did finally corner it I couldn't reach the damn thing. She had managed to flee to the basement and find refuge under a pile of junk that I was too lazy to dig through to reach her. I was getting pissed off and the damn cat knew it. I eventually gave up trying to wait the cat out of her hiding spot and went upstairs. Out of spite I turned off the lights and closed the basement door, she was going to spend the rest of the night there and I was going to get some sleep. I had to be up early in the morning and I didn't have time to pissing around with the cat.  Morning arrived too soon. I needed more sleep. I grumpily rolled out of bed and jumped into the shower and went downstairs to see about some breakfast. Dad asked me about the cat and I went down to the basement to get her while breakfast was being prepared. The cat was still hiding under the pile of junk and her food hadn't been touched. I began to rummage through the junk pile, tossing things here, tossing things there. The cat kept moving deeper and deeper into the junk pile and wasn't about to be caught. There was no way she was going into the pet tote as far as she was concerned. Ever try to reason with a cat? It doesn't work. The more I tried to reason with her, or beg her to come out, the more stupid and angrier I got. It got to the point that I was just grabbing and tossing everything that got in my way. After becoming totally frustrated, my cat decided to be co-operative and sauntered out of the junk pile in her arrogant, catty little way. I quickly grabbed her by the scruff of her neck, shouted obscenities at her and tossed her into the pet tote, vowing to never let her out until I arrived in Ontario. That would turn out to be about a 13 hour drive.
