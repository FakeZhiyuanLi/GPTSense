        Three years, four months and fifteen days ago our daughter was born.  This is my third child and after nine months of mapping out her entire life, she was finally in our world.  Our first daughter, she was going to have her father, Matt's love of the outdoors and my love of music.  She would be athletic.  Playing soccer like her eldest brother, or baseball like her other brother.  She would grow up a tomboy like I did.  Never letting the boys get the best of her. Playing at the games just as hard as they did.    Yet..on the other hand, if she grew up wanting to play dolls and have tea parties and wear dresses and all of the girl stuff, well, that would be perfect to.  I could adjust.     She would have the voice of an angel.  Singing along with all of the Disney CD's and other kids music.  Growing up to be in the high school choir, a soloist like her Aunt, be in all of the musicals, just like I was. Or, on the other hand,if she wanted to be a cheerleader, well...that would be fine to. Again, I can adjust.     She will have the classic beauty that runs on both sides of the family. Her fathers dark green eyes that flash with my quick temper.  My dark blond hair and long eyelashes.  My mothers long slender hands and my husbands mothers natural grace.  Yes, she would be beautiful.    All of this ran through my mind in the first few minutes of her life, all confirmed as Matt held his first baby girl for the first time and whispered 'Hello, Nessa. I'm your Daddy. I love you.'  Then the mid-wife came back in. 'Lori, the doctors want to run some test.  They are pretty sure she has Downs Syndrome.'   In that small fraction of time, I suddenly knew what it truly meant to have your dreams fall apart and your heart broken.     Nessa was diagnosed Downs Syndrome. Trisomy 21, the most common form of Downs Syndrome. And she was beautiful.  She has chestnut brown hair and the most wonderful smile that brings delight to any room. She has my quick temper,especially when she refuses to participate in some of her therapy. Her father is completely wrapped around her little finger, and she knows it.   And today...today she took her first steps. Unassisted by walker or brace, her first steps, and as I picked her up and swung her around the room we laughed and her fathers dark green eyes sparkled with wonder.   And she is beautiful.

      The phone rings, 'Is Iain there?'  Its a girls voice...definatly a girls voice.  I hand the phone to my 12 year old son, 'It's for you.' and I turn back to the dishes in the sink.  Pretending not to listen but with one ear tuned on the boy like a cat.  'Yeah......just eating lunch...pizza...sure...uh-hu...yeah...well, I gotta go. See ya.  Bye.'  He hangs up the phone and hands me his empty plate.  'So,'I ask; actually sounding causual, 'who was that?'  'Just some girl.'  'Does this girl have a name?'  He gives me the eye roll 'Its just some girl. I think her name is Georgia or something.  I'm going bike riding with the guys!'  This last yelled as he launches himself out the front door. Just some girl. Can't remember her name.  Whew!  Dodged the puberty bullet one more time.  I sit and finish eating lunch with the five year old boy and his three year old sister as the two month old baby girl sleeps.  Egad.
