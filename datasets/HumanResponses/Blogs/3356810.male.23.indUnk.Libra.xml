          i feel evil now...... the dark side clouds my mind...... i did soooooooooooooooo bad in my mid-years......( to my expectations only)   I am Little bit of loneliness A little bit of disregard A handful of complaints But I can't help the fact That everyone can see these scars I am What I want you to want What I want you to feel But it's like No matter what I do I can't convince you To just believe this is real So I let go Watching you Turn your back like you always do Face away and pretend that i'm not But i'll be here 'Cause you're all I got  I am A little bit insecure A little unconfident 'Cause you don't understand I do what I can But sometimes I don't make sense I am What you never want to say But i've never had a doubt It's like no matter what I do I can't convince you For once just to hear me out So I let go Watching you Turn your back like you always do Face away and pretend that i'm not But i'll be here 'Cause you're all I got  I can't feel The way I did before Don't turn your back on me I won't be ignored Time won't heal This damage anymore Don't turn your back on me I won't be ignored  No Hear me out now You're gonna listen to me Like it or not Right now    I AM ANGRY !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ****! ****! ****!

You’ve played the victim for so long now in this game  What I thought was true is made of fiction  And im following the same  But if I try to make sense of this mess im in  Im not sure of were I should begin  Im falling im falling   Now im in over my head with something I said completely misread im better off dead  And now I see how fake you can be  These hypocrisies beginning to get to me   It’s none of my concern  Don’t look to me because I don’t believe in  Fame  I guess you never heard ive met our makers  They don’t even know your name  But if I had to say goodbye to leave this hell  Id say my time has served me well  Im falling im falling   Now im in over my head with something I said completely misread im better off dead  And now I see how fake you can be  These hypocrisies beginning to get to   This came long before those who suffer more  Im to awake for this to be a nightmare  What’s my disgrace I lost the human race  No one plans for it to blow up in their face  Who said it was easy to put back all these pieces   Now im in over my head with something I said completely misread im better off dead  And now I can see how fake you can be  These hypocrisies starting to get to me  Over my head better off dead, over my head better off dead, alright!
