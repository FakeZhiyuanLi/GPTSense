         okay, so here it is...AGAIN. lol This is like the 3rd time I've redone my blog entirely. Oh well what ever. I am @ work right now and everyone is about to take off early...I have too much to get done though...grrrrr.... so I am going to stay till 5. boohooo.       Aolani is getting sooooooo demanding now. Wow that little girl is independent!  Ed brought her to lunch today with us.  We ate at Quizno's.  I love quizno's!  Anyway, she totally know's what she want's and how she want's it and where she want's and with who she want's it and so on.  Seriously, she go that from her DAD not me. hehe   It was fun though, she kinda tripped out a bit when I had to go back to work but I'll make sure I snuggle her extra tight tonight when I get home.

      FINALLY!!!  I have all my music downloaded!!! LOL I stayed up all night with Shannon downloading a bunch of music and making copies and stuff, from and for our friends.  Ed and the "high tide crew" haha, when to Long Boards last night to sing a few High Tide songs.  I stayed @ home, for reason's I just said.  I talked to the former singer of High Tide, who's name I will leave out.  It's strange the way closure works.   Aolani's room is coming along really well.  We got a new twin bed for her now!  I am buying a princess vale that hangs fromt he celing and then flow's around her head board!  It's like 30 bucks @ target, so I couldn't refuse! lol The house is way cute now too.  I have all our dolphin stuff and shells/candles put across MY HUGE FIRE PLACE! lol I love the fireplace here! It works! and it's warm! lol Well I need to get Laundry done.

       whoa Nelly!!! haha! I got soooooo wasted @ our Trumpet players house last night. I went with Ed and Andy ( my roommate). I didn't mean too, but I had drank Heinekin and then a Margarita, and Heinekin and the Margarita, etc...I apparently forgot about the little rule: "beer before liquor, never been sicker :(, liquor before beer, your in the clear." Ed had to make me sleep on the couch!!! It was fun though. I am so glad that Lulu is no longer around, things are just so much more "chill."   This morning I picked up Aolani from Dan & Fairy's house, She's sooooooo freakin' funny. Dan &amp; Fairy have been so supportive of Aolani and I. My parents however...Well it's just a shame the drama they surround themselves in. I finally came to the very lame decision to put a restraining order on My parents. I hate that it came down to this...But you have to do what you have to do.   Shannon came and picked me up @ the house and then we came here (shannon's house) and BBQ'ed and swam...I feel sooooooo tired now! Ed is still @ work so when he get's off we are goin to cruise back to the pad and watch   The Last samurai   with Tom Cruise.   Well, I better go...Lani is gettin' kinda WILD!!! lol   -hightidemae

       I just found out that it's out trumpet player's Birthday today, so we are all going to chill @ his party instead of here. We were all going to get faded here @ my pad and celebrate Shannon being home...but hey, party's are way more fun! I watched Office space w/Ed last night, it was soooooo freakin' funny! I love the scene where they "jump" the fax machine. It kill's me.   Anyhow, my roommate fell asleep on the couch and my typing is probably buggin' him, so I'll keep this one short.   peac out   -htmae

        Wow, I am pretty tired right now. Ed and Chris are here working on the sublime tribute album tracks. I can't believe how much work it is to lay a simple track down. You have to lace everything separately, bass, guitar, vocals etc. It's just a lot of work! Whew! So my best friend Shannon is finally coming home on Saturday. She went on Vacation about a month &amp; a half ago, but never came back! I guess she just needed some time away to figure out what the heck she wanted to do with herself. It's cool, everyone goes through that @ some point in life. Aolani and I had a really melow day too. I took her to the local 711 though on my secter 9 board today. She loved it!!! She was sooo stoked to get her popsicle too. She waited in line and paid for it herself. Well, I paid for it, but she gave the cashier the dollar. So whatever. Oh! I almost forgot!!! I made a new logo for my band!!! What do you think? hehe          I wanted to write: "Are you ready to ride?" underneith but Ed wanted it to say "San Diego Dub Style...so go figure. Well I am sooooooooo tired, so I am gonna get off the puter now. peace easey S.D.
