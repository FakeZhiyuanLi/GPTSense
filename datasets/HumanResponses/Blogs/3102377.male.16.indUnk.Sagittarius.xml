      how could it haf been,Lord?no doubt u facilitated.but my own sister,one of the reasons i became yer follower,has abandoned u completely.how could it haf been?it was she who gave mi my first bible.it aint very expensive and was sorta surplus.but still,she gave it to mi.i fear a day which i will do the same.will i ever?Lord,keep watch over me,seventeen is mountin its burden upon mi.haix.oso,truly christianity is a fashion statement these days.every bazaar i go i see products wif yer Word engraved upon it.yet,they are sold for money and not for the true meanin of the words.a big cross aint necessarily mean u love Jesus.nor an expensive bible mean u know His Word.i accept the fact tat i m one of them.i rarely touch my niv bible,the one my sis gave,my first bible.coz i got a study bible.yet,i rarely come in contact wif the study bible too.frankly,i m just as disappointing as everyone else.it's the heart tat counts.

      i am antares.antares is mi.but i cant seem to figure wat i m.i m just tryin to be too many things.i try to serve God and money.both at the same time.and Lord,i cant.cast my worries away for me,Lord.i haf been no faithful servant.i haf lost sight of U.i forgot who i realli am.i m a Christian,first and foremost.i forgot abt it.my allegiance is to U,Jesus.which simply means tat i am Yer servant.nudge mi wif yer stick,harder if u hafta.i am a hard sheep.when i was young,i listened and obeyed U patiently.now i m older,my skin thickened,hardened,and i turn away from the Shepherd who listened patiently to my childish bleating and comforted me when i was in fright.U brought me to green pastures,and u led me through the rushing rivers.now i refuse to bend under yer guiding stick.hit me harder,Father,or i wont listen.i just m refusing to listen.once more i say again,i m yer servant,and my allegiance sworn to U.if i m to truly uphold the meanin of my name,i will hafta uphold honor den.Lord,my first priority is to seek U.be like U.and to serve U.

      r we real in our physical lives or r we truer in our electronic reflections?for mi,i m truer in the latter context.truer.colder.harder.it's like the deprivation of expressions online sticks steel in mi.so many of us,would rather unveil our frustrations and disappointments to an inanimate object than a person.yeah,i admit,i m one of them.simply coz we fear repercurssions.echoes of ruin from broadcastin yer heart to yer frenz/families.however,do note tat as we lead our net lives,excess periods of stay in our proxy realities may creep and seep into our physicai world.reflections reflectin itself on life.tat is my warning to u.antares is cold-blooded.as m i growing into.

      The Big Flood  It had been raining for days and days, and a terrible flood had come over the land. The waters rose so high that one man was forced to climb onto the roof of his house.  As the waters rose higher and higher, a man in a rowboat appeared, and told him to get in. "No," replied the man on the roof. "I have faith in the Lord; the Lord will save me." So the man in the rowboat went away. The man on the roof prayed for God to save him.  The waters rose higher and higher, and suddenly a speedboat appeared. "Climb in!" shouted a man in the boat. "No," replied the man on the roof. "I have faith in the Lord; the Lord will save me." So the man in the speedboat went away. The man on the roof prayed for God to save him.   The waters continued to rise. A helicopter appeared and over the loudspeaker, the pilot announced he would lower a rope to the man on the roof. "No," replied the man on the roof. "I have faith in the Lord; the Lord will save me." So the helicopter went away. The man on the roof prayed for God to save him.  The waters rose higher and higher, and eventually they rose so high that the man on the roof was washed away, and alas, the poor man drowned.  Upon arriving in heaven, the man marched straight over to God. "Heavenly Father," he said, "I had faith in you, I prayed to you to save me, and yet you did nothing. Why?" God gave him a puzzled look, and replied "I sent you two boats and a helicopter, what more did you expect?"    cute joke,aint it?a gentle reminder to all tat God aint always the supernatural sort.He prefers to werk His stuff thru people.average joes/janes like u and mi.keep alert.His help might juz be around the corner in the form of a dolt.

      wat's the right way?right.wat's right?opposite of left?wat's left?opposite of right?yes,this is lame.but it is no joke.i nvr mentioned it was.i aint smiling.the right things,the right ways of the world,the same world that raised us,are relative.all it knows is simply as simple as that.relative.right is onli so right coz wrong is so not right.it's okay if we face the distinct extremes.the black and white zones.simply right and wrong.let's approach the line den.unless u recently progressed into secondary school,u will know quite well that there is usually no line.black and white seeps into each other.a region of gray.a part where right/wrong intermixes.this world's ways r to be abhorred and avoided.be warned.  let the wise see into these words and nod approval. may the ignorant look away sneering and tear in the end.

      i suddenly m so tired.not coz i juz returned from a chalet wif insufficient sleep.tat is physical.this feels different.mental.sorta emotional,possibly?tired of this reality.the chalet reality seemed so perfect,in spite of its obvious flaws.perhaps i m juz suffering from some sorta withdrawal symptom,but rarely,so rarely do i feel so sick of reality.even tho much of the time in the chalet was somehow wasted,it seemed so much better.not becoz of pool,nor the cycling,nor the bbq.it wasnt any of those inanimate factors.it was the ppl.i dunno how to say it.u gotta experience it to understand wat i m sayin.our memories r worth their value not becoz of the things.we all know how ez it is to forget things.but oddly,it is so much harder to forget the ppl.there r exceptions,i concede.but more often it is the human factor that brings joy.  or perhaps,i m juz so physically tired tat my mind is affected greatly.

      watched a rental,"changing lanes".yeah,it's been out for some time.din manage to catch it den.one of the usual reasons.shortage of funds bac den.tho the effect aint as gd as on the cinematic big screen itself,the show more than makes up for the lack of big booming noises.i'm sure most of u noe the storyline.a lawyer and a regular married-alcoholic-tat-ended-in-divorce Joe cross paths on the highway.both,curiously, r goin the same way,to the courts.lawyer has big mercs,reg-Joe has puny aged car.crashed into each other,blah blah blah.their ensuing encounters r..most disturbing.but i like one of the phrase ben affleck said," today will be like that girl,it will keep coming bac to u,reminding u of a life u could haf had ."(watch the show to find out more)  how often haf we wished tat we could haf made a different choice when we went wrong?let's juz say,when we lie abt something vital.it rarely juz fades away.it snowballs.another lie.another lie.another lie.bigger and bigger each time.all it takes is the first wrong,and fear of facing the truth and the music.watch out u all. two wrongs dun make a right .dun say tat at the end of the day,u will do more good than harm.to u,it may be less harm,but to the suffering one,tat minor harm,tat minor delay,tat minor mistake of yers could irreversibly alter his or her life.dun make the first mistake.even if u do,fix it.fix it right this second.

      sometimes i wish i m less than antares.but tat is mi.and i cannot deny.the world attempts to strangle mi in its cords of trappin.but i will not be denied my path.it is tiring to fight off these things daily,may i haf strength.truly,the closer u r to the light,the darker the shadow grows.it is quite simple den to deduce tat there is no shadow without any light.dun be so sure.the light is the only thing tat fends off the darkness tat surrounds u.dun be foolish and believe tat killin the light will set u free.no.instead a fog of death will truly claim u.its deadly vapors giftin u worldly hallucinations.do remember tat,there will come a time,when the light will grow so bright and so vast,tat no shadow can coexist with it.that time is near.seek the light now,or die forever.the blessed gift of trancension awaits u.u haf been told.

      sixteen was great when it came.the dreaded exam came and gone.now i m seventeen.and tired.sixteen may seem a great barrier but it seemed so minor now,as compared to wat lies ahead in seventeen.this step up the ladder seems to suck the life outta me.not just energy,but oso life wif a L.this age is new to me.a new experience.a new wealth of data to collect and interpret.my ways no longer werk effectively anymore.time to evolve.sixteen seems so easy compared to seventeen.but there was once when sixteen was new to me.and i adapted.seventeen is a shelf of bks i haf barely begun to read.let's hope i wont miss a word.however,seventeen is far too straining on my speech and thought routines.i hafta find a way to circumvent seventeen's unadvised terms.it tires mi to find out i m failing my guidelines.i need to upgrade now.or suffer and lose it all.  antares rion skyseeker.

      yesterday was a visit to a neighbourin country,malaysia.fairly interestin trip.'cos i nv did realli cross the chekpt by foot b4.the first time was by four wheels.did a fair bit of annoying bus-boardin/alightin.i hafta say,on foot,everythin seems different.i went all the way to gentin the first time round,but tis time,we simply stopped at jb.perhaps cos i m sgean,their ways seem almost alien.but i find it most impressionable.unlike sg life,where everything is nearly picture.perfect.organization.there,it's wat i define as an organized mess.amazingly messy,yet orderly in its own right.there,u dun hafta goto piracy.piracy literally comes to u.n unlike sg's makeshift heck-care stalls,the piracy shops there r a representation of organized crime.(empty packages-collect contents at counter/test running the game literally.)the ppl,they r survivors,every one of them.they carve out a niche for themselves,even the poorest ones.unlike sgean,awash in their affluence n pleasures,lost in their petty quarrels,forgettin the priority ones.either tat or mindless automatons,followin their fixed routine programs,eternally unchanging,till death cease their clockworks.i haf seen onli a glimpse of malaysia.the homeland of a sister.;)
