      cont...  Take It From the Wedding Belle1        9. Obviously, from the pointers above, your wedding is where your connection will be put to good use. Professional emcees could be stiff and corny and they sometimes point to the ninong or the boss as the FOB (Father of the Bride). Tap your common friends for that personal touch (because they really know you) and for things that you want (or do not want) them to say.  10. To avoid balae tampuhan, make the gown/barong designs of the 2 sets of parents identical. Choose a design that works well for all body types and sizes, a design you feel they will all look good wearing.  11. For that desired drama, always close the church doors before the bride enters. Make sure everyone's looking at the doorway, expecting for the bride to come in, so you have their attention.  12. Connected to tip11, make sure that no tambays or vendors are ever seen by the guests or captured by the cameras when the church doors open for you. Let no eye sores spoil the drama. Similarly, don't let these tambas chase and catch the doves or butterflies in the background when you release them.  13. Minor: Have somebody (an adult) take care of the wedding rings and arrhae pillow after the procession. Kids have short attention span and are usually bored during the entire ceremony so they run around the church. When the portion of the ceremony calls for the rings or the arrhae, it's a must that somebody secure them and hand them over and the kids can go on running all they want.  14. Again, minor, but you have to be conscious of this superstition: Always light both candles at the same time. There's a superstition that whatever candle in whatever side is lit first, the spouse of that person will pass away first. Also, keep lighting the candles when the wind blows out the fire. When the fire in whatever candle is blown out, the spouse of that person is also believed to pass away first. So even if you're not superstitious, to avoid the foreboding tension, you may consider following this.  15. To cut on costs, and if you're comfortable with sponsors or relatives, you may opt to have them sponsor a certain small item as a gift so they know what you need and you spare them from ransacking the mall for a nice present.Example: wedding cake, invitations, souvenirs, wines, local honeymoon destination, massage or spa, your hair and make-up.  16. Please make your souvenirs functional. You don't want to spend on something that will only collect dust in your guests' drawers. Edible souvenirs are also now acceptable - miniature cakes, a nicely stacked and packaged gold coin chocolates, and edible flower pots (where crushed cookies become the soil and your sugar candies usually found on cakes become your flowers and leaves). Your favorite charity may also be a beneficiary. Instead of buying small items as souvenirs, donate the amount to an institution and give a written note to your guests (in the same manner you would a souvenir) with their names written and where it's indicated that a donation has been made in their names. For couples who have common sports or hobbies, you may customize your souvenirs to something that fits your personality/lifestyle. Say a golfball, a miniature plane if you're both flight attendants or travelers, miniature vintage cars, etc, that will be nice displays in a glass paneled display cabinet.  So...you ready to get married?

      For those getting married soon, guys planning to propose, etc. here are a few useful tips for a budget wedding coming from a:   a) wedding planner  b) wedding planner getting married   1. Have at least 6 months to a year or more to prepare. This should allow you to include your 13th month pay and annual bonus to add up to your savings.   2. Even if you, Mr. Boyfriend, have not yet proposed but feel that you are right for each other, you should both start saving. You, Ms.Girlfriend, should not wait for him to pop the question before you start saving for a wedding. I don't think it's being assuming especially if you've been talking about it seriously for quite sometime. Wedding or not, it's always good to have something saved up somewhere.   3. Set menu is cheaper and more formal. When people attend weddings, whether or not the camera lights hit them, they try to look good and really dress up for the occasion. You don't want them running around the place in their tux or long gown coming from the buffet table with plate on their right hand and a dessert on their left. Never mind that others say it's tinipid. Just think of the weddings of Ruffa and Ylmaz, Assunta and Jules, Christine and Julius, and you won't see it that way ever again.   4. It's always good to have a friend or a relative from the brotherhood. Msgr. Matt has been a family friend for God knows how long. He's been witness to all kinds of events my family puts together. He celebrated my parents' silver wedding anniversary, blessed our new Godiva,Inc. office, officiated the mass when lolo passed away. Your priest friend or relative will agree to officiate your wedding even outside of the church-well, bawal kasi- (now you can have a Catholic wedding in a garden, by the shore, on a hill, etc.) and you wouldn't have to pay church rental. Stipend lang of whatever cost.   5. Also, connected to knowing somebody from the inside, you could ask him to provide you a choir for your wedding ceremony (for free/minimal charge). Sometimes, all they ask is that you feed them. Then you could save on hiring a singer for your church rites. Or, if you have a friend/relative who sings well, promise him a singing career if he agrees to sing at your wedding =)   6. Have 2 designers/couturier to do the clothes. The more high-end one is for the bride (and maybe the groom) and the average kusturera ni lola/kusturera sa kanto/kumare ni mama will be for the gowns and barongs of the entourage. Clothes of the people in your entourage do not have to be signature-made; after all, your wedding may be the only time they're wearing it (well, so do you but you're the bride so please grab the chance to feel like a princess somehow). You could also buy the materials and just pay for design and labor.   7. If you want flowers prettier than the ones in the church (they're usually included when you pay for church fees), talk to the couple getting married on the same day before you or after you and agree to get a florist, share the flowers, and split the bill. Just make sure that no guests pick out the flowers from the pots or bring the pots of flowers home after the ceremony so that the next wedding won't have kalbo flower stands.   8. Also on flowers: Talk to the church coordinator not to keep the flowers yet while the ceremony is ending and all of you are still inside the church. You'd want the flowers there when you do your recessional march and you're welcomed by guests. I've seen this so many times and it so annoys me. Mothers and titas usually end up arguing with the church coordinator.   more in  take it from the wedding belle2

      Realized that jeff and I gave ourselves good time before getting married.&nbsp; 1 1/2 years...that's a lot of saving up.   With my anticipation growing, I made mental budget allocations for wedding, starting up, ammortization, etc.&nbsp; For a newly wed couple, I allocated around P50k for not so high-end appliances.&nbsp; Dropped by SM Appliance center to find out if I have allocated enough.&nbsp; Well, found out it could actually be sobra.&nbsp; Here's my breakdown (approx. amounts):  6cu ft. condura ref - 7k  21" panasonic flat tv- 7k  la germania 2 burner gas range - 7k  6kg. american home washing machine with drier - 7k  microwave oven - 5k  *forgot to look at the home entertainment stuff (component, dvd player, etc.) but will drop by again later.&nbsp;   So far, that's P33k and hopefully, the home entertainment set (minus the tv that I factored in) costs a little less than 17k.&nbsp; Well, could get a DVD player for around 5k-will just find out how much the sound system costs.

      The good things&nbsp;about being 25:   my parents take me seriously now  my decisions at home matter  they don't just order me around  I can go to places and do things without needing their permission  it's legal to watch porn movies   can always say "work" whenever I need to go somewhere else and celebrate with jeff  it's ok to greet or say goodbye to your boyfriend with a kiss even if they're around  can get married anytime i'm ready  The sad things about being 25:   they don't buy me stuff or treat me out to dinner anymore the way they used to when I was a kid.&nbsp; I am now the one buying stuff for them , treating them out  working my butt off for 5 years with rakets left and right gave them the impression that I can go on spending forever and never go broke.&nbsp; Very wrong!  relatives pressuring me to get married and have twins pronto!  people expecting me to own a car and rent a pad  am still not in a managerial position  not even close to target savings that I originally planned to have when I reach 25  should be an entrepreneur right now with my wedding thing but am not!

      My July 16 birthday has got a good and a bad surprise.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Good: &nbsp; I'm engaged!&nbsp;Well, it's not the most romantic proposal on earth, hell, I don't even have a ring, but it's the ultimate reason I beam as I write this.&nbsp; Waited almost 5 years for this.&nbsp; Now clearly, I see the face of the man I'm gonna marry.&nbsp; Dreams are just so inaccurate.&nbsp;   Bad:  Something happened at home last Sunday.&nbsp; So unforgettable.&nbsp; Ended up with bruised arms and legs and a crushed 9210i.&nbsp; Bruises ok lang, but my most prized phone&nbsp;severely injured, lying on the floor, waaah! The pain is just&nbsp;so unbearable.&nbsp;  Anyway, got a 6600 now.&nbsp; Am not used to spending much on a phone but I got a somewhat expensive one anyway.&nbsp; I lost a really expensive one, too, remember&nbsp;(well, two years ago)?. Nothing compared to a lumang 9210i, believe me.&nbsp; My phone and my computer can't understand each other.&nbsp; I miss my Babylos!   Goodbye, Thailand or Vietnam travel budget.&nbsp; Goodbye, part of our wedding savings.

      When SM Makati was still that old, moldy department store that I regularly visit for some cheap blouses (cheap, meaning not more than P200, hehe!) on my way home, I came to like the Korean stall, Mr.Kimbob, in its food court where I usually have a hurried dinner before heading home.  Felt the loss of real good, heavy, and reasonable Korean food in bento box when SM renovated and opened its foodcourt only 2-3 months after the department store is fully operational.  I felt that Mr. Kimbob needs to be commended even in a humble blog such as this.  Hey, Kimbob, pay me for advertising you =).   Last night, was glad to find out it's back.  I had a bento at P136 and paid for a drink at about P30 and was so busog when stood up.  Boy, the bento had 6 items in it: steamed rice, kimchi, sesame togue with a few carrots and beans, 2 breaded shrimps, a beef strips dish, and japche-Korea's version of pancit (slightly sweet glass noodles with sesame seeds and a few veggies).  The bento also comes with an all-time favorite miso soup with radish strips floating on it. Yum!  Mr.Kimbob also became Jeff's favorite primarily because of its almost grease free food and servings with ample varieties.  Kung nagmamadali ka, nagtitipid pero hindi naman masyado, at gusto ng maraming pagpipilian sa isang bilihan, go check out Kimbob.

      Am into reading Filipino literature right now and found Pablo Neruda's  Tonight I Can Write  a very touching love poem.  Would like to share you both English and Tagalog (thanks to Yayie) translations.  Tonight I can write the saddest lines.  Write, for example, 'The night is starry and the stars are blue and shiver in the distance.'  The night wind revolves in the sky and sings.  Tonight I can write the saddest lines. I loved her, and sometimes she loved me too.  Through nights like this one I held her in my arms. I kissed her again and again under the endless sky.  She loved me, sometimes I loved her too. How could one not have loved her great still eyes.  Tonight I can write the saddest lines. To think that I do not have her. To feel that I have lost her.  To hear the immense night, still more immense without her. And the verse falls to the soul like dew to the pasture.  What does it matter that my love could not keep her. The night is starry and she is not with me.  This is all. In the distance someone is singing. In the distance. My soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.  My sight tries to find her as though to bring her closer. My heart looks for her, and she is not with me.  The same night whitening the same trees. We, of that time, are no longer the same.  I no longer love her, that's certain, but how I loved her. My voice tried to find the wind to touch her hearing.  Another's. She will be another's. As she was before my kisses. Her voice, her bright body. Her infinite eyes.  I no longer love her, that's certain, but maybe I love her. Love is so short, forgetting is so long.  Because through nights like this one I held her in my arms my soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.  Though this be the last pain that she makes me suffer and these the last verses that I write for her.  translated by W.S. Merwin   Pablo Neruda KUNDIMAN (salin ni Pete Lacaba)   Maisusulat ko ang pinakamalulungkot na tula ngayong gabi.   Maisusulat, halimbawa: "Ang gabi'y mabituin, at nanginginig, asul, ang mga tala sa dako pa roon."   Umiikot sa langit ang hangin ng gabi, umaawit.   Maisusulat ko ang pinakamalulungkot na tula ngayong gabi. Siya'y inibig ko, at kung minsan ako'y inibig din niya.   Sa mga gabing tulad nito, niyakap ko siyang mahigpit at hinagkan sa lilim ng walang-hanggang langit.   Ako'y inibig niya, kung minsan siya'y inibig ko rin. Paanong hindi iibigin ang mga mata niyang malamlam?   Maisusulat ko ang pinakamalulungkot na tula ngayong gabi. Isipin lang: Hindi ko siya kapiling. Nawala siya sa akin.   Dinggin ang gabing malawak, mas malawak pagkat wala siya. At ang tula'y pumapatak sa diwa, parang hamog sa parang.   Ano ngayon kung di siya mapangalagaan ng aking pag-ibig? Ang gabi'y mabituin, at siya'y hindi ko kapiling.   Iyon lamang. Sa malayo, may umaawit. Sa malayo. Diwa ko'y hindi mapalagay sa kanyang pagkawala.   Anyong lalapit ang paningin kong naghahanap sa kanya. Puso'y naghahanap sa kanya, at siya'y hindi kapiling.   Ito ang dating gabing nagpaputi sa mga dating punongkahoy. Tayo, na nagmula sa panahong iyon, ay di na tulad ng dati.   Hindi ko na siya iniibig, oo, pero inibig ko siyang lubos. Tinig ko'y humalik sa hangin para dumampi sa kanyang pandinig.   Sa iba. Siya'y sa iba na. Tulad ng mga dati kong halik. Tinig, maningning na katawan. Mga matang walang-hanggan.   Hindi ko na siya iniibig, oo, pero baka iniibig ko siya. Napakaikli ng pag-ibig, at napakabata ng paglimot.   Pagkat sa mga gabing tulad nito'y niyakap ko siyang mahigpit, diwa ko'y di mapalagay dahil sa kanyang pagkawala.   Ito marahil ang huling hapding ipadarama niya sa akin, at ito na marahil ang huling tulang iaalay ko sa kanya.

      There were lazy mornings when I would wish I were filthy rich - ya know, someone with Gretchen Barreto's or Christina Gonzales's lifestyle.  Where life is made of 50% shopping/hanging out, 25% travel, 15% motherhood/wifeyhood, and only 10% pseudo career.  It's difficult to rise early, think of something to wear that maintains your boss's healthy heart, apply just the right amount of make-up so as not to scare the kids in the jeepney, and beat the morning rush.  Many times, I thought of giving up my regular job and just work at my own pace, call the shots.  Nope, no capital to set up and manage full-time a serious wedding consultancy/event management thingy.  Raket lang.  Part-time DI, part-time kundoktora, haha!  Seriously, before I even think about giving up this 8-5 events/writing/designing (and recently, training) thing, I want to get my hands on any flexible and good paying raket that asks me to do any or all of the following-again at my own pace: events / writing / designing / training.  Labo?  Hindi naman a.  I mean, I love what I do now.  I just don't like being timebound, wallbound, bossbound. He!

      Went on a mini-break with mi amore in Tagaytay last weekend.  While at it, we checked out the churches and some possible wedding reception venues there and in the nearer part of Batangas.  My fiancee, Jeff, a Bosconian, said there's a nice chapel with a view where they held a couple of retreats.  He suggested we go check out Chapel on the Hill in Don Bosco Retreat House in Batulao.  Feel in love with it!  It's a small, round chapel (could seat around 80 persons) in the midst of a small garden overlooking Taal volcano (or was that it?).  Am not sure, though, if they do weddings there.  Really hope they do.  Haven't heard of weddings held there so am still in doubt.  Then we went to the church of Transfiguration in Caleruega, a good 7-minute drive from Don Bosco, 30-40 minutes from Tagaytay Rotonda. Love this one, too!  Am a wedding planner but since am too tamad to do weddings farther than Tagaytay since I got full-time with Pioneer, it was my first time to visit the place.  This one's all in one talaga.  You can have your reception in any of its 4 or 5 reception venues depending on the number of guests.  You can also check in there too, a day before or after the wedding, for they offer detached rooms or family rooms (there's one that's good for 14 heads) so you don't need to find the nearest hotel for all your wedding prep.  Everything's within the church compound.  Then of course, the chapel (which can seat around 100).  Picture perfect, this place!  There are more advantages when you get married in Caleruega-except that your guests would find it far.  Don Bosco, on the other hand, only has the chapel-well, it's far just the same.   In Caleruega, though, all the schedules we wanted for next year were taken so would have to: a) think of another date b) look for another church c) pray Don Bosco allows weddings

      If there's anything I'm never good at, it's saying goodbye.  If there's a workshop on how to hold tears back or pretend not to be affected until I can run into a comfort room cubicle, I'd be the first one to sign up.  But well, there's the trade off of being transparent.  My officemate and a good friend, Yayie, is saying goodbye soon-well, at least to her seat beside me.  I am very, very happy for her, though, that she knows what she really wants, where and how to get it.  I am glad that there are people like her who go out of their way to find their happiness-in the context of work...err, pay? I testify that she has made the right choice and I wish her well.
