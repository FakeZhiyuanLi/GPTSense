       Today was hot... too hot. I was out in the sun all day, walking, lifting stuff, moving stuff, driving... yeah. Too much. Then I went to dinner with my dad, his girlfriend, and his renter. Well, as of tomorrow, his ex-renter, since Jim (that's his name) and his entire company was laid off, and he has no reason to stay here anymore since he won't have to commute to work every day. Anyway. I was discussing birthday plans with Aaron... Campana's, a movie, my dad's house. He'll be gone. And he has a good sound system. Weeeeeeeee...  -T

       1%: the amount of brake pad left on the rear drum. 5% remaining on the front. It's in the shop getting fixed as I type. That car is an endless moneyhole, I swear. Oh... well... my dad said that soon, he might give me his car, which happens to be a really nice one, too. He  only  has 6 vehicles himself.  Well, soon I'm off to my grandmother's place again, to get ready for the Moving Sale. If you have anything to add, email it.  -T

       I just got back from a friend of my mom's birthday party dinner. It was pretty good; it was at a Mexican restaurant. Except for one thing. There was a young gay guy there. I don't so much mind gay people, but this one was quite annoying. He  had  to be the center of attention, and acted very... weird. Like, frequently talking in a loud falsetto voice. Yeah. Anyways. Oh yes, and then, just as I was leaving (I was driving my grandmother's car, and my mom was driving the Lexus, because I met her down there and therefore we were driving different cars), well anyway, as I was leaving, I come to a stop at the stop sign as I leave the parking lot, and what do I hear? *crunch, crunch, grind, grind* Oh great, the breaks on&nbsp;her old beater are  really  going out now. I thought it was a little minor problem, but... well... I made it home in one piece, thankfully. Tomorrow it's time to bring it to Les Schwab for a liiiiiittle checkup. Anyways, enough said for tonight. I'm depriving Rachel of an attempted conversation.  -T

       Mmhmm... now I can post. Who'll read it, anyway? So stupid. Well today, I... practiced for a couple hours... then went up to my grandmother's house to start filling up my dad's truck for the dump. This weekend is the moving sale. Let's see... anything else? I am reading a new book now. Shadowfires, by Dean Koontz.&nbsp;It's pretty good. He's a good author. Lessee... I'm talking to Maureen now... well... nothing else to add here.  Tata for now.

       Hey,  Birch Bay was fun! I did nothing. Well, I went biking and mini-golfing, but that's it. My dad and I drove one of the girls (that we meet up there every year) home, and I talked to Aaron for what seemed like hours on the way back (it might have been). But mainly, it was just nice to get away for a few days. The next time I go on a road trip, I'm dragging Aaron along. He knows it, too.  -Tres

       She's coming home from the hospital today, finally. Bad side: she'll be living with us until we can sell her home.  I've been working a lot around her house: yesterday, my dad and I pressure washed the entire outside, including the deck, moved all the blackberry bushes from the back of the house, went up on the roof and cleaned it all off, and the roof to the deck. Today, I'm using a steam cleaner to clean the carpets. Her house is a long, double wide, 1700 square feet mobile home. Scrub scrub.

       Yo y'all,  Well, for those of you who don't know, my grandmother walked out of her house, barefoot, on Monday evening, after I had just seen her and gave her dinner. (I have had to go up there multiple times daily lately to take care of her, due to her rapid onset of dementia.) I had set the TV up so she could watch a video tape, leaving the TV on with the volume on low. Her kitchen lights were on (because it was getting dark out). I left as she was eating dinner.  I came up there the next morning (yesterday) to give her lunch, but found her door open and her missing. I noticed that the TV was untouched (with the volume on low still, and the movie unplayed) and her kitchen and bathroom lights were on. I searched the house, expecting her to be hiding somewhere from me (because of her memory loss, it's possible she forgot who I was), but I couldn't find her anywhere.  I called my mom, and she came up and again searched the house. We called all of her church friends and all of our relatives, but they hadn't heard from her or taken her out somewhere (to lunch, for example). We called the police and they said they'd send a deputy out. An hour later, he finally arrived. He went through the usual stuff, like asking us a million questions about where she'd been seen last and what she was wearing and such.  After she didn't turn up, we assumed she'd had another mini-stroke, got confused, and went off somewhere on foot. Within a few hours, Search and Rescue arrived with some bloodhounds, schnauzers, and beagles and took off searching. In the meantime, I went home with a photograph, scanned it in, and emailed it to the sheriff's office for the media to publish.  After I did that, I went door-to-door with a deputy all down this side of Noll Rd with a photograph, hoping someone'd seen her. As it turns out, nobody had, except one lady who came over before we went door-to-door and said she'd seen someone the last night at about 11:30, barefoot, wearing a light-colored shirt going up Noll Rd about a mile from my grandmother's place. At the time, she didn't think anything of it and kept driving. By this morning at 3AM, they'd found nothing. Throughout the entire search, the dogs never went as far as she was.  At 8:30 this morning they resumed searching, now that the rescue workers had daylight. A total of about 10 more scent-sniffing dogs were given a whiff of something that had my grandmother's scent on it, but they never found the right path. In addition, some other workers had cleared out a bunch of brush around the house to see if she'd made it in there, somehow.  At about 4:30, just as they'd cleared out a large area -- and I was standing with them --, the base (which was located at the Poulsbo JR High) called for all rescue groups to come in, because the "subject was found". That was surprising to me, just to hear that. As soon as that group left for base, the phone rang, being from one of the detectives. He said that she was found just off of Lincoln Rd, about 2.5 miles away from her home, next to a power pole, in the blackberry bushes, calling for help. A guy who lived nearby (since the place she stopped at happened to be nearby a housing development) heard her calls, got a buddy to help him get her out of there, and called 911. She had apparently been sleeping there for two nights.  The EMS team took her to Harrison Hospital in Silverdale, where she had some tests done and they were able to clean her up (she has scratches from head to toe due to all the blackberry bushes she'd stumbled through). She is still very confused, and she claims she has only been gone for a couple hours out blackberry picking. She is dehydrated, has many major bruises, has an infection in her leg, has some muscle damage from sitting for two days in a bad position, and she may have a broken hip and/or leg. At least she's alive.  Now that we know that she's prone to "walking", as they call it, she'll be staying at my house (which has a deadbolt which requires a key from either side) until we can sell her property and move her into Assisted Living. Tomorrow, I'll be going up there with my mom to see her, before I have to be back here for a business meeting with a friend.  Anyways, I'm tired, having only gotten 3.5 hours of sleep last night, so, good night for now!

       Well, I'm taking a break from it. Yay for me! I'm not as lazy as I thought I am. Or maybe I am.  *Stares at computer*  *Stares harder*  I dunno what to say.  Tres

       What is it about them? They all involve "love" and they always get married at the end. I mean, I just saw 13 Going On 30, and it was pretty good, and then, at some point, it just got ridiculous. The ending plain  sucked . This  whole  movie,  building  up,  building  up,  building  up, and then: it's over. That's right, no plot twists, no surprises, it's just OVER. I could have written it myself (but I probably would have made it more entertaining, like have one of the characters suddenly have a heart attack). Anyway, that's not the only reason I have mixed feelings about chick flicks. Being of the romantic type, that I  do  enjoy the emotional feelings being brought out by the "love story" (even though I hate want to admit it, fearing I'll get marked as being a pathetic loser; but, on the other hand, who cares what people think), however, I was bored out of my mind with all the hocus-pocus going on. Halfway through the movie, I started to go insane. Just stick to the basic story line! AHH!  Anyway, that's enough of a rant on chick flicks. Now I stuck in my Queen DVD, which is my new favorite thing to watch. It plain sucks that they don't have  The Show Must Go On  or  Who Wants to Live Forever  on it, but the other songs are suitable. They do a great job on  We Will Rock You, Another One Bites the Dust,  and  Bohemian Rhapsody . Although I don't care that the lead singer ends up with just a pair of shorts on by the end of the concert, I think it's super.  I didn't practice today. I need to practice. I need to practice. UGHAHHGRRHUMPHAARGHDIEDIEDIE. Just had to get that out of me.  At least Aaron was on tonight. We talked until about 12 before he went to bed. He was feeling pretty crappy, so I guess that's a good enough excuse.  Anyways, one more relaxing dose of  Bohemian Rhapsody  and I'm outta here.  Tschüss!

       Yo Ya'll,  I'm in a coffee shop in downtown Poulsbo with Aaron, using our laptops (they're parallel from each other), drinking hot chocolate, and eyeing two extreamly... gifted-looking girls from across the cafe, who happen to be returning our "casual" gazes...  Last night, Aaron, Lee, and I stayed up watching Caddyshack and Men In Black. Before that, we had a great dinner at Campana's and saw I, Robot with Merrilee. I liked that movie. Dang. The girls just left. They walked past my table very slowly.  Anyway, I had a great birthday! Thank you Merrilee, Aaron, Lee, and my dad and his girlfriend Pat!

       Today was a day. I got up (which my dad congradulated me on), I went to Bremerton, I emailed a future prof and got an 8-worded reply, and I watered a lawn. And got swiped at by a mad bunny. eehRRRRRRRRREReeeeeerrrrrrrrrr.......  I moved a desk. 10 times. Well, that's what I get for picking a blonde mom. In-de-ci-sive.  And now, dinner and a hungry bunny calls.  Tata

       OMG... it's a post. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever. I should be emailing people. I have two emails I have yet to reply to. Grr. What's wrong with me?  Well anyway. Right now I'm talking to Adam. A friend of my ex's. He's cool, even though he doesn't share the same passion of dragging your butt out of bed every day and slaving away to school. Well, on second thought, who does? I guess I'm just weird. But, what else is new.  Oh. I just remembered something. Oh. I just remembered another thing. Oh, maybe I should say what they are. First thing: I GOT A QUEEN DVD TODAY! Ok. Second thing: Aaron, being as much of a dork as he can be, is not going to Birch Bay with me, because he will miss a whole three days of PIANO PRACTICE. Ok, I'm pretty set with my piano and stuff, but, c'mon, three days for a  vacation?  Whatever. Oh, and not to fall under the usual stand of being all negitave, I GOT A QUEEN DVD TODAY!  Birthday party. Umm. On the 5th. Nobody's invited, at least nobody that'll read this. We're meeting at an undisclosed time at some undisclosed place. "We" is hereby defined has somebody or somebodys.  School. I want it to start. Now. I need a social life. Sorry, Merrilee, but feeding your bunny isn't good enough. I think he wants to bite me, anyway. I stroked his ears. Uhh. Then I backed away and just fed him. And your plants are still alive. That's a good thing. I took my grandmother for a drive today, too, which involved stopping at your place. (Pauses to remind self that this is not a personal email.)  Grandmother. AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Desk. I got a new one.  Bill Cosby. I'm reading "Cosbyology".  Bed. It calls.  -Tres
