          Corridors Of Blood  I set in my corridors all by myself with my razorblade in hand I take it against my flesh the blood drips to the floor forming a puddle. Locked away yet delightfully happy I cut myself for the fun for the thrill Hundreds of times have I done this yet somehow I am still alive. Being left alone by myself for so long I start to wonder what is real, Are theses creatures and strange things I see a part of my dreams or reality? I hear footsteps approaching my door what do them loons want of me? I am not ill; I have no problems it is they who should be locked in here. My only want is to chop off their heads after feeding them their torn out insides I shudder at this thought and feel remorse for what I have come to. Once again I take the razor against my skin and feel the blood trickle down, The room around me starts to grow faint and blurry. The light I see it yes very clear to me I walk towards the light, For I wonder what is in store for me past it what wonders I will run intoFinally I am set free of the hell I have been kept in for so long.
