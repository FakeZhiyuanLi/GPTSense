      I've spent the last few years trading muscle mass for computer time. Ooops! So, I joined a health club last week as part of a big lifestyle change. I'm pretty attracted to the idea of having energy all day long. On my first day, I had an assessment during which I was flooded with memories of the grade school Presidential fitness exam. I still rock at the sit-and-reach, but I was surprised to find that I also rock at sit-ups and I set a new club record for lung capacity. All that to say, I'm weak and weight training is my new best friend.   They also have a great locker room which brings me to the universal question: Why is there always the one guy in the men's locker room who likes to walk around naked? And why does he always have flabby butt cheeks? Do you know, Internet? Which one of you is  that guy ? Did you forget that you were naked? Did you want to show off your lack of self consciousness, or is it about intimidation, like standing in someone's personal space? WHY?

      My pride forces me to write this disclaimer, since I so despise Internet trends.  However, I am making this concession in order to submit to my  urlLink wife  who is teaching me to be more approachable (please, don't tell me if it's working or not).  Incidentally, I'm teaching her how to be ruder at the appropriate times.  Anyway, I don't expect this blog to last long, but while it does, I hope that you, dear Internet, will in some way come to know me as well as I already know you.

      The rest of the  urlLink disciples  were outside taking a look at my new  urlLink chopper .  Check out that kick-ass kick-stand.  Soooo cooool!

      Being that I am an  urlLink INFP , it is my sad lot to wrestle with the big questions of life.  Notice, I call them the big questions-- that's what an INFP is supposed to think, and I do.  99% of people are not INFPs, but you can still come along for fun and pretend with me that this is important to your daily life.  The question that I've latched onto from an early age has centered on the nature of belief. I was raised in a Christian setting and was coming up swimmingly until a wild event occurred.  My mother had gone with a friend for the day down to farm nearby where a  urlLink woman claimed to be receiving visitations from the Virgin Mary .  One was scheduled for noon on this particular Saturday.  My mom was a skeptic of course, but it was nearby and seemed like a fun, relaxing way to spend the day.  There were over a thousand people there, so they went off by themselves to walk in the country-side.  It was a beautiful day; they set up lawn chairs, took a few pictures, and decided to just hang out and enjoy the country. Well, as fate would have it, the picture that they took at noon came out special.  It was a Polaroid of the sun with a large ancient door over it.  The door was translucent with large iron hinges, and most remarkably a keyhole that was half as tall as the door itself and positioned in the center of the lower half.  In the keyhole was a robed figure (a man I think) who was walking through it toward the sun. They fell to their knees in tears.  After returning, telling the story, and showing the evidence, I was convinced. Raised as a Catholic, there was no real reason to be freaked out, but I was temporarily transformed.  Belief had entered the realm of reality and shaken me to my feet. I returned to my school armed with the photo and ready to blow people away; as you know, Internet, no one was impressed.  WHY!?  Being another step removed from the source made it an urban legend, just a story surrounding a quirky photo, a guy trying to make a fool out of those who would be taken in.  So many people have multiple belief sets.  We believe that stepping in front of a speeding vehicle will kill us, and we act accordingly.  Perhaps, we also believe that Jesus is the son of God, yet we live the same as atheists.  Some beliefs are automatic, others are an act of will.  How do we live according to ALL of our beliefs? The main problem is that we sleepwalk through most of our lives. The vast majority of our days are spent on autopilot, doing the next thing, making the usual decisions, and being held in place by the same fears.  I've identified three ways of coping:  1) If you basically don't care, turn to  urlLink page 239 .  2) If you think we need to stop sleepwalking and live in the "present moment" all the time, then turn to  urlLink page 18 ; and when you give up on that idea, try reading the  urlLink Bhagavad Gita .  Then if you, one way or the other, come to the conclusion that this is only possible full-time for a hermit on his 77th reincarnation cycle, try coming back and reading on from here.  3) If you think that we need to somehow improve our sleepwalking, by training ourselves step by step with the intention of converting belief into knowledge (this is more or less why I got a four-year degree in acting), then come with me to future post, "A Practical Guide to the Art of Sleepwalking" on  urlLink page 178 .

      My wife and I made a pact recently--actually it's more of a competition--in which I have to take over the world and she has to become a fitness instructor. It's a little lopsided maybe, but we set our own goals and we've agreed to them. "Taking over the world" in this case implies developing an operating system that will replace Windows, Linux, MacOS, etc. That's right. Welcome to the next, next level. I have created a blog with the my new OS as the SRD ( urlLink acronym developed by mymo ). You may  urlLink follow the thought process  that goes into the development of such an OS if you dare.

      After my recent success renovating my kitchen, it seemed like a great idea to sell my house, then run out and do it all over again. To make it a real challenge though, we've cut the budget by 90%. This leaves roughly $1,000 to build up the floor, put in a new subfloor and laminate, re-route plumbing and ventilation, double the cabinet space, add a dishwasher, replace the outside door, and paint everything. I've been collecting free items to help in this, but it will be tight.  I started removing the old cabinets yesterday. One of the screws got stuck while taking a big one down; the head stripped out and bent over, utterly rejecting my poor drill. I got so frustrated that I tried to pry the screw out with my hammer. It didn't budge, but the hammer did and the cabinet did. In fact, the back face of the cabinet is still hanging on the wall as we speak, and my hammer is nodding in effigy of the stolid screw.  So I gave up and proceeded with sanding the finish off the cabinets I already have. This gives me great pleasure. One moment I'm staring at an ugly old cabinet, then minutes later it emerges from its cocoon of dust with long beautiful blonde hair, er, wood. I love the smell and look of raw wood just waiting for me to paint or stain it.  Actually, what I find most rewarding about this whole renovation process is cleanliness. For some reason, a rental dwelling just feels dirty after so many years, no matter how much cleaning you do. We've scrubbed the old cabinets several times now with all sorts of cleaners, but they're still sticky and grimy. I ripped up the floor a few years ago and put down new vinyl tile, but the ookiness seems to have oozed up from the floor boards. There's no way to get rid of it, except to get rid of it-- sand the surface off, replace the subfloor and baseboards, paint everything. I can't wait; it will actually feel clean. I won't mind my children crawling on the floor, or touching the cabinets.

      Well, I officially ran out of work last week. I've been spear-heading a large development project for the past two years or so. Recently, I stumbled into a $40,000 expense and warned the appropriate people, but nobody took me seriously until I sent out an email saying that all development was on hold. By some very frequent coincidence, all decision makers were on holiday, and so I've been idle for over a week. (When I say  idle , I mean learning cool work related stuff on the Internet.) However, word got out to the IT director a few days ago, and behold, her pile of annoying trivial tasks fell upon my shoulders.  I guess it would be inappropriate to complain about having to do work at work, but ... well ... nevermind. So I set about checking one after the other of her unfinished tasks off my list with all the speed I could muster. I always try to impress people when I actually  enter  the office. I fixed hard-to-track-down bugs in spreadsheets, adjusted accounting reports, made Y2K updates (there really were Y2K bugs-- I thought it was a joke), and even learned a new, yet somehow useless computer language.  The real treasure, however, was the response I got from the locals. "Wow, did you just wave your magic wand over Josh's pricing spreadsheet?" Josh had no luck for eight months, but I fixed it within an hour of coming in. "It's what I do," I try to say in all humility, as if I hadn't just worked like a madman to leave this mysterious and awe-filled perception. Their meager requests for help in the mind boggling world of computer errors have gone unanswered for so long. Then I come to town and make it all better by wiggling my nose. I can do no wrong, just keep quiet and collect the adoration.  Perhaps this is ridiculously arrogant, but it keeps my job fun. I accidentally cultivated a folk hero status, and now I must maintain it whenever the opportunity arises.

       Last weekend, El Fid and I celebrated the third anniversary of our second wedding. We took a trip to downtown Cincinnati to celebrate near my parents who were kind enough to provide two nights of babysitting for all three boys. We stayed at the Westin overlooking Fountain Square-- it was very nice, but I must wonder if granite countertops and down pillows are worth the extra money. Oh, wait, it was free, complements of the Internet. Thank you, Internet. We spent our first night just relaxing with some Mediterranean food, trying to get the crying-baby-panic-reflex out of our systems, and then slept like royalty on our Heavenly  TM   beds.  Kate's funeral was Saturday morning-- a 9am layout followed by a Catholic mass at 11am. We drove up in the morning for the service. It was very cool to see so many old friends. Kate did not look like Kate, of course. She had no facial expression, and I have never seen Kate with no expression. The hardest part of the funeral was the casket being brought in followed by Kate's sister and two brothers. I didn't understand the minister at all; his sentence structure was so convoluted and meaningless that he might as well not have spoken. However, her father shared a very nice remembrance afterward, and then I went out to Perkins with friends. There was supposed to be about seven of us, but over forty showed up. Many memories were refreshed and two legends confirmed-- the ghost and the cult (see below). I was told that Kate talked of me a lot and really loved me. I had a nice time, and afterwards got to introduce my kids to some of my old friends.  That night El Fid and I went gambling for something different; she has already written  urlLink a good account of that . Then on our way back to the hotel we stumbled upon my brother-in-law standing on the corner drinking a cup of coffee. So we stopped and chased him down. He had been riding his motorcycle around and saw his wife's (my sister's) car, so he stopped to find her. I looked up and there she was photographing some rich people's wedding in front of the fountain downtown. So we hung out for a while, then she had to run off to photograph the reception. Oh, and earlier that afternoon, we had some of  urlLink the most deadly ice-cream known to man .   THE GHOST:  In my high school there was an urban legend about two star-crossed lovers who were sneaking off to elope. They were to meet at an old tree on a country road and begin their new life together, but as these stories go, there was a motorcycle accident and they both died. On every anniversary at midnight, the motorcycle lights were said to be seen coming down the road and a woman running out to meet it.  So, we decided to drive out to the location on the appropriate night and investigate. Mostly everyone hung out at the car talking, but Kate and I went walking off alone. We often walked deserted roads at night, talking, and sometimes just listening to the night noises. Tonight was like many others, except as we were walking we began to hear a whimpering noise. We were not scared at first, just curious. "What is that?" As we progressed however, it grew louder into a ragged whine. Was it an animal? We glanced all about but didn't see anything. There were some woods nearby, but it wasn't coming from there. It seemed to be right on top of us. It became a snarling noise in our ears. "Do you see that?" Kate asked. In the distance, coming out of the woods a woman could be faintly seen. She cast a blue tint on the otherwise deserted road. We stopped, turned, looked each other in the eyes, and took off running back to the car screaming. Everyone caught on, and we were driving off in short order.   THE CULT:  Kate and I were always looking for interesting things to do. Well, we noticed that every Thursday night at a grave yard near our houses, a large crowd gathered. There was a small chapel on the grounds, which was reminiscent of classic scary graveyards with iron fences and odd little gargoyles. The thing that captured our imagination was the huge number of cars which totally clogged the driveway compared to the smallness of the chapel that they crammed themselves into. We began referring to them as The Cult.  One night after a few cups of coffee we decided to invite ourselves in. We would pose as newlyweds interested in attending services. So we pulled in as they were starting, walked up to the door and knocked. No answer. We knocked louder. In answer came the silhouettes of the hunched over occupants at the two windows. They were peaking out at us. So we knocked again. We were never greeted, but they yelled at us, so we left disappointed leaving them with a classy remark, like: "What are you? Some kind of cult?!"  Well, that was high school.

      I'm really tired and confused about all this and maybe a bit angry.  It hurts to write about the sweet memories, but here goes.  Kate lived with a magical perspective on life; all things held wonder for her.  She knew no limitations, but always strove passionately for whatever she was seeking.  Her enthusiasm was contagious.  She had a way of making friends with people from all walks of life, in any circumstance.  She had no regard for the norm, but broke it without seeming to even notice, intent on her passion.  She was a lover, always running madly after art of all varieties: music, painting, writing, acting.  At the age of six, she lost her Latvian mother whom she totally adored, and who represented a life journey to Kate.  She would often dream about her mother guiding her, and when she followed it would end with a big reunion of music-- they would play violin together on the grave where her mother was buried.  Kate was always struggling to get control over herself, to follow what she perceived was her mother's voice, and dedicate herself to her art.  Kate had myriad plans, but usually returned to the idea of moving in with her aunt, far from all the distractions that kept her down, and trying to paint seriously.  We spent endless hours in coffee shops and crappy all night restaurants discussing our dreams, our struggles and hopes, what the future would hold, and what the past meant.  Once we put on an improv play for an audience of waitresses at Perkins.  We shot a lot of pool.  She taught me what little guitar I know.  We wrote poems together, read aloud to each other (sometimes at the same time with different books).  We occasionally drove out into the country at night and took random turns until we were good and lost, then got out walked about, looked at the stars, or just sat and listened to bullfrogs.  We went to concerts together (which included sneaking backstage and meeting the band).  I went to a few too many pot parties with her, but I always had a good time despite my anti-drug stance.  I was a straight-laced kid hanging out with the "bad crowd," but that's where I found the most real community.  They were a refreshingly humble group compared to most high-school groups.  Every Friday before school, at about 6AM, we'd get together at Perkins or Denny's for breakfast.  There was usually more than ten of us there; it was really good times.  I miss that camaraderie. Unfortunately, I've kept in contact with none of them, but I'll be reuniting again Saturday morning.  I'm a little nervous but looking forward to it.

      I was checking email tonight before bed, and I noticed interspersed with the spam, a message from Bryan Paul Inderhees. I couldn't quite figure out who that was, but it evoked memories of trivia club long ago-- was it college or high school? The message was marked with a digital signature and titled, "Sorry to be the bearer of bad news..." I delayed opening it while I read other messages, trying in the back of my head to figure out what bad news this guy could have for me; I could barely even remember who he was. Finally, I opened it:  "A friend named Eric is trying to get in touch with you, so I looked up your address in the Case directory."  A quick mental scan produced a few Erics. I began to realize that it was bad news, bad enough that someone would track me down to tell me. I saw myself on film, all of sudden. I followed the link he had responded to.  "A mutual friend of ours died suddenly today"  It was Eric from high school drama, who I hung out with several nights a week for a few years. Who was the mutual friend? My one and only ex-girlfriend? I did some searches, and came across, Eric's blog; three entries about death in the past day. Scanning... scanning... No. It was Kate. Katie-Mae. Katja. Dead. My chest tightened up, surprised and not surprised in so many ways.  I feel a need to write about Kate because I feel much sadder about this than I would have expected. I met Kate during my early days in the Roger Bacon drama guild. We were auditioning for a show-- she showed up late, slouching in some low slung plumber jeans, a white T-shirt, and a denim cap pulled down too low, her light brown pony tail sticking through the back. I noticed her first when she shrieked loud and crazy with glee and took off bounding across the auditorium towards some innocent bystander, then lunged into a grand embrace. I didn't like her.  I have no recollection of how we got to being such good friends, but I must explain to my readers that Kate was nearly my opposite in every way. She was short, extroverted, gay, failing out of school, doing and selling lots of drug, etc. We hung out nearly every day. I've never really understood our friendship. My mother theorizes that I was trying to rescue her, but I don't think that was the case. Well, admittedly I was hoping that I could influence her to quit with the self-destructive habits. I did influence her some. She gave it all up and restored her relationship with her step-mother; I even went with her to AA meetings for a while. She went back to her old ways after a few months, but I found out that since I last heard from her about 6 years ago, she got cleaned up and was doing really well selling  urlLink paintings  like hotcakes somewhere in California. Then she died.  Since last talking to Kate, I've often wondered if she was in a gutter or still alive even, or if I might run into her in a bookstore somewhere. I've somewhat resented her for disappearing. She traveled like a vagrant making it very difficult to keep up with her. But, I've been sitting here in Cleveland for the past eight years. I wanted her to find me and tell me how life was going-- I guess I missed her, even though I also cynically referred to her as my lesbo druggie friend of old. I must admit, I've been keeping an eye open for Kate all these years. Maybe, I'll get to see her this weekend in Cincy. *sniff* She's the kind of friend, I was just saying I wanted.  Perhaps, I'll write some more later, after I talk to Eric-- I'm still a bit shocked.

      As I sit here at the computer in a state of rarely felt loneliness, I find myself faced with a critical decision (only critical in blog land): Should I use this here blog for good or for awesome? In other words, should I post a string of editorial style discourse, or should I be a little braver and write about things that are important to me without trying overly hard to be witty or to entertain you-- who are you anyway?  I think the reason I started this blog was "for awesome"-- it sure is tempting to bail on that idea. I used to journal faithfully, but sort of gave it up when I got married. Having my own personal person seemed like it made journaling pointless, but now I'm interested in starting that process up again. I also want my friends to know me better, if they dare to follow my ramblings. So, I'll try to bare my soul for commentary; you are also welcome to comment, Internet, if you really are out there.  Sadly, this feeling of loneliness is already passing. It hurts, but I also cherish it. As my wife could tell you, I really want friends about once every two months, and the rest of the time I don't much seem to care if people like me or not. Objectively speaking, I find this very depressing, since it leads to a yucky end result where I have no community and live outside of the abundance that God offers. I only seem to realize this acutely on nights like tonight, but I know that it's true the rest of the time too. The other bad part is that I don't have a clue how to get from point A (sporadic loneliness) to point B (building solid friendships). Actually, I must give my wife props here, she throws some clues my way, but they usually seem too awkward for me. Whenever I do try to make an attempt it invariably fizzles out, and everyone seems happy to let it. I guess I'm just very easily discouraged. I wish I knew Joe from the movie  urlLink The Station Agent , someone intent on being my best friend no matter what. More likely, God is trying to teach me how to be a friend. Friendship is after all a quintessential characteristic of the Trinity, and we are invited into that communion with God.
