      By now you should know about what i am going to write... all the no good ones here. yeah   (starting from thursday nite)    After coming from that film shooting at sentosa, which ended at 11:30pm, i reached home at around 1 in the morning. Tired and sleepy, I went to do my homework. I forced my self to do so. I finished everthing at around 5 in the morning had only a few minutes of sleep. Once i woke up, cranky and really super tired, i took a bath and got ready for school.     When i came to school, Syariff (the class chairperson) said that the dance practice will be at the class room, the main reason is that he don't want to go out and coz he has a small dance battle with the next class. Thats the first last minute change. During silent reading period, at the parade square, my form teacher called me and talked to me about the class. Yeah something like counsiling.     He asked me about my life, how is the class and blah blah blah. In bio class, my bio teacher asked us to do the Ten year series as usual i always finish the assignment first cause i am the top student in bio class. Than she told me that there is no prize and apologised, that was the second last minute change. During Geo class my teacher asked us to line up at the parade square. I brought along the letter that the director passed to those dancers who did not attend anything in school or what ever. I showed it to her and she say ok i am excused from the punishment. Got back to class leaving 9/10 of the class under the hot sun.    There were only 12 students in Geo class. We did study. Than after Geo was English banded. I went for my banded class, just next door (Eng Band A). Mr Bruce told everyone that he will show a movie but he did not instead he asked us to do a lame quiz, the third one, than while we did the quiz he went to get our eng files. When he came back, he asked me to take the ones that are from my class so i did... Suddenly he took it back and said never mind i ask Syariff to pass it, that was the FOURTH!.     Recess time came. Ok after i eat i always walk around. I went back to the canteen and talked to my teacher after that i quickly stood up and bumped into Kok Siang. He hold me by my arms and my hand we on his chest. He blushed. I let go and turned away from him.     Maths lesson was next after recess. We received a new time table AGAIN, thats the Fifth one!. I was not turned down in maths lesson cause i was bored and did not care much. Than after school, I got irritated of waiting for some people. There is this girl, she left her bag in school and left the school with out letting me know. She did not came back after that, that was the sixth!. During the break i went to Syariff and said to him to FUCK THAT BITCH OFF THE GROUP! He kept asking me why... i just repeated the words i said THREE TIMES. If i say FUCK OFF once means a warning, it is three times means REALLY REALLY FUCK OFF!     Than i went back home at around 5 plus. I fell asleep once i lyied down on my bed. Woke up by a phone call. It was Him. He told me he couldn't go to the concert, if he goes he has to ask roy to call his father, that was the seventh!. Than i got irritated cause i have been turned down 7 times in one day. I had a good sleep. I am totally having an alter-ego in me. AH! FUCK! My schedule is so tight now!    After that i went out and talked a bit to him on the phone than put down. i went to west mall while on the journey i broke into tears and this guy came up to me and asked me if i was alright but i did not answer but at least he gave me a packet of tissue. Than i went home after a long walk, i went to the roof of my block and sat there. Than i went for another walk... when i went back to my block i feel uneasy and all of a sudden this guy hold me up. I thanked him and i went home.. and than now... here i am writing this blog. Haiz... FUCK!

      A nightmare woke up. Just in time to put up my long winded poem and get ready to go out with my new friends from Teater Variasi. Yeah, I got in to Teater Variasi and i will be acting in the new production...oh Ssshhhh! i must not tell the detail yet haha!. I was really excited cause its the first time i am doing something with Variasi. Well after i took a shower, i went to update my bloggy with that long winded poem. Than my sis woke up and rushed to the toilet. She forced me to rush cause we are late. Well we are late, Its not my fault.  In the train, Hamzah, Variasi's chairman kept smsing me asking my sis and i to hurry up. Well we can't hijack the train. Once we reached our destination, Paya Lebar Mrt Station, Hamzah, Hannah aka Annah and Khai (Hamzah's lil bro). We waited for a van to arrive and pick us up. Once the van arrived, we laughed alot in the van cause Khai and Hamzah we like the jokers. Our destination, a scene to be taken for a new TV SERIES on Channel I... We are the dancers so what me on TV hor!, was at this place and it has already started raining. Like WHAT! dance in the rain!? I was wearing this souless shoe so my feet got  INSTANTLY WET ! AH! and yes many dancers got yet too. There, a few other new friends from Variasi have already arrived first. Yannah and Niezam (Ppl call him Saiful or Zam but i call him by his name hahah donno why.) Well I know Yannah quiet well cause we both are quiet friendly but i rarely talk to Niezam but now hahaha We are like a couple, i'll get to that point later in the entry haha.  The Director gave us an apron and two soggy breads! Most of us wore the apron and i was like disgusted, but yet hungry, with the soggy bread. The director showed us how to dance and yes its very easy. Most of us thought it was going to be really a tough one but oh well. Once we danced perfectly, took a couple of shots to make it perfect, Most of the dancers, including other ppl, went into the van. We all squeezed into the van, i had to sit on the floor with Niezam sitting on my lap. For the whole journey, i and a few others, including Niezam of course... he so cute!, we like talking and i was the one making the jokes, with Niezam sitting on my lap and me holding him as if he and i are together, i told Yannah that Niezam is my son and everyone laughed. Suddenly there was a big bump on the road causing most of us to like jump up, Niezam's head hit the ceiling of the van and his butt jumped up and landed on my crotch. Shocked... but the strangest thing is that he did not mind. Yes! we reached our destination at last and this means that my legs are free! hahah. We ended up at a bakery shop which sells lots of expensive and good qualities of pastries and cheese cakes.  We waited in the baker shop for a  VERY VERY LONG TIME . We waited for the crew, We waited for the Director. We even waited for the actors and actresss. Once they came, an hour later, the director asked us to wait at the coffee shop till one of the crew contacts Hamzah. Well yes we waited, for two whole hours, Khai got fed-up he asked us all dancers to go to the bakery shop and asked us to wait there instead at the coffe shop. The camera man stopped us than his helper said that we are in luck. We have lunch, lunch at 4pm!? i had not eaten from morning and ate a carbohydrated food at 4pm!? walau so long. It was nasi briyani and rendang beef... man! its super spicy till everyone can't take it. Khai, who finished first, asked us if anyone need him to buy water or not...  LIKE DUH! OF COURSE! . Once everyone is done.. we were called in to do the FINAL shooting. Thank god! Well the part was that we all had to move our heads from left to right a few times, MAN! causing me to have my neck strained!. After everything is over there was a little short breifing about the next shooting which is still this week but on Thursday! From 11am till 11:30pm @ SENTOSA! hahah. Well i decided to go but a little later since i have school and i am not going for band on that day :P. After school i straight go back home and change than go to Sentosa... Island Life! Love it! hahah :P and yes its free entry for us!   After the shooting, We all decided to go to City Hall and chill out at the Esplanade. Once we reached the place, we firstly went toilet hahaha than waited for my sis. Once done we went to esplanade. Some of us are still hungry so we stopped by 7-Eleven and bought a few snacks. I bought two potato chips, a peach with green tea drink and a chocolate bar. I shared the chocolate bar with Niezam, the rest didn't want it what so i share with him lor. Than the Yannah and Hannah started to couple up so hahaha i sacarsticly said,"Eh i jealous lah. OH yeah! Niezam you can be my partner yeah?".. and he agreed. From that on we hold hands put our arm around each other's waist just for fun and "promote" the new production hahaha. Once we reached Esplanade, Niezam and I decided to be super gays well many did not look at us but we got a few cheers from a few gay couples. Haha. After a long rest at the Esplanade, oh yeah Afi joined along too. We went to the MERLION. We said that the Merlion was cursed by the Black witch for accusing her being a bitch till Ms Merlion got separated, the Husband Merlion at Sentosa, Ms Merlion and Lil son Merlion here at the main island Singapore hahaha. We laughed but it ended for a while when the rain came AGAIN.  Ah! HUJAN! hahah. From there we walked towards the underground path to Fullerton Hotel. Well the whole journey, I and Niezam became like gay boys who are together haha. Niezam being the gentleman asked for my hand and he put my arm like it was like a hand bag ahahah. We walked around attracted attention. We took photo together. We got out of the Hotel and went to walk along Boat Quay (pronounced as Boat Key). We made a pit stopped at Macdonalds and bought a drink, again i shared with Niezam. We started our journey from the starting line of Boat Quay with the gay boys, me and Niezam, holding hands and Hannah and Afi holding hands. Many gave us a stare but fuck hell. Than at the end of the road this pub gerl came up to Hannah and asked if she could have the balloon that she is having than she apologised. We walked passed her, i and Niezam are still holding hands. Than the lady shouted,"EH GUYS AND GUYS CANNOT HOLD HANDS! YOU TWO GAY AH!?".. and i shouted back "WE ARE BESTFIENDS LAH! EVEN IF WE ARE GAY, WE NEVER MADE YOUR PARENTS LIFE DIFFICULT RIGHT!?" than she kept quiet.. we never saw her... Me and Niezam gave a Hi-Five to each other hahah. Than i let go of Niezam and told him that i hate this kind of people cause me being really open minded and a Homosexual Activist is not a fuss to make. Than he like agreed. He like did not care lah. I think he accepted me being an Activist but i donno if he can accept me being GAY. haha. Well from than on we did not hold hands.  In the train ride home. The gang and i were like entertainers. We made a few people laugh. We acted and made lots of jokes. Hahah i my self couldn't stand it... i laughed too but i got too tired so i decided to just watch them too with Niezam. All of the sudden Niezam fell asleep haha like so cute! with those pimples on his face... which makes him cuter really!.. than he lyied down on my shoulder. And there goes again another scene people laugh. We were like Live entertainers. hahah! I and Niezam are the gay couples, Hannah and Afi were the strike coupls, Hamzah and Khai were like two deaf ppl. Hahah... Well Afi went home first than me... OH! for your information... Niezam is Straight and has a girl friend but he is really open-minded. I have no intention to like be with him ok. Well till here than hahaha SO LONG! hahah well bye bye.

       Misery.  Flashes of dark memories return. I was raped by a Mad Man. I was molested by a Horny Guy. I was cruised and searched by a Devil. They changed my life to the worst. I couldn't think, eat, sleep, talk, walk, do anything properly. Their touch are very sinful. Its painful. I cannot sleep at night without HIM saying good night to me. Afraid to be touched by someone else. Raped, Molested, Searched, Mad Man, Horny Guy, Devil, Carpark, Toilet, A Dark Corner. Is he going to save me from this Dark and Deep hole full Misery? What am i suppose to do with this Knife stuck in my head, which goes in deeper everytime i think of IT. Will i die slowly and peacefully being POSITIVE? What is their next move? Am i going to be hunt down till they make the worst out of me? What is HE going to do, to help me? Injustice. Fear, Pain, Misery. Flashes of the worst memories are repeating in my head, blinding me. I can't take it anymore! Life is stupid, True love is nonsense when one is lost. Whats the true meaning of LIFE? Whats the true meaning of TRUE LOVE? Am i going to be mentally disabled after what had happened to me? Fear, Pain, Misery. Injustice. I can't remember what happened to me. Fainted on the staircase. Lost a bit of my memory, i think. Received an e-mail from HIM. I had hurt him. I broke the biggest promise that i made from the day we met. Will he come back to me, after what i have done and gone through and the sins i made? Is he going to ignore me for now or forever? I can't forgive my self, I hurt him too much. I hurt him. I hurt him. His feelings. My pain. I hurt him. I hurt him. He hates me now. He hates me forever. UGH! AH! too much pain. - Avoid me now, Avoid me forever. I am the BEAST whom Beauty is ignoring. Why am i born as the Beast? I am suppose to be DEAD! after what i have done. I hurt, kill, murder! Hurt the childrens, Kill the innocents, Murder the cupids. I am suppose to be BURNT INTO ASHES by the villages with BEAUTY either laughing at me for what i have done or crying for no reason. In reality, To get his blessings of forgiveness NOW is to really burn myself into ashes and let the wind blow me away freely. Than i think He will forgive me, for my sins, for my wrong doings, for the trouble i have brought him in. I did not bring him into New Heights Of Adventure. Reason to why i wanted him is that i want to bring him into NEW HEIGHTS OF ADVENTURES and make his life colourful but it seems i am the Jink that prevents him from going to new heights, the bleach that removes the colours. Is this the destination FAITH have shown me? Am i going to be a LONER in life AGAIN? I have no one else but HIM to turn to everytime but now he is doesn't want me to turn to him. I have no one now. LIFE DEPRESSION SUCKS FUCK! PAIN!!! RAPED MOLESTED SEARCHED CRUISED PAIN!!! ALONE   -----------------------------------------------------------------

       Mourning is such hard work. You want to cry but you don't want to be unglam. And what do you wear to your friend's wake if you have to go to a club after that?  The Death of someone special causes a group of friends to re-examine their lives and their feelings about death. Fundamental questions are asked: Will i go to hell if i'm a bitch? Am I spending too much time at the Gym? Can i be gay and married?  The group of friends soon make important realisations: That you can be married and gay That you can be friends and use each other That you can be a TOP and BOTTOM  If you ask nicely, will your friend's corpse come back to life?  Taken from The Necessary Stage: TOP OR BOTTOM.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  Well as you can see i have put up a new blog. This time its a totally different thing. The gay stuffs are staying. This time its going to be  MORE GAY! MORE EXOTIC!  well this blog is not meant for public view. So guys. I trust you.

Well went out to go meet my friends at Admiralty Mrt station at around 7:45am. Took a train towards City Hall. Once reached there we walked towards the M.I.T.A building. Thats the place that we were suppose to go for our Art Workshop. Than we went to take our pass so nice! At approximately 9:20am we went up level three and head towards the streats room.  In the streats room well there were kinda alot of peeps there. From other schools. I didn't know it was a competition till that lady asked me where am i from and blah blah blah. Well ok lets get back. There was this guy in red shirt he came in kinda late but lucky he came in when the course have not yet start.

Than i wanted to like go out and talk to him... but my team members were like went, "Den!? where u want to go?"... to make them not notice me that i wanted to cruise on that guy... i just told them i wanted to walk around... instead i walk the other direction, STUPID ME! i should gone out and talk to that Red-shirt guy!.

         [msg]STOP IT! STOP MAKING ME FEEL IN GUILT! AH! I HATE GUILT I HATE YOU!       The reason so for this nick name was that Amirul now is trying to make me feel guilty for telling the Dicipline Commitee. As you know i wrote a 'Student's Sentence' about me being threatened by him. I couldn't take the pressure from him no more. So i had to turn to one of the teachers but instead he passed the baton to the Dicipline Commitee.      Today in school every time he/i bump into each other He would like try to make me feel guilty by saying,  "THANKS ALOT DEN FOR TELLING THE DM" or "EH! BOY! THANKS ALOT! NOW I AM EXPELLED!" or "THANKS ALOT DEN! DON'T WORRY AH I WON'T DISTURB YOU NOW. I AM GOING TO CHANGE SCHOOL THANKS TO YOU.".  Like MAN! stop it already. I hate it you know. He is irritating me every single minute of my life. He is trying to make me come up to him and wanting me to make a move. Eh.. Sorry i am calm and cool. I don't care about you now, AMIRUL HAFIZ. My intention/mission now is to protect, help and counsil my little sister, Moon (Muneera ... hope i spell it correctly. :P).    After recess, i knew he was staring at me from the back. On the way down the stairs, his friends (who are also my friends) wanted to confront be but instead they irritated me by asking, "Eh Den. Why Amirul want to change school? What have you done Den? Your own friend.".  Like URGH! SHUT THE FUCK UP WITH HIM! SO WHAT HE IS CHANGING SCHOOL, SO WHAT HE IS EXPELLED AND SO WHAT THE FUCKING HELL IF HE BEATS ME UP!  all he wants me to do now is to make a move and than he can make his move.    I couldn't stand it anymore. After school. Amirul "threatens" my little sister for a patch up but lucily i was there so he had to move away. I told her not to and NEVER patch back with that idiotic, mean, irritating and stupid AMIRUL.    Just now, I and Ash have decided to seperate for a short period of time so that both parties to cool down. Well we might caught up with each other with Roy and Daniel when Daniel and I, Roy, Ash and maybe our son Dan go for the FIESTA concert at the Botanical Garden. Well i will be going with Daniel, Roy and Ash (as for our son... i dono hahah). I hope i can cool down. Well erm till here lah... too angry about Amirul and Too happy because Ash is happy. :P bye.

      Must wondering what had happened to me in school today right? well not much... i think today's entry is going to be short.    Woke up really tired because i did not have a pleasant sleep. As usual went to school. Well during free period, P.E. lesson, i heard that Amirul, this guy who have been chasing after me for quiet sometime, is going to get either public canning or just a canning in the office. I am feeling kind of guilty. A close friend of Amirul came up to me and gave me a letter from him.   Dear Deen,   Thanks a lot for telling the DM (discipline Masters/Mistress). Have a happy life... BTW have a happy life.   That was what the letter said. I felt guilty because he is a good friend. Happy life? Me? Happy? No one is happy... I am just always cheerful not happy just don't be near me when my alter-ego brother comes out. Than i had my most favorite lesson, Maths... i am beginning to like maths because of the teachers. After school i had Maths remedial. When i saw my two maths teachers i ran up to them excitedly, "Oh My Dearest Mdm Jas and Mrs Mak! You are the greatest Maths teacher i ever have! You made me LOVE MATHS! IN return I LOVE YOU! (so i giggled into class hahah)".. but than Mdm Jas said "No thats ok my dearest Saifuddeen. No need to love us just in return you give us GOOD RESULTS."...hahah. Well ok lets skip the maths remedial and band.   After band i love to come up to the members and tell them i the ear to stand in attention. Haha. Well i went to McDonald's with Rebecca and Rashid aka Rah-Rah. When we took our seats Eddy came in and asked if he could join us. In excitement, both me and Rah-rah, Rashid forced Eddy to sit down. Well he sat down in front of me. Suprisingly my school's principle went to McDonald's and bought a dinner. I came up to her and said HI. Took out my wallet and decided to buy two ice-cream cone. Eddy jumped up to me and gave me a kiss on my cheek. Like it is not like him to give me a kiss you know. Ok so what if he is a little gayish at times, knows that i am gay, i care for him, protects him... etc. Like its impossible to explain the feeling because it is best to feel it. When i look at him, he was blushing. When i have bought my ice-cream he spanked my butt. That boy must be horny. Once our ice-cream have gone down into our stomach, Eddy asked me accompany him to POPULAR bookstore to buy something. He wanted to buy a new book. While browsing through the books, Eddy went to the lowest shelf. He sat down on the floor infront of me. His head was just right infront of my crotch. No one was around at that time. What he did was turn his head to the left and gave a soft bite on my crothch. Like OUCH... that gave me a hard on!. My face went red like a skin of a Tomato. Like why is Eddy doing this to me? What does he wants from me? He stood up and told me not to tell Rashid and imagine that did not happened. No! we did not smooch ok. For heavens sake he is 14 and shorter than me, he is my junior and my little gawd-chinese-bro. While searching for his book, i rested my head on his shoulder. He looked at me and gave me a kiss on my forehead. Like whats up with this guy? When he found his favorite book and Q up, He gave me a wink. Once he finished purchasing that book Eddy told me not to be jealous if Rashid starts to touch him or what. I just nodded my head like Noddy in Toyland. On the way home Rashid started to put his arm around Eddy. Nope i did not get jealous or what. What for i should get jealous. He is not my boyfriend. When we had to be separated, i looked at Eddy and he gave me a wink again. So there i started walking home alone as usual. Well till here than... thats all i gotta write. BYE!

        I give up.   I really do.   ...   Good luck, Den.   Good luck.   From,  Ashton   Quoted from Ash's letter. Does means that we are no longer together? -----------------------------------------------    You must be wondering what the title means rite? well here is what had happened to me.    Last night after i came back from the wonderful performance by a few Gold School Bands. I stared at the letter that he had wrote to me(above). Wondering if he is alright. Both, not knowing each other's well being. Than i remembered that i have a Gmail account to check. So off i went and checked the mails i recieved. Not much though. Than suprisingly his name was there, Daniel LAh!. He has sent me an e-mail asking for more information about next week's concert at the Botanical Garden, His school will be performing (Anglo Chinese Independent). Actually i asked him out on 18th to accompany to the concert. So i replied to his first e-mail. Once replied i checked my inbox again, Daniel has sent me a Cirque Du Soleil 'Virtual Card'. A La Nouba Virtual Card, how did he know that La Nouba is my favorite resident show?...:P, it said that he wanna apologise that he won't get to see me for quiet a long time, i got kinda shock and erm sorta confused coz why the apology heheh, his parents has minimised his usage of the internet (yeah he is apologising for not coming online regularly... O.o), he went to Ash's website and read his bloggy. He felt sorry for him and he is sorry that i wont be angry..(angry? come on i have a split personality which comes out whenever someone is irritating, turns me down regularly and etc). He too mentioned that i can ask him out and try to keep it on weekdays and he won't be staying at the boarding school for 2weeks due to his Piano exams (GOOD LUCK!). Haha its actually strange because missing someone's company is my job haha... but it seems that he misses my company... no one have ever like directly said that to me before (i blushed totally when i read that part! hehehe). Well don't worry Daniel, our religion maybe different but at least our religion have the same history. I replied to his e-mail with an apology too and i soon went on and on with the e-mail not stopping hahaha. At the end of the letter i made a confession to him. (this part i gotta cencord it cause its not meant to be put up here for safety purposes.) I kinda blushed and once the e-mail was sent i quickly closed the window and imagined nothing had happened.    The next day (Today of course), In the canteen during recess i sat with my gal frendz. I did not notice that Ern Leng sat behind me. Eliza purposely tapped his back and said hi. I blushed away. Than i keep peeking back to see him. hehehe. Than i notice that K.S. was sitting beside Mizan. Like walau! Two guys who i have a crush on is sitting near me. Suddenly the gerls asked me to look behind... so i did... And there he was...IVAN!... Those gerls were so mean! "Got two seh! hahaha"... I really really really really blushed and like Ern Leng is sitting behind me, K.S is sitting in the same row of tables with me and IVAN! is just standing at the edge of the table behind me where Ern Leng was! This made me really really really really really red! three of the most hottest/cuttest guys to me is very very near me! Than when Ern Leng and Ivan left, which made me cooled down more, the gerls just stood up and said lets go!... so i stood up and pushed the bench back suprisingly causing heheh my friend to land on her bottoms with her plate, luckly nothing left, with me tripping over the edge of the bench. I sat up properly and looked at her face, she was angry (not exactly angry...angry in a sacarstic way haha) and i looked at K.S. he was giggling and staring at me... He gave me a wink. My eyes rolled back towards her and she like gave me an angry face.. so i got scared i stood up and ran away hahaha.     After school. I went to buy some lunch for me to eat. While i was eating my class mate was spinning his basketball on his forefinger. Then a pair of hands covered my eyes. All of the sudden my plate flew onto me. All the food and gravy made my shirt dirty. Like there goes my $2 of lunch. I cleared the table and wiped away all the excess food that was on the table. Dusting away food from my uniform. Many were staring at me but i just ignored. I decided not to eat the left overs cause i lost my appetite for the rest of the day. Once i put back the plate i saw my little sister, Moon, crying. I came up to her and asked her what had happened. So she told me. I gave her a pat on the shoulder and asked her not to cry anymore. Without noticing her EX-BOYFRIEND, My ex-gawd-brother, my ex-father, my ex-bestfriend was watching me. He got angry. I felt someone looking at me so i peeked over my shoulder and there he was trying to get a fight with me (he was not near me yet k). A few of my friends asked me to go away.. but i refused cause i can't let my little sister suffer no more. Than my bestfriend, Rashid, forced me to go away. I did moved away from them... i went to the DnT block. When i was there, my ex girlfriend accompanied me to protect me cause she knows that Amirul won't hurt me in front of a girl. The other Rashid said to me that my ex girlfriend don't want me to die or get hurt. I didn't know she would be so caring. I asked her to be my protector for a while. We walked towards this strange and new office, FE HUB???, than he walked out of the canteen and called for me. He backed away when he sees a few of my friends near Mr Bruce, My english teacher and Amirul's Z-Club teacher-in-charge. I came up to him and told him what had happened and hoping that he could counsel him but instead he asked MR SIVA, the school's Dicipline Master, and made this case official. So i had to enter the General Office and write a statement... than my ex gerlfriend knocked on the window asked me to come out with the form. So i did. (lets skip this part...make me wanna cry... so stressed!) Well than i decided to withdraw the sentence but i couldn't cause that stupid Siva asked me to think twice. So i sat infront of Mdm Su, my favorite Dicipline Mistress, and wrote the sentence having the two Rashids talking to her what had happened. Once i finished Mdm Su called my sis, since my parents are not home they went to KL, and with her permission to let me go home either alone or ask her to pick me up but instead i went home with my bestfriend.     I realised that i have friends who care for me when i am in really really really really in trouble. All this time i tried not express too much of my feelings. I try to cool down and make this cooling but instead SOMEONE made it worst. Haiz... Y does it have to end with Innocents Suffering?...

      At last its about time i update this bloggy. Well today's blog will be a little different and a little  LOOONG  hahah. :P You will see why. To start off i would&nbsp;like to tell you all a story that someone has told me and has touched my heart. In this case of the story i am going write, i will be in the shoes of her life. Those who are reading this blog please do reflect after reading this story.   &nbsp;I was still in&nbsp;Belgium at that time when my little brother, titi (little brother in chinese), commited suicide from the 11th floor, 2days before his 27th birthday. The relation between me and him wasn't that close. He is just 2years old younger than me. When we were young, after my father left me when i was still in primary school and moved to a three room flat in Bedok, there wasn't any communication between my little brother and me. We were just like strangers. We stayed under the same roof and shared the same room, yet does not talk to each other much.&nbsp;   &nbsp;He stopped school when he was in primary school. At&nbsp;the age of 13,&nbsp;he already started to smoke, glue sniffing, mixed around with&nbsp;bad company and gamble. Every night i come home, he would smoke in the room. I cannot stand the smoke and smell! I don't even know how did i survive those threatherous moments. My own mother would even bring MEN home or other people to gamble and play mah-jong. She would borrow money from people and used it pay her debts.   &nbsp;It is really shocking to see that gambling has taken over the lifes of my mother and two other brothers.&nbsp;He used to work in a bakery shop. He would sacrifice his time just to get money for him self. Every night he would come home and smell of flour, bread, cookies and cakes. He loves his job alot.&nbsp;I pity him for what he had to go through.   &nbsp;There wasn't much connection between him and me. There are a few times he ran away from home, same goes with the other little brother. When i was away in australia, my little brother was sent to a mental hospital for a few month and while he was in the hospital, my mother was under a lot of depts. A few loan-sharks came and treatened her. My little brother was brought back home a few days before his death. My mother left the house one day, i do not know did he get the key to the window. Once he opened the window, he stood on the&nbsp;edge and than jumped&nbsp;out.  &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;I recieved a&nbsp;call from my mother,&nbsp;i was still in belgium, when i heard about the news i got shocked. Tears filled my eyes. " Titi tiao liao.",  that was what my mother said to me on the phone, translated&nbsp;from&nbsp;dialect  "Little brother commited suicied".  Those were the words i remember&nbsp;till now. Loosing a little brother whom i have not talked to for almost 2years,&nbsp;before his death. The last&nbsp;conversation i remembered between&nbsp;him and me was that he asked&nbsp;if i could borrow him some money, which is to pay his debts.   &nbsp;Soon i heard my&nbsp;another little&nbsp;brother&nbsp;got into a car accident, now he is limping.&nbsp;I could see that my&nbsp;current little brother is actually following,&nbsp;Titi's, foot steps.&nbsp;My current little brother stopped school when he was in sec 3. My mother was pretty upset. People blamed her for my little brother's death. A few years after i got married, i visited my mother. She accused me for not caring and that was why my little brother died. I did not cry or what. I just got angry and upset inside. I dare not show her my feelings. Soon my family, not including me as i am already married, moved out with the help of the government because the HDB said that the aparment is now haunted so the government gave my mom money to buy a new house. With a sum of money left after buying a new house, she got happy. She could pay her debts. Soon she found out that i was giving a sum of money to my father monthly. She got upset. Felt unfair so she asked me that she too wanted me to give her money monthly.   &nbsp;As you can see. How greedy gamblers can be. How terrifying the life of a drug addict goes through. When one have no money and is in danger, he/she will kill him/her self just to stay away from the concequences. To me I think, if my little brother had not gone on glue sniffing and be with bad company his death would not happen. Thats why i am very harsh towards&nbsp;alot of people.&nbsp;I know that the world out there is  REALLY HARSH, HARD and DIFFICULT.     &nbsp;   -=The End=-    I would like to thank to the someone who have told me this story. Its really touching and sad to hear. Thank you again to the someone.   Ok thats all for story telling time. NOW! its time for me to say about what happened today.    &nbsp;   TRAUMATISED!     &nbsp;  &nbsp;Well woke up as usual. Everything went ok untill the third period, Geography period. During the lesson Bing Lin kept calling me from the back. He kept saying that he likes me, wants to be with me, loves me and want me to be his.  OH WHAT SUCH HORROR!.  I did not care to what he said, just ignored him. When the lesson ended, i was packing my bag till he came up to me from the back. He hugged me, groped my nipples and butt. Of course I got scared! i struggled alot! Than he hugged me tightly and make a kissing gesture. He then tried to kiss me!  OH MY GOD! THIS IS WAY WORST THAN A HORROR MOVIE ! He kept getting closer and i kept getting away from him. The smell of his bad breath! eeewww! yucks! i ran around in the class than grabbed my bag and books. He got hold of my bag and than hugged me again!... he wanted to kiss me badly! My people were staring at me! when he let me go i ran out of the class room dropped my bag, next door class, and ran away from him.&nbsp; I went from my class, till the next class (just beside), to the canteen then back to the second class. I was traumatised for haven sake!. When i got back into class, Bing Lin was standing beside me. I did not notice him. Everyone was getting ready to greet the teacher but instead i screamed. Mr Bruce saw me and asked Bing Lin to go back to his class. I quickly sat down and hide under the table. Mr Bruce got little irritated so he asked me to stand. I was trembling in fear. I was white like a ghost. Clueless like a sloth.&nbsp; Man!&nbsp;why does it have to be Bing Lin!? He so disgusting! So stupid! Mentally Crazy!&nbsp;Idiotic! Irritating! Smelly! Ugly! (and i mean it UGLY!) Man! If it was Daniel Never&nbsp;Mind lah... BING LIN!? EEEEEWWWWW!!!! NO WAY MAN! LUCKILY I GOT FREE!     &nbsp;LET SKIP THIS PART! I DONT WANNA REMEMBER IT!    Ok after school, i did not went for prayers because i was held back by my idiotic teacher. So i spend the whole time in school and then went for art club. Well after art&nbsp;club went to mcdonalds and ate a happy meal! hehehe got a Birdie toy today. hehehe. Got home had a short nap in my sister's room. Had the most erotic&nbsp;and exotic&nbsp;dream again. Yeah! i got a wet dream again. hahah!. This time its just two people. Me and D****L. I must not mention the person's name. If he knows i will feel 'Paiseh'!... i shy to talk abouth the dream.   Oh yeah Daniel! I made a logo out of your name hahaha its something not so nice lah.. hahah just did it during free period. Well I have to concentrate with my new Art Club project. Doing Drung Abuse. I did a few sketches of the project and soon to make it into a painting. Nice right!?... hahaha.

      &nbsp;Woke up early in the morning. Got ready for school and so on. During the first two periods i felt like killing my self. I took out a large scissors from my bag and asked my friend next to me to kill me. She thought i was joking. I snatched the scissors from here and started to rub the sharp end on to my right arm. The girls around me went, "Den! stop it Den. Den you are a good friend. Please ah Den stop it ok." Syakilla turned around and asked what was wrong but instead tears started to fill my eyes. The girls that sat around me saw me crying. After that was M.T. (malay) no teacher entered the class so what i did was borrowed a Pen Knife from Syazwanie and took a packet of tissue from Azimah. &nbsp; &nbsp; I sat at the back of the class and started to cut my self but i couldn't because my skin is very thick. Seri saw me cutting my self. She stopped me and asked me what was wrong. Then i started crying. Many crowded over me, i shouted and asked them to leave me alone so they did. I took out my wallet and looked at His picture. I felt like tearing the picture but i couldn't because  I STILL DO LOVE HIM . I cried alot in class. After that was Recess. I walked quickly to the canteen and ate a few breads and bought a bottle of mineral water and biscuits.   &nbsp; Left the crowded place and went to the Science corner which is a very deserted and dark. I started to eat my food. Once done i took out the pen knife which was in my pocket and slashed my left arm. It was quiet difficult as i have thick and elastic skin. Instead i slowly pierce my skin and scared it. Its just small slashes, two only. so don't worry k.  I got out of control, i couldn't stop crying, couldn't stop hating my self for what i have done to him.  Luckily Syakilla heard a silent cry and walked towards the corner. She saw me trying really hard to cut my self but lukily i already had, twice. She snatched the pen-knife away from me and throw it away. She asked me what was wrong but all i did was just kept quiet. &nbsp; &nbsp; When got back to class i had stopped crying because it was Food And Nutrition lesson. At least cooking had made me feel better. My teacher, Ms Mayer Chan, had taken photos of me and my partner cooking and took a photo of my dish. She said that i have very good set ups and good in garnishing food. She was really nice to me. After cooking we had to do Evaluation, its when you write a small essay about how, what does the dish taste like, smells, looks and what imporvements can be made just like a critic. My teacher loves my Evaluation because i always evaluate in detail, Like Duh... she said i am the IRON CHEF of the school. haha.  &nbsp; &nbsp;After three periods of Food And Nutrition it was Biology, my favorite lesson. Little cheerful because i am her favorite student in the class hahaha. I always ask questions, get distinction during exams, complete my work, very smart... and so on... she sure mentioned about me alot in&nbsp;the student report. Everyone in the class was making alot of noise. She was teaching about our&nbsp;red blood cells. Like i too did not pay attention as i have read about the chapter way long before the lesson started. Instead when she mentioned about Virus i started to ask alot of questions.. like Why? What? How?... lots of time... every answer she gave me i would continue on for example, "Our body must be fit to stay healthy." and i would ask, "Why?", "because so that the system in our body can function properly."... and i would ask why, what and how a lot of times. Causing everyone to keep quiet and listen to me go on and on with my questions. Many started to giggle as i ask her questions.&nbsp;  &nbsp; The final bell of the day rang. Everyone was happy but i wasn't because i had to stay back to practice the final time for the Indian Dance Competition, which will be tml. After an hour of practice i sat one corner of the room. All of the sudden i started to think of HIM and began to cry. The gang crowded around me. I stood up and went to the toilet. Three guys from the gang came out a few seconds after i had left the room. Washed my face. I was drying my hand (note the dryer is really near to the&nbsp;door)&nbsp;when i realised that my shoe was untied so i bent down slowly,  suddenly the door swung open with a powerful force. The handle of the door hit my head really hard, then with the door handle like a pressing motion... it caused my head to hit the hand dryer. It all happened really fast. My friend, Uwise..from one of the three guys who came out from the room after i left,&nbsp;came in and saw me like going to faint and in pain, he quickly grabbed me and let me rest on his body for a while. The two other guys, Syariff and Ismail was like beside him asking if i was alright and laughing. Uwise apologised, i couldn't hear anything much because my ear was also affected from the incident. I went out of the toilet dizzy and could faint anytime, i tried to hold my self together.  Walked to the room like a drunk man, sat at the table and rested there. Many asked me what was wrong but i kept quiet as i was too dizzy to talk. All of the sudden everything went black out when i rested on the table. Seri woke me up by shaking me vigerously. They asked me to go home to rest but i didn't i requested to practice one last time with costumes. My costume is very simple. A singlet as a top, a track pants and two scarfs, one worn around me the other tied around my waist. Once done with the practice, i went home.  &nbsp; Well thats all for now. Till next time k. Bubbye.

      Chapter 9.3 (last chapter)  &nbsp; This will be the last chapter to all love or whatever. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Woke up very early in the morning with the feeling of happiness in the air. Today is the day when i meet Daniel. From the time i woke up, i have waited for Daniel's call. I know he can't call me in the morning because he has to go to Church. So i waited for him. Till late noon. The clocked striked 3 when i had to go. Well Ash and Roy has scheduled to meet me at Orchard Mrt around 3:45pm&nbsp;to go to the concert at the Botanical Garden. When i was about to go, Rashid came to my house and saw me getting ready to go out. Well sadly Rashid  FORCED  me to go to his house because he wants to tag along. Well he took a really long time to get ready. I got pissed off with him so i just waited, looking at the clock's minute hand pass by every minute mark.&nbsp;Once he was ready, we straight took a bus towards Admiralty MRT station.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I smsed Ash saying that i would be late. When i was in Khatib he smsed me asking where i was,  "I am in Khatib."  i replied his msg,  "WHAT!? ok."  a unsuspected reply from him. Well from that i know he was sorta angry at me. They have already reached there. Once we arrived at our destination, i gave a call to Ash saying that i have already reached the station. He asked me to wait for him at the control station. We saw them once we got out of those machines that wishes to crush people's waist. I saw Ash with this attitude which i seem not to like. I came up to him and apologised a lot of times. While up on the escalator he turned to Roy, seems like he was ignoring my apology, telling him that he wanted to go to the toilet. So off they went to that toilet.I got  HURT  when he ignored my apology and showing me that attitude. Rashid asked for my cellphone as he wanted to call his mom. I passed it to him. I was still hurt inside so i decided to go up the first escalator to see if it is crowded. Well i waited for them at the top.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hurt inside, I decided to walk all alone. Away from them. Don't want to be hurt again with that bitchy attitude. It was like Roy's bitchy attitude from last night had infected Ash. For the whole journey i kept quiet, not look at his face and walked as fast as i can. Rashid asked me to wait for them but i just ignored his words. I walked really fast. When i entered the botanical garden, everything was way different. The short cut to the location was blocked so i had to walk the long way. Rashid shouted at me asking me if i knew where i was going so i just pointed the direction to the place. &nbsp;&nbsp; Once near the place i could hear the band playing Mission Impossible than Pirates of the Carribian. Once at that place i smsed Dan asking where was he. (ok skip this part)....from the hills above listening the ACS(I) playing ITS A SMALL AFTER ALL i went down and walked pass Ash and Roy.&nbsp;I dare not look at their faces as i don't want to see that attitude. I sat on the bench hoping that Ash would come up the stairs and talk to me but it didn't happen. People from all sorts of background and age sat beside me. I got tired so i went for a walk. I walked around up the hill down the hill, in and out of the bushes. Suddenly i received an SMS from Dan saying that Ash and Roy are leaving. Sadly he does not know where the duo were heading. I saw them walking out of the second entrance like happily. Seeing Ash waving his arms in the air and Roy shaking his head like a pair of baby rattle. I smsed Ash asking where they were heading twice. He did not reply to my msg so i decided to follow them from behind. Till the path leads to the main road. Roy called for a Taxi and both went in. I just stood there. Feeling more  HURT, DISAPPOINTED, CRUSHED, SAD, DEPRESSED.  How can he do this, Just left like that. I walked towards the main road looking the back of the taxi. Stood there soulessly. A tear from my&nbsp;right eye slide down my cheeks. &nbsp;&nbsp; I went and sms Rashid saying that i had to go already. I walked slowly from the Botanical Garden till Orchard MRT station. During the whole journey Rashid have been calling me and asking me whats wrong. And during the whole journey Ash and I have been argueing really badly. This time its worst.    -"where are you going?" "Um, Home.." -"Y?" "Tired. Don't worry, we'll be fine..." (do you think i wont worry? do you that i will be fine too?)   ..haiz.. well let me remember what i said after that... *this is a summarised what i said after this dialoge. -'Oh i c, Well since yesterday's concert was boring for both of you. Its not worth the money...a waste of money... In addition i am grounded because of i did not pay back my mom's money."&nbsp; "Oh shoot! The money for the concert!"   -"Never mind lah no need to pay me..." "NO! We need to pay you!" -"No need." "Why?!"   -"We won't be meeting again mah...* can't remember after that..." "Well, I forgave you already, but you kept running from me..." -"Because you were showing an attitude. Ignored my apology when i said it just now. You did not enjoy last night's concert... blah blah * can't remember again." "...I have nothing to say. But i wished you had told me what was wrong, rather than now..." (well i was waiting for you up there hoping that you would talk to me. But since you showed me an attitude and ignored me... most likely NOT.) -"Haiz..blah blah.. I think what Rashid was right. You two have doing things behind my back. Whatever it is i don't wanna know" "What the hell, i am not doing anything with roy!" - I did not reply after that... crying while walking. "I don't know what the hell Ra-ra told you, but i am definitely not with roy, If i am, may lightning strike me to hell.-continue from the next sms of ASH- what ever it is, forget about the FUCKING things i did for you, the stupid way i loved you and idiotic wai i broke so many so called rules in your life." (why would lightning strike you to hell. You don't even know whats hell like. You don't have a religion. Let LIGHTNING STRIKE ON ME! COZ THERE IS HELL IN MY LIFE AND RELIGION. LET ME DIE! LET MY SOUL BURN IN HELL! and FINE! FORGET ABOUT IT! Btw ASH if you are reading this.. Those cute sounds that you always make... ITS NOT CUTE!)   &nbsp;&nbsp; I dare not reply his sms as i wish not to hurt him no more and not to kill my self by being runned&nbsp;over by a car. Thanks to this japanese teenager guy in black he saved me from that car. Not exactly my fault the light was still green man. He asked me whats wrong, but i did not answer, so he just only gave me a packet of tissue paper and walked me to the station. Everyone was staring at me in the station. Everyone was staring at me in the TRAIN. I stood and still crying abit&nbsp;the whole journey back home. I walked home all alone. Feeling lost.&nbsp;Then i saw my sister going somewhere, i waved at her... than she&nbsp;called me&nbsp;just to borrow my&nbsp;ezlink card. When i got home i straight went into my room. And now i&nbsp;am sitting here... crying... doing my homework...waiting.  The END.  Well Daniel...&nbsp;can you just say that you  DON'T WANT TO GO&nbsp;TO THE CONCERT.  I waited for you call for a long time.&nbsp;btw your mom is quiet friendly though.&nbsp;Haiz... well till here.. Bye.&nbsp;   And yeah Its confirm that the relationship between Me and Ash is over. Its OVER! OVER! AH! He is now gone from my life... I am gone from his life. But i know either one of us will start crying back for more.

      Knowing that Roy and Ash did not enjoy the concert. I think next time i should not bring them along. Like i know Roy has to be there with Ash for safety sake but at least enjoy the show. If i knew i should have gone to the concert all alone. I went to the concert to relax, learn some stuffs from those two tubist and enjoy the music. It seems like not worth the money for them. It was kinda worth it for me. Haiz... Then want to say the Tuba solo is boring. No its not boring if you don't truly understand MUSIC. People who have no background of music, like me, can understand because i have learn music. People with very little knowledge of music enjoyed the concert as well. Why can't they. Waste my money only. Now i am grounded from going out to concerts that are expensive. My mom grounded me cause she asked me where was the money... i just kept quiet about it. Haiz... Why does bad things happen to me. Haiz. If i were them... i would just say that the concert was nice but some parts were boring or say that the tuba solo was ok. Haiz... at least Respect lah the instrument that i have been in love with for 3years. Its not easy starting off with the LARGE C flat Tuba. Haiz... next time i go alone lah. Haiz... so dissappointed you know. If this were to happen again right... i think i just go alone lah. Their attitude were like went, "The concert so boring, Cannot spell concert properly, Tuba solo is boring.".. Than Ash.. wanna make fun about my instrument. I represent ALL TUBA MEMBERS, no matter male or female, young or old, fat or thin, straight or gay... I dont like people to make fun of my instrument. Its my passion. It was the one that made me have inspiration. Haiz... Next thing i learned is that I should get Daniel's contact so that i can contact him if i have any questions about the next outing or concert or whatever lah. I don't even know if he is going to the concert today, at the botanical garden. Haiz... I think he wont be coming lor... like he never contact me. Like this i go alone lah. Here i am again... being a  LONER.

      Ok ok this time round i won't be asking about what ya think ok. :P. I am going to go straight to the point.  &nbsp; Well woke up just in time to get ready and go for band.&nbsp; While i was zipping up my pants, my instructor called me. He ordered me to do DRILL!, YAY! at lasT! got DRILL! i love Drills!. Well once he put down the phone i got ready everything and RAN OFF to school. I noticed that the music room was still locked and that the band members were behind the library for falling in and all. I shouted to Shazwanie, the main Drum Mistress.. i am her Assistant, that Drill for 20mins. Well i too fall-in into the file, once she gave the announcements and commanded the members to seperate them self into 4 groups, one major per group. Once that was done, as usual i am incharged of group TWO, i did the usual Drill routines. "Kebelakang Pusing! Ke Kiri Pusing! Ke Kanan Pusing! Dari Kiri cepat jalan!...etc" well once that was done i gave them a short break and talked to them. My instructor came just in time to teach them how to do "Ke belakang Pusing while Marching and Ke Kiri Belok". Once thought i practiced commanding those drills. Than we had a small competition to see which group was better, group one combined with two (mine and Shaz's) and three and four, well it turns out that one and two won! hahah thanks to US! hahah. Well than the whole day we practiced on dynamics, scales, tuning, Awakening Hills (our SYF choice piece) and 2nd Suite in F Major 1st(Marching),&nbsp; 3rd(Never ending love)&nbsp;and 4th(Fantasia in the 'Degarson'). After that hard day i decided to bring home my tuba. After that i recieved a call from my friend that there is Dance Rehersals at the HALL. Well ran with my tuba, in the casing of course, to the HALL (not the school hall lah its a void deck) when i reached the place there was no one. Tired i went home. Did not rest i straight away took a shower and got ready for the concert that i attended, Sembawang Wind Orchestra: Konzert 11. Well i went to the concert with Ash and Roy. I had to pay the tickets first cause my instrutor has already booked the tickets for us. I met them at P.S. (plaza Singapura). Once i met them, i hugged Ash infront of the large crowd. He wore something different and i wore something different. Its like i and him had a fashion exchange, he wore baggy clothes (which i love to wear) and i wore tight and gayish clothes (which i am getting the hang of it hahaha). We walked in and out searching for a place to eat. Instead we went to Long John Silvers and ate there, Wah its about time i ate something... my first meal of the day. After 'dinner'&nbsp;we went straight to Victoria Concert Hall. It was packed with idiots from Dunmand High (donno if correct spelling ahaha!). Ok lets skip this part where i get the tickets. I was amazed by the TUBA! only two! one is a C Tuba the other is a MIRAPHONE! i love MIRAPHONES! it is so nice!&nbsp; The first song has a C tuba playing as a solo. LIKE WOW! i play a C tuba! haha now i can learn some stuffs from this fat guy. hahaha. It was superb! seeing that guy play! its like the other version of VINCENT, my senior who is a very good tuba player... he thought me properly how to play the TUBA. Well the other song with this tubist is TUBA CONCERTO! wow! tuba too has a CONCERTO! hahaha so good! Man! i love this guy's playing of the Miraphone man! he plays like me hahaha really but i need more practice in my fast fingering and etc lor.&nbsp;Some more i don't know the fingerings to a Miraphone.. its a little different than a C tuba cause Miraphones have four valves and C tubas have just three. I was amazed by this two guys. Oh yeah during the first half of the concert i sat in the middle while Ash and Roy sat at the corner.&nbsp; I noticed this guy who plays a flute was looking at me, i went like "Is it me or is he staring at those ugly girls behind me?"... he has been staring at me since i entered the concert hall. From my first seat at the corner with Ash and Roy till i was in the middle. Than everytime he would like peak at me over his stand... Ah! i must be imagining things lah... hahaha. Well after the concert... all those from Dunman High went WE WANT MORE! WE WANT MORE!... the concert has already ended and the players have already started leaving... so i shouted.. GO HOME! IF YOU WANT MORE! GO HOME! IF YOU WANT MORE! hahahah... and they stared at me and i giggled ahaha. Once we left that over crowded full of idiots, we all went walking around. Than Roy say he wanted to eat... than we started to walk around to fine nice places... i lead them lor... showed them some neat places to eat.. but i too wanted to eat lah but never mind, you will soon find out. Well when we at City Link near HMV roy went like talking to Ash in private lor ... i decided to like not notice lor. Than like i see Roy's face as if he is not happy with me lor.&nbsp;When we went to Suntec City, Ash asked me if they could go to Marche. I excused them lor... I lost my appetite cause like i too wanted to eat lor but never mind. I feel like i am a obstruction, i am a muslim and they are an another religion. They can eat what ever they want but i can't.. when we reached Marche... i got worried cause i dono what is Halal and what is not so i decided not to eat anything, or even drink. Ash bought Potato Wedges and Roy had Milk Shake. I got into a world of imagination not knowing what is going on but i came back to reality when Roy asked me if i want to eat instant noodles. -.- ... like instant noodles? i have not had a PROPER MEAL for a week and asking me to eat instant noodles. Well when we stopped by at 7-eleven.. i bought Ice Coffee and Apple and Green Tea drink. Tats all nothing else. When we reached the MRT station... i like try not to look at them lor cause i got quiet sad. The final words was Good bye and a hand shake from Ash. Than i walked off. In the train i felt like crying because i had not have a proper meal ( i am VERY VERY VERY hungry!) and i might not see him soon and feeling like an obstruction. Once reached home i cooked a proper meal for my self... and ate... and now i am here typing this blog. Well till next time... take care all... bye.

      &nbsp; Ah! so fucked up today. Hated that short guy in my class, Nicholas Ho Long Wei!. He ah! FUCK MAN! i hate him!. I hate him forever after what he had done. AH! He is one of those people who i wish to kill for being so noisy, irritating, stupid, idiotic and for being shorter then me.  &nbsp; Came to school just in time, people were reading their boring story books when i came. While i was walking down my class, to find a place to sit, i noticed that there were not quiet alot of absentees today. I sat down as usual and read my boring book. Well as usual lor went to class and had lessons. During recess i ate noodles and then went for my usual recess walk around the school. I went to the english corner and did it again, cutting my wrist, then i went to the canteen again let my blood flow.  &nbsp; Well while walking down the stairs, to go back to class, i saw HIM (nicholas) pulling down the cuirtains to my  ENGLISH CORNER . He pulled it twice and the string broke and everything fell. I got so angry i shouted really loud,  "NICHOLAS! FUCK YOU LAH!",  and threw my water bottle to the closed section of the entrance causing a loud bang. Many of the guys were shocked to see me get angry, many have not seen me get really reallyangry, many stopped me from beating him up but i pushed them away and pulled HIM by the collar, felt like crying, and shouted at him in the face,  "EH!? YOU KNOW HOW MUCH EFFORT OR NOT TO PUT UP THAT ENGLISH CORNER!? AH!? YOU MOTHER FUCKER!?",  luckily there were no teacher around. I let him go and quickly walked into the class while pushing every one away. The guys went,  "AIYO! NICHOLAS! NICHOLAS!...",  many asked me what was wrong i just kept quiet in anger, a tear oozed out from my eye. I just shouted in class,  "SO MUCH EFFORT PUT IN AND NOW ITS ALL GONE! FUCK YOU NICHOLAS! ALL THIS WHILE ITS YOU!".  He just kept quiet and did not look at me.  &nbsp; The last bell of the day rang, i picked up my bag and rushed out of the classroom. I went up to the fourth floor, where the art room is,&nbsp; not realising that Ern Leng, he is&nbsp;one of the&nbsp;cutest guy&nbsp;to me and&nbsp;been having a&nbsp;big and deep crush on him since last year,&nbsp;was there.&nbsp; I saw him and looked at him but i just looked away when he saw me looking at him. After that i did not look at him again. I saw my friend, Atiqah at a table near by, and came up to her. I realised that someone was looking at me so i turned back, it was him peeping out from this classroom trying to get a glimpse of me. I just ignored him. Soon i walked away from them and waited for my teacher on this stretch of path. Leaned against the railing waiting for my art club teacher. Soon i realised that Henry took Ern Leng's bag and ran towards my direction, i just looked at them running towards, passed me and away from me. Ern Leng chased after him but Henry changed direction and came back running towards my direction but this time i did not looked at HIM (Ern Leng) i just ignored him. Some thing fishy&nbsp;is&nbsp;going on. How come when ever i want to make the move, he will move away from me but when i ignore him or try to move away from him, he or his friends would try to make me look at him or at least him come near me. Is it me? or is it that alot of people from Ern Leng's class knows about me being gay and having a crush on him? Oh well what ever it is. Soon my teacher came and opened the door to the art room. I put my bag there and went off to Mcdonalds.  &nbsp; When i was there i ate a HAPPY MEAL, well it did made me cheerful abit. After that i sat down and chatted with my band juniors, joked around and bitch around. Soon i had to go and went back to school for ART CLUB. I had to do a proposal for my art work. Sheesh! so many things to do when you have a project. I had to come out with more ideas for my art work. Walau! so many stuffs to do. Haiz... i just wish&nbsp;if i had&nbsp;boyfriend&nbsp;so that he&nbsp;can help me think of some ideas. After Art Club i went home and had a short nap. So now here i am typing this blog.  &nbsp; Haiz... i am a litte nervous because tomorrow is the  WOODLANDS RING MILITARY BAND INVESTITURE 2004: MOOZICA FANTASIA.  I have to be in school very early. After tml i am officially an Assistant Drum Major and Tuba Section Leader! AH! Well till her lah. Bubbye.

Well i can see the D but the A is not complete... hmph Maybe i should engrave Daniel's name on my arm...heheh I donno if Daniel will like it or not. Well during english class i felt like fainting because i did loose quiet a sum of blood. When i stood up to great Mr Bouncy Bruce... my head felt like no blood was going up there, my fingers felt as if there is no blood in there and my legs felt weak. Well during recess i pitied my friend, Syakilla, as her Cousin had just past away yesterday, May you rest in peace my dear brother.&nbsp;During band had a bad time but did have a little fun during&nbsp;break time. Had to shout here and there coz the band was too noisy. On the way back home with my juniors, i sang the national day song, HOME. So went home and rest for a while. Well what a typical day for me today. Well till here bubbye.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not know what has got into me today in school. Well i was practically out of my mind. I was confused, frustrated, irritated, lost, sad, angry, scared and mostly a lone. During CME lesson, i borrowed my friend's pen knife for the whole day. My friend kept asking me not to do so again but well during the whole day, i did it. This time i could not feel anything. There was no pain. I felt as if i am already dead but my soul is still in the body it self. Today i did only two small scars on my left hand. Well i just let the blood flow and not care about the amount of blood flowing out of my arm. I was totally out of my mind. Couldn't stop my self again. This time it wasn't about Ash. Its something else which i do not wish to say here. During english class, had to do a review. I did a movie review on  MONA LISA SMILE . Since there were a few technical difficulties in saving the project into a cd i decided to type out a script according to a few scenes in the movie. I played as the main character, Katherine Watson. Many applauded for me as i did a very good job in acting but when that Mr Bouncy Bruce gave the marks for my presentation he gave me a very low mark. I feel like throwing my text book at him and script at him. The effort i put in so much and dedication to do such thing was a waste. Stupid lah! next time i don't want to do group work anymore. Do the project as an individual. Now adays no one cares about me. My parents and i are still angry at me for going to school late, my stupid Malay teacher doesn't care what my reason was for not bringing the stupid Malay Storybook!, My friends in class&nbsp;did not stopped me from doing such stupid stuffs&nbsp;(so YAY! can do somemore!) and finally i am always being Neglected by alot. There is something i would like to stress to the guests who have been coming to my bloggy this past few days. If you know about this blog, this means you know about my secret so i would like you all to just  Keep Your Mouth Shut and Don't Mention About My Secret , to those who just joined in the fun well yes! I am GAY! You got a problem with me being  GAY?  Me being gay have not troubled your parents or your life right!? Well so just  SHUT YOUR MOUTH UP OK!  So what if everyone knows that i am gay but do you have to  SPREAD IT AROUND AND MAKE IT SO OBVIOUS?...  I think next time i hear some one saying me gay, i'll come up to that person and say it in his face. If the person beat me up,  BEAT ME UP TILL I DIE ALSO CAN I AM READY TO DIE ANYWAY SINCE NO ONE REALLY CARES ABOUT ME.   Well till here then... if you think this is too much well then wait for more of my entries ok. Bubbye.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;Woke up really super late for school,  WAY PAST MY WAKE UP TIME FOR SCHOOL! . My sister had switched off the alarm clock in my handphone when i was asleep. She used my handphone!. Woke up super late, 7:35am!, my mother knocked on my door so hard and she even took the key to my door and opened it with a loud bang. She shouted at me and scolded me. Still a little sleepy, i woke up. Irritated and angry because i was still recovering from that evil flu and fever. Luckily she had signed the two letters, one is my M.C. the other is an excuse from P.E. (which was today). So off i went to the bath room and took a shower. I got dressed for school and i took my time going to school, slow and steady. When i reached the school gate, it was still opened but no one there cause the lower sec has gone back to class and the upper sec went for assembly at the hall, and went up to Mrs Angelina Tan, Please! she is not Angelic ok! she is god dame fussy and evil! but yet i still like her cause she very nice to me hahaha :P, she just gave me a stare and said, "Late ah you today. Long time never see you late. Why were you absent from school yesterday? huh? ok... if the prefects stops you just say that you have reported to me and make sure you come for  Detention  straight after school.", i just nodded my head and took out my tie. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Went up the stairs while wearing my tie. My principle saw me walking towards the hall she just looked at me and just waved her little finger. I walked to the back of the hall and joined my class. The talk from the vice-principle was so super  BORING ! he was talking about  Why We Come To School?  and  What Is Nice About Coming To School?  and blah blah.  Man! So the boring!  After that was the usual lessons. Many in class were asking why i did not come to school yesterday and all but i just ignored. Nothing special happened during the curriculum time. Well after school i had an hour of Detention infront of the  Dicipline Commitee  room. Sat there and faced Mr Siva. He keeps glancing and whenever he does that i make a funny face or just smiles. He got irritated and took a large book and covered my face. Many of the other kids who were serving detention laughed. I peeked to the side of the book and stared at him, he took another book and covered me again. Many laughed. Hehe.. for the first time in my whole secondary school life i have made my main  DICIPLINE MASTER  irritated and laugh...hahaha.  &nbsp; After an hour of cheekiness i went for Band. Well since today's attendence was WAY better so everyone had occupied most of the space so i had to play my tuba while  STANDING.  Yes its heavy well its nice to play while standing cause i have this feeling that i am a  TUBA SOLOIST  hahah. Well i conducted Arioso terribely. Well you all got to understand i am bad in conducting ok so please give me some time to practice. After band i went to Mcdonalds and ate a large fries with my juniors. Had lots of ice cream, hahah already got fever still eating ice cream haha. After that i send them home, walking ok!, than i go home lor. So now i am here typing this blog while listening to  CATS THE MUSICAL!  heheh well till here k. Take care! Bubbye.

      I still&nbsp;taste fear of&nbsp;that night when Marchello had bought me.  I was cargo with a bunch of other kids from all those countries that had export their misery.   ...Story as i&nbsp;remember it, mostly feelings and impressions.  Like a painting with&nbsp;only colours, lights and no lines.   I remember the Ghetto called the cauldron.  Very sad, dark place where Marchello forced us to work  but i was lucky,&nbsp; i had a friend.   Frac was like no one else in the cauldron.  Hahah... He had a funny hat,&nbsp;creepy hair, a white face and&nbsp;rumored&nbsp;had said it was tattooed on his face but&nbsp;Frac said it was STAR DUST.  Hmph... he gave me hope but a dangerous thing hope is when you have nothing.   Frac was the kid i could not afford&nbsp;to be.  He was unpredictable, Deliriously happy one day&nbsp;Desperately sad&nbsp;the next.   In every city, there is a place&nbsp;like a cauldron where people like me and Frac end up.  Everything is bought and sold, where tourists go, like to&nbsp;a freak show, to view our misery and feel better about them self.   The tourist could afford everything, cruelty, tears, cheap drama.   All i found were swirling galaxies of memories in an empty room.  Frac had left without telling anyone not even me.   I never seen Frac like this.  Something in his eyes, something in the girl's eye, nothing can never be the same.   They were part of the circus coming to town, but to me they all look like they had&nbsp;come from different planets,&nbsp;E.T.s fallen to Earth discovering humans the first time.   "No Father i am sure of what i saw, how can it be possible?. A man and a child&nbsp;wanted to die. Maybe we could have helped?", Said the girl.   I should have&nbsp;had&nbsp;felt happy for Frac but i was angry, What did i care if he had fell in love instead of dyeing, if i were wasn't part of it. There was no place for me in his LOVE STORY.   -To be Continue-  *Please note that this quotes have something related to what i have to say but i wish not to as it between the special someone and me.   The Quotes above are taken from a film by Franco Dragone, taken from the production Cirque du Soleil: Alegria. Franco Dragone and Cirque du Soleil: Alegria Le Movie.

      You all might be wondering why did i write this blog so early and the title is that. To begin with i did not wake up very early today. I slept through my wake up time. I did not go to school because i am now not feeling very well. A bad flu, Fever and Headache. Nope i did not visit the doctor. My mother asked me to rest in bed and eat this weird pills. Haiz. Woke up as if an elephant is sitting on me. My head&nbsp;felt heavy&nbsp;like a rock. I miss school. I miss everyone in my class, except Bing Lin. This is all for now. Yeah short msg for today as nothing much is happening other then me being able to burn the kitchen down, clean my room, laze around and sleep. Thats all for now. Take care all. Bubbye.

      Yeah as you can see from the title above what happened yesterday. Firstly i would like to make a public apology to Daniel for last night. Daniel if you did come online last night and waited for me, i am sorry. My parents redecorated my room. Well at least its more spacious. By the time i got home it was already 12am and my father was still fixing a few stuffs to put the computer. I thought of calling you but instead i didn't because i scared later i call your mom pick up and scold me.  Sorry Daniel,  if you waited for me last night.   &nbsp; Ok here goes! haha. Well woke up really early in the morning, about 6 am, just to get ready a few stuffs like iron my clothes, packed my bags, shower, wore my clothes, cook breakfast, ate breakfast and so on. Everything was ready just in time for me to go to school for Band. I recieved a call from my instructor saying that he will be coming late as he is not feeling quiet not well and be visiting the doctor than he will pop by the band and see how things goes. After that, off i went to school in the rain.   &nbsp; Ok lets skip a few parts. The last part of the band schedule programe for that day was that ALL FOUR MAJORS have to conduct the band. I was already trembling because i have never conducted a band before. I went into the store room and pretended that i was conducting a band but instead i conducted a bunchfull of cockcroaches which were just flying from one end of the room to the other. When it was my turn to conducted, i shyly came to the conductor's stand (still shivering) and started to move my hand gracefully. My instructor helped me a little by telling me to imagine a dot in the air and keep hitting that dot, instead i used my friend's head as the dot hahah, there were a few times he stood behind me and hold my right arm asking me not to move my shoulder and keep my arm out and straight. I was conducting like a blind bat, just conduct any how hahaha.   &nbsp; After band i went home, while on the way home i caught up with my long lost friend, WEN XIN!, it was already 2years i have not talked to her and see her physically. We hugged and we talked alot. Tell each other story and all hahaha. Soon i had to go. Once i reached home i changed into my singlet and short pants. I decided to try out something different for my Circus act. For this past few months i have tried to do hand balancing. But yesterday's solo practice was a little successful because i managed to get my legs up in the air but then i tumbled over and hurt my butt and my ankle. Yay! now i can do Manupilation, Ladder, Spanish Web and Hand Balancing.   &nbsp; By the time i did that it was already 3:15pm. I quickly took my towel and had a shower. Got ready to meet my teacher, Mdm Anisah, to go to Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary for a cermics exhibition. I was kind of late. We alighted the bus and went straight to the school. Once there my teacher asked me and my friend to go up first as she had to use the toilet. Wah! greated and escoted by this girl. We entered this room, got air con so good!, and there is this potter on the wheel showed us how to make a few pots. He was quiet funny with all those jokes. Then there is this guy who sat next to me, he was from the school and he was quiet cute though. After that small class i went to the exhibition at the hall and decided to sketch a few of the pots there. Once done we all went to the forth floor and ate a few snacks. There were very little people there. Students leaders were seated at the back. The guy who sat next to me was there too. When i was done eating a few sushis the guy kept staring at me.&nbsp;I just like smiled at him and looked away. After that small snack i went and took&nbsp;a bus back to Admiralty Mrt Station. From there i went to take a train and headed towards Jurong.  &nbsp; When i reached Jurong, i recieved an sms from someone whom i do not recognised. Well i just ignored it. Then i went to Dover mrt to go to Anglo Chinese School (Independent) to watch a concert which Daniel is in. I was lost at first when i got out of Dover so i asked the lady at the passanger service counter, she said i had to take 74 from the right of the station. So off i went, down the stairs and waited for the bus. In the bus i was a little scared because i do not know where to alight. Luckily there were a few people going there. So i just follow the crowd haha. As i was entering the school. I got a little scared because i have never been to a school that is very big and has a boarding school.&nbsp;I have been to ACS before but that was at a different location. I was kind of worried and scared because there are alot of strangers around, hot, cute and muscular guys around and Daniel wasn't around. I had no ticket at that moment. Luckily i saw Daniel at the back and got my ticket from him. The Auditorium was really cold. It was&nbsp;like an ice box in there.   &nbsp; When the show started i was kind of excited because i have never been to a concert with chamber emsemble and guitar group. The show started with Choir, happy to see Daniel like walk from the side of the stage to his position. Hahah the strangest thing is that i sat the the right spot where every thing can be seen clearly. There were only like 3 other people who sat in the same row with me. I knew Daniel could see me because i could see him like looking at me. The strangest part was that when the choir boys sang the counters love to lean forward. They look as if they were going to fall!. Usually when i sang in my primary school choir, i have never like lean forward and sing with so much expression. Seeing Daniel sing it made me feel like he is a professional. He sang as if he was one Singapore Idol. haha. They all sang really nice. Only when the choir boys came out i would clap really loudly hahaha. After the boys sang, it was the chambers. From Violins till Bass. It was nice. But when the Guitar players played...i only enjoyed one song, forgot the title, there was this song which was really really really long. I almost feel asleep. After that was Choir again, YAY! get to see Daniel again, they sang. At first i thought it was going to end after the choir end because usually concert would be about 2hrs long but instead after the choir left, more songs are being played by the two other groups. "When is it going to end?", i said to my self. Luckily all three groups combined and sang together. Heheh it is fun to see Daniel sing. After the show the choir guys sang again, they sang a song from Lion King i think? no no...it was Animal Kingdom. I waited for Daniel quiet a LONG time after the show hahah. I saw Daniel's siblings after the show. They were like walking around and around and around waiting for him. I think what Daniel said was right. Daniel is younger looking that Titus hahah. Oh Daniel... i think You have a better body that Titus. I like Daniel's playful little brother... so cute! he like climbed up this smooth slope like Spiderman hahah. So cute! Daniel came out from no where after the long wait. hahah. We sat down and talked for a few minutes. He seems to be in a rush. I paid him, i owe him teb bucks coz he paid my tickets. But too bad Titus came and called him to go. Well then i too went off home all alone. Hahah. At least i enjoyed my day.  &nbsp; Came home SUPERLY TIRED. After a good warm shower. I went to sleep.  Well that all for now. Kinda long winded hahaha. Well take care all. Bubbye.

        Hey guyz. I would like to apologise to everyone for the lack of updates. I have been really busy with my life, like school, exams, self-training and etc. Its been a tough week. I had fun and laughter, angst and sadness, love and depression for this few days. What such fun. Well thank god there is such thing as National Day! yay! There is no school on Monday and Tuesday! I love National Day, i just love to feel and smell of unity in everyone of us, just like waking up in a bed full of nice smelling flowers and not a room full of smelly socks. hahah.    Yesterday had half day of school, so everyone was dismissed early. I came to school just in time. I caught up with the other band majors and some of the percussion members. The School's Uniform Group had a National Day Marching Parade and the Band was not in the Parade as we are packed in schedule so they asked for a few members from the percussion section to play the marching beat. I helped out in carrying the chairs and instruments, thats why i wasn't there during USSR (aka reading period). The majors and i stood at the DnT block as if we were part of the parade. Many eye balls were staring at us when we stood in attention. Well we had fun commenting the peeps that were in uniform. After all those shouting from the Parade Commander, the number of us went back into the music room to keep the instruments. We were in there for queit sometime. When i carried the Bass Drum into the music room, i felt some one touched my shoulder and the touch faded away at my elbow. I turned both sides but there was no one there. I just ignored it, thought it was the wind. Once all instruments was kept, i played at the electrical piano. I played a part from the Phatom of the Opera song. While playing i felt someone holding my waist but it soon faded away when i turned back, which practically there was no one behind me. I got abit scared. Soon Syazwanie and Mei Hui sat at the computer table and did some paper work. All of the sudden the sliding key board desk moved out, not a small distance but a large distance with a force! They shouted and asked us to leave the room quickly. Within a minute we were out. Scared and shocked. We can't stopped thinking of it. "Ai yo! The Hand has returned!", shouted my senior. We were shocked that there was a ghost in our school. He told us that the first batch of seniors, who had graduated a long time ago, had slept in the music room. Some said they saw a white figure floating across the room and some said that they felt a deteched hand walked across their body. We were spooked when we heard that. For the rest of the day, the three of us were traumatised. Well okie lets skip the whole afternoon and go on. Well okie after all that spookness, i went home had a long rest and had a self gymnastic training which was kind of a success. After that i went to meet Daniel at his school. I was kind of worried because he had told me that he would call me before the day it self but he did not call me. When i was just two bus stops away from his school he called me. Well we met up yesterday was to watch AC Superstar, something like Singapore Idol lor. I waited for him for about 20-35 mins. The show started a little late thought, so its kinda lucky heheh. The show was okie, i like the audition videos, really funny. Then there was a 10mins break, i had to use the toilet so i asked Daniel to show me where was it. After that he guided me through his school. Very big and dark leh the school. Very good for any night activities, haha. The Library is really big! Well we had to go up this really dark stair case, its pitched dark in there... its hard for me to see as i am not used to the place. My right hand had the urge to hold Daniel's hand but i controlled my self. hahaha. (Thanks Daniel for the school tour.  I will show you my school one day, if there is a such day hahah.) I remembered those words from my friends, " Don't forget to give him a good kiss if you are in the dark." I decided not to kiss him because i don't know what will be his reaction and somemore we have discussed about a few issues so i am kind of confused if i should just move on with life a lone or be with someone else. Well after the tour, we went back to the auditorium. The host said that lucky 500 peeps can vote for their idol and the voting paper is under the selected chairs. When Daniel searched under his, there was one (lucky him), but mine did not have. Well this nice prefect/usher guy asked me if i wanted the voting paper as there is one under his, i just nodded my head like a small miniture noddy toy haha. I voted really strictly as i think non of the singers have good voice. I love the Evil Judge, i support him all the way with his bad comments. There is this guy from the live band, he played a variety of Saxs! so good!. Well after all those nonsence. Daniel showed me around the school again. He showed me his boarding school, the field, the tracks, the seats, the pool and lots more. He wanted to show me which toilet he had done it but i just acted clueless. We sat down and chatted for a while and waited for his mom to pick him up. He told me not to let his mom see me as his mother is a bit racist. (sorry Daniel if i had to use that word... i am experiencing Racism in my life now.) I waited for a few minutes till his mom went off. Once they were gone, i reluctently waited for the bus. Went home all alone again and another hour of my life passed in travelling back and forth. I am used to all this as i used to totally spend 2hrs and 50mins of my life going back and forth from woodlands to sengkang via train just to meet HIM but luckily there is a bus that goes directly there.  ---------------------------------------------------------  Today-   Well woke up early to go to school today as i have Band today. Did the usual stuffs and all, after band we recieved a new percussion instrument, i forgot its name hahah. Well after that i went home and rested for a while till 6:30pm. I had to go for a meeting with my TEATER VARIASI friends. Well after the meeting, Hamzah told me and Rashid that we are now going to be part of the next production and will be made official once we fill in this form and paste our ugly faces on the form with a passport sized photo. Had fun and all. Well happy now that i am going to act in a new production which will be premiering Next YEAR! COOL!  Well till here lah. I gtg and sleep. Really superbly tired. Take care and Hugs and Kisses to all. Bubbye.

        It has been 2weeks i have tried to do this but i just seem i couldn't stand it today. Two whole weeks!, trying my best not to notice Ern Leng but i couldn't today because i saw something detailed and it made me go so happy and high. The something is his crotch. Yeah! ok ok this maybe weird but Ern Leng is rated #1 in my Top#10 cutest/hottest Sec 3 guys in WRSS! Usually i don't get to see that small detail because its either he covers it with his bag/books or just hides well his dick. It was nice and round, means to say...  NICE SET OF BALLS AND DICK!  :p.  I was looking around for Mdm Anisah when his class had to go, sadly she was standing behind the guy of my dream and my eyes naughtily caught those nice round balls of his and nice set of butt. I was already melting at that time. It all came to a stopped when he went off. I did not see him again till recess.    During Recess, i did not eat my usual staple food but instead had a snack (STICKOs! i love them nice chocolate love letters! hahah). I was a little too lonely because i had no one to be with and talk to. My bestfriend, Rashid, was with his usual bitchy gang, Azah was with her friends, my little sister was a told to do duty in the hall and others were to busy gobbling their food. Well so i decided to walk around the school. Till i needed to talk to Syazwanie. I knew i could always find here where she will always be, which is just right out side the canteen of course...near the field. That is where Ern Leng love to be with his other friends, who are some in my top ten cutest/hottest Sec 3 guys in WRSS. When i went to ask Syazwanie something, He was already there. I knew he was there but i tried to ignore him, which i couldn't because he was looking at me. Syazwanie and her friends were squatting down on the ground like top secret agents discussing something secret till i felt that someone was look over me, i poked my head up to the left...no one was there...turned my head to the right... i saw Mr Koh Ern Leng look at me. Once i got sight of him, he quickly turn away.    "What is up with that cute guy? Does he know that i have a crush on him? Is it too obvious that i have a crush on him? Why is he looking at me in that way? Why when i try to ignore him, he tries to get close to me, and when i try to get close to him, he tries to ignore me. What kind of Cat and Mouse game is this? Oh! i just wish he is gay. He is so cute! so adorable! so kind! so smart! but abit on the anti-social side. Haiz...", i said that in my heart everytime when i see him.     In the hall i couldn't decide to sit at first i was wanting to sit infront but then i changed my mind to sit at the back because i wanted to hand in the form to Mdm Anisah. Suddenly i bumped into, Yup!, Ern Leng. I apologised softly and walked away quickly with out look at him. I was facing the ground all the while. My face was totally  RED!  When i sat down i tried to look around for Mdm Anisah but couldn't because she was not in the hall. I could see Ern Leng face was a little red, maybe its my imagination.    After school, i went to Eliza's class, which is the same class with Ern Leng of course. At that when i entered, sadly Ern Leng was getting ready to go off. I came into the class and asked around my friends to walk home with me. I did not look or peek at Ern Leng's face when i entered and when he left. Sadly i just wish, just  WISH!  one day that he would just one day say Hi to me. If that were to happen, my heart is going melt and i am going to faint!, but oh well... it won't happen in a  MILLION  years.    All this while i have been thinking of  Ern Leng, Ern Leng, Ern Leng and more of KOH ERN LENG!  He is  god dame superbly scrumptiously deliciously fabulously gayishly CUTE! Man!  that was long description of him hahaha. Well just hope one day, One day... i will be able to talk to that nice guy and take a photo of him. So far i have made step one! try to be friends with his friends ... hehehehe :P... well so far only one. Hahah.

       Yep! Its that day again the band. Investiture of course. Well had to wake up at 7am in the morning and be in school by 7:30am to open the band room. While i was in the band room i had to push the HEAVY PIANO, carry the unwanted stuffs and carry all the percussion instruments out first before i could ask the band to set up the chairs in the formation i wanted. One by one the members arrive, some excited and some simply sleepy. I ordered everyone around, i too did work along with them ok. When everyone had settled down, the majors (including me) went through the pieces that are supposed to be played to day. The first song was Somerset March (conducted by Mei Hui), Cha cha for band (conducted by Shazwani), Latin Gold (conducted by Mei Hui again), Big Fun in the sun (Shazwani again) then its Best Friend/Kiroro (conducted by Grace) and Arioso (conducted by me). Once done, the HR (human resource) and i went to decorate the music room while everyone went for an hour of lunch at around 11:30am till 12:30pm. Some parents had already arrive early but they waited out side the band room. I had to shout alot today as most did not listen. When everything was ready, the members settled down and the parents came in. Most were happy as their parents/boy-or-girlfriend/friends are there to support them, as for me...haiz... for the past 3years... non had supported me...neither my parents nor bestfriends did. Well we played the song as pernormal, then boring speeches, then the giving of certificates. When the majors were announced, i was first of course, many went cat calling us all while we get our certs. After the investiture, i had to ask a few members to stay in the music room to clean up with me while the rest of them went to eat. Once that was done i went out to eat, with an empty stomach, i went searching for food but luckily got a big left. At last i had a boost of Carbohydrates. We had fun talking and all. Then my band friends, including my instructor, decided to go to Dhoby Ghaut to have a walk and have fun. I followed them as they asked me to come along. During the journey i fell asleep as i was SUPERBLY TIRED after all that pushing the heavy piano alone, carrying tables and chairs, scream and shout, run here and there and invite the parents. Haiz. We went to a music store and found alot of percussion accessories there, then we went to THE SECRET GARDEN (a cafe, bistro and bar). My instructor had a beer and i had non hahah. After that my instructor called his friend for a tickets to this concert at the Esplanade by Nanyang Technology Symphonic Band with guest band by Philharmonic Winds. The original price of the tickets are between $22-$55 and we had the tickets for just $4. Cheap eh?.. haha. The band was superb!... I love them man! They played Miss Saigon, Trumpet Concerto in Eb Major-Finale, Highlights from Chess, Symphony No.5 Finale, A Reminiscence of Musicals, Fiddler on the Roof, The Wizards of Oz (got tuba solo! SO GOOD!), Les Miserables and Singapore Cancer Society Theme Song. They had a special guest singers, Amy Cheng and Darren Seah. Everything was superb! Its a fund raising concert for your information. Well i went back home with them, reached here at home at 1am. Wow! been away from home for more 18hours! so tired man! had to walk around in my Band Uniform and Marching Shoes, which is really aching if walk in it at a very long distance or a long time. Many were staring at me in the concert all, i just spoke to my self, "There is no Dress Code mah going to this concert.".. hahah. --------------------------------------------------  Reply to Daniel- Well Daniel, sometimes i can get lil pissed off at times. You are lucky that its just stage one of my 'Pissiness'. I will get really pissed of if i am  SUPERBLY BORED, IRRITATED and ANGRY . And hope you don't do that lor cause something bad might really happen lor.  Thats ok lah...Haiz... NO ONE is there for me one... but i am ALWAYS there for everyone... No one supports me but i support them... haiz... Sick and tired of that... just wish someone can be there for me most of the time...as i always be there for him most of the time ... haiz... FUCK LAH!... hehehe... lil bit pissed off now. :P

       Man! its so stupid man! Why does MOE have to send one of the Normal (Academic) class to visit ITE? We should visit Poly! or maybe a JC! Man! My goal in education is to go from Primary school to Secondarys School then go to either La Salle SIA, Shatec or Temasek Poly. Once that is over, i wanna work and have enough money for me to migrate to Canada. Once i am there, i wanna live with my sister and school in a Circus school once i graduate, i wanna join Cirque du Soleil!   Luckily i reached school JUST IN TIME. Straight after the reading period we board the bus. Some were allowed to buy some food. I did went to buy some food. Just a few sandwiches and burgers. Off we went to the stupid place. ITE - Its The End! i don't wanna go there after my secondary school education! haiz. But the chinese guys there are superbly cute though. Firstly had a boring! and long briefing about the program and school. MAN! its so boring. Then after his talk we went around the school! saw many cute guys around but NAH! i am still not coming to this institution! Then we had our tea break. Haiz... we watched a Mr Bean movie, i laughed so fakely. Then off we went to do our projects. haiz... It was kinda fun to play with the air pressure thing.. but abit too scary lah...but even though its fun.. because its like a puzzle and i love puzzles. Then we went for another break and came back doing this musical door bell. STUPID lah this part... just plain stupid. Then we all went home. YAY!   Reached school and off went to band. Well played a few scales and so on... checked out my tuba so that i can bring it home, because i wanna play Second Suite in F Major!. Then before dismissing the band.. i had to fall them in and command them. Well everyone was given 10push ups. Then i dismissed them. After that i drag my tuba to macdonalds, waited for Eddy. When Eddy and his friends came, they stood around me. I cried abit, because I do like Eddy alot but i dono if he likes me or not. He looked at me like as if he is my boyfriend. Then i went in and sat alone.  I bought a fries... then went off without telling him.  Tats all for now lah. Haiz... tired lah. Tml visiting ITE Yishun again..haiz...

       Well woke up late today. I was hoping that i got chance to arrive to school just in time but instead i was late.  Well yeah, after the reading period there will be a spot-check of bags. Well i was hoping only bags, but they check my wallet too! wallets are not ment to be checked! its personal! stupid Mr Roy. Luckily i hid the condom at my back pocket but wasn't lucky, he checked it and found my condom!... no fair! Good bye condom. Then he handed it to Mr Appolos, then i and Appolos went to talk. He asked me stupid questions. I lied to him and he believed me. Hahah! Well he gave me this Student's Statement paper and ask me to write what, why and how i got the condom. Well planned, i lied in the statement. The last part said, "Its up to you to believe me or not." When he read that part, he asked me this stupid question and i just stopped him and said, "Curiosity killed the cat." He just kept quiet. Haha! Oh well... i am sure a bad boy now. I even dared him to look into my records to see if i have any bad record, well guess what... i am right after all... i do not have any bad records and Mr Appolos was surely surprised when i turned into a rotten tomato. Haha! Oh well. After school i went for Detention for being late. Then went home. And here i am. Well Please do not adjust your computer. There is no ghost of S Club 7 okie... its this new link  that allows your blog to be like a radio! cool eh! Well all thanks to Daniel ^_^ ... thanks Daniel. MUACKS!. Oh if those of you who love this song and forgot the lyrics... go to the bottom of this page and there you can find this over flowing words... those are the lyrics. Well thats all for now. Bubbye.

       The smell of Sunday morning is wonderful. Walked out of my room and saw my nieces and nephews watching Teen Titans on Kids Central. I laid down beside them, still sleepy, and watched tv with them. Fell asleep next to them, suddenly my mom shouted in my ear, "Den! You must come along today! We need you to help us take care of the babies!". I woke up instantly. Go out? ai yah.. i was thinking of going out with my friend, Adrian, oh well.  So off i went, took my towel and went to shower. Got ready and all, took my handphone from my sister not realising that my handphone battery was flat! MAN! i can't sms people! no fair!   It was hard, carrying them around, chasing after them. This rugrats are really naughty. Yet i still love them because they are so  CUTE!  We went to Changi Airport. Luckily go there. Its so spacious and its freedom for the this babies as they love to run around like dogs chasing after cats. Many facilities have changed. It has been 5months i did not visit the airport. Hahah. Well its great to see the changes and more  HOT Guys  in uniform walking around the airport. Oh man! those tight pants are revealing those nice butts and balls. haha! We went to eat at the food court at Terminal 2. There was this American guy, he kept looking at my babies as if he wants to kidnap them. I looked at him in the eye and smiled at him, he just smile back and turn away. After that we had a long walk around the airport. My parents were free to walk like a couple, as for me... its was torture! The babies were running around in circles! They would climb on me, pull my pants (luckily i wore a belt), pulled my shirt and hair! They ran here and there. Hugged my legs and tried to stop me from walking! My nephew even slapped my head while he was sitting on my shoulders! My poor hair! hahaha. At least i had fun.   After that we went home. I slept in the train like a baby. I woke up a few station before my destination. The guy, i think he is 23yrs... he looks like tat what, was staring at my rainbow tag on my neck. When i saw him staring at it, i took it out and kept it. Then i took out my new rainbow wrist band!, he giggled abit and nudged me. I was wondering what for did he nudged me?. Did he want my number? why? oh well, he wasn't that good looking. Haha. When i alighted, he shouted good bye. I turned back, he winked at me. I just blushed away.   I took a really short nap when i got home. When i woke up, i went online. Went to Mirc and chatted at  Sgboy  and  GAM  chatroom. My friend was there. I chatted to him, all of the sudden he asked me this question.  F:"Btw. U r seeking Friends, Chat and LTR rite?" Me:"Yeah. Why?" F:"Well...for this past few days. I have been thinking. I am asking this sincerely okie. Will you accept me as your boyfriend?" Me:"O.O! are you sure? look we just know each other for like what 2days and you already ask me that question. I would like to get to know you better before i can decide whether i can accept you as my boyfriend or not lor. Maybe we can go out one day or what and talk. Sms each other." F:"Oh okie. I know i am a bit older then you by 3years. Well okie lor...when can we meet? tml?" Me:"Tml? well tml i can't i am meeting my new gay boy - friend. Not boyfriend okie... a GAY - BOY friend. I will sms you when i am free okie?" F:"Okie"     *F - is my friend. I renamed him. *Me - is me lah! then you think what. Mee Maggie?... siao.     Yeah. I am going out tml to meet my new friend, Hafiz. He is 15 too and lives near by, Sembawang only hahah so near. We are just going out and have lunch and all thats all. I don't know what is up in Hafiz's mind lah but all i know is just go out and 'Jalan-Jalan' hahah. I don't know lah... whether to accept him as my boyfriend or not, who knows this Hafiz guy might want me to be his boyfriend... but my mind is set on someone already... AH SO CONFUSED! i didn't know picking the guy is stressful! Wah! like the  Reality Tv Show on BRAVO TV:  Boys meets Boys .    Well till here lah. I gtg. Take care all.. bubbye and hugs and kisses!
