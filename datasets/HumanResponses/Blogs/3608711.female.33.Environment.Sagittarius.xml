      I've been having strange dreams lately about a "first love". I used to always dream about him and after he got married the dreams went away but now I've been dreaming about him at least 2 nights a week.   In the past the dreams would have me trying to phone him and I'm not able to because the numbers on the phone weren't right, or else I kept miss dialing the phone - all examples, I figured, that I really wanted to talk to him, but really shouldn't. Then last night I actually got through on the numbers, talked to someone, and almost talked to him, but didn't, then later on in the dream he came and visited me. What's that supposed to mean?  Yes there are unresolved issues with him - like I still have strong feelings for him - that I've been working on - by not contacting him - but how do I get rid of these dreams? They are unsettling and un-productive when I am working on trying to get him out of my mind! Like the song says - I've got to get you out of my mind!  What to do? What to do? Perhaps alcohol will take him off my mind! Tanya

      I spent the weekend scrapbooking at Mom's house. It was great to create something. I have had this unsettling feeling in me that I couldn't lose. I think it is because I haven't been creating anything. No knitting, no scrapbooking, not even creating a list.   Well, Saturday morning I got up and decided that I was going to make something. I wish my scrapbook supplies were at my house all organized, that way I'd be able to jump right in (but then again, would I?). When I got to Mom's I sat down and thought for a moment and then started to work on a little travel quote book for my secret sister in California. It only took about 3 hours and it worked out so well that I began to create one for Melissa. That one worked out so well that I had to create a duplicate one (almost the same - only this one I refined) for myself. That last one took me 5 hours to complete and it was only 6:00 pm on Sunday night so I spent another hour making a few more cards.   I am happy to report that the unsettling feeling is abated for the moment, but now my creative juices are awake. I need to play with paper, beads and or cotton!   Other stuff:   Jason and Crystal and Amelia are going to Alberta - horray.   I am still undecided if I should go to the Walk to End Breast Cancer. I know I was all hyped up for it, but now I've lost that enthusiasm. I don't know if its the fact that I still have to raise the $1900 or if its that I haven't been training or if I feel a little left out of the group with the others having the crop and not even sharing that information with me - I don't know. I still have a few more days of my self imposed deadline left so I will still sleep on it. I will decide.  That's all for now. Back to work. Tanya

      How do you write "about me" with out it sounding like a personnal ad? How do you make it sound original? I always have a problem with describing myself.   Am I just to say that I am 33 - I work with my family in our family business? I love cats and have a few of them? I love scrapbooking and beaded knitting? Why can't I think of something more interesting than the sum of where I work and what I like to do? I will have to think about it. But until then.....  I am 33 years old. I do work with my Brother and Father in our Family Business of Waste Oil Recycling. I run the front office and do pretty much everything concerning running an office. We are a small business that has been struggling since we began, but its all a learning curve. I enjoy working with Dad and Jason. Sometimes the stress gets to be a bit much, but what can you do? I guess if I wanted an easier job - I would work elsewhere. And truth be known, although it is difficult to work day in and day out with your family - it is something that not many families experience. It makes you stronger that's for sure. I'll talk about that more when it becomes an issue.  I do have a few cats. I started out with one in 1992 and through the simple act of loving animals and looking out for their welfare, I now have 7. It may sound like alot, but when you adopt a brother and 2 sisters, your numbers grow quite quickly! 6 of my cats are rescued. I am a foster mom (was actually - I can't foster anymore because I keep on keeping them!) and when the cats came into my home, I grew attached to them. The 3 siblings would not have been adopted together. Not many people can handle adopting all 3 and I could so I did! They are very attached to each other and separating them would have not been in their best interest. My newest addition was found jsut 2 weeks ago and he was only 2.5 months old. He weighs a mere 1/2 pound. He has settled in quite comfortably with the others.   I'll try to post more photos later once I get the hang of it.  Well, I guess I should get back to work again. Not a lot of time to sit and work on the computer for myself!

      Well - this is my personal space to post my news about life in general. Don't have much to say right now as I am at work and I have to see how this whole thing works. I'll be back later!
