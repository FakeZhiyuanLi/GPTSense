      beautiful, intense, mysterious, dark, calm, gentle, happy, love-ridden, sensual, erotic, sexy, cute, adorable, gorgeous, powerful, smart, Italian;), smooth, warm, stiff, wet, sweaty, muscular, broad, soft, feathery, silky, yummy, insane, goof (lol), fun, lovely, mine, etc.  Oh so many adjectives to describe him but you can never know how wonderful he really is. I know, but I dont know the depths to which it goes, the depths to which I love him or the intensity that can be felt when we make love to each other. Theres so much we dont know, but I dont want to stop until I can at least feel the slight vibrations that truth and potential send off. If he should end it before then I will most definately regret that I didnt try harder to keep him, to find out, to discover myself buried within us.  Theres a little Sam in everyone, does that scare you? It terrifies me to be honest. The world doesnt need more people like me but I guess it cant be helped. I was going to say that the world needs more Rem's, but then he wouldnt be as amazing as he is because there would be so many of the same types of people. I have the one and only copy and I dont plan on losing it any time soon, especially to the likes of some skeletal bitch who thinks she can tell me what my life is about. I really feel like some Alexis and some Death. Later Days and much love.  .:Sam:.

      Nothing sounds right, right now. I cant find music to match this mood. I feel new, found, clean, cold, crisp... a new dollar bill if you will... or a 10 or 20 seeing as how we dont have 1's here in good ol Canada... I've lost some weight, I've been kinda sick for the past couple days, crying and all... not being able to keep down food for long, not being hungry, not getting enough sleep, not being able to take care of myself well enough. Maybe unconciously I have been telling myself I am not thin enough and havent been eating basically at all... I really dont know because I dont know how my mind works. All my muscles hurt, I need an all over massage. Masochistic and makes you tingle when its done. Speaking of which, I think I have lost all desire to cut myself. ALL DESIRE. It's disgusting... I was disgusting for doing it. It hurts now, it doesnt feel good anymore... it just hurts... Bleeding isnt as beautiful anymore. I am listening to Champagne Supernova and the sounds of the water at the beginning make me miss the ocean so much. I want to see it again... so very soon. I want to go with Rem and just make love by the ocean... I just want to get on a bus with him and disappear... not tell anyone where we are going and just wander and be in love. I want us to be happy where ever we are but I dont want to be here. I just want us to be together, to belong to each other but not be mere possesions. I want to love him like he deserves. I love Rem North with all that I am. .:Sam (aka. Crazy in love.):.

       I'm sorry I didn't sound more excited on the phone   I'm sorry that after all these yearsI've left you feeling unrequited and alone,    brought you to tears   I guess I never loved you quite as well    as the way you loved me   I guess I'll never really be able to tell you   how sorryI am   And I don't know what it is about you   I just know it's not what it was   I don't know why red fades before blue it just does   and I don't know what it is about me   that I just can't keep still   I keep thinking someday I will make this all up to you   and maybe someday I will   I guess I never loved you quite as well   as the way you loved me   I guess I'll never really be able to tell you how sorry   I am   sorry I am   sorry I am   sorry I am

      Sam, WOW! Who knew you were this much of a fuck up. No really, who does this? Who toys with someone they love? You are one low human being to fuck around on someone who was so good to you. Way to make him wait for a response when everyone knows you want him, your just too busy being a whore and fucking other people who will never amount to half the person Rem is. Did you not see it Sam? I'm sure you did because you freaked out and had an attack again. He doesnt love you like he used to, his eyes hold pain and hatred. Maybe not hatred for you entirely, but for the whore in you. You should have ur throat and wrists slit and be hung upside down from your ankles. Your face should be sand papered down to the bone to match the ugliness inside you. You should have a Drain-o milkshake and burn from the inside out. I think your best bet for now is a deep gash from elbow to wrist, that we can do. You want to see yourself bleed for the pain you cause, then lets do that... in fact why not now? I bled for days- Static X... song of the moment. Along with I am Hated - Slipknot. .:Not Quite Yourself Today:.

       -"You write such pretty words, but lifes no story book, loves an excuse to get hurt and to hurt. Do you like to hurt?"   "I do, I do."   "Then hurt me."- Bright Eyes, Lover I Don't Have to Love.      Dearest,    Sorry has been so over used that I dont think it has meaning anymore to anyone, so I've been looking for a word that means something more then a mere apology for something trivial. To be honest, I didnt come up with much so I'll just write what I'm feeling and hope you understand.    I wont take back what I said in the last post, because its what I've been thinking about and I don't want to lie to you by saying I don't actually mean it. It's not that our relationship isn't fun and what not, it's just that we're so serious about each other that it's not going to go well. Say if I wanted to get high with BJ, I'm sure that wouldn't go over too well, and I get uber jealous when you say you're even hanging out with  Lauren, even though I know nothing happens. Who knows, maybe I am just being stupid and us being this crazy for each other will make our relationship better then if we were just meaningless. Which ever it is, I still want to be with you, more then anything, but I have set a deadline for myself, because unfortunately, I cant wait much longer.                                                        Love you more then ever,                                                                         .:Sam:.

       I'm just making memories. Thats my motto, thank you Grant for that little sentence there. I live, I don't think. I leap before I look. To quote Rhiannon... "Highschool relationships are supposed to be both fun and meaningless. When your with Rem, your niether." So, today I am more then confused. To go for someone new, who I can be retarded with ("You're not retarded, just slower then the other kids"... lol BJ.) or to wait for a guy that I love. It's a hard decision as easy as it should be. God, Rem I hope you are not reading this. I kind of feel ridiculous for even thinking about giving up on the thought of me and Rem... its hard because I know I am impatient and that I will be a bit worried because he cheated on Lauren, and I will always be a bit self concious around him because he didnt break up with her sooner.    Can't talk right now... I just like snapped into a pseudo good mood. Later days.   .:Sam:.

       The words I cannot bring myself to say.   Dearest,   I am not good enough for the worst of you, but I know that in reality we are both magnificantly equal. I am no greater then your beauty and you are no better then my cuteness. We were cut from a corresponding cloth, maybe you have yet to realize it, or maybe you think you match better with the threads in which she was weaved. Maybe I lost my initial gleam, or maybe the tin can telephone wire was severed (lol). I am wondering how we got this far... why it didnt just end after sex. There has to be something here and I am trying my hardest to keep it but your holding us down, so if you really want to be with me then prioritize. I love you more then you can know, because if you did the world would have to be limitless.                                                                  - I will love you always and forever.    .:Sam:.

       It's ridiculous how mixed up I am right now. I feel so unteathered... I should be grounded because gravity is like that, but I am the only one floating... and I dont know how to control myself. The whole Rem situation is killing me, it honestly is. It's getting harder and harder to take... He says he is going to break up with Lauren, but I dont think he is going to any time soon. I just feel like he doesn't really want to be with me because if he did he wouldn't still tell her that he loves her, and he wouldn't be with her still... and I wouldn't still be the "other girl". I love him too much to let him go right now... I'm too stubborn, but I am also really impatient. For now, I am going to wait it out... I have some faith in good luck, though I dont ever nearly deserve him.  Time for some Fiona Apple song quotes...  "Love ridden, I’ve looked at you With the focus I gave to my birthday candles I’ve wished on the lidded blue flames Under your brow And baby, I wished for you Nobody sees when you are lying in your bed And I wanna crawl in with you But I cry instead I want your warmth, but it will only make Me colder when it’s over."  "I’ll just use your simple name Only kisses on the cheek from now on And in a little while, we’ll only have to wave My hand won’t hold you down no more The path is clear to follow through I stood too long in the way of the door And now I’m giving up on you."  Ah, the simplicity of pain and the complications that ensue. PS. Had a spectacular birthday. Shared it with the two people I would die for, the two people I live for.  Have a great day, much Love. .:Sam:.

        I don't feel much emotions right now, I guess I am content with how I feel.   I miss Rem a ridiculous amount. He went away for the weekend, to the cottage. He's probably having a really great time, getting high and hanging out with his friends and shit. I'm semi- jealous of his freedom right now.        I went to Wonderland today. I was never big on amusement parks, I get sick easily. Rhiannon and I both got a bit nauseous, but mine was mostly from the bus ride to Toronto. I realized just how much I shouldn't be allowed coffee, and how much I love rollercoasters, but no one would go with me on Tomb Raider, which is a new rollercoaster, and no one would go on Top Gun with me, or Cliffhanger. I was upset. I know if Rem would have been there I would have went on all three of those.      I feel sick and achy. My back muscles are killing me and missing Rem this much is crazy, its making me sick. I need to sleep most likely. I can't wait until Rem gets home... its insane how much I love him and how amazing he is.      There is a serious lack of adjectives to describe just how he is so incredible. Quite possibly, love is blinding me from things that could possibly end up being an issue, but right now I dont want to have to worry about those things and just love him like I do. Which brings to mind how difficult I am making things for him sometimes. I guess I just subconciously test peoples love and trust because everyone always bails when things get difficult for me... there has never been anyone who has always been there for me... Rem and Rhiannon have been there for the hardships I have gone through recently and I can only hope I will have them for a long ass time... life without them just doesnt sound like living... right now, they are my life. They keep me sane, healthy and stable. It's bad to depend on people but they are helping me out alot.      My eyes itch for sleep. Night.     .:Sam:.

        If I asked you to create me, would you? Or am I already a masterpiece? I guess it's all about the angle you look at it from. From the darkness I can look so beautiful, and from a distance so perfect, but when you get up close I am nothing but scribbles, and when you bring me into the light, I am hideous. I want to think of myself right now, as a blank canvas. I want to be something new. I don't want to be a different person, I just want to be better. I'm sure this is making no sense, but it's all part of the process I suppose. I just know so many beautiful people, and living in a house so full of ugliness has to be having an effect on me and that's a scary thought. I can't allow myself to be like my family.  Today, Rem told me to download this amazing song by Emiliana Torrini, called "If You Go Away", and I completely fell in love with this girl. She has this otherworldly sound to her voice. Its gorgeous. Then I realized I had heard one of her songs in the movie "Crazy/Beautiful", which was a terrible movie but had a killer soundtrack. That was the song "To Be Free" and MY GOD I AM IN LOVE WITH HER! I am obsessed with beauty right now, so I have listening to such pretty songs and looking at poetry and art. Maybe I am going about this the wrong way, but the way I see it, if I surround myself with it, it will inspire me to become it.  People are distracting me and I lost my train of thought...  Just to sum up my entry, I have included the lyrics to "If You Go Away".  Emiliana Torrini - If You Go Away If you go away On this summers day Then you might as well Take the sun away All the birds that flew In the summer sky When our love was new And our hearts were high And the day was young And the nights were long And the moon stood still For the night bird's song  If you go away (x3)  But if you stay I'll make you a day Like no day has been Or will be again We'll sail on the sun We'll ride on the rain And talk to the trees And worship the wind  But if you go I'll understand Leave me just enough love To fill up my hand  If you go away (x3) If you go away As I know you will You must tell the world To stop turning 'til you return again If you ever do For what good is love Without lovin’ you? Can I tell you now As you turn to go I'll be dying slowly 'til the next hello  If you go away (x)  But if you stay I'll make you a night Like no night has been Or will be again I'll sail on your smile I'll ride on your touch I'll talk to your eyes That I love so much  But if you go I won't cry Though the good is gone From the word goodbye  If you go away (x3)  If you go away As I know you must There is be nothing left In this world to trust Just an empty room Full of empty space Like the empty look I see on your face And I'd have been the shadow Of your shadow If it might have kept me By your sideIf you go away (x5)

       I am ridiculously upset right now. I feel like a dark grey smear on a white wall. All the pain caused by family. Oh, Mother Dearest, why don't you just fucking choke to death?   My reason for being so hostile: my mother will not allow me to see Rem anymore, due to the fact that one of her "friends" told her that I was seen with Rem buying condoms. Not only that, but she also seems to think that Rem is not only having a sexual relationship with me, but with his current girlfriend, Lauren, and my best friend, Rhiannon.    Is it bad of me to want to kill both my parents, to hate the people that gave me life so much that it's tearing me down? Do they even realize what they put me through and what they have done to me over the years? Is it bad to want to be away from them so much that in 4 days I am leaving this house with no money and no place to stay? I know that no one really "likes" their parents, but honestly. Call it teen angst if you must.   You would think my mother would get used to the fact that I am a sexually active individual and not try and ban me from the guy I love. She already knows I have had sex and I am on the pill... GET OVER IT.    When I even bring up the fact that I was depressed, she blames it on my friends and on Kurt. I can explain to her hundreds of times that losing Kurt really meant nothing to me. I was more upset when leaving Myrtle Beach for crying out loud! And when I talk about why I dont like my father, she doesn't listen and she blames my friends, saying they dont like there fathers and I am just being a follower. Is it my fault that my father likes to get violent with me and see how fucking terrified of him I can become? I sure as hell hope that it's not my fault. Who knows, maybe I deserve all this. Maybe I dont deserve to have friends, to have Rem, love or an escape from this. Maybe all I deserve is this pain, this hatred and this feeling of complete and utter uselessness. Why do all good feelings fade?   I've vented all I can. Good Day.   .:-Sam-:.

       You may find it wierd that I express my moods in colours. It's just easier for me to define them this way then in words sometimes. Currently, I feel like a pale watercolour blue. Calm and serene, not much going on in my mind.    The song I have playing right now is "Center of the World" by Bright Eyes. Connor O'burst's voice is so full of pain and just raw emotion, it grabs hold of your lungs and makes it hard to breathe. The song is slow and the lyrics are poetic, it's perfect for how I am feeling.   I'm not talking to anybody right now. I am waiting for Remington to get home from work. It's hard to describe Rem with words, but I shall try.   Rem: His beauty is not only in his apperance. He is such a great person to everyone and he can make you feel things so much clearer, much more pure. He is smarter then I, but he doesn't make me feel stupid. He understands that I have less life expirience and he helps me to learn things about myself and about life. He seems to think he is flawed, but in reality, who isnt? I wouldn't have him any other way then how he is now. Even if he were to change, to grow, I know that I would grow with him... or perhaps, without him.    I would try to describe myself, but I am not sure how. I am still not comfortable with who I am, which is understandable because I still have phases and such to go through, being only 15 and all. Well, barely 15, in 6 days I will be 15.      The book I am currently reading is "Welcome to the Monkey House", which is a series of short stories written by Kurt Vonnegut over the span of his lifetime. I am not sure if Vonnegut is yet deceased but I will assume he is. My favourite story as of yet would have to be "Harrison Bergeron". There's really no way to explain it, it's incredible. I suggest you attempt to find it and give it a read. The story I am on now is called "All the King's Horse's", and it's about kidnapped American soldiers and the family of the Colonel. The Colonel has to play chess for their lives with a small Asian crime lord of sorts. It's quite interesting.       I do believe that is all I have to speak about currently.  Good day.       .:-Sam-:.
