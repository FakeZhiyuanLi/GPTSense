      It has a lot of holes and is not entirely complete but it is still okay.  It is nothing near the quality of a school essay.  Of course I am right.  Everyone, at one point or another, witnesses the stereotypical kindergartener’s argument whether it is over equipment, rules of a game, or whether they scored or not.  It always seems to follow out the same way. "Yeah huh," "No!" "Yeah, my daddy said so!" However, do we really grow out of pointless arguing?  It seems that no matter how mature we supposedly become, our arguments will forever remain either unnecessary or utterly pointless.  I will demonstrate that the majority of arguments are results of issues that could otherwise be avoided.  For example, pride, or the inability to admit you are wrong causes a multitude of unnecessary arguments.  Such as when we choose to not even consider another’s point of view; naturally assuming that we are right.  The argument at this moment is void, since no progress will be made toward influencing either of the individuals.  An effort must be made to at least explore the opposing participants case; at which point if the case is deemed valid in our mind, we must concede, if only part of the argument.  If, however, we find the person’s case true and continue to debate them, then we are simply arguing for the sake of dispute and are much like the children on the playground.  In the same way, bad communication, or lack of understanding other’s positions, causes misunderstandings that may develop into an argument.  I cannot forget the time in which a friend of mine and I got into a particularly fierce disagreement and after one of his remarks I looked at him and said, "That is exactly what I have been trying to tell you."  What we had not realized before beginning wrapped up into the argument was exactly what the other was trying to prove.  An easily fixable situation is neglected simply because people fail to take the time to understand one another, therefore causing a pointless argument that will always end in frustration.   The most viable reason for an argument would be conflict of interest, in which, because of differing personal beliefs, parties have different solutions to different problems.  Conflict of interest is the most understandable reason to argue, but may still be avoided if a calm discussion is enacted and a compromise is reached.  However, if parties refuse to settle the dispute in a tranquil manner, it will ultimately lead to a battle of some sort, whether in the media, with friends, or in extreme situations, war.    Consequently, most arguments are preventable by simply evaluating the causing factors.  Whether it is because of pride, bad communication or conflicts of interest, most are capable of being averted.  In addition, if we took more time as humans to understand what is the causing of arguments, and then prevented them, harmony as a species would be greatly closer than ever before in the past centuries.

      Am I at the point of no improvement? What of the death I still dwell in? I try to excel, but I feel no movement. Can I be free of this unreleasable sin?  Chorus: Never underestimate my Jesus. You're telling me that there's no hope. I'm telling you your wrong.  Never underestimate my Jesus When the world around you crumbles He will be strong, He will be strong  I throw up my hands "Oh, the impossibilities" Frustrated and tired Where do I go from here? Now I'm searching for the confidence I've lost so willingly Overcoming these obstacles is overcoming my fear  (Chorus)  I think I can't, I think I can't But I think You can, I think You can I think I can't, I think I can't But I think You can, I think You can Gather my insufficiencies and place them in Your hands, place them in Your hands, place them in Your hands.  (I don't know why I am posting lyrics because you can't actually hear the song, so I find it very pointless. okay, out of my system.)

      Well. I thought I would kind of do a big generic email/blog thing to let everyone know how Costa Rica is. Since, after all, you don't all reply to emails (coughaustincough) and I forgot some email addresses (coughconnorcough) I thought this could be the best way to keep in touch right now, since this time tomorrow I may not have internet connection at Ernesto y Adri's.  Costa Rica has got to be one of the most beautiful places in the world. Okay, now that we have the setting down. lol anyway, right now I'm staying with Suzie and Michele. They have got to be some of the biggest sweethearts God ever made. Honestly. Anyway, I think the 2 biggest things that have happened so far are these.  On Wednesday (I think) I gave my testimony to an evangelism group from the youth group that Michele is working with. See, Natalie and I had to sit in on the meeting (I understood like half of what was going on). And they were learning how to write testimonies and give them. So Michele had already helped me write mine out and asked me to give it. So I did. It was really cool except I was sooo nervous that I couldn't get the word mia out. First it came out mio and then miaeee and then they all laughed when I finally got it to mia. lol and then later I couldn't say involucrada, becuase that word and I just have issues. So this one guy who said nothing the rest of the night, I was like 'involcr... no involucrud' and he goes 'involucrada' and i was like 'si!' and then kept going. lol it was funny. And then they all clapped and cheered afterwards. I'm still working on whether they were happy for me (cause they said 'amen' when I said I want to be 'una misionera por que yo quiero compartir el amor de Jesucristo con otras personas) or if they cheered cause they were happy I was done. lol  Then I was talking with Suzie about the 'illegals' which are Nicaraguans. I never knew that Nicaragua was having such a  hard time, but apparently they are. So I asked if there was an I-Team down there, and Suzie said no. But this other girl Maribela wants to go down there and start one but she needs someone to go with her, you know? And I was thinking about it a lot lately (which means in the past 3 days) that maybe this is what I want to do. THey don't need me here, they're already well established. But they need people for Nicaragua. And even though I couldn't go for another six years cause of school, I could spend summers helping Maribela prepare to go down there. I could come to Costa Rica for a year of school and work with her to plan it. You know? But then, I'm not sure if this is just me thinking of all of this, or if it's God showing me what His will is for my future. So I've been praying about it. I almost want to do the whole Gideon and sheepskin thing, but I don't want to be like testing God, I just want to know for sure so I don't screw up some vast eternal plan.  Anyway, those are the big things that have happened. Email me. You all have the address.  Working on my spanish, sara  ps, bring something for the rain.

      (For those of you who didn't know, I wrote an article against gay marriage and homosexuality in general for my school's newspaper. It was published in April, obviously during the school year. I am no longer on the newspaper staff, thank God. I'm just glad that I got the article out there for people to read and think about. A lot of the stuff under this is stuff I wanted to write in that article but knew the editor would never let it be published.)  I have been thinking about this for a while now, and it is time for me to go off. I have a friend (and yes, for future reference, we are actually very good friends, although it is beyond me how that came about because we are so different in what we believe) who is "homosexual." We argue about this issue frequently. He sometimes says that "God is an invention of people in power to keep the people they wanted to control in check." He tells me this almost as often as he tells me that the only reason I think "homosexuality" is wrong is because I have been told that by my parents who were told that by their parents who were told that by  their  parents, and so on and so forth until you get to some silly, old-fashioned, close-minded priest* somewhere who had somehow gotten the idea in his head that oh my goodness, "HOMOSEXUALITY" IS A SIN. Well, it is, if you take the Bible at face value, which you should. (Read Genesis 2:24 to see what God says a family should consist of and Romans 1:26-27 to see where God says that "homosexuality" is not natural.) But my friend doesn't like hearing that someone out there isn't afraid to disagree with him.   The reason I put the word "homosexual" in quotes is because personally, I don't believe there is such a thing as "homosexuality." There are no "homosexuals." This is because "homosexuality" is NOT something you are "born with" and it's not something you can't change. Sexual orientation isn't determined by your genes or an unbalance of chemicals or   The whole idea of more than one sexual orientation in the first place is something that was created by man to justify their actions. Different people have different stumbling blocks - some lie to get out of whatever trouble they've gotten into, some are kleptomaniacs, some succumb to the temptation to look at or watch pornography, and some gravitate towards members of their own gender on a romantic level and say "it's natural."  A "homosexual" is (and this will sound harsh) just another word for someone who is living completely in sin... much like a drug addict or even a murderer. Now don't get me wrong, I am in NO WAY calling people living "homosexual" lifestyles druggies or murderers. There are definitely some relatively "good" people who call themselves "homosexuals", I can attest to that. As many times as my friend who is "homosexual" threatens to run me or other people who occasionally irritate him over in the parking lot with his car, I know he won't. But murderers and druggies can change the way they are living their lives in the same way that anyone else can stop giving into the sinful nature of their humanity. I'm no better than anyone who says they are "homosexual". The only difference is that I have given my life to Jesus Christ, and through him I am rescued from any sinful desires I may have... and believe me, just because I'm a Christian doesn't mean it's any easier to resist them. But at least I can know for sure that God will provide a way to escape the temptations so that I can stand up under them. (1 Cor. 10:13) People who don't have that relationship don't have the ability to stop living in sin and are going to try their very best to convince everyone that their favorite kind of sin is a perfectly normal thing.   "Homosexual" activists constantly argue that "if God says we should love one another, then why don't you? God loves me the way I am, he made me this way!" First of all, yes. God loves you. God loves you so much that he gave his only Son to die for you. Don't ask me why, we're really special to him for some reason that I will never fully understand. But think of it this way. Your parents love you, right? But if they find out you're shooting heroin in your closet, they aren't going to be too happy. If they're good parents, they're going to try and get you into rehab and to get you to kick the habit. It's sort of like that with God. He loves you more than anything, and yeah, he will take you as you are if you're willing to come to him and worship him, but he doesn't want you to keep living in sin. Jesus didn't die on the cross so you can say "wheeee, God loves me, now I'm going to do whatever I want because it's the way I am." Yeah, it's the way you are, but you DON'T HAVE TO STAY THAT WAY, and if you don't want to change then you haven't really understood what it means to be a Christian. Jesus died on the cross so that you can have a way to escape your sin nature. He doesn't WANT you to keep living in sin. And he clearly defines what sin is in the Bible, so you can't get away with anything. He's going to forgive you if you ask him to, but if you just go and do whatever you want because you know you'll be forgiven, you are abusing his amazing grace. If you truly and honestly love the Lord, you will strive to obey him and please him. People who are not truly walking with the Lord should not be able to get away with saying "God loves me the way I am." God loves you the way he created you, and he created you to worship and love him. If you're not doing that, you are instead dishonoring God's intentions for your body. What "homosexuals" do is not what God intended for them, therefore the argument that "God loves them the way they are" does not apply.   Because some "homosexuals" are Christians who have fallen for the worldly lie that says they are "born that way," the rest of the "homosexual" community believes oh, well THOSE must be the real Christians, because they love us for who we are. It's time for us to stand up for ourselves. The truth is so rarely heard anymore and frankly, I'm tired of being the only one defending what the  real  real Christians believe to my "homosexual" friend. We got in an argument during my science class one day and we were practically screaming at each other by the end of it, and all the other Christians in the room that I knew were listening were just sitting idly by, watching and listening. Maybe they thought I could handle it, but still, some support would have been nice. Or maybe they were afraid he was going to cuss them out, which could very well have happened. It happened to me practically every day. The world has been trying to get Christians to shut up for forever. There is always someone out there who is going to throw everything they've got at you. Get over it. It comes with the territory (John 15:17-19). There are worse things than being ridiculed for believing in God. Like, all your friends going to hell, for example. Keep that in mind.   *I'm not Catholic, but some of my ancestors could very well have been. My dad has researched our family tree for as long as I can remember, it's sort of a hobby. We're not Mormon either and he's not looking for names to baptize into the church. I think we had some Mormon ancestors though. This has been your useless Sarah trivia of the day.

      Dramaboy57: I had planned on telling you guys tonight Dramaboy57: like right now twentyfour4skies: you're always drugged up and about to sleep... and about that, we're girls, we don't just go "oh, okay, it's fine that you're doing something instead of hanging out with us like you said you would, we'll just go do something else then" it is more like we sit around overanalyzing why you said that and it becomes "oh my gosh he hates us, he doesn't want to hang out with us and thinks we are the most retarded people in the world" twentyfour4skies: so... basically, it's just a good idea to tell us up front why you can't do something when you already said you would, or at least say you'll explain why later twentyfour4skies: instead of making up a million excuses twentyfour4skies: i'm not mad, but sara is kind of depressed since she's leaving on monday  twentyfour4skies: and wanted to hang out with the people she isn't going to see for a while. i.e., you and me and connor  Good to know that I have friends who understand me. Like Sarah. And thanks to Austin for letting me chew you out last night. I'll see you all tonight!  (Although, Connor never seems to be available...)

      "I did turn 75 today -- but remember, that's only 24 Celsius."  "It's true hard work never killed anybody, but I figure, why take the chance?"  "A friend of mine was asked to a costume ball a short time ago. He slapped some egg on his face and went as a liberal economist."  To wife Nancy after John Hinckley, Jr.'s 1981 assassination attempt: "Honey, I forgot to duck."  During a 1984 debate with Walter Mondale: "I'm not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience."  "You can tell a lot about a fellow's character by his way of eating jellybeans."  "Politics is supposed to be the second oldest profession. I have come to realize that it bears a very close resemblance to the first."

The bombing begins in five minutes.''  "Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall."  "Mr. President," TV reporter Sam Donaldson yelled out at Reagan after a 1982 press conference, "In talking about the continuing recession tonight, you have blamed the mistakes of the past and you've blamed Congress. Does any of the blame belong to you?" Reagan responded, "Yes, because for many years I was a Democrat."  "Now, so there will be no misunderstanding, it's not my intention to do away with government. It is rather to make it work -- work with us, not over us; to stand by our side, not ride on our back. Government can and must provide opportunity, not smother it; foster productivity, not stifle it."  "Well, this administration's objective will be a healthy, vigorous, growing economy that provides equal opportunity for all Americans, with no barriers born of bigotry or discrimination."  "Above all we must realize that no arsenal or no weapon in the arsenals of the world is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women."  "I hope you're all Republicans," he told doctors who were about to operate on his bullet wounds.  "Did we forget that government is the people's business, and every man, woman and child becomes a shareholder with the first penny of taxes paid?"  "We do not have a trillion dollar debt because we haven't taxed enough. We have a trillion dollar debt because we spend too much."  "Abortion is advocated only by persons who themselves have been born."  "America is too great for small dreams."  "We will always remember. We will always be proud. We will always be prepared, so we can always be free."  -  Ronald Reagan    urlLink http://connorwalsh.blogspot.com/2004/06/in-memory-of-ronald-regan-1911-2004.html   urlLink http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,63813,00.html

      "If you hadn't been screwing around, it wouldn't have gotten stuck."  Now what is the person really talking about, guess.  C-dub and I (the doctor) went bowling and i tried to be cool and do the ally cat strike thing where the girl spins the ball, but it fails and goes really slowly down the gutterlane.  Well before it gets there I roll another ball and the first one stops because it is going so slow, then this really old guys comes out and he is really angry and says "If you hadn't been screwing around, it wouldn't have gotten stuck."  so that is that story.

      it doesn't take much for my heart to break and you have done it for what seems the millionth time  whenever I hear of your saving grace and how you gave your life in exchange for mine  sometimes I wonder why you even love me and why you ever chose to call me child then I remember it's by your sacrifice I can say that  I am yous and you are mine  It doesn't take much  for me to shed a tear and you have done so many things to make me cry whenever I think of all that I've done wrong and everything that you have done to make it right  it doesn't take much for my heart to break and you have done it for what seems the millionth time ~Third Day  that song has helped me a lot this week.

      I got up this morning all ready for a stressful day, because it will be. I jumped out of bed, pulled on some of Josh's old gym shorts and ran across the street to water the neighbor's flowers and feed the cats. It was like 9:45. Then I came home, had coconut cream pie for breakfast and watched Saved By the Bell reruns. After that I took my shower, and then ten minutes later I was ready for whatever may come today. Yet, for some reason, I wasn't as frustrated as I was last night. And good ol' unorganized me sat down to make a list of my things to do today:  lay out clothes for packing hair cut ortho appt. discipleship with Daniella clean room clean bathroom meet for dance team (early with derek) FIND COSTUME FOR DANCE TEAM  The last one has been a major problem and issue of stress since about 7:30 last night. Ashley was supposed to find us costumes, I mean, honestly, I trusted her with my waist size... and then yesterday she told me that I was going to have to figure my costume out on my own. I wanted to lean over the bus seat and be like "oh, and when exactly do you expect me to do that eh? Saturday I have to pack, and I'm busy from 2-10 and Friday I'm spending with my family and Sunday I have to spend with God so I don't freak out in Costa Rica (since, if you don't recall, I will be down there for a MONTH!) and tomorrow I have cleaning to do! would have been nice if you could have given me some more notice." But you know me, I didn't say anything.   And I got up this morning expecting to run around like a little chic with her head cut off. But God was just like "hey, this is my thing ok? you let me handle it all."   Whew. Good to know someone up there has things under control. Cause I sure don't.

      The four of us (Austin, Connor, Sara without an H and me, Sarah) organized this mostly because we were bored, but because we (Sara and I, since we got this whole thing rolling) also wanted to start kind of an opinionated blog, where we could post what we think mainly about things going on in the world and in the church, but occasionally other various topics may arise (like Austin's brother's "job").  At any rate, our little motto is, appropriately, "all for One and One for all." This is not only a statement meant to unite us in our friendship, like it is in the story of The Three (or Four) Musketeers. It means more than that to us - all for One, as in Jesus Christ, the one we live for, and One for all, because Jesus is the savior of ALL mankind, and he is the ONLY way to get to heaven. That is what we believe - we're on this road together, and we're not afraid to stand up for Him.

      I have promoted myself to editor of this blog, seeing as how NO ONE BUT ME reads over their posts for mistakes, and in case you hadn't noticed I like it when words are spelled right and sentences are formed correctly.  Something else really cool that happened to me today, besides my promotion, was that I got an Inspector Gadget ringtone.

      So I dropped my brother off at I think 8 or 9 this morning. He goes and hangs out with 2 of these boys in middle school. I came back and my brother is $60 richer. He gets paid to hang out and go to the pool and launch water ballons at people everyday.

      Age is a measure of time, God is outside of time, so logically if we even want to consider age, we must consider it as a measure of maturity. Unless in cases of the law: such as driving age, drinking age, and smoking age, where breaking the law is disobedience to God, your age is defined by your maturity.

      I was talking to my friend Becca online today. We had this really interesting conversation about friends and the friends we've lost recently. She was telling me about this mutual friend that she had a lot of problems with Freshmen and Sophomore year. Then recently, this friend came back and practically begged for Becca to take her back.   Becca said no. This girl had put her through too much and she was tired of being let down. I didn't know what to say. I just thought about how we used to be this great group of friends. Then freshmen year, everything went wrong. People went to drugs and alcohol. We kinda turned our backs on each other, and now there's barely even three of us left that are still trying to hang on to what was there before.  Then I was talking to my friend Matt. It was his birthday on Tuesday and he was making fun of me cause I forked the wrong house.&nbsp; But he still got the card cause he knew the people we did it to, and he thought it was great. And then he all of a sudden said he had to go. This girl, Gracie had called and they were all going to see a movie.   They being the people at my old youthgroup. I didn't really like my old youthgroup but I wanted to curl up and cry. My friends at school are all divided. My friends from the old church never talk to me anymore. And it kinda hurt.  Because I just realized. That I can't go back. I can't be the person I was and be the person I am today. It doesn't work. It won't ever be the same again. It might be better. But it won't be the same.&nbsp; And I can't go back.

      I found a blog somewhere that mentioned this article. The New York Times ran it. The headline was "Lives; When One Is Enough." Now, let's think about that. What could that possibly allude to? What's the first thing that came into YOUR head when you read it?   I'm guessing that probably what you thought was a little different than what it actually is about. I don't subscribe to the Times (and frankly I'm not planning on it) so when I went to the website I didn't have access to the article. But there was a summary of it that was just as appalling as the story itself:  "The Lives column in The Times Magazine on July 18 gave a first-person account of the experience of Amy Richards, who had been pregnant with triplets and decided to abort two of the fetuses. Ms. Richards, who told her story to a freelance Times Magazine contributor, Amy Barrett, discussed her anxiety about having triplets, the procedure to terminate two of the pregnancies and the healthy baby she eventually delivered; she expressed no regret about her decision."  How would you like to be that kid? Think&nbsp;about it.&nbsp;I don't know what would be worse - growing up knowing your siblings were murdered in your mother's womb right next to you or growing up NOT knowing and then finding out that your mother is the kind of person who would do that to some of her children and not all of them. Either way I would be devastated.  Just a thought...

      I talked  to Minor on MSN last night! It was so great! I haven't had any contact from anyone in Costa Rica since we left. I was actually feeling kinda depressed, just wishing that they could get to an internet cafe or Andrea and Arnulfo's and write me. Especially since I've emailed like three or four of them. It was a total God thing. Exactly what I needed to cheer me up! Yaaaaay! (and of course, he somehow managed to ask if I like Jose... lol.) So he's supposed to say hi to everyone out there for me.     I'm just so excited that I got to talk to him! yaaaaaaaaaay!

      I was reading a Dave Barry column on the Miami Herald website&nbsp;and I noticed in the sidebar that there was a link called "Gay South Florida." I clicked on it out of curiousity, and&nbsp;on the page that loaded,&nbsp;I found a Gay Q&A with a guy named Steve, who is a homosexual. It broke my heart when I read this one:   Q. Steve, what can we do to get these bible abusers to get real and acknoledge that they are trying to steal civil rights from a minority, as the Nazi's did repeatedly in the early 30's ? They refuse to see their own bigotry, THEY make blind assumptions and present them as FACTS. I never asked to be gay. I tried to be "normal" for these people, it caused YET another failed marriage in America, and MORE children raised in a "broken home" when I could no longer live a lie !  -Dolphins fan 4 life, Memphis, TN&nbsp;  A. Dolphins fan, the best thing people can do is to tell their own stories, just as you've done. I'm sure other gay people will relate and nongay people will have something to think about. Thanks.    Christians  are the ones making blind assumptions? Well who is calling who a Nazi, here?   Dear Dolphins fan 4 life,  Okay, first of all: I'm sorry that the experiences you have had&nbsp;with Christians were so awful that you now&nbsp;associate&nbsp;all of us&nbsp;with Nazis and call us "bible abusers." But, well, we're not like Nazis, really.&nbsp;It hurts that you're making such a blind assumption of us,&nbsp;Dolphins fan.&nbsp;If we were like Nazis... well, things would be a lot worse for you, is all I can say. In case you didn't know, Hitler killed Christians. He wanted to create a new world religion and replace Jesus Christ as the central figure of worship with himself. He is not our best friend. So if you don't mind, don't call us Nazis.   Second of all, I would just like you to know that the Christian "agenda" is not to "steal civil rights from a minority." That's blind assumption number two for&nbsp;ya, buddy. What would be the point in stealing civil rights from&nbsp;someone?&nbsp;It's not like they're something we can hoard all to ourselves, or&nbsp;anything. "Ahaha, these are MY civil rights! Precioussss!" No. That is not&nbsp;what Christians want. At least, that isn't what REAL Christians&nbsp;want. Sometimes, as&nbsp;Christians, we&nbsp;can come off a little strong with our fire and brimstone talk, but&nbsp;ultimately... well,&nbsp;real&nbsp;Christians want to spread the truth of God's&nbsp;Word to the world. We're not supposed to point fingers and&nbsp;act like we're better than everyone else, because we're not. But, well, like it or not, God's Word says that homosexuality is a SIN. Yes, that's right. SIN.&nbsp;It's a hard word to hear, I know.&nbsp;But guess what, EVERYBODY DOES IT! MYSELF INCLUDED!&nbsp;SIN IS A HARD THING TO DEAL WITH!&nbsp;The ONLY difference between us&nbsp;is that I recognize my need for a Savior. I know I sin. I know I can't do anything worth doing&nbsp;apart from Christ. And I know and believe&nbsp;that Jesus&nbsp;is the only way for me to escape the consequences of sin.  (Collective gasp) WHAT? There are CONSEQUENCES for SIN? But... I thought I could just do whatever the heck I wanted and get away with it! Isn't that what America is all about?  IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE, BUT IT SURE IS LOOKING THAT WAY LATELY.   But you know what the absolute greatest part is? Yeah, there are consequences for sinning. To put it bluntly, people who sin go to hell. Which means that all of us are condemned to hell. (Oh yes! I  went  there! Final destination for sinners = HELL!) But you don't have to go to hell.  What? But you just said...  Yeah. Remember Jesus? You know, the guy who came to Earth roughly&nbsp;2000 years ago...? Well, he did this thing for us. He died. On the cross. He was crucified, which is actually a pretty painful way to die. I don't know for sure, but I would&nbsp;even venture that it is probably THE most painful way to die. But see, he didn't die because he did something wrong. In fact, he never did ANYTHING wrong in his entire life. He never sinned, not once. Which is pretty amazing, if you think about it. The reason he was able to not sin his entire life was because he was actually God in the flesh, which is even more incredible. God!&nbsp; Walking around! &nbsp;On   Earth!  &nbsp;TALKING to people!&nbsp;Come on, doesn't that mean something to you? It sure means something to me. You know why? Because he came to Earth to die for ME. He did it because he for some insane reason LOVES me and wants me to be with him in heaven for eternity. So when he rose again three days after he was put into the grave, he had conquered death and from then on, all you had to do was believe in him as your Savior and follow him. That's it. Believing in Jesus = salvation from sin and its consequences.&nbsp;It's REALLY not that&nbsp;hard to understand.   Dolphins fan, in fear of sounding incredibly hateful, let me just say this. Gays and lesbians should NOT be whining about being persecuted. You're getting an amazing amount of press because of all your&nbsp;various antics, and all the blame for your supposed "unhappiness" is landing on us Christians. After all, we're the ones upholding the founding fathers' Constitution. We're the ones who want to keep America's last bit of purity before we lose it completely. Now, don't get me wrong. I'm not bitter about the whole persecution thing. It's promised in the Bible that because the world hated Jesus, they will hate his followers. So really, I don't care if you do it. But because this is America, and we have freedom of speech and religion, I'm able to defend what I believe, which is what I'm doing.   I'm a Christian. Am I afraid of change, like everyone always accuses us of being? YES! I an desperately afraid that this nation is going to forget their Creator. I'm so scared that America is going to be a highway for others in the world to be led astray, and I'm scared that even more people are going to end up separated from God for eternity. It is MIND BOGGLING that SO many people actually believe the lie that they were "born that way." Satan is having his way with this country. Homosexuality isn't the only thing that's wrong with us.&nbsp;There&nbsp;is a plethora of other things that should worry any thinking person.&nbsp;Why wouldn't I be afraid? But thankfully, he who is in me is greater than he who is in the world. And he's our only prayer right now. He's always been our only prayer, and personally, I wouldn't have it any other way.  Sincerely, Sarah  Dear Steve,  Thank you for posting that comment. It did give me something to think about.  Love, Sarah

       I just found this really interesting website (all thanks to Sarah,&nbsp;I might add). The guy on there calls himself Jesus. I could totally understand that if he was latin or something, but I'm thinking he's not. Although, I could be wrong...&nbsp;but for my sake I'm going to assume he was being a moron who thought he was funny.   I clicked on his website after looking through people who have the same interests as me on their profiles. I thought it looked interesting because he had both Christianity and Atheism listed as interests side by side. Oh it was interesting all right. I just want to clarify a few things that he said about Christianity. I just want to point out what was right and what was wrong, in case any of you ever see it, you'll know.   And he isn't a Christian, so I think I'm a bit more of an expert on our beliefs. But hey, you don't have to believe me. It's your brain. It's your own screwed up twisted and brainwashed mind,&nbsp;don't let me tell you what to think.   He said that Christians believe homosexuality is wrong. Welcome to biggest problem in America 101. It is. For a Christian to walk around saying that being gay is okay, and then claim to know God's laws and commands is impossible. That person is a liar. Mentira. They obvoiusly have not read Leviticus. If you are a Christian, I'm talking to you.&nbsp; Being gay is a sin. I don't think of it any differently than lying, because in God's eyes, sin is sin, there's no difference between lying and murdering. It's a hard concept to grasp, but it's the truth. So I don't freak out about homosexuals. I think it's kinda gross, just because I could never look at a girl that way, but I'm not going to walk around my school and tell people to turn for homosexuality or burn in hell. If that was the case, I would be burning in hell for all the times I'm disrespectful. Thankfully I've got Jesus to pull me out of that.   If you don't believe me that being gay is a sin according to God, well I'm not the one who came up with it.&nbsp; "Do not lie with a man as one lies with a woman; that is detestable" (Leviticus 18:22) If you don't take the Bible seriously, and you don't believe that what it says is word for word the absolute truth, well honey you need to get a life. Estupido nika. (AY! lo siento) So it says right there that it's a sin, just like lying or cheating, although the consequences are greater.   Then this 'jesus' guy said that Jesus (as in Jesucristo) can save you from homosexuality. Well yea, that's true. Because Jesus saves us from our sin. He saves me from my lying, my cheating, my disrespectful attitude, my cussing, bla bla bla. So since homosexuality is just another sin, he saves you from that, and helps you to turn to God and the right way. In this case, heterosexuality would be the right way; God's way. In my case, using my mouth to be nice and encouraging rather than making fun of people would be God's way.   It's just sin guys. It's a little more visible, that's why some people are so bothered by it. But it's just sin. Hate the sin, love the sinner. Becuase if you don't love the sinner, how will he see Jesus in you? If a man says he loves God and yet hates his brother, he's a liar! God is love, we should be, too.   That's it in a nutshell. That was the one that really bothered me. I just wanted to set the record straight with everything that's going on in the country. How could I let someone tell the world what I&nbsp; believe, and yet be totally wrong about all of it? I had to tell you myself. I just wanted you to know. Becuase this guy 'jesus' doesn't know what he's talking about. But my Jesus does. My Jesus always knows what he's talking about. Because my Jesus is the truth.&nbsp;    (Almost forgot, I'm really sorry if I keep saying stuff in Spanish. I even did it at Master Drive today. I don't know what's wrong with me.)

      Well, that was the best title I could think of for this post. Because there really isn't anything that can be said to announce what I want to share. Partially, because I have no idea what I am going to share with y'all today. Okay, that's not true. I know what I'm goind to say, I just don't know how. I guess...   I have a friend, who for the sake of privacy, I am going to call her Annie. Annie's a sweet girl just a little lost and craving love and attention. I know, newsflash, isn't the entire world. But Annie has had a particularly bad time with things. She has a good home and a great family who loves her, but she's incredibly unhappy, or at least she was when she started drugs. She's doing better now, and she only cuts on the rare occasion. (yay)   But as a Christian, I recognize that as not being enough, especially since the only one who is keeping her from drugs and cutting is her boyfriend. We all know how stupid and unpredictable boys are. So I just told her one night online (at close to 12 mind you) that I wish she had something a little more constant. Of course the question came, what could be more constant. And of course, my answer was Jesus.   Oh great, now there's a can of worms that I just opened. But she actually didn't flip out on me like I expected. On the contrary, she just said thanks, she knows I want her to have 'good things' but she's okay right now. So then I said something along the lines of 'I don't know about good things, I just don't really want you to go to Hell.' and then she asked why that would happen, because she's a pretty good person; sure she hurts herself, but she doesn't hurt others a whole lot. At least, she tries not to.   But it was so insane. I mean, I got to totally share Christ with her. I gave her the '4-1-1' on Christianity, salvation, Jesus, God, sin. You know? And hello?! It was all over IM.  IM!!  Who honestly shares Christ over the internet at midnight?! It was almost 1 when I finished and stold her I was going to bed.   It was just so amazing because the week before Derek and Kari talked about being Jesus here, and not just on mission trips. They said that we need to bring the mission field back to our school and share Christ with everyone. And it's hard, they know. I mean, they're only seniors. But I just kinda scoffed when Kari said something about, not waiting for the opportunity but creating it. I figure, God creates the opportunity, not me, I'll just take it and run with it when He gives me something.   Oh, He gave it to me alright. I never thought I would share Christ with Annie. I always thought she would tell me no, she didn't want to hear it. And then I told her how much Jesus loves her just 2 nights ago. I may have made that comment about having Jesus as a constant in life, but even that wasn't me. That was God. I got offline and just couldn't stop thinking about it. I've seen God work in crazy ways before, but never like this.   The whole thing was God. I could do nothing to start something like that, I could do nothing to open up Annie's heart and make her willing to listen. That was God. My words were God. I saved the conversation and reread it yesterday. Holy Cow*, I could never say those kind of things on my own, not unless I planned them ahead of time!   So I guess all I have to say is, yea Annie may not have become a Christian. But for some reason, God used me ( me of all people) to show Him to her with some text in a little window on Monday morning. I think it's really cool when you can see God work like that. It's not very often, but it happens once in a while. So guys? just keep trying. Because you don't have to do anything, God will give you the time and the words to say. He did for me. And trust me, it will come up in places you never thought possible. Like IM at midnight.   luv y'all bunches and bunches! Dios le bendiga.   &nbsp;  *sarah, yes it is a special Cow.

      "O My beloved, abide under the shelter of the lattice for I have betrothed you to Myself, and though you are sometimes indifferent toward Me, My love for you is at all times as a flame of fire."  &nbsp;  This is the first sentence of the book  Come Away My Beloved  by Frances J. Roberts. When I read it, I almost started crying. Everyone's always told me that God knows exactly what I'm going through in every situation because he lived on the Earth and&nbsp;went through the whole&nbsp;human experience&nbsp;firsthand. But in my ignorance, I always sort of doubted somewhere in my mind that he knew what it was like to feel unrequited love, to know what it's like to be rejected by the object of your affection for whatever reason. Looking at it now it seems so  stupid.  Of  course  he knows what that's like. I do it to him  all the time.  We  all  do. He loves every single one of us so intimately and so dearly, but half the time we're off doing our own thing in our own little world. He loved us so much that he  died  for us, and any pain I ever went through because of a guy not liking me back is absolutely insignificant compared to the pain that Jesus goes through every single time&nbsp;we turn away from him, indifferent.  &nbsp;  He  knows.

      "The nature of Christ's salvation is woefully misrepresented by the present-day evangelist. He announces a Savior from Hell rather than a Savior from sin. And that is why so many are fatally deceived, for there are multitudes who wish to escape the Lake of fire who have no desire to be delivered from their carnality and worldliness." -Arthur W. Pink

      I have a really good friend; I think I mentioned him yesterday when i said I was a moron? Yea, that one. Well he apparently is okay with me and my stupidity. He came over this morning and gave me these two cards he'd picked up at walgreens. My brother thought he was a salesman and wasn't going to answer the door. And I was still in my pajamas, so I had to pull on a huge thick freaking hot hoodie to go upstairs and peek out the window, because I thought that myabe by some weird coincedence it would be him, after what I'd just read two seconds ago on the blog.  And it was him. Stupid brothers. So he gave me the cards and I let him in and we talked for a few minutes and then he had to leave. And then my brother made some stupid comment (after he was gone) like, "he knows he has to come through me first, and dad. wow, that's like double! 'hey, you're in!'" Which was totally lame because it's not like he likes me or something. But my brother is kind of a moron like that early in the morning...  But it was hilarious, because I was reading what he wrote in one of them and it was something about puting up with his shananingans. See, I wrote him this long apology last night (actually this morning at like 1:00 am) and I said almost the exact same thing. So, it was funny to me.  I'm just glad to know that I have such good friends who are willing to deal with my ups and downs and my conspiracy theorist.  And most of all, I'm glad I have Sarah and her 'couples therapy.' Even though, we aren't a couple, it was good to work stuff out with Austin. Because without her, I wouldn't be talking to him currently. Which would be really stupid because he's leaving tomorrow for some boy scouts thing. (speaking of which, why is he still in boy scouts? he's 16 for crying out loud!)  And it's been really confusing after getting back from Costa Rica. I've lost a lot of things and I've found a whole lot more. But I don't know what to do with any of it. It's good to know that I have friends that are going to sit next to me on the roller coaster and hold my hand when it gets really bad. Because it will eventually. Costa Rica changed a lot, and as much as I wish, it's not going to go back to the way it was. But I think that's okay. Because, as always, God has it under control. We're just here to ride along and make the occasional choice about which ride we're going to next.

      Why I am posting this, I could not tell you, but the computer doesn't seem sufficent enough.  I don't know why you would want to read this unless you were terribly horribly bored beyond any reason.  I am not venting because I am angry, I just want someone to hear.   Sometime this week I was driving home from seeing Anchorman with people in my car, which was okay with my parents.  Turning on a Venneford, a residential street from highlands ranch park way. I slowed down to turn left and so that my friends could wave by  (bad decision I know) well my friend who is at least 10 seconds behind doesn’t notice that I have slowed down and runs taps the back of my car.  I pull off left and she right and I could go into a huge description of what happen from then but we will just say that that she hit me and I was not happy but told my parents and got yelled and her parents agreed to pay she even said that it was all her fault.  I talked with my parents and we yelled and then got sad and we cried and everything was better. Saturday I think I went to Red Robin and that was fun but nothing too exciting unfortunately since Jessica had left.  While leaving the parking lot my friend got really sick and threw up in the grass.  Kate from RI had to drive Jessamyn’s car home (Kate only has a permit) I had to lead her home the safe way and she was going about 35 which is smart but took a while.  I don’t remember the rest of Saturday. What has happened, going from Sunday, I set my alarm for church but being the smart person that I am, I hit the off button, well I finally woke up about 9:10 or so, which for those of you who don’t go to my church, it started at 9.  I run around a drive over and arrive maybe about 9:35 or so, (half way through the service) right when worship was ending.  I the next part was listening to a sermon by the seniors, which I applaud, but (and no offense) is not as good as an intern or pastor, and are not expected to be that good.  I continued by going to the mall and walking around for a while.  My feet began to hurt and since it was around 1:45 or so I wanted to go home because I was bored and was not doing anything productive (no offense to anyone at the mall I was very tired).  I continued to go home and ask my parents if I could not go on the canoeing trip and got talked into it.  Monday woke up and started off okay, was planning on running but that didn’t happen, got called by Kate, my friend from Rhode Island.  Went over to the park about 1 or 2 or so and I stayed there for a while before I decided that I just needed to go somewhere else.  So I rode my bike (my brother had taken the car) over to Phil Fisher’s house because I knew him and Kevin Berry were over there playing video games. Well they were down in the basement so I went over to the Lauren Pagnard’s house (2 houses down) to ask if I could borrow the phone and call Phil and make sure that Lauren knew that she was invited to the park with Kate.  (Note: this is the girl who the previous week hit the back bumper of my car.)  I came in and it was her mother she laughed and joked and I borrowed the phone and told Phil to open the door. So he comes up and opens the door and I play counterstrike with them for a while. I go home and get ready for Scouts that night, I have a meeting with the Canoe trip people and that goes well except I had a huge headache and I really didn’t want to be there. Turns out at scouts the leadership was gone so it was free night, naturally I left and went over to Walgreens because Monday nights Kate Meek from church works there so I buy cards for friends, 1 for a sick friend, Jessamyn and 2 for another friend Sara.  I stood there for a while and wrote encouraging notes. Got home, and did nothing productive.  Tuesday I wake up and want to go running again but I have to make sure Shane wakes up for work so I play video games all morning then my dad says write your mission letter so I don’t because I smart like that.  Later I want to go hang out with Kate and my dad gets angry (note* my dad gets angry very quickly)(note*my peeve is when people get angry very quickly) he had the right to say no but he didn’t, thank you.  I went over to the park and hung out with Kate and friends then we went down to Teresa’s house and I watched the first 15 minutes of School Of Rock but I went home at 9 because my dad had called and said that there was an emergency.  Naturally I was concerned so I came home promptly at 9 thinking it was my grandpa or something.  Well my dad was on the phone and so was my mom and they didn’t seemed to worried, then 15 minutes later they sat me down and asked everything that had happened during the accident (going back to the beginning) I was confused as to why they were asking again.  They had told me that an anonymous letter had come in the mail about the accident.  I told them the story about how I had switched in to the left lane on Broadway in front of her and slowed quickly to turn on to highlands ranch parkway and how I had sped up to 55 at the max just because were teenagers (stupid decision and I am never speeding or racing ever again) and then told them that I slowed back down and stopped at the left turn off of highlands ranch onto venneford and waited for a car so that I could go and she would have to wait that way we would not egg each other on and she would not follow to closely, I continued to slow down was I had turned and she didn’t notice and tapped the back of my car, causing some damage which she said was her fault and she was soooo sorry. Well back to my parents and the letter, the letter had come and said (from the point of view of a student in the car) it was all my fault and Kate’s fault for wanting to slow down and I should be ashamed and was a horrible friend and Christian for not taking the blame and making Lauren (the other driver) pay. (Note: my mom has a degree in psychology and is extremely good with people and understanding them, I take after my mother in this and we are extremely good and discerning, in fact I think it is one of my mom’s spiritual gifts, it is impossible to lie to her.  My family is one of psychologists and you don’t try to deceive us, especially not my mother.)  My parents and I had a very long discussion and I got more lecturing, we then wondered who might have sent the letter and I deemed that most people in the cars would be too shy or to lazy to send a letter and only certain people knew the info in the letter.  I had narrowed it down to Jessamyn, but my mom being the genius that she is knew Lauren very well, and Ms. Pagnard (her mother) and wondered whether it was Ms. Pagnard who had sent it in order that she would only have to pay half the cost.  I thought it back and forth (and you should see me and my mom do this, it is really quite amazing how we only using psychology to do this and my dad sits in the middle dumbfounded while we are like detectives.  We narrowed it down to Jessamyn, Ms. Pagnard, or Lauren telling Teresa and Teresa writing a note (which I don’t think was very plausible so I didn’t consider it).  I was extremely hurt if it was Jessamyn because I did not want her to think those things about me since we have been friends for 12 years almost and I value that friendship a lot.  Wednesday I went over to her house around 9 am (she was leaving at 10 to go to Utah for Jr. Olympics for her sister) I gave her the get well card and asked her in her honest opinion if she though the accident was my fault.  I realized that night before I went to bed that it wasn’t Jessamyn because I remember her supporting me and she doesn’t write in cursive and that was how the letter was addressed.  She very strongly said no that it was all Lauren’s fault and that legal it was her fault and that I should not have to pay, I ask about the letter and she said it was horrible and that she did not write it. So if it wasn’t Jessamyn that left one other person Mrs. Pagnard.  She had written a letter saying mean things about me and saying it was my fault and acting like she was a student so that she would only have to pay half the costs.  We are pretending like the letter was never sent and continuing with them paying for the damages.  I was personally offended, well I get back and my dad flips because he wants the letters finished and so I write them and address I still need to send them.  I finished them so I went to brunch with a friend and had a talk with that person but it wasn’t a very happy one because they don’t me that life sucked and they hated living and that they were cutting themselves and that the medication to bring them out of depression wasn’t working (they goes to a shrink). I tried to encourage them and get them involved with a church or something but I am still afraid. I then came home and worked on packing for my canoe trip which I had all my stuff together but it wasn’t packed enough for my dad so he started yelling at me.  I then asked if I could go to the mall with Sara and Sarah and there was more yelling at me. So I packed and slept and then my mom got home and I was still angry with my dad so she got angry at me.  More yelling and arguing.  I then ate dinner, which went well because Brent and Shane were home.  I then got online and was talking people and I accidentally angered a friend (note: I hate IM because I am a person who deciphers most of what is being said by voice inflection and body language, it is the psychology thing I was talking about earlier.)  Connor kept on calling and I was talking to him but so much was going on I couldn’t keep track and I was trying to get over to his house but I first wanted to work out the problem with this friend.  I didn’t quite know what to say at first and I felt like a kept on rambling on.  Finally I got the impression that we were okay and I had to go (yes I did get the last few sentences but had to leave) I was already late by 30 minutes for Connor’s, but things went better because Ryan was there and I hadn’t seen either of them in a while, and we watched Bourne Identity. The only problem is that I have had a headache since about the conversation with my friend and over IM and it was only getting worse, I was afraid that I might get a migraine and have to be picked up.  I was supposed to be home by 11 and didn’t get home till 11:40 or so because the movie ran over, luckily my parents really don’t notice when I get home as long as I check in.  I came home and checked the blog and received a very touching apology, which I accept humbly.  I am now helping my brother pack for his camping trip and just told him about the accident and he just gave me another lecture.  It is now 1:36 on Thursday, I have no idea what I am suppose to do with this writing, I have just been talking to my computer for about and 1 ½ hours.  Maybe I will post it. Hey I still need to get those 2 cards from Monday to Sara before I leave. Good night.

      Today I got mad at a really close friend of mine. My brother has this theory about how a woman's brain works. There's a three ring circus with four men. There's crying man, all he does is cry and cry, there's Skitzo, and when he's up, you can never understand what she's thinking. Then there's conspiracy theorist, and no matter what you say, if he's got the mike, she's going to think you're saying she's fat or ugly. The last guy is a midget. He's in a straight jacket and he's all black and blue because the others beat up on him so much. He's logic man. The trick to understanding, and communicating with a woman, is to know who has the mike.  all of today conspiracy theorist was in control in my head. And whenever Logic man tried to take it from him, he got bashed in the head with the mike. And instead of realizing it myself, I just went all out and ate this guy alive. Poor Austin had no idea he said anything. And he even apologized a million times and I wouldn't take it. Because Logic Man wasn't in control. I finally told him I was sorry for being a freak and being immature. But he didn't respond.  Maybe, just maybe he wised up and realized that maybe I'm not worth all the trouble I give him. In some ways, I hope he did (for his sake of course). But on the other hand, I want a second chance, to not be such a moron.  All I'm trying to say, and this is mainly for the girls, guys don't process things the way we do. I know you've heard that a million times. But trust me, I just figured it out today first hand. And it's an experience you don't want to have. So just know when they're joking. And if you want them to be serious, you kinda have to tell them. And when you're talking to someone online, be careful, because with out the tone of voice and facial expressions, it is really hard to understand what someone is saying. Be careful. And give your guy friends some extra space.  and guys? do the same thing for the girls. Because sometimes we're stupid and we take things personally when we shouldn't. Just give us some time, and we'll be okay again.

         "In your lives you must think and act like Christ Jesus. Christ himself was like God in everything. But he did not think that being equal with God was something to be used for his own benefit. But he gave up his place with God and made himself nothing. He was born to be a man and became like a servant.  And when he was living as a man, he humbled himself and was fully obedient to God, even when that caused his death-death on a cross. So God raised him to the highest place. God made his name greater than every other name so that every knee will bow to the name of Jesus-everyone in heaven, on earth, and under the earth. And everyone will confess that Jesus Christ is Lord and bring glory to God the Father."  Philippians 2:5-11 (NCV)

      By Dale Buss  "When I'm teaching Sunday school, I'm encouraged by what I hear from the teenagers at my evangelical Christian church in suburban Detroit. They seem to understand - and, more important, to believe - the bedrock tenets that will help them hew to orthodoxy throughout their lives and make them salt and light in the world.  But the hard numbers say otherwise. It turns out that, while they may profess the faith and indeed love Jesus, the vast majority of Christian teenagers in this country actually hold beliefs fundamentally antithetical to the creed. The forces of moral relativism and 'tolerance' have gotten to them in a big way. In fact, some leaders believe that mushy doctrine among the younger generation ranks as the No. 1 crisis facing American Christendom today.  About one-third of American teenagers claim they're 'born again' believers, according to data gathered over the past few years by Barna Research Group, the gold standard in data about the U.S. Protestant church, and 88% of teens say they are Christians. About 60% believe that 'the Bible is totally accurate in all of its teachings.' And 56% feel that their religious faith is very important in their life.  Yet, Barna says, slightly more than half of all U.S. teens also believe that Jesus committed sins while he was on Earth. About 60% agree that enough good works will earn them a place in heaven, in part reflecting a Catholic view, but also flouting Protestantism's central theme of salvation only by grace. About two-thirds say that Satan is just a symbol of evil, not really a living being. Only 6% of all teens believe that there are moral absolutes--and, most troubling to evangelical leaders, only 9% of self-described born-again teens believe that moral truth is absolute.  'When you ask even Christian kids, "How can you say A is true as well as B, which is the antithesis of A?," their typical response is, "I'm not sure how it works, but it works for me,"' says George Barna, president of the Ventura, Calif.-based research company. 'It's personal, pragmatic and fairly superficial.'  ~~~  Some commentators produce even more startling statistics on the doctrinal drift of America's youth. Ninety-one percent of born-again teenagers surveyed a few years ago proclaimed that there is no such thing as absolute truth, says the Rev. Josh McDowell, a Dallas-based evangelist and author. More alarmingly, that number had risen quickly and steadily from just 52% of committed Christian kids in 1992 who denied the existence of absolute truth. A slight majority of professing Christian kids, Mr. McDowell says, also now say that the bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ never occurred. 'There's a greater disconnect now than ever in the history of the church in America between what a Christian young person says they are and what they actually believe,' says Mr. McDowell, who has ministered mainly to youth for more than 30 years. 'Christianity is based on truth; Jesus said, "I am the truth." But you have an overwhelming majority even of Christian kids saying there is no absolute truth.'  Catholics have noticed the trend as well. A few weeks ago, in fact, Pope John Paul II specifically warned several U.S. bishops about the 'soulless vision of life' that seemed to be overtaking America, urging them to 'confront directly the widespread spirit of agnosticism and relativism which has cast doubt on reason's ability to know the truth,' especially among youth.  Indeed, the consequences of this theological implosion now pervade the thoughts and actions of believing teenagers, following the moral breakdown of the broader American culture. Here's one practical example: Only 10% of Christian teens believe that music piracy is morally wrong, according to a recent Barna survey, not all that different from the 6% of their non-Christian peers who feel the same way.  Then extrapolate the situation to other possible big-picture results. Nearly 60% of evangelical Christian teenagers now say that all religious faiths teach equally valid truths, according to Mr. McDowell. It's bad enough that they seem to have been co-opted by relativism from within our culture and even from within the church and family. But it's even more disconcerting to realize that  we're relying on this generation for the future defense of Judeo-Christian civilization  against the highly motivated forces of militant Islam.  Perhaps it's counterintuitive to believe this problem is as severe as that outlined by Messrs. Barna and McDowell. After all, we're told that spirituality is de rigueur among youths these days and that Christianity is right up there. But this zeitgeist largely reflects a pseudo-faith that is fed by a steady diet of pop-culture feints, from the allegorical 'Lord of the Rings' movies to the T-shirt that recently adorned Pamela Anderson saying, 'Jesus is my homeboy.'  The kids in my Sunday School class really do understand that. It's their peers I'm worried about."  ~  Hey guys. Let's try to not give them reason to worry.

      The other day, I was thinking about how sometimes I just feel like I try to be involved in youth group for no reason. I know, I know, I haven't been back from Costa Rica even a full week yet and I already started feeling the old familiar pity party starting back up again. I felt like nobody really cared because no one bothered to call me when some people were going to go see a movie. Really childish, yes, because I do know better. It wasn't one of my better moments; I felt like convincing myself that the world DID revolve around me, I WAS the center of the universe, everyone should care about ME, cater to MY needs because I'M the only one that matters or who has feelings or wants to be taken care of. But then I realized how retarded I was being and moved on to being depressed about other things that don't deserve to be discussed on this blog.  Anyway, my point is, what really made me stop being depressed and start contributing positive vibes to society again is I remembered that it's not about ME. I'll admit that I didn't read all of The Purpose-Driven Life, but I definitely read the first sentence, and that's what it is: It's not about YOU. There's more to life than not being invited to see a movie with some people, there's more to life than not seeing your friends when you want to or missing out on something you thought you were going to get to do. Who knows what kinds of things you could end up doing instead of what you planned? God's in control of EVERY situation, and even if it pisses you off at first, the only thing for it is to make the best of what you're stuck with. God doesn't switch things around because you throw a hissy fit and whine about it for hours. He's happy to listen to you, of course, but he wants you to trust him that he knows what's best for you. And right now I'm even trying to convince myself to do this, because it's not the easiest thing. I'm still having problems figuring a few things out, and remembering how to act when certain people are around. And yeah, I'm a little upset at the way things have been going for me, and the stuff I've been putting myself through by complicating things isn't too fun either. But God is in control. He knows what's best for me, and I will love what he's decided for me.   Even so, it's hard to remember. After all, I'm only human.

      This is me venting!  Early this year I signed up a canoeing trip called Boundry Waters with Boy Scouts.  I asked the guy who led it a billion times, what are the dates, he FINALLY got me the dates and I said okay.  Then about the beginning of Summer I realized that I did not have time for this trip, so I have been calling him for hmmm may 18th or so trying to tell him "Hey, I can't go!" because the trip is about 11 days, which is fine because then someone else could just take my spot.  I left about 5 messages on his phone saying "Hey call me!"  and he ignores them and then goes on vacation for 2 weeks and finally i get a hold of him today and he tells me that there is a meeting tomorrow, oh but not only that, but he is adding an extra day so it is now 12 days and I have to miss the photo party.  I want to tell him, "well that is too bad, I can't go because I have a previous arrangement for teh night of the 16th", oh did I mention that I have only paid 100 out of 450 dollars for the trip because I couldn't get a hold of him.  I want to say "Too bad I am not paying, get someone else to go!" but my dad would be mad because then I would make the guy angry and he might be on my eagle board of review, which is unlikely but possible, nd my dad doesn't want to be rude. (which is unusual because most of the time he wouldn't care and if it was anything but scouts he probably wouldn't) so now I am stuck going on a trip that I really don't want to go on for 12 days and then I have another trip after that and I am left with 14 days of summer in which I am home. gggggggrrrrrrrr. I rarely (like maybe 4 times a year)get angry but I am right now. I am missing so much more, it is not even just the photo party, I am missing a ton of stuff even when my friend from Rhode Island is leaves, and this is the last time she will come to colorado.   I hate this trip with the firey passion of a 1,000,000,000 burning suns all exploding in one enormously cataclsymic violent hateful blast!!!!!!!!!!!!   Thank you for listening to me vent, it doesn't happen very often so thank you for enduring.

      Last night they had a comedian at church. My parents dragged me to it, but hey, the free dessert was awesome! But he said something last night about Unity in the church. I thought, finally someone who agrees with me! I've wanted a pulpit to preach from quite a few times. It's always about unity in the church.  It's so stupid to. I mean, why do I have to drive down University and see four or five churchs, and under their name is splayed "lutheran church" "Evangelical" "Methodist" I mean honestly. Doesn't it really all come down to a man dying on a cross, and coming back to life three days later to save the world? Isn't that CHRISTIANITY? So why the big hang up over denominations? "Ooo, I'm methodist, I can't talk to you southern baptist freaks." I mean seriously, who does that?  I have to admit I used to be in on it to. I kept asking my parents what I was, and I finally managed to get it out of my mom, "if you really want to label your beliefs, you're probably closest to a baptist" But that ended in like eighth grade. I mean, why should I have to label my faith? I'm already a Christian, is there more to it than that?  I know there are differences between denominations. but that shouldn't separate us. Hello? We're Christians, we are apart of one body. How can a body be separated? If my eye pops out of my head, turns around and says 'hey, I'm apart of Sara's Body, but I'm also separate from everything else here, I'm Saran but I'm an eyeish-saran' don't you think that's going to hurt me? Like me in my basic self is not good enough for my eye!  I think that's how Jesus must feel. We were all the same back in Palestine. Yea, they had issues and doctrinal questions over things like circumsision and kosher. But they didn't separate and go, 'I'm a galilean Christian, are you a Jerusaleman Christian?' The few times that they did that, and started talking about who they followed (apollo, paul) Someone turned yelled at them and they got right back into line. I think Jesus sometimes must be sitting up there looking at us fighting over stupid things that don't even matter, and I think he's saying something like *sigh* 'my children, I love them to death, but they can be so stupid! Don't they understand anything? I died for them so that they could be one with me, and one with eachother. Now they're screwing it up again over dumb things. Was my death not enough to hold them together? It's no wonder they aren't getting anything done! It's too bad they aren't like the Muslims who actually have their act together when it comes to unification. How can they expect to get anything done, if they're fighting all the time!? Hello???!!! I DIED FOR YOU! GET IT? THAT'S ALL IT TAKES. THAT'S ALL IT'S ABOUT!!! Now just try to stop fighting and see me again? Please?'  Because that's what we're doing. We're fighting over stupid things. And when we can't agree, when we can't stop fighting, how do you expect us to move and share Jesus with everyone else? It's impossible!  And there shouldn't be anything to fight about. We have to come back to the basics, because that is what got us here in the first place. We have to come back to Jesus. His death and his resurrection. Beyond that, nothing matters. Because beyond that, nothing gets you to heaven. Nothing keeps you out of hell. Nothing is worth living for. Worth dying for.  If we all believe that, why are we fighting?

      Lord, I want to be a servant of the King! And I want my life to be inspired by all You bring.  But for this I must die!  And sometimes it's hard to understand the reasons why!  Isn't there wome way I can save a piece of me?  Isn't there somehow You can take this cup from me?  Lord, I hear You whispering that this is how it has to be.  But, my God, it's awfully hard to say goodbye to me.  Hold me close as I say goodbye to me, Let my heart know that you are all I need,  I'll stay right here on my knees, Until I have the strength to say goodbye to me. 'Cause i'm tired of livin' somehwere in-between My love for you and my love for me. So take whatever's left of me I sacrifice it, Lord to Thee, Goodbye to me!  Help me cast down every idol that I've built Lord, and lay them all where Calvary's blood was spilt, There where You sacrificed Yourself for me, Now it's my turn, Lord, to die for Thee!  Hold me close as I say goodbye to me, Let my heart know that you are all I need,  I'll stay right here on my knees, Until I have the strength to say goodbye to me. 'Cause i'm tired of livin' somehwere in-between My love for you and my love for me. So take whatever's left of me I sacrifice it, Lord to Thee, Goodbye to me!

      Well. It was one month yesterday. Sitting on the plane looking out the window, it was weird. It seems like years ago that Suzie picked me up at the airport, but then, I can't believe that I am already at home and it's over.  God did a lot on that trip. I learned a lot about myself, how God works (or doesn't) and boys. Which I know is weird to learn about on a mission trip, but I really needed to.   It feels good to be home. I just can't believe it's over. I can't believe that I won't go to the church tonight and hear Kenneth say something about his nipples (how did that start again?) and the leaders won't stare at us becuse they don't know he meant dimples. It's so weird to think that I won't see Brian again, and I won't drive with that maniac for another year, and hello? I can't believe the tping with Mary Jo is over. I can't imagine not going to the church tonight, I can't imagine not seeing Connor tell Jose what he's doing wrong with the mime tonight.  I just can't believe it's over. What do I do now?

      To all you supporters of Stem Cell research: Bah! I agree with the whole idea I guess, you know about helping people with alzimers (sp?) and parkinson's but I do NOT agree with taking apart unborn babies, cause that's what they are; like it or not! But  urlLink here  is something that I heard on the radio and did a little research on. Maybe we can agree on this.  Bah.

      Bebo Norman concert time tonight :)  It's on the tip of my heart, the words to say  But I fall apart and I walk away  There's an angry world pressed against my back  And at every turn I keep looking back  And I know you promise me  Love through eternity  So why can't I just hold on   I want to live, I want to love  But I'm afraid my simple faith will never be enough  I want to laugh, I want to be set free  And let you hold all that my soul has deep inside of me  But I don't know where to start  It's on the tip of my heart   So would you take my hand, because I'm sinking in  To this life I've made, but don't understand  The clock moves so slowly, but time goes so fast  In this whirlwind world that will never last  This love you're giving me  It's not just make believe  Help me just to hold one  You open the sky, and open my eyes  And all my fears are scattered away  So I walk in grace, because I've seen your face  You are all that matters to me   So I'm gonna live, I'm gonna love  I'm not afraid because your grace will always be enough  I'm gonna laugh, I'm gonna be set free  And let you hold all that my soul has deep inside of me  You have shown me where to start  It's on the tip of my heart  -"Tip of My Heart"

      This song is my most favorite song in the entire universe. I will never get sick of it, ever. I don't know what it is about this song that is so great, but it just is. I love it. :) So everyone should listen to it sometime.   Hello I've waited here for you Everlong  Tonight  I throw myself into And out of the red out of her head she sang  Come down and waste away with me Down with me Slow out you wanted it to be Over my head, out of my head she sang  And I wonder When I sing along with you If everything could ever feel this real forever If anything could ever be this good again The only thing I'll ever ask of you You've got to promise not to stop when I say when She said  Breathe out So I can breathe you in Hold you in  And now I know you've always been Out of your head out of my head i sang  And I wonder When I sing along with you If everything could ever feel this real forever If anything could ever be this good again The only thing I'll ever ask of you You've got to promise not to stop when I say when She said  And I wonder If everything could ever feel this real forever If anything could ever be this good again The only thing I'll ever ask of you You've got to promise not to stop when I say when  -Foo Fighters, "Everlong"

      I am the only one to blame for this Somehow it all adds up the same Soaring on the wings of selfish pride I flew too high and like Icarus I collide With a world I try so hard to leave behind To rid myself of all but love to give and die  To turn away and not become Another nail to pierce the skin of one who loves more deeply than the oceans, more abundant than the tear Of a world embracing every heartache  Can I be the one to sacrifice Or grip the spear and watch the blood and water flow  To love you - take my world apart To need you - I am on my knees To love you - take my world apart To need you - broken on my knees  All said and done I stand alone Amongst remains of a life I should not own It takes all I am to believe In the mercy that covers me  Did you really have to die for me? All I am for all you are Because what I need and what I believe are worlds apart  I look beyond the empty cross forgetting what my life has cost and wipe away the crimson stains and dull the nails that still remain More and more I need you now, I owe you more each passing hour the battle between grace and pride I gave up not so long ago So steal my heart and take the pain and wash the feet and cleanse my pride take the selfish, take the weak, and all the things I cannot hide take the beauty, take my tears the sin-soaked heart and make it yours take my world all apart take it now, take it now and serve the ones that I despise speak the words I can't deny watch the world I used to love fall to dust and thrown away I look beyond the empty cross forgetting what my life has cost so wipe away the crimson stains and dull the nails that still remain so steal my heart and take the pain take the selfish, take the weak and all the things I cannot hide take the beauty, take my tears take my world apart, take my world apart I pray, I pray, I pray  -Jars of Clay, "Worlds Apart"  Concert is on November 19th... if I'm lucky, I'll be at it. :)

      How long have I been in this storm So overwhelmed by the ocean's shapeless form Water's getting harder to tread With these waves crashing over my head   If I could just see You Everything will be alright If I'd see you The storminess will turn to light   And I will walk on water And You will catch me if I fall And I will get lost into Your eyes And everything will be alright And everything will be alright   I know You didn't bring me out here to drown...  If I could just see You Everything will be alright. -Lifehouse, "Storm"  Maybe someday I can learn to trust You And just stop thinking with my head Cause maybe someday I could learn to let go I lose control but that's okay with me I lose control but tell me what is wrong with that   Why do I have to know everything And why does everything always have to make sense Why do I always have to have You figured out Cause I just want to take Your hand    Cause You say if I fall I will Fall straight into Your arms Should I trip over my feet And if I start to slip I will Slip right onto my knees Into the center of Your hands.  -Lifehouse, "What's Wrong With That"

      My sources (Ryan Farrell) suck. He told me that the people who went TPing got pulled over by the cops and had to clean up everything, and then Z got his license revoked. But apparently Austin Curry decided to make up a story about the whole TPing experience. What really happened was they went down to Castle Rock and TPed people there. Yeah.... anyways. :)

      Avs update: Win in Nashville with a score of 5-3. Kono scored his first goal with the Avs (it was an empty netter, but who cares). Foppa scored one too, and Hejduk got 2. I don't know who scored the other goal because I only caught the third period because I forgot about it. Yeah, yeah - I'm a bad fan. But it wasn't on TV. Tomorrow, they come back home and play the Buffalo Sabres and Chris Drury, who is my favorite non-Av.   And, for anyone who cares... Marlins up 2-0 in the 9th inning of the game that could win them the world series. (I'm not watching it either, they just said it on the radio.)

Also, Gordie Howe, while on a recent trip to Florida, discovered the fountain of youth and will come back to play with the Avalanche. The New Jersey Devils have decided Brodeur isn't the "goalie of the future" for them, and in a bold move have traded him to the Avalanche for a 4th round pick. The Stars, deciding to go with the recent "rebuilding" trend in the NHL, have decided to dump some salary by trading Turco to the Avs for Martin Skoula and a broken skate that was found by the cleaning staff behind Roy's old locker. In a suprise move, Scotty Bowman has decided to come out of retirement to coach the Avalanche. Tony Granato will be demoted to second assistant towel boy. In light of these recent moves, the rest of the NHL has decided to forfeit the rest of the season and award the Stanley Cup to the Avalanche permanently. The NHL awards ceremony will be held next week, where every award will be given to Peter Forsberg.

Brandy: Geez, even  I  could find better things to fight about.  (this one was actually on the fall retreat also, I just forgot about it.) Joy: I went for a run this morning, and I saw these deer, and then I got to a place where you can look down over this like pasture and there were these that were like RACING across it -  Mark: It was just like Seabiscuit.  (in newspaper) Katie: My friend LOVED your story. Jeff: Your friend? Katie: The guy that I'm dating. Jeff: Oh really - what does THAT mean? Katie: You know... we go out sometimes.  (in seminar) Ashley: You're scary. Sarah:  You're  scary. Ashley I  know  I'm scary.  Katie: I'm taking points off of anyone who disses on the Yankees today. Mike: I wish  I  lost 6-4 last night...

      "I saw a TV show recently wherein a group of hip hop DJs competed to see who was the best at making sounds with a record turntable. They'd put the needle on a record, they they'd spin the turntable forward and backward violently, thereby creating unique, by which I mean ugly, noises. I used to do that when I was seven, and my mom would yell, 'STOP FOOLING WITH THE RECORD PLAYER!' But these guys were serious; they had expressions of intense concentration, as though it took vast artistic skill to simulate the sound of deranged squirrels fighting in an amplifier." -Dave Barry,  Dave Barry is Not Taking This Sitting Down!   "To really understand the mysteries of the universe, you should look at it first-hand. The best time to do this is at night, when the universe is clearly visible from lawns. As you gaze at it, many age-old questions will probably run through your mind, the main one being: Are you wearing shoes? The reason I ask is, recently I was standing barefoot on my lawn, and I got attacked on the right big toe by a fire ant. This is an extremely ungracious style of insect that was accidentally imported into the southern United States from somewhere else, probably hell." -Dave Brary,  Dave Barry's Greatest Hits   "when will i learn to be alone?/ how can i learn to let go of you?/ everyone can see me,/ but i can't see myself./ have you seen the key that leads to me?/ why do i suck at putting smiles on their faces...?/ why am i only funny to myself?/ how come no one understands what i say.../ but i thought i didn't know myself./ i hate everyone/ but only on certain days./ i think you're all annoyed by me,/ so i'll leave,/ and find myself." -rooney  "i try and clear my mind of you. you're wasting all my days, but i don't know just what to do without you in my way. i've spent all year avoiding everything else, they don't matter... i try and get as close as i can, but now i have been shattered. shut me out and i'll scream a shout - i can't be alone - say goodbye and i want to die. don't leave me alone... i think about you constantly. i don't have a choice, but when i just want to relax, i need to hear your voice. i've spent all year avoiding everything else - they don't matter. i try and get as close as i can... but now i have been shattered."-rooney  The era immediately after World War I came to be known as the "Roaring Twenties," and with good reason: Each of the years had a "twenty" in it, as in 1923, 1925, and so forth. Also there was a lot of wild and zany activity, with "flappers" going to "speakeasies" where they would listen to "jazz," dance the "Charleston," and drink "bathtub gin" until they "puked" all over the "floor." -Dave Barry,  Dave Barry Slept Here

      Book recommendation:  urlLink Eli  by Bill Myers. I'm only 100 pages in, but seriously... if you're struggling in your faith or having trouble relating the Bible to your life, this is the book to read. It's amazing - it's a book about what if Jesus Christ hadn't come two thousand years ago but today. It's so awesome to see how Jesus would have interacted with everyone in our society. It really puts everything into perspective, and I'm loving it. It makes the entire gospel seem so much more personal and Jesus seem so much more... real. Ahh, it's just so good, I can't really explain it, so you should just read it, like I'm going to go do right now. I can't put it down.

      Book recommendation:  urlLink Blink  by Ted Dekker. I'm not finished with it yet but I love it. Very thrilling and fast paced. This style of writing is my favorite kind - the kind I like to write in. (The main guy in it, Seth Border, reminds me of Mark Seifert, looks-wise. Just a side note.)

      Time for a dose of "Stuff Sarah Wrote A Long Time Ago." I haven't written anything in a while.   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Swirling lyrics Reminding me of Everything I’m missing  Don’t think I’d mind Too much if it was You I could be kissing  How lovely you’ll always Seem to me when Your eyes pour into mine  Always I feel As if I’ll never Escape this twirling vine  -3/28/03  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Sometimes it's okay Sometimes it's just fine Most times it's controversial If you ever cross the line   Sometimes it's not reality Seldom is it true Just hold me once and I'll recall A lifetime forth with you  -12/12/02  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  i'm empty inside...  i wish i could tell you how much you mean to me  my eyes are dry from crying  and you don't even know the only thing i fear is that you won't ever know the thorns outnumber everything and i  can't see the sky anymore...  "you're so very special i wish i was special"  just tell me what to do because you're all that i could ever want  4/26/03  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Then my hindered sight goes black Revealing all the things I lack The heart inside my chest gone cold Destroying that which once was bold All I thought I knew is dead I must have missed some thing you said Or maybe what I thought I heard The sound of lovely silent word Believing what you did not say Everything I hold at bay Salty tears in my eyes brew Gently falling drops of dew Marvel at the state of life Ignore the numbing sense of strife Enduring pain, I clench my fist And banish myself to the mist…  -Murder of a Feeling I don't remember when I wrote that  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

His every movement, his manners, the sound of his voice made me tremble. When a passion like this gets ahold of you, it never lets you go, never till your last breath.

How happy I was!” –Ayn Rand, “The Husband I Bought”  “I'm looking for the perfect pillow - I think it's somewhere near yours.” –Ashleigh Brilliant  “I never knew what an engineer did for a living when I was a kid.

      Non-Candid Quote Goodness:  "I've never understood why women love cats. Cats are independent, they don't listen, they don't come in when you call, they like to stay out all night, and when they're home they like to be left alone and sleep. In other words, every quality that women hate in a man, they love in a cat."-Jay Leno  "I'll probably stay lucky if my tounge will stay tied so I won't betray the things that I hide. There's not enough years underneath this belt for me to admit the way that I felt."-Seven Mary Three  "Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist when he grows up."-Pablo Picasso  "True love is always shattered by reality."  "The young man or woman writing today has forgotten the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself which alone can make good writing because only that is worth writing about, worth the agony and the sweat."-William Faulkner  "Love is not something you're able to feel when you reach a certain age, it's something that's always inside of you. It just depends on when you find a person who can bring that out in you."  “Calling it a simple schoolgirl crush was like saying a Rolls Royce was a vehicle with four wheels, something like a hay wagon. She did not giggle wildly and blush when she saw him, nor did she chalk his name on trees or write it on the walls of the kissing bridge.

And it’s not because I’m lonely, and it’s not because it’s New Year’s Eve. I came here tonight because when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible.” –From the movie “When Harry Met Sally”  “At a glance, I love you with a thousand hearts.”  “After you’ve been to college for a while, you start to expect yourself to dislike a poem for certain stock specific reasons, because whenever you’re in a poetry class and it’s discussion time and you raise your hand to say that you like a poem, the professor will as you What You Like About It and you have to have some kind of definitive answer, in order to get a class discussion going, otherwise you’re going to look really dumb in front of a lot of other literary-type people. If you just say, ‘I don’t know really, I just like it a lot’ then there’ll be some awkward silence while the other students think snickeringly in tandem, ‘man, that dude just doesn’t get it.’ What’s ‘It,’ though? I used to kind of be really nervous about establishing what ‘It’ was about a lot of poems that I liked, and then I’d get frustrated because I also always thought that it sounded really stupid to spout off the same specific reasons for liking poems – because believe me, in class, you hear the same things over and over again, like ‘I like the imagry’ (that’s #1) or ‘the poem really flows’ or it’s the metaphors or the symbolism or the sounds or the way that X plays off Y, etc., etc. Whatever. Stock answers. It’s the same genus of stock responses as the ones you hear about burgeois-types at art galleries. ‘I love his use of color.’ (That makes me laugh endlessly – Leo even says it in Titanic.) ‘Wow, I really like the composition on this one.’ ‘Look at the play of light and shadow.’ Uh-huh. Even on the off chance that I DO like a painting because of its color, or its contrasts, I’d at least find another way to say it than what they say on every museum tour and in every Introduction to Art. Or do I even NEED to say it? Or anything? One thing I’ve learned from college (and I probably didn’t need to get the parents to shell out all the exorbiant amounts of tuition to get this particular nugget of wisdom) is that verbal appreciation can only go so far. At some point you start liking a poem for reasons that you yourself just don’t understand. You’re just not supposed to be able to articulate exactly WHY you like a certain thing in art or literature or whatever. It just makes you feel a certain way, and if you try to put that feeling into what few and feeble words we have at our disposal, you sort of cheapen the whole thing.” –Scott “Scotch” Herman  “A simple friend wonders about your romantic history. A real friend could blackmail you with it.”  “When I saw you, I fell in love, and you smiled because you knew…”  “I have come to believe over and over again that what is most important to me must be spoken, made verbal and shared, even at the risk of having it bruised or misunderstood.”  “We can’t always be Washingtons, but we can all be patriots.” –Charles F. Browne  “If I have to lay an egg for my country, I’ll do it.” –Bob Hope  “We would rather die on our feet than live on our knees.” –FDR  “You cannot conquer America.” –William Pitt  “Too much time cannot be spent in a task that is to endure for centuries.” –Augustus Saint-Gaudens  "Wouldn't it be nice if we could live just twice in just one life? And then I would know what to do when I'm shaking in my shoes and my heart skips a beat over you."-The Promise Ring  "I'm drowning here, and you're describing the water."-"As Good As It Gets"  "Charlie Brown is the one person I identify with. CB was such a loser. He wasn't even the star of his own Halloween special."-Chris Rock  "I drowned my sorrows but they learned how to swim."-U2 "Until the End of the World"  "Anything worth doing is worth overdoing."-David Letterman

      Sarah's Life Update: I had the greatest time at homecoming last night. We went to the Cheesecake Factory for dinner and then to the dance, and it was amazing. The only thing that wasn't as great was the music - there were like two slow songs and almost everything else was rap. It was annoying. But it was okay because it was so much fun.

They are the best kind of girls, I think.

Non-Candid Quote Goodness:  “He smiled understandingly – much more than understandingly. It was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it that you may come across four or five times in life. It faced – or seemed to face – the whole external world for an instant, then concentrated on you with an irrisistable prejudice in your favor. It understood you just so far as you wanted to be understood, believed in you as you would like to believe in yourself and assured you that it had precisely the impression of you that, at your best, you hoped to convey.” – F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby  “The snow came in a big white blanket./ It covered up some of the memories./ I had come home to recover./ The snow can be so cold sometimes.” –The Lyndsay Diaries, “A Farewell to Autumn”  “I promise this won't be another song about being alone but all I feel is regret/ and I can't find the nerve to pick up the telephone./ I was thinking about how it drives me crazy just to feel your hand in mine,/ and how simple that is/ and I've thought about saying no to hope/ but I have this funny habit of putting pictures up on the wall of you and me./ I know that priorities never understand reality/ and time never lends itself to those who are waiting on love./ But it is overdue that we should share this night and Grace,/ your smile is the only thing that keeps me breathing./ The hours pass by like minutes when I'm with you./ The hours pass like minutes in the rain./ So lets stand here in the rain forever.” –The Lyndsay Diaries, “Mixtapes and Memories  “Ride the railroad that drives the nails and write it down in your diary/ Because this is better than a photograph./ This isn't going to be another shot in the dark/ but only another step closer to seperation./ Remember not remembering?/ It all ends here sometimes./ Let's sit back, tip the glass, and say those were the days/ because this is where the sidewalk ends.” –The Lyndsay Diaries, “Where the Sidewalk Ends”  "I wanna write the perfect song and play it just for you." -Thrice, "In Years to Come"  “Time you enjoy wasting is never wasted.” –John Lennon  "The moment may be temporary, but the memory lasts forever."

      I just couldn't wait until tomorrow to post more quotes. I just think this is the coolest thing ever.  Non-Candid Quote Goodness:  "You know, I used to think it was awful that life was so unfair.

But I won't live for you." -Stephen Chbosky,  The Perks of Being a Wallflower   “We all have our simple ways of killing ourselves, and this is yours:/ denying it all by covering it up./ You were never the best at smiling,/ so stay up all night/ just to say you are tired./ I think I'll stay in tonight./ I can't help to think thoughts of home./ I miss the chairs at the coffee shop/ doing nothing for five minutes and talking for hours./ Conversation never ran dry./ We all have our simple ways of killing our thoughts,/ and this is yours and I have mine.” –The Lyndsay Diaries, “How We Kill Oursevles”  “Imagination is more important than knowledge... knowledge is limited, but imagination encircles the world. To see with one's own eyes, to feel and judge without succumbing to the suggestive power of the fashion of the day, to be able to express what one has seen and felt in a trim sentence or even in a cunningly wrought word... is that not glorious? When I examine myself and my methods of thought, I come close to the conclusion that the gift of imagination has meant more to me than my talent for absorbing absolute knowledge.” –Albert Einstein  Okay I'm done now.

      I hate it when the Avs tie. Oh well, it's better than a loss. Even if it is pretty unsatisfying to watch. Thank goodness there's more to life than self-gratification. ;) My dad is playing this game with annoying music on it on the other computer. We have two Dells now. They are both fairly new, so it's nice having two computers that work now. Our old Gateway just kind of died on us.

      Want a Donut?   There was a certain Professor of THEOLOGY named Dr.  Christianson, a studious man who taught at a small college in the Western United States. Dr. Christianson taught the required survey course in Christianity at this particular institution. Every student was required to take this course his or her freshman year regardless of his or her major.   Although Dr. Christianson tried hard to communicate the essence of the gospel in his class, he found that most of his students looked upon the course as nothing but required drudgery. Despite his best efforts, most students refused to take Christianity seriously.   This year, Dr. Christianson had a special student named Steve. Steve was only a freshman, but was studying with the intent of going on to seminary for the ministry. Steve was popular, he was well liked, and he was an imposing physical specimen. He was now the starting center on the school football team, and was the best student in the professor's class.   One day, Dr. Christianson asked Steve to stay after class so he could talk with him. "How many push-ups can you do?"   Steve said, "I do about 200 every night."   "200? That's pretty good, Steve," Dr. Christianson said. "Do you think you could do 300?"   Steve replied, "I don't know... I've never done 300 at a time."   "Do you think you could?" again asked Dr. Christianson.   "Well, I can try," said Steve.   "Can you do 300 in sets of 10? I have a class project in mind and I need you to do about 300 push ups in sets of ten for this to work. Can you do it? I need you to tell me you can do it," said the professor.   Steve said, "Well... I think I can... yeah, I can do it."   Dr. Christianson said, "Good! I need you to do this on Friday. Let me explain what I have in mind."   Friday came and Steve got to class early and sat in the front of the room. When class started, the professor pulled out a big box of donuts. Now these weren't the normal kinds of donuts they were the extra fancy BIG kind, with cream centers and frosting swirls. Everyone was pretty excited it was Friday, the last class of the day, and they were going to get an early start on the weekend with a party in Dr. Christianson's class.   Dr. Christianson went to the first girl in the first row and asked, "Cynthia, do you want to have one of these donuts?"   Cynthia said, "Yes."   Dr. Christianson then turned to Steve and asked, "Steve, would you do ten push-ups so that Cynthia can have a donut?"   Steve said, "Sure," and jumped down from his desk to do a quick ten. Then Steve again sat in his desk. Dr. Christianson put a donut on Cynthia's desk.   Dr. Christianson then went to Joe, the next person, and asked, "Joe, do you want a donut?"   Joe said, "Yes."   Dr. Christianson asked, "Steve would you do ten push-ups so Joe can have a donut?" Steve did ten push-ups, Joe got a donut.   And so it went, down the first aisle, Steve did ten pushups for every person before they got their donut.   And down the second aisle, till Dr. Christianson came to Scott. Scott was on the basketball team, and in as good of a condition as Steve. He was very popular and never lacking for female companionship. When the professor asked, "Scott do you want a donut?"   Scott's reply was, "Well,can I do my own pushups?"   Dr. Christianson said, "No, Steve has to do them."   Then Scott said, "Well, I don't want one then."   Dr. Christianson shrugged and then turned to Steve and asked, "Steve, would you do ten pushups so Scott can have a donut he doesn't want?"   With perfect obedience Steve started to do ten pushups.   Scott said, "HEY! I said I didn't want one!"   Dr. Christianson said, "Look, this is my classroom, my class, my desks, and these are my donuts. Just leave it on the desk if you don't want it." And he put a donut on Scott's desk.   Now by this time, Steve had begun to slow down a little. He just stayed on the floor between sets because it took too much effort to be getting up and down. You could start to see a little perspiration coming out around his brow.   Dr. Christianson started down the third row. Now the students were beginning to get a little angry.   Dr. Christianson asked Jenny, "Jenny, do you want a donut?"   Sternly, Jenny said, "No."   Then Dr. Christianson asked Steve, "Steve, would you do ten more pushups so Jenny can have a donut that she doesn't want?" Steve did ten, Jenny got a donut.   By now, a growing sense of uneasiness filled the room. The students were beginning to say "No" and there were all these uneaten donuts on the desks. Steve also had to really put forth a lot of extra effort to get these pushups done for each donut. There began to be a small pool of sweat on the floor beneath his face, his arms and brow were beginning to get red because of the physical effort involved.   Dr. Christianson asked Robert, who was the most vocal unbeliever in the class, to watch Steve do each push up to make sure he did the full ten pushups in a set because he couldn't bear to watch all of Steve's work for all of those uneaten donuts. He sent Robert over to where Steve was so Robert could count the set and watch Steve closely. Dr. Christianson started down the fourth row.   During his class, however, some students from other classes had wandered in and sat down on the steps along the radiators that ran down the sides of the room. When the professor realized this, he did a quick count and saw that now there were 34 students in the room. He started to worry if Steve would be able to make it.   Dr. Christianson went on to the next person and the next and the next. Near the end of that row, Steve was really having a rough time. He was taking a lot more time to complete each set.   Steve asked Dr. Christianson, "Do I have to make my nose touch on each one?"   Dr. Christianson thought for a moment, "Well, they're your pushups. You are in charge now. You can do them any way that you want." And Dr. Christianson went on.   A few moments later, Jason, a recent transfer student, came to the room and was about to come in when all the students yelled in one voice, "NO! Don't come in! Stay out!"   Jason didn't know what was going on. Steve picked up his head and said, "No, let him come."   Professor Christianson said, "You realize that if Jason comes in you will have to do ten pushups for him?"   Steve said, "Yes, let him come in. Give him a donut."   Dr. Christianson said, "Okay, Steve, I'll let you get Jason's out of the way right now. Jason, do you want a donut?"    Jason, new to the room hardly knew what was going on. "Yes," he said, "give me a donut."   "Steve, will you do ten pushups so that Jason can have a donut?" Steve did ten pushups very slowly and with great effort. Jason, bewildered, was handed a donut and sat down.   Dr. Christianson finished the fourth row, then started on those visitors seated by the heaters. Steve's arms were now shaking with each pushup in a struggle to lift himself against the force of gravity. Sweat was profusely dropping off of his face and, by this time, there was no sound except his heavy breathing, there was not a dry eye in the room.   The very last two students in the room were two young women, both cheerleaders, and very popular. Dr. Christianson went to Linda, the second to last, and asked, "Linda, do you want a doughnut?"   Linda said, very sadly, "No, thank you."   Professor Christianson quietly asked, "Steve, would you do ten pushups so that Linda can have a donut she doesn't want?"    Grunting from the effort, Steve did ten very slow pushups for Linda. Then Dr. Christianson turned to the last girl, Susan. "Susan, do you want a donut?"   Susan, with tears flowing down her face, began to cry. "Dr. Christianson, why can't I help him?"   Dr. Christianson, with tears of his own, said, "No, Steve has to do it alone. I have given him this task and he is in charge of seeing that everyone has an opportunity for a donut whether they want it or not. When I decided to have a party this last day of class, I looked at my grade book. Steve, here is the only student with a perfect grade. Everyone else has failed a test, skipped class, or offered me inferior work. Steve told me that in football practice, when a player messes up he must do push ups. I told Steve that none of you could come to my party unless he paid the price by doing your push ups. He and I made a deal for your sakes. Steve, would you do ten pushups so Susan can have a donut?"   As Steve very slowly finished his last pushup, with the understanding that he had accomplished all that was required of him, having done 350 pushups, his arms buckled beneath him and he fell to the floor.   Dr. Christianson turned to the room and said, "And so it was, that our Savior, Jesus Christ, on the cross, plead to the Father, 'Into thy hands I commend my spirit.' With the understanding that He had done everything that was required of Him, he yielded up His life. And like some of those in this room, many of us leave the gift on the desk, uneaten."   wo students helped Steve up off the floor and to a seat, physically exhausted, but wearing a thin smile. "Well done, good and faithful servant" said the professor, adding "Not all sermons are preached in words."   Turning to his class the professor said, "My wish is that you might understand and fully comprehend all the riches of grace and mercy that have been given to you through the sacrifice of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, who spared not the only Begotten Son, but gave Him up for us all for the whole Church, now and forever."    Greater love hath no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends. John 15:13

      NCQG:  "I'm always assuming the worst, but you're going on none the less... And I know that you hope for longer good-byes embracing for forever, and falling in your eyes. Pouring over photographs, I'm living in your letters. Breathe deeply from this envelope - it smells like you and I can't be without that scent, it's filling me with all you mean to me Continually failing these trials but you stand by me nonetheless and you won't let me sink, though I'm begging you. I don't ever tell you this distance seems terrible. There is no need to test my heart with useless space. These roads go on forever...  There'll always be a place for you in my heart. So I'll hit the pavement, it's gotta be better than waiting and pushing you far away cause I'm scared. So I'll take my chances and head on my way up there, cause turning to you is like falling in love when you're ten." -Dashboard Confessional, "Living in Your Letters"  "I'm dying to know do you do you like dreaming of things so impossible or only the practical, or ever the wild? or waiting through all your bad bad days just to end them with someone you care about? and do you like making out, and long drives and brown eyes and guys that just don't quite fit in yeah do you like them...? So yes, I'll see you there." -Dashboard Confessional, "So Impossible"  "Sooner or later this cold It's gonna break and our hands will be warm again But all I want is not to need you now And sooner or later this cold It's gonna break and our words will be heard again But all I want are vows of silence now." -Dashboard Confessional, "Turpentine Chaser"  "I'm starting to fashion an idea in my head where I would impress you with every single word I said. I'd come out insightful, or brave or smooth or charming, and you'd wanna call me, and I would be there every time you need me, I'd be there every time. But for now I'll look so longingly, waiting for you to want me, for you to need me, for you to notice me."

      Walking down the avenue I breathe in the air with you City lights singing melodies Trolley wheels humming harmonies We could talk of the autumn air Fly to the skies that the angels share We could soar in a summer breeze Or swim in a sea of fallen leaves I don't care what we do Just as long as I'm with you  I'll be loving every minute Of every day that has you in it I'll be loving every minute with you  Let's go to the willow shade Let's fall asleep at heaven's gates Or run with the river to the sea We'll shoot the stars from Saturn's rings We'll take a trip from here to the park Sit on a bench and have a talk Recall all the times we've had Laugh at the good  Forget the bad, oh I don't care what we do Just as long as I'm with you -Stereo Motion, "Loving Every Minute"

Something else that happened at youth group tonight: We did this service project related to Celebration Sunday (which is the big finale of 40 Days of Purpose) in which we put these fortune cookies in these little chinese food boxes. (The fortunes are like "Your purpose is discipleship!" or "Your purpose is worship!" and so on with all of the 5 purposes that are in that book.) (Which I haven't been reading.) We had a bunch of cookies leftover so we all got one if we wanted one (my purpose is evangelism!) and I was talking to Cindy and Chris Klein after, and I gave the wrapper to Cindy, since I didn't want it, and then she gave it to Chris, who stared at it for a second and then put it in his mouth.

      I was cleaning out my desk and I found this poem that I wrote on March 8, 2003. Interpret it as you will.... it's called Silver Mountain Pass.  There's silence in your mood again Simple pain and lost remain Never shall they see this world Through the eyes that you've unfurled Jingling another path Devastating aftermath Along the silver mountain pass Shoving on transparent glass Mocking me, you seem to be Disregard this silent plea Deciphering your words and think Standing nearer to the brink Should I go or should I stay? Leaving all this earth's decay Every day I look for you Drenched with silver mountain dew Your mystery intrigues me so I see the silver side below Atop the mountain pass I stand Beholding all of life so grand Numbing me to my despair Wind is combing golden hair It seems the best of all began So I'll keep you while I can

Unless it's from Long John Silver's and deep-fried."  -Jessica Simpson  "I like most of the places I've been to, but I've never really wanted to go to Japan, simply because I don't really like eating fish, and I know that's very popular out there in Africa, but the whole thing just doesn't appeal to me." -Britney Spears

       My life is up and it is down I try to keep both feet on the ground Your love is all that gets me through All I need on this earth is You And I can hear Your voice reciting: "I'm here I'm closer than your breath I've conquered even death I am still here, just like I was then You can't remember when I was not here." Jesus, You're the author of my heart Told me you wanted every part Now my life and it's demands Are resting safely in your hands. And I can hear your voice inviting: "I'm here I never leave your side My stubborn weary child I am still here Please let me lead you on Your race is already won I am your God."  -Leigh Nash, "You're Here"  From City on a Hill

      All My Weirdness:  (first meeting of Evangelism Club, which is led by Lauren and Charlie, who both came late) Lauren: Wow, I'm really surprised there are this many people, I didn't think that this many would come. Alex: I didn't think anyone would be on time leadership-wise and I was RIGHT!  "Texas is so flat, you can watch your dog run away for two weeks."  -Keith Davis, Red Ribbon Week speaker  (Talking about I-Searches and overachievers) Ryan Spalding: You think you've got it bad, I have to go today, after that Kyrsten girl. That girl is like a (deleted) genius. Brandon: Only because she doesn't have anything better to do.  (Grading each other's papers in English) Ryan S.: Cursive is really hard to read. Micaela: Sorry, I have bad handwriting. Ryan S.: No, I just can't read it very well. Brandon: Yeah, it's even harder when you're trying to cheat on her on a stupid vocab quiz.  "I HATE that Rachelle girl. She's like this awful incarnation of eveil. I hope she gets struck down. Or RUN OVER, one of the two. She won't be so happy when she's BOUNCING OFF THE HOOD OF MY CAR."  -Ryan S. when he was having a bad day and this cheerleader was acting like a third grader and throwing pennies at him for no reason  "Life is too short to keep your opinion to yourself." -Ryan S.  Ryan S.: Are you gonna glare at me every time you see me now? Rachelle: I wasn't glaring at you, I was giving you a dirty look.  Ryan S.: Oh, well that's better.

      NCQG:  "Without God man has no reference point to define himself. 20th century philosophy manifests the chaos of man seeking to understand himself as a creature with dignity while having no reference point for that dignity." -R. C. Sproul  "Whence comes this idea that if what we are doing is fun, it can't be God's will? The God who made giraffes, a baby's fingernails, a puppy's tail, a crooknecked squash, the bobwhite's call, and a young girl's giggle, has a sense of humor. Make no mistake about that." -Catherine Marshall   "If God were small enough to be understood, He would not be big enough to be worshiped." -Evelyn Underhill    "With God, we make no deals. God sets all the terms; set them long ago with us in mind (while counting the potential hairs on our potential heads being formed even then within the womb of the universe). God said, 'This is the contract: I will die for you if you will let me.' Who could have imagined those terms?" -Lynne Hundley    "God's mercy with a sinner is only equalled and perhaps outmatched by His patience with the saints, with you and me." -Alan Redpath  "I believe there is nothing lovelier, deeper, more sympathetic, and more perfect than the Savior; there is in the world only one figure of absolute beauty: Christ." -Fyodor Dostoyevsky

      NCQG:  "As Christians we accept one foundational truth - God - and everything else makes sense. An atheist denies God and has to accept incredible explanations for everything else. It takes more faith to deny God than to believe in Him." -John MacArthur   "In this modern world of ours many people seem to think that science has somehow made such religious ideas as immortality untimely or old fashioned. I think science has a real surprise for the skeptics. Science, for instance, tells us that nothing in nature, not even the tiniest particle, can disappear without a trace. Nature does not know extinction. All it knows is transformation. If God applies this fundamental principle to the most minute and insignificant parts of His universe, doesn't it make sense to assume that He applies it to the masterpiece of His creation, the human soul?" -Dr.Werner Von Braun   "There are but two essential requirements: First: has anyone cheated death and proved it? Second: Is it available to me? Here is the complete record: Confucius' tomb - occupied. Buddha's tomb - occupied. Mohammed's tomb - occupied. Jesus' tomb - empty. Argue as you will. There is no point in following a loser." -G. B. Hardy   "For the scientist who has lived by his faith in the power of reason, the story ends like a bad dream. He has scaled the mountains of ignorance; he is about to conquer the highest peak; as he pulls himself over the final rock, he is greeted by a band of theologians who have been sitting there for centuries." -Robert Jastrow  "The most valuable thing the Psalms do for me is to express the same delight in God which made David dance." -C.S. Lewis  "Joy is not the absence of suffering. It is the presence of God." -Robert Schuller

      Exploding Dog update:  urlLink I'm listening to sad songs .  NCQG:  "With a weak faith and a fearful heart, many a sinner stands before the Lord. It is not the strength of our faith, but the perfection of Christ's sacrifice that saves! No feebleness of faith, nor dimness of eye, no trembling of hand can change the efficacy of Christ's blood. The strength of our faith can add nothing to it, nor can the weakness of our faith take anything from Him. Faith (weak or strong) still reads the promise, 'the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin.' If at times my eye is so dim that I cannot read these words, through blinding tears or bewildering trials, faith rests itself on the certain knowledge of the fact that THE PROMISE IS THERE, and the blood of Christ remains in all its power and suitableness upon the altar, unchanged and unaffected." -Horatius Bonar  "Whoso loves believes the impossible." -Elizabeth Barrett Browning  "The chief pang of most trials is not so much the actual suffering itself as our own spirit of resistence to it." -Jean Nicholas Grou  "I find doing the will of God leaves me no time for disputing about his plans." -George Macdonald  "There seems to be a notion abroad that if we talk enough and pray enough, revival will set in like a stock market boom or a winning streak on a baseball club. We appear to be waiting for some sweet chariot to swing low and carry us into the Big Rock Candy Mountain of religious experience . . . a kind of benign miracle, a feverish renaissance of religious activity that will come upon us, leaving us morally as we are now, except that we will be a lot happier and there will be a great many more of us...." -A.W. Tozer  "When you resort to shouting in conflict, you are reacting in the flesh. You have lost control of the only person you can control: yourself." -Neil T. Anderson  "The beautiful thing about this adventure called faith is that we can count on Him never to lead us astray." -Chuck Swindoll  "If our greatest need had been information, God would have sent an educator. If our greatest need had been technology, God would have sent us a scientist. If our greatest need had been money, God would have sent us an economist. But since our greatest need was forgiveness, God sent us a Savior." -Roy Lessin  "It's a good thing to have all the props pulled out from under us occasionally. It gives us some sense of what is rock under our feet, and what is sand." -Madeleine L'Engle  "When was the last time you laughed for the sheer joy of your salvation? People are not attracted to somber doctrines. There is no persuasive power in a gloomy and morbid religion. Let the world see your joy and you won't be able to keep them away. To be filled with God is to be filled with joy."  "This year, or this month, or, more likely, this very day, we have failed to practise ourselves the kind of behaviour we expect from other people." -C.S. Lewis, "The Case For Christianity"  "Everyone feels benevolent if nothing happens to be annoying him at the moment." -C.S. Lewis

      NCQG:  "It's a gray and wet morning. The kind of morning that should belong to a fall day but seems to be stuck unfairly on the tail end of summer. We are northbound on Interstate 55 to Chicago, and I'm having a hard time waking up. These beautiful farms in Southern Illinois are big and lonely and spread themselves out for miles, broken only by the occasional Interstate golf course or exit oasis of fuel pumps and fast food. Morning is good. There is so much that is good in my life. I feel this need to quantify all that has been given me before I fall once again into telling you what I need or want or miss. I have spent the last 3 months gathering. Gathering thoughts and memories and time and family and home. I spent a month out in Oregon and northern California kayaking on perfect rivers every single day with a dear friend. I spent weeks alone at my family's river cabin thankful to simply build a gate or work in the yard and not say a word for days at a time. I spent a week on a beautiful island off the coast of South Carolina with my sweet family. I watched four of my closest friends get married in weddings that actually meant something. I watched the sun rise over the Atlantic Ocean and I watched it set over the Pacific. I have been given much. And it's with this sense of the richness and the depth of what I've been given that I tell you how profoundly un-rich and un-deep I feel lately. It's hard to explain the state of "emotionless-ness" that I'm in right now, except to say that I absolutely hate it. It's not really a numb sensation where you feel somehow oblivious to all that's around you. (That particular sensation can actually be really nice sometimes - like a long Sunday afternoon lying on the couch in and out of sleep watching two football teams that you care nothing about play a completely meaningless game). Just turning your brain off - however it happens - is a good thing every now and then. No, this is more of a state of - I don't know - it's more like being stuck inside on a Sunday afternoon when you could be somewhere else doing something else. It's kind of like boredom. When you're bored you're not just idle, you're idle with a knawing sense that you don't want to be idle at all. It's like having to sit when you want to stand. Or trying to go to sleep when you're wide-awake. It's really just anxiousness without really knowing what you're anxious about. However it's defined, there is nothing more tiresome - to wake up with it and go to sleep with it. It's a cruel thing, this lack of emotion. To be bored with music and life and, of all things, God. That is a cruel thing because music and life and, of all things, God, are the gifts to me for which I want to be, and should be, and usually am so eternally thankful. And part of me feels like a spoiled child even mentioning these things to you. (As I said, I have been given much). But for some reason I feel this strange need to tell you these things. And it's not because I've found some solution or have some moral to tell - that's probably pretty obvious. I think it's partly because I have this hope that you would actually be able to relate somehow, and even though I'll probably never know for sure that's somehow quite settling. But I think it's mostly because I'd like to ask you to pray for me. I hope you don't think that selfish, but I am certain that no one thing could be more valuable to be right now than your prayer. And please know this: I still know without question that God is good and real and faithful - in fact, it's with that truth that I look hopefully and expectantly forward. After all, God is bigger than mountains and oceans and even my faithless boredom." -Bebo Norman, "Journals" (which is a thing on his website)  "I did not realize this, but apparently weasels are relentless creatures." -Bebo Norman, "Journals" (it makes sense in the context, but it's funnier this way.)  "Dear Lord, teach me how to rest and how to love and how to hope and how to search each day for a look at you. Teach me how to dream and how to cry and how to bend but not break at the sight of you." -Bebo, "Journals"  "I have beaten my brain for weeks to come up with something meaningful to write, and have found instead that the gift of the last few weeks has been that there is nothing all too meaningful in my brain. In other words, my brain has successfully been turned off (or down at least) in a way that has allowed me to simply just be. And that is something that I pray for quite often. By the way, none of this is to say that when my brain happens to be on, that the meaningful thoughts just pile up one behind another until they spill over into well constructed profundities and songs. I do think that I'm probably at my best in my songs as far as organizing any thoughts that I may have, but the sad truth is that I'm not a very prolific songwriter. So, if my thoughts are at their best in the songs that I write, and I write maybe 8 or 10 songs every year, and if each song is about 4 or 5 minutes long, then I figure that I've got, at best, about 50 minutes a year or 8.219 seconds a day where I'm full of good, meaningful thought. (I think I just depressed myself.) At any rate, I've decided that rather than focus on what I've been thinking lately (since there has not been much of that), I should simply just focus on what I've been doing. And what have I been doing?. Well, to be quite honest, not a whole lot. And it's been really nice." -Bebo, "journals"  "I suppose I might live this cycle, this inconsistency, for the rest of my life. God, I hope not. If nowhere else, I pray that I might find consistency in just this one portion of my lifeÂ·this part where I sit down quiet each day to wait. To wait on emotion, or spirit, or words. To wait on songs, and silence, and coffee. To wait on God. LORD Jesus, teach me in this day how to wait on you. Remind me every day to sit and wait even if just for a short while on God.     A quiet and peaceful morning. I have a new coffee table - candles lit on top of it. Dad had a heart attack Saturday morning. God saved him. I want to go to church. But it's only Tuesday. " -Bebo, "Journals"  "I think this is my place now. It's a matter of finding the right chair. It's all about perspective. Funny how the right room can feel like the wrong room from the wrong chair." -Bebo, "Journals"  "I guess that's the bottom line - when it all comes down to it, all of our lives are pretty ordinary. For all the people we may be in front of each night, we still go home to our little families and our neighborhoods and a handful of good friends who know us and love us just as we are. For all the cities that we travel to, we all have one little picture in the back of our minds that looks like home. And when it all comes down to it, the only thing extraordinary about any of us is the fact that there is this great big God who has seen fit to take this great big Love and somehow fit it into our little insignificant hearts. That's extraordinary. That's worth living for, no matter how the living looks. I am overwhelmed right now with the fact that God is good. I think life as a believer comes down to one thing thankfulness. Right now I'm thankful to have played for 14,000 people. I'm thankful for two nights in my own bed. I'm thankful for snow in Indiana and rain in Nashville. I'm thankful that God loves me in spite of myself. I'm thankful that there is nothing extraordinary about this life apart from the giver of it. I am thankful that God is good." -Bebo, "Journals"  "A certain perspective shift can happen at times like this. It's not a decision or a choice. It just takes hold and you look up one day and realize that you've been seeing color instead of black and white. It's not a decision or a choice. It's more of a grace. And everything seems to be cast in that color now. Every scenario - best and worst case - seems to be cast in that color. I think it's the color of peace. And I can't seem to get away from it; but then again, I'm not trying too hard." -Bebo, "Journals"   "I guess no one told them in Minnesota that spring is here. Two days ago, I was in Tennessee kayaking in 70-degree weather. So I stepped off the bus this morning (it was actually about 1pm but, hey, that's morning to me), fully garbed in my Chaco sandals and a short sleeved T - my monotonously typical spring wardrobe. Shocking. That's all I can say - simply shocking. Once I dug out the snow that had lodged itself between my toes, I realized that we weren't in Kansas anymore (literallyâ€¦we were in Kansas City when I went to sleep last night). I learned quite tragically that the high temperature today in Minneapolis, MN would barely break freezing, and so I sulked. I was truly sad. And then I turned belligerent. Despite the many cries that shouted, 'SOCKS, you MUST wear socks here in Minnesota,' I stubbornly refused to yield to the peer pressure and stood fast in my Chaco's. Do you know why? It's the principle of the thing. I mean, in the name of all that is good - regardless of the popular opinion in this fine state - it's SPRING already." -Bebo, "Journals"   "It's the little consistencies in life that you begin to miss when you're out on the road for a living. Little things likeâ€¦the same silverware at every meal, or even knowing where you're meals are going to be without following little signs that say 'Catering,' or good towels (not the brand-new-never-been-washed-won't-soak-up-a-bit-of-moisture-but-will-leave-behind-a-million-little-fibers-of-towel-lint-all-over-your-body-towels that we seem to have at every venue). Little things... like the changing of the seasons. You can't even count on that out here on the road. But the consistencies that do happen in this particular line of life are pretty incredible. The fact that each and every night I get back up on a stage and sing for a living - well, that's amazing. The fact that you guys sing back - that's even more amazing. There's a reason why musicians say that they play music - we don't say that we work music, we say that we play it. And to think, this is my job. They say that if you love what you do, then you never work another day in your life." -Bebo, "Journals"  Bebo rocks my face off. And my cousin gave me a (burned) copy of his latest cd. Yay.

      Ent.  When Spring unfolds the beechen leaf, and    sap is in the bough; When light is on the wild-wood stream, and    wind is on the brow; When stride is long, and breath is deep, and    keen the mountain air, Come back to me! Come back to me, and    say my land is fair.   Entwife.  When Spring is come to garth and field,     and corn is in the blade; When blossom like a shining snow is on the     orchard laid; When shower and Sun upon the Earth with     fragrance filled the air, I'll linger here, and will not come, because    my land is fair.   Ent.  When Summer lies upon the world, and in a     noon of gold, Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves the    dreams of trees unfold; When woodland halls are green and cool,    and wind is in the West, Come back to me! Come back to me, and say my land is best.    Entwife.  When Summer warms the hanging fruit and    burns the berry brown; When straw is gold, and ear is white, and    harvest comes to town; When honey spills, and apple swells, though    wind be in the West, I'll linger here beneath the Sun, because my     land is best!   Ent.  When Winter comes, the winter wild that    hill and wood shall slay; When trees shall fall and starless night de-    vour the sunless day; When wind is in the deadly East, then in    the bitter rain I'll look for thee, and all to theel; I'll come to thee again!   Entwife.  When Winter comes, and singing ends,     when darkness falls at last; When broken is the barren boguh, and light    and labour past; I'll look for thee, and wait for thee, until we    meet again: Together we will take the road beneath the    bitter rain!   Both.  Together we will take the road that leads    into the West. And far away will find a land where both    our hearts may rest.   -Tolkien,  The Two Towers

      Samwise quotes:  "'If you don’t come back, sir, then I shan't, that's certain,' said Sam. 'Don't you leave him! they say to me. Leave him! I said. I never mean to. I am going with him, if he climbs to the Moon, and if any of those Black Riders try to stop him, they'll have Sam Gamgee to reckon with, I said.'" - The Fellowship of the Ring, p. 97  "'We might try to hurt or frighten this tree to begin with,' said Sam fiercely. 'If it don't let them go, I'll have it down, if I have to gnaw it.'" -Fellowship of the Ring p. 133   "'But you won't send him off alone, surely, Master?' cried Sam, unable to contain himself any longer, and jumping up from the corner where he had been quietly sitting on the floor. "'No indeed!' said Elrond, turning towards him with a smile. "'You at least shall go with him. It is hardly possible to separate you from him, even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not'" (Fellowship of the Ring p. 304)   "'Shelter!' muttered Sam. 'If this is shelter, then one wall and no roof make a house.'" (Fellowship of the Ring, p. 325)  "Once I do get to sleep...I shall go on sleeping whether I roll off or no. And the less said, the sooner I'll drop off, if you take my meaning." (Fellowship of the Ring, p. 386)   Frodo: "But I am going to Mordor." Sam: "I know that well enough, Mr. Frodo. Of course you are. And I'm coming with you." (Fellowship of the Ring, p. 457  "I made a promise, Mr. Frodo! A promise! Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee! And I don't mean to. I don't mean to." (Movie version, Fellowship of the Ring)    "...I'm coming too, or neither of us isn't going. I'll knock holes in all the boats first." (Fellowship of the Ring p. 457)    "Frodo, Mr. Frodo!" he called, "Don't leave me here alone! It's your Sam calling. Don't go where I can't follow!" (The Two Towers p. 384)   "I'll get there, if I leave everything but my bones behind," said Sam, "And I'll carry Mr. Frodo up myself, if it breaks my back and heart."

      Switchfoot Lyrics:  yesterday is a wrinkle on your forehead yesterday is a promise that you've broken don't close your eyes, don't close your eyes this is your life and today is all you've got now yeah, and today is all you'll ever have don't close your eyes  this is your life, are you who you want to be this is your life, is it everything you dreamed that it would be when the world was younger and you had everything to lose? -This is Your Life ~ Welcome to the fallout Welcome to resistance The tension is here Between who you are and who you could be Between how it is and how it should be  Maybe redemption has stories to tell maybe forgiveness is right where you fell Where can you run to escape from yourself? Salvation is here... -Dare You to Move ~ I wish I had what I needed To be on my own 'Cause I feel so defeated And I'm feeling alone  And it all seems so helpless And I have no plans I'm a plane in the sunset With nowhere to land  And all I see It could never make me happy And all my sand castles Spend their time collapsing  Let me know that You hear me Let me know Your touch Let me know that You love me And let that be enough -Let That Be Enough ~ Do me a favor Would you sing this to me slow? Cause I'm thinking it's my song Do me a favor Would you tell me when to let go? Cause I think I'm holding on Would you do it for me? Cause I'm playing for keeps -Playing For Keeps

      Foolish Things lyrics:  Would someone take the pulse of my heart - is it beating? Cause I’m afraid it’s rarely been used and I’ve been confused and hungry  I’ve been thinking about the way, you said things could be if I’d Drop my disguise, uncover my eyes and see you love  And fiercely clutching me is the life I’ve tried to flee But I’m still at home, I’m still alone Cause I’ve embraced myself Now fiercely after you, I’ll trembling ask of you Destroy all that I’ve held Till all I have to hold is you...  I took the rations of the surface, and I’m not satisfied Drag me deep enough to taste you I’m starving inside, I’m starving inside -Rations ~ You drew the lines of where the sea would meet the shore The sky would meet the floor Who can compare? You showed the sun just when to pass the time to night And when to come back bright Who can compare?  Needer of nothing and giver of all Every living thing survives  By the strength Your boundless love supplies Lord of power beyond compare The universe sits in Your hands And eternity is where you stand  You tell the rain clouds when to hold and when to bleed To satisfy our need Who can compare?  You made the countless stars and set them into place To fill the void of space Who can compare? -Who Can Compare ~   I know by the way that you watch me You’re wishing I’d been someone else But stuck here with me, you know we’ll never be Like the people on magazine shelves  And I don’t know where we forgot We’re all worth enough to be bought with a life  I still can’t believe that the same voice that spoke all the stars into space  Says it loves me, and it made me nothing less than what I’m meant to be. The things I’ve believed have been misconceived  By this heart that can’t understand love - Help me to see what you see in me  I’ve felt in your touch that you love me But I’m drowning in all the world’s lies The way that I see is untrue to me So this human heart’s asking for some inhuman eyes  I don’t know where, but we forgot We’re all worth enough to be bought with a life -Can't Believe

      It is snowing really hard. :( I'm sick of snow. I am going to go to college in California.

Wait, I don't know those girls. (pause) They don't need a ride." -Alex   "It's easy to be cool when you're as hot as Mandy or Megan but when your name is Justin you really have to try." -written on the orchestra room board  (in history, we did a group project involving city-states in Ancient Greece.)

      I REMEMBERED THE THING ALEX SAID! Go me. It came to me in the middle of the night last night.  (we're walking out of school to Alex's car) Victoria: Wow, it's really bright out here. My blue eyes are sensitive and it hurts. Alex: You have blue eyes? I have brown eyes. And when I stare into the sun, they burn. (pause) Oh wait, that happens to everyone.  NCQG:  "You should be ashamed of yourself having anything to do with such nonsense." -Samwise  "People who never get carried away should." -Malcolm Forbes  "Nobody realizes that some people expend tremendous energy merely to be normal." -Albert Camus  "A weary, weak and helpless worm, On thy kind arms I fall Be thou my strength and righteousness My Jesus and my all." -I don't remember, it was William someone.

I think that would make me really happy." -Aaron Karo  "I felt it shelter to speak to you." -Emily Dickenson   "Will I wait a lonely lifetime? If you want me to, I will." -The Beatles

      All My Weirdness:  (In Spanish) "I chose to do food and food is important because everyone in the world needs to eat, and people in Spain, they eat food and it's good." -Ms. Geist's example of a bad CPR project presentation speech   (In Orchestra) Tessa: You should have someone play the jingle bells. (pause) Mr. Snell: Jingle bells... jingle bells... jingle all the way... Tessa: No, like the actual jingle bells. Mr. Snell: They're called "sleigh bells." Jingle bells are the little tiny ones that go "jingle jingle." Tracy: The sleigh bells go "sleigh, sleigh."  (We are standing at the top of the stairs watching a little girl who is the daughter of one of the lunch ladies spin around on the stool her mom sits on to take money) Melanie: Do  you know why she's always here and not at school? Sarah: Maybe she's homeschooled. Erin: Maybe she's off-track. (pause) Or maybe she's a midget and she's really like 30.  (At the Avs game) Erin's dad: I saw a guy with a ThunderRidge letter jacket out there. Erin: (really excited) Who was it? Erin's dad: Who was it? It was BILL!  (In Math) Jeremy: I heard we don't have to turn in our homework until Monday. Ms. Maas: Who told you that? Jeremy: (pause) Jesus.  (At prayer group) "I have a praise, yesterday, I didn't put the parking brake on in my car and I came back and it was still in the same place." -Alex  (After prayer group) "No matter how old you get, it's still always funny to say 'fart'... (pause) I'm so immature." -Alex  (In Newspaper) "Why does Santa decide if you're naughty or nice by having you sit on his lap? I think that's kind of gross." -Mari  (In Newspaper) "I'm scared of Andrew. He's a communist." -Erin  (In Seminar) "Have you ever seen that movie where the guy says a word and then he goes, 'bla bla. To bla bla bla.' Yeah. It was really funny. It'd be even funnier if I could remember it." -Brandy  (Ryan is about to ditch science) Malorie: NO! You can't leave! You're the only fun thing in this class!" Ms. Nolte: You know, that really makes everybody else in here feel like crap. Malorie: No, you're fun too, I like making fun of blondes.  Sarah: I'm leaving now. I'm going to Evangelism club. Ryan: Fine, have fun at "vandalism club." Have fun with Corn Guy. Don't choke on his tongue. Sarah: Bite me.

      Weirdness  "If all else fails, we can just shout 'Sinners!' and throw these papers at them." -Charlie while folding these papers with church addresses on them  "What am I doing? I'm in Lauren's basement, folding sinner papers." -Dave talking to someone on his phone  Last night, I went street witnessing with the evangelism club from school. Two kids accepted Christ, and that made the whole hour and a half of praying in the freezing cold and being ridiculed for it completely worth it. After we were done, we went back to Lauren's house and after watching Lauren's 13 year old brother smoke Dave and John in ping pong, we watched Gladiator. I won't even try to explain all the ways that movie will never be a serious experience for me again, what with Charlie and Dave's commentary. It was a really amazing night.

      "Like many moms, my wife believes that a child's birthday party requires as much planning as a lunar landing -- more, actually, because you have to hire a clown. Serious moms plan birthday parties months in advance, choosing a theme -- Bob the Builder, Disney Princesses, Snoop Dogg, etc. -- and relentlessly incorporating this theme into every element of the party, including invitations, decorations, music, games, craft projects, snacks, cake, entertainment, favors, little gift bags for the favors, ribbons for the little gift bags for the favors, name tags for the ribbons for the little gift bags for the favors, and on and on until the mom has lost all touch with human reality. If you want proof, go to one of the Internet sites devoted to birthday planning, such as birthdaypartyideas.com, where moms report, in detail, the deranged lengths to which they have gone to stage birthday parties for small children. They sound like this: 'Our theme for Meghan's third birthday was 'The Enchanted Fairy Forest.' To create a 'forest' in the family room, I made full-size 'trees' out of fiberglass, which I painted brown and festooned with 17,000 'leaves' I cut by hand from green felt, accented with live squirrels that I caught using a galvanized-steel trap baited with Peter Pan creamy peanut butter. For the 'forest floor,' I brought in four tons of mulch with a Lawn Boy yard tractor. For the 'sky,' I used the actual sky, which was visible because I removed the ceiling and roof with a chain saw, which is when my husband, Ed, left me, but the overall effect was well worth it.''

      Sometimes, when I hear about all the health benefits of a vegetarian diet, I decide that I'm going to force myself to be a vegetarian. But then I realize that I hate salads, and the list of veggies I like is actually pretty short. And then the fact that cheeseburgers are the best thing in the world and sinking your teeth into one of those bad boys is like going to heaven... and that just reinforces the fact that I really don't care about being healthy. I just want to like what I eat.   Hey, wouldn't it be funny if the same people who preach about saving the rainforests were vegetarians?

      Two babies were born on the same day at the same hospital. They lay there and looked at each other. Their families came and took them away. Eighty years later, by a bizarre coincidence, they lay in the same hospital, on their deathbeds, next to each other. One of them looked at the other and said, "So. What did you think?" -- Steven Wright  Today I dialed a wrong number... The other person said, "Hello?" and I said, "Hello, could I speak to Joey?"... They said, "Uh... I don't think so... he's only 2 months old." I said, "I'll wait." -- Steven Wright  "We have to leave now. You can sing to your jacket on the way." - Barney   "'I cannot overemphasize the importance of good grammar.' How ridiculous. I could easily overemphasize the importance of good grammar. For example, I could say: 'Bad grammar is the leading cause of slow, painful death in North America,' or 'Without good grammar, the United States would have lost World War II.'" - Dave Barry,  An Utterly Absurd Look at Grammar    "I no doubt deserved my enemies, but I don't believe I deserved my friends." - Walt Whitman  "Most people don't know there are angels whose only job is to make sure you don't get too comfortable and fall asleep and miss your life." - Brian Andreas  "It is such a secret place, the land of tears." - Antoine de Saint-Exupery  "I don't like country music, but I don't mean to denigrate those who do. And for the people who like country music, denigrate means 'put down'." - Bob Newhart  "I had to make some optimistic assumptions to meet the revenue target. In week three, we're visited by an alien named D'utox Inag who offers to share his advanced technology." - Scott Adams,  Dilbert   "We are so vain that we even care for the opinion of those we don't care for." - Marie Ebner von Eschenbach  "You can tell a lot about a person by how excited they are to do the Macarena." - Janeane Garofalo  "If email had been around before the telephone was invented, people would have said, 'Hey, forget email! With this new telephone invention I can actually talk to people!'" -  The Executive Speechwriter Newsletter   "What a strange illusion it is to suppose that beauty is goodness." - Leo Tolstoy   This was written by a student applying to college. He ended up attending NYU: "3A. ESSAY IN ORDER FOR THE ADMISSIONS STAFF OF OUR COLLEGE TO GET TO KNOW YOU, THE APPLICANT, BETTER, WE ASK THAT YOU ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTION: ARE THERE ANY SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCES YOU HAVE HAD, OR ACCOMPLISHMENTS YOU HAVE REALIZED, THAT HAVE HELPED TO DEFINE YOU AS A PERSON?  I am a dynamic figure, often seen scaling walls and crushing ice. I have been known to remodel train stations on my lunch breaks, making them more efficient in the area of heat retention. I translate ethnic slurs for Cuban refugees, I write award-winning operas, I manage time efficiently. Occasionally, I tread water for three days in a row.  I woo women with my sensuous and godlike trombone playing, I can pilot bicycles up severe inclines with unflagging speed, and I cook Thirty-Minute Brownies in twenty minutes. I am an expert in stucco, a veteran in love, and an outlaw in Peru.  Using only a hoe and a large glass of water, I once single-handedly defended a small village in the Amazon Basin from a horde of ferocious army ants. I play bluegrass cello, I was scouted by the Mets, I am the subject of numerous documentaries. When I'm bored, I build large suspension bridges in my yard. I enjoy urban hang gliding. On Wednesdays, after school, I repair electrical appliances free of charge.  I am an abstract artist, a concrete analyst, and a ruthless bookie. Critics worldwide swoon over my original line of corduroy evening wear. I don't perspire. I am a private citizen, yet I receive fan mail. I have been caller number nine and have won the weekend passes. Last summer I toured New Jersey with a traveling centrifugal-force demonstration. I bat .400. My deft floral arrangements have earned me fame in international botany circles. Children trust me.  I can hurl tennis rackets at small moving objects with deadly accuracy. I once read Paradise Lost, Moby Dick, and David Copperfield in one day and still had time to refurbish an entire dining room that evening. I know the exact location of every food item in the supermarket. I have performed several covert operations for the CIA. I sleep once a week; when I do sleep, I sleep in a chair. While on vacation in Canada, I successfully negotiated with a group of terrorists who had seized a small bakery. The laws of physics do not apply to me.  I balance, I weave, I dodge, I frolic, and my bills are all paid. On weekends, to let off steam, I participate in full-contact origami. Years ago I discovered the meaning of life but forgot to write it down. I have made extraordinary four course meals using only a mouli and a toaster oven. I breed prizewinning clams. I have won bullfights in San Juan, cliff-diving competitions in Sri Lanka, and spelling bees at the Kremlin. I have played Hamlet, I have performed open-heart surgery, and I have spoken with Elvis.

      "On behalf of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), I am writing to ask that you make Timothy McVeigh's final meals vegetarian ones... Mr. McVeigh's last meal, on May 16, should not involve bloodshed and the slaughter of an unwilling victim. The other animals feel every bit as much pain as we do, they are horrified at the sight and smells of the slaughterhouse, and they're afraid to die. Like us, they fight for their lives and wish to avoid pain. Please don't let Timothy McVeigh be responsible for the death of even one more living being." - Bruce Friedrich of PETA in a letter to Timothy McVeigh's warden And the response: "I cannot sustain a prolonged intellectual debate on the subject as my time is short, but I'd suggest hitting Ted Kaczynski up for his opinions on the subject." - Timothy McVeigh

      "Grown-ups like numbers. When you tell them about a new friend, they never ask questions about what really matters. They never 'What does his voice sound like?' 'What games does he like best?' 'Does he collect butterflies?'. They ask: 'How old is he?' 'How many brothers does he have?' 'How much does he weigh?' 'How much money does his father make?' Only then do they think they know him." - Antoine de Saint-Exupery,  The Little Prince   "I like to pick up hitchhikers. When they get in the car I say, 'Put on your seat belt. I want to try something. I saw it once in a cartoon, but I think I can do it.'" - Steven Wright  "I've been a fool to allow dreams to become great expectations." - Tim Rice,  Chess   "Where are you, my friend?

      Sometimes, Newspaper isn't so bad. School hasn't started yet, but today we're having a pseudo party (kind of like a pseudo tumor, which is what I had... sounds worse than it is) because the lab we usually sit around in is being used for registration today. Well, the bell just rang, better not be "late," as if you actually could be late to Newspaper. I can only think of like one teacher of mine that actually cares about tardies anymore.

      I am very happy to say that the Lady Grizzlies still own everyone in the basketball department. Of course, it was just Gateway, but a score of 85-43 looks pretty good, even if it did get boring to watch after a while.   I'm off to rot my brains watching American Idol. I actually had my mom  tape  it for me.

They have these runway shows and they have a commentator saying, 'A pretty face is your best asset this season.' As opposed to last season, when ugly girls had a free ride all the way through, when back-fat was all the rage." - Janeane Garofalo  "Try to understand that there is more thought-lessness than malice in the world. People are not out to offend you deliberately and maliciously. But all of us are thoughtless at times and do not readily realize that our words and actions are going to hurt people." - Lawrence G.

      "I want to be different. I want to be just like all the different people." - King Missile  "IT DOESN'T INTEREST ME WHAT YOU DO FOR A LIVING. I want to know what you ache for, and if you dare to dream of meeting your heart's longing. It doesn't interest me how old you are. I want to know if you will risk looking like a fool for love, for your dream, for the adventure of being alive. It doesn't interest me what planets are squaring your moon. I want to know if you have touched the center of your own sorrow, if you have been opened by life's betrayals or have become shriveled and closed from fear of further pain. I want to know if you can sit with pain, mine or your own, without moving to hide it or fade it or fix it. I want to know if you can be with joy, mine or your own, if you can dance with wildness and let the ecstasy fill you to the tips of your fingers and toes without cautioning us to be careful, to be realistic, to remember the limitations of being human. It doesn't interest me if the story you are telling me is true. I want to know if you can disappoint another to be true to yourself; if you can bear the accusation of betrayal and not betray your own soul; if you can be faithless and therefore trustworthy. I want to know if you can see beauty, even when it's not pretty, every day, and if you can source your own life from its presence. I want to know if you can live with failure, yours and mine, and still stand on the edge of the lake and shout to the silver of the full moon, 'Yes!' It doesn't interest me to know where you live or how much money you have. I want to know if you can get up, after the night of grief and despair, weary and bruised to the bone, and do what needs to be done to feed the children. It doesn't interest me who you know or how you came to be here. I want to know if you will stand in the center of the fire with me and not shrink back. It doesn't interest me where or what or with whom you have studied. I want to know what sustains you, from the inside, when all else falls away. I want to know if you can be alone with yourself and if you truly like the company you keep in the empty moments." - Oriah Mountain Dreamer  "Why does the Air Force need expensive new bombers? Have the people we've been bombing over the years been complaining?" - George Wallace  "If you can't beat your computer at chess, try kickboxing." - Anonymous  "What progress we are making. In the Middle Ages they would have burned me. Now they are content with burning my books." - Sigmund Freud  "Now, once again, we find ourselves facing rising gas prices, and the question is: This time, are we going to learn from the past? Are we finally going to get serious about energy conservation? Of course not! We have the brains of mealworms! So we need to get more oil somehow. As far as I can figure, there's only one practical way to do this. That's right: We need to clone more dinosaurs. We have the technology, as was shown in two blockbuster scientific movies,  Jurassic Park  and  Jurassic Park Returns with Exactly the Same Plot . Once we have the dinosaurs, all we need is an asteroid." - Dave Barry  "Waiting until everything is perfect before making a move is like waiting to start a trip until all the traffic lights are green." - Karen Ireland  And then there are two pillows that can be used for -- of all things -- your head. Those stay on the bed." - Scott Adams,  Dilbert Newsletter 31.0    "You cannot succeed by yourself. It's hard to find a rich hermit." - Jim Rohn  "No one is out to break your heart, it only seems that way." - Paul McCartney  "What a wonderful life I've had! I only wish I'd realized it sooner." - Colette

I just wish she hadn't started calling him 'Sweetie' and living with him and having his kids and marrying him and stuff. It's really starting to make me wonder if she wants a future with me or not." - Derek Maness  "There comes a time when you should stop expecting other people to make a big deal about your birthday.

       urlLink This  is a good quotes site.  Haven't had any non-candid quote goodness in a while.  NCQG:  "A man can no more diminish God's glory by refusing to worship him than a lunatic can put out the sun by writing the word  darkness  on the walls of his cell." -C.S. Lewis  When U.S. interrogators asked Saddam Hussein how he was, he responded: "I am sad because my people are in bondage." When offered a glass of water, he replied: "If I drink water I will have to go to the bathroom and how can I use the bathroom when my people are in bondage?"   "My vision is to make the most diverse state on earth, and we have people from every planet on the earth in this state. We have the sons and daughters of every, of people from every planet, of every country on earth." —Former California Gov. Gray Davis, during the recall campaign

      Winter Retreat 2004 Weirdness:  Mark: If you have an emergency, dial 222, it's like dialing 911 only easier to remember. And if you have toilet-slash-plumbing issues or a stalker outside that you want to like, go away, dial 0 and tell the operator. Yes, they really told us to let you know what to do if a strange man was outside your door. Kris: Mark and I don't count as strange men, either. Hilary: How does a strange man outside your door not constitute as an emergency? Mark: Uh... he's not breaking in, he's just standing there.  "We have a 6 month year old daughter who was born... approximately six months ago." -James Grout, speaker  (the projector isn't working properly) James: So... what's going on with the projector?

"It's one of the rules of being from Canada. You have to listen to the band Rush, drink or at least know about beer, and eat bacon. If you can do that you're a Canadian." -James  "I was asking a man named Jesus that I couldn't even see into my heart. I had seen pictures of him, he had a really nice beard and... blue eyes, oddly enough for a Jewish man..." -James  Matt: Who made this big mess in the hall? You? Sarah: No, it's such a mess because the guys came and screwed it all up. Matt: Pshh... always blame it on the guys. Sarah: Well it's true. Matt: Yeah probably.  "Austin is a sexy beast!" -Sara, screaming at Austin when we were on the swings and he was walking back to the lodge  "My name's Audra and I have a really cool little sister named Ashley who never copied me in anything, ever, and I looked up to her even though she was younger and shorter than me. So let's fast forward a couple years to when I was dating this boy named Kris Pagard... he was the only boy I could find who would laugh at my dad's jokes." -Ashley telling her sister Audra's "life story"  "Avoid crime as a career." -James to Mark when he found Mark's sweatshirt in his room after Mark was trying to play a prank on him  "I really wanted a melon baller, you know, one of those things where you can make perfectly round little balls of melon. Can life get better? I submit that it cannot." -James  "If it's in here... it's the truth." -James reading out of the tabloid Weekly World News  "My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard... and don't you forget it." -Austin  (Sara and Sarah are praying in the hallway during devos and Matt and Jason walk through) Matt: Sorry. (steps between us) Sara: Geez... (sarcastically) Matt: Sorry! I'm sorry! Sara: I'm so disappointed. Jason: (points at previously unseen box of cupcakes he's holding) I know, I should have more.  "Like a rock... nothing ever got to me... like a rock... ohhh Matt's like a rock!" -Matt  Ashley: (ending her prayer) Talk to you later! Bye! Matt: How's he leaving? "See you later, God!"

      "My dream is for me to be a poet who could make things like this sky come to life for someone else.  If you see a sunset and try and describe it to someone in normal words, all you can say is, 'Boy, I saw a great sunset last night.'  But if you are a poet, you give it to someone to feel for themselves.  Like you make a little seed of what you saw, they swallow it, and it blooms again inside their own heart."-Elizabeth Berg  "Katryna had an epiphany this fall.  While driving through post peak Massachusetts on her daily route, she noticed a hillside, all brown and gold, autumn's faded palette.  And she realized with surprise that she actually preferred what we call 'post peak' to the traditional 'actual peak.'  See, 'actual peak' involves a whole spectrum of anxiety: 'is it peak yet? is it now?  Wait, I think I still see some green over there, so it can't be peak, but look, that maple is balding fast, and maybe I missed it after all!'  Once we're in post peak, the fall proceeds in a stately, gradual manner, and by the time the last leaf has fallen, we are serenely resigned to the state of affairs.  It's a nice time.  We miss out on the leaf gazing, mountain climbing frenzy and trade that in for crackling fires and the anticipation of snow days."-Nerissa Nields  "I collect and wear Mickey Mouse watches. This past fall, I boarded the train to New York at Metropark, in Woodbridge, N.J.  At one of the stops, a boy about 5 entered the train with his mother.  As the train was crowded, they sat next to me, the boy on his mother's lap.  He noticed my watch, and looked up at my face. He repeatedly glanced at the watch, then at me, as though working out a difficult problem.  Finally, with a very puzzled expression on his small face, he tapped me on the arm and said, 'Excuse me, but are you a grown-up?'"-Lollie W. Margolin, "Metropolitan Diary",  The New York Times   "A poem begins in delight and ends in wisdom."-Robert Frost

      More from Magnetic Liv  Then I fight L on the way to school. I'm so fed up of being told I need a boyfriend. So sick of it. She says, why can’t you just be happy for me? She makes me want to push the pretty girl we walk past against a wall and…prove a point.   Jack has drawn a lightening bolt down the forehead of Buffy on my Buffy mouse mat to "make her look more like Harry Potter". I do not have the words.  Darling, with beautiful shoulders, talks about love and people with lips that I can’t stop watching. ...the nights where I walk back to the cab station crying because it’s not me kissing him, those aren’t the good nights.  I guess it’s pretty late but I'm not really sure. I have this vague idea that I should be asleep not doing whatever it is I'm doing. That annoys me, I think. I seem perfectly capable of doing nothing of importance for hours on end and then I'm still surprised to find that I’ve lost whole sections of day to lazy things and daydreams.  I'm trying really hard to see the funny side of being an idiot. LET THERE BE A FUNNY SIDE, please.  I'm going to think of happy things and then everything is going to be ok again. -short musical interlude-  A lot of people are annoying me. I'm becoming quite obsessive about it. I can’t even look at them without all my muscles tightening in frustration. I should stop telling other people how annoying they are too. Although really, this is quite a hard thing to do. MY ANNOYANCE IS ALL CONSUMING. Once I was Liv. Now I'm Annoyed. It makes me more annoying than the people annoying me. And that’s just wrong and is completely unjustifiable in the grand scheme of things. Why, I'm surprised that the balance of the universe hasn’t been severely disrupted.  I want to go back to where I was in September. I think my day would be nicer if it were September again. I liked September. I liked it more than I liked November. If I were back in September I’d be having a really nice day, I'm sure.  I went to church for the third week running. Soon I will become a nun and I will sing in the hills and maybe I’ll find some nice children and I’ll make them wear curtains.   Liv: Hey C: Lo Liv: How are you? C: good Liv: cool Liv: have you had a good day? C: blah blah blah blah Liv: aww poor you/oh/cool/oh cool/right .... Liv: well I’ll be going then C: Laters Liv: xx  Today we interacted! Gee wiz! It was like October again.   I fully intend on marrying three times before I'm 30. Gemma says this is morally objectionable. I say her face is morally objectionable. We agree to disagree.  Note: the only reason I like that one is because it reminds me eerily of the strange conversations I routinely have with Miss Erin.   I'm not in love and/or sleeping. This is not an example of denial.

      I bought a new coat accidentally. My hand slipped holding a credit card and one thing led to another and now I have a new coat.  -Magnetic Liv  Dan wants to play the "ask me any question" game except we're grown-ups now so it's  Liv, I don't know anything about you, do you think you know me? I feel like I don't know you, Liv.  And in the end it's still "ask me any question". I tell him that he should tell me what it is he wants to tell me because I've learnt from experience people never ask the right questions. -Magnetic Liv

      "It wasn't so long ago that you were mired in that old stagnant life of sin. You let the world, which doesn't know the first thing about living, tell you how to live. You filled your lungs with polluted unbelief, and then exhaled disobedience. We all did it, all of us doing what we felt like doing, when we felt like doing it, all of us in the same boat. It's a wonder God didn't lose his temper and do away with the whole lot of us. Instead, immense in mercy and with an incredible love, he embraced us. He took our sin-dead lives and made us alive in Christ. He did all this on his own, with no help from us! Then he picked us up and set us down in highest heaven in company with Jesus, our Messiah. Now God has us where he wants us, with all the time in this world and the next to shower grace and kindness upon us in Christ Jesus. Saving is all his idea, and all his work. All we do is trust him enough to let him do it. It's God's gift from start to finish! We don't play the major role. If we did, we'd probably go around bragging that we'd done the whole thing! No, we neither make nor save ourselves. God does both the making and saving. He creates each of us by Christ Jesus to join him in the work he does, the good work he has gotten ready for us to do, work we had better be doing." Ephesians 2:1-10

       Summer unfolded like a tapestry, And you were there as you have always been.  There glowing where the sky meets with the trees, Air softly crowing, singing fears to sleep.  Will you ever know how much I love you for that? Will you ever know how much I love you?  -Mineral, "Love Letter Typewriter"

      "I wish you could put your ear up to my heart and hear how much I love you."  -Mineral, "Unfinished"  "And the snow falls down  Melts before it even hits the ground  I'm standing here listening to the sound of your hand washing back and forth across my filthy heart  I don't know if I should say "I'm sorry" or "thank you"  I try to speak, but the tears choke the words  I think I finally know what they mean when they talk about joy. -Mineral, "February"  I walked along beside the purple mountains beneath the orange sky Imagined what it all might look like with these planks out of my eyes I wondered if the big white horse was coming down tonight I wanted to taste that victory but my mouth was dry There is only tonight and the light that bleeds from your heart Makes me want to try and start again. -Mineral, "Five, Eight, and Ten"  "A brave morning Thoughts flap their wings and fly And I can still taste Defeat on my lips  Bright tie, fish fly I have not yet arrived How can I not admit I need to know you  Cause I just want to be Something more than the mud in your eyes I want to be the clay in your hands  Hey sorrow where are you Tomorrow just won't be the same Without you here I'll wish for shoulders bold and broad to bear And strength to hold my head above them  Cause I just want to be Something more than the mud in your eyes I want to be the clay in your hands  Cause Gloria is silent And glory is a silent thing." -Mineral, "Gloria"  "I wouldn't mind if you took me in my sleep tonight I wouldn't even put up a fight I wouldn't care if you took it all away today I'm sure I wouldn't even miss the pain  But I know I've got to live my life And roll around on the ground and feel the strife And realize along the way that I'm nothing more Than a grain of salt in the salt of the earth And everything is grace   So come on with the darkness Come on with the fear Cause I've got to start somewhere And it might as well be here   When I'm finally naked and standing in the sunlight I'll look back at all of this selfishness and foolish pride And laugh at myself." -Mineral, "Parking Lot"  "And happiness is just a dream or so it seems It's something that I can never see And I just want to lay my head in your arms And bleed awhile  Sunshine go away I don't want to play Come back again some other day When I've got something beautiful to say And stay awhile" -Mineral, "Silver"  "Time doesn't always heal It just breathes and swallows memories  Like the seasons change Sending showers beating flowers Into the mud  Helpless we are crying out But we will love someday and how..." -Mineral, "Sounds Like Sunday"  "There are blue skies in my dreams And laughter that seems unending There are green grass fields there And happiness and hope for tomorrow  My cup is full and my heart Spills awkward and embarrasing blood Onto white golden streets And I am unashamed of the stains my steps leave  Tears stream down my cheeks Only to meet their redeemer and be wiped away And there is joy" -Mineral, "Take the Picture Now"

      SHAT-LESSONS  SPEAK JUST LIKE SHATNER!   Lesson 1 - First lesson is the "over-dramatic random pause insertion technique."  Simply insert long overdrawn pauses into your speech - this will treble the impact of whatever you are saying.    Lesson 2 - "Word-stretching". Repeat the following phrases 3 times, whilst shaking your fist in the air. Remember to grimace…   "SSSSSSSSSSSSSSS-pock"  "UUUUUUUUUUUUU-HUra"  "KHAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-n"   Lesson 3 - Combine what you have learnt from both exercises.  Repeat the following phrase, converting it to Shat-Speak using the above techniques.   "Spock, please contact Lieutenant Uhura, and inform her to hail Khan's ship."   Note: If you've learnt these techniques correctly, it should take you approximately 2 minutes to complete that sentence.

      Weirdness:  Austin: So what are we going to watch? We have... (starts reading them off) Robin Hood: Prince of Theives -  Sarah: Oh that is the best movie ever. Austin: It's so funny and corny and cheesy. Sarah: No it's not! Austin: You probably only like it because Kevin Costner gets naked in it.  "Wow, I think that would seriously impair your ability to do stuff." -Austin when Robin Hood shot Will Scarlett in the hand with a bow and arrow  (when Robin says "what do we need that the forest cannot provide?") Austin: Oh yes, how would they be building houses? Sarah: They could cut down the trees. Austin: Right, kill the trees. Sarah: Yes, this was the start of deforestation.  (at some point during the movie) Austin: Look, it's a latrine. Sara: Do you even know what a latrine is? Austin: Yes, I'm in boy scouts.

      Okay something really strange just happened. I clicked on the link to view my blog, and it went to it, only none of the stuff there was anything I put there, it was all this gross porn stuff that was posted by someone named Cory Truesdale. Then I clicked refresh, and all my stuff was back. So just a warning, if that ever shows up when you click on it, just know that I had nothing to do with it, and clicking refresh usually will fix it for you. I'm really sorry if that has happened to anybody so far! I didn't even realize it.

      Weirdness:  "They were talking about premies and then they were talking about dogs, but I didn't realize they had changed topics so it really freaked me out when they were like 'then we had it at home, and it was vomiting and peeing in its kennel.'" -Alex overhearing some teachers before Prayer Club  "Did you see that girl who was like yelling to herself in the hallway? She was like 'I'm gonna get you! I'm gonna get you!' I'm like... I don't see a phone or anything attatched to your head so I'm kind of scared." -Jared  "Some say that it's free Can you see?

      Weirdness:  "If you eat too much sushi, do maggots grow in your brain?" -Nate the amazingly brilliant  "In my 6th period, there was a separation of church and state debate, and by the end of the class, it was... here's Blake, here's the rest of the class, here's the class eating Blake's head off." -Blake during prayer club  (Oz is talking during notes) Ms. Overton: Will you read the first haiku, Oz? Oz: (reading) What I thought to be, flowers soaring on the... (pause) bots -  Jacob: It's bough. Oz: I don't know, that's why I don't read.  "40 dollars, 40 dollars. If I take this will I get 40 dollars? Yippee skippee. I'm confused. SPAIN? You took out EIGHTY DOLLARS? Here, write a check. Well what is this. You have to use this otherwise it'll expire. You're right. Write. Write. You can do it! (something unintelligible) Yes but then you'll only have 78 cents. Yes you do care about a duck. Unintelligible? It's illegible. (Sarah explains that illegible is when you can't read it, not when you can't hear it.) Oh. I'm going to tell your mom. Okay. (Takes ring off her finger.) Sarah... I have something to ask you. Melanie... I have something to ask you. Involving you and a ring. You can't wear that on your left hand. No you can't. Who are you marrying? (rambles about Sarah not being able to write down what she's saying because she couldn't remember it all.) That's cheating and you know it. It has a really big loop. I'll be the shoelace. That's gonna sound really weird. That was so close that time. I had it in my hand. Viper? That would be me. You have the catlike reflexes. I am the viper. I GOT IT! I triumphed the cookie. The cranberry salad. Don't touch me. Uhhh... uh. You are weird. WHY ARE YOU WRITING IT! STOOOOOOOOOOOOP!" -Erin during Orchestra (just what she said, mostly. I don't write down what other people say, it's more entertaining this way.)  I have a lot of these little Erin rants lying around, maybe I'll type up some of the more entertaining ones later if I can find them.

      Favorite excerpts from songs by The Smiths:  had to sneak in to my room just to read my diary it was just to see just to see all the things you knew i've written about you... ~ Fifteen minutes with you Oh, no, I wouldn't say no Oh, people see no worth in you I do. ~ No more apologies I'm too tired I'm so sick and tired And I'm feeling very sick and ill today But I'm still fond of you. ~ Call me morbid, call me pale I've spent too long on your trail Far too long Chasing your tail And if you have five seconds to spare Then I'll tell you the story of my life Sixteen, clumsy and shy That's the story of my life ~ Every day you must say So, how do I feel about my life ? Anything is hard to find When you will not open your eyes When will you accept yourself ? I am sick and I am dull And I am plain How dearly I'd love to get carried away But dreams have a knack of just not coming true...

The largest city is Minneapolis, nicknamed, ‘St. Paul.’" -- Dave Barry   "I'd do it differently if I had another chance. I'd make a positive and sustained attempt to use judicious praise rather than find fault, to warmly accept rather than critique.

      Why is it everything's all loneliness with me? I guess sometimes I try too hard, and sometimes you cause it, but it always carries on and on. "What did you ever become?" you asked. I said, "I was told to be smiles and bright eyed happiness, but sometimes I can't find anything to laugh at." "I don't want to be here." you said. It seems like I almost always have that effect on everyone. I say to myself, "You aren't the first one to think like me." And I just want to be like everyone else. Why can't I be everything to everyone else, or maybe just to you? Just once I would like to be something. And I wouldn't mind if you'd like to be with me. -Saves the Day, "When It Isn't Like It Should Be..."  Don't leave yet  it's still early and I haven't even said a word  and I'm hoping that I might upset you by saying what I want to  Cause it's not like you don't know I've fallen for you  but it's in my head and that's where you can't see it  and I thought that maybe if I had to bite the tips of my fingers  I could stumble over words  and tell you just how far before I hit the ground  -Saves the Day, "The Choke"  Can't you look at me once? And please if you got a minute, enjoy this lonely sky with me. It'll swallow us whole if we only let it. -Saves the Day, "Sell My Old Clothes, I'm Off to Heaven"  When do I get to wake up to you? Today I can't forget that I've got these open wounds It's such a drag I can't forget you've gone My ribs have parted ways They said, "We're not going to protect this heart you have..." You've left me here in the cold And I miss you You never told me it would be this hard. -Saves the Day, "You Vandal"

       I've heard it said that a man would climb a mountain Just to be with the one he loves How many times has he broken that promise It has never been done. I've never climbed the highest mountain But I walked the hill of calvary  Just to be with you, I'd do anything There's no price I would not pay Just to be with you, I'd give everything I would give my life away.  I've heard it said that a man would swim the ocean Just to be with the one he loves But all of those dreams are an empty emotion It can never be done I've never swam the deepest ocean But I walked upon the raging sea  I know that you don't understand the fullness of My love How I died upon the cross for your sins And I know that you don't realize how much that I gave you But I promise, I would do it all again.  Just to be with you, I've done everything There's no price I did not pay Just to be with you, I gave everything Yes, I gave my life away.  -Third Day, "Love Song"

And in the end they kill it by electrocution! ... but that bit doesn't really apply here. Steve: Right, anyway. I've got the phone in my hand, and I'm saying nothing. Jeff: Right. Steve: Nothing!

      This is why a certain Mr. Todd Bertuzzi needs to be thrown in jail:  STEVE MOORE SUFFERS CONCUSSION, LACERATIONS, AND NECK FRACTURE   DENVER, Colo. – The Colorado Avalanche Hockey Club and its team doctors, along with the local neurosurgeons in Vancouver, British Columbia, is releasing the following report regarding the condition of Steve Moore.   “Steve Moore will remain hospitalized in Vancouver for an indefinite period of time,” said Avalanche Head Athletic Trainer Pat Karns. “Exams have revealed that Steve sustained a concussion and a cervical injury (neck fracture) and will be out at least for the remainder of the season. He also suffered deep facial lacerations and abrasions to the forehead, right cheek and upper lip. As soon as his condition permits him to travel, he will be transferred to Craig Hospital in Denver, where some of the best neurosurgeons in the country will reevaluate his condition in further detail. Steve regained consciousness before leaving the arena last night.”   Said Colorado Avalanche President and General Manager Pierre Lacroix: “Steve knows he has the support of the entire Avalanche family and hockey fans throughout the world, and we hope that he recovers as soon as possible.”  -AVS-  Stevie will be in my prayers for a long time.

      "See Christ on the cross? That's a gosspier hanging there. See Jesus? Embezzler. Liar. Bigot. See the crucified carpenter? He's a wife beater. Porn addict and murderer. See Bethlehem's boy? Call him by his other names - Adolf Hitler, Osama bin Laden, and Jeffrey Dahmer.   Hold it, Max. Don't you lump Christ with those evildoers. Don't you place his name in the same sentence with theirs!  I didn't.  He  did. Indeed he did more. More than place his name in the same sentence, he placed himself in their place. And yours.  With hands nailed open, he invited God, "Treat me as you would treat them!" And God did. In an act that broke the heart of the Father, yet honored the holiness of heaven, sin-purging judgement flowed over the sinless Son of the ages.   And heaven gave earth her finest gift. The Lamb of God who took away the sin of the world.  "My God, my God, why did you abandon me?" Why did Christ scream those words?  So you'll never have to."  -Max Lucado

      Yesterday, I watched a movie called Logan's Run. It was made in the 70s and is based off a book of the same name. Yes, I know it was only the 70s, but having been spoiled by computer generated image masterpieces like The Matrix, it is a little hard to take movies like Logan's Run seriously anymore. The whole plot could have turned into an interesting movie if it hadn't been so cheesed up. It's basically about this society that is hundreds of years in the future and no one is allowed to live past the age of 30. Everyone has these little jewel things in their hand that tells them what age they are and when it starts blinking red, that means you have to go to "carousel" where you get "renewed." Only what really happens is you get "killed." But no one gets this, because everyone is dumb. Everyone goes to carousel and WATCHES the people get "renewed." It's like fireworks, only instead of firecrackers, it's people. There are these guys called Sandmen that go around and "terminate" the people who try to run away from carousel. Because apparently, having anyone who is older than 30 is a very bad thing. Logan is a sandman who runs because the computer told him to and he of course meets this girl named Jessica and they fall in love and get "married," only it's not really married because all they said was "Beloved husband. Beloved wife." They had just learned these words by looking at really old gravestones and they were like "so, that means they stayed together for their whole lives? I think I'd like that." They met this old man outside of their little protected, no one is old domed city that told them about what people are like when they actually live past thirty and don't get "renewed." If you for some reason thought that anyone had an annoying voice, rent this movie and compare it to the old man's and then decide who is more annoying, because I think it will be the old man.   Favorite quote from this weird movie: "Let's take our clothes off before they freeze on us!" -Logan  The best part of this movie was the cats. The only reason was because my cat started freaking out at all the meowing and sat and watched the movie with me for like five minutes before he got bored and left.

      Tonight, Austin and I went to Chik-fil-a.  (after I said something he said made no sense even when he tried to rationalize it) Austin: I just think on a very high level. You don't think on the same level as me. Only poets, scientists, and... writers of all kinds... think on the same level as me. Sarah: So, I'm actually a writer. I write in a journal. All the time. (pause) Austin: That's not really a journal. Sarah: You're right. It's actually the list of people I'm going to kill.  "I'm so mean... why are you still friends with me? You need to work on not being friends with me." -Austin  (I don't remember what started this conversation) Sarah: Why are you so mean to me all the time? Austin: I'm not mean, you're mean. Sarah: I'm not mean to you. Austin: You're the one who called me an immature little elementary kid. Sarah: Well you were acting like one! Austin: So am I immature, or are you just really mean? Sarah: It's both. It comes and goes.  Austin: No, I think my immaturity comes and goes, and your meanness is just there all the time.  Austin: This is stupid. So the spicy wrap is just a regular wrap with spicy sauce.  Sarah: Well if you're used to eating Chipotle and Qdoba all the time then yeah it's not going to be spicy. Austin: This is the Americanized version of it. Sarah: I don't think that will keep you from eating it. Austin: Are you kidding, I'm a Mueller, I eat everything.  That just made me think of this other one from the spring retreat: "Don't make fun of me and say I made this huge mess just because I have the Mueller gene that means I do not have the ability to be clean when I eat." -Austin

             This is so true, I found out firsthand when Erin made me watch her stupid hamster in the sixth or seventh grade for a whole entire week when her family went on vacation. That hamster is the only pet that she has had that died of old age. It was named Gizmo, or something. It was almost murdered several times when it was staying at my house. After Gizmo unfortunately died at the ripe old age of 2, she got this other hamster that was named Teddy, or something, that died after like a week. Then she got another one that I don't think stayed around longer than a couple of days because it was messed up and attacked people. Then she decided to forgo the whole hamster experience because they either died or freaked out and got a lizard. It was named... um... I can't remember, but I'm sure it was clever. This lizard was supposed to eat crickets, but then it wasn't hungry for a couple of days so she put like all of the crickets into the lizard tank thing and left it. Then she came home from school one day, or woke up one morning, one of the two, and went over to say hi to her little lizard, but it was basically a dried up piece of skin. What we think happened was, the crickets attacked it and ate its eyes out and then sucked it dry. Which to me, was very funny, but she was sad for some reason. Now she has a hermit crab which as far as I know is still alive. His name is James, affectionately named after this kid who we for some unknown reason (even to us) called Hermit all the time in the sixth grade.

      Tonight I went to youth group. I like to write, so naturally I carry my journal around with me. And you would think that people - okay, boys - would have gotten over the near-irrisistable urge to steal girls' journals and run off with them. But apparently, I was mistaken. This is far too much to expect from 16 year old boys. I won't name any names but SOMEONE (Austin) decided it would be hilarious to attack me, tickle me, and then run away with my journal to the one place I am not allowed to go, which is, of course, the boys bathroom, which is where he "hid" that one time when he stole my cell phone and started calling people with it. I stood there holding the door open so I could see what was going on while whining at him to give it back, and he opens it up, looks down at it, and says "I love the boys in Hanson" as if he were reading something I wrote. Why was this was the first thing that came into his head? I have no idea, because that is NOT what I wrote. Fortunately, I was able to get it back before any considerable damage was done to my psyche. I grabbed it away from him and he's like "well duh Sarah, I wouldn't have read it." I said, "oh, so I can trust you with it?" "Yes, you can trust me to steal it and give it back without reading it." Okay, WHAT IS THE POINT IN STEALING IT IF YOU ARE NOT GOING TO READ IT? Unless you're acting like an elementary school student, where the boys steal the girls' things because they have secret crushes. It's sort of cute when you're in the third grade but when you are a sophomore in high school, the whole "tee hee! let's steal Sarah's crap and run into the boys bathroom because it will be funny" thing should have lost it's appeal.....  But maybe that's just me.    In other news, there was a huge bee stuck in the light in my bathroom. It's one of those light bulbs with the cover on it so when it is turned on, it casts a sort of glow over the bathroom and makes it seem like you are in a cheap motel. Somehow, a bee got into the covering. And for those of you who are unaware, I am terrified of bees, mainly because when they fly around, they always manage to fly at my head with a look on their face that says "I am going to sting you in the eye, and you will like it." I didn't know it was a bee until I forced my dad to come down and look at it (it's in the basement). I thought it was a fly at first... I went down there to brush my teeth and I heard this weird "Bzzzmmmmzzzeeee" noise accompanied by the noise moths make when they run into the glass doors that are right next to your porch light. I thought it was the toilet before I noticed that it was actually a bug, which isn't as strange as it sounds because the toilets that are in our house are conspiring against all of us, but then I noticed this big black thing flying around in the light covering, which is above the toilet. When I noticed it, I thought "wow, that is one big fly" but then I thought that the wings were too big, so it must be a moth. Moths are sort of freaky anyway, because they fly around desperately, saying "Help me! I don't know what to do with myself, I shouldn't be alive." (By the way, I was at Elizabeth's house a while ago and somehow a moth got into her kitchen and I was really scared that it was going to fly into my glass of milk, so I put a napkin over the top of it. I just hate moths.) Anyway, I went upstairs and said to my dad "there is a huge bug stuck in the light in the basement." If you thought I was going to take care of it myself, you were wrong. (Note to anyone thinking about becoming my future husband: you better not be afraid of bugs, especially not of bees, spiders, and moths, because if one gets in the house YOU are going to be the one that kills it.) My dad came down and, upon inspection, announced "that is a really big bee." Upon which I announced "I am getting out of here."   It's dead now. My dad took the covering off the light, swatted it with a newspaper, and grabbed it with a kleenex and flushed it down the toilet before it could recover. Or so I heard. Is it just me, or is there a large amount of satisfaction to be found in the knowledge that that bee drowned in a toilet?

      Copeland lyrics:  She says that I am the brightest little firefly in her jar. -"Brightest"  Sleep now sweet princess I'll cheer for you silently and carefully not to disturb. I'll be ready on that evening when you're starved for my attention you'll say, "wake now, prince; there's a brilliant sky above and a jealous moon in love and they are starved for our attention." -"When Paula Speaks"  You've got an extra special heart and a perfect light that shines through. But it seems like the hardest part is shining back at you. So forgive me if I don't know what to do when you look at me. There can be no hesitation; there cannot be a close second to you. I've got a perfectly normal heart, bruised and broken from within. At times I don't know how to start to let you in here. -"There Cannot Be a Close Second"  There's a love that transcends all that we've known of ourselves and I'll wait for it to come. It's got to be strong to touch my heart through it's shell and I'll wait for it to come. -"Coffee"

      God's silence is more than man's speech. God's negative is better than the world's affirmative. Have thy prayers been followed by a calm stillness? Well! Is not that God's voice - a voice that will suffice thee in the meantime till the full disclosure comes? Has He moved not from His place to help thee? Well, but His stillness makes thee still, and He has something better than help to give thee.  -George Matheson   This so-called tolerance, which, in my opinion, is nothing but a huge indifference.  -Alexis de Tocqueville   Humanism was not invented by man, but by a snake who suggested that the quest for autonomy might be a good idea.  -R. C. Sproul   Death is not extinguishing the light from the Christian; it is putting out the lamp because the dawn has come.  There is no pit of hell so deep that God's love is not deeper still. -Corrie Ten Boom  No myth is filled with such life. -Albert Einstein on Jesus Christ   When Jesus died on the cross, He was giving "all He had" to pay the price for all the wrong things you've ever done. In your heart, for just a moment, would you walk up that hill the Bible calls Skull Hill and stand quietly at the foot of that cross where the Son of God is pouring out His life for you. Look at Him dying for you! You are not worthless! But you'll never know how valuable you are until you give yourself to the One who died to buy you back. Which you could do right now, right where you are.  -Ron Hutchcraft    I have known many people that do things that they know are wrong. Then when someone that cares about them tries to talk to them about the problem, they get mad about it. Always remember this - When you do something that you know is wrong, you give up the right to get mad.  -Hugh Troyer   God loves us the way we are but He loves us too much to leave us that way.  -Leighton Ford

      The definition of "marriage" may well be on its way to being completely revolutionized, thanks to the efforts and actions of gays and lesbians around the country. In San Francisco, Mayor Gavin Newsom allowed gay marriages starting Feb. 12 until the California Supreme Court voted unanimously that they should stop a month later. Massachusetts is slated to allow same-sex marriages as of May 17 and several other states have domestic partner laws, reciprocal beneficiary laws and civil unions that grant the couples some legal rights.   But whether or not traditional marriage should be challenged is another matter entirely.  The position of conservatives on the issue of gay marriage is clear: it should not be legalized, because marriage should only be between a man and a woman. The underlying reason for this is the thinking that homosexuality in itself is wrong. Many people go around spouting this creed, but the reasons behind it aren't so commonly heard. Because of this, there are plenty of misconceptions floating around regarding this stance on gay marriage and homosexuality in general.  The majority of the conservative populace backs religious traditions as their reasons why gay marriages should remain illegal. The “religious right” is accused by gay activists of being vile, hateful bigots who ignore one of the basic fundamentals of Christianity: “Love your neighbor as yourself.” As it is a commandment, Christians are expected to follow it, and when Christians speak out against homosexuality and gay marriage, the gay community immediately reminds them of it. But there is a difference between loving someone and condoning their actions.   “Love the sinner, hate the sin.” It seems simple enough, doesn’t it? Sometimes it seems like all Christians do is confuse “hate the sin” with “hate the sinner.” There are some Christians who are misguided and a little forgetful when it comes to the topic of loving their neighbor, but just because many of those vocal on the conservative side of this issue give the impression that they hate the sinner because of the sin does not make it God’s truth. To find God’s truth, Christians should look to the Bible, and the Bible is very clear on the subject.  In Genesis 2:24, it says “Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they will become one flesh.” Clearly, this verse is not leaving any room for homosexual unions. It’s not only saying that man and woman were created to be united together. It’s saying that a man will leave his father and mother, not father and father, or mother and mother. This verse is where God declares that his idea of a family consists of a man and a woman. Anything else is not what he intended for his beloved creation.  In Romans 1: 26-27, the Apostle Paul writes “For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.” This verse is saying that homosexuality is not natural, or that they aren’t “born that way.” Reason being, early on (very early on… we’re talking, the Earth is only a week or so old) God said that man was created to be with a woman back in Genesis 2.   What is marriage for? Maggie Gallagher, President of the Institute for Marriage and Public Policy and a co-author of The Case for Marriage, wrote a column for The Weekly Standard in August of 2003. She writes that if family structure doesn’t matter, if a family can function on love alone regardless of the sexes of the parents, “Then what is marriage for? Why have laws about it? Why care whether people get married or stay married? Do children need mothers and fathers, or will any sort of family do? When the sexual desires of adults clash with the interests of children, which carries more weight, socially and legally?” She goes on to say that “marriage is a virtually universal human institution. In all the wildly rich and various cultures flung throughout the ecosphere, in society after society, whether tribal or complex, and however bizarre, human beings have created systems of publicly approved sexual union between men and women that entail well-defined responsibilities of mothers and fathers. Not all these marriage systems look like our own, which is rooted in a fusion of Greek, Roman, Jewish, and Christian culture. Yet everywhere, in isolated mountain valleys, parched deserts, jungle thickets, and broad plains, people have come up with some version of this thing called marriage.”   When God created humans, part of his plan was for them to make more humans (“As for you, be fruitful and increase in number; multiply on the earth and increase upon it” Gen. 9:7), and the only way to do this is through a male and female relationship. If homosexuality was truly natural, we would have discovered it long ago. There would be no need for a “sexual revolution.” The belief of Christian conservatives that is rarely given voice is that the “I’m born this way” argument is used  by the gay community to justify their actions. Every human who has ever lived save one was born with a sin nature, and that single person without one lived two thousand years ago and is the founder of the Christian faith, Jesus of Nazareth, who, according to the Bible, lived a perfect life. This built in sin nature is why many Christians confuse the concept of “hate the sin, love the sinner” with “hate the sinner because he sins.” This thinking is flawed – no one is perfect. Everyone sins. We’re born that way. But God’s truth is, we don’t have to stay that way.   ~  I wrote this for the ThunderRidge Newspaper. It was published last Friday.

      "When I was in third grade, my mom put me in summer school for a month. She said I needed to learn more about math. But the whole month we learned about Amelia Earhart. I told my parents about this and how we weren't learning any math yet and my mom was like 'oh you will!' and my dad said 'it'll all tie together in the end.' How does learning about a lady who flew a plane relate to math? 'Oh, what's two plus two? Amelia Earhart.'" -Brandy  "What do we have to do to get free cookies?

      Everything is holding its breath inside me. Everything is waiting to explode like Christmas. I want to be all new and shiny. I want to sit out bad at night, a boy around my neck and the wind under my skirt. Not this way, every evening talking to the trees, leaning out my window, imagining what I can't see. A boy held me once so hard, I swear, I felt the grip and weight of his arms, but it was a dream... how did you hold her? Was it? Like this? And when you kissed her?

      More of my favorite quotes from the past school year... probably all of them have been posted at least once:  (trying to decide what to do for seminar lunch) James: Let’s have Chipotle! Josh: (automatically) No. James:  Why  do you do this? Josh: Cause you said you wanted it. (later, still trying to decide) Ms. Ferguson: We could cook… James: Right. I’d like to see us cook a real meal instead of frying up a tortilla with cheese on it and saying “we’re making omelettes!”  Sarah: What’s your email address? Brandy: I don’t remember. Sarah: How can you not remember? Brandy: You have to have a brain to remember stuff.  Girl: Only six more hours until lunch. Alex: “Only” six more hours. Girl: Well I’m used to eating at 10:30 except when I have choir. Alex: I know. I have choir with you. So I “suffer” just as much.  “It’s not like it’s ‘oh, it’s Saturday night, no one goes out, I’ll see you in a minute.’” -Barbara while we were making homecoming plans  (at a DU basketball game, Kris and Mark are watching the band and making fun of them) Kris: Look, I can play the tuba. Mark: It's not a tuba, it's a sousaphone. (a few minutes later, Krystal and Whitney are checking out guys on the team and saying their numbers whenever they are on the court) Krystal: Hel-LOW, 43! Whitney: No, it's like "cel-LOW, 43!" Krystal: Cel-LOW, 43! Mark: It's not a cello, it's a sousaphone.  "I have candy, little girl!"  -Erin when she pulled over to offer me a ride home  (I know this one is in here like four hundred times but it makes me laugh every single time so it's going up again) "They were talking about premies and then they were talking about dogs, but I didn't realize they had changed topics so it really freaked me out when they were like 'then we had it at home, and it was vomiting and peeing in its kennel.'" -Alex overhearing some teachers before Prayer Club  (At Blockbuster) Austin: Is that Cate Blanchett? If it is, we’re getting it. Sarah: Why, do you think she’s hot or something? Austin: No, I think she’s a good actress, I’m not so shallow to just buy a movie because a girl in it is hot. (later) Sarah: (sarcastically) Oooh, how about this one? (picks up “Avril Lavigne: My World” DVD) Austin: Eww, no, she’s ugly.  "Hi, my name is Erin, and... my favorite color is clear... because it goes with everything!" -Ryan after Erin said something really stupid  "It's a little loud... I can't hear the person I'm trying to talk to." -Jake (right after a lecture the teacher gave us about paying attention to the movie and not talking)  "Oh yeah, I forgot I have to slow down here because there's a huge dip. It's really bad for your shock absorbers if you do that, I feel like I'm off-roading, only it's urban off-roading." -Alex when he was driving me home  "do you wanna see him? he's so cute. i said 'oh my gosh.' oh my gosh look at him! gee, i wonder. yes, he is. ahhhh look at him. die. jamie howie. oh my god! oh my god! look at him look at him (repeat like a million times) that is a hot picture. so she likes transvstites? marc, what was our idea? i know it was really good. i forget too. yeah, i thought we were going to do the countries thing. okay. oh and what was that historical figures thing. what was that about? okay.

Corey: Tahoe. If someone blows up the bathroom, all that's going to get broken is toilets.  Blake: (to Erin, backstage after he just did one of his solos in Carousel, which he is Billy Bigelow in) Did you hear my sour note? Erin: (thinking he just said "did you hear my song") Oh, yeah. Blake: What? Erin: Wait, what did you say? Blake: Did you hear my sour note? Erin: Oh, I'm sure it wasn't that bad.  Blake: I really wish I could have hit that sour note better. Little kid who plays Mr. Snow's son: Oh I heard your song! Which of the sour notes was it?  "This is the ice tea story. Once upon a time, there was a guy who was thirsty, so he got some water and mixed it with some high fructose corn syrup..." -Erin reading the Nestea Ice Tea ingredients to us at lunch  (after I said something he said made no sense even when he tried to rationalize it) Austin: I just think on a very high level. You don't think on the same level as me. Only poets, scientists, and... writers of all kinds... think on the same level as me. Sarah: So, I'm actually a writer. I write in a journal. All the time. (pause) Austin: That's not really a journal. Sarah: You're right. It's actually the list of people I'm going to kill.  (while playing SceneIt!, according to Mark, his team is Team Awesome and Sara Bibb's team is Team Horrible) Sara B.: What team are you on? Sarah: I'm... on whichever team is winning.  Sara B.: You're on our team. Mark: No she's not, she's on Team Awesome.  Sara B.: No, she's on Team Horrible! Kyle: (to me) She just called you horrible.  Melanie: Smith! What should I write in my bio for the play program?  Smith: Say you come from a long line of homo sapiens. Person standing next to Melanie: I thought your parents were married!

Somewhere, up above the clouds, it still shines and warms and pulls at the life buried deep inside the brown branches and frozen earth. The sun is there! Spring will come! The clouds cannot stay forever." -Gloria Gaither  "God speaks to us through our desires, then as we lay them at His feet, He helps us sort them out and quiets our hearts to accept what He has already prepared." -Rosalind Rinker  "Lift up your eyes. The heavenly Father waits to bless you - in inconceivable ways to make your life what you never dreamed it could be." -Anne Ortlund  "God brings men into deep waters, not to drown them, but to cleanse them." -John H.

      My parents are leaving for an overnight trip to a bed and breakfast place for their 18th wedding anniversary, and my mom apparently thinks I am unable to handle this, because she keeps leaving notes like "don't forget to bring the milk in tomorrow morning, and don't accidentally let the cat out while you're doing it!" She also turned the front lights on, even though it's the middle of the day, and my dad asked her about this, why are the lights on, it's the middle of the day, and she said "I know, it's fine, they can stay on" and I said, "do you think we can't flip a switch when it gets dark outside...?" It's the first time my parents have left us alone overnight but really, how is it different from them leaving my sister and me alone any other time.   My mom also went to the store (to stock up on food for the pending apocalypse that is sure to come about, due to our being left home alone overnight) and she bought MORE cat toys (we do NOT have enough already) and one of them is a little football that is blue and yellow and squeaks when you squeeze it. It looks and sounds more like a dog toy than a cat toy. My cat is evidently terrified of the noise it makes, and this fills my sister with much glee, as she is currently chasing him around the house squeaking it at him. It's sort of entertaining to see his tail get all poofy, like it always does when he's freaked out or intimidated by something, but after a while I sort of feel sorry for him, and if he's hiding under the bed you can't see him flipping out anyway so what is the point.

It's just enough to see a shooting star To know you're never really far...

It's from this song:  Twenty four oceans Twenty four skies Twenty four failures Twenty four tries Twenty four finds me In twenty-fourth place Twenty four drop outs At the end of the day Life is not what I thought it was Twenty four hours ago  Still I'm singing Spirit take me up in arms with You And I'm not who I thought I was twenty four hours ago Still I'm singing Spirit take me up in arms with You  Twenty four reasons to admit that I'm wrong With all my excuses still twenty four strong  See I'm not copping out not copping out not copping out When You're raising the dead in me Oh, oh I am the second man Oh, oh I am the second man now Oh, oh I am the second man now  And You're raising these twenty four voices With twenty four hearts With all of my symphonies  In twenty four parts But I wan to be one today Centered and true  I'm singing Spirit take me up in arms with You You're raising the dead in me Oh, oh I am the second man Oh, oh I am the second man now Oh, oh I am the second man now And You're raising the dead in me  I want to see miracles, see the world change Wrestled the angel, for more than a name For more than a feeling For more than a cause I'm singing Spirit take me up in arms with You And You're raising the dead in me Twenty four voices With twenty four hearts With all of my symphonies  In twenty four parts. I'm not copping out. Not copping out. Not copping out. -Switchfoot, "24"

      Classics from Sophomore Year (according to me, at least, and this  is  my blog)  (arguing about who invented the Pythagorean Theorem in math) Lucas: Ms. Maas says that the Babylonians made it, but it was Pythagoras, who was Greek.  Nate: It says in the history book that it was Pythagoras.  Ms. Maas: I know what it says, and it's wrong. Rachelle: Well today in history we learned that it was actually the ancient Indians who made it. Jake: Well, my mom says that SHE invented the Pythagorean Theorem...  "They were talking about premies and then they were talking about dogs, but I didn't realize they had changed topics so it really freaked me out when they were like 'then we had it at home, and it was vomiting and peeing in its kennel.'" -Alex overhearing some teachers before Prayer Club  Austin: Your lifeline is really long.  Fharon: Really?  Austin: No. Gimme your hand. (looks at Fharon's palm) Well, this line means... you have a crease in your hand...   "Have you ever seen that movie where the guy says a word and then he goes, 'bla bla. To bla bla bla.' Yeah. It was really funny. It'd be even funnier if I could remember it." -Brandy  Tessa: You should have someone play the jingle bells. (pause) Mr. Snell: Jingle bells... jingle bells... jingle all the way... Tessa: No, like the actual jingle bells. Mr. Snell: They're called "sleigh bells." Jingle bells are the little tiny ones that go "jingle jingle." Tracy: The sleigh bells go "sleigh, sleigh."  Sarah: The hall pass lady's name is Mrs. Nelson. Melanie: Wow, she DOES have a name! And it's even somewhat normal, too. Erin: Yeah, but her first name is Galockchuck.  Erin: Do I look like Heidi? Sarah: I don't know who that is. Erin: You know, that girl that like runs through the hills. Sarah: Oh, and that lives in the Alps or whatever, with the braids. Malorie: Oh I know her, she goes to my church.  (Grading each other's papers in English) Ryan S.: Cursive is really hard to read. Micaela: Sorry, I have bad handwriting. Ryan S.: No, I just can't read it very well. Brandon: Yeah, it's even harder when you're trying to cheat on her on a stupid vocab quiz.  Erin: I’m LISTENING! Sarah: To what? Erin: Whatever you just said!  (at Chik-fil-a) Sarah: What’s that one sandwich that comes in a bag? Erin: That would be a number 1. Sarah: I want that. (pause) But the picture has yucky pickles. (long pause while Erin looks at me like I'm the biggest moron on the planet) Erin: Then tell them “no” on the yucky pickles.  (talking about a science project) Erin: Have you done the animal thing yet? Sarah: No. Erin: Me neither. Sarah: I’m doing ring-tailed lemurs… they’re so cute. Erin: I think they’re weird looking, their eyes are like huge. Sarah: They have ring tails. Erin: No, I thought they were called ring tailed lemurs because they had polka dotted heads.  (talking about the Grand Canyon) Dad: It’s about 25 or 30 degrees hotter at the bottom. Mom: Really? I thought it was cooler at the top.  Mr. Moon: What can you get from sheep? Ryan S.: Milk. Mr. Moon: Wool. Ryan S.: Okay… (a while later) Ryan S.: Can’t you get milk from sheeps?  I imagine that many of these are a lot more entertaining to me than they are to whoever may be reading this, but, well, I guess you'll just have to get over it. :p

      Dear God,  WHY DID YOU CREATE MOTHS!!!!!!! All they do is go in the house and fly at my head and then go in the halogen lamps and stink up the whole floor with the smell of burning insect flesh. Or people like my dad catch them and hold them in the kleenex while they are still alive and say "look, it's a moth" and laugh at me when I say, ew, that is gross, I don't want to see a writhing moth in a kleenex. Then he goes into the bathroom and throws it in the toilet and watch it flounder around in the water before flushing it and watching it drown. Okay speaking of why you made things, why do guys have to be so obsessed with watching bugs die?   Love,  Sarah

      "When we have done all we can, we must still wait for God to accomplish His purposes. As we wait, we can fix our eyes on Jesus as a companion who empathizes with our suffering and a Savior who is working behind the scenes. Difficult circumstances seem to increase our ability to experience intimacy with Christ."  -Ruthann Ridley   "At times, when we hear a word from God, we tend to use our own intellect to decipher what He wants, when actually what God wants is just simple obedience and faith in Him.... By all means, exercise the faith that moves mountains, but know that it is still God who moves the mountains."   "Before Jesus died, He willed us His Peace. But we forfeit His gift through strife. God's desire for us is that we live in peace with Him, with ourselves and with our fellowman. He wants us to have peace in the midst of our current circumstances--peace in the morning, at night and all times in between. Peace is our inheritance! And it is a wonderful possession." -Joyce Meyer   "Grace is not a license to sin, but to walk in humility in the sight of God. Grace frees us to be active in the works of God. We are not tied up with how much we have done, or not done, but we learn by the grace of God to rest in His love." -Curt McComis

      "Perfection does not consist in the knowledge of God's order, but in submission to it. The order of God, the good pleasure of God, the will of God, the action of God, grace -- all these are one and the same thing in this life. Perfection is nothing else than the faithful cooperation of the soul with the work of God. This ultimate purpose of our life grows and increases in our souls secretly and without our knowledge." -don't know  "God has not abdicated His throne. He will not forever tolerate man's inhumanity to man. He sees, He knows, He understands--and He still reigns. Whatever has happened this day, whatever happens tomorrow, He is still in control. Nothing escapes His watchful eye and He promises to hear the prayers of His children. Let us look to the Lord, Who IS our help and our refuge in the time of storm. And while we pray for those who sorrow, let us also pray for those who hate...may God save their never-dying souls."  -Peggie C. Bohanon

      (looking at Sara's support list) Sarah: Is that yours? Austin: Yes, I suddenly got like a billion dollars.  Connor: Okay, I seriously thought you died the other day, when I heard about the bridge falling down. Austin: Oh with the red durango? Connor: Yeah, I like freaked out when they said it was a father, mother and son...  Austin: Yes, that automatically means me. Connor: Well it could have been you, they didn't say who the people were when I was listening. Austin: They still haven't released the names. Connor: So it COULD be you! Austin: Yes. You caught me, I'm actually dead. Connor: (to me) PUT THAT ON YOUR BLOG! Sarah: Like I'm going to remember all of that. Connor: No, it's like "Austin: they haven't released the names" Austin: And then "Connor- Both: "-it COULD be you!" Connor: Now you'll remember it, because we re-enacted it for you.  Austin: She'll probably put the re-enacting part on it too.

      "We are prepared to serve the Lord only by sacrifice. We are fit for the work of God only when we have wept over it, prayed about it, and then we are enabled by Him to tackle the job that needs to be done. May God give to us hearts that bleed, eyes that are wide open to see, minds that are clear to interpret God's purposes, wills that are obedient, and a determination that is utterly unflinching as we set about the tasks He would have us do." -Alan Redpath   "If our greatest need had been information, God would have sent an educator. If our greatest need had been technology, God would have sent us a scientist. If our greatest need had been money, God would have sent us an economist. But since our greatest need was forgiveness, God sent us a Savior." -Roy Lessin  "The truth, even though I cannot feel it right now, is that I am the chosen child of God, precious in God's eyes, called the Beloved from all eternity and held safe in an everlasting embrace . . . We must dare to opt consciously for our chosenness and not allow our emotions, feelings, or passions to seduce us into self-rejection." -Henri J. M. Nouwen  "The first service one owes to others in the fellowship consists in listening to them. Just as love of God begins in listening to His Word, so the beginning of love for the brethren is learning to listen to them. It is God's love for us that He not only gives us His Word but lends us His ear. So it is His work that we do for our brother when we learn to listen to him." -Dietrich Bonhoeffer

      "What 'one thing', what person, what position, what passion immediately comes to mind when you hear this question? 'What one thing would you say to God.. Oh Lord, I will give you anything, I will do anything for you, I will go anywhere, I will give away anything... but that?' The answer to that question is the 'one thing' you need to give to the Lord, more than anything else. Often, when we surrender such a deep sense of ownership to the Lord, He in his loving grace will allow us to have that 'one thing' again, with the caution to remember we are only stewards of that 'one thing.' Oftentimes, He, in his wisdom, does not allow us to have that 'one thing' back. It is a step of submission and obedience; and a risk that is vitally important for the sake of our spiritual growth. God said, 'You shall have no other gods before me.' (Ex 20:3)"   -K Walden

      This is the 300th post on this blog. I had no idea I was up to that many, but I guess I'm not really all that surprised, what with the complete lack of things I have to do in my free time.  Okay, I have a few things to say. If you don't know me and/or are not going to Costa Rica or anywhere on a missions trip or haven't gone on any kind of missions trip in the past, this probably won't make sense to you, but it needs to be said, and I will most likely be reiterating it at the meeting that we ARE having at Connor's house at 4:30 on Thursday this week.  I really am just about done with this whole Costa Rica thing. Don't get me wrong, I am SO excited to go this summer, I am, and I'm really really really looking forward to it. I just really did not think that preparing a freaking MIME would turn out to be such a huge soap opera. We can't let any disagreements we for some reason may have about who is ORGANIZING WHEN WE ARE MEETING TO PRACTICE IT get in the way of WHY we're doing it and WHO we are doing it for. It's not about US. We need to stop taking out any last-few-days-of-school issues or family issues or ANY kind of issues that we may have out on each other. It's just going to get us more and more frustrated with each other and make working together on this mime and anything else regarding this missions trip even harder. How is it going to look if we show up in Costa Rica and we can't stand being around each other and the only reason we're doing anything is to get it done with? What's our verse, again? "My purpose is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love, so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding, in order that they may know the mystery of God, namely, Christ." Colossians 2:2. How is a bunch of people who are pissed at each other all the time going to encourage anybody in their hearts or unite anyone in love? We're supposed to set an example for them. We're supposed to be Christlike. And I personally don't think that Jesus would be making such a huge stink about when and where we're meeting to practice a simple mime that is meant to spread the Gospel. We have to work TOGETHER, and even if we meet a hundred times before we go, IT WILL NOT COME TOGETHER IF WE DO NOT COOPERATE WITH EACH OTHER.   That said, I want to apologize if I've bit anyone's head off in the last couple of days. I've been pretty stressed out about school and grades and friends have been getting mad at me left and right because I don't talk to them or I don't call them and when the whole thing with the mime hit I just couldn't take it anymore. That's not an excuse at all, of course, but now you know what's wrong with me.

      This new blogger is so weird. And too bad for everyone, I can't figure out the comment thing on this version. Maybe I'll work on that later because I really do not feel like doing it right now, and maybe it's good because now you can't whine at me about how pissed I am at everyone. Except for Some Kind of Hero, they are making me happy right now with how awesome their music is.

      WHY IS EVERYTHING/ONE RETARDED!!!!!!!!!!! I spend like a freaking day trying to make my new and supposed to be improved blog on greatestjournal and then suddenly, blogger says oh hey guess what, WE ARE CHANGING EVERYTHING. Fine, I'll just stay here because all my loser friends hate my other one. Blogger doesn't have boring templates anymore anyway so it's not like it matters where I go anymore. Happy?  Yeah, so it's been a REALLY SUCKY DAY. FYI: if you are on the Desicion Time mime, MAKE UP YOUR FREAKING MIND ABOUT WHEN WE ARE GOING TO MEET!!!!!! AND GUESS WHAT I AM NOT THE ONLY DIRECTOR, I DO NOT WANT TO DO EVERYTHING, I GET ENOUGH OF THAT KIND OF CRAP AT SCHOOL, THANKS THOUGH. Unfortunately I am too shy to scream at people in person so that is why the internet is such a great thing for me! Wheee! JKDBGIUYFRHJKO:RFNHKL:moitkhlmnfsgj38q49pion

      "One thing we may be sure of, however: For the believer all pain has meaning; all adversity is profitable. There is no question that adversity is difficult. It usually takes us by surprise and seems to strike where we are most vulnerable. To us it often appears completely senseless and irrational, but to God none of it is either senseless or irrational. He has a purpose in every pain He brings or allows in our lives. We can be sure that in some way He intends it for our profit and His glory." -Jerry Bridges   "I am His by purchase and I am His by conquest; I am His by donation and I am His by election; I am His by covenant and I am His by marriage; I am wholly His; I am peculiarly His; I am universally His; I am eternally His. Once I was a slave but now I am a son; once I was dead but now I am alive; once I was darkness but now I am light in the Lord; once I was a child of wrath, an heir of hell, but now I am an heir of heaven; once I was Satan's bond-servant but now I am God's freeman; once I was under the spirit of bondage but now I am under the Spirit of adoption that seals up to me the remission of my sins, the justification of my person and the salvation of my soul." -Thomas Brooks   "The implications of the name "Immanuel" are both comforting and unsettling. Comforting, because He has come to share the danger as well as the drudgery of our everyday lives. He desires to weep with us and to wipe away our tears. And what seems most bizarre, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, longs to share in and to be the source of the laughter and the joy we all too rarely know." -Michael Card   "The army of Israel looked at Goliath through the eyes of man and said he's too big to beat. David looked at him through the eyes of God and said he's too big to miss." -Wally Carter   "When God saw that many men were lazy, and gave themselves only with difficulty to spiritual reading, He wished to make it easy for them, and added the melody to the words, that all being rejoiced by the charm of the music, should sing hymns to Him with gladness." -John Chrysostom   "Never before has the world been so desperately asking for answers to crucial questions, and never before has the world been so frantically committed to the idea that no answers are possible." -Edmund Clowney   "It is as if God the Father is saying to us: 'Since I have told you everything in My Word, Who is My Son, I have no other words that can at present say anything or reveal anything to you beyond this. Fix your eyes on Him alone, for in Him I have told you all, revealed all, and in Him you will find more than you desire or ask. If you fix your eyes on Him, you will find everything, for He is My whole word and My reply, He is My whole vision and My whole revelation.'" -Anthony M. Coniaris   "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more important than food, and the body more important than clothes? Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they? Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life? And why do you worry about clothes? See how the lilies of the field grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these. If that is how God clothes the grass of the field, which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? So do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?' For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own."  -Jesus (Matt. 6:25-34)  I like the way The Message puts verses 30-36 of Matthew 6: "If God gives such attention to the appearance of wildflowers--most of which are never even seen--don't you think he'll attend to you, take pride in you, do his best for you? What I'm trying to do here is to get you to relax, to not be so preoccupied with getting, so you can respond to God's giving. People who don't know God and the way he works fuss over these things, but you know both God and how he works. Steep your life in God-reality, God-initiative, God-provisions. Don't worry about missing out. You'll find all your everyday human concerns will be met. Give your entire attention to what God is doing right now, and don't get worked up about what may or may not happen tomorrow. God will help you deal with whatever hard things come up when the time comes."  ~  Whoever you are, wherever you are, as you're reading this take a second to pray for any unsaved friends you have. In youth group we have that board of names of people we're praying for, but I think sometimes it is all too easy to write down a name and then forget to pray for them. I know I'm guilty of it, at least. So right now, let your heart break over the same thing that breaks God's heart - ask Him to draw the hearts of our unsaved friends to Him. Ask for them to have a desire to seek after Him, and ask Him to let His light shine through you. I know that I want to be Jesus to the world, and what better way to start than with your friends? I think that sometimes we forget that yeah, we're going to die someday, and not everyone is going to heaven. Just because our face to face meeting with Jesus seems far away doesn't mean that we can ever ever ever EVER give up praying for our friends who don't know Christ. It is so important to be steadfast in our prayers, because prayer does make a difference. You may never know what kind of an impact you're having. That also applies to sharing the Gospel and standing for what you believe every opportunity that you get... you never know who's listening, and you never know what kind of seeds you might be planting in the hearts and minds of those who are. Just... always, always remember: your prayers do NOT go unnoticed. Patience is everything - God's timing is not the same as ours. Wait on him, because he's not going anywhere.  Matthew 9:37-38 Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful but the workers are few. Ask the Lord of the harvest, therefore, to send out workers into his harvest field."   Matthew 21:22 "If you believe, you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer."   Romans 12:11-12 "Never be lacking in zeal, but keep your spiritual fervor, serving the Lord. Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, faithful in prayer."  Philippians 4:6 "Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God."  1 Thessalonians 5:16-18 "Be joyful always;  pray continually;  give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus."

      For everyone who sees me writing in a journal 24/7 (roughly) and have always wondered what kind of things I write about, here are some excerpts from them (I am currently writing in my sixth). It starts with the most recent and works it's way back to freshman year. Nothing interesting happened to me in middle school even though I still kept a journal then.   "I think oysters smell so disgusting. I don't know what made me think of this but sometimes my parents buy the kind in cans and they eat it in the kitchen and it stinks up the entire house. It's so gross. And they look completely unappealing, like dead, fat slugs."  "I was talking to Austin online last night and he goes 'my dad is reading everything I reight.' I have never seen that word spelled in such a messed up way."  "I have nothing to write about. Maybe I could start ranting about how Erin and Melanie were getting on me because I stacked an extra chair at lunch. Me: Erin, stack your chair! Erin: No, I'm being a rebel. Melanie: Don't give in to the dark side! Erin: I'm not going to give in to peer pressure. (I try to stack her chair, Erin tries to stop me) Erin: What are you doing? WHY ARE YOU STACKING IT! Me: They said to stack chairs. Erin: Do you always do what you're told? Me: Yes. Erin: If they told you to jump off a cliff would you do it? Me: Only if all my friends were doing it. (Erin and Melanie laugh hysterically) Melanie: You get 10 points for that one, Sarah. That's so awesome, I'm going to use that sometime. Anyway, I was really annoyed by that. Why shouldn't I stack a chair? What harm is it doing anyone? If you're going to be a 'rebel' then do it so what you're 'standing for' is something important and makes a difference. Not 'oh, I'm feeling rebellious. I'm not going to stack my chair.' That's not helping anyone. Rebellion should be started because you don't believe the way things are going is the right way. Not because you're lazy and don't want to stack a flipping chair. I don't do everything I'm told. I do what God says to do. God says to serve others. Therefore, I will stack my chair, and Erin's, and Melanie's, and Ryan's if I have to."  "Jeremy keeps saying 'fifthed' while he's trying to say a number to the fifth power. I think there is something seriously wrong with the people in this class."  "I definitely just failed that math test. I hate my life. I really do. Well, at least my journal is cool looking."  (this was around Valentine's Day) "Before class, I was standing there with Erin looking at the senior project posters and this girl came up and tapped me on the shoulder. 'Here,' she said, handing me 4 Hershey kisses. 'You get two extra because you're wearing a Forsberg jersey. He rocks.' She gave two to Erin. It made my day."  "Okay, I  can  tolerate 15 more minutes of this class. I  can . I  refuse  to go insane. I will  not  stab this pen in my eye."  "I am going to get the flu. I know it. I can feel the germs infecting me."  "I am ignoring Brandon today. The desk across from me is vacant. There is no annoying jerk there throwing his pencil at the ceiling."  "My mom hates it when I drive. She's always like 'SLOW DOWN! YOU'RE NOT STOPPING FAST ENOUGH!' Does she really think I'm stupid enough to not stop before I hit the car in front of me?"  "I hate algebra, I hate slope and y intercept, I hate variables, I hate graphing crappy lines, I never want to do this again."  (during small groups freshman year) "Kristin: Are we being loud?  Shane: Just a little. Kristin: Yeah well, at least we aren't putting bagels in our pants. Shane: Yeah, well at least we ate those bagels. Kristin: Are you kidding me? Shane: It was part of the game!"  Here is something else that happened on Take 5 that I wrote down but then I completely forgot about until I read about it just now: Q: What do you think about Canada? Shane: Um... it's above us? I don't know, I don't really care. Q: What is your favorite French cuisine? Shane: Probably salt.

      Right now, I am in Newspaper. There are two guys in this class named Jeff and Rudy. They are best friends. Jeff writes a humor column and a music column for the Features section of the paper. Jeff and Rudy think they are really funny! They're actually not. Last year, there was a guy in this class named John, and he is apparently Jeff's role model, because they cannot go an entire class period without talking about him. The only thing he talks about more than John is music and how awesome everything he likes is and how horrible anything outside of his music tastes is and how retarded people are who like that kind music. Example of his music taste: Rolling Stones, Beatles, Coldplay, Van Morrison, Bob Dylan. I personally have no problems with his music tastes, even though the only band out of those five that I genuinely love is Coldplay. The rest I don't really care about either way. (Except for Bob Dylan, who I hate. He is sort of freakish, especially on the Victoria's Secret commercial.) Going by what I have heard from my best friend Erin, who was friends with John last year, John can't stand Jeff because the ONLY thing he ever talks about... is music. WOW! I know exactly what that is like! Luckily, Jeff isn't obsessed with me the way he is with John.   A typical conversation with Jeff and Rudy: Jeff: John. John John John John John. I like music. John. Rudy: Blues Day is the best band in the world because I am in it, even though I sound like a tortured animal when I sing. Jeff: John likes music. So do I.  Rudy: Blah blah blah about AP Euro. Jeff: John would have taken AP Euro, but he left. John and I like music.  Rudy: Everyone is stupid but us. Jeff: Everyone is stupid but us because they don't have the exact same music taste as me, and John. Rudy: When I am a famous singer, people will wonder how I became famous, because I have no talent. Jeff: I like to make fun of Kaitlyn. Sarah: Oh my goodness, I can't believe you said a whole sentence without mentioning John. There is a God! Jeff:...JohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohnJohn... Repeat x 8 million.  Apparently, John "crashed" his email and made a new one because he didn't want to have to talk to Jeff anymore. Which is something I completely understand the motivation for.

      "most people do not pay a lot of attention to history or reason for things, usually it is okay, though. maybe in history there is a reason that people do not work on saturday and sunday, perhaps someone in the middle east sprained his ankle when he was walking around two thousand years ago! and then it was better about two days later, but the days that he could not walk were SATURDAY and SUNDAY! and probably those were greek words, saturday means CRAP MY ANKLE HURTS. and sunday means I THINK IT IS GETTING BETTER, TOUCH IT, AGHGHHHH OKAY, OKAY, DON’T TOUCH IT, IT STILL HURTS!!" -drew of tpfd.com fame

      IF YOU FINISHED READING THIS SENTENCE, YOU MUST DO AS I SAY.  If someone is actually reading this right now, comment on this post. I want to know who reads this all the time, because apparently there is more than I thought. And no you are not allowed to not post because... you just aren't. I thought I was basically just doing this for my own amusement but I get a kick out of the fact that I am not the only one who is entertained by this. Or maybe you're not entertained and you just read this because you know me. That's cool too. JUST POST, it makes me feel like I have more friends besides my computer.  And, just for good measure:        UPDATE: What am I even doing? No one is going to do this. The people who probably read this are slackers and never do what they are supposed to do. Oh well...

      Hey, guess what, you're not allowed to get pissed at me for not updating my blog because I'M NOT GOING TO BE HERE! Yes, that's right, I'm going to Costa Rica today and you can't stop me. So don't expect any updates until at least after July 5. But if I get to a computer while I'm in Costa Rica (which may or may not be likely) I probably won't post anything, but you never know. So, have a great next eleven days and don't miss me too much.

      I officially hate movie theaters. I went to see Harry Potter 3 for the fourth time by myself yesterday (no, I do not have a life, but thanks for asking) and when I was in line to get the ticket, there was this lady in front of me with her three kids and her mother who was like 60. I didn't really notice her, though, until I was in line to get food. She was in front of me in line, with her kids zipping around everywhere, and she wasn't doing anything to calm them or keep them from annoying everyone else. Then when she was done paying, she turned around and practically bowled me over because apparently I was in her Majesty's way and it would be an injustice to the world to move out of the way herself.   When I was walking down the hall towards the theater, the Queen was screeching at this other lady who was there with her kids. Here is how the conversation went:  The Queen: Excuse me. I REALLY didn't appreciate how you just STEPPED IN FRONT OF ME in line when I was standing there talking to my mother! Innocent Victim: I didn't think I did anything like that. The Queen: Well, YOU DID! Innocent Victim: Well I'm sorry you feel that way... The Queen: I just thought it was a HORRIBLE thing to do in front of your children, you're setting an awful example.  I wanted to turn around and say "right, and YOUR kids aren't going to be scarred for life because their mother overreacts to things that aren't even worth getting pissed about because HOLY CRAP, a person steps in front of you in line, YOU CAN'T WAIT ANOTHER TWO MINUTES TO GET  YOUR  FOOD? WHAT A GREAT EXAMPLE YOU ARE SETTING FOR YOUR OWN KIDS. YOU'RE RAISING THE NEXT GENERATION OF PEOPLE THAT EVERYONE HATES TO BE AROUND BECAUSE THEY ACT LIKE THEY ARE THE CENTER OF THE FREAKING UNIVERSE." People like that are just SO retarded. "Well I am going to inconvenience everyone in the world for the sake of my own happiness. But I'm going to complain if someone DARES do something that annoys me in the slightest." LADY! SELFISH PEOPLE DIE ALONE!!!!!!!!! REMEMBER THAT!!!!!  I was really really hoping that I would never have to see this lady again, but no. When I got into the theater and had sat down, GUESS WHO COMES IN AND SITS DOWN... RIGHT BEHIND ME. Yes. The Queen and her kids. And the Queen's mother was there too. Through the whole movie, someone was kicking my seat. Apparently, Queen, Sr. does not know how to watch a movie without being ANNOYING. It wasn't just the tapping kind of kicking either. It was the "I'm going to lodge my foot on the side and bounce around because I have a lot of energy" kind of kicking. It was the most horrible thing in the world. I was like okay, sorry if you haven't been to a movie in twenty years, but people STILL don't like having their seat kicked. What is wrong with people that NO ONE is considerate of anyone but themselves anymore? I don't understand this.  But the worst part wasn't the mom kicking my seat, or seeing the Queen screeching at another lady in the hall, or almost being trampled in the concession line. No, it was the little girl. The Princess sat through the entire movie, TALKING. She was actually pretty smart for a five year old or whatever she was, and she was adorable. But please. If you HAVE little kids who are going to talk through a movie like that, THEY ARE NOT OLD ENOUGH TO GO TO THE MOVIES. I swear, when I have kids they are not going to the theater until they know that TALKING IS NOT ALLOWED BECAUSE IT PISSES PEOPLE OFF. the girl was like "what's wrong with Harry? Is he sad? Is that his parents? Where is Harry going? Why is it dark? What is that dog doing? Why is that bus purple?" and on and on and on and ON... "does Harry really like that man? I thought he was bad. What's happening to them? Are they going to die? AWOOO! AWOOOO! AWOOO!" (continues AWOOOing for the rest of the movie)  So I guess what I want to say is, I am never going to the movies ever again unless someone else is paying for my ticket and there are NO kids in the entire theater.

      While sitting, lift your right foot off the floor and make clockwise  circles. Now, while doing this, draw the number "6" in the air with your  right hand.   Your foot will change direction and there's nothing you can do about it.   It is the most annoying thing in the world. Well, not the MOST annoying but still pretty annoying.

      "Another thing I did this weekend was go to the zoo. Nora was most interested in the tigers and the cows, and I was most interested in the  urlLink takin . An excerpt from that link, italics mine:  'Although takins have no skin glands, their entire body secretes an oily, strong smelling substance  that is said to have a burning taste.  It is believed that this smelly, thick substance serves as a moisture barrier on the animal's coat, protecting it from moisture caused by fog and rain that frequents its grazing grounds.'  I am sure it can be boring out there in rural China, but QUIT LICKING THE TAKIN. Although I do like the idea of teenage farmhands hazing each other with takin skin-glop.   #1: Here, lick this oxen-like creature. All the cool peasants are doing it. #2: Ahhh! It burns!"   urlLink -mimi smartypants

      Sarah: What is the difference between a yellow jacket, a hornet, and a bee? Sydnay: Who knows... yellow jackets and hornets don't die after they sting you, I don't think. Sarah: Why aren't there any sports teams called the bees, I mean, there are the hornets and the yellow jackets, but what's wrong with the bees? Sydnay: There's no sports teams named "the bees" cause they dont want to give the impression that the minute they win, they die.

Ross: I still don't really get it. Connor: Well I heard this story like when you die you go to a courtroom and God is the judge and Jesus is your lawyer and Satan is your prosecuter... (tells story that I don't want to type)... but if you're not a Christian then you don't have Jesus for your lawyer and Satan is like "he did this and this and this" and God's like "NO MERCY!" Opie: You could get Frank Azar to be your lawyer.  Connor: Yeah, but... Opie: (imitating Frank Azar) "I can get you four hundred thousand dollars, but you're still going to hell."

      "God is interested in developing your character. At times He lets you proceed, but He will never let you go too far without discipline to bring you back. In your relationship with God, He may let you make a wrong decision. Then the Spirit of God causes you to recognize that it is not God's will. He guides you back to the right path. He will clarify what He wants. He will even take the circumstances of your disobedience and work that together for good (Rom. 8:28) as He corrects you and teaches you His ways." -Henry Blackaby  "Tension is to be loved when it is like a passing note  to a beautiful, beautiful chord..." -Sixpence None the Richer  "You always were the one To make us stand out in the crowd Though every once upon a while Your head was in a cloud There's nothing you could never do To ever let me down And remember that I'll always love you..." -Badly Drawn Boy, "A Minor Incident"

      Hi, my name is EVERYONE, and I have NOTHING better to do than sit around and whine that Sarah hasn't posted. YOU PEOPLE ARE SO ANNOYING!  Fine, here. I am posting. I have nothing to say, but now you have something to read.   Actually, I just found this band called Finger Eleven. I love them. Someone buy me their new CD, the one that has the song "One Thing" on it.   Okay now I'm out of things to say. If you want something to read SO BADLY, then GIVE ME SOMETHING TO WRITE ABOUT! Or find someone else's blog and harrass them when they don't post on it!!!!!

      I am listening to a song called All That I Have Sown. It's by Bebo Norman, who is a Christian singer. I saw him in concert with my cousin. That's not the point of this story though. Anyway, here are the lyrics:  I believe when they put her in the ground I think they buried part of me Cause I’ve been searching I’ve been looking all around But I cannot find the heart of me The heart of me  So I put my fingers in this soil upon her grave And I will plant for her a garden And every flower a reminder of her face Will grow up graceful as a pardon  And all that grows is her story told As life unfolds here before us The peace I’ve found in this broken ground I can see her in the harvest Of all that I have sown  And long before I was covered up in grey Before the old had bent my bones We grow our children in the red Georgia clay They were our garden and our home  And that grows is our story told As life unfolds here before us The peace we’ve found in that broken ground I can see them in the harvest Of all that I have sown  And when my life is done I pray the kingdom come Take me to glory And its living inside me It was planted like a seed All to tell a story  And I believe when they put me in the ground There will remain a part of me Cause I’ve been searching And the joy that I have found Is living in my family It’s all that I have sown  It's a very pretty song. At the concert, he told everyone that he wrote it about his grandfather after he died. Or maybe it was right before, I can't remember. Anyway, I was listening to that song, and I guess I didn't really realize it the first forty times I've listened to it, but it just sort of sunk in that that's the kind of legacy I want to have, and whether I think it's likely or not, I will get married and have the chance to have that legacy. I've always had the knowledge that yeah, SOMEDAY I'll get a boyfriend, I'm not going to die alone, probably, but it always seemed so far away. But I'm almost seventeen, my birthday is the beginning of September, and back in "the day" of like, the Roman Empire, people got married when they were like twelve. So I'm already really behind!   No, not really. But in a year I'll almost be old enough to get married. I'll be gearing up for my senior year of high school and almost eighteen, and even though I fully intend to finish high school and go to college somplace, I don't hold it completely out of the question for me to meet or start dating someone I already know and then marry him right out of high school. Jen graduated last year and now she's engaged... I remember thinking it really strange to know that this girl who was running around in a Braveheart costume and a painted face on Field Day of my freshman year and living it up as a senior, this girl who would come up and try to shove me in my locker even though I'm several inches taller than her, this girl who would run up and talk to me whenever she saw me after Seminar since hers was two doors down from mine is getting married. She's only three years older than me. I'm not sure how old Josh is but it doesn't matter - you can tell how much they love each other. And it's sort of hitting me how badly I  want  that, because it's a chance to start off a process of changing people's lives, if that makes sense. You're starting a new life. You're making a huge committment to another person. You're promising to be there through everything that gets thrown at you. You're having kids, making decisions for their future, you're helping them grow up, you're God's tool to shape their lives. Hopefully they are making friends, they're impacting other people's lives, they're becoming adults, they're getting married, they're having their own kids... there are family reunions, holiday get-togethers, cousins rolling around on the floor eating crayons with each other... or maybe I'm just remembering my own early childhood. But I'm also remembering how much fun it was. Back then, I didn't know any better, and neither did they, so their parents' issues with my parents weren't our problem. We didn't care that in a few years, my mom would start sending my sister and me to public school even though my aunt was absolutely adamant for us to be homeschooled like her kids, because apparently, that was the ONLY way for us to get a good education. It just didn't matter. The only thing that mattered was that we were happy now, and we were having fun right then. And for a five year old, that's okay. We didn't have to worry about anything yet. We just played house, or guessing games, or Reader Rabbit on the computer, and watched Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego and Veggie Tales on my grandparents' big screen TV.   There were so many of us in Texas that there was a birthday practically every other week, and we lived close enough to my grandparents that whenever we were driving anywhere, my sister or I would always ask "can we go to Ama's house?" And usually, the answer was yes. Now, they live in Colorado Springs, which is about an hour away from us. I was hoping that, when they were moving here, they would live down the street or something, so that now that I'm old enough to take care of myself in most ways, I could just walk over and see them. But I can't exactly walk to Colorado Springs. I also can't just randomly pop over and say hi for ten minutes. I really wanted that.   Maybe what I really want is to give someone who is just a twinkle in someone else's eye all the things I wish I had right now. Like... going over to see my grandmother randomly at three in the afternoon and being able to get AWAY from the rest of my family instead of being stuck with them in the car for the hour trip there and the hour trip back. Or the happy environment I never understood when my dad and my granddad and all my uncles would sit in the living room and watch the Cowboys lose, again. (Of course, for my kids and nephews and nieces, it won't be the Cowboys. It will be the Avs. And they won't be losing.) Or the excitement I always felt when I knew I was going to get to spend a special night over at Ama's house with my Aunt Katie, who was still in high school when I was born and would take me to get snow cones every single time we "hung out" and one time she even pointed out one of her ex-boyfriends to me in the grocery store and told me not to mention him to my grandparents because "they don't like him very much." (I of course never told.) Or the somewhat interesting experience of prying crayons from a toddler's spit-covered hand after they had been slobbering all over it, wondering if it tasted the way it looked, and the laughter at the expression that graced their faces when they found out that it didn't.   And I'm thinking, is there anyone I could see myself spending my life with, who will be reminded of me when he looks at flowers, who loves me so much that he's not afraid to admit that a part of him died with me? It sort of blows me away that that's possible. I was watching the coverage of President Reagan's funeral. I was crying when they gave the flag to Mrs. Reagan... it was like that was the final confirmation for her that he was really gone. When she went up to his casket and put her head down on it... it was just so... real. You could just see how much she loved him. I want that kind of love. Maybe this sounds morbid, but I really want to be able to honestly cry my brains out at my husband's funeral, assuming he dies first, because I won't be able to remember what it was like without him. Or if I die first, which I'm not ruling out because that would be stupid of me, when I'm in the hospital hooked up to a million tubes and he's sitting there holding my hand and looking desperate, I want to be able to tell him that I had fun. It wouldn't have been without him. And that it's not really goodbye. I'd probably be seeing him in a few years anyway, assuming I'm not hooked up to a million tubes for some reason other than dying of old age.   It might seem silly to someone (like my 12 year old cousin who has already had four "boyfriends" - be assured that I refuse to let THAT aspect of childhood into at least my OWN kids' lives, I wasn't allowed to date until I was sixteen and they won't be allowed to either) that I haven't had a boyfriend yet, and I haven't even been aware of a guy that likes me as more than a friend, but I guess I've somehow always sort of known that someday I'm going to have that. Even if other people say things that or I make myself feel ugly and fat and retarded. Some guy out there isn't going to see that, and the ones that do aren't worth it. He could come along tomorrow or I might have to wait a while longer. But just the fact that he's out there is enough for me to go on when it comes to guys, for now.

      Hey, Costa Rica pals! Here are some things to keep in mind.   Galatians 5:13-15 For you have been called to live in freedom - not freedom to satisfy your sinful nature, but freedom to serve one another in love. For the whole law can be summed up in this one command: "Love your neighbor as yourself." But if instead of showing love among yourselves you are always biting and devouring one another, watch out! Beware of destroying one another.  Ephesians 4:1-6 Therefore I, a prisoner for serving the Lord, beg you to lead a life worthy of your calling, for you have been called by God. Be humble and gentle. Be patient with each other, making allowance for each other's faults because of your love. Always keep yourselves united in the Holy Spirit, and bind yourselves together with peace. We are all one body, we have the same Spirit, and we have all been called to the same glorious future. There is only one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and there is only one God and Father, who is over us all and in us all and living through us all.  Colossians 3:12-17 Since God chose you to be the holy people whom he loves, you must clothe yourselves with tenderhearted mercy, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience. You must make allowance for each other's faults and forgive the person who offends you. Remember, the Lord forgave you, so you must forgive others. And the most important piece of clothing you must wear is love. Love is what binds us all together in perfect harmony. And let the peace that comes from Christ rule in your hearts. For as members of one body you are all called to live in peace. And always be thankful. Let the words of Christ, in all their richness, live in your hearts and make you wise. Use his words to teach and counsel each other. Sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs to God with thankful hearts. And whatever you do or say, let it be as a representative of the Lord Jesus, all the while giving thanks through him to God the Father.

But no more! No, today, I am changed, for when I read the headline going with  urlLink this  story, I discovered the true meaning of "Need to Know."

      So as anyone who knows me at all knows, I am a procrastinator. I do nothing to hide this fact. This is the explanation of why it has taken me this long to put anything up on this blog about what actually happened on&nbsp;the missions&nbsp;trip I went on to Costa Rica. So, here we go.  &nbsp;  We were down there actually doing productive things for 9 days (I’m not counting the two days that consisted of us traveling because it just isn't interesting). The first day was spent getting to know our way around Belen, which is the town the church we were visiting is in. We prayer walked to the schools we would be visiting (we only ended up going to one)&nbsp;and that evening, we went to the church and met and then went home with the Tico familes we would be staying with. My family was of course incredibly nice and friendly, just like practically&nbsp;everyone else in Costa Rica, and we got along just fine, even though they spoke almost no English and I speak almost no Spanish. They had a Spanish-English dictionary and they would point at the words.   The next day was a free day to spend with our Tico families, where we were basically at their mercy. My family tried to ask me if I wanted to go to San Jose, Alajuela, or Heredia, and I had no idea because obviously I had never been to any of those places, and so they ended up deciding to take me to the mall in Belen and then to these craft places that my Tica mom (her name is Rosie) went to town in. But by that point&nbsp;I was so dehydrated that I felt like passing out and I barely remember anything that happened. That was not the best day of the trip. I was very happy when we went to the church that night and I could finally talk to people who spoke English again. The first thing I learned in Costa Rica is that a day is a really long time to be away from people you know when you're in a foreign country.   That was Saturday. And after Saturday comes Sunday! (Welcome to Kindergarten!) We went to the church in the morning. Well, because, that's what we do on Sundays. Just a heads up in case you ever go to Costa Rica, everyone is late. Everyone. It's just the way it is there. There are two rules in Costa Rica: everyone is late, and everyone drives like&nbsp;it's NASCAR. Anyway, Mabel and I (Mabel is my Tica sister) would leave for the church at 9:30 for the service, which started at 9:30. It wasn't too far, but every walk in Costa Rica is long for people who are used to walking on smooth sidewalks and not used to people staring at them because they are American and have blonde hair. In the church, we did the Desicion Time mime, and it actually came together despite all my misgivings (there were about a million). At the end of the mime, the power went out in the church, so the last few seconds were completely silent without music, but it was all okay because it's just a mime and you don't need to hear the music to get the point. That afternoon we went to Andrea and Arnulfo's house (they work with the youth group at the church) to do the first planning session with the Ticos for the retreat they were taking an unsaved friend on with them at the end of our trip. There were three groups - games, schedule, and the Decision Time mime. I got to help teach the Ticos the mime!&nbsp;WOOHOO! ...Okay, so it wasn't as hard as it sounds, a lot of people spoke English and were able to translate, and they learned it really really quickly. They learned it in four days. We taught them in the evenings of the days we were in the schools. When we were learning it, we had about five months and when we performed it the first time I was still worried about how it was going to turn out.   In the school on the first day (or was this the second day? I can't remember, it's all a blur), they had set up an assembly for us to star in, which was incredibly frightening, because we had to do a swing dance to show them "American culture." However, it went perfectly, and&nbsp;Austin and I didn't forget the steps for once and for some reason everyone thought it was really cool. After that, the other mime (King of Hearts) was performed by all the other people who weren't on the Decision Time mime, and that went really well. Everyone liked it. Over the next two days, we basically just hung out with them the whole time. We talked with them in the cafeteria, played basketball and soccer with them (okay that was the guys, not me) and just made friends. We were sort of surprised at how many kids were always around, considering they were supposed to be in school. We would ask them if they were supposed to be in class, and they said things like "yes, but the teacher is out here watching the soccer game" and "yes, but we're practicing our English talking to you so the teacher doesn't care." Which sort of surprised us, but everyone in Costa Rica is really laid back and the schedule isn't as big of a deal as it is in the States. The best part about it, though, is that we handed out a lot of little Knowing God Personally tracts in English and Spanish and the Gospel was shared with a ton of kids and at least two accepted Christ. It was the most amazing thing. On the third day, we got to do the Decision Time mime for them. I'm not sure they liked that one as much as the King of Hearts mime, but it was good that we got to do it again, because going to Costa Rica, we weren't sure we were going to get to do it at all, in case the Ticos didn't like it enough to want to learn it to show to their friends at the retreat.   (Random Costa Rican school trivia: it's their "winter" down there right now, so the break that they just went on is like the&nbsp;equivalent of&nbsp;our Christmas break. Their summer break is from December to February. All I have to say is, if it's that hot during their winter, I never want to go there during their summer.)   The last day we were in the school was Wednesday, June 30th. On Thursday, we took off for Punta Leona, which is a beach resort that is somewhere in Costa Rica. (I never really got my bearings when we were there, I never had any idea which direction we were going.) All I know is, Punta Leona is about 2 hours away from Belen, and there are iguanas and raccoons running around there, and, according to my friend who went to Grecia (the team that went down a week after we did), toucans. And also, huge spiders. Wait, I thought I was going someplace I could RELAX. Well, it really was beautiful there. Too bad I have no pictures because I dropped my camera in the ocean.You'll just have to take my word for it.   The retreat was the best part of the entire trip. It was what we had been working up to and praying about ever since we started getting ready to go on this trip back in January. And the best part about the retreat is, we weren't in charge for once. We were doing what the Ticos wanted to do, instead of the other way around. It was really nice. The camp we went to was in the mountains. It was pretty cold up there. Nothing like Colorado Rockies cold obviously, because these mountains are only about half as high elevation-wise as the Rockies. But it was still cold, and it was a weird humid cold, which is something I'm not used to, living in Colorado and everything, where "humid" is an alien concept. I'm not going to say the camp was "nice." For it to be "nice" it would have to not have enormous spiders in the bathroom stalls and hot water. So I'm going to say it was "decent" and "better than I was expecting." Of course the whole weekend went pretty much exactly the same way a youth group retreat at Grace Chapel goes, with water fights and competitive games that the girls usually try to avoid getting caught up in and just messing around the whole time. When the Ticos did the mime for their unsaved friends, they did it perfectly, and I was so happy that they pulled it off after only the few days they had to learn it. I'm not sure how many people became Christians, but I know there were some, and I know there were some seeds planted in people's hearts. God was working through the Ticos at that camp, and it was awesome.   I would just like to say that I really admire the Ticos in their ability to eat portions of rice and beans in one sitting that would feed my entire family in Colorado for the day. And that’s exaggerated only slightly. They really love their rice and beans. The first breakfast I had in my Tico home was… rice and beans. When we got to the private school we went to on the first Monday we were down&nbsp;there, they had prepared a presentation about Costa Rica (their history, government, culture, etc) that included serving us typical Costa Rican food, a.k.a., rice and beans. When we were on the retreat, guess what we had for breakfast? Rice and beans. Then we'd go and play some games and come back for lunch which was, rice and beans, but with soup this time instead of bread, which goes with breakfast. Time for dinner: more rice and beans, with a&nbsp;salad. The next day, breakfast is rice and beans. Lunch..... oh for lunch today we get an imitation sub sandwich. Well, who cares, it isn't rice and beans. I will never eat rice and beans again in my life.   And, the Pizza Hut pizza in Costa Rica OWNS American Pizza Hut. I don't know how, it's just better.  &nbsp;  In conclusion, this trip was absolutely fantastic. Everyone learned so much - we all got to be so close and such good friendships were made. We learned from the Ticos and the Ticos learned from us, and we just had an amazing time letting God work through us to reach out to the Ticos' friends. I would do it over again in a second.

      "Lassie looked brilliant, in part because the farm family she lived with was made up of idiots. Remember? One of them was always getting stuck under the tractor, and Lassie was always rushing back to the farmhouse to alert the other ones. She'd whimper and tug at their sleeves, and they'd always waste precious time saying things: 'Do you think something's  wrong?  Do you think she wants us to  follow  her? What  is  it, girl?' as if this had never happened before, instead of every week. What with all the time these people spent pinned under the tractor, I don't see how they managed to grow any crops whatsoever.

      I just saw Spider-Man 2, and I have to say that I really enjoyed it. I didn't like it better or less than the first one, I think they're both equally good movies. There were some moments of cheese in this one, but not so much that I wanted to hurl all over myself, thankfully. And Tobey Maguire and James Franco are both incredibly attractive, so that is definitely a bonus.  Towards the beginning, there was a lady who was at the scene of a crime. I can't remember exactly what was going on, but cars were getting thrown around, as usual. When one stopped right above her head and the heads of several other moronic people who decided to just stand there and watch from a street corner, the very intelligent woman said "Oh! It's a web!" Wow, really? Thanks for telling me, I wasn't really sure. Is  that  what that white rope stuff is? That stuff holding a police car up in the air and keeping it from falling on you and crushing you to death? Amazing, I would never have guessed, especially since you live in a city where the local superhero is called "Spider-Man." Wow! I feel enlightened!  Still. It was a great movie.

      Forgive me if now I wear the face of worry This time alone could never cause any doubt But I’ve been cold too long Such a strange time to find myself coming down as the rain With all the holes my love, To fill up from the middle This storm could stay all night  So can you stay until we close our eyes Til your dreams hold mine Just stay until we know we tried one more time  Cause laughing lovers can overcome their closest demons And they’ll go on and they won’t let go They saw something that they know Has never come so close Can it stay here for us, for now?  Can it stay until we know ourselves? I’m torn as I tell You’re the story that I know and fell from I’m so far into your story I don’t know why We think we’re in control When we lie between the lines  We’ll find a line to follow It’s got to show real soon Or we’ll never reach this high  We climb a little further Cause there’s nothing we can’t get around together Further gets colder until nothing was all that I saw around  So we stay until the ground That we can’t come down from splits us away Maybe stars know why we fall I just wish they were thinking out loud Oh, I could wish all night  -Finger Eleven, "Thousand Mile Wish"

      I was on this site earlier where this girl was trying to join a lame GreatestJournal community. You had to fill out this little application, post it, and then people would vote yes or no on you. This particular girl didn't make it in because she said she didn't like The Beatles.  Okay. I have no problem with The Beatles. I have no problems with people who like The Beatles. But, I know what I'm about to say is blasphemy, but I really don't like The Beatles. I really don't. One of the people who voted no on the girl said "No. You don't like the Beatles. They're legendary." Oh, okay. That's a reason to like them? Lots of things are legendary. Charles Manson is "legendary." Does that mean I have to like him, too? Legendary isn't a synonym for "good." I don't care if they're legendary, I don't like their music. Maybe they were pioneers in rock and roll, and I guess I can be grateful for that because if they hadn't done what they did, the music scene would be a lot different today. But forgive me for not liking their music. I have run across a few songs by them that I do like, but not enough to say that I am a Beatles fan.   But I think it's really retarded that all these people are like "oh my gosh you hate The Beatles! HOW COULD YOU!" Yeah, there are people who don't like The Beatles. AMAZING, I know. But if I said "oh yeah, I like The Beatles, they're... legendary" I would feel like a loser who was only saying that to avoid people telling me to die and that they hate me because of it. But even if people do tell me that, I'm not going to care, because strangely enough, I feel that there are more important things to spend my time debating over. I'm not going to waste my time defending why I don't like The Beatles when there actually is more to life than some 16 year old girl's music tastes and how they clash with yours.  So I don't like The Beatles. Hopefully, you can get over it. If you can't, well, then that's your problem and I'll see you once you get out of group therapy with other people who can't handle my opinions on things.  Here is a list of bands/singers that I DO like, just so you can get even more riled up to not see The Beatles mentioned.  Switchfoot, Rooney, Foo Fighters, Jars of Clay, Some Kind of Hero, The Smiths, Coldplay, Finger Eleven, Joseph Arthur, Dashboard Confessional, Norah Jones, DC Talk (Kevin Max), John Mayer, Incubus, Anberlin, Badly Drawn Boy, Dido, Evan and Jaron, The Elms, Lifehouse, Filter, Mindy Smith, Foolish Things, David Crowder Band, Hoobastank, The Calling, The Lyndsay Diaries, Semisonic, Sixpence None the Richer, Ben Folds (Five), Michelle Branch, Seven Places, Copeland, Further Seems Forever, Sanctus Real, the beautiful mistake, Yellowcard.

      Notice: If you want to see Costa Rica pictures, email me, and I will send you some. I just couldn't stand not having the profile and archives and things on the side at the top of the page. It was just really really really bothering me how the pictures were screwing up the format of the page, so deal with it, they're not on here anymore.

      Because of recent events, I have to post this again, because now it applies for more than just one of my friends.

      Well, I'm back. And it was amazing. I got back at like 10:30 or something, I don't know. Whatever, I'm too tired to talk about it right now, I'll post more tomorrow. All I'm doing now is quotes, because I have like a ton.   "This is already fun and we haven't even left church!" -Austin the morning we left, right after we got on the bus to the airport and there were like a billion moths inside that were attacking Brittany and me  "If you crash into something, stop the car." -Ernesto  "Hey you stupid redhead, I'm gonna beat you next time. Not only do I have to protect her physically but emotionally too? Don't make my wings grow fists." -Derek to Opie, who was being Brittany's MSN Butterfly and protecting her from bad stuff like they do on the commercials  (driving around Belen) Ken: Anybody want to buy some pencils? Derek: What? No gracias. Ken: There's a kid on the corner and he's selling pencils and he has to sell fifty so he can buy food to eat tonight. Derek: Oh... really? Ken: I don't know, maybe. Derek: Why you gotta make crap up and make me feel bad.  Sara: (after he did something weird) Who ARE you, Stevo? Stevo: I'm good!  "Go long! Really long, like 4 blocks long. I CAN throw that far, trust me. I AM the next John Elway!" -Derek to Brittany when she wanted the football  Sara: Don't laugh at me! Why are you laughing at me? Kenneth: I want to.  Me: What is in your backpack, Ross? Ross: Your mom. Me: Oh, right. Sara: What's in there?  Me: My mom, apparently.  "I think I'm having an out of body experience." -Connor randomly during debrief  "It's crazy... everything is so slow and laid back... until they start driving." -Ken  (In Costa Rica, everybody is late to everything and it's no big deal but they all drive like maniacs)  Ashley: Your mom. Minor: Why my mom? My mom is not here.  (sort of late at night, someone takes a picture and it has a bright flash) Derek: Geez, WARN us when you're gonna tell us you're gonna take a picture- Kyle: Warn us when you're gonna tell us? "Hey. I'm about to tell you something."  "My Tico family was pretty nice... except the grandma, who poured boiling water all over me." -Ross  "I'm one of the smart people who opened their eyes under water in the ocean. 'Let's see what the ocean looks like! Oh! It looks like burning!'" -Austin  (At lunch in Punta Leona, the beach resort place we went to, there was a leaf that was a decoration on Sara's dessert.) Connor: (picks up leaf) This is one of those edible leaves. Sara: No it's not, it's just a plain leaf. Connor: No, it's edible. (conversation shifts for a while until) Connor: It's kind of sugary. (is holding the leaf and there's a piece missing from it) Sara: Really? (grabs leaf and takes a bite out of it) It is kind of sugary. (big pause where everyone stares at her) Sara: Now he's going to hold up the piece of the leaf and tell me he didn't really eat it. Connor: (holds up the piece of the leaf) I didn't really eat it.  (at the retreat) Me: Where'd your stalkers go? Austin: I don't know, maybe they went to bed. Sara: No, they're in their room, primping in front of the mirror. Me: Ooh, they're getting ready to come and talk to you again. Austin: I love how you're enjoying this so much.  Connor: I have (something unintelligible) Austin: What? Connor: Hiccups. Austin: Oh, I thought he said hippos. I was like oh... okay... I hope you enjoy them...  "One time my brother got pissed at me because I broke his wrist on purpose." -Austin  "You act like your plate is a bunch of problems." -Austin to me when I had the last plate of rice and beans I will ever eat  "I brought like nine or ten pairs of shirts..." -Austin  Sara: Why you gotta be racist, Kyle? Kyle: I'm not racist, I have a color TV.  Sara: Don't ever do that again. Kyle: Don't ever try to make me feel like I'm stupid.  "I hate the question 'do they have the 4th of July in England?' Yes, it comes after the third and before the fifth." -Austin  "I love how it's pressurized for our comfort and not for the fact that if it wasn't pressurized we'd all probably die." -Austin during the saftey video on the plane ride back
