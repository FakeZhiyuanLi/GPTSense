      I saw the look on her face when he told her to SHUT UP The tears straining behind her eyes As she gazed steadfastly at the TV  The Lightning won  Bringing back memories of  1961 another team a lifetime ago  Before him Before me  When life held promise Before it all went to hell  Copyright 06/08/2004 Therese “Parpar” Baric

      I worked at a bank once On the private banking floor Our clients were the “crème de la crème” of society High Society?  I remember one client  He had over13,000,000 dollars in his account He swore at the receptionist Hurled a nameplate across the room He was off balance All because His account was  By one penny  Henry Ford’s widow was burgled She offered a 1,000,000 reward for the return of her necklace The necklace was recovered But when it came time for the reward She reneged  The rich rob you without putting a gun to your head They do it in subtle ways Usually the word “fee” is involved For an imagined service They steal way more than those convicted of theft They steal our dignity  This country has reached its saturation point The wealthy have soaked up everything It is time we put them through the wringer  And let their fortunes trickle down to those who need it most  Where are you, Robinhood!?!?

      Quarter till two turbid faces unveiled  with the flick of a switch  as the smokescreen clears the drunk the lonely the tired the empty scramble to make one last move before the game is over hoping to capture a knight or a queen  as morning dawns truths reveal nothing but pawns 	 still in the game only three players left... CHECK pride staves off imminent defeat another pawn sacrificed CHECKMATE the queen wins again	 					 and so I stayed and had another pretending  it didn’t matter that you left and went home with her										  Copyright 05/13/04 Therese "Parpar" Baric

      It’s happening again history has a rather ugly habit  of repeating itself  silence becomes our assent  Apathy has swept through this country leaving a corrupted state in its wake  My vote won’t make a difference and this one said it and that one said it until more than half the population said it  A government for the people and the people got lazy and the government went crazy  Tax breaks for billionaires no one seems to care  Let’s DEFEND America against a country that hasn’t attacked Let’s prostitute America to the country that has  Our leaders lied to the rest of the world and we wonder why they hate us? Our leaders lied to us they profit from this mess Where is the outrage?  It’s happening again!  Listen, can’t you hear?!? dead silence silence, the most frightening sound of all   Copyright 05/11/04 Therese "Parpar" Baric
