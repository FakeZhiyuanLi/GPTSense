      bound to be bound to each others dependence which room is mine i have been forgetting lately adult programming has conquered me like it has once before morse code taps on thin unpainted walls awakes me but also warns me forbidden knowledge screams out bonus a restraining order for longing compassion disorderly straining for encompassing longing zipcodes kill time zones when noone is looking empires all crumble when noone is lucky

      your strive for importance and your lack thereof evolve, but lacking letters played backwards ruins nearly everything its a set up in itself youll come to realize convert your converse to convey more convenientionality

      im not much more than my satisfaction but im not one for fullfillment when will they let me breath again forsaken elements and im craving what ive abandoned spinal fluid and 2 liter sodas self defense and stripes something more than my eyes will ever let me believe and what i wouldnt give for some sense of reasonless lust bury my apathy hijack it baby my cockpit feels empty along with my aspirations

      nominations have declared me as their weekly wardrobe and interpretations have never seemed to let me down so much my fingertips are feeling cold tonight but you wouldnt know that feeling formulas, youve studied them so and pressed repeat youre attempts at meaning, dont mean much to me choose a color to match the number assigned at the end of your name oscillating is the verb you selected but shock factor doesnt affect me anymore self inflicted, somewhat overrated curiosity for how deep you are you tell me, and for once i believe you

      hidden in my blind spot then opens its eyes so bright and wings so wide its name, once spoken, now unheard you let me hear it a bit when i was young i told you "i cant say anything" but you just didnt listen and downtown speaks when it misses your voice but it sees that youve lost half of your mobility when you went away, and you knew it would ruin me too. but with it, all my lines have been dotted when they used to be solid and dark. my carpet now shows me traces of the new past and it reminds me that time means a lot so now i dont abide by genetics and forces of nature all i have left is well mentioned, and thinning as well.

      all this time, genocide hours minutes and seconds bleeding we feel it for them developement, cardboard boxes the lost piece of the jigsaw puzzle the one that makes us it knows a thing or two about possibilities and roads less traveled and options forgotten and knowledge is needed but all of these highways and numbers of such power memory, save my communication / reputation save our separation markers, for the most part, unused but each and every color says more than youll ever know im longing to show you how long it took to show.

      she made me a cape so i learned how to fly she made me a coffin so i learned how to die enveloped in the devil's undeveloped undertones never ever heard cuz we dont pick up the phone we tend to round down cuz its the only way we know how to fall and you, youre always overacting when you think youre sufficient, but you really are still lacking any kind of knowledge about the days that have passed you need to buy a time machine and you need to buy it fast oh it was quite a sight when we turned off all the lights a party aint a party unless it cant last all night lots of words were spoken, a loud room full of syntax she fucked me and i fucked back and the slingshots slowly showed us everything
