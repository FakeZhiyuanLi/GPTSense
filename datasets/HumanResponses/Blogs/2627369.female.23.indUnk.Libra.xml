       urlLink Mary Ellis-Bunim dies at 57 . Had she just kicked it from natural causes or perhaps a piano falling on her head, I would probably treat this situation a little more sarcastically. But she had been struggling with breast cancer, and I know too many good women who have fought the same battle. [via  urlLink CDB ]

       urlLink TOTC , if I didn’t just commit my current life to celibacy, I would so totally go down on you for  urlLink this . Where were you when I was in 6th grade and running for class president. All I had were some awful Bush jokes ripped off of Saturday Night Live (“not gonna do it”) and the promise of an 8 hour recess. Perhaps the next time I run I will give you a call.   In other, I am so all over TOTC today news, they link to  urlLink this story  about a whale that exploded on a city street. Delicious.

       urlLink Miss. L  has come up with a brilliant idea to avoid post-breakup phone calls:  “I got an idea for a website. Two, actually: "dontcallhim.com" and "dontcallher.com" You go there, and read a manifesto on why you should not call the person you want to call but shouldn't (like your ex). The original idea came when my friend Jeremy got three calls in one night from a girl he'd JUST started dating and I said "Dude, she shouldn't call you, she should call me, and I'll tell her why she shouldn't call you." (The original idea was for operators to be standing by to tell people how to play their current romantic situation. 1-900-LUVADVICE.) But back to the website: maybe there would be little tabs you could click on that corresponded to your situation. "Because he's an asshole", "Because of that restraining order", "Because it's only been twenty minutes", "Because you already left her three messages." Etc.”

      This dirrrrty mag is attempting to revive itself in the vein of Maxim. Apparently,  urlLink “The new Penthouse will go after readers of the so-called lad magazines…who have grown bored with air-brushed models and sophomoric humor.”  I just wonder…when aren’t the women in Maxim airbrushed? I just hope this means the new Penthouse centerfolds will have a thick waistline and a five o’clock shadow forming on their legs. Not to mention some unkempt nether regions. They can just rename the publication BUSH. [link via  urlLink TMFTML ]

      In a post-break up stew fest I was watching Full House and balling my eyes out. And I wondered, through tears, what has happened to  urlLink Stephanie Tanner . The Olsen twins have their kiddie porn empire, DJ has been in some crap made for TV romantic comedies, but Stephanie? I searched the Internet and found this…   urlLink “Stephanie Tanner grew some nice looking breasts.”    On a second google run I unearthed a  urlLink Jody Sweetin fansite  [it offers “totally cool” special features], which provided me with more accurate information [though her tits did get huge]. She went to her  urlLink High School prom  in '98, was on Party of Five in ’99, was married in the summer of ‘02 and turned 22 on January 17th. OH MY GOD! Then I realized I was spending too much time looking for useless information to create an ironic post, so I stopped. Though I will pass this on, if you guys like totally want to send her fan mail or ask for pictures of her tits, send the requests here:     Jodie Sweetin  "Stephanie Tanner" c/o Savage Agency ATTN: Judy Savage 6212 Banner Avenue Los Angeles, CA 90038

      He’ll be drunk in the streets of New Brunswick this weekend if you want to hit it.  The only requirement...sparkly flesh.   His latest retort:  “I still think girls look cuter when they wear body glitter* no matter how long ago the trend started. (There are exceptions tho, some people just can't be fixed.) I mean look at the invention of the sock. It was invented hundreds of years ago yet it is still holding strong today. I wear a clean pair everyday. We, cavemen, didn't have this luxury thousands of years ago but I bet many wish they did. Just because the sock was invented more than "five years ago" doesn't mean it is bad, should be banned, nixed from society, or written about discriminatorily in a BLOG. And yes...I did just use that word. On a final note... it can be equated to the annoyance of sand when it comes to the topic of sex with a girl who rocks the body glitter ."  *these stars are getting to be a little  urlLink David Foster Wallace  if you ask me, but alas, this is the most i have ever talked about body glitter in my life.

      I hit up Kim’s birfday extravaganza @ Friday’s tonight. Select present and former Borders employees were in attendance. There were major conversations on the topics of boobs and lesbians, carried on by me, and some secular discussion of Linkin Park and “mind erasers.” Kim developed a new diet craze for bulimics, Vodka. I drank a hot chocolate with a shit load of whipcream and looked at pictures of Carolyn’s cats. Kim was delicately tipsy by the time I left. Happy 21.*   *Had this been some sort of hipster.blog outing the post would have looked more like this: DJed Kim [hyperlink]’s bash @ [insert name of nyc bar here].

      We ain't no "kingpin," but we're more badass than NY.  NJ ranks 16th in survey of corruption convictions  "Its corruption index was 3.57, based on federal prosecutions. Mississippi topped the list, at 7.48. By - New Jersey is more corrupt than most states, but hardly the most corrupt, according to a new survey. New Jersey was ranked the 16th most corrupt state in terms of federal corruption convictions per 100,000 residents from 1993 to 2002. The report, "Public Corruption in the United States," was researched by Corporate Crime Reporter, a Washington-based newsletter, and published Friday. New Jersey has a well-chronicled history that led the Almanac of American Politics to once brand it "the nation's most corrupt state." But based on New Jersey's 307 corruption convictions in U.S. District Courts in Newark, Camden and Trenton in 10 years and its 2002 population of 8.6 million, the new study gave the state a corruption index of 3.57. That was less than half the 7.48 rate of the study's corruption kingpin, Mississippi. New York barely made the graft top 10, at 4.56, and Pennsylvania was 14th, at 3.78."

With the clever name of  urlLink MtvU , "...the channel will feature not-yet-famous young musicians and bands popular with 18-24 year-old students, regular news updates and programs on such topics as job-hunting and dating.

Friedman said the channel has signed on a number of advertisers, including companies like fried-chicken chain KFC and Bugle Boy jeans, who would not regularly market on MTV's flagship channel." The ultimate in postmodern entertainment and retail, College students will be forced to live in a state of fashion limbo, clutching lifelessly onto their mini tv/vcr combos for support.

      I'd like to share this review of "Get Born" with you, since this has become the "Jet Blows Blog." Hopefully this will help me to get over my unfortunate purchase.   "i had the jet album "on my phonograph" after the holidays as an attempt to defy convention: the convention being, of course, that "get born" sucks. Since everyone, even my beloved boyfriends, said it was so stinking bad, i thought i'd be original by bucking popular opinion and checking it out. hell, i wanted to like it, just to root for the band people scoff at. but if you can't tell by the direction this paragraph is heading, i obviously have been defeated in my attempts to like jet: the album blows. the pseudo-bluesy ballads are uninspired and for crap, and while "are you gonna be my girl" and the few other uptempo songs almost rock, there aren't enough of them to make this album worth a second thought." From  urlLink the blueprint.    (Thank you Mr. Lopez from Miami who purchased this shit from me,  good luck and god speed.)

The soundtrack was also a nice deterrent from the shit love story on the screen, it was probably better than the film.

      Wow,  urlLink Get Born  fucking blows. “Are You Gonna Be My Girl” pulled me in, it’s a decent song, much like “Get Free” was a decent song. But like that shit Vines album Jet tries to conjure up its inner Beatle. Like this post, it all just seems so forced. At least with the Vines album the songs that where not raising Lennon, where tight. I can’t say the same for Jet. I guess I should have listened to Albert Hammond Jr. when he told Rolling Stone they where awful. At least I only paid $7.98 for it, if anyone wants it I’m selling it on  urlLink Amazon .

      Idiot kid crawls into crane game,  Fox gets the story.    urlLink WBAY-Coverage You Can Count On: Boy Crawls Into Arcade Machine, Becomes Trapped   A seven-year-old boy got in a fix in Sheboygan when he crawled into a supermarket's stuffed animal game machine and couldn't get back out.  Shift Commander Mark Zittel of the Sheboygan Fire Department says that when rescuers arrived, the boy was sitting among the stuffed animals inside the glass enclosure. The stuffed animals are prizes that can be hooked with a crane-like device.  Zittel says the boy's father was three feet away at a pay phone, and when he turned around the child was in the machine. Zittel says the boy somehow crawled through about an eight-inch-by-ten-inch opening.  The boy stayed calm and didn't panic as firefighters responded to the Piggly Wiggly store and got a locksmith to open the main loading door. The process took about an hour.  Zittel says the boy was not injured or traumatized, but he desperately needed to use the bathroom by the time he was freed.

      The hotttest class @ NSU this spring...   urlLink Hip Hop Dancing  NDRF0109 A 6 session(s). Wed, 8:00-9:50 PM, beg. February 4. $220.00 Register: Non-Credit  Jorge Pabon (Popmaster Fabel)  Learn two of the most exciting dance forms of the seventies funk movement: Popping and Locking. When these dances debuted on Soul Train, they took America by storm and influenced many early Hip Hop dancers. Popping/Boogaloo style is a robotic dance form featuring both fluid and sharp angular movements that create illusions. Locking is a funky dance that incorporates points, wrist rolls, hand claps, and locks. We cover the foundations of the "electric boogaloo" style: the "twist-o-flex," "walk outs," and the "Egyptian twist," as well as components of Locking, including "skeeter rabbits," "scooby doos," and "scoo bot hops." Beginners welcome. Wear loose comfortable clothing and footwear that doesn't have too much grip/traction. Class meets at a studio to be announced; please call (212) 229-5883 after Jan. 4 for location. (0.0 credits)

      My mom saw  urlLink The Passion of The Christ  last night, when asked how it was she said, “excellent, really excellent.” Though she used the same tone she always does when explaining her reaction to a movie.

I was afraid it would turn into slapstick, though for my now my hope has been rekindled.

      I don’t back “gay marriage.” It’s true, I just can’t support the term. We do not call “marriage” “straight marriage,” although that is what it is.

If love is blind, I think marriage should be the same.  urlLink Oh and Bush, please take your seat.

Honey happy fucking 23rd, but when your songs are only 1.6 minutes long on average, you can’t keep talking for 7 years in between them. I care about shakin’ my hips and givin’ my tits a little shimmy, I don’t care about your friend “Stormy” who is in from Portland or the “bling” someone bought you for your birthday. When the Gossip actually played their shit last night it was good, just not tight. It didn’t help that Beth continued to “stage dive” during some of their better songs ("sweet baby", "where the girls are"). Oh well…I was so dissatisfied that I left halfway through their set.

       urlLink  “A woman of 22 does not come at a full skirt, fitted twin set and pair of pumps with the same set of associations that a woman 20 years her senior might. For the younger woman, such a combination is merely a style, not a blanket symbol of the wrongs of patriarchy, nor an intimate reminder that her mother's life was less than it could have been.”     So yes, yes, yes, I may wear the new distressed 50’s fashion and not feel like I am pissing all over the women’s movement. The clothes are hot, I agree. Though the real issue is not what the clothing represents, but that it is being recycled on runways by models who are handpicked to determine women’s beauty. The models are a clear reminder that the patriarchy of my mother’s time has been recoded for my postmodern generation.  It is not the clothing that means now, it is the women who are posed to sell it.

      for the ladies [or perhaps gentlemen] who really really can't get any, and are too afraid to admit it.  urlLink Boy hawks sex lies on e-bay.  The bid is up to $35. I feel for that sort of money, there should be some nudie photos involved or at least a little bush diving. [thanks kim.]

      I never thought I would be drunk in a  urlLink dorm room  and there I was, sitting on Mary’s floor, telling some guy he had soft hands.* Two flirtinis down and I was afraid to go near the foudu for fear of falling into it. The only regret I have was missing  urlLink Justin Timberlake’s  half time show.   *Though I believe I only said this to distract him so Mary could makeout with his girlfriend in the kitchen.  Beside I am so totally celibate until Albert Hammond Jr. is ready to have me.

      I am obsessed with  urlLink Parking Lot . In the vain of “real tv,” a  urlLink Trio  camera crew waits in pre show lots to interview fans about the event they are about to attend.  "Parking Lot explores the obsession of fandom in those anticipatory moments before the 'show'.” I especially enjoyed the toothless drunken surfer reminiscing about SoCal culture to the camera, while his dog gnawed on a shoe behind him. Though I don’t understand why Trio tried to run a marathon when they only have six episodes. At least I can catch up on my  urlLink Queer Eye , until I hit up Mary’s totally girlie Supa Bowl bash complete with chocolate fondu and flirtinis.

      I'm a little "busy."   Here is what Joshua R. Flower esq. III has to say about my possible job opportunity..  "Ah, joining the big leagues of non profit America, huh?  Good for you.  Just don't expect me to kiss the brass ring!  Oh I can see the power rushing to your head already.  "She used to be a nice girl," they'll say in the war torn streets of Dunellen, "but now she goes around in her $1000 pumps and her glittery silk teddies drinking manhattans from nalgene 16 oz. water bottles, singing klezmer music and waving the soviet flag.  scribbling passages from blondie on store windows and threatening anyone who gets in her way with a straight razor named 'Doris,' who's going through a rough sexual identity crisis these days, and no she does NOT want to talk about.  Poor Doris.  She used to be such a nice girl, but now she goes around in--" and then of course a gigantic safe falls on their head, and then a cartoon duck named Horace flutters down, dials in the combo, opens up that beautiful bastard, and out pops Maria Conchita Alonzo, singing, "Born in the U.S.A" while a marching band plays Run DMC and Saddam Hussein break dances on closed circuit TV for all the world to see.  The world is charmed by Saddam's tricked out flavor and world peace settles atop the world  like a fat man into a warm tub."

      I am in love with  urlLink Lucky  magazine! The new issue is filled with spring bags and my pages are covered in drool. The mag is no nonsense, just full on shopping. It is porn for the eternal browser.  Last night I bought the new issue and sat in Newark Penn flipping through the pages, dreaming about hot new spring outfits when a woman sat down next to me. She asked me what time it was, I told her. She complemented me on my glasses, I thanked her. She continued, “I wanted a pair like that but my mother, she says they make me look too black.” She stared at me and I told her, her mother was a little harsh and assured her she would look fine in my frames. Then she went in for the kill, “I can’t even buy pizza for my kids, I don’t even have a dollar and they are hungry (there where no children around, not for miles) and if you would lend me something, I’ll get your address and then I will mail you back your money.” She was a smooth operator, I gave her some cash and she asked me, “How much was that magazine?” I told her, “$3,” and she replied, “that’s a lot.”

      My mother had one of those pay for accounts with  urlLink Virgin Mobile , but she hadn’t used the phone in 2 months. Four weeks ago I went and put money on the fucking thing to use it And it didn’t work, and I wait and it still didn’t work and I call and they tell me that the number had been given away to some bitch named Halle. So for the last month I have been “under investigation,” waiting for a return on my cash. Right now I am on hold for the 60th time listening to  urlLink Gwen Stefani  whining about being a girl. Stop fucking trying to be “cool” Virgin Mobile and just give me my fucking $20 back, you bastards. The worst part, the ultimate worst part about calling is getting through the voice activated operator, “Amber”, to get to an actual person. To do this you must give “Amber” your number, and she says “now give me your number, your real one, not the fake one you used last night at the bar.” Fuck you “Amber” we are not best friends, you’re a fucking robot and I hope you get a virus. Damn you Virgin Mobile, I hate you so much, but then you give me the  urlLink Virgin Megastore  and you call me pretty things and I give in.

       urlLink Sleater-Kinney , well maybe they got off to a rough start Tuesday night, the vocals were barely audible, but things shaped up soon enough.

      So my rash appears to be some sort of “contact dermatitis” caused by an allergic reaction to my belt buckle. It’s a shame; I really like my belt, now I’ll have to shop for another.   I always seem to contract odd skin conditions, when I was 17, right before prom, I got this boil. Who the fuck gets a  urlLink boil  at 17? I showered often, changed clothes, changed sheets. I had to get the bastard “lanced.” They couldn’t numb the area so they gave me a stress ball to squeeze and proceeded to cut into my side with a scalpel. The nurse told me a story about the most disgusting boil she had ever seen. It was gigantic, the size of a baseball and it was attached to a trucker named Tim.   During the “procedure,” the doctor asked me if I wanted to see what she was “draining” out of the boil. Through my tears I looked down, her gauze was covered in blood and green puss, fucking gross.   I don’t understand why I can’t just get sick like normal people, at least my skin conditions are becoming a little less disgusting. So uh…who wants to make out?

      According to one of the women in my poetry class, I am not a dedicated feminist. Why? Because I told her I was not going to the  urlLink March For Women's Lives . Instead I'm sitting at my desk knee deep in lesbian erotica, balancing The Feminine Mystique on my right leg and mulling over post modern sexual politics in the wake of B. Spears.

      Hype and I don’t get along, it doesn’t matter how “great” the band being hyped is, I always choose to turn my back for a while and let the initial awe wear away. Like with those  urlLink Franz Ferdinand  boys or  urlLink The Shins . I refused to listen to  urlLink Chutes to Narrow  for a good long time and then….three days ago I fell in love. I tried to take the cd out of my player, but it only found it’s way back again.   Holy shit! Gone for Good is one of  the   best break up songs ever crafted. I just keep listening to it over and over like when I was 13 and obsessing over  urlLink Blind Melon ’s No Rain. (I actually went so far as to make an entire 60-minute tape of just that song, fucking insane.) It’s brilliant, with lines like, “Honey you want to fight for this love / but you can not wrestle a dove.” It’s an anthem for those who have broken hearts/brokenhearts. I see it as the end result of  urlLink Wilco ’s I’m The Man Who Loves You, but perhaps I am a little pessimistic these days.

      Our good friend Josh [you know, Gina's boyfriend, that girl in the sexy confederate flag bikini from a few posts back] seems to be having some trouble with his peers calling him a "racist." [ urlLink not really sure why ] But he received  urlLink harsh hate mail  and when he didn't reply, the hater wrote him this...  "I sent you a message before it was the message about you being racist why didn't you respond? i know that Hitler would have."  To which Josh replied...  "I do not like minorities because they are a parasite, A plague and a burden on the advancment of the White race."  So it appears that Hitler actually has e-mail.

      Today I was called a lesbian because I have short fingernails and like to masturbate. Apparently, some stereotype exits out there where these two characteristics equal a love for muff diving. I got a little defensive and dumb founded. The use of “lesbian” here was obviously referring to the “butch” stereotype, therefore rendering me “masculine.” It’s 2004, why do women still have to live under the tyranny of decorative fingernails and celibacy in order to avoid being targeted as “lesbians” or “ urlLink tomboys ”? More importantly, why do I still care if people think that I am? I feel like I am back in High School, averting my eyes in the locker room, so Dawn won’t giggle and shout, “dyke” at the top of her lungs. I mean god, it’s not like I got called a “Christian,” that would have been hella worse.

       urlLink Astral Weeks  makes me want to fall in love and roll around grassy hills in the midsummer afternoon with the boy next door. Unfortunately, there is not boy next door, just a woman in her mid thirties and a couple of cats. Regardless, anytime I hear Van Morrison’s voice it momentarily turns my life into a film. Cinematic perfection, birds chirp, skies clear and every man I have ever been smitten by, takes me out for long walks down the shore, complete with cotton candy. Van Morrison has a drastically different affect on me, than say, The Stooges, which, when heard, makes me want to fuck, legs above head, screaming.

Mainstream rock lost its kingpin group, an unlikely one imbued with avant-garde genius, and contemporary rock became harder and meaner, more aggressive and dumbed down and sexist.

He was sincere in his distaste for bullyboy music — always pronouncing his love for queer culture, feminism and the punk rock do-it-yourself ideal.     [ urlLink NYT ]

All I can think of is her with a whore for a girlfriend and that does not please me. You are probably gay.   Listen, if you haven't the balls to ask her then why worry? In the very least she will fuck some dirty bastard and bring you home the hiv. And if you are just being passive on the whole issue to begin with then you are probably pathetic enough to agree that the hiv is not so bad. At least it is accompanied by death.   Of course, you are too big of a girl to kill yourself--so this is one giant passive aggressive party because you found a woman that would treat you poorly, and give you death via her life orifice.   What do you want from me? Ask her if she is letting other men fuck her. You know what--don't even ask her. Just fucking leave her. That way you can get out of that whole mess.   If leaving is too big of a deal kill the bitch, stuff her in a steam trunk and send the remains across the US. I know a friend that would happily keep them in his walk in freezer. His dad is in the MOB.    Sabrina's Vagina  Go give  urlLink Sabrina  some hits and write her vag a little love letter...

       urlLink  While Bush is in the convention center Sept. 2, the Secret Service wants all Amtrak, NJTransit and Long Island Rail Road Service to cease, the Daily News has learned.   The scrum over New York security emerged as officials in Boston revealed they plan to close two transit hubs for a full week, starting three days before the start of the Democratic Convention on July 23.  The worries over the raillines and convention safety come a few weeks after train bombings in Madrid killed 191 people.   [Daily News Via  urlLink Productshopnyc ]  How about, oh I don’t know, lets worry about all the people in attendance at these events that could get injured or perhaps the commuters who rely on trains to get to their jobs, instead of halting transportation just to save those running for president. If the fear here was based solely on saving the lives of citizens, then why, in the wake of Madrid, was Penn Station not closed down, Grand Central locked up? If the commuters have the guts to get on a train everyday, to suspend their fear, then the presidential hopefuls should do the same.

Adding, “I mean people really dig that Will & Grace show.”   In addition to broadening minds, the station is also hoping,  to reach a segment of the population that is desirable to many advertisers because of its more than $400 billion in buying power.

      In my 23 years I have discovered that the two worst things in existence are jealousy and chronic diarrhea. Both of them sneak up on you at the most inopportune moments. After lunch at work, digesting your turkey sandwich, you look over your cube wall and see a tight assed female co-worker, and you get a ping in your stomach, a little envy for those buns of steel. Then on a completely separate plain the farting begins and you have to shit, and there’s cramping and the only bathroom around is public and it’s gonna be loud and it's gonna be smelly. This is what hell looks like, crammed in a bathroom stall, the vision of your coworkers buns dancing in your brain, as you sweat and force those loud wet ones out.

In my inbox today I find,  urlLink HOUSEKEEPER KILLED IN HOME OWNED BY SHAQ . I laughed until I read the acutal article about her death. I kind of feel that my sense of humor has changed, I don't find it so funny anymore that people die. Unless of course a piano has fallen on their head.

      Starbucks Baristas in Midtown are attempting to unionize. They are fighting for more cash, hours and better working conditions. [via  urlLink information underload ]   urlLink  Starbucks workers start at $7.75 an hour and eventually receive raises amounting to merely a few cents. Starbucks has also developed a scheme whereby all Baristas work on a part-time basis and are not guaranteed any amount of hours per week thus making it exceedingly difficult for workers to budget for necessities like rent, utilities, and food.     I agree retail workers deserve more; I support their efforts, though some of the arguments presented in this article were a bit weak.   urlLink  Starbucks workers serve an enormous volume of beverages, many of them extremely hot...    Ahhh, the plight of the Barista. Yes, getting $7.75 sucks, Yes, working an inconsistent schedule sucks, but don't take a job serving coffee and expect not to get burned. It happens.   It's also important to note that employees, in addition to their shit pay, receive tips and those working 20 hours a week or more are eligible for health benefits. It's crap, but it's still better than other  urlLink retail outfits .

      I saw The Shins a million years ago (last Sunday) at the Bowery Ballroom. I have been meaning to write up some highlights, though I never feel I can do live events any justice. I will however, share some fantastic moments with you, including The Shins cover of ‘Holy Diver,’ my successful attempt at hitting on a girl and Moby’s baldhead.  Subject one: The Shins covered  urlLink Dio’s ‘Holy Diver.’  There was a shield involved. It was totally metal. I almost wet my pants. Apart from Dio, The Shins provided some bouncy, smile inducing good times. They played ‘Gone for Good’ and I shed a little tear. Kate developed a massive crush on  urlLink Marty Crandall  and all her gushing made me love him too.   Subject Two: I was checking out the ladies in the crowd to see who was representing back fat in summer ’04. This girl in a tight tank top walked by, mad rolls in my face and I said quietly (I thought) to Kate, “Damn, Sistah.” The girl totally heard me. She turned and smiled. We went home together, not really. I just blushed and buried my face in Kate’s armpit.   Subject Three: As I was exiting the ballroom, my eyes caught hold of  urlLink Moby’s baldhead . He was deep in conversation. Moby is funny. I couldn’t stop laughing.

      I’m listening to a little  urlLink Melissa Auf De Muer  via  urlLink Radio 1 . She's acoustic. I'm not really sure how I feel about it, apart from feeling like I’m not really interested. I read in Blender that she likes horses, a lot. That’s kinda cool. I also read that people call her “Fire Bush.”   Randall’s Island Lollapalooza dates have been announced (8/16-8/17) and  urlLink tickets  go on sale Friday morning. I still can't believe how fucking amazing day one is. (A little reminder: Morrissey, Sonic Youth, PJ Harvey, Le Tigre, Modest Mouse, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, Von Bondies, The Walkmen.) I’m sayin’ bring that August Heat!  In other related PJ Harvey news,  urlLink Productshop NYC  has a little picture of Polly Jean’s new album cover.  urlLink Melody Nelson  has a bigger pic of the album cover and a link to the video for ‘The Letter’.  It’s a sexy video, almost as sexy as the 99 Problems video and PJ has new Karen O like hair (which just means it’s short and brown and bangs are involved).   Obviously, nothing has changed with my site. After hours of playing around with the html I couldn't get things to do what I wanted them to do. For the time being I have reverted back to the old jellyfish template. It's a good template.

      Cast off those sweatshirts, sweaters and baggy t-shirts my ladies! Back Fat is sooo in for summer 2004. After attempting to purchase summer shirts this weekend and spending numerous tear soaked hours in front of a mirror, I realized there is nothing I can do to hide the two tits I have hanging off my back. (Though I did consider surgically implanting nipples on them.) And I’m tired of looking like a  urlLink sweaty ageing fanboy  in the summer, so I’m casting off the man sized band t-shirts for cap sleeves, tank tops and glorious rolls. Yeah maybe this trend will never hit Cosmo or Vogue, and Jessica Simpson will surely never plump that back up, but who the fuck needs to look like that slut, when you can chub out Kelly Osbourne style and still look  urlLink cute  ( urlLink sometimes ).

      I work for  urlLink The United Way , a non-profit that raises money and finds volunteers for other community based non-profits. Normally there is not much to blog about my job, hence the reason I am able to blog. However, today we received this piece of hate mail criticizing our organization for being a “Policestate.” (At least that’s what I got out of it.)

My bet is on the veteran, but I suppose I will never know.   For those of you who can’t quite grasp the uh…“reasoning” behind the letter, here is a little run down on  GLOBAL OVERLORDS .    urlLink  Fascinated by symbolism and numerology, the globalists' favorite tactic is to leave blueprints to their plans "hidden in plain view."

       urlLink Lollapalooza has been canceled.  I really don't get it, what part of $50 bucks to see Morrissy, Sonic Youth, PJ Harvey, the fucking Pixies and Modest Mouse did people not understand. Bastards. Maybe this will all be a cruel joke, like when Ashton Kutcher said Punk'd was over. Except I was kinda glad when that happened and not glad that this happened.

      If  urlLink Lloyd Dobbler  was standing outside my window right now, radio above head, he would be playing “ urlLink Clark Gable .” Though seeing as this is reality and not a Cameron Crowe film, I am left to fend off my desire to romanticize about everything outside of myself. If anything I figured out one thing, my ideal man is definitely a combination of  urlLink Bukowski  and Dobbler. Which means I am really into eternally conflicted alcoholics. Something about Bukowski is just so hot though, perhaps it is the overt misogyny, the talk of sleeping up against a woman’s ass. There is an obvious celebration of detachment in fantasying about fucking someone so far from everything I actually believe in. But there is also detachment in dreaming of the unrealistic wide eyed romanticism that Dobbler presents. It’s the night in shining armor syndrome. I am still waiting to be saved by a kid with a boom box or willingly used by an abusive addict. It’s this dream of “true romance” that I thought I was impervious to, but have somehow become obsessed with. It makes me cringe. I use to sob over being alone, now I just get frustrated, annoyed that I am still looking beyond everything I have, wishing I had someone to take summer bike rides with. Why is romance with others so alluring, yet romance with the self so difficult?

      Last night I went to one of those parties that I never attended in High School. It was a sausage fest, filled with guys in tan cargo shorts, dropping “homo” jokes and playing beer pong. I was neither drunk nor horny, but to keep up my schtick as a drunk horny slut, I madeout with this kid in a Polo shirt who has a small thing for Moby. His taste, less than sexy, his body, nicely crafted. He was standing with a group of girls and as I approached them he asked, “So uh, who wants to have sex?” I totally raised my hand and he went in the house. I didn’t follow; he eventually came outside again and tried to make small talk with me. “So uh…where do you go to school? (Graduated New School, obvs.) “Uh…like where’s that?” Painful conversation. I told him he should have sex with this other drunk horny slut at the party (she was actually both drunk and horny). “Nah,” he said, “I only want to have sex with you.” To which I replied, “aww your such a sweetheart, but I don’t’ think you’re that selective.”   We decided to just makeout and ended up fondling each other on a futon (less than hot). He undid my belt and I stopped him. He used the, “It doesn’t mean we have to have sex” argument. I debated it and then thought about some  urlLink recent   urlLink discussions  I’ve been having. I knew if I continued, the night would've ended with some awkward panting, a lack of orgasm on my end and perhaps an STD. I politely declined and told him, “I know my limits, I hate giving handjobs, so that just leads to blowjobs and blowjobs get boring so that leads to sex.” I put my sweater back on and apologized for leaving him.   As I walked back to the party I gave my mouth one of those exaggerated “I just gave a bj” wipes. His boys loved it and my street cred was saved.

      It's always embarrassing to start a blog (especially when it’s a hot trend). It takes a little pushing and a little shoving and then you don't know what to write about and you think it's all just stupid (which it probably is) but you forge ahead anyway and then ask all your friends to start blogs because you don't want to be the only asshole in your social circle talking about this shit like a technerd. Then your friends start blogs and their first posts are about how lame blogging is and how much they think it's dumb but they persist and more kids cave in. Soon enough every friendster you’ve ever had now miraculously has their own blog. And now you can go to bed content knowing you are a cliché.    The Moral: Peer pressure is still hot in 2004!   With that said, Jeremy has a blog now,  urlLink Taffypull  and Kim has one in the works,  urlLink Birfday Girl  (Well not just yet, I’ll get on her next. Brian? Flower?).

      In 6th grade Danny Kennedy told me he didn’t believe in God, he told me he was an atheist. I thought he was a heathen. So I did what any right-minded Christian would do.

The next day I tucked the Bible into Danny’s cubby with an inscription that read, “Jesus loves you.” He found the book and laughed.

He added: "At this point, we have no leads."   The report states the missing thongs and panties were all "Body By Victoria" style, which is known for a more comfortable fit while still being sexy, according to the Victoria`s Secret catalog. There are several lines of panties, including low rise, hipster, bikini and thong, and they are subdued in color. The stolen panties had been stored in four bins below a table at the front of the store.

      What the fuck has happened to me? Four fucking months ago I was at the ex-boyfriend’s house for pizza night, now I’m spending my weekends drinking way way way too much tequila and showing Kim my tits. (Kim thanks for showing me your tits in return and uh…sorry I put my tongue in your boyfriend’s ear.) I’m an idiot, even when I’m not drunk I’m still being an idiot. And I have apparently come down with a severe case of brutal honesty, that at times doesn’t go over so well. I’m an idiot. Please bow your collective heads in shame when you see me again.   And now a public apology to further embarrass myself…  Mike – I’m sorry for punching you in the balls and landing a hot fart on your face and for putting my tongue in your ear, twice.  Mark – I’m sorry for reading  urlLink your t-shirt  back to you 1,000 times through a drunken slurred lisp.     urlLink Shoprite/stock boy/Dan/Tom  – I’m sorry I didn’t take my panties off for you, but hon that hemp necklace ain’t gonna get you any of my fine pussy. Please stop calling me.   urlLink Jeremy  – I’m sorry for pretty much everything I’ve said to you in the past 48 hours, apart from my comments on your Jackson joke, that shit still needs work.    urlLink Marc  – I’m sorry for being ridiculously shitfaced every time I meet your wife.  Kate – Remember when you spilled that beer on your arm, I’m sorry for licking your wrist instead of getting you a towel. I’m also sorry that I didn’t grab your rack as much as I grabbed Kim’s. (What is it about her tight ass that turns me into a dirty old man?) And for the hugging, I know you need your personal space and I tend to invade it, often.   Kim – My apologies are above. I’ll try to keep my hands off your perfect ass and luscious tits from now on.   Rich – For the tongue in the ear, twice, and molesting your girlfriend. You’re a good sport, Champ. (I need to start calling people Champ more often. Genius.)   Brian – I’m sorry for that drunk dial. When I said I hope you die, I didn’t really mean it. When I said I wanted to fuck you, I totally meant it.   Love,    Your favorite drunken horny slut.

      Sophomore year of high school Melissa was a self proclaimed “indie rock goddess.” She shaved her head, dotted her “I”s with “X”s, spun  urlLink Jackpot  incessantly and was invited to join her first and last band, ever. Her friends  urlLink Emily  (mLe) and Katie (k8e) were searching for a drummer for their yet unnamed female rock n’ roll outfit. The three ladies eventually called themselves The Flirttarts. It was a short, but brutal affair; the band was rife with lesbian drama, Heavens to Betsy covers and riot grrrl posturing. This is their story.  Soon after Melissa joined the group, Katie was “kicked out” after missing a few practices due to her underage drinking problem and “other friends.” Emily and Melissa made a halfhearted attempt to find a new bassist. They crafted a sign out of notebook paper and black sharpie for the local supermarket:   “Riot Grrrls looking for grrrl who enjoys ovary centric rock and Bikini Kill to play bass in go nowhere band. Grrrl Power!”  No one called. They continued on as a two-piece operation.   The remaining Tarts practiced endlessly in Melissa’s attic, recording songs into her alarm clock/radio/bootleg-taping device. They bickered over the spelling of their name (Emily wanted one “t” in flirttarts, Melissa wanted two) and “the direction” the band was heading. Melissa had always secretly wanted to be in a joke band, (and still secretly desires it) but Emily was a bit more serious. She wanted to sing about “real issues,” like rape and stuff.    The Tarts managed to play in public only once, at a VFW in Redbank NJ. They were last on the bill and by the time they set up their shoddy operation, everyone had left, even the kid who had showed Melissa his nipple rings earlier in the evening.   The Tarts massacred “Ax Man,” sloppily made it through one of their own jams and decided to end their three-song set with a handcrafted ditty about masturbation, sung off key and with a tambourine. It was obviously Melissa’s idea, and it was obviously awful. The Flirttarts broke up soon after. Emily went off to  urlLink Lang  to study hipsterdom in the big city and Melissa cast aside her Converse for Birkenstocks, Junior year and way too much Ani Difranco.   Posthumously The Flirttarts were included on a DIY compilation tape, Quean Scream, manufactured out of some girl’s bedroom in San Pablo, California. (Copies are still available, all interested parties please inquire in the comments section.) Currently, Emily is unemployed and living in Queens making art, Melissa is a wage slave and avid alcoholic with a nice rack.   This post inspired by  urlLink essen west .

        urlLink     I watched  urlLink Amish in the City  last night, I’m not quite sure why, but I did. Now I’m a little obsessed with things Amish. I’ve been talking about the show a lot day. I’m totally sold. If UPN made little Amish action figures I would probably buy one and if they sold them in  urlLink Urban Outfitters , the rest of my generation would as well.  As for the cast I could care less about the “city kids” that were recruited for the show; (with the exception of  urlLink Whitney  and her awesome ass) it’s all about Amish  urlLink Miriam . She’s all like, hot, open-minded and her only fault is that she once dated the soon to be gay Amish cast member  urlLink Randy . Miriam is my favorite Amish television star ever, way better than  urlLink that guy  from  urlLink Little House On The Prairie  who wasn’t even Amish but looked like it. Though I have to give a nod to Amish  urlLink Ruth  too, I liked the herpes sore she was sportin’ on her lip.

        urlLink     George was seen most often lumbering through the halls of Dunellen High School in too small sweatpants, white socks and black on black sneakers. He was best known for his role-playing skills. He was the dopest spell caster in all of Middlesex County.   G  urlLink worked hard on his craft , developing it during lunch, over a tray of cheese steaks and tots, laboring on into chemistry. Occasionally he would break from his wizardry to play  urlLink Magic  down at the  urlLink local comic book store  or take time out to catch Skully bagging some aliens on  urlLink The X Files .   He usually carried around a copy of The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy and spent time prophesizing about the demise of the human race while constructing the school's website.   George slayed math equations like a motherfucker and owned a working  urlLink Magnavox Odyssey 100 , which made him quite popular with the other barbarian  urlLink minotaurs  and  urlLink illusionist  gnomes in his D&amp;D circle.   His greatest achievement in DHS was received senior year when he was voted “tallest” in the class for the yearbook superlatives .

      Usually (that is when I remember) to actually look into a “my friend’s band” it is less than interesting. Most of the time I end up listening to suburban NJ  urlLink Drive Thru  hopefuls or nu metal. I can handle the  urlLink nu metal (in a kind of ironic detached way). But I can handle  urlLink Sara’s  friend’s band a lot more. Seek out  urlLink The Teenage Prayers  and at least down load “Don’t Apologize.” I hear a little Lou Reed, but I could be totally wrong. Yet, for once I can say I am not whole-heartedly disappointed.   In other “my friend’s band” news, I am going to see  urlLink Decoy , ( urlLink Marc’s  brothers band) at  urlLink Hamilton St.  tonight. Shit's gonna be crazy. I’ll probably be the oldest fucker there.

      Went to  urlLink Coney Island  on Saturday with some of  urlLink the   urlLink kids . It was sweaty.  urlLink The Fiery Furnaces  played like lighting, ripping through such hot tracks as “My Dog Was Lost But Now He’s Found” and “some things off Gallowsbird’s Bark that I don’t remember now.” Eleanor wore yellow pants. We left near the end of the set to catch  urlLink The Thermals . They were insane. I left the kids in the back to move up and look for some action, there wasn’t any. No dancing, jumping or fist throwing. I attempted to shake it a little, but wasn't feeling it. Lame. I got bored and moved back. That was the last band I saw. The rest of the day was spent scanning the crowd for my first husband, watching Kate, Sara, Mark and Jeremy drink gigantic paper cups of beer and waiting in line to pee. An attempt was made to see Blonde Redhead but we got trapped in the crowd and ended up watching hipsters climb a barbed wire fence instead. I saw panties, I probably should have seen more music.

      I seriously feel like I am going to throw up, a lot. My brother-in-law gave me a piece of shrimp to taste tonight. It was one of those, “this doesn’t seem right, eat it” situations. I ate it. I regret it. I’m sure I’m fine though. It was only one shrimp…   On to less pressing matters, the job is picking up and I haven’t been able to obsessively check on all my favorite sites lately. (Sometimes I miss being an intern, that is until I get my paycheck.) It’s a shame, so I’ve gone through some blog archives from the past week or so and picked out things I probably would have posted on had I had time to read anything apart from training manuals on developing effective volunteer opportunities to aid local non-profit agencies.    urlLink The Real Janelle  (one of my favorite blogs ever) brought this  urlLink Uncle Jesse hotness ! If you know me, than you know how much I am all about Full House, so you know how much I squealed when I found this. Sooo brill!  What Would Uncle Jesse Do?

[via productshop nyc]  Yeah you definitely cannot get the mp3 from  urlLink Telephone Thing  anymore, but find M.I.A’s “fire, fire” somewhere else ( urlLink like her website ) and download like crazy.   Continuing on the mp3j bandwagon, grab  urlLink Sons & Daughters  “awkward duet” from  urlLink Vague Space . This is probably my favorite song of the present moment. I wish my descriptive vocabulary contained more words than “awesome” and “cool,” so I could write something sentimental and moving about this song, but I can’t. I will say I prefer to listen to it in a darkened room. [ urlLink Kate  you’ll love it, but in a way where you will actually love it and not hate it. Re: The time I burned you Joanna Newsom and you tried to kill me with your death stare.]  My sister voted for Perot in ’92. I’m watching  urlLink I Love the 90’s . And I do love the 90’s, though I would like it a lot more with a little less Hal Sparks, like maybe none at all. I’m barely funny most of the time and I am quite annoying the rest time but Hal Sparks has got to be way fucking worse than me. I would only hope, otherwise I’m packing it in and heading back to the convent. Viva la celibacy!  What?

        urlLink     My favorite movie when I was younger was  urlLink Where Did I Come From . It was this educational video for children, explaining to them the ins and outs of coitus, conception and child birth. My mother let me rent it constantly from the local West Coast Video. I really liked it because it had cartoon boobs and a penis in it. My favorite scene took place in the bathtub. While the “mommy” and “daddy” were bathing, the narrator,  urlLink Howie Mandel  , explained the different body parts. Sometimes I would pause the tape and just stare at the “mommy’s” rack, fascinated. Maybe I was jealous of her large perky cartoon tits, maybe I was shocked that she actually had nipples (none of my Barbie’s did) or maybe I just wanted to suckle them. I don’t really remember, I just know I was obsessed.  In another great scene all these little blue sperm are racing toward an egg with big eyelashes and sexy fuck me heels (she looked kinda like  urlLink Ms. Pac-Man  but white and without the bow). It was a tough race, there was some trash talking but eventually one of the little bastards prevailed. The winning sperm threw on a top hat and escorted the egg away from the pool to make a baby. Before I went on the pill, this was my nightmare. I’d wake up in a cold sweat usually naked after a night of slutting around* and see that smug little fucker in his top hat taunting me, trying to take my eggs. I still hate him, but I still love porn.    *or having monogamous sex with my college boyfriend.

      Even Slate hates King Arthur....   urlLink He fights against his own people because he considers Rome the fount of democracy, religious tolerance, and the credo that men (and women) control their own destinies. Given the bloody repression practiced by Rome at the time, this is moronic, but Arthur is not presented as a moron, merely a soldier who is a tad out of touch—as much of a bleeding-heart liberal-humanist as a man who has lopped off thousands of insurgents' limbs can be.   ...  urlLink King Arthur is profoundly stupid and inept, but it's an endless source of giggles once you realize that its historical revisionism has nothing to do with archeological discoveries and everything to do with the fact that no one at Disney would green-light an old-fashioned talky love triangle with a hero who dies and an adulterous heroine who ends up in a nunnery.

      Man I really love a good epic battle movie, I love them so much that I went to see  urlLink King Arthur  last night.   Now melodrama is welcome, in fact it’s needed in films like this, but sometimes it can kill a potentially good scene. Bruckheimer is a pro at doing this through overusing special effects. Worst ever is this battle scene on ice, the Knights (good guys) are banking on the  Saxons’s (bad guys) ignorance. The ice beneath the enemy’s feet is going to give. The tension builds, the armies move in, there are all these cool arrows swooshing through air noises and then…  … long computerized close-ups of ice cracking. CRAP! Where did the characters go? I want to see some fucking struggle, some action, some swords clanking, not a bunch of Vikings falling to a cold watery death. Damn you Bruckheimer for raping me at the box office once again! (and Pirates was so good, so good!)  I know epic battle movies are based on these ridiculous effects, I go there hoping for it, I just don’t want to be reminded during the film. Some of the effects employed in the Lord of The Rings trilogy were effing awful, but Jackson always seemed to pull them off by distracting me with an affinity for the characters. Even Zwik managed to draw me in with his fancy Cruise driven  urlLink Last Samurai . But King Arthur, I say eh.   On the positive side, some of the battles, especially those with fire, were awesome,  urlLink Keira Knightly  was steller as Guinevere (though that’s probably because I like to see a woman with battle blood on her face),  urlLink Sir Lancelot  could easily replace a  urlLink Stroke  if needed and although King Arthur himself left much to be desired, the hottie with the bird (Mads Mikkelsen) was everything an epic battle hero should be, sexy and dirty. I leave you with his photo…   urlLink

Luckily, the NYP, by way of  urlLink whatevs , has announced that the BGW videos are in production.   urlLink With his latest release, "Girls Gone Wild" mogul Joe Francis is hoping to cash in on a new cultural phenomenon: the full monty.   "Since the birth of 'Girls Gone Wild' seven years ago, people have been asking 'Why isn't there a ''Guys Gone Wild?,"''' Francis told The Post.   "While I've always realized there is a market for 'Guys Gone Wild,' I just couldn't bring myself to sit and edit footage of naked guys. No offense. Luckily, over the past year I've hired a team that I trust to produce, market and distribute this product from beginning to end."    All I can say is, Thank God.

       urlLink    Ivory's a champ.  Body Glitter exists because of one woman. That woman is Ivory. We worked at Girl Scout camp together years ago. Last January when I was up there for a reunion, I found out, through a mutual coworker, that  urlLink Ivory had a live journal . I wouldn’t say reading it was a life altering experience, but it did convince me to start this blog.   Last weekend while at camp again (or more like visiting the bar near camp), I ran into Ivory and thanked her for the inspiration, we did some shots and I got tanked. Before I got tanked though, Ivory managed to deliver the best quote I’ve ever heard.   I had moved our conversation from blogs into talk of Dungeons and Dragons. (I want to know how to craft a character sheet. It’s a really dope skill to have.)  Occasionally Ivory plays D&D with her boyfriend, though she gets annoyed when they play together. She continued on to explain the root of her dissatisfaction and inadvertently dropped the best quote ever,   “My boyfriend never lets me be Dungeon Master.”   Fucking genius. I know my delivery was shit but it’s a brilliant quote anyway. I just hope this grievance doesn’t lead to a break up.   Ivory + her boyfriend, whose name I don’t know = T.L.F.

      In the past 6 days I have been pulled over 3 times. Last Thursday I noticed that my front headlight was out on my car. I had been meaning to take it in for servicing anyway, so I called my favorite mechanic Neil, who wears the most boss Velcro shoes, to make an appointment. I got the machine. The answer phone told me Neil was on vacation until Monday. He was probably off with the wife and kids having a grand time. I let it go.     First Offense:  Friday night while making a trek to  urlLink Magnolia  with  urlLink Kim ,  urlLink Kate  and  urlLink Jeremy , I was pulled over for speeding. The cop gave me a ticket for my burned out headlight and advised me to “slow it down.” I thanked him and continued on.   Second Offense:  I called Neil on Monday as planned and made an appointment to bring my car in on Wednesday morning. I never do anything in the morning that requires getting up before 8:20, so I made arrangements to drop my vehicle off Tuesday night after Sons & Daughters.  urlLink Sara  would follow me to the  urlLink mechanic .   Tuesday on my way there, driving exactly, if not below the posted speed limit, I was pulled over again. I waited for a while until the cop decided to approach my vehicle. He eventually sauntered up to the car, passed my window and checked my headlights. I watched him through the windshield as he examined the single beam of light. There was obviously no need for this show; he knew the light was out, I knew the light was out; I just wanted to get to it. He broke the silence with the usual line, “Do you know why I pulled you over?” I shot him an authoritative “yes” and explained my situation gesturing toward Sara sitting in her car in a nearby parking lot.   Like a jealous lover, he asked me where I had been. I lied and told him I was coming from my friend’s house, forgetting I was wearing a yellow, as he called it, “club” bracelet. I remained calmed and played it off like the “club” I had been to meant nothing to me. In a monotone voice I said, “oh yeah I went to a show.” I knew what he was getting at with these questions though, so I added, “but I wasn’t drinking.”   My answers satisfied him and he took my license and registration back to his cruiser for a good time. He found nothing incriminating on my record and told me I was free to go. I dropped my car off as planned and Sara gave me a lift home.    Third Offense:   During this minor car crisis my sister graciously loaned me her vehicle to ensure that I would have transportation. While driving her car I was pulled over a third time. It was no longer funny, I was definitely cursing. I knew I was not speeding; I had stopped all speeding Friday.   I was still rifling through my sister’s glove compartment, looking for her insurance card when the cop came to the window and delivered the standard line. This time I had no idea what I was stopped for. Apparently, my sister had failed to renew her registration.  Great.   The cop asked me if my record was clean and I told him yes, I figured if it wasn’t I would’ve been issued a ticket during my last incident. He collected the nesscary idetification and went to his vehicle.    After running my information he came back to the car, cocky, puffed up with power and said, like, the dick that he was, “your record isn’t clean, you have two points.” I tried to defend myself saying, “I forgot about them”, adding, “they are from a long time ago. He cut me off, “well I’m not gonna lecture you.” He then launched into a diatribe on checking the paperwork in a car before borrowing it, closing with, “I’m not going to give you a ticket but tell whoever this car belongs to, to renew the registration.” The guy was still a fucker.   Obviously this all could have been worse if I was issued three tickets, luckily I wasn’t. This whole saga was mostly funny, until it got old and not so funny anymore. As of right now I haven’t been pulled over since Wednesday. But I’ll keep you posted.

      I want to try to avoid using the word awesome when writing about Sons & Daughters @  urlLink Northsix  last night. I don’t think I can resist it though, it was awesome. Normally when I go to see a band I don’t know that well, I get bored, stare off into space and dream about my future ex-husbands. S&D, however, did not allow me to indulge in such behavior, I was mesmerized by their stage presence and their effing great tunes.  I missed S&D when they opened for Franz Ferdinand a few months back (because I didn’t attend those shows), so all I had to go on was a song from  urlLink Vague Space  and a few mp3 clips from  urlLink their website . I thought I would be in for a night of slow but charming folk. I was not, however, prepared to shake it so much. Every song was a hoe down, I wanted to grab a partner and circle round. (The square dance is coming back by the way, Body Glitter proclaimed this first. And it will totally happen because it would be both fun and ironic. See  urlLink Karaoke resurgence .)   Sons & Daughters played steady, dropping tracks like “Johnny Cash” on the crowd and coming back encore style with “Awkward Duet.” I was very satisfied and have since hunted down and purchased  urlLink Love the Cup .   Hey  urlLink RIAA  if you missed that FREE MP3s led to both TICKET and ALBUM sales, ya bastards.  [ed note: Sara attended this show with me, her fine review is  urlLink here . enjoy.]

       but not as hard as TWINKS!   Breaking news...The Turtle Singer (Karen Buckley) will be bringing both her love of turtles and music to the 2004  urlLink Somerset County 4-H Fair . Attendants of the performance will have a chance to meet the singers three turtles: Rocky, Gracie and Big Black Bart.    urlLink  A resident of Cape May County, Ms. Buckley has written 50 songs in all kinds of styles about turtles and has performed at 163 events.  Her shows have been conducted for people of all ages at schools, parks, nature centers, churches, conferences, birthday parties, restaurants, assisted living centers, fairs, street malls and festivals.    So maybe this “Turtle Singer” has played more places than Martha’s band TWINKS. (Who can say for sure though, this Buckley and her press monkeys might be a bunch of trite scoundrels fabricating the “news.”)   What I do know is that TWINKS (the best band ever on the face of the earth) will be playing  urlLink Bazookas  in Bridgewater tomorrow (unofficially of course) anytime between 12:30 and 1:30. It’s free and all ages so be there. The show will last approximately 7 minutes; Martha will be signing autographs afterward.
