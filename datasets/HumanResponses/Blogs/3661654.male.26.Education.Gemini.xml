      Pt.6c - A Close Call and a Cleaning Closet  It was a bit of a bizarre story, hearing this the next day over burgers in our attempt to regain complete normality.  It was about 1:00pm on the Saturday.  Me and the boyz who had gone to the capsule had slept for our five hours.  The Spa Boyz were still making their way from Spa World to Umeda Station to pick up their bags and then to rendezvous with us in the Shinsaibashi (The section where America-mura is in) area again.  But in the meantime, we had just met up with Robin and Nate and were listening to the brief, but humorous account of their slight brush with death and sleeping arrangement mishap.  	Remember, Robin and Nate were the last ones standing the light before, refusing to go find shelter for a few hours of sleep with the rest of us after leaving the “Inferno.”  My initial interpretation of their stubbornness seemed to be accurate.  They only stayed out because it felt good to be able to last longer than the rest of us.    Though whether or not they actually did have the most stamina still could be argued.  I for one could say that I COULD’VE stayed out longer had I really wanted to.  I could say that I only went to bed because we had another night of debauchery to look forward to.  However, they might’ve retorted that they also had the next night to look forward to but didn’t need as much sleep to make it through as we seemed to need.  A back and forth argument that ultimately would’ve led to nowhere if we had it, I’m sure.    So, it sounded like it wasn’t really worth staying out until 11:00am for them.  It was for me because it provided me with this amusing anecdote to share.  Apparently, after we left the “Inferno” around 8:00 or 9:00am and parted ways, Robin and Nate headed back towards America-mura looking for the “right spot.”  They never really found one.  They stopped into a pub that was actually opened, but apparently only managed a couple of beers while staring dumbly at the floor or the walls.  Then, they finally decided that it was pointless to stay up any longer.  They were past the point of increasing their level of ‘wastedness.’    You know when you slowly get drunk (not all at once, but a nice constant build up) until you reach a peak of silliness, but you are at a club or surrounded by friends and don’t really notice the true extent of your ‘wastedness.’  And then time starts passing by faster.  You are still drinking but your drinking of drinks and the passing of time seem to coincide with each other.  You maintain your level of drunkenness despite the hours passing.  Others with you are on your same level.  Others have not managed to maintain that synchronization between the passing of time and the number of drinks.  Some have been drinking far too fast resulting in unconsciousness, tummy troubles, or at the very least, becoming an annoyance.  Others have let the time pass by wastefully.  They don’t keep up with time and all too quickly sober up, thereby negating the effect of the previous drinks.  In a sense, a waste of alcoholic resources.    It is my belief that this synchronization is the ideal situation for a night of revelry if your goal is to make it last as long and pleasantly as possible.  As long as you don’t get too drunk, you don’t get sick or tired to quickly.  As long as you keep up with the passing of time, you stay energetic and max out the enjoyment of any given situation.  There would be no chance of becoming bored.  However, even the perfect balance of alcohol and time has its limits.  You know you’ve reached that limit, usually in the wee hours of the morning, when you find yourself still drinking but it no longer has any effect on you.  Other symptoms are:  exhaustion - due to the fact that you have been dancing/running around all night but the alcohol disguised the strain it has on your body; a coma-like stupor – you no longer respond as normal to people and other stimuli around you (i.e.:  laughing at joke that was told 2 minutes prior, someone spills a beer on you and you look up to see if it has indeed started raining, etc.); impatience – the party’s over, you are well aware of it, there’s nothing left to look forward to, but damn it, we just gotta get out of here.    At this point, most are looking forward to a bed, a pillow, a warm room, or at the very least, the opportunity to just lay down and close their eyes.  Some still doggedly plod on, but the only thing that is going to give them a 2nd wind at this point is either drugs (uppers), or some very extraordinaire, all of a sudden stimulus to get the blood pounding again.     It was this kind of stimulus that kept Robin and Nate up until about 3:00 the next afternoon and provided me an anecdote for this chapter of the story and an excuse to babble on about my perceived levels of drunkenness.  The anecdotes are brief, but if you could put yourself in their shoes, you might be able to grasp the seriousness of the occurrences and thereby justify the length of this chapter.    So, perhaps around 11:00am, Robin and Nate were looking for a place to stay; for free, highly preferred.  So, regular hotels were out of the question, business hotels and Love Hotels were not to be found in the immediate area, most Capsule hotels would not be admitting any new patrons until after 3:00pm, and they were not aware of our special deal at the particular location I was at.  So what were they going to do?  Nothing but wonder around aimlessly by the sounds of it.  They eventually came across a small alleyway and something possessed Robin to wander down it out of curiosity’s sake.  They found what they called a “Cleaning Closet.”  To this day, I’m still not certain exactly what kind of shack this actually was, but they described it as a small closet-like shed, attached to the outside of the backside of a building, crowded with cleaning supplies and trolleys, and very dark.  This seemed to be their best and only hope of a place to stay for a few hours.  I can only guess at what it actually would’ve been like in there:  What it looked like inside, what it smelled like, how much room they had to layout in, what else lurked in the dark recesses of its confines.  But to hear them talk about it; how they were attempting to sleep for at least 2 hours in a ‘cleaning closet’ in the middle of the day, no doubt in use by janitors or street cleaners, how desperate their situation and finally how rash their decision, it makes for a very amusing mental picture.    So there they were, in the cleaning closet, minding their own business, trying to get some asleep, when along came some footsteps down the alley towards them.  Robin didn’t remember seeing any other doorways or structures in their alley so they assumed whoever it was was coming to their closet.  Was it a janitor, a policeman, a bum?  They didn’t know, but for some reason, they were very very nervous.  Even in the worst-case scenario, if they were found in a public (?) ‘cleaning closet’, perhaps someone would yelled at them in Japanese, “Get out of here you crazy, drunken, foreign punks,” and that would’ve been the end of it.  Nate and Robin however, seemed to be thinking that they were committing some sort of crime punishable by a jail term, deportation, or death by the sword.  In a panic, they hid themselves behind jugs of cleaner and a bunch of mops and held their breath while awaiting their fate…   In the end, however, nothing happened.  I suppose they were well hidden despite the ludicrousness of the situation.  Someone stepped in the shack for a few seconds and disappeared.  Nate and Robin, not wanting to spend life-sentences in a Japanese prison ran out of the shack and decided against sleep until the afternoon when they could check into a capsule hotel.  Finally hungry again after 6 hours on drugs and another 4 hours since they had last eaten, they decided to head to the McDonalds near Triangle Park as it would have been one of the few things open at that point in the morning.   I don’t know exactly where they were coming from but they path to McDonalds included walking through some of the incredible narrow side-streets, usually jam packed with bicycles, barely allowing enough room for walkers or cyclists to pass through.  As they walked, they suddenly began hearing tires squealing and a loud, obnoxious horn blaring at irregular but frequent intervals.  It sounded as though a car was tearing its way through America-mura, which is never a good idea.  The area was way too crowded with people, bicycles and street vendors to move at a pace faster than 15km/h. It was a good place for the snobby young adults with ridiculously suped-up cars to show off their vehicles without being too obvious.  They had no choice but to casually mosey through the crowded streets.  It is between 6:00am and 11:00am that the streets are at their least crowded, but high speeds through there is never a good idea.  At first it seemed so far away and they didn’t think anything about it as they casually chatted while making their way towards their Big Macs.  All of a sudden, the car making all the noise was appeared at the corner of the street they were walking on.  It made a sudden, violent turn (with much more squealing of course) to begin its surge down their street.  At first, Robin and Nate stood dumbly, staring straight ahead, confused at the possibility that anybody could possibly need to move that fast at such an early hour of the morning.  Then it became apparent that the car was heading straight for them, it was accelerating while knocking a few bikes over in the process, and finally that their lives could possibly be in danger.  Robin quickly eased himself over to the side of the nearest building but Nate didn’t react until it was almost too late.  He threw himself onto the tiny sidewalk less than milliseconds before the car whizzed by.    Again I wonder how “whizzing” is possible in America-mura.  I never seen anything whiz through in all my time spent there, and if it wasn’t obvious before, it sure was after hearing this story.  Nate was literally a millimeter away from being sideswiped by a large, suped-up family sedan despite being in plain view, and on a road not big enough for any vehicle with a motor.  The shock was delayed, but it came on big time.  The fact that Nate had a possible near-death experience and perhaps was still watching his life flash before his eyes was obvious to me about 2 hours later while we were having lunch together in a burger joint in the early afternoon on the Saturday.  Perhaps the heaviness of the situation has been exaggerated in this account of it.  But in all honesty, this is how Nate and Robin perceived it and so this is how I relay it to you.

      Pt 6b:  Capsule Allegories   	The less adventurous of the group were heading back to the Capsule Hotel with the hope of being able to take advantage of an option that may or may not have existed.  Me and Wes deduced desperately that the jumble of Kanji we pretended we could read on the sign outside of the hotel earlier that day, aside from your basic spend-the-night-and-enjoy-the-onsen deal, that you could sleep for a maximum of 5 hours anytime of the day, pay a slightly cheaper price, but not have access to the onsen as it would be closed for cleaning. 　Fortunately, we were right in our assessment of the strange Kanji characters and we got a semi-descent 5-hour sleep that morning.    On the way there, Wes, initially, was making the most noise, as was the norm for him after consuming extreme amounts of a beer and whiskey mix.  Fortunately, Wes’ banter never lasted long because shooting his mouth off always indicated his inevitable decline into unconsciousness.  Friday night was no exception as after no more than 10 minutes into our walk he was barely able to lift his feet, let alone keep his mouth open.  Greg and Chris were merely drowsy.  Both cool cats almost always avoided drugs and were excellent at maintaining their alcohol threshold to a constant that allowed them to relax enough to dance, pose, and flirt, while not doing anything to look foolish, overly loud or boisterous.  I’d never known them to run their mouths, trip over their own feet, or pass out in inconvenient spots, but that’s just me.  Both experts at maintaining dignity, but perhaps sometimes overly concerned about their “cool” appearance to others.  Of course, that is just a guess at what could be.  But as for Chris and Greg in particular, I did not know them well enough to say if that generalization applied to them or not.  Ernie and I were chatting idly together (granted kinda in slow-mo due to remaining effects of a psychedelic) so as to make the walk back to America-mura and the Capsule hotel faster and less painful.    	Then Ernie made the slight mistake of asking me what I thought about Capsule hotels.  One might think it was a harmless question, but directed to me at that point in time and state of mind, it opened a floodgate of information that many would not have had the patience to bear.  I told him that they (capsule hotels) were quite convenient but that were the perfect allegory of the Japanese “Salariman”, and more broadly speaking, the remnants of Japanese sexism.  Ernie was only encouraging me to bore them all with an abundance of University textbook regurgitation when he asked me what I meant.  Fortunately, one of Ernie’s great qualities was that he was an excellent ear when it had to do with extraneous facts and anecdotes.  Considering that this entire piece of writing (call it story, composition, funny anecdote, e-mail, a waste of time, etc.) is fairly extraneous in itself, I am nevertheless endeavoring to make it somewhat informative; partly for interests sake, partly as an exercise for my mind in an attempt to recall that which I spent about twelve thousand dollars on to learn.  Therefore, here is the gist of what Ernie heard:  	Speaking of most First World countries, statistics show that Japanese women occupy a far lower percentage of the “White-collar” jobs in their native country when compared to their North American and European counterparts.  (Lucky for you, I don’t have the numbers with me as I write this, so you escape certain boredom with factual statistics.  In the meantime, you’ll just have to take my word for it.)  Of course, it’s not because of the political or legal structures of Japan.  Japanese women are legally guaranteed equal rights to jobs, wages, enfranchisement, civil rights, etc, as the men.  However, compared to many other First World countries, the advancement of women’s rights came about much slower.  In fact, it wasn’t until after Japan’s defeat in the Second World War and the US imposed its own political structure and judicial concepts on Japan during its occupation that the women’s movement started to gain momentum in Japan.  And even then, it was slow moving.  Most historians would agree that the reason for this slow progress was due to Japan’s reverence for its own tradition.  As a result of the defeat and occupation following 1945, Japan’s opinion of itself when compared to the rest of the world rapidly changed from a superior to an inferior complex.  They were essentially brought to their knees by the power of the American War Machine and, after the American society started to infiltrate Japanese media, they were slightly in awe of the “freedom” of American lifestyle.  However, 2000 years of tradition was not going to be erased so easily.  And then combine 2000 years of tradition with a 250 year period of complete, enforced isolation (ending finally in 1868) from any outside culture or society and you are left with some of the most stubborn set of ideals and beliefs that can be found anywhere in history.  	Around the same time that the Western European Code of Chivalry was being defined as the standard set of ethics for the members of the Aristocracy and Knighthood (the Middle Ages), the Bushido Code of Japan was being developed as guiding principal for its upper class.  Both standards of behavior dictated that women did not belong in the battlefield due to their “inferior” physical and mental capabilities.  The women’s role was in the household and servicing the men.  However, according to the concept of “Chivalry”, women should be treated with respect and often deserved to be placed on a pedestal.  Women represented the purity of life that men loose in their day-to-day life; whether it was in battle or managing their estate.  Women should be valued for their beauty, artistic capabilities, loving, tender nature, and for the ability to bear children/heirs.  It was so important to recognize these values of women that many people decided to write about it; sometimes in novel form, poetry, and even dissertations.   The female counterparts in Japan did not enjoy this kind of acknowledgement publicly.  Certainly a Japanese husband would often privately respect and consult the mother of his children, but women were definitely not placed on a pedestal.  This accounts for one historical source of a woman’s position in Japanese society and why the women’s rights movement advanced much more slowly in the East as compared to the West.    	Back to my original point:  Japanese women occupying a very small percentage of “white-collared” occupations, especially the higher-ranking ones.  And now for the allegory of the Capsule Hotel:  	A Capsule Hotel is a special kind of over-night lodging that rent “rooms” by the day.  They are geared mainly towards the “Salariman”, but of course are enjoyed and utilized frequently by other employees in an occupation that requires them travel away from the “base of their operations”.  Maybe for business trips, traveling sales, attending training and info seminars, traveling to branch sections of one’s company, etc. the Capsule Hotel is the most ideal form of lodgings one can obtain.  Why?  Because they don’t require reservations, they are much cheaper than a regular hotel, they offer almost any kind of service one would need for a 12-24 hour period, and they have onsens.  You can eat, kill time by watching TV, fall asleep in huge recliners, wash and soak your worries away at a Capsule Hotel.  The only thing that might leave people skeptical (without ever staying in one beforehand) is that your “room” is essentially a box.  However, this box is long enough for someone who is 6`4” to layout in and high enough for him to sit up right.  Each box comes equipped with its own alarm clock, air vent, and TV set.  The rest of the facilities are shared by all occupants. If you’re only there to spend the night before having to go to work early the next day, what else do you need?  	Why is a Capsule Hotel a man’s environment?  Well, obviously because in 95% of Capsule Hotels easily found, women are not allowed.  Apparently, co-ed Capsules exist, but I have never seen one.  Why aren’t women allowed in?  Because the men walk around with only thin robes on, they fall asleep practically exposed on the cushy recliners, and of course, no clothes are permitted in the single onsen room.  Men practically give up their clothes after signing in, walking around almost naked, sleeping almost naked, slurp their noodles almost naked, and sit in front of the TV almost naked. Why don’t they alter the “no-clothes” system or make two onsen rooms so that women can enjoy the facilities as well?  Because there aren’t enough women who would find a capsule hotel appealing enough to make a fuss.  Perhaps a Capsule Hotel just isn’t appealing to most women.  At the risk of sounding sexist yet in all honesty, professional women are required by trends of the latest magazines, TV shows, and international style to spend a lot of time on personal grooming.  A capsule hotel is not designed to accommodate that.  Of course then, this is quite the vicious cycle.  Women don’t complain because a Capsule Hotel fulfills only male stereotypes.   A Capsule Hotel appeals to a typical male because the only women around are the cleaners and men can be totally “free”, without inhibitions.  Women aren’t around because they are not permitted.   What male stereotypes am I talking about?  Ramen and beer are the main form of nourishment in the hotel.  We don’t have to “shield our dignity” from anyone who might be offended.  Capsule TVs and the shared big-screen only seem to play baseball/sumo games, the daily news, and most often, pornography.  How often do women spend the entire night on lazyboyz?  How many women have a beer for breakfast?  How many women are comfortable enough to leave their robes untied while walking through the halls of a hotel?  How many women enjoy playing strip poker and naked majong in the video arcade?  Some, but not many.    	By this time, we had safely reached the convenience store across from the hotel.  We bought our waters and cigarettes, went to the lounge on our floor, sat around almost naked smoking and looking stupid.  Not much was said anymore, except to agree for the 136th time that it was a good night/a funny night/a crazy night or all of the above and that we were definitely looking forward to some hard-earned sleep.

      Pt 6a:  It's a Spa World   	We came out of the “Inferno” into the painful sunlight and quickly congratulated each other for our fine, dedicated efforts at dancing like fools, spending too much money, drinking x number of beer, not vomiting on anyone, and lasting this long.  Before I headed back to the capsule hotel with the less adventurous types, we were debating what we were going to do next.  Were we going to try one more pub or club for no good reason other than to deny the possibility that what we really needed was some water and a snooze?  Robin and Nate refused to give up and were willing to lead whoever else to another bar that was supposedly “goin’ off.”  Having come down from a strong psychedelic/upper, and laden with alcohol, most of us didn’t have any patience left and just wanted to get out of the streets, like a bunch of drunken vampires who found the sunlight most harmful.   Wes and I had earlier seen a sign on our Capsule Hotel saying that you could pay 1500 yen (almost $20) and sleep for 5 hours.  My head still wasn’t on straight and my brain and gone to sleep a long time ago.  But Wes was confident that the offer was good for anytime during the day.  A daytime snooze at a Capsule Hotel would’ve been most unusual, but extremely convenient.  We were willing to go take a look to make sure.  	Then Brian brought up the idea of “Spa World.”  Probably very similar to what “Spa World” would be in Canada (a big work-out facility with a pool, sauna, massage palour, etc.).  But in Japan, there would also be the onsen (a collection of hot baths and saunas).  As had been told, “Spa World”, being very expensive, it was bound to be a huge, extravagant layout.  Brian, Mike, Pete, Austin, and Justin opted for the luxuriant “Spa World” for various reasons:  “Dude, it’s in Umeda, close to our bags (still in the lockers).” “Dude, I don’t think the Capsule Hotel will let you check in at this time.” “I want a nice long massage.  I’m totally stiff.” “In more ways than one, probably.  Did you see that chick with the hockey jersey, damn!” “I wonder if she would get naked while she massaged me…” “Dude, this is a classy joint.  There’s no way.  But YOU could get naked.” “Fine with me.  As long as she’d massage my ass.” “Dude, that’s gross.” “Whatever, I’ve got a nice ass.” (Bit of laughter) “Right, I’m not getting into the “Spa World” with my tattoo for sure.” (People with tattoos are almost always banned from onsens either because the Japanese consider them “dirty”, or because they are associated with the “Yakuza.”) “I’m not spending all that money for a simple bath and no bed to sleep in.” (“Spa World” is not meant to be used like a Capsule Hotel.  But since it was already daytime….) “Dude, they’ve got huge, comfy chairs.  But I’ll probably end up falling asleep in the onsen.”  	And on it went until people made up their minds with what they wanted.  Not making any sense to spend all that money (about $40 probably) on a bath and a nap in a chair (no matter how nice the layout was), I picked the Capsule Hotel.  But the curious 5 took the subway to “Spa World,” only to find it closed until noon.  Where upon, they fell asleep outside the doors until it opened for business, probably awakened by surprised, exasperated customers, kicking their way through the heap of messy, smelly, bleary-eyed, dazed and confused large foreign men.  It would’ve been quite amusing to see and probably very bad for business.  What would’ve been even funnier to see was the fact that, once inside the spa, Brian, Mike, and Austin fell asleep in lawn chairs, naked, and were woken up 5 hours later by very amused cleaning ladies.  It sounded like they woke up in much pain and surprise.  No doubt because they were naked and completely disoriented to the sound of loud vacuums, having to pry themselves out of the deck-chair style recliners, with strips of plastic embedded into their backs, asses, and legs.    	“Spa World” might have been quite the experience, especially for 4000 yen.  Massages, hot baths with all sorts of novelties (jets, body-cleansing minerals and herbs, electric therapy, massaging recliners in the water, pressure treatments, etc.), vibrating chairs, huge TVs, food and drinks, workout rooms, chill-out rooms, etc.  But the boys barely managed a basic shower and a quick dip in the tub before passing out, arguing over who would be the first into Massage Room #3 with the gorgeous masseuse with big….  	Of course, none of them got to try out Masseuse #3.  But feeling well rested and extremely uncomfortable explaining to the elderly cleaning ladies that they were from America and Australia, but living in Kochi, while slowly peeling themselves out of their plastic lounge chairs and uselessly trying to cover themselves up with no towels or clothes, they decided it was time to leave.  “Spa World” would probably best be appreciated sober, awake, and with a towel.  Unless it was in room #3 of course.

      What these two groups are well known for is their actions on the battlefield.  A good Knight was completely loyal to his King or Queen.  Because the King ruled in the name of God, a Knight fought relentlessly for his ruler and for God at the same time.  He did not fight for his own preservation but for his lord's kingdom.  He knew he would be rewarded for his efforts in Heaven and showed no fear on the battle field even when facing imminent death.  His actions, rather than his words, spoked for his righteous character.  These actions were paralleled by the Samurai who would readily accept even the most suicidal missions.  So resolute were they regarding the imminence of death, their actions may be considered rash because of their oft-seeming nature to rush headlong into precarious situations.  A Samurai turned Zen monk once quoted, "courage is gritting one's teeth; it is simply doing that and pushing ahead, paying no attention to the circumstances."  This did not mean that a Samurai had no concept of free will.  In fact, if a Samurai believed that his master was not adhering to honorable ways, he would strongly voice his opinion or protest.  In extreme cases, which occurred in surprising regularity, he would rebuke his superior by committing "Seppuku", which involved the taking of his own life by disembowelment.  This form of suicide proved not only the lord's wrong-doing, but also the Samurai's strength of spirit and resolve.  To a Christian Knight, nobility meant blind devotion even if his superior's decision was in question.  The Samurai would only die for his master if he believed him to be acting righteous.  A perfect example of this is the Battle of Fushimi Castle during the campaign of Tokugawa Ieyasu.  In an attempt to buy time for Ieyasu to complete his campaign in the east, a loyal retainer (Torii Mototada) commanded the defense of the west in a castle, being the last bastion of defense against the enemy forces, attempting to surge onnto the Eastern battlefront and surround Ieyasu's battlion.  Despite being heavily outnumbered, the small garrison supporting Ieyasu, which fought until literally the last man was dead, was able to prevent the enemy's advance for ten days.  This proved crucial in the formation of a Tokugawa Shogunate which would rule a unified Japan for about 250 years.  Torii, the loyal retainer proclaimed, "There is no place in a warrior's code of honor to even consider refusing to die for one's liege..."  It is important to mention that the European Knights had different objectives when fighting the enemy.  Indeed, the Knight's primary goal was not to kill, but rather to take the enemy hostage.  As a consequence, the captive could often be ransomed for a large amount.  The strength of an army wasn't totally determined by the size of the armies, but also by the size of treasury the particular army had.  For money was the means to increase the size, and therefore power, of this army.  This is what caused the ignorant belief that the Samurai were an irrational, barbaric people.  They did not expect to capture anyone alive for the Samurai would rather die than relent to the enemy.  The Samurai  did not collect captives for monetary gains, but rather the heads of their enemies as a Bundori (War Trophy).  The complete oblivion of the enemy rather than surrender was the only acceptable way to end the war.  Methods of war aside, life at home for both societies involved duties that were just as important as valor on the battlefield.  These duites were dictated in part by the strict class barriers that were rigidly enforced in both civilizations.  Cross-class relationships, other than merely business related, were morally forbidden and the interaction between members of differing classes observed clearly defined rules.  Any opposition shown to a superior was severely punished.  An extreme example of this, in Europe, peasants were the foot soldiers assisting the commanding Knight on horseback.  When these lower ranking peasants killed an opposing Knight, the commanding Knight sometimes did not see this as honorable or worthy.  In fact, this was ssen as morally wrong for the peasasnts to have crossed over the barrier as they did when attacking a Knight.  Even though he was the enemy, the peasants, in this case, would have been consequently put to death for this immoral act.  Even within the same class, rules of etiquette pervade every interaction.  The Samurai believed in "On", which is the gratitude shown by the retainer to his master for simply employing him to his service.  This demonstration of trust was enough to earn a Samurai's life-long service and complete loyalty.  A popular example of this loyal service can be seen in the story of the 47 Ronin.  In this case, the retainers were dedicated to their master even after his death.  They thought they were avenging their lord by the complete destruction of his enemy after the lord had died.  Not only was this vendetta morally sanctioned by the general public at the time, but it is also seen by many as the epitome of the Samurai's sense of duty.  "The various schools of Confucianism and all the pundits of Bushido agreed that the action of the ronin had been inspired by the highest motive."  It was promptly idealized in many works of art and literature and is still a popular source of folklore today. It was not uncommon for a Samurai to commit seppuku when his master died.  Many retainers considered life pointless without a master and would choose death instead to join the Daimyo in his place in history.  During times of peace, other activities were turned to so as to maintain proper conduct.  The Knights turned to managing their land and raising families.  But the Samurai, aside from the families, got involved in other, often aesesthetic, activities, to preserve their Samurai spirit.  For instance, the tea ceremony was enormously popular.  This "rustic, natural" activity was believed important because it helped cultivate a Samurai's etiquette.  It taught the politeness and calm known as "Wabi."  A modern tea master said, "The man who believes implicitly in wabi casts away everything that is unnecessary except for those requirements which are essential to practical living."  The contrary affect it had on constant warfare was seen as a way to balance inner virtues and produce harmony.  This can be paralleled by the lifestyle of the European courts.  Tenderness, understanding, and appreciation of beauty were highly praised.  While Christian Knights were devotees of art and literature, many were not educated in political or scholarly affairs.  In fact, many were not even literate.  The Samurai place a lot more importance on these matters because the expansion of the mind was a very important means of serving his lord.  "Thus the peacetime Samurai must perpetually school himself to perform each duty...as though it were his last...Every moment, every action, is to be saturated by last-moment full-scale energy and devotion."  Obviously the zeal deomnstrated on the battle field was expected to be shown just as readily at home while always under the service of a superior.  It is obvious that both the Samurai of feudal Japan and the Christian Knights of medieval Europe devleoped a strong, complex code of honor that pervaded every aspect in their society.  Despite the fact that the two cultures differed greatly in terms of ultimate goals, the means were only differentiated by the process of these cultures.  Both exhibited similar characteristics regarding roles and relationships within society, the importance of valor and bravery on the battle field, as well as total dedication to values of their respectful communities.  The same amount of significance was placed on each group's role in society as the leaders, trendsetters, and icons of righteousness.  This was the stuff that legends were made of.

      The following is a portion of a University Paper I wrote comparing the values and life-styles of the Japanese Samurai and the Christian Knights of Medieval Europe.  For all those interested in history, Samurai, or with a lot of time to kill.  The Medieval Period of European Society saw the emergence of some of the most popular heroes in history.  They were the Christian Knights:  Protectors of the King and his people who fought in the name of God and His Kingdom.  These righteous persons and their Code of chivalry defined their roles in society and have been the embodiment of countless artwork and literature.  The era of noble crusades and courtly love was seen by many as a Golden Age, a way of life that can be viewed as both beautiful yet barbaric.  Regardless of the point of view, this part of history saw an emergence of a way of life that influenced both outward behavior and an inward set of morals and virtues that set the standard for the European way of life for centuries to come.  Halfway across the globe, Japan, despite having a much older society, was developing a class of warriors who also were ruled by a strong, `righteous` set of morals and virtues.  These correlating members of their respectful society, despite not knowing of the other's existence, developed similar standards of outward behavior and inner virtues that even today are seen as honorable and worthy of much praise.  Of course, due to inexorable influence of the differing cultures, there arose distinctions between the two classes of people that are important in defining the role the Christian Knight and the Japanese Samurai played in their respective societies.  However, the fact that these groups developed very similar beliefs and ideals within very different cultures provides an interesting study in history.  Through the study of each group's definition of love and relationships, the importance of valor in battle, and life outside the battlefield, one can see the remarkable correlation between the societies of medieval Europe and feudal Japan.  The world of the Christian nobility in Europe is understood today through popular literature from the period.  Such heroic tales of bravery and honor found within Arthurian legend and noble crusades are an interesting mix of fact and idealistic fantasy.  In this brotherhood of virtue, religion was the key.  It colored everything a knight did--it was the basis for his code of chivalry.  Then came his family.  The honor of his family was crucial and could be enhanced by increasing his landholding.  Being successful in battle and coming to the attention of someone higher up in the echelons of society could accomplish this.  Another means was to marry the daughter of an important man or even his widow.  This would increase the husband's land, therefore his wealth, and consequently his prestige.  That usually was his main goal in life.  But life was only a test--his religion taught him that the afterlife was more important.  So while he strove to be a success on earth to be recognized on High, he had to do it in a good Christian way so he could spend eternity in Heaven.  Hence, he should be loyal, honorable, and fight for the Church when necessary.  No knight would sell his soul for earthly success.  The Code of Chivalry was the embodiment of this mentality.  Bushido characterized the dominant trait of Samurai society.  It is viewed as a result of the combining of an extremely nationalistic attitude with residual effects of Confucian doctrine imported from China.  The origin of these doctrines in Japan is attributed to Yamaga Soko (1622-85)who was a profound teacher of Chinese Confucianism.  He harmonized military strategy with the Chinese classics that provided a solid foundation for a moral, righteous society.  Originally, the Samurai's primary responsibility was to protect his master's land, which defined the wealth of the daimyo (landowners).  In return, the Samurai would often receive land of his own to manage.  The Samurai Warrior's primary concern was not a long life, but rather a resolution to death and the importance of dying well.  He endeavored to perfect his body and mind so to be properly prepared for death when it presented itself to him.  As Daidoji Yuzan Shigesuki (  The Code of the Samurai  ) said, "One who is a Samurai must before all things keep constantly in mind, by day and by night...the fact that he has to die.  That is his chief business."  The Samurai was not concerned for rewards after death, only that he and others knew that he died honorably.  While the Christian Knights strove for recognition in Heaven, the Samurai Warriors, who did not share the concept of an eternal paradise, dedicated themselves to recognition on Earth, before and after death.  Despite the fact that the Samurai's ultimate goal was far different than that of the Knight, the means to obtain these goals involved similar lifestyles.  Both societies saw women at the lowest rank of power.  A Knight was married primarily to maintain or expand his land and wealth.  The main role for the woman in a marriage was to produce an heir to the Knight's legacy.  Sometimes a real love relationship developed between man and wife but because arranged marriages were the norm, adultery was quite common.  The same was true for the Samurai husband who, while valuing his wife as the mother of his children, would satisfy his desires outside of his marriage.  Despite not being faithful, respect for the wife was considered.  A Christian nobleman would never discuss his affairs publicly because the appearance of loyalty was very important.  A Samurai would show "respect" by simply not loving his mistress.  Her purpose was solely for physical, not mental, satisfaction.  Obviously, it is human nature to desire physical pleasure and womanly companionship.  Such was the case for the Christian Knights and was exemplified by the idea of courtly love.  In Chretien de Troyes' depiction of Lancelot and Guinevere's forbidden affair, Lancelot renounced his pride and allowed himself to be distracted by the wife of King Arthur.  Ignoring the manly values and honor a Knight should uphold, he, with only a slight hesitation, humiliated himself by jumping in the back of a cart to prove his love.  "Reason, which dares thus speak to him, reaches only his lips, but not his heart; but love is enclosed within his heart, begging him and urging him to mount at once upon the cart."  This behavior would be unheard of in Samurai society.  The man was considered weak, not strong as Lancelot was heeded, to show outward longing for female companionship.  Of course, the Samurai realized the difficulty of harmonizing their inner feelings (Ninjo) and sense of duty (Giri), but it was believed that the "spiritual love" of a Samurai towards his duties gave him enough satisfaction so as not to need a woman so desperately.  One not-so-unusual similarity between these two societies was the regular occurrence and even acceptance of homosexuality.  The reasoning behind the European Knights turning to male sexuality has been credited simply to a lack of sexual activity while not at home.  It was also a way to bond and express the need for companionship.  Samurai sometimes valued male sexual relations over female because it was seen as a way to improve one's character.  Rationalized more profoundly, homosexuality was seen as a way of "obtaining a noble heart, to be both tender and noble," as well as a right of succession for adolescents.  A young Samurai was almost completely raised without any female influence.

      To do drugs again or not to do drugs:&nbsp; That was the question.&nbsp; Whether t'was wiser to repeat the previous night's indulgence or merely to drink and dance until we couldn't take any more:&nbsp; That was the decision we faced that evening.&nbsp; We were back in Triangle Park, having rested a bit more and eaten dinner.&nbsp; For Brian, Mike, Peter, Austin, and Robin, there was no question.&nbsp; Not only were they going to get some "White Love" tonight, but they were going to do it properly this time.&nbsp; At least a whole bag each was the plan.&nbsp; Of course, Wes, Chris, and Greg were having none of it.&nbsp; Unnatural chemicals was no way to go.&nbsp; But for me, Ernie, and Justin, the choice was more difficult.&nbsp; Could we treat our bodies so bad as to do it two nights in a row?&nbsp; Could we actually handle a night as long as the last?&nbsp; Should we just suck it up and do it?&nbsp; Well, that's what I did.&nbsp; I think Ernie did half a bag, but Justin didn't want any again.   Nate had a rendezvous in Kyoto with someone that night so we were down a member.&nbsp; Nate was our best source for ideas and locations in Osaka, so without his advice, we decided to make it easy and stay around the Shinsaibashi area.&nbsp; There was enought of a variety&nbsp;around Triangle Park alone to keep us content for mere weekend.   So we got the drugs and the beer and chilled in Triangle Park while deciding where to spend the evening.&nbsp; From Triangle Park, we could hear the pounding music emanating from a club nearby called "Club Joule."&nbsp; The fast-paced, high-intensity beats were calling to me.&nbsp; Another idea was the hip-hop club next to that.&nbsp; A general rule of thumb amongst the Kochi JETs is that the taste of music varies a great deal, but ANYONE will dance to the classic hip-hop hits like Snoop Dog, Eminem, Missy Elliot, the Black-Eyed Peas, etc.&nbsp; Therefore, a bunch of the group wanted to check out the hiphop club nearby that boasted "live dancers" and a "live DJ."&nbsp; (As opposed to the pre-recorded DJ?)&nbsp; We had seen live Japanese hip-hop dancers before.&nbsp; If you like watching organized dance routines involving some pretty cool break-dancing moves, than you would've enjoyed this.&nbsp; I still had fond memories of the "Underlounge" in Osaka with Bree the night I returned from Calgary for winter vacation.&nbsp; So, I suggested going back there.&nbsp; It seemed to be a pretty popular idea amongst most of us, so we went in search of it.&nbsp; About 10 minutes later we had arrived and were getting excited.&nbsp; The line was big but quick-moving and there was security standing outside the door.&nbsp; This was the first I had seen of "Bouncers" at a Japanese club in my entire time there.&nbsp; We got to the front of the line and shone them our biggest, classiest smiles with our IDs ready and we were on our way throught the door when a big hand landed heavily and with much authority on my shoulder.&nbsp; I was totally taken aback!&nbsp; What's this?&nbsp; A Japanese person getting violent with me?!&nbsp; Of course, that was overly melodramatic.&nbsp; It's just that it had been an awfully long time since I'd seen or experienced physical contact that wasn't sumo.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the bouncer had noticed that Mike and myself were wearing sandals and we were henceforth barred from entering the club.&nbsp; Wow!&nbsp; Bouncers AND a no-shoes rule; this must have been a special place indeed!&nbsp; I guess too swank for us country folk, hyuk.&nbsp; So, it was annoying but not unreasonable.&nbsp; I mean, not a single club back home would let a person in without proper footwear after all.   So, it was back to Triangle Park to figure out our next plan of attack.&nbsp; Over some beer we sat and discussed the situation.&nbsp; Half of us wanted to check out the high-intensity situation of "Club Joule."&nbsp; After all, why had we gotten the drugs if not to enjoy a scene like that tonight?&nbsp; But the other half wanted to check out the hip-hop club, claiming that "Club Joule" would be too loud and crazy, or that they didn't dig that kind of music.&nbsp; "Wimps!" thought I.   But then something slightly dangerous happened.&nbsp; We began a serious discussion.&nbsp; After a few beer, barely avoiding a huge Faff Session, Ernie decided to tell us his story of much indignation about his last visit to the War Memorial in Hiroshima under the site of the atomic bomb explosion.&nbsp; I figured his indignation stemmed from being publicly embarrassed to some degree.&nbsp; What happened apparently during his tour through the museum was that at some point he was accosted by an old, but extremely vocal Japanese woman who had obviously lived through the horror of 1945.&nbsp; Ernie, one of the most humanitarian persons I've ever met, of course, did not deserve the tongue-lashing of a still disturbed Atomic Bomb victim.&nbsp; Ernie, being pretty much fluent in Japanese had to endure a tirade from the old woman for a good few minutes before some people finally dragged the nearly hysterical woman away.&nbsp; The nasty comments were directed towards all Americans, but Ernie especially as the woman was aghast to see an American with the nerve to show his face there.&nbsp; For some reason, the woman believed that the memorial was meant for the Japanese&nbsp;ONLY as a reminder of the tragedy that befell their beloved country.&nbsp; Ernie, with good reason, was outraged because the Japanese were no less guilty of crimes against humanity than the Americans, Germans, Russians, and even Canadians for that matter (I'm referring to the forced displacement and unjust seizure of Japanese-Canadians and their property during World War II.)&nbsp; Ernie's arguement was valid to some extent, but some of us argued his reasoning.&nbsp; Ernie claimed that the Japanese had no right to feel that way towards the Americans, especially today, &nbsp;because it was being hypocritical.&nbsp; An obvious argument to that being that the Americans would likely feel the same way as the Old Lady if the bomb had been dropped on them.&nbsp; Some would arugue that the punishment (the bomb) didn't fit the crime, etc., etc.&nbsp; Some said that the woman's reaction to Ernie's presence should be tolerated, if not understandable.&nbsp; That is pretty hard to maintain though too.&nbsp; Both sides of this coin had merit in my opinion.&nbsp; If I was in Ernie's situation, it would have been tough for me to stand there and not say anything in retort to the seemingly unfair accusations, especially since I am Canadian and the Old Woman never stopped to consider the fact that Ernie might not have been American after all.   What developed from there was a full-fledged, sometimes overly-loud, debate.&nbsp; We both attracted attention and scared it away, sitting in the middle of Triangle Park and appearing more as a Japanese Diet (House of Parliament) session rather than a bunch of easy-going, tree-hugging, beer-drinking, open-minded English teachers.&nbsp; But it was an interesting conversation and it definitely got our blood pumping in preparation for another exciting evening.&nbsp; Below are some facts surrounding the debate.&nbsp; Read on if you would like to add some food for thought and decide for yourself.&nbsp;   &nbsp;  Travelling throughout Japan today, one sees no physical scars of war.&nbsp; But the Second World War will soon come up in conversation, for it is a touchstone, seeminly the ultimate reference point against which to measure today's events.&nbsp; For those who actually lived through it, the psychic and social scars are incredibly deep.   The year 1995 marked the fiftieth anniversary of VE-Day, the end of the war in Europe, the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, VJ-Day, the end of the war, and the establishment of the United Nations.&nbsp; For North Americans born since the war, those events have little relevance.&nbsp; But Japanese, even the younger generations are still coming to grips with Japan's role in the war and the humiliation of defeat.   The debate still continues as to whether Hiroshima and Nagasaki were the cost of a speedy end to war or symbols of war gone much too far.&nbsp; Japan has come to be viewed by some as a victim of war, the only country ever to experience a nuclear weapon deliberately used on civilians.&nbsp; Yet a retrospectie on Hiroshima, planned for 1995 by the Smithsonian Institution, received such a storm of objection from verterans' groups that the exhibition was gutted of its focus.&nbsp; Opinion seems to be split between anger at Japanese atrocities committed during the war and outrage at the bomb's introduction, which brought a new dimension to warfare.   What has caused such powerful revulsion for atomic weapons?&nbsp; This was a big arguable factor in our long-winded and overly-intense debate.&nbsp; Someone suggested that it was based on the number of innocent people killed.&nbsp; But can it simply be that since, after all, more people were killed by the fire-bombing of Tokyo than by the atomic bombs.&nbsp; Someone said that it was a most horrible, inhumane method of killing (like there are more humane ways of killing...).&nbsp; Yet, couldn't it be that instant incineration may be more merciful than the often protracted and agonizing deaths from "conventional" weapons?&nbsp; I, myself, suggested that atomic weapons not only affect those present at the bombing, but also those not there, and later on in the future.&nbsp; But an interesting fact I wasn't aware of was presented to me.&nbsp; This ability of nuclear weapons to imprint the future is shared by chemical weapons, such as mustard gases, which are strongly mutagenic.&nbsp; Yet these standard weapons of both World Wars barely caused a fraction as much discontent from the general world community.&nbsp;   Perhaps part of the reason nuclear weapons seem so terrifying is that they marshal the powers of the Big Kahuna of all sciences - theoretical physics - to unleash the very energy of matter itself.&nbsp; Since this revelation, no area in science has been beyond potential military application, and the connection between scientific research and weapons of destruction has remained tighter than ever.   The fundamental explanation of nuclear weapons' exceptional horror, as finally agreed upon by the 11 of us, may be explained by a famous psychiatrist from Yale - Stephen Jay Lifton.&nbsp; (Thanx to Ernie for being privy to this tidbit of information.)&nbsp; In the weeks following the bomb, Lifton recounts, a rumor spread through Hiroshima that nothing would ever again grow in the city.&nbsp; People were aghast; while we all understand that each of us will die, we are assured by our knowledge that nature persists.&nbsp; When it seemed that nature itself was ended, people felt that this was the ultimate horror.&nbsp; Only when new plants sprouted did people feel hope again.&nbsp; Now we know that nature can withstand those bombs, but in the years that followed the Second World War, hydrogen bombs and a massive proliferation of weapons created a very real spectre of the end of nature itself.   A consequence of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was the birth of a strong antinuclear movement in Japan.&nbsp; Paradoxically, almost 60 years later, Japan has a vigorous nuclear energy industry and is accepting radioactive wastes from other countries for reprocessing.&nbsp; The Japanese understand war's true horrors, and they share a commonality of experience with all other victims of war.&nbsp; but as a defeated nation and as a victim of the most terrifying weapons, they also are in a unique position.&nbsp; Even over half a century later, the Second World War is still close to the surface of their consciousness.&nbsp; And for those who bore a disproportionate share of the costs, the war continues.   And our own private struggle continued too.&nbsp; Maybe due to the lull in the decision-making process, lasting about 20-30 minutes as we argued on about the validity of one old woman's quest to accuse the entire people of the U.S.A.&nbsp; After coming back to the here and now, we could not collectively agree on a single place to go.&nbsp; So, for the second night as well, we split up and headed to two different locations to experience two different angles on clubbing Osaka.

      This is the point in the weekend where nothing of any note was supposed to happen.&nbsp; It would've been around 1 or 2 in the afternoon, we would've just woken up from our all-too-brief&nbsp;5 hours of unconscious bliss.&nbsp; We would've just eaten our first meal in about 18 hours at the Freshness Burger shop.&nbsp; We had nothing to do.&nbsp; We didn't have a lot of money to spend on luxuriant time-killers like a movie, the aquarium, shopping, etc.&nbsp; And we most certainly did not have the patience or energy to do a lot of walkintg or moving around in general.&nbsp; After lunch and a lot of sitting around, all we needed to do was to get our bags from Osaka station so we could freshen up and change our clothes.&nbsp; Other than that, there was nothing to do while the sun was still out.   A few of the guys decided to just hang out in Tower Records and the like while Chris, Wes, Greg, and myself left for Osaka Station to find our lockers and get our stuff.&nbsp; I was looking forward to a clean shirt.&nbsp; It seemed that every time I inhaled, I got a whiff of cigarette smoke and cheap perfume from the  Inferno .&nbsp; We walked to the subway station and took a train to the underground mall beneath Osaka Station (Umeda Station).&nbsp; These days, I can find my way around Osaka Station no problem.&nbsp; But for someone who'd never been there before, it is incredibly disorienting.&nbsp; It was my first time in the station because during prior visits I had always taken the ferry to Osaka and never had any other need to go to Osaka Station.&nbsp; But the term "Osaka Station" actualy refers to the giant conglomeration of:&nbsp; The JR (Government-operated) main train terminal for local and city-to-city transport, the two big private lines and the completely separate terminals that handles that traffic, the three different city-to-city bus companies and their terminals, Umeda Station (the subway terminal underneath Osaka Station), and the underground shopping district (apparently one of the biggest of its kind in the world).&nbsp; All together, the complex encompasses about 6 city blocks, and to me it seems to epitomize the essence of a big Japanese metropolis.&nbsp; Organized chaos; a lesson in paying attention.&nbsp; Sure, there are signs in English to guide you, but first you'd have to know where it is you needed to go.   After getting off the subway in the underground, signs lead you to what seems to be a hundred different exits, each leading to a completely different section of the complex.&nbsp; Now when I got off the subway, I realized that I had taken for granted the location of my locker.&nbsp; Fortunately, I was with people who had paid moroe attention.&nbsp; We expected to be in and out of Osaka station within 15 minutes and back to Shinsaibashi right around the time the capsule hotel began check-in.&nbsp; And as I mentioned before, this chapter should not have been worth writing about.&nbsp; But in the subway, at a booth nearest the platform, I stopped to buy a pack of gum.&nbsp; Of course, I told the others.&nbsp; But within the 30 seconds it took me to buy the gum and turn around again, they had magically disappeared.&nbsp; And it was weird because the platform was a wide-open space and I&nbsp;was normally able to see over everyone's head, practically a bird's-eye view.&nbsp; But they had literally vanished and I was left clueless.   Well, that's not entirely correct.&nbsp; The one thing I did know was that my locker was inside Osaka station.&nbsp; But what I was soon to learn was that if I were to ask someone to "find this locker; it's somewhere inside Osaka Station,"&nbsp;it would be like asking someone, "Would you go find Mike please?&nbsp; He's somewhere in New York City."&nbsp; I took the nearest exit up above ground and became immediately immersed in a sea of people.&nbsp; I was pushed and shoved in my attempt to make for a doorway outside.&nbsp; I was trying to retrace my steps from the night before the best I could.&nbsp; But all I could recall was that I had gotten off the bus, put my bag in a nearby locker, crossed a small road, entered a different building, went down some stairs, and arrived pn a subway platform.&nbsp; I assumed that by finding the nearest stairs up, leaving the building at the nearest exit, crossing the nearest small road, and then came across some buses, I'd find my locker.&nbsp; How stupid am I?&nbsp; As it turned out, my friends had taken the subway exit on the opposite side of the platform, had come above ground 100 meters from the lockers, got their stuff, and were on their way.&nbsp; Now of course, my buddies are not inconsiderate assholes.&nbsp; When I finally got back to Triangle Park to meet with them, they said that they had waited for me to buy my pack of gum for a couple of minutes, but that when THEY turned back around, I had disappeared!&nbsp; They assumed I knew where I was going so didn't bother looking for me.&nbsp; They also tried calling me to make sure, but I had left my cell phone in the locker with my stuff.&nbsp; That was the most annoying part.&nbsp; I decided the night before that I wasn't going to need my cell phone so I didn't bother bringing it with me, despite the fact that it was so small and barely went noticed in a pocket.&nbsp; I've never left my cell behind since as it would've saved me the trouble.&nbsp;   I won't go into much more detail by describing step by step how I eventually found my locker and got back to Shinsaibashi without suffering a nervous breakdown.&nbsp; I don't think I could even if I tried, considering that the afternoon in that huge complex was as complete blur.&nbsp; I walked around and around, looking at the signs in English and Japanese, which didn't help because I didn't know what I was looking for.&nbsp; All the signs that said "Lockers" didn't lead me to MY locker.&nbsp; I constantly accosted help booth ladies and security guards to ask where the locker matching the number on my key would be.&nbsp; They kept telling me that there was no such locker here.&nbsp; At first I was wondering what drugs they were on.&nbsp; Surely the locker was here in Osaka Station because this is where I put my bags; somewhere in Osaka Station.&nbsp; But I realized later that when they said "here," they meant in the current building.&nbsp; I was walking from one station to another, from one building to another, without realizing it.   Finally, it occured to me to ask someone where the bus terminal was.&nbsp; I did so.&nbsp; He asked me, "Which one?"&nbsp; I said, "I don't know.&nbsp; I came from Kochi yesterday."&nbsp; He said, "I see.&nbsp; What bus did you come on?"&nbsp; (Translation:&nbsp; Stupid gaijin!&nbsp; I don't care where you came from.)&nbsp; I said, "I don't know.&nbsp; But I arrived at 8:45 last night."&nbsp; He said, "Is that all you know?"&nbsp; (Translation:&nbsp; Are you retarded?)&nbsp; I said, "Yes, please tell me where the nearest bus station is."&nbsp; He told me and took off shaking his head.&nbsp; I made it to the bus station, but of course, it was the wrong one.&nbsp; Again, if I had my phone, I could've called someone to ask what bus line we used to get here.&nbsp; Anyway, eventually, I came across the JR Bus Terminal and I finally found my bag.&nbsp; It took an hour and a half while it took the others less than 10 minutes.&nbsp; I was exhausted and still very much hung over.&nbsp; I dashed back to America-mura as soon as possible, checked into the same capsule hotel, and hit the sack.   Some good things to come out of it were:&nbsp; It helped me build up confidence to randomly hasass a stranger in Japanese whenever I had a question.&nbsp; The unit on giving directions in Japanese I learned in University and had nearly forgotten came roaring back.&nbsp; And I now know Osaka Station like the back of my hand.&nbsp;

      We arrived in Banglok in the late afternoon.&nbsp; At the airport, immediately after going through customs, we were accosted by hoards of Thai people, offering us super-duper discounts for our taxi fares wherever we wanted to go.&nbsp; Some were offering "package deals."&nbsp; Not only would they take us to our final destination, but they would also show us around some of the better sites.&nbsp; These people looked very professional, dressed in suits and skirts, but we were having none of it.&nbsp; We got the heads up that these "discounts" weren't actually discounts at all.&nbsp; Just annoying schemes to get us into the cars so they could try to sell us on other tours and even souvenirs while driving us hither and thither.&nbsp; It was a far better deal to just use the taxis with meters, rather than paying a flat rate.&nbsp; The taxi drivers on the meter weren't up to anything fishy; they just drove from A to B.&nbsp; After fighting our way through the throng ("Hey, where are you going?"&nbsp; "Are you from America?"&nbsp; "Look at our super-discount, just for you!"&nbsp; "Come this way, come this way!"&nbsp; "Do you want to see the special sites of Thailand?"), we hopped into a regular cab and took off for Chinatown, where our hotel for the night was.  We got to the Chinatown Hotel and relaxed for a bit.&nbsp; It was late evening and all we had the energy to do was take a quick walk around the area for some food and a nightcap.&nbsp; Chinatown might be nice, but when the sun goes down, it seemed the shops all close.&nbsp; There wasn't much to look at except a 7-11 every two blocks.&nbsp; And that's no exaggeration!&nbsp; We found a small restaurant to eat in for our first try at authentic Thai Food.&nbsp; It was awesome.&nbsp; I knew I was going to like it, but the amount of selection in Thai cuisine was surprising.&nbsp; It rivaled authentic Chinese Food, but it was even spicier!&nbsp; After the food, a quick drink and a bit of a walk, trying in vain to find a club, pub, or some place interesting, we went back to the hotel for an early night to bed.&nbsp; It had been a long day.  The next day was shopping day.&nbsp; No questions asked, we went straight to Kao San Road in the heart of the old section of Bangkok.&nbsp; Kao San Road is essentially a conglomeration of smaller roads and their shops whose proprietors have joined together in the spirit of providing for the foreigner.&nbsp; It is full of hostels, pubs, restaruants, clubs, and small shops, indoors and out.&nbsp; It is a paradise for those looking for cheap authentic Thai goods.&nbsp; The girls had to buy new suitcases to carry all thenew clothes they bought.&nbsp; My CD collection increased exponentially.&nbsp; We also stocked up on western toiletries not found in Japan, jewelry, sunglasses, and anything necessary for a summer vacation.&nbsp; This place is a Mecca for the tourist.&nbsp; There are no Thai people on the road, other than those selling their wares.&nbsp; Many of the pubs, restaurants, Tattoo parlors, and some shops were even run by westerners.&nbsp; But this wasn't just any tourist trap.&nbsp; Actually, I wouldn't even call it a trap at all.&nbsp; People weren't really trying to rip us off.&nbsp; As far as I could tell, the food and goods were authentic Thai-style; not to mention Thai prices.&nbsp; We were surrounded by young people, almost exclusively.&nbsp; Except ofr the occasional aging hippie, no one seemed any older than 30.&nbsp; Sometimes, I even felt a little on the old side myself.  These people were here for the same reasons we were.&nbsp; A bit of sight-seeing in one of the most beautiful countries in the world in between partying in one of the most excitng countries as well.&nbsp; It was evident that many of the people were forgoing sleep in favor of all-nighters on the dance floor, bar stool, and red-light district.&nbsp; Other parts of Bangkok are much more serene.&nbsp; It is traditionally considered the Venice of Asia after all.&nbsp; But the Kao San area sizzled with energy that never dissipates.&nbsp; Such is the inevitable outcome of a place that is frequented only by transients, backpackers, sightseers, and other various manifestations of restlessness.&nbsp; I got the feeling that most of the people there were just passing through.&nbsp; They were on their way to the&nbsp; islands down south, or northern Thailand, popular for treks through tropical wilderness and ancient Thai ruins.&nbsp; Kao San, while vibrant and colorful, offers nothing relating to stability, comfort, and tranquility.  After we could carry no more, we went back to the hotel to check out, pick up our bags, repack, and then walked to the train station.&nbsp; It was a short walk, but with all of our luggage, it was very good exercise.&nbsp; Hot and bothered, we arrived at the large train station.&nbsp; Being carefully run by the government, the station resembled more of a government office than a station.&nbsp; While we waited for the train, I had some Thai fast food, while the girls treated themselves to Dairy Queen.&nbsp; What a selection, and all in the train station no less.  At the appropriate time, we boarded the train that would take us south to a town called Chumpon.&nbsp; It was there that we would catch the ferry across the channel to the islands.&nbsp; The train was an over night express and we had to settle for second class.&nbsp; But it was fairly nice enough.&nbsp; A little stuffy, but we each had our own bunk to sleep on.&nbsp; Throughout the night, we had the antics of the drunk and boisterous train porters to entertain&nbsp;us.&nbsp; After they put down the beds for us, it seemed that they were off duty.&nbsp; Maybe they weren't, but they sure acted that way.&nbsp; They dug right in to the unsold beer and very quickly got wasted.&nbsp; They danced with the girls, sang traditional Thai songs, and teased each other in front of the passengers.&nbsp; But they were young, kind, and courteous to us, and they never made any noise in the passenger cars where people were trying to sleep.&nbsp; It definitely helped pass the time.

      "Golden Week" in Japan is essentially a five-day weekend.&nbsp; Every year, four statutory holidays occur within one week of each other.&nbsp; These holidays are:&nbsp; "Green Day," "Children's Day," "Constitution Day," and "Constitution Day Pt.2."&nbsp; Hurray for the American-imposed, often-abused and misinterpreted Japanese consititution!&nbsp; Combined with the weekend, people often find they have a week off from work/school.&nbsp; This year, for example, the holidays were on a Thursday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.&nbsp; People working for more lenient employers wouldn't have been expected to come in on the Friday.&nbsp; Classes were in, but the students would've had a free day to as they pleased.&nbsp; I used this lax time of year to take an additional 4 days off.&nbsp; Timed right, I had twelve days off.&nbsp; I used this opportunity to go somewherer I've always wanted to go, but never got around to going before.&nbsp; Yeah, Thailand Baby!!!   This trip to Thailand was to be my first trip outside of Japan (other than back to Canada) during my two-year stay in Kochi.&nbsp; Originally, the three girls (Andrea, Karen, and Kelly) had planned this for themselves.&nbsp; But when I found out about their plans, I asked if I could tag along.&nbsp; I imagine I could've found something else to do for my Golden Week holiday; something on my own or with a different group of people, including some guys.&nbsp; But Thailand is THE place I've wanted to go since before I left for Japan.&nbsp; It also seems that all those I knew in Kochi had already been and I was missing out on something.&nbsp; I HATE that feeling!&nbsp; On top of that, the girls were hot, and they seemed fairly keen to have me come along.&nbsp; Karen suggested that it was "safer" if they had a big guy around, looking out for them.&nbsp; Andrea secretly confessed that she was glad I was coming along because she usually gets along with guys better than girls and was worrying about the possibility of getting sick of the other two, as is common when good friends spend too much time together without a break.   By the time our departure date came around, I was incoherently excited.&nbsp; I had been working really hard since Christmas, not just because of work, but also due to this year's Tosa-ben Musical.&nbsp; I had given up almost every weekend since mid-January as well as numerous weekday nights&nbsp;for rehearsals.&nbsp; I will admit, however, that the time was well spent.&nbsp; Our endition of  Romeo & Juliet / Westside Story  was awesome!&nbsp; We were interviewed by at least 5 different TV/Radio programs, and appeared on at least 3 different shows.&nbsp; Two of those three shows involved 20-45 minute segments devoted just to our backgrounds, show history, and practice regiments!&nbsp; Due to all the media coverage combined with the influence of friends and audience members of years gone by, by the time the final Kochi City show came around, we were filling the seats like "Cats" on Broadway.&nbsp; The day after our last show, the day after the wrap-up party, the four of us got to leave Kochi behind for ten sweet days.&nbsp; Boy, did we rub it in!&nbsp; Everyone else had to work that Monday after the party.&nbsp; All we had to do was pack and catch a ferry that night.   After a rough ride across the strait to the Osaka Port, we arrived at Kansai Airport in the middle of a heavy rainstorm.&nbsp; The high winds delayed all the flights for an hour and a half.&nbsp; It was annoying but not the end of the world.&nbsp; The delay caused us to miss our connecting flight to Bangkok from Hong Kong, but Cathay Air quickly rounded up a new flight for us and we were on our way immediately.&nbsp; Great service, Cathay!
