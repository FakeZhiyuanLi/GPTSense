       I hope he never hurts you like I know I hurt you but I was undecided and it was all that I could do but if he says he loves you like I know I loved you then there's a way to trust him, and I’ll get over you  so let his heart surround you, and let his arms protect you and hold you every morning the way that I could never do another life has blessed you, he wants the same as you do so I must find the courage to send you on your way  all the nights reflecting in our chance connecting help me find the meaning in the life I had with you I wish I'd heard when you said that your heart could not wait but it was my decision to send you on your way....  I hope he loves you like I loved you, I hope he knows you like I do 'cause if he loves you like I love you, then I can send you on your way...  ~Eastmountainsouth

       I don't remember last nights, which is odd...but here is one from earlier this week:  A few of us were playing a video game and we ended up somehow becoming the video game and we were shooting these robots, there were droids but you didn't have to kill them.(if you've ever played jedi Academy, you'd know what I was talking about) Anywho it was me, Eric, Steve, and Barb who were shooting these robots. We ended up in this room, and we had all these guns and ammo surrounding us, and across from us was an elevator. Steve got into the elevator with a small amount of guns and I followed. I was going to help him kill the "bad guys" on a different level. So I noticed that Eric and Barb didn't follow. So the doors closed and we went down a few levels, and I was looking for what gun I anted to use, and I found a shotgun. So I picked it up and noticed there was no ammo for it, so I asked Steve where some was. He was like, I don't think I brought any, I might have a little. So I was a little upset, because I didn't have the proper means to protect myself. So we sort of skipped shooting the bad guys and went back to the original level. When we got there, there were all kids of green plants and Eric had a full beard. I looked at Steve who also had a full beard and noticed that Barb and Eric were holding hands. I asked what was going on and Eric said, you've been gone for 7 years (they were married). I looked at Steve and he said yes, it was a time warp, and we've been gone for several years. Then I woke up...

       I don't remember my dream, which is unusual. The only thing I do remember is that it was dark, and I was in my old neighborhood. Pretty boring, not as exciting as the others.

       Ok, this dream is a doozy. I woke up and was like, of all people to dream about...  I was at a church and there was a service going on and my cousin walked in and I was talking to him for a while. I was sitting next to Eric except it wasn't him. He had long hair and a different face. He was getting upset that I was talking to my cousin so I got up and  was asking my cousin what he was going to do, since "Eric" was mad. He said he was going to become a priest, and I told him he couldn't date girls if he did and he said, well I just be the guy that carries the cross. So "Eric" ended up leaving and was telling me he was mad, and that I couldn't talk to him anymore. So I went to find my cousin and tell him that we couldn't talk and he was very upset, and wanted to give me a parting gift, so we went to the jewelry store. (apparently there was a mall in the church, since that is where we were now). So we went into the store and he was picking out some jewelry for me, so I would remember him, and Brandon was in there and he was looking at all these fantasy type sculptures of dragons and castles. He saw one and asked the store owner if they were made of real crystal, and he said, no they are made of...asphalt maybe, something ridiculous. So my cousin ended up buying these big earrings, ruby's and diamonds. So we were leaving and "Eric" saw us and got mad. So we were trying to search for him. I found him in a box, he was now a 2ft figurine of Michael Jackson. (I was married to him) So I was like, what are you doing, and he was pretending to be a doll, and It was very frustrating, so I told him, if he didn't act normal, I was leaving. So I started to leave and he got very upset and turned into a psycho chucky like doll. So he was riding a miniature forklift and was planning on knocking stuff on my cousin and I so we started running, and eventually got away from him. My cousin left and I was alone, now looking for Michael Jackson. I walked through this door and above me was another cat door to the litterbox and he was in there. I reached up over my head and grabbed his hair and flung him forward over my head. I was also yelling "what are you doing in there!" Then I woke up...  Before that I was dreaming about an old friend of mine, and she died, and was a ghost. But she wasn't sure what she was supposed to do as a ghost. So I told her to find out how she died, and once she did that, she wouldn't be a ghost anymore...(It must have been pretty boring, since it changed into the above...)  CRAZY dreams....

       I have very unusual dreams. I should have a blog that just has all my dreams on it. Last night I woke up, or did I, at 2:00 am. I was screaming and yelling "She'd going to get me!" There was a woman looking at me. I can't remember if I was dreaming. Maybe I was, and it just felt real.  But there was a woman on the side of my bed, and she was leaning in towards my face. I started to freak out. So I turned some lights on and went back to bed. Pretty sad at my age...but it was freaky. It probably was just a dream, but it felt very real...

       Time of Confussion  In my time of happiness there is confussion Sitting there calling my name Wanting me to think of what used to be And blanket myself in what was The past is so far gone Yet so close to my heart Trying to escape these sickly memories Does nothing but make me weaker The love that is drowning me, Is forever in my eyes-I know it will last But the wisper of your voice Makes me sink Makes me bleed and remember years gone There is a hatered in my heart Where you silently sit Every now and then I visit To tell you the things I never did This state of confussion exist but I don't know why Becasue I have a love that is far better And he'll never say goodbye  Kimberly Mae Reichert  Copyright ©2004 Kimberly Mae Reichert

       5 O'clock & Dreaming  Somewhere between my thoughts and pain lies a faint memory... Of moonlit dancing.. and angels falling where you are. And I breathe to take the glance of your sad eyes To read you like the open book...that you aren't And get lost in the pages of your soul The hurt that bleeds inside you drips upon my chest and burns this heart within.. Silently..faintly beating at the sound of your voice But I wish you not away For your laughter brings peace to me and settles the storms within.. And the smile upon your face..erases all that lies within For you are not alone on this unknown journey.. For I will silently follow to catch you if ever you fall...
