      Hello again,     Well it seems that having a Blog is hard to keep track of when you have 1 million other things to do. Well today is Monday August 23,2004. I worked on CoGo's Sumatran Express, (you know the train at the zoo.........whatever.) Well lets just say when you have to keep riding and keep saying the speech it........ 1. Makes your mouth dry (Too Much Talking!) 2. The Gas Fumes Get to you (Thats why the title is Fumed Up!) 3. Sometimes you get hit with bugs ( EVEN IN THE EYE! ) 4. The microphone to say the speech dos'nt always work (But your Boss still makes you say it*) (But you still like your boss*)     I worked with Molly (mycousion) and Tracey (well shes just Tracey.) There alot od fun to work with but not when Trace has her Air Jordans on!!!!!! Tommorow I work on the Train again with Doneika ( I think thats How you spell it ) It's gonna be my last full day with her cause she is going to Italy to study abrod. Ill also be working with Alica B. shes cool to work with...but im gonna scare her and say theres a bug on her!!!     On Wednesday I finally get the day off, but i have HighSchool Orentation and Its Donekias last day so were trowing her a party at work. Well gotta go get some rest.                                                                                                                           Nite

       Hello world!,     My name is Conor. I am 14 years old and I live in Pittsburgh, PA. I have an awesome job at the Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium. I do have to say I love life, and all the people in it. My life long motto would be "Live Life one day at a time." Original Huh? I live with my Parents Dan and Denise, with the addition of a sister ( Katie.) I have two life long best friends ( Meghan and Katelyn.) And they are really cool to be with. My most recent friends I have made were Sari and Chris ( co-workers.) Now all of the Visitor Services staff ( and Zoo employee staff ) have been really nice, and are also friends. Sari and Chris are just my two Best Freind Zoo buddies.     Now this would be a Blog without telling what happened today!       August 19, 2004    Today I woke up to cloudy Pittsburgh weather, I though I was going to have the day off, but little did I know that it wasnt supposed to rain untill later that night. So I had to rush at like 10:10 am to be able to get to work at like 11 a.m. Finnaly I was ready and my cousion drove me to work. Well today I had to work on CoGo's Sumatran Express ( its alil train thing that is an attraction for Zoo visitors.) Well I love the train to death...but today was not it's day. I was tried the dumb thing kept smoking and it rained twice so we had to shut it down two times. Well me Phil ( Train Driver ) and Chris ( Read^Above) got our luck when we did'nt have to take it to the barn, then walk back. It rained very heavy for about an hour and is still drizzling as I type. Again thats Pittsburgh Weather. Anyways I have to go right now, beacuse I work tommorow again on the Train.... Please Let It Rain!
