      Bull or Bear?  A case for equity stocks.  Don’t fool yourself.  Every investor at TerrorXchange is a bull investor.  Riding IZBM from $5 to $120 doesn’t give you the Golden Bear Award of Congenial and Fair Trading.  It simply means you’re not a dumb ass for dropping it too early.  You made %2400 on that investment, then you gradually sold it off to invest in other things.  Why did you sell it off?  Are there no more Israelis to blow up?  Or did you in your clairvoyance realize that the stock wasn’t worth more than a buck twenty?  Face it. You used IZBM and when you were finished with it, you dumped it like a cheap sorority girl.  Everyone’s a bull….so what kind of bull will you be?  Wait till the cows come home, or run down to the pasture and get yourself a fat heifer?  I’ll explain.  How much money can you make in four months?  I’ve been on TerrorXchange for nearly two months and have turned my one million into thirteen million (%1300).  Yesterday, Darius wasn’t on the Leader Board, but today he jumped to #3 with 58 million (at least %1000).  How long will it take you to double your net worth?  Triple?  How much money will the BUSH strike make for you?  It’s a simple formula.  Open up your portfolio (assuming you invested in BUSH) and plug-in the values.  (200) / (Current Price BUSH) = x (Total Value BUSH) * x = (Future Value BUSH) (Net Worth) - (Total Value BUSH) + (Future Value Bush) – (Total Value GORE) = y  Now to the important question: is’y’ worth not doing ANYTHING for four months?  Even if ‘y’ is 50 million dollars, you can exceed that amount in four months with solid bull trading.  Keep in mind, this post only applies to the 14,784 investors whose accounts aren’t insanely bloated.  $100 million dollars is difficult to triple simply because you have to buy that many more shares for each stock.  The top five or six investors may be wiser to wait for a strike, I wish them luck.    Regardless, there is nothing ‘bear’ about waiting for a strike, in fact it’s bullish.  You’re waiting for a big return before your sell…in the end, you always sell.  But this return is slow in coming.  Imagine a bull in a wheelchair.  What’s the point?  If you’re too bloated, fine, take the wheelchair.  Otherwise charge the market and tackle the heifers.  Equities folks, that’s where the party’s at.  I will see you there.

       urlLink 100 iraqis are dead in the latest insurgent uprising.   Still, the handover of power in Iraq is less than six days away.  How long will the new Iraqi government last (IRGD, $15.28)?  Will the Iraqi prime minister survive his first month in office (IPMA, $33.34)?  This is what TerrorXchange is about.  Putting your money on catastrophic meteors, dirty bombs, and terror attacks on (southern) Florida is like pulling the big red handle of the slot machine.  Hit the blackjack table instead, at least you have a fighting chance.

      Good news: I made the  urlLink Leader Board . Bad news: Only because it was extended from the top 20 to top 50 (good idea though).  Lots of new names, and only one new Steve (Stephen).  There's also a Boomsha, a Roosh, and a Pieter.

      The first thing I noticed was my net worth.  I never knew a load of laundry would cost me 1.8 million dollars, but it had.  IRGD had plummeted from $28.02 to $6.95.  That explained it.  But why?  Yahoo News said nothing of importance (an Olsen twin has an eating disorder, BFD).  There were no News Flash items at Fark or TotalFark. I had half-expected a "Sunnis, Shiites, Kurds, Al Qai'da acknowledge Iraqi Government, France surrenders", but that took care of everything in the real world.  Thank you,  urlLink TX blog .  I refreshed the Equity screen twice before I realized the stock was Strike.  And there she was, IPMA, at $22.  I would have picked some up, but I had $3 in the bank.  (SUGGESTION: a Quick Sell field for each stock in the Portfolio and a Submit All button).  Look to my portfolio.  IRGD will rebound, keep it. This other stock?  Yes, keep it. How about this one? Yes, but you can make money elsewhere for now.  Sell it.  Back to the Strike Stock screen.  IPMA, $29.  Fuck.  It’s barely in my price range at this point, and the SOB that just took my 1.8 million terror dollars is going to sell at any moment.  No way is he going to screw me twice in ten minutes.  Fortunately IRGD smiled, she was still at $6.95…buy it. IRGD was now $7.50, but I was broke again.  Back to the portfolio.  I didn’t care what it was, I sold it, and with that money I bought IRGD.  I bought a lot.  The final damage: -$400,000.  But for what I gained, it was a bargain that would make Sam Walton proud.  Let’s see what happens next.  If I can leap two Steves in a single bound it will be a good day.  If I can leap a John, it will be an excellent day.  Three lessons learned: 1. Get XML. 2. In case of emergency, have at least $500,000 in cash and know which stocks you should sell first. 3.  A small fish can miss an IPO and still make money, but he has to ride the wake of the big fish with the better gains.

      My portfolio has been incredibly stagnant all week long.  I broke ten million yesterday for about five minutes, then the market took yet another hit.  Has anyone else been having similar problems?   My first few targets on the Leader Board have remain unchanged.  It seems the stream is flowing against me, but I've slowly been making progress.  I have the next few days off Satori, give us some IPOs! :)

      As detailed over at  urlLink The FCC's Worst Nightmare ,  urlLink the Christopher C. account  was purged.  Essentially the market lost $80 million dollars, and though much of this was cash, the purge was still felt on the market. Fortunately I had only invested in a few of those stocks.  Though they dropped below the original price I invested, I picked up more shares to even out the average paid.  I should be making more money on the rebound.  Today is a great day to invest.

      "Olympic torch extinguished by unnatural causes"  I suggested this stock to Satori (as a joke...kind of), however the torch has already made most of its way through the United States.  Four years ago the torch was nearly extinguished by a group of kids in Europe.  They attacked the torch with cups of water, and almost made it, but were soon subdued by security.  The  urlLink torch was again attacked  by a 17yr old and a fire extinguisher in Sydney just prior the 2000 Olympic games.  So close.  Why is the torch a good target?  Is it because it symbolizes the unity of nations?  Is it because millions of dollars are spent on support and security staff?  Is it because it seems so silly when blokes like Tom Cruise get to carry it?  I don't know.  But I do know if I ever have the opportunity to extinguish the "fire that burns in us all" in perhaps the biggest international prank in history, I'm going for it.  Who's with me?

      5 Gmail invites - want one?  This post is mostly unrelated to TerrorXchange, sorry. I have five gmail invites I'd like to give to my fellow investors.  TerrorXchange has their own gmail account, now you can be cool like them.  Please email me or leave a comment.

      Readers of my blog very likely read the other four TerrorXchange blogs as well.  In case you have been living under a rock, check out  urlLink Hoodlumman's TX "Insider" View .  His weekend stock-to-watch is  (SAUD) US Imposes Sanctions on Saudi Arabia for Links to Al Qaeda . There's great background information over at  urlLink WiredCrusader .  In other news, the Leader Board (High Scores board as someone humorously put it)  very  briefly dipped to ~9.2 million yesterday, but returned to ~10.5 million.  This means there are very few people between me and #20.  How exciting.  About %40 of my net worth is cash, so my current position is very strong.  I have to go back to work today, that's right folks, the Bull is gone until tonight.  Have fun. :)

       urlLink Vice President Cheney testified today  that he gave orders to shoot down the hijacked planes of 9/11.  But imagine if those orders had been followed in time.  What then?  "September 12th: Bush orders hijacked planes shot down, 300 Americans dead."  Holy political fiasco Batman!  Do you think we would would have known what was GOING to happen?  Do you think we would have known that the the fuel would burn hot enough to melt the structures of the twin towers, and that 2700 people would die?  Do you think President Bush would taken the heat for everything that happened, do you think President Bush would still be the President today?  Damned if you do, damned if you don't.  I wonder how safe we really are.  I wonder if a politician's actions are geared towards reelection or concern for public safety.  If President Bush had shot down the planes, what would Kerry be saying now?  Politics (by that I mean Democrats and Republicans) will disagree no matter what the cause.  Are we solving anything? Are we making the world a better place?  I'm eternally skeptical.

      The hoopla died down quickly and the Leader Board is unchanged.  I sold off all my strike stocks, as I'm positive the prices will go down sometime between now and September.  At strike values of $150, it may be worth the risk of letting them run to $0.  For now, there are other things to invest my money in.

      Strike Stocks are the new hotness, and boy are they hot.  In five minutes I made two million dollars, and I had missed the IPOs by about ten minutes (purchasing stocks four and five times higher than their opening price).  Fortunately, the Leader Board is stagnant.  Unfortunately, someone made more money on these strike stocks than I.  This means that soon (perhaps within the hour) the threshold for Leader Board will rise to thirteen or fourteen million.  Do I believe their will be a terror attack at RCON or DCON?  No.  Everyone wants a piece of these new Strike Stocks, the question is how soon their novelty will wear off.

      What am I missing?  The strike stocks sound great....but they'll look similar to other stocks won't they?  I've liquified nearly half of my portfolio, apparently everyone else is doing the same.  Meanwhile the market is falling and some shares are the lowest they've been.  Perhaps I should pick up those shares and forget about the strike stocks?

      I blame the TX blog.  I was doing so well, probably because very few people were paying attention to the market.  But now things are moving quickly, and with my menial summer job, it's very hard to keep up.  Strike Stocks are coming, I've sold off a few of the fat stocks so I can go shopping.  Let's see what happens next...

      A little bit (a damn dry bit) about me and TerrorXchange ...  I started one month ago.  It took me two weeks to earn my first million.  In the last two weeks, I've gone from two to seven million (almost broke eight before the little dip).  In another week or two I hope to be on the Leader Board, if only at the very bottom.  The one word of advice I have for new users is 'patience'.  The first million was incredibly difficult to earn, from there it gets much easier.  I don't have much more advice, though if you have some I'm eager to listen.  I have a strategy which works well now, a strategy which I will glady share once it no longer works for me.  I am already beginning to draw up a plan of attack for moving large sums of money around the market, we'll see how that works.  In the meantime I'm taking advantage of larger investments and a more diversified portfolio.  Do I have a background in investment?  Nope.  I remember a few key terms from Micro and Macro Economics in college, but that's it.  My degree in poli sci has helped, as has my subscription to TotalFark (Fark.com) for breaking news.  Counter to that, I finally found myself a summer job, consequently I've missed some great IPOs (but now I can pay off my student loans, a trade-off).    One of the things I wish to gain from TerrorXchange is a better understanding of the stock markets.  I've always wanted to invest in a real market, but felt for all my ignorance and inexperience, I was better off gambling away my money in Vegas.  Anyway, props to Satori and the nameless other for creating TerrorXchange.  I hope this site continues to be enjoyable for them as it is for me.

      Human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together...mass hysteria!  Or not.  Last night the actions of just one trader revealed the shaky confidence of bullish TerrrorXchange investors.   My portfolio dipped 30%, fortunately I had enough for a feeding frenzy in the morning.  I'm up to 95% of my previous holdings, with an even better outlook tomorrow.

      Is it wrong to hope the Iraqi Prime Minister is assassinated by Saturday at midnight?  I'm holding on to 100,000 shares of IPMA, and will likely lose half a million.  You never know. :)

      Modesty is "in", skanky is "out".  Forgive me for this Fab 5 moment, I had to share  urlLink this article .  The short of it is that modest clothing is coming back in style.  What's not said is that young women are realizing they don't have the bodies of models, that revealing their belly buttons, pelvic lines, and then playing a drum solo on their bellies is rather gross.  I see it all day at my summer job, I can confirm that anorexia is no longer a problem. I digress.  Here's the best part of the article:   The modesty trend is also tied to the political climate, says Stellin. "There's this sense of uncertainty — about the economy, the threat of terrorism, the war in Iraq, the (Abu Ghraib) prison scandal. These are big issues in people's minds, issues that call for more-serious clothing."    Uh huh. I'm sure the thoughts and concerns of Hillary Duff and 17yr old girls everywhere are with political and religious conflict abroad.  I'm sure their sleepovers are raging with debates of American prisoner abuse and the plight of third-world farmerss.

      Spread The Word!!!  From the sound of things, TerrorXchange is about to undergo many changes.  Let's spread the word, this community needs more users!  I did a google search for TerrorXchange and found the website, but other search terms such as  urlLink terror exchange ,  urlLink terror stock market ,  urlLink TX ,  urlLink current events , don't turn up the  urlLink leading website for political analysis, forecasting, and emergency preparedness .  User blogs show up on Google...what a grand opportunity to help the TX get more hits.

      +10 million terror dollars, +10 Leader Board tiers, my account will still be here tomorrow, I gotta say it was a good day.  In other news, $4.88 for IZIR is more reasonable than $133, but we already figured that. This brings into question the latest nipple slippage on the TX, the (reoccurring) gaming of user  urlLink Glathannus K.  and his subsequent purge.  Were Glathannus' actions in violation of the user agreement? Yes.   The reasoning is simple: the TX is market that seeks honest analysis and prediction of world events.  I will grant that IZIR is a silly stock, that Glathannus' actions hurt no users and hardly put a dent into the integrity of the TX.  Nevertheless, his actions were a blatant run at the Leader Board and were not in tune with the spirit of the TX.   Glathannus, I say this as sincerely as possible as I appreciate your blog, your insight, your presence, but you were warned.  I was under the assumption that your 240 million was mostly liquid, but apparently not.  What was your point?  For what greater purpose did you fool us all?  In the  urlLink comments  you made it seem like that the system is faulty for allowing purchases in excess of 99,999 shares.  I hope that was not in reference to my previous post.  I was concerned with exponential inclines, you were concerned with having a large penis.  You also noted that eventually you would have lost money to an honest trader.  I ask again, WHAT WAS YOUR POINT?  When you sold off IZIR, you were going to lose a lot of money and end up in the 50-60 million range, perhaps less, and your Leader Board position would have been further compromised by the strike payouts of other traders.  What was your plan?  Sell off IZIR just before the next IPO hounding?  You didn't even have the juevos to admit your transgressions  urlLink when others called you on it . You lied on your blog.  I have to say, as I think about this more, your actions become increasingly shameful, shallow, and pointless.

      24 Hour Moratoriums    What if users were only allowed to purchase 99,999 shares of a stock in a 24-hour period, with no restrictions on selling?    A new user with one million in cash can't buy 400,000 shares of a stock, especially when that stock is an IPO and someone with ten million in cash wants to go shopping.    Under the current system we experience urlLink  exponential growth  for veteran users. By implementing this moratorium of sorts, we can force the incline down to a realistic level while at the same time shifting it left.    This means we won't have billionaires for at least a year, this means new users are not shut-out of the marketplace, this means stocks will be valued more for their description and less for their current price, this means no more IPO mind games.     update: I just noticed Glathannus' unprecedented jump. I am not singling out any users. Presented with his opportunities NONE of us would have acted differently.  urlLink This is an opportunity no one should have.

      Retiring the Color Coded Warning System  Citing non-specific threats,  urlLink Tom Ridge warned today   that Al Qaeda was planning to disrupt the US presidential vote this November.  What's interesting is that the color-coded warning system was not raised, despite Al Qaeda's overwhelming success in Spain.  Could the warning level already be antiquated?  Was the warning level ever really more than an opiate?  Most importantly for TX traders, will Homeland Security Discontinue the Color Coded Threat Warning System (COLR)?  When COLR was  urlLink announced , it wasn't given must attention.  As it stands, the stocks is only $6.53 ($5.08 when I picked it up this morning).  The DNC (DCON) and RNC (RCON) will soon be upon us, it will be interesting to see what happens.  As for COLR, this may be a long-term stock.  Cancelling the warning system now will appear as a failure on the part of Tom Ridge and likely hurt President Bush's reelection.  There are many things that can be done to improve our Intelligence and secure our communities.  I believe there will be major policy shifts announced at the next State of the Union Address, for now President Bush must ensure he makes it that far.  Vote Republican. ;)

      Resolved: Iraq is here to stay.  This is a good thing, and I'm glad the Iraqi Prime Minister has survived this long.    The bombings of the Christian churches was unexpected.  My initial thought was  "Better the christians than the US Soldiers".   Jesus wept, I half-apologized, we changed the subject.   I expected the Iraqi dissidents to continue fighting  their  new government, not move immediately to that age-old religious clash.  At this point I would almost like to see them build a wall...at least then you know there are two sides, and that makes things less confusing.  Oh, and the  urlLink influx of hispanics is threatening to divide Amerca .  An interesting read.
