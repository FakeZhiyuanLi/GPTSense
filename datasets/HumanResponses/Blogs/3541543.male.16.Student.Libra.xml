      for me it hard to find a measurable signifcance of my life. knowing that i am less then a speck of dust when compared to the universe, often whatever my goals or intentions feel worthless and pointless to begin. being agnostic, i have a plethora of unanswered and probably unanswerable questions about life and its meaning. sometimes i get the feeling of why do i even exist, the only reason i feel that i am here is because i was just born and thats all there is to it. sometimes i think for the way that our brains have evolved and put emotions and feelings into something cummunicatable, we have stressed and bended the real reason we are living. i believe that underneath the facade of emotion and attachment to things we are all just animals. we are just animals with instincts, but we change the reasons for our actions.   if this is so why the need for morality and regret. how come in god's eyes humans are more significant than a dog or a mosquito. we all live and mate and the new generation begins. a dog's life is simple; eat, sleep, hump, and die. argh things so complicated i cant even explain what i think clear enough. ugh i dont know, its just that whenever i think about how big everything really is i cant put meaning on the reason i am living.   some would say i need to become a christian and look to the bible for answers. my morality, forgiveness, and kindess are better than some people who call themselves christians. the bible is a great book and it teaches a lot of good things and shows how human society can exist peacefully. but the bible is at fault, i mean how can the real word of god be transcribed and fully understood by a crude human race that did not even know the concept of the rain cycle. like greek mythology they had gods MADE for everything they could not understand, and blamed god's for natural disasters that they also did not know why it occured. same thing happens in the bible yet its just one universal god that does it.  some people say all you need is to have faith in god. well, to me faith is like being blind or ignorant to fact. i dont have that faith, the faith i need that will make me feel content with the reality that some day im going to die. im so afraid of dying and losing this insignificant life of mine. afraid to go to sleep and not wake up ever again. if only i had that faith, to replace my fears and fill it with hope and a feeling of content. id love that peace of mind.   but what do i know? im just a teenager with a little bit above-average intelligence. how could i possibly discern and put meaning to things i have yet to go through. yet im compelled to question what adults tell me to believe in. my hope or faith is that someday i will realize and figure out what i am living for.  as for now all i am doing is trying to be the absolute best person i can be. i am striving to be more a more understanding person. i am trying to forgive more, i trying to better myself for all around me. idk i just want to be there for anybody who feels they need me. haha im getting to become a better friend to most if not all. everyone can try and be a better person, and thats what i feel content on doing. i want to be that guy that people call on if they feel they need to talk or need help or just want to hang out and chill. haha im also trying to become a girls dream guy. i want to be perfect for whoever i love. idk i just want to do anything in order to make their life a blissful one. i place that person first and foremost and i can/have changed habits for them. lol that is sorta hard to explain actually but it will more explained when i talk about my views on family and relationships and stuff like that.  ash told me that she doesnt know if its right to date a non-christian. well really that's ok, everyone has their own beliefs. i can change some things about myself but i cant change this, and i understand if you dont want to b/c u feel that way. lol this post is prolly unsettling for some who know me. but do not fret or get all sad and stuff for me if you do feel so. for the daily nuisances of life and things like that shall push this depressing thought in the back of my head. it always does, i was bored today and my mind had wandered into it. lol all i can do is wake up do whatever i need or want to, the answers can come later. um anyways ill see yall later

      here are some things that i did/happened today  1) went to beach early in the morning say around 9:30. at first waves werent impressive, then later on it got much much better and i headed out on my body board. i think im going to go pro body boarder, i was just tearing it up. a little to my right there was a gathering of teenagers as they were getting their free surf lessons. i totally want to do that but alas i have no surfboard:( anyways, while i was out body boarding my brother decides to take pictures of me, i can only assume im making weird faces like i just smelled something really bad. hope they come out so i can post them.  2) came back from beach and ate lunch. after that went to store and got a couple of  things. as my grandma started pulling out she tapped a huge truck with her rear bumper. she is a terrible driver....we sped off before they could catch us haha.  3) got back home and chilled.  4) after dinner, my brothers and i decided to head out on the paddle boat and fish for a bit. as we head out we noticed the wind was pretty darn strong. we under estimated this and soon found out we could not for the life of us paddle back to the dock. with the wind pushing us to the neighbor dock we were forced to camp out there for a little bit. brother jon decides to try and pull us up to the end of the dock and see if we can V line it back to our dock. all i can say is that it didnt work, next thing my brothers part of the boat is filled with water and we are stuck again. nothing to do but wait for my grandpa to trudge through and pull us back to our dock. grandma waiting on the dock, when we get near she says "i wish i had the camera, or better yet the video camera. then i could show this to ashleigh." wtf now my brothers and my grandma are being idk...  5) eat dessert and chill some more.  some thoughts:  1. dunno why i keep putting off asking to see if ash can go to bahamas. i cant really say im embarrassed cuz im not. 2. gabe and ash fought again, but after idk a few days gabe will give in and make up and apologize like the last 80 times. i dont mind cept i have low opinion of gabe and the arguing takes time away from ash talking to me cuz she is too busy fighting.  3. gabe is an alright character although he is a selfish ass. this kind of thing comes and goes, but he really pissed me off and i havent talked to him since. i find myself much happier haha.  4. lol idk how she does it or makes me think like this but ash is the most beautiful person ive seen. idk it may just a whole collection of things that are appealing. she is a bit crazy at times and her mood and feelings change too often and quickly for me to really try and get something going for a while. im slowly reverting back but i hoping i going at it very slowly so i dont get myself in trouble. haha their are no promises or gaurantees when it comes to this woman. 5. no one ever reads the crap i put up hear but i dont really care. i do it for myself, so then i can look back and realize how much of a geek and dork i was back then.  6. i hope my dads safe and well in iraq. i also hope he loses some weight, he is up to 200 lbs!! i think my dad looks like a chubby adam sandler, but that has only been me. 7. summer away from friends sorta blows. i wanna be back and amongst them. 8. asked aaron what he thought about ash and i maybe getting back together or whatever. he said i was retarded lol, and i can see why. eh i maybe well stupid, all my friends say "no, stay away from that girl. she is gonna play you." it sucks that i go one way and everyone else goes the other. ive tried changing and i couldnt.  9. ash said she is gonna stop doing the website thing, and i was really looking forward to her making one for or of me:( oh well such is life.  10. harry potter kicks ass!!! i get to go see it tomorrow and im stoked. 11. me being extremely ticklish to ash's touch makes me very vunerable. im the giggling little girl during tickle fights. she beat me in arm wrestling which i guess sad for most guys, i dont mind it really lol she can protect herself. 12. im funny when i really try not to be. like i do some pretty dumb stuff and make an ass of myself at the expense of my self esteem. numerous comments about my package have been made and all i can do is smile and laugh. i feel i have a good sense o humor when it comes to things. except sprints hyper active moments which jsut piss me off.  lol thats all for now folks. see all yer fellers later.

      well lets see...i think im just going to talk about some thoughts or whatever cuz i dont get good ideas often and everything like that so here goes.  1)i really really suck at golf. i beat my brothers but considering that was like almost 20 over par on a par 3 golf course(every hole is par 3 no hole larger than 90 yds). highlight of any golf game for me is driving the golf cart, soon i wanna skip the having to golf part and just get a kart to drive around in.  2)i think that the "dont be totally open with your bf/gf it will just push him away" is a dumb thing to think or tell people. id love to know how the other person felt, it sucks enough trying to figure out what a chick wants or feels like when u dont tell us and give us complicated hints or whatever. seriously i have to replay things over and over to finally think something is right to only get it wrong. but then again it just depends on the situation like say ur doing something you dont really wanna do but ur gf/bf really wants to, just bear with it and dont go "this sucks!" that just makes things worse. haha but what the hell do i know ive only been in one relationship, but with one of the most simple yet complicated chick ever. eh but what the hell, i believe its worth it.  3) lmao i got the fugging weirdest fortune cookie ever, it said: "you long to see the great pyramids of egypt". WTF kind of fortune is that haha. if anyone else has any "real" funky, messed up fortunes i wanna see if you can beat that one lol.  4)i hope brittany starts to thoroughly enjoy her free time from school. and i doubt you will be stuck at the Y till your 18. sucks i couldnt work in the nursery with you, damn people at the Y. what happened to equal oppurtunity employment.  5)i think pokemon is/was pretty fun. i often find myself singing the theme song to the cartoon all the time. and i sing it to piss off my brothers when we stuck in the car by ourselves. and i CANNOT sing lol so its a great time.  6)i think i going to bahamas for spring break but not totally certain seeing its months away. hoping ash is able to come with, i think it would be an awesome experience. after bahamas next destination will be greece, homeland to 1/4th of myself. and it is suppose to be pretty wicked cool there, ancient ruins and all.  7)secret window with jonny depp looks pretty good and i wanna see it sometime. too bad my brother saw it already and fugging told me the end, argh he pisses me off.  8)saw incubus on tv and i think they tried too hard to be cool. they are dorks but i love them still, the best band ever.  9)listening to flake and song makes me think of ash, i mean the title and everything fit so well. jack johnson is freaking crazy awesome and this song and tons of other songs are just killer.   10)going to the beach tomorrow and stomach hair is in bad shape, i am a fool for shaving a damn fool. i cant wait till winter comes haha then ill let it grow back. going to the beach i really wish i had my friends their to enjoy it with me. the beach just doesnt seem all its cracked up to be without people to share it with. next time im going i hoping i can get a couple of buds to come and just tear it up on the body board haha.   mk well thats all i can show you about my thoughts, gotta keep it nice and clean. and oh yeah britt if you start checking the blog out please do not scroll down and read the early stuff. its a load of retarded crap and i regret having writing down what i did lol. alright see ya later

      sorry i havent been doing my job providing a bunch of gay crap no one wants to read. im bored and my incredibly painful headache has receded enough to where i can read and type. well anyways my summer has gone by pretty well so far, having to rely on my brothers for company being away from my friends is a royal pain since they annoy the hell out of me. i also realized im terribly annoyed by my gma (i call her YAYA cuz she is greek and thats how u say gma so..). she watches the news a lot and is therefore paranoid over are safety and needs. She asks "are you sure?" five damn times before it sinks in that in fact we are perfectly fine. we have been raised basically to take care of ourselves since my mom is the only parent and is either working or partying with her young female friends. she has a boyfriend also and that takes up a lot of her time also. but as long as we are fed we dont mind it much. oh well here are some recents thoughts ive had: 1. i think i can run for president and win, ive already got three votes behind me. ill be damned if i let sprint win.  2. went to dairy queen and got fat eating the most chocolate thing they had...going there reminded me of this pick up line "ill be your burgerking if youll be my dairy queen"...something like that. 3. im pretty sure sprint spelled eunich wrong, also got kicked in the nuts...tough break man that sucks.  4. idk what im going to do for college got some sketchy plans, i just want to stay near friends and if things work out its gonna be fanfuggingtastic going college. im guessing thats because i lack the ability to go out and meet people. this is why i have few friends lol but hey im not complaining. i think my friends are pretty outstanding characters. i doubt im going to go to umkc, they only accept 100 students and tuition for what am thinking of becoming is a quarter million.  5. i realized that looking back at "falling in love" with ash, i was a nutter. i cant believe i said some of the things i did. i admit to being over zealous and should have definately restrained my emotions and listened to my friends. i have a quote from a song by pedro the lion called rejoice "wouldnt it be great if everything was meaningless, but everything is so meaningful. and most everything turns to shit" i feel i tried to hard and missed the real point in being in a relationship. i realized that my constant worrying and flirting with jealousy wasnt a happy time. i am happier when there is real stress and i can see why ash is so reluctant to get into these things. so from now on i resolve to be laid back and calm. i feel incredibly stupid for acting how i did back then.  6. harry potter is fugging awesome. ive been reading that fifth book and im almost done. i had forgotten how good the books were, i suggest reading the last three cuz those were the best. the story grips you from start to finish and i totally forgot how good the prisoner of azkaban book was. i totally wanna see the movie and see all those dementors and see the boggart and all the nerdy stuff.  7. reading the book for most of the day...got a major headache and eyes hurts for a long time. glad im almost done.  8. dick, cock, faggot, cunt, and tits sounds really vulgar and gross words. i really dont like hearing them and saying them makes me wanna wash my mouth out with soap. but hey maybe im just being childish calling tits "boobs" or dick "penis". maybe cock is a mature word..idk i just dont like them. and the way the word faggot is used today pisses me off, its a disgusting word and being called it many a time from assholes i hate that word with a passion.  9. these are some people i wish didnt exist: ....um maybe i shouldnt put them up cuz ill be in for a beating and with some of the people i was gonna put on..prolly a stabbing. for that reason im not going to any carnival or wok and roll for a while. 10. i thoroughly dislike bastards who sue people and corporations for their own stupidity. fugging coffee is a given HOT LIQUID you cant live for what 50 years and not get the notion of coffee not being hot. and idk if i become president ill get rid of the a**holes who let these retards win so vote for me 20 years from now and my name is on that ballot. 11. went to the beach and was kickin it on the body board, decided to be cool and ride on my back. felt like a dumba** later and shouldn't have done it in the first place. i also get a rash under my armpit that lasts for just a couple of hours. no idea how i get them unless from rubbing but really.....i have no clue 12. head sometimes gets really itchy, i am concerned bout lice and some sea critters that can do that sort of stuff to ya.  13. im hoping i did well on the ACT, national average something like 20 or 22. im gunning for about 28-36. dont know if its going to happen because i saw the percentage of corrections to get write and im pretty sure i didnt come to par with them. 14. now that sprint has horses i looke forward to riding them and becoming an asian cowboy. ill start to learn cowboy lingo, give myself a drawl and put r's where they shouldnt be like "idears". i hear "idears" a lot and i think its pretty cool.   well those were my idears or thoughts or whatever see yer later

       This is just some random thought that or prediction you might say. After extensive time taking into consideration all of the possibilities I've come to the conclusion that Asian's will rule and become the only race alive. Quite terrifying but true at the same time. I'm gonna list my points and theories:  1. Asian's account for more than 1/6 of the WORLD's population and thats just in China alone. We multiply exponentialy, like rabbits hyped up on redbull and viagra. I know this because I get you know whats ALL the damn time and it's fustrating. We are so horny we draw cartoons with the craziest stuff you will ever freakin see.   2. There are soo many Asian's we are spilling out everywhere, you can find Asians in any part of the world. In the future everyone will be so overwhelmed with this that they just die out and are forced to mingle and soon the mutts will be weeded out.   3. Asians are damn smart and make freaking robots that can move and will soon carry lasers with destructible powers. Asians make tons of electronics and we make all of the happy meal toys. Asians are invaluable and you can't live without them but you can't live with them either.  4. Um........oh hell yeah I forgot, Asian's know karate and can really kick your ass. Too bad they too into video games.   Well there you go I have some more ideas and stuff just that I gotta get to bed and all. Anyways I know its hard to believe just look at the points im making this plan and theory is flawless. I know I'm part Asian and all, frankly FULL Asians freak me out. Small beady eyes, and the flat nose, and short. Most look really creepy and look really bad with any facial hair. Asian women are annoying, omfg especially when they sing or talk in Chinese or whatever. All that high-pitched squealing is nerve racking. My mom is a great example, I seriously can't see how anybody think Asian women are hot. If anyone else know's of or has a theory they would like to submit then just post it here. see ya later

      The day I left for vacation I got a haircut from my mom who is a hairstylist. But since I don't pay for it she gives me this shoddy, crappy haircut. It just sucks and later that day I was having lunch at Del Rio with Ash and the waitress says "How's it going ladies?". What the crap was that I got a short hair cut and she thinks I'm a woman! Yeah it sucked and I felt bad because my hair was dumb and I looked like a girl. She probably she I was a dike but yeah lol I can't wait for it to grow back. Alright well see ya later.

      Today I listened to Incubus on our little road trip to NC. And I blasted this same song over and over again, and it got me thinking that something was up. Well prior to this I practically spent the whole night wide awake thinking about one person. And yes you guessed it right, Ash. I don't know why considering all that's happened and just being friends and all. Right now I thinking that I think way too much and it just complicates things. I think that messes everything up and idk what else. Feels like I'm going down and all too familiar path. Haha I have no clue why I get like this, I'm thinking I am just 16 and I shouldn't be trying to get all how I am. I need to be carefree and fun and loose. lol but I feel so uptight and I guess that's because I think too much. Oh well Incubus is totally awesome and the album Make Yourself is immensely wicked (britt ;)), I was listening to "I Miss You". Here are some lyrics:  To see you when I wake up is a gift I didn't think could be real to know that you feel the same as I do is a three-fold utopian dream  You do something to me that I can't explain so would I be out of line, if I said I miss you  I see your picture, I smell your skin on the empty pillow next to mine you have only been gone ten days but already I am wasting away  I know I'll see you again whether far or soon but I need you to know that I care and I miss you (I miss you)   Good stuff I tell ya. Mk well lol after saying all this I don't know what to think. Should I keep myself in this mode or change? I thinking change because I'm getting ahead of myself and over zealous or whatever. I'm gonna calm down and whatever happens will happen. Alright I got to shower see ya later.

      Well I'm here in Arkansas on the beginning of my summer vacation. So far off to a really bad start. First off I had to stay in the very back part of a truck with a camper on it for like 4 hours and it was all hot and sweaty and dirty. Next we get to the hotel and that's all cool and stuff, I swam a little and today I found out I could get internet going on my laptop which is way coolio. But other than that it has sucked, I had to meet my stepmom's side of the family who were all total hicks and really old and fat. We all met at Ryan's Family Steak House which didn't go well with my stomach. I had a stomach ache this morning from the hotel breakfast. anyways omgosh it was nasty, I was watching this one fat chick eat and FOOD FELL ON HER BOOBS and she didn't even realize till a minute later. I almost gagged, I felt so out of place being tan and not fat. I don't know if I should feel bad for feeling superior because I getting weird feelings of like being better than someone. I shouldn't get that feeling right but really it disgusted me and that I disgusted myself for feeling like Hitler. but yeah I miss people already and this is going to be a long five weeks lmao. Here I am in the hotel lobby writing this down and not having as good a time as I should be having. Hopefully NC will be much better to me.   Well there are some good things that have happened to me so far. I bought a couple of decks of cards so I can play "poophead" which is totally awesome and I also bought some uno cards and I have been playing that with my brothers which is fun until they start being buttheads about it. I got some gatorade and I got to swim and my huge summer problem is now just a minor summer problem. My mom got me some different shaving gel lol and a razor that prevents razor burn which I guess is what I had. I tested it out last night and now my belly is back to smooth, but still the red bumps prior are there but no more irritation so yeah that turned out good. I'm hoping for a fun vacation and it will definately get better when I get back home. All of this traveling would be much more fun if I had a friend along but no just my brothers and family. mk well see ya later.

      Alright Sprint I know you pissed and I can understand why. I didn't know I was planning too many things at a time. I'm sorry but your not going alone, you said your brother was going also. I say if you don't want to go alone sell your ticket on Ebay. And then sometime later we all can go man, I don't want to pass up this time with Ash and not because I WORSHIP her. I am not obsessed, considering this camp thing wasn't recent at all. I thought I mentioned that I couldn't go sometime before all of this. But I really like her even though lots of things happened that don't make sense to me. Right now my feelings the only thing that seem right to me, and maybe I am being blinded by her awesome charisma. lol but there isn't much anything anyone can do to change that except Ash, and I'm going to see this all the way through even if I crash and burn. To me it's still worth the shot and we are friends man, don't start thinking that we going to get back together real soon. I know what happened and I'm going to do whatever it takes to prevent that. Idk if you saw Ash how I did than you would understand my insanity lol. Just let me live how I'm going to, and I know this makes me sound like an A**hole but really you can't change how I feel. Let me learn on my own, lol here is a proverb I'm going by "fall off horse seven times, get up eight times". Good things happen to those who wait and thats exactly what I'm doing. Don't think it's just Ash and me again. We aren't together and she can do what she pleases, just like I can do whatever I want. And if I want to wait for her I will, and she wants to go out and have fun while I'm gone so be it. It isn't me to decide what people can and cannot do.   I'm afraid that your perspective on this whole thing is unfinished because you are judging on what you see and know. And you don't know that much, nothing has changed between Ash and I. We aren't "together" and I am not obsessed and worship her even though I know how she wants me to ;) lol jk. Seriously I thought you knew about me not being able to go because you mentioned that to everyone "well this sucks, it looks like i have to go all by myself". Guess you were just kidding but I didn't realize that. Also don't think I being "saved" by going to a christian camp, I still stand by what I believe in. I don't need christian beliefs to make me a better person than I am. I already know what I stand for and the Bible teaches many good things, but I don't have to believe in God to be how I am. I'm already a good person and I try and be a better understanding, forgiving person. What can christianity do for me except subside my fear of death. And I'm not bashing religion idk I just find it far-fetched and full of unanswered questions. Aut yeah thats another post lol I'll save that for another day. Alright well I'm out see ya later.

I just want to say it was totally awesome that I got to see you the day before I left. I'm going to miss you a lot and I'm hoping for the best. And I will miss all my guy friends also, shayan, sprint, maher, kyle, forste, marsh and others. But I'm going to try and have fun without you all. Alright well that is it for now. see ya later

      Ok I sorta have this problem with summer coming and being shirtless and all. oh btw I'm terrible at telling stories and I always make them sound like you just had to have been there. Yeah I'm a bad storyteller and people just laugh when I try and tell something. I can make lots of things sound most uncool, anyways here it goes. A few weeks back I was sitting down looking at my stomach. Not a sight for sore eyes lemme tell ya haha. My stomach, especially down in the belly button region, is really really hairy. And the hairs were getting thick and curly. Not wanting to look like a guido at the beach I decided to do the worst thing imaginable and I shaved my whole front side. Not one cut or nick and all of the hair was gone. And boy was my belly smooth, I'm talking like freshly baby powdered baby butt smooth. And when I put a shirt on it felt really weird because it has been so long since my stomach touched cloth and not my belly hair. Well being proud of my new smooth belly I took a picture of it. And I showed a couple of my lady friends and got a thumbs up for a goodjob. But here is the problem  Not even a freaking day into this new smoothness I got hair coming back, and I rub it the wrong way and it hurts like a mofo. I'm telling myself what a freaking idiot SHAVING my stomach is totally retarded. Well fearing this already stubbly belly I shave again, but this time I draw blood!! and like a dumba** I put aftershave on my stomach. Holy crap it stung sooo bad and I'm still bleeding. After an hour the bleeding stop and now I got little red bumps on my stomach. Totally unattractive......and how am I suppose to go to the beach in NC with this sort of thing!! I feel so stupid, karma bit me well on the A**. I don't even care about my stomach hair, I'd rather have these nasty little bumps go away. My skin gets irritated easily I suppose. I don't know, I just feel gross. Anyways I got of my shaved belly prior to the whole mishap I got myself in.

      Tomorrow my grandparents are driving in from north carolina to pick up my brothers and I. Basically I'll be going all over the place this summer and I'll be gone for over 5 weeks!! Two weeks in NC, a week in Maryland to visit my aunt and her roomie, and two weeks with my stepmom in Arizona. Also a couple of days in Arkansas because my grandparents want to visit some stepmom family and stuff. Well being gone for five weeks is pretty harsh, no friends I'm just stuck with my brothers for 5 weeks haha. Dang this is going to suck. But yeah I have to do a lot of training and working out stuff for soccer if I plan to make Varsity this year. But I don't know because Jv is pretty fun. I like the no pressure no one gives a sh** attitude on Jv. Being the person blamed for losing the game is not my thing, especially since I'm always put on f**king defense. Yea lots of pressure their, and all that stress just makes me breakout and then that doubles the stress factor along with my crappy playing.   Summertime I get lazy and drink soda and just sit on my a** all day and watch boring tv shows. Not this summer darn it, I'm going to make something of myself. I'm going to get some abs, I'm going to be proud to wear my speedo. haha just kidding I don't wear speedos so so sorry to disappoint. Anyways, this summer will be a good summer. I have lots of things planned when I get back. I'm going to SPEC camp with Ashleigh and I can't wait. oh sh** I still need to sign up:| crap crap crap. I got to get on that right away in a sec. I also got soccer camps and I got a rafting trip down there in Noel Missouri. I can't make it to the incubus concert in KC because of the SPEC camp. I'm sorry Sprint, I know you think I'm totally freaking whipped and well maybe I am. I don't think I'll learn my lesson. Especially since I don't want to haha. alright well I got a problem I'm about to post up so see ya later.

      Alright well today I had just got back from a trip to Wendy's because I'm really hungry and....yeah I was hungry. I like Wendy's a lot, their chilli totally kicks butt. There is only one thing that pisses me off and it's the lettuce on the damn sandwich's. Shred the damn lettuce. I order a chicken sandwhich and I get a whole freaking leaf of lettuce. I don't wanna eat that hard thing in the middle of the lettuce. Wtf Wendy's shred or cut some lettuce up, it isn't that hard. Oh well I'm just a complainer but still the lettuce thing just gets to me. Anyways about my earlier post, I'm not going to finish up whatever I said I was. Also driving to Wendy's I happen to see a fat redneck chick that horrifyingly resembles Jabba the Hutt. Ah to live in southwest haha, it was gross. Just a big mass of flesh moving back and forth on a porch swing, eyeing everyone that passes by.....creepy. Alright well I'm going to be going now. see you all later.

      Seeing as how this is my first posting on this "blog" I'm just going to start off nice and easy by talking about me. Since by going to this you are obviously interested in knowing who I am....or you clicked on this by mistake and trying to see some hot chicks blog and hope for boobies. Well whatever the case your here now and that's all that matters. Right? Alright well enough small talk let's get down to business and I'll start off by telling you some things about me.  1) my name is Thomas something something. I'm sort of paranoid about identity theft, especially since those commercials I saw on the tv. The ones where some lady or dude is talking and it's like a totally different voice. I like the commercial, it has thoroughly (hope that's is how it's spelled) scared the crap out of me. So if you really want to know my full name I'm sorry because your probably one of those psycho identity theft people, I think no one really gives a care anyways.  2) My racial background is pretty abnormal I suppose. I'm half Korean, a quarter Greek, and a quarter English. Pretty crazy combination, I'm just glad I don't have squinty eyes and an awesomely flat nose. Since I put us on the topic of my physical appearance I shall give a somewhat brief/lengthy description. I am 5 feet 10 inches in height, not bad for Asians but that is pretty much it for me. I'm not going to grow anymore and will probably start shrinking very soon. I have tan skin, but I don't go to tanning booths because frankly I was born with tan skin and tanning in a booth I consider pretty dumb. We have this thing called the sun and you'll get less chance of skin cancer (I heard... I think I heard) and it's free. I'm all about free. Sorry, got a little off track there let's get back to business; I have black hair, brown eyes, ten fingers and ten toes, two nipples,two eyebrows (not one thank god) etc. nothing out of the ordinary. My hair is sorta medium in length, nothing extreme yet. I have all of my teeth haha. Oh yeah, I'm 16 and attending highschool. I will be a junior this fall. I live in Joplin, Missouri and have been for quite sometime. I'm going to have my friend show me how to put a picture of myself on here and hopefully it will go well with the ladies....I can only hope.   3) If you have gotten this far in my "blog" something is wrong and you are actually interested in knowing about me. So I'll tease you a little bit with my interests. I love soccer, it is by far my favorite sport. I play for my highschool team and some little rec leagues when the season isn't going on. I'm fairly decent at it also. Coach says I have lots of talent, I just need to get in better shape and stop being such a pussy (he is a great and encouraging coach). Today we had soccer practice at 7 p.m. and I wasn't last on one of our runs and I was happy and gave myself a pat on the back for a job well done. I also play tennis and just started my sophomore year. Tennis has been pretty fun and I had a good time playing even though I was second to last in the team rankings at one point during the season. Yeah I suck at tennis so what, as long as I'm better than sprint I'm cool with that. I'm also a huge fan of Incubus, I love their music and I have a couple of dvd's and most of their cd's. I am pretty selective about what I listen to, I mostly listen to: Incubus, Jack Johnson (he is a cool guy and his songs are totally boss), Pedro The Lion (very sad music which I listen to whenever I having problems), smile empty soul, kings of leon, lots of other alternative typ bands. I can't really stand country or rap or r&b or hip hop or ska and probably some other thing I've failed to recall.   Alright, well I'm very very tired and staying up this late or early or whatever isn't good for me. I'll finish this up as soon as possible. Besides this one post looks super long as it is and yeah that's it for now. see you later.

      well today...or a few days ago i had the knack to make my relationship with ash go splat. everything was going so well and i was very happy until i talked to her on msn either wednesday or thursday. she mentions to me that Garrett was having make all these promises about getting married and all that crap. well she says "ok" to it all, and im thinking wtf. i mean im with her and he is doing all this stuff, trying to get in her pants and stuff. no i dont like that and it pisses me off, and i dont like garrett for several reasons 1. he is freshmen 2. he thinks he is cool 3. the stuff he tries to do with ash 4. asks too many damn questions. anyways after hearing her say 'Ok" i say wtf why would u promise something like that. and she says "well you said your not into getting SERIOUS SERIOUS." (touche) feeling like i had to one up him or something, i have no freaking clue why, only later did i realize that those promises didnt mean anything.   after i said "well you always sorta look for that person" and i thought everyone did, but i didnt mean as in im picking you and all that. im was just saying that sometimes you wonder and think about it ya know. anyways bout right there i screwed it up, and right now we are in this weird zone. she doesnt want to talk to me i believe because i would prolly bring all this up and she would just get pissed and everything.   and i know this is just coincidince but sometimes it feels like the world is against me for being with her. Garret "ya know in few weeks she will prolly break up with you" Sprint "after SPEC i bet she is gonna dump you." also the fact that aaron said "uh oh&nbsp;thomas. ashleigh has&nbsp;internet back,&nbsp;better not talk to her on msn it will screw you up" (damn psychic). and also whenever gabe and ashleigh arent talking and being friends we do great, but as soon as gabe and ash start talking again its all messed up. and im not saying that this has any correlation to what happened, its just something im sure a few people have noticed.   anyways, i panicked and didnt explain clearly enough.&nbsp;i also believe ashleigh thinks the only reason i changed what i said was because katie told me&nbsp;to "DONT EVER MENTION MARRIAGE TO GIRLS LIKE ASHLEIGH......ETC." but come on ive known you for almost a year now and i know&nbsp;when ur weirded&nbsp;out or uncomfortable. &nbsp;im in this weird spot but i hoping we can just forget it,&nbsp; because it was just a misunderstanding&nbsp;and i&nbsp;really liked where we were a few days ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;i mean im just happy where we are and im only interested in you right now and im not into finding the girl im gonna marry. idk i hope you can understand what im trying to say ash.
