       And since I am so forkin' bored, I thought I'd vent for a bit.&nbsp; Until lunch anyway (which I am taking early, and extra-long, by the way).&nbsp; Hangin' a little today.&nbsp; Drank a few too many last night.&nbsp; Oh, well.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  So I'm dating this guy, Jim, right?&nbsp; And he lives in Marquette, so, in my eyes, it's nothing too serious.&nbsp; I do really like him, but the 6 1/2 hour drive between us makes it a teeny bit difficult to have&nbsp;a real relationship.&nbsp; So I'm talking to him on the tele the other night, and telling him that I've made the final decision to move to Houghton in June or so of next year.&nbsp; And he proceeds to tell me that when he's working in L'anse, he will be able to come and visit me.&nbsp; Then we're talking about my plans to get a rottweiler soon after moving up there, and he asks me if I'll let him take the dog on occasion.&nbsp; Now this probably seems all sweet and stuff, but&nbsp;I'm not moving for another 10 months, and in all honesty, I'm not sure that our long-distance "relationship" will last that long in the first place.&nbsp; So obviously  he's  in this thing for the long haul; unfortunately for him, I'm not so sure that I am.    &nbsp;  I have a feeling I'll be breaking this one's heart at some point... Which sucks, because I really do like him.&nbsp; He's very sweet, treats me like a princess, tells me nice things, refuses to let me pay for anything (I don't let him pay for  everything  though -- I'm not that kind of girl!!).    &nbsp;  And I think I'm afraid of commitment on top of it all.&nbsp; I've recently come to the conclusion that I really don't care if I ever get married.&nbsp; Yes, it would be nice to have a pretty diamond ring, but I'd rather just have boyfriends, and get rid of them after they've served their useful purpose.&nbsp; I do want kids, however, which is where things start to get complicated... I guess we'll just have to wait and see what happens.    &nbsp;  Due to this fear of commitment, I manage to find the silliest flaws in guys that I date.&nbsp; Jim, for example, has a funny-shaped head, and this stain-like thing in between his two front teeth (his teeth are absolutely perfect in every other way though, which is important).&nbsp; He also drinks too much (but no more than me), and smokes pot.&nbsp; But the thing is, I think that if I were to tell him he needs to quit drinking or smoking, he would do it, no questions asked.&nbsp; And that, in itself, is a turn-off.&nbsp; A boy needs to have a backbone, for goodness' sake.    &nbsp;  But he sure is good to look at.&nbsp; And he's younger than me.&nbsp; And he's an excellent kisser.&nbsp;

       I basically started this blog as a way to vent about the shitty, shitty place that I live right now...    &nbsp;  It all started when I graduated from college a year and a half ago.&nbsp; I felt like my next step was supposed to be to move down to Detroit.&nbsp; I know now that I never should have done that, and I was just trying to make my dad happy.&nbsp; That's me, always&nbsp;more worried about making everyone else happy, and forgetting that, in the end, it's always most important to LOOK OUT FOR NUMBER ONE!!!    &nbsp;  So anyway, here I am in Detroit, realizing that had I only wanted to make myself happy, I never would have left the UP.&nbsp; On the bright side of that, though, is that now I know FOR SURE that I do not ever want to live here, ever again.&nbsp; Somewhere along the line, I went from big-city to small-town girl... Who'd've thunk it???    So, my plan is to (behind my dad's back, of course), take the GRE, apply to Michigan Tech, get accepted, and move&nbsp;to Houghton sometime around June 2005.&nbsp; We'll see what happens... So far&nbsp;I haven't really started preparing yet.&nbsp; Oh, and I need to sell my condo, as well.&nbsp; Which will be&nbsp;difficult, considering that I am BROKE and&nbsp;need at least a little bit of money to prepare the damn thing to sell.&nbsp; But that's&nbsp;another story for another time. &nbsp;
