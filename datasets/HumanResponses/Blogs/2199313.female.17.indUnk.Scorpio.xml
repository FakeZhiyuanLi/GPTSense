      Things are boring right now, I am awake, and I am not at school. I wish I was, then I'd have something to do, but with the restrictions given to me, I can't drive out like a crazy maniac, not knowing where I am going to end up. I want to drive crazy, but I can't. Oh woe is me

      Yeeaa! Pure joy, pure perpetual bliss. I got to talk to one of my very best friends in the world, like any normal people would on the phone, except it was online! Oh god bless technology. I did it with IM, I finally got it, how stupid I am I? I should have gotten it ages ago!But, I finally got it and now I am happy. Nothing can bring me down tonight. PS: I am not that very religious and hopefully I didn't offend anybody who is. Sorry Goodnight all! Don't let the bedbugs bite! I am just kidding. I am so not going to bed. I don't have school tomorrow or on Halloween. Don't hate me. Gotta go babes!

      I was sitting in British Literature, and I heard all about hypocrites and what they are. Then it strikes to me, isn't everyone hypocrites? I just think that there are so much that people want as success, and all they think that success is wealth, fame, a job that pays a lot, having a lot of friends, or being popular. But that is soo not what success really is. Success is achieving your goals to the highest possibility, and feeling worthy of those goals. I often feel that I am inferior to others, and they often treat me like I don't exist. How do I make myself known? How do I feel better about myself? I have thought so many times over and over, that I want to kill myself, but this is where I am a hypocrite, I am terrified of death. The irony is that I am also terrified of the hand that life will deal to me. What is that makes us stand out from the others? Our disability, race, color, religion, looks, what? It just makes me sick that people think that they are better than others, but guess what? Nobody is perfect, there is no such thing as "perfect". Life is cruel to us often times. I hate life.

      Why is it that life always seems to be total chaos for people around our age? People always say that we should find ourselves and that we should know who we are before we go to college or graduate from school. I wish I could just freeze time and not have to worry about anything, or even care about my future. But life is not perfect. It should be. If it were, life would meet our demands, we would get whatever we wanted, but that could cause a commotion as well. Life sucks.

      Today was a slow day again. I helped clean out my dad's big SUV looking truck. He is selling it this Wenesday. He is also leaving tomorrow to go to northern California. Wish I could go with him, so that I can visit my friends in Half Moon Bay, who I miss terribly. I guess you could call me homesick for old memories and for my old life. However, it is still a part of me, always will be. It will always be the biggest part of my life, my life in Half Moon Bay. Anyway, I also cleaned up my room to spic and span. Had to, because my maternal grandmother is visiting tomorrow, and she likes everything clean or I will be condemned for it. Whatever. I celebrated my birthday early today. Went out to dinner with my parents and my sister, Jess and her husband Denver. We went to the Cheesecake Factory, where my birthday cake was a Godiva chocolate cheesecake. Yumm! Well, I am pooped out, got to go to school tomorrow. Ugh! Couldn't life do better without school or what?

      Happy Belated Halloween. Everything was out of whack last night, with all the trick-or-treaters. I had to deal with them, since my parents were not helping. Today, it was SATs time. I hate the SATs and I hope to God that I get better scores this time. I don't think I can handle it if I had to take them again. Well, its past midnight, and so it is time to say ta-tah for now.

      I am so sad and depressed. I feel like I regret one decision that I made 2 years ago and 1 and 1/2 week ago today. Today, I got a letter from my ex, and I miss him terribly. I think I am in love with him, I don't know why. People tell that I made the right decision with him, but I wonder. I mean I had two choices: Break up with him, or tell him to slow down since he was moving too fast. I think about him so much, that I wonder if he was the " one who got away" for me. I feel like he was the one. I think that I would have given everything, body and soul to him. He is special to me, especially since we broke up. I didn't tell my friends this, but when I broke up with him, I cried at night for about two weeks. I feel like I was so stupid, but then before he left to go to the air force, he sent a message to everyone that he was leaving to go to the A.F. I replied back, telling him my true feelings, and he told me that he still feels the same way too. I am so depressed, I feel the tears coming. Why?? Why did this happen to me?? I am going to be like this forever?

      Why is that parents are so stupid at all times? Why are they changelings? Why do they become the opposite person that they are when there is company? Why do they think that we always have this "attitude" with them, especially when there are people around? God, I love my parents but I hate them to the point where I cannot stand them at all.  My mother, for example, criticized my driving and I told her that I was still learning and that it didn't help that she criticized everything. Thanks mom, but I have my license now. It is time for me to learn on my own. She didn't get that and she just totally lost it. I can't even have freedom, just like my sisters did when they got their car and license. They had all the freedom they wanted, but me, I have to ask if I can go somewhere. How fucking pathetic! I hate the fact that my parents are not decent enough to treat me like an adult now that I am 17. They still don't listen to me, and they claim that I don't listen to them. Sorry, but they are not me or in my head, so how can they know? By the way, if they don't listen to me or to any of us, why should we have to listen to them? They can't have the "parent hold" over us, it is going to make us resent them. Parents are stupid overall, they need to get with the new generation or leave us alone and just trust us. When they do listen to us, then we'll listen to them, it's called RESPECT. Period.

      Ahh! A hetic week. I haven't been able to work on my pages. My computer was shot, went through a birthday, saw the Smother Brothers, went to Simon and Garfunkel's reunion tour. I also hiked up on this thousand feet or more high of a sand dune. No wonder I am so tired. I wish that time could stop long enough for me to rest. Life is life, oh woe life sucks. Couldn't we all escape into our own utopia?Live in our own fanasty? I wish I could, but I'd have to be warned of the consequences. Life isn't what you get, it is this stupid trail of depression and meaningless things, where you are lucky if you get to experience one of the greatest things in life: friendship. I miss you Adolfo!!

      Blah, blah. Yeah, I have been out of the loop a little lately, but hey, with the holidays and school and all, who has the time? So I got some disappointing news: my ex that is in the air force is engaged to a girl, Heather. Damn! And I am still in love with him, but I am pissed at him now. However, Thanksgiving was good and all. I was a vegetarian since October 1st, but on Thanksgiving day, I gorged myself. This month is not going to be a good month, because it is not hassle free at all, no siree.I have no cash, no job and I have no clue how to get presents for everybody and no clue what to get them. Great! Happy Belated Thanksgiving to everyone. Got to go, working on a project now. Toodles!

      Uhh! Finally that part of the stressful week is over. Life was absolutely crazy with all this project and homework hell. Wait, it gets better because we have the finals when we get back. Super fun! Not! Anyway, there's still more stress to come, since I have to do some shopping and I need to do it before this weekend or by this weekend. When does this hassle stop?Maybe it doesn't, maybe it just gets worse along the way. Oh, yeah, I need to apply to some colleges, since I don't want to go to culinary school anymore. I haven't even applied yet because I was waiting to see how the results of my second SATs were, and the score was exactly the same as before, so I took the ACTs and I haven't gotten the results yet. Here's' hoping for a better score. Well, anyway, right now life is acting like a hazy pit of hell for me. Well that's me though. Got to go. I gotta get to shopping, which I don't even like to do. Oh well, nobody likes to part with their money. I hope that doesn't make me a Scrooge. Hehe.

      So it's been awhile, again. But, since it is almost Christmas Break, I have sooo much homework from all of my teachers and I am totally swamped. All I can wish is that I had an extra 42 hours before tomorrow or the next. Uhh! I am so aggravated right now and I am so stressed out. I have gone back to an old habit of mine, which is pretty terrible of me. Adolfo, if you're reading this, I am so sorry, and I have broken that habit promise to you. I hope you know what I mean. Anyway, I got to get back to Sherlock Holmes: The Hound of Baskerville, it is so boring that I could cry, or fall asleep. Anyway, I gotta go. Toodles!

      So, it's the night before Christmas, and is quiet. Not! Yep, we all cherish the meaning of Christmas of giving. I will admit that I particularly love to receive presents, I hope that doesn't make me selfish. I know a lot of people love to open up their presents and show out with glee what they got, because they know it's theirs to keep, not borrow, but to keep. Christmas shopping is really a big hassle for a lot of my family right now, my mom and sister, Jesseca don't really have the time because of errands or work, while I am out of money and I am broke, my dad doesn't shop, he has mom do it. I can think that a lot of us wish that we had another year till Christmas was here, but I know that once Christmas is here, we can say, Merry Christmas while being happy because the spirit of being with our family is all we want, unless we really can't tolerate our family. I can tolerate them because I love them, there isn't any one else that I rather have Christmas with, other than my best friends in Half Moon Bay: Adolfo, Crissy and Frannie. Merry Christmas to you guys, and a Happy New Year.

      Ever think that your life's going by so fast? That you never have the chance to slow down? You ever ask yourself, where goes my life? I never seem to get the chance to slow down and relax, to get a chance to live or to have my freedom. I always feel like I have this huge rope around my neck with a leash attached, strangling me of my freedom. I always want to run away from this life, but then I realize, where would I be then? Would I have a good life or is it going to be worse than now? Sometimes I feel like I am blessed, although I know I have all the little things in life, my heart's still wants more, and I keep searching for that something more. Everytime I do, I feel like I get lost and pulled deeper into this world that I keep trying to escape from. What is it that I want in life? I think that I want is my old life back.The life that I had by the beach, where I had the best friends in the world who truly understands me and accept me for who I am and are fun to be with. Here in the desert, everyone is so critical of me and of who I want to be and they all laugh, thinking it's all a joke. But in reality, it's not at all. I wish I could rewind back to the point where my parents asked me how I felt about moving, but that chance is already long time gone. And I have this mistake to pay for and learn from. I feel as if my soul left my body when I moved and stayed by the beach, waiting for me to come and pick it up. But like I said, all of those chances are long gone, and so am I.

      I also wanted to add,   Happy Valentine's Day!!   Not everyone is alone in the fact that they don't have a date for Valentine's day, I don't even have one, although I do wish I did, but I have to remember that if you're patient, love will come looking for you. After all, I don't want to be looking for love in the wrong places. But that is me. Again, Happy Valentines!! This goes for everyone out there, with dates or without alike

      In my English class, known as my British Literature, we had to write a sonnet about something that we love to do or something that we love very much, something that we can be passionate enough to write about. Well, since I have lived by the beach for almost my entire life, until I've moved to Las Vegas about a year ago, one of the things that I miss very much, other than my friends, is the ocean. So I wrote a sonnet about the ocean, but silly me, I forgot to do the rhyming pattern. So here's the original, the first, without the rhyming pattern:  Waves quietly lapping upon the sand In the sunset, the undertide is low Making the water look calm, oh it is Beautiful and serene, yet dead calm Around the afternoon, the water's loud And waves are crashing upon each other In an endless rhymth, undertow's strong Tide's high, a light blue with green mixed in During the storms, when its dark and rainy The water's so loud that its frighteningly Deafening, its quite dangerous with waves Looming ever so high with its own mind Beautiful and mysterious, yet dark Everchanging with time, be dawn or dusk

      Today, I wrote a song that seems to have been lurking about my head, ready to be put onto paper, to become alive. I realized what I had written after I was done with the song. Who knew that emotions that are bottled up like that can be easily rid of onto paper? It is a great way to get rid of the negative energies that I have bottled up. But this time, the energies that I had bottled up without a clue was more sadistic than negative, however you look at it. When I had looked at the lyrics on the paper, I realized that all this time, since coming to Las Vegas, I have never showed my true self to the world. I've kept hiding, afraid to reveal who I really am. I have let people on about that I am truly a happy teen growing into her womanhood, and that I have nothing troubling me. But it so happens that I am truly the opposite. I am truly a depressed and homesick for my old hometown, and my friends that I left behind that I have regret that lies in my heart. To this day, I am still putting on a brave face, because I am too prideful and too scared to let people know the truth. It almost like I have these invisible walls trapping me in a box to protect me whenever I need it, which happens to be almost all the time. I always let the past haunt me and the memories continue to play in my head like a television show that you love but you refuse to turn off because you are afraid to miss even one moment. Then there are the secrets that one keeps to themselves, and trust me, I have more than a few that not even my closest friends or family knows about. There probably is only one friend who would take one of those secrets seriously if I ever told him about it, whereas the other people in my life would think that it is just a phase or a joke. Everyone thinks that everything is a joke, and they never take anything seriously, and those are the people that I am afraid to open up to, because I am afraid of being hurt. Why else would I put on a brave face or rather a false skin?

      Hey now, I know it's been awhile since I wrote anything. But I've been busy dealing with Senior project, on Shakespeare and his play: the Comedy of Errors. It seems boring if you read the old English version, but if you read it in the new version, you might like it. I had to research on that play, which took forever, but it paid off. Anyway, I tried cart racing for the first time this Monday, I liked it so much, and I was told that I was a maniac in cart racing. Hey, I was a wild maniac in Waverunning, so why not cart racing? I also went out intertubbing this Sunday, I wanted it fast and rough, was given fast and rough at 45 miles per hour. I got hurt, I cracked my elbow a little, and now it's all swollen up with a terrible bruise on it. I received some news about my sister being pregnant with a fetus, don't know whether if its twins, boy or girl, got that news last month, and my sister is 3 months in now. I had a really bizarre dream last night, and I hope to god that it doesn't come true, because most of my dreams come true except for the fanasties. I dreamt that my friend Adolfo had died, because he killed himself because he couldn't take that every single meaningful friend of his were moving away. It was me first, then Lysa, and I dreamt that Sydney had moved away too. We were the cause of his death. Then I got the news from my friend Crissy, telling me that Adolfo had killed himself. I woke up and I started to cry because I love my friend Adolfo too much to lose him, and I realized that I needed to keep in contact with him more, even as hard it is to, because it is still painful in the memory that I left my best friends behind. I have been trying to apply to UNLV online, but you know how fucking hard it is to pay online? The damn computer wouldn't let me pay online, so I am going to miss the deadline. Fucking great, now I got to find out where the community colleges are in LV. Great, great, fucking awesome great[Sarcastic here]. Anyway, I got to go, but I really got to get writing here too. So TTFN.

      I went surfing online & I found this song, listened to it and got the lyrics. Thought it was peculiar.  Friends (Fucked) by Donots  Some say I am skin-deep Some say I ain´t sincere But believe me I´ll always tell you what you want to hear  But I never told you No, I never told you How I fuck my friends  I've got promises to break And friendships left to kill Don't kid yourself A middlefinger pays the bill  And I never told you  I fucked ´em all and I fucked Â´em raw

      Today was just a lazy day. I got to hang out with my mom. Last night or rather this morning at 12:00 am, me and mom went to the movie theater so that we could watch Harry Potter. There were a whole lot of people, I mean a whole lot. Some of them were dressed in witch hats and robes with the movie logo on it. I thought it was bizarre, but each to their own. So my mom and I ended up going home and catching the 10:30 this morning. I have to say that as a Harry Potter fan, I was disappointed. If you've read the Harry Potter books, you'll find that the first two movies followed the book exactly. But the third one, things were out of order, wrong things in wrong places, missing stuff. I mean, come on, the people who directed and wrote this movie needs to read the book correctly! It's not that hard! Otherwise, it was good and okay. Like the saying, the good comes with the bad, or was it with the sweet comes the sour? Either way. Later, me and my mom hung around the house, eating leftover pizza and I was trying on some blouses of mine to see what would go with my graduation outfit. My mom wanted to go shopping, and we went to Mervyn's. I found two pairs of cute shirts whereas my mom found two pairs of pants, a skirt, a short sleeved blouse, a long sleeved blouse and a short tee. Wow! Anyway, I am physced about graduation and I am also not getting the idea of graduating at the same time. It was like, Whoa! I'm done, what am I gonna do? Yeah, something like that. Anyway, got to go, but people of comedy, please check if you haven't yet: Blue Collar Comedy,the tour. It is hilarious. I am particularly fond of " Here's Your Sign" guy and " Drunk in Public" guy too. Check it out, go on! Toodles!

      TODAY IS THE DAY  The time has come for us to go  For us to say goodbye To our past and embrace our future "Today is our day To live up to the moment To do or die is our decree Live for the moment is our motto We've gotten this far There's nothing stopping us now"--Chorus The moment we've been waiting for 12 years and counting is upon us Now's our chance to show the world What we're made of... Hey, hey, hey, hey I said hey, today's our day To show the world that we're ready  To face the new possibilities That the real world holds And we're not afraid No, we're not afraid Because... "Chorus" The time has come  For our special moment  That special rite of passage Onto the real world Today's the day to stand up And to look back And be proud of what we've achieved Because today's our last day Of security Tomorrow holds a bright future For all of us For today... "Chorus" For today is the day  We have to day Goodbye to security  And hello to the real world Because that's where we're headed Onto the real world...

      Yeah! Today was my last day at school. But today was pathetic, I didn't have any finals. I had graduation ceremony practice, which is stupid and morally wrong to put kids through.I mean, we've been through it before in 5th grade, and 8th grade. What's different? Plus, some of us have seen our older siblings or older friends' graduations to know how its gonna go. All I needed to do was to pick up my cap and gown, but sad thing is that its mandatory. Great, so we had to sit through 4 hours doing absolutely nothing that was new. Fun and super! Being sarcastic there, but hey, no more school. That's enough for me.

      Yes! Finals are done, and I am passing. I am going to graduate! I cannot believe it, 12 years, good god! But it's funny, however long we wait for this day, thinking that we are prepared to have this day to be here. It finally hits us, Whoa! I'm not going to be a kid anymore, I'm finally an adult. It seems so strange to us,this feeling. Someone had sent me a card regarding the Congrats of my graduation,and had written: Spread your wings and fly to wherever the wind will take you, life is your oyster, find the brass ring. I know, I know, it may sound a little bizarre, but it fits in with everything. Life is ours for the taking and we should go where our hearts desire to go, where our dreams are. The wierdest thing though is that some of us, when the moment draws to a near, are not really prepared. We are not prepared to leave the friends or the people that we have grown up with at the school, because we fear that we may never see them again and because our lives will change. Why the heck do they make us go through this? It would be so much easier if it would all stay the same, our lives I mean. Know the saying, Life isn't fair? Well they weren't kidding when they said that. Congrats to all those that graduated this year and the best of luck to all of you!

      Well, it's been awhile, I know. But things can get pretty hectic around here especially if you are in 12th grade and are dealing with graduation coming up. I am almost finished with my finals and now I have one more tomorrow. It is going to be sooo boring. It's computer class, GREAT!!Being sarcastic there. Yeah, well, I donated blood on the 20th. It was my second time. My very first time wasn't too successful. See, what happened was I had just turned 16 and there was a blood drive at the Half Moon Bay High School,where I used to go. I must have been lying on the bed with a needle in my arm for about 1/2 an hour, and they told me to go, because I couldn't fill the pint. In 1/2 an hour, I filled at least 1/2 of a pint.Sucks huh? So why would I try to donate again? Because I wanted to overcome the fear that all of my donation experiences would be just like this. Well, this time, I filled the pint in 7 to 8 minutes. You would not believe how proud of myself that I was. It was the greatest feeling. Anyway, my parents and I have driving around everywhere on the weekends in California. There is one sheduled for this weekend to go to Yosemite. I bailed on this one because I am soooo sick of roadtrips right now, and I have a very special one coming up on the 9th of June, which is the day after I graduate. I am actually very excited about this trip, I can't tell anybody why yet.But I am so excited. I can't till its over.  My parents are looking forward to the 4th because of Harry Potter, the 3rd one is out, and they want to see it. I won't deny it, but I do like Harry Potter. Does this make me a freak? Well, I don't care what people think. I am so not looking towards to graduation, and I am looking forward to it at the same time. See, I'm afraid, since I really haven't gotten around to applying to colleges, but I am so relieved to finally be done with school and getting it over with. 12 years, can you believe it? I'm so happy, I got a medal to wear with the cap and gown. Got it because I'm getting an advanced diploma, can you believe it. Well, that's all that new. TTYL when I got something new to talk about.

        So I came back from my little family road trip with my parents. We went to Half MoonBay, so that I could see my friend's graduation and surprise everyone else. In watching the graduation, it made me realize how much I wished that I were graduationg with them instead of my other graduation. I wished that I could have had one more year to grow up with these people that I've literally known all my life, well at least since 6th grade for the most of them, and a very few since 1st or 2nd grade.    It made me so sad to see that I missed out on that one year with these people that I actually cared about-- which surprises me that I cared about them. Anyway, I was so happy to see everyone before they went off to college, truth is that I missed them and I will still miss them, because they were a part of my life growing up whether they know it or not. Hopefully there will be a reunion where everyone will come. On the other hand, I was so happy to see my best friend Adolfo, seeing that it had been a year since I saw him. he was probably happy that I came to see his graduation. But, Crissy, my other best friend in Half Moon Bay, or at least she used to be, didn't look too happy to see me. It was almost like she wanted to forget that I ever existed. We had a really bad parting because we were so sad that I was moving and we were bawling our eyes out, it was heart-wrenching at the moment. It was like the part of me of her life was erased, permantely. At least I got to see if there was still anything between us as friend, and obviously there isn't. That's all for now.

       I&nbsp;hope that everyone had a fantastic fourth of July or at least had some fun. I went to Morro Bay where my relatives live and where everyone in my family spends the fourth of July. For those of you don't know where Morro Bay is, it is about 40 miles north of San Luis Obispo. Anyways, my favorite cousin, or well my cousin that was my favorite until we both grew up, her boyfriend Mike was there. Mike was only 18 and his parents are divorced, and he lives with his mom and brother. The point is, he got really drunk, and nobody cared at all. Taking my cue from him, I snuck a couple of Smirnoff's Ice. It was great. I hadn't touched alcohol for almost a year.&nbsp;But earlier that day, my sister and I went to the store to pick up stuff for her pasta&nbsp;salad recipe that I do not like at all. While she and I were checking out the beers, there was a couple with a son who looked to be about my age and a much younger girl who must have,&nbsp;been 9 or so. The son was really having a excited conversation with his dad about which beer to get. I couldn't help but stare, and he caught me staring at him. He was really cute. Anyway, I paid attention to my sister, and saw that he was staring out me too. It was flattering, he was staring as if to ask, "Do I know you from my school?" " Who are you?". I wish that I could have talked to him, maybe got him to go to my uncle and aunt's party, that way I could have gotten to know him and who knows, sparks could have flown. Damn! He was cute and I regret that I didn't talk to him. Anyways, after the 5th, I went to stay with my Grandmother who was complaining that she wanted my company. My mom had arranged with her for me to stay from the 5th till the 14th. 10 miserablely boring days. Don't get me wrong, I love my grandmother, but I cannot stand either of my grandmothers for longer than one day. So, when I got back home, I was relieved to be home. Although, when I got home, I had a surprise. My parents gave&nbsp;me a laptop! I was so excited, even if it was my mother's before, but it meant that I could finally get rid of my big and completely slow computer. Life is wierd, but it's okay because its full of surprises. Tah tah for now.

       Ah, nothing much happened at all, except that I got back in touch with Zac, who is still intent on getting married to Heather, in October or so. He just had his 19th birthday a couple of days ago. I can't believe that he is getting married so young. I hope the best for him, even though I believe things will not work out between them because my middle sister Alli, who is pregnant, got married at age 18 and she is not happy with her husband and she wants to get divorced but is not able to because she's pregnant with his kid now. I wish the best of luck to her and to Zac too. Why is it that people think that they should get married young? It seems to be a mistake, I mean look at the divorce percentages that keep getting higher each year. I definitely learned from my sister's mistake and I believe that I rather get married around when I am 24 or so. But who knows what fate and what life has in store for me. I am leaving to go to Paso Robles and to Huntington Beach for my brother in law's birthday and to help with my sister Alli's newly aqquired house, which is in desperate need of remodeling. Anyways, great for me [being sarcastic here] I really want to look for a job and apply to the community college before its too late. Got to go, what can I say? Toodles...

       Well, so here I am, I am job hunting since I won't be going to community college until spring. I've applied at PostNet, but they are not hiring until school starts, Sept or Oct. So I've also tried Office Depot. I am going to try Borders, Bed &amp;Beyond, the 99 cent store, any where I can apply. Earlier, like about two months ago, I tried applying at Target, Walmart, Sears, Albertsons, RiteAid and I still haven't gotten anything. I am so desperate for a job here. Another thing in my life right now is that I met someone online almost 17 months ago. He and I had been emailing each other for like 3 months till I blocked him. I recently got in touch with him, and he was so excited, not angry.   But today, I saw a couple of esipodes about meeting someone online, and the things that turned out to be not any good. It kind of made me think about being careful about who I meet online, because all I know is that anyone could be a pedophile, someone who is perverted in obsession with kids and sexual fanasties about them. They can get any kid's photo and claim that the photo is them. This guy I met, he has not yet sent me any photos of him, nor I with him, and all he wants is to be with me. Looks like its time to cut him off again, I don't trust him, and I'm not that stupid. So, anyone who has a relationship with someone online, needs to be careful, and do not whatsoever meet anyone in person. It could be your life or you could raped. Think about it, is it worth your life to meet someone that you've never met before online in person? It's definetly not worth mine...

       Dear friends, I am back. The beach party that I went to for my bro-in-law was fun, I even went into the water, which I haven't done in quite a while. It was exilatering. Anyways, we hit the road to Paso Robles to my sister, Allison's new house. My sister literally hated the house. I have to admit that there was a whole lot to be done there. We totally destroyed some parts of the house. For example, we scraped the "cottage cheese" ceiling to flatten it, we took out two walls of the dining room and the wall separating the living room from the room next to the kitchen to make it into one whole room, much more open. We redid the electricity cables and rewired them, put new outlet faces, you know, the area you plug someting into? We also tore out the carpet which was totally awful, it smelled like cat and or dog pee. Uggh! Then we put in new, brand new carpet in, after we had painted every room except for the bathrooms, kitchen and hallways. And before we left, we were on the beginning of putting hardwood floors, but we didn't finish and Alli's husband was on a roll doing it himself. So that's that. But, boy my sister's getting huge, and she is due in October, maybe late September. God, I can't believe that I am going to be an aunt one month before I legally turn 18. Good god! That's it for tonite.
