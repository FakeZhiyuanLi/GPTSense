      wow isnt this just peachy keen! sumtymes i jus dont understand life and it just really sux! josie told me that she talked to her ex boy fren which led her to believe that everything he did, everything he sent, and everything he said wasnt real that according to him i started all this basically! and its really stupid and annoying becuz i can hear it in josie's tone, she believes him.  i am not trying to sound mean when i say this but i just hope she sets herself strait becuz i dont want nothing to do with that asshole hes so full of it!  he keeps telling her that it was all a game and he was just riding the rollercoaster. f*ck that (x-q's me for foul lingo) he sent me the first text message how the hell is he going to be shady like that, but to b honest i am not going to care that is her life, but all she kept saying was " i have to make the right decision" wtf does she mean by that!!! gosh i am sry but that is just stupid how can a guy make u feel like u have to make a decision (of any sort)! ! ! i kno she believs him over me. . . i can read her that well ! ! ! thats life ! ! ! newayz on a brighter note (uh sure) skool starts in like less than two wks now! i want to go back but i dont because well i mean its skool, but i do miss seeing all my frens over the summer so thats prolly one of the main reasons i really want to go back.  Derek is going to have a tuff year but i know that he will xcel in what ever he puts his mind to.  I love derek so much this summer has prolly ben the best one eva bcuz i had the opp to spend so much time with him it was great! lol just being with him makes so much sense to me now,  i wouldnt have it any other way!  (sub-chg) i finally talked to kristina its ben awhile but hey this gives both her and i enuff time to "catch up" oh yay! i have to clean . . . again! :

        i had this situation with my best fren where her now ex-boy fren wanted to get with me, apparently she thought at first that i would of actually gone with his plan and his "game" was unravled but see here is the thing it confused the living shit outta me because the situation that josie was in i had lived in january of this same year with gabbi and ali and its crazy that i would be in gabbi shoes!! i thought about it and i knew i felt nothing for him, i mean i never did, but i also knew the right thing to do. . . so i told her. . . rxn wasnt great and later that night wen i was talking to my boyfren she asked meh if i didnt know her would i go out with luis (ex boufren) and i reassured her that i felt nothin for him. . . on a diff note derek and i have ben together for 1month and sum odd days now its great he got me pink roses a card and a teddy (josie and i thought the appropriate name for it would be dr.afro)
