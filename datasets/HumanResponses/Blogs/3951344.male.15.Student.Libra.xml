      Why do we think the chances of the universe producing something as orderly as us is improbable? Our idea of sense and order is skewed by the fact that we are the ones doing the sensing. Sitting here throwing a ball up in the air and then catching it, I realize that it only seems to be a sensical action because I do it. If what existed in the universe looked completely different and did things completely differently, it too would wonder, what are the chances that my actions make so much sense. But you must complete the sentence. what are the chances that my actions would make so much sense to me. There's a pretty good chance of that.  Then you really get it that sense and order are concepts that are entirely created by us, and so have no concrete meaning. It therefore does not mean anything to think, what are the chances that my actions make so much sense?

      Things can have 2 causes?&nbsp; But there is only one billiard ball...but things have many causes.&nbsp; infinitely many!&nbsp; So many going back it includes the billiard ball it self.&nbsp; "Time Is Like Acid" comes to mind.&nbsp; like every moment one looks at a face it is new.&nbsp; So its like that for the billiard ball.

      Slightly high:   "Who digs Los Angeles is Las Angeles!"   He who experiences something becomes that thing.&nbsp; But not in a passive way.&nbsp; He digs it!&nbsp; He does what it is doing.

      High:   "If the good lord had intended us to walk, he wouldn't have invented roller skates."   If something happens it is the "will" of the universe, the Tao, whatever you want to call it.&nbsp; Everything is a part of it.&nbsp; It is the path from which there is no coming or going.&nbsp; Thus, nothing that happens can be looked down upon (except of course that the looking down is part of what can't be looked down upon).

      Stoned: &nbsp; A notion is not just an idea.&nbsp; Its a notion.&nbsp; There is something I can't put into words that differentiates them.&nbsp; I can't say what.&nbsp; Its in the brain.&nbsp; Unconscious?&nbsp; But I am conscious of it.&nbsp; Like the words are logs surrounded by water and the water guides the words into their proper meanings in the brain.  &nbsp;  What are the chances that everybody's waterways are the same?

      Mabye the illusion of choice comes from knowing exactly what "choice" one is going to make.

      Consciousness is the whole universe. The things a person does are  the actions of the entire universe. Consciousness is the  expression of the influence of the whole universe. After death  the universe goes on, therefore so does consciousness. "I" am  what the whole universe is doing.   Neurons fire as the result external stimuli. It is the external  universe that controls it all, therefore it is the external world that  is consciousness, therefore you are one with the external world.

      Written while stoned and listening to Jimi Hendrix:  Everything you sense is a thing you did, "caused," therefore they are dancing with you, they are one with you. Jimi's music is one with me because I'm listening to it. I played it. It's one with me.&nbsp; I groove with it. So it is with the universe, the Tao!   Jimi Plays and listens at the same time. Which does he dance to? Which does he dance with?&nbsp; Both! Both are one! Cause and effect!
