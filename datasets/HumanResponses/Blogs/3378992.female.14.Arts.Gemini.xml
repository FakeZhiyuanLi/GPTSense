It was fun and intresting ,dont get me wrong, but its just been to crazy for me.  As most ppl no i have a b/f and im happy with him, alot i love him so much, but im starting to think i need to show my love more, i used to but i think ive drifted away from doing wut i realy want to do.

      I've leatned to love life more and respect ppl better in recent events. but it doesnt help me from being nervous about starting a new show! I just relized that im gonna be starting rehersals again and Ill see HIM again and i finally got over HIM and i wanna move on, but i have feeling that when i see HIM and hear HIM sing ill begin to like him again. and im not sure how to stop that from happeing. i mean i have NO g/f in this show, so ill be with guys the hole time! but i dont hang out with HIM because whenever im around HIM i cant breath (which doesnt make much convo) well hopefully this "fling" (its lasted over 2 years) will go away. . . .

      Kidding Around was the best show ive ever been in!!! i realize ive only been in 5 shows but this one was the best! i mean it opened me up, more, to the world of broadway, and i met the most increddible people ever! i mean i made friends there that really understand me and are terrific and sapport me! and they only new me for maybe a week and a half, ok ill admit i didnt make any girl friends, they were all guys and i became really fond of one of them (as if everyone doesnt no haha) and i havent talked to him in three days and im starting to miss him deeply!!! i will NEVER make friends like that at Fairview EVER, i want to go to GMHS and go there with my buddies ( but im not).   Mood: Deeply missing him..... Song: HAHA "What is this feeling?" from Wicked....awesome song, i bet like no one from fairview could tell me how that song goes (except one, KELC lol) o well.....
