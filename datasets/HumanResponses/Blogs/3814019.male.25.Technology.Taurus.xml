						    I bet you all want to know about Prew the Man. Oh I know you all know about Prew the Myth, but i know you really want to see the real man behind the legend. Whats lies beneath that calm nonchalant exterior is a man not to be messed with. Fear this man, he will drink you under the table, then calmly crawl under&nbsp;aswell&nbsp;and slit your throat. His mind tricks however far outweigh his vicious physical prowess. He has been known to spend the day at work communicating with his colleagues (of which I am one) using only strange murmuring noises, I hope the camera footage is still on the companies security system, because it witnessed the rare collapse of an entire workforces sanity over the period of eight hours. We all clocked in in the morning as calm rational humans (on paper anyway) but when we clocked out that evening, we were physically shaking from the emotional turmoil, our hair had been crudely cut with stanley knives still bearing the rabid spittle we produced at the point of mental breakdown and our clothes had gone from our&nbsp;pitifully broken bodies. Sadly, the management didn't notice any difference.     &nbsp;   It is too late for us now, we are lost and destined to a life of souless inanity (and that's just work related), Prew has inflicted far worse on us. We are retches, mere shadows of our former selves, the man is a killer. Fear him.

						   Ok i realise a blog is supposed to be updated everyday, but alcohol waits for no man etc. As I have been repeatedly reminded, i am a lazy bugger :D  Todays installment is the Ice Cream Friday!  After much deliberation on the idea of the Ice Cream Sundae (if anyone can tell me why they are called this i would be immensely grateful!) i have decided to start a tradition of my own, on a Friday, by far the best day of the week, as all who aren't bums (unemployed) or professional bums (students) will testify.  By creating a range of alcoholic ice cream and ice lolly based alcoholic treats i hope to bring inebriation and refreshment to the masses at the same time. Current ideas include Lager Floats, Vodka Screwballs, JD and coke lollies and Tequila Traffic lights. Feel free to let me know any ideas or possible trademark infringement!  /Monkey Power!

						   Well after much deliberation and pondering (about 2 mins after reading Mr Kinackins random ranting, and saying 'go on dude') i've decided to join the suberversive cult that is Blogdom. (This is a potential religion in my book, not like the sad gits that all put 'Jedi' in their census forms, you know who you are!)  Current deliberations are whether to get a mullet or an 80s style power perm, and try to make a career by performing terrible 80s rock songs as a shorter fatter version of some spandex wearing ponce, the only drawback being i can't sing, but hey this never stopped anyone! This is the way forward i feel for mine and Ricks future boy band 'Fat Guys From Oldham'. More band updates as soon as we think of them in the hours of extreme boredom we endure daily.  /Evil Monkey signing out

						    I ponder too much, its official. When i am working i am thinking, when i am walking i mentally wander, it will be the death of me one day. Todays idle thought is the origin of the saying "fuck knows". Who is this fuck who holds such knowledge? where did he come from, where did he go and how exactly does he know so damn much about EVERYTHING?. where are my keys? Fuck knows. Why is my Pay slip vaguer than a leaflet on alziemers disease? Fuck knows. Why, no matter how hard i conceal my email, does that guy from nigeria ALWAYS manage to track me down? Fuck knows. Why the hell does my car take five minutes to start in the morning? Fuck knows (though admittably i have a vague idea why too) Why do i never win the lottery yet always win stuff on the internet? Fuck knows. Why am i even writing all this crap? Fuck knows.      So why wont Fuck share some of this goddam knowledge?!? Fuck knows, but he sure aint telling.

       It had to happen (well it didnt really, but i had previously said it would so i may as well do it now).This is a "spin-off" of the Cardboard Jungle posts on kinackin.net. Hopefully we can chronicle the trials and tribulations we encounter on a daily basis (it will be a community blog with all the animals of the jungle contributing).       I have nothing to add at the moment as i am currently hunting down aforementioned animals and harrassing them into getting a blogger account.

        Moths Do Not Kill People. There I have said it. I am so glad I got that out of the way. Only I feel the effort was a futile one as Seonaid (like many people) will still see them as the flying incarnation of Satan. What the hell is it with those things anyway? Why single moths out for such speciesism? I mean, lets be honest here if you were a pair of pants or a particularly expensive shirt I could understand the phobia (those buggers go through clothes like George Bush goes through crayons) but for the humans amongst us, a fear of something so small and relatively harmless just seems absurd. Imagine how the moth feels being chased around the room with a magazine, getting smacked about and squashed whilst having to deal with high pitched human noises like "ohmygodohmygod killitandynowpleeeease, arrghitsthereitthereohmygod!". Its not easy being a moth you know, they aren't considered as cute and photogenic as their butterfly cousins, they don't frolic in the fields and pastures on an idyllic summers day. They have to fly round rooms at subsonic speeds kamakaziing into any available light source whilst making loud noises (much to the annoyance of the rooms occupiers). So please, spare a thought for the moth, give it a chance, don't get miffed by a moth, killer moths are a myth. (I see a teeshirt in the pipelines there!)      Oh and Part three of the Cardboard Jungle will be published in the next day or two, and that's a KinPromise(tm)

        I am mad. I am fuming. I want to hunt down someone and turn them inside out using a novelty spoon and a bucket. I want to eat my hands and spit them in the face of the person who is in charge. I just lost my blog whilst trying to publish it. Now clearly thats annoying, but even more so when you find out that the blog that i just lost was actually a blog explaining that i just lost a blog. Fool me once, shame on me, fool me twice... well thats when the i start using the spoon on myself.  it read (sort of)   "blah blah blah hour of my life natter natter Cardboard Jungle part three   waffle waffle just went to the paper bin in the sky mumble mumble absolutely gutted etc etc"  I find it hard to stomach losing an hour of my work, i find it harder still dealing with the fact i tried to come up with an alternative blog to explain and find that too went tits up.  Goodnight people im off to bed, ill write part three (again) tomorrow.  In notepad.

        Moving on from the the king of the jungle we encounter some true harmonisation of nature, as we walk slowly and carefully towards the deepest, darkest depths of the jungle. Here, surrounded by cardboard trees and animals of all shapes and sizes we see the indigenous&nbsp;pigmies of the&nbsp; pickerpacker  tribe. Somehow managing to live in perfect unison with their surroundings, the pickerpacker people have learnt to survive on the most basic of diets. They have many customs and dressed in baggy clothing and woolly headpieces most civilised members of the western world would find them bizarre to say the least. As we approach we can clearly see the two main tribesmen  suffuros gladly  and  torturous loudly  begining the daily dance around the hi-fi. Strange noises can be heard eminating from the device, to which the tribesmen seem entranced by.&nbsp;These noises are the tribesmens way of keeping the many beasts away from their emcampment as most animals find the noises horrible to the ears. A quick journey away from the pygmy home and we get to see a rare sight indeed! Here, hiding behind a plethora of boxes, we see the lesser spotted  wherus davus.  Seldom seen in these parts, the wherus davus is a timid and shy beast, preferring solitude and quiet to the normal social noisy lifestyle of your average jungle dweller.

        This next "guest style" has grown out of all proportion and will now have to be spread over a number of days. i prefer to get it right than rush it just for the sake of posting it on time. so, here goes, enjoy...     &nbsp;   [cue slow deep gravelly voiceover]    And here we are -&nbsp;outside the warehouse - and its coming up to late morning. Hopefully this will be a perfect time to see the creatures we will be examining in their natural environment. &nbsp; The&nbsp;building is home&nbsp;to many species of animal, a whole multitude of creatures living in almost perfect harmony.&nbsp; As we walk through the&nbsp;main door, we are immediately confronted by a common creature to these parts,&nbsp;the common or garden&nbsp; buyis&nbsp;offus  or 'customer' as the locals&nbsp;like to call them.&nbsp;They are a&nbsp;social animal and like to congregate in&nbsp;great herds around the counter&nbsp;within the reception area of the&nbsp;warehouse, they communicate using either&nbsp;complex&nbsp;hand gestures&nbsp;and randomly raised voices, or by occasionally pressing the buzzer&nbsp;as a way to gain the attention of other creatures in the area. as we pass&nbsp;swiftly through into the warehouse&nbsp;itself, a&nbsp;myriad of fauna and&nbsp;plantlife caress the senses and can easily disorientate the careless traveller. A quick journey over to the 'goods in' department and we see - armed with a primitive weapon - the  mucho pocketus.  Although not a solitary creature by habit, he is seldom seen outside 'goods in' and communicates by shouting random words at people. Next we come to the main bench, where the king of the jungle  arsus maximus  resides.&nbsp;He rules his domain with an iron thumb (his real one had been chopped off in a fight with some racking) He lets the creatures of the area know he is about by emitting a high pitched screeching noise. He lives&nbsp;on a diet of ready made curries and the souls of the weak. He also preys on the opposite sex with a blase disregard for manners that set him apart from his fellow creatures and can often be found sniffing round female  buyis offus .        &nbsp;

        The haze of the morning still obscured his vision, the sickly minty taste of toothpaste&nbsp;&nbsp;still a nagging intrusion in his mouth. The screen flickered oppresively, sending Andy Halkyards&nbsp;brain in directions it simply didnt want to go at that god awful time of the morning. He tried to focus on the email but it was no good, something just didnt add up, it all seemed too convienient and besides, Andy had never even heard of the National bank of Nigeria. While he pondered, a girl entered the room from the kitchen behind him, he felt her presence before he heard her steps and spun in his chair to face her. She wore of face of determination above a body Andy found much to his tastes, it was the bait and he knew it. While&nbsp;he&nbsp;focused on one the other could strike and finish him off. They were a team, her body and her face, he had learned to deal with one but never both.    &nbsp;  "I need you to go to the shop" she said it oh so innocently, like it was a thing to be thought over and considered. He knew he had no option, his back was to the wall and the only way out was to climb over it, he tried that once, chiropractors aren't cheap in this city, Andy grimaced at the memory.    &nbsp;  "Sure thing babe" he replied, trying to look calm and in control "what do you need?"    "I need some ham" &nbsp; then a moments pause "you do know what it looks like don't you?" They were simply a collection of words, but those simple words hit him harder than any object could, he spat out a retort like it was the vilest taste in the roof of his mouth     &nbsp;  "i  do  know what ham looks like, Seonaid!" it was a weak response, but it was the best he could muster, the front line fodder had arrived, he had to just hang in there for the reinforcements. Without another word she simply vanished, out of his vision, out of&nbsp;the&nbsp;room and upon hearing the now familiar slam of the door, out of the house. His army stared disbelievingly at an empty battlefield.    &nbsp;  It was going to be one of those days.    &nbsp;    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

        There are few constants in this world .  One you can always rely on though is the incessant nagging a man gets from a woman.&nbsp;When I used to drive round in my van there used to be a&nbsp;constant squeaking noise from&nbsp;the wooden partition behind me, people used to ask me how I put up with it.&nbsp;The simple truth is&nbsp;I couldn't hear it anymore, it had simply been&nbsp;filtered out by my brain, its like that with nagging.&nbsp;My girlfriend&nbsp;sleepnags, she nags at me when&nbsp;we get up, she nags at me when I get home from work she nags at me when we are getting ready to go to sleep&nbsp;and thus the cycle of nagging continues&nbsp;for another day.&nbsp;But I am strong, my minds defenses have learnt from the squeaky partition,&nbsp;its next task is to construct a random retort generator&nbsp;and maybe if it has time to do something about the&nbsp;glazey eyes I get.     &nbsp;   Man&nbsp;has evolved throughout&nbsp;time to battle the elements, to adapt to changing environments, to crawl selfishly to the top of the food chain and to ultimately deal with&nbsp;the greatest foe it has ever encountered 'Woman'. &nbsp; Forget&nbsp;assertions by scientists that dinosaurs died out when a meteor struck earth, the truth is that Mrs Rex and co nagged their other halves into extinction. They didn't have the necessary mental prowess to cope with the constant bombardment of demands to watch the eggs, or go fetch a nice tree for us to chew on. They died. Some time later we appeared.&nbsp;I just hope we as a species can cope.

        I often wait   anxiously in my living room, hoping and praying that somebody will ring and try to sell me something. Better yet, maybe they will knock at my door and offer me some great deals. Some days i'm lucky and they send me emails and it makes life so simple... Well that's what moron sales people seem to think anyway.     &nbsp;   I don't know about you, but I don't see something I like and think "oh, I like that, but I'll just hang on for now, maybe someone will try to sell it me over the phone or at my door". I got a call of a confident speaking guy the other day, he said I could save ten pounds a month on my phone bill, I told him in no uncertain terms to naff off for the simple fact that I hate cold calls. Why the hell would I trust the word of a complete stranger on the phone and sign up to something I have never even heard of before? Service station credit card girls are another pet hate of mine, they prey on the walking penises of this world. "hello there" said the gorgeous suited blonde as she battered her eyelids "can I talk to you for a moment?" The testosterone controlled ones amongst us inevitably succumb to these vicious sales sirens and end up filling in applications for credit cards before they can say "I only came in for a pee".&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Even the service station car parks are no haven from dodgy sales people. I often got cars pulling up beside me as I read my paper, they invariably had strange vague European accents (the kind English people do when imitating strange Europeans) "hello there my friend" the dialogue would begin "I am on my way back from a trade fair, and have these fine designer samples still in my car, would you like to buy them, very cheap, from me, I would hate to carry them all the way home". Its at that point I often&nbsp;thought about the sheer volume of sales reps that must frequent these fairs, and why the hell did&nbsp;they always end up with&nbsp;so many samples spare?&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Sorry, I have to cut this one short, I just got an email about penis enlargements I have been waiting&nbsp;for ages to arrive. &nbsp;

        Bosses, for most people that word evokes quite a reaction. You can't live with them, but you sure as hell can live without them. They just go to prove that shit really does always float to the top. My dad told me an interesting story once.     &nbsp;   A manager at a big distribution company decides one day to try and save the company money, he doesn't particularly like most of his staff and has no control over how it runs as he has a spine akin to that of a worm. So, to save the company money (and gain precious brownie points) he recruits the aid of "time and motion" specialists (at a ridiculously large expense). These specialists turn up and monitor how the business runs, they make notes as people go about their daily chores, they ask questions about procedure and so on and generally just mooch about assimilating the company and its going ons. After they are satisfied they get their heads together, write up loads of reports and make hideously difficult graphs which baffle all and sundry and eventually come up with The Findings. And do you know what they decided after looking into the whole of the business dealings and seeing all the staff work? They decided that for the business to run smoothly and save money the company should get rid of the manager, the very same man that called in the experts in the first place.     &nbsp;   I found this story immensely amusing at the time, and it made me realise that managers, far from being the head that's needed for the body to function,&nbsp;are in fact the wart on the arse that irritates the body no end and causes all manner of uncomforts when it sits down for a moment or two.     &nbsp;   I have a new manager. I used to work for the family business, and management usually entailed common sense and using that soft, squidgy thing between your ears (and no I don't mean the spot on my nose). Upon getting a "normal" job I discovered management didn't need either of those properties. I feel cheated.&nbsp; I cannot for reasons of self preservation divulge details (see "100 reasons for never getting married" for previous examples) so I will skip round the details like a switched on pedestrian would skip round a turd on the pavement. Suffice to say, I find it appalling that such a pathetic excuse for a human could possibly manage to breathe without an instruction manual, nevermind manage a team of workers.   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

         CVs have always baffled me. Now your average interviewer must know most of what they are reading should be filed under "creative writing" in their cabinet and the interviewee sure as hell knows the words composed on that document  are about as factually correct as Robert Maxwells 100metre swimming certicate. Yet, bizarrely, the pretense is kept up by both parties during an actual interview. I recently had to write a CV and of course i kept the essentials in and lied about nothing (you never know, my new boss may read&nbsp;this) but when i got to the section headed "personal interests" i was in two minds as to whether or not i should be brutally honest or do the usual and put more spin on it than your average US government hawk. Here were the options.     &nbsp;    What they want to hear&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     I am self motivated and organised.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     The Truth     I&nbsp;find it hard dragging myself to the kitchen to actually eat most days, and have no idea where my socks are kept.     What they want to hear     I consider myself pro-active.     The Truth     I went outside once...it was cold.     What they want to to hear     I am a team player and work well with people.     The Truth     Please give me a job where i get to work alone, and dont even think about taking things from my desk.     What they want to hear     I am ambitious, driven and have a will to succeed.     The Truth     Pay me each month and im happy.     What they want to hear     I am an outgoing, confident person.     The Truth     I will talk to you, but i will be thinking about whats on TV that night and nodding. oh and i really actually dispise you, but hey, no use making enemies at work.     &nbsp;   As you can imagine i went for what they wanted to hear.   &nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp;

       1, Mother-in-laws. 2, Mother-in-laws. 3, Mother-in-laws. 4, Mother-in-laws ..... 99, Mother-in-laws. 100, Fa-no wait, Mother-in-laws.  Today folks, I am going to talk about my Girlfriends mum.   I would call her a battleaxe, yet feel it would be unfair as battleaxes serve a purpose. I would call her a dragon, but that would involve me imagining her breathing (even if it  was  fire). I would call her every name under sun, but the sun never shines where she lives. Harsh words I hear you bellow at the screen. Not harsh enough I bellow back. Myself and The Woman That Shall Remain Nameless (she-devil for short) have never seen eye to eye, at first I thought it was because she was cross-eyed but later discovered its because we just don't get on. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate her (as such) hate is such a strong word isn't it? Dislike, now theres a fluffy word. Detest, less fluffy, not as strong as hate, yeah that will do.  Now, I am in a unique position here (mental note to self, I really must send that take yoga book back to the library) my girlfriend happens to be in a bad mood with her family today, so when asked "what can I write about today?" she replied "write about my bleeding mother, you could rant all day about that!". Little did she realise I would take her up on that offer and am clearly writing about aforementioned mother.  Nothing I ever say or do will ever change the fact her mother doesn't like me, why bother kidding myself. Lets be honest, if you are going to be hated by someone, you might as well get your moneys worth out of the situation and rant about her to the world on a website! I am just extremely glad she will never find out due to not being able to read....  DISCLAIMER. THIS POST IS ENTIRELY FICTIONAL. THE CHARACTERS IN THIS RANT MAY RESEMBLE REAL LIFE PEOPLE, BUT I ASSURE YOU THIS IS ENTIRELY COINCIDENTAL. THE AUTHOR WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT THE VIEWS EXPRESSED ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO FALLACY AND CREATIVE LICENSE AND SHOULD BE TAKEN AS BEING MADE UP AND ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE ACTUAL VIEWS OF THE AUTHOR.*   *just in case she ever learns to read.

       I dearly hope most of the planet have no idea what I am about to rant about. There is an evil brewing in Europe as you read this that is affecting our very children. Like a forest fire it is spreading indiscriminately across the European union, destroying all in its path and sadly I fear it is too late. Damage limitation is the only way from here on in. And what is this disease, this plague I speak of? "Dragostea Din Tei' by Ozone.  Now, I admit at first I was duped into thinking it was a funny song. I naively assumed that there was no way on this earth someone would produce such a stupid song, so clearly it had to be a parody, a cunning mockery of boybands, with tongue firmly lodged in cheek. Oh how could I have been so stupid!?! I implore anyone reading this, download Kazaa then download this song. Only when your nostrils fill with the fetid stench of satans armpits will you truly know hell. Your music collection is the ying, this travesty of noise is the yang.   Our continent is notorious for producing these bubbles of evil that surface randomly from the devils own satanic bath, but normally we have proven ways to deal with them. Once a year we round them all up for public trial to be tortured in front of millions until their very will to live is torn from their souls, we call this process the eurovison song contest.

       Right first off.... i am 25. There are two types of people that frequent places like Gullivers World. There are Kids and there are Parents. The Kids love the little rides and the stupidly dressed workers. The Parents love the fact the Kids aren't clinging to their legs and are out of their hair. Now I am proud of the fact I come under neither of those categories, I am not a Kid, and thankfully I am not a Parent. So it is safe to say it defies all known logic that a man such as I should want to partake in going to the Armpit of Warrington to get randomly smacked into by little sprogs and getting funny looks by adults for being the only 25 year old.   I really wish Dante was still alive today, I would go round to his house and drag him by his hair all the way to Gullivers World and explain to him that when he came up with our latter day perception of Hell he couldn't have been further from reality. Hell is a place in Warrington. Hell is walking round a manmade complex surrounded by people you don't belong with. Hell is discovering every single purveyor of crap in the place you are stuck in refuses to sell real coke and tries to palm you off with Virgin Cola. Hell is spending 4 hours in a kid infested nightmare then discovering you are only half way round the place and have another 4 hours to go. Hell is a place where your girlfriend refuses to accept your honest assessment of your contortionist skills every time she tries to persuade you to go on a ride designed for people under 5 foot.  Hell is two mice miming abba songs on a podium "for the kiddies" who clearly don't have the foggiest who the hell abba are and would have been happy with pretty pictures and mirrors that make them look weird. Hell is spending time with someone else's family and being the centre of cringingly embarrassing conversations that normally start with the line "aww, you look sooo good together, but..". Hell is being told to cheer up by a man that looks like he just discovered he is going to have his john thomas amputated by shortsighted spoon wielding monkey with bad hygiene. Hell is Gullivers World.

       I am sat here on hold typing with one hand as I wait patiently to sort my electricity bill out. Apparently my call is important to them and they are doing everything possible to get me an advisor, but its got to the point where all I want is for this crappy tune to go away. There must be a helpline set up where they do requests for PhoneHold FM. I wonder how long the queue is for that.....Oh well.  "hello, is that mister Halkyard?" said the woman cheerfully "I am afraid the direct debit we set up for you didn't get finalised by one of my colleagues, and although you have been sat blissfully ignorant by making the naive assumption that we have been taking your money out of your account, the bill has in fact been mounting up. I would just like to apologise on behalf of the thousands of semi trained monkeys that are currently packed into this tiny room I work in, for the unacceptable levels of ineptness you have encountered. Also please ignore the nasty letters we sent you stating the imminent arrival of the police and possibly a justice of the peace to your doorstep. We understand this may have caused you some distress and we can only emphasis dearly our discomfort for one of our valued customers"   meanwhile, back in the real world...   "Hello sir, i'm afraid we didn't take your money out, oops nevermind eh!"

       Imagine if you will a pavement with three lanes. Now use a bit of creative license and randomly place pedestrians on aforementioned pavement. With me so far? Good. Now, continue in your minds eye and lets get all these people moving in the same direction, sticking rigidly within their own lanes but have some move at slightly different speeds(nothing drastic mind, just small variations). Now comes the tricky part, once a person catches up with someone in front, you will need to imagine them into the next lane  as long  (now this bits important) as they do not obstruct anyone in doing so (if they do, simply imagine their speed down a bit). Now step back (mentally of course) and admire your creation, looks simple doesn't it, and effective too. Keep the image to mind though, we are going to need it shortly.  So, you have a load of people walking down a pavement, all in the same direction, all roughly the same speed. If one of those people accidently bumped into someone, they would look very silly wouldn't they? I mean, its not often people bump into each other walking through town (and not many pavements have our deluxe three lane design) In fact it would take an act of sheer ignorance/stupidity to get two pedestrians to collide in this collective mental image we have created. Okay, so clearly its easy, the  system  works, one might even say its fool proof.  So why the hell do vehicles collide on the motorway then???  Because when your average fool gets behind the wheel of a car, normal fool physics go out of the window. They change, they evolve. Welcome, dear friends to the Super Breed of Fool, I give you..... The Motorway Driver.  The Motorway Driver would never dream of pushing in the queue of your local supermarket but once he is in a car, he will happily zoom past a large line of traffic waiting to come off and then at the last possible moment signal, stop then push in. The Motorway Driver thinks he is indestructible. Wagons, coaches and other large vehicles are soft and sqidgy so what possible danger could arise from pulling out in front of them? The Motorway Driver doesn't need lights on in bad weather conditions,  he  can see fine, what does it matter? The Motorway Driver doesn't need indicators whilst traveling,  he  sure as hell knows where he is going, isn't it obvious to other drivers too? The Motorway Driver fears nothing, knows exactly where he going and slows for no-one, unless of course there has been an accident on the  other side  of the motorway.

       I am seriously getting worried, My girlfriend Seonaid (that's pronounced "yes dear") has been on holiday for a little over a week now and i'm running out of socks. If only she had told me where they were stored before leaving for sunny Spain I wouldn't be in this mess. She could have at least told me how to use the washing machine, I tried it the other day, there's no remote for it and I can't find the mouse either, ill just have to wait till she gets back.  I think its a grand conspiracy, Girlfriends MAKE you rely on them for things like this, they make sure whenever possible you are left in the dark so when the time comes and they aren't there and you are looking forward to a fortnight of playing games, all you spend your time doing is worrying about where the next sock is coming from. Don't even get me started on The Underpant Situation. There are some advantages to this renewed semi-freedom I am experiencing though. Today in lieu of proper food (I once applied to be on both teams on that TV show "cant cook, won't cook") I went searching for fast food and chanced upon a chip shop not a hundred yards from my door! Also, I have had the time to create this website and dedicate some time to it (what do you mean that's not an advantage? What the hell do you know!).  Of course, I can't talk about my girlfriends absence without mentioning how much I miss her (sock cleaning expertise) and how much I wish she was here (to explain the washing machine thingy). Deep down, i am a romantic. But above all I am a malnutritioned soon to be sockless, washing machineless male with no idea where the spatula is and even less idea what to bloody do with it even if I had it.

       I can hardly type. I am actually shaking all over in excitement. This morning I received a highly confidental email off a well-to-do ethopian banker. Apparently this guy was waiting for one of his investors to transfer 25 million dollars into his bank, but discovered that the investor had actually been killed in a car crash! Now this man left no will, but clearly the banker still had the smell of uber cash in his nostrils and came up with a plan. He needed someone from the UK to act on the investors behalf (according to ethiopian law it has to be a foreigner, imagine that) and transfer all that money into this reputable mans bank. And can you guess who this ethiopian chose for this enterprise? Yes, that's right, of all the people in all the world, he sends ME an email asking ME PERSONALLY to help sort this situation out, and I am going to get a whopping TWENTY PERCENT of that cash!!!  Now that's pretty lucky I hear you shout. But wait, it gets better. I returned home from work today to find another email. This one was from a big cheese in the Nigerian oil industry, the story goes that this man needs investment into his petroleum ventures, the email states everything quite clearly that any investment, no matter how small, would bring unbelievable returns. Now, at this point I have to admit I was pretty flabbergasted, I couldn't believe my luck, I had only just that day been told I am the proud owner of five million dollars and then along comes a completely sound airtight business venture for me to sink my teeth into.   The world is a funny place, but I have a feeling about these emails, they simply ooze legitimacy. Ill keep you all posted.

       This is all the fault of Mister Willis (Ja to his friends). I am of the opinion that everyone has at least  something  you can rely on them to do. The aforementioned Mister Willis is renowned throughout the lands for his uncanny ability to produce a truly random word (thankfully I have never asked him to think of a password). So, having spent the weekend void of motivation I called upon his mighty services to send forth a word, any word, that could trigger an eruption of creative lava that would pour down on my Pompeii-esque screen of emptiness and err, well it would kill it surely, I mean have you ever seen lava rip through a town? Hold on, I am straying here. Sorry.  And what was the word he shot at me without a seconds thought? "joviality". I had to mentally dust off the section of my brain that stored that word and still I doubted its meaning. I resorted to dictionary.com just to make sure, and all my fears came true... I have to write about being cheerful and happy. goddammit its just not fair.   Being happy is for other people, it makes me inwardly happy to see  other  people happy, I can be inwardly cheerful when I see something that amuses me but I draw the line at holding a gun to my body and forcing it to follow suit. You see, my body and my mind go way back, They haven't seen eye to eye for some time. The mind is forever willing but the body, alas, is unable. I gave up trying to persuade it otherwise, it has its own agenda and seldom bothers to include my mind in its plans. So next time you see me walking down the street visibly slouched and looking like I had the winning lottery numbers but had inadvertently wiped my arse with the ticket, then forgive me, I am really quite jovial.

       Bit of a misleading title today, it should really be "lack of Motivation" but to be honest I really cannot be bothered changing it. Weekends have a habit of doing that don't they? Some weekends I can just get up and shout "come on! Bring it on! I wanna use exclamation marks all day long!!!" other weekends I slither out of bed, don a pair of shorts,a teeshirt that looks like shrek blew his nose on it and mope around the house. Well today (as you can guess) im on shorts and teeshirt duty.  Its hard in this kind of mood to actually build up the effort to rant about anything, In fact im impressed im even typing thi-

       I am a simple man. See, a bit of honest self criticism never does anyone any harm. I'm simple because my mind cannot deal with this modern society and its username and password fetish. From an early age i realised this and happily trundled through life with ONE username and ONE password. It was only when a college friend of mine who shall remain nameless (hi there Jay if you are reading this :P) thought it would be funny to log onto my yahoo page and tinker with it that i realised the error of my ways. Good old predictable Kin was devastated! I felt violated and tainted (well, actually i just thought it was immensely amusing but i feel the need to exercise artistic license from time to time). From then on i had to try to remember a plethora of obscure character groups (i refuse to call them words, it would be like calling a bacon and sausage sandwich a pig). I thought all was well and my brain was actually coming to terms with having to remember completely unrelated nonsense. and it was, that is, it was until last night. I wanted to transfer this blog site from kincronicles.blogspot.com (yeah i know, i spelt chronicle wrong) to www.kinackin.net i needed my ftp username and password. could i remember the damn password? could i buggery. last night i was a one man password cracking machine, fervently smashing away at the keyboard trying every word i have ever used, every nonsensical collection of letters i could think of, every pattern of letter on the keyboard, everything bar the password i was in need of.  It was a long night.  I got it in the end (as you can probably guess from the www.kinackin.net written in the address bar) and do you know how? could you possibly guess how, after all that messing around i  finally  got the password? yes, thats right, i just asked  my mate chris (who has access to the server i use) to change the password, can you believe that? all that effort could have been saved with just one phone call! Now i firmly believe if my head wasnt filled up with all those daft excuses for words, then i would have made the mental leap and landed firmly on the other side of my cranial obstacle (that metaphor went a bit wrong i think)  Theres a moral to this story, sadly my brain is completely frazzled and i can't for the life of me think what it is.

       I have seen many things in my life, many strange things for which no answer can be found. I wont go into details but suffice to say i consider myself immune to surprise. But something shocked me to the core a while back, and i am forcing myself to investigate. Blogs. What's all that about? Now come on, seriously, it beggars belief that the casual goings on of your average joes mundane existance can possibly be considered entertainment in these days of high techery and click of a button porn access. Yet, bizarrely, its a growing thing "they" tell me. its the future "they" say. well far be it from me to stand erect in the path of such an overwhelming force. If you can't berate them, join them, then berate them with the very thing thats makes them beratable (still with me? good).  So basically (though you will soon learn 'basic' and 'Kin' are words which normally dont get to meet up) i am going to do a blog that mocks blogs. Irony doesnt even begin to describe it. But! (and this is a Michelle McManus sized but) although i will be jumping on the bandwagon as the saying goes, instead of actually sitting on it and enjoying the ride, i will be holding a gun to the wagondrivers head and insisting he take me to the airport, and he best damn well have an airplane waiting for me, fueled up and ready to fly to err, umm, well just ready to fly dammit!  ok i'll shut up now.... Welcome to Kin Chronicles, its all downhill from here.

        Ok I held off as long as I could, I have tried since day one to stay off the political posting, but after reading an online news report I can no longer contain myself. The President of the United States of America is a moron. I am totally convinced the reason they cart him about in a car with blacked out windows is because if they didn't, the people of America would see their most powerful man either licking the window with a glazed look in his eyes or reading his Calvin and Hobbes comic book.  I wonder how someone with his mental prowess managed to get so powerful, maybe when he was younger he applied for the post of village idiot but filled in the wrong form and ended up as a senator. At least the British Leader has an iota of sense in his inflated head. In this age of increasing strife and melting pot politics isn't it reassuring to read the supposed 'most powerful man alive' say at a meeting "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful - and so are we, they never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people - and neither do we"  you think that was a one off? We all makes gaffes from time to time, but this man really takes the biscuit (or should that be pretzel). Look up "bushisms" in google, go on, right now I can wait a minute....      done it?      can you BELIEVE some of that stuff? I wouldn't let this guy open a tin of beans for me, nevermind run a country. Do you see many hits for blairisms or *insert random head of state here*  isms? No, whys that do you think? Its because normally when people vote for people they choose fully functional human beings with the ability to rule a nation and hopefully string a coherent sentence together.      That "I know something you don't know" smirk irritates me too. So what mister bigshot, so you know the truth behind area 51 and are privy to all manner of juicy intelligence. At least we can count to 51, at least we know what the hell privy means and above all else, we HAVE intelligence, well some of us do anyway.       I read the other day that a lot of Americans actually find these kind of qualities endearing. It makes him "normal". Since when have leaders been normal, you look around on a bus on the way to work, that's a group of normal people, see that guy reading the paper with the bits of tissue stuck to his chin, that's normal, but would you want him running your country? No, me neither.       I am sorry if I have offended any Americans out there by dissing your number one man, but lets be honest, the guy is a schmuck.

        Forgive me readers for I have sinned. It has been ten days since my last rant. I have read other peoples blogs and they complain about burn out and writers block and other such stuff. Well I have never really suffered from all that, I mean lets face it, I could rant about anything and everything. I just suffer from being a lazy swine.       I have been badly afflicted with this curse since a child. I like to call it the sod it syndrome. I often come up with great schemes and masterplans, think them through to the smallest detail, then along comes the little voice in my head, takes one look at my schematics, gives a little knowing chuckle and shouts "sod it, read a book dude".      I have a cunning plan for capturing this little voice and getting him to stop squatting in my head. Sadly, I have a funny feeling he will tell me to sod it...      anyway!      today's rant...       Management       Now I have probably waffled on about this kind of thing before, but sod it its my chosen specialist subject and im in the big black chair so im in charge. I have a manager at work, he should probably remain nameless, but for the purposes of this rant ill call him Brian. I would give you his surname but sadly I cant spell Cadwallader. Anyway I digress. Brian oozes ineptitude like a geeks face oozes puss. This man seems to be under the ridiculous impression being hated is a good managerial trait. Well I don't know about you but I always thought traits a manager would want to have might consist of such things as organisation, man management skills, unflappability (might have made that word up) and above all else, common sense.       Who wants a manager that looks down on everybody and tries to make them feel small for the sole purpose of making themselves feel bigger? Who wants to be treated like a child and reprimanded for chatting to someone? Who wants to be managed by a short, balding, squealing, attention seeking moron? Please, who wants him? Because they can sodding well have him.
