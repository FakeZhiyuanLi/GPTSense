      I was under the impression that becoming a Christian would cure me of all I hate about myself. Perhaps it will - in fact I believe it will. But what I was unprepared for was the pain and confusion in it all.  I have no clue where this blog will go, but at this moment I would like it to be a place where I can talk candidly about living in the swamp while hoping and looking for better things.

      This is Sarah writing. Today we read "On the Banks of Plum Creek" (It is one of the Little House on the Prairie Books).  Mom bought me markers for learning to read. I have been very busy making Halloween decorations which I taped to the front window. I also wrote a book called "Ma and the Cats".   The two cats jump on Ma. Ma is hurt. The two cats run. Ma yells. (The end)  Tonight we are going out trick or treating for Halloween. We are going to be pirates. As soon as we woke up we got on our costumes. I am in charge of everyone's makeup. I am using my new markers to put stitches & tattoos on all the kids. Matt has a tattoo of a big heart with 'Mom' inside, and then it is crossed out. On the other arm he has a heart with Dad in the middle, crossed out. For swords we are using butter knives & pencils. All my brothers got the their hair cut very short so they would look like scary pirates. We made a sign for the front door that said 'open' so kids in the neighborhood would know we have candy to give them. We couldn't find any tape to stick the sign on with so we used a band-aid to stick it to the door.

      Hey this Dan.  I was just looking back at the time when I threw my shoes off the balcony at a church.  I was a little kid and always went into the nursery at an old church in Waterloo.  I saw that the door was open and I decided to go out.  I got out and I looked down over the balcony.  I took my shoes off and I threw with all my might.  It landed right near a handicapped man and the whole service just stopped and everybody looked at me.

      As you can tell I am not censoring this blog TOO MUCH. One thing to clarify though. Marsha and I figured out that the kids hate it when we kiss - all the more if they think we are french-kissing (which by-the-way we actually cannot do because Marsha suffers from a rare condition known as "stubby tongue disease" - she could never stick her tongue out at people when she was a kid). Anyway, this kissing thing has given us a quick way of getting rid of the kids when we want to.  Here is another picture of Sam ... he decided he wanted to go to school and dressed himself.

      The only thing that happened today is that mom and dad are french-kissing upstairs even despite efforts to stop them involving me and danny attemting seperate them one way or the other. Unfortunately dad had hurt his shoulder and so we had to stop and so now they are kissing.  So I escaped down here so I could walk around without my eyes closed.

      Hello this is Dan.  I finished my math in section II.  I have to go through units now and right now it is pretty easy.  Sammy is browsing through the under the stairs looking for 2 apples.  Shoot he just found them.  We played a game of Bibleopoly (It is a game like Monopoly except you buy Bible cities instead of properties and the first one to build a full church wins) last night and I won.  We had to stop in the middle of the game because Dad had to leave.  It turned out that i won because I won the jackpot.  Everybody had to put half their money towards the jackpot and i got it all because I was in meditation and i rolled a double five and that is the square where you get all the money in the jackpot.  If we went on playing I would get a cornerstone and I would pay for the three bricks and the steeple and I would of won.

      Hey this is Dan.  I recently figured out that Sammy shoplifted a toy that makes christmas lights flicker.  Katelyn and Sarah went to a friend's house and we got to see a retired hockey player.  His name was Mike Reynolds.  He left with Dad and I only got to see him for a short time.

      I was curious.  It was one of those times when I thought I could do something cool and nothing too serious would happen.  I was sitting at the table and I saw the Soya sauce. I picked it up. I thought if I squirted it up it would make a nice soya sauce fountain, but not go too high. I thought nothing really bad would happen.  But then I looked up and the soya sauce was on the ceiling and dripping a little bit. And so I got a rag and first cleaned up the table and everything went perfect (because it was varnished the soya sauce didn't sink in).  Then I tried to clean up the ceiling and everything went horrible. I tried to clean up the little drops on ceiling but it made a big smudge. I knew I would get in trouble, so I just said to myself:  Tell the truth if they find out and in 60 years it won't matter.  A few days ago we (the kid boys) decided that we could start a club (the crazy hair club).  Sammy was the first to go.  Sarah was following us everywhere so we had to cancel the situation.  Now today we resumed and we made Sammy a huge Spinosaurus spike hair do.  Dad will probably put it in our blog.  If not, I'm a monkey's uncle.  Well I have to go!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      I arrived home tonight and noticed a substancial splotch on our kitchen ceiling - very central, very noticeable - very much a painting job to be added to my already lengthy "Needs Repair" list. Marsha didn't know where it came from, but suspected that it was from a hot chocolate fight. Apparently Dan had been making hot chocolate earlier in the day. I called Dan to ask him what it was. We were right that he was the culprit, but we were wrong about the weapon. He was sitting at the table and squeezed a Soya Sauce bottle so that it shot up and hit the ceiling. I asked whether he knew that it would shoot up in the air and hit the ceiling. "I knew that it would shoot up in the air, but I didn't expect it to go that high."  What do you do?

      Sammy came up the stairs today yelling at us "My penis is broken, my penis is broken!" At first we didn't believe that was what he was saying but we soon realized that that was what he was saying, although fortunately it was not what he meant. He walked up beside mum and that's when everyone saw that his diaper was half fallen off (the word you used was close enough sammy!) Everyone laughed and we fixed his diaper.  Dan is truly in love with his new (bright purple) library card. He went into the bathroom today and starting singing in a false opera voice "MY LLIIIIIIIIIIIBRARY CARD"  over and over and over again. I hope he doesn't read this.

      I was away in PEI for a few days with work. It is good to be home. I like the feeling of walking through the door and Marsha and all the kids clamour to see me and hug me and kiss me. Being loved is a metamorphic experience.

      Hey this is Dan.  I just got a new library card that is bright purple and I can't wait to use it tomorrow.  Sammy is still acting like the incredible hulk running around the house making messes and destroying things saying "I am angry" Katelyn got a scratch from Sammy and I have minor eczema.  I woke up itching like crazy.  I made some hot chocolate and it went away soon after that.  I still have a little tinge though.  Now that I know how to make hot chocolate I can make some and have a nice refreshing drink and read a book called Harry the poisonous centipede.  Bye!!!

      Okay so Sammy is a knight, Matthew is a mess,  Sarah is crazy, I am a janitor and same with Katelyn.  Sammy is usually running around the house half naked destroying everything in his path like the Incredible Hulk.  Matthew is like Dennis the menace. And Sarah is like just Sarah.  CRAZY!!!!!!!  And I am just cleaning up everything that is in my path like a janitor in a litter room (I mean a lot of litter more than you see near Captain William Spry Public Library).  Our house is a litter room.  See ya!!!!!

      It has turned out that our family is very destructive.  Sammy was playing In the bathtub.  I don't know what he as playing but something like, "torture the rubber ducky".  When I went inside the washroom I noticed that the ducky's beak had been ripped right off and Sammy stood in the bathtub looking triumphantly at me looking like he just beat up fifteen knights with one spear and one throw like Sir Lancelot.  We have just gone apple-picking and so we won't need storebrought apples for a couple of years.  Sammy is depressed with all the apples and every time we open the under the stairs(that is where the apples are)Sammy whines and screams and fights for two apples.  One in each hand.  We have a new game which is called Cheeky-butt where somebody pinches somebody's cheek and twists it around until they can't take it anymore.  Then somebody ends up with a black eye. Sammy usually does the pinching but he never gets a black eye because of his incredible blocking power.  If somebody tries to punch him he simply puts his arm out and the puncher's puncher backfires and they get a black eye.  Well I have to go!

      Friday nights are often late and I don't eat until I get home. When I did get home last night I asked one of the kids what they had for supper. I quote the response, "I had this pasta thing but I wish I didn't because it made me go number three."   This morning I woke up to Matt and Sam fighting. I wasn't sure if it was real or not. Matt kept saying to Sam, "I'm going to wreck you!" Matt is about twice Sam's height and in a very wired stage. Sam had finally had enough and replied, "NO! I'm going to wreck you!!" Sam, who is twice Matt's width attacked him like a bulldog. Fortunately it turned out they were only goofing around so I didn't have to break them up (get up that is).   A little later Sam came upstairs complaining that his blanket was broken. In one hand he was holding his blanked which had a rather large morsel dangling by a few threads but still precariously attached. In his other hand he sported a bread knife. It was time to get up.

      We had an exciting (kind of) day today.  I had a band lesson at 9:10. At around 8:30 the power went out at our house. Ok i thought, maybe the power is still on at the school. So i walked all the twenty minute walk to the school and was just gonna look inside to see if the power was on but unfortunately that wasn't possible because the windows on the doors were all covered with hot pink posters that were proclaiming that everyone had to vote for Jaqui for president (whatever that means). So I walked into the school and what do you know, i had walked all the twenty minute there all for nothing. So i walked the twenty minutes back and twenty minutes after I got back the power came back on, just in time for the sceduled end of the lesson. There is another practice at twelve o'clock which i plan to go to if the power doesn't go off again.  Sam is standing in a pillow case and jumping all around the basement and when he falls down he looks at me and says Wooow. It is very cute but also kind of distracting.

      I had a very busy day yesterday so i didn't write in the blog. Last night we had some guest called Tim and Deanna Underwood and they stayed overnight. They gave us a game called Bibleopoly, kind of like monopoly only it is all bible related. So instead of jail you have to go to meditation, instead of houses you build churches, and all the properties are biblical cities. They also gave us some toy airplanes and gave me a book which was good because i love reading.   Mum also cooked lots of good breakfast food because they were coming so i was really happy about that because of course they couldn't eat it all and so i got to eat some of it.

      Yesterday was my birthday. I passed through most of the day feeling really tired and spacey, until I attempted making a pumpkin pie from scratch. Miraculously it worked out. At night i ate schnitzel and loads of salad and some potatos and peas and bread. Then I got my presents. I got a CD that i wanted and also a computer game that i wanted from my parents. I also got a homemade coupon for lunch at ZEN with dad. I got a lot of funky jewlery, a necklace, bracelet and earrings all made out of clothespin hinges from dan and Sarah and i also got a bracelet made out of clothes pins. I got a bathroom set which consisted of a brush, a toothbrush holder, and a soap holder. I also got a funky calculator which is good because i will need one for my next math book. I got a rock that is supposed to be a geode inside but i havn't broken it open yet so i don't know. Oh! I found a penny in one of the gift bags so i guess i got that too. I also got some money from my relatives that live in ontario and quebec. I'm pretty satisfied with all the stuff i got and i am really, really happy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Hey this is Matthew.  People have to be nice.  People are sometimes nice but not all the time.  Yesterday we had some guests over for dinner because it was Katelyn's birthday.  I sat down with Wolf, one of our guests.  I watched him play on his electric guitar.  I thought it was cool.  Hello this is Dan. It was really fun on Katelyn's birthday.  We went apple picking and it was fun.  We also went on a hayride and it was really cool also.  Matthew saw a pear orchard.  I don't know where the apples went after we got home but they were really ripe and crispy and also very good.  I am starving for one now.  I can't wait till Halloween because i am also starving for candy(and mashed turnip my favorite mashed vegetable).

      This is Sarah writing. Mommy and I are reading Little House in the Big Woods by Laura Ingalls Wilder. I like it because it is interesting and also because when we read I get to snuggle with mom. We went apple picking on Saturday. We had lots of fun. We picked apples, we went on a hayride around the apple orchard. While we were on the hayride mom picked apples. Then we were all yelling at her to climb on the haywagon which she did. Sammy played on a toy tractor but then when we had to leave he cried and cried. We went to the petting zoo and the animals escaped from the pen. I was scared because I was right by the Billygoat & I was getting squished by the sheep. Yesterday was Thanksgiving. We had turkey, stuffing, turnip, scalloped potatoes, cranberries and salad. Then we watched "Daddy Daycare" Our friend Glen came to Thanksgiving. After the movie we got apple pie for dessert. We went to bed very late. Today is Katelyn's birthday & our friends Anna (Katelyn's friend)& Randy (our family's friend) are coming for dinner. We are going to give Katelyn a choice between a birthday bath (cold water with all her clothes on) OR 12 birthday spankings as she is 12 (this is what they did in Little House in the Big Woods). We made a necklace and earrings for Katelyn out of clothes pin hinges.

      I woke up this morning to two interesting sights (see photos below). Katelyn woke up early and began working on cutting up turnip for Thanksgiving. Sarah, who makes costumes out of anything, siezed the opportunity to become a Turnip Princess while Sam, left to his own devices, put on all his new socks.  Yesterday we went apple picking. I marvel at how the child's mind works. We had not been on the road for more than a few minutes before sighting a dead raccoon. Dan yelled, "Hey look, a dead raccon!" To which Matt replied, "Hey! Dan! Let's make up and play a roadkill game!"                                         Sam in Socks

      I need to make a correction in mom's blog entry. I did in no way suggest that the kids should elevate Matthew in the garbage can with the pulley. If anything I suggested that they not do it because it was too dangerous. Maybe mom misunderstood.   Also Mom and Dan were not my poorly paid lab assistants, because they weren't payed at all!!  I saw a girl that used to go to Kids Club before they didn't have it anymore named Stephanie. I last saw her in May at her church near my house. Now she is taking violin lessons with a lady in our neigbourhood. Maybe i will see her more when she is getting dropped off.  Today I went to my band practice. It was at lunch so it didn't start till about quarter after 12 because everyone was eating lunch except me because I ate at home. There were some guys in eighth and ninth grade who were already finished and every single one of them played either electric guitar or drums. I was trying to practice but they were so loud i couldn't hear myself. So i didn't practice and just sat there until the music teacher told everyone to sit down and play the right way with very little electric guitar. Ahh.  I have to clean the kitchen after supper so i will write more some other time.

      While at the library yesterday Danny was working on a geography question "What is a vizier?" He looked up the definition & then had to answer the question "What Biblical figure was a vizier?" He drew a blank on this so thought he would get help from a reference librarian. Her first question was, "are you sure you are supposed to be asking me for help?" Her second thought was, "I'll see if I can find a Bible around here". She had to look up what a vizier was. Don't tell me, readers, that you don't know what this is either? Well, neither did I! It means "a high official of a muslim state". The librarian started looking up books on famous Viziers and Dan waited patiently for her to pull the books from the shelves. After about 20 minutes the answer popped into Dan's head "Oh Cindy, I just figured it out! It is Joseph! Thanks I don't need your help anymore."    Today Katelyn was learning about simple machines & had Dan & I acting as her humble and poorly paid lab assistants by holding brooms which she wrapped nylon rope around. She explained to us dimwits how pulleys work. (I'm not sure if I quite got it so if you want more details you'll have to e-mail her). But Dan & the younger kids certainly understood. This afternoon they are using this same nylon rope in an elaborate pulley system that involves elevating a garbage can into a tree so they could use it as a basketball hoop. (This involved Sarah's death-defying one-handed manoevering of the pulley system in and out of the branches of the tree). Katelyn thought this was brilliant & suggested they try to elevate Matthy IN the garbage can. YES this is somewhat dangerous & perhaps I should be supervising them, but I fear my presense may stifle their creativity & scientific discovery.

      We read our friend Wally's BLOG yesterday. He is working in Uganda with people who have AIDS. We found out that of the 2000 children in one hospital only 200 of them could afford the drugs that would make them feel better. The drugs cost only $25 per month. I felt very sad that they were dieing. It would be good if ALL of them had the chance to recover. Mom, Katelyn & I prayed and asked God to heal the children. It would be a miracle and God is the performer of miracles. We were thinking that we could buy a goat for one family. It could have babies that they could sell. The goat would produce milk that could be sold. The money the family gets could be used to send the kids to school (since they can't afford to do it) or pay for the drugs for the kids that have AIDS. The goat would cost $120.00. We are praying that God will show us how to get the money.

      Hi I'm Sarah. Me and Sammy were taking a bath and I don't ususally do this but I washed Sammy's hair and got him ready for bed. And Sammy today was stomping on the floor all the time. He made so much noise that it hurt my ears. Dad whistled really loud and it hurt my ears. We made up poems around the supper table. Dad said - Matti Matti with a big stench, please get your bum off the bench.  I flew so high that I could not see our house but everyone else was pointing to it. This happened a few weeks ago when I went for a plane ride in Wally's airplane.

      Hi, I'm Katelyn and I am Dan's sister. My dad remarked over the supper table that dan had already made two posts and I hadn't so I guess I better start writing. The only reason I am the janitor of the house is because Dan is too thick-headed to think that maybe he could be a janitor too. I love it when I am in my room with a friend because that means Dan has to do my "janitor" work.   I love to read and unlike Dan about 80% of the books I get are ok for me.   Today i went over to Wally and Marys house because the tree that they had in their front yard fell on top of their house because of Hurricane Juan. We got there a little late and they had already got the top of the tree off the roof of the house and from the talk of the neigbours apparently quite skillfully had manuevered it through the powerlines. The tree crew was all the way from New Hampshire in the states. Their house had no damage at all which was kind of a miracle.  Its 7:30 pm not the time that it says i posted it.

      So it is now official that me Sarah and Katelyn are the new janitors of the house, while dad sits on the sofa doing bills  (Stressful work).  Matthew and Sam usually just play on the computer.  I hate it when Katelyn is not there or if her friend is over because then she doesn't  work and just is in her room talking or doing something fun.  My 2 best friends, Dean and Tate are moved out so I only have a semi-friend and another friend that I am not comfortable.  Sammy is learning new words every day.  Today I was playing in the basement and he called me a "Cheeky-butt", and I was extremely surprised

      Hey, I am Dan, I am also in the Abarbanel family and I will be posting Blogs as well as my dad. sister and Mom.  I am nine years old and I love to play soccer,(of course I am in a league) and play any kind of computer game exept for the boring ones and the baby ones like Elections or Chutes and Ladders.  I have another hobby which is reading but when I call for a book in the library, only about ten percent of those books is even okay for me.  One of my top favorite series is, The Chet Gecko mysteries.  Well I hope you liked my intro on myself.  Goodbye!!!!

      We continue to recover from Hurricane Juan. We lost power for a week and the kids are tired of peanut butter and Jelly for breakfast, lunch and supper. I'm tired of cold showers. Our Deck has been reassembled. In some ways the hurricane was a pleasant diversion. We got to cut trees, play with chainsaws and walk around looking at the destructive power of wind.

      Matthew is opening a restaurant called "DEEP SEA CHICKEN". The logo will be a chicken with ocean bubbles all around it. Right now he is working on hiring staff. Today at church he hired Steve to do the music because he plays guitar. His lovely soft-spoken wife wanted to be a waitress but Matt has put her on security & menu design. What kind of restaurant needs security? Another pool of potential employees comes from grocery stores. Matt picked up 2 Junior High Girls to do cooking from Sobeys.  I suggested that he hire his Grandma & another 60's something friend of ours. But Matt said he doesn't want to hire any old people because they might make mistakes. However I pointed out that I thought 60 year old women who have been cooking for 55 years might be a better bet than the Junior High Girls he picked up at Sobeys. He also hired a librarian when she admitted that her grandson thinks she is a good cook. Matt asked for her phone number so she would know when to report to work. Menu items will include fries, burgers and any other foods the cooks want to make. But everyone must remember that Matt is the boss. Pay will be $80 per day. Matt wants the staff to know that if they make mistakes, they won't get in trouble. Matt is not going to hire kids to work at his restaurant. But he is going to hire Katelyn - because she is a kid that knows how to work. I (Marsha) have just been hired right in the middle of the blog.   Sammy is very scared of elevators because he got stuck in one at the library. So the other day we went for a hike in the woods near York Redoubt. Sammy got mad about something and plunked himself down on the ground. Daddy thought he would follow us after a while. But he didn't! So Daddy said "Look Sam there is an elevator coming". Sammy got up right away and came running towards us.

      This is Sarah writing. Everyday there is something exciting. The most exciting things happen on holidays like Christmas. I feel sorry for the kids who have small brain disease and other diseases in Uganda. I know someone who is in Uganda right now and he eats fried grasshoppers. Disgusting, YUK!! He also has a dog named GUK. We went to Tim Hortons this morning and got a snack pak of Tim Bits. Sammy thinks that Tim Bits are donuts.

      This is Sarah writing. It is hard to concentrate today because the boys are making so much noise. They are playing a game called "Jumping on Mom's Bed". This morning we were looking at pictures of some children in Uganda. They live in an orphanage. Some of them are mentally challenged and some of them have AIDS. When I saw the picture I felt very sad. I felt sorry for the children because they are almost dieing and they don't have enough food to eat. It is sad that some of them got very hurt by their moms and dads and some saw their parents die. Probably one child already died at the orphanage. The End.

      This is a little story that Sarah wrote this week. The title is "The Girl and the Boys" One day Susan played in her backyard. The gate was not closed. Two boys walked in to the yard. They asked Susan what her name was. The boys took her away after she told them her name. Just then Susan's mother Olivia called Susan. This was just after the boys left. Susan was not there. Her mom grabbed her coat and went out to look for her. It was too late. She called the police after she got back. Her father came home worried. The police found the two boys and put them in jail. The boys were told that they would have to give her $100 a month. The boys were told that they would have to clean the prison cells to get the money. THE END. (P.S. I asked Sarah what happened to Susan. She looked at me strangely & said "she went home with her parents. What did you think happened to her?" This gave me solace that Sarah had not been reading John Grisham novels & thinking deeply about kidnapping, extortion, murder, etc.)  Sam has very definate ideas about things (perhaps obstinate is the right word here?). He insists on wearing pink rubber boots outside & last year's too-small winter coat.  When I put a white sheet on his bed he sits down on the bed,  points at the sheet with a serious look on his face and says "this is not green". The light must stay on in his room at all times because he fears the dark. I've tried to reason with him that the light can be off when he is not in it, but he doesn't agree with my convaluted logic. When I try to hurry up his bedtime songs he looks up at me & gently says "try again".   When our coffee maker broke last week Dan & Sarah decided to make a new one for Ron. Many hours have been spent in Dan's room when Ron isn't around perfecting the model. They used a cardboard box, lots of duct tape, a water jug & a large measuring cup for the carafe. Today Dan asked me if he could use some coffee to see how well it worked! Dan has also taken it upon himself to educate Sarah. He has done a pretty good job inproving her reading & now he is drilling her on her times tables.

      Hey this is Dan, Yesterday we had 11 people come over to our house and so we had to clean up.  We were also putting Matthew in a laundry basket because he was playing in our properties.  We call it "the old west game" and Matthew was the man who always holds a rifle and pretends to shoot animals to the ground.   we caught him and shoved him in a laundry basket and put another laundry basket on top of that, to make it look sort of like an crammed prison.  I stayed up last night reading a book called "A lion to guard us" by Clyde Robert Bulla and it was really good.  Goodbye!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Wow nobody has been blogging lately. The kids are downstairs in the basement with me, yelling their heads off, and pretending that matthew is a prisoner. Which is a great source of delight to Sammy. We went to York Redoubt today, after mom and dad said we could have the day off school. Did I say that playing jail was a great source of delight for sammy? I meant it was only fun for him as long as Matthew was the one playing prisoner. Now he is screaming his head off because the kids tried to put him in a laundry basket. Fortunately they didn't succeed because he yelled loud enough that i  had to rescue him. We have 11 people coming over for supper tonight, and they are all in something medical. Dad suggested that we polish up on our medical knowledge, but i haven't really done that, and i don't really mean too. Although i did look up congenital heart failure (that is when you have genetic heart problems) so now i know what it is.

      Sorry I haven't blogged in a while, i think my last blog was in october. The reason for that is that one of the kids spilled something on the keyboard of the kids computer and so now we have no keyboard and i am using Moms computer. Last night we had some guests over, Glenn, Zöe, Matt, and T.J. I told Matt the pile-up joke (but i won't say it in here because i don't want people knowing it, but it has something to do with calling yourself something gross) and then i did the game trick on T.J. which he fell for gloriously and it was very fun. Then we played about 10 rounds of uno, all of which T.J. lost, with the exception of one where he came second place. I also went to the art gallery yesterday, and they were painting HUGE Dr. Seuss murals on the walls, and they were a lot of fun to watch until a fat security guard, after around 15 minutes of doing this (watching them) told us that the area was closed to the public until the 15th. He then proceeded to follow us through at least 5 galleries, which drove me and my Mom absolutely up the wall, before he finally left. I was really dissapointed  because I couldn't watch them paint the Dr. Seuss stuff.  Today i burn't my toast 3 times before i got some good toast. I think there is something wrong with our toaster, because it was set on the lightest toast time and it still burned.

      This is Sarah writing. Last night some students came over. Their names were Zoe, Glen, T.J. & Matt. We had a big supper of cranberry chicken, rice, green beans, salad & homemade bread made by Katelyn.  For dessert we had Brownies & coffee and tea. Matthy & I had berry tea. We like to drink it for tea parties & Mommy buys it special just for us. At tea parties we sometimes eat cake & ice cream. We like to drink our tea in really big mugs with 1 tablespoon of sugar. We hardly ever drink all of the tea because it gets sticky on our chins and we get tired of the taste.  Last night when the students came over we played Uno with B.C. rules. Everybody played well except the student Matt (who we called big Matt) and T.J. because they were just learning to play.  Yesterday in the morning we went to the Art Gallery of Nova Scotia. We saw beautiful paintings and wood carvings. They were also painting Dr. Seuss pictures on the walls. My favourite parts were the stained glass windows and the carvings. It was the beautifullest thing I have ever seen.

      Hello this is Dan, Today was a fun day.  We started off really lousy but it brightened up.  I went downstairs and I had breakfast.  The kids were making a mess and I had to clean it up.  Then I remembered that we were going to the art gallery today.  Most kids think the art gallery is boring but I like the portraits.  We saw pictures painted by Alex Colville, Arthur Lismer, Christopher and Mary Pratt and much more.  Even some Van Gogh.  We saw a carved stone that was from the first century and it was old!!  Its head came off the platter but they stuck it back on.  Then I went home and had lunch even though it was 2:00!!!  We had some friends over. their names were:  T.J., Zöe, Glenwood and Matt.  We played cards and had a lot of fun.  Bye!!!!!

      Hey, I am starting to get happy considering the fact that Christmas is only a month and a couple of weeks away.  Mom said that she might get Lego Racers (a race-car computer game) for Christmas and I can't wait!!!!  When Matthew gets to sit on Mom's knee when we read, Sammy screams and repeatedly punches him everywhere.  When Matthew can't take it anymore he fires a fist at him and Sammy punches him back twice as hard.  We scare Sammy by telling him that an elevator is going to get him if he dousn't stop, and he hides his head in Matthews pants.  When we start reading again he continues his bullfighting and Matthew drops unconscious on the floor and Sammy gets the seat on Mom's knee.  See, ya!!!!

      Hey this is Dan.  I am seeing things that I can't believe.  Sammy is destructive and smart.  He had to stay in the basement and he didn't want to (Duh) because Mom was having her shake upstairs (A shake as in a tofu soy milk-shake with some vitamins and raspberries in it) and Sammy wanted a drink.  So we stuffed him in the basement and put a chair in the way of the door.  We went away and then Sammy stuck his fingers under the door and moved the chair with his fingers and then barged out and forced Mom to have some shake.  After that he went downstairs in the basement and played "Who left the juice in the caboose" on the computer.

      I woke up this morning to Matt screaming frantically. He came into my room with a bloody cloth on his mouth. In my comatose state I attempted to calm him down in - I asked him what happened. "Dan was stepping on my force-field." Ah yes! Of course!  Given that there was blood I thought I'd better do something - wouldn't want to have to take Matt to the hospital with a damaged force-field. How would they treat that? I called Dan and asked him what he did. I quote, "Yes I hurt him. He was hitting my force-field with the rolling pin." Why is it that I feel like I don't know what to do in these circumstances?  In reference to Dan's blog entry this morning. Sam is afraid of elevators because he got trapped in one at the library after escaping from us. Ever since he treats elevators like most kids think of monsters. The kids now use his fear of elevators as kid control - despite my displeasure.

      Hey this is Dan.  Last night I tried to put Sammy to bed but he wouldn't because he wanted the door open and the lights on and he would just stand there.  So I quickly said that a elevator was gonna get you if you don't go to bed.  He went to bed in a bad mood (which we call a temper-tantrum).  I made a huge mistake when I said that because Sammy would not let go of me because He was afraid of the elevator.  I managed to get off of him and I quickly got to the door and closed it. Sammy started crying angrily and once in a while I would hear him making pistol shot sounds.  Obviously he was shooting the elevator.

      Got to spend the day with all the kids today. It was great. We went to York Redoubt where we climbed cannons, jumped off walls, looked at gears and bullets... As we left I let Matt (5) drive the van from my lap. He was keen to start with, but then got a little unerved as we headed towards a cliff overlooking the ocean at 70 km/h (ok, it was only 10km/h - but to a 5 yr old it could be 70). I'm trying to teach the dangers of driving too fast at an early age. As he was driving he waved down an oncoming car. The ederly gentleman rolled down his window and confided in us that he was glad that he was about to be behind us.

      We ate fried grasshoppers the other day. Our friend went to Uganda to teach and he brought some back. They weren't that bad, but they smelled really bad, kind of like people who haven't washed their hair in a while. (This is not meant to offend anyone who hasn't washed their hair in a while, I just meant it smelled kind of like the oils that we get in our hair, yes i get it too). They tasted kind of like pumpkin seeds and they were pretty good once I got up enough nerve to try them.  Yesterday was Christmas Eve. It was a pretty normal day until the end when we watched Finding Nemo and ate 2 bags of chips and drank a whole 2L bottle of pop and also ate 1\2 a package of cookies. Then we brought mattresses down and slept in front of the christmas tree. It was very hard to get to sleep because the christmas tree lights were so bright, and i woke up several times in the night, finally waking up for good around 7:30. Mom had said the night befor that we weren't allowed to wake up 'til 8:00 but I don't think it was a problem because we usually wake up around 5:00 on Christmas day. Then we ate Clementines for breakfast  before we opened our stockings. I got various items of candy, and a pair of gloves and a thing of floss. Then we opened our presents. I got 3 cds: The Monsters Inc. Soundtrack; The monsters inc. favorites (they were part of the same gift); and All that you can't leave behind by U2. I also got a pack of gum from dan and a beautiful glass jar and also a card from sarah.  The rest of the day has been used up preparing the meal for tonight. I have  to go but i might write more later

      Merry Christmas! I Added pictures:  urlLink Follow this link to get them. For future reference you can click on the link at the right side of this page.   Ok - Deep Sea Chicken! As some of you may know, Matt has decided he would open a restaurant called "Deep Sea Chicken". The kids came up from Deep Sea Chicken advertizing HQ with the following badge for Matthew to wear:   Deep Sea Chicken Employee Matthew, Founder, Manager  As word has got out, we have been starting to receive resumes for positions at this fine establishment.  urlLink Click here to read this one from Melanie Wallace.  After Matt read Melanie's resume he decided to hire her. If you are looking for a good job hurry up and get those resumes in!  When Wally (a doctor we know who spent the last 3 months in Uganda) came over to tell us and the kids about his trip, he brought with him some grasshopper which we fried up and ate.  urlLink Click here to see the sign Katelyn made for the Deep Sea Chicken Menu!   Christmas morning was very exciting around here. We captured a few good quotes while the kids were opening presents and goofing around:  While Matt and Sam were fighting with their new (nerf) swords, Dan said, "Hey Matt! Decapitate me! But not too hard."  Also Dan, "It's a good thing the kids didn't watch the Shackleton movie. They showed a decapitation of a guys toes." Can toes be decapitated?  And finally, this one from Sarah, "Dad! Matthew is putting his sword on my whoopie cushion so I can't fart properly!"

      The Christmas craft extravaganza has started at our house. Yesterday we made a "Grinch" gingerbread house. The kids were ticked off at Sammy when he took a bite out of the chimney. I suggested we slap the chimney on the roof anyway - fashioning icing to look like snow to cover the sin. Unfortunately by the time I suggested this Sammy had eaten the entire chimney. To avoid an uncertain fate for Sammy I suggested we return some books to the library, leaving the other kids to finish the gingerbread house in peace. When I returned they had written "POO" in large letters on the roof - I'm afraid POO is way too popular a word around our house! Today we made Christmas trees by melting chocolate chips & then using paintbrushes to paint them on ice cream cones and then decorating. Eating the cones and chocolate before, during and after the decorating was half the fun. Tomorrow the plan is to make "super sandwiches" which is just a sandwich using 3 pieces of bread. Our kids have found this to be sought-after gourmet food ever since their uncle Kevin introduced them to it this summer.

      Sarah came to me as she was heading off to bed tonight. She was concerned that she might contract scurvy. I thought this was because she had been watching "The Endurance" which is the story of Shackelton failed attempt (though miraculous)to be the first to cross the Antarctic continent in 1914. He and his men endured almost two years on an ice field before reaching civilization again. I comforted Sarah and told her she was much more likely to get cancer than scurvy which cheered her up (just kidding, I did the reassuring dad thing and explained that it was impossible for her to get scurvy because we eat a lot of vitamin C in fruit and stuff). She was still concerned because she felt that she had not been eating enough fruit lately - so I had to elaborate on "stuff".  When I watched "The Endurance" myself I was surprised that there was no mention of scurvy at all. This implicates either Katelyn or Dan (I'll bet it was Dan). Guess I'll find out tomorrow who is freaking Sarah out.

      Hello this is Dan, Nobody has blogged recently so I am going to write a blog.  Today was a fun day.  A man named Wally came over for brunch.  We had eggs, upside-down apple pancakes, baked potatos and toast. Also Wally brought a treat from Uganda;Fried Grasshoppers!!!  Do you want to hear it again?  FRIED GRASSHOPPERS!!!!!!!!!!  F-R-I-E-D  G-R-A-S-S-H-O-P-P-E-R-S!!!!.  They tasted like pumpkin seeds and they were quite delicious!!  We also looked at some pictures of Wally when he went to Uganda.  After he left we put up the ginger-bread house and it looked quite good when it is done.  Today we went to a new park.  After we were done playing we went back into the van and started home. Near home Sammy asked Katelyn: "Katenan me go fraw pond, tim tortons, subway?" while batting his eyes like he always does when he wants something.  Now I bet you are wondering what he really said.  This is what he would of said if he could talk better: "Katelyn can we go to the frog pond, Tim Hortons and Subway?" He went home crying because he didn't get his wish  Goodbye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Marsha sent Sarah over to our neighbour's home to ask if she had a seam ripper. Matthew asked if he could go with her and we decided to let him. Before Sarah left she stopped at the door and said, "what was it again that I was supposed to ask for?" We reminded her and as she left I wondered what message our neighbour would actually get. A few minutes later, Matt and Sarah returned without a seam ripper. Apparently what happened was that Sarah let Matt do the talking. He asked Jill if he could borrow her "steam rikker". Jill couldn't figure out what he was saying. We sent Katelyn over and she carried out the task handily!

      Hello this is Dan, Dad changed our bedroom last night so that Me, Sarah, Matthew and Sam are in Mom's old room, and Mom and Dad are in Sarah's old room. My old room is now Dad's office.  Dad got a desk from future shop and a mobile mouse and keyboard for his computer, a phone, and other kinds of office stuff. I am trying really hard to keep our new room clean but I am having no luck. I am still trying though. I have to do a report on Venomous Snakes of Africa and I am going to the library today...  Goodbye!!!!!!!!!

      This is Matt the rat. I was shovelling down a huge snowpile. The kids shovelled a whole bunch of snow off the driveway and then made a big pile of it. I shovelled the pile that the kids made so I can make a wall. I will use the wall so that we can be safe from enemies. I am going to make the wall huge so that the enemy can't see me. If the enemy attacks my wall I am going to run away from him. If he is a robber I'll call the police. You best call the police when someone tries to attack you.

      Here it is, our first december blog. The christmas  season frenzy has started, and we are all hoping for some snow, but halifax hasn't got any so far, only in other towns. I saw a pickup truck today full of snow so maybe that means that we'll get some snow soon. I went to the bead pod today (which is the only bead store in halifax, thus making it very expensive because it has no competition) but i had fun and i am going to make a necklace out of the beads i bought. I have my christmas concert on december the tenth and i am not really looking foward to it, I might make a mistake. We made peanut butter cookies today. we also added chocolate chips and they were really good. then i came down here and here i am. now i have to go do some work

      This is Sammy writing. I love Bob the Builder. I love songs at bedtime. I give each song a name which may in fact have anything to do with the song. This totally confuses mom. For instance, she sings me a song about a frog and I call it "bark". Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night for a drink of water and then I INSIST on mommy singing me my songs again before going back to sleep. She looks sleepy when she does this and sometimes she seems to rush through the songs too quickly. I sit in the bed in the middle of the night and dance and sing along to the songs mom sings me. Its my favourite part of the day. Mom says it is her least favourite part of the day. Tonight for supper Katelyn is making pancakes and I like them. Last night we had spaghetti but I cried when mom put the red stuff on top of the ghetti. I love rice crackers and sometimes Mom leaves them out for me to eat when I wake up so she can sleep a bit longer. This is really special. I eat 5 or 6 of them and then take the rest and crunch them up and spread them all over the kitchen and living room floor. If I have any left over, I like to spread them on top of the computer keyboard too. I'm hoping to teach mom and she needs to think long and hard about whether it is so bad to get up with me at 5:30 or 6 a.m. As I like to say "you snooze, you lose".

      I forgot one thing that happened yesterday that I found extremely funny. Katelyn & Dan came in from returning a video. I could hear Katelyn telling Dan, "If you want to read from a Bible version that is for 4 year olds then KEEP your Bible. But it is so babyish!" (said, as you can assume, with much disdain). Danny replied, "there is NOTHING wrong with my Bible. I understand everything it says".  Danny comes upstairs to my room whimpering quietly ... I asked him what had happened and he said, "I wanted to buy a little wooden box at the dollar store but Katelyn said I wasn't allowed to buy ANYTHING until I buy a new Bible." Never in my wildest imagination did I think my kids would argue over Bible translations. Dan just had his birthday so I took him to Wal-Mart where he bought a U2 album called "Zooropa". He owns the "best of 80-90" already. Now the Zooropa album was widely criticized as being a unwelecom departure in style from U2's other albums. But, quite frankly, after listening to the other album 8 hours a day for last week, I am relieved to listen to ANYTHING else. I dare say headphones were invented by a frustrated yet inspired parent of a musicphile.

      OK blog readers ... the style of this blog is going to be a rant like on This Hour has 22 minutes.  Last year I did all kinds of research into good carpet to replace our crappy carpet on our stairs going to the bedroom level. (Detailed information is available upon request). I compared prices per square metre, etc and we even went last summer to order the carpet. This was only to find out that with labour costs, etc. it was way more money than we could afford. Then some friends suggested putting in wooden stairs and even gave us some money towards it. We have yet to pursue this as term started and, quite frankly, nothing BIG happens until term ends. So after about 4 years I decided to get our ugly carpet cleaned (each year before this I thought we were going to replace the carpet but never did). So I called Phillip, of the Carpet Cat to come over (yes I am shamelessly flaunting his carpet cleaning ability). He made the stairs look like new. We could practically see our reflection in them. Then this morning I looked down and saw Hot Chocolate all over the stairs. I hollered "who spilled hot chocolate all over the stairs?" Sammy replied shamelessly (as he is not old enough to understand about deceit) "I did it" So here is the deal folks: why would I even consider new carpet for years and years? Would new carpet stay clean because it was new? I think not. Would my children respect the carpet because it was new? I think not. Will I ever have anything that stays nice? I think not - that is only for people who have no children. So if you are childless, don't despair. Think of the millions of dollars you are saving on repairs. Think about how you could sweep a kitchen floor at night before bed and come down in the morning for breakfast and still find it clean.  Think about how you could paint a wall and never see spaghetti on it or holes where children rammed into it. And when you are on vacation in some exotic locale because you actually found you have money in the bank even AFTER you maxed out your RRSP contribution and paid off your mortgage, please don't send me a postcard. I might have to kill you. (If you are the RCMP reading this please understand that this is just an expression. I would never really kill anyone.)

      Ok, now I have time for a blog that is not so much pasting. We went skating, It was a lot of fun, until we were skating on a rink in the lake, and there was a peice of orange wood at the end, so day took it down and lay down on it. I asked him what he was doing and he said he was sunbathing. At that point a guy on the shore who had been unlacing his skates yelled at us "HEY, WHAT ARE DOIN' WITH OUR FRIGGIN' BACKBOARD." I yelled back "He's sunbathing", to which the guy yelled back "WELL PUT IT BACK." So we did. Then they left, but not after they had yelled various profanities at us, and even while they were walking away they were yelling nonstop. So then we decided we were going to bury the backboard under a really big tree that had most likely been uprooted during hurricane Juan. So Dan and sarah buried it while I skated around. Dan and sarah came back, and then they were contemplating what to say if they came back. Our possible responses were "CHECK UP YOUR FRIGGIN' NOSE" or "IT WAS IN OUR FRIGGIN' WAY." In the end they didn't come back, and we had a rather good time.   Sorry about all the times I said FRIGGIN'. If you were offended by it then you can tell me in our comments box. Any way I've go to go AGAIN so I'll blog again some other time.

      Today is an er material from the bible day. The story today, is basically about an affair. Between David and Bathsheba that is. Here it is.  David and Bathsheba  The following spring, the time of year when kings go to war, David sent Joab and the Israelite army to destroy the Ammonites. In the process they laid siege to the city of Rabbah. But David stayed behind in Jerusalem. Late one afternoon David got out of bed after taking a nap and went for a stroll on the roof of the palace. As he looked out over the city, he noticed a woman of unusual beauty taking a bath. He sent someone to find out who she was, and he was told, "She is Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite." Then David sent for her; and when she came to the palace, he slept with her. Then she returned home. Later, when Bathsheba discovered that she was pregnant, she sent a message to inform David. So David sent word to Joab: "Send me Uriah the Hittite." When Uriah arrived, David asked him how Joab and the army were getting along and how the war was progressing. Then he told Uriah, "Go on home and relax." David even sent a gift to Uriah after he had left the palace. But Uriah wouldn't go home. He stayed that night at the palace entrance with some of the king's other servants. When David heard what Uriah had done, he summoned him and asked, "What's the matter with you? Why didn't you go home last night after being away for so long?" Uriah replied, "The Ark and the armies of Israel and Judah are living in tents, and Joab and his officers are camping in the open fields. How could I go home to wine and dine and sleep with my wife? I swear that I will never be guilty of acting like that." "Well, stay here tonight," David told him, "and tomorrow you may return to the army." So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next. Then David invited him to dinner and got him drunk. But even then he couldn't get Uriah to go home to his wife. Again he slept at the palace entrance.  So the next morning David wrote a letter to Joab and gave it to Uriah to deliver. The letter instructed Joab, "Station Uriah on the front lines where the battle is fiercest. Then pull back so that he will be killed." So Joab assigned Uriah to a spot close to the city wall where he knew the enemy's strongest men were fighting. And Uriah was killed along with several other Israelite soldiers. Then Joab sent a battle report to David. He told his messenger, "Report all the news of the battle to the king. But he might get angry and ask, `Why did the troops go so close to the city? Didn't they know there would be shooting from the walls? Wasn't Gideon's son Abimelech killed at Thebez by a woman who threw a millstone down on him?' Then tell him, `Uriah the Hittite was killed, too.' " So the messenger went to Jerusalem and gave a complete report to David. "The enemy came out against us," he said. "And as we chased them back to the city gates, the archers on the wall shot arrows at us. Some of our men were killed, including Uriah the Hittite." "Well, tell Joab not to be discouraged," David said. "The sword kills one as well as another! Fight harder next time, and conquer the city!" When Bathsheba heard that her husband was dead, she mourned for him. When the period of mourning was over, David sent for her and brought her to the palace, and she became one of his wives. Then she gave birth to a son. But the LORD was very displeased with what David had done.  That one was pretty long. In case you're wondering it is in 2 Samuel 11. I have a really gross story for tomorrow.   Today we're going skating. I've only ever been skating twice before. I'm really looking foward to it. We are also going to a hockey game tomorrow night. I'm looking foward to that too. I've only been skating twice before. I have to go now because we have to leave. I'll write about it later.

      I am disappointed.  I only know 2 people who read our blog.  It is not boring!  Okay so I go up in handcuffs to the math torture chamber and the room is a mess!  So I bring my stereo down to listen to while doing my math and I find out that my flashlight is missing. And so I pull the whole bunkbed out a little bit so I can look down under the bed and find it.  But I didn't find it!  And it still remains a mystery.  So I am a little frusterated and grouchy because I didn't find it.  I am starting a collection of gum.  I have 8 spearmint packs and 6 pieces of extra gum.  All packed in 1 wooden box.  The library is closed so 99% of the day I am inside.  I am going to a hockey game tomorrow and I really can't wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      This morning on the way out of the house Sam came up to me and asked for a hug and kiss goodbye. I stopped and he climbed into my arms and gave me an extra long hug and kiss. He was very warm. It felt really good. When I put him down he walked over to Marsh who was standing nearby and grabbed her hand. He then led her to me so that she could get a kiss and hug too. When I came home Sam was at the door to welcome me. In fact he had the door open and when I came to the top of the stairs he came outside and grabbed my hand and led me in the house. He was very excited to see me. Sam was the high of my day.

      Hope you blog readers are doing OK. There has been a dearth of entries from Melanie of Platinum Blonde fame which makes me think she is probably skiing or enjoying Vancouver's spring weather (I know what all you Vancouverites are thinking, "don't hate me because we have beautiful weather") We have two sick little boys and one sick man. Now I wouldn't normally mention this as sickness happens - but this sickness has been going on for almost 4 weeks. Here is the pattern - kids feel tired and grouchy during the day with pathetic runny noses. At night their snores could wake up Manhattan. And then the coughing fits start. It is difficult not to be able to make them feel better. Sometimes I turn on the shower to fill the bathroom with steam but maybe this only makes me feel better. Now Sammy has conjunctivitis (pink eye) which you are supposed to put warm compresses on for 10 minutes 3 times per day. Like that is going to fly with a 3 year old.   Despite this life goes on. Ron has worked tirelessly at our basement reno. It is really started to come together. We are looking forward to having our weekends and evenings back and having the computer return to the basement along with our kids. The living room has become the centre of all activities which means U2 music playing at full blast, computer games with their repetitive elevator music, etc. And they don't seem to understand they are only allowed to eat in the kitchen - the computer has become an extension of the kitchen with daily piles of dirt around the computer desk. They even found some extra bits of wood from the basement and were found sanding it over top of the keyboard. Um ... Ron better not find out about this. I stopped them before they could open the computer box and sand over top of the hard drive.   Yesterday something very humbling happened to me ... Dan asked me for help with his math and I had NO IDEA how to do the question. I looked in the answer book but it only gave the answer not the solution. This is grade 4, people! I had already had to use algebra from my own grade 12 math on a previous question (once I knew the answer). I then explained the answer to Danny who asked in a dazed and confused way "what is x? An algebraic symbol, I explained" Is this really algebra? I'm not even sure. I am very glad at this point to be married to a math whiz. I do quite enjoy homeschooling. It can be very funny at times - our Bible study is always funny - the kids take such delight in all the naughty bits that God has so humourously sprinkled throughout the Bible. In Sarah's phonics lesson there was the funniest sentence (using only 3 letter words of course with simple long or short vowels) The sentence was: "Pop told Sal get a job". This was accompanied by a picture of a lazy looking Sal with Pop with a pipe in his mouth and a newspaper stuck in her face with the word "JOBS" in big letters. Maybe you had to be there but Dan ,Katelyn & I laughed about this for hours - in fact it has become our Mantra - whenever we say it we break into gales of laughter. Last night I was tucking Matt into bed and he asked me to come back. I asked, "what happens if I don't come back?" He said, "you might go to hell". Well, I thought, if not coming back could mean eternal damnation I will definately come back. Alas he was asleep when I returned 3 hours later. Well things seem to be falling apart downstairs - I just heard Sam say the word "popcorn" I have visions of kernals stuck between the keys of the keyboard so must sign off. Cheers blog audience. Marsha

      I woke up at 7 o'clock this morning, enough time to disable my alarm, and promptly fall back asleep. All that and I'm still tired. People have exclaimed over the fact that I could at one point (when I was 9 or so) that I could sleep for six hours, and not be tired. Now people exclaim over the fact that I can sleep for 10 hours and still be tired. I don't get it. I can sleep in 'til ten am with no trouble at all, and go to bed at 9:00 and not get to sleep until 12. I have already yn awned twice while I've been writing this. No wait, make that three times.   Something we (we being Me, Dan and Mom) were discussing last night was that even though the bible is read kind of high and mightyish we noticed several very bad gross disgusiting gory bits of the bible. I have made it my mission to find every one of them and post them on the blog. I will aim to post one twice a week. Also I have noticed that the bible contains very much content that would be appropriate to use for shows such as er. Like when Lots daughters had mm-mm with him to continue on the family line. There is also the story... well I'm not going to tell you that story yet, but I will tell you later in the week because I've decided to make sure everybody knows all about er material in the bible. I will be posting stuff like that about 3 times a week.  Today I'm starting the guts and gore section of my blog so my first verse is going to be Judges 1:6-7 King Adoni-bezek escaped, but the Israelites soon captured him and cut off his thumbs and big toes. Adoni-bezek said, "I once had seventy kings with thumbs and bit toes cut off, eating scraps from under my table. Now God has payed me back for what I did to them." They took him to Jerusalem and he died there.  You people out there who read this can probably think of other gross things, all of which will be featured in my blog at some time. I already have some in mind. Anyway I am a bit sick from writing about mass finger and big toe amputation so I'd better go.

      Here are some Abarbanel expressions.:  Corncob:  Nibbling somebody's arm like munching on a corn on the cob. (Corncobs are done to Matt and Sammy while they scream NO don't Corncob me!!!!!)  Cheeky-butt:  Pinching somebody's cheek hard until they can't take it anymore and whack the pincher.  Bagel-Butt:  A plump tooshy really good for pinching (Often seen on small boys after baths)  Zerbit:  Putting your mouth on somebody's tummy and blowing to make a farting sound AKA raspberry  Well I hope you liked them (Don't try these actions at home)

      Ahoy to all you Deep Sea Chickens out there!! You will notice that we have added a GUESTBOOK to our ABARBABLOG for your comments and feedback. I noticed that one of our fans already left a message. To help get things started and to spur you on to leave comments, the person who posts the 15th comment will win a PRIZE. Before I tell you the prize, you must first PAY ATTENTION to the rules.  Rule #1. While the prize is given to the 15th person who signs the guestbook, the 14 entries before must be from 14 DIFFERENT people. Multiple entries by the same person will not count Melanie. So if A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N are the first 14 unique people to sign and C enters the 15th then C wins!!  Rule #2. Abarbablog members comments do not count as entries nor can they win the prize.  Rule #3. You must be 18 years or older to claim your prize.  Rule #4. You must answer the following skill testing question (none of this baby mathematics crap you get in most contest):  At Dan's instigation, 40 deep sea chickens got loose and started attacking Matthew's force field. Matthew fought them off bravely. He decided to retaliate against the dasterdly Dan. Running at Dan at 12 Km/h while overstepping the remains of the now dead deep sea chickens Matthew lunged at Dan with his weapon in hand. Dan ran in the other direction at 8 Km/h zig zagging back and forth. Finally, realizing that he was caught, Dan turned and faced Matt but turned on his force field so that he would not get hurt too badly. A battle of intergallactic proportions ensued. Here is the skill testing question: During what part of the day did this occur, what was Matt's weapon and what injury did Matthew sustain while battling the evil Dan?  Hint: You will need to read our blog.  Rule #5. If you receive any help on the skill testing question from Abarbablog members you will be disqualified Melanie.  Ok ... now for the prize. The next time you or a person of your choosing is in Halifax (ie. the prize is transferable) you get to spend a day with the 5 pirates. You will also be taken out to a fine meal (not deep sea chicken) in the evening with Ron and Marsha - but not the pirates. You can stay over if you like, but it is at your own peril.

      Yesterday after I had gone to shoppers drug mart to spend $25 on new batteries for my camera, I came home to find that dad had gone to blessings (christian store), and they had a sale on bible. I really needed a new bible so mom offered to take me there. I had been visualizing scores and scores of dirt cheap bibles, but what greeted me there was that fact that even the teenyest weenyest bibles were at least $20. Also they had lots and lots of burgundy bibles, which is DEFINETELY NOT my favorite colour in terms of bibles. Anyway, I finally found a bible that I liked. Its bigger than my old one (I really like reasonably big bibles) and navy blue and vegetarian frendly (I don't really care, but they had a small on that had real leather, but I liked the one I picked better.) Normally it would have been $80, but it was fifty percent off, and mom agreed to pay $10 so I only had to pay $30. STILL THEY TALK ABOUT MAKING GODS WORD AVAILABLE TO EVERYBODY, BUT THERE IS NO WAY I WOULD HAVE PAYED $80 FOR A BIBLE!!!!!  Meanwhile people are making a big fuss about people in places other than north america, (with good reason, don't get me wrong) but most people in halifax couldn't afford to spend 80 dollars on a bible. 80 dollars could feed someone for at least a week! it could also pay for hygenic neccesitys, or could help you pay your water bill. There are so many things you could do with 80 dollars besides buying a bible. Now if bibles were $10 then people might be like, "Oh I want to see the stuff all those silly christian people are raving about. " and then realize that they would only have to pay ten bucks. Maybe if blessings wasn't the only christian store in town there would be some competition. Anyway  On a more humorous note, in my new bible at the front it says This bible was presented to _______________ and then it says By__________ and then, On the occasion of___________________, and then, Date_______________. I am going to write that i presented it to myself with a little help from my gracious mother, and then I'm going to write that it was on the occasion of a  sale at blessings. Then I'm going to put the date.

      Okay 1 good blog coming up.  I was doing some shopping with Katelyn and she pointed out that I was nutty. If you saw me you would probably say the same thing. I said thank you.  I am nutty, remember!  So we went to the video store and I was not concentrating on what video to rent; I was watching the TV's hanging from the ceiling! Next we went to the Grocery store.  We couldn't fine what we were looking for, so we got the manager.  I kept saying to Katelyn under my breath: I want his Autograph, I want his Autograph!!  Next we went to a Drug store.  There was a Woman if front of us in line and we saw 15 cans of cat food on the counter.  She said she had 6 cats. I was amazed!  I was amazed that she could go around with that mustache!!  Now normally women do not have mustaches but some do have visible ones.  After leaving the Drug Store I burst out in laughter!  Ha Ha.

      For reference on Mom blog, kids are always smarter than adults. For instance: Dad didn't even know how many times Israel marched around Jericho in a week. (13 times for those who are as smart as dad).  WE ARE DEFINITELY MORE TECHNICALLY GIFTED THAN MOM!!!!!  Okay something real to talk about.  My hair is growing now and I am excited.  Very excited. Extremely excited. Okay it is a small blog and it does not say much but I really have to go!!!

      Today around lunch I caught the kids putting together the basic outline of a menu for deep-sea chicken. I was a severe critic, so they moved on to design a website (its not actually on the internet, just and internet file). In halifax, and i don't know about other cities, but at least in halifax you can pay to have your menus put into the phonebook. This function is usually used by pizza/donairs places and the such, because when people call to order a pizza, they want to know what the place they're calling has to offer. So anyway I wondered aloud, "I wonder how much you have to pay to have your menu in the phone book"  Then I thought, maybe we should put a message at the bottom of the menu saying, "Sorry, we don't deliver."   After that the kids finished designing the website. In the end it had 2 links. There was this question at the top. Are you rich or poor? Be Honest. Then it had 2 links, one for rich people to press, and one for poor people to press. If you pressed on rich it came up and said. "Congradulations! You get your own room, but you have to pay." If you pressed on poor it said "Congradulations! You get to eat for free!  Anyway i have to go, I have to wash the dishes. (Anybody who reads this, please notifiy the childrens rights people immidiately. I'm afraid my parents are violating the law!! HELP!!!!!)

      This is actually Marsha writing this blog. The reason I don't blog more often is because I can never remember how to get into the blogger system - so I have to ask my children - people that I am SUPPOSED to be smarter than. But alas, they are much more technically gifted than I am.  Yesterday I had all the kids in the van when Dan slammed the door on his thumb. He was writhing in pain in the way that we all do when we slam the door on our appendages ... your body is thinking should I throw up or faint, I can't decide. After a few minutes Matthew says compassionately, "don't worry about your thumb, Dan. You will grow a new one". We went tobogganing yesterday in Herring Cove (pituresque little community with expensive houses overlooking the ocean). Sammy was Kamakaze toboggan baby. He had no fear of going down this quite steep and fast hill. And he was so good natured about walking back up the hill to slide again. Sometimes his toboggan would fall half-way down the ascent and he would patiently go back and get it and start over again. One time after many retrievals of his toboggan he decided just to slide down half the hill - I suppose he needed a little adrenalin rush before facing the big hill again. Dan asked the kids if they wanted to name their toboggans ... Matt named his the speedy because it was very speedy. At dinner time when we did High-Low the High for all the kids was tobogganing. It is nice when a simple activity that takes no preparation and has the incredible side benefit of providing lots of exercise and fresh air is the high of their day. We would go again today but it is -35 with wind chill!! Yikes. Ron, Matt and Sam are all sick with a cold that has lasted 3 weeks. It seems to have different stages but the present stage is that the boys feel moderately OK during the day but get very sick after they go to sleep. Matt finds great comfort in sneaking across the hall to sleep on the floor of our room and then sneaking into MY side of the bed some time in the middle of the night. A few years ago Ron & I actually switched sides of the bed so the kids would wake up Ron. It worked only for about 1 minute. But they are kind of cute when they are sick so I won't complain about lack of sleep too much. It is nice to have Ron home to share in the night watch, though he feels sick all day and at night.

      I want to rectify a mistake I made in an earlier blog. The blog about band was all good except for the part that talked about Mr. ?-Guess. I'm afraid i didn't get his name right. I have renamed him Mr. G-String. This is because of something he did a couple bands ago. He was fooling around with his bass, and then proceeded to yell "Mr. Curtis-Williams, my g-string broke!"  In other news, today, after being repeatedly told FOR PETE'S SAKE, PLEASE REMEMBER TO FLUSH THE TOILET, I found in Sarah and my bathroom that she forgot again. I immediately proceeded to make a sign that said "Remember to Flush!" and hung it on the bathroom wall in front of the toilet. I don't think she's seen it yet.

      I just got home from being away for the week. Though not in the best shape (feeling pretty sick) it is fantastic to be home again. Marsha went grocery shopping and returned. I suspect that Sam is helping her put away the groceries because he just came to me with a huge pack of marshmellows in his arms. His mouth was watering like a rabid dog and I noticed  through the plastic one marshmellow had been mauled and lay mangled amidst his more healthy peers. I couldn't figure out what Sam was saying because his drool interfered with his attempts at proper speech. He is very cute.

      Today is Saturday. Saturday is swimming lesson day. Saturday is also the day where I sleep in. Ahhh. Anyway my swimming lesson is at 12:00, and so I got ready and stuff and went to the lesson. I'm the only girl taking Level 11, WHICH SUCKS!! I'm so glad that the swimming teacher is a girl. (and also my favorite teacher, this is the third time i've had her.) so anyway i did 21 laps across the pool (more than half a kilometer, i never dreamed of doing that many.) Then i treaded water for 5 minutes, and then we played marco polo. I used to think that five laps was hard. Anyway i had a pretty boring day so i'm not going to write anymore, but before i stop i'm going to add that we went tobogganing and so now my tailbone and rear end really hurt because of going off of jumps.

      DON'T YOU DARE LAUGH AT THIS BLOG MELANIE!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm dead serious about that. Today i went to grade 7 band. This is not my favorite part of the week. At all. Guess why. Well anyway i'll tell you. I have to set my alarm for 6:00 out of my reach, so that i can't press the snooze button so that i'm somewhat awake by the time Sarah wakes up, around 7:30. While i'm doing that i listen to the radio. I'm not comprehending the radio because i'm too tired, but the radio's kind of a comfort thing. The only thing i did comprehend was the fact that school was NOT CLOSED, and thus i still had to go. So then i got up and put some clothes on and brushed my teeth. Up to this point, despite the fact that i am practically in REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, my day has not been tooo bad. So then I go upstairs to do my chores. I clean out the dishwasher, and then i put some toast in, and then i go upstairs to get laundry to put into the machine. There isn't enough. So I butter my toast. Then i eat it. Anyway i'm boring you. I'll skip to the part when i'm walking to school. So i'm walking to school and its so early in the morning that almost NOBODY has shoveled their sidewalk yet. At this point maybe i should tell you that I'm wearing running shoes. Now usually running shoes are not a problem. The snow isn't usually deep enough not to wear running shoes. As far as the snow went i was ok. But I really wished for some nice hiking boots right then because the tread on my shoes, battling black ice and not so black ice and slush, is lets say, like a dandilion battling a hurricane. So I get to school. I'm not too much worse for wear, so far, although my day has taken a nosedive, it's still a pretty average ordinary day. So then I get to school. Its CHAOTIC. You see, there are four boys (Mr. Trumpet, who used to be my neighbour and Mr. Rat, he looks like a rat, Mr. Goofy Sax, who i don't know how he got through 6th grade band, and Mr. ? Guess, who always wears a t-shirt that says the same thing on it.) You can probably see that i'm witholding names here, so as not to offend people with the same names who read this blog. (This is only for guys.) Any way these boys, Mr. Trumpet, Mr. Rat, Mr. Goofy-Sax, and Mr. ?-Guess are (well I know god is the judge, but if i were the judge, you can probably guess where i'd be sendin'em!):-) Probably god's a better judge than me. Anyway we had a test, we had to play a very very simple piece of music. So I was first. I did it pretty good. Then the other girls did it. They did it too. Then the boys who are not misters (yet) played it kindof. So then its Mr. Trumpets turn. He takes a full 5 minutes, and he can't play it. Then it's Mr. Goofy-Sax's turn. He can play it better, but it still takes him at least 3 minutes. Then its Mr. ?-Guess's turn. He plays the bass, so its really easy for him to do it. Meanwhile Mr. Rat has been all the time talking and playing hot cross buns (the only song he can play) trying to put everyone off. Then I walk home. Its uphill all the way. By the time i get home i'm so tired. Tired of walking, tired of talking, tired of listening, tired of playing, tired of hearing a bass, and especially tired of band. Mom suggested that I quit grade 7 band, but I don't think i'm going to. Maybe next week they'll all be sick. (I hope so, its the closest i can get to being the judge.)

      I've slept in for the past 3 days and I'm STILL TIRED. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! Oh well. I got moms old camera, she warned me that batteries were 17 dollars, but i decided that for a half decent camera with zoom and flash it was probably worth it. Anyway Dad always uses the digital camera. So i'm kinda happy about it. Of course i had to endure some competition (from Matthew), who was heart broken when he didn't get it, and has officially kicked me out of the Deep Sea Chicken fan club. I'm sure it'll all blow over soon. At least i hope it'll all blow over soon, because not being in the deep sea chicken fan club is pretty serious. But already he is happily playing with Dan and Sammy.

      Okay so a pleasant January 22 blog.  Mom just gave me a pair of her old headphones so that my stereo is now silent.  Last night me and Sammy made up a game that we would both have to stand on all fours ready to pounce on something, and growl like a tiger.  Than we would jump on each other and see who could be the first tiger to pin down the other tiger (Sammy won 2 rounds).  Anyway school is going really well now that I am having enough sleep.  I slept in Moms room on the floor.  Sammy is obsessed with sitting next to mom when she is reading books.  He wants to sit beside mom so much he will not even let anybody sit next to him.  Anyway time for me to leave:)!!

For the past couple days I have been waken by Sammy and forced to do stuff like: Fix the computer at 6:00 in the morning and playing with Sammy in 5:30 in the morning.  You get the picture.  Dad is in Ontario right now so now the mice can play.  But I sometimes I wish I were with him. We just rented the movie Holes and it is a very good movie but in some way different than the book.  Well that is all the time I have for today so Goodbye!!!!!!

      This is Marsha and it has been too long since my last blog. Matthew has been his ever-present cerebral self and has requested Magic School Bus science books for his bedtime reading. I told him that Daddy & I thought he was very smart. He said, "well I'm not that smart because I don't know how a chain saw works". (He meant by this the inner mechanics of a chain saw, not just how to fire it up.) He continues to be obsessed by his restaurant "Deep Sea Chicken". He was overjoyed with birthday money from Grandma Noga and he pledged to put is towards building Deep Sea Chicken. Tonight at the grocery store he saw a woman canvassing for a children's charity - she had a large glass jar filled with donations. He explained to her about the vision for his restaurant, gave her some sample menu items, and outlined the design of the restaurant which includes a play place for children. And then he made his pitch, "could I have the money in your jar for my restaurant?" I took the kids to the library today. It was only about -4 C so I decided against snow pants. Sammy climbed every snow bank, fell flat on his face, laid down in the snow, walked over peoples' lawns instead of using the sidewalk, climbed to the top of hills and slid down, etc. And this all in track pants. To him this was not a walk to the library, it was an adventure. He delights me with his enthusiasm for life. He said "Oh wow" when he saw a new fence surrounding an abandoned gas station and was thrilled to watch the wind carry a small plastic bag through the skies.  The other night Matt was ill in the night and when I got Matt settled back into his bed with a hot water bottle Sammy woke up. He insisted on a drink and a re-take of his bedtime songs. It was quite surreal to be singing "Bob the Builder" in the middle of the night. I tried to sing it as quickly and briefly as I could but alas he was adamant to have the second verse. Sarah suddenly sat up in bed and joined my faltering voice. Sammy thoroughly enjoyed this and sang along and danced to the music. I ask you, my dear readers, when was the last time you sang "Bob the Builder" at 2:30 in the morning? I seemed to be the only person whose daytime performance was altered negatively by this middle of night soiree. Well I must go and get some sleep as tomorrow is birthday celebration day ... for Dan. I am making pizza (and was delighted to find goat mozarella at Sobey's tonight, my dear lactose intolerant readers). I'm also making a black forest cake. Cheers readers! Marsha

      This is Sarah writing. Today Danny and Daddy went to a retreat so it was really boring at supper because they weren't there. Mom rented a movie for us to watch - Bob the Builder in a Christmas to remember. It has Elton John's voice in it. Katelyn keeps asking for the mirror in the living room with doves on it when Mom dies. I don't know what I want from mom and dad's house when they die. Dad finished making my room today in the basement. It is painted yellow and I am excited about moving in. We have been eating macaroons for a bedtime snack. There is only one left. Yesterday I went to Lyneigha's house (my friend). We went sledding for almost the whole time and then went in for supper. Mom made pizza for supper at our house so we ate that for dessert. I also went with mommy to the mall to buy a birthday present for his birthday which is on Monday. Then we went to pick up Rod and Tell to come over to hang out with mom and dad. They are students. Well I have to go because I am trying to talk mommy into letting me take a bath. Bye. Love Sarah

      Hello Last night I was running up to bed.  My watch said 9:00.  I fell asleep and when my eyelids rose I looked at my watch. It wasn't there! I searched my whole room and it was gone.  The blinds were open as well and that was weird to because the blinds were down when I fell asleep.  A robbery? I don't know but it was weird! Anyway I have to get off now!!!

      Dad finished my room today, so I get to move in tomorrow. I helped pick the colour, its blue, and I'm really happy with it. It will be nice to have my own room again, because a week of sleeping on the floor in the kids bedroom hasn't really been too fun, especially because the kids step all over my bed with their grimy feet, and make it really uncomfortable. There was also an incident concerning one of the kids emptying a pencil sharpener on my bed.   In five days it'll be Dan's birthday. 2 birthdays in a week, because Matty's was on the 12th.   Mom is making pizza for lunch, and I can't wait because its been a really long time since I've had pizza that I can eat. Yay!  I have to get off now 'cause mom wants to blog.

      Today I am sitting around not being able to do anything and finally a was reminded to do a blog.  Anyway I was in the math torture chamber and I spent 45 minutes doing math.  After I was finished mom told me to write a blog. Mom is making a homemade pizza.  I have not had a homemade pizza since I was 5 years old. Memory's. The weather outside is freeeeeeeeezing!!!!!!!!!!! I am going to have to go out there in the afternoon.  4 days ago we celebrated Matthew's b-day and every toy that we got him is broken now. He doesn't care.  And a good thing to! Our friend Melanie gave him a Deep-Sea-Chicken shirt with the logo. My b-day is in 4 days, but the celebration os in 3 days since my dad is leaving for a retreat on my b-day.  Anyway Goodbye!!!!!!!!!

      Today is a bit better than yesterday, in the absence of more poo smeared all over the floors, but the room is absolutely filthy. This is very irritating when you walk into the room and you can't see the floor. Its also irritating that a good deal of the mess resides on MY bed, which is currently residing on the floor in the kids room. (The mess is not my mess.) Its really cold today, -34 celcius and i had to walk 20 minutes to school where i go for band.   Otherwise boring day, except when Melanie accused me of sending harrassing e-mails because she didn't write in her blog. Only then she said she was only joking.

      I had to go to the doctors office today. It is because I limp when I run. I'm so sick of all this fuss being made over my leg, and it feels fine, and has felt fine since about a year after I was discharged from the hospital, because of my osteomalitis. (In case you were wondering osteomalitis is kind of like an internal infection, like if you get a splinter and it gets infected. The only catch is that its in your bone, and there isn't necessarily something stuck in there, just pus and germs that in my case had to be surgically dealt with). He measured my legs and then told me that my legs were the same, and that my shins and feet had definitely stopped growing.   It's Mattys birthday today, but we celebrated it yesterday, we had a coral snake cake, and curried chicken. He got a lot of police stuff, as well as a shirt that had the Deep Sea Chicken logo on it. His present from me was to go with the police theme, because I gave him a buck twentyfive to buy a doughnut from Tim Hortons. He's six years old now. It's kind of funny to think that exsactly six years ago i was in the hospital watching him come out.   its time for lunch so i'd better get going, but before i do i'm going to tell you that our friend melanie set up a blog. She hasn't done too many blogs yet but if you want to read it the address is www.platinumblonde.blogspot.com

      Dan has a new obsession. Remember when he said in his most recent blog that he didn't take baths anymore, he takes showers. That is the obsession. At least two times a day he approaches mummy, regardless of whether he has already had a shower that day or not and asks if he can have one. I think mom finds it kind of irritating. Anyhow she mostly says no, and has been limiting his showers to once every second day or so. this is very irritating for me because we have had problems consisting of me not showering for 4 or more days, and in the morning waking up early to take a shower and find that all the hot waters gone because or mom and dad. And now dan too. We have to have a family meeting about this issue. Dan does in no way need to shower every second day. He only needs to about twice a week.   Also i have noticed with the site statistics thing that we only get 1.5 visitors a day. I ask you blog readers to check it more often, or tell more people about it, or anything that will make our visits go up. 1.5 is not very much.

      This is Matthew writing. I chewed on some gum that didn't have any sugar. It took away my cavities and bacteria. That gum was a good gum because it wasn't a candy gum. I'm opening a restaurant called Deep Sea Chicken. Since there are drywallers in the basement I asked Lawrence, the head drywaller, if they could drywall Deep Sea Chicken. He said I would need a location, a lawyer, $250000 for a really good restaurant. I was wondering if you blog readers could get money and bring it over to me. I only need $250000. The drywaller suggested I ask the bank for the money. I asked one of the other drywallers to cook but he said he didn't know how to cook, he just knew to clean. I hired him as a handyman. I hired our friend Melanie. But I told her she would have to move to Halifax to work at Deep Sea Chicken. She said since she lives in Vancouver maybe she could fly here everyday to work. Or I thought I could open a Deep Sea Chicken in my country, and she could open one in her country called Vancouver. I like her because she doesn't hurt me. I have been thinking about the menu. I think everyone is going to have to take the curried chicken because it is yummy. It is going to be my birthday soon on January 12th. I want to eat curried chicken and a birthday cake. I want to get a toy that is like a meachinal hand on a long stick, a toy chain saw, and a slinky. Well I have to go now because I have to do an errand for my dad. Bye

      This is Sarah writing. Today we had oatmeal for breakfast. Yesterday it was very cold. We walked to the video store and mailed some letters with our friend Melanie. It was too cold for Sammy and Matthew so they had to go back in the house just after they got all dressed up warmly to go outside. Matthew was crying and crying because he didn't get to go with us. But he would have been freezing on the walk and would have cried even more wildly because of the cold. For the last few days it has been really boring because of the basement. We can't go down there because the drywallers are working. The basement is getting worked on for my new room. I am very excited that I am going to have my own room because the boys always steal my stuff. I am going to share a bathroom with Katelyn. Dad is also going to clean out his tools from underneath the stairs so I will have a little private place to read and have my desk. Katelyn gave me a bracelet that has the 10 commandments on it and a cross. We have a rule that whoever poos on the toilet gets a piece of licorish. Sammy pooed on the toilet for the first time. He told Daddy that he would do it if Daddy gave him licorish. So Daddy gave him a piece of licorish, then Sammy sat down on the toilet and made a poo. Daddy yelled at us to all come up to the bathroom. We all looked in the toilet and then clapped our hands, cheered, sang and danced a poo song. Then we gave him kisses. Sammy laughed and was really full of joy. While we are writing this blog he is crying and whining because he can't come in to the office. Sammy is afraid of elevators. Whenever we tell him an elevator is coming he runs and cuddles his face in my arms. He is really cute. The reason he is afraid of elevators is because he went in an elevator at the library and got stuck. THE END

      Okay I am sitting here with Sammy, who is smashing a broom on the ground and I am writing a blog.  The computer is a disaster because Sammy is thinking that it is his computer and will not let anybody use it.  I am getting whacked by Sammy while writing this blog.  I do not have baths anymore, I have showers. They are more fun. I do not have much to say but Goodbye!!!!!!!!

      Today quite a few changes have been made. First I had to move only the stuff I need to survive the next month or so upstairs to a tiny cubicle (it used to be a very very large walk in closet) that we call moms office. This would consist of clothes, hygienic necessities, and school books. It is not very neat and it is very frustrating when mom is in here and I have to take down a big box and rummage through it for 5 minutes looking for my pencil sharpener. I can tell mom isn't too happy about it. Its more frustrating for her because she's used to this being her private domain. Second of all, I've started school again. That actually started yesterday but it is a big change so I had to put it in here. This is a problem because all my books are in moms office, and all my supplies, and as I said before, they are not in very neat order. Thirdly we got a new dishwasher. It looks very new and white and stuff. Actually it looks kind of like our old dishwasher only its all white and our old one had a black top. This is also a big change because we've had the black and white dishwasher for pretty well as long as I can remember washing dishes (about 10 years). Now our kitchen is all cluttered up because dad took the old dishwasher out of the space where you put a dishwasher and he hasn't put the new one in yet. As you can probably imagine it isn't exactly a piece of cake moving around our kitchen.   Mom and all the other kids are at the library right now, getting books and playing on the computers that you can book.

      Today quite obviously is Sunday. On Sunday usually we go to church. This Sunday was no different. This is my usual Sunday routine. I wake up to the sound of some movie or other, usually spongebob squarepants, then I try unsuccessfully to get back to sleep before realizing that it is Sunday and shooting out of bed only to discover that I have seriously overslept and now it is 9:50 and church starts at 10:30 and we have to leave at 10:20. Then I very fast brush my teeth and get some clothes on and run upstairs to grab a bite to eat only to find that I don't have time for that and I have to rush to the van with nothing to eat. Then Mom and Dad also in a hurry, climb into the van. Today mum brought me some breakfast. Then we drive to church. Around the holidays, with our tendency just to get there in the nick of time it gets very, very, hard to find seats in the church. So me and my brother stand at the back of the church for a minute while looking over the crowd for empty seats. When we finally sit down the announcements are just ending and the singing starts. So then we sing. After that comes the children's story, and then we all go down to Sunday school, or rather I take my brother down to Sunday school and then I mysteriously disappear until communion, or sometimes listen to the sermon, or sometimes take care of my 3-year old brother in his Sunday School. Then after church I go to the basement and while the kids feast on cookies, (which will later mean that they won't want any food until supper) I walk around, sometimes talking to people but mostly just wandering around and not eating any cookies because I am allergic to cow's dairy and so it wouldn't be such a good thing for me to do. Then we walk to the van and "enjoy" a bumpy ride, not made better with the fact that I usually have a headache after church. Then when we get home we, or rather I eat lunch while the kids go and finish the movie they were watching in the morning, their contented tummies filled up with cookies. The rest of the afternoon is usually spent in a headache. Of course the rest of the afternoon isn't actually spent yet, but not for lack of trying, because I do actually have a headache.  Tomorrow is the first day back at school. I won't say that I can't wait because I definitely could, but sadly this isn't the case and I do have to start again tomorrow and there isn't anything I can do about it.   Today we have a woman named Melanie Wallace over at our house (see her resume 2 or 3 blogs down. We haven't seen her in about a year so its really nice to have her over. She used to live here but now she lives in Vancouver.   Today Matthew has been taking our portable radio and pointing it everywhere trying to figure out  which direction that china is in by finding a Chinese radio station. So far he hasn't figured out where china is but he has found the direction of "Hawaii" as well as the direction of the vinyl cafe.

      Okay, there was not a blog since Christmas and I want to start blogging.  My birthday is coming up and I want a stereo and a U2 Cd.  We rented a DVD and the kids are watching it over and over again.  I am trying to have the most fun because school starts tomorrow.  A guest named Melanie came over for lunch and we are locked up in the basement (As usual).  I am ready for school and I have got everything set up for school. I got a watch for Christmas, a Tape, a bag of marbles (Which lasted a day)and a mug.  Goodbye!!!!!!!

      Today was a HILARIOUS day!  The morning was a pretty normal, but when we went to the library mom stopped at the door and read a new sign they had put up there. I will do my best to duplicate it for you. The misspelling was actually there.   pool closed due to fecal incident sorry for the inconvince,   Thanks, wave pool management   I could only assume fecal meant poo, but on the other door there was another sign, which I can duplicate for you, as I have 2 of the original copies   pool closed due to fetal inciddent sorry for the inconvince  Tanks wave pool management   There was one of these signs on the door going into the actual library, and not the outside doors with that message on it and I took it upstairs to randy. (she's our friend, and she's a librarian) She was shocked. And she got a kick out of it. She even photocopied it for me and for herself. Then she went down to the pool to inquire about the signs. I had already asked the pool people if somebody had pooped, or if someone had, had a baby, but the signs were VERY misleading. (somebody had pooped). It was very funny, and I got to take home the fetal signs, but the pool people ripped up the fecal signs before I could get one.  now me and mom especially, every chance we get are saying "oh, tanks so much for doing that, I hope it wasn't an inconvince to you." and stuff like that. The thing I thought though, was that all the spelling mistakes were tolerable, except fecal fetal. I'm not even sure fecal is a word!  Good night =)

      I am so happy!!!  Reason number 1:  Me and Sarah just got a instant camera for 17 dollars.  Reason number 2:  It is my weekly shower day!  Reason number 3: My math is almost finished!!  Reason number 4: Today is the last day of school before the weekend!  Now that is something to be happy about.  Anyway I am feeling really good. Sammy is being really messy right now.  We have to clean up after him and it is not really pleasent.  I am making a small head out of modeling clay and it is going really well.  I am now working on the hair. It is really fun designing things from scratch.  My Antarctica work is going really good.  I am learning about the natural resourses of Antarctica.  Vostok,  Antarctica is the coldest place on earth.  Shakleton was one of the first people tho reach Antarctica.  I feel like building a really big snow fort there. The natural resourses are Zinc and oxide.  It is dangerous to mine there because the pressure of the snow can cave in the tunnels that the miners dig and they would be crushed.  The USA owns a bit of antarctica and so does Russia.  ~D

      Ah, the G-string chronicles.  I'll tell you what happened. As you probably already know I had band today. It was a very good practice, but the funny thing was not that it was a good practice for once, but the fact that Morgan's bass was out of tune, and I was sitting next to the basses, and so my band teacher had to come over twice and say quietly so the rest of the band couldn't hear I guess "ok Angus, play your g-string." If you have been reading some of my earlier blogs you will know that I have aptly named Angus Mr. G-string, because he once called out in band "hey, my g-string is broken  in other news, I guess there isn't really any, but if I think of something I'll blog again.

      Hello again!  Yesterday when mom tried to start the van to take me to school the battery died. It was just, dead. So I had to walk to band. I thought I would be late, but I wasn't that late, only around 2 minutes, the people in band just weren't getting everything set up as fast as they were suppossed to. So I wasn't really late. So I did band, and I made a (not so) terrible realization. Actually it was quite funny. I'm as tall as my Mr. C-W. Band as far as trouble makers go was BAD. They were all at their worst. But its over now so all I can do is think about it. (and I don't enjoy doing that!)  Yesterday we went to frenchys, and there were some people I knew there, but we were looking through the lingerie (for fun, don't get any ideas!) and I was finding underwear and strapless, and strapful (is that the right word for bra's with straps?) bras, all of which looked very becoming on dans head. there was one bra that lookin like it was entirely composed of lace. I don't wonder why somebody gave it to frenchys.   It looks pretty cold and windy outside ,and I don't really relish the thought of going to the library but I don't have a choice, and so I have to get going.

      I am blogging in my mom's office and I love blogging here because the keyboard is so fun. I just had to go for a bible study and Mom read a book to us about how the bible started.  I am glad that I don't have the same blogger set up. I like this a whole lot better.  So I am trying to cover my ears because the kids are having a lot of fun out there.  After I am done my blog I think I am going to join them.  So we lost the key to dad's office.  If we can't find it before dad gets back we are gonna get a whipping (Don't worry I am being sarcastic).  Yesterday we had subs and ginger ale for supper.  The movie that I rented from the library is back at the library now and it was really close because if I kept it for 1 more day I would have to pay a 2.00 fine or even more.  We are going to have Crossaints for lunch although I can't smell them right now. I can't wait till tomorrow because it is weekly shower day.  Almost all my showers are with Matthew and we always have a hit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Anyway I have to get on with my homeschooling so later!!!!!!!!!!  ~D

      Hey, I've got a new blogger set up. I don't think I like it at all, but I've seen other people have it, and so I don't know why it suddenly changed. Today is the first day that school is on, and that means that it is BAND day. Uh oh. Also wednesday is the day of the triple whammy, so I'm not really looking foward to it. oh well.   I'm going to draw your attention to the mystery spot thing again. IF you have ANY idea how to get rid of them PLEASE tell me in the guestbook. I will be eternally in your debt.   This blogger thing is really weird. I think i'm going to sign off now.   Dan has started to copy melanie in the signing of his name. Frankly I think ~M looks a lot better than ~D or even ~K. So I won't be a copy cat.  My goodness, how do you post this thing.

      I am in a really good mood right now. Math torture chamber was fun and easy and I didn't have to do to much.  I am finished angles and moving on to perpendicular lines.  Mcduff is our favorite dog.  He is in a book and his favorite food is Rice Pudding and Sausages with shortbread cookies and hot chocolate. So we had a Mcduff dinner with Sausages and rice pudding. After that we have a cup of hot chocolate and 3 shortbread cookies.  For the last 2 days we had that supper.  I hope the library is open today because I have to take back a DVD.  Mom is reading Sarah a story from my bible. It is her favorite and mine to.  It is the story of Samson.  Now here is a bit of the bible that you blog readers would like to hear.  One of Israel's judge was Ehud.  He went to the King Eglon of Moab and stabbed him with a 2-pointed dagger.  And then the King's bowel's emptied.  The dagger disappeared in the Kings fat.  Then he escaped.  The guards thought that he was in the lavatory but finally the opened the door and found him dead in a pile of poo.  Later ~D

      So yet another fun day in Abarbaville. We were graced last evening with a sleepover visit from Anna who is Katelyn's best friend and practically a family member. She is known as Anada (as in Oh Canada) by Dan and Blue by Ron - in fact she is programmed into our phone as Blue which upset her for a year or so but she is used to now. I think it would be fair to say that Anna comes from a more refined home than ours - where beautiful music is played by children and manners are observed, adults are often called Mr. and Mrs., etc. I think it would be safe to say things are a bit more lax at our house. The only rule we strictly adhere to is: no nude table dancing after the age of 3 - especially during dinner. So owing to our lack of manners rules I was not too surprised last night when my kids started teasing me about my love of 80's music. I do not understand how anyone could not appreciate the inspired words of Meatloaf's classic hit "I want you, I need you, but there ain't no way I'm ever going to love you. But don't be sad (don't be sad) 'cause 2 out of 3 ain't bad. " Don't get me started ... Rod Stewart, Burton Cummings, John Mellankamp, The Artist formerly known as Prince (who was known as Prince when he wrote "She wore a raspberry beret").... ah good times. But what my kids really like to bug me about is my singing voice and my insistence of singing at the top of my voice while on nature trails. So last night they were imitating me singing "The Hills are alive with the sound of music (ah-ah-ah-ah)" No admittedly I am a terrible singer, but they make me sound like a wounded animal. But here is the real clincher - ANNA JOINED RIGHT IN BUGGING ME. I acted shocked and appauled. My jaw dropped open. I looked over my glasses at her and said, "from now on young lady you can call me MRS Abarbanel". She just kept it up. I protested, "Anna I KNOW you would never get away with this at your house". She said, "Yes that's true, but at your house I just take my cues from Katelyn".   Katelyn also confided that she had told a friend in her band class about "the hills are alive", to which her friend said, "my mom sings that too. (sigh) At least now I know I'm not alone in the world".   Yesterday I resurrected a bedtime story Ron told the kids a LONG time ago when there were only 3 pirates. There are 3 monsters named Mystery Guest Number 1, Mystery Guest Number 2 and Paul. They are each about 6 feet tall, have blue fur and when the bend over you can see their pink bottoms - just like babboons. At night after the kids go to bed they take a bus to our house and knock on the door quietly. When we invite them in they always file into the living room and sit down on the couch. Now they are there to clean up the messes the lovely pirates made during the day. But they somehow each evening become obsessed with eating our children. (The idea, I think was to scare the children just enough to stay upstairs after they had been put to bed). Anyway, the only way we could stop them from eating our kids was to get them a dozen Tim Horton Donuts - which made them forget all about children and made them say in a salivating kind of Homer Simpson way, "Do-o-o-nuts" over and over again. So I told this story at supper time last night to Matthew. Matty sort of believed it, but as he mulled it over he realized that monsters are not real. Since his parents always tell the truth he rationalized that it had to be people dressing up as monsters. So he realized that now all he had to do was figure out who was dressing up as monsters and cleaning our house every night (and may I add that they aren't doing a very good job of cleaning our house). We recently had a guest named Paul Hubert - so he figured that must be the Paul. He asked Ron tonight if he knew who Mystery Guest #1 & Mystery Guest #2 were - and Ron said he thought they were Roger and Richie - 2 other recent guests. Matty got a big smile on his face to finally have solved the mystery of the house cleaners. Ah if all of life's problems were so simple. I just hope he doesn't find out that Paul lives in London, Ontario, Roger in Winnipeg and Richie in Vancouver. Then he'll be asking about flight and bus schedules to work out how they get to our house each night. Some day perhaps one of the kids can blog about other on-going stories such as: Ching Chong, the Trash Can Kids and Suki Wuki. Stay tuned!!

      Hello blog readers! Melanie, I am so sad that you can't blog in England.  Mom is not in a happy mood right now.  I finished the snow fort that me and the kids made in the front yard.  We have been working on it for quite some time and we are happy to kick back.  It needs some finishing touches but it is big enough to hold all five kids.  I poked a hole in the ceiling for a spy hole but I need a periscope.  Anyway it is very sturdy and we have not had the fort cave in once:)                                                                        Before Christmas we had a friend who came to babysit us often.  We told him the story about when we wrote poo and pee on a billboard.  We found the letter tiles scattered all over the place and so we decided to vandalize the Recycling Depot that was out of business.  Because of this he game us the name "The poo vandals".  Now we salute to dog poo every time we pass any.  We have a poo vandals website and everything.  Mom is looking for my mathbook and I hope she never finds it.  I have to get on with my homeschooling now so I will make a quick contest.  How many e's were there in the last paragraph??? E-mail me if you have the answer.

      This is Sammy writing, I am poking danny's hand while he is writing my blog.  Danny just gave me a corncob because I poked him in the butt.  I just poked dan in the nose with a pushpin and now he is trying to poke me in the cheek.  Now I am wrestling Dan from poking me in the bum.  Now I am sitting in the chair and Dan is out cold on the floor. Mom has just walked in on us and I am lifting Danny's head to try to revive him. I'd love to blog more but I fear Dan's life is at stake. Signed Super Sammy

      Since being stuck in the house for 3 days my life has become pretty boring. It has also become very cold. So I have decided to dig up some other stuff about my life that I've had forever (almost) but have never told you about.  I thought I would tell you my pet peeves:  #1. Teenager stereotypes, I HATE THEM. They usually consist of people goo gooing and ga gaing over your younger sisters and brothers, and then just saying hi to you. Somtimes this is pure chance, but also sometimes people will look at me and sat ts ts ts, teenagers, or hint that you're turning into one. My parents are a big part of this pet peeve, but that does NOT in anyway mean that other adults are exempt. Some people just naturally assume that if you have hit puberty you automatically smoke, do drugs, and have frequent and unneccesary fights with your parents. The big thing is though, I'M NOT EVEN A TEENAGER YET!!!!!! I won't be a teenager until october.  #2. Mystery spots. Mystery spots are those spots on your clothes that you have no idea where they came from. quite often they make an appearance on your favorite clothes, making them unsuitable to wear out in public. If ANYBODY has ANY idea how to get rid of them please tell me in the guest book. If I found a way to get rid of them I would be eternally grateful to the person who told me how. So please please please, if you know how to get rid of them tell me in the guestbook.  #3. The opposite of teenager stereotypes. This usually consists of people adopting unnatrually high voices when they speak to you. Since I am pretty tall this one doesn't happen very often, its usually #1 that is the more common atitude, but it has happened, and it drives me crazy as well. I guess people mostly have me mixed up with my brothers and sisters, so they think I am 3 and sam is 12 or something like that.

      So I believe Ron is now across the ocean enjoying the crowds of England ... I checked Air Canada and it said the plane had arrived! So now we begin "Operation the Cat's Away" in the midst of a state of emergency because of 95 cm of snow with more coming down now. A few people from Ontario called to see if we were OK and enquired about groceries. I was able to get to the grocery store yesterday though parking was a nightmare both because of snow piled on parking spots and too many people in the store. Unfortunately there wasn't much AT the store - no bread, no eggs, no milk. One of my Ontario friends asked with some alarm if we were going to be OK with no groceries. I felt like yawning and saying "you know this is our second state of emergency in 6 months. We can handle it. It is old news now."Here is my plan: I have a lot of frozen bread, 4 dozen eggs and various hot cereals and some canned goods. Each meal will simply be a variation on these items. Last night I told the kids we were having a proper English tea - I served them herbal tea with their toast and jam and had rice krispie squares for dessert. Then we read a funny book together before bed. The trick is just to make it SEEM exciting. Then they forget the lack of variation. Having electricity this time has made this state of emergency so much more pleasant. There are some advantages to Ron's absense: less laundry, don't have to worry about meat in meals as much. The kids like that they get to take turns either getting to sleep with me or sleeping on the floor in my room. Our rottweilers Rosie and Floyd seem to know they have a job to do when Ron is away and instead of sleeping outside our room they take their places on the main level, guarding the house from  would-be intruders. Sammy loves to play an unhygenic game called "Rosie and Floyd" with me. As a puppy Floyd liked to chew on Rosie's ears. Sam likes me to re-enact this by chewing lightly on this ears. Sammy says, "don't bite, just nipple" (meaning nibble, of course - this is not an 18A web-site. I had planned during this time to read a book that promises to explain physics in a way that any layperson can understand. It is written by Bill Bryson - a travel writer whom I love. I have long felt I have been handicapped by my lack of physics knowledge. And I put the blame squarely on Percy West - my high school physics teacher. He was actually a phys ed teacher who had no university physics courses, but in a rural high school you can't be choosy. On the other hand I contribute my absolute love of biology and agriculture to Paul Watson, my high school biology teacher. He was a very serious alcoholic who we all called "Tex" for some reason. We didn't learn much on the days he was drunk, but on the days he was sober he was an excellent teacher. I took every course he taught. Well must go now and think of some imaginative way to serve toast for lunch. Cheers.

      After two days of waiting I am now at the airport hoping to get on a flight to London. It is looking good at the moment because I have a boarding pass (first class might I add) and the flight is showiing on-time. If I get my hopes up though I am afraid that I will jinx it, so I am staying sombre.  I did not sleep last night - too much restless energy - and have been at the airport all day. I fly all night and then have to stay up all day tomorrow, so I will be a wreck. But I sympathize with my dear wife who is at home with the five pirates. I think she will be more tired than I at the end of all this. I love you honey!! Of course Sam threw up yesterday and now a flu is likely to strike while I am gone. Why does this always happen?  This blog is my feeble attempt at killing time. I have 5 hours to wait before I am supposed to fly. I am bored.  Dan, though the CAT is away, remember that he can read what the MICE are playing via this BLOG which mom will keep up-to-date I'm sure.  I already miss the kids. I'll try and post some experiences through the week. For now, pray that I make it to England!!

      Just lovelly! I spent some time sleeping and before I even had my breakfast dad told me I had to shovel the driveway out. Nova Scotia and Pei have declared it a state of emergency, which would make it the 2nd state of er that we've had in 6 months. I think this is also the second or third we've had since we moved here What was it? oh yeah 6 years ago. Anyway we finished shoveling the WHOLE driveway and so now i'm here. (but first I had to eat breakfast and do my chores.) Now I'm hungry for lunch. I'm also very sore.

      Just lovely! I spend a lot of time planning this trip to England and on the day I am supposed to leave we get a snowstorm of unprecendented proportions. There are no flights for two days for most of the other people going and I fortunately snapped up the last one tomorrow. SIGH. I hope IT does not get delayed!!  I spent the whole day making alternate arrangements and reorganizing things and packing and grunting under my breath. It is not a happy place anywhere near me. I'm sure I'll feel better in a month or two though. Ok - maybe a few days.

      I can feel the house shaking, and I can't see a thing out there. Me and sarah tried to shovel the driveway, but all we suceeded in doing was half of it before it got dark. The blowing snow will have made it just like before we started again. I look foward to it, only this time i'm gonna be sore.

      Is it just me, or is the snow twice as hight as it once was? I'm pretty sure i'm right because we were out there to play and we had footprints, about as deep as my leg going into the ground and a big tower that the plow left, but now it is all smooth except for a teeny weeny bit of the hill, which i'm sure will soon be covered. I can't tell if the snow is actually falling anymore, but blowing snow is a BIG factor here. It is so bad sometimes that I can't even see across the street.

      Yesterday was a lot of fun. in the morning we all went to tim hortons, and then in the afternoon dad took us to york redoubt for a scavenger hunt. It was VERY icy there, and so we were always slipping. one of the items was a candy wrapper and i was the only one that found one. It was a very old looking caramel wrapper. A lot of the stuff was hard to find because the ground was covered in ice. Then that night we wen't to swiss chalet for supper. We don't usually go out for supper so this was a special treat.   Today we had a HUGE snowstorm. the snow is probably 3 feet deep in places. its so deep that my entire leg goes into the snow. Understandably its very hard to get out. Its so bad that some of the plows can't run, and when I woke up I could just barely see across the street. As a result of the storm dads flight was canceled, so he had to cancel all the train tickets, and do all this stuff because he won't be going to england today. He is going (god willing) tomorrow instead. All day Mom and dad have been on  the phone and internet finding flights and train tickets for tomorrow, because none of the planes are running. As a result I can't use the phone.   Also I'm not sure about melanies flight, because I'm pretty sure it goes from vancouver to halifax, and I don't know if it will be able to land here. If it does it'll look like she's staying here for the night. If not then she will have to get another flight from vancouver to halifax.  The snow has pretty well buried our neighbours car. It has gotten up to about 1/3 of our van though  Anyway thats enough. My fingers have been excersized enough. They are getting tired. I'm starting to take bigger breaths. I'm sweating on this bitterly cold day. All because of typing. All because of the blog. Who would have thought that a blog would be a way to keep warm. Anyway.

      Today was fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!! First we went to Tim Hortons and then we went home then we went on a scavenger hunt and then we went to Swiss Chalet for supper.  After that we got to read Cheaper by the Dozen which is really good because we haven't been able to read it for a very long time (Sorry Melanie).  Any way we did our bible study and it was about Samson who was Isreal's judge for 20 years.  He is the kind of guy who likes to hang out with women.  He nearly married a Philistine women but then she got married to Samson's best man.  Later he slept with a prostitute, and then he finally married Delilah.  Anyway in the bible Usually the only happy people are dead people and there were a lot of happy people in the bible.  Samson killed himself by pushing on the pillars that supported the temple that he was in.  When he pushed over the pillars he also killed more Philistine men then ever before.  P.S.  He once killed 1000 Philistine men with the Jawbone of a Donkey.  He made a poem and here it is. I used a donkey's jawbone to kill a  thousand men, I hit them with the jawbone over and over again.  I have to go now, it is my bedtime.

      Guess what?  I'm DEVASTATED!!!!! Platinum blonde is going to england and she won't be blogging very much. I think i'm going to go to bed and cry.  well enough of that. I had band today, and normally we have a band triatlon (that means almost 3 hours of band) but today we only had 1 hour, and i'm very grateful. I heard the secertary say to my band teacher "Angus G-string's home sick today, so that is why he missed band." (she didn't really say his last name was g-string, but that is my nickname for him, see earlier blogs for reference.) Also I would have liked to tell his mother that he rarely shows up for band anyway. We don't miss him. (sorry angus hilts, but his first name really is angus) (his former last name was ?-guess)  Anyway my day has not really been a bad day. Now I have to go, because I have to get the kids ready because we're going on a scavenger hunt.

      This is Sarah writing. On Sunday at our church they had a big lunch to celebrate Valentine's Day. One of the drinks was "Snowman Soup". So you take a package of Hot Chocolate, add 1 cup of hot water, then you put mini marshmallows in it,  a chocolate candy and a mini candy cane. All these things go right into the hot chocolate. It tasted good. I have been making a lot of plastecine dolls. When people come over I make them dolls that look like them. But then there was a problem. My fingers forgot how to make them.  It all started with the hair. I had been able to stretch out the hair to go on the dolls. But now I have forgotten how to do it. And then I started on the body. The colours got all mixed up so I made a doll that had all mixed up colours for the clothes and the face. I decided the doll was face-painted so I wouldn't have to be disappointed. But I was still disappointed. So I made greyish-brownish hair. It looked ugly but I thought my mom would like it so I gave it to her. It also had beads on it. Mommy liked it.  She liked it because the clothes looked tie-dyed and she loves tie-dyed clothes. Then Sammy grabbed it (he is 3) and rolled it into a ball. And then I started crying because that was horrible because it was probably the last doll I was going to make in my life.  I made a plastecine flag that was Canadian. But I didn't think I did a good job on it. It took me a long time because I did it before bed. It hurt my back. Finally I finished it. And I looked at it and I thought it didn't look like the Canada flag. So in the morning I showed my mom. She liked it. The night I was making it while she was tucking me in she told me this is what our friend Randy who is an artist said, "Doing art takes practise. You have to practise to get good". Mom took us to the bead pod (a store that sells beads) and I got a mixed-up bottle of beads. But Katelyn told me not to lock the door of my bedroom. So Sammy went into my room and took the beads and spilled them all over the floor. I cleaned them up and got lots of beads back in the bottle. There were some beads that I loved that were missing so I decided that I didn't want mixed-up beads anymore. So me and mom are going to go to the bead pod sometime this week or next week. We are going to get a non mixed-up bottle of beads.

      I am blogging at the library.  Luckily I am not using the computer with the hard-to-press spacebar.  Yesterday we went to subway for lunch, then we went skating at the frog pond and then we went to Tim Hortons for a hot chocolate.  Then we went home and put away the groceries.  We just got The Emperors New Groove (It is a movie) from the library and the other kids are watching it while I am doing work.  We can't book the computers at the library because they are already booked for the whole day.  It really stinks because we always get to book the computers and we can't today.  That means we have to do extra work.  Anyway I started working on Antarctica in my geography and it is pretty easy.  I am not using my stereo very often anymore because the noise that the kids make is enough for me.  In the library it is nice and quiet.  I have to go and to my work so Goodbye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Yesterday was a lot of fun.   Dad decided that in order not to be boring he was going to take us to subway, and then skating, and then to Tim Hortons. It was a lot of fun, because I like going to subway and Tim Hortons AND I LOVE going skating, so I really had a very good day. The thing was though, dad was constantly reminding us that this was a one day deal, and he was going to be boring as ever on other days. I guess that was because he wanted us to get our school work done. The funny thing is though, I got it all done, and all my chores, and more besides.   A couple days ago I was a the drug store looking for something, and I saw a hi-liter. You know when you see something, and then you think for no apparent logical reason "Hey, I want one of those". That's what I thought, and before you knew it I was walking out of the store, highlighter in hand. So last night I was doing some work, and you should see it. More than half of it is highlighted. Its kind of funny really.  The kids and mom are all at the library, so it is kind of nice to be sitting here by myself, if only for the fact that I can't think of anything else to say. Also it is freezing cold down here, so I think I will sign off...

      I was holding Matthew while singing in Church yesterday. I noticed that once we start singing he always comes to me so that I can hold him. He puts his arms around my neck and presses his face against mine. It is quite lovely on most occassions, but yesterday he was pressing his face against my head extra hard. I had to ask him what he was doing. He said, "I'm listening to your brain." I guess that means I have one - in case there was any doubt out there! Though it is disturbing to me that it makes sounds. I don't think it is supposed to do that. Any ideas? Is the soundproofing on my skull wearing away?  Today I think I was unanimously declared the most boring dad of the century by ALL my kids. My darling wife concured with their prognosis. Any dads out there will sympathize with the deeps wounds I am licking as a result of all this. Not spending enough time with the pirates always comes back to haunt you. So, mostly out of guilt, I took them to subway for lunch, then skating and then Tim Hortons. It was fun - except for tying their skates in sub-antarctic temperatures, cleaning up two spilt hot chocolates and being completely exhausted. I need a hug.  We have a potential WINNER for our contest. Once Melanie Wallace (aka Platinum Blonde) answers the skill testing question, she will be declared the winner!! We will post a new contest in months to come so stay tuned!!

      Okay, I am freezing my liver off.  Katelyn is blogging on the computer downstairs so I am using Mom's computer in her FREEZING office.  It was my fault that Sarah slid down the rope.  I coaxed her to do it and she did it with no fear at all.  Dad still hasn't finished the basement; he has to put the smoke alarm in and then he is done.  Katelyn and Sarah are happy that the smoke alarm is not put in because whenever mom has a shower the smoke alarm goes off and Katelyn and Sarah get woken up.  My feet are numb.  Last night me, Sarah, Katelyn and dad watched the lion king 1 1/2.  It was funny.  Now I can't find my protracter so I can't do my math.  The day is sunny but cold and I am so cold I have to go now!!!!!!!!  So long!

      Hello Everybody!!!  Today is again the start of the school week and i'd like to say i'm happy to be here (not!). Right now I am sitting here typing at the computer with a basket on my head (don't ask me why, but it may be because those basket things caught on my hair, so i'm too lazy,and perhaps too scared to try and take it off my head) and anyway i'm sitting here. Let me tell you about all the stuff that has happened since my last blog.   Firstly last night, dad went to the video store and rented the lion king 1 1/2. It was pretty funny, and I really enjoyed watching it with everybody else. Then I was so tired and I went to bed. I woke up at about 9:30 (I know i sleep it, but i JUST CAN'T HELP IT!!!!!!!!) it really drives me crazy because I always feel really tired in the daytime, and then I can never get to sleep at night, and then I wake up tired at like 9!!!!!!!  Ow, I just got the basket off my head.   Anyway we have these jams that daddy bought at a fundraiser for ark, and I asked mom if I could try some. She said yes, so I put 2 pieces of bread in the toaster, and once they were toasted I took them out and spreaded half of them with each kind of jam. (there were four jars) I was starting to eat the first piece, and then mom said, "actually that ones chutney, its meant to be eaten with rice, but I guess it'll be ok on bread." Whoops. It actually tasted very good on bread, but I won't have it again with toast.   Sarah broke a cup in the kitchen and daddy swept the whole kitchen floor. It didn't break the record for largest dirt pile, whick was about 3 feet high in the middle and was about the size around of about 2/3 of our table. It was still pretty big. So I had to hear dad grumble about how we were all worse than pigs. I wish i'd never told him that pigs were actually very neat and clean. (and its true, because they always have a special corner to go poo and they only roll in the mud to discoarage flies and to keep cool)

      So I am 2 days away from wrapping up some very hecting living on my part. The basement was but a fraction of it. The rest is too involved and would bore you. But I am taking Monday to Wednesday and working at home and not meeting any people if I can help it. I am going to spend lots of time with the kids, reminding them that they have a father. I am going to let Marsh do whatever she wants.  This morning I watched Silly-Sarah ride her rope contraption in the back yard with Daring-Dan at her side. The main rope was attached to a tree on one side and the shed door on the other. It did not look very safe to me and my first impulse was that she was going to kill herself by an accidental hanging. I was going to say something, but then remembered that we had insurance. So I watched as my baby climbed into another rope that was looped around the primary rope on the tree end (yes she also had to climb the tree first). As she let go and started to slide down I realized that she was going to make it. What I failed to realize was what happened next. The door to the shed was torn off by the weight. It was quite funny in a disturbing kind of way. Another fix-it job for my todo list. What really got to me is that the damage was less than our deductible so our insurance was, once again, useless.  And for those who are wondering about my parenting ability or perhaps my sanity remember that I wonder too. That is part of being a Dad in charge of 5 pirates.

      I still don't feel like blogging but something very funny just happened.   I was sitting on the stairs and there were 2 shoeboxes on the stairs. I picked on up, and sam yelled at me. What he said was unintelligable and so I said "what?" Don't, thats moms box. then we had a tug o' war fight with the box. all the time he was yelling and it was a couple of minutes before I realized what he was saying "don't bite the box!" i was thinking "What?!" I asked him, for some reason "can I bite you instead" the answer nearly knocked my socks off. "Yes"  Tell me readers, who but a 3 year old would protect his mothers shoebox by being self sacrificial, i.e getting himself bit instead of the box. I don't know. In the end I put the box back on the stairs and corncobbed him instead.   (see one of dans earlier blogs for the definition of a corncob)

      I really need to go back into proper blogging habits, but I really don't feel like blogging right now, even though I have to today, because I've only done four proper blogs this week, but I just can't (this might have something to do with the fact that the kids are screaming in the backround, but i'm not complaining =) I hope i'll feel like blogging later, and once again I'M SORRY, and I wish i felt like blogging etc. Will have to blog more later anyway.

      Ah a fresh Valentines day blog from Dan, So I spent the last hour in my bed lying down with Sammy and getting some very painful bites and pinches when I decided to use kid control. (Elevators.  For those who don't know about this Sammy got stuck in a elevator at the library and now he is scared of elevators).  Anyway so Sammy is screaming his head off so I decided to stop yelling elevator.  We are having a babysitter over for this morning (his name is Sam). Yesterday was a good day eve though we had to walk to the library on a really cold day.  We also had to walk back.  I need to get a present for mom and dad but I don't know how I am going to do that (If Sam (the babysitter)could drive than there might be a chance.  So long!!!

      I am at the library as I write this. the spacebar on this computer is really hard to press down, and besides being very annoying, it also might cause some words to be stuck together. Today I won platinumblondes survivor contest, even though I haven't watched any of the shows, so I am bragging a lot about it. Brag brag brag. Sadly she still hasn't featured me on her blog, so I'm trying to remind her a lot.   I'm going to do another blog later because this spacebar is SO ANNOYING!

      As of tonight there are 12 unique unAbarbablogelian signatures in our guestbook. 2 more and then whoever gets the next one wins the contest (see the contest rules in the guestbook).  So Marsha has covered the essential details of the last few days. I have but one morcel to add.  As some of you may know, Matthew got engaged this summer to his swimming instructor Ashley. The wedding date is set for sometime in the year 2023. As I was tucking him in tonight I asked him if he would like to marry Gluten-Girl. I will do my best at capturing our dialogue from memory and you will have to add his childlike voice inflections for yourself:  Matt: "Dad! I can't marry Gluten-Girl because I would have to divorce Ashley." Me: "So what is wrong with divorcing Ashley?" Matt: "God has a rule not to divorce, so I can't break the rule." Me: "Oh! Well that's too bad for Gluten-Girl." Matt: "I can marry both of them, but that would be complicated." Me: "Really? You can marry both of them?" Matt: "Well no. Because it would get all mixed up." Me: "What would be mixed up?" Matt: "Well, you see, if the kids were making too much noise, one would tell the kids to go upstairs and the other would tell the kids to go downstairs and it would be too confusing." Me: "Yes, that would be confusing."  So the 2023 wedding is still on and Matt is proving to be a man of oustanding moral character. Sorry Gluten-Girl, but Sam is available probably around the year 2025. And for those who are wondering what Matt has given up to keep his integrity:

      I am very sorry to all the people who read the blog that have been dissappointed by the lack of blogging lately. As it is I don 't have very much time to blog, so I will just give you a brief overview of my excuses and be off.   Excuse #1: I had SUCH a busy day yesterday, first I did a lot of work, and then I had to go to a band marathon, which lasted from 12:00 to 2:45. Then I wen't home, and I had to do my chores, which I finally got time to do, and then I had to babysit, and then sam came over, and then steven and susan came over, and then Laura, Esther, Jane, and (drumroll) GLUTENGIRL!!!!!!! Then we ate supper, and ice cream, and then we played 2 games of uno, and then I went to bed. I case you were wondering all this things happened in rapid succession, so as you can see I had NO TIME to blog.  Excuse #2. Today, I was doing my work, and then we had to go to lawleys, and then we had to have lunch, and then we had to go to the library, and then I had to pack for a sleepover, and I spent close to a half hour frantically looking around for my toothbrush before I realized I'd already packed it in my bag. Also I had to contend with taking 2 bags, because one of them has my flute in it, that I have to take to band tomorrow morning.   I am very sorry I can't do the bible part today, because I'm already in a big rush. I know I didn't do it on tuesday either, and I am VERY sorry to all my fans, but I will try and reward you we an extra good on either tomorrow or on saturday. When ever I'm not so busy.

      My Dear readers,  It has been too long since anyone in our house has blogged. I can explain everything. First, myself. I have this terrible cold whose most annoying symptom is a non-productive cough. Ron has suggested that I don't cough - that once you start you can't stop. Sorry to bore you with cough symptoms - suffice it to say that I am feeling sorry for myself.  So this is my excuse number 1 for not blogging. The second excuse is crazy but fun business going on at our house. Yesterday I spent about an hour on the phone talking to a train booking person in England for a Train Line called Virgin. Now calling a train line Virgin did strike me as funny but when in London ... so I booked 500 pounds worth of train tickets for 8 people for Ron's mission trip there in a few weeks. Conclusions: it is expensive to travel around England. But it was sort of exciting to do it. I do like administration. Please don't hate me for saying that.  Then last night we had a big dinner party where we invited 8 students over including 5 girls from my "Romanettes" group (because we are studying Romans). I love these girls. Good times. It was officially the Grand Opening of Matthew's restaurant "Deep Sea Chicken" So Matthew chose the menu: Cranberry chicken, brown rice, green beans, peas, sunshine salad, homemade bread plus appetizers of assorted cheeses and crackers. For dessert we had make your own Sundaes and brownies which was a highlight for a lot of the students. I must admit I tend to go a bit overboard in making fancy dinners when students come over - but I do have this incredible love for students and I want to express how special we think they are. So one of the girls - a great girl named Katharine- dressed up as a Deep Sea Chicken Superhero. Matt had dreamed up her persona last week. Her name is Gluten Girl as she has Celiac disease (a severe allergy to gluten). She had a cape on, a big GG on her chest a la superman, etc, etc. We gave her a grand entrance with a theme song and Matt was so happy. All through the evening Matt was stopping us all to stand on top of the couch to make announcements like, "At Deep Sea Chicken we are going to have waterfalls with different kinds of pop in them so you can just dip your glasses in the waterfall when you are thirsty". He was very funny and took it all very seriously, calling our guests his Deep Sea Chicken Board of Directors. The kids insisted on doing "HIGH/LOW" with the group - we do this every night at supper. You tell the High of your day and the Low of your day. It was fun. My low was that in the morning I started working on booking train tickets in my housecoat. The doorbell rang so I quickly threw on some clothes. After talking to my friend for a few minutes she said "you have something sticking out of your pants" - it was my housecoat - which had been caught in my waistband!! (Isn't our blog more exciting than the National Enquirer?) Sarah's high involved a rope they have rigged up in the back yard - it is tied to the deck on one end and a tree on the other. They get into a garbage can and slide down the rope. This may sound dangerous - I think it might be. But it does give me time to have a cup of tea. I actually sent them out both morning and afternoon yesterday, insisting that the guests had requested that they have lots of available oxygen to make playing with them more enjoyable. And they believed me, gullible little angels that they are.

      Sorry I didn't blog earlier.    I had a very busy day (not) which consisted of waking up, eating breakfast, brushing teeth etc. doing math, doing science, having lunch (which was good, because we had egg muffins, which I LOVE), and then going off to the library to study. Then I had to listen to dan whine and complain all the way home from the library, because I would't give him a piece of gum. Finally I took one out and threw it on the ground a couple feet in front of us (with the wrapper still on) and said "Oh look dan, a piece of gum" to make a long story short he stopped whining and complaining. I'm going to make him pay interest for it thought (ha ha only joking).   Blah blah blah. Thats what this day seems like. Lately I seem to be having very boring days. Don't know why. I have a contest for you guys. Try and write a poem in the guestbook, and I'll award a prize to the one that is least boring. I have differing taste for different types of poetry, so anykind will do. The prize will be honerable mentions in the blog, and in the guestbook, and also the right to be proud that you are such an accoplished poet. I must have at least 5 poems to choose a winner. the poems can be about anything, within reason.  Will blog more later, its suppertime

      Does anybody know the answer to my contest??!!. I will give you a hint.  Go to the store and look at a toilet paper pack.  Find out how long each one is and e-mail me. If you are wrong than try again with a different company that makes toilet paper and e-mail me.  There is only so many toilet paper company's in the world you know:)  Anyway Mom and Dad had a bible study last night and do you know what I like about bible studys?  After the bible studys there is always some really yummy leftovers. So I decided that I would set my watch alarm to 6:00 so I could have my own private feast.  Unfortunately the watch did not do the trick.  I woke up at 7:30 and missed my feast.  As I went downstairs I saw Sam heading to the basement to his early Pre-school game.  Matt came down to.  So I asked mom if I could have some of the leftover cake and she said yes so I felt fine.  We are going to have Egg Muffins for Lunch and I can smell them.  So Long!!!!!!!

      Monday. Marsha's day "off" (grocery shopping, errands and possibly a hot tea and a few moments to herself) and I am home with the pirates alone. Scary!!  We are having people over for dinner tonight so I made an attempt at cleaning - which I hate. Here are some things that I find particularly revealing about life here from my cleaning venture:  1) There was jam splattered down the cupboard doors (inside and out) that took me 10 minutes to dislodge. 2) I tried rolling the fridge to clean underneath it, but it would not move. I had to lift it to get the dirt out from underneath it so that I could roll it and get the rest. 3) The kitchen ceiling has all kinds of ingredients mashed into the paint and will be cleaned only by a fresh coat of paint. 4) There is peanut butter all over the place. 5) After sweeping the kitchen floor it took 3 FULL dustpans to put it in the garbage.  Sam put his two front teeth through his chin yesterday (this is the second time that he has done this). He seems fine. I hope it will heal well without stiches like the last time he did it.   Got to go because it is 2:20 and I have lots more to do before supper.

      So the basement is finished thanks to my unique father. In reference to Dad's blog toilet paper all over the floor is not from the Sumo-Wrestling matches that me and Sam have but it is from the Incredible Hulk (Sam).  He simply loves to have a bath in toilet paper.   So I have a contest about toilet paper.  I am going to ask you blog readers a question.  How long is a roll of our kind of toilet paper?  The prize is a chance in the ring with Dumpling-Dan and Sumo-Sam.  Any time and any place (Except for Japan; You will be forced to put on a thong).  If you think you have the answer then e-mail me or put your answer in our guestbook.   So if you want to know what it is like to Sumo-Wrestle then here is your chance to find out!!!!!  So long!!!!!

      Alright dad, thats one good blog, now I'm looking for at least 2 more this week. (And thats even less than I have to do, because I have to do 5 per week, and I think so does dan so he's very lucky to be given an only 3 per week rule)  Also Platinum blonde hasn't blogged in the last day. I'M CRUSHED! I love reading Platinum's blog, and so when she doesn't blog I always have to send her a harassing e-mail gently reminding her.   The Romanettes (thats moms bible study) sent matthew and sarah cards, because they made one of the girls named catherine who has celiac disease into a superhero, and drew pictures and framed them for her.   I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!!!!!!! I STILL HAVE PRACTICALLY TOTAL BLOG BLOCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh well. I guess I'll just have to skip to the bible part AGAIN!!!!!!! I've found a gross bit to use today.   Can anybody guess how old homosexualism is? About 3 or 4 thousand years old I'd guess, because it mentions it in leviticus 18:22   I really have to go now, because I have to go outside with everybody else.

      Seeing how I have been soundly shunned by my daughter for not blogging sufficiently I shall muster up what energy I have left and give you glimpses of our life from my humble perspective over the coming days.  What started as a "small" project to give Sarah her own room, as you are all well aware, has turned into a behemoth of a renovation project in our basement (ok, well, maybe double the projected amount of work). It has sucked every last ounce of free time I have had. The good news is that after a strong push yesterday is it mostly complete and I think it looks pretty darn good for an amateur carpenter. There are a few flaws which oddly enough reflect my life.  1) One set of double doors does not line up perfectly in a somewhat prominent way, but it happens to be the first set of doors you see. The other double doors don't line up either, but you would never be able to tell. 2) There are a few cracks in the corners that no one will ever see except me, and they will drive me nuts. 3) I varnished over our pine rail and shelves, but noticed that there was a little dirt in a few spots after the varnish went on. So now, in those places, the dirt is permanent and shiny. To get rid of it would take more work than I am prepared to engage in - though believe me I would like to get the dirt out.  Being so consumed by all the basement work and regular work I have been keeping track of the goings on of my kids at night via this blog (NOTE TO PARENT - THIS IS BAD PARENTING AT ITS WORST). I have come in to our house on several occasions to find toilet paper streamed all over the place. I have reached a point, which only parents of 5 or more kids may ever reach, when you no longer ask questions like, "why is this toilet paper all over the place?" or "who put this toilet paper all over the place?" Anyhow blog readers, I was delighted to discover that the toilet paper came from Dan and Sam's Sumo Wrestling ring (which he wrote about one day in this blog and which I read). I knew there was a perfectly good explanation. I just wish sometimes that the Sumo Wrestlers would clean up (wipe up?) after themselves.  I think this is a good start to blogging more so I will sign off. I have to go carry a Sumo Wrestler to bed and you know how hard that can be.

      Well today was not uneventful. Actually it was. Except for one thing. Sammy put 2 teeth through his lip, and so now he is crying a bit and experiencing some seperation anxiety from Mum. Mum doesn't think he needs stitches, and I don't either. I'm having a lot of trouble coming up with news. Carolyn and Caleb and Isaac just came over. Ummmm ummm. I have total blog block. I guess I'll just have to skip to the bible part. I've decided to do a thing now about strong women in the bible, instead of gross bits now, because I haven't been reading any lately. But don't worry if I find more in my reading they WILL be featured in my blog.   Abimelech was Gideons son, and he proclaimed himself king. He then killed all his brothers, (except for one because he escaped) so that he wouldn't have any competition. Then he set about conquering cities. he had practically conquered a city, and all the people had taken refuge in a strong tower in the city. Just as abimelech was standing underneath it to set it on fire, a (very strong woman, at least physically, because she had to lift that thing) threw a millstone down at him and cracked his skull. Abimelech turned to the guy next to him and said "Quick, draw your sword and kill me, because I don't want it to be said that I was killed by a woman"  Of course we all know who really killed him.  I've just thought of something. Mom and Dad, and especially dad hardly ever blog. So here is a message for mom and dad especially. START BLOGGING. The way we're going this is officially going to be strictly Dan's and my blog. Also don't be afraid to supplement my message in the guestbook.

      Band day today. It was ok, mr. g-string wasn't there, and neither were Mr. Trumpet and Mr. Goofy-sax so It was an ok time. I don't have band at lunch on fridays anymore, which is really good, because I only have to have a ride once during all the 3 times I have to be at band in a week. But anyhow band was pretty boring.   I babysat again last night. It was ok, only I had some trouble getting dan and sarah to go to bed at their bedtimes, and even though dan was supposed to put sammy to bed to help me, sam kicked and screamed for me to do it. It took me half an hour to put sam to bed. First I took his diaper off, and since he hadn't pooed I asked him if he needed to poo on the toilet. He did, so I spent about five minutes yelling "Come on poopie, come on". Then sam said very proudly "When I go poo I get licorice." The problem with licorice is that as soon as sam has got one piece, dad eats the rest. I told sam that we didn't have any licorice right now. He told me to go to the grocery store and get some. By that time the poo was coming out. It was this little teeny weeny piece of poo, hanging by this little teeny weeny string of poo. AND THAT THING WOULD NOT JUST PLOP INTO THE TOILET!!!!!!! I had to resort to shaking sammy over the toilet. But eventually that STUPID PIECE OF POO finally plopped and I got all of the kids to come in and clap, and told sam that mommy would go to the grocery store tomorrow and buy some licorice. As it is I'm glad I'm getting payed for things that are longer than a half hour, and involve serving supper, cleaning up and cheering because a toddler pooed and finally getting around to putting everybody to bed.   Ok here is everyones favorite part of the blog. Its time for  the gross bit of the bible. Its in genesis 34  Dinah was jacobs daughter. She went out to visit the women in the land. When Shechem the prince saw her he fell in love with her, and he took her to his bed, and violated her (won't say the proper word just in case). Shechem said to his father "Get me that woman for my wife" When Jacob heard about it all his sons were in the fields with the animals so he was quiet until they came home. Then he told them. They were really mad, because shechem had done something BAD. The king said to the, "My son is downright determined to have your daughter for a wife. How about your families and my families intermarry. Then you can settle on our land." Then shechem said "Make the bride price as big as you like, ONLY I WANT YOUR DAUGHTER." Because Shechem had done something BAD Jacobs sons lied to them. They told him "well obviously we can't intermarry with you guys because you're not circumcised But if all you guys got circumcised we would gladly intermarry." Shechem wanted Dinah so much that he ordered all the men including himself and his father to get circumcised. So all the males in the city were circumcised. 3 days later, while all the men were still groaning in pain, and probably driving their wives crazy, Simeon and Levi went into the city and killed all teh men. Oh my.

      Ah orthodontistry. As you might have guessed I went to the orthodontist today. The dentist said last year that I would probably have braces by Christmas 2003, but I didn't and it turns out I'm not getting them until august. Also they gave me this little card, that I am supposed to present to the receptionist upon arrival for all my appointments. I thought it was kind of stupid, because little random pieces of paper don't usually last long in our house, but this one is going into dads office so I hope it will last until august. I'm getting the braces on on august 30th, but I have an appointment on the 17th, probably just to make sure. I'm not exactly looking forward to braces, but I guess I'll survive them. The card has all the rules of braces on the back. Just to remind me I guess. Here they are: I have to brush my teeth immediately after eating. (I guess this is because food can get caught between the wires and completely decompose in your mouth before you finally get it out, of maybe if you brush extra frequently you have more chance of getting it our) 2. Chewing gum and sticky candy is harmful and is prohibited. It may cause cavities and breakage of orthodontic appliances. (I read this one and I was like DUH, but maybe a lot of people don't know that I don't know, I did notice that it only said chewing gum, so I'm free to chew bubble gum, ha ha, not.) 3. See your dentist regularly  for periodic cavity exams. (how regularly? Every week, every fortnight, every month, every 6 weeks, every 2 months, every three months, every 4 or 5 months, or every 6 months like I've always been doing it?) 4. Please notify the office immediately of any loose bands or broken appliance. (They make your mouth seem like an industrial Mecca calling anything inside my mouth an appliance) 5. (lastly) Please bring this card at each appointment and notify receptionist on arrival. (I guess most families who have their children get braces are rich families with only children, because there is usually NO WAY  that a little piece of really thin cardboard, or rather thick paper is going to last for 6 months. Of  course I will abide by all these rules, because they are all reasonably rules, except for maybe the last one. Another thing. I have to wear my retainer at night for 10 years. My friend told me that you're actually supposed to wear it for your whole life, but now I know she's wrong, and I am very happy about it. Still 10 years is a long time. That means by that time I might even be married. Anyhow.  As for the disgusting bit of the bible today it is in Exodus 32.   Moses went up Mt. Sinai with 2 stone tablets for god to inscribe the ten commandments. He took a really long time so the Israelites said to his brother make us a god because we don't know what happened to Moses. So Aaron said take all your gold jewelry off and throw it all in a pile.  Then they melted it all up and made it into a golden calf. After they had been worshiping it for a while god told Moses what they were doing. Moses was SO MAD. He ground the calf into gold powder and made them drink it. (THAT IS DISGUSTING) Ironically then god sent a plague down on them. I'll say quite  possibly the plague was a result of the gold dust. I'm guessing they had BAD stomach aches and hard poo (I mean that's what happens when you have metal in your poo.)

      Hello all you people out there (which isn't very many but our audience is growing by the day so...)  I thought melanies pink pants story was pretty funny (see platinum blonde @ www.platinumblonde.blogspot.com) I have a suggestion for her though. Maybe she should try washing them and they would fade some. Maybe they would turn a nice pastelly pink colour and then she wouldn't have to buy dye.   Its a really grungy rainy day in halifax. I have a band lesson but I'm not sure, with the rain. Anyway I'm not really looking foward to band, seeing as probably like half the people won't be there, leaving much more  room for all the mr.s, both the ones that I have already mentioned in previous blogs. So far I've had a pretty boring day, except for when I had to do a science experiment, but I won't know the results until friday, and I had to use veggie stock instead of a chicken boullion cube, so I'm not sure that its going to work properly.   As for the disgusting bit of the bible today. Saul didn't really like david, but he said that he could have his older daughter merab for a wife. Fut the time came for merab to marry and she was given to someone else. So saul decided to give david his younger daughter michal instead. Only one catch. Saul wanted a bride price of 100 philistine foreskins (look it up in the dictionary, ha ha). The really gross part is that david got all 100 forskins and carried off michal. The only thing I'm wondering is after David killed the philistine (and i'm presuming he killed them, because you don't exactly say "Alright, pull down those pants so I can get at your foreskin" to an enemy soldier) but did he take the whole thing, or was he very perticular and meticuliously cut off the foreskin along the lines? Tell me at our guestbook if you want.

      Another hour in the math torture chamber is a big big bummer.  Here are some reasons that I hate math  #1 Fractions.  Every time I open my math book there is a full 4 pages of just fractions.  Now I like fractions but when you are forced to do the same thing over and over again it gets really boring.  #2  The time.  It always takes a really long time and by the time you are finished you are half asleep.  #3 Mom.  She tells me to do 4 pages of math and once I am finished she tells me to do 2 more and than 2 more.....  #4 Dad.  Refuses to help me.  He works in the basement for the whole day.  I ask him for help.  He tells me to look in my textbook.  The textbook is just another load of fractions.  So that is why I hate math. The library is open again and now it is a lot more fun because the library is one of the funnest place on earth.  I want to go skating.  It is raining but I still feel like we should go skating.  I have only gone skating once this winter.  So I wake up this morning and I decide I have a shower (I'm crazy about showers remember!).  So I get ready for the shower.  Than I hear the shower buzzing and I start to get grumpy.  I keep thinking: Why does mom get all the long showers?  I only got one long shower this year.  And it was on my birthday.  I have to go now. BYE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Sorry I didn't blog yesterday, but you will be hearing a lot more of me soon because I didn't like the writing program Mom gave me for school so she said that if I blogged at least 5 times a week that I wouldn't have to do it. Since I really enjoy blogging I was quite happy with this compromise, seeing as I already blogged about 3 or 4 times a week anyway, so its a go.   Last night I babysat the kids. It was ok, but not uneventful. First dad gave the kids a lecture on how they were supposed to listen to me, and do what I said. It all went ok, the only things worth note are when about 5 minutes after dad and mom had left matthew came up to me and said "Katelyn, you're the worst babysitter I've ever had" and sammy wanting me to sing him songs when he had already ordered me to do every conceivable thing that he MIGHT need to go to sleep. This included putting the wipes away with the diapers, something that doesn't usually get done, but as a babysitter I'm expected to cater to the kids every whim so I did it. But singing was where I was prepared to draw the line. I have a cough so I really have good reason not to want to sing. I told him I was sick. He answered "No katelyn, you're not sick, I'M sick!" I finally succeeded in convincing him that I would sing to him next week when I wasn't sick anymore. Also by the time I'd finished putting him and Matthew to bed the hot dishwater that I'd put in the sink before I put them to bed was cold. Then I ready 2 chapters of cheaper by the dozen to the kids (Dan and Sarah). They thought it was pretty funny, but I don't know, they might have been laughing partly because I had to cough after every sentence. Probably not though. All in all I'm quite glad I got payed 15 dollars for the whole thing.   As for the disgusting bit of the bible for today  I've decided take a story from Judges 4. It is the story of Sisera and Jael. Here is the basic story  The israelites are fighting sisera and his army of 900 iron chariots. He is scared so he runs to the tent of Heber the Kenite, because his king is on good terms with him. Heber isn't home, but his wife Jael runs out and says "Quick, come into my tent. You'll be safe in there" So Sisera goes into her tent. Then she coveres him with a blanket (this was probably a very warm wool blanket, also the guy just came from a battle, and he's been running all the way to Jaels tent so he's HOT and covered in blood and probably other things and he STINKS). He then says to Jael "I'm SO thirsty, bring me some water" But she gave him some milk (I don't know about you, but milk sometimes makes me sleepy, so the milk probably plays a key part in this story) Then he fell asleep. When Jael was sure he was fast asleep she took a (probably very long) tent peg and nail it through his temples and into the ground. Obviously he died.   After the israelites had won the battle deborah and barak sang a great song of praise. I don't know if you people out there who read our blog will find it funny but I did so here they are:   "Most blessed is Jael,         the wife of Heber the Kenite.        May she be blessed above all women who live in tents.      Sisera asked for water,         and Jael gave him milk.     In a bowl fit for kings,         she brought him yogurt.     Then with her left hand she reached for a tent peg,         and with her right hand she reached for the workman's hammer.     She hit Sisera, crushing his head.         She pounded the tent peg through his head, piercing his temples.     He sank, he fell,         he lay dead at her feet.      "From the window Sisera's mother looked out.         Through the window she watched for his return, saying,     `Why is his chariot so long in coming?         Why don't we hear the sound of chariot wheels?'     A reply comes from her wise women,         and she repeats these words to herself:     `They are dividing the captured goods they found--         a woman or two for every man.     There are gorgeous robes for Sisera,         and colorful, beautifully embroidered robes for me.'  Don't be afraid to add your own tune to it.

      Dad is almost finished with the basement.  He disconnected the computer because he says we use it to much.  Mom is going to take us to the library today.  It has been such a long time since she took us to the library on foot. I had just spent most of the day in the math torture chamber an I am glad to be out of it. So I just had French toast for lunch.  Me and Sammy are really in to sumo-wrestling.  We strip down to our diapers and undies and run to each other half naked in the toilet-paper ring and start pushing each other out of the ring.  We are reading Cheaper By the Dozen now. It is really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really funny. Last night Katelyn babysat us.  It was kind of boring but it was really fun because, it was only the kids in the house.  I have a new office.  In the cramped closet near my room.  It took hours of arranging but it is finally done

      I'm very sorry I didn't blog yesterday. I've lost my voice. So now my blog is my voice (kind of). Also the fact that I lost my voice kept me home from church so I have all the more time to blog. Yesterday was my swimming lesson. It was lots of fun until I came into the changeroom and there were about 10 girls hogging the showers, and they didn't even need to be in there. They were yelling and screaming and goofing around, and then one of them ran out of the shower, because she was goofing around, and I took her spot. Then the swimming instructors came and showered, but they used the other showers, and there is only 3 of them, so I had to wait until the first one left before I could steal her shower.   Then at night I went to a hockey game. That was A LOT of fun. The game itself was pretty boring, but I had fun talking to anna (my best friend) and eating frys and also listening to the all the music they played, most of which I knew. They played elevation, which was a lot of fun, because I know all the words, and I looked over at dan a row above me, and he had this HUGE grin plastered all over his face. The only things I didn't like was the fact that Jon Dixon put an ice cube down my back, and I was wearing overalls so I couldn't just stand up and get it out. I had to sit there, for half the 3rd period feeling it proceed down my back into places I'd rather not mention, before it finally finished melting. There is another thing I didn't like, but I have to tell you this part of it first:                                                                                                                           You know in guys fashions how they wear their pants halfway down they're butt, and sometimes they also have loads of rips in them. (I do not know why they do this, its so stupid!) Well anyway there is another guy in my band class, only he's in grade nine, so he wasn't included in my last band blog, anyway he had a rip right in his CROTCH. So he was putting his HAND in and out of it. He is truly the most DISGUSTING person. ANYWAY HE WAS SITTING 2 ROWS IN FRONT OF US.  I definetely didn't like that part. I was trying to think of a good name for him. Anna suggested Mr. Crotch-Rubber. I think that'll be his name from now on.    As for the gross bit of the bible today I've taken Judges 3:15-25 here it is  But when Israel cried out to the LORD for help, the LORD raised up a man to rescue them. His name was Ehud son of Gera, of the tribe of Benjamin, who was left-handed. The Israelites sent Ehud to deliver their tax money to King Eglon of Moab. So Ehud made himself a double-edged dagger that was eighteen inches long, and he strapped it to his right thigh, keeping it hidden under his clothing. He brought the tax money to Eglon, who was very fat. After delivering the payment, Ehud sent home those who had carried the tax money. But when Ehud reached the stone carvings near Gilgal, he turned back. He came to Eglon and said, "I have a secret message for you." So the king commanded his servants to be silent and sent them all out of the room. Ehud walked over to Eglon as he was sitting alone in a cool upstairs room and said, "I have a message for you from God!" As King Eglon rose from his seat, Ehud reached with his left hand, pulled out the dagger strapped to his right thigh, and plunged it into the king's belly. The dagger went so deep that the handle disappeared beneath the king's fat. So Ehud left the dagger in, and the king's bowels emptied. Then Ehud closed and locked the doors and climbed down the latrine and escaped through the sewage access. After Ehud was gone, the king's servants returned and found the doors to the upstairs room locked. They thought he might be using the latrine, so they waited. But when the king didn't come out after a long delay, they became concerned and got a key. And when they opened the door, they found their master dead on the floor.

      I am still somewhat immobile. I asked Marsh for some ice cream and she brought me a bowl that was overflowing. Fortunately Sam joined me in bed and helped me out a bit. He has a little ice cream routine. When he is ready for a bite he says, "I open the door." Then opens his mouth and I shovel the ice cream in. When he is done savoring it he says, "That was tasty." There was so much ice cream that after a while he said, "You eat the rest Dad." I was flabberghasted. Sam was full! A sight never seen before.

I just wanted to bring that up because it has been a long time since you won that contest.  I have something in mind.  So I will email you for your address and then you will probably have the prize in a couple days......  Hass anybody answered that brain-teaser I gave you a couple blogs ago???????  It is a hard question but if you really start to think about it, it turns into a really easy question to answer.  So we just rented a DVD from the video store.  Okay Okay.  I am going to make this paragraph as short as possible.  Yesterday our dad got home from the hospital 4 something I cannot tell u.  He has just finished a shower.  His showers r long. 2 long.  Not 2 mention my showers r long 2. he had 2 have surgery.  now he is done. He is @ home now.  He is not in the bathroom anymore.  He is somewhere else.

      Dad is finally awake. He came back from the hospital yesterday but he was all drugged out. (He was awake but not completely functioning properly)  Its really cloudy. The weather man said that it was supposed to be sunny, but the weather man is wrong. I'm happy to inform you guys that my mood is no longer melancholy, because there is an abundance of food in the house now, and dad is home from the hospital. (In case any one of you were wondering everything I said in my last blog was true, but I wrote it to see how many people would believe it. I think Karen was the only one)   Mom is changing Sams diaper and Sam is complaining because mom won't put a diaper on him yet because he thinks his bum is clean (and it is) because mum is arguing "Well Sam, there is still poo on your balls" This is very funny to listen too and I hope you guys aren't offended by my use of the word balls.   P.s. AIMEE? WHERE ARE YOU AIMEE?????! Have you stopped reading our blog?

      Yes I am ok and still alive. My little sickness was unfortunately misdiagnosed (twice) and so the saga ended (or hopefully has ended) with surgery. I am back home now and in less pain than I have been in this past couple of weeks. Though I do get this nasty fever that comes and goes. In a week or so when my wound has healed I should be as good as new. Not much energy at the moment though so I will sign off.

      I know I've disappointed all you loyal blog readers. No posts since friday, how could I? I am a truly evil person, so evil that aimee hasn't entered anything in the guestbook in ages. I think she has stopped reading our blog. You have to be pretty evil to get someone to stop doing that! I write this with a heavy heart and I send my deepest apologies to anyone who feels they deserve them. I am trying to make this post as melancholy as possible. Dad is in the hospital, and their is no food in the house. (think, think for negative things) um... there is absolutely no way we are going to do the archives thing (which sucks, because I was looking foward to it) and the kids just came back from the park (that was very negative, and it means I have to stop blogging)

      I know that I am biased, but I am very impressed with Katelyn, Dan and Sarah today. As part of their homeschooling we read a portion of the bible and discuss it. It has been a while since we have done this together as Marsha has been the one to do it as of late. I am really quite shocked at their insight tonight. For those of you who do not know, I spend much of my days reading, studying and teaching the bible to students at the university and for myself. I think it is a fantastic - blow your mind - kind of book. In fact it has completely changed my life. I often lament that people are unfamiliar with its contents. The discussion I had tonight with Katelyn, Dan and Sarah went pretty deep rather quickly and stayed there. It was a conversation I could have - and have had - with many adults.  While we were doing this Sam and Matt were on the loose because Marsha was out covering for me at an event because I am still sick. When Katelyn went downstairs after we were done she found Sam eating Marsha's ice cream (made from soy) which is one of the few joys in her life because of her limited diet. She brought him up to me and his hands and face were all the evidence I needed. After punishing him (mercifully) and cleaning him up I spoke with him about the ordeal. I realize now where the confusion comes in for him. I started by asking him why he ate the ice cream. He said amid tears, "Ice cream is SAMMY's!" (caps mean he yells). "No!" I replied firmly. "Ice Cream is mommy's." Sam said, "NO! Ice cream is SAMMY'S! I brought in from car!" It is true that he helps bring in the groceries so of course there in lies his confusion. From now on I will make sure he brings in things less desirable ... and maybe buy him his own ice cream.  Katelyn then made supper for us all. Spaghetti with a meat sauce. It was fantastic. Another reason why I am impressed with her. Now Dan is putting Matthew and Sam to bed. I can hear him telling them stories about SUPER BABY. This is also quite impressive, though I realize I may be out of a fathering job. Marsha even told me that he checked the air in our van tires today.

      I went to band today, which was uneventful except when band ended and we were still playing, and then the grade nine class came in, and we were at a really loud part in the piece and they all went out of the room. I guess they couldn't stand to here us play! :)  I got my hair cut yesterday. As of a couple minutes ago it died, and now I doesn't look like it always does when you come out of the hairdressers. Now I always have to wear it up again. Oh well. It feels wonderful and light. I caught myself practically looking up because all the weight on my head is gone (or roughly a half pound, that's how thick my hair is.) The hairdresser was a type that is unique to Nova Scotia, and she had an accent, and I could just imagine her at her dinner table saying "there was this girl today, and I cut her sisters hair, and I thought it was thick, an' her mom was saying "wait til you see my other daughter" but I didn't believe her and Oh my *gosh her hair..." (It is kind of hard to accurately portray her, but most of the nova scotians will understand I think)  * not really gosh

      Matt is sitting right here and he told me that he used to be a super hero. He retired when he was three. What was his super hero name? SUPER BABY. There was a helicopter with some people dropping bombs. And there a vandal and super baby snuck up on him and tapped him. The vandal did not see anything for quite some time. Super Baby did a double back flip and wacked him in the face. Another job well done. But then the vandal got up. So super baby vomitted on him and that did it.

      AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!  I didn't blog for more than 2 days!  Okay Okay, I am blogging at the library where it is quiet.  Today I had to clean out the van which is a bummer because the van is a absolute pigsty.  Anyway, it is clean now and so that means I won't have to clean it for another 6 months or so,  It looks really nice now, the rubber carpets are in place, the garbage on the floor of the vans is in the garbage, all the bottles and cups and mittens are in their proper place etc...  Time to go now because I have to go home.  :)D

      AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!! I didn't blog yesterday. It was because I was going to blog, but we had to go out, and then I had to go to triple band (which was very good for some reason) and then I didn't really have time to blog because I got back at four and well you get the idea.  I'm going to get my hair cut today. This is a BIG event because I only get my hair cut 2 or 3 times a year. The last time I got my hair cut by a hairdresser was about a year ago, and my last haircut was in September. I'm very drastic about my hair. My ends are atrocious, when they are in my hair too long they turn white. AND I don't get split ends, but the other day I found the first one ever in my hair. Not all my hair turns white just some, so it doesn't look white, but it looks very very unhealthy when you look closely. This is my first hair cut this year.

      Well today I am sick. Amazingly I am getting a lot of work done while in bed. I am fine as long as I don't have to move about too much. Marsha was out with the kids and brought me a Coffee Crisp. It was a sweet gesture. Later Matt joined me in bed and asked for a date. I told him I was sick. Then I remembered the Coffee Crisp. I openned it and gave him a bite and then I took one. He was only half done chewing when he said it was his turn to have another bite. TURNS? HOW DID HE FIGURE WE WERE TAKING TURNS? It was my chocolate bar!! Anyways, we took turns finishing the bar.

       In reference to Mom's blog, I think that taking in the groceries is a fun activity and it always gives me some exersise.  Also I do not hand Sammy groceries, he carefully takes them in himself.  I once tried to get him to carry a big bottle of cranberry juice but he was straining just to get it out of the car.  He finally gave up and took a box of tea bags instead.  Oh and by the way I didn't know Mom hated getting the groceries.  About 30 minutes ago Sammy went through a rage of poops.  He pooped a number of times in the toilet, even though he is still in diapers.  So the day gone by nice, I just suffered the Math torture Chamber.  It was sort of easy.  I tried to listen to music while doing my math but Mom didn't want me to do that.  So I didn't.  About the Subway thing.  When I was 6 years old I was told not to try to drink from the pop taps by a person that worked at Subway.  But when she wasn't looking I dared her to put her head under the taps so that she was in danger of getting pop on her head.  She didn't want to so I showed her that there was nothing to worry about and I put my head under the tap.  Unfortunatly  My head went a little to far and I got sprayed on the head with Coke.  I had a bath after I got home.  I have to teach Sammy that underwear is better than diapers so GoodBye!!!!!  :)D

      Well hello. Last night I babysat, and it was the worst experiance I've ever had babysitting. I won't go into details, because I would just be contradicted but I had to call dad right in the middle of the bible study he was at, and I was really embarrassed, and Dad told me I shouldn't have called and now I feel really bad.   I feel very tired today, but I'm not sure why. I got my normal amount of sleep so...   Today is the first day we go to the library again, and I am kind of exited, kind of ticked off that I have to do school again. Its kind of a mixture between the two.   Lately sam has been potty training. I don't know why he does this, but he keeps saying "I make smoke stack" when he poos. I don't know what he means by this. Does it mean he is obsessed with smokestacks? Is it poo related, or is it a part of his whole life. Does he mean he is going to make a smokestack out of his poo? I don't know. It is one of the greater mysterys.

      While Katelyn & Ron were off skiing on Saturday I had a full day to fill with exciting activities to offset grumpy children who didn't get to go skiing. The highlight of our day was a trip to subway for lunch. This is the best bargain in town, folks. For $13.06 I was able to feed 4 kids a half sub each, leaving them in a blissful state murmuring things like "you are the best mommy in the world". To be honest, I'm not sure Subway really likes us. While Dan & I were ordering I heard the Subway Nazi yell "don't walk on the chairs". I turned around to see Sammy using the chairs as a stepping stone to get to the window ledge. Then, while eating their subs I marveled at how much mess little children could make with just half a sub each to make it with. I bet it took them 15 minutes to wipe down the table and chairs and sweep up the mess on the floor. Subway's distaste for our family started many years ago, perhaps even before all the Pirates were born. On a Subway trip with Grandma, Dan, then 6, took up the dare from Katelyn to put his head under the pop machine for a drank sans cup. Grandma was unaware of the sinister plot going on right under her nose until she heard the Subway Nazi screaming "Get your head out from underneath the pop machine!!"  I was sick today even though it was supposed to be my day off. I had some sort of weird muscle problem where all the muscles around my middle (like above my waste hurt) - both in my back and stomach. After wallowing in self-pity and thinking of possible diagnoses until around 2 pm it suddenly occurred to me that I could ask God to make me feel better. About 15 minutes later I felt well enough to make my weekly hated trip to the grocery store. This was a case of absolute desperation - even the "we'll eat it if there is nothing else" foods had been eaten up. As is our tradition, the kids bring in and put away the groceries. (The thought of this always makes me grin as I pay for the groceries - my part of this hated job is done for yet another week)The older kids do this job willingly but without excitement. Sammy on the other hand delights in taking part in this activity. Dan hands him single items and he brings them in with great fanfare saying things like "Mama, this is frozen raspberries! Put them in the freezer".

      Well, today is the first day of school again. I can't exactly say I'm happy, but during march break sometimes I was bored so I don't really hate school unless it's really really hard. I did a science experiment, which was really chemistry, and had to do with toilet bowl cleaner (because of the hydrocloric acid in it, not because the science experiment was to clean the toilet) and purple red cabbage water (you boil water with red cabbage leaves in it, and it turns blue or purple depending how long you boil it for). then I added the toilet bowl cleaner, and it turned red, even though the toilet bowl cleaner was blue. That is my facinating life.  I'm not nearly as sore as I was yesterday, but I'm still a little bit sore from skiing. I don't really want to think what sking on a bigger hill would be like (the one we went to was very very small). I would be scared out of my wits. Of course I was scared out of my wits at the top of that hill so really either way it doesn't matter because I'm going to fall anyway.   I don't think I have any other news. I'll sign off for now

      Here I come!!! So today is the start of school again and I am really ticked off because it was so fun I would not want it to end.  Math Torture Chamber started off easy then went from fun to boring.  I have so many mathbooks that I will be doing math until I am in grade nine, and then Mom will be ordering another bunch.  I can't wait until I am in grade nine.  Katelyn is buzzing over my head rolling dice and shouting HURRY UP AND BLOG!!!!!!!!  It is driving me nuts!!!!!  Yesterday I was talking to a person at church about waterskiing.  He said we would go waterskiing in May.  I can't wait.  Dad is in his office doing something.  I am blogging in moms office.  My shower day is tomorrow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I can't wait!!!!!!!!!!  Okay.    It is time I leave now,  Sorry for the short blog!!  :(D  P.S.  I am sad because the school has started.

      I have forgotten how fun skiing is. Katelyn did a superb job though she would have you believe different. She is a Nancy Greene/Melanie Turgeon in the making. Helping Katelyn brought back memories of when I was learning how to ski. Struggling to get up with these trees attached to your feet. You feel like a dying fish flapping on a dock hoping that you next voluntary muscle spasm will randomly hurdle you back into the water. The first day is always the toughest, but I voted her the most improved skiier on the hill for the day. She never even fell off the T bar - a must for first timers.  Matthew was glad that I was home today. His low for the day was that I was gone for his bed-time routine on Friday and Saturday so he missed his episodes of "SUPER AMBULANCE DRIVER (SAD) - That's me" stories. So I told him a few tonight to ease his withdrawal. I am afraid that I am going to have to terminate SAD because it is hard to make them exciting. Super Fire Fighter was easier. I am going to have to come up with something better. Why did I ever kill Super Fire Fighter? Never act on impulse - let that be a lesson. Give me some ideas folks.

      Why does it always rain on Sunday afternoons? Consequently I have a small headache, but only a small one, and its definitely helped along by the fact that I am bored. Anyhow I do have some positive news...  Yesterday me and dad went downhill skiing. We went for the whole day, and I must have fell down abut 50 times, even on the bunny hill attempting to do snowplough, but eventually I could make it down the bunny hill, and then I tackled their green circle hill, and by the end of the day I could make it down doing snowplough all the way, and I tried doing the blue square hills too, and I could do it at the end so that I only fell twice, and I could ski across the ski hill to slow myself down, so you could say I improved a lot. Of course I could only do the thing when I only fell twice after they had ploughed it. Before they did it was ice in the middle, which made it very hard to do snowplough. I did a couple spectacular falls, in one I fell head first, slid halfway down the steep part of the hill that I was on, and then spun 180 degrees and sprayed snow everywhere. Also on more than a few occasions my ski came off, and it was a good thing too, because if it hadn't I would have broken my leg. At the end I was very sore, but that is nothing compared to what I am feeling now. Every time I stretch, or change positions I am basically feeling 20 or 30 times what I would normally feel. Even my fingers hurt when I bend them.

      Here is a blog.  Oh and I am so sorry that I couldn't blog last night because Nathan got to stay at our house longer and My bedtime came right after he left.  Anyway it was really fun to have him over because He always has some suggestions of what to do when there is nothing to do.   We went outside for an hour.  Once we only had to stay outside for 2 more minutes we ran all over the place to make the time go by faster.  We had recently been reading Spongebob Squarepants Chapter books.  Although I have seen most of them I love to read them again and again.  I have also been reading Science books and History books but the History books are not as good as the Science.  A couple weeks ago we went to church and after the singing and the prayer we do the children's story which is when every kid there goes to the front of the church and listens to a story.  Well here is a story that one of the people told us.  He was asking us what God does to help us and some of the other kids said some normal things like beating other teams at hockey etc......  Anyway When it was Matthew's turn he said rather loudly: "Canada beating America in the war of 1812"  Everybody in the church cracked up.  You mostly hear laughing after Matthew says anything at the Children's story.  I am really happy right now.  Did you hear me?  HAPPY!!!!!!!!  H-A-P-P-Y!!!!!!  Okay, okay.  I am really happy because Mom said that I could have a shower on Tuesday as well as Friday. That is why I am happy......  I must go now because it is my bedtime.  :)D

      This is Sarah speaking. Today I worked on my reading. I am learning about the sounds "th" (which I already knew) and "ng". In the middle of my work Sammy came up to mom (who was sitting with me) and asked her to draw Patrick. Then he asked me to draw Squidword, SpongeBob and Gary. These are all from a cartoon called SpongeBob SquarePants. Patrick is a silly starfish. He isn't very smart. Squidword is a squid. He is mean to Patrick and SpongeBob because they are too silly and always bother him. Gary is a snail. He has an exercise wheel. Here is the theme song of Sponge Bob  Who lives in a pineapple under the sea? Sponge Bob Square Pants (said excitedly) absorbent and yellow and porous is he Sponge Bob Square Pants (excitedly) If nautical nonsense be something you wish Sponge Bob Square Pants (excitedly) Then drop on the deck and flop like a fish  Chorus SpongeBob Square Pants (repeated ad nauseum until you are out of breath - editor's note)  Yesterday Dan's friend Nathan came over. Mom made us go outside and then when we came in she said we hadn't been outside for 30 minutes. So we had to stay out there for another 30 minutes. It was really boring. I can't even tell you what we did when we were outside because it is too boring to put in the blog. If you read it, it would make you fall asleep. We almost fell asleep when we were out there.   This afternoon Katelyn, Dan & I are going to go the library for a March Break program. We are going to see some snakes, turtles and other reptiles. I am wondering if the snakes are going to be real? Will they be in boxes or will they let them loose in the room? You could just be sitting there and a snake could slither up on your back! That would be scary. I do know that if they let them loose there would be a lot of snake charmers. I think the head librarian Cindy would scream if the snakes were let loose. Kendall librarian would be fine with it. Randy librarian would try to be calm for the kids sake but she would be scared inside. Marlene librarian would probably use the puppets to help her charm the snakes.   Well I have to go now and get ready for the Library.   Yellow

      The first thing I'm going to tell you is that we have someone from newfoundland that checked our blog. We are really getting a lot of traffic. We're just got past 3/4 of the way to 1000 people to visit our blog.  Dan has a friend over, and he was in a commercial (it airs april 1st on atv, he's the little short guy with red hair who says "DAD THE TOILETS OVERFLOWING AGAIN") So we've been teasing him, and pretending he's a movie star, offering him tidbits and fanning him, and joking that we thought he was late because he was purchasing a leather jacket and designer sunglasses, or that his agent just called him on his cell phone etc. Its pretty funny, because dan even tried to pick him up to take him upstairs. They're not doing it too much anymore though because they are playing with the walkie talkies.

      As suggested in our guestbook I told Matt a story tonight about "SUPER GRASSHOPPER - that's me!" The questions came right away. Was this TRUE? How could I be a grasshopper? I had to correct him on that one - I was not JUST any old grasshopper, I was SUPER GRASSHOPPER!! Still he persisted. When I have no answer I just say, "would you like me to get on with the story or not?" That usually does it. So life as a grasshopper was good until I began tiring of leaves and bugs (what do grasshoppers eat anyway). I started to get hungry (this is the short version of the story). I started to crave fried grasshopper. So being a super grasshopper I lit a fire, fried myself and ate myself. I was delicious. Matt was confused, but he did seem to enjoy the twist at the end. Then I told him a couple of stories about "SUPER AMBULANCE DRIVER - that's me!" He seemed pleased that Super Ambulance Driver made it through two stories alive so we can continue the series tomorrow night.  Sam has still not stopped talking.  Marsh and I snuck out tonight to see a movie. I think it was called Spartan. Movie 6/10. Company 10/10. Weather 0/10. Roll up the rim a big fat nothing again but the coffee was good. All in all a pleasant night.

      Well, we have a couple new readers. I checked where all the readers were coming from yesterday, and now we don't only have someone from the university of Illinois, we also have someone from the university of houston. Also we had someone that was using a google page server thing, and ever since they visited us our blog has started to come up on google. Last week you could type in abarbablog, and it wouldn't come up with anything. Now it comes up with everthing, including platinum blonde etc. I'm just wondering who these people are? Would you like to indentify yourself? (I'm not really concerned about the google people, but university of houston? University of Illinois?)

      Looks like my kids are being seen and not heard. No blogs from them today. Only they are being heard here. Something happened to Sam yesterday. He begun talking non-stop at about 4:00pm and has only stopped to sleep. Today he had verbal diarrhea until I put him to bed. It is weird experiencing such sudden changes in your kids. Marsha says he was really happy today. He and Sarah turned the water on in our back yard and it stayed on for two hours. Can't wait to get my water bill!  When I put Matthew to bed last night I killed super fire fighter out of spite because he was making me tell him a story when I was tired. That decision backfired tonight. Fortunately I managed to stall but I now have to create a new true character that he thinks is me. Maybe, super ambulance driver - he likes ambulances. If you have some ideas just put them in the guestbook. He can't read too well so he'll never find out. He was still confused about the fire fighter thing. I wonder when he will figure it out?

      Had a whole day with the pirates and I am beat. They seemed rather rambunctious today. Of course, Marsha does this almost every day so you can imagine what kind of strength she has.  I've been telling Matt bedtime stories about "super fire fighter" and he thinks they are all true. Of course I am super fire fighter. I end all my stories by saving everyone and putting out the fire. Then everyone throws a big party for me and tells me how wonderful I am. But I always say, "Aw, it was nothin' - just doing my job." Tonight I was so tired I asked for a break and of course he would not let me have one. He insisted that I tell him one. So I did. In this one though, I let super fire fighter die to save people in a nuclear sub. This confused him as I was still alive to tell the story. He kept asking me if I was telling the truth. Did super fire fighter really die. I kept insisting that he did in fact die. I ended the story with a celebration party to honor super fire fighter. When the people began chanting, "super fire fighter you're the best" I told Matt that I said, "Aw, it was nothin' - just doing my job." He got really confused. He kept asking questions to try and make sense of how I could be alive and dead at the same time. It was fun to see him frustrated for a change.

      I am so mad at my brother!!!! That song is under copyright and he had no written, or any other permission to put it on the blog. He is being charged a 5 dollar fine, and all you people out there who read it are being charged 1 dollar (because it isn't really your fault) He also missed a huge part of the song. I'll post the rest later for your benefit. (you don't really have to pay, but Dan does.)  The other day I went to a sleepover and we stayed up till 2, and I was really tired. Now I'm ok, because it was Friday-Saturday, and now its Monday. But I was SO tired on Saturday. I went to bed at 8:00.  Its moms day off, which means that I have to clean the bathrooms, and clean my room and put away my laundry. And they say that today is the first day of march break.  Last night I fixed my flute using primitive materials, a bottle of nail polish and one of my fingernails. The lady at music stop told me to used nail polish, and I was supposed to use a fine screwdriver to get the problem screw out, but I just used my nail, and now the screw doesn't unscrew itself and my key seals like its supposed to. Yay.

      Okay, Okay, Okay. I am feeling very nice.  It is March break and it is a monday!  You must know why I call myself a beaver sometimes. The answer is  A) My 2 front teeth are very big and long.  B) I have a tail like a beaver.  C) I love chewing on sticks  Answer: A.  My teeth are so long that nobody can hide their snickering.  Katelyn started singing Oh beaverda, which is a parody of Oh Canada.  Here it goes  Oh beaverda Our home and native animal true patriot love  and all our teeth command God keep our teeth glorius and long  Oh beaverda we stand on guard for teeth Oh beaverda we stand on guard for teeth!

      So my dear wife cannot think of an embarrassing story of me. Well the one I remember most involved her and her friend Mary. It was a practical joke and I have to admit they got me GOOD. For those of you who do not know me I appear quite confident (or I used to before trying to raise kids anyway). I also have this bad habit of picking up facts or making connections and never really checking them out. These two things combined can be disastrous if I am dead wrong about something but feel confident. So here's the story ...  Scott's sister (who Marsha mentions below) was pregnant with twins. Somewhere I picked up incorrectly that diabetes is a problem for kids who are twins. So when Marsha told me that Scott's sister was diagnosed with twins I expressed some concern over the diabetes thing. Marsha had never heard of this and questioned me about it in depth to which I am sure I had some fine sounding argument. I think we even made a bet, but never really checked it out. Several weeks later we were visiting her friend Mary who happens to be a nurse and also knows Scott. At some point the conversation moved seamlessly to Scott's sister and Marsha casually mentioned that she was having twins. Mary looked concerned and said that she hopes the kids turn out ok because there is a high risk of diabetes. I looked at Marsha. She looked at me in shock. Yes - I was right!! I began this little dance I do when I am right. It's my I am right dance. Unfortunately I did not even make it to my main moves before I realized I'D BEEN HAD because Marsha and Mary were rolling on the floor in laughter. I was wrong. Dead wrong. And dead embarrassed.

      Ahhh ... I knew it had to come out about my embarassing lack of understanding of physics (which of course I confessed to my faithful blog readers at least a month ago. The funny thing is I felt very guilty about this incident. And I'm pretty sure Kathy continues to blame me as I had not held on tight enough to the piece of glass. It was a few years later that I felt redeemed as I heard my friend Scott (who had been around at the time of the incident) tell Ron who I had just started dating. (Imagine two grown men in ratty t-shirts and jeans literally rolling on the ground in laughter - you get the picture.) I had never understood why Scott thought this was so funny & had been too ashamed of the incident to ask. But, alas, they explained the laws of physics to me in laymen's terms that day which was very enlightening and also absolved me of all feelings of guilt.   Today we are having our 'family day' which we try to do on Saturdays - kind of a day to rest which we find always worthwhile & rejuvenating - and we miss it if we have to skip it for some reason. So the kids watched (& thoroughly enjoyed) Gilligan's Island on DVD. We drank a lot of tea and sat around talking and reading to the kids and snuggling with them. Tonight for dinner I made burgers, fries and salad - every kids dream. Sammy gets very excited about it but can't actually figure out the bun thing so in the end I had to cut up his burger in little pieces. Now Ron is making sea trout and salad for us and then we are going to watch a movie. It is such a nice break from the running around life of the other 6 days. I am thinking and thinking of what embarrassing story to tell about Ron but am coming up blank. One of the problems is that Ron doesn't really get embarrassed easily. When Danny was 3 we were swimming at a little outdoor wading pool that had lifeguards. We went there everyday in the summer that we could so we were on a first-name basis with the guards. Danny came to me one day with a grin on his face and proudly told me, "I pooped in the pool". After visually confirming the story, I told the lifeguards, the pool was evacuated, the poo removed (with much eweing from the lifeguard) and the water re-chlorinated. This is a 30 minute procedure. I was mortified and stayed away from the pool for at least 2 days. Of course, when I told Ron this story he said that wouldn't embarrass him at all.  The only good thing about this incident is that a) it is funny to tell and b) it reminds me of a bad 80s movie starring Bill Murray (maybe called Meatballs) where they find a poo at the bottom of the pool and as the lifeguard goes down to investigate they play the Jaws themesong. It turns out to be a Mr. Big chocolate bar and the lifeguard brings it to the surface and eats it (grossing out everyone watching who think it is a poo). Well must go eat my gourmet supper. I love it when Ron (or anybody really) cooks supper for me. Cheers

      Marsha promised Melanie an embarrassing story ... so I thought I would oblige by telling one about Marsha. I am sure she will reciprocate so I do not feel too bad.  The one memory that stands out to me happened before we got married. Marsha and a friend Kathy were driving down the 400 not too far from Toronto (in Kathy's car). As they were moving at about 120 km/h it started to rain which was a problem because the sun roof was not on (it was one of those removable ones). So they decided to put it on. Did I mention that the car was moving at 120 km/h? Now for those of you who missed Hurricane Juan, 120 km/h winds is about what caused all the damage in and around Halifax. So you can imagine what happened when they stuck the glass sun roof through the hole out into the open air. Fortunately no one got hurt as the glass hurdled through the air and crashed on the highway behind them. Marsha asserts that this was a totally understandable error in judgment and not really an embarrassing story as she was never good at physics. I just think it is a riot. I'm glad I wasn't in the car to stop them.

      I got up early this morning because I have lots to do for the day. Matt was already up to greet me in the bathroom. He looked in the tub and there was what looked like a toxic spill of something. He said, "Dad! We have a problem!!" and was pointing at the goo in the tub. It turns out the mess was shampoo that I can only guess was Sam's handiwork. Later Matt came in my office with his hair all spiked. I asked him what he did to his hair and he said, "It's so bullies won't get us." He did look frightening - well frightingly cute! I took a few pictures which I will post shortly.  Sam waltzed in later with his cowboy swagger. He said, "Dad, can you change my diaper?" I felt horrible. There seems to be a lot of alarms going off lately. I even got an e-mail from a concerned fan that said, "I think Dan should be allowed more than one shower a week!!!"

      Welcome to another wonderful day in the abarbanel household.  I'll start as soon as I woke up today.  I opened my eyes and it was 8:59. Normally that wouldn't be a problem, but today is friday, and on friday I have band at 9:10, and it takes me 20 minutes to walk there and well you get the picture. At least I have to take my flute in and almost nobody would be there because they would all be in florida tanning on a sunny beach already, but still I was mad because my alarm didn't work because the power went out yesterday, and I set my alarm to go off, but it was reset so it didn't work. I didn't go.  Dan is very happy right now, because it is his weekly shower day. But this morning he was in a grouchy mood. Mom had thrown out all his pants except for one pair (dark blue filthy trackpants) because none of them actually fit them. Everytime he bent over his fly came down. This has been going on for months. Anyway dan was walking around slamming things, and being in an otherwise grouchy mood. Its kind of comical though because his pants have been too small for him for at least a month, and he never sounded the alarm. So now he is stuck with a filthy pair of trackpants. I wonder what he will wear when we go to the museum of natural history this afternoon...

      Alright here I am.   I'm at the library, and its raining outside but mom is going to pick us up. Here are my news items.  1. I have a headache  2. Its because it is cloudy  3. Yesterday was opposite sex day at my school  4. My flute is broken  Here are the articles  1. My headache. I usually get headaches when it is cloudy outside and I am inside. I don't know why this happens, but it does and its very annoying.  2. see #1  3. This was very funny. Despite the awful name all it meant was that everyone had to dress up as the opposite sex. One of the girls had these pants on, and it was a very good thing that she had something underneath them because she had to walk with her legs as far apart as possible to keep the up. Even so they fell down. Not everyone dressed up so I didn't feel out of place. The guys were disturbing in their dress. they must have said to their moms "Ok mom, give me all the clothes you haven't worn in ten years." One of them wore this mildewey looking ugly blue hawaiian skirt, and wore a bra, and he stuffed it with paper towel. It was very disturbing to look at the guys dressed up as girls. The girls dressed up as guys were really funny though.  4. MY FLUTE IS BROKEN!!!!!!!!!!!!! The F# (that kinda looks like a sharp) screw keeps unscrewing so the key won't seal, and so the note sounds airy. I have to take it in to get repaired. I think they are going to have to put a new screw in.   Does anyone know of an emoticon for headache??

      Vroommm. Another blog taking off. It was a deadly day in Abarbaville. Tax time - need I say more?  I was thinking that one day we can take all this blogging that we are doing and turn it into a blook. We could even include a problog and an epiblog. I wonder if it would catch on?  There is a buzz around the university about Mel Gibson's "The Passion of the Christ". I sat at a table today that was promoting a discussion which took place this evening. I found it interesting how people either loved it or hated it with not too much in between. Some people were even hostile. A few Jewish people came up and asked me why I would promote discussion about such a violent anti-semetic film. I replied that I did not find it any more violent than "Lord of the Rings" though I conceded that it was violence of a different sort. Then they asked me if I thought it was anti-semetic. I told them that I was Jewish and that I thought it was a reasonable rendition of a historical story and not anti-semetic at all. To which they just stared at me in disbelief and said, "I don't get it!" What they did not get is why a Jew would go see it, why a Jew could think it was good and why a Jew would promote discussion about it. It was weird. I don't get what they don't get. It was like Jewish peer pressure to hate something because that's what Jews are supposed to hate. Of course they had not seen it. I wouldn't mind it if someone watched it and genuinely hated it - at least it would be their own opinion and not someone elses.

      Choo-Choo there is a blog arriving at the station. I have had a pretty good day so I will blog.  I had to babysit the kids today while dad was in his office doing some work and Mom was at the store.  We had Crumpets with Jam for lunch and I think I have a liking for Crumpets.  I also had a cup of tea.  Okay Okay lets not get into the English stuff too much.  Anyway the afternoon was boring, infact so boring that I curled up on the floor of the basement and started to fall asleep.  Then after that I played on the computer.  Matt has a liking with me playing some games on the Internet so I played on the Internet a bit to.  We just rented Jumangi and Snow Dogs.  The kids (including me) are watching them alot and we still havn't watched Snow dogs yet.  Do you guys have any clue about my question?????????  Remember sign the guestbook if you think you have the correct answer!!!!!!!!  Sarah is over at her friends house and the kids are in bed and Dad is at work so that leaves me Mom and Katelyn.  Sometime in March break I will go over to my friends house.  I already called him so now probably for sure I will see him this fornight, (2 weeks).  So now I have decided not to do ~D anymore but I will do :(D if I am sad and :)D if I am happy!  :)D

      I just have a quick little note.   I was reading our site stats, and they track all the servers that you guys check our blog from, and one person is checking from chicago. I'm pretty sure we don't know anyone in chicago, so it is a sign that our blog is gaining in popularity. Of course there is a chance that one of our canadian friends is in the university of chicago, but who would be studying there??? Do you want to identify yourself??

      So sorry there was no blog from me yesterday.   Anyway here is all of my news.  1. Today is wednesday  2. Tomorrow is Thursday  3. The next day is friday  4. We didn't get any mail today  5. I have to go to school  6. There was a snowplough and he shaved the snowbanks all the way to the curb  7. I didn't wake up until 10 this morning  Ok i'll study each of those in depth  1. I can't really say much about this one. On wednesdays I don't go to the library to study like I normally do.   2. I can't really say much about this one either, on thursdays I do go to the library to study geography with all the reference materials they have there. I used to do a writing program but it was stupid and dan told mom that it was stupid so now I have to write in the blog 5 times a week so I don't have to do that stupid book  3. Again, not much that can be said. I go to school really early on fridar (like I have to get going at 8:50, way too early for me =) Then I go to the library, and then I come home.   4. Ah yes, we didn't get any mail today. We watched the mail man go by, and thought maybe he had to go to his truck to get more mail, or he had a big heavy parcel for us etc. etc.  5. I have to go to school today for triple band, which goes from draining to very draining depending on various factors, like how much we get done (no breath, very draining) or how much trouble we have (very draining, because its very annoying) Right in the middle is the best.  6. The snowplough. Ever since the GARGANTUAN storm we had, we have had snowbanks. Not just any snowbanks though. Snowbanks that extended close to 2 or 3 feet from the curb. The day after the storm our neighbours were telling us to not shovel the part that was on the road because the ploughs would come and get it soon. The next day they were out like the rest of us. Then today, 11 days until spring it finally came. AND DEPOSITIED HUGE BOULDERS OF SNOW ON THEIR DRIVEWAY. Me and mom thought this was very funny, and kind of not really contemplated taking all the boulders in the other people from that side of the streets driveway and piling them onto mike and donnas. Then the plow came and plowed it out though, so even play ideas were crushed.  7. I didn't wake up until 10 this morning. I don't know why, but everytime I sleep in, so like every day almost, my inner clock or SOMETHING says ok katelyn its ten o'clock, you can't sleep any more. Sometimes I get up before that like at 9:30, but I NEVER sleep past 10. The first time I open my eyes is not at 10:03, its at 10:00, or sometimes 9:59 or 10:01. Very weird.

      OK all you Abarbablog fans out there. I am going to set up a section on our blog just so that we can keep track of you all. Can you e-mail me a picture of yourself and a little write-up that we may or may not embellish to our liking. When I get a few I will go to work.

      So Mom and and the 3 younger kids are at the library for a program and I am stuck in the boring life with Katelyn.  I just recently got some recordable tapes but I need a microphone for the recording.  My stereo has got a recording button but not a microphone, which is pretty stupid.  Anyway mom has a stereo with a mic but the cassete is broken so if I try to record anything, the tempo of the sound will go really high and make it to fast to understand.  Anyway I am still thinking of the prize for Leah, although I haven't found anything yet.  Dad suggested a pair of underwear but that wouldn't be fun.  A pair of underwear just sits down and wait for somebody to wear it.  I have got some things in mind but I have to narrow it out.  Yesterday Katelyn babysat us.  She said we all were pretty good which was nice.  Katelyn's friend recorded a cd with parodys.  They were all supposed to be cats singing.  The Album was called CATZ AUDIO.  Katelyn played it for us and that was pretty fun.  Anyway how about a quick contest eh?  Okay the prize for the correct answer is rights to stump anybody you want with this question.  Here goes.  There were 2 trains and 1 track.  On train was going 54 Km. a hour and the other train was going at 46 Km. a hour.  There was a bird going at 10 Km. a hour going from one train to the other.  There were 100 Km. of track between the 2 trains.  Here is the question.  How many Km. does the bird fly before getting crushed between the 2 trains?  Rules:  If you recieve any help from Abarbablog members you will be disqualafied.  Sign the guestbook if you think you have the answer.  Anyway read the details very carefully because this is a very braintwisting question.  Goodbye!  ~D

      I just read Platinum's blog about her dad and it reminded me of some stuff. I don't remember playing with my dad except on one occasion. On another occasion I noticed that he was outside playing in the snow with my siblings and I rushed to get my stuff on, but by the time I made it outside I caught only the tail end. Then he got up and went in. I also don't remember my dad putting me to bed or talking to me. I was mostly scared of him. I say this not as a critisism - now that I am older I understand the reason why he was the way he was - but I feel like I do not know what my kids are experiencing because, even though they tease me about being boring, I do play with them and keep the lines of communication very open. I only scare them once in a while for kicks. It is a strange thing to raise your kids is such a different way than you were raised that you cannot even relate to what they are experiencing. BUT I know it is good, so if there are any dads or would-be dads out there reading this - spend lots of time with your kids. It's worth the exhaustion!!  The other thing it made me think of was the time Marsha and I and the kids were all invited to an Island on Cape-Breton Island by some friends of ours here in Halifax. Our homeschooling at the time revolved largely around Pirates. So Marsha and I packed some candy treasure in our bags without the kids knowing. When we arrived on the Island we tossed a flag with the jolly roger into some prominent bushed by the water where the kids were sure to find it. Sure enough they found it and knew immediately what it meant. There were pirates in them waters!! We hoisted the flag and spent the rest of they day talking about the danger we might be in. The next day we planted a bottle with a treasure map on the beach which the kids also found. The map led to three smaller maps that needed to be combined in order to find the buried treasure. It took the whole day for them to find the X. The treasure chest was full of gold-coin chocolates and other treats which they devoured EVEN THOUGH they knew for certain the pirates would be coming after them. They so fell for this that it was the topic of many conversations for years afterwards. I would come home from work and casually drop something like, "I saw some men down by the waterfront who I am sure were pirates." This would create a level of unease and talk about how to protect yourself if the pirates found out it was us who stole their treasure. Traps were laid about the house just in case. When we finally told them the truth they could hardly believe it. It was one of the most fun things we have ever done with the kids.

      This is Matt. About Deep Sea Chicken's toys. We are going to have these little video cameras that are not breakable and we are going to have remote controlled cars. But if you see a person dressing with your video camera the screen will go black and when the person stops dressing the screen will come back on - because it is rude to see people dressing. we will write about more toys in the blog when we figure them out.  At bedtime my dad tells me stories of when he was the SUPER FIRE FIGHTER. I don't want to write too much about him because I am getting a little bored. I like the stories because the SUPER FIRE FIGHTER always wins sometimes.

      This is Sarah. Today we has subs for lunch. My dad came home six days ago and he brang home presents for us - all books. Mine is "The Legend of Spud Murphy". Dan, Matt and Katelyn got "Horrible Histories" and "Horrible Science" books. Sam got "Builder Bill". Sammy is a big fan of Bob the Builder and so he thought that Builder Bill was Bob. I have my own room now. I used to have my keys but my mom asked to borrow them and I can't find them now. In the back yard there is a tree near the fence. we take a rope and tie it to the tree. Then we sit in it like a swing and lower ourselves down using the other side of the rope. There is another thing we do with the rope. There is ice near the tree and we take both sides of the rope and pull. It slides us past the tree. Sometimes we take a toboggan and put it under us.  Dan only takes one shower a week. It's on Sunday. On Saturday he smells like a swamp.

      There seems to be a lot of interest in Dan's showering habits lately. I do believe, though I stand to be corrected, that despite only SHOWERING once a week he does take the occasional BATH as a supplement. When you have fives kids, and I would recommend it, it becomes hard to keep up with every detail that seems easy when you are single. Not only do you have to brush your own teeth, shower, do laundry, buy clothes, eat, drink ... you also have to make sure it happens for five other people. So it is understandable that sometimes certain things get forgotten until it sets off an alarm. Dan only showering once a week as Melanie correctly points out has not yet set off the stinky alarm (or the disease alarm for that matter). As a result we do not worry too much about it (although it seems to have set off the "social norm being broken" alarm and as a result we may now have to address it). Three other notable things that are sometimes forgotten are:  Sam's diapers. The alarm usually goes off if the smell is particularly rancid or if he sits on your knee and the oversatured - well, you get the picture. I feel like a terrible parent when the alarm comes in the form of his cowboy swagger which consists of him attempting to walk with his legs as far apart from each other as possible - forced to do this because he develops a rash that really hurts.  Clothes. In fact the alarm went off this week for poor Dan. Marsha saw him walking in his jeans and noticed that they were particularly tight. Dan did not seem to mind at all that it was impossible for him even to do up his fly. They will be going out this afternoon to see if they can remedy the situation.  Food in the van. I once found a dried peach that I calculated had been in the van for over a year. It was placed in a back seat compartment by one of the kids. The alarm came in the form of an army of fruitflies that would attack me whenever I got in to drive. It made great compost so not all was lost.

      Hello!  Sorry I didn't blog saturday or sunday, was too busy (and on sunday actually too bored, you know the feeling when you are so bored you don't feel like doing anything?) Anyway.  The other day I was looking for mom in the house and I couldn't find her. I looked in her room, in her office, in dads office, in every room upstairs. Then I thouroughly searched the main level. SHe wasn't there either. So I went downstairs. She wasn't in the computer room. I thought she must have gone out on an errand. Maybe to the video store. Just in case though I opened my sisters door. If you don't already know, my room is after sarahs, so I have to walk through hers to get to mine. Thats funny, my light was on. I thought I had turned it off, but sometimes I forget. I opened my door. There was mom. She was lying on my bed, with her shoes on, and had rearranged all my stuff so as to accomodate herself. She was talking on MY phone surrounded by MY stuff, which I hadn't cleaned up because I was in the middle of something when it was time for supper, acting completely at home in MY room. I was SO mad. I ordered her out. She said "well there was nowhere else private, but if you bring me a portable phone I'll go somewhere else." So then I took her the portable, and she went into sarahs room. I thought since she and answered the phone upstairs "Well why didn't you get the portable from the cradle and go into sarahs room in the first place????????!!!!!!!"

So Dad told me the story about the aardvark and that Dad thought he was in England (read blog below for details).  So Mom went somewhere and I did my math all by myself.  And I only made 2 mistakes.  So anyway it is lunchtime so Goodbye!  ~D

      Something very bizzare happened last night. But before I tell you that story, I need to tell you this one:  My darling wife has a peculiar habit of waking up at random times on random nights in an utter panic. She sits up suddenly from a sound sleep and her movement alone is enough to wake up the neighborhood. Then she yells different things, but the most common of which is, "What! What! What!" This behavior would be considered normal if there had been an earthquake in the middle of the night that woke her up. However, this happens for no apparent reason. When she is done, she falls back into sleeping position and resumes a cozy night of zzzzs. At first it used to freak me out and it would take me hours to fall asleep again. Now that I am used to it, I just turn over and tell her to go back to sleep. Marsha conveniently never remembers these incidents by the morning.  Last night I woke up only to be staring at her face - which was no more than an inch away from mine - hovering above me like a full moon. She said nothing. I, for the life of me, could not figure out who she was. After making eye contact for a minute she lay back down and went to sleep. I, on the other hand, knew that I was in England somewhere but I could not recognize anything about the room I was in. Finally, completely perplexed, I said, "Where am I?" She replied helpfully, "I don't know." Which reminded me that there was this strange moon-faced person lying beside me. I tried again, "Who are you?" and came the reply, "I don't know." It was at this point that I realized that I did not even know who I was. It was a strange feeling. So I had to ask, "Who am I?" Helpful as always she said, "I don't know." So I gave up and went to sleep.  When I woke up this morning I remembered that this had happened and asked her about it. This time she remembered. The reason she was staring at me in the first place was that she thought I was an aardvark. I can't imagine what would have happened if she had panicked. What would be the crime for killing an aardvark that turns out to be your husband?

      Sarah asked me today if we were all prostitutes. I find it quite curious how words can get associated incorrectly for kids. Marsha was to have an operation when she was a kid and was told that the doctors would use instruments. As a result she imagined the doctors holding trombones, clarinets and the like standing over her sleeping body ready to cut her open. I asked Sarah what a prostitute was. It turns out that it is "someone who prays". So I told her that we were. I can't wait to hear what goes on in her Sunday school class this week!  Actually I told her that we were not prostitutes because a prostitute is someone who has hm-hm with someone else for money. Hm-Hm has become code around here to ward off any unwanted questions from Matthew and Sam. There was a look of shock and horror on Sarah's face when she understood what it was.  Matthew has wondered how baby's are made and we told him the same story that we told the other kids at his age. The mom has a special pocket and the dad has some special seeds. When they want a baby the dad puts some of his seeds in the mom's special pocket. This was sufficient to keep all the other kids at bay for several years, but not Matthew. He spent the next several weeks trying to guess where I hide my seeds and where mom's special pocket was. In some ways I can't wait to tell him just to see his reaction. When we finally told Katelyn and Dan they were incredulous and thought we were lying. They said things like, "That's disgusting!" Eventually they realized we were telling the truth but I could tell that they wished we were really lying. It made me realize just how peculiar hm-hm is.

      Ok, here I am again  Last night, just as we planned we had curried chicken for supper, and then we watched a movie. We watched School of Rock. It was very very very very funny. I'd recomend it to anyone, only be advised that there is a lot of swearing in it. It is about a guy who is a rock star (sorta) only he gets kicked out of his band and so his roomate is a substitute teacher and someone calls to give him a job, and dewey (the rock star) pretends he is the roomate and takes the job because he has to pay the rent. So he teaches a class of 5th graders rock, because he sees them is music class, and then all the parents find out that their children aren't learning anything. Meanwhile the kids hare having the best time they ever had... Very good funny movie  Then today, dad said he would blog about this, so I want to make sure you get the COMPLETE truth. When I was cooking bacon on the frying pan today, dad came inside and put snow down my back. So then I went outside to get some snow and we wresled for about a minute before I got it down his back. He told me it was a very disrespectful way to treat your father. I ask you blog readers, Is that boring or what? I mean to do abusive stuff like that to his kids, and then try to not let them avenge his actions. =)

      Hello - I'm back. Well ... most of me. I think that Jet lag means that parts of you are still on the way even after other parts arrive on time. My appetite, for instance, is still in England. I am hungry at odd hours. My liver, on the other hand, is here with me - I know that because it is enlarged to the point that I can feel it. I figure that British people consume about 30 times more alcohol than I do (that is a conservative estimate - probably more like 50 times). Alcohol in Britain is like coffee here.  As usual it was great to see everyone again and I am pretty sure that they are all happy to see me too. It sounds like they all had a blast while I was away. I saw Katelyn when I got home last night at 11:00pm. Matt and Sam where the first two to greet me this morning - snuggling up beside me in bed. Sarah came in next and we read a whole book together. By the time Dan made it I fell asleep again. I finally dragged myself out of bed just before noon.  I think the kids have plans for me to make a deluxe supper tonight and then watch a movie together. I, on the other hand, hope to make it past 7:00pm without crashing.

      Hello again!  Well here I am to tell you about band.  It was pretty normal, and usually we have double band but today we had single band and then the grade nines had to practice a piece they are playing, and since I had to stay anyways I got to play with the grade nines. I couldn't really see why they were having so much trouble with the piece, but it was alright, even though I was kind of embarrassed because i'm in grade seven and technically not supossed to be there. Height wasn't a factor their though. One of the girls can't have passed 5 feet, and she is so skinny that I could probably wrap both hands around the skinniest part of her torso. It's very popular to be skinny nowadays, but she is too skinny, and it is unattractive skinnyness. I'm not super skinny, but I'm sure my weight is healthier than the cultural ideal. Anyway so yeah it was pretty good and I came out unscathed.

      Well hello,  This morning, as soon as I was done everything I needed to do, I went upstairs to see dad. As soon as I got into his room, Dan said "Hey Katelyn, did you see my blog?" "What blog, the one you wrote yesterday?" was my answer. "No the one I wrote this morning, I wrote it at 4:06. Whats the earliest blog you've written Kate?" I can't say I can compete with four o'clock in the morning, but Dan has almost certainly not bested me in how late I have blogged. Anyway Dad got me dan and matt 10 horrible history and horrible science books (to share, not ten each) and he got sam a book called builder bill, and sarah a book by Eoin Colfer (Grrrrrrr) but i'm not complaining.   Now mom and dad have kicked us all out, and so i'm blogging. I'm going to have band today... You know what that means. I have to go now, I hope this blog will satisfy yours (and my parents!!!) standards.

      Aww Man!  I was asleep when Dad came back and went to bed.  I am blogging at 4:06 in the morning.  I woke up and really had to go to the lavatory so I went and had bad Diareah.  So while I was emptying my bowels I was thinking of what to do when I saw Dad. I decided that when I saw him I would hug him so tightly that blood would come out of his mouth.  I am just making a miniture blog because I should be asleep right now  ~D

      Yay, daddy's coming home tonight. I can't wait.  Anyway I will start with the beginning of the day. In the morning we went to the library and studied in the morning, because mom and the younger kids were all at a library program (that I used to volunteer at, but then the library system decided they didn't want any volunteers anymore and randys boss got really mad, and they think i'm a terrorist (not really, but i'm still not allowed to volunteer) etc. etc.) I really miss doing that, but there isn't really anything I can do about it so... Anyway we studied, and then we went downstairs to the end of the program while everyone was starting to leave, where mom was making outrageous claims that "I baby sit sometimes, but we always try to do as much as we can, and we only go out for 2 hours."  to a friend of hers. There were three things wrong with that. I baby sit actually quite a lot, and Mom and Dad are usually out for significantly more than 2 hours (like maybe 3 or 4 hours) and usually, unless it is the kids bed times before they leave (not very often) I do all the work. Her friend remarked "Yeah, its harder when you have to put the kids to bed and stuff, we've never hired anyone under sixteen" I was severly indignant, and couldn't help protesting "Actually I do put the kids to bed." My mother I think has serious exaderation issues.  Anyway then we went home and had lunch, and then we got to watch princess of theives, and then we made pillowcases. We coloured them with different designs, or wrote stuff on them. Mom really likes mine, but I'm not finished it yet.  Anyway I'll sign off now, hope this was long enough for you!

      Last night I was sleeping in Mom's room and I farted so bad that I ran out of the room and into the bathroom, spun around twice and prayed to Jesus that, that would not happen again.  Anyway for today I have alot to tell.  We went to the library this morning and did our work.  Then we went downstairs to the main level of the library and helped with the toddlers program that Randy the librarian was hosting.  After going home we watched a movie on the computer, and then decorated our very own pillowcases.  Dad is coming home tonight so the house is Spic and Span.  I am blogging in Mom's office.  I LOVE THE KEYBOARD!!!!!!!!!!!  I am preaty sure that I will be asleep by the time Dad gets back but I will try to stay awake.  It is my bedtime but I have decided to make this blog longer as much as possible.   Mom just opened the door so fast and swiftly that I jumped right out of my clothes and I had to put them back on with mom staring at my paralized.  Dad still hasn't put the smoke alarm in yet which is good even for me.  Sometimes I am on the computer and the smoke alarm goes off because of Mom taking a shower.  The smoke alarms are connected so when one goes off so does the other.  I absolutely can't wait till Dad gets back because he always brings treats for us.  His treats probably will be interesting because he went to England and not Vancouver or Ottawa or Winnipeg.  Anyway I will have to let you blog readers go so GOODBYE!!!!!!!!!!  ~D

      Now that it is my first March blog I think I would like to see how the contest is doing.  Melanie have you got the answer yet?  I don't think that any of you would want to Sumo-Wrestle with us.  So the prize can be different.  If you want a prize other than to Sumo-Wrestle, then just e-mail me and I will see what I can do the make the prize more usual.  So I spent a couple hours in the math torture chamber struggling over Area and Peremiter when finnaly it is done.  Tomorrow I will do the final review and then I will be done.  I was so bored I was yawning and tearing.  It was really funny about the "fetal" inceddent.  Katelyn is needing to do something on the computer so I will leave her with the computer  Later! ~D

      I am ticked off. I wasn't ticked off when I woke up this morning, but I am now. Here's why:  I woke myself up at 7:30 this morning (about 45 minutes from when I usually wake up) so I could actually get to band on time. I had mistakenly put a bunch of kleenex in the pockets of one of my pants and then washed them, and so there was fragmented kleenex all over my otherwise clean laundry. So anyway, I wake myself up early, and brush my teeth, brush my hair, and then spend 5 minutes trying to find something to wear with a minimal amount of kleenex fragments, and then shaking it out. So anyway, I'm almost ready for school, and so I go upstairs, and the only thing I can smell is burnt toast. I think Oh GREAT I'm going to smell like burnt toast again. (Once I burnt my toast 3 times in one morning, and I went to band, and the girl sitting next do me says "I smell toast"). I make myself a peanut butter and jam sandwich for breakfast. So far my general mood of happiness has not been affected by my snotty no more laundry, or the burnt toast. Then I go upstairs, and tell mom I'm leaving. I put on a fleece, because I thought that even though the high today is supposed to be 23 degrees Celcius it is usually cool in the morning. I was right. It was only about 7 degrees Celcius. I was applauding myself for planning so well, and so I walked down to the school. I walked in right in the middle of O Canada, as I sometimes do in the morning, so I just stood there and waited through it, and then I listened to the announcements. About halfway through the announcements, the secretary who had no idea that I was there, said Band is canceled for all grades today. So I just turned around and walked out. This has happened a fair number of times, and I'm always ticked off when it happens, but I wasn't really that ticked off because it was a nice sunny day outside. Little did I know that in the 5 minutes that I had been in there the temperature had gone up about 10 degrees. And I was wearing my fleece. And its a twenty minute walk. And Its ALL uphill. Lets just say that by the time I got home parts of my shirt were soaked through, and I was VERY ticked off. AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRGH

      Last night I broke down and went out and bought a strawberry cheese cake. It is delicious. I left a large portion in the fridge overnight. I know that the kids wake up in the morning and raid the fridge so I stuck it way at the back. Early this morning Matt woke me up and asked me if he could have some. I was surprised that he asked. Anyway I told him no, and to be sure to put it back. I heard him go downstairs and then I heard a blood curdling scream from Sam, who I assumed had already begun eating it and was being disrupted by Matt who was probably wrestling it away from him. To avoid loosing my cheese cake I got up and went downstairs to rescue it from Sam's clutches before it ended up on the floor. When I got there the cake was in the fridge and intact - phew! But Sam was on the floor crying. I asked Matt what happened and he said, "I had to punish Sam. Well actually I didn't punish him. I pushed him and the floor punished him."

      ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGH!!!!!!!!!!  I HATE IT WHEM MOM AND KATELYN WATCH ER!!!!!  First of all, Katelyn's bedtime is 9:00 and She and Mom stay up till ten.  My bedtime is 8:45 and I have to go to bed at that time.  It's not FAIR!  I am like the only one in this family that isn't having a good time.  NOTHING good has happened to me since Sunday.  I am an a really bad mood.  I was going out side when Mom told me I had to write a blog so that means I have to:( I just took a motor apart and got to see the insides.  I couldn't get it out because the magnet was to strong but finally I managed to get the magnet out.  It was really cool because I could trick matt into thinking that the nail on the table was moving by itself, but I was manouvering it from under the table.  Then at the last minute I dropped the magnet and it broke in half.    AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!  I can see my blood vessels through my skin.  I NEED SOME FRESH AIR!!!!!  I have to go now!  :(D  P.S. I am in a happy mood!  :)D

      Ok I'm sorry. I wrote a huge blog yesterday, but something went wrong and it deleted it and so I'm really ticked off. But anyway...  ITS SUNNY!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And the highest temperature is 10 c(how do you do the little o thing). And tomorrow its going to be you guessed it  SUNNY AGAIN. And this time the high is 20 degrees Celcius. Unfortuanely the next day will be cloudy, and so will sunday. Also they will also be 20 degrees Celcius, which is not good because that usually means it will be humid, and I will smell really bad by the end of the day. Also I will feel uncomfterbly sweaty for almost the whole day. Oh well. I guess for 2 sunny days it's worth it.   Thats the only thing I can think of right now. My entire being is filled with the fact that it's sunny. Only one other thing.   WE JUST GOT THE SECOND SEASON OF ER FROM AMAZON!!!!! I am having a good day today.   Pardon my boring blog. I know you guys aren't really concerned with the fact that it is sunny, or that me and mom are going to gorge ourselves on er.

      Marsha and I are scrambling to get some time together because it feels like we have not seen each other in weeks. What is actually happening is that we are SO out of our normal routine - van dying, burns, sickness ... - that it feels like chaos around here. So today we told the kids to stay downstairs while we locked ourselves in my office to talk. In the middle of our conversation we hear the shower start and Dan yelling in sheer delight, "O YAaaaaaaaaaa! That feels GREAT! I LLLooooovvvve this shower!!" We forgot that it was his shower day and he forgot that he was banished to the downstairs. But Marsha and I couldn't help but laugh hysterically. Who would have guessed that a shower could be such a delight to a 10 year old?  Sam seems to have developed an oatmeal fetish while I was away. He gets the dried oatmeal out and spreads it on the floor. While Dan was in the shower Sam was on the loose and decided to indulge. When we came out there was oatmeal all over his bedroom floor and the living room floor. This being MY first experience with this behavior I asked him why he did it - with that look that makes them know that they are in trouble. He proceeded to lie down on the floor and pull his body toward the mess as if to swim in it. I called to him harshly, "Sam! Get up! ... I will count to three ... One ... ... ... Two ... ... ... ... ... ... ... Thhhhhhhhhhhrrrrrrrrrrrrreeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!" Just after I finished three he stood up to avoid any oncoming punishment. His face was covered in the oatmeal. What he was doing was eating it off the floor, not swimming in it. Anyone want to borrow a three year old?

      So I have a blog about Sunday School. A couple weeks ago Mom said we could play outside during church.  My Sunday School classroom has a window and they saw me through it.  So my teacher sent 2 students to bring me in.  They won that time but this time I will stay upstairs, because I had a chat with Dad, Mom, and Katelyn about the trouble.  Now I am ready. Here is how it will go.  (Kids go down to Sunday School) 2 minutes later  Jordan:  Come on down! Me: No Jordan: Why? Me: Because I have a hangover Jordan: What is a hangover? Me: This. (I point to my hangnail) Jordan:  That is your hangnail silly! Me:  I like to call it a hangover. Jordan: what does that have to do with not coming to Sunday School. Me: I got drunk last night so it hurts. Jordan:  Nonsense.  (Jamie comes up)  (Jamie and Jordan have a brief chat on what is happening.)  Jamie: You don't look drunk. Me: I recovered last night. Jordan: Then what is the matter! Me: My hangover hurts! Jamie: Let's go downstairs Jordan. Jordan: Okay!  The End  I hoped you liked this blog a lot.  LOL!!!!!!  :)D

      Mom told me that I needed to blog so here goes.  Our new van is nice but I can't touch anything except the seats and the seatbelts.  That really sucks because there is a CD player and lots of other cool stuff that Dad will not let me touch.  Honestly he really needs to watch me more.  I AM TEN YEARS OLD!!!!!!  I am responsible!  If I was allowed to touch stuff I would still be careful enough that nothing will break!  We are having pizza's for supper. I can smell them right now. We just rented a couple of movies.  The Swiss Family Robinson and The princess diaries.  I know that this is a short blog and i will try to blog tonight but I have to go!  :)D

      I am in Ottawa tonight and will head for home tomorrow morning in our "new to us" van. It looks good. It feels good. But after a 16 hour drive we will know if it is good. Then we will hope that it stays good.  Katelyn and I took the  train from Montreal to Ottawa yesterday. When I was buying the tickets, Katelyn was at my side. I asked for an adult ticket and a student ticket. The woman looked at Katelyn and told me that she had to be under 18 to qualify for the student price. We both looked at her like she had two head and said in unision that she is twelve. So the lady starts keying in the data and asks Katelyn her name and how to spell it. Both Katelyn and I started spelling her name and halfway through I stopped because Katelyn was doing a fine job on her own. When Katelyn was done she turned to me and said in a loud, sarcastic and chastizing voice, "Dad I can spell my own name thank you very much!" I in turn looked at the woman behind the counter and said, "See. She is twelve!" I thought it was pretty funny and much better than ID. When we were on the train and the ticket man collected our tickets we had to go through the same spiel again because he thought Katelyn was over eighteen.

      Well I'm in ottawa now, and I can't really say much except... I LOVE THIS KEYBOARD!!!!!!! the keys go down all the way, and they make really cool clickey noises.   Anyway we left montreal yesterday afternoon, and went on the train. Two of the train people asked just to make sure if I was under eighteen. I JUST BARELY BECAME A STUDENT IN OCTOBER! At least they believed me. Anyway the train trip was very nice, I'm decided I like trains better than airplanes, I don't really know why, maybe because when you're in a train you can walk around and you aren't cramped and you don't feel like your eardrums are going to burst. I case you guys were wondering chewing gum and plugging your nose and blowing doesn't work for me. It wasn't really a problem until the end of the flight, but theni it REALLY hurt. Then Savta picked us up and we went to swiss chalet for dinner with matt and noelia (aunt and uncle) and noah (cousin). Then we went to savtas house, and went to bed.   Today I woke up and went back to sleep, then woke up again and went downstairs, and when dad woke up we had scrambled eggs, cantaloupe, grapes, and buns. Then we got ready to go. By that time it was lunchtime already so we went to subway with matt and noelia. Then I went to the bead store which was HUGE and really fun and I made a pair of earrings and a necklace, and then I was going to stick around and maybe get some more stuff  but unfortunately I had very dumbly not gone to the bathroom in the subway so I had to go BAD. So anyway I payed for the stuff, inconspiciously doing the pee pee dance while mentally yelling at the guy "give me the bloody debit pad thingy" and it came out to more money than I expected so it was a good thing that I had to go.  Then Savta made schnitzel and salad and asparagus and corn and it was really good, and I am very full. There was also watermelon for desert.  Hope you guys enjoyed my blog!

      Have you guys ever heard of the number google?  It is 1 with a hundred 0's.  Okay enough of that.  To Nikki's Questions.  I got the rice pudding and hot dogs idea from a series of picture books called The McDuff books.  Mcduff is a dog that loves to have rice pudding with hot dogs.  As man of the family I had to return The haunted Mansion.  I also got Gilligans Island.  That might mean that Katelyn will be able to watch it.  Mom is in a huff right now for some weird reason.    :>D

      This morning I was putting olive oil in my ears. Matt wanted to know if I was oiling my brain. I said that I was because I had noticed it was getting rusty. He offered to help me clear the wax from my ears by using his elbows (you know what they say about never putting anything smaller than your elbow into your ear. ) So he stuck his elbow in my ear and then said "NEXT" -meaning I should give him my other ear for treatment. It was very cute.

      Today is a dull day. First of all I can't help thinking that I am a miserable person with nothing to do while Katelyn is in Montreal having all the fun.  Last night we watched The Haunted Mansion.  It was a perfect night to watch it to because it was creepy and dark outside. Here is a way to describe it.   All 4 of us watched it and after watching it I was shaking.  Second of all it was as scary as Pirates of the Carribian.  And third of all the other kids were sitting down hiding their heads in blankets.  It was sort of funny, because it had Eddie Murphy and Wallace Shawn in it.  Wallace Shawn is Viccini in The Princess Bride.  Inconceivible!!!  We were going to get Gilligan's Island but Katelyn would take a huge fit if she figured out what we were watching.  She is crazy for Gilligan's Island.  If you guys want to watch something scary then watch The haunted Mansion. Today we opened the window in our room and put music on FULL BLAST. We went outside and started dancing.  Frank came out to see what was going on and once he saw us dancing he went back into his house.  Anyway I have things to do so Goodbye!!!!!  :|D

      Well I'm writing this from a computer in Montreal.    So here is a minute by minute account of my time here.  We went to the airport, and we got on the plane --which actually left right on time, and arrived right on time- and came off in Montreal where we were picked up by my aunt Patti because we were going to stay with her and Uncle Gil.  We went to their house and ate a whole chicken that we bought from the store and some different salads, also from the store. Then we watched American idol (a first for me!) but they were having an ooey gooey song week and so it wasn't really that good. Then I went to bed, took a long time to fall asleep, and woke up at 6:30. (Very early for me, I'm usually not up until 8:30 at my house). So the next day began. I had breakfast, and there is a large value village near Gil and Patti's house, so we went there and I bought a pair of pants. Then we had lunch, and then everybody except for me took a nap and I watched a movie. Then Kevin and Ania, they are some of my other aunts and uncles, came over to visit us. Pattie had to go to the store to get mint jelly, and so I went with her, and we went to this store that she said was good so I could buy a belt, because my pants were falling down, and I picked one out, and then she decided she would pay for it which was REALLY nice of her and I was/am really thankful. Then we went back home and kevin and ania stayed for about 20 minutes more. Then they had to leave, and Patti had invited a family with 4 daughters for supper, and she had made roast lamb and salad and potatoes and green and yellow beans. They were pretty nice only they were asking me a bunch of questions about my spiritual life like "Are you a strong Christian?" I felt like saying "No I'm VERY weak" but I said yes, and she turns to her oldest daughter and says "Isn't that great Rebecca, she's the oldest in her family AND  she's a strong Christian." I always used to hate it when my mom would point out ANY similarities between me and whoever, and I just felt really embarrassed. She asked me a bunch of other spiritual questions too, but I won't waste your time. Other than that they were really nice. Then I went to bed again, and woke up at 7:00 this time, and not it is 9:00 and here I am blogging. I hope this minute by minute account of my time here is long enough for you guys!

      At supper we do this thing called "High/Low" where you say the high of your day and the low of your day. Tonight Matthew's high was our "McDuff supper" (homemade rice pudding with hotdogs on top). His low was that we were outside so much today that he got a sunburn on the back of his neck.   So Dan was invited by our library branch manager to be their internet ambassador - to introduce the wonders of the internet to people who have never used it. So they had a little soiree where Dan was interviewed by the head librarian. Then they had a laptop hooked up to a projector and Dan had to show people how to navigate the internet using search engines, etc.  He told them the internet was like a person with the most brains in the world. He received many nice complements on his presentation. One elderly person said, "I can't believe how many times you used the word 'basically' They had some snacks afterwards & he was very thoughtful & brought Sarah home a juicebox.   The kids & I went for a walk today to the grocery store. We were buying all kinds of special foods - hotdogs for the McDuff supper, turkey bacon for homemade egg mcmuffins, cheese for grilled cheese (which we never have because Katelyn is allergic to milk). But as Dan would say: when the cats away the mice will play. We had a great time watching some construction machines working on a new Shopper's Drug Mart building. The kids brought a long shoe lace which they were pretending to be horses with. Then they decided to tie it to theirs arms. I thought this was a great idea in the grocery store -- all the kids could hold onto a piece of the rope. Unfortunately some of the horses ran away, causing rope burn to Sarah's wrist (imagine much weeping, wailing and gnashing of teeth but no actual mark on the wrist). Believe me a simple walk can turn into high adventure very quickly around here.

      I believe that the last time I blogged was near Sarah's birthday.  My friend Nathan has a blog.  You can check it out at atvman.blogspot.com.  Our friend Nathan did a comercial on TV. He was advertizing a toilet company.  If you watch ATV, and you see a comercial with a short red-headed boy then you know my friend.  Sign in the guestbook if you saw him.  Anyway he has a blog that tells you some fake jokes that a real actor would post if he had a blog. He has a large liking to Spongebob Squarepants.  He is a funny guy.  I like him.  So Kate and Dad are gone so now I am the man of the house.  We already had Subs for Supper.  Anyway.  I had to give a presentation this evening.  it came out of nowhere.  Mom all of a sudden told me that I had to teach some youth people how to use the Internet.  For some reason, I didn't throw up.  I thought I was going to throw up.  But I didn't!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Anyway I have to go now!!  :)D

      Guess what!  I am actually coming to ontario!!! First I am going to montreal and then I'm taking the train to ottawa. I'm leaving tomorrow afternoon. I can't wait. Its because we bought a new van, only its in ottawa, and obviously we would have to get to ottawa to drive it back home. So dad said he was going to go, and then I asked if I could go, and he said yes, if i payed for myself and so now the flights are all booked and everything is ready but my bag. Yup you got it. I'm not so organized that I have my bag packed the night before we are leaving. Nope, thats not me, so I'm going to spend a lot of time tomorrow doing that stuff. We don't leave til 3:30 for the airport though, so I'm not worried. Anyway I have a list of things to pack (the idea being that I don't forget something... I always do, last time it was my pyjama pants.) Of course I know I'll forget SOMETHING but better to forget one thing that to forget 2.   Anyway I'm really looking forward to it. Also Beah, Dan bought your prize, and me and dan adjusted them (don't worry we didn't ruin them they are still perfectly usable, they might even work better) so you can be expecting them. I adjusted one and Dan adjusted one. Try and figure out who did which one.

      Actually last night when Dan told J.B. that he was the rectum, it was actually me who (jokingly) dared him to do it. I didn't actually think he would do it, but he did, and it was VERY funny. JB thought it was VERY funny.   Right now I'm wearing a baggy pink shirt, shorts, and a blue seashell necklace that makes my neck itch. It is quite an interesting outfit. It doesn't really fit today, because today was supossed to be nice and sunny, but it is cloudy (again!) and so I'm just wearing this for fun. The other reason is that I didn't have any clean laundry.   I've always thought that it would be REALLY fun to let your hair in places that you normally shave grow, (dad this does not include your head) and then dye it a wacky colour. (Examples would be green, purple, red, gold, black if you have really light hair etc.) That would really be making a statement. I should try it at some point. Just walk around the beach. Of course it would be better if you did it with another person, so you're not the only one doing it. Someday I'll do it. Also you could tie dye your feet, i've seen someone do it before. Or tie dye your hands. Or you could do your fingers all different colours. Or you could tie dye your chin. The possibilities are endless.

      Even though I am sick AGAIN (just a chest cold) I was feeling VERY graced today. Until ...  I decided to take Dan and Katelyn to a church that we do not go to very often. The minister spoke about the different parts of the body working together to make a whole and that the church should work the same way - each person bringing their capability and doing their part. At the end of the service bold Dan walked right up to the minister, stood firmly in front of him so that he had the guys full attention. He lifted his hand to his forhead and saluted and said, "Rectum reporting for duty!"  When raising kids you have GOT TO have a sense of humor or you will NOT MAKE IT!! Fortunately the minister saw the humor and broke out into howls of laughter. He told Dan that if he wanted to come to his church on a regular basis that they could find him a job at the back of the church where rectums belong. Now that is one "with it" minister. I could tell that the people standing around were perplexed by this exchange. But that's ok - by the time I return there again next year, people will have forgotten that I don't know how to raise polite, well mannered kids.

      So yesterday I took Matt to the dentist. On the way down I was asking if Matt if he thought Dr. Chiasson should be the official dentist of Deep Sea Chicken. Matt wanted to know what official meant. Once I explained, he started thinking about his pitch. So while in the dentist chair he said, "Dr. Chiasson, at my restaurant we sometimes have trouble with the chicken's  beaks. Could you be Deep sea Chicken's dentist." She said that she could & asked if she would get to eat there for free. Matt is very generous with his employees so he said yes she could eat for free. He did, however, suggest that she pay first and then he would pay her back in the back room. He figured this would keep other diners from feeling jealous. We were discussing menu items and Danny suggested pizza. At first Matt thought pizza would have too much fat. But then he came up with a great solution. At Deep sea Chicken there is going to a machine that will take the FAT out of food but leave the food and flavour in! The hygenist said "He has a very good sense of humour" But the truth is Matt has no sense of humour. He takes his restaurant completely seriously. He is also working on a new idea: an army camp. Almost daily he tells me "Mom my army camp is about peace, not war"  Dan & Matt have been having a lot of fun with a KLUTZ press book on battery science Give a couple of boys some batteries and wire and they'll be busy for weeks! They made fans, burglar alarms, crude alarm clocks, & a battery operated vibrating pen. They've turned into a regular pair of McGivers. (If you don't know what I'm talking about then you obviously didn't watch bad TV in the early 80's.) But you guys should all go see the Starsky & Hutch movie. It is very funny and even more enjoyable if you were a loyal fan of the TV show. There was one scene that just didn't fit ... I'm sure you will all know what I mean when you see it.                Sarah's burns are healing nicely. The care at the IWK hospital is great. Unlike adults children refuse to be sick. So her bandages always come off because she is playing around. I will be sweeping in the kitchen & find a piece of Jell-net on the ground (hospital talk for something that looks like cloth mesh soaked in vaseline but which is actually made from seawead) When I change her dressings she likes to do most of the work herself - cutting off the old dressing, soaking the wounds in saline solution, etc. She has actually become quite efficient at it.

      HA HA HAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!! OOOOOOHhhhhhhhhhh platinumblonde, I've found a real reason to hate you!!!!!!!!!!!! Ok, so here it is. PAMELA ANDERSON IS FROM VANCOUVER!!!!!!!!!!! You can just forget that I ever though of coming there!  Anyway the reason Pamela Anderson comes to mind was because I was listening to the radio today (CBC 1 The program is called Definitely NOT the Opera or DNTO for short) and they have a worst canadian contest. The idea is that you sent in your nominee for worst canadian, and then on the next show they tell you who was decided to be the worst canadian. Anyway my first thought was Pamela anderson. (See an earlier blog in april I think, maybe even in march you know we need to get one of those search thingies). Mom said she was canadian, but I wasn't sure so I searched the internet. That was how I found out that she was from Vancouver.   Anyway I'm going to nominate pamela Anderson and I'm calling everybody else to do the same. Just e-mail:  dnto@cbc.ca  and tell them that you think that Pamela Anderson is the worst canadian ever born. You can add other comments etc. but that message MUST get across. You have until 11:59 on friday (everybodys time) to tell them.

      Not much to report today. Only here to say I'm still alive (barely). Sarah and I went back to Tim Horton's. This time we dined for free after I explained the burn situation. It is still raining here and I am getting a little depressed. I may just join Katelyn on her escape plan to get out of this mud pit. When I am feeling happier I'll blog again. I think I am going to go take a nap.

      I just checked a bunch of airlines for flights to vancouver and they average (one way) about 700 dollars and I am short by at least 200 dollars, so I am stuck in this mudpit (which, after all this rain, is literally what halifax is)

      I'm sorry I didn't blog earlier today. In platinumblonde land it is only 8:00, but still...  The reason I didn't blog earlier is because I came upstairs to blog, and my grandmother was checking her e-mail. I was appalled. I had never seen an inbox that full. She was using 96 %... and there is nothing wrong with that but I usually only use 1 or2 % so I spent an hour helping her clean out her inbox. Some of the messages we deleted were a year old. She told me she had 2000 messages in her inbox at home, and she had deleted all the ones from last year, (who has 2000 messages?????) Anyway that is my excuse for not blogging.  It is still raining, and has been for the past week, and according to the forecasts will rain for the next week. Bllaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah. I hate you Platinum Blonde with you 24 degrees, and nice sunny weather, where all the birds are singing on the blossoming trees and the flowers are in full bloom. I wonder how much a ticket to vancouver would be. It just might be worth it... hmmmmmmmmm...

      Another memory I forgot about our van was the time our neighbor came to me and said that she looked out her window and saw Matthew standing on top of it without any pants on. This was while he was potty training. Then Matt decided he needed to go and so took a pee off the roof! Needless to say if we moved, I don't think we'd be terribly missed.  During that time when Matt was potty training I also remember walking into the living room where he was sitting on the floor with nothing on and he was holding a measuring tablespoon. He managed to fill it perfectly with pee. No spills. Talk about control! And, in a very odd sense, CREATIVE!  I took Sarah on a date this morning to Tim Hortons. As I was getting out of the car I said, "OK Sarah, let's rock and roll." She then proceeded to chastize me for saying rock and roll because it is the same as saying sex and drugs. I found out that this association was helped along by Katelyn and Marsha. I need to find out what they've been telling her!  Our date did not last long because Sarah poured her hot tea down her shirt and pants. The burn was quite bad so now she is with Marsha in emergency. I could tell when it happened and Sarah started screaming that the Tim Horton ladies were very appologetic about giving her such hot tea. I think they were afraid that I was going to sue them.

      Well, it is raining outside, which is not good, because we had 3 full days of BEAUTIFUL ten degree sunny weather, and now for the past two days it has been raining.   it strikes me as ironic that on the radio John Hamm (the premier of nova Scotia) was lamenting that the past year was very hard, and the worst year that he could have possibly imagined. First about a year ago there was a HUGE rainstorm, and then there was hurricane Juan (a class 2 hurricane) that hit Halifax, and there was white Juan. Well we could say the same thing for the past year. Fortunately we were not affected by the rainstorm that caused wide-spread flooding, but then there was Hurricane Juan, and it blew down half our deck and took away our power for 5 days. Then we had White Juan, which was a meter of snow, only the snow blew in certain places and not in others, so some places had no snow at all, and some had 8 feet tall snowdrifts. We ended up with about a meter of snow on our driveway. It took FOREVER to shovel, and we had to shovel a meter away from the curb too because the plow didn't come down the sides of the street, they only plowed in the middle of the road in case an emergency vehicle had to go somewhere. Then we had dads surgery, and he was in bed for 2 weeks, and now our van died yesterday. I had always told myself that I would be happy when it died (it wasn't in great condition) but now I am thinking that when I walked away from it at the Tim Hortons where we had to push it into a parking spot that it was the last time I would ever see it and I am starting to feel very sad. Its funny how things like that happen. Also we're going to have to go for a while without a van, seeing as they are about 30,000 dollars, and there is no way we are able to afford one. You would think that would be the end of it, but noooooooooo, to top it all off Sarah spilled hot water all over herself and so how she has a huge burn and she is in the er. I have no news of her, and also we are stuck at home and it is raining outside. Blah. Would you guys agree that we have had a worse year than John Hamm?

      Well it's a sad day in Abarbaville. Big Blue has breathed her last. Big Blue is (was) our van. I knew the steering was needing repair, so when it konked out on us yesterday on our way to church I decided it was time to tow it to be repaired. After church I went to where it lay and before calling the tow truck, tried starting it. It miraculously shook to life so I drove it to the mechanic. As they were driving it into the shop, the steering completely gave way. Fortunately it didn't happen 3 minutes earlier or I'd have been in big trouble - or the night before when I was booting down the highway with all the kids. That could have turned ugly.  Seeing it today as it was being prepared to be towed to the junk yard brought back memories. Like the time Sarah decided to draw pictures on it ... with a sharp rock. Of course the artwork was permanent. Then there was the time that someone backed it into a pole and dented the fender. Matthew once found some blue paint and decided to do some touch up work. If you looked closely you could see blue splotches all over the hood. Big Blue also was home to a peach for over a year while it transformed itself from its peachly attributes to its compost attributes. Not to mention a host of other things, some biodegradable and some not, that lived under its roof in safety.  On the upside some VERY GENEROUS friends have been letting us use their car while their kids are away so we are still somewhat mobile. We started poking around and looking at other vehicles. On the downside the price of vehicles seems to have more than doubled in the last 10 years! It's unreal.

      Well I had quite an eventful day! Today since it was Easter Sunday we had to go to church for 9:30 instead of 10:00 so that we could get parking. There is a Tim Hortons near the church, so we stopped so Dad and Savta could get coffee, and I could get minty tea because I had a sore throat. So anyway we all piled back into the van, and dad turned the key... and it didn't start! We tried again and again, and prayed and it still wouldn't start. So Mom put it in neutral and Dad and Savta pushed it into a parking spot. So really, we didn't need to go so early. Anyway we walked to the church, about a 3 minute walk, and then we had I think three cars drive our family home.   Then we had an issue, because somebody had written trash in our interactive story. It was all about inappropriate body parts, and so dad deleted it. We were all very mad at whoever did it.  SO GO AWAY AND DON'T COME BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Also we went to the park for the whole afternoon and then we came back and had Sarah's birthday party. She turned 8 today.

      Sorry about the lack of bloggage lately. Time differences are really getting me down. Last week I called my friend Debbie in England. I woke her up. Let me say that I know her well enough to know when I am calling too late. The problem is that "British Summer Time" starts a week earlier than our "Daylight Savings Time" so I actually called her at midnight, not 11 o'clock as it usually is when I call. I've just got off the phone with Melanie in B.C. who was going out to get groceries and will not get back until it is way too late for me to talk on the phone (she is 4 hours behind me - in the time zone sense, not in the brain sense.) Ugh!   Yesterday we had a rousing game of Good Friday Uno. Sarah found it very upsetting every time she had to put down a plus four card (meaning the person beside her would have to pick up 4 cards). Katelyn turned her and said, "Sarah you have to understand the cardinal rules of UNO: backstab, feel sorry for no one and win at all costs". I'm not sure these were exact words, but the nice thing about Katelyn is I know that she will be only so glad to correct me.   Tomorrow is Sarah's 8th birthday. She asked for Spaghetti and meatballs for her birthday - which she claims that she has never had. I do not deny this is a possibility. You know how magazines say "dinner in 20 minutes for those nights when you don't have much time?" Well those are the only recipes I EVER use. I think this happened when I had kid #2. Also, I stopped baking for about 10 years. I started again only recently when I made a paradigm shift: kids care only about the process of baking, not the product. So if when we make cookies, all the dough gets eaten before the cookies make it to the oven: FINE. Sarah came into the kitchen while I was making the meatballs and said, "it really hurts me to see my poor mother working her fingers to the bone to make me meatballs". This is pure vintage Sarah. She is always concerned about the affairs of others and doesn't want to put anyone to too much work.   Now here is a tender point that I need help with. Do I stink or need to brush my hair? Yesterday a certain houseguest arrived for her yearly visit. She brought me two kinds of soap. One is made from sulfur and seems very cleansing but really stinks. The other is made from olive oil. Katelyn pointed out that this houseguest always brings me gifts that pertain to personal hygiene. Last year she brought me a bottle of shampoo. The year before that it was a hairbrush. And this is not the first time she has given me soap. Is she trying to make a subtle point? Please blog readers, if I stink just out with it and tell me. Melanie, Mibsey, Debbie just shoot straight.  This certain house guest took us to Swiss Chalet for supper. It was very nice to be treated and also not have to make a meal. Matt spoke in detail to our waitress about Deep Sea Chicken. She was an excellent waitress so he offered her a job. He also asked her if he could copy the decorating style of Swiss Chalet. After we were done he collected the bones from our dinner. She brought him a little take out container to put them in and I believe he said he was going to use them at Deep Sea Chicken - though I'm not sure how. For decoration, perhaps? Hmmm... They were giving away these little toy trucks from the treasure chest. You are only supposed to take one toy each, but Michele made sure they had the whole set of 5. Of course within an hour they were all broken, causing much crying and heart-felt pleading for daddy to repair them.   Well must go and remind my children once again that it is bedtime - actually it was bedtime 2 hours ago. I say, "tomorrow is a big day" but they don't seem to take much notice of my gentle mothering ways on this one. Perhaps I'll move on to threats of not giving them any Easter chocolate.  Happy Easter everybody.  Marsha

      So after sleeping until noon today (or rather staying in bed) - which was absolutely glorious I might add - we made lunch and took the kids to the park. I'll warn you now, this entry is going to be base.  At the park the kids were sliding down the spiral slide and Katelyn or Dan would stand at the bottom blocking anyone who came down the slide from getting off until there was a pile up of kids. I could hear them saying, "Oh no there is constipation!" I laughed to myself because they occasionally get words confused and I thought the word they wanted was congestion. But when I heard them call the little kids prunes, I realized what they were playing. The spiral slide was the intestines. The big kids were poo. The person blocking everyone at the bottom of the slide was causing the constipation and the only way to break it was to send in the littlest kids who were the prunes.  There were other kids at the park who were playing along but I could tell that their parents were feeling a little uncomfortable. At one point Dan, who has a rather booming voice, went down the slide yelling, "I'M THE LEAD POO!" Shortly thereafter all the other parents suddenly remembered that they had other things they needed to do and took their kids away. Can't say I blame them really, but they failed to see the learning opportunity that this game was. It was all about how the digestive system sometimes runs amok and how to solve it.

      Happy good friday! I don't see why they call it good friday. They should call it bad friday, and good sunday and good monday. I mean, what is so good about watching a guy get tortured on the cross. I guess he was dying for a good reason, but its bad that we killed him wasn't it? Those are just my thoughts.  My grandmother is coming from ottawa late tonight, and so I have to clean the bathroom for her, something I don't really want to do, but I can't really help it so I guess I'll just do it.   Mom and dad are still not up yet, its drives me crazy when they stay in bed til lunchtime. Also this was supposed to be a family day, and that can't really happen when mom and dad are in ved til 12 and then I have to clean the bathroom etc. Oh well

      I'm BA-ACK!!!!!!!!!!!!  Right now I'm at the library, and with nothing to do, I though "hey, maybe I should blog!!" So here I am blogging here at our very own Captain William Spry Public library.   I'm sitting next to a full shelf filled with pony books. I have to ask myself, what is it with ponies? I mean I like them, but not enough to read a shelf full of badly written series's of horse books. I mean COME ON! Anyway those are just my views.   It is such a beautiful day outside, it is 8 degrees, and beautiful and sunny. I almost wore shorts like I did a couple days ago but I decided not to.   Not much else to say...  P.S. Aimee and Beah, have you ever considered starting blogs for yourselves?  P.P.S. Who is Frances. She has been writing in our story and her e-mail is from UNB, but I've never heard of her. (Whoever you are you are still welcome to participate in our blog.)

      This is a tribute to my friend Kendall, a librarian, who recently retired. First, statistics. Kendall is about 5 foot 11, he weighs about 240 lb's. I don't know how old he is, but I would guess he is in his 40s. He is a funny guy, who likes to joke around.  Whenever he is at the library he lets me photocopy my work for free. He is usually in one part of the library and he doesn't move from that spot until we notice him... If we pass him without saying hi he will act really offended and it takes all our strength to make him admit that he was just joking.  He has a girl and a boy.  THe girl's name is Kendra, but I don't know the boy's name.  Of course he has a wife.  He owns 2 cars plus the 2 that his wife and son drive. He has a convertible sports car that he only drives when the weather is really really nice. Kendall loves kids. He also loves cars. Now that he is retired he is going to get a job doing something with cars.  Katelyn... I always have known what the capital of Saskatchewan is.  It is Regina. You also spelt Saskachewan wrong.  Ha ha ha.  Although I do not know most of the capitals of the provinces of Canada. I am very angry  :(D

      COULD YOU GUYS STOP PICKING ON ME??!!!!!!!!    It isn't MY fault that certain people refused to educate me concerning the land (or province) of my birth. And I'll remind you Dan, that you don't know the capitals of half the provinces... You said that Ontario's capital was Ottawa, and Quebec's was Montreal. Then you said that Saskatuan's capital was Saskatoon. You said that new Brunswick capital was Moncton, and you said that British Columbia's capital was Vancouver. So you see, we all brag about our knowledge and call other people stupid, but really we are all stupid. (Although I just made one mistake, and dan made a bunch!!)  I'm just a averagely stupid canadian... don't pick on me for it!

      Yeah well guess what Mom.  It just so happens that instead of saying "Dan kicked the ball" you also give a 10 minute interview with Colin.  Also instead of grunting you give 8 hour interviews on Gabby.  To the blog readers.. Gabby is one of the best players playing on my team.  Although she does get a little annoying sometimes.  Katelyn.  There has to be a lake in Toronto.  I have a little bit of proof; I know that is was filmed in Toronto  #1, I could very clearly see the CN tower in the backround.  #2, I have seen pictures of Toronto and the lake does not look different at all  #3, I could also see that big Dome Thingie in the backround.  #4, All the sailboats had Canadian Flags at the back  You can watch it and you will look and feel like a complete dumbo.   Anyway it is my bedtime so I should be going  :)D

      Sammy has developed the strange habit of walking around the house with one mitten on. It is very cute. Whenever we see him Ron & I say "Hey Michael Jackson" or start singing "Thriller" Sam took a 1.5 hour temper tantrum today because we had to leave the park. I had this insane idea that I could sit in the van with my cup of tea while they played. Immediately Sam went out of eyesight and Sarah & Matt headed towards the ocean shore. I had to cut the play time short after an hour because I was freezing. I thought that I would just go home and have a cup of tea and read my book. But No. Sammy's temper tantrum only ended when I snuggled with him in my bed and read Bob the Builder books to him. Once I let go of my expectations of time to myself, it was fun to snuggle with him. We're looking for a good mechanic in Halifax - you know the type - honest, skilled, etc. Anyone have any suggestions? ~Marsha

      Hey mom, how was I supposed to know? Now you've made me feel stupid in front of all the people who read our blog. I haven't been to Toronto since we last visited Kevin and Carolyn (who live in Halifax now) when I was about 4. All I remember was looking out their apartment window and seeing A LOT of lights and cars. (I remember other visits to Toronto, but  I don't remember any water!!) Anyway I stand (shame facedly and embarrasedly) corrected.  What is the deal with Pamela Anderson???????? What is wrong with her? I mean, most actors are pretty. Pamela Anderson is not somebody I would call pretty. With those (nonexistent eyebrows?) and over existent breasts. I mean how big do they have to be before your happy? You can see all her make up. Her face is literally covered in it, with absolutely no spaces. Was she pretty when she first started acting?? How on earth did she get where she was today? (Of course in Hollywood baywatch is not exactly the best you can get for yourself.) The reason more Americans don't come to Canada is because Pamela Anderson is Canadian. I mean, the ones that don't think we live in igloos (and not all Americans do) think we are all Pamela Andersons. If I lived in America and I had no reason not to come to Canada except for Pamela Anderson I would not come! Of course some people do move here to get farther away from Hollywood (only to discover a land full of Pamela andersons... just kidding). So what is wrong with this person? What are your thoughts on the subject of Pamela Anderson?

      Now you people in warmer climates (like B.C.) may not think much of Dan's comment about soccer. Melanie from B.C. wrote in her Blog today that it is going to be 24C in Vancouver today and she might swim outside. Please spare me, Melanie. In stark contrast it snowed here today. I had to scrape frost off the windshield this morning. So please understand that Dan's soccer coach is a bit optimistic in his predictions that Dan will be playing this weekend. Let me try to describe Dan's coach Colin. After a practice you can simply say something like, "I saw Dan kicked the ball" to Colin & you can be guaranteed a 10 minute monologue on Dan's best moves. All I have to add is appropriate grunting noises in agreement. Let me remind you, dear readers, that this is recreational soccer. Our kids are solid recreational players. Colin sees the best in each of his players and for a while had us believing that our kids were some sort of superstar soccer players that would ride through university on soccer scholarships. He wanted us to tape World Cup soccer games so the kids could watch the moves and emulate them. His wife says soccer is his religion. I dare say he is the best coach our kids will ever see.  So I am surprised at some things that have not made it into the blog. Dan has not talked about the powerpoint slide shows he has been making or the fact that I disconnected the internet from their computer or an ode to his favorite librarian who just retired. (plead with them & I'm sure they'll explain)   Sam is a very funny little boy. Going for a walk to mail a letter turns into high adventure for him. He must climb every mountain of snow, bang on the 'in' sign at Dunkin' Donuts, push the crosswalk button and then take a fit in the crosswalk when I try to guide him along. When one of the kids does something he deems offensive, he just lies down on the ground and plays dead. Somehow a ritual developed where the kids all stand around him and say, "walk dead man". But he will not get up until I pick him up bodily and set him on his feet. He is absolutely crazy about rice crackers and will happily eat an entire package if I let him. Today I caught him going to the basement with a package (a big no-no). When I called him on it he closed his eyes and pretended to be shy. When he was less verbal in the same situation he would just stand there, blink his eyelids and say, "what mom". So you would explain it to him again & he would say, "what mom" over and over again. After a while we realized that he knew perfectly well what we were saying but he just didn't want to do what we were asking. But he seemed so cute and charming. Do not be fooled! This 3 year old knows exactly what he is doing.  Rogers video got a new volume of "mighty machines" today. Ah glorious bliss! This bought me enough time to have a cup of tea with my feet up AND get 6 loads of laundry put away. The kids claimed that the show was filmed in Toronto. But Katelyn insisted this could not be true because Toronto wasn't on water. I have failed my child. I said, "Do you not know the geography of the land of your birth, child? The land of traffic jams and SUV's and big houses". I had to wait through a traffic light today on the peninsula and I actually thought to myself "I can't stand how crowded it is down here on the peninsula". Perhaps I too have forgotten the land of my birth.

      I don't want it to snow either because my soccer coach said that when the snow melts then we will start playing soccer again, and soccer is my life.  Anyway...  Sarah was making oatmeal on the stove and she forgot one simple thing...  She forgot to put the kettle on the stove!!!!!!!  So she put the stove up to Maximum and then waited.  Then Sarah noticed it..  Instead of putting the kettle on the stove she put a rice pot the hasn't been soaked yet.  Once she noticed, she took it off and yelled for somebody.  Katelyn finally came down and turned the stove off and gave Sarah a nice large lecture.  Then Sarah went upstairs ashamed and sobbing.  Then Katelyn was asking Mom what to use to clean the pot.  She didn't know but I suggested toilet bowl cleaner.  Katelyn thought about my suggestion and said it was a good idea but Mom said no because, as most of us know, toilet bowl cleaner contains Hydro-Chloric Acid.  I might have spelt that wrong but you know what that means.  I still think that Toilet-Bowl-Cleaner is a good idea.  Anyway, I hope you enjoyed my blog. See ya!!!!  :)D

      Mom and all the kids are at the library so I'm alone up here. Its snowing again. Thats not good because I REALLY can't wait for it all to melt. We're only supposed to get an inch though so I guess its ok. Anyway the snow is mostly melted already.   I was woken up by a loud knock on my door. It was dan and he had a piece of pumpkin pie leftover from mom and dads bible study last night. DO MY SIBLINGS EVER READ INGRIDIENTS???????!!!!!!!!  Of course I was allergic to the milk in the pumpkin pie, and the apple pie they had graciously devoured.  AAAAAARRRRRRRRRRGggh. I feel like yelling and screaming at the top of my lungs. I know it was just a piece of pie and I'm overreacting but I'm really ticked off. All there was for my breakfast was oatmeal. I know I'm ranting on and on and on and on and on, but its the only thing I can do besides scream. I like pie!!!   Sorry I'll stop now. This blog will either be very boring of very funny. I'm not really sure.

      Well yesterday we had mibsey over. You guys all may remember the contest (the one where the fifteenth person to enter our guestbook won a prize package to be able to spend a day with us, and then taken out to a restaurant with mum and dad). Well Melanie won the contest, but since she wasn't going to be in Halifax she transferred the prize package to mibsey. It was a lot of fun, and we dyed eggs (Mibseys were really nice, but I can't bring myself to be able to make a nice dyed egg) and then we beaded. She also commissioned me to make her fifteen bead creatures (and that is something that hasn't happened in more than a year... Good thing I don't make a real living off of my beads) So I'm really happy. Then we played 2 games of UNO, and the competition between Sarah and Dan was very very high, and then we had supper. It was a VERY fun day. (Sorry for all you people who didn't win...) Maybe we'll have another contest. I sure hope so.

      Today we had Mibsey over for her day with the pirates. Melanie who won the contest transfered it to her friend Mibsey. The prize was to spend a day with the kids and be taken out to a fancy restaurant by Marsh and I. I will only report two things for now.  When Mibsey came in the house Sarah said, "Oh the sweet smell of guests in our house!" Dan picking up on the humor responded with, "I love the smell of guests in the morning!"  Mibsey being into photography had her camera which intrigued the kids. Matt was walking around with it looking at people through the viewfinder. While examining Mibsey up close he said, "I can see your bacteria."  It was a great a day!

      I'm going to my best friends birthday party tonight. I was really really looking forward to it, and then she called this morning and told me she had decided on a movie... The Ring. I was not too happy at this pronouncement, and called her back to say that I'd heard it was really scary, and I don't like scary movies, and I know she doesn't either. Unfortunately she was rushing out the door to school, so I don't think my arguments were really sufficient, due to the  fact that she was telling me throughout the whole phone call (in a very rushed tone) that she had to go to school. Dad told me that it wasn't a horror movie, that it was a thriller. (He actually hasn't seen the movie) but anyway WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE??? Maybe a thriller is like a half horror movie, so I'd say a movie like signs was a thriller, and all the reviews agreed that The ring was a horror movie, so I am "coincidentally" not looking forward to the party so much as I was before. What do you guys think about the movie???

      Well I've had an eventful day. As soon as I was woken up by Danny frantically blowing in my ear and whispering something about a toilet weird things started happening. I jumped out of my bed to go to the bathroom to find that the toilet seat was covered in pee. I blamed Dan for this who insisted he didn't do it. He told me it was a little green man from mars. I quite obviously didn't believe him so I slapped him. Dan toppled over and hit the floor with a crash. I attempted to pick him up but then he turned into a giant noodle. The rest of the family meanwhile heard the crash, and rushed into the bathroom only to see me staring down at a giant noodle. "What was that crash?" Dad asked. I told him the noodle had fallen down, and quickly picked it up and dusted it off. As soon as I did this it turned into homer Simpson. I looked over at the toilet, and there was no pee left. Dan/Noodle/Homer Simpson then turned and walked out of the bathroom yelling bewilderedly "Marge? Bart? Lisa? Maggie?" We all turned and watched him go. Then we all looked at each other. Mom said "alright kids, its time to do your school work. Katelyn, it's your turn to blog" So here I am. .....If you haven't already figured it out...                                       APRIL FOOLS!!!!!!!  Anyways today is April fools day, and since dad is in his condition, we couldn't really plan a good trick this year. I'm going to go back in time to last year though...  On march 31 last year we realized that the next day was April fools day. Me and Dan quickly had a conference and were unable to come up with a good trick. I was upstairs in mom and dads room, and I thought of a really good trick. I immediately told Dan, and we took all of moms and dads underwear and hid them. We left one pair (the pair of England underwear that Debs gave mom as a joke) That morning dad was going to a squash game with rod day. He opened his underwear drawer... to find no underwear. He was not in a good mood, and he did not take it as a joke at all. He yelled really loud for us to bring his underwear back. It was supposed to be funny, but it wasn't very funny when he "coincidentally" couldn't find his razor either. I think back and think it was funny, but he got really mad.

      Man talk for a moment. Subject: Gillette Mach 3. I was introduced to this beauty last summer and was converted upon one shave. Close, smooth and unequivocally the best shave I'd ever had - which is a high compliment because my wiskers are like twine. I've been using the Mach 3 for almost a year now and two blessed side-effects are that the blades last about a month and you don't cut yourself with them either. I've been cut free since I started - that is, until this morning. It would happen that on a day I will be in public most I gash myself with a brand new blade. This one is no toilet-paper solvable predicament. It was bad enough that I needed a band-aid - which I am still wearing. I was lulled into a false sense of security. I hate shaving. Now I'm going to have to be careful when I shave again lest I make it too easy for people to spot an idiot.  I think if people ask me why I have a band-aid on my face I will tell them I was stabbed. Sounds better than, "I got a boo-boo shaving."

      Sam looked at me today in surprise and said, "Dad! I see your brain!" He was pointing to something near my eye. Maybe eye poop. Later I looked at him and said that I saw his brain and pointed at his eyes. I asked if he saw my brain and he said I did not have one. Must have pooped it all out. Now I am a brainless, fat baldguy. Things are going downhill fast.

      I am sorry that i haven't blogged in a little while. As a political columnest (sort of) I have the latest news on the election according to me! Stephen harper still doesn't really impress me, which may be attributed to the news this morning. HE was in saskatchuan (no comments from the peanut gallery) campaining, (again no comments) and was talking about something, I don't remember what though, but it was not a problem i'd heard about. The problems I've heard about are mad cow disease, drought, etc. Somebody asked him what he was going to do about the losses of farmers because of the aforementioned troubles. He didn't really have an answer, and when he did answer he was stuttering. He implied that he would be talking about agriculture later, but he didn't seem too sure, and if I were campaigning (that wasn't right either was it) I would probably campaign first on the things that the general public was really concerned about, of at least I would anticipate being asked, and have a smart sounding (at least) on hand.  last night I had an odd dream, I dreamed that in the hospital there were signs everywhere, like the ones that tell you to wash your hands a lot, and if you have symptoms of sars that you should get it checked out. Anyway I dreamed that there were signs everywhere that it was unsanitary to have any less than 3 pairs of underwear, and 4 if they were thongs. Very odd dream. Hope I didn't gross anybody out. I also hope that Kevin Jolly doesn't read this blog, because from the last report I heard he only owned 3 pairs of undies. Also he probably wouldn't be too happy about me mentioning his name.  We went and saw shrek 2 today, the whole family. I wasn't expecting it to be that good, because sequels usually are really bad, but I think this was was EVEN better. And thats hard to say because the other was also REALLY good. So anybody wondering if they should see it, because they are worried that it won't measure up doesn't have to be worried. Take if from me.

      I am quite surprised at Katelyn's political views!! And how strongly she holds to them. This is unchartered territory for us. I think this will be a lively election around here.  Steve has changed his name back to Matt and wants us to celebrate by throwing a party. I think that is a good idea. Change your name and confuse all your friends and family, then change it back and get them to throw a party for you.  I fixed a cupboard door in our kitchen today. It was broken about four years ago when Sarah fell backward on her chair and put her head through the middle of it (of course only damaging the door - her head was fine). The door itself fell off the hinges a year later. Last year I went hunting for a door that matched and finally found one last summer. It sat waiting for me to finish it and put it on for 10 months. That's life around here. Anyone want to come over and help me re-paint our kitchen and livingroom so that I finish it this year? That's the next job that needs to be done.

      Today is such a blah day.   It started out sunny, but now it is cloudy AGAIN and I am so sick of clouds. I wish I could decree what the weather would be like every day. I would probably choose to have it sunny and hot on most days, and with little sunshowers every day so all the farmers didn't kill me. Besides I like sunshowers. WE could also grow food all year long, which would really boost our economy, and it would be so warm that some people would walk instead of drive. Yes that would be a perfect world.  Of course there are many other things that would happen is we had a perfect world. For one everybody would be a wonderful singer. THey would even be able to sing 4 part harmonies. Of course, they would only do this if they wanted to, they could choose what kind of music they sang, yes even if it was heavy metal.  2. In a perfect world there would be no heavy metal.  3. IN a perfect world we wouldn't have a cranky neighbour. Whenever a ball goes over into his yard he throws it away. This has led to a severe shortage of balls in our yard. We also wouldn't have an achoholic neighbour, and we would have really really nice neighbours all around the street. Right now we only have 4 nice neighbours. (4 houses with nice neighbours.)  4. In a perfect world your socks would be whatever colour or size you would want them to be.  5. In a perfect world all our politicians would be smart, and healthy looking--that means that they wouldn't be all blotchy, they wouldn't always look like they were about to have a heart attack, and, er, they wouldn't attempt to portray mel gibson without a doctors full consent. (See platinum blonde)  Hmmmm, was I making a little jab at paul martin there? Maybe I was, but I still think that it is better to vote paul martin than steven harper or jack layton.  6. In a perfect world I could bite someone and not get in trouble, or hurt anyone.  Anyway those are the things that I think would make our world a better place. Seeing as there are LOADS of other ways to make the world a better place I've decided to have a contest. You all submit ideas to make the world a better place, none of the wishy washy stuff like picking up litter, or not smoking of paying it foward, but things that you TRULY think would make the world a much better place to live in. I will be the judge for the best idea, and there will be a prize. What the prize will be I don't know, but I'll determine that later.

      Oh yeah.  I am listening to music while blogging in Mom's office. Life can't get simpler.  Last friday I went rock climbing. The first time I climbed up a wall I was practicly underwater in sweat. I was so freaked out.  Then I got to swing down from the wall on a harness and that was really fun.  Then I got a drink of water and tried again on a different wall.  On that one I made it to the top without a drop of sweat on my head or any other place of my body.  Then we had some pizza and went home.  When Dad asked me why I was sweating and I asked him if he would be sweating if he were 15 feet above the ground with a harness that didn't look secure.  I once heard of a story about some guy who wanted to be the president of the United states. He had to write a really long report on politics and stuff.  Then they would give him like $5,000 for some reason.  Then the press asked for the report and there was nothing.  Now apparently they gave him the money before he wrote the report and he ran away with it  :)D

      Politics  I was having a discussion with mom about politics. I think Steven Harper is just STUPID. All the impressions I've got of him through the media have not been favourable to him. Yesterday he was promising that if he was elected primeminister that he would lower our taxes to lower than the taxes in the United States.  Paul Martin retaliated at this, and told him it was a bad idea, and then--in my opinion--Steven harper acted very immature, and said that the Liberal partys slogan should be 'tax me i'm canadian'. Do taxes kill canadians? The simple answer is NO. Taxes are the way the health care and the public school system get money to work properly. If we didn't have any taxes we would have to be like the U.S. and have to pay for all or our health care. How on earth is he planning to afford this? He's making a load of promises he can't keep.  As for the leader of the NDP (New Democratic Party) definitely DO NOT vote for him. He is even worse than Steven harper. Yesterday he was making a bunch of promises, which, if he could keep them would be greatly beneficial to canadian society. Of course though his closing statement for the day went something like this. "I don't promise I know how I will finance all these promises, but if my party is elected I promise we will come out with a balanced budget." How thick can you get?   People may be very nice, and sympathise with every cause that canadians have, but really, you can't afford everthing. Steven harper can't afford to lower taxes especially in the maritimes. What would our premiers do? They get all their money for health care and education from the taxes. (Thats the way it works in the maritimes). They already are short on money. After the flooding last year, and then hurricane Juan, and then White juan they had to somehow pay for all the damage. I mean COME ON THINK!  Jack Layton (ndp leader) cannot afford all the promises he is making. If the Ndp gets into power either they will not keep any of the promises, or they won't have a balances budget.   Anyway the moral of the story is Politicians are WEIRD, and steven harper and Jack Layton need to think more about things. THat is why if I was old enough to vote (YOu have to be 18 and I am only 12) I would vote for paul martin. THat is just my opinion.

      As most of you know, matthew has decided to change his name to steve. What nobody knew until today was that matthew has also decided to formulate a new look for his new name. I just found this out tonight when he walked out of the bathroom with his hair spiked and a sweatshirt with a zipper zipped all the way down thus exposing his cheast. He looks like a someone from central america with the vests on and nothing else. He also made a dance for his steve look which involves him sort of doing a little "I'm going to stick out my cheast and my butt in rythym" dance, and then slipping very realistically and falling down. I know he falls down on porpose though because he demonstrated the dance about 10 times, and he always fell down. Now I really don't like it that he has renamed himself Steve. I miss MATT!

      I just cut a hole in my sock.   Actually I didn't cut it personally--I was walking around, and it snagged on the baseboard heater and ripped a hole in it. Do any of you people have any funny sock stories?  This is my funny sock story. Here, at home, the floors are always really dirty. On a good day I will get only a little bit of gunk on my socks, but there will be crumbs, and on a bad day the bottoms will turn  BLACK . I wear white socks. Anyway, this means that by the end of the day my socks are filthy. So, when I went to montreal and ottawa i was AMAZED at how clean the floors were. Anyway, I was wearing my usual socks when I was in Montreal, and I changed them every day. Then we got on the train from Montreal to go to ottawa. THat night when I was at my Grandmothers house I was taking off my socks so that I could go to bed, and I noticed that they were completely clean. "Hmmm" I thought "It would be fun to be able to wear my socks for 2 or 3 days in a row." So I did. Then didn't get sweaty, because I don't get sweaty feet, and they stayed clean. In the end I wore them for 4 days. They went through 4 cities. First I wore them in Montreal. Then I wore them in Ottawa. Then I wore them in Frederiction, and finally I wore them in Halifax. After a day in halifax they had to be changed. I also went through Trois Riveres, and a bunch of other towns with those socks on. They are a pair of very special socks.   When I got back, I called my friend to tell her all about my trip. When I was finished telling her everthing I finally said "And I got to wear my socks 4 days in a row!"   "Nice"   was her sarcastic answer. Am I just crazy????!

      Well today wasn't so good.  WE started off the day by going to church and then we went home with matt/steve whining because he didn't get any cookies.  I really don't want Matt to be steve because everybody's personality fits with their name.  From my personality you would guess that my name is Dan. We had lunch and practicly did nothing for the afternoon.  Dad's protective coating was fun to play with after a while. We read   The home ranch with mom on the couch. It is my bedtime and I know that this is a short blog so by!!  Dan

      I feel like I am not blogging enough.  Today I sitting on the couch wrapped in a blanket because it was so cold. I was having a good time warming up all by myself until a few bored kids came and wrecked my few moments of silence. Thinking of a way to get rid of them I told them that my blanket was a protective coating and I was an M&M. I warned them that if they got too close it would swallow them whole. It took me all of two seconds to realize how bad a mistake that was. For the next hour they pulverized me and my protective coating proved virtually useless against their onslaught. But it was fun.

      I haven't blogged in a while, and so, seeing as it is sunday, and cloudy, and mom and dad have banished us from the main level, I thought this would be a great time.   On sundays I am always bored, and there is never anything to do. I don't know why this is, but its true, and so sunday is my least favorite day of the week. This morning we went to church, which fit the boring part of sunday quite well, and other than that nothing has happened to me today.   Matthew has decided to change his name to Steve. I don't know why, and nobody likes it. Last night when we were doing our high and our low--that is when we say the best thing that happened to us in the day, that is the high, and the worst thing that happened in the day, that is the low--over the dinner table, and all the kids except for matt said that their low was that Matthew changed his name. This caused matthew to start to cry, and Mom and dad both had to say that it was their high that he had changed his name, and have him sit on their knee for a little while.   I still don't like the name steve.  Call me insensitive if you like. But hey, at least its better than Peter Chickens.  Also my attitude of boredness is not helped by the fact that I ran out of books to read yesterday, and the library isn't open until tuesday, and I'm not sure there will be any books there on hold for me then. I sincerely hope so.   Anyway, no more news, so I will sign off here...

      Matt has changed his name to Steve. He says it is OK sometimes to call him Matt because Matt is his nickname. We are game to play along, but it doesn't seem quite right. We've had 6 years to come up with playful alternatives to Matthew - Matt, Mattie, Matt-Batt, Mathie, etc. Now we feel at a loss with Steve - Steve-o? Isn't that the guy from Jackass? No that won't work. Stevie? Like Stevie Wonder? That's no good. I think you get the picture.  Matt/Steve has a favourite sweatshirt but he noticed the other day that it said "Made in USA" on it. Since he is a proud Canadian he found some fabric markers & scribbled out the USA. He also is anti-graffiti so he made large "No graffiti" graphics all over the shirt. At first I thought they looked like "No Sponge Bob Square Pants" logos, but my hopes were dashed. He also had me write "President of the Boys' Club" on the arm. This shirt is quite the site to see. He was so proud of it he wore it for 3 days (this is not to mention the days he wore it BEFORE decorating it). Then Sammy disappeared & came down to show me HIS t-shirt that he had decorated. I was telling him how proud I was of it, how nice it looked, what a good artist he was. Then I turned around & said under my breath to Katelyn "Go and get the fabric markers & hide them". I had visions of all MY clothes getting decorated.

      At the library I noticed "Esquire" mag had a picture of a nude woman, wearing only a snake & a hand carefully placed over her nipples. Then I noticed GQ had a woman wearing only a bikini bottom with her hand placed carefully over her nipples. I decided to make a complaint. My rationale is that kids walk past these mags, and I don't think children should be viewing nudity in a publicly-funded library. I also am personally alarmed by the objectification of women. So I was passed from one staff to another until the Children's librarian told me that this was the Branch Manager's responsibility. (He of course, wasn't in) I had to fill out an official complaint form, etc. A win-win solution I proposed was keeping these magazines behind the counter so adults can ask for them if they want to read them. The Children's librarian brought me over a Cosmo magazine & said one of the problems with censoring is where do you draw the line. Hmmm... I thought. On the Cosmo cover the woman is wearing a top & bottoms. How about we draw the line when they aren't wearing any clothes? Or how about the librarian just use common sense - perhaps think about what they would want their own kids to see? She also told me that personally she found wrestling magazine covers offensive. I was discussing my complaint with Dan. He said he could understand that the librarian didn't like the wrestling mag cover because he had seen another mag cover where a male wrestler was choking a female wrestler with one hand & holding a tire iron ready to strike in the other hand. Hmmm ... yes I thought. My kids really do have good heads on their shoulders. So this is my life ... mother by day, crusader against publicly-displayed pornography by night ...

      Ok, first off, somebody is having a birthday today! HAPPY BIRTHDAY MELANIE!!!!!! (For those of you who don't know her, her nickname is platinum blonde, and we have a link to her blog on our page) Have a happy happy day! Oh, and please blog at some point.   It is a beautiful sunny day here in halifax, and the high is 21 degrees Celcius. Its about time too. For the whole month of April it rained. Every day. Ok, not every day, but 6 days out of a week.   Nothing really interesting has happened today, so this blog won't count. If something interesting happens though I'll keep you posted.

      Matthew told me that some kids at the park said that he didn't know anything. I asked him if he did know something and he said that he did. So I asked him why they lied. He said with a wide grin, "They didn't know I am a restaurant owner!" I'm beginning to wonder if he actually thinks he IS a restaurant owner. He said it with such pride.  Anyhow, back to raising kids ...

      Ok, so today has been a very eventful day. Today I have a band concert, and so there was a bus that was going to take us to the rehearsal. My teacher said that the bus would come around 11:15 and to be there at 11:00 just in case. So, I decided I would come at 10:55 just to be safe. So anyway, I am walking down to road to the school, and it is 10:45, and the bus drives past me. I must confess I said a bad word, and immediately started running like mad. If I had continued walking I would have got there at 10:55 like I'd planned. So anyway I ran and ran, and got there just as everyone was getting on the bus. There were only six people coming to the rehearsal from our band, and then we picked up 8 more people from another school. We were 14 people, and we had a WHOLE bus. Lets just say things weren't too crowded. At all. Anyway we got to the place alright, and everything else went as planned. Although by the end my flute was dripping all over the floor (anybody who plays the flute know what this is like, and a good many other instruments do it too).  When I got home, I ate lunch, and Dan said "Ok, I'm going to take a shower today." I said "Sorry but Its my shower day, and I was planning on taking one this afternoon" Then Dan goes "Well we missed 2 showers in a row" I said "Well too bad, its my shower day, and I stink." Even though I didn't notice it Matt had been creeping toward my chair, and in the middle of my tirade I suddenly felt this sting on my arm. Matt had slapped me. He immediately launched into his own tirade about how I always took their shower days and how I could have a shower whenever I wanted too. Now readers, you must understand, none of this is true. Matt and Dan are constantly missing their showers, I am in no way taking their showers away from them. And that slap hurt too.

      Our upstairs sink was clogged so I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to teach Dan a little about plumbing. I told him to gather all the equipment, which he did, and then got him to unscrew the cap and the bottom of the p-trap (which is where the clog usually is). He did this without any problem. Then I told him to stick his fingers up the pipe and pull out all the hair and gunk that was causing the clog. He resisted saying it was gross, but finally stuck his fingers into the slime and started to pull out the offending particles. Once they started coming out the smell almost caused him to barf. He jumped up and ran for the toilet complaining that the job was gross and he didn't want to continue. I asked him what he was going to do when he grew up and had a wife and kids and had to do this on his own. His reply: "I'll get my wife to do it!"  After finishing the job we found the main reason for the clog. It was a 2p coin from the mother land. Those things are almost as big as out Canadian quarters. Why do they make 2ps anyway? Aren't pennies bad enough? Karen, Debs, any thoughts?

      So this is my mother. She does not want me to embarrass myself in front of a bunch of people wearing a pair of Black (coloured in, but black) pants, when I am one of about 30 or 40 other flutes (i am not exaderating, thats how many my music teacher said would be there) but she never said anything when I was right in the middle of the first row, (i.e. right in the centre, where people usually look.) at the christmas concert. I mean really. (My mom says I always make her out to be the bad guy. Is this true?) Anyway, I am very happy that we found a nice black skirt, and it was rather nice of her to take me to frenchys. You have no idea how many skirts I tried on. One of them had no slit, and it was very tight, and I tried to take one step to take it off and i fell over. So I will be all decked out, for the concert, with a wrinkle less blouse for once. (see moms blog)   Also THE CRY IS UP FOR THE GUESTBOOK COLOURS TO BE CHANGED! HELP THE CAUSE. SEND IN YOUR PETITIONS AND SLANDER OF MY DAD, WHO'S OBSESSION WITH POO BROUGHT ABOUT THE er BROWNNESS OF OUR GUEST BOOK.

      Just for the record I did take Katelyn to Frenchies this afternoon & buy a very nice black skirt. Now I just have to buy an iron to get the wrinkles out of her blouse and Katelyn will be ready for her big band concert. Sammy pleaded with us to bring him back a Bob the Builder movie from Rogers video. He is also very upset that his diapers are running out & so now he has to wear big boy underpants. He doesn't like change. He is still wearing his winter coat AND a big wooly hat whenever we go outside.

      I took Matt on a date tonight and I heard the first signs that Deep Sea Chicken may be running its course. He was talking about his new company TV & C (Trucks, Vans and Cars). He is building a Water Cruiser, the first in what I am sure will be a long line of vehicles that we only wish we had. He also seemed obsessed with graffiti so he is designing a texture that will cause the graffiti to fade in the night and disappear. Interesting mind on that kid. I must go because the owner and founder of TV & C awaits his "SUPER POLICEMAN - That's me" story.

      Matt met a man on our hike yesterday & asked him if he would like to work at Deep Sea Chicken. The man asked, "What is the retirement package like?" After a thoughtful silence Matt replied, "the retirement package is like a party." Even though it was only 9 C because the hike was right on the ocean, we all got sunburns.

      Its sunday. Its cloudy. Its such a boring day. but I do have some things that I can write in here.  I have a band concert, and the band uniform is a white top and black bottoms. I have this pair of black jeans, and I wore them to the last concert, where I realized that they aren't really black anymore. They're grey. Dark grey, but definitely grey. So anyway I've been looking around for something black that I can wear to the concert, only I haven't found anything. So what I have decided to do is colour my pants back in with a black fabric marker. Aren't I brilliant? Of course it will take me at least 3 hours, and my fingers will be so sore by the end, and there will be no ink left in the marker, but thats preferable to going to the concert wearing grey pants don't you think? Mom thinks I am being ridiculous, and I guess I am, I mean why don't I go out to a trendy shop and buy something black for $200 dollars? The answer is readers, I don't know. Why can't I bring myself to spend $200 dollars--roughly the same amount of money that I would have to pay to go to montreal and back if I booked the flight early--but I can bring myself to spend 4 or 5 hours colouring in a pair of grey pants that I am growing out of anyway. Am I just crazy and abnormal and weird?   Please tell me, I have to know.

      I had an altercation with a nose hair this morning. Now my nose hurts. Katelyn pointed out that my hair is going gray - only it is the hair in my ears. I have serious hair problems. My hair is in decline where it should grow and prospers where it shouldn't. What's up with that?  We went for a long walk today by the ocean with the kids. We walked right by a nude beach, but there was no one there even though it was a sweltering 10 degrees celcius outside with bright overcast skies. Can you believe it? We've been here almost 7 years and we have not gone to the nude beach once! Sam is about ready to potty train. Maybe I'll take him there and let him run around in the buck someday.

      I've had a bad day so far.   I am lying in bed, and its almost 8:30, and sarah comes to the door and says "Katelyn, mom wants to know if you forgot about band today" I had. On fridays band starts at 9:10, and it takes me 20 minutes to walk there, so I had 20 minutes to brush my teeth, get dressed, eat my breakfast, and get out the door. Also I have the hiccups. So anyway, I do everything, and I even manage to do one of my chores, and I walk out the door, with moms rain jacket on because it is raining, and walk to school. It is so humid that by the time I get there I'm really really hot and sweaty. Anyway I get there, and then I MESS UP ON ALL MY PIECES that I could play perfectly on wednesday. And they aren't just little mess ups, I missed the part where i come in 2 times, and I couldn't find where the second ending was once. I guess to be fair though, I did do them ok the second time around. When I am walking home my hiccups come back, and they are driving me crazy.  A final note, we still need some pictures for our fans page, I don't know who has sent them in yet, because dad didn't tell me, but if you have not sent in a photo of yourself for our fans page you need to. Some people don't tell us they read our blog, and all you people have to send in a photo too, or else we'll dig through our embarrasing photo vault and find one for you.

      Well, today I have quite a bit of stuff to tell you guys.  Yesterday I was going to go for a bike ride, So I put my helmet on and quickly ran outside and down the stairs that led off our deck.  When I was getting my bike I noticed this splinter that was a inch long. Infact, it wasn't really a splinter; it was a piece of wood.  Dad came and got it out with a pair of tweezers. It is still bleeding a little bit.  Yesterday we went and watched Scooby-Doo 2 at the theatres.  Katelyn thought it was stupid but I thought it was pretty good.  Today is what I call toilet day. I was in the bathroom when my keychain fell of my neck and into the toilet.  I took it out  and washed it very well.  Then I really had to go so I went and when I picked up the toilet paper roll and it slipped out of my fingers and fell into the toilet.  Yikes!!!!!  So I took it out with mom's new tweezers (just joking)and put it into the garbage....  Anyway I have to finish my math now so See ya l8er!!  :)D

      Okay her comes a large blog. Yes it was very tragic that the tree was chopped down with a chainsaw.  Very tragic.  Me and Katelyn like to duel with sticks.  We hit each others sticks until one of the sticks are reduced to the size of a dagger.  We were not really careful and once Katelyn hit my stick so hard that a big piece cracked off and hit me in the head.  It hurt.  We were playing at York redoubt near a cliff and I nearly fell off.  The herd has spoken.  16 cows.  39 days.  1 moovivor.  Canadian tribe.  Outgraze. Outmilk. Outmoo.  Sorry I was just looking at a postcard with a parody for Survivor.  It is a postcard advertising, some milk company. Cows is what they call it.  They also have. The incredible bulk, which is a green cow with purple shorts. Or Bob the Bovine (Bob the Builder).  And Cowy Potter.  Guess what!  I am going to finish my math today!!!!!!!!  That is really great.  I guess I will to my math now!!!!

      did you know that I've written twice as many words as dan, and twice as many words as dad, and when you put all their words together I still have written more words. So I think it's safe to say that I definitely write more than the esteemed males in the family.   It is currently 9:20 and I was rudely woken up but the kids BLASTING a movie on our computer, I was quite annoyed, and now I'm just tired. Ok, so we have Jonathan and amanda and Aiden's picture (Did I spell aiden right?), for our fans page, but we are still missing: Aimee, Debsie, Abc... we are doing our best to find something with two noses for you, Hiltses, Tim and Deanna, yes you, Katie, we need a picture of just you, and anyone else that reads our blog that i don't know about.   Something very tragic happened yesterday. SOMEBODY CUT DOWN THE SHOWER TREE. We haven't made references to the shower tree before, but it was a fallen over tree at the park that was uprooted during hurricane Juan, and we would always climb it and sing shower songs (actually dan would sing shower songs, I would hunker down and hope nobody recognized me). So anyway we went to the park yesterday with the intentions of climbing the shower tree only to find that some guy with a chainsaw had come and chopped it into pieces. It is a very tragic happening, and we are all mourning for a tree that served us so well for a very short time, until it was sadistically cut down with a freshly oiled chainsaw.

      I am writing this at 8:23 am but was rudely awoken at 6 am. When the sun rises early so do our Matty and Sammy. There were problems again this morning with my soy-based ice cream. Sam was eating it, Matt tattled on him & asked me if I wanted him to punish Sam. Then Matt was eating it and Sam tattled on him. It is really my fault though since I didn't hide it. I also didn't hide my Denman chocolate bars. If you have never tasted these you must. My favourite flavour is orange but mint, hazelnut and raspberry are also great. I eat these chocolate bars because they don't contain milk. I USE them for stress relief, especially when Ron travels. It is much better than yelling at the kids - much cheaper than psychotherapy when they grow up.  Last week at soccer one of the dads was telling - well actually bragging that after a long day at work his wife asked what he was cooking for dinner for their 4 kids. He said he cooked chicken nuggets & corn on the cob. This seemed a very strange thing to say & I couldn't figure out why. Then I realized how strange this would sound coming from a woman. Can you imagine your mothers bragging, "Yeah, I cooked mashed potatoes, broccoli and meat loaf tonight. Last night I made a chicken stir fry, rice & salad". It just wouldn't happen. To be fair men probably think we women are crazy when we brag about the great deals we got. I had a conversation this week with a great woman. I said, "We went yard sailing & the kids got a keyboard and mouse for $2 &, I got a hockey bag for a buck." She replied, "I went to the Salvation Army & got a pair of capri pants, a nice shirt and a leather jacket all for $28 bucks". Come on blog readers ... write in with your comments about what things members of the opposite sex brag about, expecting a hero biscuit. You might want to make these anonymous if your spouse reads the blog.

      So how do you like our new and improved blog? Some of its new and improved features include profiles of me (Katelyn) Dan, Dad, and Mom. We are still working on getting some things working, so if something doesn't work check it back in a day or so. Also We have a new fans page. You click on the link, and then we have pictures and profiles of all our fans too. So far Melanie Beah, and Karen have sent in pictures, so I'm calling out to all you other friends. Jonathan and amanda, Hiltses, Aimee, Mibsey, and anyone else who reads our blog. We need you in our fans page. You hear that? WE NEED YOU.   Also do you guys have any suggestions for juicing up our blog further? If you do you can tell us in our guest book. I can't say we'll do all of them, but we would welcome your ideas!

      I juiced up our blog with Dan today. Katelyn was going to help but she went out with supermom instead. I'm sure she will have something to say about the changes we made. We still plan to make a page that honors you, our guests. Maybe tomorrow. Let us know what you think in the guestbook, but you'd better put on your sunglasses first.

      Ok, I've decided whether or not I like this new blogger setup. I've decided I like it, but I would prefer if everthing wasn't brown and white. I liked the old colour scheme much better.  Ever since blogger launched its new look, we have been thinking that our blog needed a fresh new look as well. So we have decided to give our blog a face lift. We haven't done it yet, so I'm going to have to help dad do it later, but I hope it will look really good.   Today I went to the library, which was fun, and sarah wore a half a soccer ball on her head, which everybody thought was very funny. Then it was raining again, so she let me wear it when we were all running out to the van. I tell you, half soccer balls work much better than umbrellas and ordinary rain hats. I'm thinking of buying one for myself.  As I said in the last paragraph, its raining again (sigh) and so I'm really ticked off. I mean, we had 4 days of sunny weather and I was just thinking maybe it would last when it started to rain again. It is supposed to be sunny tomorrow though.   In other news, actually there is no other news, and I'm sorry for this kind of boring blog, but rainy days kind of do that to me. If you have a serious complaint concerning my blogging lately let me know in our guestbook.

      Well hello.  My first activity of the day is blogging.  For my contest I will give a decorated washcloth to the winner.  ABC has to reveal herself/himself.  We are going to the library today.   I love the library.  It has books and books and books. We are going for a program.  I have decided that I like the new blogger update a bit better then the last one. Earlier this morning I was pillow fighiting with matt and sam.  Sam fell of the bed and started to blame Matt. Then out of the blue he blurted out.  DAAAAD!!  Matt hit me in the nuts! (Sammy said that). Dad laughed a little and we cracked up.  We are going to get new couches which really rocks because our older ones are torn up.  Outside is dull.  Our tent still hasn't blown off our deck and into Frank's yard like it did a couple years ago.  Luckily Frank didn't notice a huge green tent upside down in his backyard.  He was cutting trees down in his backyard and on of them nearly crushed Sam.  It fell into are yard and Mom screamed at him at the top of her lungs.  I had better go and do my math now  :)D

      I had a nice Mother's Day yesterday. Dan's coupon book was great -I have already taken up on two of his coupons - one was a foot rub, the other was 2 extra pages of math. On each coupon there was a little box to tick with "staff inicials". Katelyn bought me this furry sheep mother & baby. I love it. Sammy wants to pet it constantly. This morning he came into my room, looked around & said "where is your animal?". Sarah made little hearts out of construction paper & showered me with them before I got out of bed. Tonight Ron was looking for a warm & good looking hat to wear to soccer practice (it is still cold here - especially at night). He put on his old hat which just made me start to giggle. He said, "you don't like my hat do you". I said, "I thought your hat was fine until Debbie bought you a new one because THAT one made you look like a simpleton".   The kids current favourite CD is a live recording of Johnny Cash at San Quentin prison in 1969. It is actually a really great recording. One way he expressed his faith in God was to go where he thought Jesus would go - & that was into maximum security prisons. But he wasn't preachy or finger-pointing at all - he had great compassion & understanding of the living hell these guys were experiencing in jail. He even wrote & sang a song about it called San Quentin - accompanied by the enthusiastic cheers on the inmates. If you ask Danny nicely I'll bet he'll type the words on the blog for you ...   We also painted flags today on 7X9 canvasses from the dollar store. Katelyn made the flag of Italy, I did the flag of Denmark (I love the Danish people ... I'll tell you about it sometime). Matt made a flag of Dixie (southern US). Sammy used a lot of hot pink & purple & also painted his winter coat. Dan painted the Canadian flag & Sarah just couldn't bring herself to make a flag so she made a landscape. They look pretty cool.

      Well I have returned from Quebec city. I was gone for a little over a week and missed home every second I was away. I got home at 4:00am Sunday morning and found another male in my bed with my wife! I picked him up and he gave me a big hug and he told me that he loved me even though he was half asleep. Marsha said that she let him sleep with her because she needed his warmth. I think it was because she is trying to get close to the employee, owner and manager of Deep Sea Chicken.  Hopefully life will resume some form of normalcy now. No one is sick, I am home, our van has not broken down yet - and it is still clean (amazing) and the weather is starting to improve. We just need a week of this and all will be happy in Abarbaville with the Ababapirates all whistling Abarbatunes while typing in their Abarbablog.

      AHHHHHHHH!  I hate this new update...  Okay, Okay.  Yesterday was Mothers Day so I made a ticket book containing stuff like: Free Foot Massage, or Clean up Room etc....  We put a tent up in our backyard, so now we are eating under it and playing under it etc.  It is really easy to put up and me and Sarah knew exactly how to put it up off by heart.  1 1A 1.  2 2A 2. 3 3A 4.  That is the pattern that you have to know to put it up, and the rest is easy. We went ot York Redoubt yesterday.  It is pretty warm outside.  About 15º Celcius (I figured out how to do the º thing!).  I have to have lunch now!

      There is a new blogger setup AGAIN!! Just when i figured out how to make it go back to normal they "update" the entire system so I don't know anything about how to use it anymore. Also I liked the old colour scheme much better than this new brown peach and white one. Grrrrrrrrr!  We have had an unusual string of good weather lately. Because of this I have been spending most of my time outside, and not blogging and I have to say I'm very sorry.   my top news item is that I was offered a job being an assistant soccer coach for my brothers soccer team. I used to play on the team, but I got too old, so I've been promoted. The first practice is tonight, I really hope I can do a good job. Also I've been teasing my brother that i'll be in charge, and i'll do really mean things to him and stuff, but I'm just joking, and I made sure he didn't actually believe me.   The other day I burnt myself on my arm, the burn is about an inch long, and 3/4 of a centimetre tall, and it has started to blister today and it really hurts.   The other day we went yard saleing, something we do on saturday mornings in the spring, and it was FREEZING cold. Usually when it is that cold you get a really crappy yard sale day, but we did really well. I got some beads, and at one yard sale they had a klutz book (they are like kits) with all the stuff that came with it for $0.25. Considering it was $35 at chapters I pounced on it. I think that is the greatest deal I've ever come by, even at a yard sale.   Actually no, thats not true, dan found a keyboard and a mouse for 2 dollars at the same yard sale. Our computer downstairs needed both of them, because the kids had ruined them, and so dan bought them. Miraculously they both work well, and so we are all very happy.

      Katelyn has graciously agreed to make pancakes for lunch. She told me that when I made corn fritters last week she is pretty sure I was supposed to use corn meal and not do what I did - which was to add corn to a basic pancake recipe. She said the corn fritters I made tasted like poo. My question is: how does she know what poo tastes like?   Yesterday I spent a good few hours cleaning up the backyard & cleaning up my flower gardens. In the middle of this experience I suddenly realized that I HATE gardening. I am quite in love with the IDEA of gardening, but I actually hate doing the work. And this is at the beginning of the gardening season when gardeners are always full of wonder and delight. Check back with me in July ... I may be mixing cement or laying down sod to cover my gardens.  P.S. I'm sorry to disappoint all the Dutch readers of this blog ... I know the national past time of the Dutch is gardening. Please come over to my house & work some magic.

      If you have stickittodamaneosis then you would be dead right now.  I have converted my prize from a poem to a decorated washcloth.  If your poem is to embarresing then email it to me. AHH!  I have little itches all over my body.  We went to York Redoubt yesterday and rolled down the hills...  My pants twisted to one side and it was really hard to get them back into place.  But I love to roll down hills.  Oh man those public kissers were Disgusting.  One of them were throwing rocks and one of them almost hit me.  The girls both had TBS.  Tight Butt Sag.  That is went the pants are so tight that you can see where the buttcrack is.  They were smooching right on the playground equipment.  If we were playing grounders, I would have stepped on them.  Hey you know what?  Next time I see those people on the playground, I will play grounders.  I have to leave now  :)D

      Here I am sitting at the computer early in the morning with a thermometer rapidly assessing my body temperature. Am I sick? No, I am not sick, just at this moment facsinated with this piece of plastic that is unreasonably hard to keep under my tongue. I've had it in my mouth since about 10:30, I mean I've had it taking my temperature (aaaahhits falling out of my mouth!) since 10:30 but its taken multiple temperatures ranging from 97.2 to 98.4. Is my temperature spiking? Maybe I am sick. Maybe I have a rare blood disease called stickittodamaneosis that is charaterised by a spiking temperature, while never actually becoming a fever. Hmmmm.  Last night we were at the park by our house, and there were 4 people, 2 boys and 2 girls smooching and hugging and smoking. It was quite disgusting, I mean not that I have anything against some people kissing, but these people couldn't have even been in grade 10. Also they were doing it publicly, which was VERY rude seeing as there was a lady with a three year old and a baby using the swings. We thought it was so disgusting that we crossed the field and climbed the climbing tree and instead of using the playground equipment which the kissing people were occupying. We waited and waited for them to leave, but they didn't and so we eventually went home. It was funny though, both of the guys had Severe Acute Chronic Butt Sag , or Chronic Butt Sag, (it really should be chronic pant sag, but we like the word butt better.) CBS for short, and one of them was showing off and was hanging off the monkey bars and you could see a his... well his crack.   I think it is so stupid that CBSers wear those kind of pants, I mean really how far do you have to go to make your life miserable.

      This afternoon I told the kids we could go to York Redoubt once their schoolwork was done. So off we trooped.  They have hills there & the kids started rolling down the hills. Then they started saying, "Mom! Do it with us". I resisted at first but then gave in. Let me try to describe this to you. EVERYTHING was twisted ... my shirt, my pants, my undies, my bra. Even some body parts were twisted. Afterwards I felt sick - like sea sick. I think as you get older your body doesn't like to be twisted about anymore. But it WAS fun while it lasted. Sammy wanted me to hold hands with him while we rolled down the hill. He couldn't understand why this wouldn't work.   We met a couple of guys that work there. Wayne asked Sammy where he got his name. Sammy was playing with his finger & he said "from my finger". We all laughed very hard. Then Sammy hid behind Katelyn because he suddenly felt shy & couldn't quite put together why we were laughing.

      So I've been outed that I watch ER. Yes it is true. Katelyn & I each paid half to BUY ER on DVD - the second season. Although I became addicted to ER about in season 7, I did not watch the earlier seasons. So it is both excellent entertainment AND helps me see the development of the characters. (PLEASE remember, dear readers that ER is not a soap opera. It is a evening drama program.) Now admittedly I think it is real. Ron argues with me that it is a fictional program but I, Debs & Melanie know the truth. It is real. I would trust these fine doctors with my life. Last night we watched this episode where Doug Ross saves a kid from drowning - his leg is stuck in a grate inside a culvert during heavy rains. It was the MOST intense episode I think I have ever watched. I was hiding my head under the covers, curling up into a fetal position, hiding behind Katelyn, etc. I even found myself saying "please Jesus, save the boy". That's when I knew I had gone over the edge into insanity. OK OK really I know it isn't real. But I did notice that Noah Wile, who plays Dr. John Carter, does extensive work with "Doctors without borders" (in real life). Obviously he too is confused & thinks he is a real doctor.  Sarah is sitting beside me working on a little grammar book where she has to fill in the blank from a list of compound words. For instance, "I felt __________ that I was safe". She said to me, "I can't stand these pages. If these types of pages are going to go on throughout the book I am going to be really stressed out". Ooh, the pressure. I wonder if you can get stress leave for Grade 2. What would that look like exactly?  This morning we went hiking at Long Lake - a provincial park near our house. Despite my repeated warnings Sarah, Dan & Matt went in this little river there. Matt even crossed a small dam before I caught up to them. But then he got scared & fell INTO the water on the way back over the dam. He got his pants wet but didn't really complain. Three hours later after lunch I noticed he was still wearing the wet pants. Then I found a big puddle of water on the floor near his rubber boot. So he had actually been walking around with his feet completely submerged in water but didn't say a word to me. THIS my friends is the advantage to having messy kids. They are very low maintenance. In fact a few years ago when I was hospitalized before Sam's birth they wore the same clothes for a week, didn't wash their faces & didn't comb their hair. (And yes of course they didn't take baths). My dear 60-something friend Margot consoled me by saying, "It won't reflect badly on you. Anyone that sees them will know it is a man that is taking care of them". As you can probably guess Ron is pretty low-maintenance too. Never has he requested that I (or we) clean up the house. Nor has he ever demanded to know why his shirts were wrinkly. We really have to think when someone comes over to our house & asks to borrow the iron & ironing board. Hmmm... we say. Where might we have put them?

      Although it is annoying this is getting pretty comical! Usually wednesday is band day, and usually there is actually band, but lately I've been going and there isn't anything. There wasn't anything on friday, and 4 or 5 times before that they've had it canceled, but I walked in and there wasn't any band, so I'm a bit peeved. Its not their fault though I suppose, because tomorrow there is a play, and so they were getting the stage in the gym ready. (We have band in the gym.) So actually this time there was a good reason for it.   anyway I was reading dans blog from last night, and I think thats a great idea for a contest. Here is the contest.   In the guestbook I would like you to recite a song that you made up in the shower. LISTEN!!!! Everybody ignored me on my last question; the one about the 2 trains and the crow. Now.   Details:   Rule #1: Abarbablog members cannot participate   Rule #2: You have to make it up when you are in the shower   Rule #3: If you recieve any hints from anybody else you will be disqualified   Hint: Showers are not for washing up; they are for fun!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Just sign your poem in the guestbook.   The prize is my poem by email.   SHOWERS RULE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Also so instead of dan's poem I have an even better prize idea that I will tell dan. Hurry to submit your shower songs today. I've never actually made up a song or sang one in the shower, but I've heard dan do it so how hard can it be? I mean really.   Its sunny again, and I'm not sure how long it will last. I hope it lasts a while. Its glorious.

      So here is my blog for the day.   We went to the park and and had a little bit of fun.  There was a bulldozer there that nobody was driving in so we climbed in the big shovel in the back of the backhoe and pretended that we were little beggars sleeping in a garbage can.  I don't have much to say so let me think for a second..........  >  >>  >>>  >>>>  >>>>>  >>>>  >>>  >>  >  Okay we went to Long lake (A lake).  Mom froced me to wear rubber boots which really bugged me because I HATE RUBBER BOOTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  But anyway we went to the park and I could change into normal shoes.

It is fun to sing in the shower.  Here is my funkiest contest.  In the guestbook I would like you to recite a song that you made up in the shower.  LISTEN!!!!

      Ok, the highlight of my day was SURPRISE!!! Beah got her prize package. In case some of you don't know, Dan once had a contest to figure out how many e's there were in a certain paragraph. If you got it right then you would win a surprise prize package, meaning that the prize inside was a surprise, not the fact that you would get a prize. Anyway Beah won the contest and so me and dan decorated 2 pairs underwear (why do you call underwear a pair of underwear, and call pants a pair of pants, but you don't call a t-shirt a pair of t-shirt) Anyway we decorated them in very bright colours and took them in the post office and mailed them. For those of you who don't read the guestbook here is beah's entry.  Name Beah  Email yikes@underwhere?  Comments haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhahhhaa, this weekend, to my shock and horror ;), I received my prize for the "E contest"!! I laughed so hard, I love it! For those of you reading this that don't know what my prize from Dan and Katelyn was, it was two pair of undies. But not just any pair of undies, brightly colored and decorated undies. The kind of pair you could never lose. Very conveintly they have my name printed all over them so I know that they are mine. Also, as to not leave Phil out, the undies had salutations to him as well! My favorite part was when Phil handed me the package and I pulled out the undies and he had this look like, "who is sending my wife underwear in the mail!!!!" It was priceless, I then very quickly told him who they were from and the story of the 'E' contest. He laughed too. Anyway, Thank you Dan and Katelyn for my prize that you obviously worked very hard on and thank you also for putting a smile on my face!   One word of caution though beah, we didn't have proper fabric markers so we used normal permanet ones, so don't wash them too much or they will fade significantly. You could try wearing them over some other undies, or hanging them up on your living room or bedroom wall. (Living room would be best though.)  My low is that 5 out of 7 days are rainy here. I'm starting to reconsider coming to vancouver. I am so sick of everybody, and being stuck in this house, and i think everybody is sick of me, and being stuck in the house, and I've been fighting a lot with sarah, and WHY IS GOD SO SAD ANYWAY???? I mean you would think he would stop crying after a month or so. Or he would move it somewhere else, jupiter for example. I bet Jupiter hasn't felt a drop! Its so unfair.

      This is Marsha writing. Yesterday I had an emotional meltdown when I went to the Environment Canada weather site & found out that it was going to rain not only Monday (yesterday) but today and tomorrow too. I don't think I would be exaggerating to say that in the last month 2 out of 3 days have been raining. Maybe it is only 1 out of 2 days -I don't know but it seems to rain a lot. My only consolation is that my friend Debbie says it is mostly always raining in England. No wonder the Royal Family always looks so happy when they are in Australia, Canada, etc. Perhaps this is the REAL reason they are always going on tours of other countries. Perhaps this is why England has spent a good part of their history colonizing other nations - just looking for a bit of sun.  So I hate parenting on rainy days at the best of times, but with Ron gone again this week I had great plans of taking the kids hiking every day. But it is not really possible to hike in the rain. So last night I made corn fritters for supper at Sarah's request - because we had read about them in a book. They weren't very good at all. I just used a regular pancake recipe & added corn but I think next time I'll follow a real recipe.  This morning I asked Sam if he had a poo. After a pause he said slowly, "No-o-o. Not really" (he did). Then I asked him if he had had breakfast. "No-o-o" he replied, "Yes. Brownies and ... brownies". Now when I had my first child I would be horrified if they ate a sweet for breakfast. But now I don't mind. They usually have pop tarts, magic charms or honey comb or Tim Horton's donuts. Just kidding - they usually have toast or oatmeal but hey - the truth is I forgot to give them the brownies for dessert last night & it is a bonus if they have all day to get the chocolate out of their system.  So here is an art question for all you artistically gifted people out there. Please keep in mind that I am a non-artist but I do have a desire to learn. I was thinking about working with the kids to make a gift for our friend Randy that says "We love Randy" with maybe a child-made picture of her. I was thinking of doing it in blocks - painting 4 different squares of colour & then putting a word or image in each block. So it would make sense to use acrylics to do the picture of her & background colours, right? But what about the lettering? How would you do it. I really can't draw the letters but I could print something off from the computer & use tracing paper. But would you use a permanent marker? Would that work or do you have other suggestions? Also, where can you buy tracing paper? I was thinking about using a acrylic-primed canvas that I bought at the dollar store to put it on. Would that work? SEE can you guys see how insecure I am about this? I almost want someone to hold my hand through the process! THANKS ARTSIES!!

      I was just thinking how Matt thinks sex is about.  Once about a year ago Dad called Matt to him.  This is how it went.  Dad: Matt, do you know where babies come from. Matt: No Dad: Do you want to know? Matt: Okay Dad: Well the Man takes some seeds and puts it in the Women and then the seeds sprout and makes a baby.  And then the Baby comes out. (Dad made no remark on where the seeds came from). Matt: Cool!  Well this is only the beginning  About 1 month later, mom is reading a book on turtles. Mom is reading the book.  Mom: The mom turtle has her kids and then they find their way back to the sea! Matt:  Where do the seeds come from? Mom: I don't know. Matt: Oh, I know.  They come from the belly button! Mom: They do? Matt: Yeah!  That is how all men have outies and all women have innies!! Mom: Cool Matt: Yeah!  So the seeds come out the outies and go into the innies!  Mom runs to Dad wondering why Matt knows all this stuff.  This leads to some questions that don't get asked by any normal person. Like.  Why do you not have kids? or Why can't you have kids? There is three answers that might work.  Answer No 1.  My belly button is to small  Answer No 2.  I don't have a belly button  Answer No 3.  I have an outie.   YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!  I managed to survive Sunday School! While everybody was shaking hands Me and Katelyn snuck out the door and ran to Tim Hortons.  We had a nice time.  When we came back to church and they were serving cake.  I cannot resist cake.  The fourth graders were swarming around the cake.  I said to myself: Nope.  So I went up to Mom and yelled in her ear:  THE PLACE IS SWARMING WITH FOURTH GRADERS!!!!  Mom laughed and I felt like a baby so I went and grabbed some cake. AHHHHH!!. I am standing right behind my Sunday School teacher. Better leave!  Steve Bell (One of my favorite singers) is coming to town and he is going to play at our church!  They are selling tickets to see the concert.  Our friend  Wally Schlech got me and Katelyn Tickets.  So now I am so happy!!!!!  Was this blog long enough!  :)D

      Alright, I'm blogging. I have no really good excuse for not blogging in the past couple days, except that mom got mad at me for not doing good blogs, and so I need to wait until I have enough good things to write about, so l obviously couldn't blog.  Matthew and me just had a big discussion, it started off like this:  Matthew: Katelyn are there bad words in the blog Me: No, I don't think so Matt. Dan told me there were bad words in the blog. Me. What bad word matt? Matt: I can't say it  Me. Dan, what bad word was it? Dan: The one that means pee Matt: Who said that? Me: I think it was Melanie. Matt: Oh no, I'll have to fire her Me: Well you don't have to do that matt Matt: Yes I do Me: Why? Matt: Because she might go around in the restaurant and say bad words to people Me: well she wouldn't if you told her not to Matt: Well she might, thats why I have to fire her Me: (Grasping at straws) Well she didn't say the bad word in our blog, she said it in hers.  Matt: So she didn't say the bad words in our blog?! Me: No she didn't Matt: Well maybe I won't fire her. Me: Thats good matt she'll be really happy  So melanie you better watch your mouth, (or persuade dan not to tell his six year old brother that you swore.)  On friday I went to a soccer field to play soccer, and there is a small clif at one end that you can climb up, and we always do, and once dan had to go pee, and so we forged through the prickly bushes until we found a large rock that dan proceeded to urinate on. (I wasn't looking). Ever since we've called it planet of the pee monster. Anyway it was the first time that we were at the place since hurricane juan, and after we had forged through all the prickly bushes, and there was a pine tree that had fallen right across the path. It took us forever to get over it, and forever to get back over it, and in the process I got some superb scratches all over my legs.

      That gargantual blog was by MARSHA, not RON. I'm not sure why it came up with Ron's name but believe me it was me who took the kids hiking for 3 hours & me who is the author of SUKI WUKI. Cheers, MARSHA

      Today it was sort of dull and grey so I took the kids for a hike at Kearny Lake (one of the many lakes in Halifax - don't hate us because it is a beautiful city). I got a guide book for 25 great hikes for kids in the greater Halifax area - so this was our first. So we started off & the kids were loving it. There was hardly a trail - but there were fluorescent ribbons to guide us on the path. There were uprooted trees to climb over or under, large puddles to avoid, trailblazing through thick underbrush in some areas & lots of spongy bogs. We realized that the book was published pre-Hurricane Juan so we really needed post-Juan update. Dan said the trail had been "Juanised". Eventually it got too wet - the 3 younger kids had rubber boots on so they didn't care. Danny really wanted to go on but since he was wearing brand new running shoes & I didn't want to get MY shoes wet I insisted that we turn around. I also thought the writers of the book were a bit naive to classify this as an easy hike. We met some dog ladies (meaning women with dogs, not women who looked like dogs). They were lovely people & I showed them the book & the map. They explained that we were not on the right path & showed us how to get to the right one. However, on close examination that path was quite wet so we abandoned that trail & went instead to our old stomping grounds the "Frog Pond" (where there are no frogs, only ducks). We had a lovely time,  especially wading in the pond. Matt & Sam got their socks wet despite their rubber boots, but this didn't really bother them. When we got back home Katelyn, Danny & Sarah went to the park. All told, we had 3 hours of hiking plus 30 minutes of park time today. Ahhh ... they should sleep well.  We are reading a great book called "Man of the Family" by Ralph Moody - it is autobiographical & is about Ralph's life in Colorado around 1911. His father died & he is "Man of the Family" at age 11 - the oldest boy in a family of 6 kids.   So they are just getting by financially when 5 of the kids come down with the measles. The writer explains that with the doctor's bills they have more bills than money in the bank. When I read this, Dan got very angry. "Doctors CHARGING to heal people??" I stopped reading & explained about Tommy Douglas, the CCF, & Canada's socialized health care system, how in Ontario each person pays a monthly amount but in Nova Scotia the money is taken from the taxes you pay either in HST or income taxes. I explained how America does not have this system so if you are poor & have no health insurance you sometimes cannot afford medical care. We all agreed that this isn't fair - that the poor are the ones that 'do without' instead of how our system works here where everyone contributes & if you are too poor you still get the best medical care because everyone that CAN contribute does. It was a beautiful teachable moment. But the best line from Dan was, "so when I pay 5 cents tax on Juicy Fruit, I'm actually saving lives".   Matt & I have settled into a cute little bedtime routine. After I put Sammy to bed I turn on the heating pad for Matt. Then we snuggle together while I read him a random book PLUS his favourite "Bernie drives a truck" - but I have to do it in "crazy" which means changing all the words around in a crazy way which makes him giggle. (For instance, Bernie checks all ten tires to make sure they are FLAT before driving his truck on the highway) OR I tell him an on-going made up story about forest animals starring an elephant named "Suki Wuki" who tonight became a peanut farmer in South Carolina where all dialogue involved the words "You all" in a thick southern accent. At harvest time he invited all his forest friends to a party - Wally Bally, Colin Bolin, Squirly Wirley, Alexander the hound dog, Wuki Suki (Suki Wuki's mother), Mary Barry, Faithey-Waithey, etc. Suki Wuki dressed up as a very large peanut at the party & was dancing to Mexican music, but kept falling down onto the dance floor because he couldn't move his legs in the peanut costume. Being a very large elephant it took ALL his friends to pick him up. Of course this story involved sound effects in the form of Mexican music, me falling down repeatedly on the bed imitating Suki Wuki's dance floor face plants, etc. If you are thinking this doesn't make a lot of sense, you are right. However, Matthew thinks it is VERY funny & giggles while sucking on his fingers.

      This is about Hmm-Hmm again. I think I mentioned what we tell the kids when they they ask the famous question, "Where do babies come from?" For those who can't remember we tell them that the man has special seeds and when he and his wife wants a baby he takes one of these special seeds and puts them in a special pocket that his wife has. Then a baby starts to grow. Kind of like gardening. This usually puts an end to the question when they are young.  We told Matt this a while ago and he has been silent on the matter ever since.  In the evening towards supper time Matt starts to get a little hyper and cranky because he is tired. As I was making supper he came into the kitchen to declare that he figured out how the seed gets to the woman. He went into great detail about how you need a man with an outie belly button and a woman with an innie belly button. The outie needs to fit into the innie and then the seed can jump into the womans belly. Then he decided that his explanation was unclear and proceeded to show me using his outie! He walked up to Sarah and lifted up her shirt and began to try to insert his belly button into her. Sarah wisely would have none of that. I was just on the floor laughing. I had to break the news to him that he was close - but not right. I wonder what his mind is going to dream up next.  Then as I was serving dinner Matt was cranky and Dan was pelting me with questions. One was, "Dad, what is the dumbest animal?" I said it was the sheep and he said it was the chicken. We argued for a few minutes about it. Then I went to hand Matt his dinner plate, but he would not take it. His head was down and he seemed extremely troubled. I was beginning to loose my patience with him so I told him to take his plate (I started to count - which he knows is means I mean business). Then he sat in front of his plate and said emphatically, "Guys! It's not right to make fun of CHICKENS!" We all had to appologies!

      Our friend Debbie from England arrived yesterday. Today Debs & I had a girls day out - something I have been planning for a few months. We got a massage, watched a movie, window shopped & went out for dinner at Jane's on the Commons - a new hightly-acclaimed restaurant. Debs had a butter chicken with curry. I had salmon which was quite raw. When I told them the waiter said, "that is the way we cook the salmon here". I suppose he could have thought I was a tourist who didn't know how to cook salmon. In fact I cook salmon all the time and know that when it looks raw and tastes raw it is not cooked. Once they cooked it, it did taste quite good.   Ron had been home with the kids all day so I ordered him a "coconut cream pie in a short bread crust". He is a great guy.

      Okay, the election. Well as most of you know there are 308 seats in canada. You have to win 155 of them to form a majority government. Very few people were expecting a majority government, and everybody was expecting it to be either conservative or liberal. They were right. The Liberal party won 135 seats, the conservative party won 99 seats, and the New Democratic Party won 19 seats. (I am using full party names for the people reading who aren't from canada, or never pay attention to politics). A lot of people were surprised that the conservatives didn't do better. At one point in the evening it looked like the liberals and the ndp could form a coalition, but that changed.  I am very happy with the election results. Minority governments aren't usually good things, but it shows that we are giving the liberals another chance to get it right. They will be under a lot of pressure to keep their promises and be a "clean" government, and if they don't keep their promises, or if they have another scandal we can always vote in a new government.   I am glad that it is a liberal minority though, because, however much I would like a clean government, I don't want to build up our military, and I don't want to cancel the kyoto accord. I mean, if they cancelled the kyoto accord, and used the money to, maybe feed the poor, or increase foreign AID (not military for iraq) then maybe I could see myself agreeing. But i really think that canada is a peace loving country, and I don't see why steven harper (leader of the conservative party) wanted to build up our military.   Of course the liberals have a bad reputation. They have had massive scandals, and they have not kept their promises to canada. So the only reason that I supported the Liberals in the first place was because I didn't agree with many of the things that steven harper wanted to do. But if the liberals have another scandal, you can be sure that I will be changing what party I would like to govern canada.

      So, today we cleaned ALL DAY!!!!!!!!!! This was in preparation for debbie getting here. I was in charge of her private suite (actually not so private, but there is a key lock on her door, and the only person she shares a bathroom with is me) and of the entire upstairs level. I had to clean all three bathrooms, tidy up and sweep the upstairs, make all the beds, make debbies bed, tidy up my room and move all the stuff in sarahs room so debs could stay there. I had to vacuum  both my room and sarah's/debbie's, and I had to take care of sam for a while. But it was all worth it, er sort of.   Just a note to karen... Hi!  I had to take care of sam when we were in the airport too, and we went up to a bank machine and pressed all the buttons. It was a lot of fun. Then finally Debs came through the doors, and we all went home. Now Debs and Mom and Dad have gone out to a restaurant and so i have to babysit. Blah.  Matt was asking her over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again if she brought any treats. Then dad got mad at him and so he can't have any treats tonight.

      Alrighty...  This morning we went to church and Dad was preaching.  I am going to give you an interview of what happened.  (everybody gets up to talk to each other)     Dan: Wow, that was the only sermon that I heard that I understood.  Katelyn: Great Dad, you preach at a fourth grade level.  Ron: Ha Ha Ha... (No, he really laughed)  Dan: Not fourth grade... fifth grade!  Ron: Oh yeah.  Anyway I had better go.  :)D

      Well, today we went to church and dad was the preacher. Me and Dan stayed upstairs during the service instead of going outside. So anyway, dad preached his sermon, which was good, and dan said to him afterward "Wow dad that is the first sermon I ever understood" then I said "Great Dad, now you're preaching at a fourth grade level!"  So after church we came home, and ate a quick lunch. After that we went to the beach. Mom said in her blog that the water was really cold, but it was actually really nice, and definetely much warmer then when we were last there. Also there was like a life guard training camp there, with about 40 life guards. They were having races in the water and stuff, and during some races we had to get out of the water which really ticked me off. But I swam across the lake and back 2 and 1/2 times aprox. and also treaded water for about fifteen minutes at a time.  Anyway we got home, and I had sand all over me, so I decided I would take a shower. The shower was nice, and then when I was done I remembered that I had take the towel that was in the bathroom to the beach. Momentarily at a loss of what to do, I looked around the bathroom. I was not at a loss of what to do for long. You see I spotted the electrical cord for the hairdrier. Me and sarah in our bathroom have a very small hairdrier that neither of us ever use. So I blow-dried myself dry. It took a long time because it was a very small hairdrier, but it definitely was better than letting myself drip dry.

      So Ron mentioned that he has been painting ... miraculously I managed to keep the kids outside for the entire day yesterday. We went hiking, to the library, to the grocery store, to 2 parks, we had picnics, went to Tim Horton's twice. We even found a librarian we know & gave him a ride home. He asked, "how long do you have to stay out ... until you run out of gas?". Yup. I have a terrible sinus cold which has made me tired & hard of hearing. I have to blow my nose about once every 2 minutes (I'm NOT exaggerating). So it was a pretty hard day yesterday. I also slept through thunder & lighting and a rain shower. I haven't been sleeping well for the past few months (a sign of aging I suspect) but the last few nights I've slept like a baby. It has been the kind of sleep where you wake up with your mouth open and a pool of drool on your pillow.   When we woke up this morning one of the kids realized that the side door of our van had been left open. Let's just say this didn't make Ron happy. Since it poured rain in the night it was quite wet in there. After church we went to Chocolate Lake for a few hours. It wasn't that warm but the kids still went in the water. Matt was telling stories about his restaurant & his army camp to the lifeguards. I heard him tell one guard, "anytime you see a GMC Safari parked in the parking lot, I'll be here to tell you stories". He charmed his way into a bag of potatoe chips. When Sam saw them he said, "Matt, where are MY chips". So they both headed over, batted their eyelashes & came back with some chips for Sam too. Last night at Tim Hortons they ordered 20 Timbits & the lady gave them 37. They are VERY charming. On the way home Sam started saying, "I'm Sam Dabarbanel". We thought this was very funny & kept asking him to say it over & over again. We can't figure out how he even made the connection that he had a last name.  Sam's toilet training is going well. On Friday night at soccer he peed his pants. When I asked him why he said, "there was no toilet". I explained that you can pee in the grass & showed him the stance. (I think I now understand why guy's backs go out. Standing in the pee position can NOT be good for your back). The only problem with Sam's outside position is that he insists on pulling his pants down. So you can be sitting watching a soccer game, minding your own business and suddenly there is cute little 3 year old bum staring you in the face. This morning when he pood on the toilet he said it was a hammer & he made it especially for Daddy.  Sam also picked some lupins (beautiful pink, purple & white wildflowers seen along roadsides in the Maritimes) I said that was enough but he said, "I need them to play princess". He held them & walked regally along as if he was in a royal procession. When he is 15 he is going to die from embarrassment from this story.

      It is 6:52 am on Sunday morning and I can't sleep. I appologies for the lack of blogging. The main reason is that I am painting so Marsha is keeping the kids out of the house. I am hoping that I will be done today, but I am worried that I will run out of paint so I will have to wait until Monday to finish. I want to be finished now!!  On Monday Debs will be coming to visit from England. So when we are talking and we want the kids to be absent, I will suggest that they blog. Stay tuned.  Nothing else to report. Sorry so boring!  Oh ... Matthew just woke up and wants to say a few words ...  I lost my pencil. Just a minute I have to go get my shirt on. [He yells from his room] NEVER MIND I FOUND IT! [Now he is back] I have a cough. The cough is bad. Mom passed it on to Sarah and Sarah got the cough. Then Sarah gave it to me. This is the end of my blog.

      This is Matthew writing. Here is the recipe for the secret ingredient at Deep Sea Chicken.  1. take some bacon and roll it up 2. put some sprinkles on it like the ones you get on sprinkle donuts at Tim Hortons 3. Cook the bacon. You can use a pancake grill or a George Foreman Grill 4. Put whip cream on top of the bacon roll ups 5. Wait 2 minutes for the whip cream to dry. 6. Then break open 2 packages of Bubbaloo bubble gum & squeeze the jam over top of the bacon roll ups  Eat them! The whip cream is this recipe will not make you fat.  Bacon roll ups are not available for take-out.  If you liked my deep sea chicken radio commercial you will love my commercial movie available in theatres in 5 years.

      Well..  Today we are going to play the Hammers at soccer.  We stung the Stingers, we gunned the gunners and we will hammer the Hammers. At least I hope we will.  We just rented Spider-man.  The other kids are watching it for the 2nd time.  I am blogging (DUH).  We just bought a new bike lock for our bikes. I am loaking att a SOnlight.. Oh sorry, maybe I should look at the computer while I type. I am looking at a Sonlight Curriculum Newsletter right now. I am trying really hard not to rip it up.  They are interviewing parents.  This is what they say: Opening the Sonlight boxes is one of the high points of the year.  I think that they only like the styrofoam thingies inside the box covering the mathbooks.  It is a beautiful day.  I had better go  :)D

      It was sunny this morning, but now it feels like it is going to rain. I wish it was sunny like in vancouver.  Platinum blonde was talking about those girls that wear shorts and skirts so short that when you bend over you can see their butt, and bikini tops so small that they leave only 18 square inches covering your upper body. In the winter they wear sweat shirts half way zipped down with very small tank tops. When they bend over you can see thongs. Also they are generally dating, or boy crazy, at least the ones that are my age. They drive me crazy.   We watched spider man this afternoon, which was good, but I've seen it so many times it was kind of boring. The kids are watching it again right now.   Me and dan went to the library this morning. We also bought a bike lock from canadian tire on the way there so that we could both go inside and one of us wouldn't have to stay out there and guard the bikes. There weren't any books waiting for us though, so I was kind of disappointed.   Nothing interesting today...

      Well...  There has been an interesting thing in Aimee's guestbook. Jonathan suggested that she put a link to Beah's and Melanie's blog but not to ours. Why? Because we only have a link to Melanie's blog on our blog, so why should everybody else have a link to our blog. Now, it must be understood that I take ABSOLUTELY NO responsibility for this. But I would like to usher into the spotlight (drumroll) BALDGUY!!!!! He is the culprit. I have asked him to link our blog to all the other blogs out there that we know of, and he said no. So, I am entirely not to blame for this. BUt I am going to warn my dad, We are losing popularity with the bloggers, (or actually with jonathan), so I suggest we link their blogs to ours.   please note blog readers, though I am in favour of linking your blogs to ours, I have absolutely no power to do so. Dad is the administrator. (that means that he is allwed to edit any post, of any blog user on this blog, and he can add links or get rid of them or change the colour in the guestbook etc etc.)  No real news today, it was kind of cloudy. Kind of boring. Mom wrote our report cards. She wrote in matthew's Beginning to think up creative stories. BEGINNING????!!!!!! He's been thinking up creative stories since he was 4. Dad threw it in the garbage.

      It is 5:30 am. I am in a deep sleep. I am half-woken by Ron speaking gibberish. "They are out there. I can hear them. Did you leave the garbage out?" And then finally "I'm going after them". I realize he is talking about raccoons. Unfortunately the raccoons were not scared away by a grown man with a hairy chest & wearing only blue underwear. Then I heard him knocking on our back door. Then there was repeated slamming of the door. Then silence.   He said if they come back tonight he is going to use a knife to injure them. "Then they'll think twice before coming back". But my question is: Do raccoons have the cognitive ability to reason out cause and effect? Or do they just attack you? Perhaps our loyal blog readers can come up with some better solutions.

      Ok, so today was the Church picnic. Well, the food was good, but that was the extent of the fun I had. I don't go to sunday school (this is one of the advantages of looking old.) but this lady that I HATE made me play all the stupid games. At the third one I ran away. Then she gave really stupid prizes, all pink stuff and hair elastics for the girls, and frisbees and balls for the boys. Then we each got like a party packet, again pink for the girls and other colours for the boys, and I didn't want a pink one so I asked for a boys one, and she gave me it, but you could tell she didn't like it. You would have to meet her to know what I mean.   Also dan's sunday school teacher made them sing a STUPID song in front of the entire congregation. Apparently 2 weeks ago some of the boys in the class had spontaneously started singing it. Dan was not one of those boys.   The song went like this:  Everywhere we go Everywhere we go People wanna know People wanna know Who we are Who we are So we tell them So we tell them We're the believers We're the believers we believe in jesus we believe in jesus We want you we want you to believe in jesus too to believe in jesus too  GGGGOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO JESUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!*  Dan refused to sing, so he just stood up there with his sunday school class and pretended for a while, and then stopped altogether. It was very funny, and I think dan has permanetely quit sunday school (robotic voice "Confirmed, status of DROPOUT"). I stopped when I was in grade 4 too.   Anyway I laughed so hard watching him sing. I was also very sorry for him.   *Please note that this song is not designed to get people to go to church under the impression that there are a bunch of singing boys every sunday. There simply are not.

      I filled holes in our walls and ceiling (yes, ceiling) today and painted all the ceilings on the main level. This boring activity was interrupted by a few welcome diversions.  1) While Lawrence, a friend/drywaller, came during our lunch hour to fix some wall I did not want to attempt myself, Dan made lunch for all of us. He even asked Lawrence if he wanted some. It was a very kind gesture. Plus lunch was terrific.  2) When Marsha and Katelyn came home they brought me a pre-father's day cheese cake wedge.  3) Sam went pee of his own volition for the first time!! Diaper days could be ending soon. Hallelujiah AMEN!  4) Marsha made a special supper for us which we ate mostly alone.  5) After reading Katelyn's Blog (and laughinh hyterically) I think I am going to make her call me Mr. Dad.

      Me and Mom went to a homeschooling talk today about how to be homeschooled (or home educated as they emphasized it) and get into university. Mom got very bored so we left. There was a break for lunch, and Mom said to one woman "Hi! I'm Marsha" The lady returned "Hi! I'm Sandy". Then mom said "This is my daughter katelyn." So then this woman goes "Hi I'm mrs. Fricker." I felt like saying "Hi, I'm Miss abarbanel" but I am not rude, so I just said hi and resolved not to call her anything, which is usually what I do when I forget someones name, or its hard to say. I don't usually say peoples names too much anyway so this is not a problem.   The same woman was double jointed and it was really cool seeing her flex her fingers. It was also kind of gross, it reminded me of signs.   I don't know what it is about this family and Mr/Mrs/Ms. names. We NEVER use them, and nobody ever calles Mom and DAd Mr and Mrs. Abarbanel. Dan once had these friends whose parents, without us knowing liked to be called Mr. and Mrs. So apparently dan was saying Randy, pass the pepper, and then RAndy pass the pepper, and then RANDY RANDY RANDY RANDY!!!! He finally looked at dan and said "I'm sorry are you talking to me??" Dan responded by saying "Is there any other randy at the table?" They had a whole conversation, and dan will write it in the blog for your reading pleasure.   Also, Is it just me, but are Mrs. and Mr's the only kind of people that ever insist that you call them Mrs. or Mr. Whatever? usually you don't call people Ms. Something but you do call them Mrs. Something. Odd isn't it.

      Okay that interview I just did is not really who I am; I just had stage fright. And DUH, McNabbs Island is in Halifax. Do you think that Bob Daily (A great friend of mine) would go to Montreal to play a game of Hide and Seek.  By the way if you read this blog before you listen to my interview you will not understand it.  One of my favorite series of books is: Wayside School.  It is about a building designer who was supposed to make a school with one floor and 30 classrooms. But the building designer made a school with 30 stories and 1 classroom on each story. Anyway it is really funny. Mom thought it was weird but once Dad pulled his back out in the middle of the living room and fell down and while the chiropractor was coming we made him read it ind he laughed so hard that he cried.  It is my bedtime now so I had better go.  :)D

      Ok, since platinumblonde has been doing quizes, I thought I should do one too, about our family.  1. Dad and Katelyn were struck by lightning. 2. US kids once made chocolate chip cookie dough and ate the entire bowl without cooking it 3. Dad has curly hair 4. Dad has a bald spot (this one should be easy!!!) 5. Moms hair is really red, but it turned grey so now she is dying it. 6. Dan once ate a whole bag of gumdrops and then threw up 7. The guys in our family pee standing up 8. Both dad and mom are very good swimmers 9. We call dan BEAVER 10. Dads full name is ROnald.            no cheating!!!                1. TRue, me and dad got struck by lightning once. 2. True (and it was really yummy) 3. TRue, before he shaved it off, if he had let it grow any longer he would have had an afro 4.True, besides the fact that dad shaves himself bald, he also has a spot on his head where NO hair grows. 5. False, mom has no grey hair 6. False 7. False, about 5 years ago there was a war in our house about this. Mom won, so Dad agreed to always pee sitting down, and trained dan to do so as well. (this was before matt was potty trained, and before sam was conceived) 8. False, mom is a good swimmer, and dad can swim, but he doesn't really come in the water very much 9. TRUE!!! That is dan's nickname because he has huge buckteeth. 10. False, Dad's Full name is ron, not ronald.

      This is Matt talking ...  Well Beah you can be a handyman. And ya you can be that quality thing that you said that would be a good idea. I am going to tell you a joke. There was a man and he had two jobs. His hands couldn't stretch out. His job was a hockey player and an architech. How does he do both of the works? Answer: He doesn't. So this means that Beah you will have to quit your other job. Welcome aboard.  Matt, Owner and Founder of Deep Sea Chicken.

      I took the plunge today to begin preparing for painting (which I hate). I am starting by filling all the holes in the walls (and there are many). But this step forces me to get it done because I hate letting things like this linger. So in a day or two or three the paint will come out and we will start slathering it all over the place. O joy.  Tonight I decided we will begin work on a Deep Sea Chicken commercial - concepts and stuff like that. This should be a fun project to work with the kids on. Stay tuned.

      Today Ron got a call from Frank, a friend from Ottawa he has known since age 2. He came over to see the kids & Matt started giving him the low-down on deep sea chicken. When Frank mentioned that he had killed chickens before Matt said, "OK you can be the executioner. We have a leather strap that we put on the chickens so their heads can't move around. And then you can use the magic axe that WILL chop off chicken heads but NOT hurt people". While explaining this he was pretending to be the chicken trying to jerk its head around until the leather strap was applied.  Frank took Ron & I out for dinner at a pub called "The Old Triangle". We sat on the patio, had some nice food and laughed and laughed at Frank's stories. It was a very nice evening.

      So last night we beat the stingers 5 to nothing.  We got all five goals in the first half and the second half was really boring.  I think that we didn't play as hard in the second half because we didn't want to humiliate the other team.  Two more weeks and Spiderman 2 is coming in theatres.  I can't wait. The first one was really really good.  We just had some guests come over in the morning. They have a baby named Luke.  He likes to climb up the stairs and when he can't get down he cries. He was cute.  We are having guests over for dinner.  Two days in a row we are having guests.  I had to clean up the basement today. for the guests.  They didn't even bother going down there.  It is suppertime so I had better go!!  :)D

      Today we had some old friends over who we haven't seen for 9 years. Matt went up to the guy & said apologetically, "sometimes when I fart it really stinks". Though the guy is English & thus rather reserved he recovered well & asked Matt if he would be so kind to warn him before letting loose.  This afternoon Matt was telling a guy at the Rec Centre about Deep Sea Chicken. He explained that the chickens were alive at Deep Sea Chicken & you got to kill them yourself. They have a special axe that cuts of chicken's heads but if you mistakenly swung at your arm, your hand would not fall off. The guy was only too glad to enter into the imaginary world of Deep Sea Chicken. However, when hearing these details he said, "I'm not much of a country boy. I like to buy my chicken from the grocery store where I don't have to think about them actually being real."   This afternoon I took the 3 youngest shopping at Frenchies - a second hand store similar to the Salvation Army, Goodwill, etc. I had to crowd all 3 of them into a room about the size of a telephone booth to try the stuff on. There were knees, piles of clothes and kids everywhere. It was exhausting.

      Yippy!!!  Well today is the day that I play my first soccer game in the year.  I really hope we play the toffees because we smoked them the last time we played against them.  Bebbie is coming over in a fortnight.  I can't wait because she was always fun.  We just had a guest named Stacy over for lunch.  She is a really nice.  The last time I saw her was when Matt was 2 years old.

      Ok, I wanted to make sure that I didn't get any harassing e-mails, so I am finally blogging after 3 days. Dad says I should write about what my favourite thing about dan is. I don't think this is entirely fair of him, because there are lots, er a few things that I like about dan, and I can't choose between any of them. (Just kidding dan, there are really too many to count.)  So I have decided not to do that kind of post. But I don't know what kind of post I should do.   We have a girl named stacey over, and mom and dad are downstairs talking to her, and they have kicked us out, which they always do when people come over. I am quite annoyed. Actually I'm VERY annoyed. I know that I shouldn't take it out on you people out there in blogland though, so I will try to make a good blog.   The problem is that there is nothing really to write about. Except for one thing.  On sunday we were all piled in the van waiting for mom and dad to come out, and our neighbour was washing his car. He bent over to wash the wheels, and well, you know how when you usually see peoples butt cracks it is just the top, and you don't see any solid butt cleavage at all. Well it wasn't like that. It was a solid 3" of crack. So the kids were cracking up, and the window was open, and so I told them to shut up until I closed the window. So I closed the window and they all started laughing really loud, and making it (I thought) very clear what they were laughing at. It was at this point that I looked around and discovered that the drivers seat door was open. So I closed it. The weird thing was, he didn't seem to realize he was mooning everybody. I don't really see how you could not feel the cool breezes blowing on a part of your body that the cool breezes don't usually blow on. I said this to Stacey, and she said that maybe the cool breezes were blowing there more often than we thing. Sick.

      Katelyn and Dan were cleaning the kitchen and Sarah came up out of the basement looking for something. I was making myself some supper (got home late) so my back was turned. I heard Dan say to Sarah in reply, "Sarah! You can't come up here like that now that you are a girl!"  "NOW that she is a girl?" I thought. What was she before? I turned around and there was Sarah, walking around the kitchen, looking for something, completely naked.

      Yesterday we went to Point Pleasant Park for the first time since Hurricane Juan. It just opened - the Juan devastation was so bad that it took them 8 months to clean it up. Yes Bloggites it is BAD. Ron's thought it looked like Macmillan-Bloedel had come in a clear cut. Paul Martin was there when it re-opened. He was quoted as saying, "It is still such a treasure". That struck me as very funny.   Our friend Randy brought over a big box of LEGO. This ended Ron's self-imposed 5-year moratorium on LEGO after stepping on it too many times. The kids have been playing with it constantly ever since. I was woken up this morning by a present from Sam - a lego AK-47. He had a matching one. We snuggled in bed while at the same time shooting up the bedroom lights, clothes closets, etc.

      I feel the need to clarify that when I said that mom gets mad at different things I was only trying to imply that I was not the only one that got her angry, like some sort of mean ugly person who likes to fight with their mom. I was not trying to imply that she is grumpy all the time, truthfully she is not grumpy very much.

      What our family is REALLY like.  I am going to write about how we are as a family, because dad only wrote about what kind of things we like to do.  DRUMROLLL!!!! Me and Dan have a lot of fun together, and sometimes Sarah too. We like to ride our bikes down hills, and we don’t like going back up them. The other day we were going up and down a really steep hill on our bikes, and there was this guy who was telling us it was dangerous etc. I was getting quite annoyed with him and felt like yelling at him “IF I WANT TO KILL MYSELF GOING DOWN THIS HILL THAN ITS MY BUISNESS”. It wasn’t even that dangerous, the hill was so steep that the cars come up really slowly, and we always had a person at the bottom of the hill to tell the person at the top if there was anything coming.  Anyway I didn’t yell the afore mentioned sentence, and I told him that I wore a helmet, and the worst I would get were a couple scrapes. Then he said “Well I’m not worried about your head, I’m worried about what’s coming up the hill.” This made me very angry, and so now you know one kind of thing that makes me angry.   Me and Dan fight a lot too, and insult each other, but we usually also make up fairly quickly, usually it involves somebody else getting mad at us and then we sort of “team up” against them.   Matt is very smart, and has a lot of imaginary things and ideas that he tells everybody. Right now he currently owns a restaurant called Deep Sea Chicken, and an army camp. HE takes them both very seriously. He is also engaged to a life guard named Ashley. He bought her a ring from the dollar store last summer and ever since then they have been engaged. He also talks  a lot, and he stutters quite a bit too.  Sam is like a little bull, and he is always ramming into things and getting cuts and scrapes. Strangely enough he hardly ever complains, and when he put 2 teeth through his lip he just made a little whimper, and then that was all. We didn’t realize he had put his teeth through his lip until ten minutes later.   Sarah doesn’t get mad very easily, and is very sensitive. She is also very good at art. She likes to do things with plastic and wooden beads, construction paper, and modeling clay. She also likes to ride her bike, but she doesn’t ride it as far as me or Dan. She likes to listen to her music, and to listen to my music, and to listen to Dan’s music. Matt always blames her when he does something bad. Since Sarah hardly ever does anything that would need confessing too this makes it very obvious who actually did or didn’t do it.   Me and Sarah don’t usually get along very well, but we don’t hate each other.   Also as an afterthought mom doesn’t only have temper tantrums when I am mad at her. She usually has them when she is mad at somebody or something. Like about the house not being clean, or at me or Dan or Sarah for not doing our chores, or at anybody in the family.

      Here is what our family is REALLY like.  I will start from the oldest kid to the youngest kid. I will not do me because I don’t really know my personality.   Katelyn: Katelyn is one of girls who speak sarcasm. Katelyn is sarcastic all the time.  She likes to read books and sit in her room and I have no clue what she does in there.  She really likes the sun and always gets mad when it rains.  Sarah:  Always around to do something for you, and is so CRAZY!!!!!!!!!! She loves to do arts and listens to her stereo a lot and is learning how to read.  Matt:  Always good at attracting attention, engaged to a lifeguard, owner of Deep Sea Chicken.  He once actually changed his name to Steve but it is Matt now.  Sammy:  Sammy is one of those babies that really like crackers, especially rice crackers always has the fridge door open on the lookout for grub. If he were one of the 7 deadly sins he would be gluttony.

      What life is REALLY like at our house - by Matt  Dan is sometimes mean to us because we bother him. He sometimes pushes me, hits me and scratches me. I do the same thing back to him.   Last night at dinner Sammy hit me because he was in a bad mood. I cried. Daddy said, "Sam look what you did.  You made Matt cried." Then Sam hugged me and kissed me. Then everything was all right.  We were having a water fight. We were just having fun. We didn't mean to get the van went. I was on Dan's team & so Katelyn dropped the hose. I picked up the hose, pulled the trigger & I got them. Then I gave the hose to Dan & he pulled the trigger & got them wherever they went - even up the stairs.  Our family is fun. We have water fights, movies, dates, candy, hideouts, tents, a shoe box which is one of the hideouts. It is also fun to squish ants, have burgers, going hiking at the Frog Pond or York Redoubt. At York Redoubt we play stuff like hide and seek in the hideouts. Now this is embarrassing but sometimes I pee on the wall at York Redoubt. We play with lego at our house & poison ants. We listen to songs from Dan's radio. Like Great Big Sea, U2, Arrogant Worms, Steve Bell and Johnny Cash.   At birthdays at our house people get presents. We eat cake & play games. We all get to design our cake. For Dad's birthday today I got to lick the bowl of all that yummy stuff which was pudding. My favorite people are Mike and Donna. They are my favorite people because they are our neighbors. They are always giving us stuff for Christmas like Christmas ornaments, toys, presents. But no beer. They never give us beer. Well sometimes they do.   I'm tired now so I have to stop blogging.

      What our family is REALLY like - by Sarah  My brother and my sister sometimes really bother me. They hit me and make fun of me and talk in baby talk. My smallest brother likes to run and is very tough. When he was little he was not scared of ear wigs. If he saw one he would squish it with his finger. Daddy got a can of beer and he let Sammy have a drink. That was the cutest thing. Sammy really wanted water after that. He didn't know what the beer was & so he wouldn't know what it was if we gave him another drink. He was the only 3 year old baby that I know that had the guts to do that.   Daddy always brings us treats when he goes away. He brang a new van but Matthew wanted a candy treat instead of the van treat. I got pipe cleaners for my birthday & some wooden beads. So I decided I would make a bracelet. I didn't have any string. So I put the beads on a pipe cleaner. It didn't turn out the way I wanted it to be. But I did make a very nice hairpiece. I have it on right now but I don't usually wear it. I was going to give it to my friend who moved away today but I imagined it on her and it didn't look good. So I didn't give it to her.   Daddy likes to embarrass mom on his birthday. We had Dad's birthday today but mom didn't put any candles in the Banana Cream Pie.   Mommy has temper tantrums. Not often. Only when Katelyn gets mad at her. When mom has a temper tantrum she yells and whenever we hear that we try and stay away from her. Mom always takes us on dates.

      OK so today is Ron's birthday. I have attempted to make 2 Banana cream pies to surprise him. But there are 2 problems: 1. I didn't receive any culinary training in pies during my formative growing up years. 2. My mother-in-law is a professional dessert maker who actually has run her own bakery. But hey no pressure. Whilst I try to create a memorable birthday feast Sam & Sarah were playing with dirt in the back yard. Sam got sand in his eyes so I suggested a bath. The bathwater turned immediately brown & I had to run fresh bathwater. As soon as I got his clothes on he went back outside to play in the dirt more. Dan is spending the afternoon putting away laundry. He has his own 'efficiency' method of dumping all the clothes on the bed, then lining up our tall rubbermaid laundry baskets & shooting the laundry in. He is very good at it. And this is all done while listening to Great Big Sea which I enjoy but perhaps not 24/7. Now obviously the pile of my clothes got too high. As I walked into the room I saw him stick his leg into it to mash it down. I noticed a large bike grease stain on his leg & wondered what was on his feet?   Dan was supposed to have a bunch of writing assignments done by today so I could write a report card. Two out of 8 are done. So I made a deal with him that he could do "summer school" by writing 5 blogs each week for the summer. What do you guys think? I don't think Dan fully appreciates how much the bloggites love his writing style!!

      I noticed in the platinum blonde blog that Beah is wondering what we are REALLY like. Excellent question. Our blog captures but a smidgen of our very complex lives. Of course the only way to know what we are really like is to come and see for yourself, but in lieu of that ...  As you can tell Dan is a budding author specializing in math gore. Katelyn is in training to become a forensic scientist and Olympic swimming athlete. Sarah is preparing to take her place among the worlds great artist. Matthew, aside from his well known investment in restauranting, runs a car manufacturing business and army camp occasionally dabbling in other things that pique his many interests. Sam, though still young, is in training to be one of the world's greatest and fearless leaders. Sarah built a helicopter out of brush she found in the woods and flies it on rescue missions. Sam disappears at the end of a hard day's work to his special room where he smokes cigars and reads the paper. Matt is a super hero named BATH BOY. He fights crime the same way he takes a bath - naked. Dan broke the sound barrier on his bike a few days ago and didn't even fall. Katelyn and Dan took care of Sarah, Matt and Sam for several years all by themselves. They lived in a trash bin behind the Sobey's. They kept a chronicle of their experiences. It is called "The Trash-can Kids" but it has yet to be published.    So you see, there is much more here than meets the eye. It is hard to describe.

      OK so yes it was hot today. How hot, you ask? Well Dan insisted on my smelling his armpits to confirm he now sweats. Yes folks they were stinky. I also shaved my legs today for the first time this season. So this is my official confession that I am a hippy & only shave my legs when it is shorts weather. I also eat tofu every day, make pasta out of Kamut flour & refuse to drink water from the tap because of possible pathogens. But I do not have long hair that I wear in a braid & I don't own any tie-dyed t-shirts.

      Sorry for the lack of bloggage yesterday. Today was an interestind day. For one thing it was SO HOT! It was 34 degrees Celcius. And to top that it was humid. For almost the whole day you felt like the heat was closing in on you. Towards the end of the day there was a breeze, but it was still VERY hot. But it was fun. If it stays this warm soon we will be able to go swimming. That will be fun.  Yesterday Dad resodded the lawn. Now we have the nicest looking lawn on the whole street. The grass is healthy and green because we've been watering it so much, the soil is deep because we shoveled it all onto our yard, and the only thing we could ask for is that the cracks from the sod disappear. But in a couple of weeks they will be gone too. Then we will really have the nicest lawn on the street.   There was a soccer practice tonight, and we went to our field and there were cars parked on every inch of it. We were wondering what happened, and we asked a guy who was there and it turned out they were shooting a TV show.   I have to go now, but I promise I will try to blog soon.

      Alright. Here is a blog.  If I hadn't blogged since Wednesday you blog readers would be expecting a really large blog.  Well my math is finally done and now I have to do some geography book on Canada. It is a really fun book. Not like the ones where they ask you a question and you answer it. This book is more of a book that gives you those really challenging crossword puzzles like the ones in the newspaper only the words are about Canada. Or some tests that you can do and you actually get to take your time and not do them in like 5 seconds. It is a lot harder do work on a limited time then to work until you are done.  I am writing a story about a boy that cuts off his fingers attempting to cut his mathbook in half with a table saw.  My math comes from a really boring company from Singapore called Sunlight Curriculum. I think if the book ever gets published I am going to say in the beginning of the book: To Sunlight Curriculum who always kept me asleep.  Yes it's true. I fell asleep once during a test.  On the Sunlight Curriculem newsletter they ask the parents there opinion and they say stuff like: My kids cry with happiness when they do Sunlight Curriculem. I think that they actually cry with boredom.  Yikes!!!!!  I just remembered that I have to do Sunlight Curriculem math until I am in grade 7!!!  Well me and Katelyn are taking bike rides a far distance every day. On the way there it is mostly downhill but going back is so tiring my heart beats 5 times a second and I could hardly breath. There is a hill about as steep as a downtown hill in San Fransico (Pretty steep) and me and Katelyn bike down it at breakneck speed. We are going so fast that everything around you is a blurr.    Well yesterday I recieved 2 great big sea CD's from Melanie!! Thank you so so much Melanie. They are the only CD's I am listining to right now.  :)D

      I wish I could blame the lack of bloggage on the vandals who cut the cables in NS and NF but alas I cannot. It is the SUN!! Yes that glorious ball of fire in the sky is poking it's radioactive tenticles through the clouds and heating us up. So the beehive is now buzzing with outdoor activity into which blogging does not fit.  I will nevertheless put pressure on the kids to get typing.

      Guess what. ITS RAINING AGAIN!!!!!!! After two perfect days of sunshine god decided that he was sad again, and proceeds to cry on us all day. According to the forecast he is supposed to recover tonight, but he will be grumpy sometimes tomorrow.   Today a giant dump truck came to our house, backed up on our lawn and deposited a GARGANTUAN pile of dirt on our lawn. So much in fact, that it will cover our lawn with four inches of dirt. Matt, Sam, and Dad are all out there right now shoveling it. It is kind of funny to watch them. One of our neighbours took apart their lawn, so now it is a bunch of dirt, and it looks very messy.  Nothing else interesting today...

      Victory! Almost all the ants are gone from the location that I attacked. Now that I have established a beach-head I will widdle them down from there. Do you think it's ok to employ chemical warefare techniques on ants?  Marsha was up to her sleep walking habits again last night (only she doesn't actually get up and walk, she just sits up and yells at me). I just tell her to go back to sleep, but if I am in a funny mood I spice up my language a bit for a giggle. She never remembers anyway.

      Graced by the sunshine I declared today to be "Bike-day". It brings an end to the annual ritual the kids have of asking me, "CAN YOU GET THE BIKES OUT!!" Every year around this time tires need to be pumped up, chains oiled, cables replaced, handlebars straightened and so on. It takes all day as there are now 5 bikes to be brought back to life (and that excludes my own).  That last trip to Canadian tire did me in - it was the third. Just when I was finishing Sarah's bike (the last one), I popped her tire by accident right at the stem. I could not possibly have left it unfished when all the others were done. She gives you that puss-in-boots look (you'll have to see Shrek 2 to know what I mean). Now I am greasy and tired.  We convinced Sam to not wear a diaper today as well. This took much bribing. He wet himself once and pooped in his pants once. So far he has not gone to the toilet of his own volition. If we succeed, this will mark the near end of 13 years of diapers for us. How delightful.  Also newsworthy, today I declared war on the ants in our house. I got this RAID liquid stuff and put a few drops where I thought they were coming in. An ant walked up to it and didn't much care for it - ran away in fact. I thought GREAT - I bought "too good to be true ant killer"!! The bottle said they take it back to the nest and it kills the queen and the whole colony. An hour later I went to look at my drops and there were swarms of ants taking the stuff and you could see exaclty where they were coming from. It was like they could not get enough of the stuff. Matt said, "Those ants are doing a great job of killing themselves." Anyhow, we'll see if it works - looks hopeful.

      Today I spent a good part of the afternoon doing 'waste management'. In the winter, garbage is not much of a problem. But when the warm weather comes so do the raccoons. So for the last few days they have been foraging through our garbage. Over the years we have tried many things to prevent them from getting into our garbage cans ... bungee cording them shut, yelling at the coons to go away, etc. The only solution we have found that really works is garbage cans that have a locking system ... the old-fashioned ones made of metal. Unfortunately they don't last more than 2 summers as the garbage men bash them around & then the lids don't fit on. (But I'm not being critical of garbage men - one of our garbage men fell under the wheel of the garbage truck & died. People said it was because they are forced to go too fast because people don't want their garbage still sitting at the curb when I get home from work). But I digress. So today when I made my annual trek to Canadian tire I found the steel ones for $21.99 & some Rubbermaid jobbies for $7.99 that had a 'twist to lock' mechanism. So I figured I would buy the $7.99 ones & see if the coons were smart enough to twist the tops off. They might be.   In the summer of 1997 we rented a house in Old Ottawa South - a prestigious upper class neighborhood. There were lots of lovely homes on the street but our house was awful. The raccoons ran the neighborhood. They had full access to our basement & one time by mistake I put some groceries down in the hall near the basement door. Suddenly the bags of bread were moving. They stuck their noses underneath the door, making moves for the food! After that I never went in the basement again. They used to climb in the trees outside our bedroom window & jump on our window ledge. After that we never opened the window again. Sigh. Good times. NOT! If you tried to shoo them away they would just look at you in a sassy way as if to say, "Stop bothering me! Can't you see I'm eating?"  Today I was entertaining evil thoughts of how to kill the raccoons. Rat poison? Potato gun? But then I realized I would have to deal with the carcass. Ron suggested we just put them in the garbage since they are eating it anyway. One of my friends suggested trapping them & then releasing them in Sackville - a suburb about 30 minutes away. Perhaps that is how the ended up in our suburb in the first place. Hmmm   As I was 'playing' in the mounds of garbage I was thinking about our wedding day ... hmmm... I remember making a vow "in sickness & in health, for richer, for poorer" Yup we've done all these things. But I don't remember anything about waste management. They should definitely add that to the vows.

      This is Matt typing. I found a good ad for deep sea chicken. Go to  urlLink my special website  to see it. Ignore stuff about Burger King. It's a lie. If you see burger king you tell him that he is not the real boss and give him fake blueprint to deep sea chicken.  If you copy off my idea and try to rob the restaurant the first step you take you will fall into a trap. If you try to rob it and you make it past the trap you'll fall into another trap. If you bash through the windows you will also go into a trap. Eight of my people in my army camp will be there if the traps don't work because they control the traps. And if you try and break into my army camp you would get caught by a video camera.  This is Sam. I hurt my foot. I slammed the back door on it and it is cut. It is hurting and I have a band-aid on it. It is a bad Ouwie. Matt's nose is bleeding but he is not crying. Matt's picking his nose too much.

      I knew the day would come. Sam took a stick and scratched the length of our van. *Sigh*  Matt climbed on my lap at lunch and asked if he should start a company that investigates scratches to determine whether it was a vandal who did it or a kid. Then, once that is figured out, they could take some paint and brush it on the scratch (and I quote), "and ... and ... and then ... that's it - no more scratch (he said this last part with a shrug of his shoulders)."

      Well, I had the concert last night. Well the first thing on the agenda was O Canada. That went well. The two bands played it together, and we did it without mistakes. mom and dan and sarah were sitting on the other side of the gym, so they couldn't really see me very well, but I could see them, and dan was bouncing around with his big teeth out (in case you don't know, dan has VERY long teeth, and a very pronounced overbite, and we call him beaver, so when he has his teeth out it is a big overwhelming) I looked away. Then the other band played a couple pieces, and the string ensemble played a couple, and then it was my schools bands turn.   We first played a piece called ashlawn echoes, and we played it so BAD. The flutes had like a section solo at the beginning after 1 bar, and we weren't together at all, and then at the BEST part of the piece the saxophones missed their part, which caused the flutes to miss theirs, etc. Then we played another piece called in a hurry, which we played ok, but there were 2 endings and BOTH of them were SO BAD. It was after a long rest, so everybody was supposed to be counting time, but... it sort of ended with random notes, and then we all got back together for the last one. At the end of the piece a trumpet player on one side of the band says to a saxophone on the other side "Hey Jamie, we suck" Everybody else in the bad was laughing and also saying how bad it was.  Do you guys all remember Mr. G-string? Well last night, he went over to his base guitar, and was muttering something about the key of g (a bit ironic...) and got tangled up in his strings, and pulled them up, and the base hit the floor like BAM BAM BAM BAM. By this time everybody was watching, and so he goes "Almost ready" BAM BAM BAM and then after it is all untangled he yells "NOW ITS TIME TO PPPLLLLLAAAAAY"  There was also a trombone solo, and in the solo instead of doing single notes, it was like a slide whistle, so BBRRRrump bump. Everybody in the band and in the audience thought it was VERY funny, and we were all holding our breath. not so occasionally somebody would start to laugh quietly, and then I would start to laugh quietly, and when she finished her solo we just all cracked up. It was so funny.   So the conclusion of this concert was that we played the worst we have ever played, but it was the funniest concert EVER.

      Ok, I have to get into the blogging loop again.   For TWO months now it has been cloudy almost every day. You would think that you would get some relief in June but NNNNNNOooooo, it has decided to stay cloudy for part of June too. Right now I really am considering packing up, finding an apartment, or staying with somebody, and moving far far away where the sun shines almost all the time. That would be the life eh!   That is another thing that Canadians do. They say EH all the time. I even have a t-shirt that has a Canadian flag on it, and says underneath it Canada EH! This was pointed out to us by a bunch of Americans that we had in our house so they could take a shower after all the planes were stopped on on September 11th. Eh.  Dad went away for three days for some meetings in Ontario. He came back last night. Then this morning when we all went to say hi, he told us that he and mom had to talk about the day. After trips he always seems to have to talk about the day with mom. Also, it usually takes about 1 and 1/2 hours. That is the time that I am blogging in.  I have a band concert tonight, we are playing I think 8 pieces. It is two Jr high school bands (grades 7, 8, and 9 for those of you who have high school start at grade 9) and a sixth grade band, and a string band, which didn't play very well at the last concert. So it will be very LLLLLOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNG. I also have a rehearsal at 2:00, and the concert is at 7:00. I'm not particular looking forward to it, but not dreading in either.

      Yesterday I was changing Sammy's diaper. He is pretty strong-willed these days so it was a wrestling match to get his clothes on again. Well I zigged & he zagged & I ended up bashing my head into a large solid piece of pine on his bunk bed. I went down just like a wrestler to the mat. I was lieing there in pain & I thought I touched blood on my head. I just had a visual of going to the hospital & having to have my hair shaved in that spot in order to put stitches in. It made me giggle to think how stupid a little bald spot would look on a mom with 5 kids. Would people think I was trying to come up with a new punk rocker image? In the end there was no blood, just a very big bump that is quite tender.  I've spoken to 2 European friends re: the dirty Italians quote. Mel (who is Belgian) said she didn't think the Italians would even MIND being called dirty because all Europeans like to insult other Europeans. Debs (who is English) said English people assume that other Europeans don't understand English so it is fine to insult them because they don't even know what is being said. What do you think blog readers? Do Canadians mind when people insult us? I usually find what people say is actually true. For instance Debs says all Canadian men wear baseball hats & have facial hair with optional plaid shirt. Well that is TRUE. My friend Hillary from New Zealand says we Canadians always talk about the weather. Well that is TRUE. My Polish friend Lila says we make small talk in places like elevators. Well that is TRUE.

      While I was making supper tonight Matt climbed up on a chair, put his arm on my shoulder & whispered into my ear conspiratorially "Mom, there is a secret ingredient to Deep Sea Chicken but only members can know ... the secret ingredient is bacon roll-ups. We roll up pieces of turkey bacon & they taste really yummy".   WARNING: THE NEXT FEW PARAGRAPHS ARE AND POTENTIALLY OFFENSIVE. Last night at soccer our English coach was talking about when the Italians play in the "World Cup" they'll get injured & the officials will bring in the stretcher & ambulance and then 2 minutes later they will be playing again & scoring goals. Here is the punch line: he then called them "dirty Italians". This was so politically incorrect that I thought it was very funny. Truth be known working class Nova Scotians & all Cape Bretoners are not particularly concerned about political correctness. It is refreshing sometimes to hear someone actually express an opinion about something. Although the English are generally even more politically correct than Canadians, when it comes to other Europeans they are downright prejudice. They especially hate the French. Debs sent me a newspaper clipping of quotes famous people wrote about the French. Mark Twain wrote, "Somewhere between the Angels and the French lies the rest of humanity. Elton John said, "The French are just useless. They can't organize a piss up in a brewery". Kenneth Stilling wrote, "If you want to visit Paris, the best time to go is during August, when there aren't any French people there". And some anonymous person said, "When God created France, He realized that He had gone overboard in creating the most perfect place on Earth. So to balance it out He created the French people". So there you go. I trust my blog readers are politically incorrect enough to find this funny.  Last night we watched "Spellbound" - a documentary about the National Spelling Bee in the U.S. It is a very good documentary. Katelyn & Dan are very keen to see "Supersize it" now that it has finally arrived in Hali.

      Mom told me that I had to do 8 reports for my final strech of homeschooling.  So here is my report on Great Big Sea  My Favorite Album of the Year  My favorite album of the year is probably Great Big Sea. We borrowed it from the library.  My favorite songs are Drunken Sailor and What are you at?  They are both really lively.  I also like how the music is a lot of instruments working together to make a really nice sound.  The singing isn’t really off tune and it sounds really nice. I think that the album is really old because on greatbigsea.com, only 3 people are in the band. But on the album that we borrowed there were 4 singers.  And Alan Doyle (the lead singer) looked really younger then he is now.  His hair was shorter then.  The Cd's cost around $15. The people of the band are Alan Doyle, Bob Hallet, Darrell Power and Sean McCann.  They are from Newfoundland.  They play alot of folk and the top instruments are different kinds of drums the harmonica and the acoustic guitar. I would give this album a 4 1/2 star.  The song, What are you at is  about how instead of saying Hi or What's up, Newfoundlanders say what are you at?  :)D

      When we were camping on PEI last weekend we came home without Sammy's special blanket which he calls "Boochie". We tried things to ease the pain like lieing down to go to sleep with him. But he has been waking up at 5 am, demanding that I watch him poo and generally very fussy & temper tantrummy all day. We suspect he isn't sleeping well &amp; I know I am tired from being woken up & listening to him whine. So today I took him to Frenchies &amp; searched for a replacement boochie (not at all sure that you could replace a favoured boochie). There was nothing in the baby bins, though I did try to sell him on a couple of receiving blankets. He said, "Mom those not the ones. Those are sheets". I prayed, pleaded & begged God for a boochie. Then I went to the bin with adult blankets. I held up one awful looking adult-sized afghan &amp; asked if that was the one. He said, "Mom that's not the one". Finally I found a baby-sized granny-squared boochie with all different colours for the granny square. Let's just say the grandma that made it wasn't a colour expert. At first Sam said that it wasn't the one. But I got him to hold it, while sucking his thumb. Then he said, "Mom, this is the one". So for $1.25 I hope Sammy will once again sleep well & not wake us up. Please note that in fact it was Ron that finally got up with him this morning to watch him poo. However tonight at supper Ron made clear to Sam that we don't actually LIKE watching him poo, just in case there was some sort of communication breakdown &amp; Sam was under the delusion that we were enjoying it. I've probably confused the kid terribly by the many times we've called everyone into the bathroom to sing, dance &amp; celebrate a poo sitting in the toilet.

      I asked the teenage cashier at the gas station today whether her eyebrow piercing hurt. She said that she had expected it to but it wasn't nearly as bad as when she had her bellybutton pierced. There was a teenager behind me who said, "and having the top of your bellybutton pierced above your bellybutton is nothing like the pain of having a piercing below your bellybutton. And the worst is having your nipple pierced".&nbsp;Two questions occurred to me: #1 How do I get myself into these situations? #2 Do WOMEN actually get their nipples pierced? Having&nbsp;endured the pain of breastfeeding 5&nbsp;children I can assure anyone out there that this is a&nbsp;BAD idea.   We stayed overnight at some friends&nbsp;house who had a little swimming pool.&nbsp; Later I heard him telling Charlie Ritchie, "my underwear are still wet from going&nbsp;swimming last night so this morning I am going commando".   We went to the dentist&nbsp;yesteray & Katelyn mentioned that her jaw has been hurting &amp; she can't open it all the way.&nbsp;It turns out it was dislocated. So the dentist put it back into place & now Katelyn is&nbsp;supposed to be on a soft diet, take ibuprofen to reduce the swelling & apply heat 3 times a day. This proves once and for all that we are bad parents as she complained for about 3&nbsp;weeks & we&nbsp;figured&nbsp;the pain would just go away. The mystery&nbsp;is: how do you dislocate your jaw in the first place?   I'm doing a little project on the 'best of the blog'. If there is a blog that you especially enjoyed, send us a little note in the guest book.   Cheers, Marsha&nbsp;

        I &nbsp;love the new colour changers.    &nbsp;  When mom and Dad were telling Dan what our campsite was going to be like, they said "well, it has beach, and rocks, and a childrens program, and a baskat ball court, and showers". At that opoint Dan piped up really excitedly SHOWERS?! I honestly don't see why he likes them so much.     &nbsp;  Today we had swim lessons, only I didn't, so I just swam laps. There weren't any trouble makers today that we saw, but we didn't go in the afternoon. There are people who come every day of the summer for the entire day who are talking about leaving. They have come here for at least 4 years now. I think it is really sad.     &nbsp;  Matt was talking to three women at the beach yesterday about deep sea chicken. All the women really liked him, and one asked if there really was a deep sea chicken. Dad said no, and they said that we should make it a real restaurant. One of the ladies promised that if she ever won the lottery she would try and find Matt. He was giving them random code numbers, and whispering them into there ears. They sounded somewhat like 98214 or another random combination of numbers. It was very funny.

      Our campsite on PEI was right on the ocean - there was a huge cliff -dropoff thing & down below was a great sandy beach. You non-Atlantic&nbsp;Canadians should be aware that the ocean water does not get warm until September. So it is not great swimming water, but the kids swam nevertheless. I went to talk to someone around 10 pm Saturday night & Ron thought Matt went with me. I thought he had stayed with Ron. So by this time he had been missing for 30 minutes. I of course assumed the worst - that he had plunged to his death over the drop-off. I started asking people at other campsites if they had seen Matt. The answers were, "oh you mean the cute little redhead that owns Deep Sea Chicken?" and "We saw him earlier - he invited us to your campfire". In the end I found him at a campfire of a kid friend he had met. I am still really perplexed why the parents wouldn't bring him back. They probably are perplexed why I was letting my kid wander around in the dark next to a drop off at 10 pm. Sam has also gotten into the act &amp; will often go up to people & say, "Do you know Deep Sea Chicken". I found him next to the drop off talking to a very nice man named Byron. He told Byron his first name but whenever Byron asked his last name Sam would show him his hand in the SpiderMan web-throwing position. He also spent an hour on the weekend pretending to be spiderman by throwing his blanket (which looks like a web) over the van while standing on the back bumper &amp; then jumping down, while at the same time screaming "look Mommy I'm spiderman".   We've been taking swimming lessons this week at the beach. The guards were telling us that in the afternoons they have been having trouble with large groups of children who won't obey the lifeguard rules. The police have been there every day & the guards have to be escorted to their cars by the police. Sounds like a great place to take your kids, huh? Actually the hoodlums only come in the afternoon &amp; we take lessons in the morning. Today it was so hot that we went in the afternoon. There was a large group of kids in the parking lot & I said to Ron, "there are the kids that are giving the lifeguards trouble". Ron said, "I don't think those are the kids". And then the fun began. It was a classic rumble. The profanity, the jockeying, the girlfriends screaming either to do it or not to do it.&nbsp; And then the fists came out. It was better than television. Unfortunately for the police the only weapons involved were a plastic knife & a baseball bat that was not used as a deadly weapon. They couldn't do anything. I feel bad for the lifeguards. Lets face it: 17 year olds are way too young to be handling 20 hoodlums &amp; still guard the beach.   We also went to the dentist today. There was a kind of Little Tykes doll house & a Little Tykes castle. While getting my teeth cleaned I heard Matt say, "Dad we've blasted everything out of the dollhouse by shooting it with cannon balls."&nbsp; Only our kids would think of combining the toys to make one super destructo toy.

       OOOOOOOOOOohhhhhhhhhhh, they have new text and font changers here.  &nbsp;  Well here is the story.&nbsp; Mom and Dad every year don't tell us when we are going on vacation so that we don't get exited.&nbsp; So they did it again this year.&nbsp; It was cloudy for the first week, and the bugs were awful, but don't get me wrong I had loads of fun. First we stayed at a campsite with a lake, and it had a dock that you could jump off of and it was really fun. Like I said, the first week was really cloudy, but the second week it cleared up, and we had bonfires and made s'mores almost every night. Then we went to a different campsite with some other people from the navigators (the company dad and mum work for)&nbsp; for the last weekend. There were loads of people there, and&nbsp;we played hide and seek with them. We also played croquet, and I discovered really how bad I am. We also went swimming in the ocean, I went in my clothes, because it was really cold, and there were jelly fish that we would pick up and throw at people. Then we had to leave, and so we went on the ferry, and while the ferry was still docked we saw some portueguese men of war (very poisonous jellyfish) jellying around. It was really crowded in the ferry because it was cold and foggy outside. Then really late last night we got home.  &nbsp;  Today mom and me are going to get me a new bathing suit because my old one is dead. There is a hole in it (fortunately in a respectable place on the strap, once I had one with a seam up the back, and you can guess what happened, this was when I was 9) and the elastic is coming out. I hate bathing suits because they don't last very long, I have gont through three in the past year, and they are like 30 dollars each. So this time I'm going to get a polyester swim suit because they are supossed to last longer.

         Okay that is sweet .&nbsp;  Now you can change the font&nbsp;and color&nbsp;of your blog .&nbsp;  Well we just came back from vacation and we had a blast. &nbsp;  We were away for such a long time that I couldn't remember where my room was. &nbsp;  Of course I thought       I knew and WHACK!!! my head hit the doorjam. &nbsp;  And it hurt too . &nbsp;     Ha ha ha... I love the new colours you can do. I am going to do black from now on so you can see. Sam just threw a toy dump truck down the stairs and it very narrowly missed my foot.&nbsp; We went up to New Brunswick and    stayed  overnight at Charlie Ritchie's (A friend of ours studying at the UNB) and then went straight to the campsite. We put up our tent and roasted marshmallows and hot dogs and during the daytime we would play crochet  &nbsp;  and go swimming in the ocean.&nbsp; And of course having showers whenever you want. I had 3 showers in 1 day.    Well I had better go now    :)D

      I bet you guys didn't even miss me.   So tomorrow is Dan's (and mine, because I'm the assistant coach) tournament, one of the teams dropped out, and they want us to take their place. So instead of two games tomorrow we have three. And I am going to coach one of them. I'm a bit nervous. Colin (the coach) said that it didn't matter if they didn't win, and I believe him because I doubt the players would really draw a connection with me and their loss. One of the parents said that if the team goes undefeated for the whole season he would take the whole team out to burgers. So the team wouldn't be so happy if they lost.   Today was the last day of swim lessons for this week, and it was also our regular swim teachers day off, and so we didn't do any dry stuff today, because our different teacher was already wet and we got a lot more done.   It has been raining all week, very bad weather. Today it was cloudy, and then the sun broke through, and then it clouded over agian and we had a thuderstorm. I hate clouds, but I like thunderstorms.

      So I am going to do a blog because you guys are getting bored eh?  So we played the Saints in soccer. Our team name is the Devils. The Devils and the Saints. A pair of twins play on our team. Devin and Brendin. Their Dad said that if we go undeafeated the whole season he will take the whole team out to burgers. Tonight we are going to play the Trotters.  We are taking swimming lessons now and my best friend/my only friend is taking them in the same level as me. He also plays on our soccer team and he has a blog. urlLink    We might go to P.E.I for vacation and we just bought a double-roomed tent. The whole tent can fit into a little bag. It is so funny because, Dad takes the tent out and puts it together and there is enough room for the whole family.  But then you can squash it up and it fits in a bag!  I can't wait until 9:30. Because then we go learn how to dive in swimming lessons. Actually we already know how to dive, but it is the funnest activity in swimming.  Gotta go  :)D

      So today was the day for my root canal. It was being done by an endodontist - a root canal specialist. He did all kinds of tests, took x-rays, etc. Bottom line is that he doesn't think I need a root canal. He said, "to be honest if it was my tooth I wouldn't get a root canal". So the mystery is why I have been having the pain which has now largely but not completely subsided. He didn't have any great ideas. This sounds like a pretty unsatisfying experience & there is a small part of me that wonders if it might be something really serious. But really I am quite happy to still have my tooth intact. He had given up his lunch hour to see me so I took him a bottle of wine & his staff a bunch of chocolate bars. So at the end of the appointment he slapped me on the shoulder and said, "so do you want your bottle of wine back now". He was a nice guy.   Sammy has taken to walking around in the buck most of the time. Today he was wearing a big winter hat & nothing else. And then he was wearing flip flops and nothing else. Our neighbor called to tell us that he was sitting on the front lawn wearing only a shirt with his bits exposed. He also likes to 'attack' dad wrestler-style naked. This provides quite a view from across the room.

      Whopeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!! Tomorrow is the first day of swim lessons. I love swimming, and I swim A LOT, and I am going into level 12 (last level) and I'm quite exited. Dan said yesterday "Whoa, your going into level TWELVE??!! When you pass I want to shake your hand." So you see I'm under a lot of pressure.   Yesterday we rented a veggie tales movie called the ballad of little joe...the movie was ok, but the silly song was really funny. They had it set up like a music video, the group was called the boyz in the sink, and the lyrics were really funny. It was all about how Mr. Lunt was telling his girlfriend something that he was keeping a secret from her... the fact that he didn't have a bellybutton. You will have to see the movie to know how good it is.   No other news...will sign off now.

      I had a surreal conversation with a 12 year old named Susan at church today. She said Matthew had told her all about his restaurant Deep Sea Chicken. He hired Susan's sister on the spot. However felt that Matt doubted Sue had what it took to work at Deep Sea Chicken. At this point I was starting to wonder about this conversation. She said Matt told her he was planning to form a committee to brainstorm ideas for a site. Sue suggested an abandoned restaurant building "that place is close to your house, right?" Had she actually gone scouting for possible locations? At this point I had to stop myself from blurting out, "you know its not real, right?". I fear Matt may have drawn this girl into his imaginary world a little too much.  I had a toothache last week & will be booked for my first ever root canal tomorrow. Right now I am on antibiotics which is just about killing me. There are the regular side effects of being tired, low energy, stomach upset etc. as the pills systematically kill all the good & bad intestinal flora. But you are supposed to take them 2 hours after you eat & an hour before you eat & not before bed. But the problem is there are rarely times during the day when my stomach has been free from food for 3 hours.   The kids watched a new Veggie Tales movie with a music video by "Boys in the sink" called "I have to tell you somethin' / I ain't got no belly button" (this is sung by a gourd) Somehow this just all struck us as very funny & we have replayed it many times. See it soon & see it often.  I should also warn you about a movie I watched with Debs called "The Notebook" Did I mention it already? It got very good reviews but it isn't really that good at all. Mystic River is a very good movie (out in video) Also "House of Sand and Fog". Watch these 2, avoid the Notebook.

      Oh, well it is time to blog  Yesterday was canada day as you all know, and the kids really wanted to celebrate, so I made a pizza and cake. Unfortunately the cakes didn't really come off the pan ideally, and so one of them had the bottom all ripped up, and they other one was completely ripped up. It was going to be a layered cake anyway though, so I just put the ripped apart pieces of cake at the bottom and then put the cake with the top still intact on the top. It tasted fine. The kids were busy finding red and white things the whole day. I painted my toe nails with little canada flags on the big toes, and I painted the little toes with red and white stripes. I also wore my Canada Eh! shirt. Dan and sarah went to the drug store later on and got gummy worms and a big bottle of pop. We used the gummy worms to spell canada on the cake, as an alternative to red and white icing. Then we went and watched the fire works. It was pretty cool, but there was a big cloud, so some of the fire works that were fairly low in the sky we couldn't see. We all sang O Canada while they were going off, it was a very nice time.  Today I went to a bead store, and bought some beads. It was a lot of fun, but I don't really like the owner, and she was working today, so I exited early. Then I came home, and here I am now. Today has been pretty boring.

      Happy Canada Day and stuff.  I took Kate, Dan, Sarah and Matt to watch fireworks tonight. We went down along the coast a fair way away from the hussle and bustle of downtown Halifax. A few other people had the same idea so we stood there together and watched the fireworks from a distance. There was a lot of OOuing and AHhing. Then Matt said, "We should sing O Canada." He said it in such a cute way we all laughed. But I noticed that the laughter sort of turned into a nervous chuckle. One guy got up and got Matt a couple of Canada flags that he had in his car. Matt past one to a woman sitting in front of him and started waving the one he was holding. Then Matt started singing O Canada. Everyone joined in. Matt has this way of turning ordinary things into spectacular things. It was a lot of fun and I'll bet the people who were there will remember it for a while.

      This is Sarah blogging. Hello. Matthew has a new job at the beach. He is called the "Sunscreen Supervisor". The lifeguards made him a badge today. It says,"Sunscreen Supervisor on it". He goes up to people and says, "Excuse me, do you have sunscreen on?" If they say no he says, "You need to put it on. The lifeguards have some if you need it". It really makes me embarrassed to have my brother has the sunscreen supervisor but I bear it. I am always the first one in the water this summer. The other kids think it is too cold. So I'm making little tickets that say you have to put sunscreen on. Matt will give them to each person that doesn't have sunscreen on & tell them to read it. The lifeguards also made a badge for Sam that says, "Sam the sand supervisor". He always likes to play in the sand. Matthew made a flag for Deep Sea Chicken's army camp. But he keeps changing the design. So stay tuned.   I am so happy because it is Canada Day today. We had homemade pizza & chips. We had a huge cake with ice cream for dessert & a bottle of pop. Boy wasn't that great. Our best friend Debbie is here to visit although a lot of people have come to take her on trips because they miss her. Tonight people came & took her away.   Almost every night I have worries although I can't remember what much of them are. Mommy is working too hard these days. She does a lot of work & she looks tired tonight. She also gives us a lot of dates.   Once when we were about to pick up mommy & Debbie from downtown, mommy decided that she would give me a treat. So I chose a lemon square. It was really nice. I love her a lot.   Daddy has some ant poisoning & I had to use it for a long time before the ants ate it all up. Then more ants came looking to see if there was more poison for them. Ant poison is a lot tastier than other foods (to the ants - I didn't taste it because it is poison) That was fun watching them because they had almost a straight line of ants. They are gone now.

      As you may know Matthew lost his first tooth. This has been quite exciting for him (despite the tooth fairy being so busy she forgot to stop in last night). Even Sam seems to be deeply moved by this experience. The first thing we heard him say to the lifeguard on the beach this morning was, "Matthew lost his tongue!"

      Well I have been silent far too long. Whenever I think of writing something I get to the blog and someone has already told the story. Marsha even mentioned the nausea thing. I have since made a solemn promise to myself about "amusement" park rides that go in circles. Never again will I ride one. What is amusing about wanting to barf for four hours after a five minute ride? They should call them abusement parks or something. Then again, women go through three to nine months of nausea for a something that takes less time than one of those abusement park rides (based on a Statscan stat for Hmm-Hmm).  I got a phone call today from a head hunter. They said they got my name from somewhere (but would not tell me where). I was surprised by my reaction to this event. I actually liked it that someone wanted me even though they are probably working their way through the phone book and I happen to be first on the list. If this is how big business recruits I imagine they have to work through a lot of people to get the right ones. Unless of course maybe someone really did pass my name along. Maybe it was someone I work with! Maybe they are trying to get rid of me! Oh - now I don't feel so good anymore. Anyhow, I will be turning them down. It is nice to be wanted though.

      I am staring at a potato bug crawling across the desk. It is very interesting.  Matthew lost his first tooth today, and so he was going on and on and on about how it was his special day, and we weren't supposed to ruin it for him. This is especially not a good thing when I am babysitting, because it involves matt saying that he is allowed to have a piece of raisin toast because it is his special day, and me saying no, and then matt stealing it...twice. Then when I got mad at him and told him he was going to have an early bedtime--it was about 5 minutes to his bedtime--he started screaming and started to hit me. I told Dan to take him upstairs, and to not tell him a story, and then matt started kicking and screaming that we were ruining his special day some more and when Dan finally wrestled him upstairs he took the first chance he got and came back down. At this point I was really mad, and I called dad, frantically hoping that the movie hadn't started yet. Dad let matt stay up for an extra 30 minutes past his bed time. Well Matthew shut-up so I guess that was ok. Now they are all in bed. Yesssss!!  Today we were at the beach, and there was an old lady (like in here seventies, or even early eighties)e wearing a bathing suit that looked like it hadn't been updated since the 40's or 50's. It was violently purple, with gold buttons, and it had like a small skirt at the bottom. It was made of a kind of fabric that wrinkled, you would have to see it to know what I mean. It was kind of glossy, and it was definitely not skin tight, it was more hanging off of her. The woman was also wearing very large amounts of rouge, only it wasn't rubbed into her face, so it looked like she just dipped her fingers in and dabbed a little bit on each cheek. It was very odd, and it made me wonder if she had Alzheimers or something.

      So camping. Yes. Well lest you think I am an amazing woman you should know that it took me until Thursday to clean up from last week's camping adventure (although it was 2 weeks long). This weekend we went back to PEI because Ron's brother Matt, Noellia & Noah were staying at a cottage there. I have learned some things about camping that I would like to share with you.  #1 For the organizer type person it is a LOT of work. The only acknowledgement of my work is, "Mom/honey ... you didn't bring ...? It takes me a whole day to pack & another whole day to get everything washed &amp; put away when we come back.  #2 When I sleep in a tent I have to pee. This is a bizarre phenomenon. However, in the middle of the night I have no problem with nudity because I don't want to walk to the bathroom. Both times we have been camping I have mooned the moon right beside the tent. My rationalization is that no one is awake & even if they are, I will never see them again. This really backfired this weekend. Suddenly the people at the next campsite started being very freindly to us &amp; it turns out that they live on the other side of a stand of trees from us in Halifax (they also live just on the other side of a stand of trees from us at the campsite). We quite liked them & will definately see them again. Once I've gotten to know them better I will tell them I mooned them.  #3 The campsite we went to was very popular - with a general store, small movie theatre, horseshoes, tennis, shuffleboard, large playground, recycling facility, internet cafe & exercise room. We didn't really like it. The way it was set up was that you could let your kids wander around entertaining themselves. But isn't the point of family camping to be together as a family?  They had a guy guitar playing/singing/taking requests. He asked Matt what kind of music he liked. Matt said, "I like U2 ... can you sing elevation?" The guy wasn't the best singer & couldn't remember tunes or lyrics very well, though I'm pretty sure he was sober. But I knew all his seventies songs like "Country Roads take me home" by John Denver, etc. I always sing 70's songs to the kids which they endure - barely.  So on Monday we went to the aforementioned amusement park. After being there a few hours I concluded that it was a combination of every cheezy entertainment place I had ever been to. I must mention the ride we took on the "Tilt and Whirl". You sat in one of those buckets, got twirled around & then the ride looked like a roller coaster. I tried to be brave at first but it made me so sick that after awhile I had to close my eyes &amp; keep saying, "Jesus please make him stop the ride". I was contemplating the effects of jumping out of the ride -- would I be hurt THAT badly? I was with Sam & Katelyn &amp; after awhile I broke a sweat & Katelyn's voice seemed very far away. It reminded me of when you faint. When we got off the ride, Ron told me he felt the same way (not faint though) &amp; we both vowed not to go on any more rides. This ruined the day for Ron who couldn't shake the nausea & still feels a bit sick today. He said, "thanks for going through morning sickness 5 times". I thought that was very sweet ... by Sam's pregnancy my morning sickness lasted all day every day throughout the pregnancy.  Sammy found this great ride that had bi-planes that gently went around in circles. The young braces-wearing attendant said I could ride in it with Sam but it wouldn't go up in the sky because I weighed too much. It was quite a sight to see ... me & a bunch of toddlers in the kiddie airplane ride. What I found especially funny was that half the airplanes were Nazi planes - red with the black iron cross symbol used by the Nazi airforce. I mean doesn't anyone have a can of paint? I really don't think it was politically correct. Then Sam found a kiddie ride where you sat in cars/trucks & it went around a little track while you pretended to drive it. He went on it about 18 times. The pimply-faced attendant there kept trying to get Sam to get out of the car, stand in line again & then get on the ride again. The weird thing was that there were only 2 people in line so I think it was just a power trip thing for the pimply 15 year old to boss around a bunch of 3 year olds. Must go to bed now. Hope this makes you laugh.

         Well here we go. Yesterday we went to an amusement park. They had a roller coaster and a ride called a Paratrooper, and you sit in a chair covered with a little dome attached to a spinning wheel.  At first you go in circles but after a couple spins the wheel gets tilted up like a ferris wheel and you are going in circles sideways.  Dad said he nearly threw up but I didn't feel sick at all.  Then we went on a ride in which you go in circles on a spinning wheel.  Then I started to feel really, really sick.  Finally I felt better and we went on the water slides.  They were     really fun.           That soccer game that Katelyn coached was one I won't forget. One of the people on the other team flicked the ball away from me and then would kick me in the shin to make it look like and accident to the ref.  That same person was the one who jumped on Brendin the goalie. Ouch It must have hurt!          :)D

      Sorry Melanie and Aimee but allowances must be made. I didn't blog on friday, and then we went camping for the weekend again, and there was an internet cafe at the place where we were, but it didn't work, and besides it was 5 dollars for the first hour, and 4 dollars for all the hours after that. So as you can see I couldn't really blog about it.  So anyway I wasn't really nervous when I was at home, but as soon as I got in the van I started getting really nervous. What if Colin (head coach) hadn't given one of the parents the balls so there wouldn't be a game ball, or balls to do drills with? What if there aren't enough players? What if nobody listens to me????  Well, Colin had given the balls to one of the parents, so we had lots of balls to do drills with, and we had a decent game ball. There were enough players, and only one sub, and nobody listened to me. That wasn't really a problem though because I had a whistle, and I would blow it in peoples ears (yes, I am so mature). In the end though, I told them that the last one to look at me, and listen to me would be off the field at the beginning, and that (for some strange reason) worked. Anyway the rest was cake, even though we had a bad ref. The only othere interesting thing that happened was that as the other team was running up for a goal our goalie ran (not far) and saved it, and he was on the ground, and one person from the other team jumped on him, and kicked the ball into the net. This was not a goal, but it hurt the goalie. Since half the team was on holidays, we didn't have a backup goalie, so we had to leave him in. Thankfully there was only one minute or so until the end of the game. We won the game 2-0
