       *since livejournal is bein a douchebag today, ive deided to post at blogspot*  Yah...i havent had a serious entry in weeks! Wel...me-serious..not your typical serious...so lets sit down and ponder about what we should make this entry about!  *sits down and ponders* WOW ok!! lets talk about school life!!  Weelll...recently we had a double-header assembly! they combined two assemblies to make one giant borin useless assembly! ass.... ok...the first assembly was about prejudidism and hate! i thought it was pretty ironic how they were jus bein prejudice themselves..ahem..i dun feel like gettin into detail cause..i dunno i dun fell like it @_@   they also showed us FRESHMAN a video on how youre not supposed to drink and drive...we are only 14 damnit!! i think any kid whos rebelious to underage drink in the first place, is not goin to go, "hey guys, im pretty drunk. maybe i should listen to my teacher and nominate a designated driver!' NO. teachers even know themselves that theyre not gonna listen. they jus tell us this shit so when some dumbarse DOES go and drives himself into a pole because he was drunk, they can go, "well i told him so" so they can make themselves look good. if there is one thing i learned in school, its that all teachers are selfish, greedy, liberals who were hippies when they were younger, so now that they are older, they jus LOVE the fact that they can boss other kids around and...  omg...*chugs down a bottle of tranquilizer pills* calm down lauren..deep breaths..ok...woo...  Ahem..well anyways i got another detention in ms xclass..she is enjoyin this way too much...gawd..its really funny how mean i am to her tho...  *me and kait are talkin* Msx: You guys gotta shush!! Me: No you shush *goes rite back to talkin*  Well because im the.."class clown" of sorts, she knows that im jus kiddin..or am i..muha..muhah...MUHAHAHAH!!! Err...  MsX always takes her shoes off durin class too jus to annoy me..shell sit on her chair, in a vulgar way as always (you know what i mean kait *kait is in my english class with me*)..and then shed kick off her shoes and wave those NASTY ass feet at us...oh gawd..i feel sick jus thinkin about it..i tell her to stop all the time..she jus laughs..sigh..what a fun-fun teacher she is @_@  ...er..and we also had a picnic recently..at school..sigh..me n my one friend jus kinda meandered like dorks o_O yah..i did bust sum phat moves tho when dat dj was spinnin out those whack tunes, yo...um..major lol cause i wasnt really dancin..i was..mock dancin..and..um..ok who the fuck cares o___o;;;    Sigh..ive also been pretty bummed out lately...im lookin closer at my "friend relationships" (like with kait n kyle n stuff) and..i dunno..it jus seems like people only hang out with me cause i joke around so much..i guess i dug my own grave tho..i shouldnt really expect people to take me seriuosly anymore..mega sigh... so..ah if i wasnt so socialy dependent (aka i talk too much  o_O) id become one of dem loner peoples..yah...  *sits back and looks at her entry*  @___@;;;    Err...time for me to shut up already XP   *hands out free money to everyone who sat through this long journal thingy* Congatulations, young grasshopper, you have a will as strong as a thousand dragons..   *bows and leaves as a gong crashes*
