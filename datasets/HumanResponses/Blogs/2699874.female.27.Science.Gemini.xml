						   Had a peaceful slumber for 3 hours. That was refreshing!! Now, i'm watching this program on TV, "World Idol". It's quite interesting. Why would anyone want to be a world idol and how does one become an idol anyway? Well, I guess they sing and they slug it out with horrible judges on the stage. I have an ordinary voice...I'm out of tune at times and I can't handle that kind of criticism. So, I guess I can never be an idol then? But I like the idol from Canada and Polland. They've got spunk! Well, I guess the key is standing out and making an impression.   Conversation about relationships  Had a conversation with a friend of mine about my relationship or my lack of it right now. I'm just so tired. It robs me off of my strength and happiness just thinking about it. I promised that it'll be my last time to talk about it. I'll give my emotions a rest for awhile. So, I won't be mentioning it in my blog anymore. Unless something nice happens. I'm still hoping things would turn out better.   Comment

						   I bumped my forehead while talking a poop. =) I guess I didn't notice the tissue holder nearby. Now, I have a big bump on my forehead...considering my forehead is such a prominent feature of mine. Oh well..next time, i gotta be careful. Teehee!   Comment

						    Kung Hei Fat Choi!  Well, it's the year of the monkey. I don't know what this year will bring. But hope it'll bring happiness and good fortune to everyone!  On a different note, I just came home from the hospital. It was pretty benign. I think I had about less than 8 patients today. They let us go around 4pm so the day went by without me noticing. My ex and I are still not talking to each other. It's what he wants. I don't know why he wants it that way. Hope he gets pass it and we become friends again. It's particularly hard. I dread seeing him in the hallways. I hate ignoring him but I got to give in to what he wants. I don't want to push anything on him and insist on becoming friends. It is heartbreaking.  Things to do: 1. Return the VCDs later 2. Get haircut on Sunday 3. Buy a blouse for myself   Cheated  I was cheated today by someone I know. But, surprisingly I didn't mind. Just hope she won't get used to it. The person she cheats from might not be as forgiving the next time around.      Comment

						    The Fickle Minded Princess  Once upon a time, there was this lucky girl who was treated like a princess by two handsome princes. But one day, this lucky spoiled brat just decided to mess it all up. Taking a break from both of them just because she says “I’M CONFUSED”. She was always confused. Never really knew how to decide for herself. She could blame it on how she was raised as a child. Being the youngest and all, she always had her way. She always had her mom, dad and sisters to decide for her. Now, she’s reaping the consequences of her actions. Is it the time for her to realize that life is what she makes out of it? I hope so. I hope it’s not too late for her.....and that she'll live happily everafter.   Comment

						   My friend Richi sent this link to me. We are both fans of the LOTR book and I was a little skeptical about the movie. But, I do like the movie now. It did justice to the book..but of course a few things were changed and left out. Check out the link.   urlLink Jack Flannel's Nit Picker's Guide to LOTR      Comment

						   I was watching “Just Shoot Me” on TV when my phone rang. It was my mom telling me about a terrible news. My eldest sister got into an accident. She was held up and stabbed ten times. I went cold. I’ve seen this scene before in a movie. I never thought it could happen in real-life….in my life.  I never got along with my eldest sister. At times, I swear I don’t want to see her anymore. You see, she’s adopted. My dad and mom never thought they’d be able to bear children so they adopted my sister after 11 miscarriages. For eight years, she was an only child and was my dad’s apple of the eye. But then two miracles happened to my parents. My mom and dad were blessed with two children at their ripe ages of 38 and 40 respectively. Then, the issue of parentage became something of a problem to my sister. She became insecure and unsure of herself. She would throw tantrums and fought with us and our parents. She would always have this “showdown” (as we call it) with my mom, my second sister and I. But when it comes to my dad, she was different. I guess she was scared to lose my dad’s approval. Through her college days, she struggled with herself and her identity. She spent almost eight years trying to finish a 4-year-course that she said she was forced to take.  Then in 1994, my dad died. I moved to Manila with her. I studied in a university and she worked in a nearby bank. At times, she’d still have her showdowns, this time only with me. I began to believe her and lost the confidence I had. She had this knack of knowing where it really hurts. There were a couple of times that I really wanted to leave her alone and live separately. I remember this one time I didn’t speak to her for 3 months. I rented a place on my own and she had her own place, too. Came Christmas time and we still weren’t talking. Somehow, my mom got us back to talk to each other. Then, we lived together again this time with my second sister. After sometime, she left us again. She had an argument my second sister. She lived by herself for awhile until my mom interfered again. Then, came the third time.  It was last month, almost Christmas time. My mom visited us for the holidays. I can still remember that day. I came home from a busy 24-hr duty. I was so tired that I wanted to sleep. I hurriedly ate my breakfast and asked our cousin to get me water. My eldest sister angrily informed me to get it myself. I ignored her and continued to eat. Then, after I finished my food I went to the ref and saw a bag of chocolates. It was my cousin’s. I asked if I could have some and she said yes, but I saw that it was still unopened. So, I asked my cousin to do the honors of opening it so I could have some. Out of nowhere, my eldest sister shouted and I was shocked that I asked, “What’s your problem?” That further infuriated her… and I shouted back. That started the major showdown which ended up with tears in our eyes (including my mom’s) and with my eldest sister leaving. I’ve said some hurtful stuff. I remember telling her that adopting her was the biggest mistake my parents ever had. I squirm right now just thinking how much it could have hurt her.  After that incident, she stayed somewhere and we didn’t bother to know where. She came home after the holidays and stayed with us during the weekdays. Then, on the weekends, she went somewhere else. I didn’t talk to her or even thought of trying to. I simply wanted her out of my life….and I almost did.  I feel guilty and responsible for what has happened to her. Maybe if I controlled myself, we wouldn’t have fought and she wouldn’t have been in that place at that time. I feel so sorry. I feel terrible. I wish I could have prevented it. But, I guess it’s too late. I have to deal with what’s left for me to do now. I guess I’m still lucky that my sister is still alive and that those evil muggers didn’t stab her where it’s deadly. They say that you realize how important a person to you only when you’ve lost her/him. Thankfully, I’m given a second chance for I haven’t really lost her. Now, I know that I still care for her. After all, she’s my sister.    Comment

						   Joined this Friendster thing last month. It's weird. Thought I have a few friends. But, it's just a month and I have 31 friends! It's nice to know that the world isn't that lonesome. :)   Work  Work was good today. I'm having fun again. I had 2 cute little angels for patients last night. They were soo cute and chubby. I kissed them both and they wouldn't wanna leave until saying "goodbye" to me. James was 4 years old and John was 3. They both weigh around 29kgs! Boy, they made my day! :)   Comment

						   Klutz! That's me. As I was about to sleep last night, I stood up and closed the lights. Then, proceeded to jump into bed. Little did I know I was going to bump my nose right into the table! Geez! It bled for a few seconds. Hope I won't have bruises or I'll look like someone's been punching me on the face!     Plans   My sis left for Tagaytay with another of those planning sessions for IBM. I'm left by myself here at home. So, I gotta organize and sort out my sked.  1. Clean the house 2. Give a friend a call 3. Go to the mall and get a haircut 4. Buy stuff I need   Comment

						   I don't know what's with this day that makes people crazy in love. Well, i guess it's just an excuse to show how one loves the other. Personally, I think there shouldn't be just one day to compel one to show his/her love to the special person he/she loves. I think it could be anything ...a piece of rock, a restaurant or a picture...that could remind one of his/her love and feelings to another. I guess basically valentine's day is any day that u chose to show ur feelings to one person you want to share your life with.  Who's Valentine anyway? From what I recall, he's Saint Valentine. So, who was Saint Valentine and how did he become associated with this ancient rite of gift giving on Feb 14?   Got this from:   urlLink  The History of Valentine's Day    Today, the Catholic Church recognizes at least three different saints named Valentine or Valentinus, all of whom were martyred. One legend contends that Valentine was a priest who served during the third century in Rome. When Emperor Claudius II decided that single men made better soldiers than those with wives and families, he outlawed marriage for young men -- his crop of potential soldiers. Valentine, realizing the injustice of the decree, defied Claudius and continued to perform marriages for young lovers in secret. When Valentine's actions were discovered, Claudius ordered that he be put to death. Other stories suggest that Valentine may have been killed for attempting to help Christians escape harsh Roman prisons where they were often beaten and tortured.   According to one legend, Valentine actually sent the first 'valentine' greeting himself. While in prison, it is believed that Valentine fell in love with a young girl -- who may have been his jailor's daughter -- who visited him during his confinement. Before his death, it is alleged that he wrote her a letter, which he signed 'From your Valentine,' an expression that is still in use today. Although the truth behind the Valentine legends is murky, the stories certainly emphasize his appeal as a sympathetic, heroic, and, most importantly, romantic figure. It's no surprise that by the Middle Ages, Valentine was one of the most popular saints in England and France.       Comment

						   Went out with Josie and Sheila tonight. Watched a movie called "Mona Lisa's Smile". Made me think about my future. It's a nice movie. A little warning though, don't bring any guy along. I don't think they'll be comfortable watching it. It's for girls only, i think.

						   Got a call from my mom late this evening. And I found out that a distant relative got infected by Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy a.k.a. "Mad Cow Disease". More popularly known to me in med school as Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease. I used to have difficulty spelling it in my pop quizzes back in Microbiology classes. Anyway, from what i recall, it is caused not by a virus or a bacteria but a PRION. It is a progressive neurological disorder of cattle that results from infection by a prion.  In review, I went to the CDC webpage and looked for CJD infection:   Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rapidly progressive, invariably fatal neurodegenerative disorder believed to be caused by an abnormal isoform of a cellular glycoprotein known as the prion protein. CJD occurs worldwide and the estimated annual incidence in many countries, including the United States, has been reported to be about one case per million population.   The vast majority of CJD patients usually die within 1 year of illness onset. CJD is classified as a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) along with other prion diseases that occur in humans and animals. In about 85% of patients, CJD occurs as a sporadic disease with no recognizable pattern of transmission. A smaller proportion of patients (5 to 15%) develop CJD because of inherited mutations of the prion protein gene. These inherited forms include Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome and fatal familial insomnia.    Anyway, my relative is in a really bad condition. Prognosis is poor. I pray she'd improve.  For all those meat-lovers like me, this is really scary. And there's another disease that has affected fowls, "Bird Flu". So, what do I EAT NOW??!! Geez, the only fish species I like to eat are salmon and yellow-fin tuna. hmmm...yummy!   Comment

						   Well, I became Phoebi Dorithi's Godmother yesterday. She's a daughter of my friend's cousin. I really don't know her mom very much but I guess she wanted me as a godmother. So, what the heck! I went anyway. I was late for the ceremony but at least I got there before they were done. Then, after the ceremony, we went to Max's at Jupiter Street. I had to eat which totally ruined my diet. Hey, the food was ok, at least.  A Pic o' me at the Baptism  urlLink     Posted by Leis

						   I got a forwarded email from a friend about this joke. It's funny but true. Filipinos are very traditional and can sometimes be predictable. But, we are who we are. Nothing's wrong with that as long as it does not hurt anybody.  David Letterman's Filipino Joke David Letterman's Top Ten reasons why there couldn't be a Filipino-America U.S. President:  10. White House is not big enough for in-laws and extended relatives. 9. Not enough parking spaces at White House for 2 Honda Civics,Toyota Celica,1985 Mercedes Benz Diesel, BMW (big mean wife) and MPV (My Pinoy Van). 8. Dignitaries generally intimidated by eating with fingers at State dinners. 7. Too many dining rooms in the White House - where will they put the Last Supper picture? 6. White House walls not big enough to hold giant wooden spoon and fork. 5. Secret Service Staff won't respond to "psssst, psssst". 4. Secret Service Staff uncomfortable driving presidential car with Rosary hanging on the rear view mirror or the statuette of Santo Nino on the dashboard. 3. No budget allocation to purchase karaoke machines in every White House room. 2. State Dinners do not allow "Take Home". AND THE NUMBER ONE REASON : 1. AIR FORCE ONE does not allow overweight balikbayan boxes!

						   I went to UP review class today. I had a terrible headache. I guess I'm not used to taking exams in awhile. I had an average score just like most of the students there. But, I still plan to take the exam on Feb so I'll have more time to prepare.  Wimbledon 2004 urlLink    On other things, Maria Sharapova surprisingly defeated Serena Williams, the defending champion, in straight sets 6-1, 6-4. The awarding ceremony was funny and emotional. As for the guys, my favorite Mario Ancic lost to Roddick. Shucks! He's cute..and full of potential. Now, I have someone to cheer on in tennis. :)   I remember years ago during my teens. I used to place bets with my dad for Stefan Edberg and him on the otherhand, on Pete Sampras. I lost but it was fun shouting encouragement to my favorite even if it was only in front of the TV. :) Fun times.

						   I've decided to take my medical licensure exam on February instead of August. I think I need some more time to rest. But, I still have a ton of exams to take, like TOEFL, TSE, CGFNS and NCLEX. My hands are still full...so, I don't necessarily have that much rest afterall. My mom thought my decision was outrageous. But, I just don't want to study that intensely right now. I've been studying for like 22 years in my entire life!     On Other Things...  Just spoke with my friend, Lolly. She's doing really well over at New Jersey. I'm so glad for her! She has a boyfriend now..his name is Kevin. Haven't met the guy...so, I'm wondering if he's nice. :)I bet he is.  Anyway, got some time in my hands right now since I've postponed my exam to February. I've been watching Wimbeldon 2004 on TV. There's a pretty Siberian girl named Maria Sharapova, who surprising everybody! She's being compared to Kournikova..oh well, I think she's prettier. Here are their pics. You be the judge.  Maria Sharapova&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink    Anna Kournikova&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink      Also, I've been doing some baking. The other day I made a healthy "Pineapple & Banana Muffin". It was my first attempt in baking. Surprisingly enough, everyone seemed to enjoy it. Or maybe they just didn't want to hurt my feelings. I'll try to post the recipe or if anyone's interested, just email me.  Oh, I just remembered...I got this email from a friend of mine. I wonder why he said he was going to call but never did. Hope he's okay. I'll try to give him a call when I manage to get some phonecards.

						   My mom visited us for the weekend and attended a wedding of a cousin. We were relatives of the bride who is still so young! Oh well, her groom is also quite young. But, they have decided to raise a family at so tender of age. Anyway, the wedding was nice. Saw my relatives from the Llorin clan. The after-the-wedding reception was nice and food was great, served buffet style. There goes my diet! Ah heck!  Then afterwards, my close relatives and my family decided to spend time over at Eastwood City. We had buffet again at "Twist of ??Migos??" Forgot the name of the restaurant. I had some Rockefeller Oysters, Smoked tuna belly (Yum! Yum!), Roasted beef and some dessert. Oh boy, I could not barely walk for being so full! Then, we walked around and had a chocolate drink from Coffee Been and Tea Leaf. Gosh, I totally pigged out. But, I had fun!  My mom left early this morning. Miss her already! :)

						   I remember a year ago when my friend Maricon and I had a terrible argument. I thought it was the end of our friendship. We lost our trust in each other and pretty much drifted apart. No phone calls. No text messages nor email. We totally lost interest in communicating for almost 1 1/2 years. I was busy with clerkship and she was busy with life mostly.  A month ago I got this text message from her telling me she would like to meet up. Well, I was worried that it would just open up another episode of heartaches and disappointments. But nevertheless, I decided to meet up with her a week ago. It seems like things haven't changed. We talked and updated each other. Suffice to say, the meeting went well.  Now, we are talking on the phone again. Sending text messages. ..It's like discovering our friendship all over again. I hope it's lovelier the second time around.

						   I went out with my friends yesterday. We ate at this Shawarma house called "Mister Kebab". The place wasn't that fancy and food was affordable. So, it wasn't a surprise to see a lot of people eating there. I had the usual dish ordered, Shawarma. It was not bad. Actually, it was good. I'm planning to do a version of my own. So, for this weekend, I'm planning to buy some pita bread and other ingredients. Can't wait!  As for my baking prowess, I recently baked another bunch of muffins. I did another bunch called "Apple and Cheese Muffin". I used 125g of an expensive ricotta cheese. It was okay but it was not popular among my sister and friends. They told me to stick with my "Pineapple and Banana Muffin". Oh well, there goes my experiment!   Plans  1. Take CGFNS. - apply for CGFNS - go to PRC for requirements - make arrangement for finances 2. Take TOEFL and TSE - inquire about examination dates, fees, etc 3. Review for exams: CGFNS, TOEFL, TSE and Medical boards 4. Renew driver's license next week. Deadline: July 15, 2004. 5. Inquire about NCLEX

						   My friend Jenny's Lolo passed away today. Such a waste! He was a gentle old man with a commanding intelligence whom I met a year ago. Apparently, he died of the complications of pneumonia. At an old age of 80, pneumonia can be fatal. My condolences go out to the Frogozo family for the great loss they've had.  My friends and I are paying our respects tomorrow at Arlington Memorial in Araneta Avenue. Let's all pray for the soul of Mr. Desiderio T. Frogozo.

						   I went to UP review at 8am. Met up with my friends Jenny, Lhoi, Rommel, Sammy and Leo. We took 2 exams in Pharmacology and Ob-Gyn. I had passing marks again which ain't bad considering I haven't studied on those subjects.   Then afterwards, my sister, cousin, Leo and I went to Rockwell Rustan's Supermart to buy groceries. We ended up deciding on cooking Rosemary Chicken and Potatoes. We bought a whole chicken and fresh spices like rosemary, tarragon, basil, parsley and others. Then, we went to mass at Our Lady of Guadalupe Church in Makati. Got home around 9pm. So, we started cooking. Placed the chicken inside the oven at around 9:30pm. We had to wait for an hour and 15 minutes for it to cook. Boy, we were so hungry! At around 11pm, we devoured the entire chicken!! hehehe You can say that we were stuffed!  After eating, I watched the Wimbledon Men's Finals between Federer and Roddick. Federer eventually won. I liked Roddick more though. He has a big serve at 143 mph!! Can you believe that?!

						   I've been following this reality show on TV, "The Amazing Race 5". It's really gets you hooked. My sister, Ate Nene, hates it because of the tension and anticipation. Those are the reasons why I really like the show! :)  I'm supposed to enjoy the via sattelite episode but Studio23 went weird, losing it's sattelite feed and all. They didn't even advise the viewers about it!! Geez, talk about great timing! So, i'll have to settle for the primetime showing on AXN. Goes to show Studio23 is full of crap.

						   I don't know why I was unusually emotional last night. I keep muttering "I miss you, papa" in my sleep. And I woke up crying. I miss my dad terribly that I wonder what it would be like if he was still alive. He never saw his two girls graduate from college who went further by finishing two courses each.  My dad died when I was 17 years old. I was fresh in college. Literally, unaware of the life in Metro Manila. You see, I was born and bred in Naga City, a city in the province of Camarines Sur. I finished my kindergarten years up to High School from a Catholic Chinese school called Saint Joseph School. Then, I finally went to college in a prestigious university, University of the Philippines Manila, where I took up BSN.  I was trying to adjust to college life when my dad suddenly went very ill. He was hospitalized back in our province and was transferred to a hospital here in Manila. Every weekend, my sister and I would spend time with him in the hospital. I remember my dad saying, "I'd buy you a car soon." He still had dreams for his children...he was still hoping to spend most of his lifetime with us. But, he died on the 4th day of September.  I had to leave school for a week. Since it was almost the end of the semester, I had to leave reports and exams for awhile..and worry about it after all the tragedy was over. We buried our dad in a cemetery in his hometown. Trying to put up a brave front, my sister and I went back to Manila.  Back in college, I had to turn in my reports late. I distinctly remember one professor, Prof. Teresita Hernandez. She was known to be strict and heartless. But nevertheless, I tried to appeal to her sympathetic side. So, I approached her trying to explain why my report was late. But she brusquely told me, "You should have started that report before your dad died!" I tried to explain that my dad was ill for four months and that I had to stay with him in the hospital but she basically just ignored me. Some people are just heartless. I wonder how she is today...hope she has changed for her own sake.  Oh, how I wish my dad was still alive. I miss him terribly.

						   Well, I don't have internet access back in Naga so I've decided to write my journal the old fashioned way. Anyway, my sister, Cheryll, Leo and I are off to Naga for a week long vacation. Part of the vacation is the celebration of my Ate Nene's 29th birthday on the 24th of July. I'm quite excited! I'll be taking pictures with my digital camera.

						   Saw this column on MSN. Just thought I'd share this with you guys.    CAN EXES BE FRIENDS??   Wouldn't life be a little sweeter if we could all just get along? But when it comes to exes, bad blood too often taints the mix. The weird thing is, theoretically, you used to think this guy was the bomb! Even if you don't exactly miss being his significant other, maybe you do miss his hilarious sense of humor, his lasagna and the ways he really "gets" you as a person.   Okay, so the party's over, but does that mean you drop out of each other's lives forever? Transitioning from breakup to buddies is a tall order. Even with the best of intentions, it's not always possible to bury the baggage and make a fresh start as friends. But if you're both up for the challenge, the rewards can be great.   If you and your ex want to stay friends, make sure that you: Give it time. Changes of this magnitude doesn't happen overnight. After a split, there will inevitably be issues to resolve, lives to reconfigure, feet to be gotten back on. It may take a couple of years or more before relating in a whole new way is really workable.   Disconnect old buttons. Didn't it drive you nuts, the way he always left his dirty socks on the floor? Know what? It's not your problem anymore. Detach from old judgments and irritations that bedeviled your former days as a couple. Remember the bigger-picture stuff you really like about him, and let the picky stuff go.   Dredge for grudges. If grudges lay buried in your inner underground, employ grudge-removal techniques forthwith. Whether your style is to sort it out in a journal, with a therapist or by beating hand drums and burning sage, do your homework and work it through. You can't expect to have an honest friendship until you harbor no hard feelings.   Clarify boundaries. Are you absolutely sure you're ready to be friends, and just friends? Is a little tiny part of you secretly yearning to re-spark the old flame, or have a roll in the hay for old times' sake? If so, stop right there. It's not yet time to pursue a platonic friendship if romantic intentions still reside within either of you. Wish each other well, and proceed with establishing your own separate lives for now.   Jettison jealousy. Nobody's expecting you to love the one your ex is with now, but do respect their relationship and be cordial, at least. Still, a little jealousy can be a natural reaction, turning that hip dinner for four suddenly unappetizingly cold and crusty. Suck it up and be nice. Besides, she's the one who gets to deal with that nasty sock habit now.   Offer the olive branch. Accompany it with a slice of humble pie. Forgive yourself, and him, for blunders and bygones. It's a delicate operation, but with wisdom, patience, and care, you can welcome this man you once held most dear, back into your inner circle. Like the old campfire song says, "Make new friends and keep the old. One is silver and the other gold."

						   The Cat Who Bit Us  urlLink     Because my sister and I are such cat lovers, we forgot to be cautious during our trip back home. This cute little cat was such a sweetie that we forgot that she has claws and sharp teeth. She bit me on my right shoulder and my sister on her left hand. So, leaving us with cat bites and injection sites from rabies vaccine &amp; tetanus toxoids. Ouch!! Bad cat!

						   My grandma often said in her own words, " Lambang gibo, pakinabangan ." It basically means "Every thing you do will come back to you." In other words, Karma. Karma (in Hinduism & Buddhism)  means "action seen as bringing upon oneself inevitable results."  I find myself living out her words. I made two people miserable because of my mistakes. And now, I'm so miserable myself. Let this be a lesson to everyone out there. Don't hurt anyone intentionally.

						   Like saying good bye to a bad habit, I've finally started on something I should have done 2 years ago. I should have taken my friends' advices and gotten rid of the ties completely. But, I guess some part of me wanted to believe that things could go on...just like before. I kept holding on. Hoping things aren't that bad afterall. But, i was mistaken. I was totally clueless in fact, downright stupid. I wish I kept my resolve as I tried putting an end on things on my many awakenings in the past. But,  I've proven to be weak one too many on those occasions.  I may have some regrets on my actions but I definitely say I was glad I had those moments with this person. He'll always be in my heart despite everything I say.

						   As I was chatting at the #upmla channel, I chatted with my friend, Lloyd. He was one of those kids who I met at an EB a few years ago. Now, he has a job of his own and is doing very well for himself. Anyway, I managed to lure him into blogging. Hopefully, I'll get to read his blog soon. :)  I've posted another of those pictures I had taken back home. This particular picture shows off my cousin's artwork. She painted the flowers on the yellow t-shirt I'm wearing as well as designed the bag I'm holding. Do I hear orders out there?? Just let me know if you're interested on acquiring a nice bag and painted shirts. It's a nice gift for someone. You know where to contact me.  Moi, modelling :)  urlLink
