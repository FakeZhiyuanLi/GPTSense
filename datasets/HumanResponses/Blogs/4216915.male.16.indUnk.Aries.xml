      sorry for the delay in this one, i know all of you were on the edge of your seats.  so summer is officially dead and is marked that way with the start of band camp.  i'm not even gonna try to stop your giggles.  so about the colors for my room...i got 3 to go on.  and boy do they rock.  the mac n' cheese is good...not sure if it would match my kick-ass lifestyle, the tye-dye one...oh, celine, what to say to that one, too cool for me, and julz with the naked painting...i have too much to say on that matter.  thank you for all the outstanding suggestions, and please do keep them coming.  so far julz is winning (because its naked? no, because she just said the color that i already told her? probably that).  hey, tune in next time when we'll talk about masturbation! 'till then, keep it easy, and keep it fresh.

      i'm sorry for all that before, and don't worry, not every "blog" (is that the right use of the word?) will be filled with that.  all right, its time to go to my "audience" (my audience being the one old guy in his bathrobe that actually reads this).  as most of you know, i'm moving into a new house and i get to pretty much design my whole room.  i actually had a bunch of people that were gonna help me, but now its just me and my paintbrush.  i need color suggestions to paint my walls (and to let you know, half of the walls are already dry-erase wallpaper, but other walls bare, wood floor, oh, wood shades that look "tropical", and a homey presence that's unbeatable.)  i don't care who you are, where you're from, what you did, as long as you........give me colors!  i'm thinking of a burnt orange of sorts, but have seen nothing but grimaces when i tell people that.   i would give you a color wheel but i can't seem to find mine...tell me crayon colors (i.e. manatee, an actual crayola color), make up colors, i could care less.  but please unload all your colors on to me.  thanks, oh, and its a contest....(?), come up with the best color and i'll paint it that and you win a prize (?), yeah, i'll do that, and i promise it won't be some chinsy thing like a piece of yarn or a licked envelope.  and.....go.  phrase of the moment: "aged to perfection" (coming from a troll doll with a shirt with that phrase, adorned with fun, grey hair, given to my father for a birthday of his awhile back, and its staring at me right now)

      clark gable...cool guy, vivien liegh...hottie, fred crane (?), thats right its gone with the wind.  saw it last night on the big screen with my marnie-belle, good times, possible disney ride?  so over the summer, i've gradually been losing some of my closest friends.  and its all my fault.  the hardest one is being scared to talk to my best friend of 10 years, because i'm sure that he hates me.  i know its my fault (for most of them) but i don't know what to do about any of them.  and it kills me.  to all of you:  i miss you and i love you.  i'm sorry for all this nostalgia and all this drama.  and back to fun, right?  its just kind of hard with tears in my eyes.  song of the moment: "lightness" by death cab for cutie

      Hey. So my name is Eli and thats all you really need to know about me. I created this blog so that enthused readers could divulge in entertaining tidbits? not at all, to let this be my outlet? maybe, because i'm cheap and this was free? thats the one. I have no idea whats gonna be on here, i don't even know if people will read this, all i can say right now is that this is the beginning. and this is me.  by the way, the whole Bill Paxton thing? yeah, one of the greatest actors of all time, and until i can think of something wittier, we're all stuck with it.
