      Well, I'm WAY tired and grumpy this morning. I've had this incredible headache I haven't been able to shake ever since my head broke this guys ribs at ultimate frisby on Saturday. It's starting to wear on me. And then last night I went out to dinner with the YQ crew and was out till like midnight, I had an awesome time, it was really fun and I got to know one of the youth leaders, Kimberly, much better, and I'm thinking God's molding another awesome relationship there!! But, when a girl who gets  at least eight hours of sleep EVERY night only gets four...it's just not a pretty thing. My sister's going back to Texas today :(. Man alive, this last week and a half with her went by FAST!! I've hardly spent any time with her and I'm not going to see her again until like december!! Oh well, God's really been working in her life and using her in incredible ways down in Texas, so I'm also glad she's going back to keep doing that. Also, I get to skip math and band to go out to lunch with her and to see her off at the airport, so it's not all bad...:)  I just finished a REALLY neat book my english teacher lent me called "Eli". It's like the story of how it might have been if Jesus had come now, in contemporary times, instead of two thousand years ago. Now, you might think that it would be really corny and gauche, like, multiplying hamburegers and fries instead of bread and fish, but it wasn't like that at all. It really made me think. For the first three-quarters of the book whenever Eli (Jesus)spoke he always sounded like someone slightly arrogant ("The ONLY way to my father is through me") and sounded like he was starting some kind of cult. I always used to think the disciples were crazy, I mean, there they were with Jesus right, and he's doing all these miracles and just has this incredible love, and they doubt him!! But then when the story's set in a time period I can really relate to I stop and ask myself, would I have followed him?? Watching the news and learning through the media what he was doing, would I believe it?? Or would I discredit him as some kind of loon?? The answer scared me... Yes, there were the miracles in the story, and Eli's incredible love and compassion is evident throughout, but when he just comes out and tells people he's the ONLY way and asks that this girl stay with him rather than go be with her dying brother... It scares me to think where I would have stood if asked if I believed or not. I always used to be kind of jealous that I didn't live in a time when I could have actually seen adn hugged my Lord, but now, now I guess I'm thankful that I didn't, and that I have the new testament of the bible to be able to clearly see my hope of salvation. John 1:16, "From the fulness of His grace we have all received on blessing after another." one of my favorite verses, just the fact that I was born in the 20th century is one of these awesome blessings!! OK, major subject change, I can't wait to talk to Cheryl tonight!! I hope Kenji and I can finish up at YQ fairly quickly so we have lots of time to talk to her. I kind of feel guilty though, because she has to stay up way late to talk to us (because of the time change), but then Kenj and I just get to turn in at the same time as always. Oh well, I'm selfish and just happy to hear from her. God bless!!

      Good morning!! It's a great morning, if only because it's friday!! Today the camera people from the TV show on ABC family called 'Switched' are coming because a violist in our orchestra got switched. I'm excited because that means I get to sit in the choir room and catch up on my schoolwork all of first hour because I opted not to get filmed in orchestra. It's kind of funny, since using copies of music in the classroom is still kind of a gray area, my teacher like ordered us all to leave our Tchaicovsky and Mozart at home and sight read a Jr. High version of Pirates of the Carribean because it's the only music she has enough intact originals of. Sorry, but I personally don't want to be on national TV sightreading a Jr. High piece, and probably slaughtering it too, my orchestra isn't exactly the king of sightreading if you know what I mean.  Well, my oldest sister went to big up her friend Joel from the airport in Salt Lake. From what I've heard he's a pretty neat guy. He's a puerto rican chef and sounds pretty nice. I'm a little nervous to meet him though because I always feel like he might like my sister a little less because she has such obnoxious siblings. And if their relationship becomes anything serious I don't want him thinking that I'm an annoying little terd (even if I am!!). So I could really use some prayers there because I really don't want to embaress Carla.  Well, I'm missing Cheryl like ten more times than I normally do because I talked to her just on Wednesday. I thought I was starting to get over her leaving, and then I heard her voice...argh, not good stuff. ooh, my stomach calls again, amazing how it runs my life!!

      I just went on this like hour long bike ride with my little sister. It was WAY awesome, we went out in the country and it smelt so yummy. The lilacs and tulips and weeds and, well, just all those lovely country smells!! It was my dad's birthday today and I felt really bad because I totally forgot about it until this evening, oh well, I guess when you're 57, it really isn't too much of a let down when people begin to overlook your birthday... But my mom and sister made really yummy carrot cake and I ate some butter pecan icecream in honor of Cheryl (even though it's not her birhtday), it tastes so much better knowing that she enjoys it too. Today, when I skipped school to hang out with little kids, I got to be the tour guide for Hupe Lutheran's 6th grade and then I got to be the tour guide for Tori's class, it was way cool!! Then I went back to school for last hour, and just slept through the whole thing. It's OK though, we were just reading and I had already finished Of Mice and Men anyways, which by the way is a totally depressing story and I would not advise reading it if you're in a chipper mood, but if you're feeling poopy it's a good quick read that will make you realize that the whole world really is a dark, bottomlesss abyss!! Well, on that happy note I'll leave you all (which is really no one), thanks for listening, and a good night to you!!

      Well, here I am again. Life is still pretty swell. Especially today because I get to skip school to play water games with a whole bunch of little elementary school kids!! No school, lots of sun, fun, water, and little kids... Well, hopefully there'll be sun, it's been like crazy bad weather the past few days and it looks like it could go either way this morning. I got to talk to my best friend Cheryl last night!! For like an hour!! It was way awesome, it's the first time I've talked to her since she moved on January 22nd. Well, besides letters and e-mails. I was a little hyperactive and we talked about soem interesting things, but I was just excited to hear her voice again. I was way sad that I had to take Kenj back to the church so we had to go, it was getting kind of late in Mississippi too, but, oh well... I got to help with the game last night at Jr. High YQ. I always love helping out, but, whenever I help out at YQ at least, I always end up feeling really stupid and in the way, and like I was WAY more a trouble than help. I think I also may have offended my little sister and I feel really bad about that. She's so testy, I fell like any little thing I say might push her over the edge into another crying fit. I know she's just like becoming a teenager and everything, but I don't think I was that bad, and I know that Carla and Robin weren't that bad, it's a little stressfull. I really excited for summer camp this year, three weeks of it!! It'll be my first time to Old Faithful Christian Ranch as a camper to the actual camp. I've helped out before, and gone to ACT camp up there, but never actually experienced the real camp and I'm way WAY excited. As much as I'm excited for camp, though, it can't even compare to my excitement for the beach!! It's my absolutely, positively, odjucatedly most favorite place in the whole world, and I get to bring my best friend this year!! It's kind of sad because my two older sisters won't be coming this year, and it's the first year that we haven't all gone together since my oldest sister was born. Last year I almost didn't go, but ended up making it for the last half of the week. I'll really miss Carla and Robin there, but, you know, it'll be a new experience... One of my friends really needs prayers. She's drifting away from God and doesn't have many friends because she refuses to be herself. I'm really worried about her. Two of the weeks up at camp I'm most likely going to be spending with her and I just pray that Kenji and I can get through to her and that we'll have the strength to love her for all two weeks and not get to frustrated. I just really hope that this would be a life-changing experience for her, she needs one. Well, that was a whole load of hodge-podged snatches of my life. Everything's going so good right now, that I have to search the future for any problems. I have a feeling those'll work out to, they have a way of doing that... Well, my stomach growls and my ride calls, best be going now, ta-ta!!

      Well, life's pretty swell right now. I'm a little worried about my friend Cheryl, I wish there's something I could do for her, but she's all the way across the country and a hug isn't looking too probable right now. My oldest sister's home from college and it's really great to have her back. She got straight A's this year, which is very impressive!! She's only staying for another week, which is dissapointing, I really love to have her here. School is dragging on and on, we haven't done anything in any of my classes for so long, well, it feels like it. I guess I can't really complaing about having no homework, but thank goodness I get to skip out on the last week of school, I don't think I could hold out that long!! I'm really excited about going to the beach this year because my best friend Kendra gets to come along with my family. But I'm a little worried because she's going to be away from her family, with us, on Father's Day and on the one year anniversary of the day she found out her dad was dead. I just hope my family can be sensitive and not put on some big Father's day shindig for my dad. I mean, I love my dad, but I really want Kenj to be able to have a good time. Yikes, I better run, time for school...joy...
