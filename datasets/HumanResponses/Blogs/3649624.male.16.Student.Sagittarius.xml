      Damn I'm tired...I woke up early as shit today: 12 o'clock.  I know there are a few of you tittering at that, and I thank you.  It's really not as easy as it looks to be funny.  I mean it.  Was that a sentence fragment?    Anyways.  I've decided to buy some fish.  I'm thinking guppies...but I may go exotic.  I'm dreading tomorrow because my dad informed me that I have to cut the grass.  I really don't want to say anything seeing as to how I've cost them over 14 thousand dollars in the past 5 weeks.  I figure that cutting the grass is the LEAST and is the very MOST I will do to make it up to them (yeah right).  How much money have you guys cost your parents?  I bet I beat you!  I really need to stop joking about this...it's starting to sound like I don't care, and I really really do.  I feel like shit.  I barely ate anything yesterday.  I had a footlong sub from Subway and some watermelon.  That watermelon was awesome.  I'm really ready for school to start back because I found out that if I don't have anything to occupy myself, I tend to bring on a lot of trouble.

      I hate driving.  Yesterday I was in an accident which ruined my insurance.  I had already been in an accident where I filpped my car on a curve and toatled my 01 Civic, now I just totalted some poor girls Nissan.  Fuck!  I've decided to not drive for a while and get my shit straight, take a class.  I'm also pissed off because now I can't go see Dashboard Confessional in Duluth, GA on the 19th.  Oh well, we all know that God works in mysterious and often weird ways.  Maybe I'll learn something valueable in my class....or a girl...that would be nice.  A girl that can't drive like me.  The girl I hit was kinda hot...so I was trying to like "comfort" her...haha.  Oh yeah, another shitty detail was that she was the police's daughter...there should be a law against that.  Yes...Law enforcement personel's kids should not be allowed to drive.  Oh who am I kidding...I just fucked up....again.  I'll take it like a man and get another job.  Wreck + Wreck = More Jobs!
