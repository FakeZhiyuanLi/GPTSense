      Dear Lei;
     I can not wait untill the day that I hold you in my arms and get to look in to those eyes of yours. To kiss you on your lips. Trace your face with my hands.  To trace the curves of your body. Hold your hand in mine. To have you rest your head on my shoulder, or to lay you head on my chest as we watch a movie or try to go to sleep. To comfort you when you need it. These are the things a dream of when I think of you. Your dreams are your own. I want to be part of them. I can not make all your dreams come true. I will do my best. Neither of us are perfect. We are after all only human. To err is human, to really screw up you need a computer. lol ;-) I am here for you now, and I will be here for you whenever you need me. I know we are a half a world apart. The distance will disappear with time. I will see to that. One day we will meet. On that day, you truly will be mine. Untill then my Love. I Love You with all my Heart.


I Love You
Love Kevin

      Dear Lei;
     You are like a rose. Very pretty and very fragile. With the proper nurturing, you will bloom and grow. With out love and tenderness, you will wither and fade away. You are to good a person to let that happen to. I want to be the one that gives you the love, warmth, tenderness and whatever else that you require to be happy and grow. I want to be your sun, and your rain. A rose needs both to survive. I will come for you.


I Love You Lei
Love Kevin

      Dear Lei;
     I Love You. It feels so good to say those words to someone again. It has been a very long time. I am pretty sure that it has been a long times since you heard those words said to you. I know that you are still skeptical. That is fine with me. If you can just try to listen to your heart, things will work out. I feel good again. I think that you are starting to feel good again too. We can not change our past. We can only learn from it. We do not want to forget it, then we are doomed to make the same mistakes again. Our future is all up to us to make it what we want. If you really, really want something then you have to go after it. You can not put half an effort towards getting what we want. If you do not go after something with 110% effort, then you do not really want it. I WANT YOU! I must warn you, when I truly want something, I always get it. I have the patients of a saint when it comes to getting exactly what I want. I can be very tenacious. I can wait for as long as it takes to get what I want. I know what I want. You just have to search your heart and your feelings for what you want. I Promise I will not disappoint you. Well time to fini this one. I hope to see you Sunday morning online. I untill next time my love!

     Love
     Kevin

      Dear Lei;
     I am so excited. I just got done talking to you. You made my whole week. I have been thinking of you ever since the last time that we talked. It brings a smile to my face knowing that I can bring one to your face so far away from me. When I talk to you, it feels as if we are not really half a world away. It really feels like you are here with me. If not in body, then in spirit. I can not wait untill the day you and I get to meet. There are only a few things that I look forward to then meeting you. Those too involve you. The day that you and I get married and the day that I bring you home with me. Those two things are the only things that I look forward to more than meeting you. You have given my life new meaning. These past few days that I have not been able to talk to you, I have felt so alone again. This time it was not a welcome feeling. There has been times, when I have embraced being alone. The joy of it. Not any more. Now being alone is just that, alone. Talking with you I escape the loneliness for a little while. It is a good feeling. Your prescence must still be here, I do not feel as if I am alone, yet. Well I must get some sleep. It is almost 5am here. I am looking forward to talking with you again. I hope that it will be Sunday your time, which is Saturday night here. To talk to you before that would be great. So untill next time.




                                    I Love You ;-)

      Dear Lei.
     I just found an incredible web site. It tells me everything that you and I have to do in order to make our dreams come true. As soon as you get back, I will send you the link so that you can see for yourself. I am gonna print the page so that I have it as a reference. After you read it we can talk. I am missing you very much, be glad when I hear from you.


      I Love You Very Much

      Dear Lei
     It is Saturday night here. The first night that I know you will not be online for some time. I am missing you already. I have my ICQ on, in the hope that maybe I will see you. ;-) Remember you said things were moving fast? Well there is two ways that you can look at my time line. The first way is to look at how long I have known you. Granted not very long. So in that aspect you could say things are moving quickly. The other way you could look at it is this way. I have been online for 4 years as a single male. I have talked to a lot of females in that time. It has been a long time since I have had these kinds of feelings for anyone. If you look at it that way, you could say that this has not happened to me very quickly. I do not want to rush you in to anything. All I am asking for is a chance? Let us see how things play out. Maybe just maybe things will go the way, I think that you and I would like them to go. It will take time and patients on our part. It will take a little money on my part. If you have the time and patients, I will come up with the money. Well i am gonna go for tonght. Hoping that you are having fun and that you are safe.

     Je t'aime

      Dear Lei.
     I hope that I was not to forward today? Something about you has felt right from day one. Talking to you, is like looking in the mirror. I see a lot of myself in you. Not that you and I are completely alike, however there is striking similarities. Love is a precious feeling. Some people never know love. Others find it around every corner.  Pisces and Leo are both are dreamers at heart. When they care for one another, they are each able to fulfill the other's needs and have a loving, mutually beneficial relationship. Leo can help Pisces bring fantasies into reality. And remember, Someone out there loves you. Me
     Love

      Dear Lei
     President Roosevelt once said "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." I would like to add that if we shut off our hearts so as not to get hurt, we can also never feel Amour again. I am not perfect. I make mistakes, the only thing that I can say is I Love You. I hope that I get the chance to show you how much. I would also like to make a few of your dreams come true. There is nothing wrong with dreaming. For if we do not dare to dream, then what do we have to look forward to? Dreaming in not a bad word. It is up to each of us to make our dreams come true. Whatever they may be. 

                        Love

      Cher Lei,
      il y a une question que je voudrais vous poserais ? Après
notre conversation précédente, je me demandais si ceci signifie que
vous et moi êtes maintenant petit ami et petite amie ? Juste une
pensée. Laissez-juste moi savent, je ne voudrait pas brancher à la
conclusion fausse.

      Dear Lei,
    I was thinking a lot about you today. When I got off the computer with you yesterday morning, I do not think that I could have been any happier. Your words to me where like a rainbow after a rainstorm. I really felt alive after our conversation. I am so looking forward to our next conversation.


             Je t'aime

      Dear Lei,
      We have not know each other a very long time. Even though you and I live half a world away we managed to find each other. Some people will call it chance others will call it fate. Whatever it is, I hope that one day you and I will get a chance to meet in person. Since I have been talking with you, you have given me a new hope. By the way Hope is not a bad thing. You are one of the few people on this earth that I can call a friend. I have told you things about me, that others would have judged me badly. You did not. 

                          Je t'aime

      Dear Lei;
I was on all last night looking for you. I hope that you are well and ok. I am a little worried about you. I hoe that for some reason you just could not get online yesterday. I will miss you until I hear from you, either on here or by snail mail. I will be looking in the mail for a letter from you saying that you can not get online. If I get a letter from you, I will write you back as soon as possible. I miss you and I Love You Very Much. There is someone out there that cares about you and wants to be with you. That person is me. In this great big world, I have found Love again and her name is Eleanor, also known as Lei. To you Lei, I pledge my love until I no longer breath. Nothing can change the way I feel about you. No one can change what a feel for you. You are what I want. I always get what I want. I can wait for as long as it takes. It might seem like a lifetime until we are together, but when we finally are together, we will have forever. Until we talk again my Love. I am missing you. However you are in a place that no one can take you away from me, and that is in my heart.

Je t'aime Eleanor
Amour Kevin

      Dear Eleanor;
It is Saturday night and I just got in from work. I am hoping to see you online a little later. Things have been going pretty good this week. It was especially good since I got your card and photographs. Now, I just want you! That will be my happiest day. I want to marry you so bad. I just hope that I can make you happy? I am not worried if you can make me happy. That is a very easy thing to do. At least I think it is? There in not much that I require to make me happy. When I am with someone, that is the only person that interest me. Even though you and I are not physically together, you are the only one that I want. You do not have to worry about any other female taking me away from you. I will not let that happen, I Promise You That! You are stuck with me, unless you change your mind. I hope that I do not do anything to cause that to happen? I hope that it is nice there in Spain for you. I looked up the weather there. It said it was going to hot during the day and cool at night. Has it been that way? I hope it has for you. It must be a nice change. I would love it if it was like that here right now. I am going to go for now. I will be looking for you to come online. I hope that you do. Remember I Love You Sweetheart.

Je t'aime Eleanor
Love Always Kevin

      Dear Lei
I got your card and photographs today. I was so happy and excited. What you said in your card really touched me. You are so sexy to me. I can not believe that I found you. It is like a dream come true. We will work on making the rest of our dreams come true. I showed your card and pictures to Bob, a co-worker. He said that you were very pretty and that I was very lucky. I can not wait until we get to talk again. As soon as I get your address in Spain, I will send you a card and photograhs. I think it is one of the first cards I have ever gotten from a female friend. ;-) It is very special to me, as you are. I have been doing some price checking on coming over to visit you in Hong Kong. I found me a hotel that is pretty reasonable. It is called the Charterhouse and it is on Wanchai Road. Is that near you? I hope so. I am figuring that is where you and I will meet. It does not matter to me, where I have to go to meet you. I would go to the far side of the moon, if that is what it took to be with you. Nothing can stop me from coming over and seeing you. As long as I can talk with you, even once a week time will pass. I am going to go for now. I want you to know something. Je t'aime beaucoup, Amour Kevin.

      Dear Lei;
I was thinking about you today. That is nothing new, just hoping that your flight went ok. I was doing some searching on HK. I think I found a place to stay, if that is where I visit you. I do not care where on this earth I have to travel to meet you. I will go anywhere I have to. I can not believe how beautiful you are. Seeing you on that web cam the other night, I was mesmerized by your eyes. They are so Awesome. There actually is not a word for what I felt. Only one word actually comes close, LOVE. I really do Love You. I can not put in words how I feel about you, or how I feel when I see you online. I know I have said it before, however I can not wait untill the day comes when you and I get to meet. I think we both will be lost for words. I am gonna go for now. I'll write again soon. I love You very much. Until we talk again. 

I Love You

It was so nice to be able to see you live. Now the only thing left is in person. That will happen one of these days. I promise you. That will be one of the happiest days in my life. It can not happen soon enough for me. I know that you can not wait for it to happen also. You do not know how much being with you means to me. I want that more than anything I can think of. I hope that you flight goes with out any problems. I will worry a little bit about you until I here from you. I hope that the Internet Cafe will be close to you. I will be on at 12 my time. I just thought of something. You will now be only 6 hours ahead of me not 12. So you wil now be on at around 7am my time. I guess I am going to have to adjust my sleeping habits for this new time zone. I am hoping that I will catch you to let you know. I am going to go for now. I will talk at you again soon I hope.

     I am looking at you on the web cam and I can not believe how pretty you are. Your eyes are incredible. I can not believe it. I could not have found a prettier woman anywhere and I found you. You are everything and anything I could ask for. I know that when I do see you in person. Melt is not the right word for what I will do. Those eyes are perfect. I love them and you. I will do whatever it takes to make you my wife. That is a promise. One that I intend to keep. Ok? Good. Well I am going back to talk to you. I Love You Eleanor. I really do.

     It was so nice to hear your voice on the phone tonight. I enjoyed talking to you. Your voice is as pretty as you are. I say on here what comes to my mind. It is from the heart, not what I think you want to hear. That would be like lying to you, if it was not truly what I felt for you. I am glad to hear that things are going well for you. As soon as you get to Madrid, you send me a letter knowing me know where to write to you. I will send you a letter as soon as I have your address over there. I will send you a little bit of everything. I have a few surprises for you. I can not wait until I can send them to you. I would love to be there when you opened it up. Unfortunately I can not. One day we will meet and I will get to look in to those eyes and hold you in my arms. It is Sunday here now. I am waiting for you to come on so that I can talk to you. You said that you had a few things to do. I see your one ICQ # is showing that you are online. However the person has not answered me back, so I can only assume that it is not you online. I hope that I will get to talk to you soon. I am trying to wait patiently. I Love You Lei. Until I talk to you

    How is it going this week? I hope the job is going well for you. I also hope that you and I will be able to talk when you go to Spain. It is getting closer to the time when I get to talk to you. I can not wait. It has been such a long week. I cut my finger at work Sunday night. It bleed pretty good. Good thing it was close to quitting time when I did it. It is healing up well, so do not worry. It will probably be better by the time you read this. I did a lot of cleaning this week. I cleaned the bathroom real good. I also cleaned the livingroom and kitchen some. I still have a lot to do around here. I am getting to it slowly but surely. One of these days maybe I will get to see you on a web cam. I can only hope. I have been thinking about you a lot this past week again. ;-) Well I am gonna go for now. Untill next time my love.

If everything goes ok, in less than 24 hours I will be talking to you on here. It seams like an eternity since you and I have spoken. The anticipation of talking to you again is very high. It has been a very long week. I hope that your week has been going better. I will be on both ICQ and Yahoo looking for you. I just remembered something, did you do the test? ;-) I hope that you did, so that we can put you mind at rest. My son is going to be here tomorrow night. Then you will be able to see him and talk to him for a few minutes. I have not gotten you package together yet. I am sorry. I am still working on getting a few items ready to send to you. As soon as I get everything ready, I promise I will send it out to you. I guess I will let you go for now. I will be online on Sunday no later than noon your time. Wait for me :-) I will be looking for you as soon as I get in. Untill next time my Love.

      Dear Lei;
I have been thinking about you a lot lately. A week seems like a month when I am waiting to talk to you. It is now Friday evening. I did not go to work today, because of a very bad sinus headache. The weather has been very bad on my sinuses lately. It has been very hot and humid, running about 34' during the day. The other night it was 28' at 1am. My imagination has been thinking alot about you this week also. I am not going to put the details on here. If you want to know, you can ask me when we talk next. ;-) I think I am going to leave you wondering with that last thought. Going to close for now. I will hopefully talk to you tomorrow night. Take care. I Love you Lei very much.

     It is Monday night here. It has been almost 48 since we have talked. I miss talking to you so much. There are so many things that I can not wait to find out about you. ;-) Things I dare not say here. It was a different you talking the other night. This Wednesday night and Thursday night I am gonna work on your audio cd for you. I am hoping to get everything ready by this weekend and get it out the 1st of the week, right after we talk is when I should be sending it out. I hope that the weather is doing ok? It was miserable at work on Sunday. Our A/C broke. I hope that I see you again this Saturday night. Talk at you later.

   I so enjoyed talking to you yesterday. The hours just flew on by. I can not believe that we talked that long? You were something else. It is hard to believe some of the stuff that you came out with. Did you do the test? How did it come out? I am very curious to know the answer. I hope that you had as much fun as I did. I was glad that you got to see me. Now you know why I asked you before if you had Yahoo Messenger. My web cam works with it. Soon you will get to hear me. I promise. I will work on your cd. I am gonna hopefully send it out by the next time that we talk. I am gonna enclose a few little items for you along with the cd's. I am not gonna tell you what I am sending you. ;-) I hope that you like what I send you. 
     You really surprised me yesterday day, when you said that " You are falling in Love with your fiance." I hope that you saw the smile on my face. It was great to hear those words come from you. I can not wait until you get your own computer, so that you and I will be able to talk more often. A week is a very long time. It will be so nice when I get to see you again, and you see me. Well ttfn, Ta Ta For Now.

      Dear Lei;
     I am having problems sleeping. I am afraid of missing you online. I know that this is silly. Since you already told me that you will probably only be on Sundays. I do not want to miss you. I already miss talking to you. If I signed on and had discovered you had been on and I missed talking to you. I would be very sad. :-( Unless I am very busy, I am thinking of you. I told a Florida Highway Patrol Lieutenant about you tonight. What I am hoping. He asked if you and I have ever met? He also asked a few other questions. He wished me well. I wish I could be with you both sooner and more often. I can not help but wonder? So many dreams, fantasies, wishes, whatever you want to call them. I have them all about you. ;-) The mysteries undiscovered, the joys unknown. I can only wonder? They all bring a smile to my face. How about you? I will talk to you soon, I hope.

      Dear Lei;
     We were very busy today at work. The time just flew by. Now that I am home and on my IBook, I can look at your picture again and think about you. How wonderful you are. The joy that talking to you brings to me. All the joys that we talk about. All the ones that are left unsaid for one reason or another. The secret thoughts that I dream about you. Finding you was like getting the lucky numbers in a large lottery. Except, the odds had to have been far greater. I figure the odds to be about 4 billion to 1. After all there is only one of you on this whole planet. I do not know if it should be called fate, luck, destiny or what. I just know the way that I feel when I see you come online and I get to talk to you. I Love You. If it is not Love, then I must be crazy. Well I am gonna go. I hope to talk to you soon.

It is like when the sun breaks through the clouds when it has been raining non stop. I enjoy knowing that us talking brings a smile to your face. It brings one to mine also. Well it is getting late. I have to be at work in the morning for a meeting. I will write again soon.

     It is Tueday morning here. I do not know when I will get to talk to you online again. I am hoping that it will be on Sunday your time. I created to music Cd's for you. After I get your address in HK, I will send you a little package. Nothing special just a few items. I hope that your trip went well. Things are going ok here. I did a bunch of cleaning. On Monday I cleaned the Livingroom and took out my old couch. A friend of mine gave me one and another friend of mine brought it over for me. I found out that my vacuum is broken :-( I can not believe that things are going the way they are with you and I. It really is like a dream come true. I am looking forward to next year when you and I will finally get together. I am really hoping that I end up meeting you in the Philippines and that you and I get married. Well I am gonna go for now. I hope to hear from you on Sunday. So untill next time

      Dear Lei;
    Things are going ok. I can not wait until you and I can talk again. It is getting closer and I am getting more anxious. I have not been putting much on here while you have been in Spain. I did not want you to have a lot to read when you got back. I do think about you all the time. In a few days it will be September. It is getting closer to the time when you and I will finally meet. I hope all is going well for you over in Spain. I got my new digital camera to function as a web cam. You might be able to see me better when I use it. I am going to go for now. I will write you again soon. 
Je'taime Lei
Love Kevin

      Dear Lei;
I received your e-mail on Monday. Sorry to hear what happened. I am glad that you and the baby are ok. I miss you so much. I can not wait until you get back to Hong Kong and you and I can talk again. It seems like such a long time since we have talked. It has been very hot and raining a lot here. As soon as I know that you are back in Hong Kong I will send you a few things. I have your music cd's ready for you. I have to get a few other things for you. They will be a surprise. I have had a chest for about a week now. I wish it would go play somewhere else. Otherwise things are about the same as always with me. If it was not for bad luck, I would not have any at all. Well I am going to go for now. I will talk at you later. I Love You Very Much

      Dear Lei;
     It is Saturday night again. I got your e-mail last week. I will not be staying up all night tonight looking for you to sign on. :-( I am looking forward to the middle of September when I will get to talk to you next. It seems like an eternity since we have talked. I miss being able to talk to you atleast once a week. It was very nice when you and I could talk daily. We just have to be patient. Our time will come. I am not feeling well tonight. I got me a cold the other day. It is taking its toll on me today. I am hoping that I will be over it in a day or two. I have not been writing on here much. I know that you will have enough to read when you get back online as it is. I think about you all the time. I can not wait until you get back to Hong Kong and I can send you a few things. I have the music cd's all ready for you. I have yet to make the one of me for you. I will get it done before you get back online. Things are going ok I guess. My car is broke again. One of these days I will get it right again. Just not meant to drive it I guess. Not that I have the money right now. Things are tight. I will get myself straightened out. I always do. Well I am going to get something to eat. I will write you some more in a few days. I hope that you are doing ok? I miss you very much my love. I Love You, and don't you forget it.

Love Always...... Kevin

      Dear Lei;
It is Monday 4th August 2003, it has been two weeks since we have talked. I stayed up until the sun came up Sunday morning hoping to see you online. I did not. I miss you very much my love. On Thursday it will be my birthday. I will not be doing anything to celebrate it. No sense in it. The only thing that I would wish for is for you and I to be together. Last week and this week I have done a lot of cleaning. I almost have my back bedroom clean. I moved my sons desktop in there. He starts school on my birthday. He will be starting 3rd grade. Everyone here keeps asking me if I have talked to you. You are on my mind all the time. I am hoping that you send me a letter soon. If or when you do, I will write back to you. Things are going ok here, I just wish you and I could talk again. I was really glad that I could see you on a web cam the last time we talked. I Love You and Miss You Very Much. I still have your picture on both my computers desktops. ;-) If I can not talk to you, at least I can still see you and you are still very much in my heart. Well until we talk again my love.
Je t'amie Lei

      Dear Lei
I just tried to call you on the phone. Not much luck though, I was trying to tell you that I took some pictures for you today. Johnithann and I did a bunch of them for you. We also took some of the cats for you. Tomorrow I will get them drop them off to be developed before I talk to you on the computer. I will have them back in a day or two and then I will send them to you. Sorry it is taking me so long to get them to you. Things just never go the way I want them to around here. It seems like something is always coming up unexpectedly. However I will have them in the mail to you by Friday. Then you will have some of my son and I. Well I am gonna go for now. I will probably write you some more tonight. 
I Love You Lei

      Dear Lei
Hello Sexy, I Really Do Love You. I was wondering, how did you sleep last Sunday night after we got done talking on Yahoo? Did you have fun watching both camera's? I can not wait until the day you and I meet. It will be a dream come true! The rest of my time with you, will be my fantasies coming true. ;-) As the old Elvis Presley song goes " I want you, I need and I Love You with all my heart." One of these days, I will get to bring you here as my wife. That day can not come soon enough. I tried calling you on your mobile on Sunday. I kept getting a busy signal. I was just calling to say that I Love You. Nothing special. @~> There is a rose for my pretty little lady. It is so nice to have someone to care about again. I just hope that I do not do anything to chase you away. Nothing about you, could not want me to be with you. I have looked a lifetime to find that someone special. I have also searched the world for her. Never finding her. Until the day I found you. I knew from the 1st time that we talked that there was something special about you. As you know, it did not take me long to fall in love with you. I never really thought that you would actually fall in love with me. I was hoping, but not really believing. Then when you told me, that when you thought of me, you found yourself smiling, I had hope. Then you started missing me when you and I could not talk. My prayers were answered. Well my dear, it is getting late. It is already after 3-am. I am going to head to bed. I have one more day of work. Until we talk again my Love, Je'taime.
I Love You Lei
Love Always Kevin

      Dear Lei
This week I have been doing a lot of thinking. All of it is positive, so do not worry. I still love you and want to be with you. Even more so now. You have no idea what kind of effect you have had on me. I want to bring joy and happiness to your life. God I Love You so Much.  I can not wait until we talk on here again. At that time I can tell you all the things I want to, no need to. I hope that you will accept my generosity I think it will make things a lot easier. Pleaz do not be mad at me when I talk to you. You are my inspiration, and everything I do I do for you. My goal is to bring us together for ever and for always. I am gonna go for now sweetheart. I Love you very much. I will talk to you soon.

      Dear Lei;
I love and admire you so much. You'll never know what I feel for you until we meet face to face. I am kinda sentimental. I will probably cry when we meet for the first time. I look forward to that day. That will be one of the happiest days of my life. The happiest will be when I bring you over here as my wife. I found out some information that is really getting me thinking. When we talk, I will let you know. If I can do it, it will be a very big surprise for you. This one I can not promise. However I am going to try my best. You mean so much to me since I was lucky enough to find you. I Love You Lei. It was nice to talk to you a few minutes on the phone last night. It would have been nice if we could have been able to hear each other a little better, but it is better than not talking at all. I am going to go. I will talk to you again very soon. I Love You Lei;
I Love You Very Much

      Dear Lei;
I had a wonderful weekend and it was all because of you. Not only did I get to talk to you online, but I actually got to talk to you twice. It was so nice to be able to see and talk to you again. I Love You. I never thought that I would feel this way again. Finding you was and is a blessing. I do not know whether to call it fate or destiny, but whatever it is, I Like It and Love You. Some days time feels like it is moving so slow, then other days it just flies by. Soon you and I will get our chance to be together. That will be like our own private slice of heaven here on earth. I just opened the letter you sent me from Madrid before you left. I understand your doubts. I to wonder, either what is wrong with this picture, or what can go wrong with this picture. We are all only human. We all have our individual fears. I will be glad when I can put yours to rest. I Love You. I will be talking to you again in a few days. Until then.

How are you doing? I was looking for you on the 7th. I did not think that you would be online. I was hoping to see you. It has been so long since you and I have talked. I am looking forward to seeing you online this weekend. Next week I am going to try and send you a package. I was going to send it to you this week. I just wanted to make sure that I have the right address. Well I am going to go. I have to get this little guy on his homework and then ready for bed. I Love You Lei. Until we talk again.

      Dear Lei;
It is now Saturday the 6th of September. I got your e-mail the beginning of the week. I hope that I see you online tomorrow night. I have a feeling that I will not get to talk to you until next week. I hope that I am wrong. It seams like it has been forever since we have been abel to chat. Things could be better, but no sense in crying over things. I have been not writing to much here since you have been gone. That way you do not have to much to read. It is not because I have not thought about you. I think about you all the time. I still have your pictures on my computer screens. I look at you every day. I got an e-mail from my brother on Thursday. I want to share what it said. It is called Stop and Smell The Roses It read:

Too many people put off something that brings them joy just because they haven't thought about it, don't have it on their schedule, didn't know it was coming or are too rigid to depart from their routine.
I got to thinking one day about all those women on the Titanic who passed up dessert at dinner that fateful night in an effort to cut back.
From then on, I've tried to be a little more flexible. How many women out there will eat at home because their husband didn't
suggest going out to dinner until after something had been thawed? Does the word "refrigeration" mean nothing to you?
How often have your kids dropped in to talk and sat in silence while you watched 'Jeopardy' on television?
I cannot count the times I called my sister and said, "How about going to lunch in a half hour?" She would gasp and stammer, "I can't. I have clothes on the line. My hair is dirty. I wish I had known yesterday, I had a late breakfast, It looks like rain." And my personal favorite: "It's Monday." She died a few years ago. We never did have lunch together.
Because Americans cram so much into their lives, we tend to schedule our headaches. We live on a sparse diet of promises we make to ourselves when all the conditions are perfect
We'll go back and visit the grandparents when we get Stevie toilet-trained. We'll entertain when we replace the living-room carpet.
We'll go on a second honeymoon when we get two more kids out of college
Life has a way of accelerating as we get older. The days get shorter, and the list of promises to ourselves gets longer. One morning, we awaken, and all we have to show for our lives is a litany of "I'm going to," "I plan on," and "Someday, when things are settled down a bit."
When anyone calls my 'seize the moment' friend, she is open to adventure and available for trips. She keeps an open mind on new ideas. Her enthusiasm for life is contagious. You talk with her for five minutes, and you're ready to trade your bad feet for a pair of Roller blades and skip an elevator for a bungee cord.
My lips have not touched ice cream in 10 years. I love ice cream. It's just that I might as well apply it directly to my stomach with a spatula and eliminate the digestive process. The other day, I stopped the car and bought a triple-decker. If my car had hit an iceberg on the way home, I would have died happy.
Now...go on and have a nice day. Do something you WANT to......not something on your SHOULD DO list.
If you were going to die soon and had only one phone call you could make, who would you call and what would you say? And why are you waiting?
Make sure you read this to the end; you will understand why I sent this to you. 
Have you ever watched kids playing on a merry go round or listened to the rain lapping on the ground? Ever followed a butterfly's erratic flight or gazed at the sun into the fading night?
Do you run through each day on the fly? When you ask "How are you?" Do you hear the reply?
When the day is done, do you lie in your bed with the next hundred chores running through your head?
Ever told your child, "We'll do it tomorrow." And in your haste, not see his sorrow?
Ever lost touch? Let a good friendship die? Just call to say "Hi"?
When you worry and hurry through your day, It is like an unopened gift....Thrown away... Life is not a race. Take it slower. Hear the music before the song is over

It makes you stop and think, don't it? When I read it, I made up my mind. If I have to sell everything I own to come and see you next year I will. You are a once in a life time thing? event? Not the right words, I know. However it is how I feel. I will not miss it, (You) for nothing. I do not want to wonder what might have been. I have to know. To me there can only be one answer. One final out come. That is for you to be my wife. I Love You Lei. I have known it from the very beginning. I can not explain it. Well I guess I should let you go for now. I think you have enough to read and think about. 
I Love You Lei
Forever and For Allways
Love Kevin

      Dear Lei; 
This is just another quick note for you. You have quite a bit to read this week. Check out todays horoscope for me
Leo
Now that you know what you want, you're one step closer to getting it. You've been on the fence about this issue for a long time. Now that the final decision has been made, you're free to move forward. Everyone might not agree with the path you have chosen, but once they see how determined you are, they'll be more than happy to get out of your way. You have a very strong sense of purpose and this time there's no doubt that you're going to finish what you started.

      Dear Lei;
Just a quick note. Check out todays horoscope for me.
Leo
If people had to describe you using one word, it would be 'vital.' You're full of life and energy and there isn't anything that you won't at least attempt. Helping people and having a good time are first and foremost on your mind and if you can find a way to combine the two, then it's all the better! Including everyone in the fun is part of your goal, but if the guest list gets out of hand, you're not worried. There's always room to expand and if you begin to run out of space, you shouldn't have any trouble finding a more accommodating venue.

      Dear Lei;
Let me start by saying " I Love You Very Much!!" I have not felt like this in a long time. Finding you has brought new meaning to my life. I wish that I had the money to make our dreams come true quicker than what it is actually going to take. However anything worth while is worth waiting for. You my love are worth waiting for. ;-) Soon you and I will be together. I know that it will only be for a short time at first, however one day it will be forever! That is when our dreams will finally be realized. I will not give up on you. As far as I am concerned you are my partner, NOW! When you and I are finally married, that will just be the legal aspect of our marriage. That is when the rest of the world will recognize that you and I are married. For me, I am married to you already. There is nothing that I will not do for you. I will not fail when it comes to making our dreams come true. I Love You My Dear. I Love You with all That is Me! There is no other for me, just you. It took me almost 39 years to find my one true love. I will not lose you for anything other than dying. Nothing else will keep me from you. Well I am going to for now. Take care my Love. For without you, I am nothing but an empty shell of a person. 

I Love You Lei
I will Forever Love You
Love Kevin

      Dear Lei;
You and I just got off the phone a little while ago. It was so nice talking to you for so long. It did not seam like you and I were on the phone for over an hour and a half, but we were. I know that having the feelings for me that you do, are a little new for you. I also know that I have to earn some of your trust. We all bring mixed feelings in to a relationship.  I know that you do not want to get hurt again. I do not want to hurt you either. Since you and I have fallen in love and want to be married, there is no longer your problems or my problems, they are now Are Problems. I can not either force or make you take my help. I can only offer it to you and hope that you accept it. If we work together, and we are both working towards a common goal, then we have a better chance of accomplishing our goals. I Love You Lei. I just want for you and I to be as husband and wife. As I told you before, I neither care how long it take, nor do I care how much it cost. I want you! I want you every way that a man can want a woman. I want you as a friend, (which you already are to me) I want you as a lover, ;-) and last but not least, I want you as my wife. Question? If you and I were living together as husband and wife and I needed your help in accomplishing a task, would you help me? Then please let me help you. It will not be much, but it will all add up. One day we will have enough for our dreams to come true. None of us know how much time we have here on this planet. We like to think that we will all grow old before we have to leave. The truth is, we do not know. We might have a day, a week, a month, a year, a decade or maybe longer. What ever time I have left here, I want to spend as much of it with you as I can. I have finally found my one true love, You Lei are that one special person for me. I Love You and will either do or spend what ever it takes to prove that to you. Well I am going to go for now. Just remember that there is someone out there that loves you and cares for you. Me.
I Love You Lei

I just got off of the phone with you. It will be another week before I get to see you online. :-( I miss you this week. I know that your appointment was very important. I am glad to hear that it went well. I can not wait until I get to talk to you on the phone tomorrow about it. Tonight it feels as if something is missing, and something is, You My Love! I have quite a few things to talk to you about. I am a little bit nervous about it. I will be glad after I talk to you. My son went camping this weekend, so I am all alone. I Love You Lei. Hopefully next week I will get to see you. I just hope it goes by quickly. When I get to see you on the computer, it is like being there with you. It is the best I can hope for now. You are my shining light at the end of my work week. My shining star in the heavens. My guiding light. Well I am gonna go for now my love. Until I see you online again, remember one thing.
I Love You Very Much

      Dear Lei;
Tonight at work I got a fortune cookie from the back. It seems like we always have them. We are always getting something from the Chinese Restaurant. The little fortune in the cookie said "Depart not from the path which fate has assigned you." Kinda prophetic huh? Think it pertains to us? I like to think so. I am very optimistic when it comes to you and I. I never thought that I would find someone out there for me. Finding you probed me wrong. I am looking forward to coming over and spending as much time with you as I can in Hong Kong. I could spend six months with you and it would not be enough. I will only get enough of you when we spend the rest of our lives together. I am going to go so I can get something to eat. I can not wait until I get to talk to you on Sunday. I Love You Lei!

I did a lot of cleaning today. My bathroom is now spotless. I have been negligent in my cleaning the past few weeks. Time to play catch up. I am a little bit nervous. I am making a list of things to talk over with you. I do not want any secrets with you. The person that you have to come know and love is only half of who I am. I think it is safe to say we all have several sides to our personality. I just hope that the things I have to tell you, do not scare you away. I like to think that they are harmless and just part of my creative side. Well I am going to go for now. I will talk at you again soon. I Love You Lei.

It was so nice to talk to yo on the phone tonight. I enjoyed it so much. I wish that you and I could be together sooner and more often. I do know that one day our dreams will come true. After that you and I will have the rest of our live together. Nothing will be able to keep us apart. We will be as equals. It will be my pleasure to spoil, pamper and please you the best that I can. I will warn you, I am not an easy person to be with. I am a very creative person. I am me, I like what I like. I enjoy looking at my partner, touching them and doing things for them. It is not easy to be my partner. My partner is everything to me. She is my best friend, my confidant, my Lover and my world. I want you to know all about me. I want you to know Me! I want you to know what it means to be my partner. I do not want either you or me to make any mistakes. I want you to know ahead of time, what you are getting in to. You mean a lot to me. I Love You So Much. I never thought that I would have these feelings again for anyone. If after you and I talk about the things that I want tell you, you no longer wish for us to be together, I will understand. I will not have any hard feelings towards you. I LOVE YOU! I need to get these things off of my chest. Then you will have to decide, if I am truly the right person for you? I hope that the answer will still be Yes. I am not going to go in to those things here, for anyone to read. I will tell them to you during our next conversation. I only hope that you still think that we are right for each other? I know that you have many questions racing through your head right now. You are wondering what I have to tell you. Some I have told you in the past. Well I am gonna go, so that you and I can talk in chat. I Love You My Dearest Lei. I hope that your feelings for me do not change after we talk.

      Dear Lei;
I was so glad to hear your voice on my phone a little while ago. I waited to see if you called back. :-( You did not. I do not know if it was your phone or my phone. My happy thought is that I know you will call me back again. I really enjoy talking to you, either on the computer with the web cams or on the phone. When I hear your voice, I know that you are smiling and it brings a big smile to my face as well. I am so looking forward to us meeting and being together. Thank you for the shirts that you sent my son and I from Hong Kong. They are very nice and the gift is very appreciated. I am glad to hear that you got your pictures and cd's. From time to time I will try to send little things your way. Even if all it is a card to say that I Love You! You have no idea how much joy you have brought to my life. You have made the internet boring. The only time I really enjoy it is when I get to talk to you. No one is ever on any of my chat list, except you. I so wish that you and I had more time to talk. It would be so nice. I want to bring joy and happiness to your life. I also want to make all of your dreams come true, and a few of my fantasies.... lol.. I am sure that being with me will be all new and completely new to you. I will do everything in my power to make you comfortable. I do not want you to feel bad about anything. Anything between us is for Love and fun, nothing else. Well I guess I am gonna go for now my Love. I Love You Very Much. I can not wait until we talk again. So au revoir for now. I Love You, for all that you are and for all that you are to me.  See you soon I hope.

I got your pictures in the mail to you. I also sent your audio cd's and a short note. I am sorry it took me so long to get them to you. I did get them out to yo finally. I hope that they are ok? I am not as photogenic as you are. I am sorry that I made you cry last weekend. I know they were tears of joy, but still. It was good to talk to you all last week. I really enjoyed it. I wish my phone worked better, but it does let me hear your voice and say I Love You. I hope that you can get away from your friends this Sunday. You and I do not have enough time to talk each week as it is. Well I am gonna go for now. I Love You and hope to hear from you soon. 
I Love You Lei

      Dear Lei;
You must have forgotten what I told you awhile back. We sometimes order dinner from a Chinese Restaurant. On the menu it has the different signs. That is where I learned I am a Dragon, and this is what it said for me. " You are eccentric and your life complex. You have a very passionate nature and abundant health. Marry a Monkey or Rat late in life. Avoid the dog."  And yours says " You are ambitious yet honest. Prone to spend freely, seldom make lasting friendship. Most compatible with Dragon & Monkeys, least compatible with the Horse." So you see, according to that you and I are meant to be. Then there was the horoscope match

Leo and Pisces 


When Leo and Pisces come together, each partner will enjoy the new dimension which the other brings to life in general. Leo is a strong and outgoing Sign, doing what they want and taking command of the surrounding world.  Pisces is quieter and more introspective. In many ways the two are contrasts, yet both are dreamers at heart.  When they care for one another, they are each able to fulfill the other's needs and have a loving, mutually beneficial relationship. 

Leo is a leader and in a relationship with Pisces  often becomes the protector of their more gentle partner. Pisces, in turn, gives Leo the audience they require for their ambitions and social performances. Pisces is a Sign that, like Water, fills whatever container it is poured into. They tend to give themselves over to  a partner; an empathetic nature enables The Fish to understand Leo in a way that many other Signs don't. Leo's direct approach combines with Pisces' gentle understanding of other people to form a confidence and assertiveness that doesn't pass into selfishness -- the way Leo alone might act -- and isn't overly timid, like Pisces alone may be. 

Leo is ruled by The Sun and Pisces is ruled by the Planet Jupiter. Pisces is also ruled by Neptune. The Sun emanates life and a focus on the Self to the Leo-Pisces relationship. Neptune is about big pictures, ideas, and illusions; but it's also involved with disillusion and fantasy. Leo can help Pisces bring fantasies into reality. Neptune works through Pisces by putting a softer face on Leo's sometimes self-centered and brash actions, channeling their energy into a more creative and fruitful outlet. 

Leo is a Fire Sign and Pisces is a Water Sign. These two can get a lot done if they work together, using introspection and creative ambition to get things done. Pisces can help Leo learn to be humble and to think of the needs of others, while Leo teaches Pisces to go out into the world and begin to take risks and action. But Pisces can be too emotional, too much Water dampening Leo's enthusiasm. Conversely, too much Fire can boil the Water and leave Pisces emotionally scalded. Leo and Pisces must create open lines of communication in order  to ensure their balance is maintained. 

Leo is a Fixed Sign and Pisces is a Mutable Sign. Pisces doesn't need to be the boss; when they are given a task and a way to help out, they enjoy working as hard as they can to do their part. They get their greatest satisfaction from bettering the universe. Leo, on the other hand, is the one who comes up with ideas in the first place and assigns roles to the other participants. Both enjoy working for the underdog and their lack of conflict over roles helps Leo and Pisces work on the same projects with great results. 

The best aspect of the Leo-Pisces relationship is that they have much to gain from each other and they are both receptive to one another's teachings. Pisces shows Leo how to empathize and care, and Leo teaches Pisces how to make their dreams happen rather than just thinking about them! Their ability to each provide what the other needs makes theirs a truly reciprocal relationship.

So you are mine, and I am yours. As you see it was not our choice to decide, but ours to fulfill. Anyway, I Love You. I am going for now.

      Dear Lei;
I Love You so much. I will keep trying to bring you and I together. I do not look at my offer as being generous. It is only a means to an end. It would make our dream of being together one step closer. I do not want to lose you. None of us know how long we have on this Earth. We like to think that we will be here for a long time, but we just do not know. I want us to be together. It does not matter what I have to do, or what I have to spend to do it. I really do want you and need you. I do not know what to call it that brought you and I together. It is extremely special, especially since you and I are half a world apart. The odds alone of us finding each other is astronomical. My heart belongs to you, and you alone. I never thought that there was someone out there for me. Finding you, proved me wrong. :) I love you Lei.. With each passing day, my feelings grow deeper for you, more than I can put in words, either here, our chats or are occasional phone conversations. As time passes, our time together grows near. I am so looking forward to this time. I hope that I will be everything that you are looking for. All I want is to make you happy. Well I am gonna go now. I am looking forward to talking to you again this weekend. 
I Love You Lei
Love Always Kevin

      Dear Lei;
I was so glad to her from you today. :D I was so worried about you. I guess it is the same fear that you have. Now that I have found the right person, I worry about losing her. I try not to, however when you love and care about someone, it is very hard not to. I love you very much Lei! Words can not describe how much I love you. Well I am gonna go for now. I Love You. I will write again soon.

I Love You very much Lei!

      Dear Lei;
It is 1:27 Saturday morning. In about 22 I will hopefully be talking to you on here. I can not wait to talk to you. It seams like it has been forever since you and I have talked. I need to talk to you so badly. It has not been a good week. I have to much on my mind lately. I need a diversion. Talking to you will be an escape even if it is only for a few hours. Well I am gonna go. It is getting late and I am getting tired tonight.
I Love You Lei

      Dear Lei;
It is New Years Eve here. About 15 minutes till the New Year rolls in. I feel so alone this New Years Eve. It is all because of you. I have finally found someone for myself. When I get to talk to you either on the computer or the phone, it just brings a smile to my face. I feel alive when we are together. Even if it is only by either the phone or the computer. I Love You so much. I enjoyed talking to you on the phone earlier. I think I am gonna have to call you after writing this to you. Thank You for letting me in to your life. I promise to do the best I can by you and your girls. I can not say I will not make mistakes. I can promise I will never cheat on you. I have never done that and I never will. I want you and I to be together so badly. Our time to be together is getting closer. I look forward to that time with great anticipation. It will be one of the happiest days of my life. You have no idea what you mean to me. You are everything to me. You give me a whole new reason to live. I am gonna go for now my Love.
I Love You Lei

      Dear Lei;
Tried calling you a little while ago. It was either busy or you have not gotten your new card yet. I am just sitting here listening to some songs that I am going to burn on cd's for you. I have been staring at your picture all day. One of the computers has been on all day. And of course your picture is on both. I sent you a package today. Nothing special, just your letter and a little something. I hope both are ok? I love the letter that you wrote for me. It gives a lot of insight in to you. Not that I needed any more. I have read it several times now. Reading it brings a smile to my face. Looking at either you on the web cam or just your picture also brings a smile to my face. Anything and everything about you brings a smile to my face. My days are a lot brighter now that you are in them, even if you are a long ways away from me. I have a few comical songs picked out for you this time. Only a few. Most of them are the mushy lovey kind. I guess I am just a sentimental old fool. Knowing you makes me feel like a teenager. You are wonderful. I never thought that there was anyone out there for me, especially some one that is as special as you. You are intelligent, sexy, innocent, desirable, all of those things and so much more. I guess I better go for now. It is after 3-am already. Time goes by to fast when it revolves around you my Love. You are everything to me. I hope that I will get to talk to you again soon. I miss you so much! :( Some day you will be here by my side. Until that day, I just have to be thankful that you are in my life at all, and be grateful for the little bit of time I have you actually in my life. TTFN (Ta Ta For Now)

      Dear Lei;
I hope that you are doing well today? I am going to get the letter in the mail to you today. Then you should have it by next Monday your time. I sure do miss talking to you each Sunday. Do not worry, I am not going anywhere. As I have told you before, I will always wait for you. You are worth it. I know that you have to do, what you have to do on your end. I wish that I was better off financially so that I could help you out. I know that is not what you want from me. I also know that you are used to doing things yourself and are not used to having either somebody to help you or having somebody that actually wants to help you. I know that you would help me, if you were able to, if I needed it. To me there is no your bills or my bills. If it involves either you or me, then it is our bill. We both have luggage from our previous relationships. Neither you nor I should hold it against the other. I am not saying that you are. I Love you dear. Nothing can change that. I do not think there is anything that you could do, that would make me stop loving you. I am a very understanding person. Last night I signed up for school. I actually did it. Well I am gonna go for now. I think I am gonna try giving you a quick call to say I Love You.

      Dear Lei;
It is Sunday morning here now. 4:30 am to be exact. I was hoping to see you online. I guess something came up at one of your jobs. I tried calling you, but I could not get a hold of you. Maybe some day (when you are my wife) I will make enough money that you do not have to work. I do not know about you, but I would love that. I think about you all the time. You are my last thought at night and my first thought when I get up. I Love You so much. I can not wait until I get to come over and visit you. In a few days it will be the 1st day of the new year. It will not be long before I get my first chance to look in to your eyes and hold you in my arms. Anything after that is  a bonus. After meeting you, the next thing that I am looking forward to is the day that you and I get married. Spending the rest of my life with, sounds wonderful. Waking up next to your body sleeping next to mine. Listening to your heart beat, and the sound of you breathing. The smell of your hair and your skin. The softness of your hair and skin. The warmth of your body. All these things I look forward to, day after day and then year after year. I guess I better go my Love. It is getting very late here. I hope to hear from you again soon.

      Dear Lei;
I hope that you are doing well. I want you to see my Horoscope for today:
Today's Leo Horoscope
 July 23 - August 22

Everything was fun for a while, but now it's all turning serious. Your sure thing is missing, or maybe it turns out to be a mostly empty experience. Resources that you thought would be available forever are finally dwindling. The intensity level goes up a few notches when everyone starts playing for keeps. Cash in hand is worth more than ever when you think about spending it. Romantic encounters take on greater meaning when lovers wonder whether they'll see each other again. Don't give a bad omen more power than it deserves. You really do have some control over all this.

Romance

You could be a little too much for your significant other to handle right now. If he or she asks you to back off or calm down, don't take it personally. It's just a mood talking. You even had one of those yourself recently. This too shall pass.
Interesting huh? Things will be looking up for me very soon. As soon as soon as the New Year rolls around things will get better for me. With each and every day, I move closer to coming and seeing you. I am looking forward to meeting you in person and spending my time with you. It will be like a dream come true. The beginning of our dreams. I do not know why I am feeling so optimistic right now. Maybe it is just the holiday season, I do not know. Well I am gonna go for now. I Love You So Much.

      Dear Lei;
My Mac is back. Now I can write to you again. I Love You So Much! Today has been a very busy day. I got up early to do a bunch of house cleaning that I am sorely behind in. I also cable installed for my television. I am getting rid of my satellite. After the guy came out, I started rearranging my living-room. I did that for a few hours, then cooked dinner for my little guy and I. After dinner back to cleaning. Finally about 9:30 I went in and got my shower. It is now 10:45 and my son is already asleep. Tomorrow I am gonna finish cleaning then him and I are going to put up our Christmas tree. Well i think I am gonna go for now. I am gonna give you a quick call to say Hi and I Love You. I hope that I get to see you again on Christmas day on the computer. Take care my love.
I Love You

      Dear Lei;
I am sorry I have not been keeping up with this lately. With my laptop bing down, I am not in the internet much any more. I should have it fixed by the 18th of December. I will keep up on things then. I wish I was rich, then you might take the money you need from me and you would not have to work so hard. You should not have to work 7 days a week. I miss the few hours that you and I used to have each Sunday. Now it is even fewer. I wish I could do more for you. I feel helpless on this end, a quarter of a world away. It would give me great pleasure in helping you. After all helping you also benefits me. I guess I am gonna go for now.

Sorry I have not put anything up here in a while. WIth my laptop down, I have not been on the net much. You have not been on much either. I have missed you so very much. Words can not adequately dexcribe what I feel for you. I never thought I could feel this way about somebody. Especially some one that I have never met in person. You have changed my outlook on life. Given me hope and dreams back again. I did not think that anyone could do so much for me. I Love You So Much. I almost cried when we had to say good bye on the computer. I want us to be together so bad. It is all I really think about. Well I guess I better get to bed. It is getting late. I will hopefully see you online again next week. I Love You Lei.

Do you know what I mean love? Forever and For Always. That is how I like to think of us. It is getting late. I will talk to you again soon. Till we see each other again.

      Dear Lei
Your words last night were indescribable. Our love has grown so fast. I knew that you were the right person for me the moment I saw your pictures. I am glad that you opened your life to mine. Then after opening communications, you did something that was very brave of you. You opened your mind and then your heart. After all that you have been through in your life, I know that was not an easy thing to do. You are so special to me. I know I repeat myself about me feelings for you. The way I fell for you is so hard to actually put in to words. You are unlike any female I have ever met before, even if we have never met in person. You are shy, yet at times bold, inhibited, yet open, very cautious, and still daring. You are smart and witty. You are sexy, yet with the quality of the girl next door. You are not a false person. You are you, as I am me. You and I cannot pretend to be someone else. That is not our way. That is why I have been so open with you. Besides that, time is not on anyone’s side. None of us are getting any younger. You have given me hope again. As I hope I have given hope to you. Well my dear, I am gonna go for now. I will get back to you soon. You see there is not a moment in the day that I do not think of you.

      Dear Lei;
I am so glad to see you online this week. It has been such a long time. I think the day after Christmas to be exact. I might be wrong. I Love You So Much. You are so important to me. I was just talking about you to a coworker tonight. I told him that you are worth the wait. I do not care how long it takes or what it cost to make you my wife. As long as you want me as your husband, I will never give up on you. Time and money does not matter to me. I have always been the one that they give up on. I am usually to much for them to handle. I am me. I can not change certain things about me. I am who I am. That is why I have tried to be so open with you about me. I want you to know what You are getting in to. I am not an easy person to be with. I very easily acknowledge that.  I honestly feel that you are the person for me. You seem to have accepted me for who I am. Maybe things will change after I visit you. I truly hope not. You are the greatest thing to happen to me. I just wish that it did not take 39 years to find you. I am gonna go so that I can talk with you so more. I Love You Lei.
I Love You So Much

      Dear Lei;
I want to call yo so badly. I am gonna try to wait a few days. I do not want to use up all of your time on your phone. I cost you enough money. You mean so much to me. It is nice to know that there is someone out there that cares about and loves me. Even if she is so far away. I Love you. You make everyday special. Just knowing you are out there for me. One day we will be together. I do not know when it will be, but someday it will be. My horoscope is kinda interesting today. Check it out

Leo
You could write five pages about the air around you or speak extemporaneously for hours. Everything in the world is a trigger for your imagination. You're exciting to be around, mostly because other people fascinate and inspire you. You'd absorb each person's life story if you could. This hunger for knowledge drives you to hit the books or do some other kind of research. Maybe you're in a position to sign up for classes on subjects about which you absolutely must know more. There are almost as many ways to gather facts as there are ways to learn them.

I hope that you are online this weekend. I miss you so much. I am glad that I am able to call you. I am sorry that I call you everyday. I just miss you so much. I hope that I do not cost you to much money with me calling you so much. I wish you would let me help you with money. Maybe then you would nat have to work so hard on Sunday and you and I could chat more. Maybe I could hire you to work for me on Sundays? Can I hire you? Just let me know how much your time cost? I will gladly pay. I know that your time is worth money. I am going to do whatever it takes. To me, money is no object. What ever it cost me to accomplish what I want is worth every penny. I guess I better go.

I am in dire need of some pictures of you. I want them for my computers, and my walls. I want to put pictures of you everywhere. I have the picture of you on both of my computer screens. I think I am gonna make a poster of the picture of you that is on my computer screens. I found a web site where I can have it made. You are so beautiful and sexy to me. I will never have enough pictures of you. When I come to visit you I will be taking pictures of you and I all the time. I will of course send you copies of them all. I am gonna try and get me a reasonably priced digital camera to bring with me. The one that I would love to have is to expensive. It it about 8000.00 HK dollars. A little more than my budget will allow right now. I Love You so much. I can not believe that I have found such a wonderful woman. Of course she would have to be a quarter of the world away or more. Well no one said love was easy. One day we will be together. Forever and Always. I think I am gonna go for now.

      Dear Lei;
I just got off the phone to you. It is so good to hear your voice. I miss our weekly talks on the computer. It is hard with out you each week. That is why I have to call you all the time. I hope that my phone calls to you do not cost you to much money? If they do let me know and I will try not to call you to often. I do not want to cause you to need any more money than you already do. I already feel like I am the reason that you have to work two jobs on Sunday. I would gladly help you if you would let me. I can get by on very little. I do not either need or ask for much. You are the most important person in my life to me. No one else even comes close. The next closest person would have to be my son and your girls of course. Actually the four people listed are the only ones that matter to me. There is no one else. All of my family lives very far from me. The only family I have around me is my son and my ex's. I stay to myself. I do not intrude in on them on holidays or anything. Just my son and I is how I like it. One day I will be able to spend it with you and your girls. When you and I are together I will feel like a complete person again with a family. Until then I am solo, just like you. You have touched me so deeply. It is like, I do not know I can not put it in words. I know you know what I am talking about. I am pretty sure you feel the same. I guess I better go. I am missing you to much right at the moment. :((

      Dear Lei;
It was fun talking to you a little while ago. After I got off of the phone to you, I did some reading in my new school book. It looks complicated and challenging, but I have to admit, that I work very well under pressure. The more pressure and the greater the challenge the better I like it. I look forward to the time when I can come over and see you. Please talk to your boss soon. Maybe you should ask them when would be a good time for them to let you have the time off for my visit? Have you told them anything about me? Do they know that you have a boyfriend that lives very far away? I am guessing that they probably do know about me. If they do, just tell them that I would like to be able to come over and visit you for about two weeks. Let them know that we were thinking of sometime between April and August. What would be the best time for them to let you have the time off to spend with me? I am sure they would like it if you were to ask them so far in advance. I know that they will respect your asking them when would be best for them. They have a young baby. I do not know how long they have been married, but if they have such a young child, they might still be in love. If they are still In Love with each other, they might be very receptive to your taking some time off for a boyfriend. I am not trying to rush you. Maybe just advise you or guide you. Not really sure. All I know is that I want to come over and be with you so bad. I am as nervous as you are about actually meeting. At the same time I am very excited. I am gonna go for now.  I will be in touch again very soon.

      Dear Lei;
I Love & Miss You so Much! I miss our days of old, when we used to be able to talk each week. I know you have to do, what you have to do to make ends meet. In other words pay your bills. I guess I was the one in the fantasy world this time. I actually thought that things would not change for us so soon. I thought things would not change for us for a long time. The reason I only work one job, is not because I have enough money. I could use a lot more money. I think I am running a deficit in my budget now. I will not work more than one job, because it takes away what is important to me. My family, which at the moment consist of just my son and I. I also consider you part of my family. I consider you to be my wife. This may be presumptuous or arrogant of me. If it is I am sorry. I could change my hours at work and make more money. However I can not do that. If I did that, then you and I could not talk except on the phone. I would more than likely have to work each Saturday night my time, which happens to be Sunday morning your time. I would be going to work the same time that you would be on Sunday morning and not getting home until after the cafe closed. I can not and will not sacrifice either the time I have with you or my son. No amount of money can replace lost time. My father used to work 6 days a week and never had time to be a father when I was growing up. He also used to cheat on my mother with other women. I saw what that did to her, and that is why I can not cheat on my partner. I know how I felt about his not either being there for me or doing things with me. So that is why I can not give up any of my time with either my son or you for any amount of money. If giving up either my time with you or my son would make me a million dollars, I would have to stay poor.
I am not mad at you. I Love You to much to be mad at you. I just miss you. I just thought that I should explain a little about me. You do what you have to on your end. If you have to work on Sundays to get the money to get a divorce so that you and I can one day eventually get married, then keep on working my love. The time I lose with you now, will just bring you to me that much sooner. I do miss you. I do not want you to feel bad. It is just natural to miss the one that you love when they are not around. I will continue to send you text messages on the phone and I will call you as much as I can. I just hope that my calling you does not cost you to much money. If it does let me know and I will not call as much. I do not want to cost you any more money than necessary. You just let me know what I can do my Love. I am here for you. I can and will help you, if you will only let me. I wish I had the million to send you. Is that million in American, Hong Kong or Philippine? I hope I have not upset you my love. That was not my intention. I just wanted to explain a little more of me to you. Until the next time we get to talk. Whenever that might be. I will always be here for you. As the song goes " I Will Always Love You!" You are the only one that I want to be with. If it takes me one year or five, it will happen. Au revoir my Love

      Dear Lei;
What do you think of my horoscope today?
Today's Leo Horoscope
 July 23 - August 22

The stars give you the gift of yourself, and it's the best package that you'll ever open. Flaunt who you are in all your bright colors and daring music. You have many imitators but few rivals. Whoever they think they are, ultimately their job is to follow you around and make you look good. Your high profile and universal recognition give you the power to do exactly what you want to do. With the deck stacked in your favor, you're guaranteed success in all pursuits. And if any of this start to get boring, don't worry. Challenges wait on tomorrow's horizon.

Romance

You're famous among your lover's family and friends. People that you've never met until now already seem to know a lot about you. Luckily, it's all good. Your sweetheart mentions your name only in connection with wonderful things.
Find a perfect match...
Technical

Whether you're working or playing, nobody can stop you. You get what you want, and you actually want a lot. This might be the time to get started on that special project that only you could imagine and execute.
I Like it.

      Dear Lei;
It is very cold here tonight. Right now outside it is only 2 degrees. I am cooking me something to eat and hoping that I will see you come online here soon. I sent you a few messages and I am hoping you got them. I know that you are at your other job cleaning. I wish that you would let me help you financially. I can not do much, but it would make feel better. Then you might have a little more time to spend with me on Sundays. I actually miss being up til the sun comes up talking to you. Those eight hours went by so quickly talking and looking at you my love. I am gonna go for now.

I am glad that you got your rose. One of these days it will be real flowers. I just though I would say I Love You and Miss You Very Much. I hope that we get to talk this weekend.

I Love & Miss You! I feel like I might be losing you. Maybe it is just my imagination, it probably is. You and I have so little time together anymore. My life revolves around you my love. There is nothing else that matters. There is something I want to tell you. I just do not know how. Don't worry, I do want you as my wife. It is nothing like that,  but it is something I feel I should tell you. I guess one of these days I will. God I Love you! You can not know how much. I need to go. I will see you again soon, I hope.

It is amazing. Since I have met you, my whole week revolves around a few hours. The few that I get to talk to you on here. Nothing else neither matters nor do I look forward to like Saturday night after work. When I get in, I turn on both computers and hope and wait. I look for a pop up message from you, My love. One of these days, you and I will get to be together. I look forward to that time. I do not know when that time will be. I am guessing it will probably be in August of this year. I guess I am gonna go.

I miss you. I can not wait until you get your letter and package on Monday. I wish I could be there to see your face. Nothing really special, just a little something to say I Love You. Sitting here waiting for you. I am hoping that you will be online soon. It is going pretty good this week. I hope that you got my messages this morning. I think I am rambling today. Having problems concentrating. I think I will go for now. I will get back to you soon.
I Love You Lei.

      Dear Lei;
It is almost 3pm your time Saturday afternoon. I just finished reading part of your horoscope. I think it is something that you should read, especially the Romance section. Here it is
Today's Pisces Horoscope
 February 19 - March 20

People want to hear what you're thinking. If enough of them offered you a penny for your thoughts, you could afford a nice vacation. But maybe you don't want to go anywhere. You could be in a place where honesty and communication give you all the release that you need. Your words flow like water. Your images paint themselves across any blank surface that cries out for decoration. Great truths show themselves in natural phenomena. You can't be the only one to see them. Everybody needs to know.

Romance

You can't believe that some couples are still keeping score. The tides of your lives flow back and forth through the accepting filter of your romance. It doesn't matter who owes whom when the payoff is ongoing and endless.

Just a little non subtle hint. I will see you tomorrow.

      Dear Lei;
I Love You So Much. I can not tell you how much I love you. Words just are not enough. No action I can do, can express my feelings. My intensity for you is unmeasurable. I can not get enough of you. I want to use all my senses on you, I want to hear your voice, I want to look at your beauty before me, I want to taste your lips on mine, I want feel your body touching mine,  to be able to smell your hair and the rest of you. Do not take that the wrong way. I want to par take of all that is you. I hunger for all that is you. Nothing can change what I feel for you. Each day my feelings for you grow more and more. I find it harder to be able to concentrate on other things. My thoughts are constantly drifting your way. I have never been like this before. I do not know either why you have this affect on me or how you have managed to have this effect on me. Well my love, I am gonna go for now.

      Dear Lei;
Hi my love. The weather is still cloudy and rainy. I am so tired tonight. It was nice to hear your voice on the phone today. Unfortunately our conversation did not last longer. It seems like whenever you and I talk on the phone during the day, we get interrupted. The only time you and I are not interrupted on the phone is when it is night time here. When I talk to you during the day your time, the only thing that usually interrupts us is the baby. Vicky was here for awhile today. That is unusual for her. She does not stop down that often. I am usually here all by myself. I very seldom have any company. I am pretty much a loner. I have very few friends. I guess I like it this way. I enjoy company when some one comes over. However I enjoy my time by myself. I have always been like this. Even as a kid I had very few friends and spent most of my time alone. I enjoy when I am with someone. Being a loner I devote all my off work hours to them. Being with me is not easy. I know that I can be very demanding. All I can say in my defense is that I like what I like.  You will find out when we are together on our vacation. I hope that I am not to demanding for you. I will try not to be. I do want you to know the real me. I do not want to be something or someone that I am not. That would not be fair to you either. To love me you have to know the real me. I love you so much. I hope that I do not either disappoint you or upset when we are finally together. You mean so much to me. It is hard to put in words what I feel for you. When I either see you on the computer, look at your picture or hear your voice on the phone, it just brings a smile to my face. Well my love, I am gonna go for now.
I Love you so much.
Love Forever & Always Kevin

      Dear Lei;
Today was such a dreary day. It has been raining almost 24 hours straight. It was so nice to hear you voice tonight. Your my sunshine on a rainy day. The light at the end of a dark tunnel. I am so glad that you and I found each other. It is hard to believe that we have been talking to each other almost a year. It has gone by so fast. I am going to try and send you some new cd's and pictures. I know that you love getting both. I can not wait until I have more pictures of you. When I get back from our visit together I am going to have pictures of you and I all over this place. My wall are so empty. There is just the one picture of you on them.  I find you so attractive. I love your smile, the sound of your voice, everything about you. I still can not believe that I found such a sexy lady and that she actually finds me attractive also. Just looking at your picture or hearing your voice on the phone brings a smile to my face. If you take any pictures of yourself for me, do not worry what you look like in them. We are our own worst critic. I will love any pictures that you send me, know matter how you look in them. I did not think that the pictures that I sent you were that good, however you loved them. So do not worry my love. I love you for better or worse, nothing can stop my love for you. Well my love, I am gonna go for now.

      Dear Lei;
I am at a loss for words today. Little Kevin was home sick today. His mom and I went to a meeting at his school with his teacher. He stayed with Vicky's mom while we went to the meeting. Her and I were in the living-room talking when he came running in. He said my one cat Banjo was outside and would not move. Vicky went out first and I put my shoes on. He had passed away outside my living-room window. I was wondering where he was. I have not seen him in about two days. Kevin was trying to sneak in the house and scare us and that is how he happened to find Banjo. So the day kinda went downhill after that. I also can not find my mobile phone charger. I have no idea where it is. I do not just lay it around either. I usually keep certain things in certain spots so I always know where they are, and that is one of those items. I am gonna go for now my love.

      Dear Lei;
Well my horoscope is at it again. Check this out:
Leo
Ask nicely, even when you already know that you're getting what you want. Earning this entitlement is the best way to prolong it. Generosity begets generosity as you pass that good karma down the line. After all, why show the world a greedy face when it's treating you so well? The best thing about having all this power is watching other people's reactions when you share it with them. The element of surprise turns you on. You don't mind being a disruptive force as long as everybody goes away happy. Find new ways to make your life pleasant and fun.

What you think? My horoscope has sure been right quite a lot since meeting you. our time is getting closer. Our time together sure will be nice. It is hard to believe that you and I have been talking for nine months now. It does not feel like it has been that long. It was nice talking to you on the phone this morning. It is always nice to be able to hear your voice. It was really nice on Sunday when I called you while you where at the cafe. I really enjoyed being able to see you while talking to you on the phone. It was almost like being there with you. I guess I am gonna go for now. I miss you so much when I can not talk to you.

      Dear Lei;
Check out my horoscope for today:
Leo
You want what you want, and that's how it's going to be. Stubbornness isn't a virtue in some people, but in others it's their central operating principle. The women in your life will understand this kind of dedication, while the men might find it harder to relate. This is your gift from the stars, especially if you're working on a romantic angle. And if no one holds a special place in your heart right now, cast your fate to the winds and go out exploring. Someone out there is sure to fit the profile that you already have in mind.

      Dear Lei;
I called the Philippine consular today. I wanted to ask them a few questions. I got an answering machine and left my phone numbers. I hope I will hear from them on Monday. I also e-mailed them last week. I will send you a link to the information that I found online. To get your opinion. I applied for my passport on Tuesday. I should have that in a few weeks. Tonight I wrote my employer a letter informing them of my trip. I have also located air fare and a hotel that is affordable. Things are going real well. I will purchase my ticket in a few weeks. I will probably purchase it on the third of March. Once I do that, there will be no turning back. I will be committed to coming to the Philippines. I Love You So Much. Time went by so quickly this week. I know that with so many things to do before I come to see you, that time will go by quickly. I hope you like the hotel that I found. I think that it is nice. It is unlike a regular hotel. It is more like a chalet. It will not be long now my love. I have started counting the days. Erica asked how many hours until you and I are together and I figured it out, just to be a smarty. It is nice having my home phone and being able to call you and hear you so clearly. It is also nice that you can call me while I at home instead of just on my cell phone. I am gonna go now my love. I will hopefully see you online tomorrow. Until then my love.

      Dear Lei;
I am finding myself thinking of you more and more. My thoughts are racing. My mind goes from one thing to another. When I am not at work, I am finding it hard to concentrate on any one thing, other than you. I want nothing more than to call and talk to you all the time. I know I am not being realistic. However right now it does not feel real. It feels almost surreal. It is almost like being in a dream that I can not wake up from. I do not think I will wake up until you and I are standing in front of each other. I know that you do not want to get to excited for fear of being let down. I am the same, and yet I am not finding anything that is going to stop me from being with you in the Philippines. There are a few things that you and I have to go over the next time we talk on the computer. Well my love, I am gonna go for now.

I went and applied for my passport today, they said it should take about three weeks. Not long after that you and I should be together. I know that the time that you and I get to spend together will pass very quickly. I am just glad that you and I have a chance to be together. I know that I am being presumptuous. I guess when it comes to you, I am an optimist.  Since I have started talking to you, my whole outlook on life has changed. Knowing you has given my life a purpose. Something it was sorely missing. Things are looking pretty good. I just have a good feeling. Thanx my love. Just fro being you and being there for me. I am going to go for now. I will be back here again later.

I Love You So Much. Today was a busy day. I had a bunch of errands to run. I have one to do tomorrow. Then I go back to work on Wednesday. I now have a phone. I sent you a text message with my new phone number. Now you can reach me 24/7. Now you can either reach me on my home phone or my mobile phone. Feel free to call me anytime day or night. It will not bother me. You can wake me up anytime. To wake up to your voice would be a pleasure. One of these days, I will cherish the day that I actually wake up next to you. That will be one of the happiest days of my life. Just knowing that you are out there for me, brings me great joy. Well my love, I am gonna go for now. I will be back to you again soon.

      Dear Lei;
I am glad that I could bring a little happiness to your day yesterday. That was the first time I have ever sent flowers to a woman. I have bought many flowers before, but I have never sent them to anyone before. It felt good. I Love You so much. I know that you do not like me for the things that I buy you. You and I love each other for whom each person is. I enjoy buy the little things. Big things are nice, however I think the little things matter more. I enjoy surprising you. I can not give a lot, however what I do give comes straight from my heart. One time when I was working at a place, an elderly man gave me a tip. It was a folded business card. Inside the card it read, "It is nice to be important, but it is more important to be nice." There was also a two dollar bill in it for me. I still have that card and two dollar bill. I thought the saying in that card was so right. So many people think so many things matter that really don't. You are the most important thing in my life. Nothing else means more to me than you do. That is the truth. No one else means more to me than you do. I will explain when you and I talk on Yahoo. Well I am gonna go.

After the way things have gone this past month you and I deserve nothing less than our dream to come true. I Love You So Much. When I can not either talk to you or be with you on the computer, I feel as if the best part of me is missing. It will be heaven to be with you. Our time is so close now. Only 8 days left until I depart from here, 28 hours later I will be in Manila. It is going to be a long trip, and you are worth every minute of it. I am going to go for now my love. I am in the middle of cooking dinner.

Things are just about finished on my end. I received my laptops backpack today. I went shopping and picked up most of what I needed for my trip. I just have one or two little things left to pick up. I bought a frame for your poster. I have it hanging on my wall. I now have a bigger and better picture of you to look at. I can not wait until you and I are together. It is all I think about. Just being with you. I know it will be a wonderful experience. I just hope that I can make you happy while we are together. You sound so happy on the phone when you and I talk. Hearing your voice I can not help but to smile also. You mean everything to me. Your my hope, my inspiration, my dreams, my fantasies and my realities. Quite a lot for such a little woman. I hope that you do not mind me putting all of that on you? I know that you are a strong person. I have admired you from the very beginning of our friendship. You impressed me early on.

I just ordered the last item for my trip. I found a backpack to carry my laptop and other electronics in. I read it is safer to carry laptops in backpacks so thieves do not know what you are carrying. Makes sense to me, so I ordered one. It was not that much. If it makes carrying my laptop, phone and digital camera easier on my trip it will be worth it. It is getting so close to the time I get to be with you. It is impossible to hide my excitement. Everyday is a good day. I do not think anything can ruin any day right now. I can not get enough of talking to you. I have over 11 hours of phone time to you this month. That does not count the times that you have called me, just the amount of time that I have called you. I guess you and I just love to talk. I just can not get enough of you. You are everything to me. You give my life hope, meaning and everything else that goes in to being a human being. Well my love, I am gonna go for now.

I received your pictures of you today. You look so good in them. Your pictures radiate with your sensuality.  You are so good looking in those pictures. I can not believe that I found such a sexy young lady. I was captured in your spell the moment that I saw your picture the very first time. Sometimes I still can not believe that things actually went the way that I hoped from the beginning. I am so thankful that you let me in to your heart. You took a chance on me, I am forever grateful. I hope that I never do anything to  cause you to regret putting your trust in me. I know that it took a lot for you to do that. I had to work had to gain that trust and your love. You mean everything to me. My whole world revolves around you. Nothing else really matters. I showed your pictures around work today. Everyone thinks that I am very lucky to have such a lovely lady interested in me. The accountant put it best today when she said "Somethings are just worth it!" referring to me coming over to see you. I can not wait for us to be together. It will be like heaven on Earth. I am gonna go for now my love.

I missed you this past Sunday. I understand you being with your friends. I do not want you to think that I want to isolate you in any way. However if it were possible to spend eternity with just you and I, that would be heaven. Nothing else could make me happier. I miss you when you are not there. The other thing that happens when you are not around, is that I love you more. You are so much a part of me. I do not feel whole unless I am able to be with you in some way, either by phone, computer, or web cam. I feel as if something is missing when you are not a part of my life. As our time fast approaches, being with you is all I can think about. I Love You!

You are all that I can think of these days. At night it is worse. All that I want to do is call you and stay on the phone for ever and ever. I know it is not practical. It is what I would love to be able to do. I just want to be by your side 24/7. I Love You So Much. I am really looking forward to seeing the pictures that you have sent me. You looked so nice in them on the net cam last weekend. When you and I are together it will be like I am in heaven. I know that I have found my angel, and she is such a pretty one. Well my love I am going to go for now. I will get back to you soon.

      Dear Lei;
I was just checking a few things out. It looks like you and I were destined to meet in the Philippines. I was just checking out the rates for the hotel and air fare to Hong Kong. At first it looked like the airfare to Hong Kong was about 780HKD cheaper than what I paid for my ticket to the Philippines. Upon closer observation I realized I would have  arrived on the 8th not the 9th and I would have lost the 18th with you. To leave here and arrive there at the same time I am leaving to meet you in the Philippines would have cost me 4,926 HKD more than my ticket to the Philippines. The hotel would have cost me about 2,300 HKD more than the room in the Philippines. That would have been almost impossible for me to be able to come up with. I guess things worked out for the best. Since I am meeting you in the Philippines things ended up costing me a lot less. I am just sorry that us meeting cost you some money. Everything that happens, happens for a reason. I guess we were supposed to meet in the Philippines, so that you and I could meet. Like I told you before, were you and I does not matter to me. All that matters to me is that you and I are together. I am gonna go for now my love.

I guess your mobile ran out of time. It was nice to hear you voice for the short time that we had to talk. I enjoy talking to you so much on the phone. I could call you and talk to you all the time. That would get a little expensive and time consuming though. So I try to call you every other day or so. Our time together is fast approaching. I am looking forward to my visit with you. I feel so lucky. Not only did we manage to find each other, but I am actually going to meet you. Our time together will be so special.  You and I will take lots of pictures together. We do not have to worry with my camera about wasting film, the only thing it takes is batteries.  Well my love, I am going to go for now. I will get back here again very soon.

      Dear Lei;
Today was a rough day. Very stressful. Well let me just say that it started out rough and ended up pretty good. My passport will be here in a few days and so will my airline tickets to see you. I just have to order one little thing and find us a place to stay. I found us a little place. Nothing special, all I need is a room and you. I will talk about it and show it to you on Sunday. This is just a little place in Manila. We can always go to Laguna after a day or so. It really does not matter to me what I see of the Philippines. Just having you by my side for 10 days is all I need to see. I am sure your country is very lovely. It can not compare to you. Nothing can. I will be in heaven. I can not wait. You are so special to me. Words can not adequately describe my feelings for you. No song can, I am not sure there is anything I can do to show how much that I love you. I am gonna go my love. Very tired tonight. It is 1pm your time Thursday afternoon and I have been up since 9pm Wednesday evening your time. I will be going to bed very soon. Until the next time.

      Dear Lei;
I hope all is well with you today. Things are going good over here. Our time is getting so close. I am so nervous about coming to see you. There are so many first involved in meeting you. I have never travelled anywhere. I have only been on a jet once. Flying does not bother me. I actually like it. I have never been outside of the United States. On this trip I will enter two countries. I will fly from Florida to Los Angeles California. There I will change planes, and then fly to Taipei Taiwan. Then of course I will fly to Manila and be with you. I just hope I do not get lost in one of the airports when I have to change flights. Especially in Taiwan, after all I do not speak the language. It is also my first time going anywhere by myself. My first vacation by myself. All for you and I. Only my Love for You could take me half way around the world. I would fly to the moon to be with you. There is nothing that can keep me from you. My Love for You is very Intense. My desire for you is even Greater. I guess I must also admit my Lust for You! I want to be with you so badly. I do not just mean sexually. Just to be by your side, will give me great pleasure. It will be so nice to be with not only someone I Love, but also be with someone that Loves Me. I know I have said it before, but I am going to say it again. To either hold you in my arms, to be laying on the floor watching a movie, or to be laying next to you in bed, will be such a great relief, joy, and a pleasure. Nothing else could happen to bring me greater joy than our time together. I am gonna go for now my love.

      Dear Lei;
Well things are going pretty good this year. Last year was so bad, I deserve a good one. With you and I together in this one, I know things are looking up. Today a friend and coworker came over and I helped him finish putting the transmission in my car. After I got cleaned up, I went to the grocery store, paid my water bill and then went to the post office. My passport was not there yet. I then filled out your envelope and mailed your cd's to you. When I got home, I called the U.S. Passport Services to check on the status of my passport. They told me that it was completed today and I would have it in the mail in a few days. I then checked to make sure that they were mailing it to my post office box and not my home address. I always worry when I have to put both my mailing and my physical address on something. If they accidentally send it to my home address, I will not get it. I was so glad to hear that it was going to my post office box. I just have to order my laptop current converter, get my plane ticket and get you and I a hotel room reservation. Not to much left to do. I am hoping to have my ticket by the time you read this. I am so looking forward to our time together. I am going to go for now. I will talk at you again soon.

      Dear Lei
I am trying to get myself to Hong Kong to work and be with you. I sent in a resume today. Just a shot in the dark. I will keep looking and sending in resume's. That is all I can do. Maybe one of the employers over there will want to take a chance on me. It would be nice. I know that my family will think that I am crazy wanting to move over there to work and be with you. I do not care what anyone thinks. I just want to be happy. Being over there with you and working over there would make me very happy. My happiness is all that matters to me, and of course your happiness also matter to me my love. All I want to happen is that you and I are happy. After you and I have attained our happiness, we can work on making other people happy. Who ever that may be. I love you so much. I will stop at nothing to bring you and I together. I will spare no expense and there is nothing that I will not try to bring you and I together. I am going to go for now my love.

      Dear Lei;
You want to hear a good one. Vicky wants to know what products you use on yourself. She would like to know what lotion you use on your skin after a shower and any other tips that you can give her. You know what being sick has made me realize even more? That there is no one here for me that really cares about my well being. Yeah, Vicky says she does, but I asked that my son not stay with me tonight so that I can rest and he is here with me. She is coming down in the morning to get him up and off to school, but I am almost sure that I will be disturbed in the process. As you say, maybe I am just sour graping. I do not know. All I know is that I no longer want to be anywhere near here. The only person that I can really count on is myself anyway. If anything, this will make me more determined to get over there with you. I am going to go for now my love.

      Dear Lei;
I went to the Drs. They gave me a script for antibiotics, and some pain pills. I will not take those. I just usually take either aspirin or tylenol or whatever. I do not like taking pills. I went to the mail box and found your letter and pictures that you sent. I feel the same way about you my love. I knew that I loved you from the very beginning of when you and I started talking. However, in being with you, I know that I have finally found my one and only soul-mate. That is you dear. You do not have to worry about me not being here for you. I will always be here for you. If not in person, I am just a phone call away. I was just on monster.com updating my resume. I know that it is a long shot, but if anyone can do it, I can. I will not give up on being with you full time. That I can not do. You mean to much to me, for me not to try everything in my power to bring you and I together. I am going to go for now my love. Take care and have a good day.

      Dear Lei;
I just read my horoscope for today. I think that you will find it interesting. Anyway here it is:
Leo
Your intensity may be too much for certain people to handle. Oh well. It's their loss. You have no problems with being who you are. You'll do what makes you happy, and you'll live with the consequences, if any. This is how the right individuals find you. Take each other at face value, fully confident that what you see is what you get. Everybody wins in the games that you like to play. And if someone can guess what's most likely to turn you on, he or she will be your friend for life, or at least until the magic wears off.

 - By Astrology.com
Kinda describes what I have always said, even if it is not the way that I behaved in the Philippines with you. Do not worry about the magic wearing off between you and I. I will make sure that never happens. I love you to much. Well my love it is almost 5am Wednesday morning. I am trying to get some sleep. With me being sick it has really messed up my sleeping pattern. I am almost sleeping the same hours as you are. I am going to rest some more. In a few hours I will be going to the Dr.'s. I will give you a call when I get home. I miss you my love. I miss you so very much.
I Love You Lei

      Dear Lei;
It is Tuesday night about 10:30pm my time. I ate a little bit of soup about and hour or so ago. I am feeling very drained. My whole upper body hurts. I am starting to feel a little better tonight. I will still go to the Dr.'s. in the morning. I am tired of feeling sick. I think I am past the worst part, but I will go and make sure. Do not worry, I will be around for you. I have no plans on going anywhere. I Love YOu So Much. If this is what I have to go through to see you, then so be it. You are worth anything to me. The pain I would go through not being with you would be far worse than what I have gone through in the past week. I can get medicine to feel better, but being without you, nothing can heal that. Not even time. The only reason I can keep going on now is because I know that it is only temporary. Even if it is for an extended time. Well my love, I am going to go for now. I will get back here soon.

      Dear Lei;
Well my love, I just posted my resume on Monster.com seeking employment in Hong Kong. I do not know if anything will come of it. I do have to try. I feel it is something I have to do. It is a shame that you can not talk openly to your employer. Since they are a foreigner working in Hong Kong, and you said they have some American friends, if you could talk to them maybe they could help me get employed there. I understand why you can not. It would be nice to have some help on your side of the ocean. I hope that I can pull this one off. It will be my greatest accomplishment ever. To be able to get employed half way around the world, that would be the greatest. I know that it will probably not happen, but I am going to give it my best shot. I love You that much. I am going to for now my love.
I Love You Lei

      Dear Mrs. Seitter
:-) I think I have found something that scares me even more than the love that you and I have for each other. Our understanding for each other. When a problem arises you and I have the ability to talk things out.  It might take us a few days to get to see each others point of view, but we eventually do. This past week I have experienced so many lows. In talking to you each day, I know that you to have experienced many lows this week. Along with the lows there has been some confusion on each others part. I am so glad that you were honest with me about doing pictures with PC. The ones that you did for me before we met in the Philippines were so good. I could not believe my eyes. To see my wife looking so sexy, I was in awe of you my love. I still am. I know that it took great courage for you to be able to do those pictures. When you and I are together next year, no matter where it might be, you and I will do some location pictures. I am pretty sure that you and I will be together in HK. I am looking forward to spending time with you there. I know that you are excited to show me around and show me off to all of your friends. Maybe my wish of being able to work in HK is unrealistic, however I feel I have to try to bring you and I closer in distance as soon as possible. Our hearts and souls deserve the happiness that each of us bring each other. I am going to go now my love, my friend, my lover, my confidant and last but not least, my life long companion. I am glad you let me in to your life last year. You have given my life meaning. You have also filled it with great joy, and a little heart ache also. The heart only aches because you and I had to part, not because of anything that either you or I have done to each other. I think that is great. Until tomorrow my love

      Dear Mrs. Seitter
I know that you and I are not really married legally yet. However the way that I feel about you right now is that we are. In my heart and my soul you are my wife. The ten days that you and I were together in the Philippines, has really affected how I feel about things. Home does not feel like a home, my job does not matter, my car, nothing around here matters to me any more. The only thing that I want is to be by your side. Without being by your side, my life just feels so empty any more. Being with you gave my life meaning and a purpose. I think about you more now than I ever did before you and I met physically. I did not think that was possible. I just want to be with you. My thoughts are constantly cloudy, my concentration is only of you. I can not focus on any given subject. I just want to call and talk to you all the time. When I can not talk to you, I am missing. My whole world lights up when you and I can talk on the phone. I have never felt this way about any one before in my life. I do not know if it is either because you and I are so far apart or I love you so much. My heart aches to be with you again. I want to move to Hong Kong just to be with you. Even if it meant that you and I could only be together for one day a week, that would be more than I have now. The camera on the computer does not do justice to you anymore. You are so much more attractive than the camera shows. I am awe struck with your beauty and sexuality. Just looking at you brings a smile to my face. I guess it is time to close this little note to you for now. I just want to say that you are my best friend, my lover, and above all else my partner in life. I am glad that you and I found each other my love. One day we will be together forever and always. 

I Love You Eleanor

            It is 740pm. I am in the smoking room at Taipei. I just read your last letter. I am missing you so much. I saw you run to your plane for boarding. I also saw you board the plane. you are the Love of my life. You are my life. My feelings for you is far above my feelings for anyone else. I am now sitting at a counter drinking a beer. Do not worry my love, i made a promise to you and I will keep it. My hands are shaking so badly i just need something to steady them. I just hurt so much from missing you and it has only been a few hours since we parted. It is now 140pm your time Monday. It was nice to hear you call me when i hit LAX. Don't cry my love. I love you. You and i will be together one day.
     Dear Lei;
	It has not been quite a day since you and I have parted. I am not quite home yet. It was nice to hear your voice on the phone when I landed in L.A. However, it was not nice hearing that voice crying. I will be back to see you again next year. I am always here for you. I am just a phone call away. I will also see you on Sunday. Time will be good to us. This I know. Do not worry, my leaving you is only temporary. 
     It is now 12:30 Monday afternoon. I am home. I have been for a few hours. It is killing me what our parting has done to you. To hear your voice on the phone trembling hurts me so badly. I Love You Lei! I miss you too my love. I have been cleaning up around here since getting home. I am trying to stay awake. I think I have been up about 18 hours, but I am not quite sure since the last time I slept was coming back here on the plane from Taipei. I checked my e-mails and cleared them out. I also paid my cable bill, so that I can keep talking to you. It does not feel like home here any more. To me, home is now where ever you might be! I can not call any other place home. 
When I went and checked my e-mail, my horoscope caught my eye. It pertains to you and I again. Here is my horoscope for today:
Leo
Diplomats have the golden touch. Lovers melt into your arms, anticipating your abilities and secure in your intentions. Anything is possible when the right people meet and recognize each other. There's no stigma involved with exerting your power. Your present company gives you full permission to be all that you can be. Approaching each master class and passing through every stage of development, you learn things that you would never have imagined just a short time ago. It's a pleasure and an honor. It's also impossible to see how life can ever be the same after this.

 - By Astrology.com
     Pleaz do not cry for us my love. It hurts me so to hear you cry. Our time will come. Pleaz try to be strong. Our love can and will survive. Either nothing can or will come between our happiness. I miss you my love.

It is almost 1-am here Wednesday morning. You should be in the Philippines by now. I will be leaving here in about 12 hours for the airport. I still have to pack. I will do that in the morning. I am heading to bed very shortly. I am very tired. Only getting about 4 hours of sleep the past 3 days. I can catch up on my sleep when I get on the flight out of La. So many different emotions right now. Definitely can't think. So I am going to go so I can rest and start my adventure to see you. I Love You!

      Dear Lei;
Today has been an incredible day. I am in awe of you, impressed by you, in shock by you, and I have fallen in Love with You all over again. I just could not believe my eyes. It was you. Incredibly sexy looking. I can not believe my good fortune. I have finally, truly found my one and only love in finding you. You appear to understand me like no other has before. In only 93 hours and 45 minutes, I will be in the Philippines. I know that a few short hours after that, you and I will be in each others arms. I can not find the words to describe how I feel for you right now. My love for you is beyond words. My concentration on my world around is nil. My thoughts and my whole world revolve around you. i know that anyone can say I Love You. I do. Sometimes those words can be so trivial, other times we can be forgetful and not say them. I just want you to know, I do not use them words lightly. I Love You. On Friday I will finally be able to look in your eyes and say those words to you in person. At that time, you and I will be able to see in to each others souls and know that it is true. Until then my Lovely Lei,
I Love You Lei

      Dear Lei;
Hi Love. I am still up. It is Friday 4:23pm your time, 3:23 am my time. I finished talking to you about an hour and a half ago. I have been working on altering one of your photographs for my computer. I now have you on my computer when it turns on. I will show you what it looks like when I see you on Sunday. It looks pretty good if I do say so myself. I did it all by myself. I think you will be impressed. I Love You So Much. In less than 1 week you and I will be together at last. I am also looking forward to meeting you mother. It will not embarrass me to either hug you, hold you, embrace your or kiss you in front of your mother. I just hope that she sees how much that I really do Love Her Daughter. I know that I am not perfect. I know I will make mistakes and one day you and I will probably have either an argument or a disagreement. That always happens between two people. Eventually something will come up and you and I will not have the same opinion on. That is fine. It would be nice if it always stayed the way it has been this past year. I think that is unrealistic, but you never know. Maybe you and I will be one of the blessed few. Whatever our future holds, as long as you and I are together for it, we can make it through it. I am now going to bed my love. I will be back here again soon.

Hi my love. Things went slowly tonight at work. I will be glad when this week is over. However it will not be over until next Tuesday. Then on Wednesday it is off to see you. I still have to pack my clothes and stuff. I will probably do that this weekend. Tuesday night after a little while, I will pack my laptop and get the rest of my electronics ready to travel. It will be nice to see you in person after all this time. You and I deserve a month together all alone after what you and I have gone through to get to be together. I know that is not possible, but we do deserve it. Next year hopefully things will not be a stressful for you and I to be together. Well my love, I am gonna go for now. I will be back again later.

      Dear Lei;
I think I am finally feeling like my old self again. Our conversation this past weekend really helped. You words really helped put my own fears to rest. They were very comforting and reassuring to me. You are unlike anyone that I have been with before. I am starting to believe that you really do understand me and accept me for the person that I am. Even with all of my eccentricities. I could not ask for a better partner to be with than you my love. You are the one that I have been looking my whole life for. Even my horoscope points to our conversation this past weekend. Here is what it says:
Leo
All's fair in love and war when you're winning. But when it's a partnership, everyone wins. Business and personal dealings benefit from honest actions and clear communication. Your absolute confidence signals that you have nothing to lose by talking. The material world is kind to people who pool their resources. You grow mentally and spiritually through sharing knowledge and reinforcing each other's beliefs. Old ways of thinking seem meaningless from this enlightened place. Every minute is another chance for even greater change. Even that feeling is a sign of progress.
- By Astrology.com
I do not know what to say to you except, that I Love You Lei. I want you and I to be together forever and Always. I want no other. I have always tried to be as open and honest with you as possible. For our relationship to grow and prosper, we both have to be open and have good communication between you and I. If we can not talk about our problems, then we cannot work to solve them. Keeping anything from each other will only lead to destruction. I am glad that you are finding it in you to discuss anything that comes to you that you need an answer to. I know that you have told me that in your past you would keep things to yourself and that you are trying to open up and ask questions when you need to with me. I really am glad to hear it. If we keep up, there is nothing that you and I cannot over come. I will be back again soon my love.

      Dear Lei;
I just checked my horoscope. What do you think, is it talking to me again? 

Leo
What happened to you? You were riding high without a care in the world, and then your smile faded and you pulled back your feelers. Your sudden caution is drawing the attention and comments of others. Further adventures look like expensive propositions as you consider what it costs to get ready for them. Ignore the whispers and review your budget carefully. You still care about the opinions of your loved ones, but in the end you're the only one who knows what's right for you.

It reminds me of when you and I were in the Philippines. I miss those days. I am going to try and send you your package this week. I want to get it out as soon as possible. That way you have it before Spain. I am going to go now love. You should be online very soon. Take care my love.

I am doing a little bit better today. A little less depressed. I know what I need to do, it is just doing it. I Love You To Much To Lose You Lei! I do not want that to happen. I want you to be happy about your choice to be with me. I do not want to let you down, you deserve better. I try to make very few promises. I try to make only the ones that I know that I can keep. It is not good to make a promise and then not keep it. The people that you break the promise to, can not trust your word any more. a persons word is really the only thing we each have that is our own. I am going to go my love.

      Dear Lei;
I had to turn the computer back on to put a quick post on here. I just sent you a text message betting that you will go to the party this weekend because of your friends. I know you very well my love. I know how easily you are persuaded by your friends in Hong Kong. They usually get you to do what they want. My guess is Rachel will tell you on Sunday that she put in that you will be there. So you will feel obligated to go because money was already spent on her telling her boss that you would be there. Therefore you will end up going so as not to  let Rachel's boss's money go to waste. I might be wrong, but I think you will end up going because of them. Like you have told me in the past, you have a hard time saying no to them. I am going to go now my love. I had to put that up here before I forgot it. Otherwise, I really do not feel like writing on here right at the moment. I will talk at you later.

      Dear Lei;
I like my horoscope today. Check this out:
Leo
You can get away with anything. Even the wicked thoughts you're thinking will only serve to polish your halo. All you need is a little discipline to look like an overachiever. People are so happy with you as you are that any effort just seems to gild the lily. Those who know you are easily impressed, and you're a shining beacon of possibility among strangers. Your share of the rewards is due and payable as of right now. Choose things that will stand as adequate souvenirs of this high point in your arc.

I wish it was true. I wish I was not so difficult a person to understand or to be with. On Sunday there is a program on Hong Kong. I am going to record it and watch it either Monday or Tuesday. Well my love I am going to go for now.

      Dear Lei;
Sorry about this past weekend. I know that it is not easy to be with me. Just ask any female that has been with me. I am trying to change my ways so that I do not lose you too. I do not know what to do. You mean so much to me. All I ever want to do is make the person that is with me happy and all I usually end up doing is making them hate both me and themselves. They probably wish they never even heard the name Kevin Seitter by the time we break up. I have tried to tell you as much about me and how I am from the very beginning. I have tried to be as open and honest as I could be with you. I never wanted to cause you any pain. Well my love, I am going to go for now.

      Dear Lei;
Sorry, still working on getting our pictures on the moblog. I have 79 pictures posted on there for you to look at. I hope you like all the pictures on there. If there are any pictures that you do not like on there just let me know and I will take them off of there. I love you so much. I miss you a lot. I wish I could be over there with you. Soon I will be over there with you. One way or another, I will be over there with you. Hopefully it will be to work and live over there. If not at least for my vacation and for you and I to get married. I am going to go for now.
I Love You Lei

      Dear Lei;
Sorry I have not been here in a few days. It has been a little crazy around here, as you know from our phone conversations. I know that you are in the middle of a busy day and we will not get to talk until bedtime your time. I have to get my little guy off to school in the morning. Vicky asked me to. Naturally I said yes. Sucker. Oh well. I am making me something to eat. I better go before I destroy it. I will be back soon.

      Dear lei;
I am glad that you and the baby are feeling better. Someday instead of you raising someone else's baby, you will be tending to ours. I have a new website for you to check out. http://kseitter.textamerica.com/ I think that you will like the content my love. Just a little something from me to you, again. I just love doing these little things for you. I hope that you like it, even though I know you will. You have a good day and enjoy.

      Dear Lei;
I like my horoscope today. This is what it says;
Leo
Anybody who thinks that your personal blaze is out of control doesn't know what this particular fire means to you. You're hotter than you've been for ages, and you like it this way. Throw all caution to the wind and let your confidence carry you to new heights. If you saw someone else in this condition, you'd assume that his or her balloon was full of hot air. But you're the real thing from head to toe, and if people are humoring you, you'll accept it as a loving gesture. Maybe you actually want to show off. You're certainly entitled.

Maybe it is saying that I am determined to get over to you. I do not know, but it sure sounds like I am going after something.

I do not know why you are quitting working on Sundays. You and I both know that you need the money. I can not get a straight answer from you. I guess it is just one of those things. All I can say is I love You.

      Dear Lie;
I just got up a little while ago. It was 6:30 this morning before I fell asleep. Wish I knew why I can not sleep at night any more. Oh well, just one of those things I guess. Hopefully it will pass very soon and I can get back to a little more normal time. I am catching up on my bills. Made some payment arrangements today, getting everything caught up. Hopefully by the end of next month I should be straightened out. At-least on my normal bills. Then I just need the little bit extra to get a few other things that I need to get. Oh well enough about that. I love You. I just checked my mobile phone. There was a message on there from you. I was surprised that there was not one on my voice mail. I noticed that when I picked up the phone to pay my bills. It surprised me. Well my love, it is time for me to go get ready for work. I will talk at you later. I hope have had a good day/week. I enjoy hearing your voice on the phone. Take care my love.

      Dear Lei;
Hi my love. It is Thursday morning your time. I got your message and I am waiting patiently for your phone call. It has been a long day. I miss spending my day with you. It was so relaxing when you and I were together. It was the most relaxing time in my life. I look forward to talking to you on the phone each day. When you and I talk, it is like we are together again. I am inpatient when it comes to wanting to be with you again. It can not come soon enough. It is hard to believe that it has been a month since you and I have spent our time together. And yet when you and I were together, time seemed to pass so slowly. I am going to go for now my love. I miss you so much. You take care and have a good day.

      Dear Lei;
I got my haircut done today. It is short all the way around now. I hope that you like it? Vicky says it looks good and makes me look younger. I think it looks pretty good. I am just not used to short hair. You will get a good look at it on Sunday on the web cam. If you do not like the way that it looks, let me know and I will let it grow out again. I went over to see Bob and Charlinda today. It was nice to be able to talk to someone about the Philippines. He also enjoys over there. I showed them pictures of us from over there. Charlinda was telling me that there is a lot of Filipinos that live around here. I did not even know it. Of course that is of no surprise, I do not go out and socialize with anyone around here. I just go to work, and home and to the grocery store as needed. It has been a long day. I am going to go for now my love. You take care and have a very good day and I hope that you do not have to work to hard.

      Dear Lei;
My blood was still boiling over my mother today. I talked with Vicky and she is going to talk to her. Vicky is going to tell her that the subject of you is off limits to her. As far as I am concerned my mother need not even ask how you are doing. If she can not accept me being happy then that is her problem, not mine. Your mother did not treat me that way. She asked me honest questions and I gave her honest answers. She did not try to make me feel bad because I want to marry you and possibly bring you half a world a way. No she just would like to see her daughter happy with the right person. If my mother can not do that, then she need not talk to me, because I will not have anything to say to her. There is one thing that I would like to say to you about the other day. When you told me that you did not love me for a few minutes, that hurt. I never stop loving you Lei. When I say forever & always, I mean it. I might not always agree with everything you do, but I never ever stop loving you. I am going to go for now my love.
I Love You Lei

      Dear Lei;
I just wanted to say one other thing that I forgot...... Oooooopppppppssss Bad Me. Sometime this past week was our first year anniversary. Not sure of the exact date, but I want to say it was the 7th of May 2003? So I just wanted to say Happy Anniversary Eleanor Leivy. I can honesty say that I love You More today than I did one year ago when I first laid my eyes on your picture. I also would like you to know that I know you are my soul-mate and the person that I want to spend the rest of my life with. Happy Anniversary Lei;

      Dear Lei;
I can not believe how much I have changed since I have been with you in Philippines. Nothing over here is right any more. I can not drink coffee, the food I used to eat does not taste good any more. I hate being here by myself. So much is now wrong with my life. The biggest and best part of me is missing and that is you. It is the other things that bothers me the most. I used to not be able to function or even start my day without my coffee. I had one cup of coffee tonight at work. I made a fresh pot and it did not taste good to me. I do not know what has happened to me since being with you in the Philippines? All I am left with is questions and no answers. The only thing that is right with me is that I am not depressed. That one puzzles me also. I wish I could find some answers to all of my questions? I do not know where to look for the answers. The only answer that makes any sense to me is being with you, and I do not mean over here with you either. I do not care if it would be Hong Kong, the Philippines anywhere over there would be perfect for me. I think the change would do me great. I know that I enjoyed the food, the weather and last but not least the company. Being with you just felt so right. I am going to go for now my love.

      Dear Lei;
I just got off of the phone with you. Somehow talking to you makes me feel better and brightens my whole day. You make my whole life better my love. Just being there for me. You do not even have to do anything to make my day better. You always manage to surprise me with your abilities. Just when I think there is something you can not do, you go and do it. You are an amazing woman to me Lei. You are so strong willed and independent, yet so vulnerable and fragile. With you it is balanced to nicely. Not to much of any one ingredient, it seems like everything is perfectly balanced in you. You are an easy person to love, and the more I know you, the more I Love You. It is like you make me love you more each day by the little things that you say and do. Your amazing my love, and very sexy looking to me. The day that you and I get married will be the happiest day of my life. I know on that day, you will be the sexiest lady on the planet to me. It will not matter to me what you are wearing that day, from something plain and simple, to a sexy wedding dress. No matter what, I know that you will have my attention all to yourself. I am going to go for now my love. 
I Love You Lei

      Dear Lei;
I laid down most of today after I talked to you on the phone. I had a headache and decided to just lay down and hope that it would go away. I woke up at 4pm, my son had gotten home at 3pm. When I got up at 4pm I still had a little bit of my headache, but I took some aspirin and it finally went away. I did some work on a couple of your photographs. I put you on my computer at start up. It has 3 images of you on start up and it says "The Beauty of OS X". Of course the real beauty on my computer is you my love. I can not get enough of looking at you. I know that you have the same problem when it comes to pictures of me. I have used up most of the new ink cartridge that I just got in printing pictures of our time together in the Philippines. I am going to try and print some more out and send them to you the beginning of June. That way you will have pictures the blogg and your music cd's to take with you to Spain for the summer. I know that you and I will miss each other while you are away. I also know that it will only make you and I stronger and more appreciative of the little bit of time that we do have together. As the song goes "Precious and Few are the moments we to can share." I have my horoscope from today I think it is talking about us again. What you think?
Leo
Experience can be a harsh teacher. Embarrassment sounds loud in your ears. Maybe you catch yourself making the wrong move. Maybe others can see right through your stealth and silence. Perhaps it's time to shout out your truth, regardless of how it plays to the masses. You feel as if you're on to something, even if you're not yet fully there. Effort is what makes the world go around. Maybe you have what it takes to be a star, or maybe you'll just be someone else's stepping-stone. You can't worry about these things now. Life's too short for doubting yourself.

I miss you so much my love. Loving you brings out all kinds of emotions in me. From the highs of knowing you, loving you and being loved by you, to the lows that come from having to be so far from my soul-mate. However I do not regret finding you or falling in love with you. I am so glad that you let me in to your heart and gave love one more last chance. Knowing you has changed my whole outlook on life. You have given my life meaning and purpose that it was missing before. I thank you for all that you have either given me or done for me. I could not have asked for a better match for me than you. I would not want to change anything about you my love. I love the way you look, your smile, your eyes, your figure, your attitude, I love everything about you. I love you for the person that you are and the person that you will be in the future. I have admired you almost from the very beginning. You are such a strong woman. I think that is one of the things that attracted me to you. I know that you are a very independent woman and that you are used to having to either do it yourself or it does not get done. I know that is why it is so hard for you to accept money from me. I just like helping the people that I care about my love. I am going to go for now. Until next time.

      Dear Lei;
I just got off of the phone to you. I enjoy just talking to you. You are so much to me. The most important thing that I can say you are to me is my best friend. I am glad that I have a friend such as you. I have so few friends. I value my friendship with you above everything else. If you and I had not become friends, our love would not have grown. I think it is very important for couples to be friends before anything else. I am thankful that you and I are friends above everything else. I do not know what I would do without you. I live each and every minute of every day just thinking of spending the rest of our lives together. I have such hope and faith i our relationship. I know that we each have our fears bout different things, I have some too. The thing that gives me the most hope is how well that you and I understand each other. I also enjoy how open that you and are with each other. each of us can express our concerns and fears and the other one reassures the one with the fears and together we figure out a solution. I could not ask for a better partner in life. I look forward to the day that you and I can hold each other in each others arms again. You and I have learned in our long distance relationship not to take each other for granted. We know how valuable our time together really is. With you and I starting this way, I do not think we will ever take each other for granted. We will just be thankful for our time that we have together. I am going to go for now my love. Until the next time.

      Dear Lei;
It is a shame that other people have to worry so much about other peoples lives. I wonder why? Is it because they have no life of their own? Are they just nosey and have to know everything? Why can't people just be happy for other peoples happiness? So many question to the same question. It is amazing how much time other people will spend on people who are happy. They are either trying to cause problems or just putting in their two cents when it is either not wanted or not needed. No one can change how I feel about you. I also know that no one is going to change how you feel about me. I am comfortable with our feelings towards each other. Our love for each other is to strong for any outside forces to break. I do not think they could either dent it or even diminish the shine that our love for each other has. You and I are truly a rare couple. You and I have given ourselves to each other completely and freely. Without either conditions or terms. Neither one of us demand anything of the other. We ask each other and we do because of our love and are feelings that we have together. That is all any person has the right to do is ask of each other, not demand. All that the person asked can do is give 100% to their partner. I Love You so Much Eleanor. In my dreams I asked for a woman like you, and I was so fortunate that you actually exist. I know that what I ask of you is not always the easiest. I try so hard to be fair and not ask anything of you that I know you can not do for me. This relationship is a new experience for me my love. I have never had any one that cared for and understands me the way that you do. I want you to know that. The only thing that scares me, is me. I want you to know you are the best thing that has ever happened in my life. You are even better than the birth of my son. I am going to go now my love.

      Dear Lei;
I have been writing this blogg for you for almost one full year now. You and I have been talking for just over one year. What a difference a year makes. Last year at this time was a very low point in my life. Then in May of 03, I found you. From that day on, my life seams like it has taken a turn for the better. All I can say is "THANK YOU!" For doing nothing more than being polite and answering me back. Just hat simple thing turned both of our lives around. I like to think that it has been for the better for both of us. I am going now my love.
