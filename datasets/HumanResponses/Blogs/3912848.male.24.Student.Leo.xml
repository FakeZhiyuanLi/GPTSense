      Archaeologists in the Holy Land have found an  urlLink ancient tomb  that may be the burial place of Simeon, the old Jew who came to the temple to see "the Lord's Christ" in Luke 2:25-35.  Evidently, the tomb held an inscription that matches Luke 2:25.  The inscription reads "Simeon who was a very just man and a very devoted old (person) and waiting for the consolation of the people."     The AP report mentions that the tomb may also belong to Zachariah, the father of John the Baptiser.  Very cool.

      The key to being "conservative" is reluctance to change long-established cultural, social, and political norms.  Conservative resistance to change is not based on some irrational, homophobic, money-grubbing fear of things and people different from ourselves.  The resistance to change is based on reason--namely, an understanding that things are the way they are for a purpose.  Modern social institutions are the result of centuries of trial and error which have developed patterns of living that produce efficient, ordered societies largely composed of happy and productive individuals and families.     These traditions reflect an acquired recognition that life and happiness are better achieved through institutions that support liberty, community, and family.  These are the foundations of prosperity and peace in the western commercial states.  Partly on this understanding, Jefferson wrote, "Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient Causes."  Just so, centuries of valuable human experience should not be rejected lightly.  Homosexual behavior is dangerous.  The average homosexual has had multiple partners and few stable monogamous relationships.  The homosexual lifestyle is self-destructive and leads to disease, drug abuse, and depression.  I have not read any studies about the effects on children of being raised in gay homes, but it is my hunch that the mountain of evidence that children are much more likely to grow to be well-ordered, productive adults if raised in two-parent homes did not consider gay two-parent homes.  To throw away such an institution just to ease the consciences of a few individuals incapable of a modicum of self-control is foolish.  I have news for homosexual activists: social recognition of your lifestyle will not assuage your guilt.    Constitutionally, I believe only state legislatures are authorized to decide the question.  Neither federal courts, Congress, nor sister-state courts should decide whether a state must recognize or allow gay marriage.  Only the people of the states themselves can decide.  Nevertheless, to the extent that I believe the courts will co-opt  the decision for themselves, I support the  urlLink Federal Marriage Amendment  as a way to protect the states and marriage from runaway courts.    Next post, I'll let you know how I  really  feel. ;-)   Update:   I believe that some things are important enough to our national societal health that they should be made a part of national policy.  There is nothing unconstitutional about a properly ratified constitutional amendment, whether it seemingly restricts personal liberty or not (BTW, all laws restrict liberty).  If anything qualifies for federal regulation, marriage does.  A house divided against itself cannot stand.   Update 2:  Good defense of legal recognition of traditional marriage by  urlLink J. Budziszewski .

      Great Movie!  (see my  urlLink previous post ) I am not a sailor, (the last time I went deep-sea fishing I got seasick!) but I am attracted to tall ships.  This movie fed my attraction.  I look forward to seeing it again â€“ the sooner the better.  Here are some of my thoughts.   I'm not a naval historian, but thanks to some heads up from a few critics I was on the lookout for M&Câ€™s details of seamanship--details that most modern movie makers neglect to include.  From removing the panels in the Captain's cabin to set up for battle to measuring speed in "knots," M&C offers multiple glimpses into the actual workings of early 19th-century naval warfare.  I saw some things that I knew of but had never seen reenacted, and several things that I didn't know about.  What a lesson.  And the story.  The M&C's lessons of friendship, leadership, and character were all told in a believable and attractive fashion.  Russell Crowe and the rest of the cast remain real and believableâ€”something that becomes more difficult the longer an actor like Crowe remains in the limelight.  The movie was also clean, which is always a plus for me.    I like what the  urlLink Chicago Tribune  said: â€œ"...probably the best movie of its kind ever made.â€? Good flick.  See it.

       urlLink Matt  has now begun a blog.  Sam has decided to close his.  I am not sure what our (the blogging community's) intent is in blogging.  I think it is in part our deep-seated need to confess our wrongs.  The blog allows this, though I'm not yet sure it's the best way to confess.  Of course, I know that the confession that  matters  is confession to God.  He's the one to whom we need to be reconciled.  I think that the blog can be a good supplement, though it should certainly not be a substitute.   I am a fairly prideful person and not very open to sharing faults, so I don't suppose there will be much confessing from me on this page.  Any confession will probably be cloaked.  Time will tell.    I do know that for those of us receiving the confessions, we owe the confessor a proper response;  true concern, forgiveness, humor (at the right time and to the right degree), and prayers.

      "Toyah" is the name of a creek running out of the Davis Mountains near Balmorhea, Texas, where our family farm resides.   urlLink Toyah Creek  is usually dry.  Rain clouds seem to be a biannual event in Balmorhea.  Occasionally Balmorhea and the mountains get a good rain, and for a day Toyah Creek and the gullys that run into are again flowing with water, and for the week after, much of what once looked dead comes to life.  Well, that is what I've chosen to name my blog after.  I am starting a web log, mostly as a way of keeping in touch with friends, several of whom also have blogs.  By the way, my name is Philip Vickers and I am a 2002 graduate of Hillsdale College.  I am back home in Texas and loving it.    Like Toyah Creek, I am dry and often look dead.  However, some occasional rain of grace awakens me and I get a thought or two I'd like to share.  Most of what you'll read on this blog will represent the dead me.  On occasion, however, the river might flow.  We'll see.

      Irreverent Texas entertainer and writer  urlLink Kinky Friedman  says he wants to run for Governor of Texas.  There's a good article on Kinky and his candidacy in the  urlLink NY Times .  Living in Austin, I hear the man's name occasionally, especially on  urlLink kvet radio , and I've seen his column in  urlLink Texas Monthly .    Would I vote for him?  Why not?  As the NY Times article notes, the Texas Governor's position is largely ceremonial, and Texas loves spirited governors ( urlLink Ann Richards ,  urlLink GW ); the current governor,  urlLink Rick Perry , is more than a little dull.

      Though I'm trying to study, I couldn't resist breaking to report some cool news:    Russia has decided  urlLink not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol .   America is now joined by another major world player in refusing to buy into the UN's lie that Kyoto will reduce global warming.  Russia and America recognize that Kyoto will cost billions in lost economic growth while having a miniscule impact on global warming.  No one is even sure whether global warming is man-made or simply a trend concurrent with the end of the last ice age.  Kyoto is global governance clothed in junk science.  Michael Crichton (author of such books-turned-movies as Jurassic Park and Timeline) recently spoke on the subject of religious environmentalism in a  urlLink speech  delivered to the Commonwealth Club of San Francisco.  Crichton correctly observes that for many urban Americans environmentalism has become an emotionally driven religion built upon a bundle of myths with no scientific basis.

      It's been a while.  Here's what I've been up to.    I spent New Year's in Michigan, hanging out with all of the former Highlanders, except for J-Rock, who was snoozing away in Charelvoix.  Hung out in Yipsilanti, East Lansing, and Hillsdale.  I had a great time, folks.  After arriving home Monday to Brady, Ben and I took off for a little backpacking in the  urlLink Guadalupe Mountains  in West Texas.  We climbed  urlLink Guadalupe Peak , the highest point in Texas.  The climb is just over 3000 feet and guaranteed to reintroduce you to any long-lost leg muscles.    Ben and I then drove to the border and stayed the night in Presidio, TX, a small town on the Rio Grande where my uncle farms wheat.  Presidio is just across the river from  urlLink Ojinaga, Chihuahua Mexico .  We then drove East along the river to  urlLink Big Bend National Park , 800,000 acres of desert and mountain along the Rio Grande.  Did a little hiking along the Santa Elena Canyon.  Incredible.    We continued on to Rocksprings in the south west Texas Hill Country and hung out with a couple of cousins for a day or two, and then met up with our parents in San Antonio for the weekend.  I really love that city.  What a great state!  I'm back in Brady for a few days and then back to Austin.  All in all a terrific last two weeks.     View from Guadalupe Peak over El Capitan

      Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney (R) in today's Wall Street Journal: With the Dred Scott case, decided four years before he took office, President Lincoln faced a judicial decision that he believed was terribly wrong and badly misinterpreted the U.S. Constitution. Here is what Lincoln said: "If the policy of the government upon vital questions affecting the whole people is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme Court, the instant they are made in ordinary litigation between parties in personal actions the people will have ceased to be their own rulers, having to that extent practically resigned their government into the hands of that eminent tribunal." By its decision, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts circumvented the Legislature and the executive, and assumed to itself the power of legislating. That's wrong.

      This is the description of a seminar I am registering to take next fall entitled  Constitutional Design .  This same professor taught a seminar last fall on the constitutional problem of secession that I would have been very interested to take, had my schedule allowed.  Happily he incorporates secession into this class.  Though this prof. is fairly liberal, he is very thoughtful and measured in his observations and recommendations.  (BTW, I had him for my Con Law I class.)    I am going to think of this class as a  mini constitutional convention .  Although it is not every day one gets to write a constitution (much less write one anyone will actually pay attention to), Iraq will soon get a new constitution, the EU is fighting over its constitution, and Texas could use a new constitution to replace the awkward reconstruction-era one it has now.  Accordingly, this is actually a study in current events.   Course Description:   This seminar will look at various issues that arise when one tries to design a constitution from scratch (rather than interpret one that is already in being). One might begin with the question of  who gets to design a constitution in the first place , and with what legitimacy. And  how is the handiwork of the constitutional designers turned into a "real" constitution, i.e., accepted as the basic framework ? This raises the question of ratification procedures. Of course most of the attention will be focused on classic issues, most of them structural: What should the election system look like, and why? Parliamentary or presidential system?   What should the judiciary look like [currently very important!]  (e.g., life tenure, appointment process, control over docket, etc.)?  Under what circumstances is  federalism  a desirable constitutional system , with what ramifications? (E.g., should the constitution mention the possibility of secession?) Should there be an explicit "Bill of Rights" and, if so, what form should it take? Should a constitution include "positive" welfare rights? Should a constitution countenance its own "suspension" during a time of emergency? We will look at a variety of constitutions from around the world, including the newly drafted Iraqi constitution, as well as political science and law review literature relevant to the issues raised. [emphasis added] So, if I find that I have squandered my legal education on a buch of pie-in-the-sky theory courses and can't find a real job, at least when selling the product of my  urlLink fine liberal arts education , I'll always be able to respond:  "Do you want a constitution with that?"

      Here is the Hatch alternative to the currently popular Allard/Musgrave FMA: "Civil marriage shall be defined in each state by the legislature or the citizens thereof. Nothing in this constitution shall be construed to require that marriage or its benefits be extended to any other union than that of a man and a woman."   This language will most certainly be the alternative that most Dems and squeamish Reps will turn to.  While I like the idea of federalism and state sovereignty on issues that pertain to the family, I also believe the Union was conceived in the first place in order to achieve a degree of uniformity on issues where divergence among the fifty states' laws would work more ill than good.  Imagine the effect of 50 differing definitions of marriage in our highly mobile society.  Those that are married would be discouraged from relocating to other locales for fear their marriage would not receive legal protection, and those couples considering marriage could choose to forgo marriage altogether.  Also, the ill effects of further diluting the fundamental unit of society, the family, would certainly not be confined to those states that choose to recognize same-sex marriage; the impact would be nation-wide.  If any law is deserving of national uniformity, this is it.  (I note that though presently all states do define their own marriages, the overall definition is uniform.  What we are facing is a vast incongruence in the definition, the like of which we have not seen since the days of the southern bans on interracial marriage.)  I favor the Allard/Musgrave FMA as a way to achieve uniformity on an issue where I believe uniformity--and especially uniformity in accordance with what is best for society--is necessary.  To me, gays don't want recognition of same-sex marriage so they can show their partner how much they love them, or whatever.  No, they just want popular approval for their sinful lifestyle.  I don't think we should give it to them.  If you still aren't sure why law should only recognize the traditional definition of marriage, see Prof. J. Budziszewski  urlLink here .

      Ryan Zempel on today's Townhall  urlLink C-Log :   Last night I happened to watch the rather bizarre movie  The Shipping News  and was shocked to discover Hollywood addressing one of the true causes of homosexuality.  In a major subplot of the movie, we discover that a character named Agnis (played by Judi Dench) was raped by her brother when she was 12 years old and is now a lesbian rather hostile towards men. I applaud whoever it was in Hollywood who dared to make the politically incorrect implication that her (admittedly affirmed) homosexuality was the result of the sexual abuse.  If only people would pay attention.  When will liberals quit clinging to the "it's genetic" claim and acknowledge the fact that much of homosexuality (especially lesbianism) is the result of sexual abuse? And when will conservatives ingest this fact and begin responding to homosexuals with compassion rather than condemnation?

(images available  urlLink here  and  urlLink here )  Recent visitors say that they are impressed by the immensity of the memorial, which I am happy to hear. The memorial should instill some sense of the grandeur of the sacrifice given by so many Americans as well as WWII's impact on the development of our national identity.  If you know a WWII veteran, ask them about their service and sacrifice, and tell them Thank You!

      NYT columnist  urlLink Nick Kristof  (subscription) comments on liberal and media bias and bigotry aimed at conservative Christians.  I appreciate Kristof's effort, though his ignorance of Christianity, and apparent lack of effort to verify some of his information, seems to partly explain the problem; people are often hostile to things they know little or nothing about.   A couple of problems:     " there's no clear objection in the Bible to lesbianism "  -- Uh-uh.  urlLink Romans 1:26 .  Important to note that gay and lesbian activity is listed right along side lots of other sins indicative of we who "worship and serve the creature rather than the Creator" (Rom 1:25).  This list includes such zingers as greed, envy, arrogance, gossiping, and disobedience to parents, to name a few.     " And in polite society, conservative Christians -- especially Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses -- are among the last groups it's still acceptable to mock. "  -- Well, getting warmer, that is if LDS and JWs  really were  Christians. There are a few fundamental differences between LDS/JWs and Christians, namely the nature of God, the nature of man, and the relation between the two.  Doesn't a man like this at least have an editor or someone who knows the difference?  Sadly, probably not.     " But there's no clear objection in the Bible to lesbianism at all. And since some fundamentalists have argued that AIDS is God's punishment for gay men, it's worth noting that lesbians are at less risk of AIDS than straight women. So if God is smiting gay men for their sin, is he rewarding lesbians for their holiness? "  -- interesting argument, if this is really what most Christians believe.  To be fair, many do.    On the other hand:     Liberals often protest that they would have nothing against conservative Christians if they were not led by hypocritical blowhards who try to impose their Ten Commandments plaques, sexual mores and creationism on society. But that's a crude stereotype, and it ignores the Christian right's accomplishments. Polls show that evangelical Christians are more likely to contribute to charities that help the needy, and in horror spots in Africa Catholics and other Christians are the bulwark of the health care system.  Good. And: It's always easy to point out the intolerance of others. What's harder is to practice inclusiveness oneself. And bigotry toward people based on their faith is just as repugnant as bigotry toward people based on their sexuality. Right on both counts.

      Ralph Nader spoke at the law school  urlLink yesterday , and, of course, I was there to lend support.  He was in town organizing folks to collect signatures to get his name on the Texas ballot.  Nader's speech focused on condemning corporations.  Specifically he criticized law schools for their focus on corporate law and lack of concern for public interest law and issues.  Mostly your typical Marxist-Socialist rodomontade;   Corporations bad, universal healthcare good.  Nader is certainly not troubled by the prospect of drawing votes from Kerry.  He sees politics, as he sees life, as a fight between the corporations and the people.  In his view, both Rs and Ds are in the pockets of the unaccountable corporations and will remain so as long as corporations are allowed to fund campaigns.  Essentially, there is no significant difference between Republicans and Democrats so he cares little if he helps Bush to win.  In this view, Nader has much in common with the libertarians, who, by the way, were also present, asking folks to sign a petition to get their candidate on the ballot (whoever their candidate is).     Interestingly, this is the second time since declaring his candidacy that Nader has spoken at UT.  I guess since his goal is to get the highest percentage of nationwide votes he can (and therefore receive federal money the next time around) he is focusing on getting on the ballots in the biggest states Bush will certainly win. No matter how many votes Nader draws from Kerry, Bush will win all of Texas' electors.  Nader's is a good strategy if your goal is to win 5% of the popular vote and not the overall election. (BTW, over 10% of Austin voters voted for Nader in the 2000 election.)  Nader received this week's   Federalist  "Alpha Jackass" Award  for this quote:   "We are dealing here with a basically unstable president. ... We are dealing with a messianic militarist. A messianic militarist, under our constitutional structure, is an unstable officeholder. Talk about separation of church and state: It is not separated at all in Bush's brain, and this is extremely disturbing."   --Ralph Nader, responding to Bush's statement in Bob Woodward's book that he prayed "for the strength to do the Lord's will" when committing the nation to go to war in Iraq.

      Exams are over, but work continues.  We've got to get the spring issue of the  Review  to press by the end of the week, and the staff has been working overtime.  I don't mind the work, but I haven't been able to relax yet.  I think I'll spend next week visiting folks around the state before getting back to work in June.    It is nice, however, to have evenings free again.  There's a great new reality show on PBS called  Colonial House .  It puts a bunch of 21st century Americans and Brits in a scenario reminiscent of the first Puritans at Plymouth.  The folks have to live off of supplies like those the colonists would have had while trying to make the colony profitable for its investors by producing a crop of maize (blue indian corn, I think).  It's really a terrific show. You can see the last episodes next Monday and Tuesday night, check local listings.    Yesterday evening I celebrated the end of finals by making a visit to my favorite book store.  I usually only come away with a book or a magazine (I buy most of my books online), but I love to browse the shelves of the history, biography, and fiction sections.  Last night was an exceptionally good night for new finds.   Joining in on the recent flood of biographies on the Founders, Ron Chernow has a new one out on Alexander Hamilton, faithfully styled,  urlLink Alexander Hamilton .  David Hackett Fischer of Albion's Seed fame has a new one on  urlLink Washington's Crossing  the Delaware.  Martin Gilbert has added  urlLink D-Day  to his list of WWII works.   Another Colonial tale in Russell Shorto's  urlLink Island at the Center of the World , on Dutch Manhattan.  Plenty of good summer reading.    Presently, I'm working on Joseph Ellis's  American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas Jefferson , with  Freedom and Virtue , an ISI anthology of the 19th century's libertarian/conservative debate, on deck.  Patrick O'Brien's  Master and Commander  is in the hole.   Needless to say, I am very pleased that summer is here!

      FRC's Tony Perkins: [W]hen you mix young people who grew up on a steady diet of MTV and pornography with a prison environment, you get the abuse at Abu Ghraib. America is in a perilous situation. In the eyes of these Muslims we are the enemy because we are Christian, but in many areas of our culture, our conduct as a nation is anything but Christian. The Greek and Roman philosophers knew it; the Founders knew it; Reagan knew it; most of you know it:  America will be great as long as it is good.  Should America ever cease to be good, it will cease to be great.    That day, sadly, is upon us.  (Note: Though a version of the above statement is attributed to Alexis de Tocqueville, it is not actually found in  Democracy in America  and his authorship is suspect.  This does diminish the statement's truth.)

Well, being the ignorant but eager student of humanity that I am, I went in search of Mr. Kohlberg and found this in a  urlLink blog post  by  urlLink Marvin Olasky  (EIC of the Christian news magazine   urlLink World   and a journalism prof at Texas):  Some WORLD readers may be familiar with the work of Lawrence Kohlberg, who became famous for proclaiming ethical stages through which he thought people should move: from following the law to "social duty" and perhaps to "autonomous ethical thinking," wherein a person makes up his own principles. Kohlberg argued that such ethical autonomy should be the goal of human existence-even though in this stage humans are in some ways the most selfish, virtually inventing a world, totally apart from God.   I'd propose instead of Kohlberg's six or seven stages just three. First comes the glory stage, the I'm-the-center-of-the-world thinking within which we attempt to glorify ourselves. Next comes the glory, glory stage, when we strive to promote not only ourselves but a collective entity as well: perhaps a nation, perhaps a business, perhaps Communism. Our goal, however, should be to move by grace to the highest stage, where we act to bring glory, glory, glory to Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. (And in the course of glorifying God we may bring honor to ourselves and to our nation or business.) Education, the path from cocky ignorance to miserable uncertainty, indeed!

      Typically, the talk at this point in an election cycle surrounds the Challenger's (Kerry's) pick for VP.  This time around, however, it appears the Bush ticket could steal a little of Kerry's thunder with talk about replacing Cheney's spot on the ticket.  Cheney is seen more and more as a liability rather than an asset, what with Haliburton, Cheney's support for the now disgraced Chalabi, and his overall role in the war in Iraq.  Another consideration is 2008.  Cheney will probably not be a contender to replace Bush and selecting a new runningmate would help insure a contest when Hillary makes her move.  So, who to replace Cheney?  The top choices are probably Rudy Giuliani, John McCain, and George Pataki, and in that order.  None of these men are true Republicans, and to choose one of them would signal the end of the Reagan Era of the Republican party.  Nevertheless, their name recognition and, for Pataki and Giuliani, the potential to put NY in play, make them hard to pass up.   urlLink James Gannon  posits that former Sen. John Danforth might be a good choice.  I have no preference.  I like Cheney but think the war on terror can only succeed if Bush stays in office.  I am willing to sacrifice Cheney (and take a squishy Giuliani) if  it means victory in 2004, and perhaps a challenger to Hillary in 2008.  Who could have imagined it; a Texas-New York team would be unstoppable!    As for Cheney, Gannon suggests Bush is too loyal to remove Cheney in a unilateral preemptive strike, so to speak.  Cheney must be willing to give up his position on his own.  Cheney for CIA Director?

      Though work,  Review , and family duties have not afforded as much time to read as I had hoped, I finally finished   urlLink Sphinx  .  I'm not sure what's next.  I bought Karen Hughes's memoir,  Ten Minutes from Normal , as well as the new Hamilton book.  I've got a couple of others I've had for a while, including Hayward's  Age of Reagan , and I'm torn over where to go next.  While I try to decide, I think I'll read C.S. Lewis's  Problem of Pain .  Good, quick read, but always worth coming back to.  I guess I'll go on to Hughes, unless it turns out to be a dud.  I'll let you know.  Joseph Ellis's   American Sphinx: The character of Thomas Jefferson   was very well done.  Ellis had established himself with me as a lucid and entertaining writer in  Founding Brothers  (published after  Sphinx ) and does not disappoint in his biography of the best-known of the founding fathers--other than Washington and, if you are a Jay-Walking All Star, Abe Lincoln.  Ellis's primary subjects are TJ's abilities to hold several seemingly contradictory beliefs at once, and to profess very strong ideals while often violating those ideals when confronted with reality.  Jefferson was a master at self-deception, a trait that, when mixed with his very strong "republican" or limited government beliefs, make him, I think, the quintessential Libertarian.  Though every party claims Jefferson as their own (after all, FDR built the Jefferson Memorial as the Democrat counter-weight to the Republican Lincoln Memorial), his multi-faceted personality and often self-contradictory beliefs provide a little for everyone, making him an ideal addition to the American Pantheon, and a subject worthy of Ellis's skill.

      Scientists working independently in Boulder, CO, and Innsbruk, Austria, have successfully  teleported an atom , reports  urlLink NYT .  Though they are far from being able to teleport large objects, such as away-teams or exploding anti-matter, they hope the technology will be helpful in developing computers capable of processing many complex problems at once rather than having to calculate each possibility separately.  Here's how they say atom teleporting works:  First, atoms B and C were brought together, making them "entangled" and creating an invisible link between the two atoms no matter how far apart they were. Atom C was moved away. Next, A and B were similarly entangled.  Then the scientists measured the energy states of A and B, essentially opening the boxes to see whether each contained a 1 or a zero. Because B had been entangled with C, opening A and B created an instant change in atom C, what Albert Einstein called "spooky action at a distance," and this, in essence, set a combination lock on atom C, with the data in A and B serving as the combination.  For the final step, the combination was sent and a pulse of laser light was applied to atom C, almost magically turning it into a replica of the original A. Atom A was teleported to atom C. Hehe.. "spooky action at a distance."

      I just saw a free screening of the new quasi-independent release,   Napoleon Dynamite  .  The show connected with and brought back many memories from a unique part of my adolescence; it took me back to my four years in Colorado.  From 1988-1992 I lived in Southern Colorado's San Luis Valley, a 60-mile wide valley home to the headwaters of the Rio Grande, numerous potato farms, the Great Sand Dunes National Monument, and the surrounding Sangre de Cristo and San Juan mountain ranges.  I lived in Colorado from my 4th through 7th grades, right at the height of Trapper-Keepers, Casio watches, and various 80's bands.  I rode the bus to school.  I wore space-shoe-looking snow boots.  I rode my bike everywhere.  My closest friend was an outcast from south of the border (Texas).  I had crushes on girls who thought I was a geek.  I was a geek, and I did not fit in.  Oh, and I loved Ninjas.  All of the above describe the life of Napoleon Dynamite, a social misfit living in rural Idaho with his Grandma and 30-year-old unemployed brother.  NApoleon struggles for accepptance, makes some new friends, and relives the late 80s/early 90s lingo perfectly ("You guys are retarded!").  Granted, my life was not exactly like Napoleon's, but it was eerily similar, and I can't help but think that if it hadn't been for a fortuitous return to Texas for my 8th grade and high school years, I very well could have turned out just like Napoleon.  Well, maybe I did, but I'll leave that for you to decide.    There is a lot in Napoleon Dynamite for us Gen-Xers to identify with. (Mostly the Casio wrist watch and the ninjas).  See the movie.  It's funny, it will make you feel good, and it will take you back a few years.   Napoleon Dynamite  is probably coming to a theater near you very soon.  (Check the  urlLink web site  for a list of free screening locations).

      Blandus Rex asked, after my last post on Leviitcus and Jeremiah,   "[Do] Christians (true decendants of Abraham) [have a responsibility] to fear God's judgement on their lands if they do not strive to obey His (at least Moral/Ethical) law?" or "Is there some scripture honoring belief by Christians that could say, "Hey look at how serious God was about these kinds of things for the people-group He had a special relationship with. If He was that serious with his chosen people, how much more serious will He be on 'all the nations?' America had better repent!"   I see this as two questions, requiring two answers.  Christians do claim to be the spiritual heirs of ancient Israel, thus whatever God said to the ancient Israelites is certainly applicable to modern Christians, though modified by the New Testament covenant and by the modern situation (the fact that, as I pointed out earlier, there is no covenantal relationship between God and country anymore).  Certainly God's dealings with ancient Israel are instructive in understanding God.  Knowing how He reacts to those who hold His laws in contempt should make Christians that much more careful and serious about their commitment to the cause of Christ.  For the relationship between modern nations like America and God, however, I think the parallel is not to ancient Israel but to the ancient pagan lands around Israel.  What is important is not that Moab, Philistia, Edom, etc. were pagan, but that they were nations which God had not made a specific covenant with.  God did judge each of these nations, just as He did Israel and Judah, but not on the same standard.  If I recall my minor prophets correctly, He condemned Moab not so much for worshipping Molech, but for worshipping Molech with infant sacrifice.  The other scripture which is instructive on this point to me is God's comment to Abraham, that He would give Canaan to Abraham's descendants, but not yet, because the iniquity of the Ammonite was not yet complete.  I read that to mean that God did hold the Ammonites to a standard, but not to a covenantal standard.  I think He judged the Ammonites on the standard of Romans 1: natural law, the things that everyone naturally knows is right and wrong.  The Ammonites were wicked, to be sure, but it would require 400 more years before God was ready to destroy them.  So, yes, God does judge nations.  Christians can work to influence their fellow citizens to act in ways that don't antagonize God.  And certainly, Christians can draw lessons from God's dealings with ancient people, including the Israelites.  However, I think Christians have two loyalties.  The first is to God, and thus the first and most important question to a Christian is: God was serious with His chosen people in ancient times---am I being serious before Him?  The second loyalty is to their country.  I care deeply about my country, very very deeply.  But on another level, it's only a temporary thing.  I'll be here for at most another 60 or 70 years, and it isn't likely that anything I do will greatly influence my people one way or another.  When I'm dead, America will continue on, although hopefully I'll have done more good than harm.  Given that, though, what I do for God is much more important than what I do, or even worry about, for America.

      Several years ago, Phil came home from his introductory economics class and told me that he now knew that voting did not matter.  I blinked: was he serious?  He explained that, given the millions of votes cast, no one individual vote matters.  I later took the same class myself, and had to admit the point made sense.  But I’ve never been entirely comfortable with it, and I don’t think it’s merely because I want to believe that my vote matters, although I do.  My suspicion is that the answer is both no and yes.  Anytime there are at least three voters involved, two of those votes won’t matter.  The only vote that matters is the third vote, the one that breaks the tie.  The other two voters, especially if they always oppose each other, might as well not bother voting at all, and give up their voting power to the third party, since it is that party which always decides things anyway.  Thereafter, the third party, now the only voter, decides everything, and can even do things the other two don’t want to do.  So, the other two votes do matter, acting as an invisible check on the tiebreaker.  Let’s try another example.  Suppose Tom is a pilot in the RAF in World War II, during the Blitz.  There are hundreds of German bombers flying to attack Britain: it does not matter how many he shoots down, most of them will get through.  At most, if he is extremely good and extremely lucky, he might shoot down three or four bombers.  It is not in his individual best interest to fly the missions.  He has a good chance of getting shot down himself, or killed; he will not stop the bombers, and he will not save his hometown, or any other British town, from being bombed.  His vote does not matter.  If all the pilots follow this logic, none of them will fly, the Luftwaffe will destroy the RAF, the Wehrmacht will invade England, and all of the pilots will be sent to Stalag Luft 3.  So, it is not in their self-interest for no one to fly.  Actually, the best outcome for any RAF pilot is that he himself not fly, but everyone else does.  If everyone understands this, it would lead to the absurd situation of every pilot encouraging every other pilot to fly, while excusing himself (this is where the sergeant says, “Enough B.S. boys, time to turn in.  Anyone not on the flight line at 5am will be on latrine duty for a week!).  The individual actions do not matter, but the aggregate actions do matter, making the individual actions matter.  Or does it?  Much more to follow, but please contribute comments.  I’m working this out as I go…

      Apologies to any loyal readers we Toyahites may have: I haven't got much to say tonight.  I'm working on an essay on third parties, and on Christians and voting, but neither can be written off-hand.       So you'll have to make do with some thoughts on Sandy Berger.  He was President Clinton's National Security Advisor and is (was, he just resigned today) a top advisor on the Kerry campaign: he is  urlLink currently under investigation  for removing classified documents from the National Archives.    According to Berger, he inadvertently removed the documents and then inadvertently destroyed them.  An honest mistake, that's all.  Sorry.    I don't see how he expects us, the American public, to buy that, let alone the FBI.  He was a National Security Advisor for at least four years (was he there all eight years?).  There is no way he did not know the rules about handling sensitive information, and I simply cannot imagine that someone who had been in his position of responsibility would become so sloppy and careless to accidentally remove secret papers and then accidentally dispose of them.  It's possible, to be sure.  But it so stretches the realm of credibility that I find it an extremely dubious story, though I suppose it's a better defense than saying he removed them on purpose.  I'd like to give him the benefit of the doubt, but I'm finding it hard to believe.

      If you’ve ever been around Christians---of any stripe---much, as I have, then you’ve probably heard your fair share of doom-and-gloom predictions.  They generally follow the pattern of “God disapproves of X, America participates/tolerates/approves of X, therefore God’s wrath is sure to fall upon us.”  Abortion, gay rights and/or marriage, divorce, and immorality in general are favorite topics.  I hear these sorts of comments especially when studying a book like Jeremiah, which is after all full of those kinds of prophecies.  However, now that I’ve recognized the parallels between Jeremiah and Lamentations---parallels that I don’t think are accidental---I’m reconsidering whether the doom-and-gloom predictions by Christians are warranted.  To be sure, God does  disapprove  of homosexuality, divorce, immorality, and the killing of the unborn.  But it’s not logically valid to apply the same lessons from Israelite history to American history, though perhaps the principles still apply.  God made a specific covenant with the Israelites, a large part of which is set out in Leviticus.  He promised them that He would do certain things for them, such as bless them and protect them from their enemies, if they would do certain things for Him, such as keep His commandments.  He further promised that, if they did not, certain consequences would follow, becoming progressively more severe the less they repented.  The prophets are documentation that the promises of Leviticus came true, pretty much exactly as God had promised.  By the end of Jeremiah, only a very small, poor, desperate band of people were left in Canaan, the promised land.  All the rest had been killed or dragged off to Babylon.  By contrast, there is no such covenant between God and America.  It is true that most of the founders of America were Christian, but I’m not sure that fact, in itself, is any more significant than that they were also mostly of British stock.  From both traditions---Christian and British---they drew inspirations for designing their new nation-state.  But there is certainly no covenant relationship between God and Americans, as there was between God and the Israelites.    In my opinion, that means that the usual doom-and-gloom predictions by Christians are a bit off base.  It may well be that approval of homosexuality is a bad thing for this country, or any other country, and that approval will lead to bad consequences.  But we Christians must be careful and judicious in our use of the scripture, and not make it fit where it doesn’t fit.  There are plenty of reasons to oppose homosexuality, divorce, immorality, and the killing of the unborn, but claiming that God’s judgment will fall on us as it did the ancient Israelites is putting words in God’s mouth.

      Way back at the beginning of the year, I was challenged to read the Bible through. That's something I've done before, but not in a while. So I took up the challenge, the plan being to alternate books between the Old and New Testaments. I've often pondered why God arranged the beginning of the Bible as He did...one interesting book (Genesis) followed by about four of the most boring books in the entire Bible. Surely more than a few interested people have given up Bible-reading in despair, caught in the biblical Valley of Death?    I just finished Leviticus, which in my opinion is the most boring of all the boring Bible books. However, the reading was not without benefit. I've also been studying Jeremiah on Sunday mornings, and I happened on some intriguing connections between them.    Leviticus is the third book of the Pentateuch, and sets out most of the Law for the Israelites. Most of its chapters deal with ceremonial rituals and laws of personal relationship, along with health and sanitary rules, rules of warfare, and so on. For instance, the conditions for leprosy are spelled out exactly in Leviticus 13. If a man finds a bright white spot on his body, he must show it to the priest. If the hair has turned white and the mark appears deeper than the skin, it is leprosy, but if it appears otherwise, the priest shall isolate the man for up to 14 days, after which if the mark doesn't fit the definition of leprosy, the man shall be declared clean. If there is a boil on the skin, and the boil is white or reddish-white, the priest shall look at it...     It must've been exciting, to be a priest back in the old days. That is not, however, my point. At the end of Leviticus, in chapter 26, God tells them what will happen if they disobey Him and do not repent. Among other things, He promises that enemies will attack them and they will not be able to defend themselves. He promises that food will be short, and that indeed they will be forced to cannibalism of their own children. He assures them that, should they yet be unrepentant, He will scatter them abroad, and make their land desolate.     Now, to Jeremiah. Jeremiah was written a good many centuries after the giving of the Law. By the time the prophet Jeremiah wrote his book, Israel had been a nation for several hundred years, had split into two, and had (both parts) sunk deep into idolatry, with only ocassional lip-service to Yahweh God. And so God sent Jeremiah, along with many other prophets, to warn them to repent. Although by the time that Jeremiah was speaking, the chance for repentance had passed. He promised his listeners that the promises of God from Leviticus were about to come true.    What struck me, reading Leviticus, was how closely the pre-Exilic and Exilic writings parallel what Leviticus promised, among them Jeremiah. God promised that the people---as a nation---would be destroyed, and they were. He said they'd be scattered among the nations, and they were. He said the land would enjoy its sabbath rest (they were supposed to let the fields rest every seven years, which they never did), and it did (because there was no one, or few people, left to farm it). God made specific promises of what would happen, conditional on other things happening (the Israelites' constant, unrepenting sin), and those things did in fact happen.    I'm trying to avoid posting very long entries, a common occurrence given that I am somewhat long-winded. So I shall post part two of this tomorrow, which is a consideration of the parallels, if any, between ancient Israel and America.

      The hardest thing for me about the election this year is keeping my perspective.  As a friend of mine said the other day, the amount of venom in political circles is astonishing, and tends to make me want to give up.  Someone I know wrote out a list of all the terrible decisions that President Bush had made, and concluded, "F*** you Bush!!!!!!!" in bold red letters, three times larger than the rest of the text.  Not all of the left is crazy, and not all of the left wants to f*** Bush, but enough of it seems to have taken leave of it's senses that I tend to tune them out.  The problem is not limited to the left: there's more than a few on the far right who despise Bush almost as violently as the Michael Moore left.  They list every economic mistake that the Bush Administration has made (the tariffs are popular for this), combine it with a shrill denunciation of the invasion of Iraq, and conclude that Bush is a liar in every sense of the word, who can't be trusted to tell the truth even about the weather.  Ad hominem and non-sequiter attacks abound, from both the left and the right.  A libertarian article yesterday accused Bush of vacillating, finger-in-the-wind politics ("worse than Clinton"), and offered as proof the handling of the Iraq war.  I blinked: here I thought Bush had gone to war in the face of determined UN opposition and without overwhelming American support.  Apparently he forgot to lick his finger that day, or something.  I'm a long way from a true-blue, cheering Bush supporter.  He did disappoint me with a lot of his domestic policies.  I'm not sure what to think about Iraq: I would like to believe that America's leaders made the best decision they could, based on what they knew at the time, and I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt: necessarily incomplete information  will  sometimes lead to bad decisions.  It is also possible that the president and his people exaggerated their case in an effort to get support.  But I'm not allowed to be in the middle of the road (as a very wise man said, you tend to get squished there).  The nutty leftists and the shrill right-wingers are both driving me to support President Bush.  I want to carefully critique his statements versus his actions, do the same with Kerry, and decide which one is more trustworthy and more likely to make good decisions, and then vote accordingly.  The struggle for me is to maintain my sanity in the meantime, and not get caught up in the chaff which is obscuring the radar.  I'm tired of this election, and it's only July!

      hello guys  i went back to columbia for one of my famous four day weekends and didn't check my e-mail.  so today instead of replying to the e-mails I will just join the fray this way.  Today's rant...part one:  people should have to take some sort of test to prove they are not idiots before they can have bank accounts...part two:  the idea that kerry is electable is ludacris (ridicu LOUS) *that was for kehr*  but morons keep talking about it like it's a viable option.  booo!!!  *that was for o'toole*  if 37% of americans vote for the idiot michael moore should be shot  *that was for jim*  sorry to the texans, i really don't have any special thoughts for y'all.  dallas

      Follow up to Phil's post about the liberal media:   "On Inside Washington, a weekend discussion show taped at and run by the Gannett-owned CBS affiliate in Washington, DC, WUSA-TV, and carried by many PBS stations across the country, [Evan] Thomas pointed out the boost to the Kerry/Edwards ticket provided by the press corps:  There’s one other base here: the media. Let’s talk a little media bias here. The media, I think, wants Kerry to win. And I think they’re going to portray Kerry and Edwards -- I’m talking about the establishment media, not Fox, but -- they’re going to portray Kerry and Edwards as being young and dynamic and optimistic and all, there’s going to be this glow about them that some, is going to be worth, collectively, the two of them, that’s going to be worth maybe 15 points."   Evan Thomas is the Assistant Managing Editor of Newsweek.   urlLink More.   I don't think all the media is liberal, or that it is consistently liberal all the time, or that every reporter is liberal, or that the general media is so liberal that nothing said by the media can be believed.  Nevertheless, this is interesting.

      I really appreciate you guys hosting this forum.  It really reminds me of a high tech version of Benjamin Franklin's Junto.  I'm sure we would make them proud!    "I should have mentioned before, that, in the autumn of the preceding year, [1727] I had formed most of my ingenious acquaintance into a club of mutual improvement, which we called the JUNTO; we met on Friday evenings. The rules that I drew up required that every member, in his turn, should produce one or more queries on any point of Morals, Politics, or Natural Philosophy [physics], to be discuss'd by the company; and once in three months produce and read an essay of his own writing, on any subject he pleased. Our debates were to be under the direction of a president, and to be conducted in the sincere spirit of inquiry after truth, without fondness for dispute or desire of victory; and to prevent warmth, all expressions of positiveness in opinions, or direct contradiction, were after some time made contraband, and prohibited under small pecuniary penalties." - Benjamin Franklin

      CNN Headline:   urlLink Political fund-raiser faces prostitution charge .  Where's the bias?  I had to read down into the 13th paragraph before finding out  who  the pimp had raised funds for: Hillary Clinton, Joeseph Liberman, and yes,  John Kerry .  If the guy had been raising funds for a Republican candidate, the headline would have read: "Bush refuses to comment on fundraiser-orgy" or "Cheney blocks probe into alleged sex-ring fundraising."

      Well I want to thank Phil for hosting this joint effort on his website.  I hope to make some useful contributions, but I promise to post a few worthless words as well.  Hopefully I'll be able to adapt to the new format without too many SNAFU's.  I like the plug for mathematics up there on the headliner.  Once the Big D joins the fun, you can add laziness.     Lately I have been listening to a lot more talk radio.  Whether the topic is sports or politics, the switch on my receiver has been lodged in the little used AM position.  I guess that I am getting fed up with hearing  Slow Ride  and  Black Dog  all the time on my classic rock stations.  One can only listen to those same tunes so many times.  Talk radio offers something fresh every day, and helps to keep me awake while I'm driving to and from Birmingham (where I teach my calculus course).  Here is a brief list of programs that I have been tuning in to.     urlLink Jim Rome , 1-3PM.  Rome is a nationally syndicated show that runs from 9:00AM-12:00PM PST.  My local station only carries the last two hours.  Rome is fun to listen to as he'll work in other aspects besides sports into his show.  The best parts of the show are when he is off on some soliloquy about an issue or certain e-mails that fans have sent.      urlLink Bill "Huge" Simonson , 3-6PM.  Huge is a Michigan sports guy whose show operates out of Grand Rapids.  He has about seven affiliates across the state, and his popularity is growing.  He also works current events well into his show, and he is pretty conservative.  Huge tells it like he sees it.     urlLink Rush Limbaugh , 12-3PM.  Y'all know who Rush is and what he's about.     urlLink Michael Medved , ???.  I discovered Michael Medved on the way to teach in Birmingham.  One day I was falling asleep at the wheel, and I found his show while scanning the AM band.  Medved, a hard line conservative, mainly gets callers who disagree with him, and he takes on their questions.  He usually has really good rebutal to anything thrown his way.  The debate always wakes me up and makes sure I live to see the next day.  He's a real life saver.  That's all that I really listen to.  Sometimes I catch Sean Hannity, but not too often.  I also will listen to this liberal Italian guy on Detroit radio every once in a while to hear what liberal radio sounds like.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.  I always enjoy a good radio show.  Please, no suggestions for NPR.  I already get enough goading for that from my buddy from Germany.    Good to be on board here.

      I have a couple of blog-length (that is, relatively short) essays brewing in my head that I'll post soon, but I think I'll just make this an introduction post.  Many thanks to Phil for sharing his blog with Matt and I!  First, (note the absence of "firstly": someone who knows who she is spent a lot of time coaching me on the irrelevance of the "ly") my name is Anthony Williams.  I am a 2002 graduate of Hillsdale College, majoring in history and minoring in German.  My history specialty is the early American republic and constitutional issues.  The rest of my interests range from Harry Potter to Russia to the ancients, to system administration, networking, gaming, and in my spare time, woodcarving.    I had, and still do have, my own personal blog, as linked up there in the right-hand column.  For reasons that are of little interest, I had to secure my Livejournal, as Phil said.  But I still enjoy thinking about political things, writing my thoughts out, and posting them for public review.  So, I suggested to Phil and Matt that we collaborate on a group blog; all were amenable, and the easiest solution was to modify Toyah into a multi-author blog.  Besides, Phil already had a cool name, one that wasn't likely to be taken by anyone else.  It was big news last week when John Kerry chose John Edwards to be his running mate.  Well, actually, it was kind-of-big-news.  I admit I was surprised a little: I didn't think Kerry would pick someone so unlike himself, someone who could easily end up overshadowing him (I refuse to make lame jokes about their respective heights).  My impression of Kerry is a weak man; not a bad man, but one who is easily controlled by stronger characters.  He is credited with some courageous actions in Vietnam, to be sure, but we need someone who is strong and courageous now, not who was strong and courageous in 1968.  And his recent record does not impress me as a courageous or strong record.  Furthermore, to be blunt, John Kerry is boring.  He doesn't have a charismatic voice or tone of speaking, and doesn't frequently smile (but, to give him his due, he does have a nice smile when he does).  So, by contrast to John Edwards, he's quite gray, while Edwards is colorful.  I haven't personally heard Edwards speak, but I hear he does well, and he certainly sounds cheerful, and likes to smile.  Presidents aren't elected on their smile alone, or so we hope, but a successful candidate has to be able to connect to the people.  I think the Kerry campaign is hoping that Edwards will be able to help Kerry out in that regard.  It may work, but I don't think it'll matter.  I don't ever recall voting for a vice-president myself, nor ever speaking with someone who had.  People always vote for the man at the top of the ticket.    I wonder though, if this is good for John Edwards?  Does anyone remember Dukasis' running mate?  Where is Dan Quayle, today?  Who ran with Bob Dole?  Could Al Gore get elected in Tennessee today, I wonder?  If the challenger doesn't get elected, the vice president candidate is forgotten even more than the challenger is.  That might be good: maybe Dukasis' VP was able to resume his own political career (though, I'm guessing it hasn't been very spectacular).  But if anything "bad" emerges during the campaign, the VP will be stained too, if not as badly as the president-candidate himself.  Likewise, even if the president-candidate is elected, the VP must run, later, with the shadow of the President over him, a problem that Al Gore had in 2000.  Of course, if the President is popular, the VP could ride into office on his coattails, as George Bush the first did.  But it seems to me that, politically, it's rather dangerous to run for Vice-President.  If I were John Edwards, I'd have declined.

      Toyah will now be a joint venture comprised of former Highlanders Matt O'Toole, Anthony Williams, and myself.  Anthony will maintain his livejournal (friends only) blog and Matt his Trash Talk for private purposes, but we will use Toyah to discuss politics, current events, and whatever else we're moved to share.   My old posts will remain on the blog, unless I can find something else to do with them.  We're in consultation with J-Rock, Higgin-booty, and big-D, also former highlanders, about joining as well.  Good things to come...   urlLink

       A secular world that ratifies homosexual marriage would provide a legal foundation that would open the floodgates to civil litigation against religious leaders, institutions and worshipers. In such an environment, churches might be sued for declining to provide their sanctuaries for gay marriages, for example. Ministers could be sued for hate speech for giving a sermon on moral behavior. Churches that protest homosexual unions could face revocation of their tax exemption status. The delicate balance between church and state . . . is teetering on a high ledge at this moment. It's ironic that those who oppose churches' involvement in state concerns nonetheless have no compunction when it comes to the state dictating what churches can do. Even nonreligious folk should be concerned. Either we believe in separation of church and state or we don't, but you can't have it both ways. The July 12 debate is really a discussion about 'cloture' -- the process by which the Senate puts a time limit on filibuster, thereby allowing a bill to be voted on. In this case, 60 senators have to vote in favor of cloture for the Federal Marriage Amendment, defining marriage as between one man and one woman, to go to the floor for a full vote. Many senators prefer to delay voting rather than make their position public before the November election. But advocates for the amendment predict that November may be too late, that if President George W. Bush loses re-election, the amendment will be dead and marriage as we know it will be history.  --Kathleen Parker

      Here at Toyah Creek, we consider it our mission to discover ways to end world hunger, save the whales, and make life better for all mankind.  Well, as you know, we have already solved world hunger (private property, free-enterprise system) and saved the whales (private property, free-enterprise system, and Standard Oil).  But we have been unsuccessful at making life better for all mankind.  That is, until now.  The answer?   urlLink AddictingGames.com .

      There's a pretty cool dramatic reading of the Declaration of Independence available  urlLink here .   President George Washington  "And let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle."    President Ronald Reagan   "Without God there is no virtue because there is no prompting of the conscience. . . . without God there is a coarsening of the society; without God democracy will not and cannot long endure. . . . If we ever forget that we are One Nation Under God, then we will be a Nation gone under."

      More details:   urlLink      Update:  The Austin American-Statesman, Austin's liberal paper, published this  urlLink article  on the rally.  Notice the article does not mention that the homosexual activists repeatedly yelled and interrupted songs, speakers, and prayers with horns, shouts, and chants, including the frequent "liar, liar, liar" while Tony Perkins was speaking.  This is not the way to win over hearts and minds, if that is in fact what these folks were hoping to do.  To be fair, the interruptions were from a small minority of the activists.  The speakers and anttendees responded with restraint and love.  It is very saddening to see how hate seems to drive so many folks in the homosexual lobby.  We all need Christ so very badly.  We all need Him.  By Anita Powell While nearly 100,000 Austinites flocked to Zilker Park for this year's Independence Day festivities, about 400 others thronged the empty Texas Capitol to toss a hot issue on the grill: gay marriage.   In sweltering late-afternoon heat, about 150 supporters of gay marriage and about 250 people on the other side of the issue participated in an impassioned but orderly event that featured singing, speeches and a spontaneous union of the factions for a group prayer on the Capitol steps.   "The issue is, we will be codifying into law what God himself has called an abomination," said keynote speaker Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a Washington-based lobbying group that sponsored the Christian-centered event with Austin-based TakeUp.org.   Representing the opposition were the Lesbian/Gay Rights Lobby of Texas and Soulforce Austin, both gay rights groups.   Randall Ellis, executive director of the lobby group, said he felt it was his patriotic duty to represent gay rights.   "I would much rather be home with my mother and father," he said. "But I feel very strongly that I had to be here."   Austin resident Doug McArthur, 59, came with his wife, Joan, to support their daughter, who is gay.   "We have a 33-year-old boy and a 29-year-old girl," said Joan McArthur, 57. "And both of them should be able to marry their girlfriends if they want to."   Bryan Sturdivant, 46, brought his wife and daughter, but to support the opposite view. The family attends the Church at Canyon Creek, a Baptist congregation in North Austin that brought a group to the event.   "I believe God created us as man and woman, and that's the way it should be," he said. "America was founded on God. And we've got to get back to him."   Some Christians in the crowd did not agree with that message, however.   "I believe that God created all people and that everyone is equal in his eyes," said Kristen Thomas, 20, who is Catholic. "Jesus loved tax collectors, he loved prostitutes; why wouldn't he have loved gays?"   Megan Steves, 26, and Naomi Douglas, 28, stood with their arms around each other's shoulders on the Capitol steps. Steves held a sign in support of gay marriage that read, "I can't."   "Independence Day doesn't mean anything when people aren't able to make their own decisions," Steves said. "They did this with blacks. And they're doing this with gays."   But Julius Buckner, 50, who said he opposes gay marriage, blanched at the comparison to the civil rights movement.   "It's not the same," said Buckner, who is black. "They still have the right to do what they want to."   An unexpected moment of solidarity occurred at the end, when the Rev. Michael Hatcher, pastor of Lighthouse Community Church in Fort Worth, invited the protesters to join him onstage in prayer.   "Let freedom ring in your heart," he prayed, stricken with emotion, surrounded by a throng of activists, arms linked, hands clasped, intermingled and indistinguishable.   "I saw it as an opportunity to spread love," he said of his call to prayer. "For me not to call my enemies to come and reconcile would be the wrong thing for me to do."

      From Jim Dunnigan on the  urlLink Strategy Page :  June 29, 2004: Iraqi terrorists released a video showing them killing a captive American soldier by shooting him in the head. The terrorists have learned that the beheading routine is counterproductive and even offends many of their own supporters. The terrorists are probably also debating their suicide bombing campaign, which has killed over a hundred Iraqis in the past week. Perhaps the al Qaeda leadership is also pondering their long string of failures over the last decade or so. The fact of the matter is that al Qaeda, and their predecessor, the Moslem Brotherhood in Egypt, have turned Arab populations against them whenever they practiced their terror tactics "at home." Moreover, when al Qaeda was in control of the government, as they were in Afghanistan, they quickly became hated by the average Afghan. Al Qaeda was most popular in Arab countries when it was not operating in any Arab countries, but instead concentrating on attacks on Western targets. But the war on terror has forced al Qaeda back to its homelands, and concentrated them in Iraq. There, al Qaeda is becoming as hated as it already is in the West. This hatred led to the Moslem Brotherhood's defeat, and expulsion from Egypt over a decade ago. The same thing is happening again in Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Recent surveys have shown support for bin Laden and al Qaeda shrink dramatically in Saudi Arabia (from 96 percent in late 2001, to less than a quarter of that currently.) It's easy to admire terrorists from a distance, rather more difficult when they are terrorizing you. Iraq is rapidly becoming al Qaeda's graveyard.

      I've just finished reading   urlLink Albion's Seed ,  (1989) by David Hackett Fischer. I was browsing the shelves of a Half-Price Books a few years ago, during a lunch hour, and spotted it. Recommended to me by none other than Sir James, I bought it, and it decorated my bookshelf for the next several years, always intimidating me with its bulk (898 pages). But last spring I decided it was time to read through the various books which had been bought but not read by me, so into  Albion's Seed  I went.  And I was hooked! For a long, mostly-academic sort of book, it's fascinating. The colonial migrations to the New World can be divided into four rough time periods, groups of people, and geographical entities, consisting of:    East Anglians to Massachusetts (1629-41): The English Puritans    South England to Virginia (1642-75): The Cavaliers   North Midlands to the Delaware Valley (1675-1725): The Friends      Borderlands to the Backcountry (1717-1775): The Borderers     Fischer then goes into each folkway in great deal, examining each in their everyday life: life-ways, death-ways, building-ways, election-ways, church-ways, child-rearing ways, sex-ways, language-ways, farming-ways, and all sorts of other cultural "norms" for each culture. He found that in each American colonial experience, the traditions which became dominant for an American region could be traced to a specific part of Britain. The Appalachian people of the United States, for example, share an enormous number of traditions with their Scots-English borderer ancestors, one of which is a tendency to violence and extreme distrust of strangers. Large parts of backcountry Carolina spoke Gaelic as late as the 1900's, in fact.  I was fascinated in how I could see myself, and my own personal tendencies, fit right into the cultural "norms" and "ways" that Fischer identified. My family is from the West, from eastern Oregon, but almost of all of my ancestors immigrated from Kentucky or Tennessee. Other branches of the family came from Virginia, although where in Virginia I'm not quite sure. Possibly there is a distant connection to the Lees, so not all my ancestors were of the "backcountry" folkways, but---from what I know of my family---most of them were. That makes sense, when I think about which of the four folkways I most closely identify with. It's the backcountry way. I'm hardly quick to violence, nor do I live in a log cabin, but in most cases I prefer direct action, violent if necessary, over diplomacy or negotiation. I can negotiate when I have to, but it always goes against the grain. Also like the backcountry, I prefer plainness, and in general care very little about niceties of custom and "proper" ways of doing things. Perhaps most importantly, I have a very strong stubborn and independent streak, tending sometimes to contrarianism, which would be recognizable to anyone familiar with Andrew Jackson or John C. Calhoun.  Back to  Albion's Seed , Fischer concluded with a brief summary of U.S. electoral results as interpreted regionally, and argued that, though none of the regions has maintained itself in any sort of a pure way, and though some regions (such as New England) now have harldy anyone left of their original British stock, still the regions maintain much of their original tint, and over the course of American history, the regions have tended to vote consistently, with just the ocassional aberration like FDR in 1932, Eisenhower in 1952, or Reagan in 1980.  Fischer's final words on the regions of America:   Regional diversity has created a dynamic tension within a single republican ssytem. It has also fostered at least four different ideas of liberty with a common cultural frame.  These four ideas are not European, though they derive from there.  They are: 1) The Puritan idea of ordered freedom 2) The cavalier idea of hegemonic freedom 3) The Quaker idea of reciprocal freedom 4) The backcountry idea of natural freedom  Each of these four freedom ways still preserves its seperate existence in the United States. The most important fact about American liberty is that is has never been a single idea, but a set of different and even contrary traditions in creative tension with one another. This diversity of libertarian ideas has created a culture of freedom which is more open and exapnsive than any unitary tradition alone could possibly be.   There are many explanations for why America is what it is, and all of them have some part of the truth. Fischer's work is an invaluable aid to anyone seeking to understand what made the United States.

      The California Supreme Court has held that the mayor of San Francisco does not have the power to marry same-sex couples  in violation of California law.  The court was at pains to stress that they were not ruling on the issue of gay marriage, but simply noting that California law at present does not allow gay marriage, therefore the mayor can't marry gay couples:   We hold only that in the absence of a judicial determination that such statutory provisions are unconstitutional, local executive officials lacked authority to issue marriage licenses to, solemnize marriages of, or register certificates of marriage for same-sex couples, and marriages conducted between same-sex couples in violation of the applicable statutes are void and of no legal effect. Should the applicable statutes be judicially determined to be unconstitutional in the future, same-sex couples then would be free to obtain valid marriage licenses and enter into valid marriages. (hat tip:  urlLink Volokh Conspiracy )   That's good, I think.  Not because they invalidated gay marriage: I suppose I should care about gay marriage, but I really don't.  I do care about the rule of law, though, and the thing that bothers me most about the gay marriages in California is that they are against the law.  The mayor, a representative of the law, can hardly be claiming to give gay couples the protection of the law (i.e., legal marriage) when he is acting against the law, can he?  His defence was that he believes the California law against gay marriage is unconstitutional and thus he has no responsibility to uphold it.  But that is a very slippery-slope, and I'm glad---for the sake of the rule of law---that the California Supreme Court rejected that argument.

          Hey guys, tonight is the eve of greatness, tommorrow I will be bringing the smack down on a drunk driver.  That's right, Mr. Kehr for the People of the State of Michigan vs. Naughty Drunk Driver Man.  I'm clerking/interning with my local Prosecutor's Office this summer and this will be my trial debut and it should be fun and challenging.  I've worked up a great opening statement though, so I think I'll have the jury from the start.  There is something of an entrapment issue in the case, which is really going to be fun, but I am going to try and nip that right in the bud with a motion right before trial.  Anyway, if you guys read this tonight or tommorrow (Thur, Aug 12) send a little prayer up for me and I'll let you all know how it goes.  J-Roc

      I've been seeing a commercial on TV lately: a mother comforting her child, sitting in the bathroom with the shower on, encouraging the child to breathe deeply.  The camera pans to the medicine cabinent, where the mother chooses a medicine capsule, and continues to murmur comforting words to the child.  The commercial concludes with something about 1 in 5 families in America must choose between medicine or food.  The shower confused me the first few times I saw the commercial, but presumably the child has asthma.  I am wondering about the 1 in 5 statement though: how did they come up with this number?  I don't remember who pays for the commercial, or I'd look them up, but I checked around on Google rather extensively, and---for a problem so large---there is precious little real information.  Nearly every website I visited was an  assertion  by someone, usually a politician sponsoring a bill, a aid worker, or an opinion writer, that some people, especially the elderly, must choose between medicine and food.  The only actual evidence I could find  urlLink was a study  done in a Minneapolis hospital in 2001 or before, which concluded that 18% of 527 patients (53 people) had not had enough food to eat at least once in the previous year.  Now, it may be true that thousands upon thousands of Americans must choose between medicine and food, as one source I read claimed, but I haven't seen any  evidence  of that.  I'd like to know the truth, one way or the other: too many of those "1 in 5" claims are based on estimations or plain old spurious data.

      I believe that congratulations are in order for Toyah's very own Anthony Williams.  The A-Train recently proposed to his girlfriend, Debbie, who naturally accepted.  That makes it one Highlander down and five to go.  Way to go, Anthony!

      Missouri citizens just passed a state constitutional amendment forbidding gay marriage (federalism at work) and, according to the blog  urlLink ScrappleFace , judges are vying for the opportunity to be the first to strike it down.  Life as a tyrant must be nice!

      The  urlLink word  on the street is that Illinois Republicans have narrowed their search for a candidate to challenge talented Democrat Barack Obama to two black politicians, Andrea Grubb Barthwell, a former deputy drug czar in the current administration, and Alan Keyes, a perennial favorite of those who have followed past Republican presidential primary races. I for one would gladly pay large sums of money to see Ambassador Keyes debate the media-dubbed boy-wonder Obama on national television. Though I don't pretend that Mr. Keyes' chance of being the selected candidate is very good, or that, if selected, he stands much chance of winning, I think any race in which Mr. Keyes participates, or for that matter any candidate who must challenge him, will be much better for it. Please, Illinois, give us Keyes!

      I'm back from a few weeks of work and travel and ready to make totally random comments on issues about which I should spend much more time thinking before I opine. But, the beauty of blogging is that we get to open our random and developing thoughts to comment by others so that we can adjust and fine-tune them. So here it goes: Here's my impression of the place of third parties, and the Libertarian Party in particular, in the American political system.  The major American parties are essentially coalition parties that form before an election, rather than, as in our European counterparts, after an election. The truth of this can be observed in the fact that members of single factions within a party, such as the libertarians or evangelical Christians in the Republican Party, or the environmentalists or civil libertarians in the Democratic Party, persistently wail that the rest of the party has lost its backbone, gives in to its opponents, has sold its soul to the Devil, and simply no longer looks like “them.” As in all coalitions, party coalitions share several transcendent themes, such as limited government or progressive government. But these themes themselves are bifurcated and shift in emphasis depending on the cultural and political climate of the day. Libertarian members of the Republican Party enjoyed a prominent position in the years leading up to and including the Reagan Administration because of the problems created by the post-New Deal boom in government. In recent times, the so-called neocons have dominated in a climate of terrorism and national security. Both sides share many common beliefs, but not so much that they don’t still maintain their separate affinities and identities.  This is where third parties come in. First, third parties surface when, while in the governing coalition, they feel dissatisfied with the way their coalition is running things. Examples on point: the Libertarian Party arose during the big-spending Nixon administration; Ross Perot’s Libertarian-leaning Reform Party during George H.W. Bush’s centrist administration; and Ralph Nader and the Green Party during centrist Bill Clinton’s administration. In each instance, the effect of the defection was to weaken the governing coalition and hand control of government to the opposing coalition party, the proverbial “heads you lose, tails you lose,” as the switch had the effect of handing government from a potential ally to a clear enemy.  The Libertarian party, however, is an odd duck. In truth, though the LP’s free-market, anti-welfare state principles find more in common with the Republicans, their general anything-goes, absolute liberty presumptions also attract a number of left-leaning civil libertarians to their ranks. These folks, once convinced that the LP does not match their Republican brethren in repugnant religious zeal, find in the LP a group of agnostic and pro-marihuana hippies they can easily identify with.  So, what effect the formation and growth of the Libertarian Party? Overall, the presence of an active LP lessens the influence of libertarian thought in either party, and correspondingly, lessens their influence in government. This statement, however, deserves some explanation. First, there are relatively few consistent Libertarian (big “L”) voters out there, and even fewer Libertarian candidates. The Libertarians’ loss of influence, therefore, does not happen at the polls. The real loss is in terms of the libertarian (little “l”) politicos. These are the folks who would (and in past administrations, did) actively work for Republican (and Democratic) officials or governments, but have instead thrown their lot in with a separate Libertarian third party where their influence in government is nil. Instead of working for reforms from within the fortress, where many were quite successful in the past, they have tried to storm the ramparts from outside, and all without the benefits of a coalition.  The result of a separate Libertarian Party therefore is to go from having some libertarian influence in government by operating within one of the coalition parties, to having no influence. The LPers may feel better about themselves, but they’ll wind up with worse, not better government (at least from their perspective).  There is a final chapter to this story. Often following the third-party split and fall of the ruling coalition, both the newly-defeated coalition party and the prodigal third-party re-form to defeat the common enemy. From the perspective of the third party, they have won by forcing the coalition in their direction. The cycle, of course, usually repeats because the ruling coalition must have 51% to win. In the Libertarian Party phenomenon, however, the advent of a LP coalition that includes a left-leaning faction could permanently dampen the LP’s chances of rejoining a ruling coalition, as the new commitment by leftists will permanently lock the Libertarian Party out of any ruling coalition.  To recap, by not participating in the major coalition parties, libertarians have significantly lessened their influence in government. If the libertarians feel perpetually left out of the Republican Party, they only have the Libertarian Party to blame.
