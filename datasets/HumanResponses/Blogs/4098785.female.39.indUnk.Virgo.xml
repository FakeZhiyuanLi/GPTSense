      welcome to the metaphorical acid trip that is an existential wrinkle in the life of one W.P.; 39 and fast approaching 40, many many bags of M & M's later, refugee of several ill-advised home hair treatments, graduate of the comprehensive school of mortifying feaux pas performances and heartbreaking procrastination. Maybe, just maybe, there is a corner of the universe where we itinerant hitchikers can safely put out our hand and catch a ride in the HOV lane on the highway of personal growth and hope to just occasionally break even with our mature and smoothly callibrated brethren, and share a high five and know that we are all on this journey together and if we slackers weren't bringing up the rear, those over-achieving responsible well-adjusted debt free tax-paying law-abiding human-impersonating matinee idols driving those well maintained cars with up to date insurance and current tags wouldn't look nearly as shellacked as they appear to.  Day one of the actual journey was today, but so many nerve eviscorating lifetimes preceeded today.  Depending on your patience for reflective prose, we could start with me watching the Gong show a humdred years ago and stating without DOUBT that that was what I wanted to do.  Any of you who saw the movie about Chuck Barris can conclude for yourself about my early judgement abilities in terms of aestheticly enriching entertainment venues.  However this convoluted road found its way to the current trajectory, here we go and I want you all to come right along with me.  I'll try to write sort of literally about what's going on, but any of you who know me know I have no love affair with clinically objective observation.  Robert gave up his biking to take Finley and I to the airport today because he rightly feared for the eternal damnation of his everlasting soul if he went didn't.  He sent me off with explicit instructions to return with a beautifully hand sewn bag with lots and lots of money.  Robert's got his eye on the ball - eye-ball - get it?  :-)  :-) Chip was waiting gallantly in the wings to pull back up duty, and we love you for it!  Finley and I flew Independance Air to Boston and it was really great - super pleasant and offered Finley the chance to meet the pilot and everything!  FlyI.com -great flying experience!  Edith picked us up and we almost ran out of gas, but we were chatting about my clothing and any of you remotely familiar with the nuts and bolts of this operation know that any conversation involving what I'm going to wear is delicate in nature to say the least.  I am at Edith's house now, having completed the first baby step of the preliminary lap of this  reality show odyssey.  I have 30 pages of legalese to wade through and sign, and hundreds of miles to go North before returning South next week to New York and the jungles of the garment district and the siren song of the 24/7 cameras.
