      I recently did a bit of research on American democracy, and it turns out that not only does the Electoral College almost always give all of its votes to the candidate who wins the majority of votes in that state, but the number of electoral votes are skewed, also. Let me illustrate.  Majority takes states completely: To make this simple, let's assume that there are only 3 states in the US, and each gets one Electoral College vote (EV). (It works the same way with 50 states.) Each state has 100 people. Here are possible results: State-1 Popular Vote: 49 Kerry 51 Bush State-2 Popular Vote: 49 Kerry 51 Bush State-3 Popular Vote: 100 Kerry 0 Bush Total Popular Vote: 198 Kerry 102 Bush Yet, because the state casts its EV for the majority winner of the state, Bush wins 2 states and Kerry wins only 1. Thus, one candidate can win almost double the votes of the other, yet still lose the election. This happened to a lesser extent in the 2000 election, when Gore won the popular vote but lost in the EC.But that's not all. With the Electoral College system in place, voters in some states are much more powerful than voters in other states. Let me illustrate.  Electoral votes skewed: California population: 34,000,000 California EV: 55 Wyoming population: 500,000 Wyoming EV: 3 California has 68 times as many people as Wyoming. (68x500,000=34,000,000) So, shouldn't you be able to multiply the 3 Wyoming votes by that same factor of 68 to get the number of EC votes that Californians should have? 3x68=204 Thus, Californians, if they had the voting power of the people of Wyoming, should have 204 EC votes. Yet they have only 55.204/55=3.7 Thus, each person in Wyoming has 3.7 times as many votes as Californians do.  Pretty difficult to understand, eh? Hey, I have a better idea. I don't know if it would go over well, but it's just so crazy, it might work! How about...we, like, give every registered American voter one vote each. Then, we can, like, count up the votes. And the president would be chosen according to who has the most votes. Actually, that idea has been thought of before. It's called a "direct democracy".  But even though I am against the electoral college, it appears to be in my favor this year, with one early prediction having Kerry with 327 EC votes and Bush with 211. Check this nice map out. And move the cursor over a state to see the popular vote percentages. urlLink http://www.electoral-vote.com/

      On Friday (the 13th, no less), Chris and I went to Wilmington to stay at April's house during the weekend! (The trip took about 4 hours from Charlotte.) Masato and Paul also met us there and stayed at her house. So, I was able to be with some of my best friends again, after more than a year! Masato, Chris, Paul, and April are all from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill...my university in North Carolina (that I graduated from). Not only that, but Maria (April's older sister) was also there...and of course Oscar, their dog. We had a lot of fun together! When we met, nobody looked so different. It was as if we'd just been together only a few short months ago instead of a whole year.  Anyway, we had a lot of fun on Friday. We went down to the Cape Fear River area (basically the center of the city) and went to a CD shop and then went to a cafe. I found an "I Love[heart symbol] NY Pizza" restaurant, got a slice of my favorite pizza there, and took it into the cafe. After that, we went to get tickets to see "Alien VS Predator". Masato and I had to pay full price $7.25 for our tickets but the others somehow got theirs for $5.00. The discounted tickets were sold by mistake so at first Masato and I asked why we got ripped off, but when we felt that the manager was ready to take back the discounted tickets that the others had received, we decided to not press further into the matter. We had to wait until our 9:40pm movie began, so we went to eat at a good Mexican restaurant. When we were all done, we went to Blockbuster (a video rental store) to rent some movies..."The Graduate" and some crappy movie called "68 Grams" or something. By the time we'd done that, we felt we should get back to the theater. Alien VS Predator was...how should I say this?...a pretty crappy movie. Not Alien Resurrection crappy, but quite bad nonetheless. *Spoilers for the rest of this paragraph* The worst part was that it was rated "PG13" instead of "R", so it couldn't be so scary or gory. There was some blood to be found, but not much. They also made the fight scenes almost impossible to see because of extreme close-ups and changing camera angles. Also, the majority of the people (and predators) died within a 10-minute period. Thus, for the whole second half, there were (fewer than or equal to) 2 people and 1 predator (yet it started with perhaps 10 people and 3 predators). How stupid. The whole storyline was stupid. I heard that they picked the worse of the 2 main scripts for the movie, and I believe it. (The other script had them in the future, around the time of the Alien movies, I think.) This was in some ancient pyramid near Antarctica. And yes, the Batman and Robin part made it into a comedy instead of a horror film. The woman and the predator teamed up...even ran side by side like a duo...and fought aliens. Oh god... I can understand a predator letting humans live...or even having respect for a great human fighter. But them running side by side was too much, and the audience broke into laughter.  The next day started out great, but ended up ruining my mood. There was a hurricane around noon, and the power went out. That was OK, because we played Taboo (one of my favorite games) and had a fun time. April, Maria, and I won (in a game to 25)! We even went outside into the hurricane, which was then downgraded to a tropical storm, I think. It wasn't rainy...just windy. And the wind wasn't so strong. So although I don't recommend you doing this at home, we didn't see any danger in doing it. There was no way that the wind could blow us down or anything. After the tropical storm had subsided, and the sun had come out, we decided to go to Wrightsville Beach. (It ended up that we weren't even allowed to swim in the ocean that day.) That was where tragedy struck. While throwing a Frisbee, a large water swell came up and inundated our belongings with water. I'd brought my camera and camcorder with me, and only my camcorder seems to have survived (and thank god for that). My camera, which has served me well for 3 years, died that day. The salt water seems to have gotten in...even though when I opened the battery area and the memory card port, it didn't appear to have gotten in...and I didn't hear any sloshing inside. In fact, it didn't seem terribly wet. But the camera doesn't work, and after leaving it with its batteries still inside (after trying other batteries), it started heating up. Somehow the batteries are just hurting it more. Now what do I do? I guess I must use my dad's camera and my camcorder for the time being. I don't have enough money for a new camera, and I don't think I'll get one until after I buy a new laptop...which could be a while, though not more than a year from now. We'll see what happens, but I don't think that my camera can be fixed. :(  Sadly, that really ruined the rest of my trip. I was more cranky than usual after I found out that my camera didn't work anymore. I don't know if the others noticed at all... I wasn't sad all the time, and I did have fun, but I wish I could have said that the trip was great in all respects. It was great in that I got to meet my best friends again, but it will also always be remembered as the time my first digital camera broke. Anyway, I'm sure that I'll be very happy with my new camera, once I get one. (Meanwhile, poor April got sick on Saturday, and was very sleepy on Sunday...and her cell-phone get destroyed by the same wave that splashed my camera.)  On Sunday, Paul, Masato, and April went to Catholic mass at a church. Meanwhile, Chris and I went to a relatively nearby mall (and Maria stayed home). Anyway, after they got back, Paul and Masato left, and Maria, April, Chris, and I went out to eat lunch. We ended up at the Atlanta Bread Company, and my sandwich was awesome! (As was the Domino's pizza the previous night.) After we got back to April's place, I showed her some photos of my vacations and then Chris and I left (just after 4:00pm). After I left, I felt sort of sad. Even more than the usual sadness of leaving, I felt sad because I think some of my irritation showed up during late Saturday and Sunday, and I hoped that April (and Maria) understood that I did have a good time. I hope to see my friends again soon!  After departing Wilmington, I drove Chris back to my house and he stayed the night. Today, I dropped him off at the bus station so he could get back to Asheville.

      I heard that the legislature (including the majority of both parties) firmly approved some plan to give $400 billion (or so) to the military to buy more weapons and perhaps modernize even more. God, I'm so against that. It's one thing to protect the United States and make sure that our forces don't become obsolete, but I swear that no country has any plan of ever attacking us. What country would? With all of the terror threats these days, you'd think we'd be more interested in increasing our defensive security forces (like with cameras, bomb-detectors, etc). But with 1,000 more Bradley fighting vehicles and 10,000 more Surface to Air Missiles (numbers made up), we still won't be able to do a darn thing about that. We can bomb any country into the ground but where does that get us? Any safer? Obviously not. That money should be spent on a few things. One is , like I said, defence...including more inspections of container ships and such. I'm sure that tripling the inspections would only cost...hmm...maybe $1 billion per year? OK, now on with the other $380 billion (assuming this is a 20-year plan). How about helping some of the rest of the world? Indonesia, probably the most biodiverse country (both in terms of forest species and underwater reef species) and I would say by far the most endangered as well, has horrible problems with stopping illegal logging, fires, and dynamite- and cyanide-fishing which are quickly destroying what nature there is left in a country with 2/3rds of the population of America squeezed onto relatively small landmasses. Illegal logging costs them "millions" of dollars a year, and they don't have enough money (and in many cases, willpower and lack of corruption) to stop it. Perhaps the most diverse area in the world will be almost devoid of nature in 20 years. America can sure team up with countries when it concerns oil, or tracking down terror suspects...but never when it concerns the natural heritage of our planet. $1 billion from the US per year, if implemented in programs known not to be corrupt (like establishing satellite technology and guards to protect the remaining natural areas), would probably hault almost all of the illegal environmental destruction in that country. And with $400 billion, that could probably said for every country in the world for the next 20 years at least. I don't kid around when I say that the increase in spending on offensive weaponry (which we'll never use unless we're ATTACKING, as I understand) could truly solve most environmental problems across the entire globe. Look at this link for the amount of smoke coming from fires set on the large Indonesian island of Sumatera. It's a photo taken, showing fires raging that day! Imagine how much nature goes up in flames in a year (and this doesn't even include the logging, though some of the fires might have been set on agricultural fields). (Red spots indicate fires and you can see the smoke plumes coming from them. The entire city of Singapore is the small part at the bottom of the Malaysian peninsula on the right side of the screen. Only the darkest of the green areas are forested areas.)  urlLink http://rapidfire.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/gallery/?2003159-0608/Sumatra2.A2003159.0625.1km.jpg  According to this next link, forest fires (mostly caused by people) destroyed an area equal to more than 70 times the size of Singapore just in 1997. (This does not even consider the logging that also went (and of course still goes) on.)  urlLink http://www.easysurf.cc/cnver5.htm   In other news, I went to UNCC today. The campus is a lot smaller than I expected. It was not nearly as large as UNC Chapel Hill...and it was probably only a bit larger than the Arts Faculty at NUS. Hmm...that it was about to Keio Mita Campus or Hiyoshi Campus standards in terms of size. Definitely, you don't need a bus to get around it. At any rate, I went into the "King Building" with my questions and met with a woman who is in charge of certain aspects of the program, but does not know many specifics about it. Still, I asked her everything that my dad wanted me to ask, because I knew that if I came back with nothing, it would be worse than coming back with information that's composed of lots of guesses, along with truth. She said that I should ask some of the professors (and gave me their room numbers and contact info) for more specific information and to be sure of things, but she did give me enough to tell my dad later on. After the meeting, I looked around campus a bit more. Then, I headed to a Borders bookstore and returned home.  I told my mom and she thought that the program was a good idea. Then, my dad got home and I tried to convince him (after my mom started explaining and my dad told her to let me tell him, myself). At first, he said, "If you like GIS so much, why did you make a 'C' in the class?" Well, I don't know why I made a 'C', considering I tried hard and thought I did quite well. I could see that my dad was getting annoyed, and I said, "That's why I wanted my mom to tell you." My dad was like, "OK, forget it...go on..." Anyway, at the end of things, I convinced my dad to let me take the 5-week GIS course. He said that he'd be taking the money out of my already negligible "loan-payment fund", but it's OK with me because $2,000 is not so much in the long run, when I have the chance for a good salary (depending on what I do, of course). Although the program does not offer placement services, I told him how many things GIS can be used for, and that a starting salary for a GIS Technician (I guess someone who is good at ArcGIS) in a big company would be around US$30,000/yr! That's what I heard, at least. And let's hope I can find one. I'll try, that's for sure. Indeed, I've promised my dad that I'll try very hard and ask my professors for help with finding a job. Something pretty cool to add is that some of my professors have traveled quite frequently (sometimes spending years in other countries) while doing GIS work!When looking for a GIS job, the first one will probably get me some experience and then I can either work my way up or look for another job. Once I have some experience, I think (and hope) that the entire world will be open to me...and I will be able to get a job anywhere I desire, and travel a lot, too!

      It seems that the Democratic National Convention did not help Kerry very much in the polls. And I have a feeling (and a strong desire) that the Republican National Convention will have the same small effect. I feel that this will be the case because America is a divided country...probably moreso than ever before in the past 100 years, except for possibly during the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights marches (the mid to late 1960's and early 1970's). But even then, I don't think that the difference between the presidential candidates was so great that the battle between cultures became an outright political battle. There is a strong division between the American people. And that means that people are more partisan than ever before...hence, it is almost impossible to sway someone at this point. People know the candidates...they know who they like...and perhaps just as importantly, they know who they don't like. Seeing a convention on TV will probably not sway many people. Perhaps debates could, but I even doubt that. By now, people are set in their ways. Me included, of course.  Still, if I were in charge of either of the presidential campaigns, I wouldn't just give up and call advertisements or conventions not worth the effort and money. Even if the percentage of registered voters who are truly undecided or have the ability to be swayed is 10%, that's still a whole lot. I believe that in most states, neither Kerry nor Bush will win by 10%. Thus, that small 10% is so very important.  Would I wish that everyone in this country would think the same, making democracy un-interesting? Well, I guess most people would say, "Yes, but only if everyone thought MY way." Since nobody can get his or her way, I think that a difference of opinions IS preferable. However, even with the outlook that difference is good, you still gotta hope that the KKK and other sub-cultures never gain (or keep) the hearts and minds of too many people.  And personally, I hope that the Conservative Right (and Bush along with it) doesn't, either.  Man, I'm getting lonely. I'm even starting to find the will to work...just to make myself seem needed and talk to new people. I'll probably call a temp agency soon and hopefully start working in 2 weeks (just at a temporary job...later moving on to another and another). I think that temp work will build some skills and it will also allow me to meet more people. I'll then have more people to talk to in Charlotte.  I don't think I'll stay in Charlotte...definitely not my whole life. So I think I'll remember that during my time here, I'll be spending precious time with my family...and I might not get so many chances in the future to do that.  I don't know what's in my future, and Charlotte's not a bad place, but I think I'll be somewhere else in 5 years, if that. But...one important thing will also have a major impact on where I choose to live...and that's where I can get a job! Right now, I feel skill-less. I know that I have many skills, but I don't think that many jobs at all would utilize them. I think that the GIS course is a MUST in order to do anything worthwhile. In my GIS course at NUS, there was a lot of stuff I had problems with, but I think that it wasn't the software but rather a lack of knowledge (and a severe lack of help coming from an instructor who had to deal with a whole classroom full of people like us). At the end of it all, however, I found that GIS could probably help me do a lot of things, albeit after some serious training. My dad needs hard proof that I'll be able to get a job quickly after graduating from that 5-week, US$2,000 course. I don't see any other choice besides taking it, but I understand that my dad would want some proof of the future uses of the GIS skills that I'd learn through that course. Tomorrow, I will go to UNC Charlotte (where the course will be held) and ask some questions and ask to see the book and syllabus (as per my dad's instructions) and ask about job placement, starting salaries in a possible job I'd get after the program, and other important things.

      Hello again everyone. Siti Mariam helped convince me to add a guestbook to my blog. She actually suggested a tag-board, but I think that a guestbook is a bit better for my blog. By now, I'm used to writing on guestbooks...and now I have one. It is located on the bottom of my blog. Just click on the link and you will be taken to a different page. Just enter your information (as much as you'd like) and comment away. Of course, you can also comment without using the guestbook. Just click on the link below the entry you'd like to comment on. So now you have 3 ways to make a comment. The other way, of course, is by emailing me.  I supposedly set it to email me everytime a comment is made on my blog. So far, it has not worked. Does anybody know how to have comments automatically sent to my email address? Do you think this feature doesn't work?...Or are the emails just late sometimes? If you have any ideas, just let me know.

      For those who are not up to date, here is a very short update of my life recently. I'm from Charlotte, North Carolina and I went to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. During my Junior year in college (=university), I studied abroad in Japan. I went to Keio University in Yokohama and Tokyo, and I had a great time. After an amazing Senior year at Chapel Hill, I went off to study abroad one last time...this time in Singapore. During my year in Singapore, I took many trips...to Japan (twice!), Australia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Thailand. I'm so thankful for what I've been able to experience.  Now, I'm finally done as an undergraduate (and I'm back in Charlotte) but I might get into GIS (Geographic Information Systems). It's basically about using information (including satellite images in some instances...but often numerical data) and displaying that information on maps. So, I might take a 5-week GIS program that would give me a certificate upon successful completion. And that could hopefully get me a job that interests me.  Right now, I'm basically taking it easy. I will go to a temp agency in a few weeks and get some part-time jobs while I take that GIS program (if I take it). Also, because I don't know many people in Charlotte (remember, I haven't lived here in 5 years for any good length of time), temp work could expose me to more jobs and thus more people...and there could be more chances to get to know people here. So we'll see what happens in a few weeks...but for now, I'll just relax.

      Hello everyone!  This is a blog I've created so that many of my friends can get updated about my life by simply checking this website.  I am not sure how often I will update this blog, but I think that the more everyone seems to be interested, the more I'll write.  Of course, I definitely would like to continue communicating by email, which is a lot more personal than a blog.  But perhaps this can even facilitate communication...in the form of comments to this blog or in the form of emails...because the more you know about my life, the more we'll have to talk about.  Although this IS a blog about my life, I don't think that this will get very in-depth about my feelings or any private issues.  Thus, it might be a little boring.  We'll just have to see how it goes.  Keeping in mind that this will probably not grow to be a tell-all diary, I'd still be interested in seeing any non-private blogs that any of you readers might be keeping.  I think that if you start blogs and tell me about them, then we can easily check in on each other's lives.  Especially with those whom I've not had much contact with recently, I feel that having blogs can help us to catch up on each other's lives, and foster communication.  So, without further ado, I'll get to blogging!
