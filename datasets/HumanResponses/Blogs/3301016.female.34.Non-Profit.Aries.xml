      It's 8.19 and the day is already bizarre.  Two weeks ago i struggled to run for more than a minute - today i went for a 25 minute run before work; it was pretty hard going today but i did it and i am on schedule not to make a complete and utter prat of myself in the 5k a week on Sunday.  Hoorah to that!  However, by the time i arrived at work i was feeling slightly weary from the run and then slightly paranoid as there was a minibus full of people watching me as i arrived for work.  I sorted the post as i was feeling particularly generous and was pleased that there were some "real" letters for us as opposed to the usual junk.  I opened the one with the nice handwriting first. Woo hoo!  What a good start to the working day - a letter from a relatively famous author who i had written to asking for his support for the charity i work for.  Ok, so the answer was "no" - pretty much as we expected - but it was a REALLY lovely letter.  So hoorah for lovely authors, hoorah for being able to run for 25 minutes without dying and hoorah for that cup of coffee that is brewing right now........

      Yoga is kind of surreal enough without the whole going to the class thing becoming a bizarre entity of its own.  It's weird enough that it is held in the gym of a posh public school but then there is the ritual we go through every week - and this is before the class starts!  The class before us is just kicking out as we arrive, and every week they walk past us carrying their yoga mats as we walk in the opposite direction carrying ours.  And no one EVER says anything!  No "hello" - nothing.  And it isn't as if i don't TRY to catch their eye and smile.  It struck me this evening that this has been going on for two and half terms now.  The same people, every week, all with yoga mats and NOT A WORD IS SPOKEN!  Tonight as i walked into the class i mentioned that is was like belonging to some kind of secret society, and everyone else agreed.  I said that i thought it was just me they ignored.  Everyone else said they felt the same.  Anyway - the yoga was good, then i came home had some guacamole and oatcakes and bit into a piece of chilli.  My mouth is on fire so i am going away to try and put it out!

      Maybe it was a good day to start - the sun was shining at 6 when i pulled myself out of bed and fell into my training gear.  I've been wanting to run for AGES but have been really wet about it - ie one minute of exhaustion later and i've given up - but no escape this time - the Run for Life 5k is coming up and i've entered.  My aim this morning was to run for 2 minutes then walk for 2 until i had done 10 mins.  But it went really well - and i actually ran for 10 minutes, walking for 2 in the middle.  Came to work a bit achey but i couldn't stop grinning.  In fact i am REALLY pleased with myself - and this time i'm not going to give up. I think being signed off from the mental health service yesterday really helped.  I've suffered from depression for 20 years since i was a teenager, but i have finally found a bit of a solution and this running thing is another part of the recovery.
