      I've pretty much abandoned my marathon dreams -- at least for this summer.  It seemed like such a cool thing to do to celebrate my 35th year, but I've reached a point in my training where I just don't want to do it anymore.  Pick your excuse:  __ I'm tired of having no social life. After three years in Chicago I'm finally getting invited to parties and dinners and movies with some halting regularity, and suddenly I have to turn everyone down because I have to run.  __ I have worked my ass off (or on, as the case may be) in the gym to put muscle on my naturally skeletal frame.  And it's paid off -- people actually hit on me now.  I think.  But this constant running has been the fastest way to strip off many years' worth of muscular accumulation.  Which is NOT something I'm emotionally ready to face.  Not, at least, in the Year of the Homosexual.  __ My knees always hurt.  Which is making me feel OLD.  __ Despite my varying training routes and my regular runs with FrontRunners, it's all getting rather boring.  __ I'm just not having any fun.    But have no fear -- I've put in enough training that I can easily be ready for my first half marathon in September.  So I'm going to go for that.  And in the mean time, I'll be pumping up at the gym.  Or waiting by the phone for you to ask me on a date.

      ACK! Why does my job always have to be so overwhelming? The week after a relaxing vacation at home should be calm and manageable and relatively stress-free -- a sort of re-entry into the real world of advertising. Instead, I've been plagued with emergency RFPs and clients who need to be slapped and 11-hour days at my desk.  Sigh.

      I'm back from a great trip home.  A few highlights:  * Seeing a bunch of old theater friends in a spectacular production of  La Cage aux Folles . I'm so proud of everyone for doing such a great job clomping (in heels, no less) through unfamiliar territory like drag shows and potential public scorn. Iowa has more than its share of thumper wackos (whose obesession with all things gay often prompts them to turn out in anti-gay protest of things that aren't even gay), but the director of the show said there wasn't even a peep from that corner about this fabulous drag musical.  * Seeing a bunch more theater friends in the audience. It was a homecoming reunion to beat all homecoming reunions.  * Being the hero to my 4-year-old nephew. A kid's love is so genuine and so unquestioning, and it's such a moving gift to receive. But Gunnar LOVES to sleep with Uncle Jake whenever I visit. And he's a kicker. So his love can also be exhausting. (I'm still working on being a hero to my 20-month-old niece. She sat on my lap once and she handed me her prize bunny once during my visit. So I'm making progress.)  * Hanging out with my family. I'm so lucky to be related to such cool people. I always enjoy their company, and the time always flies by whenever I visit.  * Visiting my friends Dave and Carol and watching their daughter camp it up in front of me. She definitely got the performing gene from her parents, and she's ADORABLE.  (Not as adorable as my niece -- nobody could ever be -- but you probably already knew that.)  * Seeing my ex, Jeff. He's such a great guy and we had such a good run together. But our breakup let me move to Chicago and find a sense of personal and professional happiness I never knew I could have when I was in Iowa. And he seems genuinely happy with his new beau, Matt, so I'm looking at our whole history as win-win.   * Running through my old haunts to satisfy my waning interest in running the Chicago Marathon. Cedar Rapids was hit with a devastating storm a week ago, and many of its grand old trees now lie in piles at the curb -- so the old neighborhoods look markedly different. But the city is still a beautiful place, and so much of it is filled with happy memories for me.  * Shopping in malls where people smile and act friendly and don't pull things off shelves and drop them on the floor if they don't want them. And in Cedar Rapids, there are things in my size on the racks and savings in my pocket every time I head back to my car.  Woo-hoo!

      Newsweek wouldn't print my letter -- though it printed some far-less-articulate responses to its coverage of the Supreme Court's sodomy ruling last month.  Anyway, I'm posting my expertly crafted angry-homo letter here in a revenge-of-the-unpublished attempt to justify the time I spent on it. Please enjoy.  * * *  Lou Sheldon doesn't believe the followers of Christian mythology deserve to have their faith "trampled" by the dawning social equality of gay people. But what hierarchy places the chosen beliefs of the religious (and religious affiliation is arguably more a choice than sexual orientation) over the legitimate rights of gay people not to have patently demeaning laws enacted against them?  These social conservatives' vitriolic fascination with "homosexual activity" stands in stark contrast to their lack of similar outrage over the destructive (and exclusive) byproducts of heterosexual activity: teen pregnancy, single-parent families, soaring divorce rates, overpopulation, and an unquenchable demand for abortion that polarizes our nation and diverts congressional resources--and tax dollars--from legitimate public interests like education, health care and the economy.

      Today is my three-year anniversary at my job -- and my three-year-and-one-week anniversary of moving to Chicago. Mom sent me an email this morning reminding me it's also the 30-year anniversary of her father's death. I barely remember that grandfather -- just that he was jovial and loving, but even those "memories" could be manufactured from the stories Mom and Dad have told me. Nevertheless, I've thought about him all day -- which seems the least I can do for a man who helped ensure I'm here today.

      It's been three days since My First Manicure, and I'm not impressed.  My not-so-cuticles are shredded and bleeding, and my nails are already so long they need to be clipped.  I think I'll forgo such dubious pampering in the future.

      A few observations about training for the Chicago Marathon:  1) Everything hurts. All the time. 2) You spend every waking hour eating, and you sleep like the dead. 3) It's like taking a part-time job. The closer you get to the marathon (and I'm only in week 5 of 16) the less of a social life you have. 4) Your abs look RIPPED, but all the just-for-show muscles you've built up to attract men start to shrink. 5) Your house is always draped with half-sweaty clothes. 6) You go through underwear twice as fast (see "sweaty clothes" in item # 5). 7) You discover that an icy cold soda -- no matter how delicious it sounds -- is not even remotely thirst-quenching. 8) "Runner's high" is a dirty LIE. 9) You learn pretty quickly which energy bars make you gassy. 10) It's hard to fart quietly when you're running.

      It's 4:51 pm (I'm including the time here to try to figure out what to do about the way-off time stamps Blogger is giving me) and I've had a productive day.  I put Arno on the Orange Line this morning at 9:30 so he could head home from his whirlwind weekend visit. (We had every intention of spending yesterday museum-hopping ... but we somehow found ourselves getting manicures and pedicures instead.  It was my first time for either, and I must say my nails look fabulous.) Then I headed to Crunch for a back workout and three miles on the treadmill.  I got home at 1, put in five loads of laundry, headed to Sherwin-Williams for some "Morning Fog" tinted paint, and spent the rest of the afternoon painting the kitchen and running down to the laundry room to check on the progress of my loads.  (Only one didn't dry all the way -- so in addition to a kitchenfull of crap spread all over the condo, there's also wet laundry hanging from every available thing that sticks out.  It looks like a damn tenement in here.)  Tonight at 6 I have a second first date with M., who blew off the FIRST first date he asked me out on.  But he scores high on the Boyfriend Aptitude Test (he's cute and blond and gainfully employed), so he gets a few more chances.  I'm still trying to figure out how to add a few things to this site: Links that create pop-up windows, a few pictures, a mailto thingie and maybe even a hit counter.  Stay tuned.

      It was supposed to rain today, but right now it's just gorgeous out.  Which fucks up our plans totally.  Arno and I had intended to ride out today's storms amid the treasures of the Art Institute, but now that it's so lovely outside we may have to rethink. It's his last day here, and we've had a great time being Chicago tourists together: We took an architectural boat cruise, visited the top of the Sears Tower, scoped boys all over Boystown, saw a gay-ass musical, ate at every restaurant we've encountered and shopped our well-manicured little butts off. Tonight it's show tunes at Side Track. Tomorrow we put him on his plane home and I spend some quality time in the laundry room. Whee.

      It's a hot July afternoon in Chicago. Arno is visiting from NYC, and he headed to Hollywood Beach for some sun and boywatching two hours ago. I opted to stay in and take a nap. But now I'm awake and I'm faced with a bunch of options: 1) Get caught up on last week's Tribunes. 2) Vacuum. 3) Clean the kitchen. 4) Start my own blog.  Option 4 sounded the most complicated -- and the worst new project to tackle when we're supposed to leave for dinner in half an hour. So here we are.

       It doesn't get much better than this.   Sunday morning. Big-band jazz on the surround sound. The smell of coffee. The Sunday  Trib . Strawberries and toast and orange juice on the buffet. Conversation with my folks. Ultimate hosting satisfaction.  Yesterday we played big-city tourists:   urlLink The Museum of Science and Industry , which could use some updating -- and a good scrubbing. People-watching from the sidewalk window of the Boystown  urlLink Chipotle , which is hands-down the best fast food  ever . Reckless Records, where I got a kick-ass recording of Ralph Vaughan Williams'  Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis .  urlLink DSW , my home away from home. Then a moonlit walk along the lakefront and home for small talk in my cool new  urlLink club chairs .

       Take me out.   We had a company outing this afternoon: a Cubs game and then a barbecue in Anders' back yard, which is just a few blocks from Wrigley Field. The game was fun -- the Cubs are apparently very close to some world series-type achievement, so the stadium was PACKED with rabid fans ... which always jacks up the emotion and excitement.   Our seats were pretty far back in the second tier of the stadium, which offered us a sheltered view of the game -- but it also offered the pigeons a handy place to roost directly over our heads. And in the third inning, one of them dropped a HUGE load on my arm and the front of my shirt.  Which sent me -- for the first time in my life -- to the Wrigley Field men's room, the fabled trough farm that approaches mass bladder voiding with assembly-line efficiency.  And the place is  surreal  -- I think I walked past a good 40 yards of pee troughs assembled along the sides of two aisles before I could get to the sinks to clean up.  And once I got back to my seat, the Cubs easily beat the Milwaukee Brewers in a game that ended after the top of the ninth inning. (I've been to two Cubs games this year and they won both times. Coincidence?)  My favorite part of my job has always been my co-workers, and the barbecue after the game only reinforced my happiness with them. They're bright and funny and interesting and fun to talk to, and we sat around laughing and shooting the breeze for a good six hours ... until I realized it was after 11 pm and I was getting pretty damn tired.  Now I'm off to bed so I can get up early and do a ton of laundry and scrubbing and vacuuming and dusting and deporning before my folks get here for a weekend visit.

      Yoga with a minor chest cold and related body aches. Not a good idea.  Especially when J. the dance captain for  The Lion King  doesn't show up for class, even though you saved him a spot right next to you so you could sneak a peek at his sexy feet during downward-facing dog.  It's not shaping up to be a very good day.

       I have created a monster.   Now Bill wants to be mentioned by name here. But (he claims) he rated me a  urlLink 10 , so I guess I gotta acknowledge our friendship.  And it's my pleasure to introduce you to him.  Bill is kind of the first guy I picked up in a bar when I moved here. I'd been to Hollywood Beach that day, see, and I'd gotten myself fried to the point that the people at Red Lobster were trying to put me on the menu. But being new to Chicago and all, I had no intention of letting a severe sunburn keep me from exploring the bars that night. So I went to the Manhole, where you have to be shirtless to be on the dance floor and it's so dark no one can hear you scream when you get bumped on your burn. And that's when I met Bill. But being burned and all, the most intimate I was willing to be with a stranger was the exchange of phone numbers.  And (almost exactly) three years later, we've exchanged gifts, emails, phone calls and stories about our Chicago adventures.  And now he's madly in love with a very cool guy. And I have first (OK -- maybe twelfth) dibs on being his maid of honor.

      So the Iowa visit was great. Leslie and I always have fun road-tripping home together, hanging out with our separate families and then gossiping about our adventures all the way home.  This trip was all about eating and playing with the kids. We devoured Iowa pork chops and corn on the cob, had brunch in the  urlLink Amanas , ate Tomaso's Pizza with Matt and Jeff and Jacob and Scott, and baked cookies that Gunnar kept calling "fresh cookies" every time he ate them. (Does stuff like that mean he's gonna be queer? The jury is still out.)  I also kicked some serious family butt in canasta, but then I got my butt kicked the next day. We usually schedule our games when my niece and nephew are asleep, but thanks to a new Elmo video we were able to squeeze in some quality daytime card-playing as well.  I bought two  urlLink kick-ass   urlLink DVDs , and I may have also bought some fabulous  urlLink club chairs . They're currently on hold while I decide if they'll fit where I want to put them. It's not easy packing comfort and style into my shoebox in the sky.  I also took advantage of the privacy and calm of my folks' driveway to prime and repaint some rust spots on my aging car. It's too dark to perform such cosmetic surgery in my Chicago garage, and I'd hate to do it on the street with cars whizzing by all the time. Grandma would be proud that I'm taking such good care of my things. Even if the thing in question here is one of the  urlLink shittiest cars ever made .

      I'm off on a road trip to the homeland with Leslie.  And my weekend schedule looks to be packed with fun: Cramming in as much play time as possible with my niece and nephew, helping Jeff usher in his 34th year, attending a 50th wedding anniversary reception for Bob and Alo, and endless hours of canasta with my sister, her husband and my folks.   Be good while I'm gone.

       News from the Department of Goddamnit   So I'm sitting in yoga class today, hoping hoping hoping that J. the ultra-hot dance captain for  The Lion King , takes the class too -- and maybe even puts his mat down next to mine. And -- YAY! -- he shows up  and  puts his mat down next to mine ... and I spend the next 45 minutes sneaking peeks at his sexy feet as I bend and twist my way to a better body. And once in a while, I catch him sneaking peeks back. :)  But I'd heard he was dating someone, and I'd given him my number a couple months ago and he'd never called, so I figured he was interested only in a say-hi-when-we-see-each-other-at-the-gym kind of relationship.  So class ends and he turns to me with those dreamy eyes and we make small talk about my running injury and how his show is going ... and suddenly we're making plans to have lunch. Today. And before I can say  I have a lunch date with the dance captain of The Lion King , I'm having a lunch date with the dance captain of The Lion King. And it's going well and we're asking each other questions about our jobs and families and making other pleasant small talk ... and then he volunteers that he's "kind of seeing someone." And THEN he volunteers that  he really wanted to ask me out when we first met .  ACK!  My heart almost catching in my throat, I reminded him that I had given him my phone number a couple months ago, and he said that was about the time that his "kind of seeing someone" romance started getting serious.  CURSE THE TIMING.  Then he told me this amusing story about how  his good friend Cher  was in Chicago recently and the two of them went to see  Seabiscuit  together, but I was still reeling from the news that my silly little fantasy about dating the dance captain of  The Lion King  had not, in fact, been so silly. Or even a fantasy.   Sigh.

      Dinner at my favorite  urlLink fast-food joint  and boy-watching with my favorite homo last night. Paul and I met after work and took the train to the Chipotle in Boystown, where we spent a few hours sitting at the window filling our guts with faux-Mexican goodness and smiling at all the muscle boys who walked by. We're the perfect boy-watching companions; our tastes in men rarely overlap, and when there's nothing to look at we're never at a loss for interesting conversation.  After we'd had our fill at Chipotle, we waddled over to T.'s salon so I could show him off to Paul.  Then it was home to read to the sounds of Rosemary Clooney, Bing Crosby and my rattly old air conditioner.

      It's been 10 days since my last run -- and it's 19 days until the half marathon -- and I'm starting to get antsy. My hip issues are still with me, and even running to catch the bus in the morning is pretty much out of the question.  I did manage to log three miles on the elliptical machine today, though.  And my ass is thanking me for the workout.

       And on the eighth day, we had a good old-fashioned date.   So T. picked me up from work tonight on his motorcycle (WOOF) and we headed for an impromptu dinner at a  urlLink boobie hutch . The food was pretty good, and T. even convinced our waitress to come to his salon so he could rescue her hair.  Then we cruised through town for a bit on his hog (I'll take advantage of any excuse to wrap my arms around him in public) and we ended up at my place watching a  urlLink very cool movie  in our underwear.  I give the evening an A+.

      Holy shit.  These highlights are a total dick magnet. I've gotten more smiles, more stares, more of those look-up-and-down-the-bod-and-then-lock-eyes things -- all from way hot guys -- and more gushing compliments from the girls in the steno pool in the last 24 hours than I think I've gotten collectively all summer.  And get this. So I'm at the cable machines today when a stunning muscleguy in a suit walks through the gym, looks at me, smiles, looks away, looks back, smiles, rinses and repeats, and then does that follow-me-into-the-locker-room head thing. But good things come to those who wait, so I continue my workout and he eventually reappears -- still dressed but not in his suit jacket -- in front of me at the Hammer Strength machine ... and he proceeds to hit on me so aggressively I think I may develop bruises before the day is over. He's just as hot up close, but unfortunately he's covered in bling-bling (and NOTHING screams  desperate man strugging transparently to overcompensate for a small penis  like bling-bling) and he's obviously used to getting his way because he got kind of upset that I wouldn't go take off my shirt for him in the locker room and then cancel my date with T. tonight to be his boy toy. And he walked away in a huff when I finally gave him that  Dude, you're taking this to a creepy place  look.  Repulsive personality notwithstanding, I'd be lying if I said I didn't love every minute of the attention. And now I have a very special thank-you to give T. tonight.

      Call me queer.  I met T. at the salon where he works this afternoon and we decided to drag my barbershop 'do into the 21st century.  So I'm now sporting some sun-kissed highlights and that just-got-laid tousled look.   And I swear I got more looks than normal when I walked up and down Halsted afterward.  Of course, it could have been because of the hunky man I had on my arm.

      After more than two years in my building, I finally used our pool.  Who knew it was so nice? Brian and Dave came over yesterday afternoon, and the five of us headed to the pool and the rooftop sundeck for some afternoon relaxation.  And now I know why my assessments are so high: We have some  gorgeous  landscaping up there.  After a long nap in the sun (under the relentless protection of SPF 45), we headed to Brian's for a Boystown barbecue. T., who doesn't even realize he's undermining all my vows to remain a swinging single, joined us after he got off work.  After a couple hours, T. and I climbed on his motorcycle (WOOF) and headed to his house so he could shower and change. Then it was back to Boystown where I could show him off at a  urlLink chorus  birthday party.  We got back to his house around midnight, just as the heavens opened -- and we enjoyed each other's company by candlelight for a good two hours as the rain pounded outside, then we fell blissfully asleep.  This morning Matt and Jeff joined us for brunch at Nookie's on their way home from a five-day visit. T. and I headed back to my place ostensibly so he could get his stuff for a beach volleyball game, but we got distracted. Now he's  finally  playing volleyball and I'm supposed to be boning up on some music for my chorus reaudition this afternoon.  It was a very good weekend.

      Felled by a headache.  I spent yesterday morning sleeping off headache-induced exhaustion while Jeff and Matt worked out and putzed quietly around the house. I was back to normal by the afternoon, so we went to a late lunch and stopped to check out the  urlLink Male Hide  moving sale. I'm now the proud owner of a Daddy hat.   Last night I saw a better-than-mediocre production of  urlLink  The Women   with Bob, Dave and Steve, and then we joined the boys at Sidetrack for an evening of camaraderie, gossip and boy-watching. We were home at 3, and we woke up today at 11.  Now it's time for Mickey Mouse waffles and another bout of physical therapy on my hip. Two more days until I can start running again!

      Another alfresco dinner last night with Jeff and Matt -- this time at Reza's, which is a short walk through the beautiful neighborhoods of  urlLink Andersonville . We got to enjoy a gorgeous night, great food, fun conversation and the occasional hottie walking by on his way home from  urlLink Cheetah  ... what more could a boy ask for?    Then we met Brian and Dave for some shouted conversation over the music at @mosphere. THAT got old in a hurry, so we headed to Madrigal's instead where it was quiet enough that we could talk ... about the cheesy-ass strippers there.  One was incredibly hot.  The rest were fair-to-middlin'.

      I took a lunchtime yoga class to help heal my not-so-stretchy self.  B. the instructor is pretty cute -- we flirt shamelessly when we see each other out -- and he always takes advantage of every opportunity to provide hands-on correction to my poses when I take his class.   But today I had competition for his affections.  When I got to class, I discoverd that J., the adorable (no -- make that  HOT ) dancer who's in town on the national tour of  The Lion King , was taking class today too. WOOF. And there was a nice open spot right next to him. WOOF again. Naturally, I plopped myself right down for some chatting and scoping. But apparently J. the professional dancer needed a LOT more hands-on yoga-pose corrections than Jake the copywriter did today. B. touched him three times for every one time he touched me.  Gay men can be SO transparent.

Matt, a chiropractor en route to becoming a doctor, worked on my hip flexor (and my hamstrings and my adductors and my spine and my neck) last night and made a huge improvement.  Apparently I -- the trained dancer WHO SHOULD KNOW BETTER -- haven't been stretching enough during all this marathon-training fun. Hence the pain. Hence the limp.  After our little torture session we met Brian and Dave for a delightful alfresco dinner at  urlLink " target="_blank">Firefly , and T. -- who couldn't keep his sexy hands off me, which was kind of embarrassing in front of everyone but I still loved it -- joined us for the hilarious "Match Game" sendup at  urlLink Roscoe's .

      Kelly -- not content being a nameless member of the  urlLink steno pool  -- wants a specific mention in my blog. So here it is. Since she has no blog of her own, I'll include links to some of  urlLink her   urlLink favorite   urlLink sites .

       urlLink Boy Meets Boy  and  urlLink Queer Eye  with Paul and Mike tonight.   The first show is inherently cruel, but it's the first "reality" dating show I've ever deigned to watch -- and I'm FASCINATED.  Train-wreck clichés notwithstanding, the whole thing is a mess.  But some of the boys are totally cute, and I find myself rooting for James to find True Love ... or at least to wrap those sexy legs around someone's neck and let me watch.  And who knew the show's nelliest  urlLink queen  would claim to be straight when he got dumped?  The second show is the best thing on television.  I love Queer Eye -- it makes me laugh, it makes me double-check each morning to make sure I don't have a nose hair problem, and it has already inspired me to exfoliate every day AND paint my kitchen. Gay men have been mocked and teased and told how to act by straight guys for generations.  It's way about time we turned the tables -- and got to be fabulous while doing it.  But the breeders may have the last laugh; the show has become an opportunity for slovenly straight guys to get a bunch of fags to come over and clean their houses for them.  Free.

      How to look like a loser after the first date: Write down his number wrong. Leave three messages on someone else's answering machine. Give the impression that you don't call when you say you will.  Fortunately, T. isn't one to pine away by the phone and jump to drama-queen conclusions.  Yet another reason to like him.

      So T. called me at work today. Twice.  And when I was telling the girls in the steno pool that he's a model, we realized we could probably find his comp cards online -- and we did.  They all swooned.  The news from the Department of Goddamnit tonight is that my sore hip flexor has become a sore whole upper inner thigh.  So my 5-mile run turned into a quarter-mile run with a painful limp back home.  And it's overcast and cool and slightly windy here -- perfect weather for a jaunt along the lakefront.  Goddamnit indeed.

      We are moving way too fast.  But it's FUN.  T. and I had a marvelous lost weekend -- albeit one that involved a party with his friends and inordinate hours wading hand-in-hand through the sweaty throngs of Market Days.  But he's sweet and interesting and fun and way more social than I'd ever hope to be.  And he has beautiful blue eyes.  And then there's that smile.  The smile that melts my cold, cynical heart every time I sneak a look at him.  (And every time I look, he's usually already staring back, smiling at me.)  Did I mention he's a model? And an ex-gymnast? And he has not one but TWO photo albums of him and all the beautiful famous people he's worked with?  And that he drives a motorcycle?  Grrrrr.  Jesus.  Am I in a romantic porno fantasy?  Or am I just projecting WAY too much onto a meet-cute weekend fling?  Either way, I'm having/I've had a great time.  And I'm diving in with my eyes wide open.  And a newfound little skip in my step.

       HOLY SHIT.   So I'm at Market Days yesterday and I run into my friends Bill and Gabe from Miami (because it IS a small world) and we're wandering through the throngs admiring all the hot men and dodging all the dogs and strollers (who brings dogs and strollers to a crowded street fair?) when my eyes lock with a beautiful man standing in one of the booths.  Since we're not able to move very fast in the crowd, our eyes lock a good 10 more times -- and we both get these huge shit-eating grins -- before I'm fully past him. Now, the Normal Jake would panic and keep moving because What If He Didn't Like Me. But I'm getting pretty tired of the Normal Jake, so I -- palms fully sweating -- break away from Bill and Gabe and actually WALK UP TO HIM AND SAY HI. That was Saturday about 3:30 in the afternoon. It's now 9:17 am on Sunday and he just left my place to run to his house and take care of some things, get a toothbrush, etc. -- and he's coming back. :)  And Jesus if he doesn't score high on the Boyfriend Aptitude Test: Doesn't drink.  Check.  Doesn't smoke.  Check.  No drugs.  Check.  Polite to strangers.  Check.  Cool friends.  Check.  Fun to talk to.  Check.  Gainfully employed.  Check.  In a career he loves.  Check.  More of a homebody than a party boy.  Check.  Amazing kisser.  Check.  Decent and kind.  Check.  Total bottom.  Check.  Into me.  Check.  Cuter than all goddamn hell.  Check.   I'm either in the middle of a very fun weekend fling or at the beginning of a very cool romantic adventure. And you heard about it here first.

      I ran my first 7-mile training run this morning and I actually feel pretty good.  I've had some issue with my right hip flexor all week, though -- it's gotten so bad that it's given me a noticeable limp -- and so far it's the only part of my body that isn't too happy with today's run.  And I've started stealing training strategies from people I've run with.  M., the highly disinterested date, makes a game of passing everyone he can when he runs -- especially those who pass him first.  I tried that this morning and was able to overcome a good third of the people on the trail.  Now I just have to discipline myself to throw sprints into my runs -- and stick with them -- to get me to a faster level.   Now I'm off to join Paul and Mike et al. for some  urlLink Market Days  crowds and noise and sweat. Wish me luck.

      It's midnight and I just got back from a fun evening with Dan.  We met after work at my gym and lifted together.  (We followed his Body for Life workout, which shook up what my body was used to and generally KICKED MY ASS.)  Then after a better-than-mediocre French dinner at Brasserie Jo, we caught Sondheim's latest musical, "Bounce," which is in previews here before it winds around the country on its way to Broadway.  The show, which is generally lacking Sondheim's trademark verbal and musical sheen, is nice -- but I don't predict it's going to haul home any awards.  It got its best reactions from our audience over the gratuitously clever set design (like a wedding altar that opens up to be a wedding bed).  And while Richard Kind owns the show, the rest of the cast looks a trifle embarrassed to be in it.  And rightfully so.  The show isn't horrible, but I had expected a lot more from its creators.  And when in my life will I get to see another brand-spanking-new Sondheim musical?  Now it's off to bed so I can wake up early and run 8 or 9 (if I'm feeling ambitious) miles before the Market Days festivities.

      A Single Person.    That's what I'm called on my refi documents.  Not a good tap dancer or an attentive listener or a well-oiled sex machine.  Just A Single Person.  I don't know why that bugs me -- especially since I've seen it all four times I've signed mortgage and refi papers over the last three years.  But I'm all refinanced and locked into a rate that's so fabulously low it needs a booster seat when it eats with me.  And this time I had none of the fuckups that have plagued my mortgaging and refinancing efforts since I moved to Chicago.  At my mortgage closing, the attorney for the developer kept commenting on how hot my arms looked instead of telling me important things about when I needed to get checks to her people.  Then the title company LOST MY ENTIRE MORTGAGE PACKAGE and I had to come in and sign everything again.  My first refi got my tax information fucked up and my taxes got paid TWICE -- which was more than a bitch to resolve with the Cook County Treasurer.  My second refi was calculated using the doubled tax figures from the first refi, and fixing it was so complicated we just abandoned the whole effort and started over.  That was in March, and today we finally got all the numbers checked and the papers signed and the new low monthly payments smiled at.  Whew.

      It's a great night for running. I was going to do only three miles, but it felt so good outside I did five -- and this is after a back/shoulders workout right after work. I'm such a STUD.  But now it's 10:15 and I stink. And all I want to do is crawl into bed.

      So yesterday's date went smashingly well. Great conversation, frequent laughter, easy camaraderie -- and he has a really cute butt.   And I made it to two of the four parties. The first was a  urlLink Venetian Night  get-together in a downtown highrise that gave us a fabulous view of the fireworks in the harbor. The second was a  urlLink chorus  get-together with all its attendant fun. And suddenly it was 1:30 and I was tired. So I went home to bed and slept until 11.  Now I'm off to look at the Venetian Night tall ships docked in the river and the harbor and then catch "28 Days Later" with Bob, Alex and anyone else who tags along.

      I guess I should stop complaining that I never get invited anywhere -- I'm going to FOUR parties tonight. At least I'm going to try to hit all four. They're actually spaced chronologically so I could easily make an appearance at each one.  But they're spaced geographically to make full attendance for me as challenging as possible. Plus, I have a coffee date at 4:30 with the nicest, cutest guy. He's clever, gainfully employed, totally hot, funny as hell, into me ... and HE DOENS'T DO DRUGS. I'm sure it's just a matter of time before I find out he's really a woman or a serial killer or a Scalia fan or something horrible like that.  I had a second date with M. last night. But I need to stop even thinking of our get-togethers as dates. As soon as he got in the door, we picked a movie from my growing DVD collection ("Some Like it Hot" -- which we didn't find to be entertaining in the least), we popped it into the player ... and sat quietly next to each other with our knees BARELY touching for two hours. And as soon as it was over he got up and headed for the door. But he decided he wanted to run with me this morning (and he's a much more experienced runner than I am, so I was just a big, gasping pussyboy dragging him down as he sailed through our five miles), and he talked about cooking me breakfast, but that didn't happen.  Oh, well. Add him to the ever-expanding list of good-catch guys who apparently don't want to be caught -- or even TOUCHED -- by me.

       From playing Pirates to playing Packers in just three days.   Chris, Bill and I met for drinks tonight at a dive bar around the corner from our office.  It was a total guys' night out, complete with beer and salty bar snacks and talk about chicks—except I was always available to help keep things nice and gay.  After Chris took off to catch his train to the suburbs, Bill invited me over to his place to watch the first Bears game in the newly refurbished Soldier Field—which, contrary to popular opinion, I kind of like.  Yes, it looks like a giant toilet bowl/space ship parked inside the shell of the old Soldier Field, but the two elements provide a spirited dialogue between the stately, controlled march of the original columns and the swirling, asymmetrical vortex of the new stadium.  And the ongoing uproar over the renovation has not only underscored the obvious importance of architecture to us Chicagoans, but it's also reinstated  colonnade  into the vocabulary of civil discourse.  Everybody wins!  So Bill, his wife and I sat in their living room all night multitasking our collective asses off: While we used the magic of Picture In Picture technology to watch both the game and the final, gripping episode of  Temptation Island 3 , Bill heated a pizza in the oven, Laura studied for an actuary exam, I tried to develop a meaningful friendship with their new dog, and Bill beat me in a high-scoring game of Scrabble.  (While I racked up an impressive 45-point  quote , he managed to squeeze a whopping  77 points  out of  sizzles .  The bastard.)  Bill and I capped off our evening with a rousing medley of show tunes at his piano.  But the biggest news of the night came when we discovered—after working with each other for five months and working out together five days a week for almost as long—that we have the same birthday.  Who knew?

       Uncle Jake and the 40,000 cheering fans.   My sister and her family got here Friday afternoon for our fabulous weekend together, and we hopped right on  urlLink   the train   —my four-year-old nephew about shit himself sideways from all the excitement—and headed downtown to my office so I could show him off to my adoring co-workers.  Then we went to what I always considered to be a  urlLink tourist trap of a restaurant  at the base of the mighty John Hancock Center—and it was fabulous!  The menu puts delicious twists on standard restaurant fare, and the décor has this Goudí-inspired organic vocabulary that creates a fascinating, otherworldly ambience.  Our tummies happily engorged, we waddled over to the evil consumerist  urlLink mother ship  down the block for some incredulous gawking before we headed home to chat and pull out the couch so Gunnar could have a sleeping adventure.   Saturday ranks as one of the great mountaintop experiences of my singing career: I sang the National Anthem with with the  urlLink Chicago Gay Men's Chorus  in front of 40,000 rabid Cubs fans right before the Cubs clinched their division victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates in a  urlLink frenzied double-header .    I couldn't decide what I was more afraid of as we marched onto the field (through a gate fittingly labeled Q): getting booed (or worse) when we were introduced or becoming disoriented by the sound delay sure to ricochet around the stadium when we sang. But neither nightmare happened. Everyone  cheered  when we were announced, and the sound system made our 90+ voices resonate with a stirring power that sent shivers up and down my spine and tears rolling down my cheeks.  People continued waving and cheering as we left the stadium—and when they passed out the chorus' comp tickets for the game, there were miraculously four left over ... so my whole family suddenly got to go to the double-header together.  My brother-in-law, the quintessential sports-loving straight man, was like a kid in a candy store all throughout what was a historic (and pretty exciting) first game.  Gunnar had enough patience, though, to last only nine innings, so he and my sister and I bought  urlLink Cubs hats  and went  urlLink shoe shopping  while Steve stayed behind to watch the second game with all my gay friends. And when it was all over, the four of us capped off the day with dinner at an Evanston restaurant built in an old firehouse—which all but sent my little firefighter-obsessed nephew over the edge.  This morning, after a breakfast of Mickey Mouse waffles and  urlLink Ralph Vaughan Williams , we headed to the  urlLink Chicago Children's Museum  for more Gunnar overstimulation and quite a few exhibits that were probably more interesting for us than for him. (And while fascinating and surprisingly clean, this museum appears to be a  terrible  place for picking up men.)  Now everyone's gone and I'm left with a quiet house to put back together and some pretty amazing memories to keep me company.

      Yet another late night at work.  Then a date with a hot little muscledude in town from Paris.  WOOF.  I made it home in time for the late rerun of Tuesday's  Queer Eye  -- the only episode so far I haven't seen the first time it aired.  (Hey, you have your hobbies, I have mine.)  Now I'm cleaning and degaying the condo for the weekend visit of my sister, her husband and my precocious four-year-old nephew.  Our weekend plans include the Lincoln Park Zoo, Shedd Aquarium, the Children's Museum on Navy Pier and the simple, wide-eyed excitement of riding the CTA train.  We may wear out the poor little kid, but Uncle Jake plans to have a great time!

       R.I.P. Troll ????–2002   A year ago today my parents had to put Troll to sleep.  Troll was the replacement cat for Patches, the venerable old kitty who lived with us for 19 years and who is buried under the resurrection lilies in the back yard where she liked to hide and watch the world go by.  Our family went catless for a few years after her death, but we eventually missed the feline companionship, and Troll came to join us.  (And by  us  I mean  them ; my sister and I had already moved out by the time my folks adopted Troll.)  Why Troll?  We're Norwegian, see, and there's no better way to honor your heritage than to name your pets after elements of your heritage's culture.  But with us Norwegians, there isn't a rich lode of adorable pet names to mine.  My sister got the best one long ago: She named her cat Loki, after the Norwegian god of mischief.  After Loki, the cool choices drop precipitously.  Personally, I would have picked Lutefisk (a traditional white-Jell-O-looking dish of cod soaked in lye) or Lefse (a potato pancake that looks more like a napkin than a food) as pet names before I would have picked Troll (a generic figure in the folklore of many cultures).  But Mom and Dad liked Troll, so Troll it was.  Anyway, Troll was a pretty good cat.  She was always charming, always friendly and (almost) always willing to be petted when you needed some kitty love to cheer you up.  Her head was installed a few degrees off kilter and she had a HUGE belly and a scraggly little tail, so she was funny-looking enough to be amusing even when she was trying to be dignified.  And she was briefly christened Tickle-Me Troll by Dad during that Elmo doll fad because she'd burp out a cute little meow-purr every time you touched her.  One of my favorite Troll stories:  Mom was having a fussy-little-old lady meeting at the house one night, and Troll managed to jump her chubby little body up on the fireplace mantle, plop down right in the center and start licking her ass with ravenous earnestness as the ladies sat around eating their finger sandwiches and talking of Michelangelo.  But when my niece began to crawl last year, Troll apparently mistook her for feline competition and started peeing all over the house to mark her territory.  My folks tried changing her diet, sprinkling the entire house with stuff designed to dissuade cats from peeing and even putting her on kitty Prozac.  But she wouldn't stop, and her many charms were soon eclipsed by the frustration they got from living in a giant litterbox.  Dad said she pissed her way out of a pretty good deal.  Dad, who always pretended he didn't even like cats, was ironically Troll's favorite in the house.  She followed him everywhere, and he always had to make a place for her on his lap or next to him when he read or watched TV.  He also got elected to take her to her final visit to the vet.  It was actually a pretty devastating day for our family, but we keep her memory alive by reminiscing about what a great cat she was -- and when the house gets particularly humid, we still remember exactly why she isn't with us anymore.  So rest in peace, little kitty.  We miss you.

       A day in the 'burbs   We had a one-day  urlLink chorus  retreat (which is code for  day-long rehearsal in a place far enough away that people will commit to rehearsing and won't be coming and going all day and being disruptive ) today in Oak Park.  We got a lot of singing done, but best of all we had some silly social games that forced us to get to know each other better.  With 150+ members, it's easy just to talk to the people you know at rehearsals and never expand your circles -- and today I had a really good time talking to some of the guys I've been on only a nod-hello basis with.  And now we're best friends forever.  We also had a two-hour lunch break, and one of the chorus members gave us an abbreviated walking tour of the historic  urlLink Frank Lloyd Wright  homes in the neighborhood where we were rehearsing.  The architecture and the neighborhoods are really quite beautiful -- moreso than their photographs lead you to believe -- and it's always refreshing to walk along streets with more empty parking spaces than cars.  Tonight I'm on the party circuit: A new-chorus-member reception in Boystown and a birthday party at Paul and Mike's in East Rogers Park.

      Pizza and an interesting  urlLink DVD  with T., whom I haven't seen in over a week.  About T.: He looked as hot as ever, and we spent the evening wrapped around each other on his couch.  That man is fun to touch.  About Dustin Hoffman in  urlLink  Confidence  : How can a man who mumbles every word he's ever said be considered a good actor? I can't stand him or any movie he's in.  Luckily the movie also featured the disarmingly handsome  urlLink Edward Burns  and the outright  hot   urlLink Brian Van Holt .  Now it's 11:00 pm on a Friday and I'm hitting the sack so I can be up early for an all-day  urlLink chorus  retreat tomorrow.  Have fun tonight without me.

       The payoff.   Remember how I spent all of last week practically living at work getting ready for a new-business pitch?  (In case you lost track amid all my bitching, it was six 13-hour days and one Sunday.)  Well, we got the business.  Woo-hoo!  That  woo-hoo  has a huge caveat, though; while new business is always good for business, this new client looks to be rather boring -- from its dated branding to its limited market share to the yawn-fest of a segment it occupies.  And while I'm sure Cleveland is a  lovely  city, I'm not looking forward to traveling there for concept presentations.

       It's started.   Kelly, who sits across the hall from me at work, has plastered the wall outside her office with Internet photos and bios of all the contestants on  urlLink  The Bachelor  .  And now the entire office keeps crowding around what I'd like to consider to be  my  office's front porch to discuss, analyze and mock the women and what they have to say about themselves (like the improbably named  urlLink Misty 's pride in her "cheerleading, tumbling and dancing abilities").  So far, I have nobly restrained my urges to draw curious disfigurements and patches of facial hair on all of them.

      The team presenting the World's Biggest RFP that kept me living at work for the last week just called to report that the potential client  loved loved loved  our stuff.  Which, in the irony of success, will probably just mean more work for us.  But it's great to be back into life.  Last night I headed up Michigan Avenue after work to visit our newest  urlLink gay store  -- which was actually kind of a disappointment.  (What's with this foo-foo embroidery trend?  Practically everything at H&M was  covered  with tendrils of embroidery.  And that's not good.  If we as a society embrace embroidery, then  International Male  has won.)  Then I balanced my checkbook, played on my computer and watched  urlLink  Queer Eye   with Matt -- who was back from the Mediterranean with some decadent  urlLink cruise  stories to share.  And I have dates tonight and tomorrow.  If anything newsworthy transpires, you'll be the first to know.

No more obscenely late nights, no more scary cab rides home in the dark, no more canceled personal life, no more missed opportunities for after-work shopping on Michigan Avenue.  At least for now.  Whew.  And for thanks, I got a $50 gift certificate and two comp days.   Par-TAY!

       My first stripper buck!   The show went over fabulously well -- despite the fact that we had no technical rehearsals and I had a bitch of a time hearing the piano on the monitors.  And someone even stuck a dollar in my pants while I was singing!  Woo-hoo!  The show was about half drag queens and half people singing live.  The drag queens, of course, always haul in the bucks for their coutured histrionics. We singers are just lucky if we remember all the words.  And since the show was in a bar, the audience wasn't always inclined to listen to the quiet stuff.  My song started out quiet, but by the time I hit my money notes at the end, I think I had every ear open and every mouth shut.  And I think we raised a good chunk of change for our benefit organizations.

       Show Tune Therapy   So my week has royally sucked, but tonight I get to sing on stage at a benefit for  urlLink Chicago House  and the  urlLink Chicago Gay Men's Chorus .  The benefit is a birthday celebration for drag diva Truly Scrumptious -- and it should be a total hoot!  Come join us at  urlLink @mosphere  tonight. Doors open at 7, show starts at 8.  I'll be the one belting Liza.    Wait.  That sounds bad.  I'll be the one belting  a song made famous by  Liza.  And (this time) I'll be dressed as a boy.

       And so it grows.   You know how I've been bitching that I've been working 12-hour days all week? Well now I've been asked to come in on Sunday as well. And when I dared say no,  I got tattled on.   Which isn't really a surprise considering the tattling came from a manager whose idea of motivation involves talking to you like you're a petulant third-grader.  I find it hard to believe that in an economy that continues to generate armies of unemployed writers and art directors, we can't find a handful of new employees -- or even free-lancers -- to pick up the HUGE amount of slack work that's weighing down morale here like cement shoes on a homophobe.

       Life is a Cab-a-Ride   (profound apologies to Kander & Ebb)   One of the perks (?) of working late at my glamorous job is free cab rides home.  I've gotten  four  such perks so far this week -- and it's only Thursday!  Tonight brought an extra special treat: A driver blisfully unafraid to speed, weave, swerve and scream his way through traffic.  When we were almost to my house, a bus driver actually pulled up next to us, leaned out his window and commented unbecomingly on my driver's skills.  Paging Mr. Pot ...

       Two tops don't make a bottom.   So I crawled home last night around 9 and started fixing dinner.  Then my phone rang.    See, there's this guy I've known very casually since I moved here three years ago.  He's adorable.  We've had lunch.  We've flirted shamelessly.  He was in a relationship.  Now he's not.  And now he lives in my building.   He had just gotten home from a long day himself, and he wanted to unwind together with drinks.  He came down with his martini.  We chatted.  We went up to his place because he has a balcony and a MUCH better view.  We chatted some more.  We flirted.  But it was late.  I was tired.  But  sigh .  He sure is cute.

       I picked the wrong week to stop huffing industrial solvents.   It's 6:00 on Tuesday and I've already logged a 21-hour workweek. And it doesn't look like I'll be out of here anytime soon tonight.  Good thing it's goregous outside so I'm not wasting a perfectly beautiful late-summer evening toiling away for The Man.  On the plus side, one aspect of my overwhelming workload is coordinating our company's entries in the international  urlLink Caples Awards . And no fewer than nine of the 20 entries our office decided to submit this year were written by me. So I'm either a rock-star copywriter or a sucker for every potentially-award-winning project that comes my way.  But right now I'm just a stressed-out conjugation queen. Ugh. Good thing  urlLink Queer Eye  is all reruns tonight.

       Summer is officially over.   Last night was the first rehearsal for the  urlLink chorus ' performance season. It was great to see everyone all tan and summer-slim and colorfully coiffed (including yours truly).  And in addition to my usualy favorite eye candy, there was new meat to inspect and flirt with. Being gay can be so much  fun!   Prurient interests aside, it was also great to hear us raise our mighty voices together after our long vacation. Our director always challenges us with spectacular arrangements and creates so much beauty with our raw talents. Plus, he's put his twisted mind to work dreaming up yet another fabulously clever season of music.

      I picked up my  urlLink half marathon  registration packet last night. I apparantly can't cancel my entry, so I decided that since I trained for so long for the race, then damnit, I deserve the T-shirt and the free rice samples and the coupons for the running socks.  Then I hosted the first Big Gay Movie Night of the season. Ten fags. Two spiffy new chairs. Two  urlLink fabulous   urlLink DVDs . And now a refrigerator full of leftover pizza.

       The dream dies.   So the half marathon is in two days. I haven't run in four weeks.  You do the math.  While my hip-flexor injury is slowly getting better on its own (aided, no doubt, by lots of stretching, weekly yoga classes and -- oh yeah -- NO MARATHON TRAINING), it's still a huge barrier to completing little tasks like, say, running to catch a bus.    So I finally broke down and went to the professionals at  urlLink AthletiCo . And when I learned my that  free  initial consultation would be with a male physical therapist, I started entertaining all sorts of porno fantasies.  But they weren't meant to be; the guy was cute enough, but he was wearing one of those fashion faux pas WWJD bracelets.  ACK!  Anyway, it took two cute-ish physical therapists to evaluate me, and they determined that 1) I have severe problems with inflexibility and 2) I should probably see a doctor and get X-rayed because there might be something more that's wrong.  Yay.  In the mean time, I have an illustrated page of stretches I can do discreetly (or so I hope) at my desk.  And a list of sports-medicine doctors to call -- after I figure out which ones are in my insurance network.  Stay tuned.

      J. the dreamy dance captain for  The Lion King  didn't come to yoga today. Or last week. So it's been two weeks since our mini lunch date where we realized our lustful interest was kind of mutual.  Sigh.   At least I'm getting in a more focused yoga workout without him bending and stretching his lithe dancer body so distractingly on the mat next to mine.  Speaking of  The Lion King , here's some interesting  urlLink babboon news .

      My more astute readers have noticed there hasn't been much recent mention of T., the wonderstud I met at  urlLink Market Days .  Fear not, for he's still in the picture.  It's just that our explosive early passion has subsided to a very nice friendship with benefits -- like daily phone calls, shared giggles over potty humor, free haircuts and highlights, and once-or-twice-a-week get-togethers with lots of handholding and laughter and motorcycle rides (woof) ... and other fun stuff.  So things are going well -- but they're not headed in a road-to-boyfriendhood kind of direction.  Which is apparently fine with both of us.

      I suck at this game.  So I go to the EL last night and I walk past a hunky (though young-looking) dude sitting in a sleeveless T-shirt and baggy gym shorts on the platform.  He doesn't even look up, so I keep on walking and I wait for the train at the other end of the platform.  The train comes, I get on, I sit down, I start reading ... and I suddenly notice he's sitting right across the aisle from me.  Which means either: 1) He randomly wandered to the same train I'm on and my imagination's just in overdrive. 2) He followed me 'cause he wants me BAD.  And it definitely means: 1) He's fucking HOT up close.  Then both of us keep "looking" around the train, craning our necks this way and that in a shameless effort to just happen to lock eyes once in a while.  Which we do.  A lot.  Then we get to the part where I have no idea what to say or do.  "Excuse me, but I noticed we seem to be flirting. Wanna see my cock?"  "Dude.  Nice legs.  They'd look great wrapped around my neck."  "Man, it's  hot  in here.  Mind if I take off my shirt?"  The possibilities are endless ... if you're doing bad porn.  Anyway, we get to my stop.  He's momentarily distracted by his book.  I get off.  He doesn't notice until the doors close and the train starts pulling away and our eyes meet once more through the window.  And I lose yet another chance to either: 1) Get harassed for being a fag. 2) Bang a really hot guy.

       Well, we're movin' on up!   We're merging with a sister (more like distant cousin, actually) agency in a few weeks, and since we're moving into their space, we had a party there last night to check it out.  And it's friggin' COOL.  There are almost no parallel lines in the entire place, it's decorated in a riot of colors and textures and shapes, there are just-for-atmosphere video monitors embedded in all the walls, there are tons of interesting places to go and brainstorm -- and the center of the building features this huge nuclear-reactor-shaped cone thing that spans three floors and houses all the vending machines, microwaves and eating areas.  And there's a massive staircase winding around it.  And there's this funky bridge that stretches next to it to connect office areas.  Dude, it's gonna be  awesome  -- like working on a Hollywood set for a movie taking place in a kick-ass advertising agency.  The location couldn't be cooler either -- it's three blocks closer to the train, it's in the middle of a retail/restaurant district, it's two blocks from Michigan Avenue and it's in the same building as a trendy gym.  Woo-hoo!  The only downside:  There were NO hot guys at the party last night.  Which -- I know -- doesn't mean there are no hot guys working there.  There could have been a hot-guys-only offsite meeting last night or something.  But the dark cloud of reality says the eye candy potential doesn't look so good.  (For the record, there were about four cute-ish guys; but the cutest of them was wearing a wedding ring and some godawful Dockers-type getup.  The horror!)

       urlLink Debating American Modernism: Stieglitz, Duchamp and the New York Avant-Garde  at the Terra Museum last night with Bob and Alex.    I've lived here more than three years now and I'd never visited the Terra -- but I was impressed.  It's an interesting space, and the two current exhibits are both thorough and thoughtful in their presentation (one unfortunate misplaced modifier calling Duchamp "an aspiring actress" notwithstanding).  I've never been too excited about Dada, but the Terra exhibit (which features Duchamp's famous "readymade" urinal) does an impressive job trumpeting its merits.  I was more impressed with the machine-age-inspired works in the collection, but then I've always been a sucker for the sleek and the heroic in Deco-era art and architecture.  There's also one unexpected thing I learned from the exhibit:  Duchamp was kind of hot.  The other current exhibit is  urlLink Leaving for the Country: George Bellows at Woodstock , and we entered it from the boring end.  His endlessly bucolic landscapes and portraits got us all but running through the exhibit, but we stopped cold when we encountered his compelling "dynamic composition" portraits overflowing with imagery and allegory and just plain beauty.  And just beyond these portraits hang the stylized boxing-ring lithographs that so heavily influenced Regionalism and the works of Grant Wood, whom I have studied exhaustively from grade school on -- seeing as how I grew up in the town where he worked and I went to the school where he taught.  It was an unexpected surprise to stumble on these works face-to-face after having seen them only in books, and it made our evening o' culture especially memorable.  After the museum, we retired to Bob's atelier for pasta and delicious homemade sauce and admiring comments about his shiny new kitchen appliances.  And, as always, Bob and Alex filled the evening with great stories about their international travels and interesting gossip about hot Chicago boys.

       Judge Elliott has left the building.   Matt and I did a murder-mystery dinner last night.  It was a pre-packaged program where everyone attending was assigned to be either a suspect, a witness or a detective as we all worked to figure out who whacked 1940s mob boss Don Leonardo Linguini.  I was Judge Elliott Witheringlare, Sr., "the finest judge that money can buy" and a victim of blackmail at the hands of Don Leonardo's mistress.  The evening had all the promise of being a totally cool event, but it just didn't work out that way.  Everyone in the room got a HUGE character fact sheet beforehand with way too much info to memorize.  All the suspects had frustratingly similar names like Frank "The Enforcer" Linguini and Carl "The Killer" Linguini, which made it difficult to keep all the characters straight in your head.  We were encouraged to show up in 1940s or even character-specific clothes -- which many did, but one freak-ass family showed up in store-bought Halloween costumes including Scooby-Doo, Spongebob Squarepants and Harry Potter.  There was a really good but really  loud  jazz combo drowning us out as we worked the room trying to chat (yell, really) with other people to get clues and piece together the mystery.  The whole event took place in a private party space in a cheesy Italian restaurant with all the charm and ambiance of a 1960s hospital waiting room.  And the food was  horrible .  There were some funny elements, though.  Since characters were assigned randomly to people as they registered to attend, we ended up with people of all ages and races playing brothers.  Matt, who is black, was a Mexican drug lord.  One guy's elderly aunt was played by a pretty young thing whom he described as "hot" to the whole room when he was being interviewed.  And pretty much every man involved in the mystery was having an affair with the Canary sisters, and the two women assigned to play these paragons of moral turpitude were really good sports about being the butt of every slut joke known to man.  Matt was able to figure out which (Name) "The (Nickname)" Linguini was the killer, but I was totally clueless.  But since Matt was checking out the event as a possible company outing, his office paid for the whole evening -- so my pathetic inability to follow along didn't cost me a dime.  Something odd struck me, though, as we were leaving:  If we were both accused of a real murder that took place last night, would the jury find our ironic murder-mystery dinner alibi plausible?

       urlLink Dan  and I have been on a nodding friendship in the chorus for a long time, but last week we started chatting and we discovered that with my four years singing and dancing in theme park shows and his veritable career on that circuit, we knew a ton of people in common.    So we made a date last night to compare stories, share photo albums, eat pizza, dish about people and gab well into the morning.  The most interesting revelation:  I had a summer fling with a guy in 1988, and Dan ended up dating him for six years.  The funniest:  The creepy old producer of my shows -- whose tattooed-on eyeliner made him look mildly odd when I worked for him in the 1980s -- has become a plastic-surgery addict who now apparently looks like a freakish cartoon of his former self.

       They had me at "whom."   Bob and I took in the second half of the Albee festival last night at the Goodman.   urlLink  The Goat or, Who is Sylvia?   is Albee's latest work -- and, ironically, his most accessible.  While his earlier plays work so hard to achieve his signature level of absurdity and abstraction,  The Goat  is remarkably straightforward ... albeit straightforwardly absurd.  It involves the destruction of an otherwise happy family when the husband and father admits to carrying on a love affair with a goat, and Albee's deft handling of such a bizarre premise makes it easy for audiences to divorce themselves from its manifest absurdity and more acutely examine the underlying dynamics of love, betrayal, anger and friendship.  True to form, Albee fills the script with enough cultural and historical imagery to make any humanities teacher scurry to an encyclopedia, and he has a grand old time playing with language.  His characters here, moreso than usual, are scholars and dilettantes, and their deft wordplay offers even deeper layers of enjoyment and enrichment as the story plays out.  One of the great ironic juxtapositions in the play's construction is the raucous humor the wordplay provides over the epic Greek tragedy playing out in the character's lives -- especially with the wife.  In my favorite scene, as she's struggling to come to terms with her husband's revelation, she keeps stumbling over the appropriate pronouns to use in reference to her sudden rival, the goat: she? it? her?  It's impossible to do the scene justice here, but it's safe to say I've never laughed so hard over the word  whom  in my entire life.  The Goodman production is excellent, with special notice going to the actress playing the wife and mother.  Her fall from upscale wife to destroyed cuckold is the stuff of Greek tragedy -- and her performance is nothing short of spectacular.  Bob and I started our evening at a rather forlorn little hotel  urlLink restaurant  with an ambitious menu, decent food and a pretty cool view of the Chicago River.  But it was waaaaay more expensive than the online review led us to believe.

       Rats!  I mean Lions!   I haven't seen J., the dreamy dance captain who's in town for the national tour of  The Lion King , since that fateful day two months ago when he confessed his romantic interest in me and then told me he had a boyfriend.  So guess who shows up at the gym today, looking all sexy and being all touchy-feely friendly?  Sigh.  Apparently the boyfriend thing is still going well for him.  And apparently he's still very happy to see me.  And apparently I'm still a little bit crushed by all of this.  On the flip side, he said he could get me house seats for a  Lion King  performance.  (Now all I need is a date who can understand that my heart lies with the lithe dancer in the porcupine suit on the stage.)  And he said he wants to come see the  urlLink chorus  show I'm helping choreograph.    Best-case scenario:  He sees how talented -- and datable -- I am, dumps his boyfriend, offers me a job in his show, and we dance off into the sunset together, hand-in-hand in our matching porcupine suits.

      The  urlLink chorus  sang tonight at an induction ceremony for the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame.  The event was held in a smallish ballroom in the beautiful beaux-arts Chicago Cultural Center, which I've always wanted to check out.  And I wasn't disappointed.  What an amazing building!  Apparently the hall of fame thing tonight was a Big Deal.  The press were there.  The mayor was there.  And so was Ian, a member of a tight-knit group of friends that adopted me when I moved here three years ago and apparently divorced me last year.  I hadn't heard from or seen any of them since an awkward bump-into-on-the-sidewalk encounter early this spring -- so it was especially ironic that when I got home tonight there was a letter in my mailbox from my mortgage broker with a $50 gift card to thank me for referring Dan, another member of that group, to him.  Water under the bridge.  I lose some friends I never really felt comfortable around, I get a $50 dinner courtesy of my mortgage broker, I get to sing in front of a roomful of homos.  Everybody wins!  Anyway, in between Ian and Dan I got a surprise mini-date with the ultra-dreamy and always-fun Scott.  He and I ended up standing next to each other on stage tonight, and after the concert we decided to hit the big sale at Field's -- where I got two kick-ass new shirts and a funky pair of jeans -- and then grab dinner at Potbelly's.  Then we sat by each other on the train with our legs pressed tightly against each other.  A quick peck on the lips at his stop, though, and it was all over.  Sigh.  Now I just have to decide which shirt to wear to work tomorrow.

       It's gorgeous out.   Dan wanted to go blading along the lakefront after work, but it was almost dark -- and kinda windy -- by the time we got home.  And neither of us had been on our blades all summer.  So we wisely decided to take a long walk instead.  We headed up to the Armory so Dan could get his meningitis inoculation, and we stopped for delicious Oreo McFlurries on the way.  After we said our goodbyes on this balmy October evening, I chatted with my folks for a half hour and then collapsed in front of the TV for a gory show about  urlLink autopsies , then the news and then yet more ice cream and some mind-numbing Leno jokes.  Now I'm all fat and happy and ready for bed -- though I have visions of sawed-off ribcages and ladles of stomach contents and cross-sections of brains dancing through my head.

       A shot in the dark.   There's been a minor outbreak of  urlLink bacterial meningitis  among gay men in Chicago this week.  Six cases have been reported; three men have died.  And apparently that's enough to get the Chicago Department of Public Health concerned -- it's set up free vaccination clinics all week in all the gay neighborhoods.  So tonight after rehearsal, at least a hundred of us from the chorus marched down to the Boystown location to be vaccinated.  The line was out the door and down the block, but it moved pretty quickly -- and the volunteer staff was organized, friendly and efficient. A quick release form and a virtually painless shot later, I'm apparently protected for the next three years.  But I go to bed tonight grieving for the unnamed victims of this outbreak -- and for their families, who lost loved ones to a rapid, painful death.

       $620 TIMES TWO!   Our office team walked this morning in the five-mile  urlLink Making Strides Against Breast Cancer  event that took us up and down the lakefront between the museum campus and Navy Pier.  The day was gorgeous, and (last I heard) there were 40,000 people participating in the walk.  I raised $620 in pledges from my family and friends -- which comes to a whopping $1,240 thanks to my company's dollar-for-dollar matching pledge.  I don't know what our team raised in aggregate, but I'll let you know as soon as I hear our final numbers.   Part of the event involves a tribute wall you can decorate with pink ribbons customized with the names of people touched by breast cancer.  I bought ribbons for my mom, both grandmas, my sister's mother-in-law, a dear family friend and all the women mentioned by the people who sponsored me.  Both of my grandmothers survived their breast cancer and died of other causes, and everyone else in my life touched by breast cancer has beaten it.  Mom is celebrating 15 cancer-free years this month!  After the walk I headed across town to  urlLink Alcala's Western Wear  to get a real cowboy hat.  I've wanted one of my own since I wore a fabulous one in a show years ago, and a recent article in the Trib profiled a guy at Alcala's who is known for expertly sizing and shaping hats to fit every face and head perfectly.  And the article was right. I bought a black wool Stetson that looks so kick-ass on me I want to sleep in it, and I bought an ultra-cheap straw beater hat I could maybe wear  urlLink line dancing  and not worry about losing it. So I'm now the proud gay owner of two authentic cowboy hats.  And to celebrate getting both of them on sale, I stopped at my favorite  urlLink Mexican restaurant  for a tasty barbacoa burrito.  Mmm!  And as I write this, I've learned that the giant spider outside my window doesn't like ladybugs.  And that ladybugs can escape from spider webs.

      Take every character cliche known to man, add the most predictable feel-good-movie-of-the-year plot, throw in a goofy premise that just might work and even have a couple characters learn a few Important Life Lessons along the way ... and what do you have?  Only the funniest movie I've seen in a long time.  We had a writers' night out after work last night, and after yet another disappointing dinner at  urlLink Heaven on Seven , we howled our way through the amazingly funny  urlLink  School of Rock  .  On paper, this movie should have ranked right up there on the funny scale with the  urlLink Ernest  franchise, but thanks to some really clever performances and some truly inventive jokes on top of the really tired old ones (like the effeminate little boy whose favorite singer is Liza Minnelli)  School of Rock  really works.  It probably didn't hurt that I was sitting next to Bill, whose laugh alone provides added value to the price of admission.  And I just wouldn't be Jake if I didn't mention the amazing hotness of the actor playing Spider, the replacement guitarist who shows up when Jack Black's character gets voted out of his band.  You'll understand when you see him in his all-hotpants-and-nipples Battle of the Bands outfit.  Grrr.

      So yesterday morning at 10:00 I found out I had to make a speech at our 4:00 staff meeting about a successful client presentation we'd just done.  We call these monthly speeches our "creative showcase," and there's increasing pressure to make them, well, really creative.  My first instinct was to write alternate lyrics to "We Will Rock You" and chant my presentation to a clapping-colleague drumbeat, but that seemed like a lot of work.  My second plan was to write everything in a cheesy Dr. Seuss cadence -- and it actually turned out kinda cute.  Observe:   Oh, we are the bankers with a product that's slow. It should be a winner in our PORT-fo-li-O.   The poem was a hit when I showed it to the creative team a few hours before the staff meeting.  And when I mentioned my earlier "We Will Rock You" idea, we discovered that Dr. Seuss and Queen's  thump-thump-CLAP  go surprisingly well together.  (Go ahead -- try it.)  And this is how "We Will POP You" was born.  (For those of you not in the biz, POP is short for Point of Purchase.  We were showing the staff some POP signage and support materials we'd developed for a very happy client.)  Everyone in the company seemed to love the song, but it didn't hurt that everyone was well-lubricated on champagne to celebrate the fact that we won two new clients in the last few weeks.  After work I met Bob for a great  urlLink Star of Siam  dinner.  Then we headed to the Goodman Theatre for a fascinating production of  urlLink  The Play About the Baby  , which is part of the Goodman's Edward Albee Festival.  I fell in love with Albee when I first read  Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?  in college, and I've tried to read or see everything of his since then.  He's such a master of language and of exploring reality (and imagined reality) through absurdity and logic.  And beneath the highbrow facade of his work lies a wickedly twisted, angry mind.   The Play About the Baby  employs devices like the unnamed and ultimately destructive visitors from his  The Lady from Dubuque  and characters like the outwardly strong but inwardly helpless Honey (and the never-seen child) from  Virginia Woolf , but it breaks new ground exploring the use of distraction (how close can you pay attention when a stunning naked man runs across the stage during the high point of a monologue?) in the search for truth.  Enough exegesis. The play is fascinating, engaging and pleasantly disturbing.  And if you get nothing out of the play, the hot naked  urlLink man  (with his tiny little waist and his perfect nipples) is worth the price of admission alone.  But isn't he always?

      All-you-can-eat fish and chips tonight at  urlLink Duke of Perth  with Mike, Paul, Rich et al.  I don't eat a lot of crappy food, so all that deep-fried fish is sitting in my gut making me feel sick as a dog right now.  I think we'll have our next get-together somewhere that serves milk of magnesia.  After dinner I met up with Tim so we could start planning the branding and marketing (and naming) for his new salon.  He likes the name Lather.  I'll check on its availability tomorrow.  I got home in time to watch the last three innings of tonight's game -- you know: the game where the Cubs got their asses whupped and their World Series dreams killed.  And if you think it was ironic that the Cubs were even in the National League Series, consider this:  I actually sat at home and watched it.

       Jake's Celebrity Weekend!   Yesterday it was my afternoon romp with the self-involved Calvin Klein underwear model.  Tonight it was my evening with Jason Priestly at the gala premiere of his campy new movie,  urlLink  Die, Mommy, Die  .  We got free tickets for the premiere last night at rehearsal -- and Jeff and I went because hey, free movie!  I'd also heard  Die, Mommy, Die  is funny, and it really is.  It's an intentionally (I hope) schlocky  homage  to overwrought 1960s family dramas complete with a scenery-chewing faded diva (in this case, a man in drag), hilariously bad dialogue and lots of convoluted plot twists.  And -- BONUS! -- there's a ton of homoeroticism ... and two cute actors (Mr. Priestly included) and two mega-hunky extras who show more than a little skin.  We didn't realize Jason would be in attendance when we snatched up our free tickets, but there he was, standing all of his three feet tall at the back of the theater.  And when the Q&A started after the movie, he was just as dumb as I'd imagined he'd be.  (It didn't help that he was fed some stoopid questions by the audience, including the requisite gee-you-sure-are-brave-to-kiss-a-man from the requisite stoopid breeder who apparently didn't realize she was sitting in a room full of homos.)  And to be honest, I probably wouldn't have even recognized Jason (I call him Jason) if he sat next to me on the bus.  He's pretty short and he had a lot of facial hair, so he just looked like a cute-ish scruffy guy.  And his handlers whisked him away in a private car the moment the Q&A session was over, so I never got a chance to examine him up close.  He's now officially the second really, really famous celebrity I've been really, really near to -- after my Whoopi Goldberg encounter in LA almost 10 years ago.  So I'm getting more and more connected in Hollywood.  The day wasn't all peaches and beans, though.  I went to my friendly neighborhood True Value Hardware this afternoon to return a dead phone battery I'd bought there six days ago.  Unfortunately, this True Value has a five-day limit on its return policy.  And besides, the woman behind the counter patiently explained to me, they couldn't take it back anyway because  the package had been opened .

       Remember that Calvin Klein underwear billboard?   The one that appeared in Times Square in 1982 and revolutionized the way underwear was marketed to men?  Remember the model in that ad?  Remember how hot he was?    He still is.  I met him this afternoon.  He's no rocket scientist, but he's pretty to look at.  After making myself feel relatively ugly, I got to audition dancers for the  urlLink chorus  Christmas show.  I’m choreographing a big disco number (Mrs. Claus and the elves singing “Don’t Leave Me This Way”) and a soft-shoe number called “Tapping Paper” that features -- yes -- huge rolls of wrapping paper cavorting in tap shoes all over the stage.  Then we had three hours of rehearsal.  Then I went to Las Mañanitas with Keith, Keith, Steve, Jim and Jeff. So instead of running the Chicago Marathon, I filled my day with retired underwear models, disco magic, show tunes and a gossipy dinner with friends.  I'll chalk it up as a success.

      I ran five miles this morning.  And the only thing that hurt when I finished was my right calf -- so I'm cautiously thinking my hip injury is all healed.  But -- for a beautiful Saturday morning -- the lakefront path was awfully empty.  I find it hard to believe the entire Chicago running community is resting up for tomorrow's marathon.  But I've never been much in tune with the group think that seems to influence the rest of the world.  I spent the afternoon downtown with  urlLink Rad , a total cutie I met on the Atlantis Mediterranean cruise last fall. He's in town for a conference with some (hot!) colleagues.  The five of us putzed around the North Michigan Avenue shopping area and then ate at some cheesy-ass diner that served the worst omelet I've ever choked down.  Bleah.  Then it was off to a 10-year anniversary party for Sean and Christopher.  Now I'm too tired to live.

      Bob and I have acquired an expensive little habit: way-too-frequent dinner-and-theater outings.  But they're fun!  This season's crop of theater started last night with a spectacular Joffrey production of John Cranko's 1962  Romeo & Juliet  set to Sergei Prokofiev's lush post-Romantic score.  I'm a huge Joffrey fan, but lately the company has seemed unpolished and downright wobbly in performance.  In fact, I switched my ballet-company allegience to the Hubbard Street Dance Company after seeing its mind-blowing spring repertory concert this year, but after last night I'm squarely back in the Joffrey camp.  I had never seen Cranko's setting of  R&J  (actually, I don't even recall ever hearing Prokofiev's score) -- and I can't remember ever seeing the Joffrey perform in Chicago to a live orchestra -- so the evening was a pretty amazing experience.  Cranko's narrative is strong and broad and manifests a deep understanding of both classical ballet's idealism and modern dance's iconoclasm. The Joffery's set for the production is magnificent -- and versatile enough to frame every scene in the ballet with just a few lighting and prop changes.  And (I'm going to sound like a big old theater queen here) the sumptuous costumes -- especially at the Capulets' ball -- caused audible gasps in the audience.  And the dancing.  Wow.  It was exuberant, poignant, thoughtful, moving ... and still fresh and interesting 40 years after it was created.  And I would be gravely remiss if I didn't make special mention of the ass on the  urlLink dancer who played Mercutio .  Sigh.  It's enough to get me back on the squat rack at the gym.  To counterbalance the overpowering stench of homosexual rapture, the house manager gave Cubs/Marlins scores at both intermissions last night -- and since the Cubs spent their entire game kicking the Marlins' collective ass, everyone in our audience cheered.   Quel butch!

       They're he-e-e-e-re!   The city is suddenly crawling (limping?) with runners here for Sunday's Chicago Marathon.  I can spot them a mile away -- with their gaunt eyes, hipless hips, expensive running shoes and lean, sexy legs.  While this was supposed to be my first marathon, I'm actually not upset I won't be running it.  My summer-long training taught me a lot about myself, my limits and my capabilities.  And one thing I learned is -- at least at the moment -- I really don't have the passion to go through with an entire marathon.    I'm thrilled to report, though, that my mysterious tendon injury is all healed and I'm running again completely pain-free (except my knees are a little sore).  And I have every intention of running my first half-marathon next summer.  And this time, I  won't  forget to stretch.

       Fighting the benefits of yoga one suppressed giggle at a time.    Our yoga class always ends with the instructor sitting in front of us in the lotus position bathed messiah-like in a warm spotlight.  We all take a moment to collectively ponder, and then he says  namaste , we say it back and class is over.    Bill and I weren't sure what  namaste  means, so he looked it up and found this definition: "I honor the place in you where Spirit lives. I honor the place in you which is of Love, of Truth, of Light, of Peace, when you are in that place in you, and I am in that place in me, then we are One."  Of course, now Bill always says  namaste, motherfucker --which undermines my well-earned Being One at the end of class.  Today, as the instructor was gently reminding us that yoga isn't a competition and that we should just hold our poses where they're comfortable and focus on our breathing, he said, "If you can't extend your leg all the way in this pose, it doesn't mean you're a bad person, and  it doesn't mean you're bad at yoga ."    I started laughing as I was struggling to straighten my front leg, hold my arms out like some injured heron, stare contemplatively at my chosen spot on the floor and float my other leg in its position of serenity.  I hear next week we'll start class with a midget joke.

       10,000 Mile Checkup   It was slow at work yesterday, so I decided it was a good time to head to the doctor's for a look under the hood (as it were).  Unfortunately, my doctor has gotten too popular, and it's always a bitch to get in with him.    Fortunately, I'd met a new-on-the-market doctor this summer who was conveniently located, intelligent, capable, in my insurance network, accepting new patients—and gay.  So I paid him a visit yesterday afternoon, we dished about my sex life for a while, and I walked out a quart low on blood and covered in band-aids.  (And I got to pee in a cup!)  I also got a flu shot while I was there, so in addition to my blood-loss-induced wooziness, I have that I-just-got-a-flu-shot malaise today.  Now I'm looking for some heavy machinery to operate.

       The old boy's still got it.  Though it jiggles in a few places he doesn't like.  I ran today for the first time since that fateful August day when I made it barely across the street before having to limp home to months of physical therapy.  And I got in a full four miles tonight—which pleased me to no end.  Thankfully, there was no sign of pain in the hip that has caused me so much trouble over the last two months ... but my knees sure weren't liking the workout.  I'm on a mission to get back to my fighting weight ASAP; Manuel is going to take some physique shots of me just as soon as my abs reappear.  So I've been carb-free since 5:03.

       Four Fags at Six Flags   Day two of Jake and Dan's Weekend of Fun found us at Six Flags with Matt and Steve.  It was Matt's company's private corporate day at the park, so the lines were relatively short, and the day was packed with adventure. Our first adventure was the new  urlLink Superman–Ultimate Flight —the roller coaster where you get strapped into your seat, the floor drops and you get rotated 90 degrees so you're stomach-down and ready to "fly" through the ride's many twists and turns.  The ride is spectacular, but  it broke  while we were riding it.  The breakage didn't affect our flying experience, but when we got back to the loading station we were left hanging (literally) face-down over the staging area for a good 20 minutes until the pokey ride engineers waddled up to fix it.  And since it was kind of cold, I had a runny nose. So I left a bit of a puddle by the time we were rescued and able to stand vertically again.  We spent the rest of the day doing the usual amusement park stuff: riding all the cool roller coasters, eating really crappy food, scoping out the small handful of cute guys in the park and playing Whack-a-Mole.  And I experienced my first bungee jump.  Daredevil Dive, as it's called at Six Flags, isn't your typical bungee experience; you strap yourself into a body bag-type thing before you get hooked to the cord (saving a step later in the process should things go wrong) and—I guess we didn't learn our lesson on the Superman ride—you're suspended face-down before you're hoisted about a million miles in the air.  Then you pull your own rip cord, plummet to almost certain death, and swing in the wind whooping and screaming like a big girl.  (At least that's how I did it.)  And since it was cold and windy and I was strapped to Dan as we jumped, I got major skydiving flashbacks through the whole experience.  And now we're all psyched to jump again next year.  We left the park at 4 and raced back to Chicago so Matt and I could make it to  urlLink rehearsal .  We now have all the music for our Christmas show, and I got assigned to choreograph a tap number and a disco number (you know—like they did at the first Christmas).  After rehearsal I hit  urlLink Ping Pong  with Shawn and Rich for some fabulous pan-Asian fare.  Then I had the brilliant idea to catch the Red Line home at the Addison stop.  You know:  The one right by Wrigley Field.  On the night the Cubs beat the Braves in their first post-season NL Division Series win since 1908.  So I got to cap off my day with a ride on the Drunken Fan Train.  Woo-hoo!

       Big Fag Day   I got up at the ungodly weekend hour of 6:30 this morning to roadtrip with Dan to his old Indiana stomping grounds—and we spent eight full hours shivering our asses off together watching some amazing performances at the 2003 District Marching Band Festival.  We both have long and distinguished high-school marching band careers; I played trombone and mallet percussion, and Dan played saxophone and eventually became his school's drum major (a title I never got to claim because I was "too valuable" as a musician, even though one of our chosen drum majors marched like a deranged Muppet and commanded about the same level of respect, but I'm not bitter).   A few observations about marching bands, then vs. now:   1) I remember marching band being about pride in our skills and good-natured competition among our city's schools.  Now it seems to be a blood sport.  2) Our drum majorettes wore cute little drum majorette outfits complete with epaulets and tasseled boots.  Now the majorettes literally wear evening-length couture complete with opera gloves and velvet capes.  3) When I was in high school, the bands programmed their field shows around themes like famous musicals or Latin music.  Now they do abstract "concept" shows inspired by obscure emotions and march to the 5/4 nightmares of Gustav Holst.    4) I don't remember our band parents being as rabid as the parents I saw today.  (See observation #1.)  5) I also don't remember spending gazillions of dollars on props and set pieces and matching marimbas ... and all that couture. (See observation #2.)  Frozen extremities notwithstanding (does prolonged shivering count as cardio?), we had a great day, and I was repeatedly amazed by the talents (and manifest dedication) displayed by the musicians and color guard members we watched.  Best of all, we spent the 2+ hour drive each way singing along with Bette, Barbra and a host of show-tune CDs.  We were going to cap off the day with Jake and Dan's Night of Raunchy Leather-Bar Hopping, but we're cold and tired—and we exchanged a ton of CDs we want to burn to our hard drives.  (Barbra is being ripped as I type this.)

      Last night started with a fabulous  urlLink dinner  with Matthew from the chorus, then we retired to his equally fabulous Gold Cost condo for a couple hours of conversation over sparkling water and designer chocolates.  Mmm!  I got home late and slept until 11—so it's a good thing I took today as a comp today as payback for some long-ass hours I put in at work a few weeks ago.  It's rainy and cold and generally crappy outside today, which makes it an ideal day to stay in and valiantly struggle to organize five years' worth of photos and clippings and reviews into the pile of photo albums that have been gathering dust in the corner since I moved here.    You'd be amazed how many pictures of cats I found.  I haven't had a cat in three years.

      VERY garlic-y pizza (which is a good thing) and a  Queer Eye  rerun last night with  urlLink Paul  and his roommates Brandon and  urlLink Mike , who popped in and out as we sat enthralled for like the seventh time by the gay magic of Butch's transformation.  This afternoon I go in for a preliminary evaluation to see if I'm a good candidate for LASIK surgery—even though paying for it is really just a pipe dream.  Maybe I could have a bake sale.

       Home   The holiday trip to Iowa was great -- throat-aching, snot-dripping cold notwithstanding.  We played tons of canasta, bonded with the niece and nephew, ate like fiends, and sneaked away in twos and threes to discuss Christmas gift ideas.  We even ordered  urlLink my favorite Cedar Rapids pizza  Saturday night and gorged ourselves like Rush Limbaugh in an opium den.   I also managed to make a Home Depot run with Jeff and Matt to get all the stuff I needed to move three light switches to make room for my fabulous new  urlLink wall hanging .  And when I finally lugged all my new electrical stuff, patch kits and borrowed tools home today, I called the antiques dealer to make the formal purchase ... and the hanging had sold  yesterday .  Shit shit shit shit shit.  Oh, well.  I guess that just means more shopping ...

       Braving the crowds   So normally I'd avoid all shopping districts like the plague they are on the day after Thanksgiving -- but I decided today that it might be a fun way to run into friends while I'm home for the holidays.  I was only marginally right.  Jenny and I ran into two friends today -- one I didn't care to see all that much and one I'd seen just a few weeks earlier.  But we did get some Christmas shopping out of the way.  Which is always nice.  And we've been playing canasta like  fiends  since we put the kids to bed yesterday.  Steve and I beat Mom and Jenny last night amid mountains of cookies and assorted leftovers, and today I kicked the pants off Steve and Jenny in a long three-handed game.  I rock.

       Thanksgiving in Iowa   So dinner today was fabulous, and we had more than the whole family here: Mom, Dad, my sister, her husband, my adorable niece and nephew, Dad's sister Nancy visiting from Denver, and our family friend Gingie.  And now everyone is safe and healthy and happy ... and incredibly full.  And my cold feels like it's on its way out.  I feel so blessed today I could just pee.  The drive home last night was  almost  uneventful.  The traffic reports had been grim all day, and I kept hanging out at work waiting for the all-clear that never came.  I finally took off at 7:00 (mostly because the garage closes at 7:00 and I'd probably lose my car for the whole holiday weekend if I didn't leave before then) -- and I was pleased to discover that the roads were reasonably empty and miraculously fast-paced.    So I just sailed along, driving responsibly (as always) and listening to all my favorite CDs (but not singing along as is my usual custom because my damn throat still hurt) ... when suddenly -- in lowly Clarence, Iowa -- my rearview mirrors were filled with the flashing lights of a self-righteous small-town cop.  Now, I haven't had a speeding ticket since I was in college (in the late 1980s, for those of you keeping score at home), and I haven't had an accident since probably 1993, so I figured my nearly spotless record would speak volumes for my character -- especially when I found out I was going a measly 38 in a 30-mph zone -- and I'd get off with just a friendly warning.     And I was right.   So not only was the cop reasonable and polite and properly deferential to such a model citizen as I, but he was also pretty hot.  After checking all my paperwork, he told me to drive carefully and wished me a safe journey home.  I tried my best to convey  thanks  and   see what happens when you're a good citizen 99.99% of the time?  and  I'm single and you have my name and address, you handsome copper  you  all in one smile as I drove off.    I don't know if he got all that, but I did make it home safely. Just like he told me to do.

       Ugh.   Somewhere between getting on the train downtown last night and getting off of it in my 'hood, I managed to develop a cold.  It's just a sore-throat-general-malaise kind of thing, but it's decidedly  not  what I need before a 5-hour drive tonight and an extended holiday visit with the family.  In any case, I'll be relaxing in Iowa with the world's cutest niece and nephew for the next few days.  I may or may not update the blog while I'm there.  And you'll just have to find a way to soldier on through the uncertainty.

      So yesterday was another 11-hour day of horrors at work. And it was colder than  shit  in Chicago.  So when I got home all freezing and exhausted late last night, I decided to make some broccoli and cheddar soup from a gourmet mix I got at my friendly neighborhood Jewel.  Nothing like the wholesome goodness of soup to fix what ails you, right?  Apparently not until after you've cleaned up the gloppy mess that happens when the soup suddenly boils over onto the stovetop, the counter, the front of the oven and half the kitchen floor.  ACK!  And once I got  that  mess cleaned up and I was pouring what was left of the soup into my bowl, a little glop of it splashed up and hit the back of my finger, raising a goose-egg-size blister that makes its presence known every time I tie my shoes, backslap my bitch or try to use a writing implement.  So much for soup's mystical curative powers.  Anyway, I finally had my bowl of warm cheesy goodness, and I plopped down in front of the TV to flip channels and eventually land on the train wreck they call  urlLink  Average Joe  .  And of course, I was immediately hooked.  Our intrepid heroine was wise to cut the  urlLink creepy Hispanic guy  -- especially since he sobbed like a schoolgirl at the news.   But if I were she, I would have definitely spent more time with the dreamy-yet-slightly-immature  urlLink Evan Marriott lookalike .  Woof!

       My second emissions test and my third famous person!   Saturday was a big day for me.  It started at the Illinois emissions testing facility, where my (sometimes) trusty old Neon passed with flying colors.  The last time I took my car in for the tests, I think it took almost three hours from getting in line to receiving my diploma.  So this year, armed with tons of reading material and a fully charged phone battery so I could fill my time productively, the testing process took little over 10 minutes.  I used the bonus time to take my car in for an oil change before next week's Thanksgiving road trip to Iowa.    But you're not reading this post to hear about my auto maintenance; you want to hear about all the rich and famous people I've been rubbing elbows with.  But first, I need to mention that the  urlLink chorus  sang an hour of Christmas carols at the kickoff of the Michigan Avenue holiday parade this afternoon.  We had no sound system, and we were sandwiched between a marching band and a small brass choir.  So nobody could hear us.  And it was kind of cold.  And we could barely hear each other -- so it was probably for the best that nobody on the sidewalks could hear us either.  I guess participation in this festival was a Big Deal.  I'm looking at it as a once-in-a-lifetime experience -- because I'll never do it again.  So on to the famous people.  Here's the rundown of my famous run-ins so far:    1) Whoopi Goldberg  at a ribbon-cutting for some children's outreach facility in inner-city L.A. about 10 years ago.  I was there with a friend who worked at the facility, and I got my picture with Whoopi to prove it.   1.5) Scott Weiland , the drug-addled lead singer for the Stone Temple Pilots, on the treadmill next to me at Crunch gym about three years ago.  He gets only half a listing because I didn't know who he was at the time, and to this day I still don't care.   2) Jason Priestly  at the Chicago premier of his new movie,  urlLink  Die, Mommie, Die  , a couple months ago.  The director stood up before the movie to thank us all for coming, and he pointed out the still-hunky Jason, who was standing in the back of the theater.  I almost swooned.   3) Megan Mullally  singing at a fund-raiser concert for the  urlLink Northlight Theatre  tonight in Skokie.  She sang wonderfully, and the high-price tickets included the opportunity to meet her at a reception afterward.  Unfortunately, the reception was mobbed by theater volunteers, and I never got a chance to get close to her.  But I made a point of getting close enough that I could see her face and say we shared the same public space -- if only for a fleeting moment.  Now it's late and I'm tired and I'm off to bed.

       Bob and Jake's Great Theater Adventure continues!   Tonight we saw a pretty amazing production of  urlLink  The Lion in Winter   with a pretty first-rate cast.  The production is all but literally in the round; the set is a large X in the middle of a square room with chunks of seats in each corner -- so we as audience members can watch the show AND the rest of the audience at the same time.  And therein lay the problem tonight.  You see, a good three fourths of our audience comprised a busload of kids from a Catholic high school from the burbs.  And while  The Lion in Winter  isn't racy by any means, it shows adults kissing -- Henry II gets affectionate with his mistress Alais, and he gets downright smoochy with his wife Eleanor.  Which is apparently waaaaaay too cringe-inducing for children raised in the make-believe world of Catholic school to watch.  And then when Prince Richard and King Philip share a kiss, fuggetabout it -- the Pope's blessed children giggled and snorted like they were at a goddamn Ace Ventura movie.  I almost pinned the kids' teacher to the wall after the show and told him on no uncertain terms that he was henceforth allowed to bring his kidlets to nothing more representative of the real world than  Cats , but I figured the insult would be lost on him.  I mean, really -- it's one thing to subscribe to a mythology that insists the entire world is heterosexual and homogeneous and oblivious to your enduring immaturity in the privacy of your own church or school or home, but to bring children indoctrinated in such nonsense out into the real world where they can embarrass themselves and irritate everyone around them is both rude and ignorant.  And if this were truly an educational outing, you'd think any teacher smarter than a size seven soap dish would read the play first and either warn the kids that it didn't march in lockstep with the narrow-minded viewpoints of the almighty Church -- or just keep the kids home where they could watch videos about ... oh, I don't know ... supernatural beings who walk on water or  Davey and Goliath  or goddamn bunnies frolicking in a fucking meadow.  Repeated audience distractions notwithstanding, we really enjoyed the show, and we capped off our evening with drinks at both  urlLink Sidetrack  and the new  urlLink Caribou  on Halsted before heading home to crash.

       I love being gay.   I really do.  Yesterday, after yet another horrifyingly stressful 11 hours at work, I headed over to Matthew's house for a just-us-girls spa night.  It was Matthew's idea, and I had NO idea what to expect.  I was thinking cheap mud masks and those strips that pull gunk out of your nose pores and maybe some scented lotion on our elbows -- all available in the discount aisle at our friendly neighborhood Walgreen's.    But Matthew is a certifiable spaholic, and he has a cupboard just  bursting  with high-end spa products. And it doesn't stop there -- he also has electrical contraptions and special teas and even heated lava rocks.  So our evening played out thusly:  1) Shower and don loose pajama bottoms 2) 15 minutes on a chi machine shaking my legs back and forth, loosening my joints, settling my bowels and giving me a funky endorphin rush when it ended 3) Five-step chemical face peel followed by delicate little pats of eye cream 4) Foot soaking in pans filled with lava rocks, boiling water and some menthol-scented additive 5) Yummy tea 6) Foot spritzer and lotion 7)  urlLink Chinese takeout  and a  urlLink weepy chick flick    And the whole treatment worked miracles on my tired old self -- even though I'm still kind of emotionally drained from my workweek, my skin looks fabulous!  I'd never seen  urlLink  An Affair to Remember  , though, and I wasn't too impressed.  When it wasn't giving us endless Meaningful Glances, it was trotting out little Negro children to entertain us with their Amazing Negro Dancing Abilities.  Add not one but TWO dumped fiancees who are kind-hearted and understanding and supportive -- and throw in such oversensitivity to the handicapped as to render them unmentionable in polite society -- and you get an understanding of my disapproval.  To top it off, Deborah Kerr's extensive couture is anything but fabulous -- though she's almost as beautiful as Cary Grant's grandmother's scenic Italian villa.

       I did a bad thing.   I told M. about my blog.  When I started this blog, I made a mental note not to tell two groups of people about it: my family (because sometimes I talk about  s-e-x ) and the men I think I might go on dates with (because you  have  to dish about your dates on your blog).  But I wanted to impress M. with my breezy, conversational writing style and the effortless flair that punctuates all my posts -- so I told him about it in those first few emails after we met on Monday night.  And he clearly read it right away, because he talked about my writing and the content of my Salon  urlLink profile  in the very next email he sent me.  (Which, when I think about it, shows a certain level of interest on his part, no?)  Anyway, now I can't gush on and on about how much fun we had on our date tonight.  Or how cute he gets when he talks about  Hamlet . Or how nice his butt feels when my hands wander south as we kiss.  'Cause he might read all about it ... and it's probably kind of creepy to see your delightful evening analyzed on a blog posted for all the world to see.  So if you are M., stop reading right now.   Speaking of all the world, I have no idea if  anyone  outside my immediate circle of friends reads this.  But if you do read this and I don't know you, I have one thing to say:  Hi!  (And I had a date tonight with this really cute guy and we had a great time.)

      A pirate walks into a bar.    The bartender says, "Hey, pirate! You've got a steering wheel sticking out of your fly."  The pirate says, "Aargh!

      So  urlLink show tunes  was fun last night.  I hung out with some  urlLink chorus  boys, ran into friends ... and even met up with a hot (and intelligent and literate and did I mention hot?) man I only kind of know (so far, at least) -- and we have a DATE tomorrow night!  More to come ...  Tonight was the first new episode of  urlLink Queer Eye  in goodness knows how long -- and Dan, Matthew, Paul and Phil came over to watch with me.  Now I'm watching the Nightline coverage of today's Massachusetts Supreme Court gay marriage decision.  And wondering how big it might backfire on us in the hands of politically connected religion addicts.

       When Step Groove goes bad.   So Anders and I decided to take a step aerobics class after work tonight.  And though I haven't taken a class in a couple years, I've logged more hours in aerobics classes over my life than most Republicans have spent convincing themselves that "hate the sin, love the sinner" is a logical way to think.  So I was kind of excited to get back into the groove, as it were.  By the time Anders and I got there, the class was so full there were only a couple spots left for our step benches: way in the front or way in the back.  I was tempted to take a prominent spot in the front because, hey, I've taken tons of classes before.  And hey, I'm a dancer.  Hell -- right now, I'm a  choreographer .  I can rock no matter where I stand in class.  Right?  For some reason, we decided to stay in the back.  And about five minutes into class, I was profoundly thankful.  First of all, it's a pretty advanced class, so the combinations came at us quickly and complicatedly.  And second, the class is full of regulars who already know the combinations -- or at least the instructor's basic vocabulary.    So for about 15 minutes I kept up.  And then my brain reached critical absorption.  And  then  my crappy new deodorant gave out.  So for the last 35 minutes or so I was that stinky clueless guy who just takes up valuable space on the gym floor.  But a little humiliation now and then can keep you grounded.  I am, however, going to head to  urlLink Sidetrack  tonight so I can belt out show tunes loudly and clearly so everyone can admire how I know all the words.  And most of the harmonies.

      So the weekend guests have come and gone, and I'm  exhausted .   urlLink  The Producers   was fun on Friday night, but not as amazing as I'd expected.  And our last-minute seats were in the very back row of the upper balcony -- where you just can't look rich and connected no matter how much DKNY you have on.   Saturday was all about shopping and eating, and I waddled home at the end of the day with three new shirts, two new pair of shoes and a new pair of jeans.  The jeans are those intentionally-dirty-looking things I've been hating since they first started appearing on hipsters half my age a couple years ago.  And suddenly I'm wearing them.  (But they look fabulous with my new Skechers!)  I'm such a goddamn lemming.  After shopping all day Saturday with Mom, Kay and Mary, I abandoned them at 6 to entertain my metrosexual cousin Chris, who was in town for a conference.  We shopped on north Michigan Avenue for a while and then headed up to Boystown for a fabulous dinner among the cultural cognoscenti at  urlLink Ping Pong .  He had an early flight home the next morning, so after dropping him off at his hotel I headed over to a fabulous little cocktail soiree at Matthew's Gold Coast condo.  And by the time I tumbled into bed, I was one tired puppy.  Sunday morning Mom, Kay, Mary and I had brunch with Pat, Dana and Rob -- even more Iowa-based friends who were visiting Chicago this weekend.  After a couple hours of catching up, everyone hit the road for home and I hit the laundry room and choreographed some more disco to teach at  urlLink chorus  rehearsal last night.  Now I'm at work avoiding my professional obligations and looking all trendy and shit in my new threads.  Dig me!

       Bob and Jake's Big Theater Adventure Continues   Tonight we saw an amazing production of  urlLink  The Taming of the Shrew   at Chicago Shakespeare Theatre.  I'm not sure I've ever read or seen  Shrew  all the way through -- though I (no doubt shittily) played Petruchio in the seduction scene in a Shakespeare showcase waaaaaay back in high school.   The production at Chicago Shakespeare Theatre moves the play from Renaissance Padua to rich-people-in-the-1960s Padua, and the transition works really well -- including some chronological shifting of scenes, the addition of some mood-setting original music and a complete rewrite of a monologue to involve a description of Petruchio as a bad-boy biker.  It doesn't hurt that the set, costumes, musicians and cast are first-rate.  Best of all, the  urlLink actor  playing Petruchio is a complete hottie AND he frequently bares a lot of skin and even gets completely wet in one scene.  Bonus!  True to form, I fell in love with him -- and we will continue to court until I fall in love with the next sexually confident, beautifully sculpted naked man in the next play I see.

       My precious little niece turned two today.   I wish I could have been with my family for her birthday party.  Apparently she wore a black velvet outfit I bought for her last winter -- but I'm not a very observant uncle, so it didn't fit her until this year.  I tried to make plans to drive out to Iowa to be there, but scheduling was difficult -- and I'll be there in a few weeks for Thanksgiving anyway.  I can't wait!  While she's certainly not conversational, she's a good mimic -- and, with a little prompting, she was able to say "thank you" and "outfit" and "I love you" to me on the phone this evening.  I was grinning so loud she could probably hear it.  Anyway, it's hard to imagine there are children in this world who are more loved than my niece and nephew.  Those lucky little kids have the constant attention of a patient stay-at-home mommy, grandparents who would do anything for them (and who live only four blocks away, so they're often called upon to do that anything) and an extended-family network of love that stretches from the Pacific to Lake Michigan.

       Ugh.   I got to work through my lunch workout  and  through a  urlLink chorus  rehearsal last night.  So I went to bed feeling a little fat and irritable.  But not before I ordered a fabulous new  urlLink tissue dispenser  for my bathroom.  Now all I have left to do for my bathroom makeover is:    > pick a paint color (or two) > paint > pick a new sink, faucet and vanity > install the new sink, faucet and vanity > pick a new mirrored medicine cabinet > install the new mirrored medicine cabinet > pick cool new indirect lighting > install my cool new indirect lighting > pick new towel bars > install new towel bars > have my "do not flush toilet while train is in station" sign framed > hang my newly framed "do not flush toilet while train is in station" sign  and then I'm all done!

       A weekend at Shangri-Lodge   We're back.  And we had a BLAST.  Some highlights:   Friday   We get to the cabin around 8:00 after stocking up on groceries at our friendly neighborhood Jewel.  The cabin is small but cheerfully decorated in early antlers -- all macho and hunter-like but with a fabulous gay flair.  After unpacking and shooting the breeze for a while, we order a $25 pizza (who knew pizza was more expensive outside the city?) and play two games of Cranium.  Nick and I beat Dan and Phil both times -- even though I can't draw a toupee with my eyes closed and Nick can't remember the name of Beethoven's  Ode to Joy .   Saturday   Day one of sleeping in.  Breakfast of fried egg sandwiches and juice.  Then a nice drive into Lake Geneva for some touristy shopping and chocolate eating.  Urp.  After coming home to clean up, we meet up with Dan and Mark at their MASSIVE and totally cool new lodge (which would make a great setting for a wilderness-themed circuit party).  We arrive just in time to catch the total lunar eclipse from their back yard, and then we head out for an awesome dinner (boeuf au poivre ... mmm).  Then back to the lodge for hot tubbing, cat-petting and gossip.  Very fun night.   Sunday   Day two of sleeping in.  I could get used to this.  Another breakfast of fried egg sandwiches -- this time with the sausage and bacon we forgot to make on Saturday.  Then Dan beats my ass at Scrabble on the sun porch while Nick and Phil take a walk around the lake.  At 2:00 we meet up with the Dan-and-Mark Dan for some antiquing in nearby scenic Woodstock.  I almost buy a totally cool 27"x72" Bacchus lithograph-looking print for my front hall, but when I get home I find out it won't fit where I want to put it unless I move three light switches.  Damn.  And I was all ready to fork over my $250.  I have to see how complicated the switch-moving would be ...  Now I'm home with a fat-distended belly and smoky  everything  'cause it's leaf-burning season in Wonder Lake.  And we can't wait to go back!

       urlLink Dinner  with Matthew last night.  (For those of you keeping score, that's two delicious Chipotle dinners in a row.)  I was all set to branch out and order something other than what I've always eaten every time I've been to a Chipotle, but I couldn't bear the thought of not having yet another barbacoa burrito made to my specifications (black beans, green salsa with a bit of tomato, yes to the optional sour cream and cheese).  And if those giant burritos didn't make us fat enough, we stopped by a cute little patisserie around the corner afterward and stuffed our guts with French pastries.  Mmmm!  Then I waddled home to finish folding last weekend's laundry in front of  urlLink I Love the '80s Strikes Back  and pack for my manly weekend with Dan, Nick and Phil.  We'll be camping out for three days in a well-appointed "cabin" in some vaguely woodsy area somewhere northwest of the city.  The road trip begins at 5:30 tonight.  You're in charge while we're gone.

      Stood up.  By a goddamn  urlLink 25-year-old .  No biggie, though; I expected as much 'cause he hadn't returned my emails in almost a week.  And he never gave me his number.  Kids these days ...  So when Rick called this morning with free tickets to a show tonight, I said yes -- I had a pretty good feeling I'd have my night free anyway.  And the evening was a blast.  To start off, I got rock-star parking half a block from the theater.  Then we had dinner at my favorite  urlLink restaurant .  Then we saw  urlLink  Straight Up with a Twist   -- Paul Stroili's fabulously hilarious one-man show about his lonely life growing up as a gay heterosexual.  The show has been around much longer than the term  metrosexual , and Paul (I call him Paul) even included a bit about the difference between metrosexuals (straight men who wear their hearts on their sleeves) and what he calls himself: a renaissance geek (a straight man who makes sure that sleeve is  ironed ).    The best part was the game show that involved two hapless audience members getting called up on stage to answer questions only a renaissance geek would know.  And guess who Paul singled out from the entire audience?  And guess who won by knowing you should never wear a double-breasted jacket unbuttoned?  (Actually, IMHO, you should never wear a double-breasted jacket  period  -- but then again, I don't have my own one-man show.)

       Three things to report.    1) No cavities.   I had a dentist appointment after work.  Now my teeth are shiny clean and my conscience is clear for yet another six months.   2) Deep discount Kenneth Cole.   My dentist's office is in Watertower Place, so after my checkup I headed down a floor to the Marshall Field's men's department for a quick look-see.  And I stumbled home with two kick-ass shirts: a $56 muscle-hugging ribbed camp shirt marked down to $6.97 and one of those gay-ass patterned dress shirts marked down from $69 to $8.97.  I don't understand the precise calibrations that brought about the 97-cent suffixes on those prices, but now I can look like a status-whore fag boy without compromising my party-drug budget.   3) Wet brakes.  After a November day filled with downright tropical weather, the heavens opened up while I was shopping.  And when my bus reached the Foster tunnel under Lake Shore Drive, we encountered a pretty impressive flood.  The cars that made it to the bottom of the exit ramp were crossing the lagoon via the sidewalk, and when our bus decided to forge ahead in the street -- amid the raucous cheers of the passengers (whose lives are obviously devoid of any legitimate excitement) -- water came gushing in under the doors.  And the bus' brakes were still making ungodly groaning noises when I got off three stops later.  But I made it home safely.  And after almost three hours of   urlLink I Love the '80s Strikes Back , I'm ready for bed.

       Yawn.   Last night was going to be a quiet little evening at home ... until Matt called and invited me to join him for show tunes at Sidetrack.  Of course I said yes.  And of course, once we got there we ran into a bunch of guys from the chorus.  So for four hours we sang with the wild abandon of queens who know all the words -- and all the harmonies -- to all the show tunes ever written.    But I didn't get to bed until after 1:00.  And now I smell like a goddamned ashtray.

       Night of a thousand birthdays   Last night after the chorus birthday party gig, I headed home, changed into something a little more sexy than my overstarched dress shirt, packed my car with leather drag (just in case -- I've been in a leather-bar mood lately and I haven't been to any of Chicago's fine leather establishments in at least a year) and headed to a double birthday party for Patrick and Matthew.  Since the party was on All Saints' Day, it had a St. Patrick and St. Matthew theme, complete with ultra-rich angel food and devil's food cake.  But by the time the party wound down, I was too tired to go stand around in a bar -- and my cake-distended belly wouldn't have looked good poking through the front of my leather vest anyway -- so I skipped the Cell Block and the Eagle (though the Eagle was just around the corner from the party).  I got home late enough that I ended up sleeping until NOON.  And I spent the afternoon doing six loads of laundry and choreographing "Don't Leave Me This Way" for the chorus Christmas show.  (We'll have a drag Mrs. Claus and 10 gay elves singing it to Santa.  Just like at the first Christmas.)  The combination ended up looking pretty awesome, though it was pretty hard -- but my elves learned the whole dance break in one hour of rehearsal tonight.  Now I'm all sweaty and gross and I'm faced with the prospect of sullying my fresh clean sheets.  And I think the sheets are gonna lose.

       ROSS:   Sylvia is ... a  goat .  Who you're fucking!   MARTIN:   Please, don't say that. [beat] [beat] [beat]  Whom.   I had to do it.  I had to see  urlLink  The Goat or, Who is Sylvia?   again before it closed at the Goodman.  Such an amazing play.  Such an amazing cast.  Such an amazing use of the English language.  Kelly and Joanne from work came with me this time.  And afterward, we discussed the show and indulged in steamy office gossip as we marinated in the pesto-drenched atmosphere of the neighborhood  urlLink Corner Bakery .  After that I met up with a good chunk of the  urlLink chorus  to sing a command performance for the 90th birthday of the aunt of one of our major donors.  We rocked.  The elegant  urlLink University Club  on Michigan Avenue rocked.  And one of the hunky gay (and no doubt wealthy) partygoers even deigned to smile at me.  Rock on!

      So Halloween was fun.  It started first thing in the morning when I put on my sexy new cowboy hat and tottered off to work in my seldom-worn boots with my little pan of brownies decorated to look like a graveyard.  Our office Halloween party started around 1:00 and included a good five hours of eating, drinking and -- yes -- karaoke.  (You haven't lived as a homosexual until you've belted "Stand By Your Man" in a cowboy outfit in front of a conference room packed with inebriated co-workers.)  After work, Dan, Nick, Phil (as Wolverine -- the only other one of us not too chicken to dress up) and I met up for pizza and headed to Boystown to watch the parade.  Unfortunately (fortunately?) the crowd was too thick to see anything so we headed into Sidetrack where it was warmer -- and there was a constant loop of gay boys parading around the bar in their Halloween finery.  While we were standing around gawking, I managed to start talking with Neil, a guy I've been wanting to meet for a good three years.  Fresh out of a relationship, he was amicable and chatty enough that I thought we'd get to know each other  a lot more  before sunrise.  He even volunteered that he was going commando -- a fact I assume is usually mentioned only in the context of a gay seduction.  Turns out, though, that he was only making conversation.     Sigh.     But after three otherwise wasted hours, he did give me a ride home. :)

      I'm back from an awesome holiday week with the family.  But it's good to be home.  And I've been busy since I've been back: - I painted my front hall.  (Well -- ALMOST painted.  I got everything done but the closet door and then I ran out of paint.  And the paint store is closed today and tomorrow.  And the accent color I bought is waaaaaay too dark, so I have to buy something lighter when I'm there.  But I'm almost done with this project.  Right?) - Before I painted, I installed dimmer switches on a bunch of lights.  I was going to move three of the lights to the back of the wall they currently occupy, but the switch box I bought was deeper than the wall -- and when I got all the electrical stuff torn apart, moving everything looked like waaaaay more work than I cared to undertake. - Paul and a friend from SF came over this afternoon to watch my new  Pirates of the Caribbean  DVD, but the special features menu was fucked up so we could watch only the movie.  What's the point of having a DVD if you can't watch the bloopers and the deleted scenes? - I've covered my condo with rarely-worn clothes in an attempt to decide what stays and what goes.  It's hard to part with my children, but I refuse to let my stuff occupy more room than I get to live in.  Now I'm off to a housewarming/NYE party at Terry and Kent's.  See you next year!

       Guys' Day Out   Gunnar and I spent our first afternoon together today.  And we packed in a lot of fun:  Smiley-face pancakes at Village Inn, paint samples from Shirwin-Williams (a stop that was more for me than for him), sticker shopping at Michael's and a (very cheap) matinee of  Brother Bear.   He's such a good little kid, and playing Uncle Jake all day gave me such a profound sense of happiness.  But when he's all strapped in the back seat of my car and we're driving around town, suddenly every other driver on the road is a blazing maniac and I'm a white-knuckled little old lady.    A kid's love and trust can sometimes be  exhausting .

       If I didn't get up to pee once in a while ...   ... you'd never know I was alive.  Yesterday I sat through a weepy WWII Esther Williams/Van Johnson flick on cable with my dad,  The Haunted Mansion  with Jeff and three hours of Trading Spaces with my mom.  I did, however, get off my flabby white ass long enough to run three miles in Iowa's unusually balmy December weather.  I ran through my old paper-route neighborhood and admired all the magnificent houses I was too young to appreciate when I was younger.  And I took four laps around the track at my high school, but nobody came out to cheer me on or welcome me home.  Sigh.  Today we're enjoying the rule of It Always Happens in Threes:  Mom and Dad blew a fuse or something that affected a large portion of the house, the brakes went out in Dad's van, and Jenny and Steve woke up to water dripping from their kitchen ceiling.  It looks like my work here is done.  They'll be glad to have me gone when I head back to Chicago tomorrow.

       Another day at the mall.    Mom, Jenny, the kids and I hit the sprawling Coral Ridge Mall today to redeem gift cards, take advantage of after-Christmas sales, entertain the kids and mock Midwestern hairstyles.  And I came to the realization that, aside from a new dining room table, there's really nothing else in the world I need to buy.  Except a baseball cap with ear flaps on clearance at The Gap.  Just $3.99.  Tonight we continue Conspicuous Consumption Tour 2003 at our friendly neighborhood Outback Steakhouse, where a big poochy tummy and a flabby white ass wait excitedly to come home with me.  In the mean time, you get to hear how cute Anna is.  She's just two -- and just learning to say meaningful words.  She's taken to calling me "Uppa Jake," and she likes it when I swing her "uppa down."    I know.  Isn't she just  brilliant ?  Couldn't you just  die ?

      The after-Christmas mob never really materialized here.  Mom, Jenny and I hit Lindale Mall this morning to take advantage of all the sales, and we left with armloads of stuff and absolutely zero crowd frustration.  And now I have all my 2004 calendars  and  next year's Christmas cards -- all at half price. Woo-hoo.  Best of all, I ran into some long-lost friends and got caught up on gossip from my old job and from my old theater company.  Now it's off to play Uncle Jake and eat all the Christmas leftovers before they go bad.  Not a bad life...

       A bellyfull of Christmas cheer.   I made it home safely, and we had a wonderful Christmas eve/day as a family -- it was filled with our traditional Norwegian dinner (and traditional Norwegian dinner leftovers the next day), lots of music, lots of canasta, some snuggly naps and two  very  excited children.  The little doctor outfit I got Gunnar and the Disney Princesses dress-up set I got Anna went over extremely well, and I got a pretty nifty-ass mixer for my already-packed kitchen.  (Someday I may even learn to cook.)  Tomorrow we'll hit all the after-Christmas sales in the hopes of scoring bargains -- and of running into people I haven't seen in ages.  Now it's time to put the kids to bed and play even more canasta.  Pardon my smiley emoticon, but it's been a very merry Christmas indeed.  :)

       All packed and ready to go.   I'm off for a four-hour drive and a six-day holiday visit with the family.  I didn't get all my presents wrapped and I have no idea how my plants will survive for a week in this dry weather, but I'm sure the holidays will be spectacular nonetheless.  Stay tuned for detailed reports of all the cute things my niece and nephew do, every game of canasta we play, and all the friends I see while I'm home.  Have a great Christmas!

       So the first day in the new office went well.   I scored a couch and a refrigerator from the leftover-furniture pile, so my new home away from home is looking more and more like a home.  Which might not be so bad when I'm stuck at the office working advertising magic until late in the evening.  So far my only complaint here is all the ambient noise.  There are no completely enclosed offices and there is a manifest dearth of carpeting -- so conversations and ringing phones and high heels on cement floors and slamming drawers and music all waft around the building in a cacophony of distraction.  But the space is too cool, the neighborhood is very downtown Chicago, I'm now a block away from  urlLink my favorite fast food  and my commute is waaaay more convenient, so I'm pretty psyched about working here.   If only we could get ourselves some more exciting clients ...

       It's hard to believe it's been 15 years since Miriam was murdered.   I still remember December 21, 1988, with amazing clarity.  Dad had picked me up from college and we'd had a nice chat on the drive home.  It was a cold, crisp day, so we were surprised to see Mom standing in the driveway without her coat when we pulled up.  As we got closer, we realized she was sobbing.  A month earlier, she'd had a mastectomy, and she was in the beginning of many rounds of chemotherapy for her breast cancer, so I assumed she'd gotten horrible news about a biopsy or something.  I raced to her to hug her, and through her sobs, all she could utter was, "Miriam's plane went down."  Miriam was a friend of mine who had just finished a semester in London under the auspices of Syracuse University.  I'd been out to visit her for a week over Thanksgiving, and we'd had an awesome time touring museums, seeing shows and exploring the city together.  I hadn't realized she was flying home that day, and I was surprised to find out Mom knew not only her flying schedule but the plane she was on.  We went inside and turned on CNN -- which was in its infancy -- to watch the first grainy images of the wreckage of Pan Am flight 103, which had just hours earlier come crashing down in fiery pieces over Lockerbie, Scotland.  And over the next few weeks and months as the evidence pointing to a terrorist bomb emerged in the media, I numbly started experiencing the bizarre dichotomy of a personal tragedy playing itself out on the world stage.    In the years since, I've befriended Miriam's parents and friends, and I've written many pieces about my perspective on the bombing that were published in newspapers and scholarly journals and read on NPR.  And I've found myself at times emotionally hardened against horrible tragedies and at other times bursting into tears over Kodak commercials.  It continues to be an emotional ride, but I've gradually stopped treating the anniversary of Miriam's murder with solemn reverence.  In fact, I spent six hours today unpacking and organizing my new office in our cool new downtown building.  Then I spent the evening folding, stuffing and stamping 200 Christmas letters.  And for the first time since the bombing, I didn't call or email Miriam's family on the anniversary.  I didn't even watch the news for any special 15-years-ago-today coverage.   Am I forgetting her?  Am I "moving on"?  Am I growing callous?  There still isn't a week that goes by where I don't think about her repeatedly, so I'm pretty sure I'm not letting her memory fade -- but I've grown comfortable enough with the loss that I'm clearly not overcome by it every year on the winter solstice.  And I guess I'm OK with that.

       My feet hurt all the way up into my womanly parts.   So last night's Christmas-drag-mandatory birthday party was a  blast  -- once I finally picked an outfit.  I'd previously purchased this plum evening-length thing with a clingy metallic bodice, but it wasn't fabulous enough.  Then during yesterday's errands I stumbled upon the perfect top: a clingy winter-white fake-cashmere sweater with fake marabou around the neck and wrists -- the perfect foundation for the woman who has no clue what her clothes say about her.  I also got some kick-ass heels at DSW: black suede with demure straps and wicked Cruella points.  Keith lent me a saucy black skirt and I added a hideous glass-grapes-with-angel-head ornament on a chain and a poinsettia napkin in my wig, and Heidi Holes was all set to spread Christmas cheer as only she can.   So about 12 of us tottered into  urlLink Pepper Lounge  in our heels and fake bosoms last night and just took over the place.  It's funny how everyone wants to chat you up when you look like a tragic hooker with a bad case of linebacker shoulders.  And after much eating and drinking and picture taking, some of us tottered off to Sidetrack to show off our finery, and we all eventually crashed at Keith's to de-drag and rub our tired feet.  Who knew Heidi and I would have so much fun?  Who knew heels that look so fierce could make your feet hurt like they've never hurt before?

       Unexpected fun   I was supposed to see  urlLink  Urinetown   with Richard last night, but he got the flu and had to cancel.  I mentioned my suddenly free evening to Kelly at work, and before I knew it, she and Marty and I were embarking on an evening of adventure.  Check out all we did:  1) Madly finish packing everything in our offices 2) Stop at Marty's so he could walk Lola, his beautiful greyhound 3) Have pizza and salad at  urlLink Piece  4) Giggle our way through  urlLink  Elf  , a silly, dorky, rather predictable but endlessly funny holiday classic-in-the-making 5) Stumble upon a FREE indoor parking lot in Lakeview (woo-hoo!) 6) Meet up with Anders, Chris, JP, Carl, Jimmy et al. at a funky little Lakeview straight bar  7) Crawl up a block to another straight bar curiously packed with homos 8) Collapse in bed around 1:00  Now I have a mountain of last-minute holiday errands to accomplish today before I get ready for a double birthday party for Jim and Jeff tonight.  The mandatory dress code is holiday drag, and I don't have a  thing  to wear.

       Moving Day.   The office is moving today (and all weekend) into a kick-ass new space four blocks north of where we've been for the past three years (and we'll be waaaay closer to shopping, transportation, more shopping and the newest franchise of my  urlLink favorite fast food emporium ).  Woo-hoo!  So today is all about checking off our lasts:  - Last status meeting in our ugly conference room - Last look at our spectacular views of the Wrigley Building, the Jewelers' Building, the western skyline and the the northern neighborhood where we're about to move  - Last pee in the short urinal - Last whiff of the scary old fridge in the kitchen - Last workout at the tired old gym across the street - Last 25-cent soda from the cheap machine that unfortunately isn't coming with us  Fortunately, the only thing that will change about my commute is the considerably shorter walk between the EL and the office.   And speaking of the EL, I had another one of those almost moments on it this morning.  I got on and immediately locked eyes with this really handsome guy -- the kind whose effortless beauty comes from good genes, a good fitness ethic and what appeared (in a romantic-first-impression kind of way) to be a genuinely good soul. He was in his early 40s with short salt-and-pepper hair, an earnest smile and an obvious mutual interest in me.    Of course, I did what any moron would do and I sat directly in front of him so we couldn't make eye contact or strike up a conversation or anything else you'd expect a single person with common sense to do in that situation.  When he finally got up to get off the train, our eyes locked no fewer than 10 times, and he even stood on the platform as the train pulled away so we could smile at each other once more through the window.  But then again, there really is no graceful way for two people to subtly strike up a conversation on a crowded commuter train without a roomful of people listening in on your little mating ritual.  And besides, he was smaller than I am, so we couldn't share clothes.  It would never have worked out.

      After another long day at work yesterday, I strolled my way up Michigan Avenue -- picking up last-minute gifts along the way -- toward Matthew's fabulous Gold Coast condo for a nice little holiday get-together.  As usual, he'd decorated to the nines and the food was delicious.    And we watched my all-time favorite  urlLink Christmas movie  -- though the more I see it, the more hokey it becomes.  It's filled with implausible plot holes, egregious continuity errors and some of Irving Berlin's weirdest songs. Dean Jagger (who plays the general), despite his impressive resume and many awards, gives one of the worst performances in the history of cheesy cinema.  And Vera-Ellen, bless her heart, is all grotesque and misshapen --  urlLink imdb.com  says all her high-necked costumes were designed by the incomparable Edith Head "to cover her neck, which was aged beyond her years due to her eating disorder, anorexia."  But Rosemary Clooney and Bing Crosby sound spectacular together, the candy-colored sets and costumes are always a delight to see, the dancing boys are all hot, and Mary Wickes still makes me laugh Christmas after Christmas.

       If it's Monday it must be show tunes.   I met up with some chorus boys last night at Sidetrack for boywatching and show tune singing.  The place was PACKED too -- mostly with straight women who are so achingly trendy they hang out at gay bars on Monday nights.  There was also this guy named Todd there.  Todd goes to my gym, attends circuit events religiously, dresses like a fashion victim and shows far more interest in social climbing with the circuit set than in spending any time with me.  So last night he sloshes up to me and declares through his alcoholic fog that he's "alwaysh had a crush on" me.  Now, for us teetotalers there's  nothing  more romantic than a drunken declaration of love -- especially from a drug user who all but ignores you when he's sober.  I wasn't sure how to respond, so I asked him if that wasn't just the liquor talking -- which was obviously the  wrong  reception for the heroic bravery he and his Miller Lite had summoned up all the courage to show me.  He mumbled something unintelligible and stumbled off in a mix of confusion and indignation, leaving me alone to ponder the cruelty of a god who would allow Madonna to be cast in the  Evita  movie.  And I have a feeling this is really gonna hurt my chances when I try to pledge his fraternity.  Assuming he remembers any of it when he sobers up.

      Bill and I had noticed that our daily workouts were getting kind of dull and uninspiring -- and that our waistlines are getting kind of flabby and unappetizing.  So today was the first day of our new and improved workout schedule -- now with cardio!    We spent today's workout sweating and gasping on the elliptical and treadmill machines, and my legs are already wobbly -- and my thighs are already feeling sexier.  We should be hot in no time!

       I got three standing ovations this weekend.   What did you accomplish?   The show's over, and now I can focus all my attention on my damn Christmas letter.  Just as soon as I get my laundry done.  Mom and Dad drove in to see the show yesterday, and on their way to my house from the theater last night they got run into the median by a bad bus driver.  They ended up blowing a tire -- and then they discovered their spare was flat as well.  Whee.  It was midnight by the time we realized our little saga wouldn't get resolved until morning, so I decided to forgo the cast party last night and get some sleep.   Then Dad and I got up at some ungodly hour this morning to meet the AAA guy who towed him to the Sears tire center -- but we were first in line and Sears even opened early, so we got all fixed up and Mom and Dad left for home by noon with four new tires safely gripping the road underneath them.  And while we were at Sears today, I got my tires rotated -- so I'm done worrying about them for another 7,000 miles.

      So opening night went well.  Our audience cheered and clapped in all the right places, we had only minor mishaps involving fallen headdresses and weird lighting cues -- and, best of all -- we sold out!  In fact, we more than sold out; we had to sell the box seats at the sides of the theater to accommodate the overflow, and we reportedly turned away more than 100 people.  Woo-hoo!  I hope they'll come back today for our 5:00 and 8:30 shows, which are on the verge of selling out themselves...  Now Mom and Dad are on their way in for a show-seeing visit and I'm madly scrambling to find the carpet under the mounds of stuff that has piled up in the last few weeks. ACK!

       Opening night   Last night's dress rehearsal went fabulously well -- which, depending on the superstition you subscribe to, means:  1) We'll have a horrible opening night. 2) We'll have a fabulous opening night. 3) It doesn't matter -- superstition is for the weak.  I took the day off and spent it sleeping, cleaning, catching up on old Chicago Tribunes, watching  urlLink The Ellen Degeneres Show  and working on my Christmas letter.    Now I'm off to entertain the masses.  And in this show I'm dancing in drag, jitterbugging in a muscle shirt and even singing a bit of a solo.  There's still time to get your tickets -- it would be a shame if you missed it all ...

       LASIK CLUSTERFUCK   So I left the house this morning in plenty of time to get to my LASIK appointment, but an odd convergence of weirdness and stupidity prevented me from getting there:  1) When I entered my Zip code in the LASIK doctor's  urlLink Web site , I was taken directly to a page with a poorly-labeled map and what turned out to be unhelpful directions to a faraway branch  that isn't even open yet .  (Go ahead -- enter 60640 on the home page  and  the "locations" page and see for yourself.  I'm not sure that the city of Riverwoods even exists.)  2)  The AAA map in my glove compartment kind-of matched up with the map from the Web site, but the 94/294 intersection that both maps promised would be there simply doesn't exist.  3) The informational signs on 94 (also called The Edens just to further confuse those of us prone to be lost) are few and faaaaaar between.  So $1.00 in tolls, a quarter of a tank of gas and a wasted morning later, I still haven't had my eye appointment.  Grrrrrrrr.

       Tech week   Not a lot to report this week -- spacing rehearsal at the theater on Tuesday, tech rehearsal last night, dress rehearsal tonight.  The show is going extremely well, and we should be awesome by the time we open on Friday.  At least we'd  better  be awesome -- a good 20 of my co-workers are coming during the run of the show.  Speaking of work, I had to miss our company Christmas party last night -- for the second year in a row -- because of rehearsal.  But we had a company meeting yesterday afternoon, and -- again for the second year in a row -- we were named Agency of the Year in our conglomerate's worldwide network.  And that position on the food chain earned us each $100 in cash.  Today I'm off to my second preliminary LASIK checkup -- this time at a  much  cheaper doctor in the suburbs.  The doctor in downtown Chicago was gonna ask $5,000 for the procedure, and the suburban guy wants only $3,000.  Both doctors have operated (successfully) on my friends, and I figure the long-ass commute is worth saving a good $2,000 -- especially since I'm going to London and Paris in the fall!

       Dabbling in the occult   Dan, Nick and I -- on the recommendation of a friend of Dan's -- went to a psychic last night.  And he was  amazing .    But first, I have to report that on the way there, I did the stupidest thing any reasonably sober Chicagoan can do: I managed to get on the Purple Line train going in the wrong direction.   No big deal , I can hear you saying.   Just get off at the next stop and get on the Purple Line train heading in the direction you want to go.   Well, yes.  That's what I eventually did.  Except I had to wait half an hour to change trains  because the Purple Line runs express to Evanston  if you get on the northbound train at Belmont instead of the southbound, which takes you to the Loop in about five short stops.  Anyway, after reading a complete issue of  Newsweek , I eventually changed trains and made it to the Loop and joined Dan and Nick for our evening of black magic.  And our psychic was awesome -- he just started talking as soon as he shook our hands, blurting out highly accurate statements and questions and predictions at rapid-fire pace.  He nailed a ton of secrets all three of us were carrying, and we all left more than impressed.  My life has always been pretty great (to the point of being boring), so the stuff he said about me was a lot less juicy than what Dan and Nick got.  And he went so fast that I still can't remember everything he said, but here's what I got written down (conveniently categorized for your reading pleasure):   Obvious generalities and/or easy guesses  - I'm German - I'm Norwegian - I grew up Lutheran - I look like my dad (which isn't all that true; I look more like my mom) - I'm in my mid-30s - I have a friend named Dave - I have a Jewish friend - I had a grandparent die of heart problems - There's a woman at my office who likes me   Amazing facts he knew all by himself  - I'm a writer - I'm in advertising - My mom is a long-term cancer survivor - My dad has had back surgery - My mom is 62 and my niece is 2 - My family is in Iowa - Someone in my family used to live in Ohio - I had a long-term relationship that ended amicably - My mom was really pretty when she was young, and she's still quite attractive - My family doesn't have many issues with my sexuality, and my dad is the coolest about it - My sister's husband treats her well - My sister is really pretty when she dresses up, but she usually dresses casually - My sister was a teacher until she had her kids - My sister's name is Jenny - My boss and I are good friends - I have many really great friends who openly express an interest in dating me, but I'm not romantically interested in them - I have a friend named Scott who is really attractive and we flirt openly with each other, but we have never acted on our mutual interest - I'm going to Europe in the fall - Dan and Nick are going to Europe as well, but not with me - I've known Dan longer than I've known Nick - I have an easy time meeting people (which is actually not very true at all -- I'm pathologically shy, but once I do meet people I have an easy time making friends)   Yet-to-be-proven-true predictions  - I'll never have a weight problem (Nick got this same prediction, but Dan -- put down that doughnut! -- didn't) - I will do very well in my career and make a lot of money - I will live a long life - My niece will be into ballet and my nephew will be into soccer - My mom's cancer won't come back - I'll start a long-term monogamous relationship within the year - My trip to Europe will go very well   Things I figured he'd pick up on but he didn't  - I've lost five friends in violent ways -- including a terrorist murder - I'm not religious and my family is -- which is probably our only conflict   Random things that may or may not be true  - My mom has a friend with MS - My mom has a friend in Boston  I'm still absorbing everything he told me, but I was certifiably amazed at the experience -- and we can't wait to go back in a few months to see what else there is to learn!

       WHEW.   So I'd planned to celebrate surviving the just-completed week from hell with a long morning snooze on Saturday, but I was mysteriously up and at 'em by 7:00.  And since I'd already written off the day as a work day, I decided to get to work putting up my tree instead.  It's a modest little four-footer, and it's now loaded with lights and sitting in front of the window just glowing the holy fuck out of Christmas.  Matt had volunteered to be a lingerie model for our saucy "Walkin' 'Round in Women's Underwear" number for this weekend's  urlLink chorus  concert, and I'd told him I'd help him pick out something fun on Saturday afternoon at the local Boystown drag emporium.  Now normally you're among friends when you prance around in lacy things or totter around in heels at this place, but there was some Boystown holiday street fair going on Saturday, and the store was  crawling  with funky Lincoln Park chicks and their visibly uncomfortable boyfriends. Curious stares notwithstanding, Matt left with a lovely lavender bustier/panty/fishnet set -- and I managed to snag a plum evening gown, black velvet wrap and beaded clutch from the clearance rack ... in case I get invited to an all-drag Nobel Prize reception or something.  (You never know.)  Later that night I had my choice of parties to attend: a surprise birthday dinner thrown by my friend Bill, a tree-trimming get-together at a co-worker's new place or the annual Girls' Weekend in Chicago dinner I've attended since I moved here.  Since the girls' weekend involved some dear family friends, I opted to join them again.  The girls are Gingie (a friend of my parents' whom I've known practically all my life), her sister Janie from Nashville, and Janie's two Nashville friends Nancy and Bunny.  The five of us ate at the trendy  urlLink d.kelly  in the west Loop and then headed over to join their Chicago friend Fern in the elegant  urlLink Drake Hotel  for drinks in its holiday-festooned lobby.  Who knew I'd keep having fun with them year after year -- just me and five Women of a Certain Age?  Next year they're all coming a day earlier so I can take them to Boystown for some drag shopping and trendy Boystown dining.  Now it's Sunday morning, and I'm nursing a bad headache and preparing for today's 8-hour  urlLink chorus  rehearsal.

       Another long-ass day at work.   We're working on a HUGE new-business pitch, which we assumed would suck up every last waking minute all week and this weekend too -- but I convinced everyone to stay late Friday night and see if we couldn't just get the fucker  done  and off our plates.  And we did it!  Woo-hoo!  Afterward, Dave and I celebrated over trashy but delicious mall food at one of my favorite suburban  urlLink restaurant chains  that just opened up a franchise a mere five blocks from the office.  Mmmmm!  Now it's late and I'm exhausted and I'm going to bed.  It's just another typically wild Friday night in the endless party that is my life.

       Jake's Holiday Cold: Epilogue   I'm officially declaring myself all better, though I still have some residual stuffiness.  And what have I learned?  A guy can do a lot of nose-blowing in 10 days.  I haven't filled this many Kleenexes since the afternoon I discovered Napster was also good for downloading free porn.  So this morning I was supposed to join the  urlLink chorus  for some promo spots on WGN, home of some of the hottest  urlLink anchors  and  urlLink reporters  in Chicago.  But after a lovely 13 billable hours yesterday, I'm still not caught up at work, so I had to miss what turned out to be a broadcast filled not only with singing homos but Lane Bryant models and wrinkly Munchkins as well.  Now it's off to a day of positioning statements, creative reviews and endless copy revisions.  I picked the wrong week to stop freebasing kittens.

       Day Nine   The cold still lingers -- even though we're well into  urlLink National Handwashing Awareness Week .  But I feel much better than I've felt in a long time, thanks for asking.  Last night I had the  gall  to sneak out of work early -- 7 pm -- to run two choreography rehearsals for next week's  urlLink chorus  concert.  My disco elves are about 95% ready to perform (a few more run-throughs and they should be ready to shake their elfin booties in front of a paying audience).  And my dancing rolls of wrapping paper kicked ass learning their entire song and committing it to memory in an hour and a half.    I'm so proud of all my anthropomorphic wards.  Next show I hope to graduate to choreographing for actual humans.

      The two best things about being sick: Nyquil and Vicks VapoRub.  I've been chugging the former and slathering the latter for seven nights now, though, and it's starting to get old.  I'm feeling definitely better, but I'm not all there just yet.  And I have to be well by tomorrow; I have only one helping of Nyquil left, and I'll be damned if I have to buy another bottle of the stuff.  'Cause if I do, the cold wins.  And if living with the eterna-cold weren't bad enough, work has been crazy busy as well.  I did manage to sneak away from the cubicle last night in time for an amazing  urlLink Chanticleer  Christmas concert with Matthew.  If I were a groupie of any musical group, it would Chanticleer -- I think I've seen them in concert about 15 times now.  And I have a secret plan involving them:  Get transferred to our office in San Francisco (Chanticleer's home city), and once I'm all moved in without incurring any moving costs, quit my job and get hired to sing and tour with the best men's chorus in the world.  How cool would  that  be?

      Another late night at work last night.  Whoopee.  Then I met Dan for an even later showing of  urlLink  Monster  .  The movie is thoroughly disturbing, and I don't care to see it ever again.  But it is amazingly written and acted, with a heart-wrenching performance by Charlize Theron.  And you know how everybody thinks pretty actresses are so brave to gain weight or wear ugly makeup to play a part?  Well, Charlize certainly let herself go for this role (and we see a lot of the jiggly evidence in the film) but she plays this unattractive, angry character with such force and dignity and nuance and honesty -- never once going for the easy pathos or the obvious caricature -- that she leaves you exhausted.  And thoroughly moved.  Go see it.  (And never,  never  pick up another trashy hooker on the highway.)   After the movie we headed to Sidetrack for a quick drink and my grand debut as a two-eyed homosexual.  I have to say, this LASIK stuff is pretty awesome.  And so is the extra attention you get when you're not wearing glasses.  I got more eye-locks and grabass in two hours last night than I've gotten there collectively in the last three years.  (Of course, the place wasn't exactly teeming with competition;  the smart Chicagoans stayed home and out of the bitter cold.)  Now I'm off to some far suburb for the  urlLink chorus'  first CD recording session.  Look for us on your favorite music Web site this summer!

      So I got this great idea today to  urlLink google  my blog's URL. Nothing.  But when I googled people who have  linked  to my blog's URL, I got two results:  urlLink Mark's blog  and  urlLink this guy's blog .  I've been writing this thing for about six months, and I've been doing it for many reasons: my own amusement, the discipline of writing something succinct and (one would hope) clever on an almost-daily basis, the narcissism of keeping a diary that anyone can read, an organized database to draw on when it comes time to write my epic four-page, single-spaced Christmas letter, the opportunity to write about stuff I care about more than what I have to cover 50-60 hours a week at work, and even to establish one place to put the funny/interesting Web links I stumble across.   Whew.   Rambling, awkward sentences notwithstanding, it's also a good way to show the world my writing skills.  But since blogger doesn't offer me a hit counter -- and since not one stranger has clicked the  urlLink Write Me  link to say hi -- I have no way of knowing if the world is even reading it (except for my friends who randomly comment on stuff I post here).   So I have to say it was TOTALLY COOL to find out that a total stranger (note that as far as I can tell, that's still just  one  total stranger) has not only linked my blog to his, but that he states unequivocally that he actually reads it.  Woo-hoo!  I'm somebody!

      I had a rather quiet night last night.  I worked until 7, stopped at Walgreen's for eye drops  and a birthday card for Mom, and then burrowed in for a cold winter's night of chicken 'n' pasta, reading, South Park, and (guilty pleasure) The Bachelorette.    Thankfully, Meredith kept  urlLink my favorite blond  for at least one more episode.  I hope we get to see him shirtless pretty soon.  I'm getting really tired of waiting ...

       Quatre-vingt-dix-neuf   We learned our numbers last night in French class, and the above mess is apparently the impossibly complicated way the French say ninety-nine.  It translates -- if I wrote this down correctly -- as four (times) twenty (plus) ten (plus) nine.  And it explains a LOT about the whole Jerry Lewis thing.

      My poor little niece has contracted a rather virulent  urlLink rotavirus  infection, and she's spending her second night in the hospital tonight.  She's doing fine, though, and she's lucky enough to have a mom and two grandparents able to dote on her every need -- and take care of my nephew -- while this week's Midwestern snow dump has trapped my sister's husband in Florida on business.  Anna (my niece) is currently in the unpleasant throes of her Terrible Twos, and this infection has kept her blessedly docile, my sister reports.  So there is a small silver lining to this viral cloud.

       Damn.   One of the bad homosexuals from my old gym followed me to my new, otherwise-bad-homosexual-free gym.  Matt is one of those social-climbing parasites who's vaguely nice to you unless someone he finds more appealing comes along.  We used to make small talk, then I made small talk while he grunted answers and looked around, then he started walking away from me while I was in the middle of making small talk.  So I started ignoring him completely, and now he wants to be "friends" again.  His pallid, bug-eyed boyfriend is also named Matt (could you just barf?), and while Matt #2 won't even make (buggy) eye contact with anyone not on his pre-approved friends list, he's all hands whenever I find myself near him in a crowd.  Ugh.  And now, though I was sincerely hoping otherwise, (at least one of) The Matts will be invading my space yet again as I work out.  I can only hope our friend  urlLink R. Kelly  mistakes him for an underage girl and (allegedly) pees on him in the shower.

      Monday night is always show tune night at Sidetrack, but not wanting to get smoke particles in my expensive new eyes, I stayed home and played on the computer and watched  urlLink Average Joe .  I don't mean to buy into the hot-is-better camp -- and the eight hot guys on the show have all proven themselves to be unrepentant assholes -- but if I had to choose among the sixteen options as they stand now, I'd have to pick  urlLink this guy . And my runner-up would be  urlLink this guy .  (But then again I have a blond fetish, so what can you expect?)  Of course, the last guy I'd pick -- even if it meant I'd never date again -- would be  urlLink this guy .

       Let there be sight!   So Friday's LASIK was a smashing success.  It was a little creepy watching the surgery being done from the inside, but the doctor talked me through everything he was doing and everything I should expect -- pressure on my eye to the point it would black out, a burning smell when the laser was hacking away at my flesh, etc. -- and I made it through with only a few little panicky moments.  And one very audible whimper.  I took my Valium before the surgery, and while I don't think it calmed my nerves during all the abovementioned carnage, it sure knocked me out cold once I got to the car.  Poor Mom had to drive me all the way home from Schaumburg through unfamiliar territory in a snowstorm, but she got me here safely and ushered me up to bed for a long slumber with my eyes hidden away under protective welding goggles designed to prevent me from 1) rubbing my eyes while I sleep and 2) sleeping in any position that isn't flat on my back (i.e., any position I find comfortable).  And when I woke up ... WOW!  Things both far and near (including the layers of dust blanketing my condo) immediately appeared to me with startling clarity -- albeit behind a slight haze not unlike the Vaseline coating directors put on their lenses to hide the fact that Joan Crawford, Linda Evans, et al. were  not  aging gracefully.  This haze is to be expected off and on for a couple weeks, I was assured at yesterday's follow-up visit with the doctor -- who also proclaimed my recovery to be complication-free and my vision to (eventually) be 20/15.  (Coincidentally, I ran into a guy I used to date -- a very attractive guy I used to date -- while I was waiting for my follow-up doctor visit.  He'd had the surgery a few hours after I had, and he and I  and my mother  made awkward conversation for a good half an hour until we were called in to be checked.)   After the checkup, Mom and I headed out for some celebratory shopping at nearby Woodfield Mall.  My first order of business was to buy some cool sunglasses  right off the rack  -- which I haven't been able to do for more than 15 years.  I quickly discovered that when you're not limited to flat frames that can hold prescription lenses, you are forced to choose among literally thousands of styles of sunglasses.  It was more than a little overwhelming, but after two hours of looking, I managed to stumble out into the sunlit parking lot with three cool new pair of glasses  and  a celebratory new shirt.  But our shopping was far from over.  Before we headed back to Chicago (in yet another snowstorm) I also bought a new blanket, bedspread, clock, set of funky picture frames and two horrifyingly ugly tchotchkes for Kelly and Anders --  all without wearing glasses!   I also made another exciting discovery on the darkened drive home:  I now have nighttime depth perception!  I used to see stoplights in the distance and not be able to tell if they were one block or three blocks away, but my LASIK magically cured me of that confusion!  Woo-hoo!  Since I wasn't sure I wanted to take my still-in-danger-of-being-jostled-out-of-place corneal flaps out into public last night, we invited Matthew and Richard over for movies and cheesy canapés and a chance for Mom to get to know some more of my Chicago friends.  Then, Mom's nursing duties successfully over, we packed and gassed and windshield-wiper-fluided up her car this morning and she headed back to Iowa in the cold while I stayed indoors to play on my computer and do some more quiet reading with my magical new eyes.  And I'm left with five more days of medicinal drops that make my eyelashes as thick and luxurious as dried wheat, and another week of sleeping in welding goggles and showering with my eyes closed.  (Honestly, I don't know how the blind don't fall over more often -- especially in the shower.  All those slippery, uneven surfaces and all that splashing water make for quite a disorienting environment when you're trying to wash yourself.  Try it sometime.)

      So Mom made it in yesterday to mother me through tomorrow's LASIK surgery, and we spent last night watching our first-and-last-ever episode of  urlLink  American Idol  .  What a friggin' stupid show!  That fat, hairy Simon takes out all his too-repellent-to-get-laid frustration -- with a marked absence of wit or creativity or any remotely constructive feedback -- on everyone who shows up to audition, and then he's apparently too stupid to comprehend why people get mad at him.  I understand there's a need for drama and conflict to make the show interesting, but his sophomoric attempts at insult humor would give any fledgling television writer a failing grade and a fast-track path to a career involving frequent use of the question "Do you want fries with that?"  And Simon, if you (know how to read and) are reading this, you are allowed to tell people "You have the worst voice I have ever heard" exactly once before you start to exponentially undermine what little credibility you have as a judge of talent.  After our disappointing evening of television watching, Mom came to work with me this morning to check out my cool new office and to spend the day shopping up and down Michigan Avenue. She also stopped by for lunch with me and a bunch of co-workers, who went out of their way to make her think they like me (thanks, guys!), so the charade continues uninterrupted.  Mom's afternoon shopping exploits took her to Hot Tix, where she managed to score two awesome seats to  urlLink  Hairspray   tonight.  (The seats weren't as awesome as the fifth-row-center ones I got the week before, but the show was as spectacular as ever.)  Now I'm off to bed to rest up for tomorrow's surgery. It's my last night as a myopic, astigmatic show-tune aficionado.  Woo-hoo!

       The end of an era   I got my nipples pierced on May 1, 1999 -- more or less on a dare.  It took a good week for them to stop being white-hot beacons of pain, and another six months for them to stop bleeding and crusting and oozing and generally being puffy and repulsive.  Once they settled down, though, they made great conversation starters when I was shirtless, and they gave me a harmless little naughty-boy I-have-a-secret thrill when I was all buttoned up and normal-looking on the outside.  And over the last almost-five years, I amassed a small menagerie of nipple jewelry as I switched from hoops to barbells, had the holes stretched and replaced random pieces as they fell out.  I even had to have one nipple re-pierced after a barbell fell out and the holes grew shut before I noticed.  But there are milestones in a man's life, and doing certain things past those milestones just makes you look desperate, stupid and/or foolish.  Like getting wasted past the age of 22.  Or wearing Abercrombie & Fitch past the age of about 28.  Or having body piercings in your 30s.  Clearly, at 35 (and a half) I was on borrowed time, and clearly I was overdue to reclaim my nipples.  But I needed a push.  And that push happened yesterday morning when I woke up to discover that one of the barbells had fallen out again.  And that I couldn't get it back in the holes when I finally found it.  So, resigned to the obligations of propriety that come with my advancing age, I unceremoniously removed the other one and went boldly into the world  sans  chest hardware for the first time in almost five years.  But I'm looking at it as part of my very own  urlLink Extreme Makeover :  I've been using Crest Whitestrips for the last few weeks. I'm having  urlLink LASIK surgery  on Friday.  And I'm thinking of getting my hair cut this weekend.  Top it all off with my almost-normal-looking nipples, and I'll walk into work Monday morning a new man.

       The high price of (allegedly) peeing on children   So Bill and I think we have the Hummer mystery solved.  See, every noon when we go to the gym, there's a huge urine-colored Hummer illegally parked right in front with its flashers on.  And since everyone knows Hummers are purchased only by parvenus, Republicans and/or the small-penised, we assumed its presence had something to do with the fact that we see rapper and (alleged) child pee-er-on-er  urlLink R. Kelly  and his equipment-hogging posse at the gym every day at that time.  Today, we also noticed that there's always this R. Kelly-posse-type dude (you know: bling-bling, baggy velour sports ensemble, well-practiced street scowl) sitting glumly by the front door every time we walk in.  And today we figured out he's the meter-maid lookout.  He sits there every day guarding the flashing Hummer against The Man's evil penchant for ticketing the gold-plated wheels of oppressed rappers.  So therefore R. Kelly doesn't park illegally every day because he's above the law.  Quite the contrary -- he has to park illegally because his defending-himself-against-(allegedly)-peeing-on-minors legal bills preclude him from affording the legitimate parking that the not-(allegedly)-peeing-on-minors rest of the world enjoys.  Mystery solved!

      So I got home late enough last night to fold laundry and catch  urlLink Average Joe 2: Hawaii .  I kinda liked the first Average Joe -- what little I caught of it -- because the "hot" guys weren't oh-my-god hot, and they clearly didn't see themselves in Darwinian proportions.  But the "hot" guys on Average Joe 2 -- though some of them are pretty amazing to behold -- are assholes.  They're clearly arrogant and competitive and filled with a disturbing glee over the prospect of hurting the unattractive guys -- which is something they probably already get to do (glee or not) every moment of their not-on-TV lives.    I wonder where they get this need to behave like vicious junior-high-school girls -- proudly recorded on camera, no less.  If they weren't fighting for the affections of a woman, I'd venture an educated guess that they were all gay crack-whore circuit trash.

       The party's over.   After a great weekend of theater and shopping and hanging out, I showed up for work this morning to get our monthly "our workload is really heavy right now, and we're still understaffed, so you should expect a lot of late nights over this next month" speech.    I know I should be thankful I have a job -- and a halfway decent one at that -- but we never seem to get on top of this problem.  We're always understaffed.  We're always buried under huge workloads.  We're always canceling our personal lives and ordering shitty takeout as we burn the midnight oil here.  Sigh.  At least my new office has a couch.

      Keith and I spent yesterday shopping and eating and just hanging out in Boystown, and then we capped off our day with a showing of  urlLink  The Company  , which we really loved.  In addition to Altman's brilliant restraint in letting the story tell itself, the focus on some of my favorite Joffrey dancers and the casting of a bunch of Chicago actors I recognized -- including the woman I saw so brilliantly play Desirée Armfeldt in  urlLink  A Little Night Music   just two nights earlier -- I think I got the biggest kick out of seeing an endless parade of Chicago locations I recognized in this movie.  It's cool that after only three years here I feel such a sense of ownership and belonging in Chicago -- and that I've gotten to know the city so well I can pinpoint location shots in movies, commercials and TV shows.  This morning, after a leisurely reading of the paper over orange juice, toast and big-band jazz, Keith headed off to the airport and I headed to the laundry room for some long-overdue sartorial cleansing (six loads!). A cute guy I've never seen before in the building tried to chat me up in front of the dryers, but I had my Crest Whitestrips in, so I couldn't make charming, flirtatious conversation ... and he eventually wandered off.  Sigh.  But while my clothes were sloshing and spinning their way to cleanliness, I rotated my mattress (only 18 days behind on my strict three-month rotation regimen) and did naughty things with my credit cards on amazon.com.  Within the week, I should be getting a huge shipment of DVDs including  Finding Nemo  and  Bedknobs and Broomsticks  and cast albums including  urlLink  Hairspray  ,  Little Shop of Horrors ,  Urinetown ,  Wicked  and  Avenue Q .  (Some picker/packer in some Amazon warehouse is probably making fag jokes as we speak.)

       Jake's Great Big Theater Weekend   So Thursday after work I met up with Bob for dinner and an amazing production of  urlLink  A Little Night Music  . Of all the Sondheim oeuvre I have committed to memory, I probably know  Night Music  the best, and I've seen some pretty excellent productions of it over the years.  This one was no exception -- and it was filled not only with great performances but fun little knowing winks to those of us who love Sondheim's work, including a few whistled quotes from his other shows.  I had toyed -- long ago -- with the idea of auditioning for this production, but 1) I was chicken and 2) on the very, very  very  remote chance I got cast, I would either have to quit my day job that so nicely pays my mortgage or turn down an opportunity to play some dream roles (Carl-Magnus or either guy in the quintet) in what I knew would be a fabulous show.  I couldn't bear the thought of either scenario, so I wallowed in my professional inertia ... and here I am writing about it from the audience's perspective.  The production was exquisite -- right down to the sumptuous costumes, the lush, full orchestra, and the balls-out operatic delivery of the cast.  (And while I think I could have held my own singing with this quintet, I couldn't hold a candle to the brilliant comic performance delivered by Michael Cerveris as Carl-Magnus.) One very pleasant surprise was the casting of Barbara Robertson as Desirée Armfeldt.  I had been so moved by her hurricane-force performance in  The Goat or, Who is Sylvia?  at the Goodman a few months ago that I came back to see it again, and her visceral talents brought Desirée to marvelous life here like no other actress I've seen in the role.   After the show, Bob and I walked to the Orange Line to meet my stunningly handsome Disney dancer/singer/actor friend  urlLink Keith , who flew in for the weekend to visit.  After a long, gabby catch-up session on the train home, we sat up and talked a bunch more (mostly about theater, because we're a couple of big queens) at my house and then crashed for a long winter's nap.  We spent next afternoon in the suburbs with Keith's delightful friend and former dance partner Holly, and then we headed home to get all prettied up for my second amazing theater experience of the weekend:  urlLink  Hairspray  .  I just have two words to say about this show: HOLY SHIT.  I left the theater unsure whether I should be bubbling with excitement over having seen one of the hands-down coolest musicals  ever  or seething with bitterness and jealousy that I'm a 35-year-old copywriter doomed to a life of writing junk mail at a desk that looks like my grandma's deep freezer when I  know  I belong up on stage shaking my only-starting-to-get-slightly-flabby tush in such a brilliant, energy-filled show.  It helped that we got to see the show from the fifth row center -- spectacular house seats secured for us by my new friend  urlLink Jim , who just happens to be the show's distractingly handsome musical director.  It also helps that Keith is friends with  urlLink Bruce Vilanch , the show's star  who invited us backstage to his dressing room  afterward for some handshakes and friendly gossip. (Me? Backstage after seeing the national tour of the coolest show on Broadway?  I about DIED.)  So I don't know where to start with how much I loved the show.  The music and lyrics are amazing and clever and infectious and so damn fun you just can't help but smile all the way through them.  The costumes are downright (you'd think I earn a nickel every time I use this word)  fabulous .  The choreography is masterful -- exuberant and over the top at moments and judiciously restrained at others.  And the cast is first-rate from top to bottom -- high-energy, adorable, talented, graceful, goofy and blessed with rank upon rank of powerful, Teflon-coated vocal cords that repeatedly raised the roof and sent shivers down my spine for almost three hours.  Speaking of adorable, my handsome musical-director friend Jim has some competition in the distracting-beauty department.   urlLink The actor playing Link  starts out the show all cute and talented and stuff -- but kind of skinny. Then he shows up in shorts and a tight white T-shirt revealing an impressive set of arms.  A nice little bit of eye candy, I think.  But I quickly focus back on the magnificent show.  And then he comes on stage in tight pants and a blue T-shirt that hugs his tiny little waist (let's hate him) and his well-sculpted pecs and his nicely veined pipes ... and suddenly a whole raise-the-roof gospel number goes by and I realize I didn't hear a single note of it.  But with my advancing age comes a nice grasp of reality, and I fully understand that I get fun, short-lived little crushes on every hot actor I see in every show I see (just scroll through my archives for paragraph after paragraph of proof), and in a few hours my torrid affair with Link will be nothing but a nice little memory.  In the mean time, Keith and I have a weekend of Chicago fun -- starting with some long-overdue breakfast -- ahead of us, and I need to get in the shower.

       Celebrity workouts!   So when  urlLink R. Kelly  isn't (allegedly) peeing on underage girls, he and his posse share a workout schedule with Bill and me.  R. himself isn't so attractive in person (he looks kind doughy), but one of his boys sure is hot.  (I wouldn't let him pee on me, though.)  And my brushes with fame don't stop there!  Apparently I'm also working out every day with the lanky and quite tall  urlLink Kyle Farnsworth .  Poor Kyle can't seem to afford a decent workout wardrobe, though; he's worn the same grungy  urlLink Jesus is my Homeboy  T-shirt every day for the last two weeks.  But he sure is cute.  And he has a very, very,  very  nice butt.  I just saw it in person.  Naked.  Grrr!  After judging Kyle's butt, I headed over to the CADM offices to be a judge for the   urlLink Tempo Awards .  I've been the designated awards entry coordinator at work for the last year or so, so it was interesting to get a look at how other agencies submit their entries -- and at the way everything is judged.  I was downright inspired by the creativity behind some of the entries I saw today ... and I was outright appalled at the abject simplicity behind some of the others.    In any case, judging was a nice respite from my hectic workload -- and it made me feel all accomplished and important that I was even asked.

       Bonjour!  Je m'appell Jake!   My first  urlLink French class  went well last night.  There are only eight students, and four of us are gay!  As I walked in the building, I ran into two guys holding hands, and they ended up being in my class.  And I registered with my friend Keith, so our people have 50% representation in the classroom.  Woo-hoo!  The class is at a very early beginner level -- the alphabet, which letters get pronounced, how to make nasal sounds, etc.  But we covered a lot of material, and I think I'll learn a lot.  Liza, my officemate at work, even lent me two French books, so I can conduct my own extracurricular practice.    Now if I could just find a cute, datable guy, we could practice other aspects of French with each other.

       New York was fun!   (But only if when you hear the word  fun  you think about spending endless hours in a plane, in a taxi and behind the mirrored wall of a focus group research center.)  Actually, I don't have any reason to complain.  My friend Jim happened to be flying out the same time I was, so he gave me a ride to the airport.  I got roomy exit-row seating for both flights.  Traffic was never very bad.  The hotel was posh and clean and conveniently located.  My colleague Karin and I had fun hanging out together.  And there was another big homo at the focus groups, so he and I dished about Broadway shows while we waited for our volunteers to march in and be focused.  But New York is big and loud and it looked kind of dirty -- and while I loved visiting and I can't wait to go back, my trip just reinforced how much more I love Chicago.  During my brief moments of down time, Karin and I had a very filling lunch at Maxie's Deli (where our sandwiches were so crammed with meat they looked like two human heads on small buns), and I joined my NY friend Arno for a few hours of show tune fun at  urlLink Splash Bar  -- which just can't hold a candle to the energy (and the dedicated queens) at the show tune nights here at  urlLink Sidetrack .  But Splash Bar did have waaaaaaaay hotter bartenders -- and they were shirtless!  Even better, the place was smoke-free, so I didn't leave smelling like a damn ashtray.  Chicago can't adopt similar smoke-free laws soon enough ...  Karin and I got back to the Chicago office today just in time for a lunch workout, where apparently I shared the gym with rap poser and (alleged) child rapist  urlLink R. Kelly  and his equipment-hogging workout posse (who loudly did their part to propagate Ebonics with  repeated  uses of phrases like "let me axe you" and "you know what I'm sayin'").  Classy.  But I've been up since 4:30 Chicago time and I'm starting to fade.  But first I'm off to my first  urlLink French class .  Then right to bed.

       A cold weekend in Chicago.   It's too damn cold here to lie around inert, so I'm keeping myself busy and my blood circulating:  - Keith and I signed up for  urlLink French lessons  yesterday.  Neither of us has studied French, but we have proficiency in German and Spanish, respectively.  Our language-learning prowess notwithstanding, the hottie at the Alliance Française  insisted  that we start with the pre-beginner class.  So I guess we'll spend the next 10 weeks mastering our vowel sounds and numbers and days of the week. - I made the long, ugly trek to Menards and Home Depot yesterday to return all the unused stuff from my hallway-painting-and-light-switch-replacing project.  Driving all the way down to the traffic-clogged North and Clybourn area is always such a treat. - Matt and I enjoyed a taste of  urlLink suburban chain food  for dinner last night on our way to Chuck's housewarming party in East Rogers Park, where we chatted and gossiped and flirted with people until 2 in the morning. - I currently have nine articles of rarely-worn winter clothing in my giveaway pile.  I vow to take that number to 20 before I drop everything off at the  urlLink Brown Elephant  on my way to tonight's  urlLink chorus  rehearsal. - And I have to be in bed early tonight; I take off at 6:30 tomorrow morning for a whirlwind trip to New York City where I'll get to observe five hours of focus groups.  Whee!

       Pick a candidate  urlLink impartially .   Just click off your beliefs on a range of subjects, add level-of-importance ratings to your answers and  presto!   You get a list of candidates ranked in the order of best to worst match to your political opinions.  Not surprisingly, Dean comes out on top for me with a 71% match to my ideal theoretical candidate.  And Kucinich and (oddly) Gephardt are right behind him at 70%.  I was surprised to see Clark in the bottom half of my rankings, though, with only a 56% match.  Not surprisingly, Bush ranks a  distant  second to last for me, just above that oddball LaRouche.  My only complaint about the site, though, is that it doesn't cover any gay-rights issues.  But check it out -- and then vote for Dean!

       The first Big Gay Movie Night of 2004!   A random collection of friends. A tablefull of pizza. A pile of DVDs.  And a blustery, snowy Chicago evening.  The perfect setting for a Big Gay Movie Night.  This time, we voted to watch my new  urlLink  Xanadu   DVD -- which wasn't as train-wreck horrible as I remember it being.  Sure, there are plot holes big enough to drive ten shoulder pads and a sparkly headdress through.  Sure, Olivia's dancing body-double looks nothing like her.  Sure, poor Gene Kelly's entire career must have flashed before his eyes during his big-band flashback pantomime.  But the movie perfectly captures a world on that magical cusp between the innocent sexuality of the peasant dress and the war-paint hostility that inspired makeup trends well into the 1980s.  And Kenny Ortega's choreography is still fresh and inventive and shamelessly exuberant.   And best of all, the movie is  really funny  in French!

      After a 12-hour workday (whew!) I retired to Shoebox Manor last night for a toasted turkey-and-cheese sandwich, steamed green beans and carrots, and the last half hour of some  urlLink  Extreme Makeover   follow-up special.  But with 100+ channels at my disposal, I could find nothing worth watching afterward, so I popped in disk 2 of my new  Pirates of the Caribbean  DVD to see if I could get it to work.  (Disk 2 has all the cool extras like behind-the-scenes footage and the blooper reel, but last weekend when I watched the DVD with Paul and his friend visiting from SF, the disk wouldn't let me toggle through the menu, so we couldn't watch any of that stuff.)  I still couldn't toggle through the menu last night, but in my frantic button-pushing I discovered the disk would recognize my  random  button -- so I watched a lot of the special features in total random order.  Which was better than not at all, I guess.  This morning on the train I was minding my own business listening to show tunes and reading my  New Yorker  when this woman stumbled on in a floor-length fur coat with two HUGE and awkward-to-hold (especially in a fur coat) boxes.  Normally I offer my seat to everyone with children, fetuses, packages, handicaps or other impediments to standing -- unless they're reading Bibles.  But today I amended my list of people who don't deserve to sit to include fur-coat wearers -- especially floor-length fur-coat wearers.  I'm no PETAphile, but fur coats are becoming increasingly gross to me.  (And yes, I have a leather coat, but it's dyed black so it doesn't make me look like a taxidermy project -- and this is my blog, so I get to harbor my own hypocrisies here.)  Ironically, the  New Yorker  article I was reading was interrupted by a full-page stopfur.com ad with a picture of a cute little animal and the headline "She needs her fur more than you do."  I read that spread extra slowly, making sure Fur Coat Woman could see it as she glared down at me through her pelt.

       The pilgrimage has started.   Last night Dan came over to admire my new walls and get caught up on our gossip over pizza (which makes four pizza dinners in a row this week for me and my amazing expando-butt).  After he left I  urlLink bleached my teeth  and watched the only episode of  Queer Eye  I hadn't seen yet.  Then I read up on Medicare reform for a client project (whee!) and snuggled into bed while the cruel winter raged outside.  It was a good night.

      Jay came over last night to admire my fabulous new hallway and watch  urlLink an interesting new reality show  with me.  He just moved into a condo about a block from me, and I foresee many more evenings of TV, gossip and pizza for us.   Yesterday it was supposed to be cold and I wore a hat and ruined my hair for the day -- even though IT WASN'T COLD.  So today I didn't believe them when they said it was supposed to be cold and I didn't wear a hat -- and I FROZE MY EARS OFF.  I literally had one eye frozen shut by the time I got to the train this morning.  Brrr.  I just can't win in the weather wars ...

      Bill and I had our first workout at the  urlLink gym by our new office building  today -- and it was awesome!  It's cleaner and brighter and better laid out than our old gym.  And the locker room is bigger and nicer -- and the showers actually offer you some privacy.  And the guys are waaaaaay hotter.  I was getting tired of all the bitchy old queens at the old gym -- I was more than ready for a change of homosexuals ... or even no homosexuals.  I think we'll be very happy here -- and get in much more productive workouts.  My first (real) workday at the new office was great too.  I love the space, I love my office, I love the location -- and I'd really missed my colleagues over the holidays.  Of course it's 7 pm and I'm still here.  I so did  not  miss the hours.

      So it's my first day back at work in almost two weeks and I'm having a HORRIBLE hair day.  Blame it on the sudden drop in temperature we had yesterday -- I had to wear a hat today AND I apparently didn't put in enough hair product this morning ... so here I sit with a bad case of mange and a thoroughly undermined sense of beauty.  ACK!

       WHEW.   It's all done.  I finished painting the front hall today -- after starting on Tuesday.  The stripes look really cool, but all that measuring and taping and peeling took  forever .  I also got all the new light switches installed (now a good 75% of the switches in my house are on dimmers -- how gay am I?) and the carpet scrubbed and vacuumed and everything put away.  Now all I have to do is hang the pictures and return all the DIY stuff I bought but didn't use.  And I got everything done just in time for Matt and Matthew to come over for  Sex and the City .  They were duly impressed with all my handiwork -- though they could have just been being nice so I'd let them drink my soda.  I also called W. and T. to thank them for last night.  They seemed genuinely pleased to hear from me.  And I just melted.  :)  Now I'm off to bed so I can be all rested up for my first day at work since the 22nd.

Not only are they interesting and fun to talk to and completely devoid of the arrogant pretense that makes most gay men unbearable, but they're HOT.  And their house is AMAZING.  We met at 5:00 for dinner, and from there we chatted, flirted, watched TV, snacked, enjoyed each other's company ... and suddenly  eight hours  had passed.  And now I'm crawling into bed at home kinda wishing I was crawling in between them at their house instead.  Maybe on our next date.  :)

       I'm dialated to meet you!   So the LASIK pre-qual checkup yesterday went well.  Mapquest got me to Schaumburg with only one wrong turn, I found my way back with only one wrong turn, the doctor says I'm a fine candidate for the surgery (though I'd already learned that from a more expensive doctor in Chicago)  and  I got to watch someone else get the surgery on a huge screen from my seat in the waiting room.  I'd never had my eyes dialated, though, and I don't care to go through  that  again anytime soon.  Thankfully, it was an extremely overcast day, so driving home didn't require sunglasses.  I stopped for more paint and electrical supplies in Chicago, and now the front hall is about a third done.  The nice warm chocolate base coat is up and dry, and now I'm busy measuring, taping and painting all the stripes I had envisioned making the area look all fancy and sophisticated.  The second color is MUCH lighter than I'd hoped (as opposed to the first round, where the second color was MUCH darker -- I just can't win), but it's up and it's staying up.  And -- if the gods are with me -- this whole messy thing will be done and cleaned up and handsome-looking by the time I report for work on Monday.  Whew!

       I'm 2/3 cool!   My cold is still here -- though it's getting much better, thanks for asking -- so I'd planned to stay in last night and read and watch a little TV before crashing with my bottle of NyQuil and a dollop of Vicks VapoRub under my nose.  But then Matt called and invited me over to watch movies at his house.  And he let me pick among his vast library of DVDs when I got there.  I'd never seen any of the  urlLink American Pie  movies, and he had all three -- and now I'm 2/3 caught up on what everyone else is talking about.  My verdicts:  "Don't forget your penis cream" ranks among the funniest lines in cinema.  urlLink Sean William Scott  ranks among the hottest men on the planet.  Um ... and I guess that's about it.  The movies are very funny and just dopey enough for a cold-medicine-addled brain to keep up.  And they were the perfect way to spend a Saturday evening.

      To celebrate surviving another hell week at work, I met Richard and Bob last night for dinner and  urlLink Thoroughly Modern Millie , which -- though neither thoroughly entertaining nor thoroughly good -- was a lot of fun and JUST what I needed to take my mind off direct mail and credit cards and insurance and endless, endless deadlines.  I was surprised to discover I actually (very distantly) know a  urlLink guy  in the cast, but he wasn't in the performance last night.  I stopped at my friendly neighborhood Jewel on the way home for a fresh bottle of NyQuil and then climbed into bed to sleep the sleep of a happily drugged cold sufferer.  This morning I got caught up on old Tribunes and did my taxes (I owe the state $72 and I'm getting $24 back from the feds, so I count it as a pretty good break-even), and now I'm heading out to lube up the car so I don't have any engine-related mishaps on next weekend's jaunt home for my nephew's 5th birthday.

       "The indignity of being singled out for special burdens on the basis of one's calling is so profound that the concrete harm produced can never be dismissed as insubstantial."   Who said this? The Massachusetts Supreme Court acknowledging the unjust discrimination gay people suffer when they are not allowed to marry?    Nope.  It was our very own Antonin "Scabby Little Butthole" Scalia in his dissenting arguments to the  urlLink SCOTUS decision  letting states withhold scholarships from students studying theology.  Scalia didn't seem so concerned about "the indignity of being singled out for special burdens" on the basis of homosexuality -- which is far more innate and fundamental than what he passively refers to as a religious "calling" -- when he voted so angrily and vociferously to uphold sodomy laws last year.  It scares me that a man so obviously unbalanced and so blatantly in the throes of religious hatred is in a position to influence jurisprudence and genuinely threaten the lives of millions of people across the US.  Why doesn't Bush attack him as an "activist judge"?  Scalia clearly has a fuck-the-law agenda to foist his repellent, irrational, misanthropic opinions on the country -- and he is in a unique position of power that lets him further his hate-filled agenda with a disconcerting level of influence.

      Ugh.  I seem to have caught another cold.  Which is making my hellish work week sooooo much more enjoyable.  But I managed to sneak out last night and meet Bob for some homemade pizza and  urlLink Tea , a fascinating play examining the lives, deaths, customs and unique hybrid culture of Japanese war brides.  Of course, when we bought the tickets, I totally didn't realize it would make me miss the bodice-ripping finale of  urlLink The Bachelorette .  (And while Meredith had whittled her suitors down to my two favorite blonds, I would have gone with the other one.)  Note to the ABC.com Web editor:  Get a friggin' proofreader (or at least a semi-competent writer).  Your  urlLink episode guide  for last night's show looks like it was written by a mildly retarded third-grader.

      So the  urlLink chorus  has this annual just-for-fun dinner every March, and part of the fun is an awards ceremony with all kinds of awards ranging from the silly (most Ethel Merman-like) to the prurient (best buns) to the heartfelt (new chorus member who has made the biggest impression).    At last week's rehearsal we all submitted our nominations, and at last night's rehearsal we voted on the top three nominees in each category.  And I got nominated twice.  I forget the title of the first award -- it's something about the chorus member who is (or who thinks he is) the biggest star.  And I'm (ahem)  bursting  with pride to be nominated for the second one: The Jack in the Box Award, which goes to the chorus member who gives the impression he has the biggest ... well, let's just say it's the kind of reputation that every man is glad to have.  And if I win, I'm going to wow everyone with my huge, long acceptance speech.

      Yesterday afternoon was the second recording session for the  urlLink chorus ' upcoming CD.  We got only four songs recorded in three hours, but they sounded pretty spectacular.  The final session is in two weeks, and we'll have a lot to cover.  But the whole thing will sound so cool when it's done!  After the session was over,  urlLink Sharleen  and the girls and I had a Mexican fiesta dinner -- and after ingesting a whole bag of those fabulous  urlLink guacamole-flavored Doritos  and three cans of soda (urp) I waddled over to Sidetrack and spent the rest of the night holding in my bloated gut in a desperate attempt to look hot for what turned out to be a not-very-attractive crowd.  Now it's a beautiful Sunday afternoon and I'm inside doing laundry and catching up on a week's worth of Tribs.

I received your bio from K. and think you'd be a spectacular nominee. Would you be interested?  The process is quite simple. If you're selected, you'll be interviewed for a brief article,  photographed by a top fashion photographer  (italics added for emphasis) and expected to attend a party in June. It's remarkably easy and, according to past singles, great fun.  Let me know if you're interested.   Thanks!  R.

       I wrote to  Time  magazine today   RE: The Battle Over Gay Marriage February 16, 2004, page 56  Dear Editor:  Despite conservatives' endless anti-gay-marriage rhetoric, the fact remains that nobody has coughed up a single compelling reason for denying same-sex couples the right to get married.    The oft-cited "threat to the institution of marriage" just isn't there. The real threats to the institution come only from the heterosexuals currently allowed to marry, and they are legion: soaring divorce rates, adultery, annulments, prenuptial agreements, and quickie weddings founded on pregnancy or mere impulse.   The best opinion Bush can muster on the subject is the meaningless "marriage is the foundation of society." While more hollow rhetoric than empirical truth, it’s still no reason to deny homosexual couples the right to help contribute to a stable society.  And Matt Daniels, founder of the misguided Alliance for Marriage, cites "the unique combination of gifts that the two genders bring to the raising of children." But marriage -- heterosexual or homosexual -- is not about children.  If it were, marriage licenses would mandate procreation and would be denied to the infertile.  If social conservatives were legitimately concerned about the so-called sacred institution of marriage, they would create more stringent requirements for  everyone  to marry -- ensuring that new marriages endure and restoring much-needed credibility to their claims.

      Either I've developed some newfound confidence that comes from not wearing glasses anymore or else I'm suddenly, randomly, the hottest man on the planet -- but I've gotten more attention in the three weeks since my LASIK than I've gotten in the three years I've lived here.  Woo-hoo!  For example: Sunday night I went to Sidetrack after rehearsal and left with TWO phone numbers from two very hot men -- both of whom approached  me!   And then I had an awesome date with one of them Monday night.  We chatted about everything and nothing for three hours in his funky loft condo and then went for a trashy dinner at Red Lobster.  (And then I woke up this morning all bloated and garlic-y, but I guess it's better than waking up all pregnant and bleeding.)    I get the feeling he likes me a lot more than I like him, though.  And over the course of our five hours together, he all but dropped the J-bomb on me three or four times.  And in my superficial overview of his place, I didn't see one magazine or newspaper or any related periodical indicating a love of reading or following the news.  But he's kind and decent and successful and intelligent and he has a strong sense of family, and our evening just flew by.  Too bad I'm just getting started being the new and improved  confident  (read: two-eyed) Jake ...

       I made $7 in drag money!   So the Valentine's Day cabaret was a smashing success.  Tons of people came, we raised tons of money and everyone had ... um ... tons of fun.  And my solo drag debut seemed to be a huge hit.  It went so well, in fact, that people came up and started handing me money -- as fans of real drag performers are wont to do.  Unfortunately, I wasn't expecting to be handed money, and the process of accepting it graciously and incorporating it seamlessly into my number didn't go so well.  I got so befuddled that I actually forgot my words and stood like a big dumb linebacker in a dress in front of the microphone for a few moments.  But I recovered and everyone cheered so I guess everything went just fine.  And while nobody seems afraid to flirt with a man in drag, I did NOT want to meet a guy while I was looking all quasi-womanly -- it's a dangerous precedent to set, especially on Valentine's Day -- so after I was done I quickly removed my costume and what I thought was all my makeup and I spent the rest of the night as a guy with a serious case of wig hair.    Later that evening, I met a distractingly hot man (whom we'll call Mr. Abs) at Sidetrack and spent a good two hours chatting and flirting and accidentally brushing up against (and even necking a little bit with) him.  And it wasn't until I was home brushing my teeth in front of the mirror after the bar closed that I noticed just how much clumpy mascara I still had on.  So Mr. Abs had spent the evening either being blinded by my bubbly personality, exercising an extreme level of politeness or just delightedly living out his guy-with-clumpy-mascara fetish.

I'd been  urlLink reading  about the San Francisco mayor choosing to honor California's constitutional amendment banning discrimination instead of its discriminatory marriage laws, but somehow I was processing the exciting news in the abstract instead of in the real world.  So when Mark emailed me that they'd taken the mayor up on his delightful fuck-the-conservative-hatemongers equal-opportunity-for-gays-to-marry decree, I suddenly realized that this exciting news had real consequences for my friends in San Francisco.  And when I saw the wedding photos Mark posted on his Web site, I got all teary-eyed to boot.  I'm so excited for Mark and Rich, for all the gay people of San Francisco (and those who've flocked there to get married the moment they found out they could) and for our future rights as equal citizens.  Of course, there are always assholes who aren't happy unless they're making life miserable for others, and the bible-thumpers are already gearing up with their hateful counter-attacks.  I will never understand -- in the face of real problems like poverty and illiteracy and all the troubles that heterosexuality causes (like abortion and divorce and child abuse) -- why the scabby little buttholes in the "social conservative" demographic work so damn hard to make a problem out of a non-problem and to hurt people they don't know and in whose lives they have no earthly reason for interfering.  But like most horrible diseases, these people and their hateful opinions will die off in a generation (or much sooner, if we're all lucky) and the rest of us can live happy, prosperous lives without them.  In the mean time, congratulations to Mark and Rich and the rest of the gay-marriage vanguard this Valentine's Day weekend!

      So we finally brought in a free-lancer to help cover the workload that has been crushing the souls of our copywriters for the last TWO MONTHS.  And thanks to his magic fingers, I was able to leave work early (if "early" means 6 pm) last night to go on a  urlLink Match.com  blind date.  And it was great!  John (the date) provided everything I'd hope to find in a fun evening with a guy: effortless conversation, a ready smile, frequent laughter, thoughtful opinions, fascinating life stories, mature attitudes about life and men and the world -- and all the right opinions on politics and religion.  He's going to his first  urlLink Fireball  event this weekend, so after dinner I marched him over to Walgreen's to get ear plugs -- perhaps the most important accessory one can wear to a circuit party -- and as we walked down the endless cosmetics aisle, I realized I still had to buy trashy makeup for my solo debut as a tragic drag queen at Saturday's spectacular  urlLink Valentine's Day cabaret .    Fortunately, we'd already discussed the free-thinking gay man's occasional obligation to spend an evening as a tremendously ugly woman, so we logged a good half hour of our first date laughing at all the horrifying possibilities available to us in the Walgreen's makeup aisle.  Then after another delightful hour chatting over coffee-type beverages, we said our farewells and I headed home to crash.  This morning I headed to Schaumburg for my three-week LASIK follow-up exam.  My eyes are healing so well that the doctor said he didn't need to see me again for 10 weeks instead of the usual four.  Best of all, the nurse gave me two free boxes of the ultra-expensive eye drops they recommend, and then the doctor gave me another free box when I talked to him. Woo-hoo!

      I talked to my sister last night.  And apparently while I was sitting in a potential-juror holding tank yesterday with the cast of  Norma Rae , she was sitting in the audience at an Oprah taping that featured the hunky  urlLink Jason Sehorn ,  urlLink Blair Underwood  and -- could you just  die ? --  urlLink Nick Lachey .  Speaking of hot men with whom I'll never share a toothbrush, our new office has this giant two-story wall of TV screens showing endless loops of ads we've created, interesting video clips and random movies.  And for the last few weeks, a couple of the screens have been showing  Flash Gordon  -- which has awakened a long-dormant adolescent crush I had on that dreamy, fluffy-blond  urlLink Sam Jones .  Sigh.

       My day of civic fun    6:00 am  The alarm goes off.  My sister and her friend Jane Ann are visiting so they can see an Oprah taping today, and the three of us jockey for time in the bathroom and counter space in front of the mirror.   7:15 am  The girls have been gone a half hour, and I leave for my 8:30 jury call in Maywood, which is a bit of a hike from home.  Two people and MapQuest have told me the trip will take only 45 minutes, so I tack on an extra half hour to ensure I won't be late.   8:00 am  I'm two exits away from the courthouse.  The moment I begin wondering what I'm going to do to fill my time when I get there so early, traffic on the Eisenhower STOPS.  For TWENTY MINUTES.   8:35 am  I get to the courthouse and encounter a mammoth line waiting to go through security.  The security guards are confiscating all cell phones, pagers, gameboys and related electronic devices.  Thankfully, I read my summons and knew enough to leave my cell phone and iPod in my car.   8:45 am  I'm finally in the jury room.  And all my hopes for finding romance splashing around in the jury pool are dashed.  Now I know where all the makeover shows get their "before" models.    9:00 am  They show us a video about jury duty and what's expected of us as potential jurors.  All the people in the video are modeling the latest in 1980s fashions: baggy sweaters in neon colors, poofy poodle hair, stonewashed jeans that sit high on the waist and grip tight at the ankles, etc.  I make a mental note to clean out my closet this weekend.   9:15 am  We're told there are three trials that need juries today, so we'll all probably be picked to serve.  They direct us to the "cafeteria" down the hall if we need food.  I head down to find six vending machines and many long lines of large-butted people loading up on Snickers and Pepsi.  I notice two dimes in a change return as I walk by one machine.  I'm already up 20¢ and the day has hardly begun.   9:20 am  Back in the jury room. Oprah is on the TVs where they showed us our video.  While I'm trying to remember whether or not Jenny and Jane Ann said their taping would be broadcast live, I realize the guests for the day are the ladies on "What Not to Wear."  In between makeovers, they offer their list of absolute wardrobe no-nos: baggy sweaters in neon colors, poofy poodle hair, and stonewashed jeans that sit high on the waist and grip tight at the ankles.  Nobody in the room seems to notice the irony.  Then again, nobody in the room can be described as  not  wearing baggy sweaters in neon colors, poofy poodle hair, and stonewashed jeans that sit high on the waist and grip tight at the ankles.   10:00 am  We were supposed to be called into separate jury rooms by now to begin the interview process.  No word.  But "The View" comes on.  I am shocked that four people can be so whiny, loud and shrewish -- and get paid to host a national TV show.  I quickly get a headache as I try to focus on my Newsweek.  The "before" models chuckle at the antics of the whiny, loud, shrewish hosts.    10:10 am  The guy sitting next to me pulls out his cell phone and starts to play some game on it.  The guy in front of me suddenly produces a gameboy.  So why the hell did the metal detector stop me for having foil-wrapped gum in my pocket?   11:00 am  Still no word.  The View shrews are mercifully gone.  The local news comes on. Apparently there's some sort of election coming up.     11:30 am  I finally break down and use the private juror bathroom.  BIG mistake.  The automatically flushing toilet won't flush.  There are three soap dispensers, but only one has soap in it.  I leave with an empty bladder and a creepy dirty feeling on my hands.   11:45 am  They finally turn off the damn TVs and make an announcement: All three trials were settled out of court, and we're free to go.  We gather up our $17.20 stipend checks and stumble out into the sun.   noon  I'm zipping toward Chicago on the Eisenhower, belting out "You Can't Stop the Beat" from  Hairspray  and basking in the glow of civic duty.   12:15 pm  Back at the office.  Nobody is around.  I sneak away for a quick cardio workout so I can face the rest of the day.  Jury duty can be so taxing, you know.

      I finally got my first haircut of 2004 -- and I think  urlLink Tim  hacked off a good 10 pounds of the stuff.  It's amazing how fluffy I can get when I'm too lazy to get my hair cut for  eight whole weeks .  Newly shorn, I headed to Sidetrack for a big-screen video showing of the  urlLink chorus ' holiday show.  Then a late lunch with Ricardo and the boys and then a bunch of snowy Boystown errands -- including getting my first pair of earrings so I'll be all glammed up for my solo drag debut next Saturday at Truly Scrumptious' spectacular  urlLink Valentine's Day cabaret .  (Doors open at 7, show starts at 8.)   See you there!

       Clint Eastwood strikes again -- and he hits like a girl.   Richard and I had made plans to get caught up in Oscar fever tonight and see a nominated movie together.  As you're probably (painfully) aware, I was stuck at work for another 11-hour day, and Richard -- bless his heart -- patiently waited until 8:00 to meet me for dinner and a late showing of  urlLink Mystic River .  And I can't remember hating a movie this much since  urlLink True Crime , which was also directed by Clint Eastwood -- who is lucky to be working, judging by his manifest lack of talent.  While I don't think the movie deserves even this little nod of respect, I begrudgingly warn you that  the following rant will contain MANY SPOILERS:   Let's see ... where to start?   The direction and cinematography.  They are so ham-handed they'd garner any film student a failing grade and the enduring ridicule of sentient filmgoers around the world.  The child actors all sound like they're reading their lines, especially in that painful scene where they tell their equally inexpressive dads that their friend has just been abducted.  The cuts -- especially in and out of Tim Robbins' flashbacks -- are so cliche-ridden they made me want to slap the camera out of Clint Eastwood's arrogant hands.  And what's with that pointless shot scooting along the water at the end?  Was it tacked on to make the movie's title somehow relevant?   Speaking of cliches ...  Mystic River is rotten with them: Pedophile rape as the unspeakable crime driving the plot. The true killers hiding in plain sight, flitting innocently in and out of the movie until they're revealed at the last minute.  Ex-cons discussing their time "in the big house."  The misguided sense of duty and family that unites blue-collar Catholic career criminals with Brooklyn accents.    The character development.  Laura Linney goes from destroyed stepmother of a murdered teen to hungry-twatted Lady Macbeth rather suddenly.  Kevin Bacon goes from good cop to winking, finger-gun-shooting family man once he uncovers a murder he apparently has no intention of prosecuting.  Tim Robbins just mutters about vampires and looks like he can't remember where he left his dignity most of the time.   The dialogue.  It was either poorly written or poorly ad-libbed or both -- but it definitely insults the intelligence of every reasonably sober third-grader in the audience.  How many times does Sean Penn have to yell "That's my daughter!" when they find the body?  I lost count when he reached the triple digits.  How many times does he have to say "Admit what you did!" before he offs his old buddy?  A good actor would need to say it maybe two or three times.  And a good director would edit out any more than that to save them both a lot of embarrassment.    The absolute randomness of plot points that are all over the importance continuum.  Tim Robbins' deathbed confession that the bloody secret he'd been keeping was that he  randomly  stumbled on a child molester  randomly  getting head from some  random  boy in some  random  car in a parking lot and beat him to death.  One of the early child abductors takes great pains to show his future victim -- and the camera -- that he's wearing a ring with a cross on it.  Why?  And what's with Kevin Bacon's missing wife who calls him but doesn't say anything and then when she finally speaks up Kevin smiles and accepts her back with no questions asked and no plot relevance explained?    There are a few things I liked about the movie, though: The trashy dresses and wigs worn by Laura Linney and Marcia Gay Harden are fabulous.  The boys' enduring signatures in the sidewalk -- especially the unfinished work of Tim Robbins' character, who remains unfinished in life -- are a nice touch. Tim Robbins' table-turning during his police interrogation is sharply written.  And the guy playing Sean Penn's assistant at the store is hot.  Sean himself looks pretty good -- especially with all his tattoos and muscles peeking out of his T-shirts.  But hot men and Tammy Wynette wigs do not make a good movie.  And neither, apparently, does Clint Eastwood.

      After yet another in a long string of 10-plus-billable-hour days, I headed out into a beautiful snowstorm last night and walked a full mile (I'm guessing here -- it was at least two Red Line stops) to burn off some frustration and get some fresh air.    And I had someplace great to go:  Matthew's fabulous Gold Coast condo, where he was waiting for me with a delicious spread of spinach/bleu cheese/pear salad, homemade lasagna and those molten chocolate souffles that are always so good they make you want to mmmmmmmm with happiness for days after eating them.  We devoured our dinner over gossip and  urlLink The Apprentice  (which I liked more than I expected -- especially whenever they showed  urlLink Troy 's handsome mug) and ER, and then I headed home, my tummy happily full of chocolate and candied ginger and toasted pine nuts and pomegranate juice.  Mmmmmm!

      I'm sorry, but if you have ever been emotionally or physically intimate with another man, you are NOT  urlLink "straight acting"  -- a term I find both ignorant and repellent on so many levels (and don't even get me started on the bizarre "str8" spelling).    Straight men, by definition, simply do not engage in homosexual behavior. Call yourself masculine if you find you need to define yourself in that way ... but you're not fooling anyone when the words "straight acting" come out of your mouth -- especially if it's ever had a penis in it.  Sheesh!

      Yay!  Meredith kept my favorite  urlLink blond  -- though the  urlLink guy with the bad haircut  who cooked her dinner sure looked hot in his tight little brown sweater. Thank goodness she finally wised up and ditched the blathering  urlLink black hole of emotional need .   And when the hell did I get hooked on a trashy heterosexual dating show?  (Oh, yeah -- the day I discovered it was filled with hot guys who weren't all queer-ass and weird like the guys on the other shows.)  I think my chest cold has become more than just a little whispered promise of misery.  My voice has dropped a good octave, and my coughs ring with the resonance of a drum sloshing full of phlegm.  (Wow -- the natural poetry in my writing sometimes even surprises  me .)  And my week of 11+ hour workdays hasn't helped much either.  But being sick does bring with it a few perks -- like topping off dinner with a huge bowl of ice cream and not a shred of guilt.

       Ugh.   I woke up today with a rattle in my chest and a vague sense of malaise.  Either Bush got elected president or I'm coming down with something.  And I start jury duty on Tuesday.  I sent an email to all the ACDs and creative directors on Monday to let them know, but have they stopped assigning me to projects?  I'll give you one guess.  Good thing I have no life.

       Overheard last night    the setting:  the sidewalk in front of the North End, a gay bar packed with people watching the last few innings of the Splendid Bowl (or whatever it's called)   dramatis personæ:  a cluster of Chicago Gay Men's Chorus members accustomed to unwinding after rehearsal in the usually empty bar -- but unwilling to enter last night given the size of the crowd and the subject matter on the TV screens  A car pulls up. Someone shouts, "Who's winning?"  The chorus members look at each other with marked incredulity.  Someone shouts back, "Who's  playing ?"

      The recording session yesterday went well.  We found this mammoth church with amazing acoustics and no ambient traffic noise (who knew such a thing existed?).  This being Chicago, though, we still had to stop a couple of times when airplanes and a helicopter flew overhead.  Then Richard and I spent last night gossiping about men and shows and the new CDs we've discovered (including  urlLink this  amazing one) over pasta and ice cream and brownies.  I got home and collapsed into bed for my first post-LASIK sleep without my stupid goggles.  My eyes are getting better every day -- and I've noticed I have shocking clarity in full sunlight.  Woo-hoo!  Now it's 2:15 in the afternoon, and I'm still lounging around the house in my underwear.  I love Sundays.

      1. I'm more than a little offended by what TiVo thinks I want to watch. Apparently TiVo takes a look at your fave programs and then picks other stuff it thinks suits your tastes and then automatically records it for you.  So far, I've programmed things like  Will & Grace, Queer Eye, South Park, SNL, The Apprentice  and  Playing it Straight .  And from that list, TiVo has extrapolated some "related" interest in crap like  Full House  and  A Different World  and a bunch of obscure morons-on-parade sitcoms on the WB.  AS IF.  2. How hot is  urlLink this guy ?  I hate it when they're interesting, articulate, funny, accomplished and sexy as all hell but they live half a continent away.

       It finally happened!  (And with fabulous coincidental timing!)  I've been writing junk mail (ahem --  direct  mail) since 1992.  And in all these years, I've never been mailed anything I've written as though I were a legitimate potential customer.  I've received tons of seed mailings -- addressed to some variation of Jake Q. Sample and mailed so we can gauge when our packages are reaching the public -- but I've never gotten a plain-old Jake-written mailing with my plain-old name on it.  Until today.  I opened my mailbox after work tonight to find the control package I wrote last year for the AT&T Universal Platinum MasterCard® sitting there waiting for me.  (It's in a white envelope with a jumble of months printed down the right side with a big BONUS reversed out of a blue-and-red rectangle -- in case you wanted to check to see if you got it too.  And a control package, for those of you who are just dying to know, is the package that continues getting the best response every time it's tested against a different package in the mail.  I currently have two controls in regular circulation (thank you for your applause), but I'll never receive the other one because it's aimed at business owners who carry the American Airlines credit card from Citibank.)   But I digress.  Big surprise.  Anyway, the great coincidence here is I just returned from a day trip to NYC to present new concepts to Citibank for the upcoming relaunch of the AT&T Universal Platinum MasterCard®.  And the control package I wrote for that very card is sitting in my mailbox when I get home.   Is that not completely cosmic?  I do find it kind of funny that three of us have spent countless hours today in cabs, airports, planes, more cabs and corporate cafeterias so we could spend one hour in front of the client and then hop in cabs, airports, planes and more cabs once again to get home in time for  Queer Eye for the Straight Guy .

       53:09   Probably my worst 8K time EVER.  Fortunately, it wasn't because I'm a sluggish runner; the  urlLink Shamrock Shuffle  had an epic surplus of entrants, and the crowd never got spaced out enough for us to run at our usual pace.  Josh, Katie and I spent the entire race dodging and weaving among the other runners, but we did have fun chatting and laughing and gawking at the veritable  sea  of bodies ahead of and behind us as far as we could see.  I got home in time to make a second 40-minute tech support call to TiVo -- the first one to figure out how to wire the damn thing into my surround sound, and the second because apparently I was too dumb to know what kind of cable package I had.  Anyway, it's up and running and recording its first show as I type this.  Stay tuned to see if it actually works.   Now I'm off to  urlLink chorus  rehearsal and then to Sidetrack to flirt with guys.

       The Bob and Jake Chicago Theater Adventure continues!   Last night Bob and I met up for a better-than-average dinner with a spectacular view at the new Millennium Park restaurant whose name I cannot remember. Our bellies filled with greasy entrees and those amazing chocolate volcano dessert thingies, we waddled up the street after dinner to the funky -- but not very patron-friendly -- new  urlLink Harris Theater for Music and Dance  to see the  urlLink Rhythm & Romance  section of  urlLink Hubbard Street Dance Chicago 's spring repertory concert series.  The concert was fine, offering a thoughtfully varied program of pieces I simply didn't care for -- with the exception of the lush  Kiss  pas de deux. Beautifully lyrical, emotionally charged and just plain visceral, the piece features a man and a woman suspended on ropes dancing and twirling and engaging in the epic passions that lovers sometimes do.  It's set to the evocative "Cantus in Memory of Benjamin Britten" by Arvo Pärt, a composer I've never heard of who was clearly influenced by (or who influenced) Henryk Górecki's equally succulent third symphony.  After the concert, we headed to Bob's to nail down travel dates for our October trip to London and Paris.  And since Hubbard Street had caused me to miss my Friday night date with  urlLink Playing it Straight , I coerced poor Bob into recording and then watching the trashy thing with me.  And I was so impressed with Bob's Replay TV (and with Keith and Steve's TiVo on Thursday night) that this afternoon -- after getting the rest of my arms waxed and enrolling in  urlLink French II  -- I headed to my friendly neighborhood Best Buy and joined the TiVo generation.  My TiVo is currently studying or marinating or chatting with my cable company or whatever it has to do quietly and alone for the first five hours of its life before it will join me on my effortless TV-watching adventures.  But that's OK -- I'm off to a  urlLink chorus  gig in the Loop and then to bed to rest up for tomorrow's  urlLink Shamrock Shuffle  8K.

       Can I get turned on by an obscure vocabulary word?   Apparently so.  I've been emailing back and forth with R., the charming, effortlessly handsome Ph.D. student (I finally found out what he does) I met Monday night at Sidetrack (see Tuesday's post).  Our emails have been filled with the witty, pretentious banter I usually like to lob back and forth with friends, pundits and potential suitors.   And then this morning in an email he casually (and -- of course -- correctly) tosses out  urlLink Bildungsroman  -- which is only my favorite pretentious, obscure-literary-reference word  ever  (it ranks right up there with  urlLink solipsism  and  urlLink picaresque ).  Among us tortured-intellectual English majors, it's words like  Bildungsroman  that separate the amateurs from the pronouns.  And now I'm not only distracted by R.'s charm, his looks and his personality, but I'm fully carbonated over the way he incorporates his liberal-arts education into his flirting.  WOOF.  Of course, I am still contractually obligated to remain single until July.  But I still can't wait to have dinner with R. sometime soon.

      I headed back to the doctor tonight after work for the results of last week's blood tests.  Everything's pretty much where it should be, thanks for asking.  My good cholesterol is low, but there's apparently nothing I can do about it.  My bad cholesterol is up to 169 from 144 a year ago, but it's still way within the acceptable range.  And they somehow forgot to do the HIV test, which was kind of the whole point of all that bloodletting last week.  So the doctor gave me the 20-minute in-office test, and I remain negative.  Not that I had much reason to worry ...  After I left the doctor's, I stopped in Kafka Wines to flirt with the cute proprietor and then I stopped by Sidetrack to flirt with the hunky doorman.  Then I called Keith and Steve, who were just sitting down to dinner with Terry and Kent a few blocks from Sidetrack.  They invited me over and we had a delicious meal, played a few rounds of Scattergories (which I soundly lost) and TiVo-ed our way through tonight's  Apprentice .

      Continuing on yesterday's hot-man theme, I got a pleasant surprise today out of something I thought would be a huge imposition.    See, I was assigned to be a welcome buddy to a new copywriter who started today at work.  Normally, being a welcome buddy is pretty fun -- you get to be the all-knowing hero who shows the new employee around the office, gives him or her the lowdown on the cool and not-so-cool co-workers, explains the intricacies of our labyrinthine billing software, takes him or her to lunch, and stuff like that.  But we're five months into a crisis-level copywriter deficit, and every minute of my day is as precious and special as an original thought in George Bush's head.  So I was NOT looking forward to sacrificing a couple hours of productivity (which I'd have no choice but to make up well into the night) to schlep some new guy from office to office and cube to cube and show him where the bathrooms are and where to get extra pencils.  Then I met him.  WOOF.  Tall and dreamy and gangly in a cute-but-non-threatening-boy-next-door kind of way, his looks alone made introducing him to our co-workers as fun as passing off a rented porn star as my boyfriend at a big party filled with easily jealous friends.  And so far, he's been NICE and FUNNY and GREGARIOUS -- but of course it's his first day so he's probably on his best behavior.  Inevitably, one of our first conversations involved the words "my ex-girlfriend" -- and they didn't come out of MY mouth.  But I'm contractually obligated to remain single anyway.  I'm just happy that we finally have some hot man-meat in the office to make our days more visually appealing.

       Restoring my confidence in (hunky) mankind.   I'm not one to give out my number to strangers in bars -- even cute strangers who show a genuine interest in becoming better acquainted.  In fact, I've done it only four times in recent memory.  And until about an hour ago, not one of them has ever contacted me.  Here's the rundown:  1.  E., the distractingly handsome real-estate agent with abs that actually show through his shirts.  He and I spent a spectacular evening laughing and talking and accidentally bumping into each other at Sidetrack -- on Valentine's Day, come to think of it.  We ran into each other a few weeks later and repeated the same flirtation rituals.  At the end of the night  he  told  me  I should call him sometime.  I gave him my business card so he could contact me, but he never gave me his.  And he's never contacted me.  2. L., the attractive, square-jawed regular-Joe type with whom I had a long and spirited conversation about politics and gay marriage and other social issues during the Academy Awards telecast at Sidetrack.  He left to meet up with some friends, but he asked for my number because he  really  wanted to get together for dinner sometime soon.  Again with the business card.  Again with the silence.  3. T., the hot-hot-hot actor/bartender/whatever at Sidetrack (notice a location pattern here?) whose clingy tank tops and cocky self-assurance have eclipsed any memories I have of what we talked about -- though I do remember that he frequently steered our conversations to the topic of sex ... specifically, what he does with the guys he brings home from the bar.  Weak knees, business card ... silence.  4. R., the  Men's Health -cover-model-handsome teacher (student? I don't actually recall ever covering the topic of employment) I met last night at Sidetrack.  We'd actually met years earlier, but this time we found more of the proverbial "connection" you hear about so much on reality dating shows, and we spent the evening laughing and talking and dropping references to  New Yorker  articles and the theater and getting all arm-around-the-shoulders chummy with each other -- and suddenly a good two hours had gone by and I had to get home and get to bed.  But not before giving him my card.  And today, at the end of the workday (the  scheduled  workday -- it's now after 8 pm and I'm still at work), my inbox chimed with a nice note from him.  And then two more.  And now we're having dinner next week.  Moral of the story:  There  are  cute men who follow through on their promises to call.  It just takes a whole box of business cards to find them.

       I'm in!  I'm in!   I just got home from my interview -- and I've gone from being a mere finalist to being one of the anointed few who will be profiled in  urlLink Chicago magazine 's annual Top 20 Singles issue this July!  So now the whole city will know that I'm completely incapable of maintaining a relationship.  Wait -- that came out wrong.  I meant to say that I'll be profiled as a catchworthy prize in a huge, glossy monthly aimed at an extremely literate and well-to-do demographic.    And did I mention that I'll get to have a photo shoot with a high-fashion photographer?  And that I'll be an attraction at a huge fund-raiser event staged to kick off the singles issue?  (I'm still trying to wrap my brain around the fact that people will pay money to attend a party because I'll be there -- even though they won't even know me.  Yet.  I'll be given pseudo-celebrity status simply because I can't get a date.  Not since the days of Madonna and George W. Bush have people achieved such prominence without providing any real substance.)  The interview tonight was a lot of fun.  (Of course, when is getting the opportunity to blather on and on about yourself to a stranger whose job it is to listen and take notes  not  fun?)  The woman who interviewed me was actually quite interesting and a delight to talk to.  We had a lot in common, and I really enjoyed our conversation.  If I weren't such a big homo -- and if I weren't contractually obligated to remain single until at least July -- I'd probably ask her out.  She seemed genuinely thrilled to talk to me, which bodes well for the content and the tone of the profile she'll write about me.  And she was extremely polite and courteous in the way she never once mentioned the disgusting little rash running up and down my forearms from Saturday's wax job.  (Of course, she never complimented me on my spiffy new shoes either -- so I'll choose to believe she was really focused on her note-taking.)  She also said that people who've been profiled in past singles issues have been inundated with phone calls and letters and flowers and other forms of courtship from amorous Chicagoans.  (Of course, I was once the  urlLink Big Gay Cocktail Club 's featured bachelor of the month -- and even with a Web profile and an email address to help people find me, I didn't get so much as a "good luck finding a boyfriend with  that  nose" from anyone.  Sniff.  In any case, I'd better enjoy my anonymity while I can.  So I'm off to join Matthew at Sidetrack for some show tunes.

       Buyer's Remorse   It turns out there's a reason the sexy black running shoes I bought yesterday make my feet look small: The shoes are too small.  I wore them last night to Rick's movie night (where I just sat in them) and then to Sidetrack (where I just stood in them), and by the time I limped home I realized there was NO way I could ever run in them.  So $40 poorer and infinitely wiser, I now have to figure out what the hell to do with them.  And speaking of the unpleasant aftermath of yesterday's big gay adventure, my freshly waxed forearms developed a LOVELY pattern of red splotches and bumps last night at Sidetrack.  Good thing the lighting was relatively low.  In any case, my gay day wasn't quite over when I made yesterday's post.  We decided to watch  urlLink Victor/Victoria  -- which I'd never seen -- last night at Rick's.  And it was  fabulous  -- especially the throwaway moments like the inspector's barstool and Norma's inability to understand French.

       How gay is Jake?   1) Gay. 2) Gay-ass. 3) Way gay. 4) Gary Bauer.  I'm so gay I had a fabulous spa day today with Paul.  We started at Albert (say it with me:  al-BERRRRRRRGH ), a fussy little patisserie just north of downtown, where we enjoyed petite baguettes and French toast (get it?) and real table linens. Then we walked to a nearby wax-a-torium where we proceeded to get our backs waxed by a strong Polish lady.  And since I have (well,  had ) little-to-no back hair, I opted to get my arms waxed as well. (Ouch!)  Newly smooth, we maneuvered through traffic logjammed around a war protest to just make it to a manicure/pedicure appointment in Boystown.  As some of you may recall, my last manicure ended up being a bloody mess.  This one was MUCH better, though one cuticle has been seeping a bit of red all afternoon.  Famished from our beauty ordeals, we headed to our friendly neighborhood Chipotle, gesturing grandly along the way so everyone could notice our nails and pausing briefly to paw through the sale items at the Boystown Gap before we got there.  We ran into Richard at Chipotle, and he joined us for lunch and the rest of our little shopping spree: Relics Records to check out the used show tunes, Universal Gear to check out the trendy clothing that uppity people wear when they have no personalities to make themselves interesting, and eventually the Mother Ship: DSW, where the three of us managed to buy seven pair of shoes. (Among my newest possessions: black running shoes (that make my feet look a wee bit small, so I can't wear them with flared jeans), trendy flip-flops to showcase my neatly trimmed tootsies and square-toed loafers perfect for jeans  or  dress-up.)  Now neatly smoothed and trimmed and shod, I'm waiting for Matthew to show up so we can head to Rick's for an all-boys movie party.  Whee!

       My niece pooped in the toilet!  Without prompting!   This news just arrived breathlessly in my inbox courtesy of my sister, the proud (and somewhat relieved) mother.  My niece, who is two years and three months, is apparently potty-training herself.  Such a little genius.

      My sinus headaches finally reached the so-painful-I-could-vomit point, so I trudged off to the doctor yesterday afternoon for some nice drugs.  While I was there, I also got a 100,000-mile checkup and some apparently long-overdue inoculations.  After getting poked full of inactive viruses and shedding about four gallons of blood, I tottered off to my friendly neighborhood pharmacy and then home to recuperate.  And since the only way to escape from the workplace we like to call Mismanagementland at an even remotely decent hour is to schedule an afternoon doctor appointment, I magically had my night free.   And since I knew I'd have an opening in my personal life, I had scheduled a date with a charming and dangerously adorable man I met on  urlLink Friendster .  My sinus drugs kicked in rather quickly, so I was able to enjoy our dinner and long conversation as long as I remained mostly vertical.  But to compound my pains from needles and throbbing head regions, I was also feeling the effects of Wednesday's late-night appointment with a personal trainer who KICKED MY ASS (we get one free session a year at my gym -- and it took three months to schedule my session for 2004).  So by the end of the night I was full of holes, weary from vaccines and inhalable steroids, struggling to move every muscle in my torso, and a little giddy from chatting up a beautiful blond.  It was awesome!

      Why this moronic  urlLink crimes against nature  argument won't work:  1) It's impossible to define "nature" for the purposes of legislating hatred in this context. 2) Homosexually -- being completely natural -- regularly occurs in nature. 3) You can't "ban homosexuals from living in the county" for the same reason you can't keep homosexual kids out of the Boy Scouts: People are (almost certainly) born gay, but homosexuality doesn't manifest itself until later in life.  If these cousin-fuckers want to ban homosexuals from living in their county, they need to ban everyone from being  born  in their county.  Or they need to devise a way to ask fetuses (feti?) to declare definitively if they're gay or straight as they're being squirted into the world.  (link courtesy of  urlLink Mark )

       High drama in the home office!    Apparently one of our copywriters quit today in a dramatic huff over one too many "artistic differences."  (When will advertising writers learn that there's no artistry in what we do?  It's just data entry at the behest of the client's legal department -- with the occasional funny headline thrown in to make us feel fulfilled.)  Details are still sketchy, but it sounds like our dearly departed colleague made quite a scene on his way out.  No word on whether he got in any final jabs at the one employee loathed by almost everyone.  But if she were instrumental in driving out a damn good writer in the middle of a crisis-level copywriter deficit, it could help lead to what we will euphemistically call a mass improvement in morale.  MANY fingers are crossed here.  And on the even-more-hopeful side, I'm now the senior-most senior copywriter on staff.  Which puts me first in line (seniority-wise, at least) for an ACD promotion.  Which means more money and more prestige.  And even less time for a personal life.

       Bon jour!   I passed my beginner  urlLink French  final last night -- but just  en pou .  I had counted on getting a few minutes to review conjugations and stuff beforehand, but I counted wrong.  I totally screwed up on the  Qu'est-ce que ...  section, but my surprising clarity on masculine and feminine pronouns saved my overall score and propelled me into the stratosphere of French II.  We start in two weeks.  I hear we'll be learning past-tense verbs -- but the total hottie French teacher won't be teaching my class at the times I can take it.   Mon dieu!   My planned date last night after class was felled by a general malaise on his part and a THROBBING sinus headache on my part.  But once I got home and squirted some industrial-strength drain cleaner up my nose, we ended up chatting on the phone for a good hour.  He took off for his home state this morning, but there are already discussions about me flying out for a visit.  :)

       It was an honor just to be nominated.  I guess.   So the  urlLink chorus  anniversary dinner and awards banquet was last night.  As you may remember, I'd been nominated for two awards:  one for being (or at least thinking I am) the biggest star, and one for having the biggest ... um ... microphone.  I didn't win either award, but I had a very funny acceptance speech prepared for the latter.  It involved thanking all the little people.  Maybe next year ...

       Four flights in four days.   I'm finally home -- and I'm more than a little tired.  But not too tired for a long-overdue blog update!   Boston  on Tuesday and Wednesday was fun ... if you consider six hours of watching focus groups through a one-way mirror "fun."  While I wasn't going to be there long, I had hoped I'd at least get a mini-driving tour of the city as I rode from the airport to the hotel, but all I got to see was the inside of the new traffic-relieving tunnel system.  Whee.  There was one perk in the first focus group, though:  a total hottie with the cutest straight-frat-boy demeanor.  Most focus group subjects exist to reinforce the fact that the population of the United States is quite unattractive, so it was with great pleasure that I sat and watched Tom (I call him Tom -- 'cause that's his name) offer his ineloquent opinions to the group for two hours.  I didn't see  urlLink Brian  moping around the city while I was there, but I did hear a lot of people with his funny Boston accent.  And we got to stand behind Bling-Bling Girl as we waited to go through security at Logan Airport on the way home.  She dutifully took off her shoes and coat and purse and sent them through the thing scanner, but she was shocked -- shocked! -- that her 20 rings, giant hoop earrings, charm-laden ankle bracelet and clunky chatelaine somehow set off the alarms when she tried to wear them through the people scanner.  (And even after she took off all that bling, she was still ugly.)   New York  yesterday and today was a lot more fun -- probably because I was there to attend a schmooze-the-client party.  We stayed in a really cool  urlLink hotel  just around the corner from my friend Arno's office, and I had exactly one free hour to hang out with him and get the 10¢ tour of the neighborhood -- including the beautiful Grand Central Station and the epic New York Public Library.  The client party was at a funky  urlLink restaurant-bar  that was reportedly once a location for an episode of  Sex and the City .  Even better than the swanky restaurant was the ultra-swanky stretch limo we all took there.  (There was a huge line for cabs at the hotel, see, so we decided to ride to the party in style since the limo was right there and could accommodate us all for about the same price as three cabs.)  I'd never been in a limo, and it was as horrifyingly bourgeois as I'd imagined:  color-changing fiber-optic lights twinkling on the ceiling and racing along the entire interior, hip-hop music on the sound system, a bar stocked with cheap liquor and  store-brand sodas , and enough black leather and polished chrome to make a Harley owner weep.  I was a little nervous going into the party and meeting a roomful of clients, though, because the very nature of the situation robbed me of the only conversations-with-strangers ice-breaker I ever use:  "So, what do you do for a living?"  But the clients were fun and interesting, and I was never at a loss for things to talk about.  And one of the guys was even pretty hot -- though he was  clearly  on the prowl for woman-meat all night.  After the Brasserie wait staff made it painfully clear that our party time was over, the heartiest among us stumbled a few blocks over to the ultra-trendy Town restaurant-bar in the shamelessly self-aware  urlLink Chambers hotel .  The bar -- which is decorated in a totally cool minimalist-meets-Goudí vocabulary -- was populated with an interesting mix of patrons and a surly bar staff in Stepford Prada and I'm-more-sophisticated-than-you-because-I'm-wearing-thick-horn-rim-glasses horn-rim glasses.  (It must be  exhausting  to carry around that much attitude all day.)  And among that interesting mix of patrons was a minor celebrity: the hideous man-woman Steven Cojucaru.  I had no idea who he/she was at first, but I kept staring down his/her open blouse to try to determine if he/she was a man or a woman.  After I gave up caring, someone in our party realized we had this bona-fide celebrity among us, but by that time he/she had disappeared into the crowd, never to frighten us again with his/her gender-bending fashion-victim countenance.  Now I'm back in Chicago and looking forward to relaxing at home tonight with some  urlLink trashy TV  and then maybe a trip to Sidetrack.  WHEW.

       Both halves of my trip to Iowa were great!   First of all, the 25-year  urlLink Follies  reunion was a blast.  Follies is this huge song-and-dance extravaganza staged every March in the  urlLink newly renovated Paramount Theatre  by the Cedar Rapids Symphony Guild.  The show is patterned after the Ziegfeld Follies, with a cast of hundreds singing, dancing, doing goofy skits and parading around in fabulous costumes.  The show has an epic budget and a full orchestra, and it always ends up being pretty spectacular.    I was fortunate enough to be a part of Follies for 10 years -- and I even co-choreographed it with my friend Carol for my last two years. (I was also very fortunate to pretty much star in the Jake Show every time I did Follies -- which was a bit of a source of frustration when I moved to Chicago and suddenly I wasn't the big fish anymore.)  Anyway, the reunion brought back a bunch of people I hadn't seen in ages, and the reunion show featured a bunch of memorable segments (including stuff from the aforementioned Jake Shows) from the last 24 productions. It was great to see people, it was great to reminisce ... and it was nice to be the center of attention again after living anonymously in Chicago for almost four years.  :)  The second half of my Weekend of Fun involved Gunnar's fifth birthday.  He'd already had his official party without me at a local firehouse (where they let all the kids get into the beds and then jump up and run for the trucks when the alarm sounded). I got to celebrate with Gunnar and the family (and practically nobody else) this morning at the almost deserted PlayStation, a five-story indoor padded jungle gym with slides and tunnels and bridges and ramps and huge bins of those colorful plastic balls -- and they even let adults climb around with the kids!  Woo-hoo!  It was way too much fun, though my 35-year-old knees couldn't take much more than about 20 minutes of crawling around in the hard plastic tubes.  So while Gunnar and Anna played and explored and exhausted their bountiful supplies of energy, Jenny and I sat in the big ball bin and gossiped.  Just like good parents.  Now I'm back in Chicago for a brief moment before I wing off to Boston in the morning to observe focus groups.  Whee.

      So Thursday night I was at work until 1 am getting ready for a massive client presentation.  And even though I slept in on Friday and got to work at 11, I was still pretty sleep-deprived loopy, and my entire day was focused on getting home and crawling back into bed.  Profound exhaustion notwithstanding, I can always be talked into dinner with friends.  So when Anders invited me to join him and J.P. at  urlLink Vermilion  after work, how could I say no?  (Especially when you consider that we were going so J.P. could review the restaurant -- so our meal was free  and  we got to enjoy it under the helpful glow of his epicurean knowledge.) The food -- an intriguing fusion of Latin and Indian -- was fabulous, and the desserts were even better. So it was worth putting off my much-needed sleep.  But we weren't done yet. After dinner we decided to hit some funky craft co-op store where one of Anders' friends was showing her wares.  Then -- with no real destination in mind -- we climbed in a cab and headed in the general direction of the bars we usually frequent.  We finally settled on  urlLink Big Chicks  -- where I had planned to end up anyway to meet up with Dan and help him celebrate his last day at the job he's hated so much for so long.  But the exhaustion was winning, so after one drink and many congratulations for Dan (and a prolonged smiling-and-flirting session with a cute little muscleboy in a baseball cap about 10 feet away from our table), I  headed home and collapsed.  Now I'm packing and present-wrapping and getting ready to head off to Iowa for a long weekend celebrating my nephew's fifth birthday and the 25th-anniversary  urlLink Follies  reunion -- right after we finish up our final three-hour recording session for the upcoming  urlLink chorus  CD.  Whew.  It's a good thing I got caught up on my sleep last night.

      Five years ago today I was getting ready for my opening night (and my big-theater choreography debut) in a huge song-and-dance  urlLink extravaganza  in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. My last grandparent (my dad’s mom) had died just over a month earlier, and I was a month away from becoming an uncle for the first time -- in plenty of time for me to finish the run of the show and drive 12 hours to be there for the next momentous event in our family’s circle of life.   My sister and her husband had finally overcome some stubborn fertility issues and gotten pregnant eight months earlier, and my little fetus of a nephew had already given us a good  urlLink Trisomy 18  false-alarm scare, but everything was OK and looking great for an early April birth.  But these rotten kids have a way of disrupting your lives even before they’re born.  Little Gunnar decided to make his appearance a whole month early -- after a routine checkup revealed that my sister was a few quarts low on amniotic fluid and had to have a Caesarean section  right now . And that was just the beginning of our family’s birthing adventure.   My sister had been living alone and pregnant in Detroit since January, finishing up as much of her teaching contract as she could while her husband started their new life (and his new job) in Cincinnati. When we learned Gunnar was coming early, Mom, Dad and Steve all made beelines for Detroit from their respective locations in Iowa and Ohio. And I bought a last-minute full-fare ticket and flew to Detroit (first class, which was kind of a disappointment) immediately after our opening-weekend Sunday matinee. But the fun didn’t stop there. Gunnar arrived four days before Steve and Jenny were scheduled to close on their house and actually move. So my little sister, the first-time mother recovering from the pains of invasive surgery, brought her new baby home the day the packers arrived to cram her entire house into boxes. The next day, the movers arrived to cram her boxed-up house into a truck. So our newly expanded family holed up in a back bedroom trying to keep the new baby warm and Loki, the emotionally overwhelmed cat, from bolting out the front door.   The plan that day was to caravan to Cincinnati around 5:00 pm, just as soon as we finished up the final inspection and the closing on the house. But once again, that would have been too easy. A freak snowstorm, which had hit Cedar Rapids soon after my plane left the ground, followed me east, arriving in Detroit a few hours before the abovementioned closing. So newly homeless, we headed to the nearest Holiday Inn where the entire family (including a baby, a new mommy and a thoroughly confused cat) could bond over pizza, shared exhaustion and The Weather Channel. Thankfully, our trip to Cincinnati the next morning was both sunny and uneventful – though the cat escaped from its crate and spent the trip exploring the constantly shifting contents of the boxes in my folks’ minivan.   Anyway, we survived, and little Gunnar has been an endless source of amazement and amusement ever since. I’ve never felt a love as strong and pure and achingly beautiful as the love I feel for our little guy. A lifelong stoic, I now tear up at the slightest emotional provocation -- like watching him sleep or hearing his little voice on the phone or seeing him play patiently with his younger sister ... or even encountering a parent and a young child together here in Chicago. And I now totally understand what I used to see as the annoying way my parents have always doted over me -- bringing me food when I wasn’t hungry and blankets when I wasn’t cold and constantly pestering me with questions and finding other ways to keep being involved in my life.  Little Gunnar is surrounded by so much love that it’s almost heartbreaking, and he doesn’t even realize it.  Lucky little kid.  So happy fifth birthday, little buddy. And thanks for changing our lives so completely.  I’ll see you tomorrow night -- and I can’t wait!  Love, Uncle Jake

      Ugh.    Almost midnight.  Still at work.  No end in sight.    And if you know your employees are going to have an exceptionally LONG day in the middle of  months and months  of long days, what would you do?  Most of you can probably guess the obvious answer: Hold four heats of hamster races in the middle of the afternoon and waste a good hour of productive work time.    Best of all, as we played out this elaborate Kentucky Derby today -- complete with horse-race music and wagering and food and alcohol and half-hearted cheering -- 38 people from two other divisions in the company were hauling their personal belongings past us in boxes because  they'd just gotten laid off.

I'm shocked to find myself defending a Microsoft product, but Lotus Notes is so slow and clumsy and lacking in functional relevance that it makes me want to hurt someone.  For instance: You cannot shift-click to highlight a block of items in your inbox; you have to click on each item individually -- which is a total friggin' pain in the ass.  And when you finish setting up a vacation message, you're given an OK button and a SAVE button -- two options that, it would seem, would give you the same result.  So why the two buttons?  Only the programmers know for sure.

       I never thought I'd quote a  urlLink religious Web site  on my blog, but this is too brilliant:   The Presidential Prayer Team is currently urging us to: "Pray for the President as he seeks wisdom on how to legally codify the definition of marriage. Pray that it will be according to Biblical principles. With any forces insisting on variant definitions of marriage, pray that God's Word and His standards will be honored by our government."  This is true.   Any good religious person believes prayer should be balanced by action. So here, in support of the Prayer Team's admirable goals, is a proposed Constitutional Amendment codifying marriage entirely on biblical principles:   A. Marriage in the United States shall consist of a union between one man and one or more women. (Gen 29:17-28; II Sam 3:2-5)   B. Marriage shall not impede a man's right to take concubines in addition to his wife or wives. (II Sam 5:13; I Kings 11:3; II Chron 11:21)   C. A marriage shall be considered valid only if the wife is a virgin. If the wife is not a virgin, she shall be executed. (Deut 22:13-21)   D. Marriage of a believer and a non-believer shall be forbidden. (Gen 24:3; Num 25:1-9; Ezra 9:12; Neh 10:30)   E. Since marriage is for life, neither this Constitution nor the constitution of any State, nor any state or federal law, shall be construed to permit divorce. (Deut 22:19; Mark 10:9)   F. If a married man dies without children, his brother shall marry the widow. If he refuses to marry his brother's widow or deliberately does not give her children, he shall pay a fine of one shoe and be otherwise punished in a manner to be determined by law. (Gen. 38:6-10; Deut 25:5-10)    G. In lieu of marriage, if there are no acceptable men in your town, it is required that you get your dad drunk and have sex with him (even if he had previously offered you up as a sex toy to men young and old), tag-teaming with any sisters you may have. Of course, this rule applies only if you are female. (Gen 19:31-36)

       ACK!  The pressure!   My Chicago Magazine Top 20 Singles photo shoot is set for Tuesday afternoon -- and I've been busy gym-pumping, teeth-whitening and fake-tanning ever since it got scheduled.  I also just got the information telling what to bring: clothing that I'd wear on "the biggest date of my life ... think sexy" and "something that is special to me."  As for the clothing:  I think I can scrape together one or two (or 10 or 20) ensembles that make me feel sexy.  (Hell, even the most shopping-addicted homo wouldn't dare waste money on pants that flattened his butt or shoes that made his feet look small.)  I'm a little concerned about the "vibrant red background" we'll be shot on -- red is so NOT my color -- but I think I'll manage.  Especially if the fake tan hides my naturally ghostly pallor.  As for the something special:  ACK!  I've been combing through my condo looking for something special that wouldn't have potential layers of creepy, unattractive subtext.  Here's what goes through my head every time I think of something: my first Tempo Award (too showy, looks like my job is my life), the homemade lefse stick that's been in my family for generations (kinda tacky, though it shows a certain level of pride in my Norwegian heritage), the adorable picture of my niece and nephew kissing each other (look at the gay uncle of the little kids who make out!), a piece of Grandma's Blue Willow China (too faggy), a poster of me from "Forever Plaid" (looks like  someone  can't let go of his five-year-old glory days), my nose-hair trimmer (waaaaay too much information) ... you get the picture.  Anyway, Mom and Dad are here for the weekend, so maybe they can think of something.  Fortunately, they'll be very cool about helping their son find a nice boyfriend and settle down.

      Though my family isn't known for its genetically perfect vision, at least our eyesight hasn't started failing until we were around college age.  Not so for my nephew, who is just a month past his fifth birthday.  A sudden bout of heavy blinking and complaints of eye pain have produced a diagnosis of far-sightedness for the little guy ... and a prescription for new glasses.  My initial worry was that he'd be rendered a social dork by the whole thing, but my sister assures me that he's kind of excited about getting glasses because a bunch of his little friends have them too.  Her biggest concern is that he'll now be forced to hide his most-commented-on asset: his beautiful eyelashes.   At least his failing eyesight won't hide my favorite part of him: his hearty belly laugh.  Get the kid laughing hard enough, and there is no way you can have a bad day from that point on.  His sense of humor is so genuine and so ready to bubble to the surface that he makes everyone around him happy.  I just hope he keeps his spirits up when the mean kids (and kids can be  such  assholes) start calling him four-eyes.

       It comes in threes.  One.  Our office submitted 19 entries to the  urlLink  Chicago Association of Direct Marketing  Tempo Awards earlier this spring.  I had to miss the awards ceremony last week while I was in NYC, but we won in nine categories.  I wrote six of the winning entries.   Two.  A control, as I think I explained in an earlier post, is a direct-mail package that always pulls the most response when it's mailed -- and always beats any other package that it's tested against.  It's a Big Deal to have a control in extended circulation, and I used to have two out there raking in the bucks month after month for Citibank.  Now I have three.  We just found out that a package I wrote to sell Citi's co-branded American AAdvantage credit card to college students not only beat the current control, but -- in an world where a 2% response rate is the norm -- it pulled a whopping 40%.   Three.  We just had our monthly staff meeting where we hear news about the company, introduce new employees, showcase prominent creative (today it was the abovementioned control-buster) and bestow the crown for "Brann's Best," which is awarded to an employee nominated by his or her peers for personifying the company's core values, demonstrating leadership, and unofficially sacrificing the most personal life for the corporate bottom line (and apparently to help finance the president's new bass boat).  Guess who won.  Not only did I get a nice chunk of cash and this butt-ugly trophy that the Brann's Best winner is obligated to display for a whole month, but the president read these  glowing  emails about me written by my colleagues.  (Apparently I've convinced everyone here that I have a "great attitude.")  It's enough to make a guy tear up.

       Add another minor celebrity to my growing list of encounters.     I met up with a bunch of  urlLink chorus  guys tonight at Sidetrack for show tunes, and we're singing our little hearts out when suddenly Matthew Rush wanders by with a small army of unattractive hangers-on.  He's just as hot in person as he is in his pix -- but WOW, people either love him or hate him.  The guys around me were evenly divided, with no middle ground.  I personally think he's amazing -- I'd kill for a body like his.  The boy needs to smile, though; as moms have been saying to their kids for generations, nobody likes a scowly porn star.

      So there was a friendly email from Steve waiting in my inbox when I got to work this morning.  And it was coherent and well-spelled, so he passes the literacy test.  But it was conspicuously non-committal, and he hasn't entered into a spirited email conversation with me since I responded, so he doesn't pass the show-some-unmistakable-excitement-in-the-first-24-hours test.  And when my phone rang this morning with a strange number on the Caller ID, he wasn't on the other end.  But the mysterious voice WAS the photographer from Chicago magazine calling to set up my photo shoot for my Top 20 Singles profile. So my day hasn't been completely devoid of dating-news excitement.

       Steve.  His name is Steve.  And I finally got a chance to talk to him tonight!  But first, let me back up a bit: Brent -- aka Truly Scrumptious, the fabulous drag queen for whom I was a backup dancer in  urlLink Who's That Girl?  -- treated us dancers to dinner tonight at Ping Pong.  After dinner, we decided to go see a late showing of  urlLink Connie and Carla  (drag motif! drag motif!), but we had some time to kill, so we headed to Sidetrack first for some show tune therapy.  So we're standing there, laughing and drinking and singing our little hearts out, when suddenly I hear "You're the Fendi guy!"  The crowd parts, the room goes silent (at least in my head) and there he is, Mr. Oh My God, standing right in front of me with that same shit-eating grin that melted me the night before.  (And he called me the Fendi guy because when we first (kind of) met I was wearing a tight black T-shirt with FENDI in huge white letters across the chest.  And now I think I've found a new lucky shirt.)  So Steve and I finally chat.  He's charming.  He seems genuine.  He's totally hot up close.  He's totally into me.  And I suddenly find myself blathering like a drunken schoolgirl.  Fortunately, the bar is loud and he's actually on his way out to meet some friends, so I have limited time to give him the impression I'm a drooling moron.  But before he leaves, he gets my card -- and he PROMISES he'll call me at work tomorrow.  Of course, he'd be the eighth guy this year alone who's promised to call me after getting my number -- without giving me his -- and my phone hasn't exactly been ringing off the hook, if you know what I mean.  But I'm willing to get my hopes up again, because he's THAT HOT.  And maybe he's really cool as well.  (Which would make him room temperature, no?)  So I'm walking on clouds the rest of the night, allowing myself to project a lifetime of happiness on a five-minute conversation yelled over blaring show tunes in a crowded bar.  But what fun is life if you don't set yourself up for a little romantic disappointment now and then?  Ironically, when I was running today I saw Paul -- the only guy I've seriously dated since I moved to Chicago four years ago.  (And come to think of it, we broke up exactly a year ago this weekend.  How weird.)  I haven't seen Paul since last fall, after he announced he wasn't over me and he didn't want to see me anymore because it was too painful.  So maybe this anniversary meeting coincidentally timed to the day I finally connect with Steve is some cosmic sign ... a fate-based changing of the guard, if you will.  Or maybe I'm just a happily single gay guy with a serious case of the hots for a muscledude who smiled at me at a drag show.  Time will tell.

       Dude, this guy was almost  perfect .   We dancer boys were watching from the balcony when the house opened last night for  urlLink Who's That Girl?   The crowd that comes to the show is pretty hot and trendy -- in fact, we were laughing at how pervasive the new gay clone uniform has become: dirty-washed jeans, funky shoes and those striped dress shirts that grip (untucked, of course) at the waist and hug under the pecs just so. The audience was quickly becoming a teeming mass of A-gay cliché, when suddenly in HE walked.  I could tell the guy was amazing, even from the balcony:  He had dark hair, dark tan, well-muscled shoulders and arms, the confident stride of a successful, self-assured man who's well beyond the age of bullshit, and a tight blue T-shirt that hugged everything on him just right.  We watched every head turn as he walked through the crowd and joined his friends, most of whom (thankfully) were also not dressed to assert their individuality by being just like everybody else.  I went downstairs and walked through the crowd myself -- you know, to make sure things were going well with everyone -- but every time I walked by him, he was deep in conversation and never looked up.  I did notice, though, that I kind of know one of his friends through the Internet.  So we do the show and it's fabulous and everyone cheers and screams after our number and I'm standing by the front door afterward talking to friends as everyone is filing out ... and suddenly there he is.  And our eyes lock.  And we grin like drunken fools.  I notice he has a KILLER smile.  Then we look away shyly.  Then we rinse and repeat ... for what seemed like half an hour.  So I go in for the kill.  But it takes a few moments to get to him because the crowd is pretty thick.  And by the time I get near enough, his friends are all there with him.  They're obviously talking about me 'cause they keep looking my way and smiling.  But I'm trapped in that eternal conundrum:  Do you walk up and hit on a guy in front of his friends or do you wait for them to leave so you can do your bidness in private?  They never leave (and he never leaves them to make himself more available, for that matter).  But they all continue looking my way and smiling, and I actually see him blush.  And suddenly, they're heading out the door, looking back at me and smiling all the way.  And like the big feathered chicken I am, I don't follow.  (But in hindsight, I'm glad I didn't; it would have looked  awfully  desperate.)  Now I can't stop thinking about him.  And after obsessing about What Might Have Been during my 6-mile run this morning, I even broke down and sent an awkward email to his friend whom I kind of know asking him to forward my name and number.  I'm not getting my hopes up, though.  Besides, I'm still contractually obligated to remain single until I'm featured in  Chicago  magazine as one of the city's top 20 singles in July.  So it just wouldn't have worked.  But maybe this is my kick in the pants to stop being so damn wishy-washy around guys I like.  So the next muscular, handsome, confident, independently dressed gay man with a killer smile who flashes his pearly whites at me had better watch out -- from now on I'm gonna take even  longer  to chicken out.

       urlLink Who's That Girl?  was a smashing success last night.  Everyone who was anyone was there, and in addition to the standard thousands and thousands of dollars the event raises for gay-related non-profits, it even racked up an unprecedented $6,000 -- the figure rarely hits the $1,500 range -- in the drag-makeover auction.  Our "Xanadu" number drew cheers and screams from the audience, and the little black muscle shirts our drag queen got for us dancer boys looked hot on all of us.  I've spent the day throwing crap out of my closets  wholesale , and in a few hours I'll be back on stage for our second night of the show.  Off to the showers ...

       New York was fun, but exhausting.   Tuesday was all focus groups, but we found ourselves with a 3-hour break in the afternoon.  My colleague and I decided it would be fun to do some shopping, but we quickly realized that the only difference between shopping in midtown Manhattan and shopping on upper Michigan Avenue was the order of the high-end chain stores up and down the street.  She wanted to look for girl things anyway, so we parted company -- and after almost an hour of exploring the retail generica you can find in any major city, I stumbled on a Jean Louis David that could take me immediately.  And less than $100 later, I had fabulous new highlights and a much more under-control 'do.  After the workday was over, I cabbed to Arno's house to begin our action-packed 30-hour vacation. After showering and changing out of my monkey suit, we trekked over to Urge to make fun of the go-go boys. Urge is set up with a bar in the middle of the room, kind of like a race track.  The go-go boys work laps around the bar, trolling for dollars and gingerly stepping around people's drinks.  The trouble is, half the bar is a couple feet closer to the ceiling, so the boys have to either dance around all squatty or crawl around on their hands and knees when they get to that part. Either way, they look pretty ridiculous -- and the three dancers on Tuesday were pretty hot, so it's saying a lot that they came off as more dorky than sexy.  To top it off, they threw fucking  attitude  at everyone there.  Now, I'm not one to pay a buck to cop a feel of a guy no matter how amazing he looks -- and if he acts like I'm not even worthy to be in the same room as he is, he's not even going to get a hungry stare from me.  On Wednesday, Arno took me on an exhaustive tour of practically the entire southern third of Manhattan.  We started at a diner on Eighth Avenue in Chelsea, where Arno explained that Chelsea boys are so superficial that they even have a cool side of the street to walk on (the east side -- make a note of it now so you don't embarrass yourself if you're ever in the neighborhood).    After exploring the neighborhood a bit, we hopped on the subway and came up at Ground Zero.  The site is much bigger than I'd pictured, and though the destruction has largely been replaced with the appearance of a standard-issue construction site, I still found myself choking back tears as I contemplated the abject pain and unfathomable suffering that so many people have endured in and around the site since September 11, 2001.  We silently headed south from there for a sunny walk along the riverfront, stopping for a photo op in front of the Statue of Liberty and then making our way down to the southern tip of the island.  Our path north took us through the rugged, pre-Revolutionary War Fort Clinton, past an all-but-destroyed sculpture rescued from the World Trade Center wreckage and up Wall Street, where we stopped in a small museum dedicated to George Washington and the first federal seat of government in New York.   By then we were way overdue for lunch, so we stopped for some mediocre dim sum and then headed to  urlLink Rice to Riches , the coolest niche restaurant in existence, which serves nothing but flavored rice pudding in funky bowls and an even funkier decor.  For our post-dessert dessert we hit Ciao Bella, where I had a succulent pear sorbet that was the closest thing to sex on a spoon I've ever experienced.  We stopped at a bunch more boutique shops on our way home, where I quickly collapsed into bed for a restorative nap, and then we got dressed for dinner at  urlLink Republic Noodles  and  urlLink Johnny Guitar , a hysterical musical homage to Joan Crawford's cheesy 1954 cult  urlLink movie  -- and I was surprised to discover that the new lead is my friend Richard's oft-mentioned ex-boyfriend.  We capped off our day of exhaustive vacation fun at the Eagle, a leather bar (but then again, what bar called the Eagle  isn't  a leather bar?) waaaay out in the middle of nowhere.  The place held the endless promise of raunchy leatherboy fun, but the raunchy leatherboy crowd just wasn't there -- which may have a lot to do with the floor show:  An aging, thoroughly unattractive man wearing nothing but boots and cheap underwear standing on a pool table painting an abstract, monochromatic figure study on two huge pieces of dirty posterboard held together with duct tape.  If this is some new leather sub-fetish, neither of us found any excitement in it -- or in the crowd standing around watching with the same level of interest you'd expect from a bunch of guys with nothing better to do in a half-deserted bar.  We left after a couple hours to head back to Urge, which was hosting its much-hyped Ass Wednesday, which featured an inarticulate, unfunny drag queen hosting a bare-ass contest.  The winner had an amazing little honey-baked ham tucked away in his pants -- and his first runner-up was pretty well-assed as well.  But by that time the vacation was over and it was time to head home and get ready for this morning's flight back to Chicago.  We have more focus groups here tonight, and then I'm looking forward to a long slumber in my own bed.

       I made it safely to the other side of 36!   My birthday weekend was just PACKED with fun, and I still have the groggy incoherence to prove it.   Friday night , Bill (whose birthday is the same as mine) rented a corner of  urlLink Lizzie McNeil's  and celebrated with tons of people from our office and his wife's office.  The bar is right on the tourist-friendly riverfront in an area filled with fountains and brick walkways and gorgeous views of the city, and it was really cool to just hang out and chat (and bitch about work for a bit).  Best of all, when your co-workers get drunk, you get to hear all sorts of things they usually work so hard to keep inside -- from office gossip to how much they  really, really  like you.  It's good to feel the love -- even if it comes from lovelorn straight women and macho-bluster straight men, and takes a couple of pints of Guinness to get it all out.   Saturday  was a gorgeous day in Chicago, and the perfect opportunity to take my new custom-fitted running shoes out for a spin.  It was my first outside run since the  urlLink Shamrock Shuffle  a few weeks earlier, and I was excited to see what kind of a difference $95 shoes can make in the real world (instead of the boring old treadmill world where I'd been sweating off my advancing age for the last couple months).  I'd planned on pounding out only three miles, but the day was so beautiful and the shirtless men on the running path were so plentiful -- and my shoes were so comfortable -- that I got in a full five miles.  Flush with the pride of accomplishment, I hit the showers and then headed out for some pre-birthday errands: getting makeup and clearance-priced decorations for the evening's Easter-drag-mandatory birthday dinner at  urlLink Pepper Lounge .  The dress and hat I'd bought didn't exactly match, see, so I had to buy buttons or bunnies or flowers or something to sew on them to make them look more like an ensemble.  And I found some little plastic eggs and stuffed bunnies and fake sprays of tiny flowers that  really  gave the outfit a certain flair once they were artfully arranged and secured with a few feet of sturdy darning thread.  The dinner was a hoot, and all the girls looked  urlLink fabulous  in their  urlLink Easter finery  (including Jim and Jeff and Terry and Kent, who have repeatedly pointed out that I've neglected to mention them in my Christmas letter every year since I've known them, so they're getting a whole parenthetical mention in the blog until I can rectify the Christmas issue).  I also got some fun presents, including a fabulous designer purse from Truly Scrumptious.  The purse was adorned with a large H, which I assumed was the initial of some hot new designer I'd never heard of -- but Truly just laughed and laughed and laughed as she explained that the H was for Heidi Holes, my endlessly clever  nom de drag .  After dinner we all paraded through the Cubs game crowds (who never failed to smile and wave and whistle at us -- but who doesn't love a drag queen when she's all holiday-pretty?) over to Keith and Steve's house to admire the progress of their kitchen renovation and watch some TiVo, then I headed home to scrub up and de-drag so I could hit Sidetrack for some birthday fun as a boy.   Sunday  -- the actual big day -- was comparatively low-key after the previous two nights of excitement.  I slept late, got serenaded over the phone by my folks and my sister's family, read some of the paper, watched some TiVo, and then met Paul for a nice lunch at Nookie's.  After lunch, we decided to walk "just a few blocks" to Abercrombie & Fitch so Paul could stock up on underwear (he's apparently started donating his underwear to guys he meets, but that's a story for another time).  I couldn't picture where there was an A&F near Boystown, but I trusted Paul's description of its location -- and 437 miles later, in brand-new flip-flops that shredded my poor feet, we arrived there.  Now, I've always maintained that there's nothing more pathetic than a grown gay man wearing A&F as though he were down with the kids, yo.  So there is a profound irony in the fact that I ended up spending a bit of my 36th birthday clomping through one of its stores on the bloody stumps that used to be my feet.  But Paul replenished his underwear stock and we headed back to Boystown, enjoying the beautiful day and talking about everything and nothing -- and then we stopped in a record store with a  cute  clerk who smiled back and forth with me for a good 20 minutes as he chatted with other customers.  But I had to head home to get ready for rehearsal, so I took off -- and I hadn't gone half a block before Paul called to tell me that the clerk practically broke his neck watching me walk out the door and down the street.    An hour later I was riding with Truly Scrumptious and two other dancer boys to a dance studio to learn Truly's guaranteed-to-be-fabulous "Xanadu" number for  urlLink Who's That Girl?   The show is an over-the-top Vegas-style drag revue that raises TONS of money for some of the most visible gay-related non-profits in Chicago.  This is my third year doing it, and this time I get to be a hot dancer boy in tight black clothes, doing lifts and shaking my honey-baked ham like the Solid Gold dancer I am.  We had a blast choreographing the number last night, and I honestly can't think of a more fun way to celebrate my birthday than dancing around to "Xanadu" with a bunch of hot guys in a sweaty studio.  And now the weekend's over, and I'm sitting at work a little bit tired a little bit sore from all that running and dancing and high-heel wearing.  But I take off early tomorrow for NYC for a day of business and then a day of vacation with Arno.  Be good while I'm gone.

       Estonian Week continues.   Richard, Bob and I got comp tickets last night to  urlLink Slava's Snow Show , which was billed in its advertising as a Cirque du Soleil knockoff -- with images of flying people in bizarre costumes playing around fanciful set pieces.  But the advertising lied.  The show was nothing but clowns.  And mimes.  Nobody flew, nobody exhibited feats of physical prowess ... and nobody showed  any  well-muscled body parts.  Once our initial disappointment wore off, though, we kind of liked the show.  The sets and costumes were as fanciful and colorful and enchanting as those I remember from the opening ceremonies of the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France.  The clowning (though officially NOT my thing) was cute and engaging -- and the audience ate it up.  (There was one boy in particular sitting in front of us with a belly laugh as hearty and joyful as my nephew's.)  And the music they used covered everything from "Chariots of Fire" to "O Fortuna" from  Carmina Burana .  The  Carmina Burana  section, in fact, was the coolest part of the show -- as the set walls disappeared, a bank of blinding lights glared out at the audience and a literal mountain of fog and confetti blew over us as Orff's magnificent score pumped louder and louder through the house.  It was a pretty spectacular ending, topped only by the  massive  (as in 10 to 30 feet in diameter) air-filled balls that followed, rolling off the stage toward us and being bounced around by the audience.  Honorable mention goes to the bathrooms in the historic  urlLink Chicago Theatre .  I'd never been downstairs of that lobby before, and the basement lounge area outside the bathrooms is filled with totally cool columns and flying buttresses and frescoes -- it makes me want to chug a TON of water before I see my next show there.

      It's shaping up to be an Arvo Pärt birthday.  I became fascinated with Pärt's work when I first heard his ethereal "Cantus in Memory of Benjamin Britten" at an otherwise unremarkable  urlLink Hubbard Street Dance Chicago  performance a couple weeks ago.  I mentioned him in my blog, and Arno -- ever the proud Estonian -- promptly sent me a bunch of information on Estonia's most famous composer.   My parents got me Pärt's  urlLink Sanctuary  last weekend for my birthday, and I came home one night this week to find a box with three other Pärt CDs waiting for me courtesy of Arno.  Who knew I'd go from never having heard of this guy to owning what is most likely his entire oeuvre in less than a month?  (And how fun is it to repeatedly type a word with an umlaut in it?  I hope it's coming through OK for you poor unfortunate souls reduced to reading my blog on a PC.)   Other birthday weekend plans are shaping up well:  Tomorrow night is a joint celebration with Bill.  We've been working out together for almost a year, and we just discovered we have the same birthday, so Bill invited the whole office to a shindig tomorrow at some bar near here that he likes.  Saturday night is an Easter-drag-mandatory celebration with 12 of my most not-afraid-to-wear-a-dress-in-public friends at  urlLink Pepper Lounge .  I found a $10 waffle-knit shift in '60s-mod shades of orange and yellow, and I'm going to try to find some fake daisies or huge buttons to sew on it and make it even more hideous.  Top it off with a not-quite-the-same-shade-of-orange sun hat and a scarf I stole from my mom when I was home for Easter, and I should be the prettiest large-boned, gym-built birthday girl in the room.  Then Sunday -- the day I actually bid my early 30s goodbye -- I have a  urlLink Who's That Girl?  rehearsal with Brent (aka Truly Scrumptious).  I'm gonna be a backup dancer (as a boy this year) to his (aka her) big "Xanadu" number.  And I can't think of a better way to turn 36 than shaking my honey-baked ham with Olivia Newton-John and ELO in a place where nobody dared to go, the love that we came to know. They call it Xanadu.

       Easter weekend in Iowa: all the highlights you're dying to know   • I timed my drive perfectly on Friday afternoon -- I pulled out of the Chicago parking garage to the first strains of  urlLink All Things Considered , I cruised across the Mississippi to  urlLink Marketplace  and I pulled into my sister's driveway as the credits rolled for  urlLink This American Life .  • My niece and nephew RAN to greet me when I pulled up and gave me the most satisfying hugs an uncle could ever get.  They spent the rest of the weekend being fun and well-behaved and polite and charming and funny and everything else they could think of to make me get all weepy every time I looked at them.  • Gunnar wanted me to sleep on his bottom bunk, which apparently excited him to no end.  So each night after he put on his pajamas, I got to read four books to him, tuck him into bed and then eventually crawl into the roomier-than-I-thought little bed underneath his after spending the evening hanging out kid-free with the family.   • The Easter egg hunt at  urlLink Brucemore  was cold, but far more fun than I expected.  The kids were still young enough to buy into the magic, the grounds were immaculate and the mansion was as beautiful as I remember (though its endlessly rambling Queen Anne architecture has never been my cup of tea).  I even ran into Jim and Peggy and Janelle and got to catch up with them while we were there.  Jim was my high-school drama director, and Janelle and I have shared the stage in everything from  The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas  to  Starmites  to  Follies , and she's still every bit the diva (in the amazingly talented and force-to-be-reckoned-with-on-stage and respected-by-everyone-she-works-with sense of the word).  She just released her first  urlLink CD , which carried me well across Iowa on my drive home yesterday.  • We celebrated my birthday while I was home (a week early -- there's still time to buy me stuff before the actual celebration on the 18th), and I got socks and  urlLink underwear , which I was in desperate need of, a ton of Gap gift certificates (because a man can never have enough opportunities to shop), and Arvo Pärt's  urlLink Sanctuary , featuring his ethereal "Cantus in Memory of Benjamin Britten."  • I got to sit between Gunnar and Anna at my birthday dinner.  As I was cutting Anna's food for her, she leaned over and patted my arm with her little 2-year-old hand and said "Thank you."  Bliss.  • I sang with the choir at my folks' church Easter morning, and I got to stand between a five-piece brass ensemble and the back ranks of the organ pipes as we belted out a stirring Vaughan Williams piece and Handel's glorious "Hallelujah" chorus.  Best of all, I was right there among the pipes to experience the mighty "Toccata" from Charles-Marie Widor's  urlLink Symphony No. 5  not once but  twice  as two congregations were dismissed.    • On the way home last night, I got to drive in almost 30 miles of stop-and-go traffic outside of Chicago.  In a stick shift.

       My anemic list of not-so-impressive celebrity sightings continues to grow.   Before I get to yesterday's celebrity surprise, though, here's a partial list of the kinda-famous folks I've encountered in my almost 36 years on earth:   Emo Philips  doing pushups in a powder-blue tuxedo at O'Hare, April or May 1991  Jackie Mason , looking one french fry away from a coronary, Carnegie Deli, NYC, April or May 1991  Whoopi Goldberg  at a press conference where she gave a big check to some kids' home, LA, April 1993 or 1994  Matt Gunther  disinterestedly stripping at a depressing gay bar, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, December 1995  Teri Farrel  modeling with me in a runway show at Westdale Mall, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, fall 1996  Jason Branch, Blake Harper  and  some sexy bald guy whose name escapes me  flirting with me on an elevator at the Congress Hotel, Chicago, Memorial Day weekend 2000  Scott Weiland , looking skinny and pale and extremely nervous -- and every bit the epitome of crack-whore glamour -- on a treadmill next to me at Crunch, Chicago, fall 2002  Jason Priestly  in the audience at the Chicago premiere of a movie he was in, fall 2003  Megan Mullally  singing at a concert and then at a reception afterward, Skokie, IL, fall 2003  R. Kelly  hogging all the equipment with his obnoxious posse, Crunch, Chicago, off and on since January 2004  Bruce Villanch  grabbing my crotch instead of shaking my hand in his dressing room at the Oriental Theatre after a performance of "Hairspray," Chicago, January 2004  Which brings us to yesterday.  I had just left work to meet Matthew for dinner, and I was walking up Dearborn to his place in the Gold Coast.  About half a block from Ohio Street, I noticed cops appearing and clearing that street of all cars and pedestrians.  By the time I got there, the street was completely empty, and the sidewalks were lined with curious pedestrians.  Suddenly a massive parade of cop cars, black town cars and buses started whizzing by -- and there, clear as day in the back of a black SUV, was  John Kerry  with his Andrew Jackson hair, Hapsburg jaw and yellow windbreaker.  And as soon as the motorcade shot by, the cops opened up the street and life went on as though nothing had just happened.  (Except I whipped out my cell phone to call my mom and tell her about it.)  What struck me most was the complete nonchalance about the whole episode.  I grew up in Iowa, where even the merest wisp of celebrity in our midst made the front page of the paper for weeks.  And here in Chicago, where a co-worker recently ran into Bill Murray on the street and a friend works out next to Oprah every morning, celebrity sightings are so commonplace they're just not newsworthy.  (Though apparently they're not commonplace enough that I've been able to rub elbows with A-list famous people EVEN ONCE in 36 (almost) years.)

      So Bob and I finally nailed down our dates for Paris and London on Monday night.  And we tried to buy our tickets on Orbitz, but the site kept doing weird things.  So we decided we'd keep trying throughout the week until we got our reservations booked.  And somewhere in the conversation -- I think it was when I complained about how professionally unfulfilling my work life has been lately -- Bob made a comment about how people work only because they know that if they lose their jobs they're just months away from financial desperation.  And the next day, Bob lost his job.  It wasn't anything personal; his department's  raison d'être  wasn't producing any revenue, so the company just eliminated the  raison  and canned the whole department.   So I guess we should thank the make-believe god on our money and in our pledge that we didn't book our tickets the night before.  And I have to either: 1) contemplate doing London and Paris alone this fall 2) think of somewhere else fun to go on vacation this year  Any suggestions?

       Scenes from a gay man's day at the office.    One.   S., the attractive blond who doesn't always dress to flatter her figure, is wearing a blouse that looks great on her boobs today.  I tell her.  She beams with pleasure.   Two.   K., who is planning a wedding in another state, complains about a legal double standard: Women have to undergo a battery of blood tests to get a license in that state while men don't have to do anything but ask for one. "Don't even get me started on the patriarchal double standards that legislate discrimination in marriage," I tell her.  D., who has been here only a week and who has yet to voice any sociopolitical opinions, looks decidedly uncomfortable that there's a goddamn homosexual in the room -- and that he's unafraid to speak his mind.    Three.   J., the new (ostensibly heterosexual) copywriter and arguably the hottest guy in the office (which isn't saying much),  always  sneaks a peek in my office when he walks by.  Nobody else ever sneaks a peek, and hundreds of people walk by my door each day.  It kind of turns me on.

       Weekend Fling Fun   So I met a charming fella last night at Sidetrack.  He was born in South Africa, he grew up in London and he lives in Rome -- so he has a fabulous accent and an educated worldview (and he confirmed my suspicion that Dubya is little more than a moronic child with dangerous toys in the eyes of all thinking Europeans).  Anyway, Tony and I were all smiles (and hands) from the moment we bumped into each other.  Amid the effortless conversation and ready laughs and irresistible urge to suck face, we had a great evening together. And suddenly it was 2 in the morning and I knew my alarm was going to go off in four and a half hours -- assuming I made it home -- to kick off yet another week of long-ass workdays in the wonderful world of advertising.  Tony is winging his way back to Rome as I write this, but we already have plans to hook up when he's back in Chicago in May.  And he said he'll come up and spend time with Bob and me in London and Paris this fall -- assuming our initial glow hasn't worn off by then.  In the mean time, I'm struggling to survive a long day on almost no sleep.  And I kinda like it.

      I dragged poor Paul on all my errands yesterday. First we hit  urlLink Fleet Feet  so I could get custom fitted for running shoes.  I figure most of my running injuries have come from buying shoes off the rack, so I went in for an evaluation that included watching me run in various shoes to find the ones that kept my stride the most true and straight.  $90 later, I now have the most comfortable running shoes I've ever worn.  And possibly the most injury-free running season ahead of me.  After that we hit Home Depot so I could look at ceiling lights.  I found nothing, but Paul walked out with new blinds and three new plants.  Then we headed up to Boystown so I could buy an Easter dress.  More on THAT later.   Afterward, we spent the evening with pizza and ice cream and  urlLink Sleepy Hollow  and Celebrity Teabag.   Tonight on Celebrity Teabag, our mystery guests are Karl Malden and Gene Shalit!

      One of the benefits of TiVo was that I could set it to record stuff like  urlLink Playing it Straight  and then not get so stressed when I had to work late on Fridays  as I always seem to do .  So I crawl home tonight from another long day and head right to the TV for some good trashy hot-gay-boys-pretending-to-be-straight TiVo therapy, when -- ACK! -- it's not there!  Much fretting and cursing later, I turn to my good friend Google, who informs me that  urlLink the show has been pulled for low ratings .  Thankfully, it should re-appear "sometime this summer."  Whew!

      So R. and I finally had our date last night -- and we had a blast!  He brought over his DVD of the ultra-cheesy, poorly choreographed (and even more poorly danced) but nonetheless fabulous  urlLink Les Demoiselles de Rochefort .    The biggest source of fun for me was the casting of a very clumsy Catherine Deneuve as a dance instructor struggling to look graceful with no dance training and a 500 lb. wig throwing off her center of gravity.  Then there's the whole Gene-Kelly-watching-his-glorious-dance-career-slide-down-the-toilet factor -- a whole decade before the final  urlLink Xanadu  flush.  But the costumes and candy-colored cinematography are fabulous.  And  urlLink George Chakiris ' ass looks great in his tight 1967 pants.  Best of all, it's in French with English subtitles -- which helped me immeasurably in my budding command of the language.  (It also helped that R. was right there next to me to help me with my conjugations -- if you know what I mean.)

      I can  not  believe I got all choked up last night watching the special  urlLink wedding  episode of  Extreme Makeover .  See, these two schlubby people not only got free extreme makeovers, but they got a free dream wedding at Disney World too -- the only catch being that they had to endure the endless pain of not seeing each other from the first pokes of their surgeries until their wedding day seven weeks later.  It helped that they seemed like fun, happy, grounded, drama-free people -- and that they both had a sense of humor and decidedly realistic expectations from the whole thing.  But I've recently become wholly and unapologetically anti-wedding (as in anti-ALL-wedding) in the wake of all the anti-gay-wedding sentiment now flowing so copiously and unapologetically from every compassionate-conservative corner of humanity.  I won't sing at weddings, I won't buy Lenox gravy boats for my friends who register at foo-foo houses of expensive finery, I won't waste time and money and entire weekends wearing starchy shirts and sitting in goddamned churches watching people get married ... I'm just over the whole fucking thing.  But then I crawled home last night from another long-ass workday and another too-short workout and I plopped down slack-jawed in front of the goddess TiVo, and before I knew it -- even though the show quickly subjected me to waaay too much coverage of cake tasting and flower arrangements and other inane wedding-planning rituals -- I found myself tearing up as these two people discovered an outer beauty to match the inner beauty they'd already found (and the guy turned out kind of  hot ) and pledged their love for each other in front of family, friends, Mickey Mouse and all those carefully picked flower arrangements.  OK.  So if you ask nicely and fork over the right amount of cash, I  may  be persuaded to sing at your wedding (breeder or otherwise).  But you will NOT get me to sing that godawful "There is Love" song.

       urlLink International Mr. Leather  has come and gone in Chicago, and I'm exhausted. For those of you who aren't 1) gay 2) a leather pig and/or 3) happy to show your ass in public, IML is 26-year-old Memorial Day weekend tradition in Chicago, and it's purportedly the second biggest grossing convention in the city.  So what happens at IML?  First off, a bajillion gay leather enthusiasts converge on the host hotel (and surrounding hotels) and wander the downtown streets in their boots and vests and collars and other leather accoutrements.  They also turn the hotel into a giant pick-up joint and no doubt leave many of the rooms rather sticky and disgusting.  (And they invariably leave random hotel guests from Des Moines and Boise looking positively  ashen  as they survey the goings-on in the lobby.)   Overheard between two women in the lobby who didn't quite grasp the concept of a uniform fetish:  "Let's ask that policeman over there."  A big part of IML is the leather mart, which takes place in the hotel's convention hall just like any other convention would -- except here you have to be 21 to enter and you have to sign something saying you won't be offended by what you may encounter there.  And you can encounter just about anything -- from purveyors of leather vests and chaps and armbands to vulgar T-shirts to porn stars with advanced cases of HIV to videos featuring people who poop on each other.   Best IML T-shirt:   It's not gonna suck itself.  Second best IML T-shirt:   So many Christians. Not enough lions.  Oh -- there's also the competition.  The International Mr. Leather competition.  I've never been to watch any of it, but it's frequently compared to a demented, highly sexualized, hairy-man version of the Miss America pageant.  And while it's the ostensible focus of the weekend, not a lot of people go to it.  I spent a good deal of the weekend hanging out with friends at the hotel, going to the dance events, checking out the leather mart, and just watching the endless lobby parade of gay men in buttless chaps, leather dog costumes and/or random military/police garb.  Some highlights:   People  • New York couple  urlLink Kurt  and George and their adorable friend Matt, on whom I developed an instant crush.  The four of us spent most of Friday night hanging out, eating and watching the IML spectacle unfold.  Matt and I spent a lot of that time flirting -- and when everyone started asking us if we were brothers, I got a weird, strangely exiting narcissistic rush.  (Whenever the brother question came up, we'd make out for our answer.  I really wish more people had asked.)  • Cute-as-a-button junior porn star  urlLink Tag Adams , who turned every head wherever he walked -- and who left an effluvium of poppers in his wake everywhere he went. Either he's a clumsy sniffer or he wears the shit like  eau de toilette .  • Jim and Jim, a sexy little muscle couple from somewhere in the south.  They were the first two guys I met when I got to IML on Friday after work, and they were the last two I saw -- drunk off their buttless-chapped asses -- when I finally gave up the ghost and headed home early this morning.  • Jon, a sweet, adorable man with the sexy high-and-tight and unfailing politeness you'd expect from a military careerist.  • Patrick, a smokin'-hot firefighter with a killer bod and a big red tattoo on the front of his hip, framed by a distractingly sexy Speedo tan line.  Woof.  • A local guy named Jeff.  I'd been warned he was a scabby little butthole, but I didn't believe it because -- though he was definitely cute -- he wasn't nearly hot enough to pull off attitude and still have any friends.  I walked up and said hi and he was really friendly at first.  Then he abruptly ran off and talked to someone else.  Then he came back, and as we were talking again he grabbed some random stranger in the crowd and started making out with him in front of me.  I quickly agreed he was NOT good people and I moved on.  •  urlLink Matthew , the handsome gymnast who successfully sued Cirque du Soleil for firing him for being HIV-positive.  The man is stunning in person, but I was soooooo not on his radar.  Even after we had a 5-minute conversation.   Experiences   • Getting boned in the ass by The Man.  No, not like  that  -- The Man here is whoever set the drink prices at the hotel and all the IML parties.  I paid anywhere from $4 to $6 for bottled water.  Goodness only knows what they were charging for alcohol.  The bitches.  • The tea dance and victory party after the IML competition on Sunday.  I'd never been to any of the IML events, but Dan and I and a group of friends got tickets to these back-to-back dances, and I had a great time.  We arrived at different times (some of us -- ahem -- had last-minute conflicts), and I never did see Dan at either place.  But the venues for the dances -- the minimalist, and brand-new,  urlLink Sound-Bar  and the always funky  urlLink House of Blues  -- were very cool.  And the crowds -- especially at Sound-Bar -- were VERY hot.  • My dance-floor romance with Chris at Sound-Bar.  I saw him as soon as I walked in -- he was muscular in a wrestler sort of way, blond in a Jake-loves-blonds sort of way, and graced with beautiful blue eyes and a sexy, shit-eating grin.  I walked right up and started dancing with him -- and we never lost physical contact until three hours later when he had to leave with his friends.  What little I learned from him in our conversations told me there's no romance in our future, but we did exchange numbers.  And he told me to call him today, which I did.  Guess who hasn't called back?  I never  urlLink learn .  • Dancing for almost five hours straight.  I hadn't gotten a lot of sleep this weekend, I've pretty much sworn off soda (and the accompanying caffeine) and I'm not stupid enough to do the party drugs that enable gay men to dance like ADHD kids at an earthquake -- so I was going on fumes there toward the end.  But there's something cathartic about bouncing around in your own little zone to an endless dance beat.  Throw in a dance floor PACKED with hot, sweaty muscleguys and you pretty much have nothing to complain about.  • Speaking of muscleguys, your self-esteem can plummet when you find yourself invisible in a roomful of them.  But I've either made some huge strides pumping up in the gym (and ripping up my abs with all this marathon training) or I've built up enough of the requisite emotional walls that gay men need to survive in the world, because those pesky old I'm-not-good-enough feelings never surfaced this entire weekend.  Actually, there wasn't enough of me to go around.  Which makes this the most magical IML  ever .

      I was all set to write about yesterday's focus groups here.  About how this was one of the more boring focus-grouped projects I've had to endure: the repositioning of a no-frills credit card.  About how the poor members of our focus groups -- who could have been taste-testing cookies or sniffing shampoos or grading TV commercials -- were asked to parse the differences among four excruciatingly similar positioning statements and discuss exactly what they expect in a credit card.  About how these groups (in surprisingly scenic Teaneck, NJ) were a lot more articulate and educated consumers than I usually encounter.  About how some of them -- though they were ostensibly screened to be  not  involved in advertising, marketing, banking or research -- casually, suspiciously used an awful lot of industry buzzwords in conversation.  About how it's strangely flattering to have perfect strangers spend so much time and energy and genuine  effort  evaluating my writing.  I was even going to make a snide comment or two about one of our clients wearing jeans that were so tight and so unnervingly low-slung that I would bet money she wouldn't let her teenage daughter wear them to school.  But all of this was eclipsed by The Woman at the Hotel Bar.  See, after the focus groups, Darin (my colleague) and I headed to the fabulous  urlLink W Hotel  in midtown Manhattan and then grabbed a bite to eat before we met an old frat buddy of his for drinks.  By the time we got back to the hotel bar, the buddy was chatting up this reasonably attractive woman.  At least she seemed attractive ... until we got up close to her.  She was the archetypal neurotic starlet, painfully superficial, drug-addled in the best Judy Garland/circuit boy tradition, dressed closer to the threes or fours than the nines in shabby designer knockoffs, and clinging both to her fading beauty and to her delusions of professional success.  She also had a huge black eye that she unflinchingly told us she got from her ex-boyfriend.  And in the mere 45 minutes of our lives she sucked away from us, she went from tipsy freak to incoherent alcoholic -- and I saw her down only a drink and a half.  She claimed to be a professional TV and movie actress ("I was a nurse on  General Hospital . A blind nurse.") on her way to an A-list gala premiere for some movie, but when we pressed her for details on the stuff she'd done or the premiere she was invited to, she couldn't produce a single name.  (She wouldn't even tell us her own name.  I wanted to google her to see if there were pix or biographical information about her that I could mock here.)  But she did dig in her purse and produce a 10-year-old publicity photo of herself to show us.  Topless.  What's more, she then flashed us her droopy-ass breasts in full-chest Revolt-A-Vision while digging around in her blouse to find the tan line she thought she had.  And like a horny octopus, she managed to grope our crotches and butts and arms and pecs with alarming frequency as she sloshed her way through our conversation.  But when we made even the  slightest  insinuation that she was a scabby old whore, she got all defensive.  Why did we hang out with her so long?  Only the straight guys know for sure.  Thankfully, they eventually realized how irritating her dubious charms were, and we poured her into a cab and headed to a funky sports bar that was packed with white yuppies but rockin' to the beat of hard-core hip-hop.  And even after an hour away from The Woman, we still reeked of the embalming fluid she wore as perfume.  Part of our evening with her made me laugh (derisively, of course, though still in a fun way).  But most of it made me cry for all humanity.  I have low tolerance for drunks and NO tolerance for sloppy, belligerent drunks, so it's not like I feel  any  pity for her.  But she's someone's sister, daughter, (god help us) mother -- and obviously someone's punching bag.  And if we hadn't been there to see her to a cab, there's no telling what she'd end up with to complement that black eye.  And while I'm on the topic of messy, slutty barflys, I have to report that the W Hotel, despite its amazingly cozy beds and reinvigorating showers and wide assortment of Aveda products, has the distinctive aura of a high-end whorehouse. Even though I've never been in one (high-end or otherwise).

      Tonight's romantic near miss was named Jim.  Or possibly Joe.  And where  urlLink Matt  was hot in a muscleboy-who-may-or-may-not-be-gay kind of way, Jim or Joe was hot in a definitely-gay-muscleboy-circuit-whore kind of way.  He had a boyishly cute round face and a massive set of pecs that looked a little out of proportion next to his only moderately large arms.  But he was friendly and charming and his breath smelled faintly of sweet alcohol.  And for a self-aware circuit boy, he was a proud fan of all the show tunes playing at Sidetrack tonight -- though the poor boy couldn't sing for sour owl shit.  There was only a minimum of touching between us, and he kept talking about heading to the Green Dragon (Greek Pickle? Green Mile?), some Chicago dance club that's gay on Monday nights -- all of which I took as a sign that our conversation was nothing more than a conversation.  He was from New York, here on business.  So it's not like I really needed to make a serious connection with him anyway.  And when he headed out to the Green Tambourine, I left with him.  (Hey, if you're not gonna score with the hottest guy in the bar, at least let the whole bar  think  you are.)  So we kiss goodbye in front of his taxi and I head up the street to my car.  Which is blocked in by a big ugly maroon double-parked sedan.  No note.  No flashing lights.  Just double-parked, as though to say,  Hey, world!  I have a freakishly small penis, and the only way I can feel important is to inconvenience other people.   Not sure what to do, I got in my car and turned on the lights and honked the horn a bit.  I tried to escape via the sidewalk, but there were parking meters and trees in the way.  I found a scrap of paper in my glove compartment and was in the middle of penning a brilliant missive ("The street is not a parking lot, ASSHOLE.  Move your fucking car!") when I realized there was no way I could leave it anonymously on the windshield.  Suddenly another maroon car pulls up across the street and honks and signals for me to roll down my window.  "Are you trying to get out?" the driver, a master of the obvious, asks me.   Well,  DUH.    Suddenly unwilling to be mature about this, I shout back, "Do you know whose fucking car this is?"  "Yeah, I do.  It's a fucking cop car.  You better lose the attitude, my friend," comes the equally mature reply as the driver speeds off.   Friend? As if I would be friends with someone who saw my predicament as not attitude-worthy.  AS IF.    Now I figure one of two things will happen:  The other driver is a cop and has the power to call someone to come move the car but won't do it just to perpetuate the whole assholeness of the situation OR he  will  call someone who will come pull me out of my car, throw me violently across the hood of the maroon sedan and cite me for public belligerence.    Before I can fully contemplate just how screwed I am either way, a shadowy figure creeps up, climbs in the ugly sedan and speeds off, leaving me free to go but genuinely irritated at the whole situation.  Fortunately, I have the power of The Blog to exact my sweet revenge.  Take THAT, you stupid, small-penised copper!

      So after  urlLink chorus  rehearsal tonight, I head to Sidetrack, and it's PACKED.  I make only half a loop through the bar -- noticing how many extremely hot men are locking eyes with me -- when I run into Walt and his friends.  We make small talk, and I'm just about to take off and continue cruising when up walks this adorable muscleguy.   Adorable.   Walt introduces us. His name's Matt.  I've always had a thing for the name Matt.  So Matt and I make small talk.  Cautiously.  I can't tell if he's not interested or if he's as inclined as I am to become extremely shy -- and come off as not interested -- around guys he's interested in.  But suddenly there's a touch.  Then a couple touches.   Then the buddy-buddy arms-around-each-other thing.  The arms stay.  For a long time.  He's definitely interested.  We start talking about celebrities we were hot for when we were growing up.  His list and mine have NO crossover.  Then the  Stayin' Alive  video comes on.  I talk about how homely poor  urlLink Donna Pescow  looked in that movie.  Matt actually knows who Donna Pescow is.  MAJOR points.  He also loved her TV show,  urlLink  Angie  .  EXTRA major points.  He also thought  urlLink Robert Hays  was hot on that show.  BINGO!  We have a match.  Now not only am I hot for Matt, but I'm kinda liking him too.  Friends come and go as we sit there.  We never lose physical contact.  Hands on knees.  Hands in pockets.  Hands casually rubbing up and down backs.  It's all good.  Suddenly we're alone in the crowded bar.  It's time to poop or get off the pot.  He's already mentioned he lives a couple blocks away.  I just happened to have parked a block from his house.  Perfect.  We're all smiles and hands anticipating what the night obviously still holds for us.  We kiss.  A couple times.  Which you NEVER do in Sidetrack because people watch ... and people talk.  Then it comes:  He has to get up early.  He doesn't want to start something he can't finish.  Even if it's something perfectly honorable and chaste.  He really has to go.  He lingers, smiling at me with a huge grin and searching eyes.  We kiss a couple more times.  It was great meeting me, he says.  I'm really hot, he says.  You are too, I say.  He leaves.  Without looking back.  We didn't exchange phone numbers.  Even if we did, he wouldn't call.  They never do.  Because two-hour bar romances never leave the bar.  I'm learning.

      You don't see much of it in  urlLink Troy  -- and what you do see is from the side -- but it is indeed a marvel of structural engineering.  And so is the whole movie, actually.  It takes  major  liberties with the original texts by Homer, but it sews everything together to make a fascinating, entertaining, beautiful piece of cinema ... with the occasional bonus glimpses of Brad Pitt's butt.   The plot.  I was pretty lost when the movie started -- mostly because all the kings of all the armies have the same wigs and beards and outfits and I couldn't tell who was fighting whom.  (I still struggled at the end during all that Trojan Horse mayhem when I had no idea which king was threatening the priestess with the indignity of a lifetime of servitude.)  Thank goodness people refer to each other as "cousin" or "my brother" or "my step-nephew three times removed on my sister's side but from her third marriage" throughout the movie.  That helps.  It also helps that people refer to themselves in the third person ("Homer don't play that") once in a while.  And the movie starts with a parchment map (shot in the obligatory sepia tones) showing how everything collectively known as Greece is on the west side of the Aegean Sea and the lone holdout of Troy is over on the east side.  Which helps make the whole thousand-ships thing make more sense.   The men.  I may never eat a muffin again.  The three lead bodies manage to fill the hearts of gay men with simultaneous levels of admiration, jealousy, lust and inspiration.  And this movie may single-handedly bring back the smooth circuit-boy aesthetic that the fashion world has been trying so hard lately to cover with body hair.  In addition to the ripped, sinewy, endlessly luscious body on Brad Pitt, we also have the hunky Eric Bana flashing his mighty physique around pretty often.  And even twinky little Orlando Bloom is pretty buffed out -- though he looks very much like a little boy in comparison to the aforementioned beefcake.   The rest of the cast.  The actress playing Helen is pretty, but I think her face would have better luck launching a thousand campaigns for open city council seats than a thousand ships.  The actor playing Achilles' "cousin" (more likely his lover, according to the original texts) Patroclus isn't so terribly hot either.     Random thoughts.  How nice that the city of Troy was set back far enough from the beach that the royalty could sit in the shade, sip mint juleps and comfortably watch a bazillion guys slaughter each other on the front lawn outside the city gates.  Speaking of a bazillion sweaty dead guys lying on the beach in the sun, I'm glad the plot made mention of the troops gathering and burning their dead, because after the first battle all I could think of was how bad the place would smell if they were left there to rot.  Speaking of the dead, each corpse gets coins on his eyes before he gets burned -- which had to cost a bundle -- except for the one character whose death prompts a conversation that specifically mentions putting coins on his eyes.    More random thoughts:  Every finger and every foot on the screen -- even in the heat of battle -- is noticeably well-manicured.  Which is nice, because nobody likes ancient warriors with scraggly cuticles.  Eric Bana's baby is frighteningly huge.  Brad Pitt's Achilles is a nicely nuanced, wholly complex character: savage in battle, arrogant in politics, tender and loyal in personal relationships, openly atheistic ... and blessed with that amazing honey-baked ham tucked in the back of his skirt.  When the men take their shirts off, the camera often cuts them off right above the pubes -- which has given me a new appreciation for (OK, obsession with) the treasure-trail area.   So it's a very cool movie.  Go see it.  Bring a Kleenex if you don't think you'll be able to contain yourself during the butt scenes.  Meanwhile, I have to do a thousand crunches and slather myself in self-tanner.

      Since I'm  urlLink not  going to London and Paris with Bob in the fall, I suddenly have two weeks of unplanned vacation and no idea how to spend them.  A few ideas I'm tossing around:   Los Angeles  to see the Frank Gehry's spectacular new  urlLink Walt Disney Concert Hall .  The L.A. Philharmonic's full season in the new facility doesn't kick off until October -- and one of the first concerts is programmed with some  urlLink amazing music , including Saint-Saëns' epic Organ Symphony, which I've never heard live.  The concert hall is reported to have some of the best acoustics in the world, and the installation of the new organ has been the subject of endlessly giddy media coverage (at least among the media that consider the installation of a world-class pipe organ to be endlessly newsworthy). Unfortunately, the concert is the weekend before the Chicago Marathon, so I'd have to do a lot of rationalizing to justify missing my last training hurrah before what promises to be the most miserable (and theoretically the most exhilarating) weekend of my life.   Seattle  to check out Rem Koolhaas' funky new  urlLink public library .  (I know.  How lame is it to travel halfway across the continent to visit a library?  But I've never been to Seattle, and this building is creating as much buzz in the architectural world as Gehry's L.A. Concert Hall.  And I've already started an architectural-vacation trend with my recent road trip to check out Santiago Calatrava's alar new addition to the  urlLink Milwaukee Art Museum .)   D.C.  because I'm a sentimental fool for American history, and I haven't been there since my family and I watched the media circus outside the courthouse where Monica Lewinsky was giving her crucial-to-the-security-of-America testimony in 1988 or 1999.  We're long overdue to impeach another President -- this time for legitimate reasons -- and maybe I should plan my trip now so I can be sure I won't miss any of the fireworks.   New York City  for a dedicated vacation instead of these one- and two-day work trips.  There are tons of shows I'd love to see and tons of museums I have yet to experience there.  I've never been in the Guggenheim, and I'm dying to get back to  urlLink The Cloisters  and  urlLink Rice to Riches .  And I have yet to encounter an  urlLink A-list celebrity  in my 36 years on earth, so I'm thinking a long NYC stay might be the place to accomplish that noble goal.    Other suggestions  are always welcome.  So are tour-guiding offers.

      I ran into Paul last weekend after losing touch for at least a year, and we decided to get together tonight after work.  I met him up by his place and we had a great  urlLink dinner  (peppercorn steak salad ... mmm) on the sidewalk in the tony Oak Street shopping district.    That's one thing I love about living here:  When the weather's nice we Chicagoans just POUR out onto the sidewalks to enjoy dinner right up next to the cars and the pedestrians and the trees that drop things in our drinks.    On the way home, I stopped at Express Men to get another pair of the low-cut, ass-hugging, crotch-accentuating jeans I bought last week on my shopping adventure with the other Paul.  Now I have three pair of jeans that are exactly what I want, and I hereby disown all the jeans that I don't really like and I never wear but I bought them because they were on sale.  (Best of all, now they won't all fall on me every time I open my closet.  So three pair of $60 jeans is really more of a safety investment than a fashion obsession.)  I stopped at Dan's on the way home to love up his cat and take in his mail while he's off becoming a new uncle.  And now I'm safe at home in my 24th-story perch watching an amazing storm rage outside.  Very cool.

      [break it down: sytten = seventeen, de = of, Mai = May]  As I'm sure the endless media coverage has made you thoroughly aware, today is Norwegian Independence Day -- celebrating the 1814 Constituent Assembly at Eidsvold where we signed our new Constitution and began our quest for independence after 400 years under the oppressive reign of the (not so great, it would seem) Danes. (We joined into an unholy union on this day with Sweden and didn't gain our full independence until 1905, but that's a rant for a different post.)  First of all, I thank all of you for wearing red and blue today to help me honor my heritage.  It's touching.  Really.  Our office had a huge Cinco de Mayo celebration (on May 5, for those of you struggling with the translation) complete with margaritas, burritos and a roving mariachi band.  I wanted to stage a similar Norwegian celebration today at work, but -- as you can imagine -- all the local Norwegian shouting choruses had been (regrettably but understandably) booked months in advance.  And I ran out of time this weekend, so I didn't get any lefse or lutefisk or rommegrot made to bring in and share.  I'm sure we have some leftover piñatas lying around somewhere and we could probably get that mariachi band back here  muy pronto , but I don't think Great-Great Grandfather Gustav -- who came to America on a boat with a fjord motor -- would approve.  So I will just leave you with some Norwegian good cheer (which is easily confused with Norwegian bad cheer because we're a stoic people) and sincere wishes for a very happy Syttende Mai.  Go Norsk!

      (Not that I'm keeping track.  I know this is my 300th post only because the new blogger  urlLink profiles  tell me how many posts I've made.  I wish I had something momentous to report to commemorate this auspicious occasion, but I'm still not pregnant and Dubya still hasn't been sucked back into hell, so I guess I'll just tell you about all the cool things I did over the weekend.)  - Dan and I saw  urlLink Mean Girls  Friday night.  While it isn't amazing, it's a lot of fun.  I think Tina Fey is brilliant, and her freshman attempt at screenwriting has a lot of what I love about her: a dark sense of humor, deep jabs at the jabworthy, a profound appreciation for the absurd, thoughtful social commentary and a fearlessness about making her characters (and herself) look foolish. And while the movie has a predictable Bildungsroman story arc and some emotionally illogical plot twists (Regina transitions from universally loathed bitch to universally pitied sympathetic character with alarming ease), we thoroughly enjoyed it.  We also enjoyed the clear intellectual demarcation between the two segments of the audience we sat in: teenybopper girls who giggled at the superficial humor and camp-savvy gay guys who shrieked at all the gay subtext.  - Matt and I officially booked our March trip to Paris.  Which means my October trip to London and Paris with Bob is off.  Which means the  urlLink psychic  was wrong about my fall trip to Europe being a good one.  Which also means I'm free to train for the Chicago Marathon all summer and run it with my brother-in-law in October.  Which means I guess I didn't learn from last year's  urlLink injuries  and I guess I'm training for another marathon this summer.  - On Saturday, Paul and I headed off to nearby Skokie to burn off all my birthday gift cards at the lovely Old Orchard Mall.  (It really is a lovely mall, with a mixture of high-end chain stores and funky boutiques, a food court that's more on the gourmet end of the fast-food spectrum, and classical music piped throughout the common areas.)  I was loaded with store credit all over the mall, and I walked out with three pair of dress pants, two pair of shoes, some funky shorts and four Old Navy T-shirts.  I love Old Navy T-shirts.  They don't last long, but they're built for the bodies of tall lanky men -- they hug my pecs just right and hang well off my wide shoulders, and the sleeves end right at the point on my arms that accentuates just how big they are ... and I always get hit on when I wear them.  I also had a jeans-buying epiphany of sorts when I was there: I have a closet full of $20 jeans I never wear because they're not exactly what I want but I was lured in by their price.  So from now on I'm going to fork over the dough for expensive jeans that are just what I want and then actually wear them.  And I started on Saturday with some sexy low-rise, crotch-accentuating, slim-fit dirty-wash jeans that were only $60.  - And I wore those sexy new jeans (and one of my sexy new shirts and my funky new shoes) to Sidetrack on Saturday night, where my usually unnoticed ass got tons of attention.  But the evening wasn't all peaches and beans.  See, there are these four guys I see there all the time.  I'm totally hot for them, and two of them are actually really nice (read: they flirt back).  So I'm standing there Saturday talking to some friends when I notice two of my guys are getting all friendly with each other.  One disappears and comes back with his coat  and they leave together -- right in front of me.  ACK!  Reeling from this cruel assault to my senses, I stumble into a different room in the bar where  I encounter the other two guys flirting with each other so much they're steaming up the windows.   I left before I could see first-hand whether they, too, left together, but I get the feeling they dispensed with the formalities of going home and they just did it right there on the bar.  - Sunday was gorgeous in Chicago, and I decided to do a little three-mile sprint along the lakefront instead of my usual 6-mile distance training run.  But the weather was so nice and my faster stride wasn't killing me so I kept running to the six-mile turnaround.  Then I decided to tack on another mile.  At the seven-mile turnaround I could see there were a ton of shirtless guys playing volleyball just ahead on North Avenue beach, so I kept going.  And by the time I'd passed the volleyball courts (fields? diamonds?) I was 4.25 miles from home.  So I got in a full (do the math with me here) 8.5-mile run today -- the longest distance I've ever run.  Woo-hoo!  And it's only May, so I have a feeling I'll be in fine shape for the Chicago Marathon in October -- now that I'm officially running it.  - We got all our music for the Pride show and the Montreal gala tonight at  urlLink chorus  rehearsal, and our musical director never ceases to amaze me.  He's programmed some beautiful stuff in Latin, French, German and this pidgin-Celtic scat language that's actually going to be fun to sing.  In an attempt to avoid issues surrounding copyrights and royalties, he's even written two songs.  One is his own setting to a slightly erotic passage from Song of Songs, and the other is Walt Whitman's scandalously homoerotic (at least by post-Civil War standards) "This Moment as I Sit Alone," which he's set to a haunting movement from Rachmaninoff's Cello Sonata.  - The pidgin-Celtic song has some wicked syncopations, so we were learning rhythms and notes tonight on the syllable "dee" -- and the relentless "dee deeeeee d'dee" we were all chanting reminded me of Cartman's attempts to look and sound  urlLink retarded  so he could win the Special Olympics on South Park, and I got a bad case of the giggles.  Brian got them too when I explained why I was laughing.  We almost got in trouble.

And he was the first person to link to my blog from his (a source of cybervalidation that can really make a guy feel all warm inside).  Five (?) years later, we've become friends, we've had back-and-forth visits, and Mark has offered me tons of help with my blog and Mac questions.  So happy birthday, Mark!

      I booked a July trip to Montreal a few weeks ago over the phone, and I just realized I've never gotten any confirmation materials about it.  So I went online -- and not only was my reservation there, but I was able to change my seat right on my screen.  How cool is THAT?  And this just in from the Department of Freaky Travel Coincidences: As I was writing the above post, Matt called with an INSANELY good deal on a trip to Paris in March.  And since my trip to Paris with Bob this fall was pretty much canceled when he lost his job last month, I think Matt and I are going to Paris in 2005!  Woo-hoo!  This change of travel plans has all sorts of other implications, though:  If I'm not going to Paris in September/October, I'm going to be in town for the Chicago Marathon, which my brother-in-law now wants to come here and run.  Which means I'll feel like a big fat pussy if I don't do it with him.  Which means I guess I'm training for another marathon this summer.  Whew.  I'd better stop typing.  This post is already making me  exhausted .

      I'd never even heard of Nate Berkus until last Tuesday when the  Chicago  magazine photographer told me she wanted to fix us up.  Since then I've learned that he's Oprah's favorite designer, that my sister would give anything to be his sister-in-law and that my friend Anders is friends with a woman who works with him.  And then tonight came.  The night I peed in his old toilet.  But let me back up a bit here: I've always loved  urlLink Matthew's fabulous Gold Coast condo .  I knew his ex-boyfriend is an interior designer who gutted the place and redid it when they bought it from some other designer.  And tonight, when I was sitting on Matthew's couch talking about all these sudden Nate Berkus connections in my life, I learned that  Nate Berkus is the designer he bought the place from.   Matthew also reports that Nate is very cool, and he thinks we'd make a nice pair.  And now I'm officially intrigued.  And terrified.  What if he finds out I still have a card table in my dining room?  ACK!

      I'm off to observe more focus groups this afternoon.  Unfortunately, they're right here in Chicago.  So I get no day trips to exotic cities, no airplane adventures and no free miles in my account.  But the focus groups will be right next door to a Gap, and I do have $70 in birthday gift cards burning a hole in my wallet.  And then I'm meeting Matthew for dinner.  So the afternoon won't be a total loss.

      My sister has been beside herself with excitement contemplating the potential implications of the  Chicago  magazine photographer's  urlLink offhand remarks  last week that she wants to set me up with  urlLink Nate Berkus . (The photographer has not done anything to follow up on her remarks, by the way. And I think that my sister is  far  more interested in the benefits of having a talented and disarmingly handsome designer-in-law than in securing her brother's romantic happiness.)  Anyway, I had never heard of Nate Berkus (who is apparently Oprah's favorite designer), and when my sister breathlessly informed me that he was going to be on Oprah yesterday, I TiVo'd the program and watched it last night. And aside from being affable and talented and filled with a charming aw-shucks self-confidence, Nate is also an undeniable hottie. (He has this Jude Law thing goin' on, and I've been a Jude Law fan since I saw him naked on Broadway in "Indiscretions" in 1995 -- way before he was famous.)  I also really like what Nate did with the apartment makeover on yesterday's show.  (I also like the fact that the apartment belonged to a woman named Jenny (my sister's name) and she had a son named Jake (my name).  Coincidence?  Fate?  You decide.)  I have since learned, though, that I have another tenuous connection to Nate through my friend Anders.  And Anders thinks that Nate is a lot shorter than I am.  And everyone knows that you choose the filthy homosexual lifestyle so you can meet someone your own size and double your wardrobe.  So the Nate-and-Jake thing probably would never work out.  While I was getting caught up on my television culture last night, I also saw the  Queer Eye for the Straight Guy  featuring the  urlLink breathtaking figure skater  with the thighs and abs of death and the brilliant  urlLink  South Park   featuring the Ninja weapons, a not-so-invisible Cartman tiptoeing naked across a stage, and a message lambasting our culture's fascination with violence and misguided offensensitivity to nudity.

      Another chance to run along the lakefront and enjoy the last fading blooms and faint perfumes of the lilac trees.  (Wow.  That was almost poetic.)  And another six miles.   Oy.   I could NOT keep my pace up tonight.  And I think it was because I ate a lot of crap at work today (new employees and big-wig client meetings = lots of tempting doughnuts floating around the office) and because I didn't eat enough of  anything  before I took off running.  I'm also becoming very bored (and  very  frustrated) with my inner dialogue.  No matter what I try to stick in my head as I run -- be it a song or the conversation I imagine I'll have someday when I find myself sitting next to Oprah or Ted Allen on the 147 bus -- my mind invariably wanders and I find myself running inexplicably to an endless loop of the bridge from Billy Joel's "Pressure":   All [run] grown [run] up [run] and [run] no place to go  [run] [run] [run] [run] Psych [run] 1 [run] Psych [run] 2 [run]  What do you know?  [run] [run] [run] [run]  All [run] your [run] life [run] is [run]  channel 13  [run] [run] [run] [run]  Sesame Street  [run] [run] [run] [run]  What does it mean?  [run] [run] [run] [run]   You can see how frustrating it can get.    And I'm not bashing Billy Joel or even "Pressure."  It's just that I've been running -- unintentionally, I repeat -- with that song in my head for 10 years now.  Maybe if I train myself to run faster than my well-entrenched 9-minute-mile pace I can upgrade to something faster.  Like "Uptown Girl."  (Note to self: The Polo Ralph Lauren tighty-whities are too old and waaaaaaay too small after repeated shrinkings in the dryer to be worn running.)

      You know how you can get in a rut, doing the same things and going to the same places, and when you break out of it you're pleasantly surprised that there's a world of people out there beyond your scope of personal experience? That's what happened to me last night, when I discovered the delightful world of  urlLink lesbians .  Paul had invited me to join him last night for  urlLink A Taste for Every Palette , a food-sampling social event raising money for the women's services programs of the Howard Brown Health Center, which is best known for serving the health needs of Chicago-area gay men.  As with every expensive fund-raiser serving the Chicago gay "community," the see-and-be-seen homosexuals were out in legion force -- though not at the Stepford levels you usually encounter at the events serving specifically men's interests. The wonderful twist at this event, though, was the prevalence of gay women.  I just never see gay women in my usual social tracks that take me from home to work to Boystown to the Chicago lakefront trail, and it was so great to be in a room filled with gay women unafraid to hold hands and smooch and socialize and have a great time together just like us fags do.  And I feel the need to make a few comments about stereotypes here:  They exist for a reason.  Gay men -- at least the ones I encounter at bars and social events such as these -- tend to dress on the trendy side of normal, use copious amounts of hair product and go out of their way to show the world they've spent a lot of time at the gym.  (I realize this is an overgeneralization, but by and large it's a very observable truth.  And I am more than guilty of helping perpetuate this image.)  In contrast, the women at the event last night tended to have short, sensible hair and dress in pants and conspicuously unsexy tops.  And they were  far  more gregarious around strangers than the status-conscious gay-male stereotype allows.  Just an observation.  One more observation:  This lesbian gender-bending stuff was seriously jamming Paul's and my gaydar last night.  There were a couple times when we commented on a cute guy across the room, only to discover that he was really a boyish woman with a sexy haircut.  ACK!  The event itself was a lot of fun.  There was an amazing variety of foods, and I think I sampled every dessert available.  (Of note were a chocolate cr�me br�l�e with fresh raspberries and a chocolate ganache cake with a raspberry pur�e.  And I'm not even a big fan of chocolate and raspberries together. But I  am  a fan of including diacritical marks in the names of foreign dessert foods. Such fun!)  It was held at the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum, which I've always wanted to check out.  The exhibits that were open to us party-goers weren't all that amazing, though.  There was a large butterfly sanctuary that was kind of cool, but everything else seemed to be artificial representations of things -- an odd curatorial choice for a place that bills itself as a "nature museum."    While I was there, I even got my picture taken by a Joe Photo guy from  urlLink boystownchicago ! The Joe Photo guys  never  take my picture at the events I go to, and my photo op makes me suddenly feel so relevant in the gay Chicago social scene.  After the event died down, Paul and I headed over to Sidetrack for some lesbian-free show-tune fun.  The place wasn't as crowded as usual, but we put in a good couple of hours of musical theater therapy and then headed home to sleep with our heads full of kicklines and our bellies full of chocolate.

      So blogger has added a ton of cool new things I've always wanted to include here (like a comments section) and a ton of other things that are at once meaningless and confusing to me (but I turned them all on in the formatting options window anyway -- I hope they don't initiate the clubbing of a seal or a voting for a Dubya every time I make a post).  And how macho-cool is this new template?  It doesn't have a dedicated space for all the links I've amassed since I started blogging last July, but I'm gonna try to figure out how to get them back in the next few days.  It also didn't import all my hand-bolded headlines into the new headline format, but I think we'll all manage as we scroll through old posts and relive the magic of the last year.  And as far as I can tell, the new template also doesn't let me include pictures in my posts either.  But my mugshot should appear in the profile section at the top right of your screen someday soon.  While we're on blogging news,  urlLink Rich  introduced me to  urlLink chicagobloggers  this weekend.  Too fun!

      Another beautiful day yesterday.  I ran six miles along the lakefront, took three loads of recyclables to the dumpster, scrubbed the shower and stayed in the house for an hour to watch the dishwasher run (last week's Drano adventure has made a noticeable difference in my slow kitchen drain, but I didn't want the dishwasher to back up through the sink and make a mess).  See what a glamorous life I lead?  Dan came over last night for a long-overdue viewing of the finale of The Apprentice.  We were going to have a leather bar night and wear all the leather we own but never use, but we just found out the Cell Block closed.  And the Eagle is gross, so we didn't really want to go there.  So we compromised:  Sidetrack in black T-shirts and leather wristbands and then the Eagle in our vests.  Sidetrack was waaaaaay more fun.  Among the tons of hot, friendly guys there was Steve, the erstaz dream date from Tuesday night.  Once again, he was all friendly and flirty and genuinely glad to see me when we talked -- but I watched him for a while and he's the same way with everyone he talks to.  Kudos to him for being such a damn nice guy all the time.  Frustrations to me for misinterpreting it all.  The Eagle was just as gross as I remembered, and Dan and I were easily the hottest guys there (which is not saying much of anything, I assure you).  But then this sexy little go-go boy walked by and grabbed me before he did his thing in this caged-in stage area.  And he kept smiling down at me the whole time he danced.  And by the time he left to go wherever go-go boys are obligated to hide after their little featurettes, I had his phone number in my pocket.  (I always feel so pretty when hot go-go boys like me even after they realize I'm not gonna stuff any dollars in their pants.  But it's always such a hollow victory when you try to talk to them.)

       Hsueh Day Fun!  (Say "Shay Day")  Yesterday was Hsueh's birthday, and about three lanesfull of us helped her celebrate at the new  urlLink 10pin  in the House of Blues Hotel.  In typical fashion, my bowling started pretty impressively and got steadily worse as the night wore on.  We bowled three games (rounds? innings?), and I went from finishing second in the second game/round/inning to finishing second from the other end in the third.  ACK!  But I do want to take this opportunity to thank Mrs. Hutchinson, my grade-school gym teacher, for showing me the proper bowling choreography when I was in the fifth or sixth grade.  Thanks to her skillful instruction, to this day what I lack in downed pins whenever I go bowling, I more than make up for in form.  As for the much-ballyhooed 10pin, I'm not too impressed.  The decor is cool but not quite cool enough, the food we had was fair to middlin' and the automatic scoring machines failed to notice about every third ball we sent hurling down the lanes, so it required endless resetting.  But there are HUGE big-screen TVs playing over the pins, and I bowled my first two games/rounds/innings right into the cartoon set of  urlLink The King and I . (Come to think of it, my scores dropped precipitously as soon as the show tunes ended.  Coincidence?)

      A day trip to New York.    A not-so-good client meeting: Our client changed the parameters of our assignment  after  we did the work and flew there to present it.  Another minor celebrity sighting: Dick Gephardt browsing among the overpriced crap at the LaGuardia Brookstone store.  A horrible surprise when I got home:  TiVo taped a South Park rerun instead of the Friends finale.  ACK!

       No cavities.   My teeth are actually "boring," according to my dentist.  But my hygienist told me that with all the bleaching I've done, my teeth are never going to get any whiter than they are now.    Don't these people know I'm gay?  How am I supposed to find a decent husband if my teeth are only marginally blinding?  Sheesh!

       I guess you could call this a very good day.  The photo shoot.  Six words: I should do this every day. I spent an hour an a half being LOVED by these people.  Someone brought me water, someone picked out my wardrobe and STEAMED it for me, someone fussed over my hair and makeup and lighting, someone fussed over my clothes every time I shifted my body in front of the camera, the photographers kept telling me how hot I looked and cracked jokes and acted like they were having the best time of their lives taking my pictures ... and now I officially want to be a full-time model.  It really IS the high-glamour lifestyle we'd all suspected it was!  I also now have two names to drop:    1.  urlLink Hunter Hillenmeyer , a Chicago Bears linebacker, had his pictures taken after mine.  The man has amazing eyes and a pretty decent body.  But he's all of 23 years old, and I'm guessing he could buy and sell me.  And I learned that while most of us anonymous Top 20 Singles were nominated and picked based on our personalities/profiles/looks, people like Hunter were ringers specifically recruited by Chicago magazine to add star power and increase sales.  So I can't decide if I should be insulted that I'm not a big enough name to sell magazines (as if) or extremely flattered that I was picked to appear among some certifiably famous locals.  2.  urlLink Nate Berkus , who is apparently Oprah's favorite designer and quite an accomplished young business man to boot, is now a potential blind date for me.  One of the photographers today is friends with him, and she insisted that he and I would make a  great  couple.  I told her to fix us up and she seemed genuinely excited at the prospect, but I'll believe it when I see it.  Because I'm gay, I also feel obligated to mention that I got in a pretty killer chest workout yesterday and a  major  killer arm workout today so my guns would look their buffest in all the tight short-sleeved shirts I packed for the photo shoot.  Of course, of all the 20 shirts I brought along, the stylist picked one of the two long-sleeved ones for the pic.  I just thought I should mention that.  One more piece of news:  After all my fretting about having to bring "something special to me" to the shoot, they decided not to use any of the crap we lugged to the studio for our photos.  Whew.    The run.  I got home from the shoot at 5:30 -- which gave me plenty of time to get in a nice long run before my dream date with Steve.  And what a gorgeous day for it!  The weather was perfect, the trees were in bloom, the lilacs were flowering and deliciously fragrant, the sky was a gorgeous blue rivaled only by the shimmering blues of the lake, and I just kept drinking in the sheer fabulousness of it all and pounding away until I'd gotten in a good six miles.  And now my thighs are  screaming .   The date.  Ah, the date.  Steve picked me up promptly at 7:30 in his sexy black SUV, and he took me to  urlLink Hopleaf , a nearby tavern/restaurant that serves delicious Belgian food and offers an endless menu of Belgian beers.  He looked amazing -- even more amazing than I'd remembered.  Better still, he had interesting things to talk about, he's traveled all over the world, he was unfailingly polite, he was absolutely  fascinated  by me and our conversation was effortless -- until we got to the topic of the gay cruise I took two years ago.  Which got us to circuit parties in general and then drugs in specific.  And it turns out he's an unapologetic (and rather proud, actually) drug user.  AAAAARRRRRGGGHHHHH!  (I was profoundly disappointed by this revelation, but it sure took the pressure off as far as me trying to make a longstanding romantic impression -- and I spent the rest of the night just enjoying our date.)  Anyway, it didn't spell the end of our evening, which also took us to an obscure little bar where he wanted to hear a friend of his give (of all things) an accordion concert -- but he had the wrong night and the place was deserted when we got there -- and eventually  urlLink Pause , a cute little coffee shop just around the corner from my place.    Then we got to the sitting-in-his-car-in-front-of-my-place conversation, where our undeniable physical spark was dampened by his out-of-left-field declaration that he didn't see us ever dating, specifically citing our divergent attitudes toward recreational drug use (well, DUH), but he'd love to be friends.  Which is fine by me.  Our goodbye lasted a good half hour, too, which was also fine by me.  And now I have the memories of a pretty spectacular first date (all things considered) with none of the concerns about compromising my singlehood before the big Top 20 Singles launch party on June 25.  Mark your calendars!

       How's this for a coincidence?   Steve -- Mr. Oh My God from last weekend -- just emailed me.  We're having dinner tomorrow night!  So I'll be going from my photo shoot tomorrow afternoon where I have to dress "for the biggest date of my life" to actually going on the biggest date of my life.  And I have NO idea what to wear.  (I know:  Dinner with a guy I barely know -- no matter how hot -- hardly qualifies as the biggest date of my life.  But it sure adds a nice dramatic parallel to the above story, no?)

       Three things that aren't working so well:  The Drano    After an hour of chemical triage last night, my kitchen sink drain is still as slow as a Bush brain cell.  But at least it now has the fresh scent of bleach.   My attempts at self-manicuring    In an unexplainable fit of homosexuality, I bought a six-in-one nail buffer ("two surfaces for shaping and four surfaces for buffing!") yesterday.  I guess I wanted to have manicure-fresh hands for tomorrow's photo shoot without all the bleeding that a real manicure produces.  So this morning I started hacking away at my fingernails, and now that I'm sitting at work checking out my handiwork, I'm finding weird ridges and little cross-hatch scars all over my nails.  And now my buffing mishaps will be preserved for all eternity in the pages of Chicago magazine.  The horror!   The Home Depot's marketing department  One of the beautiful things about all that personal data that's out there for marketing departments to exploit and citizens to irrationally fear is that it prevents you from getting things you absolutely won't buy.  It's why I don't get coupons for feminine hygiene products in the mail and Antonin Scalia doesn't get invitations to circuit parties.  But someone has to let Home Depot in on the secret.  My nine-digit zip code alone tells every marker in the world that I live in a highrise in a very population-dense neighborhood of Chicago -- and by extension that there is a very poor likelihood that I have a garden and that there is near absolute certainty that I don't own or use a garden hose.  So what did Home Depot send me this weekend?  A coupon for a hose extender for watering my garden.

       The weekend with the folks was fun.   They got in Thursday, and since Mom  really  wanted to go to  urlLink DSW  (bless her heart), we headed right down after I got home from work for some shoe-buying fun, and then I took them to Nookie's, my favorite people-watching diner in Boystown.  Little did we know that Thursday was  urlLink Dining Out for Life  in Chicago, and to get in the spirit, Nookie's had transformed itself from an upscale diner to an upscale restaurant -- complete with upscale table linens and upscale prices.  We decided to stay, though, and we were rewarded for our loyalty with a Cher impersonator who struggled all night to stay on the fence between engaging the diners with her antics and staying respectfully behind her fourth wall.  And while female impersonators always make dinner with the parents fun, it's the awkward, nervous female impersonators who take the dinner experience to a whole new level.  Like a moron, I never got the bright idea to take Friday off while my parents were here, so I trudged off to work in the morning and they came in to join Bill and me for lunch at  urlLink P.F. Chang's , which brought us disappointment on many levels: mediocre food, silverware with dried bits of other people's mediocre food all over it, plastic chopsticks (what the hell is the point of plastic chopsticks?), and a room temperature hovering somewhere between arctic blast and ice age redux.  That night we headed back to Nookie's so the folks could have a proper Nookie's experience, and then we sat up and chatted at my place well into the night.  Saturday was a day of Chicago shopping fun.  After a leisurely morning reading the paper and listening to Mozart, we headed out to the  urlLink Brown Elephant  so I could drop off a massive garbage bag full of clothes that had been clogging my closets for too long.  Then we headed back to DSW and Marshall's, where I got two kick-ass pair of Steve Maddens for $30 each.  Then we trudged off to  urlLink Roy's Furniture  so I could look at dining-room tables.  (I'm 36 and I still have a card table in my dining room.  How sad is that?)  I didn't find anything I couldn't live without, so my dining room will maintain its dorm-level charm for the foreseeable future.  Poor Dad had had  more  than his fill of mom-and-gay-son shopping by then, so I took us to  urlLink Architectural Artifacts , where all three of us wandered slack-jawed among the fascinating inventory of fireplace mantles, tables, chandeliers, store signs, cabinets, tiles, statues, fountains and anything else of interest that could be pried from historic buildings around the world before they were destroyed.  We headed home so Mom and Dad could get ready for the big reason for their visit: Dad's college's 150th anniversary party at the venerable  urlLink University Club  downtown.  Meanwhile, I headed to Bill's house for his birthday party, where a bunch of his friends and I invented a tacky little party game for the politically-aware set: If you had to sleep with a U.S. Supreme Court Justice, which one would it be?  (I was the lone holdout for  urlLink David Souter , while the rest of the (completely gay) room was divided between  urlLink Stephen Breyer  and that boner-killer  urlLink Ruth Bader Ginsberg .  We had one vote for the hateful  urlLink Clarence Thomas , but thankfully, there was universal loathing -- both physically and intellectually -- for the vile and repellent  urlLink Antonin Scalia .)  This morning we met my cousin Eric for brunch at Melrose, then Mom and Dad headed back to Iowa and I headed home to nap and clean and read more of the paper.  Now I'm waiting for some Drano to work its magic on my kitchen sink and then I'm off to bed to rest up for a week that involves my Chicago Magazine Top 20 Singles photo shoot and another trip to NYC to make kissy-kissy with Citibank.

        urlLink Red Shirt   We had our fourth date on Monday night.  (I can't even remember the last time I had a fourth date.  Woo-hoo!)  He's still as charming and sexy and friendly as always ... but I get the feeling the spark is gone.  The entire evening was completely interchangeable with what you would expect at a plain-old dinner with a plain-old friend.  But ...  He IS traveling a ton for work.  And he scheduled our date on one of his only days home between trips.  And we've already scheduled a fifth date for the day he gets back from the trip he's on now ... IN TWO WEEKS.  (And then I promptly take off for a week in Montreal.)  So maybe he was just tired and that's why there was no passion.  Or no touching of any kind.  At least I hope that's the reason.   The Other Guy  Meanwhile, I've met another fella.  To keep this anonymous nickname theme going, I'll call him The Bod.  (I really want to call him Hot Fucker -- because those are the words that pop into my head every time I see him -- but that seems a little vulgar.)  The Bod and I met the old-fashioned way:  urlLink bigmuscle.com .  As you can imagine, he has a spectacular body.  And when he kisses me, he does things to me that just may alter my DNA.  We've had two dates that were spectacularly fun, and we have a third -- more respectable -- date scheduled for Friday night.  And I'm a little giddy with excitement over it.  And while I know intellectually that Red Shirt seriously likes me, he's not one to surprise me with a friendly phone call or keep an email correspondence going.  In sharp contrast, The Bod and I have been maintaining a 40-emails-a-day stream of steamy correspondence that keeps me thoroughly distracted at work since the day we met.  And while I'd place him slightly above me in the muscleboy hierarchy, he keeps telling me how "smokin' hot" I am.  And how much he can't wait to see me again.  And other stuff that's too scandalous to report here, where co-workers and various family members sometimes drop in for a visit.  And there is no way to cloud my judgment faster than to be stunningly beautiful and to shower me with that kind of attention.  So for the first time in my life, I'm juggling the amorous interests of two beautiful men -- both of whom seem to be amazing catches and both of whom are thoroughly intriguing and enjoyable and fun.  And I both love it and hate it.  Stay tuned for further developments.  ----------  In other news, I finally assembled a page of  urlLink pix  and added it to the links in my sidebar.  Yahoo is VERY picky about photo formats (jpEg but not jpg) and browsers (Netscape but not Safari), but I eventually got it working.  I hope.  The pix of me in the red shirt were taken Sunday morning before the pride parade.  Before my skin became as red as my damn shirt.

      We're proud because despite relentless persecution everywhere we turn -- when the "moral authority" of organized religion repeatedly condemns us, when our families disown us, when our elected officials bargain away our rights, when our employers fire us, when our police harass us, when the other kids mock and tease and even beat us -- we continue to survive.  We're proud because pride is the opposite of shame -- and despite what the Christian hate industry works so hard to make the world believe, there is nothing shameful about being gay.  We're proud because more and more, we are able to live our lives openly and joyfully without fear of losing our jobs, losing our housing, losing our families and losing our lives.  We're proud because we can overcome the self-loathing that society forces on us, and we can stop its destructive cycle by making intelligent choices involving sex and drugs and relationships.  We're proud because despite all we've been through, the world is starting to notice and respect us and emulate the often fabulous culture we've assembled from the common struggles and glorious diversity of our disparate lives.  We (and from this point on, I really mean "I" when I say "we") are proud because we have pumped the iron and pounded out the miles and pushed away the junk food with enough discipline that we were invited to dance shirtless on a float in this year's parade.  We're proud that we were able to dance, smile, wave and remember all the words to "If You Could Read My Mind" without stumbling or even remotely betraying the fear associated with doing all these things seven feet off the ground on a moving platform that stopped and started with alarming jerkiness for two hours.  We're proud that we were smart enough to realize we could see our reflections in some of the store windows we paraded by -- which helped us remember that we weren't 25 anymore and we should never forget to hold in our stomachs.  We're proud because when the fat angry lesbians squirted us with their Super Soakers as we paraded by, we knew the water would just make our cargo shorts stretch out and hang a little bit lower on our hips.  And we knew we hadn't eaten anything but a protein shake and a yogurt and a handful of strawberries all day, so our abs would look nice and ripped as they climbed higher and higher over our moist waistbands.  And we got a little thrill out of that.  We're proud that when the parade wound past those two pockets of bible-thumpers with their hateful signs and bullhorn-amplified vulgarities, we remembered everything we had to be proud of, and we didn't do or say anything to undermine the joy of the day or give them the satisfaction of getting a reaction out of us.  We're proud that when we saw that hot straight co-worker in the crowd after the parade and he was wearing something that showed off his sexy little bod, we were able to scope him out with some practiced discretion while still engaging him in lively conversation.  We're proud because when that hunky blond with the tattoo around his belly button who's been ignoring us for four years finally smiled at us and said hi today, we knew he was a game player who would take our phone number and get our hopes up and then never call, so we were mature and level-headed and just kept walking by.   We're proud that we remembered to wear SPF 45 for our day in the sun, even though we obviously missed a few spots and now our splotchy sunburns make our torsos look like a map of the Caribbean.  We're proud that we were able to have fun at two post-parade parties but then have the presence of mind to come home at a decent hour and write in our blogs and get some sleep instead of standing around in a bar trying pathetically to get laid.  Quite simply, we're proud that we have so much to be proud of.

      I just got back from the Chicago Magazine Top 20 Singles  urlLink kickoff party .  We Singles, you see, were the "celebrity" draw tonight at a charity fund-raiser/kickoff event for the issue that features us.  How on earth I can achieve any level of celebrity status simply by virtue of the fact that I can't get a date is beyond me, but I won't let rational thought get in the way of enjoying the opportunity for some fawning attention and free sodas on a beautiful summer night.  And I actually had a great time.  The day didn't start off so well, though.  I could NOT get my hair to look good.  And then I had a hella stressful day at work.  We continue to be severely understaffed for the workload we're expected to churn out.  For like the 10th month in a row.  I don't understand how our fearless leaders can mismanage our resources so completely (and so consistently), but let's just say once again I had to sneak out "early" -- 6:30 pm on a Friday -- and I owe my friend Jen a case of beer and a box of kitty treats for covering my ass so I could even go.  But I eventually made it -- only 15 minutes after we Top 20 Singles were expected to show up.  I took my officemate Liza as my date, and I wore my new $105 gay-clone shirt (you know: striped, collared, fitted, untucked, sleeves too long, etc. etc. etc.) that Bill convinced me to buy for the occasion.  So we get there, and the place is pretty packed.  It was held at the beautiful  urlLink Chicago Historical Society , and it was almost more fun to admire the architecture and the grounds than the people there.  (Speaking of the people there, the only big-ticket fund-raisers I've ever been to are populated by gay people.  Fussy, elitist, social-climbing gay people.  So I was a little shocked to be at a party where 1) strangers were extremely friendly to each other, 2) the guys don't look like cartoon characters, 3) I recognized the music they were playing and 4) people clearly don't know how to dress themselves.  I swear, I've never seen a bigger collection of women who really,  really  need gay best friends to help them build wardrobes of flattering clothes.)  Our obligations as the Top 20 Singles were pretty small:  Congregate behind the stage so we could be introduced to the crowd, and then line up on a magnificent circular staircase in the museum for our  urlLink Brady Bunch photo .  The being-on-stage part seemed pretty easy.  When the hosts for the evening started introducing the singles, they asked questions about their jobs and their interesting lives.  When they introduced me and read on their little cue cards that I'm a singer, they asked me to sing.  AS IF.  The conversation went something like this:   "Will you sing something for us?"  "I'd rather not."  (I'm not warmed up and I'd sound like shit.  Next question, please.)  "Why not?  C'mon -- sing for us!"  "No thanks."  (Really.  I'm not interested in sounding like shit in front of 500 strangers who may or may not be potential love interests.)  "Are you sure?  Why not sing a little something?"  "Um, no."  (Why is this such a hard concept for you to grasp?)    "OK ... that was Jake, everybody!  Our next single is ..."   So if my fag-centric  urlLink profile  in the magazine weren't embarrassing enough, I'm also now the boring old homo who won't sing like a trained monkey for the straight people.  No wonder I can't get a date, they must be thinking.  I ended up standing on stage next to  urlLink Jennifer Schefft  as they introduced the rest of the singles.  (We were introduced alphabetically, you see.  Which for once in my life put me at a standing-next-to-a-quasi-celebrity advantage.)  I'd never seen the dating show Jennifer was on, so I wouldn't have known her if someone hadn't told me who she was.  She's really rather short, and not too talkative.  At least not with me.  She sure was animated around the  urlLink other gay guy  in the Top 20 Singles, though.  And speaking of him, the boy either underdosed on his ADD meds or overdosed on his ecstasy tonight.  He was as wired and unfocused as a Madonna movie, and during the Brady Bunch photo, the photographer actually  had to yell at him  -- repeatedly -- to get him to stand still and smile for the camera.  Sheesh!  And speaking of running into contestants from nationally televised dating shows at the party, I'm pretty sure I saw "Bachelorette" reject and fellow social-anxiety-disorder-sufferer  urlLink Jamie Blyth  there.  He's a little shorter than I'd expected, but he's dreamy in a  urlLink Shaun Cassidy  kind of way.  And -- being true to our disorders -- Jamie and I never even acknowledged each other the whole evening.  Other highlights from the evening:  • Host  urlLink Larry Potash  is cute, but noticeably not as cute in person as he is on TV.  (I have the opposite problem; I'm cute-ish in real life and I look like  urlLink Ichabod Crane  on TV.)  • Straight guys actually talk to me like I'm one of them.  (After a lifetime of evidence that people rarely can tell that I'm gay when I meet them, I'm still always surprised that I continue to "pass" as straight.  My paranoia about this is clearly just in my head -- though it was not unfounded tonight; anyone who read my gay-ass profile in the magazine probably expected me to  bourrée  in  en pointe  and sprinkle fairy dust on everyone I met.)   • It's a small, small, small,  small  world.  Liza and I hadn't been at the event for 10 minutes when a woman RUSHED up to me all excited ... and it turns out she and I had done  The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas  together eight years ago in Iowa.  An hour later, we bumped into the son of some of my parents' best friends in Iowa.  Good Lord ... why are all these Iowans stalking me?  • In keeping with my unflattering and wholly unfair theme of gay/straight dichotomies in this post, I noticed that gay guys just have better bodies and better wardrobes than straight guys.  Straight guys are  far  more friendly and fun and easygoing to hang around with, but homos sure can jack up the eye candy factor when they populate a room.  I'll go to a bar or a gay event and find myself thinking lustful thoughts about a good 50% of the people I meet there.  Tonight, I think I saw three guys I wanted to see naked.  Anyway, the party's over.  I didn't get any numbers from anyone and only two strangers came up and talked to me all night (not that I expected to make a lot of love connections at an event marketed to a straight demographic).  And I'm climbing into bed to rest up for tomorrow's  urlLink Proud to Run  10K, which starts at 8:00 am -- ACK! So early! -- and kicks off all the Pride festivities in Chicago.  Night!

      I became a big brother.  And while my little sister and I fought like cats and dogs all the way through junior high, we've become best friends as adults.  She's an excellent teacher who keeps her kids wrapped around her little finger; a spectacular mommy who's raising the two most delightful, articulate children; and a beacon of inspiration for anyone who's ever tried to be a thoughtful friend, get the best deal on a car, manage a household, organize a party, or live with a frustrating food allergy (in her case, gluten ... which is in EVERYTHING).  Happy birthday, Jenny.  I love you!  * * * * *  In other news, there was a guy on my elevator this morning reading my queer-ass  urlLink Chicago magazine profile  without realizing he was standing right next to me.  Trippy.

      It's the mid-1990s.  You're a gay man living a rather lonely existence in Iowa.  You meet a guy.  He's intelligent.  Interesting.  Educated.  Cute enough.  You hit it off.  The sex is OK.  The conversation is entertaining.  His place is funky-cool.  He fills a void.  But after a couple of weeks you notice there's something a little off about him.  He lives in a constant state of drama.  He's moody.  The few friends he has make you uncomfortable.  One day you ask that he keep the toilet lid down so your cats don't splash in the water, as your cats so dearly love to do.  He tells you you're "controlling and manipulative."  A few days later, your dad ends up in the hospital in a dangerous hypoglycemic episode.  This guy finds it funny.  You've had enough.  You break it off.  It's been a little over a month.  It was nothing.  You move on.  Eventually you hear he's moved to California.  Good riddance to bad rodents, you think.  It's almost 10 years later.  You're living in Chicago.  You're enjoying life.   One day, you're staggering home from a 6-mile run when you hear your name.  You turn.  He's standing right in front of you.  He honestly doesn't look a day older than when you last saw him.  You struggle to remember his name for a second, but when it comes to you, so do all the weird memories associated with him.  You make small talk.  You're DYING to get home and chug a Gatorade.  You find out he's living a few blocks from you, working essentially as a houseboy for a rich older gay couple he hates.  This man has a fucking master's degree and he's working as a fucking houseboy, you think.  What a loser.  You're glad he's not in your life, you tell yourself.  You say your awkward goodbyes and turn to head home.  But before you can make your full escape, he whips out his cell phone.  "Give me your number and I'll give you a call sometime," he says.  You pause.  Your stomach fills with a foreboding sense of dread.  Or maybe it's just telling you it wants some fucking Gatorade NOW.  Do you give him your number and risk having him hound you to rekindle something that you wish had never happened?  Do you give him a fake number and hope you never run into him again?  Do you tell him you'd really rather not stay in touch and set off some kind of drama-filled scene?   What would you do?

      1. Running makes you uncomfortable and ugly.  Your nipples get chafed, your butthole gets kinda pokey-outey, and your skin gets as pink and flushed as an Easter ham.  That's how you know it's good for you.  2. When you run a lot, you go through clean underwear and clean socks faster than Rush Limbaugh goes through wives.  3. If you have even the  slightest  doubt that your jiggly bod doesn't look good running in those shorty-shorts or that scoopy-neck tank top, you're probably right.  4. "Runner's high" is something real.  Unfortunately, you have to slog 597 miles through Runner's Sweaty Buttcrack and Runner's Throbbing Lumbar Region to get there.  5. Pedestrians are morons.  If they can find a way to look one way and walk another as they wander directly into runners, bikers, bladers and/or drivers, they will.  Sometimes they get hurt.  This is called "thinning the herd."  6. Some people run funny. If you laugh at them you can fuck up your pace.  7. Well-fitting, low-mileage shoes are essential for an enjoyable running experience.  Almost as essential as underwear that doesn't creep up your ass.  8. Even if you only  kind of  feel like you have to poop before you run, make sure you do so.   9. Most energy bars make you gassy.  10. It's hard to fart quietly when you run.

      Another family reunion has come and gone, with rekindled family friendships and promises that we'll do a better job of staying in touch -- now that we have this newfangled email and all -- though we know we'll barely hear from each other and we definitely won't see each other again for another two years.  The reunion was on my mother's father's side on the family farm that his grandfather built from nothing in rural northeast Iowa before the Civil War.  Sturdy, stoic Norwegians all, my ancestors weren't in the habit of reproducing until late in life -- and apparently weren't very fertile until my generation -- because there just aren't many people over my age still alive to come to these reunions.  We had 23 people there, 10 of whom were ages 1 to 15 (and my niece and nephew were by FAR the cutest -- not that I'm biased). But we're an extremely friendly, low-drama clan, and we had a great time lounging and visiting and eating (and eating and eating) and admiring the rolling, bucolic Iowa scenery from the porch on the ancient farmhouse that was always so magical to me as a kid.  We also found some ... um ...  interesting  old photo albums.  See, my grandfather was one of five brothers and two sisters -- the last of the fertile Norwegians until the 1990s -- and the siblings spent a great deal of time entertaining themselves by putting on little plays.  Plays that involved a LOT of cross-dressing.  All of which was carefully documented by some amateur shutterbug.  And while the men of that generation made some butt-ugly women, they had some serious butt-ugly competition among the genuine women.  Talk about a genetic horror threatening the distant offspring across the decades.  Ouch.  One horsey great-great aunt in particular was RARELY photographed in anything but men's clothing, and she was often seen canoodling with uncomfortable-looking women we didn't recognize as family members.  We laughed about her brazenness, but my heart ached for her, all alone a century ago on a painfully rural Midwest farm with probably no one to love and no one even to talk to about her feelings.  We do know she eventually married -- in her 50s.  And we have often suspected that my grandfather -- and my mother's aunt on her mom's side -- had gay tendencies.  Which makes me think there's some kind of recessive genetic component to homosexuality (though I'm the only (out) homo in this generation and it's too early to tell about the next ... but there was one boy at the reunion I'd bet money will make some fella very happy one day).  Poor, lonely homos aside, we also have a family history of strong, enduring marriages, many of which were on display this weekend.  And seeing all those happy, stable couples with decades of history together made me VERY aware that I'm 36 and still single with no real prospects for changing that on the horizon.  I'm certainly not at the desperate-to-find-someone-ANYONE stage, but I'm more than ready to start my own strong, enduring marriage.  The abovementioned shutterbug showed us one more thing: Our family obviously has a genetic compulsion to take pictures of our cats.  And that little tidbit makes an excellent segue into the other newsworthy event of our weekend.  My brother-in-law, a borderline cat hater, actually went and picked out a cat as an anniversary/birthday present for my sister.  We all road-tripped to the Humane Society to pick up the cat on Friday, but the Humane Society had somehow screwed up the reservation and adopted our cat to someone else.  It was really no big deal -- except to my infinitely organized brother-in-law -- and we picked out another kitty.  Unfortunately, our runner-up kitty was broken (something about having a uterus) and there was a two-week waiting period to get her to the vet to be fixed before we could take her home.  So in the mean time, my sister is prepping her kids about the joys and responsibilities of cat ownership ... and struggling to hide her own glee about having a kitty in the house again.  I got back to Chicago Sunday afternoon in time to squeeze in a three-mile run before heading off to  urlLink chorus  rehearsal.  It was my first time among friends since the ugly-photo, faggot-stereotype  Chicago  magazine  urlLink Top 20 Singles profile  came out, and there was no end to the grief I got from people.  (And it wasn't good-natured grief.  It was more along the lines of why-does- Chicago -magazine-hate-you-so-much? grief.)  I cannot WAIT for this embarrassing chapter in my life to blow over.  I just hope it doesn't get in the way of starting that enduring marriage.

      As always, June is shaping up to be an expensive month for me. And this year, it's even more expensive than usual. To wit:  • My folks' 40th anniversary • My sister and her husband's 10th anniversary • My sister's birthday • Father's Day • Fix The Air Conditioner In Jake's Car Day  And speaking of my car and my family, I'm taking off momentarily for a road trip to Iowa for a family reunion.  Be good while I'm gone.

      It's started, and the Top 20 Singles issue hasn't even been out for a week -- hell, it's not even on newsstands yet.  Two guys have recognized me from the  Chicago  magazine profile so far (even though I'm well hidden behind that grotesque  urlLink photo ):  1)  urlLink This guy , who found me on Friendster, and  2) One of Red Shirt's friends, whom I met briefly on Sunday night at the Andersonville street fair.  I hadn't told Red Shirt about the Top 20 Singles thing (mostly because it would have some creepy -- and pretty arrogant -- "I just met you but I'm already projecting a lifetime of happiness on a few dates and I want you to know that you may be faced with a world of competition for my affections in the coming months" subtext), but he seemed to see the whole thing as kinda fun last night when he told me about his friend discovering me in the magazine.  I've gotten some other feedback from family and friends as well.  Here are a few (some paraphrased) quotes:   "Jake, this is HUGE!"  "That's a horrible picture of you."  "My friends told me the profile doesn't even sound like you."  "I wondered why you didn't tell me about this.  Now that I've seen the picture, I know why."  "It's about time they featured gay guys who aren't afraid to be openly gay."  "I hate the profile they wrote of you. It doesn't capture you at all. It captures the stereotypical gay male as viewed in the eyes of ignorant straight people. I find it offensive."  "That can't be the best picture they took of you."  "Did YOU pick that picture?  It's awful."  "Congratulations!  I hope you win!"   (This quote is from a friend of my parents who obviously doesn't get that it's not some sort of competition.)   And speaking of Red Shirt and last night ...   Date Three was just as fun as dates One and Two.  We saw  urlLink The Stepford Wives , which is neither good nor bad but simply a lot of fun.  We held hands during the movie, which is a MAJOR cool thing for me.  We discovered our shared obsession for bargain hunting and then regaled each other with stories of great deals we've gotten on everything from clothes to furniture.  He revealed his "dirty little secret" to me:  He's a Republican.  (I already knew that, though, through my spy, Anders.)  And while anyone who willfully associates with the Republican party is a little suspect in my book, I'm more horrified by toe-the-line partisan politics on either side of the aisle than by Red Shirt's measured, selective association with the so-called Grand Old Party.  Best of all, we capped off the night in each other's arms on his couch.  Mmmmmm.  On the down side, our schedules are NOT date-friendly over the next two months.  In fact, we've found two dates where we can get together between now and the end of July.  On the upside, we've locked in those dates for each other, which means there's still a mutual spark.  Next date:  June 28!

      Michelle and I are dressed alike today at work: red T-shirts with blue piping, dark faded jeans and flip flops.  Of course, I couldn't leave it at that so I hiked down my waistband to show her my black tighty-whities (tighty-blackies?).  She promptly showed me hers as well -- and they're also black.  (But the woman's wearing a THONG -- something I couldn't fathom enduring for even a minute.  ACK!)  Speaking of Red Shirt, we have our third date tonight.  It's supposed to rain.  I'm going to vote we find something to do together indoors ...

      My first full day of being a celebrity is winding down ... and let me tell you, it's been EXHAUSTING.  The press tours!  The autograph hounds!  The paparazzi!    Actually, the magazine hit Chicago-area mailboxes on Saturday -- so I've really been a celebrity for three full days.  I just didn't know it.  So I've decided to measure the demands of my celebrityhood from the moment someone thrust the magazine in my face at Monday morning's staff meeting to show me the grotesque photo and misleading profile that have my name on them.  Here's how it's shaken down so far:   WORK People I encountered:  I think we have about 200 employees  People who've made comments:  About all of them -- but that's only because of the office gossip network   THE GYM People I encountered:  Not too many -- maybe 20  People checking out my famous ass in the shower:  None   THE TRAIN HOME People I encountered:  I was able to get a seat, so maybe about 50  People who fought to sit by me and cop a feel:  None   SUPERCUTS People I encountered:  10  People demanding haircuts inspired by my famous mane:  None   THE LAKEFRONT TRAIL People I encountered:  Tons, but I was too busy focusing on getting in four miles before the sun went down to count  People hiding in the bushes and snapping photos of me to sell to the Sun-Times:  None   SIDETRACK People I encountered:  A whole bunch -- it was show tune night, you know  People staring hungrily at me as they sang "One (Singular Sensation)":  None   MY BEDROOM People I encountered:  Just me  Supermodels showing up at my door in nothing but towels, demanding that I kiss them:  None   THE 147 MORNING BUS People I encountered:  Standing room only  People craning their necks to see exactly what a glamorous celebrity listens to on his iPod:  None   CALIFORNIA PIZZA KITCHEN People I encountered:  The place was about half full  People walking by our booth and stealing surreptitious glances as they basked in my celebrity glow:  None   MY INBOX People able to reach me via the email address the magazine set up for me:  Infinite  People who've crafted seductive e-poems in celebration of my shining famousness:  None  As you can see, I've developed a true empathy for my fellow celebrities today.  Keeping up with the constant demands for my attention -- not to mention keeping myself photo-shoot pretty at all times -- can really take its toll.  I don't know how Julia Roberts and Gilbert Gottfried do it.  I'll be back tomorrow with more tales from the front.  In the mean time, duck if you see me.  The crowds can be vicious.

      The  urlLink  Chicago  magazine  Top 20 Singles issue is out -- quite a few weeks earlier than I'd expected.  And there I am.  Rubbing elbows right there in print with Jennifer "The Bachelor" Schefft and Hunter "The Bears" Hillenmeyer.  Near as I can tell, there are just two homos in the Top 20 mix -- and neither of us is shy about being totally out in a nationwide high-end glossy magazine.  The other gay guy -- whose last name starts with a W but who has an Emmy -- has a bigger picture on a more prominent page while I'm tucked away on the last spread with people whose last names start with Y and V.  Even though my S cognomen puts me waaaaaaay higher in the alphabet hierarchy.  Harumph.  And I don't want to complain too much -- especially since the Top 20 Singles editor promised that with this exposure "the heavens will rain down marriage proposals on me" -- but I have to say I'm not completely thrilled with my  urlLink photo .  It makes me look kind of smirky, like I just farted and I think I'm going to get away with it.  And nobody wants to date a farter.    (Friends who've seen it say it doesn't even look like me.  Which is good to hear, especially because the  urlLink low-res version  makes me look like  urlLink Grandpa Munster . For the record, I actually look like  urlLink this .)  And my  urlLink profile  -- duly flattering but factually shaky in many places -- spends an inordinate amount of time focusing on my brief foray into the world of drag.  (Jeez -- you wear a dress just once (OK, four times) and suddenly you're a big ol' drag queen.)  But enough kvetching.  I'm sincerely flattered that  Chicago  magazine found me interesting and attractive enough to take up space in its magazine.  Even though the photo they printed makes me look like a bar mitzvah clown.  And I'm thoroughly intrigued by where the whole thing might take me socially and romantically.  And you, dear readers, will get to hear all about it.  Assuming the cartoon photo and drag-centric profile don't undermine my ability to get any dates and generate any stories worth posting.  In the mean time, I'm not losing focus on whatever could develop with Red Shirt (next date: Wednesday!), and I'm already busy worrying what I'm going to wear to the Top 20 Singles kickoff party on June 25 at the Chicago Historical Society. The event is also a fund-raiser for the Bone Marrow Transplant Program at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. Tickets are $55 in advance and $65 at the door.  Get your tickets  urlLink here  if you want to join us.  And check your newsstands for the July issue.  (Promise not to laugh.)  I'm on page 86.  The same year I graduated from high school.  Cosmic.

      The  urlLink chorus  retreat is over, and it's good to be home.  But we had a great time.  The  urlLink Lake Lawn Resort  where we stayed is exactly as you'd picture a Wisconsin lake resort with a cemetery-like name:  It's decorated in a charming '60s knotty-pine aesthetic, the cabins and meeting rooms sport ambitious trailer park names like Geneva and Woodlawn, there are multiple gifte shoppes stocked with scented candles and charming kountry krafts, and the whole ambiance is enhanced with a pervasive essence of mildew.  But the chorus got a lot done (the retreat is really just an excuse to rehearse for an entire weekend with none of the obligations of home to distract us), and we turned a major corner in the process of mastering what is proving to be a supremely challenging program of music.  We had a couple hours of down time on Saturday, and I got in a four-mile run along the lake.  And let me tell you, running along a stagnant lake in the middle of the wilderness has its own challenges.  Like dragonflies.  And rotting fish whiff.  And goose poop.  But weaving among the mounds of fresh goose doots kept my mind occupied and made the miles just whiz by.  We also took over the lodge's karaoke bar both nights, transforming the evenings for the other guests from the endless horrors of suburban music to a snappy showcase of great songs and gay sensibilities.  I think we genuinely scared the other men who were staying there, but their wives loved us and we were GOLDEN everywhere they saw us.  I got home this afternoon, cleaned up and met Red Shirt at the Andersonville street fair.  We cruised among the tchkotchke tents, scoped guys, talked to friends, ate Mediterranean shish kebabs in our laps on benches by the porta-potties and eventually ended up entwined on my couch watching the  Six Feet Under  season premiere.  So I chalk up Date Two as another smashing success.  Date Three is scheduled for Wednesday.  And then our prospects dry up; his and my various travel commitments mean we won't be able to see each other until about June 28.  Which really necessitates one of these little jobbies:   :-(   But the fact that we're so casually talking about scheduling time together over the next month tells me that we both like each other.   We really LIKE each other.   Which to me means I also get to use one of these things in my blog:   :-)

       How amusing.  How delightfully droll.   I take off this afternoon for a weekend  urlLink chorus  retreat in bucolic Lake Geneva, Wisconsin.  On the agenda:  endless rehearsals in rooms designed NOT to carry sound  bonding rituals  mediocre food  a couple miles' running if the weather is nice  the always-fun No Talent Show, for which I didn't prepare anything this year  The place where we're staying is a huge campus of cabins and meeting rooms rendered habitable year-round by a series of glassed-in, above-ground tunnels -- not unlike a giant  urlLink Habitrail .  And when I get back on Sunday, I have a second date with Red Shirt -- albeit a second date at a crowded street fair  with a group of his friends -- some of whom are my friends as well .  I can't decide if it will be awkward or fun.  I'll let you know either way.

      1. It's cool and rainy here, with NO cruel, oppressive humidity.  2. I'm wearing my sexy new  urlLink jeans .  3. Scrubbing Bubbles (lemon scent) -- it turned my grungy, scaly shower curtain into a shiny thing of beauty -- without scrubbing!  4.  urlLink Agnes .  5. I was telling a friend about Red Shirt, and my friend not only knows who he is but he's jealous as hell that we've had a date.  6. Hot guys in jeans and flip-flops.  WOOF!  7. I got a semi-promotion last night (when I was here until 10 pm) -- I'll be "acting ACD" in charge of a whole account.  It doesn't involve any more pay, but it's a significant step forward in my meandering journey to ACDhood.  8. Peanut butter and jelly.  (Of course, I've been digging PB&J for lunch almost every day for the past 30 years.)  9. The way  urlLink this guy  writes.  It helps that he has some pretty fascinating stories to tell.  10. Spring produce. Right now my kitchen is filled with the aromas of fresh nectarines and juicy strawberries and ripe pears.  Mmmmmm.

      1. It is MUGGY in our office, and the humidity is zapping my will to live.  2. Our workload has again grown way beyond our staffing levels, and I had to cancel my noon workout and my dinner/movie plans with Bob tonight so I could sit at my desk and type.  3. Microsoft Word keeps formatting and unformatting parts of my copy decks with random abandon.  4. Red Shirt hasn't called today, and I'm not sure if I should call him.  Infatuation can be SO vexing.  5. I got a shot in my ass this morning at the doctor's, and it's actually affecting the way I sit.  6. A disarmingly cute (and probably straight) co-worker keeps getting all buddy-buddy with me.  But I kinda like it.  In a frustrating kind of way.  7. "In the White House, Reagan proved a maddeningly contradictory figure. An eloquent advocate of traditional values, he divorced his first wife and was often estranged from his children. A fierce advocate of balanced budgets, he never proposed one. ... An icon of button-down morality, he led an administration beleaguered by scandals. ... He mangled facts ... presided over a dark recession in 1982-83, seemed uncaring about the emerging HIV/AIDS crisis, and, in the Iran-contra scandal, came perilously close to—and may have committed—impeachable offenses." —Newsweek, June 14, 2004  8. It's June 9, 2004, but for some reason I'm holding a Newsweek dated June 14 that's covering a death that happened June 5.  9. Did I mention Red Shirt hasn't called?  10. I'm dangerously close to crashing if I don't soon find some 1) air conditioning that works and 2) sugary treats.

      I'm back.  And I'm a little too fizzy and funny and fine to go to sleep just yet. Red Shirt is a CATCH, and we just had the most enjoyable evening together.  Now, I'm fully aware that first-week impressions are more puppy love than reality.  Really, I am.  But our date was so effortless, and we continually found ourselves on the same wavelength on every topic from monogamy to reincarnation to when we're going to have our next date.  It's true!  We started planning our next date halfway through our first official date.  (And, for the record, he brought it up first. I was undeniably thinking about it, but  he brought it up first .) Unfortunately, we're both scheduled to the gills -- mostly with travel -- over the next month, and the next two times we'll be able to see each other are this Sunday night and the following Wednesday night.  That's five days until I get another look at his sexy legs and his sparkly eyes and his handsome smile.  Sigh.  And pardon my gushing, but he scores BIG on the Boyfriend Aptitude Test.  To wit:  Well-read and articulate.  check  Culturally, socially and politically aware.  check  Armed with amusing stories involving Betty White and Elaine Stritch.  check  Looks forward to his date with  The New York Times  every Sunday morning.  check  Accustomed to offering well-reasoned opinions on a range of topics.  check  Capable of bursting into show tunes at the drop of a hat.  check  Knows all the lyrics when he does.  check  Gainfully employed in an interesting, cerebral career.  check  Has a CD player stocked with things other than techno-drivel.  check  Is my exact same size in shirts, pants AND shoes.*  check  Looks amazing from every angle.  check  Uses  draconian  correctly in casual conversation.  check  Has a large framed photo of Bea Arthur hanging over his toilet.  check  Says "expresso."  Um ... I'll choose to see that one as cute.   Anyway, I achieved my goals tonight: a great dinner together, smooching on the couch, lots of physical contact and plans for more of the same -- all without compromising our virtue.  At least not this time.  Now, if you'll excuse me,  I have some happy dreams waiting for me on the other side of the covers.  (And please don't barf over that last saccharine-infused sentence. My apologies to the linguistically diabetic.)  Good night!   * Because everyone knows that the whole purpose of choosing the filthy homosexual lifestyle is to find someone your own size and double your wardrobe.

      After the requisite 24-hour cooling-off period, I called The Guy in the Red Shirt yesterday afternoon.  Not home.  Left a message about having dinner some night this week.  Then silence.  All day.  I got home that night, fueled up with fresh fruit and a tasty  urlLink Clif Bar , and headed out to pound out six miles on the hottest, most humid training day of the summer so far.  And I hit my first wall of the season in mile four and actually had to stop and walk for a few minutes.  The shame!  The humanity!  (The humidity!)  But I got in a good half-mile sprint at the end and headed home with a feeling of accomplishment.  I was still in that weird sweating-profusely-but-covered-with-goosebumps recovery period when the phone rang.  And there on the Caller ID were the words that didn't do anything to help bring my heart rate down: The Guy in the Red Shirt.   Our conversation immediately took on the tone of a well-established friendship.  We talked about working out.  We talked about our jobs.  We talked about his condo association's tree-planting project.  We talked about what we're reading.  We talked about the death of Not My President Reagan.  Red Shirt had thoughtful, well-articulated opinions on what his shameful  urlLink legacy  will comprise.  On social revenge fantasies against Not My President Bush.  On the moral hypocrisy driving the opponents of gay marriage.    We made a date for tonight.  TONIGHT.  The promise of dinner.  More conversation.  If I'm lucky, more physical contact.  Hand-holding.  Making out.  Snuggling on his couch.  It's all good.  It's also making the day seem painfully slow.  In the mean time we can all amuse ourselves with some  urlLink chalupa news  from my home state.

      I spent yesterday combing Chicago's furniture stores for some kind of cabinet/shelf thingie to help me organize the unsightly pile of sheet music next to my piano.  I didn't find anything I liked, but I did bump into Bill and his angelic blond friend Kevin, who was visiting from Atlanta.  They invited me to join them for dinner that night, and I happily accepted.  We walked to the restaurant from Bill's house, and as we passed  urlLink Ping Pong , I saw an extremely handsome man in a red T-shirt standing in the doorway.  I smiled, but he didn't look up.  So we have a great dinner, we stop by Bill's house afterward for drinks (and so we won't be embarrassingly early at Sidetrack) and then mosey on over to Sidetrack.  The guy in the red T-shirt is there.  We walk by him three or four times.  Again, he never looks up.  We run into people.  We chat.  We tour the totally cool new rooftop bar that just opened a couple weeks ago.  It's a beautiful night.  We make loops around the downstairs bars.  We notice that the bigger bar is now officially designated as a no-smoking area.  We smile in appreciation.  I'm talking to Phil and Phillip at one point.  I notice the guy in the red T-shirt is about 10 yards away.  I head his direction to make another loop through the bar.  He finally looks up.  He smiles.  He says something funny about my T-shirt.  We start talking.  I like him immediately.  He's intelligent, articulate, interesting.  He's disarmingly handsome.  He doesn't come off as gay or straight; he just comes off as a guy.  He keeps asking me questions about me.  He's definitely interested.  But he's not doing any flirting.  He finally says he needs to head home.  My heart sinks a little.  He hesitates.  I ask if he wants to go get something to eat.  His face brightens considerably.  He was just waiting for me to initiate the flirting.  I put my hand on the small of his back.  He presses into it.  We chat some more.  We finally leave.  We decide we're not hungry.  What do you suppose our other options are?  Hmmm.  He's a great kisser.  He's fun to touch.  He's a wonderful snuggler.  He wants to see me again.  He definitely will.  Any time he wants.

      I met Jim and Keith and Jason and Jeremy last night for  urlLink Dance Divas , a drag show featuring dancers from all the professional companies around Chicago.  The show was great, the music and choreography were a lot of fun, the Fairmont Hotel ballroom was pretty spectacular ... but we had serious issues with some of the costumes the girls wore.  Drag queens do not -- I repeat, DO NOT -- go out on stage  or even in public  in  urlLink Butterick  dresses.   There was a VIP cocktail reception beforehand with huge muscleboys working the crowd to sell raffle tickets.  I bought tickets from one of the guys -- and he slipped me his phone number in return.  WOOF.  So I'd like to think I won the raffle before they even had the drawing.  In other news, why can't I find the  urlLink Tony Awards  on the TiVo menu?  I've looked under Tonys, The Tonys, Awards, American Theatre Wing and even Broadway, but the show's not listed.  And I won't be anywhere near a TV this Sunday when they're on.  ACK!

       All the other bloggers are doing it. I'm just following the herd.   1. I was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. 2. Aside from college (University of Iowa, 30 miles away) and four summer jobs during college, I lived there until I moved to Chicago at the age of 32.  3. My parents are still married (to each other) and I have a younger sister who’s married with two amazing kids. 4. I’ve had one long-term relationship (3 1/2 years) and one short-term relationship (9 months). Both ended extremely amicably. 5. I love pets, but I’m more a cat person than a dog person. 6. Mostly because cats are self-pooping and self-cleaning. 7. I’ve had three cats: Patches (who lived to be 19), Ester and Emma. 8. I am currently catless. 9. I first started noticing other boys early on in grade school. 10. I thought those weird feelings I had inside were just jealousy from thinking the other boys were cuter than I was.   11. When I finally hit puberty, I realized what those feelings REALLY were. 12. I’ve never slept with a woman, and I don’t think I even could. 13. Not that I’d ever want to. 14. I’ve always been attracted to guys my own age. 15. I came out to my family July 5, 1984. I had just finished my sophomore year of high school. 16. Things were NOT good in our little Republican household for quite a while after that. 17. But my family is pretty awesome and quickly unlearned all the stupid prejudices they had been taught by the Christian hate industry.   18. I’m mostly Norwegian with a bit of German and Swedish and probably some other Northern European muttness thrown in. 19. My family celebrates only the Norwegian part of our heritage. 20. I grew up Lutheran, but I knew early on that my true religion was None of the Above. 21. I absolutely do not understand why people think they need mythology—especially a divisive, solipsistic, life-destroying mythology—to live happy, moral, altruistic lives. 22. I find so many inherent flaws in the idea of religion that I have a hard time respecting people who embrace it with unbridled enthusiasm or who talk about it like it’s something real. 23. I feel the same way about astrology. 24. My family is still religious, but we don’t talk about it. It’s practically the only disagreement—spoken or unspoken—we have. 25. I don’t consider myself an atheist, because atheism is too obsessed with the existence of a god. I simply don’t believe and I totally don’t care. 26. In 1988, I lost five friends in two plane crashes and my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. 27. One of those friends was murdered by the December 21 terrorist bomb that blew Pan Am flight 103 out of the sky over Lockerbie, Scotland. 28. I’d never really had an opinion on the death penalty until then. Now I’m a huge fan. 29. I studied the piano from second grade until I was in college. 30. I’ve taken tons of dance classes, and I’m a damn good tapper. 31. I’ve studied voice off and on since high school. 32. My voice is trained more for show tunes and opera than for pop music. 33. Actually, I suck as a pop singer. 34. I’m a HUGE and unrepentant show-tune queen. 35. I sang and danced and played the piano in theme park shows all four summers I was in college. 36. I still kinda wish I’d pursued a career on the stage. 37. But then I look at my actor friends who are still living job-to-job in their 30s and 40s and I’m glad I found a more stable career. 38. I have a degree in literature of the Northern European Renaissance and most of a minor in Spanish. 39. I got a job as an advertising copywriter when I got out of college just to pay the bills until I could figure out what I wanted to be when I grew up. 40. I’m still here. And I neither love nor hate it. 41. But I must be good at it because my stuff keeps winning awards. And I've survived 10 rounds of layoffs in my career. 42. I was a skinny, 160-lb scarecrow all through high school and college. 43. Tired of being ignored by the guys I liked, I joined a gym soon after I graduated, and I’ve been lifting weights 5 days a week since then. 44. I peaked at 200 lbs when I lived in Iowa and had a highly motivated lifting partner and nothing better to do than work out. 45. Now that I live in Chicago and have a ton of stuff to distract me, I’m holding my weight at 190 lbs. 46. I’ll never be as muscular as I want to be—and I don't think I'm very hot—but guys DO hit on me a lot. Hot guys. Usually when they're rip-roarin' drunk. 47. People compliment me the most on my arms, legs, cheekbones and (curiously) my nose. Which is pretty honkin’ big. 48. Women always tell me I have beautiful skin, and guys always tell me they're jealous of my thick head of hair.  49. Since I turned 30, I’ve developed stubborn little love handles that in my mind are HUGE. 50. I haven’t ruled out lipo. 51. But I’d never get any other kind of plastic surgery. Not even on my nose. 52. My skin burns easily, so I use self-tanner and cover myself with SPF 45 when I go out in the sun. 53. I started running kinda seriously in 1994 and entered a few small races (5K or 8K) each year. 54. I started running more seriously when I moved to Chicago and now I do bigger races (10K, half marathon, maybe a full marathon). 55. I run for the same reason I work out: So guys will notice me. 56. The health benefits are nice too. 57. I rarely get sick, and when I do it’s never very bad. 58. I’ve probably taken 5 sick days my entire adult life—and they were either for migraines or what we’ll euphemistically call digestion troubles. 59. I haven’t thrown up since I got food poisoning on my 23rd birthday. 60. I was born with my tongue connected to the bottom of my mouth and behind my bottom teeth, and I had to have surgery at birth and again in junior high school to correct it. 61. Just talking about it still makes the end of my tongue tingle. In a bad way. 62. I broke my arm roughhousing with my cousin when I was in about 5th grade, but I’ve never had a broken bone since. 63. I had my tonsils out when I was in about 1st grade, my wisdom teeth out when I was in high school and LASIK surgery in January 2004. 64. Other than that I’ve never been operated on or hospitalized. 65. All my life I’ve gotten sweaty, panicky and physically ill in crowded social settings like bars or parties.  66. After seeing a therapist a couple of times in 2003 and getting diagnosed with a social anxiety disorder, I’ve pretty much talked myself into making it go away. 67. I still have tiny panic attacks once in a while, but I consider myself cured. 68. And I did it without prescription drugs. 69. I don’t drink or smoke or take party drugs, and I never have. 70. People who find out I don’t drink either see it as profoundly admirable or they get these immediate paranoid delusions that I’m passing judgment over every sip they take and they stay away from me. 71. I honestly don’t care whether other people drink or not. It’s just not something I want to do. And I never tell people they shouldn't drink. 72. But I will never understand why people need to get wasted or be in a drug-induced fog to have a good time. Life is already amazing without the help of chemicals. 73. Once in a while I’ll have a sip of alcohol, just to see what it tastes like. 74. I have a tattoo of Mickey Mouse on my left ankle. 75. I want to get another tattoo—either around my left arm or somewhere near my naughty bits. 76. I got my nipples pierced kind of on a dare on May 1, 1999. 77. One of the piercings  urlLink fell out  on January 20, 2004. When I couldn’t get it back in, I decided it was time to take them both out and return my nipples to their natural state. 78. I’ve been skydiving seven times. 79. I’d do it again, but now that I’m an uncle, dangerous things like skydiving have lost their appeal. 80. In fact, becoming an uncle is the most profoundly life-changing thing that’s ever happened to me. 81. It’s also made me more emotional. I’ve suddenly started tearing up over the most benign things. Like sentimental commercials. Or the National Anthem. 82. I’ve always been a sucker for patriotic stuff, though. 83. One of my biggest pet peeves is people who don't look where they're going. I've been known to get in their way so they bump into me and then say things to them to make them feel bad for being so stupid.  I look at this as a public service. 84. I also hate partisan politics. My opinions do NOT fall neatly within approved Democratic or Republican platforms, and I find it hard to believe anybody else's do, either. 85. My favorite color is blue. 86. Aside from my mortgage, I have no debt. 87. I won’t buy something until I have the cash to pay for it. 88. I clip coupons for groceries and I organize them in the order of the aisles at the grocery store. 89. I rarely buy things (from salad dressing to clothes to furniture) that aren’t on sale. 90. I don’t mind stopping back and “visiting” things until they go on sale, either. It’s like a game to me. 91. But I don’t have any problem splurging on things like a Mediterranean cruise or a big-screen TV. 92. I would have a hard time dating someone with lots of credit card debt. 93. I would also have a hard time dating someone addicted to religion—and I absolutely would not date someone addicted to drugs or alcohol. 94. Other than that, I consider myself to be extremely open-minded, non-judgmental and easy to get along with. 95. I admit to having snobby attitudes about pop music (seven words and two chords do NOT equal a song, Britney), iceberg lettuce (no explanation needed) and spelling (I cringe when guys send me emails that say things like “your hot”).  96. I also don’t consider myself to be a picky eater, but other people probably think I am. 97. I don’t like seafood, nuts, coconut, coffee, pickles, canned peas, melon or dark chocolate. 98. But I like tuna salad with pickle relish in it. 99. I have a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich for lunch almost every day. 100. Creamy peanut butter. Wheat bread. No cheap jelly.

      Here's a random IML photo of  urlLink Robbie and me  at the Hyatt on Saturday afternoon.  A complete stranger took our picture, and through the magic of the Internet it landed in my inbox this morning.  And I both underestimated and overestimated Chris, my three-hour dance-floor romance from Sound-Bar on Sunday night.  He actually called yesterday.  He apologized for not calling sooner.  We decided to get together last night for a shopping date at Target, which was his cute idea.  I picked him up at his place.  And DAMN, he looks even better in the light.  Tan, blond, rugged, built -- and he was wearing baggy pants and flip-flops, which ALWAYS gets me going.  But my first impressions about us having no future together were pretty much spot-on.  Let's just chalk it up to artistic differences and leave it at that.

      By a freakin' REPUBLICAN.  First of all, I have to say I appreciate his straightforwardness and honesty.  My biggest bitch about the men in this town is the way they say they'll call when they have no intention of calling and the way they say they just want to be friends when they're too weak to actually say they'd really rather keep the "friendship" on an only-if-we-bump-into-each-other level.  And second of all, it's not like we had this epic romance going.  We had four really nice dates, which progressed steadily from sexually explosive to sweetly romantic to funeral luncheon.  We had a fifth date lined up before I took off for Montréal, but he kept postponing it.  And I never got the hint.  (But then again, why would I?  He was already talking about getting his dog used to me so she wouldn't get all excited and pee every time I came over.  I defy anyone to find anything but an I'm-definitely-interested-in-you subetxt in THAT.)  That said, it's never really fun hearing "I'm not really ready for dating" followed by "I'd like to just focus on my tight little circle of friends for now."  Especially over the phone.  Especially when you're already friends with a lot of the guys in that tight little circle.  But we were adults about it.  I told him I was disappointed but that I understood.  I almost told him to call me when he was ready to maybe get a friendship going, but I'm glad I didn't.  Because he was sending clear signals that that would probably never happen.  And my well-honed self-preservation mechanism had already kicked in.  So I guess that's the end of  urlLink Red Shirt .  Also known as Dan.  And I guess I'm free to keep looking ... with a totally clean slate.  Sigh.

      I forgot to post something about my Montréal trip.  Something not very nice.  Sunday night there was this dance, see, and it was at some brand-new über-trendy club high in some corporate skyscraper far from all the other GALA events.  The club was so trendy-exclusive, in fact, that the invitation didn't even include a freakin' address.  But that's a rant for a different posting.  Anyway, after a good hour of riding the subway and traipsing around a foreign neighborhood in the dark and IN THE RAIN and asking a long string of clueless locals for help, we finally found the club.  And the line was at least a block long.  And not moving.  I quickly lost interest, bid my fellow club hopefuls adieu and headed for Rue Saint-Catherine to find a cab home.  On the way, I passed one of Montréal's billions of homeless people begging on the sidewalk.  True to my indifferent Chicago roots, I kept my blinders on and kept walking.  A few steps later -- in what should be a different story altogether -- I felt what I thought was a tiny little fart knocking at my back door.  Without disrupting my stride, I opened the valve just a bit to let it out.  And instead of the tiny little peep I expected to come forth, out came a LOUD wake-the-dead kind of fart, trumpeted with all the subtlety of Rush Limbaugh's personality on Don't Wipe Your Ass Day.   So not only did I callously ignore the poor homeless man slumped on the sidewalk in the rain, but I FARTED ON HIM AS I WALKED BY.  I am SO going to hell.

       * Greetings from Montréal! I hope you like this message I'm sending for you!**  ** I was going to post something with this headline while I was actually  in  Montréal, but I had a bitch of a time finding 1) an Internet cafe and 2) the time to sit and write.  So I'm posting it now, after I'm safe at home and able to poop in my own toilet once again.   So I'm back -- and I'm both exhausted and exhilarated.  Everyone who's been to a GALA festival raves about how profoundly cool the experience is, but I was skeptical.  I mean, come on -- it's a bunch of gay choruses singing back to back, hour after hour, day after day for seven freaking days.  In two separate theaters.  And gay men's choruses don't particularly attract the hunky, lusty, eye-candy-y demographic you find at other gay events.  I'd half expected this week to be so dull that I'd sneak home a few days early and enjoy some unaccounted-for time in Chicago where nobody in the whole world could find me.    Fortunately, I was wrong in almost all of my assumptions and expectations.   The festival  We sang first, kicking off this week-long love fest.  And I mean LOVE fest.  We got the kind of cheering, screaming, throw-your-panties-on-the-stage reaction from the GALA audience that you'd normally expect only for people like Madonna or (grrr) Ricky Martin. (Can you feel the love? Can you FEEL the fucking love?)  And it just fueled us to be even better.  We ROCKED, actually.  And we left the stage buzzing on a high that didn't go down for days.  I also hadn't counted on being so moved and so inspired by the other choruses I saw.  I heard gorgeous music, reflected on thoughtful programming, got swallowed up in tears and goosebumps and cheers, and actually found myself contemplating moving to a new city so I could sing with two of the choruses -- both of which were from  urlLink LA  ... and one of which was a  urlLink women's ensemble .  Which would involve a  few  logistical challenges.  Official Decree from the Kingdom of Jake: Songs about singing -- especially in the first person ("We're gay men and we're singing this song because we're out and we're proud and did we mention we're GAY?") -- are stupid and dull and tedious.  So are Meaningful Commissioned Works About Gay Love And HIV.  They've been  done , and there's nothing left to explore on that planet.  Even worse is original, amateur material -- which inevitably gives us unendurable crap like "Gaydar!" and "Flowers Have Agendas."*  *Actual song titles from a mini-musical about gay people turning blue.  As in  physically  turning blue.  I tried to rip my veins out with my teeth so I could bleed to death instead of having to sit through it in Montréal.  But no such luck.   The men  Men in Montréal are hot, but not Stepford-fascist hot like they are in America. They tend to have great bodies with a little bit of extra flesh around their middles.  Which is refreshingly sexy.  And you'd be surprised how operating in that aesthetic can boost your self-esteem.  And let me tell you, there was not enough of my relatively-hot-with-a-little-flesh-around-my-middle self to go around in Montréal.  I got more attention this week -- even as my muscles atrophied and my gut expanded from the lack of available exercise equipment and healthful, low-fat food -- than I get in a month in Chicago.  Bring it ON!  I even landed myself a hunky 36-hour boyfriend from the LA chorus this week.  We met at the party the LA boys threw after their Monday concert and we never left each other's sight (or arms) until he headed home Wednesday morning.  (And I already have tentative plans to see him in October if I actually do fly out there to attend a  urlLink concert  in the new Walt Disney Concert Hall.)  I actually met TWO guys this week from the LA chorus whom I found thoroughly fun and intriguing (and hot), and I hope to -- at the very least -- develop lasting friendships with both of them.  Speaking of men, do you know that stereope that says gay men tend to be beautiful and cultured and rich and hunky and good dancers?  It's just not true.  We largely blew that one out of the water this week.  And do you know that stereotype that says lesbians tend to be obese and unattractive with unflattering hairstyles and wardrobes right out of the Shoney's Employee Manual?  That one's pretty true.  With the notable exceptions found in  urlLink this chorus .  OK.  Enough with my bitchy little insults.    Montréal   The city obviously had a  huge  building boom in the 1970s (no doubt fueled by the 1976 Olympics).  Unfortunately, it also seems to have encouraged its architects at the time to be unnaturally avant-garde in their work -- and as a result, the overriding effect is a boxy, beige-y, thoroughly dated aesthetic that calls to mind early personal computers and first-generation "brick" cell phones.  And it's EVERYWHERE -- which is especially jarring next to all the beautiful Victorian buildings that seem to represent the only other architectural style in the city.  And speaking of dated cultural artifacts, we swear Montréal JUST discovered the '80s -- from music to clothes to hair.  The whole city made me feel downright progressive in my sensible Gap and Old Navy wardrobe.  While Duval Airport is clean and airy and altogether beautiful, the rest of the city is dulled by a layer of grunge and neglect.  Sidewalk cracks are choked with weeds, buildings are unpainted, landscaping ranges from anemic to overgrown ... and even the Olympic Village sits in an obvious state of disrepair.  It's kind of depressing.  (I will concede that the Place des Arts shopping and theater complex where the GALA took place was always clean and nice -- though it had all the aesthetic charm of a suburban Holiday Inn.  Even when you factor in its bizarre fountain/wading pool with  urlLink orange chickens and bulls  standing around in disturbingly yellow water.)  Montréal does know how to have fun, though.  The bars were always hopping, and there were tons of street fairs going on the whole week we were there.  My favorite was  urlLink Juste Pour Rire , the "just for laughs" festival in the Latin Quarter a block from our hotel.  It even had a Euro-funky little green monster mascot that was plastered on everything from backpacks to beer bottles to window decorations to  urlLink lamp posts .   The food  It's not very different from American cuisine.  In fact, America's two biggest culinary exports to Canada seem to be Burger King and Subway.  I'm so proud.  And if I could change one thing about the food in Montréal, it would be to introduce the concept of skim milk.  The lowest fat content I could find for milk was 2%, which is like Elmer's Glue to my delicate, skim-milk-only palette.  ACK!   Speaking French  I was surprised how functional I was in Montréal with only a single adult French class under my belt.  It helped that the country is completely bilingual -- I'd just read something in English and then read it again in French when I already knew what it said.  You'd be amazed how effective that can be for absorbing a language.  And speaking French is fun!  My new favorite word to say:  crêperie   I also got a little thrill each time a clerk or waiter approached me and chose to speak French instead of English.  As though I passed for a native or something.  Question: If you live on Rue Saint-Denis, are you a Saint-Denista?   Non-festival adventures  I roomed with three friends whose obsessive planning and alpha-male personalities helped make this week even more spectacular than I could have hoped.  Jeremy and Shawn coordinated side trips like whitewater rafting on the St. Lawrence River (which was more work than I'd expected but a blast nonetheless) and a road trip to Québec City (which is  urlLink GORGEOUS  -- almost as nice as the Canada you see at Epcot Center), and Arnie (bless his hyper-social heart) got us invited to tons of parties and helped us meet tons of people from all over the world.  And I was perfectly content to just follow whatever they suggested and throw money at them to help pay for it.  Other non-festival adventures included a set of boyfriends and a set of roommates.  But I won't even mention them here, because you'll think I'm a whore.  So I'm home.  It's late.  I'm halfway unpacked.  I'm fading in and out as I type this.  And I'm a better man for it all.

      I have two anniversaries to report:  • Today is the four-year anniversary of my move to Chicago.  Woo-hoo!  I'd planned to write a huge, dramatic, expertly crafted post about the whole story, but WORK and VACATION got in the way.  What's a boy to do?  • Monday is the one-year anniversary of this very blog.  Woo-hoo again -- though there's really no exciting story to post beyond what you can read here.  So get clicking.  It's after 11 pm and I have to leave the house at 5:30 tomorrow morning.  And guess who's still not completely packed...

      I spent it putting out fires at work (and breathing a that's-not-my-problem sigh of relief every time another fire flared up) and then riding home on a bus filled with fat, loud, obnoxious children who would all make great "before" models in an ad campaign promoting post-natal abortion.  Now I'm home with four objectives before I crawl into bed:  1) Run one last time. 2) Do a mountain of stinky-runner and painty-bathroom laundry. 3) Figure out what the hell I'm going to pack.  And then squeeze it all into my handsome luggage set. 4) Get a key to Dan so he can water my plants, bring in my mail and beat off to my porn.  Then, at an ungodly early hour tomorrow, I climb onto a plane and wing my way off to a week-long vacation in Montreal.  The vacation is centered around the  urlLink VIIe Festival International GALA Choruses , which is a very weird name for a week-long concert of gay men's choruses.  urlLink My chorus  is the first to perform -- we're on Sunday, and we kick off a whole week of singing and exploring Montreal and getting to know gay singers from all over the world  just a little bit better .  And I've already packed a pile of work to bone up on during the flight home.  I'm just lucky that way.  Anyway, I assume I'll find an Internet cafe somewhere in Montreal and make a few posts about my adventures this week.  Be good while I'm gone.  And if you're not good, write to tell me all about it.

      So I subscribe to this email list thing that a friend runs.  Each Monday he proposes a topic to a bunch of his friends.  We all submit our funniest ideas for that topic by Wednesday.  We vote on the submissions on Thursday.  And on Friday (or in this case, late Thursday night) we see who wins.  Like clockwork.  The topics range from the naughty to the political.  (And I can't think of a single example of either to share with you at the moment.  Sorry.)  I don't know this guy's friends, but the vast majority of the submissions (and, not surprisingly, the weekly winners) are usually pretty lame.   Painfully  lame.  My clever, thoughtfully phrased submissions never make it to the top 10, but the stupidest, most predictable ones often win.  There's no justice.  But this week, the tables are turned.  I submitted the dumbest entries I could think of.  And I got three of the top nine!  No wonder Bush is in office.  So here, for your reading pleasure, is this week's topic with the winning entries.  I have modestly included a tiny symbol next to my submissions so you can see which ones I wrote.   * Lesbian Pick-Up Lines We Never Want To Hear *    1st:  Has anyone ever told you how much you look like Ernest Borgnine?  2nd:  Can I borrow your lipstick?  3rd:  C'mon ladies -- three holes, no waiting!  4th:  Lesbe friends.  I'll give you a moment to mullet over.   [MINE! I WROTE THIS ONE!]   5th:  Do you have any D batteries I can borrow?  6th:  Don't you sing baritone in the Fish 'n' Flannel Chorus?   [I ALSO WROTE THIS ONE! ISN'T IT STUPID?]   7th:  Your gash or mine?  8th:  And you cleared that whole stand of trees in HOW many minutes?  Grrrrrrr!!  9th:  Is that a doughnut in your pants or are you just glad -- hey, it IS a doughnut!  Can I have a bite?   [MINE! MINE! MINE! AND ACTUALLY, I THINK THIS ONE IS PRETTY FUNNY!]

       "It does not affect your daily life very much if your neighbor marries a box turtle. But that does not mean it is right. ... Now you must raise your children up in a world where that  union of man and box turtle  is on the same legal footing as man and wife." -- Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), advocating a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage in a speech July 8, 2004, to the Heritage Foundation.                              "In every society, the definition of marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality. That's not to pick on homosexuality. It's not, you know, man on child,  man on dog , or whatever the case may be." Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa), in an AP interview April 7, 2003.   OK.  We get it, Republican Senators.  You're obsessed with hatred for other human beings.  You're obsessed with dividing the world into Us and Them.  You're obsessed with animal fucking.  Well, guess what?  You're looking more and more desperate as you try to justify your wholly unjustifiable opinions -- and you're actually making eloquent arguments  for  gay marriage in the process.    Where you sow hatred and division, gay marriage celebrates love and respect.  Where you paint mental pictures of man-on-animal sex, gay marriage celebrates the physical union between adult humans.    Do you REALLY see the whole box turtle argument as valid, Mr. Cornyn?  Since box turtles can't declare vows or sign marriage licenses or stuff their little turtle friends in ugly bridesmaid dresses or even so much as demonstrate emotional or intellectual free will, this puerile little example you coughed up makes you look rather ignorant, don't you think?  And it also kind of makes you look like a pervy little turtle fucker.  What's more, Mr. Cornyn, the current state of marriage mandates that "you must raise your children up in a world where  the whimsical union of Britney Spears and some random childhood friend  is on the same legal footing as man and wife."  Which is more demeaning to the so-called sacred institution of marriage: ludicrously hypothetical man-and-box-turtle marriage or wholly legal and legitimate 55-hour heterosexual sham marriage?    And since -- deep in your cold, black heart -- you probably already know the answer to that question, where is the legislation you're writing that ensures impulsive marriages like Britney's don't continue to threaten and cheapen the already shaky institution of marriage?  In fact, every real and measurable threat to the institution of marriage comes solely from heterosexuals, who are the only people currently allowed to marry.  And these threats are both legion and caustically destructive: divorce, adultery, annulment, premarital sex, spouse abuse and the unquenchable demand for abortion that continues to polarize our nation.    Where is your legislation that criminalizes these actions as they relate to marriage?  Where is your sense of decency?  Where is your soul?

       The  urlLink chorus  show.  No fuckups. Two standing ovations. Some shameless backstage flirting with one of our adorable new members.  It all adds up to a good time.  And speaking of good times, apparently a few dedicated members of our chorus worked  very hard  this weekend to make the visiting German chorus feel at home (and tingly and wet and sticky).  Gay men are such pigs.  And we're lousy about keeping our dalliances discreet.  God love us.  Every one.  (For the record, I was NOT among this weekend's international sexual ambassadors.  The Germans seemed nice enough, but not one of them did anything to carbonate my hormones.  Besides, I was invited to a party on Saturday night.  Yes,  that  kind of party.  And it was a total waste of makeup.)   The expanding blogosphere.  Fellow chorus member  urlLink Rick  now has a blog.  Give him a visit. Make him feel welcome. (But not like you're a horny chorus boy and he's a visiting German.  It's been done.)   The bathroom.  Dear Kohler,  I recently installed a bathroom  urlLink faucet  made by your company.  I'm a fairly competent plumber, with lots of successful DIY experience and  two  rolls of plumber's tape in my toolbox.  So I know what I'm doing.  And I know that replacing a simple faucet -- especially when you have all the right tools at hand -- should take 30 minutes.  45 tops.    I also therefore know you're a bunch of morons whose bad design decisions transformed a quick project into a full-weekend ordeal for me.  Who ever heard of a faucet with female water-supply connectors?  And how did you determine that the water-supply hoses you included would offer only 3/8" compression fittings?  (What about those of us with 1/2" pipes in our walls?  Don't we get a voice?)  And why -- in a shallow gesture toward standard plumbing sizes -- did you include female-to-male adapters (a medical miracle!) that made the faucet too big to fit through standard holes in standard sinks?  WHY DO YOU SUCK SO MUCH?  Even though I now loathe you and all your employees with every fiber of my being, the faucet looks quite handsome in my snappy new bathroom.  But only because I had to lug the whole damn thing to my friendly neighborhood Ace Hardware Store -- TWICE -- and have the kindly old proprietor -- who was also quite stymied by your poor design choices -- help me jerry-rig the water-supply elements I needed to get your fucking faucet working properly.  You suck and I hate you.  Sincerely, Jake

      Our  urlLink Chicago Gay Men's Chorus  show opens tonight -- and it closes tomorrow night after a grand total of three performances, so you have a very small window of opportunity to see us.  We had our final dress rehearsal last night, and I must say I'm pretty impressed with the whole thing.  It's not all about us, either; we usually invite a guest chorus to join us for our Pride show.  And this year we've even thrown in a BONUS chorus -- giving you THREE choruses of singing homosexuals for the price of ONE!  The first group on our stage is our sister ensemble, the  urlLink Windy City Gay Chorus .  It's gotten smaller over the years, but it still packs a musical wallop.  My favorite piece from the Windy City set is its closer, a rousing arrangement of "What Do You Do with a Drunken Sailor?"  Very fun.  The second group is visiting us all the way from Hamburg, Germany, Chicago's sister city.  (Do you see a "sisters" theme here?  While it would be fun to honor this coincidence by singing "Sisters" from  urlLink White Christmas , we've opted simply to call our show  Sisters: Hands Across the Water .)  Anyway, back to the second chorus:  urlLink Schola Cantorosa .  They're German.  They're all vaguely attractive daddy-bear types.  And their set is positively Lynchian ... if David Lynch directed a high-school pirate musical featuring a chorus of aging, hairy German guys.  Parts of their performance are funny.  Parts are really quite beautiful.  And parts are positively bizarre.  Let's just say you haven't experienced quality theater until you've seen a bunch of hairy German homos in pirate outfits singing "MacArthur Park."  Barefoot.  In French.  And then we get to our part of the show.  The Chicago Gay Men's Chorus has long been known for silly, irreverent, energetic, clever performances.  And lately, we've been working hard to add adjectives like musical, lyrical, cerebral and challenging to that list.  And we're succeeding quite nicely.   We open with Aaron Copland's austere "Zion's Walls" and segue into a beautiful piece our endlessly talented musical director wrote to a sexually charged passage from Song of Songs. Two of my other favorite numbers are a demonically powerful, wickedly syncopated piece in Latin called "Daemon Irrepit Callidus" and a haunting arrangement of "Tenting Tonight" that offers a poignant commentary on our country's state of war.  And we close our set with a hoppin' little dance segment (with gen-you-ine Appalachian clogging!) that I choreographed.  Then all three choruses join forces to close the show with a group number that's a little slice of hell for anyone on stage who considers himself any kind of musician. The Germans picked it out, and it's a freakishly stupid song with freakishly stupid lyrics ("Love iiiiiiiiiiiiis the answeeeeeeeer!") that a great many of us have already performed. IN JUNIOR-HIGH SWING CHOIR.  Embarrassing ensemble closer notwithstanding, this concert promises to be pretty amazing.  So go!  Get your tickets!  Enjoy our musicianship!  Applaud us!  Loudly!  Here's all the info you need:   Performances:    Friday, July 9, 8:00 pm   Saturday, July 10, 5:00 pm   Saturday, July 10, 8:30 pm   The Athenaeum Theatre, 2936 N. Southport, Chicago (at Lincoln and Wellington)   Tickets are available at:    The Athenaeum Theater Box Office: 773-935-6860   Ticketmaster: 312-902-1500 or  urlLink ticketmaster.com    More information:     urlLink cgmc.org

      The bathroom re-do is almost complete:  • The painting and all subsequent touching up are finished.  I hope.  I may look for some funky gold and/or silver stenciling to decorate the tops of the walls, though, because they're looking rather plain.  I just haven't decided if that's too gay. (I also have this weird decorating fantasy of stenciling all the Latin conjugations of "to wash" -- lavo, lavat, lavas, etc. -- around the wall above the shower.  But I need to 1) make sure I have the conjugations right and 2) find a cool lettering stencil or 3) develop a steady hand and paint the words myself.  So it will probably never happen.)  • Bob went with me to Expo Center on Tuesday after work to help pick out a shiny new faucet and space-agey new towel bars (one of which I had to exchange for a shorter one last night before rehearsal because apparently I suck at measuring).  The towel bars are up and sporting towels already; the faucet will have to wait until this weekend when I have time to make the three trips to the hardware store that are required every time I replace plumbing.  • I bought new outlets and switches (to be installed this weekend when I have daylight to compensate for the power being off) and even a new doorstop (installed last night).  • I still can't find the right replacement bulbs for the vanity mirror.  (Damn.  Gotta keep shopping.)  • I also can't find a decent-looking metal soap holder to replace the worn-looking one installed in my shower wall.  I may just try to polish it and keep the lights low to hide its abject shabbiness.  But I bought new grout for it, and nothing spruces up a shabby shower like shiny new grout.   But here's where I need your help:   On a recent episode of  Queer Eye , Thom decorated a whole wall in someone's house with little three-ish-inch square blocks of wood that he put votives on.  It looked totally cool, and I figured it would be a cinch to find those blocky little shelves in practically any store.  I figured wrong.  I can't find the fuckers anywhere. (Places I've looked so far: Crate & Barrel, Pier 1, Z Gallerie, Expo Center, Restoration Hardware, Bombay Company, Pottery Barn, Home Depot, and a range of google searches for every combination of the words  shelf ,  small ,  square ,  votive ,  candle  and  curio  that I can think of.)  So do you, dear readers, have any idea where to find them?  I don't care if they're wood or metal or some wholly unnatural man-made material (I can always paint them).  But my bathroom renovation will be incomplete and all my future bowel movements will be slightly unsatisfying if I don't have a wall of votives on little blocks of wood to stare at as I perch on the throne.  Please.  I'm on my knees.  (And while I'm down here, I see another little spot that needs more paint.  Shit.)

      The  urlLink Proud to Run  race results are finally posted -- and I finally beat my personal best on a 10K!  Actually, I beat my personal best on pretty much anything I've ever run; I've been clocking in at 9-minute miles for years.  But 54:40 minutes ÷ 6.2 miles (why they call it a 10K but still break down the pace by miles is beyond me) = 8.77-minute miles. Woo-hoo!

       One.  We have a winner in the Be The First Stranger To Recognize Jake From His Blog contest!  Sunday night at Sidetrack, a cute boy walked up to me and asked me how  urlLink Red Shirt  was doing.  Seems he's been reading this thing for a while and he recognized me from my picture.  How cool is that?  He also said he's starting his own blog.  He said he'd email me the link -- and I said I'd pass it along to you, faithful readers -- when he felt he had enough posts to warrant sharing.  So if you're the cute boy and you're reading this (and I hope you are), get typing!   Two.  It seems there's a cute gay guy in Colorado who got fag bashed outside a gay bar, and when the paramedics found  his digital camera  on him, they used it to take  urlLink pictures  of his genitals while he was unconscious.  So he's suing.  Stupid paramedics.  Smart gay guy.   Three.  I painted my bathroom  naked  this weekend.  One reason: because I didn't feel like digging out my painting clothes.  Better reason: because I can.  It's just one of the many,  many  exciting benefits of being single and living alone.   Sigh.  I need a boyfriend.

      Those of you who've been in my bathroom know that 1) it takes beige and white to new heights of dullness 2) there have been little paint-sample chips taped to the tiles next to my shower for almost three years and 3) clearly I'd much rather talk about getting rid of the beige than actually doing something about it.  In my defense, there are quite a few factors contributing to my inertia:  • The beige tiles, though boring, are in good shape, so I couldn't decide if it was worth the trouble to rip them out and start over.  • The vanity and mirror, though boring, are of a non-standard size, so I couldn't decide if it was worth the expense to replace them.  • I have only one bathroom, so any major overhaul would force me to poop in the kitchen sink for a couple weeks.  • Two different shades of beige tiles, a white vanity and a putty-gray sink make finding a color that ties everything together a bit of a challenge.  Well, those of you fascinated enough by this story to have read this far will be thrilled to know that I finally made a damn decision this weekend -- and  I actually painted my bathroom.   I started on Sunday when I realized I hadn't been invited to any barbecues (sniff).  I figured I'd focus my unused patriotic energies on ridding the country of ugly towel bars and mousy-blah color schemes.  So I ripped down the hardware, spackled the holes and primed all the rough spots.    Then I went to buy the paint.  It seems, though, that there was some national holiday on Sunday that required all the paint stores to be closed.  So I woke up first thing Monday morning and headed out to stock up on paint and painting supplies.  I was going to get new towel bars and a new faucet as well, but the Loewe's towel-bar-and-faucet aisle was a paragon of disorganization and poor selection.  And I couldn't find the damn Home Depot.  (How can you lose a Home Depot?)  But I figured I'd need to paint before I could install hardware anyway, so I headed home and started burying the beige under two coats of a mossy, earthy brown called Perfect Greige, which tied the beige tiles, white Formica and putty-gray sink together nicely.  I had no idea what a Greige was, but I figured it was perhaps some rare stone indigenous to Northern Europe and used mainly to build 16th century English castles.  Or maybe it was a region in the Sahara known for its pristine, sun-bleached sands.  But when Paul called and I was describing it to him, he figured it was a portmanteau of  gray  and  beige .  ACK!  Terrified of the bourgeois implications of covering my bathroom with such a pedestrian color name, I turned to my good friend  urlLink dictionary.com , who informed me that greige is an adjective used to describe textiles that aren't bleached or dyed.  Whew.  My fussy, label-whore homosexual reputation was still intact.  At least in my bathroom.  As usual, the color dried a little darker than I'd hoped.  And the ceiling and door, which I painted one shade lighter -- in the extremely pedestrian-sounding Versatile Gray -- don't look any different from the walls.  But it's done.  The painting is done.  The paint chips are gone.  The ugly towel bars are gone.  And -- most important of all -- the 1985 suburban Holiday Inn aesthetic has been completely eradicated from my loo.  And if that's not a reason to set off fireworks, I don't know what is.

      It was cool and stormy in Iowa.  I had just completed my first year of high school (which, in Iowa, was my sophomore year).  My best friend at the time was a just-graduated senior named Lucy.  She and I had been in tons of choirs and shows together that year and had become very close.  So close, in fact, that I had come out to her earlier that spring as we huddled under a blanket together on a choir-tour bus with a broken heater.  Which made her -- if you don't count the creepy old men at the dirty bookstore at the edge of town -- the first person I'd ever come out to.  So back to July 5.  Lucy and I had braved the storms to drive  clear  across town to the movie theaters at Westdale Mall to get our second fix of that dreamy Kevin Bacon in "Footloose."  I don't remember being terribly restless or upset about anything by the time she dropped me off at home that night, but I guess I became that way when I walked in the door and found my parents in some stupid little disagreement over some stupid little something.  I don't remember the topic.  I don't remember whether or not it involved me.  I don't remember whether or not I was even a part of the conversation.  But at some point I blurted out this inelegant verbal provocation: "Well, at least you can   talk   about  your  problems."  On the surface, it was an innocuous little pointless-fight-starter not unlike any other slightly charged statement that could come out of any other moody 16-year-old's mouth.  But it was definitely fueled by my frustration over being gay in a world that hated gay people -- especially my lonely little world, which consisted of a Reagan Republican household in a smallish Midwestern town.  I don't remember where the conversation went from there, but I vaguely remember storming up the stairs and throwing myself angrily (wearily? fearfully?) into bed.  And soon after, my mom came up and sat down next to me to see what  my  problem was.  Again, the details are fuzzy, but I do remember there was some hemming and hawing.  And that the topic came first from  her  mouth -- as undramatically and inelegantly as I'd started it: "Are you not interested in girls?"  I fearfully (defiantly? timidly?) nodded my head.  And I was officially out to my family.  The family that, on the rare occasion it even talked about homosexuality, did so disparagingly.  Sometimes in the same sentence as the word "disown."  And I still had two more years of high school ahead of me.  Mom's first reaction was to advise me not to tell a soul -- specifically my father.  Which I had no intention of doing anyway, thank you very much.  Unbeknownst to me, though, Mom promptly told Dad  and  a bunch of their friends.  So things around the house got pretty ugly.  But not in the beat-and/or-disown-your-kid way I'd feared.  Everything was just ... tense.  And when my grandma on my mom's side died the next month, Mom -- who was an only child and now an adult orphan -- even uttered the phrase "I've lost my mother  and  I've lost my son" in one of the (finally) more dramatic moments of the whole coming-out-to-my-parents process.  After learning that Dad knew my little secret, the three of us started the Therapy Tour, which included stops at the family counselor's, the psychotherapist's and the offices of a range of religious leaders.  Mercifully, they all gave my parents the same feedback:  There's nothing wrong with homosexuality, your son is remarkably well-adjusted about it and the problem lies with you.  It took my folks a couple years of Not Talking About It to unlearn the lifetime of stupid prejudices that had been imprinted on their DNA by societal ignorance and the Christian hate industry, but they (relatively quickly) became the coolest, most well-adjusted parents a little gay boy could ask for.  And, 20 years and one long-term boyfriend (who still wasn't out to his folks by the time he was 30) later, I'm especially glad I got the coming-out-to-the-family drama over and done with at such an early age.  So happy coming-out anniversary, Mom and Dad.  (Not that you'll ever see this.)  I love you.

       One.  The Bod and I had our first "real" date last night.  (After a couple ... um ...  informal  dates and two weeks' worth of steamy emails, we decided to venture out in the real world together and see what kind of sparks we could produce in the harsh light of day.)  So I race home from work, pound out a quick five-mile run, scrub and shave stuff in the shower, and give the condo a quick tidying.  Then I put on a muscle shirt, some cargo shorts that hang low on my hips and my sexy new flip-flops and sit down with the paper, waiting for him to show up.  And when he does, he's dressed for a  date  date -- in funky shoes, jeans and a sexy knit shirt that clings in all the right places.  Oops.  So I quickly change into something more gay-dressy and we head out to dinner.  And then things start to feel awkward.  He spends a lot of the evening with his arms crossed in front of him, the conversation never really takes off and he doesn't try very hard to help it along by asking me questions -- except why I'm so quiet.  (But I remind myself I'm lousy at evaluating dates -- when I have one I think goes pretty  urlLink well  I never hear from the guy again.  So I tell myself maybe I'm judging the situation too harshly.)  And then he drops the R-bomb.  ACK!  It seems I'm having regular dates now with  urlLink two   Republicans .  (He promises, though, that he doesn't vote a straight party ticket -- which I can't respect on either side of the aisle.)   So we survive dinner and head back to my place for dessert.  As usual, we're  very  good at dessert.  Evening saved.  But later, as we're drifting off to sleep, I realize just how weird it is to snuggle up with a relative stranger.  And how much I don't like it.  Sure, it fills a loneliness void -- but in a profoundly unfulfilling way.  I  so  need a boyfriend.   Two.  I'm choreographing part of next weekend's  urlLink chorus  show, and we had a dance rehearsal this afternoon in Boystown.  Because there was an afternoon Cubs game a few blocks away, I took the El down and the bus back, stopping at my friendly neighborhood Jewel on my way home.  And right there, in front of the salad dressing, I run into  urlLink Chris , my dance-floor romance from Sound-bar over IML weekend.  And DAMN, if he still doesn't look blond and tan and handsome and built like a brick shithouse.  We make small talk.  We make more small talk.  We giggle nervously.  We keep having these long, happily awkward stare-into-each-other's-eyes things.  The salad-dressing-needy shoppers get irritated that our sexual sparks are coming between them and the mouth-watering flavor of bacon bleu cheese.  And then ...  Well, let's just say that my behavior in a less-than-24-hour-period is EXACTLY what Pat Robertson is talking about, bless his cold, dark, judgmental little Republican heart.  (And let's also say that Chris has no tan lines -- a fact that will keep me awake well into the night.)   Three.  Chris and I wrap up our bidness in time for him to drop me off at a nice little last-minute holiday dinner party in Andersonville with a bunch of friends.  And it's just great.  James cooks a KILLER dinner, including tender salmon, a robust meat-and-tomato sauce over perfectly cooked penne, and bowls of fresh fruit over real whipped cream.  We talk.  We laugh.  We watch  urlLink Scary Movie , which I haven't seen.  We laugh some more.  The dog gets excited and pees a little on the floor.  Everyone's happy.  And it's all good.  And instead of going to a bar looking for more trouble when the party breaks up, I head home to do a little blog, make a little something to eat and get down in front of the Tivo tonight.

      Bill is another copywriter at my agency. He's about my size, and our work schedules are roughly in synch, so we've become regular lifting partners every day at lunch.  We've also started discussing our workouts in a secret made-up language.  You know, to stay ahead of the competition.  It's extremely funny to us, but then so is our ongoing discussion of the guest contestants we'd cast on Celebrity Teabag once we find a network progressive enough to buy into the idea.  (We also find poop jokes funny.  Invite us to your next party at your own risk.)  So if you're curious, here's our weekly workout schedule, in our ultra-secret language.  See if you can crack the code:   Lunes: Abdominamos.  We do a whole killer ab/oblique/lower back workout to start the week.  It's a great way to help keep our pants hanging nice and low around our boyish hips, and it prevents any embarrassing flabbiness from happening during the week.   Martes: Cardiomos.  We also sometimes tack on some quadando and hamstrando.   Miércoles: Chestamos.  A whole day devoted to the chest. Because one of us is gay. And still single.   Jueves: Cardiomos una vez mas.  I like doing the stairmaster on this day because it offers a good calf and ass workout.  And lord knows I need all the ass I can grow.   Viernes: Armamos y shouldemos.  It's almost the weekend on Fridays -- and that means we have to pump up the guns if we're going to attract guys.  Bill, being heterosexual and married, really doesn't follow my logic.  But he's never had to compete for (and with) other gymbunnies in a crowded bar.    Sábado y domingo: Jodemos.  If we're lucky.

      at singing!  This I learned the painful way when he led all of Wrigley Field on the most tuneless version of "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" in the entire history of bad tonality.  He was so bad and so off that I couldn't even find the notes myself.  And I've sung this shit professionally.  He was our choral leader tonight because apparently the Cubs have theme nights.  And tonight's theme was  washed-up TV stars with poochy tummies  '70s Night.  Which was actually kind of fun -- there were tons of people there in hideously authentic disco costumes.  And there was even one little anachronism of a kid sitting next to us in a hysterical Austin Powers getup, complete with wig and glasses and frilly shirt sticking out of an elfin velvet coat.  The "us" in that last sentence was me and my very cool co-worker Andrew.  We decided long ago that we needed a Cubs night together so 1) we could do something fun that didn't involve direct mail and 2) he could teach me everything there is to know about baseball.  Because I used to know a little about it, but I forgot.  And I feel like there's this whole world of "normal" (i.e., not gay) stuff to know out there and I've let it pass me by for the last 36 years. So I'm catching up.  Naturally, the one night I have a social life planned, I get stuck with a project at work that is due out the door tonight and is 1) way understaffed and 2) way behind schedule.  Which, ironically, is right on schedule in the strange and mysterious world we call My Office.  What's more, it's for a client team that I'm not even on.  What's even more, I'm catching a flight to NYC at 8:00 tomorrow morning to present it to that client.  What's even even more, it's midnight as I'm typing this at home (after watching the Cubs get CLOBBERED in the six innings we made it in time to see) and I would bet money the rest of the team on the project is still at work scrambling to finish everything in time for our early flight.   Ah, the glamorous world of advertising.  All the permed Larry Tateness of  Bewitched . All the sex-on-the-boardroom-tables social fun of  Melrose Place .  All the jaw-dropping stupidity of  What Women Want .

      My computer is fixed.  I didn't have to spend $500 for a new hard drive and the labor to install it.  I didn't have to wait two weeks to get it done.  (In fact the fixing was free -- except for 2 hours of waiting and $20 in cab fare.)  Everything seems to be working OK.   The bad news:  I lost everything on my hard drive.  5,000 songs I meticulously downloaded and categorized from my own CDs.  Songs I did the same thing with from borrowed CDs.  Songs I paid to download from the iTunes store.  Emails I was saving.  Email addresses.  Pictures of vacations, visits with the kids and fun parties.  Pictures of ... um ... other things.  Movie clips.  Bookmarks.  "Borrowed" software.  All gone.   The not-so-bad news:  I did back up most of my hard drive in October.  So I have older pictures.  Resumes.  Old Christmas letters.  My Christmas address book.  The beginnings of that book that will make me rich some day.  So all is not lost.  But the little drama fest is over.  I can check email from home again.  I realized I could survive for entire days without trolling the Internet for everything from late-breaking news to blog updates to pictures of naked guys.  And this spirit of purging has extended to other piles of crap cluttering up my physical world.  I also vacuumed up a 20 lb. dust bunny that had been hiding under my iMac.  And I now have completely up-to-date versions of most basic software.  We now return you to your regularly scheduled programming.  Just as soon as I check bigmuscle one more time.

       Preamble: I talked about a million different things in my last two posts, but the vast majority of the comments you-all posted in response were about: 1) sex and 2) porn.  You are ALL a bunch of pervs.  And I love you for it.  But be warned: This post is about a weekend with my sister, her husband, my 2-year-old niece and my 5-year-old nephew.  So there will be no sex or porn in this post for you to respond to.  I just wanted to get that said.   So ... the weekend.  First of all, my niece has finally learned to say "uncle."  So I am no longer Uppa Jake.  Which kinda makes me sad.  But this morning when I didn't understand her announcement that sounded like "Iwapaeeiatalt," she STERNLY clarified her statement: "I wen potty in the TAHlet!"  So we're still getting cute language-related stories out of her.  She's also in that endearing how-far-can-I-test-other-people stage -- so when you tell her not to throw her hat, she throws it three more times.  And when you take it away, she SCREAMS in indignation.  Whee.  Random toddler meltdowns notwithstanding, the five of us had a great weekend together.  We rode the TRAIN, which was probably more exciting than anything else we did -- and, given that the kids are still young enough to ride free there's a painful irony when you consider how much it cost to get them into Shedd Aquarium on Saturday.  Speaking of which, Shedd was probably the biggest disappointment of the weekend.  The place just didn't have the oomph I was expecting.  It was interesting -- and  crowded  with families and kids.  (And it was one of the many places that I decided this weekend were lousy locations for picking up men.)  And the dolphin show?  YAWN.  How could a show aimed at kids -- with cute dolphins doing funny tricks -- bore an entire auditorium  full  of kids?  It found a way.  The arena is pretty spectacular, though -- with a view of the lake that can't be beat.  We went there with our cousin John and his wife Laura and their two kids, who are the same ages as ours.  (And by "ours" I mean "my sister's," but I didn't want to spell that all out and make this paragraph long and boring.)  Underwhelmed by everything in Shedd Aquarium, the nine of us headed outside to the grassy hills on the museum campus, where the adults (when did I become one of "the adults"?) sat and talked and ate ice cream while the kids rolled around and had a WONDERFUL time -- again, without any cost to those of us with wallets.  From there, we meandered up to the magnificent new Millennium Park, which is now my favorite spot in all of Chicago.  And then we headed home to dinner, baths, bedtime and time for the adults to sit around and have distraction-free conversation.  Yesterday, after a leisurely breakfast of pancakes (my brother-in-law has started the traditin that the weekends are always Pancake Days for the kids, and I was excited to be able to play adult and cook them pancakes myself -- except I suck at making pancakes) we headed down to the new U.S. Cellular Field for my first Sox Game.  USCF is an impressive, if not bland, structure that doesn't feel as massive as it is.  And it has an amazing sound system.  (This we know because the sound person kept playing little 3-second clips of songs  all the goddamn fucking time  whenever there was a lull in the game.  Because the White Sox are obviously worried sick that if there is one single moment where the fans aren't BOMBARDED with stimulation, we might all get immediately bored, pack up and leave.)  And call me a north-side snob, but I prefer the Cubs and Wrigley Field to the Sox and USCF.  Maybe it's a convenience thing.  Maybe it's an ambience thing (Wrigley has tons of it; USCF has none).  Maybe it's a National League thing (designated hitters are for pussy teams).  After the game, we did the dinner/bedtime/adult talk time thing again -- only this time we watched "Six Feet Under", which this week included sex scenes involving two men  and  two women.  Which is EXACTLY the kind of thing you want to watch with your sister. (OK -- so I guess I  did  work porn into this post. Go figure.)  And now it's Monday and I'm at work.  And my back hurts from sharing a lumpy fold-out bed ("premium mattress" my  ass ) with a 5-year-old who KICKS in his sleep.  Cute kid story:  To keep my nephew from wandering out in the hallway of my condo building, I told him there were hall monsters out there.  So the one time he went out in the hall and discovered we weren't behind him like he thought, he SCREAMED in terror.  So I had to teach him to stomp every time he went in the hall to scare the hall monsters away.  I'm sure the neighbors love me.

      So I took my computer in to be fixed.  The verdict:  My hard drive is as dead as Rush Limbaugh's third marriage.  Fortunately, I was in the habit of regularly backing up the stuff on my hard drive.  Unfortunately, I just discovered that my most "recent" backup was in October.  (I SWEAR I backed stuff up like around April, but apparently I was wrong.  Kinda like Rush Limbaugh about the "sanctity" of marriage.)  Now I'm just making a mental inventory of the things that are lost.  There's nothing whose absence will create a black hole in my life, but I'm a little anxious about the loss of the BILLIONS of carefully catalogued songs in my iTunes.  I still have most of the CDs, but I'll never get back the hours and hours and  hours  I spent organizing them into various playlists.  And then there's my obsessive little need to save every picture of a hot guy I've encountered on the Web.  I never looked at the pictures once I downloaded them, but for some reason it was comforting to know I had my own little cache of cute-guy porn at the ready in case I got an emergency call from ... um ... Michael Jackson.  Or the Pope.  Anyway, I decided to extend this newfound freedom from cyber crap to real-life crap last night, and I took a four-foot stack of unread magazines to the Dumpster.  Literally.  It extended from my fingertip knuckles all the way to my armpits ... all the way down a painfully s-l-o-w elevator ride from the 24th floor to the back alley.    What's even more embarrassing to admit is that a lot of those magazines came with me to Chicago from Iowa four years ago.  There were Peoples featuring long-forgotten TV shows, Advocates featuring long-forgotten political battles, and endless issues of Men's Health, Out and Genre that just had hot guys on the covers.  But I'd PAID for these magazines, my inner self rationalized, so I was still going to find the time to READ them, damnit.  (I did save a two-foot stack of unread New Yorkers and Smithsonians and Historic Preservations, though.  Baby steps.)  The next frontier:  About 50 VHS tapes with ... um ... adult content.  I haven't looked at them in two or three years.  Hell, I haven't even had a working VCR for most of 2004.  And then my shopping bag collection.  And then the 5-foot stack of neatly folded jeans I haven't worn since the Clinton administration.  And then the shoe situation.  And then those thick piles of quarterly statements from my various investments.  (Jesus -- do they expect you to KEEP all that paperwork?)  But first, I must go through the proper stages of grief for a crashed hard drive.  And I have the PERFECT shoes for the occasion.  If I can just remember which pile I hid them in ...

      The August issue of  Chicago   magazine is out, which officially signals the end of my July-long reign as one of  urlLink Chicago’s Top 20 Singles . And while you’d probably think membership in this elite club would bring me a lifetime of untold love, happiness and shoes, you’d be wrong.  In fact, it has brought me nothing but disappointment, embarrassment and random little tufts of hair on my back that my workout partner takes great delight in pointing out (they may just be a result of my getting older, though). And here, for your reading pleasure, are my final ruminations on the exciting process and the dismal results of the whole adventure:     MY PROFILE  Could it BE any more obsessed with gay stereotypes? (We got the drag and the (yawn) French lessons squeezed in there, but where’s the mention of the marathon training and the sky diving and the career accomplishments?) Could it BE any more inaccurate and misleading? (Paris in the fall? Since when is March in the fall? Not interested in finding a “song and dance man”? What part of “I’d love to find someone who’s as into musical theater as I am” is so hard to understand?) Could it BE any less appealing to potential suitors? (Apparently not, as you’ll learn further down in this diatribe.) And to add insult to injury, the  urlLink online version  is truncated to focus on just the REALLY gay stuff. Go me.    MY PHOTO  I hate it. My family hates it. All my friends hate it. People have either said it looks nothing like me, or—if they were feeling charitable—they merely said it looks “OK.” I decided to let the anonymous masses vote impartially on its appeal, so I posted it on hotornot.com a month ago—along with a picture I took of myself as the control.  Here’s a comparison of photo shoots and results:   Their photo shoot  • Professional studio • Professional lighting • Professional hair and makeup artist • Professional stylist who picked my clothes,  steamed  them and even fussed over their drape every time I moved • Professional lighting-level checker  • Professional photographer • Assistant to professional photographer • Lady who got me a refreshing beverage • Multiple cameras • Two rolls of film equaling about 50 pictures • One hour on a beautiful May afternoon • Final selection by a professional photo editor The result:  urlLink This monstrosity , which bears a greater likeness to  urlLink Grandpa Munster  than to me.  Hot Or Not rating as of this post: 6.8    My photo shoot  • Studio = my bedroom on a sunny June morning, soon after I woke up • Wardrobe = my favorite T-shirt, still kind of wrinkly but relatively clean • No makeup • Total bedhead • Cheap digital camera perched on a book on a chair on my bed • About 10 shots using my automatic timer, many of which looked pretty good, IMHO The result:  urlLink This picture , which I had to crop because my bedhead was worse than I thought, and since I wasn’t able to look through the viewfinder I was barely in the picture anyway. But I think it looks a lot like the guy I see in the mirror every morning.  Hot Or Not rating as of this post: 9.4   Point spread between low-reality, piss-poor-quality professional picture and my modest attempts at self-portraiture: 2.8  I rest my case.    THE RESULTS  The magazine set up a special email address for each one of us—and the editors  specifically  instructed us to check it every day because they said the mailboxes tend to fill up with marriage proposals and then the magazine has to field angry calls from potential suitors who can’t get through.  They also told us that they get lots of letters for the singles, which they regularly forward to us in large envelopes.  Furthermore, we were told anecdotally that potential suitors historically have found many featured singles in the phone book and inundated them with phone calls and flowers. One editor described the whole experience as “the heavens opening up and raining down men” on me.  Here’s how it  really  played out:   Emails:  • 1 from a drag queen who can’t spell • 1 from a guy I hadn’t heard from since we did a theme-park show together in Buffalo in 1988—he saw the magazine in his doctor’s NY office • 1 from a neighbor who also saw the magazine in his doctor’s office • A handful from a bunch of friends back in Iowa who were told about it via an email from another friend • A buttload of spam   Packages of letters in the mail:   • 1 free book about finding my soul mate with a cover letter from the author that began, “As one of  Chicago  magazine’s Top 20 Singles, I wanted you to have a copy of my book … .” (Note to those of you who for some unfathomable reason aren’t irritated to the point of justifiable homicide about misplaced modifiers: The author was NOT one of the Top 20 Singles, but the way he muddied up this sentence CLEARLY stated that he was. And he’s a fucking WRITER. Who should KNOW BETTER.)   Flowers:  Let’s just say the dust levels in my vase collection are higher than they were before the issue came out.    Phone calls:  Gay men are notoriously clumsy dialers. I’m sure the phone will start ringing any day now.   Marriage proposals:  Maybe the cousin-fuckers in Missouri who just voted gay-marriage discrimination into their constitution discouraged all the marriage-minded men from contacting me. Maybe.   Being recognized by strangers:  Actually, this has happened a couple of times. A friend of a friend met me at a crowded street fair one night and then recognized me the next day in the magazine. And  urlLink this guy  recognized me on Friendster.  So that was kind of cool.    FINAL THOUGHTS  You know how Charlotte on  Sex in the City  dreamed for so long of having a beautiful engagement picture in the  New York Times  and was so disappointed when it was printed with a huge Hitler-mustache smudge across her face?  That’s kind of how I feel about the whole thing.  It's not like I'm deserving of any level of attention and admiration—or like the "honor" of being picked to be a Top 20 Single makes one whit of difference in the world. But I was sooooo excited about the prospect of being profiled in a glossy, high-end national publication (and who wouldn’t be?) and I even let myself fantasize that this—finally—would be the catalyst for sending me on celestial trajectories of social excitement (dare I say validation?), career satisfaction and—yes—even True Love.  And when I saw the goofy picture and read the profile that clearly cast me as the token faggot in the Rich Straight White People Magazine, I was almost sick with disappointment, embarrassment and the realization that once again my life wasn’t following the Boy of Destiny path I’d been hoping for.   The only positive thing I’ve gotten out of the whole thing is the occasional praise from gay people who note that I’m the first Top 20 Single (apparently in the history of the magazine) who’s totally, shamelessly out. (Not like I had any control over the content of the profile, but I did tell the writer that I’m totally out in life and that I’m not afraid of bigots, so there was no reason to reduce my sexuality to mere innuendo. And for once, she listened.) And—on a side note—that deafening silence in response to the profile includes a welcome silence from the goat-ball lickers in the Christian hate industry who have been so quick to send me anonymous save-the-gerbils postcards when I've had gay stuff published in  Time  and  Newsweek  and other national newsmagazines. So either they’re threatened by publications with three-syllable titles or they know better than to fuck with me. Because since I’m still totally dateless (sigh) I have plenty of time—and unfocused frustration—to fuck with them back. And Christians vs. Faggots is one arena where I'm used to winning.

      I finally changed cell phone carriers yesterday.  After four relatively happy years with Cingular, I'm now a T-Mobile customer.  I had no real beef with my Cingular service -- except for lots of dropped calls and a chronic inability to use my phone in my house or in my office.  But I live on the 24th floor and work in a concrete-reinforced bunker, so deep down I know I'd have the same reception problems with any cellular carrier.  Deep down.  But Cingular was always just short of helpful every time I had a question or problem.  For instance, this one time when my phone was on the fritz (doesn't that sound like German porn?) I took it to a Cingular store and the guy behind the counter snippily told me I had to take it to the store where I first got it.  NOT helpful.  And when I tried to renew my contract two years ago, the guy at the store gave me all kinds of attitude because he KNEW I wasn't quite out of my old contract just yet.  Turns out he was wrong.  Turns out he had no intention of apologizing for being such a scabby little butthole.  Turns out two years later his little bitchfest cost his company a customer.  There was also that issue with the orange.  I hate orange.  I hated getting orange bills in the mail.  I hated the orange logo on my phone.  I hate orange.  (Not that T-Mobile's electro-'80s pink is much of an improvement, but I hate orange more.)  And then there's the issue of Cingular's corporate parent company.  When I moved to Chicago four years ago, Ameritech was the local phone carrier.  At the time, Ameritech was in the middle of a long, painful fit of baaaaaaad customer service.  As in the whole city wasn't getting phones hooked up for months and months.  As in Ameritech would NEVER show up when they promised.  As in every time they did show up there was suddenly some need for some extra $100 charge.  As in the whole city -- present blogger included -- was PISSED.  As in things got so bad Ameritech eventually changed its name to SBC to try to distance itself from its well-earned reputation.  As in to this day, I refuse to do business with Ameritech/SBC/whatever it changes its name to next.  So when the SBC logo suddenly started appearing on my Cingular bill, I vowed to change carriers as soon as my contract expired.  Which happened Saturday.  And just as I was starting to wonder which carrier to switch to, a secret-shopper opening came up at work for T-Mobile.  See, Sprint PCS is one of our clients, so we have various employees doing business with Sprint's competitors to monitor what's going on in the non-Sprint marketplace.  And when I found out  the company would pay my cell phone bill , I jumped at the chance to jump on the pink-logoed bandwagon.  And I'm already impressed.  The people at the T-Mobile store were totally cool and totally helpful last night.  I've discovered I can update my phone address book OVER THE INTERNET.  And my new phone seems to work pretty well at home and at work.  Woo-hoo!  Wow.  I've blathered on and on  and on and on  about fucking  phone service .  And you've read about it.  How sad are we?  To reward you for your tenacity, I'll tell you I had a nice date with an  urlLink adorable guy  last night.  But he seemed awfully jumpy and distracted.  Witness-protection-program jitters, adult-onset ADHD or alphabet drugs?  The jury is still out.  To further reward you, I direct you to  urlLink The Infinite Cat Project .  Which is  exactly  the kind of Web site the Internet was invented for.

      I was just putting the finishing touches on a long-ass post about all my weekend adventures:  - Two awesome plays - One horrible movie - A magnificent dinner cooked by Bob - A magnificent dinner cooked by Bill (and I swear I didn't mention how you burned the beans, Bill -- I SWEAR) - A 10-mile training run interrupted by a bout of heat stroke that left me 4 miles from home with no other option but to walk - And a glowing description of Chicago's magnificent new Millennium Park  when my iTunes suddently coughed, my Safai browser stopped responding and my whole computer FROZE.  FUCK.  And now it won't even boot up with the diagnostic disks that came with it.  FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK.
