       urlLink    Three weeks in and I'm already reduced to posting sketches of Batman I drew twelve years ago - and I had such lofty aspirations for this blog.... Still, I promise my Batman fixation is nowhere near as deep as  urlLink this .&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Stuck inside doing a load of work today - cheered up only by the sight of son number one rooting about in the dirt in the garden - something I can watch for hours. He and the girl next door spend ages making 'woodlice environments' and 'worm retirement homes'. They had to retreat inside during the rain this afternoon and it was an hour or so before I spotted the two snails in an old soup tin that had been invited to share the lounge with them.&nbsp; urlLink

      A strange little beast of a free CD with the Guardian today.  It contains amongst, other things, an ancient, and hardly representative, ska-soaked 'Death in Vegas' track, from the first album way back when (featuring 'Rankin Roger' I do believe), a smattering of Basement Jaxx stuff and a couple of nondescript bits of 'chill out' nonsense from Zero 7 and the like. There's also a dreadful funked up mix of that lovely 'Lazy' track with the David Byrne vocals from a year or two ago, which completely misses the whole languid air of the original.  More to the point though, we get  three   urlLink Orbital  tracks and  not just the duff album tracks you normally get on this sort of thing -  we get "Chime" and "Belfast".  So, this feels like a  'goodbye to Orbital'  CD - though nowhere in the paper do they seem to run with this line -  So, here is my brief tribute instead:  Orbital - I got into you quite late and I only saw you twice (not including a flabby DJ set at  urlLink Bristol Essential Festival , which I kind of wandered away from).  Every time you played in Bristol you played at  urlLink Colston Hall  which is a rubbish venue. You can't drink in the performance area, so you end up necking beer in the bar and then, if you leave to go to the gents, they never let you back into the standing area.  Also 'Satan' on disc was never as good as it was live.  But, for a while there, you were my very favourite 'bald heads behind a monitor' type guys .....easily beating Fatboy and Moby.  I wish you both luck!

      No, it's true - I really don't wish I was at  urlLink Glastonbury . I mean take Sir Macca - Popgod though he is, isn't waving lighters aloft to 'Hey Jude' a bit like, so, Golden Jubilee all of a sudden? And Oasis - not mid 90's mighty Oasis, but a band past it, past it, past it.....indeed , so far past 'it' that they may well come back round to it again as part of some bizarre  urlLink Nietzschen eternal recurrence .  Ok, so I could range the following arguments against this thesis; A) Orbital last ever gig. B) No-one ever goes to festivals for the bands anyway. It's just a chance for ageing  urlLink fifty quid blokes  to flirt with the danger of Rock 'n' Roll.  But no, I'm not just trying to persuade myself at all that its Ok to listen to it on the radio again.....  Anyway, it's gonna chuck it down tomorrow.....    I

      Once more we come to that time when the bloom of english youth are required to make the ultimate sacrifice amongst the mud and horror of some far-flung field that is forever England.....  yep....it looks like it's gonna be another wet Glastonbury Festival.  The third biggest June depression in a century has just lurched over my house like one of those big saucers in "Independence Day" - it's on it's way down to Pilton. Every year I make excuses about not going to Glastonbury. It's not just the fear of repetitive strain industry due to redialling an engaged ticket line for 72 hours. Even in the years when you could get in 'cos someone's mate Dave was helping out on a 'novelty plastic lighters on a bit of leather that never work' stall or when apparently, for a tenner, kindly, chirpy scousers would let you in via their vietcong style tunnel system - I never went. Why? - Well, in recent years, I put it down to Post  urlLink Homelands 2000  stress disorder. I attended said event full of optimism....my 'slightly wrong side of ironic'  urlLink yellow bug-eye glasses  in place...ready for action. I returned , frazzled, traumatised and very, very wet. I don't like that part of the evening when beer soaked dancefloors get slightly 'icky', so three feet of mud just doesn't do it for me. Most of it is a repressed blur. I remember clambering up a hill over half crushed girls in sequinned bikinis and cowboy hats, who emerged from the mud like practitioners of some obscure sin in Dante's inferno. I remember fighting my way onto the lone bus that left the site that night - only to be deposited at a locked railway station, where I sat shivering on my freebie Ericsson bag. (I'm not even going to start on the 'dodgy curry in the carpark' incident). Throughout my misery , I recalled the mocking laughter of an ancient welsh alcoholic who we met on the train going to the fest. Upon hearing about the price of our tickets he exclaimed : "Fifty pound!! You could see  urlLink Shirley Bassey  for that!" Dame Shirley - how I wished for your angelic form to descend from heaven and save us from our watery hell!  So..... urlLink Reading  it'll be for this year...... (But I will be thinking of Michala, Mandy, H, Lee & Connel and everyone else who  is  going this year).  (NB. My esteemed friend Eliot has complained about 'not looking cool enough' in a previous post - Would thus like to point out that he wasn't wearing fluorescent orange shoes and no-one played 'Crazy Horses' - thus he remained totally cool throughout - except for the manic episode when he started bouncing around in the torrential rain asking everyone what their best festival moment was).

       urlLink    A rare foray into yoof culture last night. Went clubbing in Bristol with my good friend Eliot. Ended up in  urlLink Drive By  at the Academy. A depressing experience - I love  urlLink Blowpop  at the same venue, but I didn't get Drive By at all. I can dance to Hip hop - not in a way that is sexy, credible or cool, but in a way, at least, that I  enjoy , but this was all hard-faced girls nonchalantly grinding imaginary beetles into the ground before them. The music didn't get me in the guts or the head, just in the neck, and the venue was thus abandoned. I don't think they are really pushing for the Dad/ Teacher market, so I'm sure they won't be bothered. Eventually ended up in  urlLink The Cooler  doing fat sweaty singalong stuff at something called 'The Trip' alongside a lot of strangely smiley and well-scrubbed alternative types. Made a complete lager-boy, point your finger and mouth the wrong words type fool of myself and probably ended up looking like a hairier version of  urlLink Kurtz  in Apocalypse Now, but, hey, a chip kebab on the way home and it was the perfect evening.(Even if Eliot accused me of carrying my shoes home 'like a girl' and they refused my drunken request for  urlLink 'Crazy Horses' )&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    This month, it seems like the most unlikely people have been laying claim to a definition of 'englishness'. Not only have we had  urlLink this lot  and  urlLink people like this guy , but we have also had Morrisey's  urlLink new single  wandering onto nationalist ground where Mozza has  urlLink come unstuck before .  I've always maintained that Morrisey is a media savvy operator who plays his role and knows how to court controversy, as, I guess,is Mr Kilroy Silk, but there's enough repellent stuff out there to make a good Guardian reading, muesli eating parent like myself raise an eyebrow slightly when a friend returns home from the supermarket with several giant england flags 'for the kids'.  My four year-old son, previously seemingly adverse to overt displays of nationalistic fervour, spent the day draped in a huge cross of St,George and it did seem to bring a particular glint to his eye. It is certainly true that that day's game of  urlLink Power Rangers  (his current prism through which all understanding of human society is reflected) was tinged with a nationalistic fervour ....The English Power Rangers teamed up with the American Power Rangers and declared war on the Australians ..... &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    I was going to post some Batman sketches that I did about twelve years ago, but then I remembered that they'd been done as part of plan to draw a strip based on illegal bare knuckle bouts.....and thus my digression begins. (There were going to be mobsters entering Killer Croc for illegal street fights and so on. This was all pre-'Fight Club', so I forgive myself). Anyway, for a while I was going to name all the quickly-dead opponent guys after british wrestlers of the 1970's like Tony St.Clair, The Royal Brothers, Big Daddy, Mark 'Rollerball' Rocco, Giant Haystacks etc. Top of them all though was 'Kendo Nagasaki'. I don't know if you remember all these guys, but they were an integral part of my Saturday tea-time for years, alongside Doctor Who (more on that later I'm sure...).  This wasn't like your American WWF pantomime. This was something far more disturbing - fat, middle-aged 'sportsmen'in leotards grappling away in a ring. Of course there were massive elements of panto in there - the ritualised tag teams matches where Big Daddy's plucky but hopeless partner would get battered by cheating villainous bad guys before crawling painfully to the ringside arm outstretched to tag the Big D, who would then overcome said villains to the chant of 'Easy! Easy! or the viciously aggressive old lady who would feel compelled to leap from the front row and beat 25 stone sweaty men with her handbag, but the way in which this was all portrayed as serious sport was an integral part of the charm. Like Batman villians, they all had their schtick - one dressed as Catweazel, one looked like a giant haystack, one was really called Shirley, another was really that nice builder from 'Auf Widersehen Pet', but best of all was urlLink  Kendo Nagasaki  - a man who wore a mask and fought off all of his opponents attempts to remove it. Well, he's got his own website and it's a corker. The photos are cool, but the short tale of the 'unmasking' of Kendo Nagasaki has to be the best bit. The combination of athleticism, eastern mysticism and the cheesy glamour of 70's Saturday TV is unbeatable and the site is a fitting tribute to a man who brought 'masked acolytes' and a 'mysterious hooded violinist' to a town hall near you.

       urlLink    At first all you see is a black screen, but then slowly out of the ether a ghostly figure emerges. It steps back. Out of fear? Surprise ? Embarrassment ? Then it gingerly edges forward, shifting it's weight to the other leg and leaning its' head to one side, as if examining something, someone ? You ? In a medium where we can passively click our way through images of Iraqi prison torture or naked ladybutt, there is a disarming sense of having somehow intruded upon a little corner of the web. If good art is meant to disturb or unsettle,  urlLink Tobias Schalken  definitely manages this.

      There's a record by Estelle - called "1980" - I love it. I stop what I am doing and turn up the radio every time I hear it .Last time I really did that was for the awesome pop monster that was 'Crazy in Love'. I'm not going to go too far down the recommending records route - my mate  urlLink Loki  does it with so much more conviction, but this  is  a great record. It's about being a kid - but not that kind of pseudo romanticised nostalgia stuff. This is about playing marathon "Connect Four" sessions and believing that your nextdoor neighbours are weirdos.In this case, next door burn the house down and another guy dies and gets eaten by his own pets. Down our street we had 'The Zombies'. Years later, for my nineteenth birthday, my Dad went back and took a picture for me of them holding up a sign saying 'Happy Birthday' - what a present! Then he took a picture of the milkman and the man in the butchers holding up the sign as well. Maybe I'll put them on the site one day. Anyway, back to the record. I don't know if the neighbours bit is representative, there's a lot about trainers in it as well- you can find out details (but no lyrics unfortunately)  urlLink here .  Well, that's this weeks top choon pop pickers. Remember you heard it here first, but also remember, I am someone's Dad and a teacher....so think on.

       urlLink    Faeries, frogmen, talking apes, Rasputin, Nazis in space, giants made from melted human fat......you gotta admire Mike Mignola's willingness to take every single toy out of the toybox for Hellboy (and by toys I mean the ones belonging to the kid  next door  in Toy Story). Maybe the film will sour it all a bit when it comes out. I can't see it'll enhance it. Still, here's a gem I did find, that definitely has something to add - some lovely ecomics on the Dark Horse website. I'm not a big fan of download heavy webcomics, but these are lovely, and the slightly ponderous pace adds something to the gothic air of these strips. Even the falling snow and drifting candelabra in the Christmas tale really add to the mood. I thoroughly recommend you read these.Click  urlLink here .&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink     This appeared round the corner from us a few weeks back - don't know why I neglected to post it then, but it's interesting that it can be posted now, when the poster and the event&nbsp;have both disappeared like  urlLink teardrops in the rain .&nbsp; I seem to have posted a lot of&nbsp;this kind of stuff&nbsp;lately. Graffiti on the net interests me - I like the idea that something so rooted in a response to a particular place can have another disembodied life on the web.  Can't help thinking my attitude to graffiti is a tad contradictory though. There's some great stuff at sites like the  urlLink Wooster Collective  and  urlLink Satan's Laundromat  and&nbsp;ya can't&nbsp;deny the talent of  urlLink Banksy  and the like. At the same time, I've been known to rant at&nbsp;people as they casually tag the backseats of the already oh so lovely First Buses I am forced to travel on. Are they urban heroes  urlLink adbusting  against the&nbsp;appropriation of their environment by exploitative &nbsp;corporations?..... (I know I shouldn't rant on buses, but there's this thing psychologists call  urlLink 'diffusion of responsibilty'  - once you've learnt about it, you're forced to intervene in anything that comes your way.....)&nbsp;

       urlLink    Well, despite the  urlLink bridge closure , it seems 90,000 of us managed to get on site for Ashton Court Festival. Got there yesterday for  urlLink Roni Size  - have to say, didn't get much out of it. Haven't seen him&nbsp;live since probably Essential Fest or the 2001 New Year gig in Queen's Square. Things seem to have gone a tad poppy - dare I say 'jazzy' - since then. My mate Tony reckons that's the way the whole scene is going. Still, last time I remember mc's literally bursting onto the stage with real energy. The three female vocalists in the current line-up probably sound great in a club, or even&nbsp;in the  urlLink sadly absent&nbsp;'dance tent'  - (the police apparently charge more if there's a dance tent) - but here at the back it just wasn't reaching us. 'Brown Paper Bag' promised to liven it up, but instead of leaping straight in they went for&nbsp;a Faithless-style 'tease 'em and please 'em' approach. Someone pulled the plug on the last track halfway through and that about said it all really.&nbsp;Fans of Ron evaporated, leaving a surprised Tony and myself suddenly right at the front.&nbsp;Thus I arrived at the fest. with an unfeigned indifference to the headline act and then suddenly ended up in the middle of mosh city right the way through their set. A fine, sweaty, beery time was had by all, from the second track (my favourite 'Skin Deep') through to a glorious 'No More Heroes'.  My thoughts have been scarcely troubled by  urlLink The Stranglers  for 20 years and I was but dimly aware that Hugh Cornwell had been replaced by a  urlLink hyperactive Iggy-clone , but it was a great set. Ain't enjoyed Ashton Court Fest this much since Portishead waybackwhenever.

       urlLink    Appeared a while back on the side of the  urlLink old carriage works  in Stokes Croft (a building more offensive to the eye than anything you could ever daub on it). It appeared on one side and then, a few days later, also appeared more prominently on the side facing the main road. We had a cat that used to do this. If you ignored a dead bird left in the garden as a present, he'd move it progressively further into the kitchen 'til he got a reaction. Stokes Croft has been quite a centre for the anti-war movement. The traffic was stopped there the day war broke out and the Bristolian Cafe has become a meeting place for anti-war groups. I'm ashamed to say though, that my teacher training college days are brought to the fore by this message - I'm sorely tempted to put a red line and a little 'sp' through that superfluous 'S'....

       urlLink    I'm re-reading John Kennedy Toole's  urlLink A Confederacy of Dunces  and did a quick sketch of the central character, Ignatius J. Reilly - mainly 'cos I don't like the one on the cover of my edition. For those who don't know him, he is one of the most grotesque and repulsive characters in literature. A massive, greasy figure, his mother has fingers 'chafed from many years of scrubbing her son's mammoth, yellowed drawers' and his face has 'little folds filled with disapproval and potato chip crumbs'. Eloquent and opinionated, but virtually unemployable ('employers sense in me a denial of their values'), Ignatius spends his days lounging in front of the TV ranting at the 'total perversion' of kid's music shows. That is, until he is forced to get a job as, amongst other things, a hot dog vendor, from whence he pursues his quest to bring 'some theology and geometry, some taste and decency' to those around him.....these include Patrolman Mancuso, always in fancy dress and on the look-out for 'suspicious characters', Myrna Minkoff, his 'sex as therapy' obsessed would be lover and Darlene, a wannabe exotic dancer.  On his blog, my good friend  urlLink Mr Loki  is recommending  urlLink obscure french novels , seemingly without irony, so I have no hesitation in recommending this book to you. Drew Barrymore has been trying to get a  urlLink film of the book  of the ground for a while now. There's some debate over whether she'd be any good as Darlene, but I don't know, since I heard the rumours, it's her I see when I read the book. Here's hoping this one manages to find its' way out of development hell.

       urlLink    Well, it's another Batman post....This is one of my favourite things I've done and was a draft for a splash page in the big "Batman/bareknuckle boxing/Killer Croc" project I've mentioned before.Maybe I'll return to this someday. I dunno....whenever in my younger days I fancied writing the great 20th century novel (I  was  quite a bit younger), I never had a plot that sustained my interest for more than a day or two, yet I've been modifying a single Batman / Killer Croc comic script in my head for over a decade now.  You know when women ask you what you are thinking about ?  That's  what I'm thinking about.(That or my 'More Maul / no Gungans' Phantom Menace rewrite). Is this sad ? Yep, I think so.....

The kids all went for that garish arachnid, but I was more impressed by the understated charms of the overlooked Doc Ock figures....  urlLink    With his aggressive pincer action (strangely activated by waggling one leg), I'd have been happy to get this as a 'best present' for Christmas when I was a kid. Now, it's just free with a burger. Still, as they say (probably); "The Devil gets all the best action figures".

       urlLink    I love Elvis impersonators - they do that strange combination of ridiculous and sad that clowns do. Maybe, like Pierrot or Mr Punch, they'll be around in five hundred years time  and people will have forgotten exactly where they came from, but hopefully they'll still find them frightening, but strangely moving, during the chorus of 'Wonder of You'.
